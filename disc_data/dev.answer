 I ’ m fabulous . 
 I need to make a withdrawal . 
 I need $ 300 . 
 Take it from my checking account . 
 Thank you so much . 
 That ’ s it for today . 
 Squid balls ? How about some more fruit ! 
 Yeah , it's funny . I usually don't ever eat fruit ... 
 You know , I'm a pretty laid-back person . I don't like to have lots of arguments or worry about lots of things . For example , I like to keep the apartment clean too , but if it gets a little dirty once in a while , that's not a big deal . 
 Yeah , I really don't want a lot of drama in the apartment . It's important that we don't get on each other's nerves . 
 We hope that our cooperation will continue . 
 We do think so . 
 Terrible . 
 Someone robbed my apartment last week . The robber took $ 550 . 
 No . 
 My English isn't very good . I didn't know what to say to them . 
 Hello , Dana Okro . 
 Oh , yes . Hi , how are you ? 
 Actually , I'm really swamped right now and I'll be going into a meeting in a few minutes . Is there any literature you can send me ? 
 Let's do this . Since I'm not sure when I'll get a chance to read the material , why don't I give you a call if I have any questions . Now , I'm really sorry , but I have to get going to this meeting . 
 Sounds good . 
 No problem . Bye , bye . 
 That's right . 
 Yes , here you are . 
 OK . 
 I was responsible for sales . 
 Yes , I was twice singled out as an ' Advanced Worker ' . 
 What a beautiful sweater ! 
 Yes , and it goes beautifully with your pants . 
 I wish I could find one just like it . 
 Let's see ... my ID card , my passport , and my suitcase . I'm pretty sure I've got everything . 
 That's a good idea . Let's bring our trunks and towels . 
 I'd prefer the pool . 
 What style do you use ? 
 Hi , Francis , morning ! How are you doing today ? 
 Indeed , I agree that is not a good start . How about the meeting ? You missed anything important ? 
 Was he unhappy with you not attending the meeting ? 
 Hello ! 
 Oh , hi , Donald . 
 Well , it rained hard all day and I had a bad cold , so I decided to stay home . 
 Oh , the telephone lines were damaged by the storm . They repaired them yesterday . 
 No , they stayed home and played cards with the children . 
 No . I listened to records and studied , what did you do yesterday , Donald ? 
 You look upset , is there anything wrong ? 
 What is it ? 
 Oh , that's too bad ! I am sorry to hear that ! 
 Are you coming to the bridal shower for Jane ? 
 Aug 8 . 
 Mrs . White . 
 Maybe her uncle will . 
 Right . Red Rochester will officiate at the wedding . 
 Yes , Jane says they will go to China . 
 Well , there are two Hilton Hotels around here . Which one is your destination ? 
 Then , it would be a little bit harder to find out your way . Do you remember the name of the street , or one or two landmarks ? 
 Good , any other clues ? 
 Oh , is there a bank near there , Standard Charted possibly ? 
 That's the second branch hotel of Hilton . Walk straight down and you will see the bookstore you just mentioned . Turn left , I believe , you will get it . 
 I met a girl in elevator this morning . She works in a company upstairs . She said she envied the casual way we dress for work . She complained about the dress rule in her company . It requires everyone to wear formal clothes from Monday to Friday . 
 You know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ’ t that strict ? 
 But it is unjust to judge a book by its cover . If they ’ re not happy or comfortable with their clothes , they can be less productive . 
 Come in , please . 
 Yes.How much is that ? 
 Would you please charge them on my bill ? 
 Mary seems depressed . What ’ s the matter ? 
 Poor girl ! 
 No thanks . I've had enough . 
 To tell you the truth , I am on the diet . 
 Well , I am gaining weight these days , and I have to watch my calories . 
 You'd better tell your sister what happened and face the music . 
 Because we are partners in our science lab . Why are you so jealous ? 
 My aunt Mary just flew in from Cleveland and she laid one right on my right cheek . 
 Of course I am . I only love you , Amy . 
 Why do you always accuse me like that ? 
 Oh , Amy . I am the luckiest guy in the world . 
 Because I am loved by the most beautiful girl in the world ! 
 Do you want to practice your driving right now ? 
 Are you buckled up ? 
 Start the car . 
 Take a left . 
 I'll tell you when to stop . 
 We're back now , so why don't you try parking ? 
 Honey , could you help me here a minute ? 
 I want to put this curtain up . 
 Thanks , dear . 
 What vehicle do you usually bring to school ? Is it an automobile or a motorbike ? 
 OK . That means you can park in the student lot or on the street . Have you seen the handicapped spots ? 
 Look for the blue signs and blue marked spaces . Do you usually park in the daytime or the evening ? 
 Be careful about the time limits on the streets . Have you seen the signs for time limits ? 
 As long as you are careful reading the signs , you will always know how long you can park and what days are OK to park there . Are you aware of the curb colors ? 
 If you can remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means that you can only load and unload , you are going to be OK . 
 I've heard about it , but I'm still waiting for my invitation . 
 I'm guessing that she's going to give me my invite today or tomorrow . 
 I want to . I heard it's going to be really fun . 
 Well , when does the party start ? 
 How many invitations has she given out ? 
 I really want to go , so I hope that she gives me my invite soon . 
 Yes . 
 Thank you for calling me . I will be there on time . 
 Bye . 
 These are my roses . The roses have been in flower for a week . 
 Yes , you are right . I love flowers and hence have taken to growing them . I take care of my flowers every day as if they are my good friends . 
 Oh , I see . People who don't understand the nature of flowers won't be able to grow them well . I can help you learn more if you want to plant flowers one day . In this way you need not be afraid of your own sweet flower-garden's being neglected . 
 Good afternoon , Mr.Stein . I wonder if you are free tomorrow evening ? 
 Great ! Our president has asked me to come over to invite you to the banquet held in your honor at the Beijing Hotel at 7:00 . Here's an invitation card for you . 
 I'll be here to pick you up at 6:30 . 
 It's my pleasure . Well , then , see you tomorrow . 
 We would like to start you off at 1,500 yuan a month , not including bonus and overtime pay . We don ’ t give bonus every month , but we offer a semi-annual bonus . And you will receive two weeks paid vacation a year , as well . Does it suit you ? 
 No problem . We'll supply you with an apartment of two bedrooms and a living room . 
 No , I haven't had the pleasure . 
 All right . 
 That would be WebTracker . We're heard they're almost ready . That's why we have to finish first . 
 Right . And that would be a total giga-bummer . 
 Hello , where can I buy an inexpensive cashmere sweater ? 
 That is a wonderful idea . 
 Thank you for your help . 
 Good afternoon . Welcome to Lincoln Bank , how can we be of service ? 
 Just pulling up your information now . Yes , some documents arrived for you from Sapporo . 
 Actually , there is a problem . It's the goods description , it's a little different on the invoice , but this does happen sometimes . 
 No problem , I'll just get the form for you . 
 This must be his 21st birthday . No doubt about it . 
 No . Well , in America , 21 is the age when you're allowed to drink . So , many guys celebrate it in bars . 
 No . If it's your birthday , then you don't need to pay a cent . Just blow out the candles and open the gifts . That makes the birthday a special day . Your friends will take care of everything . 
 What about in China ? What'd you do to celebrate your birthday ? 
 You must like negotiating a lot . People are saying , you are a super negotiator . 
 I am not good at it by any means . Give me some advice . 
 Sounds easy . But how can I apply to practice ? I am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . But I am afraid our boss will turn me down . 
 Well , this is not quite the style I want . Have you any suit in fashion ? 
 Can I try it on ? 
 This is much better . How much is it ? 
 I need to book a plane ticket to London . 
 One-way . 
 Saturday , July 25 . 
 Just one adult . 
 Economy , please . Economy class is the cheapest , right ? 
 Can I leave early today ? 
 And can I come in late tomorrow ? 
 And may I take Friday off ? 
 One more thing . Would you give me a ten-dollar raise ? 
 What is the annual salary for this job ? 
 What does the benefits package include ? 
 Do we get paid time off ? 
 How about retirement ? 
 Can I get company provided specialized training ? 
 Where is the benefits office ? 
 I really hate to say this , but don't go away mad , just go away . 
 Then , why didn't you try to prevent it in the beginning ? 
 I don't want to argue anymore . Please get out of my life ! 
 No way ! Please don't follow me around . 
 Yes , I do . Leave me alone ! 
 Great . But no talking , now . Don't forget that you are on a ladder . Take care ! 
 Don't touch it with your stick . It's a bumble bees ' hive . Get down the ladder . Be quick . 
 You can get killed . No kidding . Remember , never stir up a hive . 
 It's for fun . And also , the apples here are Green Food . 
 Silly boy . Green Food means the plants grown without using any chemicals , fertilizers , and pesticides . 
 I heard they used ultraviolet lamp to kill pests . 
 What's your favorite sport ? 
 Indoors activities , such as chess and gymnastics . 
 Well , it's OK , I suppose . We get about the equivalent of six months ' salary . 
 Maybe . But you'd be amazed at how little's left after the credit companies have deducted their share from my account . 
 Well , you're lucky that you're still able to make your payments . I missed a credit payment last month . Now my bank account's overdrawn , and the company is threatening to take back my purchases . 
 A new home health monitor . 
 You're kidding ! 
 That's something else ! Maybe I'll return it to them . 
 Don ’ t be too humble . Few young men could be equal to Mark . And in some respects Joe and Mark are neck and neck . 
 I hate carrying so much cash with me . 
 I have one but it can only be used in my country . 
 Well , that's great . 
 Yes , I have . I handed in my application form two weeks ago and I ’ m going for an interview next week . 
 The application form are quite complicated . It took me a few hours to fill it out . The hardest thing was getting all the necessary documents . That took almost two weeks . 
 I had to show document relating to my financial status and of course my education , because I want a student visa . 
 I think that they don ’ t complete the forms correctly or they don ’ t include all the required documents . The embassy is very strict about it . You have to be quite careful . 
 That ’ s simple . Many people break the rules regarding their visa conditions . 
 Yes . Many things ! I especially love this beautiful quilt . 
 It sounds like a special quilt . Why do you want to sell it ? 
 Oh , I see . Umm , how much do you want for the quilt ? 
 Hello , Mr Kowalski ? 
 Which city are you staying in right now ? And the name of your hotel ? 
 Do you have your passport with you ? Or do you by any chance know the number ? 
 Let me repeat that back to you , 16211469 9 . That's just what I've done , Mr Kowalski , I've stopped your card temporarily . 
 You can go to any branch of IBA and request the Emergency Assistance Service . Everything will be taken care of , there's no need to worry . 
 Mary ! I haven ’ t seen you since our dinner with Mr . Lee last week . Where have you been hiding yourself lately ? 
 Really , nothing big . I just heard about your ideas on employee motivation and I wanted chat with you about a few things going on in my department . 
 Actually , I was hoping to mix business with pleasure . Would you be interested in joining me for dinner some time this week ? I thought we might try out the new Italian restaurant everyone ’ s been 
 Is this evening too soon ? 
 Wow ! It's hot today ! Do you want to get an ice cream cone ? 
 What's that ? 
 Do they have ice cream bars . frozen yogurt or frozen chocolate mousse ? 
 Maybe a vanilla ice cream milkshake would be good . What's your favorite flavor ? 
 God ! Even talking about it makes me feel like l'm gaining weight ! 
 Can you help me figure out how to use this vending machine ? 
 I want to buy that candy . 
 Yeah , so far , so good . 
 Yeah , I already knew that . 
 OK , let's move on ! 
 I hope it works ! 
 What is your long term career plan you set for yourself ? 
 I wonder if you could do me a favor . 
 My printer is broken . Can you print up a copy for me ? 
 Please , you write much better than I do . 
 I wonder if I could possibly borrow two bikes from the shop tomorrow ? I ’ ll take actual care of them . I promise you . 
 Oh , that ’ s all right . It ’ s very kind of you . Can I come around now ? 
 Ma , I really don't know how to thank you . 
 It's most kind of you . 
 If there's ever anything I can do for you , Don't hesitate to let me know . 
 I'm most grateful . 
 Do you know the restrictions about the carry-on items for exiting ? 
 What are the things that are forbidden to take in departure ? 
 Can I try this dress on ? 
 Well , I like the styte , but I don't think the color fits me . Could you bring me a green one ? 
 my lease ends next month , so I have to find a new place . 
 Do you know any places ? 
 thank you . I think I should also have a look at the Internet to see if anyone's got a sublet . 
 I can only afford about 1,000 yuan a month . 
 it doesn't matter , but it needs to be close to the subway or on a convenient bus route . 
 I want a bedroom with full bath , and it'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side . 
 why ? Will those be students who are leaving ? 
 thank you . I'll be sure to take a look . 
 Excuse me , driver , you have kept us waiting for 15 minutes . Can't we start the tour right now ? 
 Finally . How long does the tour last ? 
 Excuse me . I don't think we have met before . My name is Mary Jenson . 
 Good to meet you , Mr Chettri . 
 Hi , Sam . I want to buy a pet . Do you have any ideas ? 
 why ? anything special there ? 
 Oh , really ? are there any snakes ? 
 that's terrific . I can't wait to check it out . 
 why not ? it's so cool . 
 pardon ? 
 well , I didn't realize that . 
 oh , I should have thought of my brother's baby girl . Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet . 
 Happy New Year , Jim ! 
 Yeah , I'm going to the Temple Fair with my family . 
 I really have a good time here.Thank you very much . 
 I promise . 
 Hello . I called earlier in the week and spoke to someone in the personal loans department about an overseas study loan . She said to come in as soon as I had the chance , as this must be done in person . I'd like to apply today . 
 Yes , yes . It's all here . There you go . I'm not sure if I need any other proof or guarantee to get this loan , do I ? 
 Yes , I read about all of these in the brochure and decided which would be more suitable for me . I'd like to go for the guarantee mode , please . 
 OK , that's perfect , 70 % is excellent , it'll be a big help . Thanks . 
 Where did you get that idea ? 
 Well , I ’ m still not sure what you ’ re asking me . 
 Do you want to know something about the American character ? 
 No , this will help answer your question . In American society boys and girls are raised together . They ’ re not segregated in their activities ! Boys and girls go out together from an early age . 
 After being raised together , men and women can be business-like in each other ’ s company . It really doesn ’ t have anything to do with the way a man and woman behave toward each other when they are in love . Does that answer your question ? 
 I think Americans are pretty romantic when they are in a relationship and a lot of flirting goes on in every office . After you ’ Ve been in America for a while , you will probably see what I mean . 
 I'm sorry , my watch has stopped . 
 Let's ask someone else . 
 I like Chinese food , too . I like dumplings best . 
 That's good . We eat Chinese food only at the Chinese restaurant . 
 Really ? That's wonderful ! 
 I'm leaving for Shanghai tomorrow morning . When do I have to settle my bill ? 
 That will do . Where shall I go to pay the money ? 
 Would you please get the bill ready before supper ? 
 No , he will stay here for two more days . Please keep the room for him . 
 Two separate bills , please . 
 Will you give the bill to me at around six o'clock ? 
 I have had a good stay here . Your service is wonderful . I'm very satisfied with it . 
 OK , I will . 
 What time are you leaving ? 
 Take care and give my best to your parents . 
 Don't forget to call us if you're in Tokyo . 
 Oh Jackie ? We broke up last week . 
 It was actually a long two months . She was a psycho . 
 She would be laughing one moment , and if I said something insensitive , she would start crying . I didn't want to deal with that . 
 She was a psycho , man . One time we were suppose to get together . I was waiting for her call , and when she finally called , she was screaming why I wasn't at her place . 
 I thought she was going to call when she was done shopping . It was a misunderstanding . She was literally screaming on the phone over this . 
 I'm just glad it's over . 
 I told you to hold my calls . I ’ m very busy at the moment . 
 Okay . Put her through . 
 Good afternoon , passport and arrival card please . 
 Where are you coming from ? 
 Is this your country of birth or residence . 
 What is the purpose of your visit to the United States ? 
 How long do you plan to stay in the United States ? 
 Sir , you didn't fill out the information on your arrival card of where you will be staying . 
 You must specify an address of the place where you will spend most of your time . 
 Do you have enough means to support yourself while you are here ? 
 Very good . Do you have anything to declare ? 
 Very well sir , welcome to the United States , enjoy your visit . 
 All right . Which room shall I have ? 
 Hey , Ann . You don't have a pen , do you ? 
 Thanks . I don't suppose you have some paper , too . 
 Thanks so much . I owe you one . 
 I'd love to , but I'm broke . Maybe after payday . 
 Glad to meet you.Would you mind if I ask you some questions ? 
 Why do you want to go to the US ? 
 Will you get any kind of scholarship ? 
 Excuse me , did you see a set of keys ? 
 Five keys and a small foot ornament . 
 Well , can you help me look for it ? That's my first time here . 
 It's very kind of you . 
 Oh , thank God ! I don't know how to thank you , guys . 
 I like this kind of weather . 
 And it's calm . I like the peace . 
 Excuse me , I ’ m sorry to trouble you . My name is Susan Ransom , and I have placed several orders with you company . 
 Well , I wonder if you could track an order I placed with you last month . It hasn ’ t arrived yet . 
 Is it okay to have a day off next week ? 
 I need to go to the dentist . 
 What are you doing there with your mobile phone ? 
 Moblogging ? what does that mean ? 
 Sounds interesting ! That must be very convenient . 
 How can you do that ? 
 What if you want to publish some photos ? 
 I see . Moblogging must have done a great favor for habitual bloggers like you . 
 What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck ! 
 I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling ! 
 I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go . 
 I don't know . 
 What do you mean ? 
 I have plenty of gas . 
 So what can we do ? 
 Alright . That's a good idea . 
 Days ? 
 Oh , my God ! It's good we have food . 
 Okay , I'll follow your advice . 
 That's terrible . 
 Ok . 
 Thanks . 
 Don ’ t think about it ! 
 You pay for the taxi and dinner , then to even things up . 
 Well , what about this two-bedroom apartment ? The listing says it's right in the heart of the city , just steps from the metro . 
 It says it's $ 1600 . But if you share it with another person , that's only $ 800 per month . 
 That's true . I know that there are lots of popular restaurants and coffee shops around there . 
 What do you want , a single or a double one ? 
 How long do you intend to stay ? 
 We have one single room on the fifth floor . 
 It's very quiet , sir . 
 It's 150 yuan per day including a 10 % service charge . 
 Would you please fill in the registration form ? 
 As a hotel policy , we require one day's room charge as a deposit for guests without reservation . 
 Your room number is 505 . This is your key . The bellboy will help you with the baggage . 
 Of course . 
 I am sorry the larger ones are out of stock now . But you might be lucky at our Branch . 
 Yeah , my head hurts , that ’ s all . I ’ Ve been in physics class all day . It ’ s killer ! 
 Yeah , yeah , but today ’ s lesson was all about the creation of the universe . 
 It ’ s all religion . Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion ? That ’ s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff . 
 Math , sheath . What ’ s the evidence ? 
 Anyway , it ’ s just a theory . Why do people go around touting theories ? Where ’ s the scientific rigor in that ? 
 Please pull your table down . It's lunch hour . 
 What would you like , sir ? 
 You may choose from the fish and beef . 
 Here you are . Would you like a cup of tea or coffee ? 
 We have a selection of orange , apple , grape and lemonade . 
 All right . Will there be anything else ? 
 Sure . Here you are . 
 You're welcome . Enjoy your meal . Press the call button if you need any more help . 
 No , not yet . 
 I'm going to clean it up later . 
 I'm going to clean it . 
 I know . I'll do it . 
 I'm not going anywhere until later , so I'll clean it then . 
 Those poor Egyptians slaves worked so hard and you want to give aliens all the credit ! 
 OK , but don't believe everything you see on The X-files , either ! 
 Hi , welcome to Rental Property Management . How can I help you ? 
 Okay . Our rental agent will be with you in a moment . 
 Fill it up with unleaded and check the oil , please . 
 No , that's all for now . What does it come to ? 
 Irene ! I heard you were on a date last night ! So , how how did it go ? I want all the juicy details ! 
 Okay , now you really have to fill me in . What ’ s he like ? 
 He sounds hot ! What does he do for a living ? 
 Hold on a sec , his name is David ? 
 That ’ s my brother ! 
 I've been away in Paris for the last two month.Glad to see you again.How are you doing ? 
 Yes , I had a wonderful time . 
 Sure . I've reviewed all the lessons I have learned this academic year . 
 I am 100 % certain . 
 I am sure I can get a 95 this time . 
 Yes , what is it , William ? 
 All right , fine . Thank you , William . 
 To tell you the truth , it's the most tedious course i have ever had . 
 It is still a mystery to me . 
 What ? How happy you life is ! I do envy you . 
 Maybe you are right . 
 I heard it has been finally settled under the rose . 
 Yeah , fortunately it did not cause a disaster . 
 It is because Montreal is a bilingual city . 
 But it's a good opportunity to learn French . 
 Take it easy . I have the confidence to learn it well . 
 Good morning . Would you like to tell me something about the computer ? I've never seen this brand before . What is your superior brand ? 
 Can you tell me the specialty of your computer board ? 
 What's the memory capacity of the computer ? 
 Can you give me a wholesale list ? 
 Is the price negotiable ? 
 Seat 30B is right here , sir . You may take your seat . I'll put your bag in the above compartment . 
 Yes , sir . I'll bring you a menu shortly after we take off . 
 Here you are . 
 It is a six-hour flight with an-hour layover in Los Angles . 
 Honey , how is by you ? 
 Nice day , isn't it ? 
 Good idea ! 
 Can you describe the plumbing problems you are having ? 
 Okay , the bathroom plumbing needs looking at . What about the kitchen plumbing ? 
 Has this problem been going on for a long time ? 
 I will be coming over to look at it this afternoon . Will you be there ? 
 I can always use my key to get in , but I would prefer that you be there . 
 Linen.It ' s ideal for summer wear . 
 Certainly.It has been specially treated . 
 Let me see . It's five minutes to eleven . 
 I think so . I see it by the radio this morning . 
 Sure , but I have to finish this report first . 
 May I help you , sir ? 
 Please try these on . 
 I will bring you a larger size . 
 What are you getting donations for ? 
 How much money are you looking to make ? 
 Are you doing different fundraisers ? 
 You should do something else . 
 Try a car wash and selling candy . 
 You ’ ll make more money that way . 
 Yes . I hope you can help . I'm interested in obtaining a Working Capital Loan . So , I was wondering what you offer here ? Do you have various types ? 
 I see ... 
 To be honest , I'm not exactly sure what we require just now . 
 Some friends of mine are going to visit me this evening . Would you please buy some fruit for me ? 
 That's a good idea . Can you help me to get some ? 
 A basket of lilies . 
 Right . Here is five hundred yuan in advance . Is it enough ? 
 Great ! Thank you very much . 
 Honey , you really forgot about it ? Think it over . It's a candlelight dinner . 
 It's our wedding anniversary , honey . How can you forget about it ? 
 Of course . I almost missed my own wedding . 
 Oh , really ! It looks so different . Our old place turns into a brand new place . 
 I can never forget that . I bought you five candies , but I was so anxious that I forgot to give them to you . You didn't get them until we parted . Then they had already melted down for I held them the whole time . 
 You are the one I should thank . You've done really great job . 
 Yeah ! I bought it the day it was released . 
 It's a great game . There are a lot of new characters . 
 It cost about thirty . Most games cost about that much . 
 Oh , I know what you mean . I'm addicted to that game . 
 Yeah , my roommate likes to watch me play . He says it's like watching a movie . 
 And I've never heard such good sound in a game . 
 Where ? 
 That'll be 64 cents . 
 Sure . The total comes to twelve dollars and eighty cents . 
 That depends on the weight . 
 What happened to you yesterday ? 
 Oh I see . So that ’ s why you didn ’ t come in ? 
 Oh dear , that sounds terrible . 
 Oh dear . Well , get well soon and try to be more careful in future . 
 Why ? 
 I hear it's Chinese Valentine's Day ! Don't you know ? 
 It's not too late . Go to buy some now . 
 Sounds like an Italian name with an “ i ” at the end . 
 No , I'm an art lover , so I think more of Bellini and Botticelli ! 
 Don't we all ... hey ! Your cousin sells gift items ? 
 I need something to eat , please . 
 I feel like champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare . 
 Well , I prefer filet , but porterhouse is good , too . 
 Just the champagne will be fine , thank you . 
 That's fine . 
 What are the factors that have great impact on the perspective of this corporation ? 
 What are the internal factors that influence the company ? 
 I think I've got a virus on my computer . Do you know how to get rid of it ? I haven't had one before . 
 Have you got the number ? I'll call them right now . 
 May I see your receipt ? 
 I am sorry , sir . You bought it 2 weeks ago , and you can only refund it in one week . 
 I have worked as an executive secretary for 5 years , first for trading companies , and now I am working for a trust company . I interact well with peers , clients , administrators and bosses . I thrive on challenge and work well in high-stress environments . 
 I can type 100 Chinese words a minute and take dictation in English at 150 words a minute . 
 Yes , I can . I have received some special training in computers . Besides I am good at operating common office machines , such as fax machines and duplicating machines . 
 That's all right . But could you tell me how often and how many hours I should work overtime ? 
 Mr . Smith , I's like to ask you a question . 
 What specific duties would I perform if I am hired ? 
 Yes . I specialized in English secretary studies at college and that's one of the main parts of my present job . 
 I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . Maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position . 
 I think it's acceptable and I really like the job . And when can I know the decision ? 
 No . Thank you for the time . 
 Sure . What's playing ? 
 Wow , it stars Catherine Zeta-Jones , my favorite actress . 
 She is so beautiful and elegant . And she is famous for her fine acting . 
 Who is the director ? 
 Yes , a legend , also . I still remember , his movies , Jurassic Park and Schindler's List got him nine Oscar awards in 1994 . 
 It tells a romantic and humorous love story . 
 You are quite busy every day . 
 So you have to work all day . 
 I see you sometimes work on weekends , too . 
 I beg your pardon ? 
 That's very nice of you . I guess I could use some help . 
 I am going to give you an end-of-the-unit test this Friday . Please be prepared for it . 
 Review all the lessons in this unit and see if you can understand the main idea of each lesson . 
 Phrases and sentence patterns are also very important . You should know how to use them . 
 Certainly . 
 Well . When you review your lessons , mark the places which you don't understand , then I will give you some coaching . 
 How about tomorrow ? 
 Are you doing anything right now , Diana ? 
 Will you please cut it for a while and come in here to take a letter ? 
 Yes , this letter can't go into the mail any later than 5 . It's about a contract . 
 Please take a seat , Diana . Have you got your spare pens and pencils ? 
 No , I ’ d prefer not . I don't want any interruptions every other minute , but you can ask me at the end of the letter . 
 Of course , Diana . You'd better pay attention to the spelling when you type it . 
 Yes , that's fine . Now when you finish these , I want you to put these cards in alphabetical order , using the last names , and then make a list . 
 Right . And the last thing , we are going to clean the files out tomorrow . Now let's begin . 
 Yes . I urgently need a room for tomorrow night , and do you have any vacancies ? 
 I'd like a suite with an ocean view , please . 
 How are you doing today ? 
 What can I do for you ? 
 Is there a problem ? 
 How much did you write it out for ? 
 How much was it supposed to be ? 
 I ’ ll cancel that check for you . 
 IBA , Jane speaking . How can I help you ? 
 Sorry , I'm not quite sure if I understand . In what way , Sir ? Has your card been stolen ? 
 Oh , I see , Sir . Well , it does take 5 working days to issue and post the card . 
 Sorry , Sir , but it's 5 working days . This does not include weekends , so your card should be with you later this week . 
 It's no trouble at all , Sir . Is there anything else I can help you with today ? 
 What's the cost of the trousers ? 
 Is there a price reduction ? 
 What can I do for you ? 
 What ’ s the problem ? 
 Have you checked the computer ? 
 What did it say ? 
 I can always borrow the book from another library . 
 I ’ ll make the call and contact you when it gets in . 
 Excuse me , does this bus go to the new bookstore ? 
 Thank you.How much is the fare to that stop ? 
 How many stops are there ? 
 Could you please tell me when we get there ? 
 By the way , do I need a transfer again after No . 50 ? 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , I didn ’ t finish work until 9:00 pm . 
 Yes , I have too much work to do at the moment . 
 Because too many people in the office are on holiday . 
 I certainly have . 
 About two hours ago . 
 I couldn't . I was bound and gagged . 
 I was sitting in this room watching television when someone knocked on the door . Without thinking , I opened it . 
 I know . I was expecting my wife , you see , and thought it was her . 
 Yes , I know . I regret it very much . 
 Two men pushed into the flat . One of them threatened me with a knife while the other bound and gagged me . 
 I'm afraid not . They were both wearing stockings over their faces . 
 My wallet , with $ 200 in it , my wrist watch.some of my wife's jewellery from our bedroom , and a silver photoframe . 
 No . They had just begun to search when the dogs next door began to bark . Theran off then leaving me bound and gagged . It was some time before my wifereturned and released me . I phoned the police at o 
 I hated the hand-me-downs to wear when I was a kid . 
 It was not just that . I didn ’ t like them because they never fitted me . 
 Yes , sir . Please examine it . 
 No , sir . Nothing except my personal belongings , such as clothes , notebooks and some gifts . 
 I have cigarettes for my own use . 
 How much duty should I pay ? 
 Here is the money . 
 Thank you . 
 Of course . 
 No , nobody . 
 Well , to be frank , yes , I do . 
 Actually it is . Perhaps you haven ’ t noticed the sign . 
 There , on the window . 
 That ’ s all right . 
 Fine , just don't do it at night . 
 The cold weather will damage the engine . 
 Well I always hear it on the radio , so I started to get into it . 
 I totally agree ! 
 15 dollars per dozen 
 However , the quality of our exercise books is better than others . I can assure you that our price is the most favorable . A trial will convince you of my words . 
 This price of yours is out of the question . You must know that the cost of production has risen a great deal in recent years . 
 We'll have to discuss the problem later . 
 Could you give me an idea of how larger an amount you want ? 
 Then , let me check . For the large quantity you ask , considering the cost of raw materials , I think 13 dollar is our bottom line . And I can assure you this is the lowest price in the market in nowadays . 
 Excuse me Miao Li . Could you tell me who Jackie Chan is ? 
 Ha , I know Cheng Long a lot , he has made 40 films since 1976 . And at that time he was promoted as the new Bruce Lee . But I'm not familiar with his English name . 
 Some movie stars measure their worth by how many millions of dollars they make . Do you know how Jackie Chan measures his worth ? 
 Sure . His skull , his eyes , his nose , three times , his jaw , his shoul-der , is chest , two fingers , a knee . As he said ' Everything from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet ! ' 
 This is because he is the action-movie incarnate or action-star extraordinaire around the world . 
 This is the East market to Central park bus . Where do you want to go ? 
 Take the same number bus going other direction . There ’ s stop right cross the street . 
 Reservation Center , Air China . Can I help you ? 
 May I have your name , please ? 
 Certainly . 
 Yes . You are reconfirmed on Flight No . 125 for Zhenjiang , leaving Beijing at 2:00 p . m . on January 15th . 
 You are welcome . 
 Can you break a 100 dollar bill ? 
 No , I'm sorry . That's all I have . Unless you take a credit card . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Yes , it is . 
 Sure . The local train . It stops at every station . 
 You take the D train on the downtown platform , and go three stops . 
 One dollar and twenty cents . You give me the money and I ’ ll exchange it for a token . 
 You put it in the slot at the turnstile and then push the turnstile to get into the platform . 
 I'm from Germany . 
 Yeah , but I can speak English , too . 
 A little French . 
 Mary , do you often do your shopping online ? 
 How about the price ? 
 Last week , I tried to buy some clothes online , but I didn ’ t know how to pay for them . 
 Are there many things online ? 
 Excuse me , but I ’ m a bit lost here . Where does this street lead to ? 
 So is it the right way to the City Hall ? 
 Hello , Shogun Restaurant . 
 Of course , what evening will you be joining us on ? 
 What time would you like the reservation for ? 
 For how many people 
 Fine , I can seat you at 7 
 See you at 7 
 This is such a beautiful day ! Great for sailing ! 
 Why are you doggy-paddling ? I taught you how to swim ! Do your breast stroke ! 
 Try kicking your legs more . That ’ s good . Don ’ t go out too far ! 
 Kathy ! Get back here ! I see a shark ! 
 It ’ s right under you ! Kathy ! ! ! 
 You're mistaken about it . As a matter of fact , it's very hard . 
 You're quite right.But many Japanese learners begin with smiles on their faces and end up with tears in their eyes . 
 Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired . 
 With everything , with everybody , with all this ! 
 It wasn't always like this , you know . 
 Well , I mean.We always do the same thing.There ' s no variety in our lives . 
 Certainly , perhaps . 
 there's a great sitcom on Channel 3 that stars in about three minutes . 
 the office . Have you watched it ? 
 it's almost exactly the same . I think it's a hilarious show . 
 they're just showing highlights of American Idol from last night right now . 
 I couldn't agree with you more . 
 we have digital TV . It's amazing though---even with 100 channels , there's often nothing on that I'd want to watch ! 
 I guess so . I'm bit of a couch potato . How about you ? 
 there's actually a documentary on the history channel later on that I'd like to watch . Do you want to stay and watch it with me ? 
 I can't find my keys . 
 Excellent Cleaner ’ s.May I help you ? 
 Your name , please ? 
 I remember your name . Wait for a moment , please . I ’ ll check it for you . Is this black one yours ? 
 I see . Is this yours ? 
 It ’ s ready to go . 
 Hello , what can I do for you today ? 
 I see . Well , with those symptoms maybe you ’ Ve got food poisoning . What have you eaten recently ? 
 Hmm . It may be those then , especially if they were raw . Well , I ’ ll give you these tablets and you should feel fine by tomorrow . 
 You didn't tell me she was married ! 
 I got carried away . I made such a fool of myself . They were both laughing at me ! 
 That guy was definitely a Don . 
 Yeah . If I leave Little Italy alive ... 
 Did you hear who won the election ? 
 McCain is our new President . 
 I ’ m not happy about it , either . 
 I guess the people wanted him as our new leader . 
 I have to tell you something else that you probably won ’ t like . 
 I wasn ’ t serious , because Obama got elected . 
 Will you be voting ? 
 Well , when is the election ? 
 I just don ’ t know . 
 You can ’ t be serious . 
 Thanks for telling me . 
 I forgot . 
 Is there a bus in Altadena that'll take me to downtown LA ? 
 The 486 really goes downtown ? 
 How long is the bus ride ? 
 Is that right ? 
 Is that a crowded bus ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 What a beautiful day ! 
 I was worried about canceling the climbing . 
 What about taking the cable car ? 
 Wow , What a long queue this is ! 
 Daddy , look ahead in the distance , the mountains there . They roll all the way up to the sky . 
 So you wanna stay here ? 
 What would you like to drink ? 
 Wouldn't you like something to eat ? 
 Right . I'll see if I can catch the waitress's eye . 
 With pleasure , chap . But before I start , I need to know what you want a bike for ? 
 Cycling during weekends ? Do you me riding on the mountainous countryside just the neighboring towns ? 
 Can't be greater . If you ride on bumpy , hilly roads , a mountain bike is what you need . But if you just ride comfortably along the city lanes , you might choose a road bike . 
 A road bike features skinny tires and a light-weight frame . Its riding position puts you bent over the handlebars . It's not particularly beefy in construction , and generally , it won't stand up well under heavy loads or on really rough surfaces . In contrast , mountain bikes have wide tires and a stout frame . You sit higher on them and don't have to hunched over . 
 Yes , there is a lake in the park . It is very beautiful . 
 It ’ s a good idea . But I am afraid it ’ s too cold . It is very windy on the lake . 
 Tomorrow I'll take you to some places that I'm sure you will have interest in . 
 They are the Folk Antique Handicrafts and Collectibles Exhibition Halls . 
 Well . there're actually over 200 kinds of folk collections in this city . That's half the collections of antique objects in China . There's one exhibition half for multiple collection , and several individual display rooms for private collectors . 
 No hurry ! I'II tell you now , The collections include ancient cases and caskets , tea sets , abacuses , precious sea shells and conches , drama costumes , agates , ancient coins , fans , mini-musical instruments , root-carving , rare stones and rocks , model ships , model cars ... 
 Kate , can we change the channel ? 
 This channel has so many advertisements , and it doesn't have any good TV programs . 
 What about this one ? Do you like this program ? 
 Yes . Oh , it's a talk show . 
 No , I haven't . This is my first time to watch it . 
 How long have we had the A3 printer in the sales department ? 
 I'm not sure but there seems to be something wrong with it . Is it still under guarantee ? 
 Well , Mr . Cui , could you tell me why you are interested in working with this company ? 
 I see . But have you ever done any work in this field ? 
 Why do you plan to change your job ? 
 Have you applied for work with any other companies ? 
 If you are accepted at both places , which company will you choose ? 
 Why did she do that ? 
 Mr . Black ? I'm from the Pacific Mechanical Company . 
 Thank you . 
 For wood or for metal ? 
 Yes , we have a showroom not far away from here , Mr . Black . Are you free now ? 
 Fine . Then , shall we go right away ? I have a car outside . 
 Take your time , sir . I can wait . 
 sure . I ’ d be happy to give you some hints and advice . 
 it looks good to me . I would suggest that you put the client ’ s logo and our logo on each page . The bosses seem to like that . 
 why don ’ t you use a different font the headings ? They ’ ll be more distinct . 
 I think you ’ Ve included all the essential things . You might want to make the conclusion a little longer . Restate your reasons clearly . 
 definitely ! I would include one or two on each page if possible . Remember that you should make the report as eye-catching as possible . 
 Good morning , Passport , please . 
 Ah , thank you.Please bring your luggage here for inspection . 
 It's just a regular inspection.Do you have anything to declare ? 
 Well , the cigarettes and the champagne are not in excess of the duty-free allowance . But according to our law , each passenger is allowed only one camera duty-free.You ' ll have to pay duty for the other one . 
 Please wait a minute . I'll make out the duty memo ... Here you are.Take this and pay to the woman over there . 
 Very well . I hope you ' ll enjoy your stay in America . 
 Hey John . I have some great news . 
 I got a job offer from Dell . 
 I thought I did bad on the interview , but I guess I was wrong . I'm so happy right now . 
 Thanks . I feel like celebrating . Let's go have a beer . It's on me . 
 Hi , Yang Tang . Come in ! Pretty hot out there , isn't it ? Did you have trouble finding us ? Sit ! Sit ! 
 Yang Tang , just call me Fred ! Everyone does . 
 No problem . No problem at all . Say , it says here in your resume you studied in California . Great place , isn ’ t it ? I studied in California myself . I really enjoyed it . What did you like most about California ? 
 Yeah , the people are quite relaxed ... Those were some great times I spent there . Well , thanks for stopping by . Are you from King Dao , Yang Tang ? 
 Is that right ? Wonderful , wonderful . I've been in King Dao for two years now . A great place . Nice people and great beer ! Well , I guess we ’ d better get started . 
 Now that you mention it , I'm getting a little bumed-out from studying nonstop , too . Listening to some music for a while would suit me just fine . 
 You sure have a lot of discs here . 
 To tell you the truth , I'm strictly into classical music . You don't happen to have any Bach or Mozart , do you ? 
 Well , speaking of history , let's get back to the books.We ' Ve got an exam tomorrow , remember ? 
 Yes . I am a bit confused . My sociology class is supposed to read a chapter in a book called Sociology and the Modern Age . According to the syllabus , the book is in the library , but I haven't been able to find it . 
 Yes , uh ... I put it in the front of my sociology notebook . Oh , here it is . 
 I'm sorry - I still don't understand . 
 So , will I be able to find this book ? 
 Okay . Thank you . I understand now . 
 No ! I am on my way to the reserve room . Thanks again ! 
 Mine are wet , too . 
 She wished good luck to you . 
 Yes . 
 I think I'm making good progress . 
 At first it was , but now I've got the basics.It ' s fun . 
 Yes , Todd , how nice to hear your voice ! 
 I really enjoyed our evening together , Todd . 
 Hiking would be perfect ! May I bring along a picnic lunch for us to share ? 
 I'll work on the lunch , and you can work out the details of where we will go . What time will you be at my house ? 
 Nine is good . See you on Saturday ! 
 I'm in a good mood today , actually . How about you ? 
 What's wrong ? 
 I see ! Do you want to ask her out ? 
 You can ask her out for drink after work . 
 Then you've got a lot of homework to do . You need to get her notice first . 
 You can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying hello to her . 
 That's something you need to overcome . Men should make the first move as most of girls prefer being chased . 
 Good luck . 
 Yes , I ’ Ve come to inquire about a 6,000- dollar remittance from California . Has it arrived ? 
 My name is Jenny Clinton . 
 Really ? It should have arrived . It was sent a week ago . 
 Well , then I'll come again the day after tomorrow . 
 That would be very kind of you . 
 The phone number is 328 6765 extension 105 . 
 I would like to make a reservation for tomorrow . 
 Well , how about 4th ? 
 Yes . Please help me reserve it . 
 Don't worry about it . Just leave it to the insurance companies . 
 Yeah , more and more cars . People should try to take public transportation . 
 Yeah , sometimes I really feel like writing a letter to the mayor . 
 Have you taken this to the property management , yet ? 
 Where ? On the road ? 
 Is the car owner a lady with deafening voice ? 
 That's my wife ! 
 It's fine today . 
 It rained all day yesterday . The weather was awful last week . 
 It's going to be sunny tomorrow . 
 Just go to the end of the store . And it will be on your right . We have all the ice creams and frozen foods back there in the freezers . 
 Please notice all of our aisles are numbered and classified by signs on the ceiling . That might help you . 
 That ’ s correct . 
 Can't you just take it from my account ? I can't be bothered with cash dealings today . 
 You mean , if there is any left over ? 
 Right , so the deposit , if I don't draw on it will be blocked after you get the Deposit Certification ? 
 First of all , I would like to thank you for your kind invitation to visit your beautiful country . I hope my visit will help to promote a friendly relationship between us . 
 I would like to tell you that my clients are very satisfied with the last delivery of your slippers . The styles and colors are very much to the taste of our market . 
 I understand you are selling the same products to some other Australian importers . This tends to complicate my business . As you know , I am experienced in the business of slippers and enjoy a good business relationship with all the leading whole - sabers and retailers in that line . I have a mind to expand this business in the years to come . One of the reasons of my visit here is to sign a sole agency agreement with you on these items for a period of 3 years . As it is to our mutual interests and profit , I am sure you'll have no objection to it . 
 I'll come to that . My proposal is 
 Well , I admit I always do business on the safe side . Could you let me have your proposal then ? 
 You certainly drive a hard bargain , Mrs . Brown . 
 Well , if you put it this way , I'll have to comply . When shall we sign the contract , Mrs . Brown ? 
 Tomorrow afternoon will be fine . 
 Excellent ! Let ’ s set off . 
 Let me see . The one goes for $ 17 . 
 No , I can ’ t let you have it for 12.How about 14 ? 
 Sorry , $ 14 is the lowest I can go . 
 Yes , it is . 
 No , she ’ s average . 
 They ’ re dark gray . 
 It ’ s blond . 
 I don ’ t know . 
 Yeah , sure , you didn't come to class that day ? 
 Why not ? 
 Here they are . 
 Oh , no , this is the rest . 
 It's no problem at all . 
 Thanks very much . 
 I know , but there was nobody else . 
 You usually are good about turning it in ; what happened ? 
 But couldn't you have done it when you felt better ? 
 You have already missed one other assignment ; when can I expect the make-ups ? 
 That will be soon enough , but make sure you get next week's assignment in as well , all right ? 
 Good . I know that you are capable of being an excellent student . 
 Thank you ! 
 Oh , yes . We have rather mild winters . It always has much sunshine in winter . But it was very foggy when I left two days ago . I knew it would be colder here , but I thought there would be a lot of snow . 
 What is the temperature today , do you know ? 
 Oh , I'm very lucky that my wife let me take a heavy overcoat . 
 Yes , she is . By the way , what is the best season in Beijing ? 
 Really ? Then I will come to Beijing in the fall next time . 
 Is there anything wrong ? 
 Don ’ t worry . That ’ s just a part of being a teenager . 
 You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ’ t affect her decision . 
 Oh , she can make her own decisions . 
 Believe me . Everything will be ok . 
 Is Tom available please ? 
 Sure . 
 Happy Birthday ! This is for you , Kate ! 
 You know in China we usually don't open presents until the guests leave . 
 Do you like coffee , Ann ? 
 Do you want a cup ? 
 Do you want any sugar ? 
 Do you want any milk ? 
 Do you like biscuits ? 
 Do you want one ? 
 Could you help me figure out why I am missing my unemployment check for this week ? 
 I am pretty sure that I didn ’ t send that claim form in . 
 Can I mail it in late ? 
 I think that I will mail it in right away when I get it next time , so I won ’ t be late . 
 Even though I was late turning in my form , will my paycheck be late ? 
 How do you like you dishes today ? 
 I am sorry for that . We will improve the dishes next time . 
 Leave it to me . I'll fix it . 
 We'd like to sign a year-long contract , if that's OK . 
 Yes . We've signed them before . We even brought our chops . 
 We'll sign our signatures , too . And give you our passport numbers along with our ARC numbers . 
 So what are you doing for Thanksgiving ? 
 Well you know , it's a time to get together with all your family and be thankful for everything ! 
 Well , the first settlers of Massachusetts arrived there because of religious persecution from England and King James . Once in the New World , they befriended an native named Squanto , who taught them how to harvest food from the area such as corn . 
 Well , they had enough harvests for the next winter and celebration 。 They decided to have a big feast for the natives , giving thanks the land , and everyone for the foods , healthy and new lives . 
 Come to my house for Thanksgiving ! We are having turkey , pumpkin pie , mashed potatoes with gravy , and lots of stuffing ! 
 Hello . May I help you ? 
 That one is one hundred and fifty dollars . 
 That ’ s one hundred and forty . 
 This is an exclusive design by marco ! It ’ s a bargain at that price . 
 Okay , okay , how about one hundred dollars ? 
 Okay , I can give you a special discount , just because you seem like a nice person . One hundred and ninety dollars for both . 
 my final price ! One hundred dollars for both ! That ’ s two for the price of one . That ’ s my last offer ! 
 John ? I have to say I was bothered by the way you handled the meeting today . 
 I think it would have been better if you had given us more of a chance to give our opinions . 
 Hi , how is it going ? 
 That ’ s right . I ’ Ve never really liked it since I got here . 
 How have you been doing ? 
 How long have you had this toothache ? 
 Is there anything that you ’ Ve done to your tooth that might have caused the pain ? 
 When you brush your teeth , what do you use ? 
 Does it bother you when you have to chew a lot ? 
 How was your trip to America ? 
 Did you go to the Magic Kingdom ? 
 Playing the chess is very exhausting , isn't ? 
 I'm afraid playing the chess like that will soon make me an old man . I noticed that most chess players were bald . 
 I heard you were promoted to general manager of IBM's China Headquarters . 
 You did a good job for the company . You deserve it . 
 So . this is your first day in the new position . How do you feel ? 
 I believe you are cut out for this position . You're an outstanding individual . 
 Mom , I finished . 
 Of course . 
 OK . Now I'll put the dishes in the sink . 
 OK . Then I will clean the table . 
 Leo ! I wanted to tell you thanks for all your hard work on the budget . We ’ re having a get-together after work tonight at Carl ’ s Karaoke Club to celebrate having finished it . We ’ d love to see 
 Oh , right . You ’ re busy with that contract . Maybe you could join us later ? 
 Happy anniversary ! Sorry you won ’ t be there . Maybe some other time ? 
 I would like to order a suit made to my own measure . 
 Maybe I should try to lose weight . 
 Who broke the glass , Peter ? 
 I was not born yesterday . It must be either you or Adam . 
 Why is little Billy crying ? 
 Tell me , Mr . Han . What do you suggest if we establish long term business relations ? 
 I am all ears . 
 Sure . As for our financial situation , you can inquire about them in the national bank . They handle all our financial documents . 
 A very good question . It's very honorable for me to tell you that our business relations cover all over the world and they all have very good business reputation . 
 We deal with kid's clothing , women's clothing , and men's clothing . You name it we deal with it . 
 As for the regular customers , we have some favorable terms for them . 
 For the substantial regular customers , we offer 5 % commissions . 
 Fabulous . I will get the contract ready shortly . 
 It's 8 sharp by my watch . 
 Can ’ t you remember the days when you had the hots for me ? 
 By the way , are you going to the concert tomorrow ? 
 Are your ready to go to the supermarket ? 
 I've got my money and my keys , so I'm ready . 
 It wasn't cold out this morning . 
 Well , I guess we'd better grab our umbrellas then , as well . 
 It does , actually . Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping . 
 Ok . I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . It's a bit chilly in here . 
 I don't know . The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night . 
 I don't think we have anything to worry about . Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ? 
 If I'm not back in ten minutes , come and find me . 
 Yeah . Just pull on this strip . Then peel off the back . 
 If they don't think this is fun , they're not meant to be our friends . 
 Yeah . But it's fun . Look at those two ugly old ladies ... or are they men ? 
 I knew you'd come around ... 
 Yes , tomorrow is my friend's birthday.Could I arrange a birthday party for him through you ? 
 I want to order a large birthday cake , several kinds of cold dishes , pastries and fruits . 
 I've got whiskey and brandy but I need some beer and soda.That ' s all . 
 Thank you for saying that . It's a present from my girlfriend . 
 The flood will come on the heels of the heavy rain . 
 I ’ m sure they will . 
 No , I haven't . What's going on ? 
 Yes . The lights were out all night . 
 What do you mean ? 
 People went out and looted ? 
 Did the police find who did it ? 
 I hope we don't have any more blackouts . 
 I like popular music best . 
 Who is your favorite singer ? 
 Do you know this song ? 
 Let's sing it together , shall we ? 
 Yes , ma'ma . May I help you with your bags ? 
 Flight 36 to Washington.It ' ll be on the plane for you . 
 what ’ s the cheapest way to go there ? 
 Oh , is that right ? Is there a subway station near here ? 
 Good . Can I walk through this building ? 
 I see . Thank you . 
 You still have time on your lease . 
 That ’ s not going to be all right . 
 I ’ m going to have to keep your deposit 
 Because you ’ re leaving before your lease is over . 
 You ’ re not going to get it . 
 I can ’ t help you with that . 
 Sorry , you have the wrong number . There ’ s no Brian here . 
 No , it ’ s 777-9344 ? 
 That ’ s OK . 
 Hi , Lin Tao . I have't seen you for some time . 
 Yes , the same as ever , thanks . What about you ? 
 Good bye then , and keep in touch . 
 Excuse me , could you do me a favor ? 
 We are busy in preparing for the train.Would you please buy us some fruit ? 
 Apples and pears , one kilo for each af them , please . 
 What ’ s wrong with it ? 
 It sounds too bad . What will you do ? 
 That ’ s what I want to say . 
 We are interested in this field . 
 That girl looks very attractive , doesn ’ t she ? 
 I ’ d like to , but there ’ s her boyfriend . He ’ s very broad-shouldered . 
 Do you prefer tall girls or short ones ? 
 We have different tastes . I like girls with short hair . I like tall girls-probably because I ’ m so tall myself . 
 No , never . I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever met a girl taller than me ! Have you gained weight recently ? 
 I'm getting a bit plump myself . Perhaps I ’ ll go with you . 
 Did I ? 
 No so good . I broke traffic regulations yesterday and I got a ticket . 
 Certainly , as long as you don't tell my wife . 
 No , I didn't . And you ? Was it good ? 
 How much was the ticket ? 
 Good morning , Mr . Smith . Welcome to Wuhan . 
 Mr . Smith , did you have a good journey ? 
 You must take a rest today . 
 We welcome good business . Anyhow , we know you must get tired by the flight , so we arrange a meeting tomorrow . Today you can have a good rest . 
 We hope your stay here a pleasant one ! 
 Welcome . What can I do for you this morning ? 
 Well , welcome to our country . I trust you are having a pleasant stay ? 
 That's the opinion of most people . Do you have your passport with you ? I'll need to see that and you'll need to fill in this withdrawal form . 
 How much would you like to withdraw ? 
 That's fine . 
 Here's your money , your card and your passport . Please double check the amount for me . 
 Good moming.What can I do for you ? 
 OK , sir . Here is your bill.That ' s $ 1000 all together . 
 Of course , you can . 
 It was terrific.The concert was really a hit.The symphony orchestra was so good that I was completely absorbed in their performance . 
 Oh , speaking of the conductor , he is indeed a genius.He did a perfect job.His name is Menuhin , a descendent of Russian American immigrants . 
 Absolutely right.He gave a performance of Felix Mendelssohn's violin concerto.That caused a sensation.The audience were stunned by his pure tone . 
 Yes , I did . 
 Yeah . 
 Nice to meet you guys . 
 Who's that guy who's handing out beer to everyone ? 
 He sure is ! 
 Is that boy standing there your brother ? 
 He's really a good player . 
 Good morning , madam . What can I do for you ? 
 Certainly , madam . What kind of coffee do you want to have ? 
 Well . We have espresso , latte , skinny latte , fancy coffee and Americano . 
 OK . Wait a minute , please . And the sugar is right over there . 
 One of the reasons for our good quality products is because of our quality inspection system , which is the best of its kind . 
 We have trained analyzers to do quality analysis at the end of each part when we make the product . This means that no mistakes are made . 
 Certainly . We provide quality analysis training as part of the training for all new workers , plus a week of further training every year . 
 Haha ... please don't tell me you've got a dead stack . I hate making cold calls ... 
 Don't worry , I've gotchy covered . 
 Yes , I am . 
 Do you have a special restaurant in mind ? 
 OK . I'll be happy to join you . 
 Not at all , Sam . 
 Excuse me , I ordered the well-done steak , but this one is so tough . 
 I think you should be more careful next time . 
 Good evening , sir . What's your pleasure ? 
 With or without ice , sir ? 
 Would you like to say ' when ' , please , sir . ( Pouring soda ) 
 Enjoy your drink , sir . 
 We haven't decided yet . Could you give us a little longer ? 
 Can we get something to drink ? We want two bottles of beer . 
 Could you tell us your specials today ? 
 We'll take this steak dinner . 
 Peas and carrots . 
 Icecream , please . 
 I usually have the wrong notion that he's very serious . 
 No wonder when I pass your room , I always hear your laughter . 
 Oh , hi again ! Hey , the fruit looks different this time . 
 It looks really artistic ! How did you learn to do that ? 
 You know , art is something I've always been interested in ... 
 I cooked , so ... 
 So what brings you to my office today ? 
 How long has your tooth been bothering you ? 
 Have you injured your tooth in any way ? 
 Do you have a special kind of toothbrush that you like to use ? 
 Does it bother you when you eat something really sweet ? 
 I'm feeling wonderful . 
 I'm no exception , and that's why I spent a whole afternoon in the swimming pool . 
 What do you think of our price ? 
 Yes , we regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly . 
 I don't think so . You must compare our price with that it other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level . 
 I'm afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price . 
 We've already cut down our price to cost level . 
 Yes this is the best we can do . 
 Can you make a suit for me to order ? 
 By the way , what's the charge for the tailoring ? 
 Yes . Of my mother standing in the kitchen and me doing my homework before school ... 
 OK ! I'll show you how my mom did it . 
 Yeah , and it's bigger than ours was . 
 John's father got married again . 
 If I tell you . , you must be completely taken aback . 
 He married a girl who is only eighteen ! 
 Here is your room . I hope you like it . 
 The room is away from traffic noise . 
 Here's the bath . 
 There's a bag in the bathroom . Just put your laundry in it . 
 We do , as most hotels do . 
 There is house phone only.But you can ask the operator for city calls . 
 Yes . Shall I get one for you ? Just push the button over there if you need anything . 
 That's no problem at all , but could you fill in this and I'll need to see some ID . 
 Yes , there needs to be at least 1 RIB paid in to open a new account . Also , you will need to choose a secret identity code to ensure no one else can enter your account . 
 Just 6 digits . 
 But you just got here . Can ’ t you stay a little longer and have some tea ? 
 That ’ s too bad . 
 Thanks for coming . 
 Great idea . I ’ m looking forward to it . See you then . 
 Good night then . 
 What were you and Richard talking about earlier ? It looked intense . 
 Oh , no . I know how insensitive he can be . What has he done now ? 
 But , you were born and raised in California ! 
 What a racist ! How can you stand working with the guy ? 
 So , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn English ? 
 Are you sure he really got the message ? 
 That's hilarious ! What did he say ? 
 I'm glad . I bet he won't make that mistake again . 
 Speaking . May I help you ? 
 We serve a great variety of popular Japanese dishes in set courses , and also many meat dishes . 
 We are open until 10 but our last order for dinner is at 9:30 pm . 
 Thank you , sir . We look forward to welcoming you . 
 About 50 miles . 
 No , but we ’ Ve got a hurry . It will be the rush hour soon . 
 But it ’ s Friday today . This road is always jam packed during the weekend , isn ’ t it ? 
 Good morning . 
 I'm phoning about the job that was in the paper last night . 
 Oh , Candida Fawcett . 
 Well , I just thought that it was right up my street you know . 
 Yes , arm , I'm 23 . I've been working abroad , I'm um ... 
 hi , Emily , do you know that guy over there ? 
 He is cute.What dose he do ? 
 Really ? Are you going to introduce us ? 
 I would like to take my vacation next month . 
 I would like to take my two weeks vacation time . 
 Great . I will make my reservations as necessary . 
 Could you pass me the jacket with wide lapels ? 
 What do you think of it ? 
 Janice , do you still remember how our filing system works ? 
 Very good . What is the essence of filing , do you know ? 
 Yes , ' One customer--one file ' is essential . And remember to update them timely . 
 Correct . 
 Yes , prompt and careful filing contributes greatly to the efficiency of our office . 
 This is she . How's it going ? 
 Sorry about that . I was cleaning up . 
 So what were you calling me about ? 
 Sure , what did you want to do ? 
 That sounds like fun . Let's do it . 
 See you then . Goodbye . 
 How tall is this building ? 
 I have heard its name is connected with someone , is that right ? 
 Hi , Mrs . Henderson . 
 Of course I have plenty of time . What's new ? 
 No . The Hills ? Who filed for divorce first ? 
 Oh , maybe not . It's just your guess . Do not give currency to idle gossip . 
 Jim is a genius . He gets along well with everybody and he can always get the work done . 
 Everybody would like to have Jim on their team . Because he is funny and helpful and he can contribute a lot to the team he belongs to . 
 Right . 
 Oh , I took up a new hobby . 
 No , Frank . I'm much more interested in collecting stamps now . 
 It certainly is . It's so much fun . 
 Absolutely . Through all kinds of stamps I am able to learn about the world . 
 You're right . And I also meet many new friends while collecting stamps . 
 Sometimes we even spend hours discussing our collections . 
 Yes , it's really amazing . I got to go now . I'm meeting with some other collectors . 
 See you , Frank . 
 Yeah , that was close . 
 I ’ m looking for this book . 
 I don ’ t see it on the shelf . 
 I already looked . 
 It said that the book is on the shelf , but it isn ’ t . 
 Could you do that ? 
 That ’ s great . Thank you so much . 
 Yes . When I saw the advertisement I thought it would really suit me . 
 I think that I'll be really good at this kind of work . In fact I learn so fast that I'll be looking for promotion very shortly . 
 A laboratory assistant helps to maintain scientific equipment , keep a check on the supplies in the store , and prepare the chemicals for experiments . 
 I suppose I'm a reasonable student . I passed all my tests and enjoyed studying subjects that interested me . 
 Maths and chemistry were my favorite subjects at school . I also enjoyed history . 
 Well , I've thought about doing the part-time Chemistry Certificate course at Technical College . I think I would really benefit from doing that . 
 Yes . I have worked part-time at a take away food store-the one just round the corner . 
 Well , I've found out a lot about this type of work and my research suggests that I would be quite capable of doing the work involved . I also think that I would be able to handle any training course reasonably well . 
 Thank you . When will I know if I am successful ? 
 Goodbye . 
 What for ? 
 Oh . I've really forgotten it . 
 A silk scarf . I love it . Thank you very much . My lovely son . 
 So , Paula , where are you from ? 
 From Canada ? Where were you born ? 
 When did you come to Los Angeles ? 
 Did you go to school here ? 
 Did you get a job right after graduation ? 
 When was that ? 
 I bet that was interesting . What did you do there ? 
 Why don't we get ourselves a new car ? The old one's falling apart . 
 What kind shall we get ? 
 Yes , fine . 
 Why not sometime next week ? 
 OK . 
 There's a car dealer down the road . How about going there ? 
 Fine , We'll do that . 
 Wait , Jimmy , it ’ s cold outside . Put a hat on ! 
 No , wait , you will be too cold without mittens . 
 Hold on , with that wind , you ’ re going to catch a cold . Wear this scarf . 
 Oh ... and ear muffs ! Put these on ... here we go . 
 Yes , honey ... 
 How long do you plan on staying ? 
 We are open from nine to nine . So be sure to be back by then . 
 Alright . There's a spot open at the far end of the lot . Here's your parking stub . 
 Please drive slowly . 
 Really ? How do you know that ? 
 Why ? That ’ s good news , but no one knows it ? 
 Freeze ! Police ! Put your hands over your head . 
 You are suspected of hiding illegal drugs , so we are taking you into custody . We ’ Ve found some heroin in your house . You have the following rights while you are being interviewed . You have the right to remain silent . You don't have to make any statement against your will . You have the right to defense counsel . You have the right to request an investigation of evidence favorable to your case . Do you understand your rights ? 
 I'm going to Japan this year on vacation . 
 No , but I'd really like to . 
 Good morning , sir . Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 No problem . How would you like your suit ? 
 That's fine . You can get it 6 days later . 
 Go ahead . Waste your money . 
 Well , I don't ... anymore . 
 I didn't say I was going to deprive myself . 
 There are many stores selling handcrafts in Paris . Our store is wellknown for vase , table wear and jewelry boxes . You can take your time and choose whatever you like . 
 You have made an excellent choice , it is our newcomer . The tapestry is on hot sell with the design and quality . The design on it is traditional Paris architecture . 
 100 frances . 
 We have a piece of table clothing to go with it . It is a brocade one with pretty stars . 
 You are right . 
 OK . Do you like these candles ? They are on sale now . 
 Your definition on success ? 
 What ’ s your ideal job ? 
 How would you describe your relationship with your last two supervisors ? 
 How would your present boss describe you ? 
 What would your colleagues say about you ? 
 Nice to meet you . 
 I ’ m excited to speak to a candidate . 
 What is your stand on gay marriage ? 
 So , would you make gay marriage legal ? 
 I ’ m sure plenty of people won ’ t like that . 
 I like that . 
 Good morning , Sir . 
 Is this where I catch the bus for the zoo ? 
 That ’ s a little troublesome . 
 Maybe that ’ s what I'll do . Thanks a lot . 
 See how many people are here ! 
 Other than the employees , our boss Jack invited some friends of the company . 
 Of course not ! We have to sit at our assigned seats . I think our table is over there in the back . 
 Look who you get to sit next to--Tim from purchasing ! 
 Don't worry . I'm also sitting next to you . 
 I can't wait until we get our year-end bonus ! 
 Hi there , I'm Steve Saunders.What ' s your name ? 
 Yes it is , better than I expected it would be.The presenters have been first rate.Is this the first conference you've been to ? 
 I'm from Long Island , New York.What about yourself ? 
 Wow . I really like California ... the weather there is much better than the East Coast . 
 Just once.Quite a few years ago we took the kids to Disneyland on our vacation.They had a blast . 
 Two , a boy and a girl.They ’ re already grown now . 
 We ’ re going to the Dragon Boat Festival tomorrow . Feel like coming along ? 
 Really ? I think you ’ ll love it . 
 I'm coming to pick up my ticket . This is my reservation note . 
 Here you are . How much is the ticket ? 
 Can I pay by card ? 
 What would you like to be in the future ? 
 But if I were you , I would be a singer . You've got such a beautiful voice . 
 Are you sure about that ? 
 Well , you know what , don ’ t do it , ‘ cause the minute you do , they lose all respect for you . 
 Out of hand . 
 Where ’ d you meet him ? 
 About what ? 
 Excuse me ? 
 Hi , Li Ming . You look upset . What's the matter ? 
 Why ? We can leave school earlier that day . 
 I can't believe it . My parents never beat me . 
 You can ask the teacher for help . 
 Bill . Bill ! You gotta help me ! 
 Tomorrow is Christmas and I haven ’ t bought my mom anything ! I ’ m such a bad son ! 
 That ’ s just it ! I don ’ t know what to get her ! Last year I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small ! I suck at getting presents for people . 
 Yeah , you ’ re right . When it comes down to it , I can be pretty tacky . 
 Now that ’ s a great idea ! 
 Well , I ’ m favor of the Red Sox . They ’ Ve had a good season . 
 That ’ s not a very good pick . I ’ m against the Yankees . 
 Yeah , I ’ m with you on that . 
 Can you imagine she's over forty ? 
 Absolutely . She's a teacher of aerobics . 
 I usually go to the supermarket , near the station . 
 I think they are quite reasonable , and the vegetables are very fresh . 
 Only 2 dollars and 25 cents . 
 Thanks ! We love it . 
 I ’ m just not looking forward to cleaning it ! 
 I get antsy not because you praise a guy , but because you may be taken for a ride by a guy like him . 
 Because you seem to have lost your vigilance . You should be on the watch out . 
 Isn't there anything that sounds fishy ? 
 All-right guy ? All right . Let's talk about something else instead . 
 Thanks , doc . I ’ Ve got a really bad toothache ! I can ’ t eat anything , and look , my face is all swollen . I think it might be my wisdom tooth . 
 Is it gonna hurt ? 
 Ok , spit . 
 Of course . This camera is easy to operate . 
 It's made in China . 
 Not very expensive . 
 OK . Do you want any film ? 
 Here you are . 
 This area here is where we keep our raw materials . The main production area - our machine hall - is situated next to it . Maintenance is situated between the stores and the production area . Just to the right of Maintenance , there are steps up to the Lab and the Admin Section . Process Control is also on the upper level . It's located above the factory floor so that the operators can monitor everything that is going on below . 
 while I think it's great that they're trying to get people to quit smoking , but I don't really care for the advertisement . 
 the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing ! 
 I know , but I think it's not really appropriate for young children . 
 all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty . 
 I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them . 
 you have to give them credit , though . It's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking . 
 So it seems . And what are you going to do about that ? 
 I've heard that Tom is going to move . 
 Yeah , he is going to move next month . 
 He is going to Canada and to live with his son . 
 Why did you say that ? It's a good thing for him to live with his son . 
 Me too . But anyway we hope he lives happily in the future . 
 Pots and pans are right over there . 
 Could I interest you in our store credit card ? 
 But our credit card saves you 10 percent . 
 Here . Let me give you an application form . 
 Okay . Enjoy your browsing . 
 The acting of the heroine is too artificial . 
 What can I help you with today ? 
 The library closes at six o ’ clock . 
 Not always . 
 Yes . 
 The hours are from 9 am - 6 
 Do you need anything else ? 
 Are you going to come home late tonight ? 
 How can we avoid the jam ? 
 OK . 
 Hello ! 
 I'm sorry , I'm afraid you've dialed the wrong number . There is no Petti here . 
 I'm sure you have the wrong number . This one has been my number for more than 20 years . 
 No , It isn't . It's 736-4565 . It seems you've misdialed . 
 That's all right . This sort of thing happens all the time to everyone . 
 No worries . 
 Fantastic ! I got an overall score of eight . 
 Yes . I'm just waiting until I officially get admitted to the university with a conditional offer to apply for my visa . 
 No . 
 Welcome to IBA . What can I do for you today ? 
 No problem . Could you let me have your card and the money to be deposited ? 
 Yes , it's the same every day during the lunchtime rush . We will be putting in a new ATM in the near future , though . That should help to ease the queues . 
 I know what you mean . How much would you like to deposit with us today ? 
 That's correct , 1,000 RIB . I'll need your personal code to deposit this . Could you enter it on this key pad , please ? 
 It will show in your account straight away . Here's your card back and could you please sign the slip here ? 
 so , tell me about your new house . How is it different to your old one ? 
 so , it ’ s a three-bedrooms detached house ? 
 what ’ s the kitchen like ? I know both you and your wife like to cook . 
 are the rooms nice and bright ? 
 do you have a balcony ? 
 you ’ re right on the edge of the city , aren ’ t you ? There can ’ t be much noise or traffic there . Is it easy to get into city centre ? 
 Did your wife give birth yet ? 
 Congratulations . How is your wife doing ? 
 That's good to hear . 
 If your wife and baby are both happy , what more can you ask for ? 
 That's normal for anyone with a newborn . 
 You'll get used to it . After everything stabilizes , you can regain your health . 
 Mr . Smith , how was your flight ? 
 What was the weather like in New York ? 
 Ah ! It hurts . Don't touch it . 
 The shoulder . 
 It's not a cut . It's a gash ! It's bigger than a cut ! Ah ! I need a doctor . 
 I'm bleeding too much . 
 Yes . My bike has one under the seat . Get it , quick ! 
 Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist.That will work as a tourniquet.After that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound . 
 No , forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood . 
 I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed . What do you think ? Damn , it hurts ! 
 I'm lucky I wasn't killed . I must have been going around forty-five miles an hour.There was too much gravel on that corner . I slid out . 
 Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped.Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk . 
 There . Stop ! 
 Terrible . 
 I ’ Ve got a fever and really a bad headache . 
 I ’ Ve already tried some but it didn ’ t help . 
 Yeah , I guess I should . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Our dinner is ready . 
 Potatoes , tomatoes and cucumber . 
 It is said that greens can improve our metabolism . In addition , I want to keep fit . 
 I didn't buy any of it at all . Most health food are good for you , but don't taste good . 
 I am clear about your sweet tooth , so I made a mixed fruit dish for you . 
 How much tea are you going to order ? 
 When do you want to deliver the goods ? 
 I'm sorry , but June 30 is quite soon . I can't guarantee 1 500 cases , I'd prefer the first shipment to be 1,000 cases and the next 2,000 cases . 
 Let me affirm this again - the first shipment of 1,000 cases , to be delivered in 27 days , by June 30 , and the second shipment of 2,000 cases by August 15 . Right ? 
 Well , if there's nothing else , I think we've settled everything . 
 Hi Isabel ! You wanted to see me ? 
 Is everything okay ? You seem a bit preoccupied . 
 Okay ... 
 What ? Why ? I mean ... just like that ? I ’ m fired ? 
 What ! I resent that ! 
 Could you tell me which kind of payment you'll choose ? 
 Will you please have the check certified ? 
 It's just our policy . We would accept a certified check or a direct bank remittance . 
 I ’ m reporting from Channel 5 News . 
 I want to ask you a couple questions . 
 Have you voted yet ? 
 Who was your vote for President ? 
 Why can ’ t you tell me ? 
 I see . 
 Jim , how was your weekend ? 
 That sounds like a lot of fun . Did you go swimming , too ? 
 I couldn ’ t agree more . That ’ s an ideal place for a vacation . 
 I can ’ t wait to go there myself . 
 You ’ re welcome . I enjoyed helping you . 
 Sure . What ’ s up ? 
 Are you going fishing ? 
 Well , don't worry . I ’ ll take care of the business for you . Have fun ! 
 I liked it . I thought it was great . 
 Yes . I thought it was excellent . Didn't you ? 
 It's a nice cinema , isn't it ? 
 Happy birthday , Jim ! 
 Here is a present for you . I hope you like it . 
 I'm very glad to hear that . 
 How do you dispose of the waste in your factory ? 
 What about the rest ? How do you get rid of it ? 
 But doesn't incineration produce carbon monoxide ? 
 Can you show me how to use this phone ? 
 No , I don't hear anything . 
 I'm not sure . 
 I am trying to call a client . 
 No , I don't know anyone's extension . 
 Hi , Jenny . You look like you are in a hurry to somewhere . Where are you going ? 
 That's great . We can go to the bank together . 
 I will go to Japan on business for 5 days next Tuesday . I want to exchange some Japanese yen . 
 Not really . I plan to bring some cash and withdraw money at the ATM in Japan . 
 Nope . You can use the credit card to withdraw the money in foreign countries . 
 No . It is free of charge . 
 I think we are running out of time . The bank is going to close soon . 
 Hello . I would like to speak to your director of human resources , Ms.Jenkins , Please . 
 This is Bill Burton from Milford Insurance , I'm calling in regards to our meeting next Tuesday . 
 No problem . 
 How long do we stop over here ? 
 What for ? 
 Can we get off the plane ? 
 Where did you go yesterday ? 
 Did you go shopping ? 
 Oh , did you get a job ? 
 Fantastic . 
 I've had good responses from the Beijing Times , help-wanted ads . 
 OK . Monday is the big day for job ads . 
 Let's post on the Internet , too . Will get a better response . I'll post the ads . I know some good sites . 
 Mrs . Phoebe , let's talk about the delivery arrangement for our goods . 
 I informed my company and was told that the first five thousand by the end of this month . 
 We can deliver the balance at the price already quoted in 10 days . 
 I am afraid we can not do that . Would you be willing to sign an annual contract on the basis we discussed ? 
 Of course . Well , in that case we could offer a 5 % discount for a confirmed monthly order for the next 12 months . 
 I'm afraid that's as far as we could go . We'd already be stretching ourselves to the limit . 
 What ? 
 nothing 
 Yes , I am . 
 I don ’ t actually know him . 
 I only know him through the ... you are not gonna believe this . 
 Yes . 
 I have read your resume.What is your last job ? 
 Could you introduce your biggest accomplishments in your last job ? 
 Great ! Could you tell me your educational background ? 
 Why are you willing to work for our company ? 
 OK , that's all . We'll inform you in two days . 
 Excuse me , would you get me some paper napkins ? 
 Could you recommend some dessert ? 
 Don't you have cheese ? 
 Good to see you . Come on in . 
 Oh , you shouldn't . But thank you very much . 
 Oh , really ? Where ’ d you find it ? 
 In the ads ? Are you serious ? 
 I ’ d like to hear about this apartment . 
 What is the rent each month ? 
 That ’ s amazing . The rent is very cheap . 
 It ’ s a good thing that you read that ad today . 
 We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? That will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock . 
 OK , I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it ? 
 OK , will do . 
 Janice , I found you stole my vegetables at four o'clock this morning . Is that true ? 
 It is so hard to prevent them from being stolen . I also got something this morning . 
 I stole many from Fred's farm , and from yours . I planned to have a dog on farm . 
 I could not agree with you more . For us , there are so many unhappy things and I am so bored ; however , I got lots of fun from stealing . 
 But we still need to go back to it . Don't overdo it . 
 I guess the first thing is the price , the second is the size , and of course the color will play a role too . But I have to be honest . It is our today ’ s responsibility to take care about our environment . Therefore , I will also pay attention to the fuel consumption of the car . You know , the rise in gasoline prices is huge . So I would rather to consider a smaller car with smaller engine . For which I can also save some tax . Last of the list , I also consider the safety . 
 Well , I do prefer the lower emission cars as long as it doesn ’ t cost much . Some environmentally-friendly cars are really expensive . 
 Are you familiar with the office management ? 
 Are you still interested in it ? 
 Could you introduce to me the man over there ? 
 You're so kind . 
 Not bad at all . 
 I was unable to make it . 
 Is that right . Who ended up winning ? 
 I wish I was free that night . I'm kind of mad that I didn't go . 
 What was the score at the end of the game ? 
 Sounds like it was a close game . 
 The next game , I will definitely be there . 
 Yes . Sit down , please . How did you learn about our company ? 
 Why would you like to work with us ? 
 Oh , really ? Would you transfer to another company if it is not what you expected ? 
 That ’ s fine . Thanks for coming to see us . I hope to be able to let you know about the job within the week . 
 Yes . My home freezer is not working properly . 
 It keeps running all the time , never stopping . And it makes a strange sound . All the ice cream inside it melted . 
 Can you send the technician to check it out ? 
 Okay . I ’ ll pay the charges . 
 My number is 627-555-1234 . 
 Thank you . Good bye . 
 And so , that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next year . Thank you very much for your time . 
 Aw , come on ; it was nothing . I'm just doing my job . 
 Well , Kristin did give me a hand with the slides.She ' s a real wiz on PowerPoint . 
 Yeah , well , that was some good advice . You made some really good points . 
 Welcome to Galant . How can I help you ? 
 Of course . We have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . The first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . This is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps . 
 Well , this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . I suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . That way you can play games online without any lag . This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall absolutely free ! 
 Lucky for you , this month we aren ’ t charging our normal installation fee . You are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! And we ’ ll throw in this pen drive ! 
 You like this china tea set , don't you ? 
 Sure.How about the brown one ? 
 The blue one ? 
 You've made a good choice.This china tea set is unusual.It was made in Jingdezhen . 
 Yes , sir . 
 That black sheep . It serves him right . 
 It ’ s too late . 
 Didn't you say you want to buy a top hat ? 
 I don't like caps at all . 
 I stayed home because I wasn't feeling well . 
 My stomach was bothering me . 
 I'm still feeling a little sick . 
 I'd appreciate that . 
 Certainly . Here you are . It's a new arrival . 
 Sure . The fitting room is in the corner . 
 I want to file a complaint . 
 A man robbed me today . 
 I was robbed this morning . 
 He took my phone and my wallet . 
 I saw him perfectly . 
 I could do that . 
 I ’ Ve only find a few openings in my field . 
 Unfortunately not . If I can ’ t find anything in that field , then I could also work in the marketing field . 
 Yes . 
 Really ? What is it ? 
 Do you think they'd hire me ? 
 There's plenty left . Would you like another helping ? 
 Good afternoon , Mrs . Brown . I've come to see Mr . Brown . 
 Is he in ? 
 Oh ! I just drop in on him for a chat . 
 No , thank you . Please tell him to phone me when he comes back . 
 Of course . 
 Sure . At present one dollar is equal to 6.4392 yuan . How many dollars would you like to change ? 
 Please wait for a moment ... Now here is your Chinese currency . See if it's right . It's 3,220 yuan . Please keep this exchange memo . You may need it for converting when you leave China . 
 It's my pleasure . 
 I'm very delighted too . I'm sure that we'll have a wider range of cooperation . So , let's drink to the signing of our contract . 
 Cheers . 
 Not yet . I don't know how to fill out the form . What is the tax-free allowance for supporting a dependent ? 
 If I don't pay my taxes , would the tax officials discover it ? 
 have you bought a present for jim ’ s birthday yet ? 
 I ’ m having the same problem . I want to get something really special . Jim always seem to know exactly what to get people as gifts . 
 he bought me an iron . 
 maybe not , but my iron was getting old . In fact , it stopped working the week after jim bought me the new one . It ’ s as if he knew that my old iron would soon stop working ! 
 yes , I do . Let ’ s go . We should be able to find something suitable . We should get him something old ... something historic . 
 I ’ ll be happy to get him something special , even if it coasts a little extra . 
 I wonder if I can see your mother , little boy . Is she engaged ? 
 Johnny , I wish you ’ d stop reaching for things . Haven ’ t you a tongue ? 
 Have you decided what you'd like ? 
 And then ? 
 What can I do for you today ? 
 Can I do anything else for you ? 
 Is that all ? 
 May I see your library card , please ? 
 Will that be all for today ? 
 These are due back in two weeks . 
 Are you ok , Chuck ? You look pale . 
 Oh , poor you . You know what ? I found a new way to learn Chinese and it works very well . 
 Sure . I'm learning Chinese through songs . 
 You can say that . I can actually sing some of them now . 
 I start by listening to the song a few times and after several times I am able to follow the singer . 
 It does . I've learned some Chinese folk songs this way . They are clearly presented and easy to follow . 
 Why not ? I downloaded a beautiful song the other day . We can learn it together now . 
 Yes , just in case we run into me new characters . 
 Why have you decided to change jobs ? 
 Then , why do you want to work for our bank since it's a new establishment in Shanghai ? 
 It certainly is . But the work is also hard here . You need to put a lot of long hard hours on the job to succeed in this field . 
 Do you mind going on frequent business trips ? 
 Hey Claire , you've been really quiet these last few days . Is something wrong ? 
 Well , stress is a real thing . It's not an imaginary condition . 
 You're not weak ... you're stressed out ! Stress has been a part of the human condition for millions of years . Back when we still lived in the trees we had to watch out for predators ... and as you might imagine , that was pretty stressful . 
 But you're actually having the same reaction as our tree-dwelling ancestors ! It's called the flight or fight response . Each time you feel like something's threatening you , your body decides whether to run away or fight ... it causes all sorts of chemical reactions in the body . 
 It could . Modern humans actually have more flight or fight responses than our ancestors did . They just had a couple of close calls every day , but today , we have dozens or even hundreds ! 
 May I introduce myself ? I am steven smith . 
 Excuse me . Where are you going ? 
 I'm afraid you can't today . 
 Only on Saturday and Sunday from one to five p . m . 
 Which tooth is it ? 
 Ar , Yes . There ’ s a big cavity . 
 I ’ m afraid not . The tooth is too far gone . it'll have to be taken out . 
 you ’ d better wait , the gums are swollen . Take the medicine I prescribe and come back in three days . 
 Yes , but I don't know much about it . 
 My favourite is Jasmine tea . I like its aroma . 
 What's wrong with you ? 
 Well , maybe the net is slow now . Try it again . 
 It's beyond question . You can save it the same as a document . 
 It's the same as usual . The only difference lies in that you need to paste the book as an attachment . 
 There are limitations to the capacity of an E-mail . Commonly it's no more than 4 MB . 
 You can divide it into several documents to mail . Or you can download the mentioned software from the warning . 
 We're waiting in line to get one of Master Li's Chinese couplets . I got one last year and I had good luck all year ! 
 He's Taipei's most famous calligraphy master ! Quick ! Get in line ! 
 I find it really hard to express myself in class . I have lots of ideas , but they never seem to come out of my mouth . 
 I often do , but I ’ m worried about the responses from other people . 
 I ’ m worried that what I say will not make sense . 
 that ’ s a good idea . What should I do if I am in two minds about a topic ? 
 I didn ’ t realize that speaking in class could be so easy . 
 Thank God ! I am finished writing that service guide ! It took me forever ! 
 This morning ! No more overtime , and no more headaches ! 
 Hey there , how are you doing ? 
 Well , I got laid off , and I ’ m looking for work . 
 Right now , I ’ ll take about anything that will pay the mortgage . 
 I went out on one interview , but I haven ’ t heard back from them . 
 You know , I saw that and it looks pretty good ! 
 Sit down , please . Mr . Tang , do you bring any paper or certificate with you ? 
 Are you still working in Youth International Travel Agency ? 
 How many foreign languages can you speak ? 
 Damn Scott . You got big . 
 How long have you been lifting weights ? 
 Yeah . Last time I saw you , it was like 2 years ago . 
 How often do you go to the gym ? 
 That's a lot . 
 I don't think I have the discipline for that . 
 I have some photos here taken by myself . Would you like to see them ? 
 I would get Fuji 200 film for taking photos of natural beauty . 
 Who is the next ? 
 All right . Over here , sir . How are you today ? 
 How do you want you hair cut ? 
 Yes , sir . I will use the scissors.Do you always part your hair on the left ? 
 That will be 3.50 dollars . 
 Thank you very much . Come back to see us . 
 Unfortunately , it's just too expensive for majority of consumer to afford . 
 It's not just that the price is high , it's that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly . 
 Most current computer systems simply can't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities . 
 But by then , the technology will be outdated . 
 That's right , no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable . 
 I guess you get what you pay for . 
 This is my first day here . 
 I started school somewhere else . 
 I started at PCC . 
 My grades weren ’ t good enough to go here . 
 I loved PCC . 
 I ’ m excited to be here . 
 What happened ? 
 What is your most preferred training method ? 
 Well , that is also very efficient , right ? 
 That ’ s boring . Once we were asked to watch a video on how to operate the punches , all of us seemed to fall into sleep by the end of the video . 
 Yes , they are the latest designs . Would you like to try them on ? 
 The oval shape one ? 
 I think it suits you well . 
 How about this ? They're the same shape . 
 Twenty dollars and sixty cents . 
 No way . Look . That's what the meter says . 
 How do you feel about this restaurant ? 
 I really enjoyed the food . 
 I enjoyed the fish the most . 
 The macadamia cake was out-of-this-world ! 
 Yes , the service really added to the experience . 
 Bill , will you be free at noon ? 
 We need a new filing cabinet in the office . Could you go downtown with me after lunch ? 
 Yes , the same as the one we have . And we also need some small articles in the office , such as pens , clips , erasers and sticky notes . 
 Susan has already given me a list of all the stationery which we need to buy . 
 How did they hear ? No one called . 
 His mom and dad must be destroyed . He was their only son . 
 Yes ... thank you for understanding . We have to go now . 
 Kate , will you please make ten copies of this report ? 
 Then use the xerox machine . 
 Oh , forget it then . Hey , I told you to put the files on the in tray , not on my desk . 
 Very funny . What's wrong with you today ? You are my secretary and you are not supposed to talk to me in that tone of voice . Do you know that ? 
 Keep your voice down , Kate . I know you've had a hard day today , but you should at least show some respect for me . If you really don't feel well , go home . There isn't much work today anyway . 
 Please pull your vehicle over to the side of the road . Please roll down your window . 
 Have you been drinking ? 
 Really ? But I can smell alcohol on your breath . Blow into this breathalyzer , please . 
 If you refuse to blow , you'll receive a much severer punishment . 
 Your BAC exceeds the legal limit . 
 I'll have to write you a ticket and suspend your driver's license for 3 months . 
 Well , let's see . Why don't we go dancing for a change ? We haven't done that for a long time . 
 Hmm . Well , in that case , we could go to the movies . 
 Well , do you have any suggestions ? 
 It's OK with me , but we don't have any beer and things . 
 OK . 
 OK . Steven , you're looking at a picture . Please describe what you see ! 
 OK . Have you ever been on a double decker bus ? 
 Oh , really . Mm ! How much is the fare ? 
 Mm , yeah , who can you see on the bus ? Can you pick out anyone on the bus who looks interesting ? 
 Is that how you feel on the bus ? 
 So , so you're British , do you missing them ? 
 Isn't this fun ? 
 Just follow the foot movements . Brush left , brush right ... yeah ! That's it ! 
 Let the men take the lead ! 
 Oops ! 
 If I were on as many steroids as he was , I think I ’ d be powerful , too . 
 Those drug tests don ’ t mean anything ! He probably took some other drugs to mask the steroids . 
 OK , OK . I ’ m feeling a little dehydrated . Let ’ s get something to drink . 
 Good afternoon , Tina . 
 I'm not sure yet . And you ? 
 Is skating interesting ? 
 But I can't skate well . 
 It's very kind of you . 
 why , Jerry ? Your words just came out of the blue . 
 I work very hard and that's it , you know , practice makes perfect . 
 I have no idea . 
 well , Jerry , let me tell you a secret . 
 my IQ score is slightly above average . 
 maybe I've got a higher EQ . I'm not sure . 
 you can say that again , Jerry . And I'm sure you're high in both of them . With a little more time cracking the books , you can also get high marks . 
 let's go ! 
 Welcome to ABC Company . We have been expecting you , please have a seat . I will call him . 
 Mr . Thomas will be here very soon . In the meantime , may I ask all of you to sign in so that I can issue your passes ? 
 Yes , please . Please print your name and company name , and the person you are going to see . 
 Hey , it's an English song ! Sing with us , Ryan ! 
 Everyone in Taiwan knows it . Come on ! Sing with us ! 
 Show me the photos of the latest hair styles , will you ? 
 This one will suit me best.What do you think ? 
 No , thank you . 
 No , nothing of the kind . 
 I haven ’ t decided yet . But I may go out . 
 I want to go to Shanghai , but I also want to visit Hainan . 
 I don ’ t know . How about you ? are you staying here or somewhere . 
 By train or by plane ? 
 Wow , is that your sports car ? 
 I love it ! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar . Is it in good condition ? 
 What's wrong with it ? 
 When's the last time you had it serviced ? 
 I thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis . 
 What else is wrong with it ? 
 Anything else ? 
 Why don't you get it all fixed ? 
 Well , let me know when you can get it fixed . I ’ d love to go for a ride in it ! 
 Oh , is it ? Let me check . 
 I'm sorry to say this room charge is yours . 
 Do you have any evidences ? 
 Hello . Where are you headed today ? 
 Do you have your passport with you ? 
 Fortunately for you , you don't . Next time , if you have any questions about visas , you should try to find out before you get to the airport . 
 Would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ? 
 Let me see here ... yes , there's one left . 
 Alright . How many pieces of luggage are you checking in ? 
 If that's your only piece of luggage , it is small enough to carry on with you . Would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ? 
 You're here a bit early , so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour . Here's your boarding pass . Enjoy your flight ! 
 Follow this road and turn right at the second intersection . It'll be right there . 
 No , it should only take you about 15 minutes by foot . 
 I'm pleased to meet you again , Mrs . King . 
 You've had a good trip , I hope . 
 It's been a full two years since we last saw each other . 
 We shall be pleased to talk the matter over with you . You've done very well in fulfilling the agreement . 
 Yes , we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos . We can see you are experienced in this particular line . 
 But I think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in Canada is rather conservative . After all , you sold around 400 pieces there last year . You can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end . 
 500 pieces . 
 All right , let's fix it at 450 pieces then . And for every additional 50 pianos sold , we'll give you 1 % higher commission . 
 We would like to make a specific mention of one more point . As our sole distributor , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own . 
 Another thing is that every six months we would like to receive from you a detailed report on current market conditions and the users comments on our products . 
 Good , that's all then . 
 Excuse me , is this the parcel post counter ? 
 ( At counter 1 . ) Do you take parcels here ? 
 I want to send this package to Los Angeles , please . 
 I'd like to send it by regular mail . 
 Here is 200 . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , I ’ Ve come in apply for the position as head of claim department . 
 My name is Zhang Due . 
 I graduated from Beijing College of Foreign Trade . My major was International Trade . 
 Yes , I have been working in Lush Insurance Company for four years . 
 Yes . 
 Yes . 
 I'm tired of Mexican food . Besides , you picked the restaurant last week . 
 I need to know why I'm being charged $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered . 
 Monday night ? Monday night I was at a great concert . 
 Thank you . It's very nice when problems can be solved quickly . 
 Are you crazy ? You made the mistake and now you're charging me for your mistake ? 
 Why don't you just stick a gun in my ribs and take everything I have ? 
 Excuse me Miss , my friend is sick . 
 Yes , please give him some water . 
 And do you have any medicine for air sickness ? 
 I ’ ll appreciate your help 
 I've already told my buddy , Mark , that I am going hunting with him in Alaska . 
 Hey , I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . I am sorry that bothers you . 
 Says who ? I don't think that is necessarily the case . 
 Whatever you say ! 
 Yeah , I quit . 
 I'm fed up with his boring lectures . 
 Yes , where's the meat counter ? 
 I need to buy some pork for the party . Give me about one kilogram . 
 I wonder if the chops are fresh . 
 One kilogram , too . 
 No , thanks . 
 OK . Well the problem is that the apartments in the heart of the city are usually more expensive . 
 Well , maybe you could get a two-bedroom apartment downtown and share the rent with a roommate . 
 Hello , do you have any vacancies ? 
 What kind of apartment is it ? 
 What are you doing to your house ? 
 What are you going to do to it ? 
 What colour are you going to paint them ? 
 What else are you going to do ? 
 Can we talk about this bonus plan of yours ? I ’ Ve got a few problems with it . 
 Well , to be honest , I just don ’ t think we ’ re going to have enough funds to give the kind of bonuses you have in mind . 
 Hectic . It's always hectic . But how was your windsurfing ? 
 See ? I told you . It's very hard . 
 Fifty times ? 
 And how much did it cost to rent it ? 
 Well , that's not too bad then . 
 Yes , but you have to calculate a little.You paid fifty dollars and you fell down fifty times.So you only spent one dollar per fall . That's cheap . 
 Yes . I need a belt that is kind of casual and kind of dressy . 
 All right . Thanks a lot . 
 Good morning . I'm calling to ask if you have a vacant apartment . 
 I prefer a one-bedroom apartment . 
 I'll share it with one of my friends . What ’ s in a one-bedroom apartment ? 
 Is there any furniture ? 
 It sounds wonderful . Do I have to sign a lease ? How much should I pay ? 
 When can I come over ? 
 OK . Good-bye . 
 I haven't danced for a long time . 
 We must go to a dance soon , or we'll forget how to dance . 
 I've been studying hard for my examinations . And you ? 
 Why have you been learning Japanese ? Why not English ? 
 Well , we'll both have to start learning all the new dances . 
 A good idea . They can teach elephants to dance nowadays perhaps there's hope for us ! 
 What's the matter ? 
 What teams are playing tonight ? 
 That will be a tough match , right ? 
 What are we waiting for ? It's already 7 pm now . Let's buy some drinks and desserts now . 
 Good evening , Mr . Taylor . I'm so glad you were able to come . 
 Now dinner's ready . Let go over to the dinner table . Would you like to use the chopsticks or the fork and knife , Mr . Taylor ? 
 Yes , hope you like it . Do you need beer or wine ? 
 I'm glad you like them .. . We'd appreciate your kind consideration in the coming negotiation . Let's drink to our friendship . 
 I used to be down on the sales people until I saw her in action . 
 Most salespeople seem like half-brains . Zina's definitely an exception . 
 Yeah , I'm not too worried about Vince , but I'd hate to face Zina if we don't deliver ... 
 I would like to have a pair of trousers made to measure . 
 Besides , don't make it too loose . 
 What kind do you have ? 
 Make it French please . 
 I'd like to open an account . 
 Actually , I'd like to open one of each , if that's possible . 
 What are my choices ? 
 Where is Pamela ? 
 She told me she'd be here . 
 Are you rushing me ? 
 I know what I am doing . Don't worry . Can you do me a favor ? 
 Take care of Pamela when I am away . She is a nice girl . I don't want her to get hurt or anything . 
 Thank you . Now I see that you are my true friend . Most of my so-called friends left me at the moment my company went bankrupt . You are the only one who has stood by me the whole time . 
 Thank you for being a friend of mine . 
 Thank you . I have to leave now . If you see Pamela , tell her I'll write to her . 
 It's fun . 
 What are they ? 
 Wow ! 
 Two waves ? 
 And the other half come in later to pick up the second wave . 
 It's the most fun I've had in years . 
 Yes , we should . 
 I want to send this letter to the US by airmail . 
 Have you signed up to join the company ’ s Christmas party ? 
 I will . You know , as a newcomer , I think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere . 
 I hope that it is not a formal one when the boss is there . 
 Don ’ t worry , I can handle that . And I know if the boss is there , even it is an informal evening , it does not make a good impression to get totally drunk in front of him . 
 To this place , please . 
 How long does it take to get to the hotel ? 
 Here's the hotel . 
 That's 10 dollars . 
 What are you going to cook ? 
 A teriyaki bowl sounds nice . 
 All you need to make it is white rice and some teriyaki beef . 
 The first and simplest thing you have to do is make some white rice . 
 Then you should shred your beef and pour some teriyaki marinade over it . 
 Then all you need to do is cook it and enjoy . 
 Is Dan in ? 
 Yes , this is Tom White . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes . There are trains at 7:59 , 9:18 , and 10:32 . 
 At 9:36 . 
 There's one at 7:10 p . m . and the next one is at 7:40 p . m . 
 If you get on before 4 p . m . or after 6 p . m . , there is a saver return which is 9 pounds . An ordinary return is 16 pounds . 
 Good morning . SRC international . How may I help you ? 
 Certainly . Who should I say is calling ? 
 And what is it regarding please ? 
 Of course , Please hold the line Mr . Hunter . 
 I wish I had studied here . It's more than a university . 
 Woo . It has such a long history . I think I should take more photos of the university . 
 No , he has mended his way . After his father died , he set his hand to the job of putting his business affairs in order . 
 You can ’ t imagine what he is like now . 
 Yes , that ’ s right . After graduating from high school in New York I attended York University in the UK . My major was English , and my minor was business studies . I completed my BA in 2004 . 
 Yes that ’ s right . I ’ Ve always enjoyed studying . My friends say I ’ m a bit of a bookworm , but my father always pushed us to succeed academically . 
 Well I ’ Ve always been keen on writing , so I became the editor for the University student magazine , which I really loved . Also I volunteered for a group called Shelter , to help the homeless in York . 
 Providing warm meals and shelter , especially in the winter months . I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group . 
 Yes , okay . 
 It's a great honor to have you here , Mr.Brown . 
 I look forward to seeing you soon.Goodbye ! 
 It is unnecessary . I'll see you off at the airport . 
 I have no idea . Maybe she had a fight with her husband . 
 We have Sichuan food , Hangzhou food and Beijing Food . Which do you like best ? 
 OK . How about Dongpo meat ? 
 Do you like to use chopsticks 
 Do you like some soup ? 
 We have beef soup and tomato soup . 
 According to usual practices , we serve dishes first and then soup . If you like we'll bring you some soup first . 
 All right . I'll be back right away . 
 Hmm . I ’ m pretty booked up this week . Let ’ s move it up to next week . 
 Let me take a look . All right , that ’ s no problem . See you then . 
 It's hot . 
 Let's just hope it doesn't get hotter . 
 Which song ? 
 No , I've never heard of this song before . It's beautiful ! Who sing it ? 
 No . How about going to karaoke tonight ? 
 Can you tell the result ? 
 Now the score is in our favor . 
 Hard to say.Now the score is in our favor . 
 They're still fighting hard.Let ' s wait and see . 
 is that the girl you spent almost every weekend with ? 
 I am not good at picking gifts . Maybe you can ask if there's anything she needs to make it easier ? 
 yeah , that's nice . 
 a plant ? That's creative . I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you . But there is a problem . Do you think it'll be able to go through the customs ? 
 I don't know . I think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer . You don't want to get her in trouble . 
 I Couldn't care less . 
 Let's play some music ! I feel like dancing . 
 Ahh ! Now that's more like it . Atmosphere ! 
 Oops ! It's the landlord . I guess the tables have turned now . We're the noisy neighbors . Turn it down ! 
 Your secretary seems to think she is being harassed . 
 I wish I were , but i am deadly serious . She said you invited her to dinner last week . 
 Well , there is no problem there . But she seemed to think that you were angry when she refused , and that your motives are personal and not professional . 
 Our harassment policy requires that we have a meeting with the HR manager and Miss Brown . It's quite serious . You could be reprimanded , or even fired if we find evidence that you were pressuring 
 That's the purpose of the meeting . Sometimes a mediated conversation will straighten things out , and a little discussion and apology can calm the waters . 
 Thank you . See you . 
 Actually , I received that kind of training when I was in college . 
 I worked as a PR clerk for one year 
 Ah , never mind , please . 
 I am 25 years old . 
 No , I am still single . 
 Ok.There are four persons in my family , my parents , my elder sister and me . 
 I've been through a lot today . I forgot to set my alarm clock last night , so I woke up late this morning . And what is worse , I missed the school bus . 
 What do you think a job means to you ? 
 May I ask you why you left the job ? 
 Hello , sir . Is there anything I can help you find ? 
 Need a gift for your girlfriend or wife ? 
 Well , if you need anything , just ask . 
 It's on the third floor . Turn left when you get off the escalator . 
 He is a dishonest man and always tells a cock and bull story . 
 I don't know . 
 Yes . 
 It is not true . 
 Well , I confess . I did it , because I urgently need money to buy some medicine for my mother for she is badly ill . I'm ashamed that I did that . 
 I will . 
 I ’ d like to use my Master Card , if I could . Hey , wait a minute ! This is a bit more than I expected . Why is it so high ? 
 What ’ s this here – “ house stock ” ? 
 I had no idea – and look at these charges for movies ! 
 Yes , that ’ s right . But I had no idea I would be charged for all this . Thank goodness my company will let me reimburse all this . 
 My brother-in-law is having a small get-together at his house and he invited me . 
 A bit of both . Some cousins , aunts and uncles will be there , but also some friends from the neighborhood . 
 Yeah he is going to be there with his step-son and his ex-wife . 
 No , Rick is actually my great uncle , so he is my grandmother's brother . 
 I'll explain later , let's go . 
 It's the key for the safety deposit box . 
 You're welcome , glad to be of assistance . 
 Really ? Where did you hear that ? 
 I'm not sure ... well , first , it couldn't be George . He is such a kiss-ass . He'd wash the boss's dog if he asked . 
 That's true . What about Lisa ? I bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her . 
 Well , okay . Then there is still Michael . But he's the boss ' pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . It definitely won't be Michael . 
 Well , it could be me too . But I am not too worried . This place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hard-ass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . It would almost be a blessing to be fired from this place . 
 Yes , what a wonderful day ! The sky has cleared up in the end . 
 How about taking a walk in the park ? 
 ( After they entering the park ) Great , it's so quiet here . We have the park to ourselves , only you and me . 
 Oh , I see them . Beautiful weather should be shared by all the people . 
 Good afternoon , sir . Please sit here . 
 How would you like your hair cut , sir ? 
 Very well , sir . Do you want me to trim your beard ? 
 Now have a look , please . Is it all right ? 
 Is that satisfactory ? 
 Do you want conditioner ? 
 Yes , sir . 
 You should go to the counter , just over there . 
 Speaking . Who's calling , please ? 
 Oh , hi , Tom . How've you been ? 
 Let me see . Uh-huh ... no , I guess I'll be free . 
 Sounds like a good idea . 
 Thank you for inviting me . See you then . Bye , Tom . 
 Next week there will be a meeting with the manager of USE Company ; this is an important opportunity for our company to have a new relationship with a new partner . So , I want you to prepare an instruction book with detailed introduction of our products . This introduction will be presented in the meeting . 
 Remember to add an agenda for this meeting and show our warm welcome to them . 
 Good idea ! The pictures will illustrate the performance of our products vividly . 
 A , do your best , it's very important . 
 Is this a photo of your family ? 
 You look so lovely . 
 When the rain stops , you ’ ll see how beautiful the beach is . 
 And this bedroom is too big and damp . But it ’ s better than a tent . 
 What's that ? 
 Is that Hello Kitty ? 
 Is it real gold ? 
 I'm dreadfully sorry for you . 
 Is there any clue ? 
 Good morning , Miss Cai . Congratulations ! You ’ Ve passed the interview . 
 Oh . Take it easy . As I ’ Ve said in the interview , once you are employed , we ’ ll give you a probation period of three months . And now we need to sign a draft agreement for the probation period . 
 Of course , here you are . And you can ask me any question . 
 Well , according to the principle of our company , employees like you have no remuneration during the probation period . 
 I am sorry , it ’ s not decided by me but by the company . 
 Okay . Can you give me a reply tomorrow ? 
 Have you ever gotten a parking ticket ? 
 How many is a few ? 
 Have you paid all your tickets off ? 
 How much is the fine ? 
 That's not cheap at all . 
 Pay it off , and they'll clear your record . 
 Solomon , I thought we had agreed to change this deadline . 
 I ’ ll have to think about that , Ms . Solomon . 
 Maybe you should talk to the teacher . 
 You never know unless you try . 
 If you go out recently you will find some people riding scooters in high streets and back lanes . 
 Looking at the ' five sense organs ' of a scooter , it can be said as delicate and agile . To pull the T-shaped pole and make it vertical with the flat board and then pull it vertically , adjust its height suitable to you and you may use it . 
 Your two hands hold the pole , stand on the board , the other foot steps back against the ground and controls well the balance of the body , then you can ride in the air . It has a feeling of surfing . You need not let other people teach you . Your fear will disappear quickly . 
 I'm not certain . Do you know ? 
 In a way that's right . But the Vikings travelled there long beforeColumbus . And what about the Red Indians ? 
 Who invented the electric light bulb ? 
 Correct . Now for a harder question . Who will be the first men on Mars ? 
 Ask me a question now . 
 That's easy . It's .. er . Venus . NO . Pluto . No . Wait a minute . It's Anthe tip of my tongue . Oh dear , what is the nearest planet to the sun ? 
 What's that ? 
 Really ? It's unbelievable . 
 Do you have Ginkgo trees here ? 
 What are these trees opposite to the pine trees ? 
 I think I know that . 
 It wasn't all that great . 
 I don't think that they had their act together . They didn't seem well prepared . 
 I wasn't all that impressed by the food . 
 The service did not help the situation . 
 I am not interested in trying this restaurant again . 
 Thomas , if I could write with the beauty in her eyes , I was born to look in them and know myself . 
 Her lips ? The early morning rose would wither on the branch if it could feel envy . 
 Deeper , softer , none of your twittering larks . I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupted her song . 
 Constantly . Without doubt , and plays the lute . She has a natural ear . 
 Give it here . 
 I think it ’ s my acceptance letter from NYU . 
 They didn ’ t accept me . 
 It ’ s the truth . 
 I really wanted to get into NYU . 
 It ’ s okay . I ’ m still waiting to hear from UCLA anyway . 
 So do I . 
 I'd like to send a fax to Shanghai . 
 Document . 
 Here you are . 
 How long will it take to get to Shanghai . 
 Oh , excellent . How much does it cost ? 
 What would be the earliest that I could actually move into my new house ? 
 What should we do to make sure that we have the electricity and water turned on ? 
 There are a few things that we want to do to the place , like painting and carpet cleaning . 
 I asked the store to deliver my new appliances on the day we are moving in . 
 I could use some help on moving day . What are you doing on Saturday ? 
 Bob's sister will go to America . 
 I thought you wanted to know more about her . 
 You are not being a good sport about this . 
 I never cheat . 
 your mp3 looks so cool . Where did you get it ? 
 really ? Do you often shop online ? 
 I've never tried E-shopping . Is it better than shopping at an actual store ? 
 sounds good , and I don't have to queue up at the cashier . 
 well , are there any other advantages ? 
 are there many choices of online shopping ? 
 perhaps I should have a try . 
 Really , it's so beautiful . 
 You mustn't pick it in this place . 
 It's a private garden . 
 I've been feeling under the weather recently . I caught a bad cold last week , and I still haven't got over it . 
 I guess so . Even though I seem to be over the worst of it . I don't want to give the bug to anyone in the office . 
 Mom , what are you doing ? 
 Still clipping coupons ? 
 Saving money ? How much money can you save by those 1 or 2 dollar discount coupons ? 
 Well , we've settled the question of price , quality and quantity . Now what about the terms of payment ? 
 I see . Could you make an exception and accept D / A or D / P ? 
 To tell you the truth , a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import . When I open a letter of credit with a bank , I have to pay a deposit . That'll tie up my money and increase my cost . 
 Still , there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . It would help me greatly if you would accept D / A or D / P . You can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit . It makes no great difference to you , but it does to me . 
 To meet you half way , what do you say if 50 % by L / C and the balance by D / P ? 
 I'd like to make an appointment with Dr.Cooper.Could you arrange it for me ? 
 Sorry , I've got a meeting from nine to ten.What about Monday afternoon ? 
 Man , I ’ m freaking out ! You gotta help me ! 
 I can ’ t go through with this ! I just can ’ t ! I ’ m not ready for marriage ! What was I thinking ? I ’ m only thirty five years old ! I ’ Ve got my entire life ahead of me , adventures waiting ! I can ’ t settle down yet ! 
 I know . I know ! 
 You ’ re right . I ’ m being crazy ! Ok , I ’ m ready , let ’ s do this ! 
 You voted , right ? 
 Who did you vote for ? 
 Can you believe that he actually won ? 
 I didn ’ t think he would . 
 I figured people wouldn ’ t vote for him because he ’ s African American . 
 You ’ re absolutely right . 
 Why are you arresting me ? 
 What kind of warrant ? 
 What is that ? 
 I never went to court . 
 This is unfair . 
 I have rights , don't I ? 
 Hey Suzie . Guess what ? I'm having a baby ! 
 Thanks . I'm so excited . We've been trying for 8 months now . 
 Three months . 
 I want to , but Bob doesn't . He wants to be surprised like the old fashioned way . 
 I'd rather know and buy all the baby things ahead of time . 
 I know I am going to be busy , but I know I can handle it . I have been looking forward to this day for a long long time . 
 Thank you so much . 
 Here you are . 
 Yes , I am . 
 Fujisan Province . 
 It's not surprising . Our school year just ended , and a lot of Chinese are on vacation . 
 About half a month . 
 Thank you . 
 I ’ Ve been playing computer games . 
 It ’ s called Counter Strike.It ’ s a first person shooter game.It ’ s awesome.It ’ s a multi player game where you can go online and compete against players from all over the world . 
 My laptop is on my bed . If you think it ’ s so easy then get on line and try to beat me . 
 Damp it ! How are you killing me with a single shot ? It ’ s not fair ! I don ’ t want to play anymore ! Let ’ s go get something to eat . 
 I need something to wash this down . Is there any juice in the fridge ? 
 It's a green drink . It's supposed to be full of vitamins and minerals . 
 The sales lady said that even if I eat right , I wouldn't get enough vitamins . 
 It's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day . 
 Oh , no . It looks like we're late . 
 There're so many people here . Where are Rich and Cath and Taylor's parents ? 
 That was such a touching speech . He must have really known Taylor well . 
 Get up as early as six o'clock only to be jammed at every crossroad and still late for work . What a life ! I've had enough of it . 
 What should I do then ? 
 I know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus . After all , it's a sport . But do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty , polled air on the road ? 
 What should be put in my education background ? 
 What do you mean by ' job intentions ' ? 
 Does tea-serving follow any special etiquette in China ? Each time I dropped in at my Chinese friends ' homes , their parents would offer me a cup of hot , strong tea , though they never inquired of me about whether I want it . 
 So the guest is presumed to be thirsty and in need of some drink after the trip . In that case , I guess , in return , the guest doesn't have to drink it if he wouldn't like it . 
 So next time , I'd better take a few sips , to ' save face ' at least , right ? 
 What does that imply , then ? 
 Hey , Sandy , what's new ? Interested in a movie tonight ? 
 Soup kitchen ? Is that a new restaurant or something ? 
 How did you get involved in something like that ? 
 So what do you do there ? 
 Yeah , it sounds easy . How long does it take ? 
 I don't know . I mean , I like helping the community and all that , but I don't know if I have the time ... 
 How often do you service the pump ? 
 How do you decide how often these things need to be done ? 
 You did well on the math test . 
 Don ’ t you always fail in the math tests ? 
 Huh ? You mean you snuck a peek at his test ? 
 Are you crazy ? You were cheating . 
 Why do you say so ? 
 She has promised her mother that she would be with him through thick and thin . 
 Who's it knocking at the door ? 
 All right . I'll get it . 
 No , I'm Korean . Where are you from ? 
 I've already found a flat and it's quite comfortable . What about you ? 
 What do you think of the local accent here ? Has it been causing you any problems ? 
 I can't agree more . 
 I haven't heard anything . 
 Nobody told me . 
 I really wasn't told anything . 
 Wow , how exciting . 
 Of course I will . 
 I appreciate that . 
 So far it looks like we will be leaving two hours late , but keep checking the departing flights status board just in case . 
 I think you should stay in the airport . Even though the delay is expected to be two hours , the flight departure could be announced any minute . Who knows ? 
 It seems there are some loose bolts on one of the wings . It happens all the time . No need to worry . 
 What do you do in your spare time ? 
 What kinds of sports do you like ? 
 Who is your favorite author ? 
 Are you a music lover ? 
 What kinds of films do you enjoy ? 
 Hello , I brought a lap-top computer with me . Do you know how can I use the internet in my room ? 
 Thank you . I think I will go there . 
 Professor Donald , are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester ? 
 I wonder if I could enroll in it . I know it is a graduate course and I ' m a junior , but ... 
 I know , but the geology of the American west is my major interest and I have done a large reading in the field . 
 Oh , thanks , professor Donald . This is really very nice of you . 
 I'm sorry . Has it been bothering you ? 
 I'm sorry . I meant to ask you . 
 Silk market . 
 Yes , That ’ s right . 
 No . The things are too expensive there for me . I can't afford it . 
 Really ? That's wonderful . Can you wait a second ? I need to change . 
 I will . Do you think we can get something really nice and cheap ? I mean this is the last day . 
 Should we ask Cindy to come along ? She saw the evening gown made of silk last month that she wanted to buy very much . She didn't buy it of course . It would cost her three months ’ salary . 
 When ? 
 Oh ? Isn't that like her . 
 All right , all right . I am ready to go . Let's go ! 
 Did you bring your ticket ? 
 Did you bring your ID ? 
 You're going to need your ID to pay the ticket . 
 We have to know that this ticket is really yours . 
 Next time you come back , bring your ID . 
 Yes , everything will be cleared . 
 Anything wrong with it ? 
 Oh , I'm very sorry about that . You can change it for another one if you prefer . 
 This one is the same size and color . But the design is different . 
 Excuse me , sir . What kind of drink do you want ? 
 Yes , but you have to pay for it . 
 Wait a minute , I will bring you some juice . 
 Well , I wasn't planning on spending that much money today , so ... 
 Even if an item is on sale ? 
 Oh ! It's so cute ! 
 Yes ? 
 Why not ? 
 I'm sorry . I can't . What does the note say . 
 Sorry , I'm very near sighted . 
 Oh , yes . That is a beautiful color . It has been a very popular lipstick this season . I have just two left . 
 Have you heard about our special promotion this month ? If you purchase at least 200 yuan in any loreal products , you will receive this black hand bag with a sample of blusher , mascara and two shades of eye shadow . 
 I'd be glad to . Do you need anything else ? 
 This room is unacceptable . I want a new one , and I want a refund for tonight . 
 I'm being attacked by hordes of cockroaches ! 
 Thank you very much . This has been a most unsettling experience . 
 Bob , put on your shoes , your feet are really smelly . 
 But don't forget you are in a cafe . 
 I simply can't bear your barbaric behavior . 
 You should feel shameful for your behavior . 
 I'm really sick of you . 
 Oh , really ? No wonder that she looks quite depressed recently . 
 I heard they were just married for half a year . 
 Yeah . Mixed marriage is tempting but full of culture shock . 
 Maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married . 
 What a terrible house ! 
 The door bell doesn't work , the sink is leaking , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart ! 
 What a nice dress , Jean.You look marvelous ! 
 From the Crown's . Oh , what lovely earrings you have ! Are they diamond ? 
 Well , you are lucky to have such a considerate husband . Mine hasn't brought me a single rose since we married . 
 She's chic , isn't she ? 
 It makes me feel rather shabby . That woman has a good taste in dressing , I would say . 
 Most women follow fashion like sheep.They don't know any better than imitate . 
 The gown is quite expensive , believe me . 
 You know those upstarts . They're all show-offs ! I think I'd better have a diet ; otherwise I'd look like a ballon soon . 
 Thanks . I'm flattered . 
 What ’ s your attitude when do wrong things at work ? 
 David , do you think we are lucky to have the weekend ? 
 I agree with you . What do you want to do , except sleeping ? 
 I am better . I will go out to have a visit to my aunt . Why don't we have fun on weekend ? 
 Hello and welcome . How may I be of service ? 
 Yes , of course . What's the amount you'd like to change ? 
 Please fill out this exchange form and I'll need to see your passport . Don't forget to sign your name at the bottom .

 Yes , that can be done here . Just make sure you keep the exchange form and the receipt and you can come back at the end of your stay and we'll be only to happy to change it back into foreign currency .

 How many people are there in your family ? 
 That is a big family . How old is your sister ? 
 What about your brother ? 
 Do you miss your family ? 
 Do you often go home ? 
 How often do you write to them ? 
 What was your duty like in your previous job ? 
 Can you name a few examples ? 
 morning . Phyllis Seymour speaking . 
 Thank you very much , Mr . Parker . But , that is my job . 
 Did I do well on my test ? 
 Why wouldn't I want to know ? 
 Exactly what do you mean by bad ? 
 How'd I fail it ? 
 What did I do wrong ? 
 Thanks.Will I be able to take a retest ? 
 Have you gone to school today ? 
 I couldn't go to school today , I was sick . 
 Thank you very much , that's kind of you . 
 When you miss a day of school , I'll be happy to give you the English assignments . 
 Hey , Philip ! You won ’ t believe this ! 
 My son , Harvey just got into Harvard ! He starts next September . 
 I have finished filling in the forms . Can I go to my room now ? 
 Thank you . 
 Oh , Tom ! I thought you were in Paris . 
 Good to see you too ! 
 Sure . Our special wine today is a 1989 Chardonnay . 
 It's $ 4.25 cents by the glass . The whole bottle is $ 22.5 . 
 I'll need to see your ID please . 
 Sorry about the inconvenience , you look so young . I had make sure you are over 21 years old . 
 Yes , what kinds of wine do you have ? 
 Thank you . Please bring us a bottle of dry white wine . 
 Yes , such as Christmas and Easter . 
 Thanksgiving Day , Independence Day . 
 I've gotten a few parking tickets before . 
 Only about five or six . 
 Yes , I paid my fines . 
 If I remember correctly , it's about $ 130 . 
 I got one the other day . 
 I may just go to the DMV today , so I can pay the fine . 
 Sorry , Mr . Black . I ’ m trying to make them quiet . 
 Sorry , sir . Believe me , everything will be all right . 
 Those are beautiful . They smell lovely . Thank you . 
 Oh , sweet . You've always been my love too . 
 I'll do everything for you , love . You know that , maybe you didn't realize , but you made everyday a enjoys moment and happy occasion . 
 Come on . Don ’ t cheat on me . It ’ s a long shot . 
 Do you have the letter of approval of employment ? 
 In that case , you are not allowed to work in China , until you get the employment petition . 
 We ’ re asking for donations today . 
 We ’ re trying to raise money for the campaigns . 
 As much as possible . 
 We are going door to door . 
 What else can we do ? 
 I didn ’ t think of that . 
 It's time to go to bed . 
 I don't care , it's school in the morning . 
 Excuse me , Mr . White ? I just need you to sign these before I leave . 
 That ’ s my job , sir . Just one more signature here , please . 
 Hello ! You have reached the offices of Maddox and McKnight , can I help you ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry . Mr . Nelson is away at the moment . I'm sorry that you keep missing him while he is out of the office . Would you like to leave a message ? 
 Certainly . Mr . Nelson can not take your call at the moment because he is away . He stepped out of the office for the whole afternoon and is not expected back until tomorrow morning . His schedule is very unpredictable at times , so the best way to reach him is to first make an appointment by email or text messaging . 
 Of course , can you leave your name and number ? I'm sure Mr . Nelson will return your call as soon as he is able . 
 Can you tell me what it's about ? I can make a note of it , so Mr . Nelson is aware and prepared when he returns your call . 
 I hope we could offer the most favorable terms . 
 Good . Is there any commission included ? We are commission agents . 
 Ok . How about the earliest possible shipment ? 
 Could you make an offer on FOB basis ? 
 May I help you ? 
 Sure . How do you like your money ? 
 No problem . Here you are . 
 I hear you are planning to travel abroad . 
 In my opinion , there are several places you mustn't miss , like Washington D . C , Las Vegas , New York and Los Angeles . 
 Yes , you may consider those two places also . Seattle , for example , is worth visiting and there's a very famous museum called Museum of Flight . 
 Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do ! 
 I think someone is stalking me . 
 I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . 
 I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too . 
 Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me . 
 He followed me all the way home ! 
 Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ? 
 Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me ! 
 I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is . 
 Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile . 
 Yeah . I am on edge since she was out to the match . 
 I do have the confidence , but I still worry about her . 
 How could I help but follow it ? The fluctuation of dollar is killing my company ! The exchange rates are eating into our profits , and we can't do anything about it . 
 Every day I have less money ! I haven't spent anything , it is just melting away because of the shifts in exchange rate . 
 What about the Yen ? 
 Mary , be calm . 
 No , listen to me . I always regard you as my best friend . I admire you , and of course you've helped me so much . I should thank you . 
 No , listen to me . Perhaps it's my fault that I treat everybody so well . Maybe in other people's eyes , I want you to be my girl-friend . but ... but ... 
 OK ... OK ... Anyway . I will treat you as my best friend . I hope you can do the same . 
 Hello , Anna . Come in and sit down . 
 What's the matter ? 
 Do you often suffer from backache ? 
 When did it start ? 
 Well , go home and rest in bed for two days , then you'll feel better . 
 Yes , I'll give you some pills . Take one a time and three times a day , and come back in three days . If you don't feel ... 
 I hope you can help me . I've been told about something called ' Financing Link ' ? 
 Could you tell me more ? 
 So , I can choose exactly what services I require ? That's brilliant . Can I use the card if I'm overseas to withdraw my daily expenses ? 
 This is just what I've been looking for . Sign me up right away , please . 
 How long would I wait ? 
 Thank you . I hope to hear from you as soon as possible . 
 OK , good-bye . 
 Escrow involves a lot of paperwork , but I will explain all of the steps to you as we go along . 
 The only thing I will need to see is your driver ’ s license , as I will be notarizing these papers . 
 Don ’ t worry about how many papers there are . We are going to look at them one at a time . 
 Please get any outside help that you need in understanding your escrow documents . 
 At the close of escrow , the house will be yours ! 
 I really liked living in Australia . I was an international student and I studied education at the university of Sydney . And living in Sydney was fantasticbecuase I could go to the beach anytime I wanted and there was a great nightlife in Sydney . There are lots of great clubs . And people were very , very friendly and easy-going and I met a lot of international people in living Sydney . 
 I was there for almost a year . 
 And I travelled a little bit in Australia . I went up the east coast . Up to Frasier Island . Which is a world heritage site . And I saw dingo running along the beach and sharks in the water . We climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the ... , which is a but north . And the further north you go in Australia , the hotter it gets . So we were able to go swimming in the ocean and I went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause I didn't have a diving license , so I went on an introductory dive and I saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that I was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly . 
 Almost . 
 Exactly . 
 I'd like to go and live there for at least another year . Probably I'll go back to Sydney or maybe I'll go down to Melbourne because it's a really interesting cultural city . They have lot of museums and parks . 
 Women in particular . They are anxious to get rid of those thick and clumsy winter suits and put on their new fashionable spring dress . 
 That's true . In summer , the first place people want to go is a spacious room with air-conditioning or a quiet river or swimming pool . 
 In autumn , almost all fruits are ripe and all crops are waiting to be harvested . 
 Well , winter is a season for relaxation , do you agree with me ? 
 Maybe you are right . 
 Well , it's not how much , but what I'm going to buy that matters . I'm going ski shopping ! 
 No . The front seat folds down all the way so there's just enough space for the skis ... 
 Not unless you lose about 100 pounds ... 
 Excuse me . I ’ m a stranger here and lost my way . 
 Sure . Can I get to the central department stall this way ? 
 Is it far ? 
 And do you know where the national bank is ? 
 Thanks very much . 
 Thank you . I won ’ t miss it . 
 Hurry ! It is time for me to steal something . 
 I am stealing vegetables at the Happy Farm . 
 No , no . I mean stealing vegetables on Internet is very popular now . Many white collars join in this game and have a lot of fun by stealing others ' vegetables . 
 You got what I meant . Perhaps , what I steal are not vegetables , but loneliness . 
 I heard you're getting married , James . Congratulations ! 
 I'm looking forward to it . 
 Yes , it's nice and bright . 
 I hope so too . 
 It's usually a bit hotter than today . 
 It's pretty cold and it often snows . 
 Let's hear the weather report later . What's the weather like in your hometown ? 
 That's quite a lovely weather . 
 Have you ever seen a hurricane ? 
 Do they often happen in your country ? 
 Oh , it's time for the weather reporter . Let's turn on the TV . 
 I don't have any plans . 
 What is wrong with you ? 
 You can talk with him . 
 I'm Jack in Room 606 . Can you change the room for me ? It's too noisy . My friend was woken up several times by the noise from upstairs . He said it was too much for him . 
 Anyway , I'd like to change our room . 
 Is the girl in red your girlfriend ? 
 Who's she then ? 
 I have a problem with my credit card . 
 There is a charge on my card that I didn't make . 
 It's for a purse that cost $ 350 . 
 I can't even afford a purse that expensive . 
 I was at work , but the purchase was made at 3 
 OK.Do I have to pay for this charge ? 
 Well , Betty . Since you ’ Ve done well during the probation period , we decided to employ you formally . And now we need to sign the formal agreement . 
 Of course . If you have any questions , just bring them out . 
 Well , it ’ s like this , during your first year , you will enjoy this salary level , a year later , we ’ ll increase your salary by 20 % . 
 Yes , maybe the personnel department made some mistakes in making the agreement . Do you have any other questions ? 
 Yes , welcome to our company . I hope we can cooperate happily . 
 Sorry to bother you so early . There's another couple who wants to rent the apartment , but I thought I'd ask you first . 
 I thought so , by the looks on your faces when you left . So why don't you come to my apartment , and we'll settle all the details . 
 Great . See you then . 
 I live in the southern part of this city . I rent a house . 
 No , I don't . 
 That sounds like fun . What's the weather going to be like ? 
 Is it going to be perfect beach weather ? 
 Good . I hope it doesn't cool off this weekend . 
 But you know that California weather is really unpredictable . 
 I really wish the weather would just stay the same . 
 Yeah , that would make things a lot easier . 
 No . I immigrated here three years ago . 
 Yes , I love my new life . 
 Rice . 
 Because it's supposed to be good for you . 
 Steve , I was born ready ! I ’ m going to blow you guys off the treadmill today . 
 Let ’ s hit the whirlpool for a bit . It ’ ll help me loosen up . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Well , we have all kinds of sports shoes.Could you tell me what kind of sport you usually do ? 
 OK , then you can buy a pair of jogging shoes.Here are jogging shoes.Which pair do you like best ? 
 Here you are.You can try them on . 
 Excuse me . I'm afraid I got lost . Where am I on this map ? 
 Oh ! Can I go from here to the Zhongshan Park ? 
 Hello , sir . How many in your party ? 
 OK , a single fare is $ 50 per right . 
 No , it's not necessary . But you have to fill out this form . 
 Excuse me . Where is the way out ? 
 It's very confusing in here , isn't it ? 
 It should be the way out . 
 It's my first visit to Prague , I'll be here for three days for a conference , then I have a day on my own to do some sightseeing before I head back home . What do you suggest I see when I'm here ? 
 The subway ? But is there a subway station next to my hotel ? I have to go between the conference center and the hotel several times a day ... 
 Is it expensive to ride on the underground ? 
 Is it easy to get lost ? 
 We are happy to have you with us . When could you start working ? 
 What about Next Monday ? 
 This is our first day of class.It ' s better for us to introduce ourselves to each other . Who would like to begin first ? Any volunteers ? 
 Yes , please . 
 Steve , when are you going back to America ? 
 Wow , so soon ! I'm going to miss you . 
 What class are you trying to take ? 
 Well , there are only two classes open . 
 One class is on Tuesday and Thursday from 2 p . m . to 4 . 
 That class is from ten to twelve on Monday and Wednesday . 
 Yes , I am sure . 
 Very well then . 
 I'll see what I have . What do you need it for ? 
 You can use quarters , dimes and nickels . 
 I have just got lost with my friends . Would you please help me find them ? 
 Shone . And one of my friends ' name is Jessie . 
 Out of every movie that you've seen , which one is your favorite ? 
 You think so , how come ? 
 You're not lying , I found that movie absolutely hilarious . 
 I made sure to be in line to see it the first day it came out . 
 I was laughing hysterically the whole time ; my stomach muscles hurt afterwards . 
 I got the movie when it came out on DVD , do you want to come over ? 
 Would you like some coffee , Tom ? 
 Here's some sugar . 
 You have any ideas as to what you want to do this weekend ? 
 I'm not quite sure yet . 
 What movie are you and your friend planning on watching ? 
 No good movies come to mind . 
 No , thanks . Maybe another time . 
 What did you exactly do there ? 
 What do you think are the qualifications for being a doctor ? 
 Hey , how was the show ? 
 Really ? I heard it was supposed to be great . 
 What a pity you are leaving so soon . I wish you could stay a few more days . Sir , can you deliver a speech for us ? 
 Cheers ! And we are honored to have such an honored guest today . Mr . James , I hope we will meet somewhere in the near future . 
 Definitely ! Thank you ! 
 I'm not getting one . 
 It's cheaper if I don't buy one . 
 How do you figure that ? 
 Really ? 
 I like that . 
 I'm going to . 
 It's a little early for those , isn't it ? I still have eight months to go ... 
 I thought we could turn the upstairs study into a baby room . What do you think about lavender ? 
 What can I do for you ? 
 I see . The Fund Trading System of our Net Banking deals with both trading and information . If you use this system , you can subscribe for and apply to buy other funds . You can also get lots of other useful information .

 What size do you need ? 
 They're at the back of the stores , second shelf up on the right-hand side . 
 They're in the blue cupboard . Anything else ? 
 I ’ ll need to check . Sorry , we don ’ t have any in stock . But I can order some and send through the order today . How many do you need ? 
 Fine . They should be here the day after tomorrow . 
 Well . I like them a little heavier . I don't have as much control , usually bowling straight , but the extra momentum compensates for that . 
 Well done . You got them all . You get 10 points and your next two bowls are added to this frame's score . I'II dry my ball off and try to knock them all down as well . 
 I certainly can try ... No ! It went straight through the wickets . 
 Coming ! 
 I think it is unemployment that gives rise to such social problems . 
 You are right . 
 Certainly . What's your size ? 
 They are all leather . How do they feel ? 
 Are you sure that this bus will take us to Santa Anita mall ? 
 You know that for a fact ? 
 Is it a very long bus ride ? 
 Do you know where we get off at ? 
 Really , there's a bus stop right by the mall ? 
 That's convenient . 
 May I take your order ? 
 And what would you like after that ? 
 Welcome to the KFC Just-in-Time . Can I help you ? 
 Anything else , sir ? 
 What do you want for your drink ? 
 Your address , please . 
 Ok . got it.That ' ll be $ 6.50 . Thank you for your order.it will be there in 20 minutes . 
 Could you tell me something about your family ? 
 Are your brother and sister still in school ? 
 What does your father do ? 
 What about your mother ? 
 Are you married ? 
 Do you need to support your family ? 
 Have you finished school ? 
 What ’ re you doing now ? 
 You ’ re supposed to clean your teeth before you go to bed . 
 And don ’ t ever forget it . 
 Why ? We just got here . 
 12 
 Yes . 
 But why is it too late ? It's Saturday night.You have nothing to do tomorrow . Why not stay out and drink with us ? 
 Yes , I was . And I like living here.People know how to party here . In Taipei , some people know how to party.But here , everyone does . 
 They're smoking pot . Don't worry about it . 
 Yes , it is . 
 Don't worry about it . It is true that pot is illegal in America.But the laws aren't as strict as in Taiwan.If people are arrested , and they have a little pot in their possession , they don't go to jail . They just have to pay a fine . 
 Yes . 
 I tried it a couple times . But I don't like it . I like alcohol better.Don ' t worry about them , though . If you don't want to smoke pot , you don't have to . 
 That's alright . But you really should have another drink.People will probably start dancing soon . 
 You had two drinks at nine o'clock . C'mon , Ann , you are in an American university now ! You have to learn how to drink . 
 It is . We study hard all week.And then , on the weekend , we party hard . That's the best way to live . 
 Would you like to have dinner with me tonight ? 
 I ’ ll pick you up at ... say , seven thirty ? 
 See you tonight then . 
 Alice , your father is amazing . He ’ s 90 years old and he lives alone in that big house . 
 That sounds like my Grandmother . She was always stubbornly independent . 
 They see their independence as a kind of character strength . 
 Hey , what's up ? 
 I'm throwing a party on Friday . 
 You didn't ? 
 Did you want to go ? 
 At 8 
 I'd better see you there . 
 Good afternoon.British Airline.Is there any thing I can do for you ? 
 Sure . When do you want to take the plane ? 
 Will that be first class or economy seat ? 
 $ 200 . 
 What ’ s the matter , BOB ? 
 What happened ? 
 Can you stand ? 
 what I have to give you a hospital for an ex-treat . 
 It maybe worse than it seems . 
 It's clogged and water won't go down . 
 Well , I guess people who lived here before didn't clean the bathtub . 
 What should I do now ? 
 Ur , it stinks ! 
 I need some books on hardware . 
 Great ! They're the very books I want.May I borrow two books ? 
 I see.Thank you . 
 You have asked me several times about it . You are driving me up the wall . 
 Compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . And anyway , I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . It's all in the mind . 
 What's special about these things ? 
 Thanks . I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now . 
 No , thanks . I have had enough . 
 Please bring me a cup of coffee . 
 I need to return these books . 
 Here they are . 
 I forgot they were due . 
 How much is the late fee ? 
 So I have to pay 25 cents for each day the books are late ? 
 That ’ s a lot of money . 
 Yes . 
 About one day . It arrives in Dalian at 10:00 a . m . tomorrow . 
 Four ports . 
 Perhaps she makes about 25 knots an hour . 
 Yes . I hope it will remain fine all the way . 
 Oh , I ’ m afraid I can ’ t . I ’ Ve had a date already . 
 May be some other time . 
 I know this characteristic of him . So I never think seriously of his words . 
 It seems that you don't like him . 
 What kind of insurance could the company provide for its employees ? 
 What if an employee was injured due to work-related job ? 
 Did you hear about Lulu ? 
 She and Vic broke up and now she ’ s asked for a transfer . 
 No one really did . They were very discreet and professional at the office . 
 Have you got the latest ONXIU magazine ? 
 What a pity ! I missed it again . 
 Yes , please . 
 Thank you . What shall I do when I check out these books ? 
 Thank you so much . 
 Yes . 
 I have two kids . A boy and a girl . 
 Jack and Stephanie . 
 Stephanie is 18 and Jack is 24 . 
 Stephanie is . She goes to college in Washington and Jack works in Florida . 
 She studies English . 
 No , she's at school . 
 Do you think a private vehicle might be more to your liking ? 
 Even better than a private vehicle is a limo . How does that sound ? 
 A taxi it is . Where will you be headed ? 
 A taxi will be here in just a minute , sir . 
 The taxi will be ready when you are , sir . 
 Yes . It's a feast of eyes to walking in the museum . 
 What a shame that we can't take pictures . 
 Forgive you for what ? 
 No ! Are you kidding me ? 
 I can ’ t believe it ! I have all my important personal documents stored in that computer . It ’ s no laughing matter . 
 Well , you should be sorry ! Don ’ t ever use my computer again ! You can ’ t do anything now , it ’ s too late ! 
 I'm sorry , but everything is taken . 
 Yes , I can give you a reservation on that . 
 I haven ’ t been able to take a deep breath lately , and I need to know why . 
 No , I ’ Ve been feeling fairly good most of the time . It just is hard to breathe . 
 No one has ever checked me for allergies . 
 When the weather gets really cold , it gets worse . 
 Thank you for pursuing this . I appreciate your help . 
 She's at home . 
 August 1st . 
 Yes , we do.My parents prepare dinner for me . 
 We sing " Happy Birthday " at the party and have birthday cakes . 
 Well , I don't know . 
 So the " Happy Birthday " song has been popular since then ? 
 Hi , is that Li Ling ? 
 I am glad to inform you that you are expected to come for an interview in our head office tomorrow . 
 Yes , sure . It is No . 50 in the Fifth Avenue where there is a fairground and a museum . 
 I like spring best . It is neither too cold nor too hot . Freezing days make me lazy and stuffy days make me lazier . How about you ? 
 How do you get through the stuffy daytime ? 
 I ’ m ready to settle the bill . 
 Definitely ! Very relaxing . 
 What ? I only stayed three nights . 
 But your brochure said that this was a package deal and the hotel ’ s services were all-inclusive . 
 But why are you overcharging me almost a thousand dollars ? 250 dollars a night , times three nights should just be $ 750 . 
 Perhaps I could talk to your manager ? 
 Good morning , Mrs . Smith . 
 What kind of books does she like ? 
 Which type of telephone bill would you like to pay today ? 
 I'll need your Bank Card , please . Your Bank Book is required for over the counter services ; with the ATM you just need to have your card . 
 Well , that is easy ! It sure beats waiting in line for ages waiting to deal with a real person ! 
 No , thank you . I'm just looking . Maybe later I might need your help . 
 Oh , you do ? You certainly have a large selection . 
 But I see things rather differently.The heroin is not attractive and her acting is just so-so . 
 Hey , look , there is a circus show over there . 
 It's the circus . 
 Oh , come on , they give them treat too.Oh , look , that little monkey is so cute . 
 Oh , it is coming to us , come on , Ben , get a banana to it . 
 Why are you acting so strange today ? 
 That's weird ! 
 I like listening to different kinds of music . 
 I enjoy Rock and R & B . 
 I like the different instruments that they use . 
 Yeah , I think so too . 
 He was really influenced by the way they do things on the west coast . I guess the working atmosphere is a lot more relaxed and casual in California . It comes from the information technology industry .. there isn't such a large division between home and office , so people want to work in the clothes they feel more relaxed in . 
 It's not as bad as that ... We are allowed to wear more casual jackets and trousers . Besides , didn't you hear what Brian found on his desk this morning ? 
 Management decided to give him four brand new white shirts . That's their way of telling him that his new style of dressing down is not quite acceptable . 
 What's it like ? 
 And then ? 
 That's neat ! 
 It ’ s not very big . It ’ s a little over half a million square kilometers . 
 There are about 30 million people in my country . Most of them live in the north . 
 That ’ s the really hard to say . I think most people earn about two thousand dollars a month , if you convert the money from our currency into dollars . 
 I think we are richer than most countries , but not as rich as countries in western Europe . Our biggest problem at the moment is unemployment , which is roughly 8 % . It has doubled over the last four years . 
 Dick , I ’ Ve decided not to rent that house . 
 I ’ Ve changed my mind . 
 Well , I think maybe I should find a house that is closer to where I work . 
 I'm planning on going to the market soon . 
 I don't know what we need . 
 I'll make a list . 
 Okay , do we need any meat ? 
 What else do we need ? 
 I am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful . We just made a record sale this season . 
 It is not an easy job . How do you like the advertisement for the new product ? 
 Certainly . 
 Wait a moment , I want to go to the toilet . 
 What do you think this flat ? 
 Small ? But it should be enough for our needs , I think . 
 That's true , but I love the living room , it's huge and filled with sunshine . 
 It has a great balcony with an incredible view of the park . 
 May be we could get some new furniture , better stuff . 
 Excuse me . May I take you a picture ? 
 Thanks you . Shall we stand a bit further ? I would like to take the tower in . 
 That's OK . If you want the photo I will mail it to you . 
 Are you new here ? 
 Is this your first year in college ? 
 Which school ? 
 How do you like it here compared to PCC ? 
 Do you like it better here or at PCC ? 
 So , why did you leave PCC ? 
 What do you mean ? If he was a good programmer , he should have been raking it in . 
 Again ? 
 Ouch . 
 Quality is very important to us . We work to very low tolerance levels . We need to have guaranteed supplies of consistently high quality raw materials . Over the years we've built up very good relationships with our suppliers . 
 Yes . There are about fifty names on our approved supplier list , but for raw materials we tend to deal with three local companies . 
 Are you in a hurry ? 
 In that case , here , you go first . 
 Great . Thank you . 
 I need to cancel a check . 
 I accidentally wrote the check for too much . 
 The check was written for $ 150 . 
 I needed to write it for $ 100 . 
 Thank you so much . 
 Yeah , it helps keep me fit and helps the environment , too . 
 Right . Since my work is near a park , it ’ s a really nice ride , too . 
 Oh , about 10 miles . It takes me about an hour . 
 You ’ re doing your part for the environment by using public transportation , too . 
 See you . 
 It sure is . I'm glad it didn't rain . My name's Mike Gates , by the way . 
 I'm sorry . What's your name again ? 
 So Barb ... what do you do ? 
 Really ? Where ? 
 I'm an engineer at IBM . 
 Yeah . I like it . Hey , it looks like the food is ready . 
 Do you have a foreign tour ? 
 Sydney . 
 Well , the route 5 is really charming . Must I make a reservation ? 
 Which kind of sport do you like to watch ? 
 So you must like NBA game . 
 What kind of sport do you like to participate in ? 
 I prefer the indoor sports , such as bowling , badminton and squash . 
 How about playing tennis with me ? 
 What food do you fancy ? 
 How about going to Joe's Restaurant . 
 Excuse me , can you tell me where is the taxi stand ? 
 Are there any signs there ? 
 Thank you . 
 Tonight ? I'm afraid I can't . I've promised Mark to go to the gym . Can we make it tomorrow ? 
 All right . See you tomorrow night . 
 What seems to be the problem ? 
 Well , let me get that out of your way . Would you like to order something else from the menu ? Or I could bring you another order of chicken if you'd like . 
 Yes , we do . How would you like it cooked ? 
 Did you hear anything about the robbery ? 
 Really ? 
 What did you see ? 
 I can't believe it . 
 What happened next ? 
 Did he get caught ? 
 How many undergraduates are hired here each year ? 
 I see . What kind of backgrounds does the staff have ? 
 May I help you ? 
 Take the right road and walk ten minutes . You will see the Star Travel Agency . 
 Alright everyone settle down . Let ’ s get started.As you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . It is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . This brings me to our topic for today . Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ? 
 No , that ’ s May fifth in Spanish , James , no wonder you are failing my Spanish class . No , May first is International Workers ’ Day . 
 No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is . 
 In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement . Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect . 
 Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality . 
 Well , as we say , the rest is history ... 
 Hum , I think there's enough for one more , yes . 
 Nice to meet you , George . I'm Irene . 
 I'm in computing . I work for Macrohard . 
 What do you do ? 
 What would you want , coffee or tea ? 
 How do you like it ? 
 Hey Bobby . What's going on ? 
 I forgot my cigarette today . Do you have another one ? 
 Thanks . 
 Really ? I've been smoking for over a year now . 
 You ever tried to quit ? 
 Yeah . I tried to quit last month , and I thought it was going to be easy , but it turns out that I'm still smoking . 
 I think you're right . Aright . Gotta go to class . Thanks for the cigarette . I'll talk to you later . 
 So , Karen , what do you do in your free time ? 
 Really ? How long have you been playing piano ? 
 That ’ s really interesting . you have to play for me some time . 
 Well , I collect beer mats . I ’ m not sure that counts , though . 
 I'd like a beer . What kind of beer do you have ? 
 A draft beer please . 
 Could I have some fruit ? 
 I plan to add an introductory letter behind the resume to increase the probabilities of success in the interview . 
 I'm not sure of that . Do you know ? 
 Yes , I think so , too . I must introduce myself in truth . 
 So I should write my strengths in the introductory letter , especially those related to the work . 
 You are very nice to tell me those . 
 Thank you ! 
 It's a job I've been dreaming of since I was very little . I firmly believe that teaching is one of the most honorable jobs in the world . 
 I want to work in the English Department , as I am an English major . 
 Take care , sonny ! 
 Bye ! 
 How long would you like to keep it ? 
 Yes , that'd be all right . 
 I have some I can bring from our place , and there ’ s some more out at my parents ’ . 
 Yeah . I have one from college at my parents ' house . 
 Sure , but I don ’ t have hot water , yet . 
 No , they ’ re coming tomorrow morning to turn the gas on . My phone should be working then , too . 
 Yeah , I can ’ t cook anything until tomorrow , anyway . 
 He always wears an extremely becoming suit with tie . 
 A light brown suit and a pink tie today , and a light blue shirt and a blue tie yesterday . A perfect match ! 
 Match is important ; well , the way of tying is also important . 
 My father wears a tie every day , but he can ’ t do it himself . My mother helps him with his tie every morning . 
 Finally we have a long holiday . 
 Good idea . Where shall we go ? 
 Great . Shall we go alone or as part of the group ? 
 why are you in such a good mood today ? 
 I didn't know you were scared of heights ! Was it really bad ? 
 so what did you do about it yesterday ? 
 you're kidding me ! that sounds really scary ! 
 weren't you scared ? 
 so have you cured your fear of heights ? 
 I'm impressed . 
 well , sometimes I get scared when I'm in my apartment all by myself . 
 I always worry that the door is unlocked or that a window is open and that a stranger will come in and steal my things . 
 Have you ever thought of going to Africa ? 
 Would you like to go with me ? 
 Pretty ! Say beautiful rather . Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than she altogether-face and figure ? 
 Such an eye ! The true hazel eye-and so brilliant ! Regular features , open countenance , with a complexion , Oh ! What a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure ! There is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance . One hears sometimes of a child being ' the picture of health ' ; now , she always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health . She is loveliness itself . 
 There is about a 15 - minute wait . 
 OK . Give me your address . 
 Oh , not too bad , but I've got to stay in bed . 
 Ok , I will . You have said that many times . 
 No , there ’ s no need . Thank you all the same . 
 I suppose I do . 
 They use said it 
 It sure is 
 Well , if you live in other as long enough you love them just as much . 
 That's for sure . 
 Do you want to go get something to drink ? 
 What did you want to drink ? 
 Do you know that soda doesn't quench your thirst ? 
 Soda is really bad for you . 
 You're supposed to drink water when you're dehydrated . 
 That's what will keep you from being thirsty . 
 I need to get a Letter of Credit . Is this the right window ? 
 Yes , right here in my brief case . Just a moment , please . 
 That's done . There is more than enough to cover the contract amount in our account . 
 Please excuse me , but I really have to be going . 
 It was nice to see you , too.And please give my regards to Mrs.Robbins . 
 Bargain ? I'd feel way too guilty . 
 From a sweet ma ? ! It's not worth it . Plus , I'd happily pay more for these things I bought ! 
 Ha ! I'm just warming up ! Please take me there now ! 
 Very likely . You have a slight fever . Do you have a headache , too ? 
 Well , you have to let your flu run its course . You must stop working and stay in bed to get plenty of rest . Usually it will take 4 to 6 days to make a full recovery . 
 Maybe you'll have to cancel it or postpone it . If you go out while you are sick , it won't help you recover . You may even pass your disease on to others . 
 I'm on my way . 
 It's rather an unusual case . Have you found the cause of leaking ? 
 It appears to be the only case to us , that the goods have been damaged on the way . 
 Could you offer us a certificate issued by your Health Department ? 
 Now we are prepared to settle the issue with you amicably . 
 Go right ahead . 
 I majored in international banking at college so I took many insurance courses . And I worked at an insurance company for my graduation field work . 
 I care about people and I know the importance of insurance . 
 Yes , I do . I have worked as a salesman for P & G Company Ltd . 
 Yes , I'm good with people . 
 Give it to me . 
 It ’ s my acceptance letter from UCLA . 
 I ’ Ve been accepted ! 
 I ’ m serious . 
 NYU was my first choice , but UCLA is just fine . 
 Thanks . I ’ m proud of myself , too . 
 No , I am the only child in my family . 
 Do they live with you and your parents ? 
 I have applied for a transfer . 
 Yes . I think it's time to move on . I ’ Ve already been here too long . 
 Well , I want to be transferred to the Shanghai office . 
 Thanks . It's been a pleasure working with you . 
 So soon ? 
 OK ! Hurry , then ! Here's my cup . I can't wait for step four ! 
 Yes , there is , drinking your coffee ! 
 Having a good diet is probably the most important thing . 
 You need plenty of fruits and vegetables , small amounts of protein , and whole grains . 
 You shouldn ’ t consume too much sugar or caffeine . Also , watch your intake of fatty food . 
 You need to stop smoking , and make sure that you get 30 minutes of exercise every day . 
 As long as you don ’ t overdo it , a glass of wine a day should be OK . 
 Really ? Why ? 
 Really ? I am surprised . He doesn't look like a guy who'd ever cheat on his wife , does he ? 
 Well , I am really surprised . By the way , have you done anything behind my back ? 
 I like that joke , but I hope it's true . 
 Ok ! You know you're always welcome here . Did you enjoy your stay ? 
 It's our pleasure . And is there anything else we can do for you before you leave here ? 
 Don't mention it . Oh , This is a small gift for you . 
 We hope you could visit our company again . 
 Ok ! We'll definitely go to visit your company . 
 Didn ’ t you sleep well last night ? 
 Don ’ t worry . It ’ s only a cold . 
 You remember me ! Yes , I'm with Li Wang Enterprises ; I'm the Accountant Peters . 
 Well , we've just acquired a new business so we need to set up a lot of services with you . We are particularly interested in Agent Services . 
 Open the book and turn to page 10 . 
 No , honey , it's easy if you know the way . 
 No , honey , try to make notes in your notebook . 
 I ’ m returning these books . 
 Here are all of them . 
 I didn ’ t have time to return them . 
 How much ? 
 25 cents a day ? 
 That ’ s expensive . 
 It's OK . 
 I observed the interviewer's manner , mien and gesture carefully besides paying attention to mine . 
 Of course . The manner of shaking hands can show a man ’ s character . For example , the interviewer who shakes your hand lightly , is a easygoing man although he looks cool . 
 You can discover interviewer's eyes because they can show his thoughts , and can judge whether he is interested in your words by his gesture and mien . 
 I'd like to choose one game for myself and one for my younger sister . 
 Big games of course . 
 Type ? I don't know , what do you have ? 
 Well , I am a beginner . I ... 
 I like first person shooting and action more than other types of games . 
 Oh , thanks a lot . Then , I will take the two . 
 I will have the latest editions . 
 If you want to order meals , call 8801.If you need other help , call 8803 and someone will be there . 
 Yes , you can take your letters to the counter over there . 
 I've always liked to draw and paint . 
 I do it every once in a while . 
 I first learned how to do it in high school . 
 That was my favorite class . 
 Thanks . 
 You have a talent . You just don't know what it is yet . 
 Oh , it was okay . I had my meeting with Mitch this morning and his bottom line is that he thinks I need to show more initiative . He thinks that I need to start being more creative . 
 Well , not in so many words . But I know that productivity is a big issue for him . Oh , he said the usual things like “ Keep up the good work ” and “ Thanks for your hard work , ” but he also said that he's thinking about bringing some employees into my department . That , to me , means he's not satisfied with what I've been doing . 
 No , I Don't . Either I shape up or my job is on the line . 
 Do you really think so ? 
 Maybe you're right . Thanks , Don . I feel better . 
 Hello , this is Mike , Kara . 
 Everything is fine , and how are you ? 
 Kara , I had fun the other night at the movies and was wondering if you would like to go out again this Friday . 
 Maybe we could just meet for coffee or something . 
 I'm told Cold Blood just finished its last cut . 
 Sure , it'll be on next Monday . 
 Oh , Dad . Do I have to get up right now ? 
 Why didn't my alarm go off today ? 
 I must have slept right through it . 
 OK . I know . 
 Well , I can't give you a better warranty , if you would be willing to agree to an annual contract . 
 Yes , our delivery fee could be waived , if you make an order of 50 units or more . We would have to insist on the annual contract , however . I understand it's not the most convenient for you . Perhaps we could shorten it to a sixth month contract if you are willing to take a lower rebate . 
 excuse me ; is this seat taken ? 
 thank you very much . My name is Ashlan . It's nice to meet you . 
 the weather is so warm for December , don't you think ? 
 global warming is wreaking havoc everywhere . 
 no . I'm new here . I just moved here a few months ago . 
 I'm from China . What about you ? 
 did you enjoy it ? 
 it's very different from Chinese food , but I am getting used to it . 
 yes , have you read it ? 
 well , to be honest , I've only gotten though 10 pages of it . So far , though , it's interesting . 
 likewise . Bye ! 
 Are you a full-time student or do you attend part-time in the evenings ? 
 Will you be riding a motorcycle or do you drive a car ? 
 That permit will run twenty-five dollars ; will that be cash or credit card ? 
 Do you need a second permit for a car ? 
 Fine , here it is and have a great semester ! 
 That apartment never had any problems before . Are you sure the problem isn ’ t you ? 
 Where do you think you have problems ? 
 You know , no one else who has been in that apartment has had a problem before . 
 I will fix these problems when I get around to it . 
 You can ’ t do that ! It ’ s illegal ! 
 Anything you would like to know ? 
 We expect the usher girl to be good-looking , no less than 165 centimeters high , and love smiling . 
 Hello , Hong Lei . My name's Ricky . 
 Yes , I had my first lesson this morning . Are you a new student too ? 
 Six months . That's a long time . 
 Intermediate Three . And what about you ? 
 I can't remember her name , but she's got curly red hair . 
 Yes , I think so . 
 Yes that's right . Do you know her ? Is she your teacher too ? 
 Only a week . 
 Well , I'm staying at the YMCA at the moment . I'm looking for somewhere more permanent . Do you know of any good places ? 
 That would be great ! Thanks for your help . Can I buy you coffee ? 
 Hello . I'm here today to pay in some foreign currency . Is that possible at this counter ? 
 10,000 Japanese yen . 
 Fixed . 
 For one year , that's what I usually do . Better interest , you know . 
 Do you have an add sheet for me to sign ? 
 When you get the signed add slip , you must take it to the Admissions and Records Office or you will not be added . Can you find the office ? 
 Across the courtyard on the right is the office . Follow the signs to the correct line . Is that clear ? 
 You can't miss it . Add the class and then come back . We'll check later to make sure you are on the roll sheet . 
 Do the same thing with a drop slip if you ever need to drop a class . Good luck ! 
 I'd like to get this prescription filled . 
 Thanks . Do you sell aspirin here ? 
 Oh , I see it . Do you have multi-vitamins ? 
 ( The customer gets the aspirin and vitamins . ) That'll be $ 16.00 . 
 Here's your change . Thank you . 
 It really is . 
 Hopefully it will . 
 I like how clear the sky gets after it rains . 
 I especially love the night air when it rains . 
 The stars look so much closer after it rains . 
 Yeah , so do I . 
 Yes , I'd like to book a table for four at seven this evening . 
 Yes . Mike Lee . And put me as close as possible to the stage , please . 
 I think a surprise party may be better . But I forget when her birthday is . 
 Sorry . What shall we get for her ? 
 Good idea . Shall we search on line to find an appropriate one or go to a phone store ? 
 Sure . Okay , here is the website . 
 Probably . People's consumptive habit is changing rapidly because of the internet . 
 The computer went frozen . 
 Could I be of any help to you ? 
 Do you like miniskirt ? It's popular among young girls . The pleated skirt also sells well . 
 What about the divided skirt ? 
 What does your job involve ? 
 Has everything been OK with you lately ? 
 Have you been too busy to get enough sleep ? 
 How late do you try to go to sleep ? 
 Has anything in your day-to-day life been bothering you lately ? 
 You might consider listening to relaxing music as you go to sleep to clear your head . 
 I'm getting a tattoo tomorrow . 
 Tom , I've got good news for you . 
 Haven't you heard that your novel has won The Nobel Prize ? 
 You did a good job . I'm extremely proud of you . 
 You certainly deserve it . Let's celebrate ! 
 Just watching some TV . 
 Not really . Just watching the sports highlight on ESPN . 
 Just killing time until I find something to do . What are you going to do ? 
 You wanna shoot some hoops ? 
 Where's your girlfriend ? I thought you were going out with her today . 
 Let's go to Starbucks and think of something to do then . 
 I only have a couple left . Why don't you pick some up on the way . 
 Aright . See you there . 
 Yes . And they don ’ t give you very much either . I ’ m still hungry . 
 Don ’ t do this ! Don ’ t do that ! You mustn ’ t do this ! You can ’ t do that ! 
 And we ’ ll all help you . 
 Um yes . I'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni , olives , and extra cheese . 
 Sure , that sounds good . 
 No , make the second one with ham , pineapple and green peppers . Oh , and make it thin crust . 
 Perfect . Thank you . Bye .. 
 I think Yoga might be suitable for me . 
 Because it doesn't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up . 
 I don't know . I just need to try it once . I'm in urgent need of some exercise to lose some weight . 
 I'm looking for a good multivitamin . Can you recommend one ? 
 I knew there would be a few choices , but this selection is huge ! 
 That's right . Just a simple multi-vitamin that I can take every day . 
 Oh ! You took the guesswork right out of that one . 
 I ’ Ve been having problems getting onto the Internet . 
 Yes , they're fine . I suppose.the server might be down again . 
 Welcome to the National Post . How may I help you ? 
 Very well . You will need some stamps for the postcards and I need to weigh that package . 
 Well , it depends . Do you want to send it via priority , express or standard mail ? 
 Well , standard mail can take up to fifteen working days . Priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days . Express is the fastest , but it ’ s also the most expensive . It only takes three days and you can track your package online . 
 Good afternoon , Lexington Software . Angelina Dawson , how can I help ? 
 Ah , hello Quinn . Oh dear , you are calling to tell me there is a problem , aren't you ? 
 Hmm ... well , it was my first attempt ! Is it a very big mistake , or can we just alter it ? 
 What do you recommend we do ? 
 I trust your judgement . Thank you , Quinn . I'll be back tomorrow with a new set . Bye for now . 
 Yes , I would like a roast duck and my friend wants steaks . 
 I'd like it medium-well . 
 What can I do for you , young man ? 
 What sizes do you need ? 
 Here you are . And here are three crash helmets . 
 Well , there are a lot to do , but nothing to worry about . First , make sure they don't go far from the railings . 
 That's a good idea . And remind them to be slow at the beginning , not to run into the railings . 
 Never go to the center of the lake . The ice there is too thin to skate on . 
 sorry , Brad . But you are going to have to re-do this . 
 It ’ s badly organized . I can ’ t present this to the board . 
 I call this meeting to order . Thank you all in attendance today , I know it's a busy day for you all . We have a lot of material to cover today . Did everyone get an agenda ? 
 We should be able to finish everything up before then . Let's run through the major points first , and see where we're at . The first matter of business is to approve the minutes of our last meeting . 
 Good . Do I have a second ? 
 motion carried . Now , next on our agenda is our budget review . Margaret , can you please fill us in on where the budget review stands ? 
 What kind of action is required ? 
 Mr . Division , I am so sorry to have kept you waiting . 
 Oh dear , I forgot to bring it . 
 Good evening , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 Well , we have baby-sitting service . We will take good care of your baby . 
 Please fill out the table . 
 Congratulations ! This is your first interview ever . 
 sure , you should prepare so that you can give proper response when you're being interviewed . 
 you should collect as much information about the company and the position you're applying for as you can . It is important to show that you've done some research into the company . The interviewers Wil 
 smile at the interviewers and look them in their eyes while trying to persuade them to select you . Try to act natural , let your personality , ability and interpersonal skills shine through the interview 
 yeah , wear formal clothes to your interview and do be punctual . That'll leave your interviewers with a good first impression . 
 No , he is at work now . 
 Sure . It's 289,1234 . 
 I love all the fashionable things . But my favorite brand is Chanel . 
 Yeah . Each style is specially designed by world's top designers . So they can always make you look amazing . 
 Not really , especially at the beginning , if you wear high heels all day long , your feet would hurt . But , no big deal . Women can always get used to that . 
 Sure . But everyone loves to be beautiful . Hey , do you think this pair of sunglasses matches the handbag well ? 
 Come on . Fashion is not only for women . Men also share the equal right to chase fashion . It's the new fashion for men to wear perfumes , which is called cologne . 
 It takes time for that . But people's consuming attitudes are changing quickly . 
 No . Fashion is just part of my life , which improves its quality . But also , I'm good at financing . I have a credit card , but I never overdraft . 
 I have to say that's just the result of difference of our consumptive habits . 
 If that's the case , there's not much point in further discussion . We might as well call the whole deal off . 
 I think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price . How about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded ? 
 Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we can accept . When I suggested we meet each other half way , I meant it literally . 
 What would you suggest ? 
 That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars to be covered . Let's meet each other half way once more , then the gap will be closed and our business completed . 
 I'm glad we've come to an agreement on price . We'll go on to the other terms and conditions at our next meeting . 
 What is it ? 
 Yes , they're right . In fact , we have either restored or adopted international practices in our foreign trade . 
 Basically speaking , yes , we welcome the establishment of repry - tentative offices by foreign companies in Washington D . C . Of course , there are more details to be attended to . We cannot settle it in a few words . 
 How about tomorrow morning at 9 ? 
 Mark , you are not telling me the truth . Now why ? 
 Yes , all right . So why ? Go on then . Say it . Oh , really , Mark . I promise I'm not going to be angry . Now why were you late ? 
 You forgot ? You ... 
 Have you run into your cousin Jimmy lately ? 
 How's he doing ? 
 He did ? That's too bad ! 
 Next time you see him , please tell him I'm thinking of him . 
 You must know you've been scheduled to have an operation the day after 
 The operation starts at 10 0 ' clock . But you'll get an injection of anaesthesia about 30 to 45 minutes in advance . If your family comes to see you before the operation , they should come before 8: 30 . 
 It's nothing . Did your doctor explain to you about what operation you are going to have ? 
 OK . Have you signed the consent ? 
 Can I try this lipstick ? 
 Well , I don't quite like the smell . 
 I like the color . 
 Oh , that must be me ! Probably they typed the name wrong.My husband's English isn't so good . 
 It's okay . It's probably my husband's fault.Is there a pool in this hotel ? 
 Good . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes . 
 Well . Obviously , you won ’ t want All Risks cover . 
 Because they aren ’ t delicate goods and won ’ t likely be damaged on the voyage . FPA will be good enough . 
 That's right . On the other hand , a WA policy covers you against partial loss in all cases . 
 Oh , lots of them . For instance , War Risks , TEND and SICC . 
 Are you going to make an offer today ? 
 Ok , I'll get this rate right away . 
 Good morning , Mr Wang . 
 It's just nine o'clock . 
 Yes , you're on time . Are you often late ? 
 You must leave home earlier today . 
 Why are you so early today ? 
 Hi Amy , you look very happy . 
 Wow . You must be very excited . 
 Shall we go to a restaurant to celebrate ? 
 Me too . I feel very thirsty as well . 
 Professor , I'm concerned about my grades . Do you have a minute ? 
 I want to know if I am doing OK . 
 I am afraid that I might not be doing all that well . 
 I think I could take better notes and read a little more . 
 I'm working on it ! 
 Hello . I'd like to change my reservation for March 19 . My name is Mary Chang . 
 Well , I'd like to change the date to March 20 , and make that for two singles , not one . 
 How large is the plant ? 
 It ’ s much larger than I expected . When was the plant set up ? 
 Congratulations ! 
 How many employees do you have in this plant ? 
 Does the plant work with everything from the raw material to the finished product ? 
 That ’ s fine . 
 It's just around the corner . 
 God ! Don't you think they should get you an assistant ? 
 They're really running you into the ground . Why don't you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and have a good rest . 
 You'd better pay more attention to your health . 
 You're welcome . 
 Honey , we're in the museum now . We're not here to discuss your coworker's love life . We're here to enjoy the great paintings by Picasso ! 
 You're making a federal case out of it . One unhealthy love affair can't ruin anything . It could even make your life more interesting . 
 All I'm trying to say is that life is ... like ... er ... this painting . 
 Nine total . Seven children and my parents . 
 Well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . My father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it . 
 It can be hard , and there are certain sacrifices you have to make . 
 That's one . Another is the lack of personal property . Everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . Especially clothes . Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs . 
 Same problem here . There's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family . The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college . 
 Yes , I am . I'm very interested in that advertisement about hiring a computer program designer , and hope to know a little more about it . 
 Well , first I would like to know if this position is still available . 
 Terrific ! Then how should I apply for ? 
 Thank you very much . Bye-bye . 
 First , she needs to be hard-working . Second , she has to be able to do a lot ot things on her own initiative . 
 Great . We will give you a chance to have an interview in our company . 
 Good afternoon , sir . Welcome to our hotel.What kind of room would you like , sir ? 
 Can I help you , Madam ? 
 How much would you like to exchange ? 
 It's US 100 for RIB 802 today . 
 Fill out this exchange memo , please . 
 Wait a second , please ... These are 24,060 RIB and the receipt , please check them . 
 Good-bye . 
 Of course . When would you like the call ? 
 No problem . We'll give you both calls . 
 No problem . Anything else , sir ? 
 Let me know if you do need anything . 
 Hey , that coffee shop's lights are still on . 
 I would love a really sticky cinnamon bun . 
 Mmmm . That sounds like something I had in Mexico once . 
 Ohhhhh ! And I just got all my juices going ! 
 Yes , I want to deposit 1000 Yuan in my bank account . 
 OK ... Here you are . Any problem on that ? 
 Yes , I do . Here it is , and the cash . 
 Sure . 
 Yes . Can you tell me what the interest rate is now ? 
 Thanks . 
 Never mind . 
 It doesn't matter . 
 Oh , it's nothing . 
 Not a bit of it , don't blame yourself . 
 You ’ Ve been using it for two weeks without paying . 
 hi , Betty.what ' s up ? 
 everything has been fine for the past several months . 
 well , I wish someone could talk to me about Western table manners 
 as you know , table manners in China are quite different from those of Westerners . 
 for example , in China , it's okay to talk while eating . However , you may regard it as rude . 
 can you think of anything else ? 
 I didn't know that before . 
 i got it . i'll bear it in mind . 
 I hope so . 
 Many thanks for your presence . 
 No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill . 
 The service this evening has kind of sucked . Is that our server over there ? 
 Good . I'll just stay here until you get back . 
 How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves ? 
 I kind of feel the same way , but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight . 
 $ 3.60 will be the right amount for the tip . 
 Do you know what the weather will be tomorrow ? We are planning to climb the mountain . 
 I hope so . Thank you . 
 Is this the accounting department ? 
 Thanks . I appreciate that . 
 Great , thanks . 
 I would actually like to view the apartment for rent today . 
 Why not ? 
 Oh , okay . Can I do that right now ? 
 Is 6 o ’ clock Friday evening okay ? 
 Thank you very much . See you then . 
 I have to run to the grocery store . 
 Yes , but I am out of food and milk . 
 The small one , just down the street . I like their generic brand . 
 I hear they have very nice stuff . 
 Well , you should try my store . The prices are good . 
 Daniel , have you ever heard about the wildlife sanctuary ? 
 Yes , of course . 
 There are a lot of wild animals in that place , and also some special rules while visiting . 
 There , you only have two ways for visiting . 
 On their bus or in your own cars , and you won't be allowed to get off the bus until you reach the special region . 
 Because it is dangerous to get out of the car or bus . You can just imagine how fierce the wild animals can be . 
 Yes . 
 Yeah , sure , you won't be disappointed . 
 Hello . Is Steve there ? 
 What time will he be back ? 
 This afternoon ? 
 This is his friend , Greg . 
 Thanks . 
 Yeah , I want my own house very much , so I decide to buy one . 
 Yeah . This is a big house with a garden . I like it very much . 
 It is very quiet and peaceful . This is what I want . 
 Perfect.Couldn ' t be better ! 
 It's just what I wanted . 
 I'm really pleased with it.Thanks . 
 It's super . 
 What do you think of the pamphlets with beautiful pictures ? 
 I'll buy an electric map of the city . 
 No comment . 
 I think so . Maybe that ’ s why it ’ s cheap here . 
 Yes , you can . Please put your articles in this envelope and seal it . 
 How long would you like us to keep it ? 
 All right , ma'am . 
 He is a teacher , but he makes a little money on the side by repairing cars in his free time . 
 Believe me , he is the first-class . 
 I'm sure you'll soon begin to like it.It ' s such an interesting subject . 
 I've got a reservation here . My name is John Sandals . 
 One second , please , while I dig it out . Here . 
 Yes , I do . Do you accept American Express ? 
 That's okay , I've got plenty of cards . Here's my VISA . 
 Yes , that's just what I wanted . 
 There's just one catch . Zina asked me to let you know . 
 She promised that we'd be ready to start tracking the Stars.com web site by the end of next week . 
 Yes , I think she is just a little bit crazy . 
 Hi , I ’ m testify chen , the tour guide for the Ged Agency . We have a reservation of twenty room for tonight . 
 No . Our check out time is still be eight thirty tomorrow . 
 That ’ s alright . 
 Thank you . 
 Where is the shelf of best-sellers ? 
 Could you give me some advice on books for killing time on the train ? 
 Yes , very much . Which one is the latest ? 
 Thank you for your help . 
 Hello , Catherine . Would you like to go out tomorrow ? 
 Yeah , I was thinking we could get a bite to eat and catch a movie . 
 Yes . We can do something else if you like . 
 Well . What time would you like me to pick you up ? 
 Good . I will see you then . 
 Bye . 
 Why , what's the lowdown ? 
 I have no idea there was that great of deviation between the two venues ... To make our products sell , we have to take the target audience into account . 
 Welcome to IBA Consumer Credit . What can I assist you with ? 
 That's a problem facing many young families nowadays , and we are sympathetic to the problem . That's why we have just started a new scheme ; a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan . 
 What we usually do is find a suitable car dealer for you , who offer the type of car that you need . If it's a family car that you want , we have a very reliable dealer already contracted to us . 
 Yes . When you have decided exactly what you want and have a purchase price we can begin to process the loan . As long as you provide the proper documentation , of course . 
 A correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment . 
 Help me organize these coins . 
 Yeah , I'm gonna go to the bank and change it for bills , but first I have to separate them into little piles . 
 Great , then we can add everything up and take it to the bank . 
 Oh yeah , those are from my trip to London . I have a couple of different pence , but in all it won't add up to one pound . 
 Hopefully ! 
 Sure , what time ? 
 For how many people ? 
 Western food or Chinese food ? 
 Do you want an expensive meal ? 
 How much would you like to spend for each person ?

 Anything you'd rather not have ? 
 How about drinks ? 
 Well . Dinner for ten at sixty Yuan a plate , drink's extra , at 8 o'clock tomorrow evening . Is that all right ? 
 My pleasure , see you tomorrow evening .

 Do you have another card ? 
 Maybe you can just pay in cash ? 
 I guess you won ’ t be able to purchase these items today .

 what's wrong ? 
 Are you using dial-up or broadband ? 
 In that case , you need to turn on your airport .

 I'm afraid you'll need to have your visa extended before we can have you check in . 
 Hi , Monica , I am afraid I can ’ t make it to the office to punch out .

 What type of girl is she ? 
 Oh , that's great . You're serious this time . 
 Hi , Lucy , are you free to talk ? 
 Sure , speak to you later . It isn ’ t urgent . Maybe it is easier if I send you an e-mail . 
 You are still a student ? 
 Are you sure you can be a successful cashier ?

 Good . I think you'll make a good cashier . 
 Today I want to invite you to talk about insurance you ’ re interested in .

 Yes , all the insurance will be linked with your work . We will issue an insurance policy . 
 I could meet with you tomorrow anywhere from two until four ; what time works out best ? 
 I am glad that that works out ; can you find my office ? 
 Just follow the walkway to the outside and climb the stairs to the third floor . 
 If you do get lost , just ask someone in the building to point the way . 
 If you need to cancel your appointment , please give me a call ! 
 Wow . You are a real snake . 
 I know , I know . Kill , or die , right ? 
 I really feel sorry for that rhumba boy if he ever identifies himself . 
 Oh , please ! Don't be so old-fashioned ! It's totally safe . 
 All I did so far was make a bid on the Buddha . It was easy ! 
 Oh , come on ! I just gave them my e-mail , my address and my phone number . And my name , of course . 
 I can ’ t just now , Susan . Could we get together this afternoon ? What ’ s it about ? 
 Oh , that ’ s right . Is that time of the year , huh ? That ’ s fine . How about if we meet at 3:30 this afternoon ? 
 Tell me what the problem is . 
 Do you have some quarters ? 
 The washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar . 
 The quarters go into the slot . You have to push the slot in , and the machine will turn on . 
 That's all there is . 
 If you need anything else , just let me know . 
 What is the problem ? 
 It is ok . You look really pale and red eyes . I suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest . 
 Oh ... I am really worried about the exam . I have no idea what will be on it . 
 Yes , but my notes are all nonsense . I can't figure out what is important . 
 Yes . 
 What do you mean ? You think I don't write enough . 
 I know , but I listened . 
 I suppose you're right . But what can I do ? I don't know what to write down . 
 That would really help me , Sue . I appreciate it . All this makes me feel like an idiot . 
 Alright . University and high school seem very different to me . I suppose I just need to learn how to manage lecture classes . Then I will do better . 
 Like wise . Take a seat , please . How about a cup of tea ? 
 Yes , it's not too bad . Our sales are going up year after year . And we still have a large potential production capacity . 
 That's a good idea . So far , we have several agents abroad . 
 That sounds good . 
 Usually , we give a commission of 4 % to our agents . 
 Don't worry . We'll allow you a higher commission rate if your sales score a substantial increase . 
 It sounds OK . Then how do you pay the commission ? 
 All right . If it's okay , we would like to sign an agency agreement with you immediately . 
 Thank you for your help . 
 Really ? It almost looks brand new . And the color designs are so retro . 
 No way ! My parents used to hang out at those places . 
 How did you get it ? 
 I'm looking for an MP - 3 player . Which brand is of the highest quality ? 
 Which model is the best-seller ? 
 May I have a look at it ? 
 Do you have this model in white ? 
 Then I'll take the yellow one . 
 Okay . 
 I would like to go to Europe for a visit ? Can you recommend me an interesting city ? 
 Do you have a package tour to Paris ? 
 Hi , Tom ! This is Marry with Hans furniture store . 
 I just wanted to let you to know that we had decided to offer the sales position to someone else . 
 We considered you very carefully but the other candidate has more experience . 
 I'm sure you are . 
 What's wrong , Frank ? 
 Cheer up ! It's not the end of the world . 
 It's nice , but it doesn't match the color of our room . 
 Oh no , this type gets dirty very easily and it's difficult to clean . 
 Look , this one matches our room and it's inexpensive . 
 Another glass of beer , will you ? 
 At least one for your trip . 
 What are you doing ? Checking the " to do " list for the wedding ? 
 So let's start by checking off what we've already done . 
 Not yet , I was busy getting that videographer who films stuff for the Net . 
 Hey ! We're paying for his ticket ! 
 I like him very much . He ’ s a gay dog . 
 I am all set . He can come anytime . 
 Not really . It's much warmer usually . Your are not used to cold weather ? 
 Well , You'd better get some more warm clothes . 
 I would say it's about 5 degree Celsius . 
 I see a problem . 
 I noticed that the faucet in the kitchen is leaking . 
 It ’ s going to be a problem when my water bill comes . 
 I would like you to fix the problem . 
 Well , I won ’ t be able to rent the apartment until the problem is fixed . 
 I ’ m happy that we ’ Ve come to an agreement . 
 sure , what do you need to do there ? 
 I have to exchange some money . 
 I also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . There was a problem last week . 
 their interest rates are usually quite high . It ’ s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest . 
 Wow , your apartment is a mess . 
 Look ! Are those all your clothes on the couch ? 
 Are they clean ? 
 My sister and I usually go to the laundromat down the street . Why don't you go there ? 
 Yes I know . I have to do it every week . Anyway , are you ready to go ? 
 OK , but please hurry . I think the restaurant is closing soon . 
 Well , I ’ Ve attended some conferences in this field . But the most relevant training I ’ Ve had was in computer design . I believe I could integrate that knowledge with my college degree to design 
 Well , I notice that you currently provide an on-screen TV Guide . At the moment , it just scrolls the names of the programs in a repeated loop . If you have many channels , you have to wait a long t 
 Tie it in with the pay-per-view services , and perhaps it could be a money-maker . 
 Yes , I took a break from work during that time . I had a baby , and as she was born with a handicap , I decided to suspend my career . But I have continued to keep up with the Industry through con 
 I'll tell you something that's good about action movies . The special effects are great ! 
 That's just your personal prejudice . Do you know who was the director of the movie Titanic ? 
 Well , did you know he was also the director of The Terminator ? 
 Where's Bill ? The ambassador is already here . The meeting is set to start at 9 am . 
 Even though the traffic is bumper-to-bumper out there , I don't think it's heavy traffic that makes Bill late . He takes the train , remember ? 
 Well , to be fare , since he's coming all the way from Lancaster , he's got to get up much earlier than the rest of us . He must get start on his commute about six thirty , no telling what time he actually gets up . 
 Why doesn't he just drive to work ? 
 So Dick , how about getting some coffee for tonight ? 
 Come on , you can at least try a little , besides your cigarette . 
 Not for me , Dick . 
 I heard that too . She must be making a pocket . Well , good for her . 
 yes , she will . At the moment , the exchange rate is very favorable , so she should try to go as soon as possible , while it ’ s cheaper . 
 really ? I thought his parents had died several years ago . 
 dying can be very expensive nowadays ! What ’ s he going to do with it ? 
 I had some good financial news yesterday too . 
 no , but I got a pay rise of 5 % and a hours for all the hard work I ’ Ve put in recently . I think it was very nice for my boss to show his appreciation in that way . 
 Hi , Sara , what are you reading ? 
 Why ? 
 What for ? 
 That sounds cool . Do you mind if I recommend myself for the job ? 
 Yes , of course . But I only freelance on weekends with my uncle . 
 Please go ahead , I am listening . 
 Is your back door higher than the ground level ? 
 Okay , then you need a deck with a guardrail . 
 Don't worry . I will build your deck with a simple but classic look . 
 Cedar is a good choice . 
 Who will meet you at the airport ? 
 Oh , then I will arrange one of my staff to meet you at the airport . 
 I have to start eating better too . 
 I try my best to eat only fruits , vegetables , and chicken . 
 That's basically it . 
 Actually , fruits and veggies are really good for you . 
 I mainly eat baked chicken , because there's not a lot of fat . 
 I know it does , and that's because it is . 
 Yes , but it was many years ago . 
 I was a naughty boy and I played hooky . So the school gave me a punishment to clear the classroom for a week . 
 Yes , I have booked a table for four . My name is Liu Fan . 
 Thanks . 
 Can we see the menu , please ? 
 Anything good for this evening ? 
 Very good , we'll take them all . 
 Yes indeed . It has a very strict inspection so it takes a pretty long Be for everyone . 
 Yes , a lot . Stuffs which are explosive , radioactive and poisonous are forbidden . 
 Yes , you do . And you need to put out liquid items and your laptop in the box for inspection . 
 Yes , absolutely . But this is for everyone's sake , so we should do it as needed . 
 This is he speaking . 
 Oh , thank you . 
 Yes , it's all right . Shall we say two in the afternoon ? 
 All Right . 
 The hotel is near to People's Square . Its name is Bai Ju Hotel . 
 It's Room 302 on the third floor . But I'll be waiting for you in the lobby , If you can't find me , please page me . 
 See you ! 
 The outlook in the future is very positive . Because we have been in this field for hundreds of years and we know how to survive this crisis safely . 
 Great . Welcome to our company . 
 What ’ s your flight number ? 
 Just for yourself ? 
 Hold on , please . Yes.you ’ re booked on ZN741 to Atlanta on July 18th . Your seats are in the first class section . 
 Hey there , you look a little lost . Are you new here ? 
 You can always spot the newbies . I can give you a few pointers if you want . Were you trying to use this machine here ? 
 It ’ s ok , I know how it is . This machine here will work out your upper body , mainly your triceps and biceps . Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition ? 
 In that case you want to work with less weight . You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . Five kilo weights should be enough . Now it ’ s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle . 
 It ’ s not that much . Just watch ... I ’ m ok ... 
 Here you are . 
 Take your time . When you need anything , just call me . 
 Not good . I lost my wallet . 
 No , I think it came out of my pocket when I was in the taxi . 
 Can I borrow some money ? 
 About 50 dollars . 
 Thanks . I'll pay you back on Friday . 
 What are you going to do now ? 
 If you wait a minute I can go with you . 
 Why are you leaving your present job ? 
 Why do you plan to change your job ? 
 Why are you interested in working with this company ? 
 How often are stockholders meetings held ? 
 What percentage of the stockholders actually attend the meetings ? I'm guessing not a large percentage ... 
 So , how much say do the stockholders really have ? 
 I was wondering if you could help me use the Student Job Center . 
 I want to work in a restaurant . 
 I want to work part-time . 
 Yes , I know what to do . 
 Yes , I think that would be great . 
 Sometimes I think television is too biased . None of them are completely objective . 
 Newspapers or the radio I guess . I just wish TV was more objective . 
 The internet's a lot worse . 
 There's no one moderating it . Anyone around the world can put information onto the net for anyone else to see . The information on the internet is mostly unsubstantiated and you can never know who has written it , or why . A lot of people get conned online . 
 Is this the registration office ? 
 I don't know exactly . 
 I've got a sore throat , a runny nose , and a headache . 
 Medical department ? Are you sure ? 
 Where is it ? 
 Yes . Here you are . 
 Hi Paul . How are you , friend . 
 How so ? 
 Have you talk to him about it ? 
 Ahahah , Maybe that will help you lose weight . 
 Sorry Paul . I couldn't help it . So why doesn't he give you a hand ? 
 Well , talk to him , and let me know what happens , OK ? 
 Who cares ? 
 Me , too , I can ’ t stop scratching . They are everywhere ! Sneaky little jerks . 
 No , I forgot to buy some . 
 We can cover ourselves with beer ! That way if they bite us , they ’ ll get drunk and fall asleep . 
 Run ! They are thirsty for more ! 
 Sure . Is it your father's birthday ? 
 Oh ! How could I forget such an important holiday ? 
 Yes , let's go . 
 He's a sad dog . He came to the wedding in jeans ! 
 Good afternoon . 
 Thank you . 
 It ’ s half past twelve . 
 From one to two . 
 We usually go to the cafeteria . 
 let ’ s go together . 
 How do you do , Mr . Smith ? My name is Thou Hong . 
 Will you please take a seat ? Mr . Smith , have you seen the display of our electronic products in the exhibition hall downstairs ? 
 Sure we can . You know , we've been in this line for more than twenty years . 
 Good . We can hold more talks later on to iron out the details . 
 The blake's got divorced . 
 Mr.black has been getting a little around aside . 
 No , he doesn't . But his wife found out he has been too charming for a long time.Incredibly , he has many different girlfriends . Starting almost right after they married 20 years ago . 
 No , the only thing I've ever done behind your back is zip you up , besides I told all my other girlfriends , and my wife who's getting suspicious . and we had a cold for a while , tell the 
 You are not funny either . I can't believe I married a woman like you . 
 The whole-wheat loaf is 45 cents , the white loaves are 35 cents each , the baguette is 27 cents and the rolls are eight cents each . That makes two dollars fifty-seven cents . 
 Thank you , ma'am . Forty-three cents change . Have a nice day . 
 By credit card . 
 Do you take American Express ? 
 Ok , I'll use my Visa . Here you are . 
 I am really exhausted , you know , I have been working without the weekend for two weeks . My boss always asks us to work overtime . 
 No . But he provides free meals and sometimes gives us some small gifts . Many of us get very tired of this , and we'd rather have weekends than stay in the office . 
 We all know about that , but we have no choice . The chairman of the trade union says he is going to negotiate with the management . 
 That's a good idea . I think we will soon come to a solution to the problem . 
 Do you have a map of the campus ? 
 Do you know where your classes are ? 
 That's because you don't know the short cuts . You'll learn them after a while . I can show you the ropes . 
 I wonder if you can help me . 
 Please wake me up at seven tomorrow morning . 
 Mr . Lee in Room 1234 . 
 What's wrong ? 
 What a pity ! 
 Why not have a visit to the zoo ? 
 Fine . And you ? 
 That's good . Not Evey company provides employees with training opportunity . It seems that your company wants to further develop their employees and encouragelifelong learning . 
 So , what's the problem ? 
 Yes , you are right . But one should keep learning daily to maintain our keen mental power expand our intellectual capacity . Constant learning drive us to Sharp our power of reasoning , analysis and judgement . 
 Yes , you are right . I think weekend is the time for family gathering and rest Maybe you could make that suggestion to your boss . 
 Come on in . Would you care for a drink ? 
 How's John doing ? 
 Here is the document you asked for this morning . 
 You ’ re welcome . You know , these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . The more I think about it , the more I hate myself for being so disorganized . I decided to change the situation as soon as possible . Otherwise I will be more regretful later . 
 The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place . 
 Can you lend me some money ? 
 You ’ Ve gone through all your money so quickly ? I thought you were well-off . 
 Oh , my ! It's really hot . I've never seen such scorching weather in my life . 
 Oh , look at the thermometer ! The temperature has hit 98 . 
 But it's already awfully close . 
 I guess you can ’ t do anything until after dark then . 
 Could you do me a favor ? 
 What's the matter , sir ? You look pale . 
 Are you often traveling by plane ? 
 That's right . It's normal if you don't often take the plane . Just relax a little bit . 
 Don't worry , sir . It's just because of the lower pressure . 
 You may feel much better if you chew some gum or peanuts . 
 Are you feeling better now ? Do you need some pills ? 
 So , you'd better wear this eyeshade and you will sleep well . 
 If you try to adapt yourself to your destination's local time , you'll feel more comfortable . So please try to sleep , and have meals according to Los Angeles's time . 
 Hello , China Travel Agency . Can I help you ? 
 Just a moment , please . I'm sorry but the flights are fully booked on that day . The next available flight is on May 2nd . They have two flights , one is at 9:30 a . m . and another at 2:00 p . m . Both flights have seats available . 
 One way trip or round trip ? 
 Economy fare for one way trip is 2,300 yuan . 
 Yes , I have confirmed your ticket . 
 Thank you . Here is the ticket and receipt . Have a good time . 
 Sure , Liv , what can I do for you ? 
 You wanna take some time off , is that right ? 
 What dates are you planning on taking off ? I ’ ll need at least two months notice , so that I can plan for your absence . 
 Well , I guess so . 
 Yes . I once worked in a small stock exchange . My work is very simple . 
 No , I thought it too dull . Also I didn't think it was challenging enough . 
 The stock exchange where I worked was too small My further promotion was impossible . I am able of more responsibilities , so I decided to leave . 
 Yes , I'm sure you do . It sounds like an excellent service . 
 It seems perfect . 
 Could you also let me view some of the testimonials ? I'd really be interested to see what other group companies thought of this service . 
 It was washed by washing machine . 
 I'm so sorry . I have no idea of it . I washed silk dress the first time . I'll buy a new one for you or I'll give you money . 
 It's very nice of you . I'll try my best to do my job well . 
 Hello , Tina . An acquaintance of mine has just told me that your bank has started a new Personal Wealth Management Service . Is that right ? 
 How would I go about applying for this service ? 
 That's so simple . I'll come by my local branch later this afternoon and get it set up . Thank you very much , Tina . 
 I'm going shopping . 
 No . I need to borrow $ 50 . 
 May I know the definite date of delivery ? 
 Is there any possibility for you to ensure prompt shipment ? 
 Thank you for bringing me here . What shall we order ? 
 Really ? I ’ d rather have the chicken feet to be honest . 
 How about drinks ? Would you like beer or wine ? 
 Wine ’ s fine by me . Let ’ s order a bottle of the house red then . 
 How did you get into hip hop ? 
 Who is your favorite hip hop artist ? 
 Hey , Frank , there is that Janet Check . 
 She sure knows how to strut her stuff . 
 And look out she's dressed . 
 No way . Her old man is rich . He buys her anything she wants . 
 I think you've lost it . 
 I admit that she is much prettier than Kate . 
 At least we agree on that . Let's go and get a drink . 
 Just having a chat . 
 Let me have a look . Well , how many kinds of steaks do you have ? 
 Is there something go with the filet steak ? 
 What's the matter ? You don't look well . 
 What about ? 
 Oh , is that all ? 
 Don't worry about it . Try to look on the bright sight of things . 
 8 hours . Tokyo is 8 hours earlier than London . 
 One day more . 
 Yes . 
 I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . But I don ’ t like traveling to work , waiting for buses , or ... 
 Exactly . 
 Well , an important part of the duties of a secretary , I think , is to do well the preparation work for the meeting . 
 First of all , the agenda should be prepared before the meeting . Then you should ensure that those entitled to be present are properly informed . 
 All the necessary documents and the information relevant to the meeting should be available , preferably printed and distributed before the meeting . 
 Of course , she should take minutes . 
 After the meeting she should type the minutes up , and then keep proper records of the business transacted and the resolutions passed and also implement many of the decision reached at the meeting . 
 I'd like to reserve a table for three at 6:30 this evening . 
 Nonsmoking , please . 
 My surname is Gao . 
 The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest . 
 No , absolutely not ! On the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . But always pay attention to what you say . If the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested . 
 Correct . Show respect for the older people . Conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other . 
 Yes , plenty of them . Don't eat fast ! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely . 
 Haha , I'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate . 
 Yes , my name is Bill . 
 OK , thank you . 
 I can't remember . 
 Strange looking handle on that coffee mug , isn't it ? 
 What's the advantage ? Price , I suppose . 
 What deliveries are you quoting nowadays on orders such as ours ? 
 You don't do much in porcelain tiles and ornaments , do you ? 
 I see . Well , keep up the good work . See you later . 
 Why do you say that ? 
 Really ? In my eyes it ’ s normal , as an old man , to be thin is better than to be fat . 
 Mom , why do chinese people like to touch my head ? sometimes they even touch my cheeks . 
 But i donor like it , not a bit , i am not a pet , i am a girl . 
 But i do not like anyone touch my head . 
 What if everybody in the wheres goes crazy ? 
 Does this mean that if i might want those new European bitches , i am supposed to wonder run reget ? 
 That is my work , i will try it . 
 Yes , sir ? 
 I used to play football regularly when I was at university . And I used to do athletics in the summer . 
 I was a runner-a long-distance runner . 
 No . I'm afraid I haven't had time since I got married . 
 Certainly , sir . 
 Thank you , yes . I'm not sure how to use this ATM , I usually go to a clerk and use my Bank Book . But today , I thought I'd try something new . I want to take some money out . 
 Thanks so much . Right , I've put my card in . What now ? 
 Then it'll give me my money ? 
 Here we are ' withdrawal ' , so I just press here ? 
 Oh , as simple as that ! I shall never wait for a real person again , these machines are wonderful . 
 I think that , as more people use the Internet for both work and pleasure , it makes more sense as a tool to connect with people , and the stigma of meeting someone online is reduced . 
 I would say do not make the e-mail exchange too long . A lot of times a connection via e-mail creates almost a false sense of intimacy . Quickly make sure there is a connection in the physical world . 
 I'd suggest you not give out too much personal information , like your home address , until after several dates . Just keep up the same guards you would keep up if you were meeting any stranger . 
 Well , for a site like ecrush.com , since their debut in Valentine's Day in 1999 , of the 1.5 million people who have joined ecrush.com , 300000 have actually matched . 
 Yes , the couple that I highlighted at today's show met on Match.com and they're getting married this summer . 
 Well , unfortunately I have got something to do this weekend . But let me see ... 
 That's very kind of you.How soon do you really need them ? 
 I'll try . 
 I came in response to your advertisement for a salesperson . 
 My name is Woody . 
 Because I admire your company . Yours is one of the most effective and respectable companies in this city . 
 Yes , five years ago . I began to work in a fashion company in Shanghai . Two years ago , I came to Beijing , and worked in a department store as a salesman . 
 Thanks . 
 I can ’ t give you a definite answer . Let ’ s play it by ear . 
 Why not ? 
 Under which category do you intend to apply ? 
 So that's the Family Reunification . 
 Sorry , I ’ m not a volleyball-fun . I ’ d rather play football . How about you , Mr . Wang . ? Are you interested in volleyball ? 
 These things are always oooo boring . Heard any gossip ? Anybody making the big bucks ? 
 That's no news . Those two were high school sweethearts anyway . 
 Uh , I can see that . And Erica Falls has lost a lot of weight . 
 Tomorrow I'll take you to some places that I'm sure you will have interest in . 
 Not many but these ones . They are the Folk Antique Handicrafts and Collectibles Exhibition Halls ! 
 Well , there're actually over 200 kinds of folk collections in this city , that's half the collections of antique objects in China . There's one exhibition hall for multiple collection , and several individual display rooms for private collections . 
 No hurry ! I'll tell you now . The collections include ancient cases and caskets , tea sets , abacuses , precious sea shells and conches , jars and water abacuses for study use , drama costumes , agates , ancient coins , butterflies , fans , mini musical instruments , root-carving , rare stones and rocks , model ships , model cars . 
 Okey , Okey . We'll start from the Folk Collection Exhibition House , a multi-folk collection exhibition hall , where the best of local antique objects are on constant display . The hall itself used to be the site of a local club in the late King Dynasty , a well preserved piece of antique architecture itself . Academic research seminars and exchanges between domestic and international experts are often organized there . 
 If you have interest in butterflies , you must go to the Butterfly Exhibition . Mr . Chen , owner of the private museum , has a large collection of specimen of over 1 000 species of butterflies from more than 20 countries for public display . Quite a lot of them are state-level treasures . 
 Excuse me , what's your name ? 
 John . 
 Thank you . 
 Sure . It's 5:10 PM . 
 I said it's 5:10 PM . 
 You're welcome . 
 Morning , Jenny . Haven't seen you for ages ! 
 You did give me a surprise . How have you been ? 
 Not so well . I've come down with the flu . 
 It's really great to see you again . How about a drink tonight ? 
 How about seven ? 
 I'll pick you up . 
 Excuse me , are these deck chairs free ? 
 Could I have a fresh towel ? 
 It's very kind of you . By the way , when does the pool close ? 
 Hi ! My name is Mike . 
 Nice to meet you , too . 
 I'm from Shanghai . And you ? 
 Your 3.5 percent share is going to be worth at least a million . 
 What if I said no ? 
 You wouldn't ! If you leave , you'll make nothing . 
 OK . If you sign the Stars.com account before WebTracker does , we'll talk next week . 
 Oh , do you really like it ? 
 Well , it's kind of you to say so . 
 Sure . It's really very easy . First , mix together an egg , two teaspoons of salt , and two pounds of ground beef . Then , add two ounces of milk . Are you with me ? 
 OK . Next , put the mixture into a baking pan and bake it forty-five minutes at 360 degrees . 
 Sure . Bake it forty-five minutes at 360 degrees . 
 Do you mind taking a photo for me ? 
 That's really kind of you . 
 Well , it's an automatic camera . You just press the button . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Fine , thanks . How's your boy , Jack ? 
 Poor boy . They work hard at school nowadays , don't they ? Does he like it ? 
 Yes , it does . Does he go to school by bus ? 
 What does he do when it rains ? 
 May I have two full fare tickets and one half ticket ? 
 Here you are . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Sure . What is it ? 
 Sure . Will you be long ? 
 Go ahead . It will be safe with me . 
 I can ’ t seem to make a decision . 
 I honestly have no idea . 
 I like it here at PCC . 
 I like that idea . 
 I completely agree . 
 I ’ m staying right where I ’ m at . 
 Hello . I'm here to talk about my credit card . You see , I'm a corporate card holder and a personal card holder . I've had my personal credit card for ages , but my corporate one is new to me . 
 Is there anything else ? 
 And I suppose I can do that anywhere ? I do have to travel a lot for my job and it's such a hassle using cash and collecting all the separate receipts . 
 In just one document ? That will definitely be a time saver . 
 Hello , Marsha , I haven't heard from you in a long time . I'm great , and you ? 
 Sure , what can I do for you ? 
 I'm really busy right now . I got a lot on my plate.So this isn't an actual bid you want but just a ballpark figure ? 
 Well , I can give you those figures now over the phone , is that okay ? Or do you need them in writing ? 
 Is this another rush , dear ? Did you forget and wait until the last minute again ? 
 Well , just because it's you . Tomorrow , say around noon . 
 Sure , go ahead . 
 Sure , I can take you there actually . 
 It's fine . I was heading there anyway . 
 Let's go to the lake and camp on the south side . 
 Let's just rent one this time . The AC is broken in the truck , remember ? 
 Should we call the Olsen's and ask them if they want to join us ? 
 Then you go out to the garage and check out the camping gear . 
 Let me just get five more minutes of sleep . 
 I understand , but all I want is five more minutes of sleep . 
 Trust me . I'm going to wake up . 
 I already know , and I'll take care of all that when I wake up . 
 I'll make it to school on time . Don't worry . 
 I really appreciate that . 
 Hello Todd . 
 Australia ? Oh , there's about twenty million people in Australia right now . A little bit under , but close to twenty . 
 The biggest city ? The biggest city is Sydney , then it's followed by Melbourne and then Brisbane and then I think it's Perth . But most of the big cities are on the East Coast of Australia . And Perth is on the west coast , but sort of of out there by itself . 
 I like Brisbane . I had my teenage years in Brisbane , growing up in Brisbane , um or maybe Sidney because it is a big city , but Brisbane has got the gold coast and the sunshine . 
 Ah , Canberra is the capital city . But is not the biggest city . Sydney is the biggest city . Canberra was made sort of by the politicians so Sydney wouldn't get to crowded . It's a separate territory . 
 You asked for it . 
 I am here to have a discussion on your company's investment issue . 
 I am James Pond from FAM Company and I am here to discuss it with Nova . 
 Yes , I did it yesterday . Our meeting should be 2 pm . 
 Thank you . 
 New York Airport.May I help you ? 
 Hold on a moment please ... Sorry , the flight from London has been delayed . It departed two hours later than scheduled.The whether in London was really bad . 
 So far we could only deduce this way.If you want further information , would you please call us 1 hour later ? 
 May I be of any help ? 
 What style ? 
 Ok . Here are the ones , turtleneck pullover , crewneck pullover , V-neck pullover and cowl-neck pullover . 
 No . Have a seat . 
 Yeah , most of them have arrived . Don't worry . There are still 20 minutes left before the match . 
 Of course . It's a newly-built one . 
 Hurry up , Benjamin ! Pass the ball to me . I'm good at shooting . 
 Oh , God ! I didn't touch anybody . How can I commit a foul ? 
 Yes , I got it . Come on , Benjamin , don't let him get into the paint . 
 Really ? You must be ... 
 That's interesting . Let's hurry up , we should beat them in the first half . 
 He may be injured . Yes , come on , call the team doctor . 
 I know , but I don't have a choice , my boss has complete control over our work schedules . I haven't made it out of the office before 9 PM a single day this week . 
 No , not exactly , I'm working for minimum wage.And they don't give extra pay for overtime . Overtime is our own time . 
 They do give bonuses at the end of the year for the employees with highest productivity numbers , but frankly , it's not much of an incentive . They give us a bonus of ten dollars . 
 I would , but I'm afraid I would't be able to find another job . I don't have very many job marketable skills , there aren't so many jobs that I'm qualified for . 
 Why are you so crazy about bird-watching ? What do you get out of it ? 
 Really ? 
 What do you think is harder , reading or writing ? 
 I don ’ t think I understand what you mean . Could you explain a little more ? 
 Oh , now I see what you mean . When you ’ re reading , you are just looking , but when you are writing , you are actually doing something ! 
 I think I see what you mean . I can read Shakespeare but I definitely can ’ t write it . 
 So I have another question for you . What do you think is harder , speaking or understanding ? 
 In what way ? 
 You are making me feel really discouraged . 
 Excuse me , do you know where the Post Office is ? 
 Is the restaurant on the right or on the left hand side of the road ? 
 OK . Do I turn on the lights or do I go straight ? 
 And do I take that road ? 
 Is there a Post Office sign on the building ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 I'm awfully sorry , sir . I do apologize . Room 908 is at the end of the corridor . It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet . 
 No problem , sir . We'll manage it , but we don't have any spare room today . Could you wait till tomorrow ? The American People-to-people Education Delegation will be leaving tomorrow morning . There'll be some rooms for you to choose from . 
 Be sure . I'll make a note of that . Everything will be taken care of . And if there is anything more you need , please let us know . 
 Wow , sounds chaotic ... two thousand people in the streets carrying picket signs and shouting slogans . What gave them the motivation to finally organize and call management on the substandard working conditions ? 
 So what kind of demands do they have ? What are they asking for specifically ? 
 I believe we ' Ve met before . My name's David . 
 Oh , I remember now.Very nice to meet you again . 
 I need help preparing for my presentation on Friday . 
 Are you sure you have the time ? 
 What would be the best time for you to help me ? 
 Should we just meet here ? 
 I'll see you then . 
 Look ! The girl is so beautiful and she is smiling at me . She is lovely . 
 What makes you think so ? 
 Who's that ? 
 Is that your cousin in the back ? 
 What about birth control pills ? Don't they work on Italians ? 
 And I heard that Italian men have very active libidos . 
 When can I go to see him ? 
 OK . 
 Hmm ... How long will it take to mail things to the USA by air ? 
 I want to send it by express mail . The faster , the better . 
 Here you go . 
 Thanks . 
 She must be very sad . 
 At a time like this , what she needs is a pat on the back rather than a blame . 
 I am doing well . How about you , Mary ? 
 There is a new movie at the mall that I want to see . Want to go with me ? 
 I could go to the movies on Friday night instead . Would that be better ? 
 I thought the movie about a serial killer who rapes and mutilates his victims would be a good choice . 
 Maybe we can think of something somewhere between a chick flick and a horror movie ! 
 I didn't like her butting in where I didn't want her . She's a chatter box . 
 I know . But I just can't stand her butting in when I was trying to emphasize a point . 
 Yes . I was president of the Student Council of our university . 
 Yes . I was elected Excellent Party Member for four academic years . 
 Yes . I was a member of the Student Poetry Society . I like writing poems in my spare time . 
 I sometimes played table tennis and sometimes played basketball . 
 I would like to buy a new fridge . 
 I was looking at this Kenmore refrigerator . 
 What's so great about it ? 
 What appliances ? 
 May I see the inside for myself ? 
 Wow ! You're right ! This refrigerator is great . I'll take it . 
 Yeah , of course . You can take a taxi . 
 It depends on traffic and distance , but it is reasonable . 
 Some are better than others . But , you shouldn't have a problem . 
 For the most part , yes . If you don't feel comfortable with it , then it is best not to take one at night . 
 Certainly , where will you be coming from ? 
 Ok . Take the Underground ( the Circle line ) to High Street Kensington . Make sure you take the High Street Kensington exit . 
 Ok - when you leave the Underground , cross the road and you should see Horntown Street . Was up that street to the crossroads . As you was you should see a fast food place on your right . 
 No , you need to turn left into Philimore Was and take the next right . 
 That's fine . You will not miss it because it's just next to the Kensington centra Library . 
 Ok , we live in the third building on your left . Will we see you around 7 pm ? 
 Hey , Tom . I saw this ad in the paper . You should take a look . 
 It's for a job . It looks perfect for you . 
 Come on ! What have you got to lose ? 
 Here , I ’ ll help you type one up . 
 Why did the teacher criticise Myra in front of the whole class ? 
 I don't think that Myra should have spoken so rudely to the teacher . I know she was angry , but that's still no excuse for rudeness . 
 Yes . What can I do for you ? 
 That's cool . What documents do I need to carry ? 
 we ’ Ve got a lot of work to do now , but take your time over this project . We don ’ t want to make any mistakes . 
 that ’ s right . We ’ ll finish them just in time . The Macy project can wait for the time being . We need to spend several days on that project , but it isn ’ t due to be finished until the end of the month , s 
 I ’ m going to give everyone on the team an extra day off . Everyone deserves it . 
 that ’ s true . Right . I ’ m going back to the meeting . It ’ s been going on for hours and there ’ s no indication that it ’ ll end soon . 
 good . I have to go right now . I really hope this meeting doesn ’ t last too long . 
 I ’ ll stop by if I have time later . Make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines . 
 I guess I'm just a little nervous . I'm giving everything I have to invoking , and ... 
 Exactly . 
 How ? 
 But what about tomorrow ? What if Stars.com decides to go with WebTracker , and not us ? 
 You know , all I was trying to do was tell the truth but they obviously didn ’ t take it that way . 
 Yeah , I ’ m dealing with it . Anyway . Thank you , Mike .
