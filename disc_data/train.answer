 I'll be with you in a second . Uh ... Yes , ma'am ? 
 Oh , I'm so sorry . May I ask what you ordered again ? 
 Why are you always staring at Melissa ? Do you like her or something ? 
 How long can I keep these books ? 
 What if I can't finish them by then ? 
 Any terrible fines ? 
 Would you please teach me how to use the computer ? 
 Do I have to turn on the computer ? 
 What should I learn first ? 
 I am ready I am going to get , let's start ! 
 Since summer is coming , I think swimming is a good way for you to do . 
 Of course ! Swimming can help you stay in shape by targeting all parts of your body . 
 It could also help you increase vital capacity . 
 You will make it if you persist in it . 
 I was told about it already . I'm just waiting for my invitation . 
 I believe that she will give me the invitation today . 
 Yeah , it sounds like it's going to be the best party of the year . 
 When exactly does the party start ? 
 Has she given out a lot of invitations yet ? 
 I'm planning on going , but I really need her to give me my invitation . 
 It ’ s great . 
 I really couldn't understand him . 
 We'd better leave him alone . 
 I'll try my best . 
 Please tell me where your daughter's home is . 
 Turn right at the second traffic light and you will see it on your left . 
 It's a pleasure . 
 I know , I know . OK , so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine . 
 So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ? 
 Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ? 
 You know what ? I ’ ll just have everything dry cleaned . 
 I'm sorry , but I have an appointment this evening.How about tomorrow evening ? 
 I've typed the report . 
 And I've filed the letters . 
 And I've checked the orders . 
 And I've ordered the supplies . 
 Did you see who the suspect was ? 
 Would you be able to pick him out of a line-up ? 
 Please take a careful look at these five men . 
 Is the suspect in this line ? 
 Which number is he ? 
 Your cooperation is very much appreciated . 
 Good morning , I ’ d like to book a flight from Beijing to Shanghai , please . 
 I ’ d like to fly next Friday . 
 One-way , please . I ’ m flying back to London from Shanghai . 
 How long is the flight ? 
 can you help me pick out some fabric for a suit ? I'm going to get one made for a friend's wedding . 
 it depends on the price , but I was thinking of getting a wool / cashmere blend . 
 I was thinking of a brown pin-striped suit . 
 haven't you heard ? Brown is the new black . 
 that may be true , but black is so boring . Anyway , I already have three black suits . I might as well get a suit that stands out from the rest . 
 I like the one on the left , but I don't like the pattern on it . It's too much . I want a pattern that's a bit subtler . 
 I think that will do . Let's go talk to the tailor about getting it made . 
 Good evening , I have a reservation under the name of Tomlinson . 
 That ’ s right . 
 Yes , sure . Also , I ’ d like a non-smoking room please . 
 What's your main range ? 
 I am interested in your flying pigeon bicycles . I think some of these items will find a ready market in Canada . But what our customers appreciate most is a reliable product . 
 Then I'd like to know your availability of the products and the terms of sales , such as mode of payment , delivery , discounts , etc . 
 And what ’ s the problem ? 
 And you want to know what to wear ? 
 That sounds just right to me . What was wrong with it ? 
 My guess is you can safely wear last night ’ s outfit to tonight ’ s party . 
 Yes , do you have a table for five ? 
 We'd like a non-smoking room , please . 
 Liz , you were supposed to have had those contracts typed up by now . 
 No , Liz . I asked you specifically . Don ’ t you remember ? 
 What happened to Nancy ? She is all sweetness and light today . 
 No wonder ! Who is the bridegroom ? 
 Where are you going , Tony ? 
 Mom said you couldn't go out . 
 Wow ! Your fruit looks really fresh ! How much are these apples ? 
 Let's see , 30NT is about ... almost a dollar US . What ? ! How about these pineapples ? 
 Hmm , 250NT is ... 8 dollars ? ! ! And you can't even eat them ? You're crazy ! 
 Now that's more like it ! Bananas have lots of potassium , too ! 
 Are they from Taiwan ? 
 OK . I'll take four kiwis . 
 I'm going shopping . 
 I'm going to leave around 4 O'clock . 
 OK . 
 I'm not sure . 
 25 dollars . Do you think that's enough ? 
 I think it's OK . I also have two credit cards . 
 Thanks . See you later . 
 I love breathing fresh air in the suburb places , while sitting in the morning sunshine . 
 Yeah , just return to nature and feel the thrills of its beauty . 
 Sure . The sunny days of spring are ideal for outdoor gatherings . 
 OK , you go back to our car and fetch the picnic stuff . 
 Nothing special . Food , drinks , and Daniel's kangaroo toys . 
 He said he would like to be our tour director and he lined up many things to do . 
 Science ? What are you talking about ? Forget about your science , OK ? It's a picnic ! 
 I can't agree on that . Just cut it out . Give him a break and don't spoil the day . 
 Hey , you ’ re early ! Where ’ s everyone ? 
 Oh ... why ? 
 Sure . What is it ? 
 Are you serious ? We ’ Ve been friends for years ! We can ’ t just change that overnight ! 
 I ... I ... 
 I've had it with Tim ! I think I'm going to quit ! 
 Yeah ... I know . But I'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles ! 
 Basically , I think Tim is threatened by me . I'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career ! 
 Yes . He's all nice and friendly to my face . But the second I turn around he stabs me in the back ! 
 I should keep a better record of my correspondence with the clients so if necessary I can prove it was my effort . 
 Excuse me . Something is wrong with my bank card . Can you help me ? 
 Just a mistake with my name . It should be issued as Steven , but the card is under the name ' Steven ' . 
 OK , no problem . To err is human . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Sure , I've picked up a few things from travelling around for work . Why ? 
 Did you bow back ? 
 Well , Japanese businessmen and women typically bow to greet each other in Japan . She might have been offended by your strong handshake . 
 Things are different in Japan . You know , in some countries , making eye contact with others is considered rude . 
 I think it's highly possible , yes . 
 That's a good idea . When you don ’ t know much about other cultures , the simplest thing can offend someone . 
 Hello , police office ? 
 Yes , I'd like to report a case . Somebody broke into my house . 
 It happened in the morning . I just came home from work and found the lock broken . 
 I don't know . I called the police as soon as I found the lock broken . 
 Please be quick . 
 My name is Benjamin , and I live in Broad-Gate Street 2101 . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Why don't you sit in the back with me ? 
 By the way , what's your last name ? I forgot what it is . 
 R-I-N ? 
 I got it . Mary Lin . 
 How'd you like to go on a bungee jump this weekend ? 
 How about Sunday , then ? We could start in the morning . 
 Don't worry . It is a test of physical endurance , intelligence . Just to finish it is considered a victory for most . 
 May , is the university a terrible place ? 
 Because you study day in and day out for the entrance exam . So I figure you would study even harder after you ’ Ve got in . 
 How do you know that ? You haven't got in yet . 
 Oh , really ? Were you not caught ? 
 What do you want to study in the university ? Have you thought about it ? 
 I will choose what I like . You don't know what a torture it is for me to study English , because I don't like English . 
 You can decide later . You will have choices before you submit your university application form . 
 What's your number ? 
 Five . 
 You think it's funny . I'm terrified . 
 But I've never jumped off anything in my life . The highest thing I've jumped off is my bed . I'm scared . 
 I guess I'm adventuresome , but then I'm scared too . 
 What can I help you with today ? 
 Will that be cash or check ? 
 Could you sign the back of the check , please ? 
 Would you like any cash back ? 
 How much would you like ? 
 Here is your $ 150 . 
 Why don't we Chinese have our own Valentine's Day ? 
 Oh ? Why is that day ? 
 You look a bit under the weather . 
 I know that it ’ s going around the dorms . 
 I have some cold tablets if you would like one . 
 Drinking liquids and getting rest is a good idea with a cold . 
 You could always go to the pharmacy if it gets worse and you want suggestions . 
 What would you have ? 
 What about this dry red ? It's good indeed , it never goes to the head . 
 Here it is . 
 I'm always at your service . 
 Yeah . He ’ s almost become a slave , his wife is leading him by the nose . 
 We look forward to your early reply and trust that through our mutual cooperation we shall be able to conclude this transaction with you in the near future . 
 I hope you'll see that we are really doing our utmost . 
 Sure . Where should I put this cup ? 
 The red one . 
 How about this fruit ? 
 And those pencils ? What should I do with them ? 
 How about this pen ? 
 What do you want me to do with that paper over there ? 
 The trash is full . 
 OK . Now what ? 
 Sure . 
 David took me to it last week . I thought it was a little sick . 
 It was entertaining in some ways . But in general I didn't like it . 
 I just think the humor was too gross . There were too many disgusting things in it . I don't think a comedy has to have so much smut to be funny . 
 No , you're right . But nudity doesn't bother me . What bothered me were all the jokes about masturbation , stuff like that . It was too sick . 
 I don't think it's realistic . I thought it was sick . Why does a movie have to use that kind of humor ? 
 Have you noticed the Mexican restaurant on the other side of this street ? 
 Yes , someone give me a pamphlet introducing the restaurant and its business hours when I passed by this morning.So , let ’ s have a try . My treat . 
 Good for you . Today we have more chances to try some new food because there are now many new form restaurants in our city coming from places all over the world . 
 For sure all the customers will benefit from this . 
 No problem . 
 Nice to meet you , Austin . 
 By the way , Richard will assist me in the planning work . I hope you can work well together . 
 Thank you.It ' s very kind of you . 
 Thank you , sir . I'll try my best to assist Richard in his work . 
 I sent my resume to a computer company and am waiting for their call . 
 Pineapple Computer Company . A secretary is needed there , and it is worth a try . Do you get any information or advertisement for employment ? 
 But what ? You always act like this , when you face difficulties . 
 All the fears are nothing . You can make it . There is no other choice for you . Be brave . 
 It's all or nothing . 
 Go along this street to the traffic lights . 
 That's right , and turn left at the lights . 
 And then right at the bridge . 
 Yes . The gas station is on the left . And you can't miss it . 
 No , this taxi is free . 
 OK . Please get in . I'm glad to serve you . 
 It will take half an hour to get to the hotel . 
 OK , I promise we'll get there in twenty minutes . 
 It's the 17th week now , isn't it ? 
 Oh , the final exam is coming soon . I feel a little bit nervous . 
 No , I haven't began my preparations . 
 Great . You can help me a lot with English . 
 No problem . 
 I think he has realized that . But he is still whistling in the dark by putting up an act . 
 But when I noticed that he was left in the cold , I could not help wanting to help him to get out of the situation . 
 Thanks . Dad , but I can manage it myself . 
 Yes , I know . The problem is that I can't find it . Where did you put it ? 
 Oh , yes , here it is . 
 What's up ? 
 No . Dad . We have a tour guide . 
 No , I won't get sick . I promise . Ok . I've finished . Bye , Dad . See you ! 
 Dad , that's all right . I don't think it will rain . And it doesn't make any sense to take that many things on a trip . Besides I like to travel light . Bye ! 
 Not very well . He was white about the gills . 
 Yeah , but he refused to take the medicine . 
 I don't know the reason . 
 No , not at all . Go ahead . 
 Yes . Is that so important ? 
 Yes , I have a three-year-old son . 
 I am sorry . That table has been booked . 
 May I help you ? 
 Yes , of course . Here are all the tour routes we have to Italy . 
 2 weeks . Is that OK ? 
 What qualities do you think a business manager should possess ? 
 If a client complains about the service of your department , what will you do ? 
 I haven ’ t met Bob for years . How is he ? 
 He would have recovered from the stress and got married again . 
 I finally went out to dinner with him last night . 
 Yup . 
 True , a sea food restaurant . 
 I didn't notice . I don't really even know what I ate . 
 Good coming , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 Certainly . Please wait a moment . Here is your bill . 
 This is the charge for your laundry service on Nov . 20thA 
 Would you mind waiting a moment while we check it with the department concerned ? 
 I'm very sorry , Mr . Bob . There has been a mistake . We'll correct the bill . 
 Thank you very much . Hope to see you again . 
 Yes . I like cooking very much . I got this hobby when I was 12 years sold . 
 I have no idea . I like cooking by myself . I like to taste delicious food . 
 And I love trying new recipes , which I usually test with my friends . You can come , too . 
 Certainly . 
 Thank you . 
 I will try my best . 
 Steve ! Haven't seen you in ages ! How long's it been ? 
 how have you been ? 
 yeah , I remember the neighborhood . Have you found a place yet ? 
 well , maybe I can help . Remember my neighbor ? 
 yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look . 
 I'll ask Mrs . Thou when she's available to show the apartment and let you know . Has your number changed ? 
 How much would you like ? 
 A higher discount will be given for a big order , so we are willing to give you a 5 % discount this time . 
 Of course I know . But there is too high a rate . Frankly speaking , the maximum discount we can make is 6 % . 
 No , they have a big new fancy house . 
 Yes , he does . He is a science fiction writer . 
 Afraid so . The more the better . 
 Well , they spend it pretty quick . New clothes , new computers and new cars every year . And they ’ Ve got a cook and housekeeper.Mona used to be an actress , she likes to spend a lot of money . 
 No . They want children but no luck yet . 
 Jim likes to travel around the world.That ' s expensive ! So he tries to make a lot of money . 
 Oh , she enjoys spending money on fancy parties.Mona loves to wear sexy dresses , and she has quite a bit of jewelry . 
 I guess so . She is also interested in politics . She knows everyone in city government . 
 She is pretty serious about it . Her uncle is a mayor . She wants to follow in his footsteps . 
 She might do well . Everyone seems to like her . 
 Really ? That ’ s marvelous ! 
 I ’ Ve made up my mind not to be beaten again . 
 Hi , I have a checking account with you . 
 I need to see if check number 212 has cleared yet . 
 Can you develop the roll of film ? 
 How long does it take ? 
 There is no need . I will come back tomorrow . 
 I am reading the book on patent and I think it will be helpful for my work 
 Yep ! I heard that your company is registering a new trademark . 
 I just read this in the whole afternoon . Let me show you . 
 The purpose of the law is to protect and encourage inventions and to promote the development of science and technology . The law came into effect in 1984 , and it consists of 8 chapters with 69 articles . 
 Foreign companies should appoint a patent agency , which is designated by our government to act as his patent agent . This task is usually taken by the Patent Agent Department . 
 15 years . 
 Oh , I thought I could make a right turn on red here . 
 Oh , I guess I didn't see it . 
 Here they are . 
 Thank you , Ma ’ am . 
 Who's calling ? 
 Yes , I liked it the first moment I pulled up to it . 
 If you like the outside , you are going to really love the inside . 
 You ’ ll notice that the window treatments , carpeting , and drapes are all new . 
 Follow me into the kitchen . You will love it . 
 The best part is the bedroom and attached bathroom . 
 Let ’ s take a few pictures so that we can remember what we like about this home . 
 I would like to have my room cleaned . Would you please send a maid here right now ? 
 Thank you . 
 How would you like them ? 
 Is there anything else ? 
 Steven , what's the expense of moving house ? 
 It costs a lot of money . Hospital bills had already made deep in-roads into our savings . Do you think the rest of your salary will be enough to cover our daily expenses ? 
 We have to cut back on our shopping from now on . 
 I hope so . 
 Something important ? 
 Tickets ? What tickets ? 
 Air tickets ? 
 We ? The day after tomorrow ? What are you talking about ? 
 Yes . So ? 
 Then it is June 20 the day after tomorrow . 
 Oh , come on . Tell me please . Why did you book tickets to Paris ? 
 Sorry . 
 Our 10th wedding anniversary ? 
 Darling . I think you have made a mistake . 
 Yes . We married on July 20 ten years ago . 
 Yes . We had planned to marry on June 20 , but something happened , so we had to put off our wedding day . 
 Since you have booked . Then let ’ s celebrate our wedding anniversary before hand . 
 Of course , sir ... Here's the minutes of the meeting . 
 The meeting was delayed by thirty minutes and it lasted for two and a half hours . 
 Yes , I told him that you were very ill and couldn't attend . 
 Yes , I did . Besides , here are all the reports and materials handed out in the meeting . I think you'll have to do some replies . 
 No , they didn't . The chairman said he would send a memo to all managers by the end of this week informing them of the date of the next meeting . 
 Oh , honey , I'm so sorry , we don't have enough space for you to have your own room . 
 Honey , you can ask him to be quite . Otherwise you may punish him and tell him to stand out of the room , right ? 
 Welcome to our company Mr white . My name is Yan Hua , the secretary of Mr Wang . 
 Would you like to have a cup of tea or coffee ? 
 Glad you like it . By the way , is this your first time to China , Mr . White ? 
 We also hope to expand our business with you . 
 I think you probably know China has adopted a flexible policy in her foreign trade . 
 Right . Seeing is believing . 
 Are you ready to order ? 
 Let me tell you about the specials of the day , which are chicken in a wine sauce with capers , and grilled garlic shrimp . 
 The chef would be happy to accommodate your special requests . 
 You could choose the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza or the goat cheese and candied walnut salad . 
 That is a good selection , and I can bring your salads now or serve them with your entree . 
 That sounds pretty good . But isn't downloading music illegal ? 
 OK , I'm going to get iTunes and download some Vanilla Ice songs . 
 What happened to John ? 
 Cheers ! To our first night in our new apartment . 
 All you hear is the crickets and the breeze . 
 Well , I think it's fabulous . And the neighbors don't even seem to exist . 
 The system keeps crashing when I try to access the personnel database . 
 Sir , may I help you ? 
 Sure . It's my pleasure . The elevator is right there ; your room is on the fifth floor . Here is your room . 
 I am so worried about this English contest . I have butterflies in my stomach now ! 
 How is your business going ? 
 Really ? Maybe I should work for you . 
 I'd appreciate it if you could help me pick out a gift for my daughter . 
 That's exactly what I was thinking of . 
 I like Macs . How much for a Mac ? 
 A Mac it is . I'll take one home with me . 
 I'll use my VISA , if that's okay . 
 Will she need anything besides what's in this box ? 
 I appreciate your help . Maybe I'll be back for more computer stuff . 
 You look fresh recently . And .. what's your weight now ? 
 Really ? Congratulations ! That's really something beyond my imagination . How did you make it ? Did you keep on a diet ? 
 Then do the slim pills take effect on you ? 
 How's it going on ? 
 I'd better exercise my body too . My limbs are rusty now . 
 Thank you . 
 Are you sick ? 
 Let me take your temperature . 
 Oh , honey , I think you've caught a cold , you should get a shot . 
 Bob and I plan to play hockey in the morning . 
 Well , in the afternoon , after a long nap , we ’ ll go yachting with Nora . 
 How about you ? What are you going to do tomorrow ? 
 Of course ! Of course ! Here you are . Thank you so much . 
 Um , let me see . Hmm . This antique tea set here is gorgeous . 
 Really ? No , no , I couldn't ! You're too nice ! 
 Gee ! I don't know what to say ! Thanks so much . 
 Don't worry , madam . Can you make a description of your baggage ? 
 OK . We will make an announcement for you . Please leave your telephone number , we will call your as soon as we have your baggage . 
 I'd like to see the menu , please . 
 Don't you have any Chinese food ? 
 This sucks . I hate buying lingerie . Okay , just find something and get out of here . Alright , these are fine . Oh , no , don ’ t come over here , don ’ t come over here . 
 Um , I ’ m just having a look around . It ’ s my girlfriend ’ s birthday tomorrow . I'm trying to find her something . 
 Sure that ’ s fine.This is so awkward ... what ones do I pick ? What size is she ? 
 Just pick something and get the hell out of here.Um , I'll go with these two.This is mortifying . I just want to get this over with.She better thank me for this ... 
 Finally ! 
 You're here to make a deposit , is that correct ? 
 No problem . Could I have the cash and your Bank Book , please ? Oh dear ... there seems to be some problems here ... 
 I'm sorry but 5 of these notes seem to be counterfeit . Look at this watermark , do you see it ? 
 To be a revolutionary needs great courage ! 
 Galileo is one of them . 
 Do you believe in horoscope fortune-telling ? 
 That sounds interesting . Have you been involved in any mystery ? 
 What did it say about you then ? 
 But it must have been only a coincidence . That's the only way superstition wins over science . 
 For fun . It serves as a shared topic to them.While they claim to consult the predictions constantly and marvel at their " accuracy ' . they do not necessarily take them seriously . When it that these predictions are matched by their real-life experiences , they delight in spreading the thrill with friends . But if there isn't any correlation between reality and predictions , they just grin , forget about them , and go on living as usual . 
 Isn't it lovely ! That's when she got her Master's Degree from Miami University . 
 Oh , that's a nice one of all of you together . Do you have the negative ? May I have a copy ? 
 No . I'd like a slide , I have a new projector . 
 Have a wallet size print made for me , too . 
 What's your favorite hobby ? 
 What kinds of books do you like to read ? 
 By the way , would you like to see movies ? 
 What do you do in your spare time ? 
 I just like to sleep like a lazy cat . 
 Can I have the window seat over there ? 
 Well , in that case , this table is the only choice . 
 There is no need . Thanks . 
 How long will you stay there ? 
 Where will you live during the vacation . 
 Have you made a reservation ? 
 That's OK . 
 I have booked a table for 3 this evening . I would like to cancel it . 
 Sure . Brown and we have reserved a table next to the door . 
 Shall we have some soup first ? 
 Ok , and what about the main course ? Which would you rather have fish or meat ? 
 Don't you like fish then ? 
 Shall we have some white wine then ? 
 What would you like for dessert ? 
 Fine , and after dinner , shall we go to a disco ? 
 Oh , damn . There ’ s another traffic jam on the highway . 
 There are just too many people , and too many cars . 
 No , they just said it too many people were trying to get off at the Capitol exits . 
 All right , what do you want to listen to ? 
 Yeah , all right . 
 Certainly . What's the matter ? 
 Sure . I often buy things or do business through it without going out to the physical stores . 
 That's simple . Just click the hyperlink , www.taobao.com or www . ebay.com , and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen , and then you can place an order online with the sales company . And the goods will be delivered to your place . 
 No . it's free . 
 I'd like to help pitch in with dinner . 
 No , I'd like to do something special for you on your birthday . 
 OK.Now how can I help , hon ? 
 Easy , I can do that with my eyes closed.Done . 
 How many potatoes do you need ? 
 Gotcha , OK . Here they are . 
 Where is the peeler ? 
 What ? Oh shit ! I cut my finger . 
 I guess cooking is not as easy as I thought . 
 Yes . We went for a walk in the woods near the highway . 
 Yes . It was very cold and windy . We wore heavy wool sweaters and walked quickly to keep warm . 
 Yes . Farther away from the highway it was very quiet and there were birds and squirrels everywhere . We counted over twenty squirrels . 
 Yes , we bought veal sandwiches . We stopped around twelve , and we ate and watched the squirrels , but it was too windy to sit long . It was a very nice walk , anyway . 
 What a girly drink . I'll take a bag of the Blue Mountain and a decaf breva ... 
 Isn't “ frappuccino ” Italian , too ? ... and heat me up a panini . 
 And I'll stick with real coffee . 
 As far as I can see , Westlake Restaurant is a good choice . 
 Walk down till you see the first lights . It's cross the street . 
 It is obvious that their government is nursing the hope of having all other countries over a barrel and bring them completely under their control . 
 What can we do ? 
 There are so many record players here . That is hard to choose . 
 I'd rather get one with separated speakers . They give a clear sound . 
 That's right . Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony . 
 David , have you watched the 82nd Oscar Awards Ceremony ? Avatar got the Award of Visual Effect . The movie sounds great ! 
 How was it ? 
 It is said that The Hurt Locker got the Award of Best Picture . What do you think about this ? 
 How do you feel about teaching my friend how to read ? 
 He's 78 and he's a new emigrant from South America and he's never been to school . 
 No . But I thought that you could start with reading and then go from there . 
 Come on . You're great at teaching and I know you will love him . He's adorable ! 
 Hello . This is John ’ s Distribution . Can I help you ? 
 Are you completely out ? 
 Okay . I ’ ll send someone to deliver it for you tomorrow . 
 No problem . 
 Do you have a reservation ? 
 Wait a second , PLS . Yes , Mr . Lee , we have a room reserved for you . How long do you plan to stay ? 
 Would you sign the register , PLS ? 
 Certainly , every room in this hotel has a private bath . 
 Your room has twin beds , Mr.Lee . It also has a view . I am sure you will like it . This is your key . It's on the eighth floor room 801 . The elevator's over there . 
 The restaurant is on the second floor . We also have a cafeteria on the top floor . If you would like something to drink , you can either call room service or come down here . The bar is right behind the lobby . 
 You are welcome ! 
 Eh , so so . 
 Nah , not too flashy . 
 I guess . 
 And I ’ m trying to watch the game , but you ’ re yapping on about your new clothes ! 
 Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ’ s the third quarter and you ’ Ve been blabbering on since the first ! 
 Oh no you didn ’ t . You didn ’ t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ’ t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ? 
 You mustn't touch the wet paint , Bill . 
 Try to be more careful in future . 
 The workmen oughtn't to leave it without a no tice . 
 Then why isn't there a notice ? 
 But look at them ! They've forgotten about the wet cement and they're walking across it to put up the notice ! 
 I would try to land a job in Beijing . I just want to go to one of the big cities . 
 many say more development opportunities can be found there . 
 and there're higher salaries there . 
 I've considered that . I'll share an apartment with others to save the rent , and the cost of living won't be too much for only one person . 
 oh , we had to break up because she didn't want to float around in Beijing . She insisted on working in her hometown and having a stable life . 
 sure have . I want to offer my parents a better life ; so , I'll have to work very hard . 
 Do you think Tom will be elected president ? 
 Let's make a bet on who gets it . 
 Do you believe that classified ads in the newspaper are the most effective way to search for a job ? 
 OK , but I am going to look at the want ads in this newspaper first . 
 Do you remember John from head office ? 
 Have you heard what happened to him ? 
 He had his car stolen . Actually he was kidnapped while he was in the car . 
 Well , apparently , he was just getting into his car-he'd parked it in one of those underground multi-story things-he was just getting in and suddenly three guys with guns opened the back doors of the car and got in . 
 In Taichung , I think . 
 Really ? Well , anyway , they pointed their guns at him and said , you know , keep calm and drive out . ... we don't want to hurt you ... we just want your car . 
 Well , he drove out , and when he got to the booth to pay the attendant , he pretended to have an epileptic fit , you know , to scare the thieves away . The attendant was no help at all , even though the guys were holding guns in plain view , he did nothing . 
 Yes , makes you think , doesn't it ? 
 Well , he kept on pretending to have a fit , so they freaked out and just ran away . 
 I'll say . 
 I know what you mean . I've started eating better myself . 
 I tend to stick to fruits , vegetables , and chicken . 
 That's basically what I eat . 
 Well , fruits and vegetables are very healthy . 
 It's really healthy to eat when you bake it . 
 I ’ Ve got a new boss . 
 Well , he ’ s got dark hair and brown eyes . 
 And a white sports car . 
 Yes , but he ’ s got a wife and 3 children as well . 
 Good morning ! Welcome to our office ! 
 Nice to meet you too ! I am Peter Smith . 
 Well , hope you will enjoy your first day ! Just ask me if you need any help . 
 You are welcome . 
 Good afternoon , Mrs Smith . 
 Thank you . Yes , I am Dunlin . 
 Many factors led me to major in mechanical engineering . The most important factor is I like tinkering with machines . 
 I like designing products , and one of my designs received an award . Moreover , I am familiar with CAD . But I can do any mechanic well if I am employed . 
 Your company has a very good reputation , and I am very interested in the field your company is in . 
 Interpersonal and technical skills . 
 I have the abilities , qualities and experience that you requested in your job advert , for example I have three years experience in designing products and I got leadership experience while serving the college student union as president . 
 After a few years of gaining experience in the company and furthering my professional qualifications I'd like to put my experience and skills to use in management . I want to become a supervisor in your R & D department . 
 Yes . Do you offer any opportunities for further study ? 
 That's fine . 
 No . 
 Thank you , Mrs . Smith . I do hope the answer will be favorable . Goodbye . 
 There is one around the corner . 
 Yes , but you have to get a phone card first . 
 You can get one in the grocery store over there . 
 Do you hear what happened to Sally ? 
 She had to go to the hospital . 
 She passed out in class . Seems she hadn't eaten anything in days . 
 Yeah , but that's what she did . 
 Well , it's not just the girl ’ s fault . It's also society's fault - magazines and ads that show - thin models all saying , It's in to be thin . It's hard for them not to listen . 
 I think I may try to eat a little better . 
 What do you eat ? 
 That's it ? 
 How is that the only thing that you'll eat ? 
 So , what about the chicken ? 
 That sounds delicious and nutritious . 
 Hello , may I speak to you for a few minutes ? 
 I want to speak to you about this year ’ s election . 
 Yes , I am a volunteer for the campaign . 
 I feel that history is about to be made , and I want to be a part of it . 
 Will you be voting ? 
 Make sure you make it to your polling place early on Election Day . 
 This is No . 1 bus , bound for Sihun . 
 There are another six stops . 
 Is it Wangfujing ? 
 OK . 
 Thank you . 
 Is this where I get off ? 
 Excuse me , I don't feel good right now . 
 Do you have any pills for airsickness ? 
 Please fetch me a glass of water . Thanks . 
 There isn't much rice , is there ? 
 Are there any potatoes ? 
 I'm very hungry , Donald . What can I eat ? 
 But I want some rice and some meat . 
 Good . By the way , who's going to cook the meat ? 
 Mike , come and look at this painting of shrimp ! It is so simple yet so vivid ! 
 Yes , it is . How do you know that ? 
 Cool ! What kind of Chinese painting do you prefer , free sketch or claborate-style painting ? 
 That's true . Chinese art stresses the harmony between man and nature , which is an important part of China's traditional culture . 
 So do I . Let ’ s go to other areas to see what they have got , shall we ? 
 Excuse me ? I didn't hear what you said . 
 I am new to this school and not familiar with this library . Can you help me ? 
 I'm looking for information on tropical fish . 
 Great , thank you . 
 Consumer Credit Department . How may I help you ? 
 Certainly . Do you currently bank with us ? 
 That's excellent . Well , for our Personal Automobile Consumer Loan we offer some really competitive rates . The maximum repayment period for this type of loan is 5 years . 
 Of course , the interest rates depend on what is announced at the time , but at the moment , the interest for a 2 - year loan is 5.29 % 
 We usually set up a direct debit system taking installments directly from your bank account on a monthly basis . And since you are already a valued customer , there should be no trouble in processing you application for this loan . 
 Oh , no ! My stub ! I can't believe it — I flushed it down the toilet ! 
 But , but ... it was really an emergency ! And , my stub ... 
 Ah , umm , kind of . 
 Well , I , umm , I flushed it ... 
 Yes . This is Bob Robinson . I ’ m calling from room number 627 . 
 Is it possible to change to another room ? 
 My room is facing the swimming pool . It ’ s noisy for me . I have a problem sleeping . And I feel uncomfortable when I take an elevator . 
 You ’ re right . 
 Thank you . 
 That ’ s fine . Can I move now ? 
 Oh , thank you kindly . 
 Let's decide what to order . 
 The works ? 
 Anything to drink ? 
 I'll have a sandwich and small fries . Would you like to have some desserts ? 
 I'd like to have an ice cream 
 From my own experience as a career woman , I would have to say that while things are getting better now than they used to be , it is still a widespread problem . Society is changing , but there is still a glass ceiling for women in many career tracks . 
 I think it's a very complicated issue . A part of the difficulties women have advancing in the work force are due to few opportunities and many male managers . Don't underestimate the good ole ' boy system . Men have power , so it's easier for them to stay in power . 
 Affirmative action has given us management quotas and bans sexual discrimination , but it's still a man's world . 
 It is my honor to have this chance for this interview . Well , my major is commercial English . You know , and I am not only familiar with useful English expressions in business , but also learn some theories on this field . Besides , during my college learning period , I also attended some commercial activities to strive for the opportunity of practicing what I learned . 
 Well , I was a diligent student when I stayed in my college . I dislike meeting the deadline , when I am working on a project . I am always willing to complete it well ahead of the schedule . 
 Well , I lost my grandpa when I was only ten . I often recall the period when he fed me . 
 I will start my work at the beginning of next month . 
 I don't know , what's wrong ? 
 Maybe you should ask him openly . 
 Thank you . I'm wearing make-up . 
 It's me . I have studied make-up at a beauty shop . 
 Of course . First , use eye shadow to heighten your eyes . 
 I think pink eye shadow is popular among Chinese girls . 
 I suggest you use lipstick , which also accentuates your lips . 
 You have to pay attention to trimming them from time to time . 
 Yes . I was Propaganda department minister of our university . 
 No . It ’ s a pity about it . 
 Yes . I was a member of the basketball Society . I like playing basketball . 
 I sometimes played basketball and sometimes played football . 
 What's so great about it ? 
 Not to me , I wouldn't be caught dead in that . 
 Yeah , you seem to like those styles . 
 This one looks really expensive though . 
 Lucky you ! I can't buy anything else . I'm flat broke . 
 Why did you drag me into this ? I've spent a week salary . 
 Just joking , Tonia . I've got some wonderful clothes . Let's go and have a close look at your outfit . 
 I'm going to Disneyland . 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Well , that's really a big city . How long do your vacations last ? 
 Here you are . Take your time . 
 Hello , yes , I'm a stock investor and I'm looking at opening a new account with you . Perhaps your new compound savings one ? I already have a Current Account with you . 
 I'm mostly interested in the personalized services you offer , with stock market news , etc . It sounds just perfect for me , as I'm too busy to be constantly at the computer checking the performance . 
 What I need to know is how I can keep track of what's going on . I mean , some days I buy and sell quite a lot . Some days , there's no activity at all . 
 That's just what I need , sometimes I'm pretty forgetful . 
 Hi , this is Emily Wang , I want to see a doctor today . 
 GRM 789051 
 No . But it is urgent , and I need to see a doctor as soon as possible . I am really in bad shape . 
 I have a high fever and a bad headache . 
 Yes , I took my temperature last night . It was 102 degrees . But right now I feel my fevers is up to 103 degrees . 
 I can not stop coughing , and I can not stop sneezing . I vomited blood last night . Sorry , I am coughing again . 
 What time should I come ? 
 Ok . Thank you very much . 
 No , thanks . 
 What are you unhappy with ? 
 If you agree to pay more money , you could upgrade the carpet . 
 It could be as little as 2 dollars or as much as 10 dollars more per square yard . 
 Bring me a paint sample to look at , and I will consider it . 
 Your new apartment can be recarpeted and repainted by next Tuesday . 
 Hi , Linda . I have two concert complimentary tickets . Will you go with me tonight ? 
 It will be held at the Central Music Hall . 
 It ’ s a piano solo . I'm fond of piano , you know . 
 Let ’ s meet at the park at 6:00 . 
 Can I get some medicine to help me ? 
 What types of drugs can I try ? 
 What about side effects from that medication ? 
 Do I only need to take that one drug ? 
 What can I expect when I take that medication ? 
 Is everything all right ? 
 What's the problem ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 He didn't hurt you , did he ? 
 I'm so sorry . 
 Let me take you . 
 Good day , Madam . What service do you require today ? 
 It's possible to sign an agreement with us , and then we can pay your staff directly . That is called an Entrustment Agreement . 
 We can transfer the funds each month , at your request , into each employee's account . It is possible to pay in cash or to pay directly to the employee's savings account , no matter which bank they do business with . 
 Not at all . We can adjust the payment methods depending on the requirement of each employee . 
 I don't understand why I'm being arrested . 
 A warrant for what ? 
 What does that mean ? 
 I wasn't aware that I had to go to court . 
 I don't find this fair . 
 Don't I have any rights ? 
 do you have any plans for Friday night ? 
 well , my hosue-mates and I are having a house-warming party . Would you like to come ? 
 the more , the merrier ! 
 I sure hope so . We've each invited about 10 people . 
 I'm inviting my friends from work , you , my sister , and a few friends from school . 
 don't worry.You won't be sitting there by yourself . 
 most people are working Friday night , so it's going to start around 9 pm . 
 we'll have beer and snacks , but if you want to bring a bottle of wine , that'd be great . 
 that'd be great . I'll see you then ! 
 But , Mom , I'm not dirty . 
 Why ? 
 I don't smell bad . 
 If I smelled bad , I could smell me . 
 I can smell you , too . 
 When can I wear perfume ? 
 Right . With the establishment of Internet and a lot of web companies , people are getting more and more dependent on the web . 
 Can you tell me how it is done ? 
 I see . So great . 
 I would like to have my clothes washed . What's the rate ? 
 OK , here are the clothes . 
 She is really pretty , isn't she ? Her skin looks so baby-smooth ! 
 Ah , I can smell jealousy in the air . 
 Yeah , right . But what did you put on your face last night ? Those little greenish things . 
 Yeah , yeah , yeah ! They wipe out tight , tired feelings and remove lines and age signs . Blah , blah ... See , I can even recite it . 
 You look terrific and in good shape . 
 How do you keep fit ? 
 Yoga ? It sounds interesting . 
 Anything else ? 
 Are you interested in swimming ? 
 Do you work well under pressure ? 
 Do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ? 
 How soon can you begin working for us ? 
 I'm sorry , but I don't think this damage is our fault . 
 It looks like the shipping company did this . 
 Stephen , can you work overtime tonight ? 
 The holiday is coming so we need to finish our task . 
 Yes . The contract must be kept . 
 Did he say why ? 
 Don't worry . I will tell him about that . 
 Thank you for that . And I will double your pay . 
 And what did you decide ? 
 I'm glad you saw the reason . 
 What kind of rooms do you want ? 
 No problem . Your room numbers are 201 and 204 . 
 Now , Mr.William , a little personal information first , are you married ? 
 What's your major ? 
 How long have you been study in German ? 
 And just one more question , would you like to be an interpreter ? 
 Very good , you can come here to work next month . 
 What dressing would you like on the salad ? 
 I beg your pardon ? 
 Sorry , it's not available now.Anything else ? 
 Will you say it again ? 
 Good evening , Yanking Restaurant . 
 Certainly , sir . For how many people , please ? 
 Of course . May I have your name , please ? 
 Can you spell that , please ? 
 Thank you , Mr . William . Goodbye . 
 Yes , I am , thank you . I'll have three scrambled eggs with country ham , toast and jam , please . 
 I'll have a tomato juice and some iced tea . 
 Could I have a slice of pumpkin pie ? 
 Thank you very much for everything you have done for me during my stay in China . 
 The help is mutual . I must thank you to see me off . My wife and I will be looking forward to seeing you . You will come to see us , won't you ? 
 Hi Sam , would you like to come for a curry with us next Friday ? 
 Jane , Susan , Pete and two colleagues of mine from work . 
 Susan suggested the one on Main Street . She says it is very good . 
 You know , the one just on the corner with Oxford Street . There is a large pharmacy next door . 
 Okay then . I think we will all meet outside ? 
 At 8 o'clock . I will make the reservation . 
 What problems will exporters face in moving to the foreign market ? 
 Like what ? 
 Reasonable . 
 Sometimes people in different countries , or even in different parts of the same country have varying outlooks because of the tribe and culture . 
 It's convenient . People in network go everywhere by subway if they don't drive . 
 What's the difference ? 
 What can you see from a tram or a double-decker ? 
 But they are not as convenient as the subway . 
 Well , maybe you are right . We'll be more amused in a tram or a double-decker than on the subway . 
 What about the tickets ? I've already bought them . 
 I firmly believe that if we invested in funds we could earn a lot of money . 
 The world changes , the family changes too . 
 People now like a small family composed of two parents and one child . 
 I don't like such a family . 
 I like a family composed of many people . It includes grandparents , parents , aunts and uncles , and children . 
 We can live well , I think . 
 I'm afraid he is not in at the moment . 
 I suppose he won't come back until 6 p . m . By the way , do you want to call later , or would you like to leave a message ? 
 Okay , I'll do that . 
 You're welcome , bye ! 
 That's good ! This is our first transaction . I hope you'll be entirely satisfied with this initial shipment . 
 Have you ever tried shopping online ? 
 That's right . Seeing is believing . 
 That happens . Without close quality examination , we may encounter fraud , and the e-shop may suddenly disappear . 
 It's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . Paying online is much safer than before , but I still have the feeling that it's not safe enough . 
 Me too . Sometimes I surf online shops to check some related information , and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping . 
 Is there a problem , officer ? 
 I'm sorry , I didn't even notice it . 
 I honestly couldn't see it because of the bushes growing over it . 
 I swear that I didn't mean to run it . 
 Are you going to give me a ticket today , sir ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Have you enjoyed your weekend ? 
 Not at all . We've really enjoyed having you . I hope you'll come and stay again next time you're in Changsha . 
 I'd like two kilos of eggs . 
 Do you have the eggs with the red yolk ? 
 Why ? 
 Oh , My God ! That's terrible . 
 Then give me the ordinary ones . 
 Yes , I like it very much . 
 Where is it ? 
 Have you visited it before ? 
 Like what ? 
 Sounds marvelous . 
 Great . I will prepare some clothes and food for the climbing . 
 Premium or regular , Madam ? 
 No problem , Madam . Should I check the air in the spare tyre as well ? 
 Should I clean the windshield for you ? 
 All right , Madam . It's ok . There is hardly any water in the radiator . It's dangerous , Madam . You could break down , because of the heat you know . 
 Anything you say , Madam . 
 No , we don't . I am sorry . It's 30 dollars and 10 cents in total . 
 Thank you , Madam . Have a nice drive ! 
 Recently it's been pretty good , actually . 
 Well , yes . Thanks , there's no trouble at the moment . 
 I'm going to need a Deposit Certification , to handle the affairs related to home . 
 I don't make idle threats . 
 I hope you're not turning into a sissy on me , Dave . 
 If we let Vince and Elvin continue to run things , invoking is going to fail . 
 I'm saying this ship needs a new captain . Are you with me , or aren't you ? 
 Sorry , I don't know , there's something wrong with my watch . 
 In the coming , before going to work . 
 OK . I'll turn it on . 
 Well , I'm setting my watch at four . Thank you . 
 this is the route I thought we could take on our hike on Saturday afternoon . 
 it ’ s about six or seven miles . That ’ s about the kilometers . 
 right . Then we turn left and walk up this small hill . The view from the top of the hill is worth the climb . We can eat a snack there . 
 we can spend a few minutes looking around the church . Then , we turn right and walk along this path . 
 yes , we can , but it isn ’ t very interesting . 
 that ’ s right . 
 I think it will take about four hours , including breaks . 
 yes , there are . They tell use which way to go and how far we have to walk . 
 The Bible says that Jesus Christ was resurrected three days after he was crucified . People commemorate that at a festival called Easter . 
 We celebrate it on the first Sunday after a full moon on or after the 21st of March . 
 We make a lot of Easter eggs and then paint some designs on them . We'll also go to church and pray . 
 What ’ s the first thing you do when you go to the bathroom in the morning ? 
 Do you usually shower or take a bath ? 
 Do you shave every morning ? 
 Do you brush your teeth twice a day as dentists recommend ? 
 Your dentist must be proud of you ! 
 I seem to have lost my train ticket . 
 I ’ m supposed to be going to shanghai . 
 It ’ s supposed to leave in 30 minutes . 
 S M I T H . 
 Z3264356 . 
 Is there anything you can do for me ? If I don ’ t make it to shanghai in time , my wife is going go kill me . 
 How much is that going to cost me ? 
 I can ’ t possibly travel on a hard seat for 10 hours ! 
 Yes , fine . Let me see how much money I have in my wallet . 
 Where ’ s my wallet ? Someone has stolen my wallet ! 
 You ’ re right . It is . Let me have a look . I have 419.6 RIB . is that enough ? 
 Thanks , ma ’ am . You ’ re a lifesaver ! 
 Cross the street and walk two blocks west.You can't miss it . 
 Do you like travelling ? 
 Do you usually travel by bus ? 
 Would you pour me some of that tea , please ? 
 Hi , Mr . Zhang . What ’ s wrong ? You don ’ t look so happy . How was your date ? 
 Me ? I ’ m even less experienced than you are . 
 Believe it or not , I guess American women like a man in good shape , which Chinese women may not care about so much . That ’ s my honest opinion . I know you have been trying very hard . 
 No , that ’ s not true . I ’ Ve met two American women who were married to Chinese . But those Chinese look very strong and healthy . So if you exercise more often , I bet it will surely be easier for you to date American girls . How old is Jacky Chan ? He ’ s small and short . But I bet he can have any American woman he wants . 
 Why don ’ t you try then ? Even if it doesn ’ t help you find an American girl , you could still have a stronger and healthier body . You won ’ t lose anything by doing that . 
 I wanted to go , but I couldn't . 
 It's too bad that I couldn't make it . Who won ? 
 I really wish I went to the game . 
 So tell me the final score . 
 It must've been a close game . 
 Hopefully , I'll make it to the next one . 
 There ’ s an interesting interview with a top fashion designer about the latest fashions . I enjoyed reading her thought . The which ? section is very interesting this month . They tested facial cleaners . T 
 Which tests do you mean ? 
 Oh , I see . I like to do those tests , too , but I don ’ t take them seriously . 
 You ’ re right . It ’ s sometimes hard to tell which pages are advertisement and which ones are articles . 
 Sony or some other brands ? 
 No , it's free . 
 I'm very sorry I can't . 
 I've been snowed under with since my bosses away on business . 
 Hmm , I want to change my traveler's cheque . Here is a traveler's cheque of 3,000 dollars . I would like to cash this cheque , please . 
 Sure . How about my passport ? 
 I want 20 hundred bills and the rest in fifties , please . 
 Thank you and bye-bye ! 
 Good , thanks . How about you ? 
 Why ? 
 But your company is huge . Can't they afford to pay the staff decent wages ? 
 Why don't you give them a suggestion ? 
 How do you like other films starring Charlie Chaplin ? 
 You don't like the performance , do you ? 
 Good morning , and welcome to our bank . What can I do for you today ? 
 What seems to be the problem ? 
 I see . Well , you have two choices ; you can renew it or redeem it . Which would you prefer ? 
 Not a problem . But may I just inform you that we have introduced a new service called Account Renewing upon Maturity ? 
 You see , that means when anything is up for renewal , we do it automatically and you don't have to physically come here to sort it out . All you need to do is sign here and we'll set it all up for you . 
 How about overtime work ? 
 Do you like regular work ? 
 Excuse me . How much for one are these ? 
 OK . Say I was to buy four , could I get a discount ? 
 Oh , I was hoping to get one free . Like four for 75 dollars . 
 Hey , Joshua ! Is Anny coming with us ? 
 Nothing . I'm just asking . 
 Who has a crush ? 
 I'd totally die if she turned me down . 
 Good morning , Room Service . May I help you ? 
 OK , sir . We offer two types of lunch , Chinese food and western food . Which one would you prefer ? 
 Rice , egg , beef and vegetables . 
 I see . May I have your name and room number , please ? 
 Let me confirm your order , Mr . White in Room 204 , Chinese food . Is that right ? 
 Your order will be ready soon , thank you for calling . 
 It's about twelve hours . 
 Sure . Let me see ... at 6:15 a . m . local time . 
 And that'll be 10:15 p . m . Beijing time . 
 I am sorry too . I know we've been talking about this beach trip for a while . I should have told Bob I was busy this weekend . 
 thanks for understanding . 
 hey , what if the three of us go to the beach together ? Besides , you and Bob haven't seen each other for a while . I don't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers . 
 I know Bob won't mind . You can bring a date , like that guy from the bar you keep talking about . 
 Mr . Rogers ? 
 I'm not feeling too well . 
 Yes , I would . 
 I can manage on my own . Thanks . 
 I decided to give it a go ! 
 A DENY shirt and one of Serena Williams ' used tennis rackets ! 
 Yep . I placed a bid for the shirt . The minimum was ten so I bet fifty ! 
 Well , there was a sign that said “ Buy now for seventy . ” 
 Hi , I'm here to look at the one-bedroom apartment you have for rent . 
 ( They walk over to the apartment . ) As you can see , it's large and completely furnished . 
 You have to pay the electricity bill yourself , but water is paid . 
 Where can I find the produce ? 
 What sales do they have today ? 
 I have a little problem with room 507 . 
 I found cockroaches in my room . 
 I've seen at least nine different cockroaches in my room . 
 There are nine cockroaches in my room . I don't have time for your disbelief ! 
 Do you like jazz , Tom ? 
 Well , yes , I do . I'm a real fan of Wanton Marsalis . 
 No , he doesn't ! ! ! He plays the trumpet . So , what kind of music do you like ? 
 Who's your favorite group ? 
 No , I don't . I can't stand them ! ! 
 Oh , yes ? 
 Mmm . 
 Really ? 
 Oh , yeah , that's embarrassing when that happens . 
 We're going out to dinner and then to the movies . 
 Don't worry . I've got money . It's my treat . 
 I think we should home school our children when we decide to have kids . 
 Well , our public schools here are not very good and private school are just too expensive . I have been reading up on home schooling and it has a lot of advantages . 
 Well , first of all , I would be able to teach them everything they learn in school in a more relaxed and fun way . I also think that having a one-on-one class is much better since you can focus more on his or her strengths or weaknesses . 
 I will bring it up over Sunday brunch . 
 Where are you from , Laura ? 
 Oh , so you're from South America . 
 Oh , right . My geography isn't very good ! 
 Yeah . There's nobody in sight . 
 I think you're right . Let's go . 
 Are you deaf or what ? 
 Get a hold of yourself , Bruce . You'll get over her eventually . 
 Oh , how could it be ? 
 OK . Wait a minute . 
 Yes . It's really snowing . 
 But don't you think it's a little too cold ? 
 You are so interesting . 
 Look , we need to have the Stars.com account , right ? 
 And to get it , we have to beat WebTracker to the punch . 
 That's why I promised that invoking would be up and running by the end of next week . 
 I ’ ll have the kung PAO chicken , please . 
 Just some fried rice please . 
 No , thanks . 
 Good morning , sir . Can I help you ? 
 Yes , we have a great variety of Chinese antiques . 
 Well , we have some painting and some porcelain . Which do you like better ? 
 Good . How about the table set ? 
 It's made in Jingdezhen . 
 One thousand eight hundred yuan . 
 We hope that partial shipment is allowed . 
 Shipping the goods is to be made in three equal monthly installments . 
 What're you going to wear today ? 
 You'd better tuck in your shirt . 
 Look , it's all water over the dam now . Let's leave it behind us . 
 Our eyes should look into the future . We could not live in the past . 
 It's normal . Time will change everything . 
 No , this is just my appetizer ... this is my lunch ! 
 This is good food , it has milk , fruit , grains , nuts ... 
 At least I enjoy my lunch ! What's in your bag ? 
 There's the difference , your wife made it ! I have to make my own lunch ! 
 if you have a few minutes , I'd like to talk to you about my future at this company . 
 thanks . 
 I've worked here as a sales representative for about a year now . 
 yes , but I'd like to have a chance at job advancement . 
 well , I've noticed that is a position available as a sales manager . 
 yes . I would be directly responsible for all of the sales representatives in my department . I assume there'd be more meetings , paperwork , and other responsibilities , too . 
 yes . In fact if you look at my resume , you can see that I was a manager before I started this job . 
 ok . Thanks for your support . 
 I'm sorry , but you were the only one who had access to it . 
 Yes , I do it a lot.but I don't like doing dishes.what about you , do you like cooking and then cleaning up afterwards ? 
 Suppose you have to do one of the two , which do you prefer ? 
 I prefer the absent.the way I see it , to do the dishes is boring . 
 What ? 
 Will you do the dishes after the meal ? 
 There are so many people that the tickets are all sold out ! 
 Look , Danny . The Four Great Inventions ! 
 I really admire those who made such great inventions ! 
 They look simple today . But they were milestones in their times . 
 Just think Bill Gates , those inventions are as important as the windows system . 
 No , quite the contrary . 
 Yes , but they went to the public without any patent protection . 
 Good afternoon.Swiss Airline.Miss Grown speaking . Can I help you ? 
 Just a moment , please . Let me check for you . ( A moment later ) Thank you for waiting . I am sorry but our flights are fully booked on that day.The next available flight leaves at 4:00 pm on 20th . Shall I reserve you a seat on it ? 
 John , I ’ d like you to meet Charles Brown , our new manager at the airport . 
 He is short , well-built , and he ’ s got light blond hair . 
 He has a mustache , if I remember correctly , and a light complexion . 
 He is in his late thirties . 
 At 2 thirty . 
 Too bad . I did anyway . 
 I brought Strawberry Sticks . See ? 
 Yep . And there's real strawberry chunks in the coating . 
 Could we have the bill , please ? 
 That's alright . Here you are . 
 Sure . What do you need ? 
 Well , first you have to turn this switch on . 
 Now press this button . 
 Just a second . I ’ ll go get some . 
 Good morning . Can I use my cellular phone during this time ? 
 Thank you . What should I do if I want to phone my family during the flight ? 
 So I can use the onboard phone during the flight ? 
 Hello . What can I do for you today ? 
 Really ? Have you checked everything carefully ? 
 Ah , I see . The goods description is totally different from what you are expecting , right ? 
 Usually , if the problem is insignificant I advise the customer to go ahead ; it's normally a translation problem or something like that . But this does seem a little more serious . I suggest you get back on to them right now and ask them about it . Hopefully you can sort it out over the phone . 
 Excuse me . Miss , what does the doctor say about me ? When can I be discharged ? 
 Great , thanks . But how can I get discharged ? 
 Yes , I will . Thanks for your care . 
 It's my geography , sir . The Map of Africa you set us . 
 Yes , I know , sir . I'm sorry . 
 My mother's been ill and I had to stay at home . 
 It's true , sir . 
 Hi . I ’ m calling about your continuing education program . 
 I want to become certified in computer programming . Do you offer any part-time courses for adult further education ? 
 How do I sign up ? 
 Great ! 
 It's cool . 
 Please take us to Harvard University . By the way , is it far from here ? 
 ( Get here ) Here we are , sir . 
 It ’ s 35 dollars on the meter . 
 Thank you . Have a nice day . 
 Is there anything special they would like to do ? 
 That can easily be arranged . I will arrange a comfortable meeting room for them . Anything else ? 
 I will set it up . 
 Welcome . How can I help you ? 
 All right . We have quite a selection for you to choose from . There are double rooms with twin beds , suites , if you'd like , we have presidential suite on the top floor . 
 All right sir . How many nights will you be staying ? 
 OK . I'll just need to see a credit card and passport . 
 What is the rate for a double room for one night ? 
 What about the features in the room ? 
 Does the TV have cable ? 
 I don't stand a chance of passing the exam . 
 I see you just graduated from college . What was your GPA ? 
 Why do you think it wasn ’ t higher than that ? 
 Wo , wo , that certainly is a lot for a young man to take on . 
 Would you please show me that mural ? 
 It looks so beautiful . How much is it ? 
 That's a bit more than I wanted to pay . Can you cut the price down a bit ? 
 Maybe you are right . OK , I'll take it . 
 Thank you . Here is four hundred yuan . 
 How are you feeling , Flora ? 
 What did you watch today ? 
 And next ? 
 I know what you mean , there wasn't old action movie next . I think you won't like it . 
 Anything important happened ? 
 Excuse me.sir . Can I have look at the timetable please ? 
 Is flight ZW203 a direct one ? 
 No . Is there any direct flight to New York ? 
 It ’ s time for me to go now . 
 I ’ d rather you stayed in the office and did these things . 
 I ’ d rather you typed it . 
 I ’ d rather you told her . 
 The train station is indeed crowded . I think it ’ s hard for us to get on the train . 
 I'd like to rent a car , please . 
 Full-size , please . What's the rate ? 
 And I'd like to have insurance just in case . 
 No . 
 All right . I'll take it . 
 How about this one ? 
 Just one day . 
 Is the international driving licence fine ? 
 Nice day , isn't it ? 
 It's a good day for a picnic . 
 Fun for you ! Do you get to do anything you want ? 
 Does everyone usually show up for your family reunions ? 
 How Ay days will the reunion be ? 
 This is going to be a major production for you ! 
 That is very kind of you , Mr Lee . Thank you . 
 Of course . It ’ s a terrible night , isn ’ t it ? 
 Thank you . 
 Yes . I would like to check in . 
 Yes . I am Belen . 
 No , what's the difference ? 
 Excuse me . How much is the chocolate bar ? 
 So , I can have five for five dollars ? 
 Oh , yeah . I forgot tax . Give me four then , please . 
 Hi , I'm Benjamin . Nice to meet you here . You look great . 
 No , this is the second time . But I also feel bad because of the lower pressure and the jet lag . 
 Oh , that's too bad . Do you get a good knowledge of China ? 
 All of the Chinese are proud of the Great Wall . And it was built before the In dynasty near Shan Haiguan-the First Pass in the World . 
 No , before the In dynasty . 
 Both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . And I usually refresh myself with a cup of tea . 
 Do you like the Chinese traditional silk ? 
 Go and pick some stuff up . The price can always surprise foreign friends . 
 Good morning . I ’ m from the new york book review . Could I ask you some question about your latest book ? 
 First , I ’ Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story . 
 How do you research your books ? 
 I really like your books . I ’ Ve just finished this one . I read it from cover to cover in a single day . Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again ! 
 Oh ! Thank you very much . I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories . What are the stories about ? 
 Thanks very much . I ’ m sure it will sell well . I can ’ t wait to read it . Here ’ s my card . Thank you for you time . 
 Sorry , we haven't made the decision at all . 
 We will let you know probably next Monday . I hope to give you a positive reply . 
 Mike , these flowers are just gorgeous . 
 I can ’ t thank you enough . I ’ m really touched . I don ’ t know what to say . 
 You ’ re the best ! 
 In comparison to city life , the country life is quiet and peaceful . 
 Yeah , I agree.Every wall has two sides . 
 I was able to contact them so , if you ’ ll step into my office , we ’ ll talk . 
 They want you to pick up the cost of the home inspection , but they accepted your offer . 
 It can cost between five hundred and one thousand dollars . 
 Yes , you get to choose . I would spend a little more to get a really thorough inspection . 
 I am going to contact the sellers immediately . They were looking forward to your acceptance . 
 Actually , Miao Ping , I'm here to close my account with you . I'm going home , the company is transferring me back to London . 
 Next week , so I thought it was better to get this all sorted out as soon as possible . 
 Here you are , Miao Ping . Don't laugh at the horrible photo today , OK ? 
 Oh , that's right . You are supposed to deliver a brief on that account tomorrow . I know there are some things I need to share with you about that . But , gosh , I don't know ... Things are really busy for me today , the only time I can manage to squeeze out might be over lunch break ... 
 It's okay ... I've already had several days in a row working through lunch ... 
 You don't have to do that ... 
 Actually I do like Chinese ... Let's make it a date for Chop Suey and the Martin account at about twelve thirty . Does that sound good ? 
 Hi , Brad . How are you today ? 
 No problem . Is this the only one ? 
 It's time for bed . 
 It's already half past eleven . You have school tomorrow . You'll sleepy all tomorrow , if you don't sleep well tonight . 
 Don't you have the exams coming up soon ? I'm sure you could spend more time preparing for those . 
 You do well in maths , but your history is not good enough . Am I right ? 
 An excellent idea . Work now and play later . 
 No , now it's bedtime . 
 Oh , yes . Mother's Day is coming . Do you plan to buy anything ? 
 Hmm . In Carrefour , Clinique will be promoting their visible skin renewed cream . 
 180 yuan , and you can get a free 8 piece gift package . 
 Some black mascara , moisturizing orion , eye cream crystal lipstick , a two color eye shadow pack , styling hairspray , and a cosmetics bag . 
 Advance Reservations . Can I help you ? 
 Could you tell me your name , sir , please ? 
 I believe you ordered the Grand Slam breakfast . 
 Oh , I just noticed that I accidentally brought you your friend's breakfast . 
 And pancakes for you , sir . 
 I am sorry that I misheard you . 
 I will get straight back to you with your waffles . 
 Remember that writing contest I entered ? Well , I won first prize . 
 You're going to get into a lot of trouble if you do that . 
 I don't see anything wrong with what we're doing ! That's just the problem . In these kind of things , the trouble doesn't always appear at first . 
 Everything has gone as smooth as clockwork . Just like we planned ! That may be true , but if you were to do it , you would have trouble on the horizon . You always say that . 
 Okay . Have it your way , but don't say I didn't warn you . 
 Yes , I would like to check in . 
 Yes , my name is Steven Smith . I have a reservation from October 2nd to October 6th . I called last week . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 OK . By the way , where is the restaurant ? 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , it is . Thanks . I ’ m just surfing on the internet . 
 This cafe offers a wireless internet connection . That means I can get on the net for free while I ’ m here . Of course , I have to buy a cup of coffee ! 
 No . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city . 
 I ’ Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs . 
 It ’ s wonderful , isn ’ t it ? Would you like to see some photos that I look recently ? 
 Here you are , sir . 
 I am from China . 
 No , nothing . 
 Sure . 
 Yup . 
 No , it's my camera for personal use . 
 No , please don't . It's is for my personal use . 
 Almost all are for my friends in the States . 
 Let me see . Oh , No . 11 . 
 Seats No . 20 and 21 . It ’ s nice that we ’ Ve got a window seat . 
 Oh , the baggage rack is full . Put them under the seat for the time being . 
 What would you like on your pizzas ? 
 Would you like anything to drink with that ? For $ 1.50 , you can get a two-liter bottle of Coke . 
 All right . That'll be $ 12.50 . Your pizzas will be there in 30 minutes . 
 Do you think we should travel by bus or by train ? 
 We could face delays if we travel by bus , thanks to traffic jams . 
 That ’ s true , but I feel that I see more when I travel by bus . 
 So , which form of transport do you prefer to use ? 
 Ok them . We ’ ll go by train . I ’ m sure we ’ ll have a good journey . Shall we go to the station and buy the tickets ? 
 We should take a packed lunch on the journey . The food they sell on the trains is always expensive . 
 Thanks a lot . That's the favor I was going to ask you for . 
 Only one . But I wanted to make sure I'd get it . 
 But there are only two more days until the bidding closes ! 
 Oh ... I'm such a newbie . But at least I'm sure I'll get that tennis racket . 
 Well ... guess how low the bidding starts on the tennis racket ? 
 I needed to get out of the house . My parents just went ballistic over something my older sister told them . 
 Nothing that serious . She finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend . 
 That's putting it mildly . My father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her . 
 She started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend , how they're in love and it's not hurting anybody , and so on . My dad said she's too young to do this , and that she should move out right away . 
 Three years . They've been dating since freshman year . They're even talking about marriage . 
 What do you mean ? 
 I guess so . Better to find out now than after you're married , when it's harder to get out . 
 How do you pay for it ? 
 Tell me if you need help . 
 I am calling about the advertisement for a flat with a bedroom . Do you still have it ? 
 Is there any furniture in it ? 
 What's the rent for a year ? 
 Where is it located ? 
 That's great . But can't you make the rent cheaper , Let's see , 12,000 yuan ? 
 OK . I will be free tomorrow afternoon . I'll take a taxi to get there . See you . 
 I don't dare ask Jane for a date . 
 How do you feel ? 
 Here is the bigger size . 
 What's wrong with you , young man ? 
 Do you have a fever ? 
 Let me examine you.Don ' t worry.It ' s nothing serious . 
 Yes , stay in bed and drink a lot of water.Your fever will be gone in a day or two . 
 Of course not.You need a good rest . 
 That's right . And I'm going to be Vice President of Marketing . 
 You can say that again ! 
 They work for Zina now . 
 They're in awe of her . After they saw how she crushed WebTracker ... but I guess you know all about that . 
 I'm looking for a black , leather bag . 
 I'm just looking . 
 Lester , you are really fantastic at automobile repair . 
 That ’ s not a big problem . There are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified . 
 And you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school , or from the government . 
 What can I do for you , Madam ? 
 Certainly , Madam . What would you like to know ? 
 All right . We can grant a Financing Promise Quota , if you qualify . This means that we can deal with all of your needs in a speedy and efficient way . Firstly , your Credit Rating must be class A , and your Debt to Asset Ratio must be top notch , for the industry you are involved in . 
 Sure , Mum.In a minute . 
 Yes , Mum . 
 Yes , sir . We have the all-inclusive luxury cruise . Maybe you would like to look at the itinerary . 
 Yes . What about this one ? 
 Let me see . Here it is . 
 I ’ m afraid I can ’ t because I ’ m a stranger here . 
 Not at all . You can ask the policeman over there . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , I do . 
 Yes , it's Mr . Brown . 
 Oh , this is just fine . 
 Thank you . 
 This is awful ! It's like drinking saltwater ! It's like drowning in the ocean ! 
 OK , OK . 
 Maybe I'll run away first . 
 Do you have a reservation ? 
 I'm afraid we have no reservation by this name . 
 I'm afraid all the rooms are fully booked . 
 You're right.We have no more rooms available for tonight . 
 OK , I'll call ahead . 
 I ’ d like to go into management . I ’ Ve applied for several jobs already and I ’ m hopeful that I ’ ll get some job offers . How about you ? 
 we both have to overcome several obstacles if we are to achieve our ambitions . 
 unfortunately , it ’ s inevitable that some people are going to work hard yet not succeed . 
 as long as you plan carefully , most thing are possible . It ’ s always good to have a backup plan in case things go wrong . 
 my father wanted me to become a doctor , but I knew it would be impossible for me to be successful in that field . 
 I'm so angry at Bob for buying a new bike . 
 I'd like to go to Suzhou next week . Do you know how to get there by train ? 
 I see . Do you know how much the ticket is ? 
 Is it far from here to Suzhou ? 
 How long will it take to get there ? 
 Hello . Can I ask what steps I have to go through in applying for the job ? 
 What is the next step ? 
 We'd better cover the porcelain ware against All Risks . 
 I'd like to have the insurance of the goods covered up to 130 % of the invoice amount . 
 That's understood . 
 Yes . You will save 90 cents on each bag . 
 No , no limit . You can take as many as you want . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Do you ? By the way , could you mail this letter for me as you go through the lobby ? 
 Thank you . Come back to my office at the same time tomorrow . I'll have the pictures ready by then . 
 Could you tell me what university you want to go to , John ? 
 What university would you enter ? 
 Oh , I forget.Sorry . 
 Did you ? And what course did you take there ? 
 I've not known.Perhaps , I've got a bad memory . 
 Terrific ! B . A . , again and again-B . A . 
 Thank you . 
 Thank you very much . Mr . George . As a newcomer , I understand that you have your consideration and I am satisfied with the raise . 
 Thank you again . I'll keep doing my best . 
 Thank you so much . I have been expecting to come to China . 
 Oh , you needn't do that . 
 Where is the boss ? I need him to sign a few documents . I checked in his office , but he is not there . Is he out of the office now ? 
 What's he studying ? 
 Sounds like a tiring schedule.He ’ s probably got a lot of homework too , eh ? 
 Why is that ? 
 I was wondering if someone in your office could help me with a question I have about my payment . 
 My paycheck seems to be smaller than the one I received last week . 
 My old employer gave us a couple days of work during that period . 
 Of course I wrote down the work that I had done on the Continued Claim Form . 
 I am not going to show any income from now on then . 
 Hello , how can I help ? 
 That does depend on where you plan to travel . If you are planning to travel to Hong Kong or Macao we can exchange up to 1,000 USD for you . If your destination is elsewhere , we can exchange up to 2,000 USD . 
 OK , I'll process that for you now . 
 I want to go traveling . 
 Yes , I've been thinking about Florida . 
 Yes , I went to Cambridge . After graduation , I started right away into the advertising industry . Later , I made a bit of a switch to focus on marketing research . 
 I have ten years marketing experience . This includes both entry level and management positions . In my last position , I worked my way up to being director of the marking department . 
 I felt after five years in one place , I was ready for something new . I would like to have a job that is challenging , something that I can see and do new things every day . I loved many things about my former job , and I left with amiable feelings on both sides . I was just ready for something new . 
 I would rather work full-time . 
 I am willing to negotiate , but I expect at least $ 40,000 a year . 
 Hello sir . Good to meet you , too . 
 Ok , Jason . So how was the flight ? 
 Really ? But you were in first class ! Nobody woke that guy up ? 
 That's terrible ! So you didn't get any sleep ? 
 So , aside from visiting our factory and offices , are there any other things you want to accomplish while you're in China ? 
 That's not a problem . We can have a company car take you there . It's only about a two hour drive . 
 Five.My father , mother , brother , sister-in-law and me . 
 He is five years older than me , He got married last Sunday.My brother and my sister-in-law are the same age . 
 You mean for this afternoon ’ s meeting ? 
 That ’ s quite a while . Let ’ s make it the week after you get back , then . 
 No problem at all . To tell you the truth , I could use the extra time in my schedule to catch up on some paperwork . 
 Please I'd like a ticket to New York . 
 No , early saturday morning . 
 Nothing earlier ? I prefer flight at nine thirty . 
 No , exactly not 
 Sounds not good . I won't take it . 
 I've lost my Traveller's Cheques , all of them . 
 I see . You need the reference numbers ? For each cheque ? 
 Tell me something about yourself and your past experience . 
 What experience have you had that qualifies you for this position ? 
 What attracted you to this job ? 
 What qualities do you think are important to this position ? 
 When have you been most motivated ? 
 Why did you leave your last position ? 
 What are your salary expectations ? 
 Do you have any questions ? 
 I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It ' s unbelievable ! 
 He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . 
 I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me . 
 Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff . 
 I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ? 
 May I please speak to Tom ? 
 What's the name of the series just showed ? 
 What a horrible name ! Is it full of suspense ? 
 Ouch , it ’ s unbearable . 
 All right , doctor . But it really hurts . 
 Look at me . I look so old ! I look as if I were thirty . 
 Yes , I am , but I think it ’ s time for some plastic surgery I ’ m tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin . See ? 
 Whatever , I think I ’ m gonna get liposuction and a nose job and some breast implants as well . 
 I thought you were my friend and would support me on this ! I just want to feel better about myself and feel more attractive . 
 Really ? 
 I like football best of all . 
 It's a very good game . 
 I only watch now . 
 Hi , Dr Evans . Thanks for seeing me on such short notice . When I woke up this morning I had a really sore throat and a really bad cough . I think I am coming down with the flu . 
 Ahhhhhhhh 
 A little actually . My sinuses are a little blocked up as well-I really feel terrible . 
 Whoa ! So many drugs . . . I hate swallowing pills . Am I able to go to work ? 
 Ok ! Would you mind writing me a doctor ’ s note for work , otherwise they may think I am faking it ! 
 Thanks doc , bye ! 
 As you know , we are in a very special time . This is a very hard time for many countries ' economics , both developed and developing . I think the current economic situation could be described as synchronized slowdown of major economies . 
 Once the US economy is in trouble due to the terrorist attack , the impact could be quickly felt in the rest of the world . 
 We do face a lot of challenges because there is still much uncertainty about the world economy . It's very important for us to strike a proper balance between investment in fixed assets and household consumption . 
 What's your favorite dish or dishes ? 
 But a Chinese person would never order that . 
 Alex , you don't know what to order . Let's go to a Chinese restaurant together next time . 
 Get ready for the best meal of your life ! 
 Yes . Especially in autumn , the red leaves of the maple trees make the whole mountain red . 
 Yes , it can make people feel as if they were in the land of fairies . 
 A couple of times . 
 Sure . I'd be very glad to be your tour guide . 
 what kinds do you have ? 
 Last time I tried a pink curl perm and form permanent . Set the wave a little loose than as usual , please . 
 Hello , I want confirm my flight . My name is Jesse . 
 June loth . 
 Yes , thanks . By the way , what time do I have to start check-in ? 
 Cool camera . What are its features ? 
 What about the quality of the pictures ? 
 Wow ! What about the memory ? 
 I really do like this dining set.But I just don't know . I don't know if I can do a good job with it . 
 What instructions ? 
 I see . But can I understand the instructions ? I'm a foreigner , you know . 
 Could you tell me now some of the things I need to do ? 
 Do I have to sand every inch of the table ? 
 Alright . 
 Sawdust ? 
 That makes sense . 
 And I can choose any color ? 
 And after the varnish ? 
 And then ? 
 It all sounds very complicated . 
 Well , I will look around your shop some more . I need to think about it . 
 Good afternoon . May I help you ? 
 What kind of car do you have in mind ? 
 I see . How long will you need it ? 
 Just a moment , please . 
 I work for Thomas Cook Travel . 
 I'm a guide . I take people on tours to countries in South America , like Peru . 
 Yes , it's a great job . I love it . And what do you do ? 
 Oh ? Where do you work ? 
 Which restaurant ? 
 Every year , the South has the floods . It is an act of God . 
 Yeah , you have some other ideas ? 
 For example ? 
 Oh , I see . Fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things . 
 SW113 leaves at 13:25 . Would you want one ? 
 $ 88 for a single ticket . 
 Yes . From October lst we have to charge every passenger $ 5 for the airport tax . 
 Can I help you ? 
 We have some catalogues from U . S . universities . You may check in the reference stacks over there . 
 Well , generally in the U . S . each university has its own outstanding fields . But the graduate school accepts no applications after January 29th . 
 So you have to apply to begin the first semester next year . 
 Excuse me.Could you tell me how to return to the Hilton Hotel ? I am afraid I lost my way . 
 Let's see.Yes , I have the address and telephone number here . 
 Well , I don't understand it very well.Will you draw me a map ? 
 What is it ? 
 All right . 
 No problem . I'd be happy to . 
 What is your salary at present ? 
 What are your salary expectations now ? 
 That's a little more than we had planned . 
 I can only offer you 110,000 Yuan a year . Raises will be given after a three-month probation according to your performance . Is that satisfactory ? 
 I need to buy some flowers for my wife . 
 What would the roses cost me ? 
 I like the sound of that . 
 A dozen will be fine . 
 No , thank you . 
 Hello , Friendship Hotel . How can I help you ? 
 What are the dates , sir ? 
 This one is too small . Please bring me a bigger one . 
 What's the brand ? 
 This one suits better . I will take it . 
 What ? 
 That sounds like fun . 
 That is awesome . Congratulation ! I know you can make it . 
 Yes . Wait for me at the cafe down my office building . See 5PM , ok ? 
 See you ! 
 Can I ask what the position pays ? 
 My current salary is in the range of fifty thousand yuan . 
 Yes , but not including overtime pay . I'm looking for a salary slightly higher than my present one , with opportunities for raises if I work well . 
 I have to support my parents who are advanced in age , so I'd like to commence at HAD 2,500 a month . 
 It ’ s still up in the air . There is something wrong between us . 
 Step into my office for a moment . What is your concern ? 
 Let's go on the computer to see what's up . Do you think you are doing well ? 
 I can see that you are trying , but where do you think you could improve ? 
 Having a regular study routine and following it is very important , right ? 
 Thanks for stopping by ! 
 I believe you can take the 486 . 
 It sure will . 
 It's a forty-five minute to an hour ride . 
 It doesn't take long at all 
 More people start getting on around LA . 
 Don't mention it . 
 Yes . A few days ago I have no right to get a driving licence . But now I get it . 
 Yes , it can be quite tough . Many people fail to pass the test at the first time . 
 You should enroll in driving school and then take a road test and a written test . After you pass both tests , you'll get your licence . 
 Don't worry about your driving test . I think you will pass the test and get the driver's licence very soon . 
 Hello , may I help you ? 
 Oh , how nice.They ' re bright rooms and the house is very quiet . 
 Well , gentleman.Each room is $ 40 a week if you think that's OK . 
 When do you want to move in ? 
 Fine . I'll be expecting you around two . 
 Certainty.Do you want double breasted suit or single breasted suit ? 
 What about this one ? It's a very nice 3 - piece suit . 
 Anna , that outfit looks wonderful on you ! The color goes with your trousers perfectly . 
 Well , that dress certainly shows your good taste . It must have cost a lot . 
 Really ? You're an amazing bargain hunter ! Next time there's a sale , promise you'll let me tag along with you . 
 I'd like to cancel my reservation on flight MS701 to Warsaw on the 23rd.My name is Michael . 
 No , thanks . 
 Did you see the 2005 Grammy Awards on TV last night . 
 He seems to win awards everywhere . 
 I heard one observer even said ' It was a song sung in Spanish for international football , and he made it so popular that even the Americans loved it . ' 
 Where are you going ? 
 What are you going to do there ? 
 What's he doing ? 
 What did you think of the teambuiding session this morning ? Do you think it did much good ? 
 I think that's an important part of it all ... we've got to be able to see another side of our co-workers and boss ... We can see what they're like as real human beings , working together on some project , for fun . I really think it helped our team jell together better . 
 The trust game was your favorite , huh ? My favorite part was the personality tests . I think to know more about what kind of personality type you are will tell you a lot about how you can fit into a team.Also , when you know the personality strengths of your colleagues , it helps you understand them better . 
 Good morning Mr . Li 
 Oh . It ’ s a nice day indeed 
 Really . For me too . 
 Sure ! What exactly do you have questions about ? 
 Well , let me take a look at my grade book . How do YOU think you are doing ? 
 Well , your scores show that you could do a little better . What do you think you could improve on ? 
 Fine ! Please remember that regular attendance is the most important way to begin . 
 I'm sure you'll do fine . 
 How about your psychological resilience ? 
 How would you deal with those who are not easy to get along with ? 
 You seem to be a kind-hearted lady . 
 Please tell me your weaknesses if you can . 
 Honey , we are all out of wine and cheese . Do you mind running to the deli and picking up a few things ? 
 Your friends and family are coming over tonight and we still need to get a lot of things . 
 OK , pick up some cured meats to go with the wine . Maybe a pound of polish sausages , ham , liverwurst , salami and any other cold cuts that are on sale . I think I saw a promotion for pastrami . Also get s 
 Never mind that.Get some dips as well . Get a jar of spinach and blue cheese dip and also some Tzatziki.If they have bean dip get that as well . Last but not least , get some pickles . 
 Very funny ! Get a move on ! People will be here any minute . 
 Do you have anything to declare ? 
 What's in the bag ? Would you mind opening the bag ? 
 NO.You don't have to pay duty on personal belongings . 
 good morning . I understand that you ’ Ve got a problem with your washing machine . I ’ m from the repair company . 
 when did it first break down ? 
 is it still under warranty . If it is and I can ’ t fix it , it would be quicker and easier to exchange it for a new one . 
 ok . I ’ ll start by looking at the motor . I ’ ll just unplug it and take a look inside the machine ... oh , yes . There ’ s the problem . It ’ s quite simple . I ’ ll sort it out in a few minutes . 
 part of the motor is loose . I can put it back in place quite easily . 
 Excuse me , miss . I'm Bob . 
 I'm very glad to meet you . May I have this dance with you ? 
 No , I don't often dance . Isn't this a wonderful party ? 
 How do you like fox-trot ? 
 You dance beautifully . 
 Thank you . 
 I ’ m fine . Thanks for asking . 
 I would like to make a withdrawal . 
 I want to take out $ 300 . 
 I want it taken from my checking account . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 No . That ’ s everything . Thank you . 
 We broke up . 
 Yes . Let me get you a pair . 
 Yes , I want to book a room . 
 Well , could you let me see the room ? 
 It's fine . What beautiful scenery outside the window ! I think this one will do . 
 The show will be starting in a few minutes . We'd better go in and find our seats . 
 That's right . This entrance is for even numbers . That entrance over there is for odd numbers . Let's go over there . 
 Maybe you are right . 
 Well , how did you like the show ? 
 Oh my God ! I can't find my first period American literature class . 
 Aren't you the guy who sat in front of me in our homeroom ? 
 I'm Mary . I can't find my American literature class . 
 It's 112 . 
 Thanks a lot , Brad . I've got to go before the bell rings . 
 I see . 
 It was bad . 
 But I already tried my best . 
 Good evening , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 Yes , of course . This way , please . 
 Great - they wined and dined us all week . 
 I have a typical 9 to 5 job . Actually , I work a little longer than 9 to 5 most days . 
 No , I don ’ t . I get a bonus each month , depending on the value of the contracts I sign with clients . 
 We have an hour-long lunch break form 12 to 1 . we can take coffee breaks during the day . My boss doesn ’ t mind , as long as we get out work done on time . 
 There ’ s some paperwork , but most of the time we put any information onto computers . Then we can send information to each other by email or across the network . Do you work in a cubicle ? 
 I work in a cubicle too , but I I don ’ t mind it . 
 Oh , Brian . That ’ s really sweet of you guys . I would love to get together with all of you . How about Friday ? 
 I ’ m free all afternoon . Why don ’ t we meet at 1 o ’ clock in the lobby ? 
 Andrew , this is Linda Chen . 
 I need to set up an appointment to get my hair fixed . 
 Tuesday morning . 
 Fine , they are colorful and tasty . 
 Yes , I did . I have never tasted anything like this . 
 No , thanks . I'm full . 
 No , thanks . I'm on diet . 
 Ice cream , please . 
 I know . Maybe you will get the air if you go against her . 
 And it takes two to make an agreement too . You have no guts , I am afraid . 
 Of course ! Will you ? 
 Are you serious ? 
 Voting is easy . 
 The ballot gives you all that information . 
 You have nothing to worry about . 
 Good luck on your first election . 
 No , I don't really care too much for seminars ... I find them to be either boring ot useless . I mean , how much can you really learn in one afternoon ? 
 I'm still not too jazzed about going ... I feel kind of awkward in those cocktail party situations . 
 Now you're talking . 
 No dogs or cats or any other fur type animal , but other pets are allowed . 
 Well . . . is that a pet ? Isn't that something from the zoo ? 
 I was more thinking of nice little fish or frogs or turtles or a pet rock . 
 I'll tell you what , if your pet can fit in this little box and doesn't have fur , it is welcome here . 
 Congratulations ! By the way , have you had all the things ready for the interview ? 
 That's not enough . You have many other things to prepare . 
 Besides the resume , you also need the original and copies of your graduation certificate and your ID card . 
 Also several copies of your one-inch color photos . 
 You also need to prepare formal clothes for the interview ; a suit should be the best . 
 Have a briefcase ready with all your interview materials in it for easy carrying . 
 All these should be enough . Good luck ! 
 Don't mention it . 
 Hello , I ordered a dining table last week . The order arrived today , but there are several scratches on the surface of the table . I would like to exchange it . 
 Well , I'm hosting a dinner party this weekend . Couldn ’ t you make it any sooner ? 
 OK , thank you . 
 Any time . I'm just glad I could help . 
 Sure . It's down this street on the left . 
 No , it's not far . 
 About a mile and a half . 
 5 minutes or so . 
 Yes , it's very close . The subway station is next to the hotel . You can walk there . 
 May I help you find something , or are you just looking ? 
 Then take your time , please . 
 I wish it was a nicer day today . 
 It wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer . 
 It would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather . 
 That's right , it really would be . 
 I know what you mean , I can't wait until it's winter . 
 I would rather deal with the winter than the summer .

 Johnny , I can't believe you would do that . 
 You're darn Toomin ' , you know ! Now , you're on housework duty while I'm here ! 
 You're going to mop the floor until you can see your face in it ! 
 And you're going to dust every piece of furniture in the house ! 
 Your house is very old . Does it need redecorating ? 
 Shall I help you with it ? 
 I have much time . I suppose it can be done . 
 Hello , Pratt . How was your interview yesterday ? 
 I am sorry to tell you that I have lost the opportunity . 
 Yes , I know I am excellent , but I pay no attention to the etiquette you ’ Ve told me . 
 When I entered the room , I forgot to close the door . Later , I couldn ’ t help smoking , you know I am a heavy-smoker . What ’ s more , I forgot to polish my shoes . There is some dirt on it . 
 Yes , I know . And next time I must make good preparations . 
 Thank you . 
 Thank you very much . I ’ Ve tried to keep it short and clear.If there ’ s any questions please feel free to ask me . 
 Yes , of course . Well as you can see from the resume I ’ m 27 and grew up in Brooklyn , New York , although our family moved to London when I was quite young , at around 16 . 
 Yes precisely . Although I was born in the US , I would definitely call London home . But as you see I ’ Ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . My Father was in the oil business 
 Absolutely ! We were never still for too long . But now I ’ m really looking to settle down . 
 Sure . 
 Yes , I did , but Linda stood me up . She didn't keep the date for the first time . 
 I don't know . 
 I did phone her this morning , but she hung up on me . I think she is going to walk out on me . 
 I will . Thanks for your advice . 
 It should take us all the way up to Altadena . 
 I'm not positive if it does or not . 
 I have never been on this bus , but I'm sure it's the right one . 
 I know , and we've been on the bus forever . 
 Oh my gosh , that one says Temple City . 
 Well , now I know the bus that'll take us back . 
 Oh ... Um ... I don't think so . you know the halogen lighting is much more expensive than your track lighting system . Plus I'm going to have to call in some guys to install it for you . That's not going to come cheap . 
 It doesn't matter because we will still have to call the electrician out , and they are union labor . It'll cost you a pretty penny ... 
 Mumm , I estimate it'll run in the neighborhood of ... $ 500 per light . 
 It is , I'll tell you why . We'll have to call in the electrician , he's going to charge overtime now because it's already 5PM , and it will probably take him an hour a light . Plus , the halogen lights take more electricity , so your electrical cost is going to be higher as well . 
 No , that's the cost , and that's what it's going to cost us . We can't go in the hole with this . I am giving you my best price , so take it , or leave it . 
 Yes , but why does she have such a long face ? 
 I thought she'd be happy . 
 I don't know . Maybe it ’ s some kind of personal problem . 
 I had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday . 
 It is a long story . Basically , she thought I had laughed at her while I didn't . 
 Yeah . It's so nice of you to comfort me . 
 I'll take one . How's the cooler situation ? 
 Cheers . You guys didn't drive , did you ? 
 No , it's just that it's a holiday . With everyone out partying , there's a lot of drunk driving . 
 Let ’ s start with the basics , bread . Bread is an important ingredient here . You need to remember one thing - choose the bread according to the following criteria , freshness , crumb and color . If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven , or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color . 
 Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light . The best choices here are evident — cucumbers , tomatoes , onions , sweet pepper or chilli , lettuce and , of course , herbs — you can ’ t go wrong with them . As for aubergines , mushrooms and asparagus , I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil . 
 That ’ s all the time we have for today , but join us next time where we ’ ll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna ! Till next time ! 
 Speaking . 
 Yes . I'd like to choose a sweater for my son . 
 Not yet . Can you give me some suggestions ? 
 Thirteen . 
 About 158cm . He likes to wear loose-fitting sweaters . 
 I don't think he'll like it . He prefers simple styles . 
 The style is all right , but I'm not sure about the color . Let me think for a while . 
 I ’ m making a list of food and drinks . 
 What for ? For the party , of course . 
 We ’ re having a Valentine ’ s Day Party . 
 We ’ Ve invited all our sophomore friends from school . 
 That ’ ll be a big help . Well , here ’ s a list of some of the food you could buy . 
 Thanks . See you at five . Don ’ t forget to bring your valentine . 
 Oh , I am terribly sorry . But I was so captivated with the singer at the subway exit . So I forgot the time . 
 Oh , no , the guy was a musician who just sang . He played the guitar and sang so many cool pop songs . Many people were drawn to his music and there was no hat on the floor . He sang for appreciation , but not for money . 
 Oh , no , it was a kind of pop art . I like it but I couldn't do it that well . 
 No , but tell me some . I am interested . 
 Are there many people there ? Do you think people actually like them ? 
 But I still prefer the pop music in the subway . 
 Dad , you talk well , but can you appreciate that kind of art ? 
 Whose handset sounds so beautiful 
 Are you able to compose music ? 
 Who composed it for your ? 
 Can I get on line to search one , too ? 
 What about my SIEMENS ? 
 Whoa , look at all those ice cream choices ! 
 I love anything with chocolate the best . 
 Is there any kind of ice cream you don't like ? 
 I haven't ever cared for that myself . 
 That sounds absolutely disgusting ! 
 I had a job interview this morning . 
 Pretty well , I think . 
 What ! That sounds perfectly ridiculous ! Labour Day is a holiday for everyone , not just laboring staff ... and we get a whole day off tomorrow anyway , so what's the point of an extra hour tonight ? 
 So if we did allow the laboring force to go home early , how many people are we talking about ? 
 Can I help you ? 
 What size are you ? 
 Ok , try these on in the changing rooms . 
 I want my hair cut . 
 I'm not sure . What do you suggest ? 
 I don't like it . It's outdated . 
 It seems a little too wild . 
 I want a haircut just like that kind . 
 Hi Kara , it's Mike here . 
 I'm doing well , and you ? 
 Kara , would you be interested in going to dinner again this Friday ? 
 Well , we could just go out as friends . 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 I'm sorry . All the appointments are filled . 
 Let me see ... Perhaps I could fit you in at five thirty . 
 What about tomorrow morning , then ? 
 I guess it can't be helped . 
 All right , then . See you this afternoon . 
 What kind of place shall we rent ? 
 Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat . 
 I don't mind . i'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home . 
 Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early . 
 I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month . 
 Mmmm ... it's hard to say . I like golf a lot-but I guess I like tennis better . 
 Yes , quite a bit . How about a game sometime ? 
 How much is this ? 
 The large one . 
 Is this the only kind you have ? 
 Oh , yes . I think I'll look at those over there before I decide . 
 Would you honor us with a visit ? 
 When will you be convenient ? 
 Are you doing anything tomorrow ? 
 I'll pick you up at about nine o'clock , will it do ? 
 I haven't seen Bill lately . How is he ? 
 That's too bad . What does he have ? 
 Let me know if there's anything I can do . 
 Hello , Madam . Are you alright ? 
 Yes , that's correct , Madam . You don't need to go to a counter at all , you can use one of our ATM machines . I'll be more than happy to help you . 
 I know it does seem a little daunting , but once you get used to it , it will save you a lot of time and trouble . 
 Oh , Penny , I'm Leonard , glad to meet you . 
 It is hard to get used to a new place , isn't it ? 
 We'd like to . Can you tell me when we go ? 
 OK . Do you want us to bring something ? 
 OK , see you later . 
 I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat . ( looking around for him ) oh , there he is . 
 Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true . 
 what a bummer ! You set me up ? 
 how dare you ! 
 why did you lie to me in the email ? 
 I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me . 
 I hear Yolanda has been studying every night this week for the exam . 
 Mom , is there anything in the fridge I can eat before dinner ? 
 Anything else ? 
 Do I have any other choices ? 
 Is everything in the fridge leftovers ? I hate leftovers ! 
 Mom , look , that cake looks delicious . My mouth is watering . 
 I'm ready to place an order with you , but only one condition that the goods are confined to Australia . Can you do that ? 
 All right , but I'm busy . How long will it be before you can finish the talk ? 
 Go ahead . 
 Excuse me , is this the right counter for express mail ? 
 I want to send some important documents to Canada for my postgraduate admission . 
 Yes , the deadline for applying is 1st Feb , so I hope they will arrive in 3 days . 
 Really ? But can you guarantee the safety ? 
 OK . I will send them now . 
 All right . Here you are . 
 Thank you . I have got quite clear idea of it . 
 Hi , I'm calling from Nika Corporation . We would like to hold a business lunch at the restaurant . 
 There will be about 18 people . 
 Is there an extra charge to reserve the room ? 
 That's great . I'd like to go ahead and reserve the room , then , for Friday , December 2 , at around noon . This is a retirement party and we'd like to bring a cake for the guest of honor and some bottles of champagne . Will that be acceptable ? 
 Oh , that's fine . 
 Sure . I'm J McQuillin and my number is 323-555-6840 , extension 42 . 
 Sounds good . Thanks for your help . 
 John , I'd like to see you in my office for a minute . 
 John , I have been watching you . I've been paying attention to you over the last quarter and I'm impressed . You've done a tremendous job in tackling some difficult accounts . I just want to let you to know , after this month's performance reviews , I'm recommending you for promotion . 
 Well , it's not going to be in our department . I've recommended you for an interdepartmental transfer . There's supervisory spot opening up in financial . I'm turning your name in for it . 
 You've earned it . 
 Better late than never . 
 That's perfectly all right . 
 It's really of nothing . 
 That's quite all right . 
 For more than five years . 
 It's no picnic . 
 Really ? How can he be so sure about the timing ? 
 Well . This must save lots of employees from worrying about how to write a salary increase letter . You know how tough it is . Do all the employees receive the same pay increase annually ? 
 I like this system . It will encourage the best employees and motivate those who want to make a change at work . 
 Oh , no.You should take the No . 14 tram . 
 Two blocks down the street . 
 No , thank you , I am not interested . 
 I wish I could , but I have to walk the dog and finish cooking so if you would excuse me . 
 Wow , that would be kind of useful , do you have any other cooking magazines ? 
 Wow , this is nice ! Ok , sign me up for both publications . 
 That is exactly what I needed ! What else do you have ? 
 My God ! Why did you bring me here ? I hate the taste of coffee . 
 Can't you delay your return a little bit ? 
 Keep in touch then , OK ? 
 Is there anything available for tonight ? 
 Isn't there anything else available ? 
 May , I saw a beautiful cotton down coat in the shopping mail . 
 Is there anything that you are interested in ? 
 Yes . It's a prototype of our new product . It has got more advantages than the second did . 
 It will be released next month . 
 We have developed new technology about it . And the new product will be a pleasure to be hold . 
 To which gate do I need to go to catch connecting flight 101 to New York City ? 
 Show me the fastest way to get there . 
 Do you think the plane will leave without me ? 
 Thank you so much . I would really appreciate that . 
 What ’ s your major weak point ? 
 What are you greatest strength ? 
 Does your present employer know you are looking for another job ? 
 She is kind of player who never hides how she's feeling . Once look at her and you know if she's winning or losing . 
 Don ’ t throw your weight around . I can ’ t bear you any more . 
 I'd like to have a berth ticket to Shanghai . 
 The 19:00 train . 
 When is the next train to Shanghai ? 
 How much is the ticket ? 
 Here is 200 yuan . 
 Hi , may I speak to Ryan , please ? 
 Hi , Ryan , this is Malia , and I will not be coming to work today . 
 I have really bad poison oak and can ’ t stop itching . 
 I ’ Ve had it a few days , but the rash really got bad last night . 
 I have some lotion that the doctor gave me , as well as an antihistamine . 
 Shall I punch out for you , Ross ? I am leaving now . 
 But today is Friday . You are not going to work overtime on Friday evening , are you ? 
 No . We ’ ll meet at my house . He invited my family to spend the weekend with his family at their villa . 
 It's not his villa , but his father's . I think it's somewhere in Florida . I am not sure myself . 
 Come on . You just haven ’ t met the right person and I think that you work too much . You should learn how to entertain yourself and enjoy life . 
 Well , suit yourself . I've got to run now . 
 You too . Oh , I forgot to tell you one thing . A girl called this afternoon . She said she was your ex-girlfriend . She wanted you to call her back . 
 No , nothing else . See you Monday . 
 I've just got a new printer . How often do I need to replace the print heads ? 
 So if I don't print out very much , it could last a lot longer ? 
 Thank you so much for interviewing me this evening . 
 I like to work alone on some things and then bring those things to the group . 
 I want to grow in my job and move ahead . 
 I need to stay in the area because of my family . 
 75,000 per year . 
 Excuse me . I would like to book a table at 13:00 . 
 Three seats , please . 
 Annie , do you like shopping online ? 
 Last week , I tried to buy a new cellphone online , but I didn't know how to pay for it . 
 Are there many things online ? 
 That's amazing . Oh , an on line virtual supermarket ? 
 Oh , I got it . It simulates the real supermarket , which makes it feel so real . Mom will love it . She loves shopping in supermarkets . 
 Great idea ! I like authentic Chinese food . 
 Pork steamed with rice flour , jelly fish and egg soup . 
 Good afternoon . It's a pleasure to see you again ! What can we do for you today ? 
 Have you had a chance to go through them yet ? 
 Is it a big difference ? 
 Dear , time is up , let ’ s go there now . 
 Have you taken the key to the door ? 
 Where have you put it ? 
 Are you sure ? 
 Then , have you looked downstairs ? 
 Look , dear . It ’ s over there . 
 On the floor . 
 Well , you are behind in your rent ; it ’ s a 30 - day notice to vacate . 
 You have been late with your rent several times now . I am filing suit for back rent to protect myself . 
 This notice is to let you know that you will be evicted by a sheriff if you don ’ t make good on your rent . 
 You can stay if you catch up and stay caught up . Otherwise , I will find another renter . 
 Thank you . Please make sure that you pay with cash or a cashier ’ s check . 
 I used to date him . Of course it was him . 
 Yes , on the cancer ward . And Taylor was there . He walked right by me and didn't even see me . 
 But you saw how skinny and pale he looks . He has " cancer patient " written all over his face . 
 OK , Mr . Smith . When will you arrive ? 
 Party of two ? 
 All right , Mr . Smith . I will arrange a table for 5 at 12:00 for you . 
 What's wrong with you ? 
 How long has it been like this ? 
 Do you have a sleeping problem ? 
 I think you'd better have a further exam , and before the result comes out , try to relax yourself and take the medicine before you sleep . It will help you to kill the pain and make you sleep well . 
 When the result comes out , I will tell you about it . Remember , never be afraid or be too tired . 
 Look ! There are playing The Matrix today . 
 I don't know . If we can't , we can buy from ticket scalpers . 
 Come on . We are already here . Besides , I really wanna see this picture . 
 Seven thirty . There is only 10 minutes left and look at the long line ! 
 Yeah , let's do so . 
 What can you expect with this crowd ? I am praying that no one will cut in the line . 
 I hope not . We are getting closer .. two more ... one more ... it's our turn . 
 I need to take a few classes . 
 How about a driver's course ? 
 I don't understand why I need to make an appointment . 
 I'd like to make one now if I could . 
 I'd like to come in tomorrow morning at 9 
 That's great . Thank you very much . 
 Not cash . But if our launch goes well , my stock options will pay off , big time . 
 I don't have to worry about rent . I live right here . 
 Right here . Me and my PC . Home sweet home . 
 I'm really into watching foreign films . what about you ? 
 camping for an evening is ok , but I couldn't do it for much longer than one night ! 
 no , but I've always wanted to do that . I've heard it's a beautiful place to go . 
 do you have any photos of any of your camping trips there ? 
 that'd be great . What kind of camera do you have ? 
 so , you must be pretty interested in photography then . 
 actually , I do . I took quite a few photography classes at University . 
 yes , I was planning on going . Are you ? 
 that'd be great . what time should I meet you there ? 
 sounds great . see you then . 
 That ’ s the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter , I think . 
 It ’ s approximately 3.14 , but the number continues forever . What ’ s the diameter of your circle ? 
 Ok . My next problem is to convert 10000 british pounds into us dollars . What ’ s the exchange rate at the moment ? 
 That means that 10.000 pounds will buy me 18.500 dollars . 
 Fractions . What ’ s a quarter and an eighth ? That ’ s three-eights . Easy . The next question is “ what are prime numbers ? ” . 
 So , 1,2 and 3 are prime numbers , but 4 isn ’ t because 2 * 2 = 4 . 
 How many seconds in an hour ? 60 seconds multiplied by 60 minutes equals 3600 seconds altogether . 
 OK , I just want to brief you all on the travel market in Taiwan . To start with , generally speaking , the travel industry in Taiwan focuses mainly on tours . This segment of the industry is well developed . 
 Yes , of course . Most of the time , when they travel , they prefer to do so in large groups accompanied by a guide , who usually takes care of everything , for instance , choosing the restaurants , the itinerary , the mode of transport , and things like that . Another thing is that most travelers to the UK tend to be middle aged , around 40 to 50 or so . This age group is less adventurous ; they like good hotels , and have money to spend . They kind of prefer to stay in the cities where they feel safer . They are not into mountain climbing in Wales or anything . 
 Just a moment . I'll tell you about that in a minute . Where was I ? Oh yes . By way of illustration , let ’ s look at the top five destinations in the UK for this kind of traveler over the last five years . If you look at page ten you can see what I mean . In spite of these characteristics of the market , I still think there is room for growth in the youth sector . 
 OK , let me tell you what we ’ Ve been doing . We ’ Ve been in touch with the Wales and Scottish Tourist development offices here in Taiwan and they ’ re interested in working with us to promote their regions to the youth segment . We ’ Ve decided to implement an advertising campaign focusing on the excitement of the activities in those regions . 
 Go ahead . 
 Well , at the moment we are trying to work out those details . We haven't managed to come up with a concrete plan yet , but we are working on it . 
 Well , our intention is to have some features about these regions in some youth magazines . We ’ re also going to run some ads on TV and put some flyers in places where young people go , like the gym and student organizations . We ’ re making arrangements to have some activities at big shopping malls and department stores around town . 
 I'm sorry ; he's out at the moment . 
 I think he'll be back in about an hour at least . 
 Yes , of course . 
 Ok . Does he know your number ? 
 13924774026 . All right . Thanks for calling . Oh , hang on , someone's at the door that may be him , please hold on . 
 Not yet , can you recommend me some chickens ? 
 Please bring me the chicken chops . 
 Then I guess you get to have a pet . Do you know what you want ? 
 You know who will be responsible for feeding and cleaning and all of that stuff ? 
 Have you figured out the costs involved with feeding and caring for it ? 
 Sounds like you've done your homework . I think you're ready for this . 
 Oh . 
 No , I knew it all along . He was the obvious choice . 
 A new broom sweeps clean anyway . 
 You finished everything in there , sir ? 
 What would you like to order ? 
 Uh-huh . What else do you want ? 
 No problem . Is there anything else I can get for you ? 
 I'll get all of that for you right away . Someone should be up shortly 
 Sure you can . But I'm only gonna keep it for a month . 
 That's why I can profit from it ! 
 You bet . eBay Taiwan doesn't have it ! And bidding will start at two thousand NT . This baby's worth about six thousand to real tennis fans ... 
 Have you seen our new packing specifications ? 
 What date would you like to depart , sir ? 
 Let's see ... I'm afraid the 16th is fully booked . But I have seats for the 17th . 
 And what date will you be returning ? 
 Okay , you're booked on American Airlines flight 710 , departing JFK at 6 
 Doctor , my child is nine years old , and I recently found that he was constantly telling lies about how he is doing at school . 
 He is doing OK , but he pretends he is doing much better by telling lies . 
 This may be complicated . But I think he may need to build up his self-esteem . 
 There are a lot of ways to help a kid build up self-esteem , but to begin with , you can try and give him more rewards . Rewards will help a chil improve his self-esteem . 
 Sure . Our company is in Ericsson Tower , No . 12 Like East Street , Chaoyang District . 
 You can make it by the No . 913 bus , or by subway Line 13 . 
 Do you have any special brand in your mind ? 
 I see . Have a look at this one . It ’ s very cheap because it ’ s not very durable . 
 Ok , the mirror is over there . 
 This is Liu Fang speaking . 
 May I have your name , please ? 
 Of course . In my opinion , you are the strongest candidate for the job . 
 I want to set up an interview for you at 9 a . m . next Monday in our company's conference room . 
 Do you know where I can park ? 
 I want a space on campus . 
 Where can I find it ? 
 Is it full ? 
 When was that ? 
 Would it be full now ? 
 Good afternoon.madam.How can I help you ? 
 I am sorry to hear that.Would you mind coming with me to my office and tell me what exactly happened there ? 
 Well , in that case . I will call the manger , you can talk directly with him . 
 Yes . I'd like to . 
 I want to offer you more invoking stock options . 
 Let me explain . To get more cash , I'll have to borrow more from Vital , the venture capitalists . 
 Exactly . Instead of increasing their position , I want to increase yours . 
 OK . I just want to read the comics . 
 What time do you have ? 
 I must be off now . I'm pressed for time . 
 Are you making what I think you're making ? 
 What a nostalgic food ! 
 No . Just the smell of bread toasting to a perfect golden brown ... 
 You know , you really ought to get a new pair of jeans . Those are falling to pieces . 
 Well , you ’ d better get another pair for work at least or you ’ re sacking on the spot . 
 No , they live in Shanghai , my hometown . 
 Once a year . 
 Not yet . 
 A trim and perm . 
 A cold-wave , please . 
 Out of sight , out of mind . 
 Don ’ t you know they have had little affection for each other ? 
 They think you are just a child . 
 Maybe you are right . Well , you can talk with them . 
 But we just drove across town . Can't we just go in to see him one last ... 
 This is all too fast . He's my best friend , and now he's gone . 
 The viewing was for saying goodbye , and I didn't even get that . 
 Hackneyed theme ! 
 Nearly everything . 
 Too easy questions . Listen carefully . Hollywood is the movie capital of the world.It is located in southern California . Many films have been made there , and the kinds have changed often . 
 Gangster movies . Movie-goers at that time could get a look at the people involved in crime and their violent activities by watching it . 
 After all that violence , people needed to laugh , so from the mid-to-late l940 ' s , many detective movies about policemen who solved crimes were made . Then came musicals . 
 Right . By the mid - 50 ' s , this light-hearted genre was competing with films about more serious subjects . There was one kind that could be found throughout all of these years , and that was the , mm , the . . . 
 Come on . 
 Any more ? 
 What ’ s the problem ? Things are getting out of hand . You keep sticking your nose where it doesn ’ t belong . 
 Now , I am responsible for training new staff , but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods . I know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove . But I don ’ t like your way . 
 Are you sure ? He doesn't look that old . 
 Hi ! How are things going with you ? 
 Believe it or not , the company I worked for closed down , so I ’ m out of a job . 
 I am not being all that particular right now because I just need to keep a roof over my head . 
 I wish that I could get the opportunity to be interviewed . 
 I read about that , and the position sounded great ! 
 Do you like snakes ? 
 I mean , do you like snake meat ? 
 I like to open up a savings account please . 
 I want the one with the highest interest rate . 
 4.5 % , that's good . How much money do I have to keep in it to get that rate ? 
 All right . I ’ ll open one of those . 
 Thanks . 
 I have been feeling great , Dr . Smith . 
 Yes , I am going on a cross-country bike ride on vacation and want to make sure that I don ’ t have any problems . 
 I ’ Ve been having trouble with congestion in my chest . Can you give me some tests for that ? 
 That would be great . What is the blood test for ? 
 I have been feeling great . I don ’ t imagine that any of my tests will turn out badly . 
 Yes . I'm a transit passenger for this flight . Can you tell me where to go ? 
 Really ? I hope it hasn ’ t left without me . 
 Hurry up . We're going to be late . 
 What are you doing ? 
 You had better get a grab instead of getting upset about little things . 
 I think as long as you try your best and don ’ t think of anything too much , everything will be all right . 
 Thank you.But does it really look all right ? 
 Then does it go well with my sweater ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Sorry , but he is out for lunch right now . 
 I think he will be back around 2:00 . If you like , please leave your name and phone number , I'll have him call you as soon as he comes back . 
 My pleasure , bye ! 
 Pete ! Nice to see you Well , on top the norm , you know , wife and kids and work , I ’ Ve actually gotten into doing some trading . 
 Currencies . 
 It ’ s called Forex . Foreign Exchange . The great thing about it is that I don ’ t have to invest a huge amount . I put in a margin deposit and then I can buy and sell up to 100 times that much ! 
 You got it ! Just last night I made USD 150 ! 
 Yeah ! It ’ s a 24 hour market ! I had bought some RIB earlier at a low asking price but last night it appreciated drastically so I made a split second decision and sold all my RIB at an amazing bid ! I ’ 
 Does this bus really go to the mall ? 
 Are you sure ? 
 How long does it take for the bus to get there ? 
 Where do we get off the bus ? 
 The stop is really at the mall ? 
 That's perfect . 
 What book is that ? 
 Canada , China , and the USA are huge too . 
 Those small countries are microscopic compared to Russia . European countries are relatively small . France looks quite big in Europe , but compared to many countries in other continents , it ’ s not very large at all . 
 The thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . Russia and Canada have enormous areas of ice and forest . 
 Yes , speaking . 
 Oh , I'm sorry , but I've just accepted another offer that I feel is more suitable to my needs . 
 Excuse me , sir . 
 I heard that we will call at some ports on the way . Is that true ? 
 Where will we call at ? 
 Dalian is my hometown . 
 Can I get off the ship and walk around ? 
 Do I have to talk to the interviewer or just leave my application ? 
 What should I do in the fair ? 
 I have a question about my payment and need someone to help me . 
 I can ’ t figure out why my paycheck this week is smaller than last week ’ s . 
 I made a little bit of money , but not much . 
 I claimed the work I did on the last Continued Claim Form . 
 That being the case , I don ’ t think that I am going to show the income next time . 
 Next please ! Hello sir , may I see your passport please ? 
 Will you be checking any bags today . 
 I ’ m sorry , sir . Airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage , at twenty kilograms each , plus one piece of carry-on luggage . I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase . 
 I am sorry , sir , there ’ s nothing I can do . You cannot board the flight with that large bag either.Carry - on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat . That bag is clearly too big . 
 Let ’ s see ... six hundred and twenty-five US dollars . 
 Where are you off to ? 
 You have worked in your present company for five years . 
 Why do you want to resign ? 
 What kind of work are you interested in ? 
 So you are interested in our company . 
 Excuse me . 
 I ordered my dish about a half an hour ago , but it hasn't arrived yet . 
 Thank you . 
 It doesn't matter . 
 The same to you ! 
 I thought about going to my sister's . How about you ? 
 Good morning , Kevin . 
 Very well , thank you . 
 Oh , hi Jeremy . No please , go ahead . So how are you , Jeremy ? I was talking to Linda about you only last week . 
 No , tell me more . 
 And . 
 That's great news , Jeremy . Congratulations ! Anyway , I must get back , but give my regards to your wife Monica .

 That's nice . I'd like to give it a try . I think I like passion red . please . 
 No . 
 Square . But with round at the edges , please . 
 How long will it take to get them dry ? 
 I see , thank you . 
 This is my first tourism . I don't know what should be declared . 
 All right . Here you are . 
 Yes , I have got some special local product , I want to take them for my friends . 
 Four bottles . 
 What shall I do with my two more bottles ? 
 All right , thank you , see you . 
 While you are thinking about what you might like to order for dinner , would you like to order your drinks ? 
 The wine list is posted right there on the board . 
 Yes , we have a wide selection of mixed drinks available from our bar . 
 Our most popular drinks are our Cuervo Gold margaritas . 
 Can I bring that to you on the rocks , or would you like it blended ? 
 Salt or no salt ? 
 Excuse me , I've been waiting here for 10 minutes . Do you know how often does No . 636 run ? 
 It seems you got here at good time . Do you have a bus schedule ? 
 I see , thank you . By the way , is this the right bus for the Museum ? 
 Do I have to change ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 I want a doggy bag , waiter . 
 Quite good . It was the most wonderful dinner I have ever had . 
 Hi , Lucy ! 
 Yes , It's very great . 
 You are right , Mary's father is responsible for the entire wedding-arrangement , costs , etc . I think he must spend much money . 
 Yes.Look ! Mary is going to throw the bride bouquet . 
 We can go to the cinema or say at home watching TV , what's it to be ? 
 Thanks , dear . I feel so tired after a whole day's work . 
 Yes , speaking . What can I do for you ? 
 I am applying for the waiter in your pub . 
 Sure . I will try my best to slow down . 
 I'm not quitting yet . You know my favourite slogan , don't you ? 
 Right ! 
 Ok . 
 Ahahah , and I thought you were tired . 
 It sure looks special , looks expensive too . 
 Don't worry , Mary , I've got you covered . 
 Excuse me , can I use your computer to type my paper ? 
 I am afraid I can't finish typing it this afternoon . When will you use it tonight ? 
 Thanks a lot ! 
 Yes , I see . What did you need to see me about ? 
 What's the problem ? 
 Well , I can see that's a problem . 
 Yes , I can . Would you still like to have both of these classes ? 
 Well , let me find you one of these classes on a different day . 
 I've brought a little dog for Alice , girls usually like looking after pets . 
 To tell you the truth , the dog isn't my real reason for coming . I want to ask Alice if she'd like to be my girlfriend . 
 I hear that Helen does not relate very well to her husband . 
 So what ? Things have changed . 
 I'm wondering if anyone has turned in a train ticket . I just lost my ticket for Beijing tonight . 
 Yes . If I don ' t make it to Beijing tomorrow morning . my wife would kill me . How much does it cost ? 
 Fine . 
 Where is my wallet ? Someone has stolen my wallet ! 
 Judging by all the traffic , I'd say we're near the outskirts of the city . 
 I'm not sure , but I think you turned right when you should have turned left on the flyover bridge . 
 It seems that the traffic sign is much more important than the map . 
 Return on investment ? How can you have a return on this kind of investment ? Can you really calculate the value of these training programs ? 
 Wow ! I'm impressed . So , what's in the cards for future training ? Will it be in-house or off-site ? 
 Yes , I see that here ... continuing education for the IT department , a time management course for accounting , and team building for sales . Anything planned for HR ? 
 I need to get to PCC , but I don't know which bus to catch . 
 I'm coming from Fair Oaks and Las Flores Drive in Altadena . 
 I don't mind walking . 
 Tell me which direction it should be going . 
 Where do I get off ? 
 Thanks for your help . 
 I can ’ t believe Obama is our President . 
 You voted for him , right ? 
 I did , too . 
 Really ? 
 We do need some change in this country . 
 You ’ re absolutely right . 
 What shall we do now ? 
 I've got all I need . 
 It smells good . Look at these . They make my mouth watering . 
 It will be our turn soon . 
 OK . I'll have many cream cakes today . 
 Look ! I bought these shoes only three weeks ago and there is a hole in them already . 
 I did . But they said they won ’ t change them . 
 may i ask you for a dance . 
 you dance it very well . do you often go dancing ? 
 Mrs . Wang , would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable ? 
 Just to comply , we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent . I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling . 
 The ball is in your court , Mrs.Wang . What price would you suggest ? 
 That won't do . You see , our profit margin is very narrow . It simply can't stand such a big cut . 
 Well , I'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction . Would you mind waiting a day or two , until I get a reply from the home office ? 
 Good . Friday morning at 9 . 
 Hi , Clyde . This is my friend , Wen . She's visiting from UCLA . 
 OK ! I was just tellin ’ Wen about African-American food . 
 Hey ! That “ stuff ” is my grandma's cooking , and it's good ! 
 Bread . 
 Orange juice . 
 I think mutton is best . 
 I like champagne . 
 Banana of course . 
 I always have meals outside , because I ’ m not good at cooking . 
 I bought this toy gun from your store two weeks ago . My son played with it only twice and it broke . 
 Yes , and I have the warranty , too . 
 I'd like you to replace this one without charge if you can . 
 Thank you . I'll just print out your receipt , and then you're free to go . Here you go ! 
 If you don't mind me asking , how did you enjoy your stay at New York Hotel ? 
 That's very honest of you . Rest assured that this hotel will have no insects next time . 
 I would like to . but I'm not good at it . 
 That's great ! When will we go ? 
 All right . What should I take ? 
 Thanks . I will wait you at my home . 
 It is my first time coming to China . I want to buy something unique of China to my friends as gifts . 
 Yes , I love them , but they are fragile . It is not convenient to take them . 
 Sounds good . May I have a look ? 
 They are beautiful , but I can't understand the connotation in them . Let me see the handkerchiefs . 
 Oh , I like the bamboo design . What is this ? 
 Good . So I will take three series and five bamboo ones . 
 Excuse me . I am interested in getting a library card . 
 OK , here it is . 
 Here's my license and form . 
 Yes , I know what to do . 
 OK . 
 I really should be on my way . 
 No , thanks all the same . 
 Thank you very much . We really had a good time . 
 So see you . 
 Hello ? Is this the Maintenance Department ? 
 We ’ re having a lot of trouble with our printer . Could you come and take a look at it sometime this afternoon ? 
 Good morning ! My name is John White , import manager of the Garden Trading Company of New York . 
 Nice to meet you Mr.Li . We have learned about that you specialize in the export business of electronic products . As you enjoy the highest reputation in the commercial circle , we'd be please to enter into business relations with your firm . 
 Yes , I had a look just now , I feel we can do a lot of business in this line . 
 Our company enjoys a history of more than twenty years , we have wide connection with wholesalers and retailers all over the America , and we have good reputation in the commercial circle . 
 Sure . 
 Yes , it's my new business phone . Do you like it ? 
 Yes , it's got wireless Internet access . 
 Yes , but I don't really use it often . Have you ever used it ? 
 Yes , I guess I should try to use it . 
 That means it's developing very fast . 
 Problems are inevitable . 
 Hey , Julie . How's it going ? 
 Who were you talking to ? 
 You look so happy . I see a twinkle in your eyes . 
 Oh , you have a crush on someone , don't you ? Maybe those are wedding bells in your eyes ! 
 Well , that's easy . Walk up to him and kiss him . 
 I need to buy some fruit . 
 How much are the pears ? 
 Give me one kilo of those , please . Do you have any fresh plums ? 
 It's a bit too expensive . We can get it for six yuan in the shop next here . 
 Sounds reasonable . I'll take three kilos . 
 Here you are . 
 He is in his office , but you'd better choose your words carefully while talking to him . 
 Nothing . But he is in a bad mood today . 
 That's all right . 
 So what is it ? 
 Another tough thing , I guess . 
 How many workers are there on the lines ? 
 Oh , it's highly efficient . 
 How do you control the quality of the products ? 
 Yes , quality is even more than the quantity . 
 Can we have a table for three , please ? 
 Do you have a table for four , please ? 
 We'd like a non-smoking table , please . 
 Nicole , your Fettucini is very ... unique . 
 Actually , it's better ... 
 No . It was the only dish she wasn't good at . So we could use you as the new head chef ... 
 OK , OK . Get back to work . There's someone waiting for you in the kitchen ... 
 Yes , I want a pair of sport shoes , Jordan . 
 Size 41 . 
 They fit me . Can you make it a little cheaper ? 
 We have another traditional holiday-the Dragon Boat Festival . 
 It falls on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month . 
 OK . The Dragon Boat Festival is a way to commemorate a great ancient poet named Quyuan . On that day , people will hold a boat race as a symbol of the attempt to save him who threw himself into the river . 
 In order to prevent the fish from eating the poet's body . 
 Mr . Carmichael , this is Ellen Bower calling again . You had said I should call this week to schedule an interview with you . 
 I understand , Mr . Carmichael . I ’ d be glad to make it some time next week . 
 Ladies and gentlemen , dear Mr . Simpson . Following the increasing communication between Unity Company and Pineapple Computer Company , we established steady cooperation . And today we all here feel very proud and honored to have Mr . Simpson with us . Mr . Simpson is well-known for his success and his career . So first of all , let me , on the behalf of all present here , extend our warm welcome and cordial greetings to our distinguished guest . Now let's invite Mr . Simpson to give us his speech . 
 Well , I also hope our cooperation will be never-ending . Thank you again . 
 Yes , a suitcase and carry-on . 
 Thank you . 
 Of course , I like flowers . 
 I like peach blossom , because I like spring . 
 Yes . How about you ? 
 You have a perfect taste ! 
 Yes . It's snowing outside . Let's enjoy the plum blossoms . 
 Are you paid on a commission or salary basis now ? 
 What's your monthly salary ? 
 How much do you hope to get a month here ? 
 If we decide to hire you , we'd pay you two thousand and five hundred yuan a month at the start . You can have Saturdays and Sundays off . Besides , you may have a paid month holiday every year . How do you think about it ? 
 Ow ! 
 I slipped and fell downstairs . 
 Yes , I have . I think that I've hurt my back . 
 I'm sorry , Lucy . I'm afraid that I can't get up . 
 This is IBA Bank , Claire speaking , how may I help you ? 
 I'm sorry , could you be a little more specific ? 
 OK , I will have to take some details from you . Could you tell me your name , please ? 
 Not quite , Sir . We will need to also know the account number , the deposited amount and your PIN number . You will also have to come in and fill out some forms . 
 I ’ m sorry , Ms . Fairbanks . I won ’ t let it happen again . 
 I understand , Ms . Fairbanks . 
 We should certainly hold a big party for the professors and students . We could have a firework display . 
 If we do , too many people might attend . Perhaps we should invited all of them , but make a small charge to attend . 
 Good idea ! I think we could also have presentations by former students on how their experience here helped them in their lives . 
 I think that we could also produce some merchandise for the centenary-you know , T-shirts , mugs , plates , pens , and things like that . 
 I ’ m looking forward to reading that . We could have book signings by famous professors an alumni . 
 I ’ m sure that will be very popular .. OK , let ’ s think about how we can put these ideas into practice . 
 Because I went out . 
 I didn ’ t have any change . 
 I don ’ t like all your questions . That ’ s why . 
 It's a bit of a problem situation , actually ... you see , our company has a Corporate Account with you , but unfortunately , we've been experiencing cash flow problems recently . 
 We are going to need a loan . I'm not sure what loan is suitable for us , though . 
 That seems like a good idea , it's for wages , you see . 
 I am going fishing in Alaska with my friend , Mark . 
 What's wrong with heading out with Mark for vacation ? 
 Really ? Who made that rule up ? 
 That works for me ! 
 Sorry , sir . The train has already left . 
 Yes . Your ticket is valid for three days . 
 You have to have your ticket checked . 
 No extra charge at all . But your berth will be invalid . 
 Don ’ t worry , you did a good job and it should be fine . 
 That ’ s the way to go . 
 Yeah . I could not stand living here . There is always much noise in the neighborhood . 
 You know , on weekends when we wanted to have late rise in the morning , our neighbour started to raise Cain . 
 What's a homeroom ? 
 Cindy , I'm scared . 
 Do we have the same classes today ? 
 Do you think the school can put us in the same homeroom ? 
 Excuse me , miss . I'm a transit passenger for Flight No . 207 . Can you tell me where to go ? 
 Where's Gate 12 ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 But our younger sister is the apple of her eye . 
 Well , we can do nothing about it . 
 What is it ? 
 Sure . And I'd like you to get some cold medicine for me when you go to the doctor's . 
 I will be hanged if I lying . 
 My car run out of petrol . 
 No idea . Your guess is as good as mine . 
 Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see . 
 Yes , would you please call me a taxi first ? 
 Credit card please . Here you are . 
 I'm sorry , sir . I'm not sure I understand . 
 Oh , I see . So , you're saying that you've already run out of your amenities . 
 Now I'm confused again ! What is the problem ? 
 Oh , I get it ! You want souvenirs ! 
 Sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items , and as a guest you get a discount . 
 I understand completely , sir . Housekeeping will bring you souvenirs in just a moment . 
 Of course . He is now 50 years old . And he started out studying alembics , singing , dancing and martial arts at the age of nine , and has tarred in 140 kung fu films . He has also become an independent producer and director . 
 I have no idea . Tell me .

 Yes , I know what the curb colors mean . 
 Mike ! What's going on , man ! Long time no see ! 
 Things doing great ! It ’ s funny running into you like this . Smell well , just last week I ran into Matt as well . 
 He ’ s doing well . We went out for a couple of beers and the funniest thing happened . 
 Well , we were talking and catching up on what we ’ Ve been doing , talking about work and family , when all of a sudden , Matt saw a mouse run under his chair and he completely lost it ! He started freaking out , and screaming ... 
 Yeah , and the funniest thing was , that he jumped on to his chair and started shrieking like a girl . You had to be there ! Everyone was staring and laughing ... it was hilarious ! 
 I would like to open a checking account . 
 Here you are . 
 We work in teams . There are about four to six people in each team . I'm training to be a team leader . Each team member is responsible for the quality of the goods we produce . We are multi-skilled so we can rotate jobs . I like that . It stops the work getting boring . 
 I'm fed up with his endless talking . 
 I can't see it . 
 It ’ s pretty good . 
 I ’ m afraid you ’ re being too particular about your food . 
 We ’ re in the same boat ! I ’ Ve eaten fast food the whole week . I hate it now . 
 Let ’ s dine out tonight for a change ! 
 Good morning . Vane Theater , at your service . 
 Well , there will be charity performance on Saturday night . And also , there will be a solo concert by an opera star on Sunday night . 
 Sure . It's to raise money for the homeless . 
 Oh , it's a reserved opera named The Monkey Creates Havoc in Heaven . 
 It surely is . And the cast is really the best . 
 The price varies according to the seats . 300 for the front , 200 for the middle , and 50 for the back . 
 Yes , please . I've been here for nearly two months , but I still haven ’ t found a job . Do you think you can find one for me ? 
 What ’ s this form for ? 
 That's great . But how long do I have to wait ? 
 Oh , dear . How can I wait for such a long time ? 
 Then , what do you think I should do ? 
 I see . Thank you very much for your advice . Bye . 
 Hello , is Jennifer in ? 
 Oh , I am really sorry . 
 Sure . What do you want to find ? 
 Well , can you be more specific ? There are a lot of websites about that . 
 O . K . Well , go to google.com , and type in “ Battle of Gettysburg . ” 
 Here , try this one . It ’ s a good site about Gettysburg . 
 For detailed information , however , you should read a history book . 
 We are on the way to the Wall Street . 
 2 hours and we will meet beside our bus . It's over there . 
 Who's that over here ? 
 What do you think of the teacher ? 
 What does she teach ? 
 Is she your teacher ? 
 Can she speak Chinese to her students ? 
 It's a good thing you can speak English ! 
 But of course ! How much are you thinking of spending on dinner ? 
 In that case , I would suggest our own hotel restaurant . The chef , the food , and the service are outstanding . 
 You can always go to Gramercy Tavern . It's quite popular , despite its expensive entrees . 
 Yes , sir . You're going to have a great time . 
 Ginseng comes in 6 different grades . It runs from 5,000 to 30,000 NT a jin . 
 You can get a liang if you want . A liang is one-sixteenth of a jin . That would be 330NT . 
 I'll have my brother cut some for you . 
 That's a lucky fruit called hong zat ! People say that if you eat them , you will have your first son very soon ! 
 Gui yuan are lucky , too ! If you eat them , you'll have a very sweet life ! 
 Oh , that's deer horn . That helps you ... umm , how should I put it ? 
 You don't have to restrict yourself to a taxi . We can offer you a private vehicle . 
 Some people find a limo to be much more comfortable than a taxi . 
 No upgrade of any kind . And where might you be going ? 
 When shall I tell the taxi to be here ? 
 The taxi will be here immediately , sir . 
 You won't have to wait a second , sir . 
 Sure . Can we use it in Today Supermarket ? 
 I really don't know what to buy . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve just come back from Scotland . 
 I only had time to visit Edinburgh . 
 It ’ s fantastic . 
 I went to there on business . 
 Yes , a lot of friends . 
 Yes . And I took many pictures . 
 I am going to the gym . Do you want to come with me ? 
 Then , I'll wait for you at the car park in 20 minutes . 
 Do you have your member card with you ? 
 Well I have a guest ticket . You can use it . 
 Who broke my chair ? 
 Excuse me , are you Jane ? 
 Oh , are you in Class Four ? 
 Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ? 
 Totally agree . What is your solution ? 
 You seem to have a very relaxed outlook . 
 But I don ’ t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses . 
 I have a resume here . 
 David , Chou . 
 These are all my personal documents about my education and working experience you asked for . And I have to be off for an important meeting now . If you think I am right for the job , please keep me informed . 
 I am sorry , but I don't have one with me right now . 
 It's 687 3452 . 
 Not exactly . Our address is ' www . zhilian-zhaopin . com . CN ' . 
 Of course . The website is ' www . zhilian - zhaopin . com . CN ' . 
 How about a laptop ? 
 How about a Mac ? 
 Our newest 15 - inch Pro is only $ 2,100 . 
 That's great . Will that be cash , check , or credit card ? 
 Okay , if you'll just sign here , please . 
 All she has to do is open the box and follow the instructions . 
 Thank you . If you have any problems , just call . 
 I use several services . Of course , I deposit and withdraw money quite often . I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account . I use my bank to exchange money from one currency to another . I often travel abroad , you see . 
 I sometimes use traveller ’ s cheques , but sometimes I travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash . 
 Yes , I do . It save me a lot of time . I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines . 
 Yes . My bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage . There ’ s a lot of competition between banks nowadays . Each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others . 
 I don ’ t have one . I prefer to buy shares . My bank also provides a share trading service . It ’ s cheap and easy to use . 
 Darling , I am back . What are you doing ? 
 B , should we get a maid ? 
 You have worked very hard in the office . If we can get someone to help you , you can have more rest . 
 You are a good wife , Julia . But you must take care of yourself . 
 Good afternoon , Miss Qi . 
 How are you feeling today ? 
 That's good.Well , these are for you . I hope you will like them . 
 I've also brought some magazines for you . I hope they'll keep you from getting bored while you're in the hospital . 
 It's time for me to leave . I hope you will recover soon.See you later . 
 Hey , young lady , get back here and have some breakfast . 
 You won't make it through the day without breakfast . 
 Breakfast is brain food . Maybe that's why your grades are Suffering . 
 Don't ' Uh , Dad ' me . Sit down and have some lovely breakfast . 
 How do you get along with your co-workers ? 
 So how do you develop good relationships in the office ? 
 I think you ’ re right , but it does seem that there are always a few coworkers that are harder to work with than others . 
 Working hours are from 8: 30 a . m . to 5:00 p . m . Be sure not to be late or absent . Report to the manager by filling in the ' Monthly Report ' every month . 
 Our company has a strict and reasonable salary standard . On the 20th day of every month , you can get your salary on time . Benefits depend upon the length of service and the employee's past attendance record . 
 All new members are likely to ask the same questions . Haha . I can understand that . Every month you have three days off , besides the weekends and some important holidays . After you've been here for a year , you qualify for a one-week vacation . The leave less than a half-day should predict for an hour , and more than a half-day should predict three days . 
 You guys are charging me $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered or saw . 
 Well , the wrong information is in my file . I was at a concert Monday night . 
 I knew you'd see it my way . 
 Am I in the Twilight Zone ? You're charging me for a movie I never saw ? 
 This is highway robbery . I've got a good mind to call the police ! 
 Miss Wang , how do you do ? I ’ m Allan James , the director of human recourse department of this company . 
 Not at all . Please sit down , then we can begin . 
 As you know , Miss Wang , we are looking for an executive secretary with business background and good English skills . We looked into your resume and thought you might be a good candidate . 
 Today ’ s interview is for us to get to know a little about you . And the interview will last a little bit longer . So , if you ’ re comfortable , I want to ask you some questions . 
 Perhaps if you would be kind enough to tell me the problem , sir . 
 Oh , no , are they back ? I'll give you another room immediately , sir , and a refund for tonight . 
 Sir , without happy guests , we are nothing . 
 Yes , I played with Tony and John . 
 We all went swimming . 
 No , we aren't . We're going to help Mr Smith to plant some flowers . 
 Yes , we are . We can neither play football nor do our homework today . 
 Yes , we certainly are . But Mr Smith is going to pay us for all the work we'll do . 
 Yes , I would like to look at some of your products . 
 Well , to be honest , I mostly use Sarah Winter products now.But I'm not happy with them . So I would like to change companies . 
 What do you have in foundation ? 
 What colors do you have in foundation ? 
 The color I use now is rose.How much does this rose foundation cost ? The 100ml bottle . 
 Wow ! That's expensive . 
 I understand . I need some mascara too.Do you have a good thickening mascara ? 
 Alright . And I want to consider your eye shadow too.Do you have a color chart I can look at ? 
 Oh , sure . I will need to clean off my own eye shadow first . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , is there any vacant room for tomorrow ? 
 Well , is there any other hotel nearby ? 
 Thank you . 
 Fine , thank you . How are you doing this morning ? 
 Yes . I've been to New York . I got back only yesterday . 
 Very much . New York is such a nice place . Shall I show you some photographs ? 
 You too . I hope to see you soon . Goodbye . 
 Bother the flies ! 
 I don't know . Something rotten here ? 
 What's the score ? 
 The Russian team needs to tie the Ukraine to get the pass for the final . 
 Hi , Madam , I'm new here , could you tell me where is boarding gate ? 
 Wait a second , please . Oh , it's CA193 . 
 Yes . 
 It's so nice of you . 
 What concoction are you making ? 
 Awesome ! I'm in heaven . Let me help . They're so easy . 
 And then you just pour the batter into the waffle iron ... 
 It takes two to make a quarrel and it takes two to mend fences . 
 Are you free tonight ? 
 Would you please go to a dancing party with me ? 
 As a matter of fact , I haven't danced for a long time . 
 Thanks for flattering me . I think you dance a lot , right ? 
 What are your favourite dances ? 
 How about samba ? 
 Then I'll see you at six . Is that all right ? 
 See you then . 
 Well , I've been looking forward to seeing you . 
 I'd love a gin and tonic . 
 Good , if you ’ ll excuse me , I ’ ll go over the sheet right now . 
 I can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high . 
 We only ask that your prices be comparable to others . That ’ s reasonable , isn ’ t it ? 
 The size of our order depends greatly on the prices . Let ’ s settle that matter first . 
 When I say your prices are much too high , I don ’ t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent . 
 To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help . 
 I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers . It ’ s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet . May I suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say ? 
 Can you fix me a cup of tea , Johnny ? 
 No . I'd like tea . Can you put it in my favorite cup ? You probably washed it ... 
 I'll find it ... Where are all the floral pattern plates ? And dad's Yankee's mug ? 
 Could I check out this book ? 
 I need to get one . 
 Okay . Let me do that right now . 
 I ’ m finished . Here you go . 
 All right . 
 Now may I check this book out ? 
 You are right . My mum must be crazy . 
 Is Mr Li in ? 
 Ok . 
 Yes , of course . I need your student ID please . 
 Okay , Susan . It says here that you are a business major and you are in your second year . Is this information correct ? 
 Sure.That ’ s not a problem.Do you have the list of courses you want to taketh semester ? 
 Yeah , that ’ s perfect . What about the subjects for your minor ? 
 Wow , you are going to be busy this semester ! Okay , here you go . You are registered now . you ’ ll have to make your first tuition payment before classes start . 
 Good morning . I need a new identification card . 
 My ID card is lost . 
 I only have my household register . 
 Here you are , sir . What do I do next ? 
 Benjamin . 
 I've brought with me some of old ones . 
 OK , what's next then ? 
 But his wife has wide relations . You may ask her for advice . 
 She is pretty . Many men praise her highly . 
 Man , that sunset is beautiful . I ’ Ve never seen one so red . 
 Really ? 
 I never knew that . 
 Well , we ’ Ve already done our part . 
 Don ’ t worry . I ’ m getting more sleep these days . The baby ’ s finally growing up a little more . 
 Is my hair done yet ? 
 How long until you're finished ? 
 I like my hair so much . 
 It's beautiful . 
 How much is it for my hair ? 
 Thanks for everything . 
 What are you reading ? 
 I thought he usually wrote horror books . 
 We ’ re going to the bookshop . Would you like to join us ? 
 Me too . I need something to read on the flight to new york . I can never sleep on planes . Sarah wants to pick up some children ’ s books for her daughter . 
 This is sure to be a worthwhile read . 
 Much better today . 
 It's a girl . 
 Sure.She is a peaceful child . 
 So they say . 
 Well.The doctor said I have to remain here for at least two more days because I'm rather weak after childbirth . 
 Does your company have a large population ? 
 Do you have more than 200 employees in the company ? 
 Hello , Mary . Why are you standing here in the cold wind ? 
 Going for a walk in such a cold weather ? 
 I see . 
 For what ? 
 All right . I ’ ll call you back later . 
 Several minutes . 
 Then , pass me a bowl for the soup . 
 Look for it yourself , please ! Kinda busy here , Daniel ! 
 Check the drawer . 
 Can it hold soup ? 
 It smells sweet . Mom and May are gonna love it . Get them for dinner , Daniel ! 
 I'd love to continue this conversation , but I really need to go now . I have to get back to the office . 
 Okay . Would you like to have lunch some day next week ? 
 Hmm . I'm afraid I can't make it on Monday . I've got to fly to Chicago on business . 
 Wednesday ? Let me see . Hmm . Somehow I think I've already got something scheduled for Wednesday . Oh , yes ! I've got an appointment with my dentist to have my teeth cleaned , and it's essential that I keep it . 
 So that leaves Friday . I don't have any obligations or commitments on Friday.How about you ? 
 You know , I really must be going now or I'll be very late . Can you give me a call tomorrow an we'll decide ? 
 Yes , I do , Susan . Just a moment . Here it is . 
 Not at all , Susan . Just tell him to leave it with my secretary when he ’ s finished with it 
 Well , I ’ Ve bought a lot of meat . I ’ Ve got pork chops , small steaks , chicken wings and plenty of hot dog sausages and hamburger patties . 
 I think so . I bought some paper plates and cups for people to use.It will save on the washing up . 
 They sell them at the shop around the corner.We can go and get some in a few minutes . 
 I have the sauce , but remind me to get some catchup at the shop . 
 It only takes a few minutes.Some people like their meat well done , others like it rare.The great thing about the barbecue is that everyone can choose how they want their meat cooked . 
 I hope you haven ’ t invited any vegetarians . 
 Sure , I ’ ll catch the train . If I can ’ t catch the train , I ’ ll get a taxi . 
 If he doesn ’ t understand me , I ’ ll show him the office address on my business card . 
 I ’ ll call you if I ’ m delayed . 
 I think the campaign is a blockbuster . 
 Finally 100 candidates ran for one seat . 
 It's hard to say . They all had an active campaign to round up the votes . 
 Maybe . Who knows ? 
 Really ? Me , too . What's your favorite flavor ? 
 Chocolate is mine . 
 I don't feel well . I need an airsickness bag . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , please . 
 Yes . I want to make a plane reservation to Shanghai , China . 
 Feynman Black . I want to leave on October 15th . 
 Well , I need an economy ticket . 
 Single . How much ? 
 OK . Here you are . Is my ticket confirmed then ? 
 OK . Thank you . 
 Yeah , he did . But he only won it by a hair's breadth . 
 Yeah . To win is the most important thing . 
 Yes , it is.It ' s wonderful after the downpour . 
 I hope it stays nice like this for a long period of time . 
 You're right.We don't know what is going to be like tomorrow . 
 The weatherman predicts a fine day today . 
 Don't be afraid . Give it a try . 
 Hi charles , I want you know that I finally found an apartment in Haitian . 
 Yeah , I am having a party this saturday night , a sort of house warming , and i want to invite you . are you busy ? 
 Around seven . 
 No , but thanks for offering , actually could you bring some fold-up chairs for people if you have any ? I am afraid not everyone's going to have a seat , do you have any ? 
 Don't worry , I will come to pick you up at about 6 thirty . 
 Excuse me , could you tell me which bus I should take to go to the railway station ? 
 How often dose this bus go there ? 
 I really can't wait that long . Are there any other buses that can take me there ? 
 Where can I find the bus ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 What is the most enjoyable part about your job ? 
 What do you find annoying ? 
 I ’ d like to buy these shoes . 
 The price tag says $ 99.99 . 
 Oh , of course . How silly of me to forget . 
 I think I have the cash . Let me check . Yes , here you are . 
 Thank you . 
 Surely , I do . It's hard to come by , isn't it ? 
 Can you get it ? 
 There's a new girl in school , have you seen her yet ? 
 I think that she is very pretty . 
 She's kind of short . 
 She's probably about five feet . 
 The first thing I noticed was her beautiful brown eyes . 
 Are you telling me that you've seen her before ? 
 Hello , Madam . What can I do for you today ? 
 OK , can I see the note and some ID , please ? 
 You do realise that you must pay a 0.2 % charge for premature cancellation , right ? 
 Unfortunately , yes . You see , this is a three-year note ; it was issued over a year ago , but not over two years . So , you will have to pay . I'm sorry about that . 
 Yes , I want to restate one more time the importance of reinventing our company's image to appeal to different customer bases . I want to end with a true story that has to do exactly with what we've been talking about today ... 
 Honey , don't tell me that you want a pet dog also . 
 Honey , you know , we don't have enough room for a pet dog . 
 No , honey , the balcony is full of boxes and things . I'm sorry . 
 We are thinking of a two days ' tour to Vienna . 
 It looks fine . Is this an inclusive tour ? 
 Dear Anna . I really love you . 
 I want to take care of you forever . Will you marry me ? 
 Am I too abrupt ? Did I scare you ? Or you don't want ... 
 Oh , I'm so happy . I will try my best to love you and protect you . I promise . 
 Let me wear you this diamond ring . 
 Here's the course description guide . 
 Do you want me to help you ? 
 Look . Here are the core classes . Everyone has to take them . 
 You're catching on ! However , there are elective courses like wood shop , metal shop , home economics ... 
 Good . Now you can pick classes by yourself . 
 That would have to be Miss Baymler , my fourth grade teacher . 
 She was patient , kind , fun , smart , caring , and yet strict , too . I really learned a lot from her . 
 She taught us that you can do anything that you want to do . 
 If you really want to do something and you work hard at it , I believe you can do it . 
 She had some rules that helped us to feel comfortable . For example , the students had to treat each other with respect , or they would be disciplined . 
 Yes . She treated us all fairly . She don ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets . 
 Well . To be honest , I usually sucked up to teachers because I wanted them to give me good grades . However , Miss Baymler didn ’ t treat me any differently . She really didn ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets . 
 As a matter of fact , I do . After she taught our class , she got married and moved to another city . Then , she started writing children ’ s book . 
 Of course ! Both children and adults enjoy her books . 
 ok ! I ’ ll bring one to you next time . 
 Your throat is inflamed . 
 Don't worry , it's not serious . You will get better soon . 
 Turn left at the second light and then go straight for two blocks . 
 No . it ’ s only five minutes walk . you can ’ t miss it . 
 You are welcome 
 Of course.Don ' t worry . I'll call one for you . 
 Yes , besides it versa according to the distance . 
 No problem . 
 You are welcome , bye . 
 Pretty well , thanks . We ’ Ve just been incredibly busy ! I need to set up a meeting for Mr . Graham . 
 He wants to go over the bonuses for this year . He ’ ll need to meet with Mr . Winthrop and Ms . Montgomery . Can you set it up for me ? 
 Here you are . We have three different colors , white , blue and pink . 
 $ 12 . 
 It is cheap . 
 $ 10 . That's the best I can do . 
 Have you graduated now ? 
 Which university did you graduate from ? 
 What degree did you receive ? 
 What courses did you take in college ? 
 Why did you choose to study Economics ? 
 Can you speak other languages except English ? 
 I am very satisfied with your answers . 
 How's it going ? 
 Excuse me , is there a department store near here ? 
 Where ’ s Wang Fu Jing ? 
 Thank you . 
 Hey , Jane ... are you familiar with our company's insurance policies ? 
 I've never really paid attention to the fine print of our insurance policies ... but it looks like I'm going to need to make a claim . 
 I have a slipped disc in my lower back and the doctor says surgery is probably the best option . Does our worker insurance cover this kind of thing ? 
 Hummum ... I think I'll have to talk to the doctor again about that.Anyway ... now that I'm going to have to make some claims , I think I'd better try and understand how the system works . Would you mind breaking it down for me ? 
 That's the charge for insurance I see on my pay slip each month , right ? 
 So workman's compensation is if I slip and break my arm while working in the office or on the job , right ? 
 How ’ s your trip going ? 
 Isn ’ t London hot in the summer ? 
 I see . What about transport ? How does Shanghai compare to London ? 
 And what about the number of people on the streets ? 
 Susan , I am inviting you and Frank to our house warming party this weekend . 
 Yes , Deborah and I are going to buy a new home in Woodlawn . 
 Well , we have always dreamed of owning our own home , but real estate in this area is extremely expensive . 
 That ’ s a good idea if you can find employment nearby . 
 Tom , it's time for you to take a shower . 
 Why ? You can't be always so lazy . 
 Alright . But you promise this is the last time . 
 Don't use a hair spray . I want my hair set and dried . 
 That's all right.Thank you . 
 We used to be very friendly , but it seems now that my daughter ’ s marriage has taken its toll of our relationship . 
 I don ’ t like her husband , that bad egg , but my daughter insists on marrying him . 
 I wish she wouldn ’ t regret for her decision . 
 I am brushing my teeth . 
 Mom ~ the toothpaste dropped on my shorts . 
 Professor Wang , what is non-tariff barrier ? 
 Can you give an example ? 
 Why ? 
 Oh , Are there other means ? 
 This is designed to exclude them from domestic market , isn't it ? 
 I ’ Ve just looked over your resume and I must admit I am quite impressed . 
 You ’ Ve got plenty of training and experience . I wonder if you could tell me something about your goals . Where do you see yourself ten years from now ? 
 interesting ! And how do you feel about decision-making ? Are you an independent thinker , or do you depend more on your superior for direction ? 
 Sounds good . Everyone is taking about teams these days . Can you describe your role as a member of a sales team ? 
 So , your experience is as impressive in practice as it is on paper . 
 Selfishness is one human beings instincts . It is very difficult to get it out root and branch . 
 His mother , not me , should do this . 
 Our place is spotlessly clean , compared with others . 
 In fact , I just swept the floor three days ago . 
 I bet nobody will care about it . 
 Yes , I can . 
 Yes , it's very interesting . 
 Sure . Take the tennis racket . Now , throw the ball up , and hit it with the racket . Like this . 
 Throw the ball up high . 
 Yes , very high . Over your head . Then you will have time to hit the ball . 
 Well done ! 
 I'm taking my date to a restaurant . Could you tell me about one or two good ones ? 
 She will want an excellent restaurant , of course . 
 I wanted to go out somewhere , not stay here . Do you know of another good restaurant ? 
 I like that ! Could you please call them to see if we can get in tonight ? 
 I heard you were teaching English over there.Tell me about it . Did you like it ? 
 What were the schools like ? 
 But you taught children , yes ? 
 They actually study after school ? 
 Hmm . That sounds pretty oppressive for the kids . Don't they ever relax ? 
 Asian cultures value learning very much . I know that . 
 But aren't the kids tired out ? I mean , they go to school all day , and then they go to school in the evening too . 
 Are the kids in Taiwan very obedient ? 
 Hmm . I know you taught in Costa Rica also.Which did you like better--Costa Rica or Taiwan ? 
 My friend finally dumped her boyfriend , and she's sworn she's going to abstain until she finds the right man to marry . 
 She's doing great , she's getting her confidence back , and her self-esteem , has improved drastically.She ' s very happy . 
 Do you have any plans for next Sunday evening ? 
 My friend , who had the mishap , wants to take us to dinner to show her gratitude for helping her . 
 She feels you gave me the freedom to be able to assist her and she appreciates that . Come on , Let's indulge her . 
 Yes . Steven Smith , room 609 . 
 Can I pay by credit card ? 
 Here you are . 
 OK . Is it possible to leave my luggage here until I'm ready to leave this afternoon ? I'd like to say goodbye to some of my friends . 
 Just three . I'll be back at 3:00 p . m . 
 Thank you . See you later . 
 Let me weigh them for you . 1.5 $ . 
 Yes . 
 You have to pay $ 0.5 more . 
 Oh ? What ’ s wrong ? 
 What happened to your brother ? 
 Your parents must be worrying about him . 
 Have you talked to him ? 
 Can you tell me what the unit price of such carpet is ? 
 The price seems acceptable for me . But I want to check whether you can supply the carpets now if we order some ? 
 That's very good . Shall we sign a contract now ? 
 Excuse me , Richard ? Are you busy at the moment ? 
 My fax machine ’ s on the blink . Would you take a look at it ? 
 I am calling to consult you about the job as a copywriter . 
 The information is scanty for me . And can you describe the responsibilities of the position ? 
 Hi Mark . 
 What are you planning to do today ? 
 Would you like to have lunch with me ? 
 Is 11:30 AM OK ? 
 I said , 11:30 AM . 
 OK , how about 12:30 PM ? 
 How about Bill's Seafood Restaurant ? 
 It's on 7th Street . 
 Beauties Picture , how may I help you ? 
 He's out of his office . 
 What do you want to be ? 
 Oh , honey , but you must know what your hobby is , right ? 
 Yes , you play the piano well . You could be a good pianist . That's good . 
 I didn't pass the English exam . How to learn English well ? Can you give me some suggestions ? 
 I have done a lot of reading comprehension exercises , and I also spend much time in memorizing English words . 
 Really ? I'll have a try . Maybe I will get high marks next time . 
 Good evening , Mr . Smith , What can I do for you ? 
 Yes , Mr . Smith , when would you like us to call you tomorrow morning ? 
 That's right . 
 OK . Good night , Mr . Smith , Have a good sleep . 
 Shall I take a photo of you ? 
 You ’ re welcome . What brings you to China ? 
 I see and what do you do for a living ? 
 That sounds like a good job . 
 Ok , well enjoy the rest of your stay here . 
 Hello . Nice to see you again . I heard you went into hospital for a few days to undergo surgery . I hope everything ’ s OK . 
 I really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital . 
 It must have really hurt afterwards . 
 I bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital . 
 Is there any pain now ? 
 Did they take good care of you in the hospital ? 
 Hi . I just lost my purse when I was shopping on the street . I guess somebody stole it from me . 
 My mobile phone , passport and some cash . 
 Just a couple of days ago . 
 I have no idea . 
 That is my friend Tim who lives nearby . 
 What's his job ? 
 But Mrs.Smith hired him to find her lost son . 
 Do you often do exercise ? 
 OK , and what kind of sports do you usually play ? 
 You ? Play badminton ? That's unbelievable ! You are shorter than a racket . 
 Says who ? 
 Oh , I see . 
 I'm a real man , and I like football . 
 I like Renaldo the most . 
 Does it come with a modem ? 
 How about the monitor ? 
 That's okay . A 15 - inch is good enough . All right , I'll take it . 
 Not much . I started exercising . 
 Yeah , and I need to start improving my health . 
 That's about all . 
 Sleep is good too . I heard people who sleep an average of eight hours a day have less health problems . 
 True . But I think it is worth it . When you get old , you want to be healthy and active . 
 Who ? 
 There ’ s nobody here by that name . 
 Where do you think we should go on holiday this summer ? 
 I ’ d really like to go to the Caribbean . We can relax on the beached and enjoy the sunshine . 
 But would it be relaxing ? By summer . I ’ ll be quite tired from doing so much work . The last thing I need is to use more energy racing around Australia . I ’ d need another holiday to recover from the holiday ! 
 Do you think so ? I ’ m not so sure . Anyway , tell me your plans for an Australian holiday . How long do you think we should spend there ? 
 That doesn ’ t sound too bad . I ’ d certainly like to go diving . That ’ s one reason I wanted to go to the Caribbean . 
 We ’ d have to plan our drive before we leave . Let ’ s get a good guidebook from the bookstore when we go shopping in town tomorrow . 
 Mm , they taste delicious . Let's settle the bill . 
 No . It's on me this time . 
 Oh , I'm starving . I'd like to try some real Chinese cuisine . What would you recommend , waiter ? 
 They are both spicy hot , I've heard . 
 They might be too hot for me . 
 What about any special Beijing dishes ? 
 Oh , yes . I've heard a lot about it . I'd like very much to try it . Where can I find it ? 
 Is it near here ? 
 Well , thank you for your information . But what is the name of that restaurant again ? 
 That's very kind of you . Thanks a lot . 
 Yes . Do you have any specials today ? 
 I have never tasted that . I would like to have a try today . 
 I need some medicine . 
 My wife . She suffers from a bad cold . 
 Fever and a bad cough . 
 What kind of medicine does she need ? 
 How many pills for each time ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Good afternoon , what flights do you have from London to Paris ? 
 The morning one , please . I want to go coach . 
 Single please . 
 With pleasure . 
 I think you are a quick learner . 
 In that case , shall I ask the waiter to bring you a knife and fork ? 
 OK , everyone . Gather around . Here are the rules . No tackling . No pushing . 
 Play is stopped when the person with the ball is touched . 
 The touchdown lines are there and there . OK , let's play ! 
 There will be a parade to celebrate National Day this weekend . 
 From Zhongshan Circus to City Bank . 
 Let's catch the waiter's eyes . We want to have a table for 4 . 
 Well , it's too close to the door . Is that table reserved ? 
 Help ! Help ! 
 I was taking a walk when a young man came at me from nowhere and snatched the bag off my hands and ran away . 
 Well , he's young , tall and thin . 
 Let me see ... my right arm ... oh , to the east . 
 Oh , I've been fine , but I'm having some trouble with my son . 
 Oh , he's 14 and in the past few months , he's become quieter and a bit secretive . He locks himself in his room and I think he's running around with the wrong crowd . 
 Well , he's become friends with a couple of older boys who are in a band . And one night last weekend , he came home really late , way past his curfew . 
 He told me that his friend's car broke down and they had to walk home . 
 I haven't yet . I just keep hoping it's just a phase he's going through . 
 You're right . I should talk to him . Sometimes , it's not easy being a parent . Thanks . It helps to get it off my chest . You're always so easy to talk to . 
 Yeah , it's really cute . But why a monkey suit ? Is Hello Kitty having an identity complex ? 
 You were born in the year of the monkey ? 
 Not at all ! That explains everything ! 
 Certainly . A letter must be sent out of the company and must be mailed or posted . A memorandum is a communication within an organization . 
 No , not necessary . Usually we have a set form which is printed . We just fill in the printed forms and send it to the person or the offices concerned in the company . 
 Bill , where are we going to stay tonight ? 
 What's that ? 
 Well , that sounds good , I have never lived in a motel . 
 I haven't told you what happened yet , have I ? 
 My boss offered me a promotion , and I took it . 
 Yes , I am really excited . 
 I appreciate that . 
 For real ? 
 I'd like to buy a bottle of Centrum , a dozen tooth brushes , some baby's wipes , and a small bottle of aspirin . 
 Give me one bottle of one hundred tablets . 
 Can I have a look at them ? 
 Are they cheaper ? 
 So if I buy a dozen , I'll get two free tubes of toothpaste ? 
 Good . I ' ll take a dozen of them then . 
 Baby's wipes . Johnson's . 
 Well , actually I'd like to buy some vitamins for my son . He's five months old . Can you suggest any ? 
 Thanks . That'll be all . 
 Yes , he was 29 then . 
 Is this American Airlines ? 
 I need to get a flight to Chicago on the 7th in the morning . Can you give me a hand ? 
 Would you like to join the drama club ? 
 Why do you want to join it ? 
 Many people say it's a good story.But I think it's boring ! 
 Whoa , whoa , what ’ s going on ? Watch out ! 
 Oh , no ! I ’ m so sorry ! Are you all right ? 
 I feel terrible , I really didn ’ t mean to knock you over . My tire , just exploded , and I lost control of my bike . Really , it was an accident . Please accept my apologies . 
 Yeah , I think we have met somewhere before . That ’ s right ! We met at Aaron ’ s place last weekend ! What a coincidence ! But anyway , I ’ m glad to see that you ’ re not too badly hurt , and I should probably get going . I have a nine o ’ clock meeting . 
 Nope , I ’ m canceling my appointment so that I can stay here with you . 
 Is this Naomi ? 
 You sure sound like Naomi . 
 Sure . Please tell her that Andy called . 
 Thanks . 
 Daniel , here is some money for the tickets . 
 Oh , like a gentleman . Two tickets for two people . 
 They may unless we get a half-price ticket for you . 
 You may ask if you can take a half-price ticket . 
 Hey Sarah , I'm having some trouble finding an apartment . Can you help me look at some listings online ? 
 Well , it has to be cheap . I don't want a really expensive apartment . 
 Sure , a studio would be fine . 
 Sure . How do you like your seats ? 
 Ok , here are your tickets in Row 13 . 
 That's fine . But you have to pay another $ 10 . 
 Yes . I'd like to change some money , please . 
 Let me see . I think maybe 600 USD at least . 
 Six hundred US dollars . 
 But I am badly in need of the amount . Might I ask you to make an exception for me ? 
 It's just too bad . I have to leave it as it is , and thank you just the same . 
 Who ’ s calling , please ? 
 Hold on a second , please . 
 Don't worry . We'll make it back to the camp site before dark . 
 Could you give me a taxi to pick me up and take me to the airport before 1:00 p . m . ? 
 I live in room 1106 of the Friendship Hotel . 
 Why are you asking me about my boyfriend ? 
 Brad Bush ? Good for you ! 
 You mean you've never had a boyfriend ? 
 Until college ? 
 Hey , Susie , what health club do you belong to ? 
 Well , I ’ Ve been going to Athletic Express , but I don ’ t like it there . 
 The people don ’ t really work out there . They just stand around and talk all the time . 
 Yeah , is your club different ? 
 Do they have a lot of equipment ? 
 Sounds nice . What about classes ? 
 Wow , that sounds great . 
 Really ? Thanks . I ’ ll stop by when I get off work . 
 O . K . , see you . 
 It's a one-year lease . 
 No , all the leases are for one year . We don't have month-to-month leases . 
 You're welcome . 
 Yeah . It's already December , you know . 
 How could we advertise our celebrations to mark the centenary of the founding of the university ? 
 That ’ s a good idea . We could put up some posters in and around the campus with a list of events . It would be quite cheap to do on the campus . 
 We could contact alumni who work for large , well-know companies . They might be able to arrange cheap advertising in exchange for some free tickets . 
 We should put some information about it on the home page of our university website . When people visit the website , they ’ ll see the information . 
 Ok . Let ’ s get to work on our advertising campaign . 
 I've tried , but I can't stand the bald man talking so loudly in the program . 
 Don't be so irritable . I just don't understand the program , that's all . 
 Ok . I will wait until you have had your fun , if that's what you want . 
 Do you want to hang out tomorrow ? 
 Really ? Wow with who ? 
 Wait a minute , you mean you met her online ? 
 That is kind of weird ! What if she is a psycho or something like that ? 
 I guess it does seem logical . I'll have to check it out ! 
 Well , he looked sharp and he came across as a very confident guy . 
 She looked a little rough around the edges but had great skills . 
 He was very distinguished , maybe a bit over-qualified . 
 Why don't you go over the resumes again ? They might help you decide who to hire . 
 what did you argue about ? 
 well , he should pay you back . It ’ s only fair . 
 did you lend him a lot of money ? 
 well , talk to him about it next time you see him . He probably feels as bad about it as you do . Close friends sometimes have disagreements . It ’ s nothing unusual . Neither of you said anything r 
 of course you should . You wouldn ’ t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ? 
 Sure . Take a seat , please . What would you like to know ? 
 A Bachelor is awarded to a student who successfully completes over 120 units , including general and specific requirements , for his or her undergraduate major and elective courses . 
 Normally it can be completed in four years . 
 How much would you like to borrow ? 
 Let me check with a credit manager . A record show your credit reading is quite high . I don't think you have any problems . 
 Our monthly interest is 1.5 % of the outstanding balance . Would you please fill out the application the form ? 
 Yes , I'd like to move to another room . 
 Yes . The air-conditioner in this room doesn't work . 
 Wang Wei . Room 1212 . 
 All right . 
 Yes . No problem . 
 Yes ? 
 Oh , let's see what's wrong . 
 Here you are . That will be five dollars . Anything else ? 
 Just a moment , I'll look up the rate for air-mail letters to South America . 
 Do you have the package with you ? I would have to weigh it to see how much it would cost . 
 Yes . All you have to do declare the value of the package and decide how much you want to insure it for . 
 The post office rarely loses package . You can , however , request a rectum receipt . 
 We open at eight-thirty in the morning and close at five-thirty in the afternoon . 
 Do you remember what the ratings of movies stand for ? 
 Does anyone pay any attention to those ratings anymore ? 
 I remember that I never saw an X moves even displayed . 
 Yea , I never see theaters turn people away for their age anymore either . 
 Are these your text books ? Biochemistry , General Ecology , Botany , Cell Genetics , Molecular Genetics ... 
 Oh , right ! Do you have many exams at the end of each semester ? 
 And when do you prepare for your final exam ? 
 Really ? You only review your lessons in one month ? Does it work ? 
 Wow , and all the key points are included in them ? You're so smart ! 
 Do you have the classrooms open for the whole night ? 
 My wife and I didn't used to spend this much money . 
 My wife has been pregnant for 7 months . 
 My wife will be going back to work soon . 
 Yes.We will need milk powder and bassinet . 
 No , my company makes cameras.Well , I'm also a photographer , but two of these are for our display . 
 Egg tarts . 
 I thought you meant vegetables and meat when you asked me . Things like that . I don't have any vegetables . 
 Confiscate ? 
 It's too bad . They are very delicious . 
 Oh , well . Not by me . 
 Thank you . 
 We went to the coast . It's really a nice place for camping , really good time around the fire singing and dancing . 
 There were six of us . 
 Yes , we got wet through . But we still enjoyed ourselves . 
 It ’ s so cool ! 
 I'm not sure . Let's look up the catalogue . 
 I advise that step be taken in power supply first . 
 His suggestion is that the work be started at once . 
 I think so too . 
 No . But I ’ m working on it . 
 I know . I know ! 
 Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll get it done very soon . I ’ m almost finished . 
 Well , it would be a lot easier to finish if you stopped talking to me . 
 What are you calling about today ? 
 Is there a problem ? 
 That shouldn't be a problem . 
 So , you want it delivered the day after tomorrow ? 
 What time would you like us to deliver it ? 
 Your delivery has been confirmed . 
 The idea about Friday the Thirteenth is totally ridiculous . I don't believe it at all . 
 Why not ? The whole idea is superstitious . 
 I know that . But that has nothing to do with being unlucky . Those who created the virus are deliberately making fun of people . 
 If you want to speed up your system , you ’ Ve got to clean it up first . 
 You need to free your disk space . The simplest way is to use a Disk-Cleanup tool to remove temporary files and in store programs that you no longer use . Things should be fine next time you start . You also need to control what starts up . There is a program calls Start-up Delayer , It can help to set after how much time programs should be loaded after Windows boosts . For example , you can choose to set your Fox Mail program to load 30 seconds after Windows starts up . 
 Do you have wake-up service ? 
 OK . I understand . 
 Well , I would prefer you to call me up tomorrow at 6:30 
 What does she do ? 
 Does she go to night school ? 
 Why ? What does she want to be ? 
 What classes does she take ? 
 Your hand is bleeding . What have you done to it ? 
 I'll get the first aid box . There's some antiseptic cream and a bandage in there . 
 What can I do for you , sir ? 
 OK . But which size should I use ? 
 I see . Should I have it bound ? 
 That is all right . 
 Excellent . How many would you like ? 
 You need to fill out this form , please . 
 That will be no problem , sir . 
 Very good , sir . Your order will be ready in one week . 
 No problem , sir . But it will cost you extra . 
 Thank you . I have roses , tulips , and daffodils . Do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers ? 
 Yes , they are . This afternoon , I ’ m going to prune the hedge . 
 Thank you ! That would be very kind of you . I have a saw in the garden shed . 
 Tomorrow , I ’ ll cut the grass . Then the garden will look perfect . 
 do you have a minute ? 
 I've made a tough decision , sir . Here's my resignation . 
 I'm afraid not , sir . I've made up my mind . It's something I have to do . 
 oh , no . not at all . 
 no , sir . 
 Oh , no . I would never look for another job while working here . I think this is a fantastic place to work . 
 it's my mother . She's sick and needs someone to take care of her . I'm the only one who can do it . 
 really ? I didn't know that would be possible . 
 thanks , sir . 
 To be frank , I was married once , and now I'm single . 
 Yes , my first marriage was a failure . 
 I am reporting a break-in . 
 It happened last night . 
 It happened at my house . 
 I don't know . 
 Someone busted my window . 
 Please do . 
 Generally speaking , there are the company , the job title , job description , requirement , and so on . 
 There are many sources , such as newspaper , Internet and direct visit . 
 Really ? It was on in 1994 for the first time . And it is really a classic . 
 I am also impressed with the lines in the movie . 
 That's my favorite . 
 It deserves . That film can give us a lot of inspiration . 
 All in all , it will never lose its appeal . 
 Sure . Now you are talking . 
 I booked a room here . 
 Brown , Jason Brown . 
 That's right 
 Yes . 
 OK . Is this all right ? 
 Here you are . 
 In cash . 
 Thanks . 
 Mind your own business . 
 Would you turn off the tap ? 
 Then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door . 
 I will have our housekeeper come right away . 
 When you woke up , the water was coming out the tub ? 
 Okay , Doctor , tell it to me straight . 
 I've tried before . Everything I've tried doesn't work . 
 May I see that x-ray again ? 
 And that is what's causing my shortness of breath . 
 What a surprise we've met here ! 
 I've been in China.Where were you ? 
 Are you sure you can't lend me five thousand dollars ? 
 It's a deal . 
 I ’ m very sorry to hear about that . So are you all right ? 
 Oh , you poor thing ! 
 Oh , it's nothing to speak of . 
 Thank you . I appreciate the compliment . 
 All right . How about this one by the window ? 
 May I take your order now , sir ? 
 Our restaurant is famous for its seafood . 
 Shrimp salad is our speciality , took 
 What would you like to drink ? 
 The Phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50 . 
 If the Phoenix beats the Rocket , it will enter the final . 
 And what's your vision ? 
 Mine's 20/20 . Life just isn't fair , is it ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 They don't have toilets at the campground ? 
 Which route are you interested in ? 
 That's a good choice . 
 We have parties every Saturday from June to October . 
 Nothing special . I just want to get plastered . 
 YY's ? That place is boring . How about Xara's ? It's real classy , and they keep the place spin and span . 
 On second thought , I think I'll join you . 
 Wow , they really went to town on this place ! 
 Sure is . Waiter , bring us two drafts , please . 
 When in Rome , do as the Romans do . 
 Is this absolutely necessary ? 
 Will you be able to make up the work you missed ? 
 Remember that I will only let you miss one class meeting per semester . 
 Could you e-mail me this week as a reminder ? 
 Make good use of that day off ; you'll only have one this semester ! 
 Very romantic ? 
 You married him for that reason ? 
 Let's go over this plan again . 
 And that is mostly flat , right ? 
 And from Winnipeg we go around the lakes through Toronto , right ? 
 It doesn't sound like that much when we go over the plan but that's a long , long ride . 
 Excuse me , sir . Can I help you ? 
 I'm sorry . We can not regulate the air-conditioner . As soon as the plane takes off we'll be able to get better ventilation , and the temperature here will drop . Let me get a wet towel for you at the moment . 
 Your wet towel , sir . 
 Yes . We have mineral water , orange juice , coke , which do you prefer ? 
 Would you like some ice in your drink ? 
 How much would you like ? 
 Here you are , sir . 
 It's my pleasure . 
 How slowly you drive ! 
 Where does it go wrong ? 
 Can it keep going ? 
 I've got to go home and study . 
 The test tomorrow . 
 Jenny is going to marry another man next month . 
 But , how can you be so calm . You loved her so much . 
 He said I have a big nose . I wonder what that means . 
 Does he mean I am inquisitive or I ’ m noisy ? 
 who is your favorite NBA star ? 
 Kobe ? I know him , the key guy of the Lakers , a heck of a NBA player . He is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense . 
 Maybe he is not good ay rebounding ? 
 Kobe came to Beijing during this summer's Olympics . Did you go to the match between China and USA ? 
 well then , what are your spoils ? 
 What post have you held before ? 
 How many places have you worked altogether ? 
 Thanks for inviting me . Here is the gift for you . Happy birthday , Francis ! Many more happy and healthy years for you ! 
 Yes , please do . 
 Yeah , I was really struggling whether I should give you this nice little car . It was the last one they had and I really like it so much myself . 
 Hello , there . How can I help ? 
 Certainly , Visible Treasury Certificates . Then you can get a receipt from the savings office as proof of payment . Hence the ' visible ' , you can see it . 
 The minimum is 100 RIB , and the maximum is 500,000 RIB . 
 Yes , they are different because they are printed by the Ministry of Finance in set amounts . Just 100 RIB , 500 RIB and 1,000 RIB , you cannot choose from many amounts , you see . 
 How many times have you been here ? 
 I would like to sit near the window . 
 Thank you . 
 Fast food restaurants are popular now . 
 I'd like to have a steak sandwich and a medium fry . 
 Coke please . Oh , no , a cup of hot chocolate will be fine . 
 Yes , sure . To be honest , nobody would like to work overtime . However , we have to if it is necessary for our company . I would do that if it is the call of duty . 
 OK , I completely understand . 
 To be honest , I was just dumped . 
 No , thanks . I'm not in the mood for traveling . 
 I was planning on doing a lot of wallowing . 
 Where is that ? 
 What's there to see ? 
 Oh , sounds nice . 
 Ok . Then I can make up my mind . 
 I decided to take Kenny to the park and get some fresh air . 
 It wasn't too crowded , but we had a great time ! We got on the see-saw together , then went on a couple of different slides and then I tried to go with him in the jungle gym , but I didn't fit . 
 Yeah , but today he was really hyper . He even got on the monkey bars and then he went on to go on the swings for a half hour . I'm exhausted ! 
 Hello ? 
 Nothing . Just watching TV . 
 Sure . What time ? 
 Sounds good . Where and when will we meet ? 
 All right . See you then . 
 Indeed . I love the smell of the grass and trees . They certainly refresh my mind . 
 Sure . Did you hear anything ? Look ! An eagle is hovering in the sky . 
 Yes . Will it hurt us ? 
 OK . I have a good pair of hiking boots . It should not be a big problem . 
 You are kind . Look there is a big tree over there , it looks like a thousand-year-old tree . 
 How do you know ? 
 Dam it , I'm running out of money again , I really need to balance my budget and handle my money better . 
 But I make it . 
 I work hard so I deserve to enjoy , but that costs money . 
 The problem is that I have no idea . I didn't pay attention . 
 This man is your fiance , Dolly ? 
 He's handsome . 
 He's outgoing and honest , but sometimes he's a bit conservative . 
 It's right here . $ 100 . 
 Ours are of really good quality . 
 Mark ? What were you up to yesterday ? I called you , but there wasn ’ t anybody home . 
 How ’ d it go ? Did we win ? 
 Did you like the play ? 
 You're absolutely right . The acting could be better . 
 Hi , I'd like to return this radio . 
 Here it is . 
 It does not work very well . 
 No . I'd just like a refund . 
 How about a movie on Sunday , Mum ? 
 We could find a classical one . 
 I like to drive on freeway . 
 Don't worry.There ' re few cars now . 
 May I take your order now , sir ? 
 Chef ’ s salad for starter . And what would you like to have for the main course ? 
 How would you like your steak done ? 
 And what would you like to go with your steak ? 
 Potatoes ? 
 Thank you . 
 Everything is gone , sir ? 
 Is there anything in particular you want ? 
 Got it . Anything else ? 
 Not a problem . Anything else ? 
 Someone will be up shortly with your order , sir . 
 Let me feel your forehead . I'm so glad it wasn't strep throat . 
 But I'm not sure you're strong enough yet . Here's some seafood rice soup I made . It's delicious . 
 But the last two days were a weekend . 
 So , Is this your first time to TAIWAN ? 
 Oh , really ? And you are from the State , right ? 
 Oh , I am so sorry . 
 Hi , David ! What are you doing ? 
 Actually , I'm not good at tennis at all ... 
 Oh , come on . That's no reason to do something you're not interested in . 
 How about the Classical Music Club ? 
 Hey-how about the Cinema Club ? 
 Jack I hear you have a chance to go to college without taking a test . Is that right ? 
 Don't hesitate . That's a very famous university which a lot of students are longing to attain . 
 But this chance is really precious . 
 I hope you can make a clever choice . Anyway , the opportunities around you are not that By . 
 Hey , Shirley . The party has been wonderful . My husband and my children have enjoyed it very much , and me too . 
 I surely will . By the way , is the party like this held every weekend in our neighborhood ? 
 My children would like that ; they like dancing very much . 
 Look ! Who is that guy on the stage ? 
 Really ? 
 He performs very well . He is so funny ! 
 OK , that's perfect ! By the way , is there any playground in our neighborhood ? 
 OK , got it ! Thank you so much . You have helped me a lot ! 
 Tim ’ s smiles are interesting . 
 You are right . They sweep Nancy off her feet . And now she fell head over heels in love with him . 
 Do you like shopping at flea markets ? 
 The antiques market here in Paris is very famous . It's called Le marche aux puces de Saint-Ouen . 
 It's also known as Les Puces , which means ‘ The Fleas ' . 
 Well , it really depends . Because you are a tourist , it might be harder for you to get really good prices . 
 Hello , I would like to make a reservation for four nights next week , from Tuesday to Friday . 
 Single room with a bath room , please . I would like a room with a view of the whole city . 
 What's the rate , please ? 
 Does that include breakfast ? Can I make calls on outside line ? 
 OK , that's fine . Could you hold it for me ? 
 Do you think you could keep the noise down ? 
 Yes . And another thing , would you mind not making long distance calls ? 
 Can I help you , madam ? 
 Have you any particular color in mind ? 
 Red is very popular . 
 Yes , madam , I agree . What size are you ? 
 Here you are , madam . All these are sixteens . 
 It's $ 180 . 
 These are our cheapest coats , madam . 
 Here's your change . 
 I could get along fine without all the office politics . 
 There is a position I've had my eye on for several months now and I had good reason to believe that it was mine for the asking . 
 We were awarded government funding last year and in order to keep it we have to hire so Ay new employees . 
 Someone in the main office has a nephew who he thinks can slide right into the Management position I wanted . 
 I hear you're entering the speech contest , Mike . 
 Well , I wish you good luck ! 
 We have a dinner reservation for four at 7:00 under the name of Foster . 
 Thank you . Would it be OK if we have a cocktail while we are waiting ? 
 I would really prefer an outside table . Would that be possible ? 
 Sure , that would be great ! Thank you ! 
 Yes , I would like a vodka gimlet , please . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Yes , we're all proud of her ! 
 Cheers ! 
 Thank you all the same . 
 I was planning to go to Beijing first and then go to northwest China ! Looks like I'm in trouble . 
 No way ! I don't think I've ever encountered winds that strong ! Are the storms affecting land and air transportation ? 
 That's exactly where I was planning to go ! 
 I need to get my internet fixed . 
 It won't connect . 
 This problem has been happening for a few days now . 
 It just won't connect to a webpage , but it will pop up . 
 I'm going to need someone to come and fix it for me . 
 How long will it take for them to get here ? 
 Can you help me pick out a gift for my daughter ? 
 Yes , that sounds like a good idea . 
 Okay . How much ? 
 Oh , that sounds great . I'll take it . 
 Here's my VISA . 
 Everything I need is in this box ? 
 Thank you for your help . 
 Good afternoon . I'd like to speak with Tom Smith . 
 Do you know when he will be back ? 
 Is there some way I can get into contact with him ? 
 Thanks . And could I have his e-mail , just in case I can't get him by phone ? 
 Thank you so much . Does he read his e-mails daily ? 
 Great . Thanks again . You've been very helpful . 
 What is this big box at the front door ? 
 What did you get yourself into ? 
 So , what's in the box ? A fridge ? 
 I guess you'll read the fine print next time , won't you ! 
 Mail room . Karen speaking . 
 Certainly , Mr . Williams . Just one moment , please . 
 excuse me , could you tell me which line I ’ m supposed to stand in to buy bubble wrap and to post a package ? 
 that ’ s a really long line . How long do you think it ’ ll take to get through all those people ? 
 can I buy stamps here ? 
 I need 30 for my Christmas cards . 
 twenty of them are going abroad to China and America . 
 no . 
 and the bubble wrap ? 
 thanks a lot . You ’ Ve been very helpful . 
 Well , we have some new Barbie dolls . 
 Here's one — the new , beautiful Digital Barbie . This doll is hot ! 
 It's only $ 29.95 . 
 That's great . Anything else ? 
 The grand total is $ 32.42 . How would you like to pay ? 
 Thank you so much for shopping here . Here's your change and receipt . 
 Hi , Rich . Is Jim here ?

 Also , please place your carry-on luggage either under your seat or in the overhead compartment . 
 Allow me to give you a hand . 
 Yes , furthering my education is already bringing about positive results in my workplace as it has boosted my confidence.As well the tutoring system my school employs offers courses uniquely suite 
 As well my company has been very supportive about my decision.They ' Ve cut back my working hours in order to accommodate my studies . 
 They are.We definitely see eye-to eye on my enhanced performance being a win-win situation for everyone involved . 
 Yes , I would like to . 
 Good evening , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 OK , please fill in the form first . 
 We will send it to your room at 4:00 pm tomorrow . 
 We have express service as well . It charges 30 % more but I assure your coat will be ready tomorrow morning . 
 I am sorry to make you run down to the office for me . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 What about jeans ? It's the fashion now . 
 Then , how about this ? 
 What is your hobby ? 
 What kind of reading materials do you like best ? 
 The hotel operator . Anything I can do for you ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . I'm afraid it is often the case during the peak hours . Shall I ask them to call you when the line is free ? 
 No trouble at all . May I know your name and room number ? 
 I see . Wait in the room , please . 
 How about 15 % the first six months and the second six months at 12 % with a guarantee of 3000 units ? 
 It's about the best we can do , Smith . We need to hammer something out today . If I go back empty-handed , I may be coming back to you soon to ask for a job . 
 Good . Let's iron out the remaining details . When do you want to take delivery ? 
 Let me run through this again , the first shipment for 1500 units to be delivered in 27 days by the 31 st . 
 Fine . But I'd prefer the first shipment to be 1000 units , the next 2000 . The 31 st is quite soon , I can't guarantee 1500 . 
 Tom , this deal promises big returns for both sides . Let's hope it's the beginning of a long and prosperous relationship . 
 Yes , sir , let me show you the table . This way please . 
 Of course . 
 I'm here to ask about a loan . 
 I got married not long ago and we are expecting our first child . I'd like to buy a car for the family . 
 Could you tell me what the requirements are for that , please ? 
 Yes , I do . I was born and bred here . 
 I have all of that with me . I've also banked here for a number of years . 
 What kind would you like ? 
 That's going to be about $ 2.48 . 
 What else can I get for you ? 
 That's going to be $ 4.05 a pound . 
 That will be $ 12.15 . 
 That's fine . Let me get your meat . 
 I don't want to . 
 Certainly not . 
 Turn on the TV for what ? 
 Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ? 
 To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate it . 
 Hello , I need to make a dinner reservation . 
 We will be coming to your restaurant on Tuesday night . 
 Our first choice would be 7 
 Four of us will be coming . 
 Great ! Our last name is Foster . 
 I look forward to having dinner at your restaurant . Thank you for your help . 
 Nice to see you again , too . Peter . How's your family ? 
 Not bad , But she's as busy as before . 
 Hi , I ’ m Henry Wilson from number 37 . 
 Yes . Everything is fine in the apartment . But I know nothing about this area . Could I ask you some questions ? 
 Can you tell me the postal code for this building ? 
 Thank you . Also , how can I get my mailbox key ? 
 Who ’ s Peter ? 
 Thanks a lot . I ’ Ve got one more question . 
 Where can I change the address on my driver ’ s license ? 
 Can you give me directions to the office ? 
 Yes . 
 What floor is the office on ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Good morning , sir . I am ready to check out now . 
 May I have my bill now ? 
 Cash , please . 
 My mother works in a company as an accountant . 
 Not always , she's rather busy at the end of the year . 
 These drawings on the wall are process sheets . 
 They describe how each process goes on to the next . 
 Yes , your wife and your dentist called . 
 You're welcome ! 
 I like them very much . They are delicious . 
 Daniel , hold on for a minute . What are you trying to pull there ? 
 Oh , you want my chocolate cakes , so to speak ! 
 Daniel , carrots contain much Vitamin C . It is good for you . 
 Oh , stop it ! You know you need vegetables . You will end up fat if you don't watch your diet , now . 
 Well , Peter . I'm sorry you're ill . What's the matter with you ? 
 Show me your torgue.What did you eat yesterday ? 
 Did you eat any cake ? 
 Did you eat any ice cream ? 
 Did you eat any candy ? 
 Young man , tell me everything you ate yesterday evening . 
 I see ! How many pieces of cake did you eat ? 
 How many plates of ice ream did you eat , young man ? 
 Steward ! 
 May I have a magazine or something ? 
 One in English , please . 
 Pete's Pizza , may I help you ? 
 Will that be for pick-up or delivery ? 
 Can I get your phone number ? 
 And your address ? 
 Would you like to have dinner with me tonight ? 
 You are really career minded . 
 May I help you ? 
 Of course . How many people are there in your party ? 
 OK , I will arrange it for you . 
 Good evening , this is housekeeping . May I help you ? 
 Yes , sir . We'll be there shortly . 
 Everything is OK now . 
 You are welcome . It's our job to keep things running smoothly . 
 It is worth 100 yuan and your bill comes to 230 yuan . The difference is 130 , please . 
 Thank you , sir . Could you sign the voucher here , please ? 
 Thank you , sir . Hope to see you again soon . 
 You have ordered a red dress , is that right ? 
 Yes , here you are . Try it in front of the mirror . 
 Yes , where do you want to go ? 
 This is the right bus . 
 Certainly . Four more stops after this . I ’ ll call out the stops . 
 Are you ready to order yet , sir ? 
 Yes , sir . It'll be a moment . 
 I'm tired . 
 Yeah , I need to take a break . 
 All my relatives are getting together at my house . 
 Who can't make it in your family ? 
 That's too bad . So , what did you ask for Christmas this year ? 
 I want some computer games also . I gave my parents a really long Christmas list . 
 So what does your family do on Christmas Day ? 
 Our family is a little different . We go to church on Christmas Eve instead . 
 Ok , maybe we can order a soup and a salad from the restaurant down the street . 
 You eat too much junk food . That sort of stuff clogs up your arteries and is very high in cholesterol . 
 It's not only about getting fat or not , it's about being healthy . You could really have some health problems later on . 
 You are a lost cause . 
 Frans Smith ? I think you may have the wrong number . 
 It is . But there is no Frans Smith here . Do you know which department he works in ? 
 The accounts department , no problem . I'm just putting you through now . 
 Yes.But Mary is no match for Susan in painting . 
 Excuse me . Nature calls . 
 Excuse me . How much for a two liter bottle of Coke ? 
 How come so cheap ? 
 I ’ ll take one . And here is a dollar . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Yes , sir ... 
 Yes , sir.Go ahead . 
 Sir , does this apply to intra-office communications only ? Or will it also restrict external communications ? 
 But sir , many employees use Instant Messaging to communicate with their clients . 
 This applies to internal and external communications . 
 Is that all ? 
 I failed the exam because I didn't study . 
 Could you do me a favor and proofread my resume before I send it out to the human resources department ? 
 But languages don't have anything to do with engineering . Shouldn't everything I put on my resume have something to do with my field ? 
 It's just a piece of paper , you think that they can tell if I am a well-rounded person by looking at it ? 
 I'm sorry to trouble you but there is a lot of noise in next room . 
 It ... , I think the neighbor on the right . 
 I'm not sure , but I think so . I'm very exhaust but I can't sleep . 
 If the nest room is still noisy , could you give me a different room please ? 
 Yeah it's too bad ... but actually I think I know what to do . 
 We can go to a horror movie , and I'll hold your hand so you don't get scared . 
 Of course ! Or are you still too scared ! 
 Would you like to go to the natural history museum with me ? 
 Yes , lots of time . I was quite impressed by the wide variety of exhibitions they have . 
 I need to purchase some business cards . 
 I think 2,000 would be fine . 
 I want the new cards to be exactly like this card . 
 ... Okay , I'm done . Here's the form and my old card . 
 You know , I think it would be better if I could pick it up in three days . 
 Could you tell me the origin of the Dragon-Boat Festival ? 
 I see.Did they succeed in the end ? 
 Is there a medication you can prescribe to help me with my problem ? 
 What is available ? 
 Are there many side effects ? 
 Is that the only medication I need to take ? 
 What are the side effects of that drug ? 
 I really want to get something to eat . 
 I don't know what I want to eat . 
 Chinese food sounds good . 
 I haven't the slightest idea . 
 You like Panda Express ? 
 Maybe I'll go there then . 
 Are you alright , Ethan ? You don't seem to be as cheerful as you normally are . 
 What happened ? 
 What did your boss say ? 
 That's horrible . Was that the first time you'd shown up late to work ? 
 Is your boss Chinese ? 
 What are you going to do ? 
 That sounds like a sensible plan . Do you want me to help you with your job search ? 
 Don't mention it . That's what friends are for ! 
 Yeah , I deleted all that superstitious crap . What a waste of bandwidth ! 
 Do you really think the Dalai Lama sent that ? I'm tired of all these forwards . 
 My name is Helen Levin . I'm the HR director of our company . 
 Nice to meet you , too . 
 Really ? Who did you hear that from ? 
 Did you find what you were looking for ? 
 Okay , let's both look for it now . 
 I'm going to see the doctor this weekend . 
 I think I need a thorough check-up . 
 Where on earth are we going to borrow at 3 % ? 
 You can knock off another 2 % for that . 
 Not quite , if we get too heavily in debt , the shares will tend to drop . 
 I would like to have notice of that question , I will give you an answer in a week . 
 Hi . Is there a special rate for a group reservation ? 
 I need five single rooms in October . How much of a discount can I get ? 
 Front view , please . 
 October 25th around 2:00 in the afternoon . 
 Ok . I ’ ll send a check . 
 Sure . My name is Anderson . My address is 109 Ferguson East , Holton . And my phone number is 309 789 1267 . 
 How long would you stay , sir ? 
 Would you please fill in this registration form ? 
 Excuse me , sir . I've made a tough decision and here is my resignation . 
 I'm sorry to bring up my resignation at this moment , but I've decided to study abroad . 
 Thank you , sir . I'd like to say that I ’ Ve really enjoyed working with you . However , I think it ’ s about time for me to leave . 
 Thank you . 
 I want to try on this suit . 
 I'm afraid it's too narrow across the shoulders . Do you have a larger one ? 
 It's a bit loose . Do you have a middle size ? 
 What a pity ! 
 Yes , we have one and it faces the beautiful sea . 
 OK , we will make it ready for you . 
 do you like animals ? I really like dogs . 
 why ? I think cats are ok . 
 I like wild animals . I don ’ t like spiders and snakes . I think spiders and snakes are disgusting . 
 I think bears are wonderful . Pandas are fantastic . I low the people who kill them for their fur . 
 really ? I don ’ t see the attraction . I ’ m afraid of mice . 
 Have you traveled by air before ? 
 Let me tell you . First you must buy a ticket . 
 Then you must go to the airport . 
 Not Yet . Listen to me . Don't forget to take your ID card with you . 
 Something like a passport . 
 No , you also need a boarding pass . 
 You'd better prepare for the examination . 
 You should change your attitude , or you will not pass the course . 
 Good morning , sir . May I help you ? 
 What do they look like ? 
 How tall are they ? 
 Do they look like roses ? 
 Oh , lilies of the valley . No , I am sorry . We are all out of them right now . 
 What about roses ? 
 As many as you like , sir . They are beautiful , aren't they ? 
 Bye . Take care . 
 It seems that many boys are fighting there . 
 Are you planning on studying abroad ? 
 Good afternoon Sir , may I please see your passport and reservation ? 
 I'm sorry sir , this flight has been cancelled due to some mechanical problems . 
 We apologize for any inconveniences that may be caused by this . If your flight is urgent , I can put you on a waiting list for another flight this evening , but it's on a first come first served basis , so there is no guarantee that you will be able to take that flight . 
 Well , If you can wait until tomorrow , we will put you up in a hotel for today and you can take scheduled flight for tomorrow morning . 
 Thank you for your understanding sir . I will book your flight now . 
 It is hard to guess now . Both of the teams chose the excellent players this time . I guess the game will end in a tie . They are equally matched . 
 Which side are you on ? 
 Wow ! AC wins . It is a close shave , you know . 
 What a good goal ! 
 Hello . I hope you can help me ; I'm a little worried about my new card . 
 I received my new card this morning , but I'm unable to use it . 
 No , it's right here , see ? The ATM will not accept it ! 
 Yes . I was told it would be activated and ready to use right away . So , what's gone wrong ? 
 Well , that explains it . I've been using my old PIN number ! Thanks for explaining everything to me . 
 What's the matter ? 
 Let me see . 
 No , the damage is minor . 
 4:00 p . m .. 
 I've known from your resume that you are a college graduate . 
 What did you take as your major in college ? 
 What kinds of work were you in charge of in the previous company ? 
 All right , I see . Why do you want to work for a Sino-American joint venture enterprise now ? 
 Well , Mr . Zhang , you must know , what we need is a capable accountant , and we won't have enough time to tell him some other things . 
 What did you usually do as a head nurse ? 
 How to maintain a high standard of nursing ? 
 I am glad to have the opportunity of visiting your corporation . I hope we can do business together . 
 I am interested in your hardware . I've seen the exhibits and studied your catalogues . I think some of the items will find a ready market in France . Here is a list of requirements . 
 I will do that . Meanwhile , could you give me an indication of the price . 
 What about the commission ? From European suppliers , I usually get a 3 to 5 % commission for my imports . It's the general practice . 
 You see I do business on a commission basis . A commission on your prices would make it easier for me to promote sales . Even 2 or 3 % would help . 
 I ’ m so excited , mother . Oh , a new baby ! 
 And my first nephew . He looks a lot like you , mum . He does . 
 Yes , he does have Richard ’ s eyes . The baby even looks like you than Richard does . 
 It ’ s true . Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways . And she is shy with new people just like he is . 
 You ’ re right . 
 I met her about one year ago . 
 That's right . We've been dating since last September . 
 Certainly . 
 Come by any time . 
 Yes , I'll be waiting for you in my home by 10:00 . 
 Yes , please . I'd like a gin and tonic . 
 Thank you . How much is it ? 
 Here's 30 . Keep the change . 
 I am confused by what he said . 
 I don ’ t know what he wants to do . Does he want help me or just scold me ? 
 Have you got the medicine yet ? 
 Well , these are for internal use.You take a packet each time.Four times a day . 
 They're painkillers.You take one tablet when you feel a pain , but not more than once within four hours . 
 How can I help you today ? 
 What would you like to return ? 
 Was there something wrong with it ? 
 What isn't working on it ? 
 Alright , do you have the receipt ? 
 I'm going to take care of this and refund your money . 
 Good afternoon , need any help ? 
 That's right and your flight number is CA621 . 
 Excuse me , sir . Flight GB105 is one to Milan , are you sure of your change ? 
 What are you up to tonight , Steve ? 
 That sounds like fun . Have a good time . 
 He has no sense . 
 But Joe won't you . 
 No , I'm full . 
 Yes , I'd like some coffee . 
 That's OK . I'll have a glass of water . 
 Small please . 
 Thanks . 
 I need to go to the bank . 
 Closed ? Are you kidding ? What is it , some kind of holiday today ? 
 Oh , it's the first of April , April fool's day 
 So I have , but I has reminded me at least one thing I need to remember . 
 Tomorrow is my wife's birthday . 
 Are you ready to order , madam ? 
 Yes , We do have some choices for ladies like you . What about some green salad ? 
 Sure . It's a popular dish among young ladies . 
 We have three kinds of dressings for salad . Italian , French and Thousand Island . Which one would you like ? 
 OK . Do you want to order something else ? 
 What's the special today ? 
 I don't like to . 
 Yes , I'm very fond of seafood . 
 I'd like to have red cooked sea cucumber . 
 Bring me an assorted cold dish , please . 
 No , thanks . I'm fine . 
 A bottle of champagne . 
 Look at the icon in the bottom corner of your screen . Is it flashing ? 
 OK . Try closing down all the files you're not using at the moment . 
 Have you tried pressing the Escape key ? 
 OK , you ’ ll need to reboot your machine . Press Control , Alt and Delete at the same time . 
 You might lose the file you were working on , but don't worry , the help desk can restore it . When did you last take a backup ? 
 Here . Catch ! 
 I have a fifteen-day vacation and I want to have a trip to England . Is there any route that fits me well ? 
 That's wonderful . By the way , what kind of cabin will I have ? 
 Where are you from ? 
 What do you expect to be doing five years from now ? What are your medium-term career goals ? 
 I'm sorry , Julia ! I can't get home early this evening . 
 I know , darling . But I do have a lot of work to do , hope you can understand me . 
 Hello , Julia ? I can't hear you clearly . I'm afraid the line is out of order . Okay , B , listen ! How about I hang up now and call you back later ? 
 What kinds of meat are most popular in your country ? 
 Yes , we do . we also eat mutton . 
 That's right , mutton chops taste so good , we eat them with sauce , have you ever tried ? 
 Certainly I can , I'll buy some from butchers ' and cook for you next sunday . 
 Good morning . Mrs.Smith . 
 Well , what kind of books does she like ? 
 I see . Has she read any detective stories ? 
 Do you know if she's read this one ? 
 Ah ! She has a bad memory . How old is she ? 
 I suggest you take this book . It's very exciting . 
 Good evening , sir . What's your pleasure this evening ? Your usual ? 
 Certainly , a beer . Here you are , sir . 
 Don't worry . I'll make you another on the house . 
 May I make a reservation ? 
 The four of us will be there at 7:00 this evening . 
 Excuse me . Could you tell me how to get to the post office ? 
 Good morning , Ms Chan . What can I get you today ? 
 Shoulder chops , Ms Chan ? 
 Would you like to choose a chicken ? 
 This one is our cheapest . 
 Yes , of course , Ms Chan . 
 I don't quite remember . Why did you ask that ? 
 Oh , my . What did you do ? 
 Did you call the police ? 
 Hello . 
 Hi , Dad . Where are you ? 
 Thank you , Dad . 
 I love you , too , Dad . 
 You have to bring me an add sheet to sign . Do you have one ? 
 You must take the signed add slip to the Admissions and Records Office to add the class . Do you know where that is ? 
 The office is in front of you as you cross the quad . The signs in the hallway will tell you where you need to be . 
 You'll find it easily . Make sure you add the class and then we will look at the roll sheet later to make sure that you were added on . 
 To drop a class , you need to do the same thing with a drop slip . Good luck ! 
 What's the hardware ? 
 That's seems obvious enough . Then what about the software ? 
 I see , actually the hardware is the easy part , I do want to study how to use the software . 
 Ever since I saw computer can do your project , I wanted to have a computer . 
 Thank you , Rick ! As you can see , ladies and gentleman , we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to win the grand prize of one million dollars ! 
 All right , we are here at the eighth hole . It ’ s a par four , and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid . Although , I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole ! 
 Oh no ! Not a good swing at all ! It ’ s definitely not his day today . On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot . 
 Oh no ! A bear ! Run , Tiger , run ! Somebody call animal control ! 
 No , I just check my weight , I'm getting fatter . 
 I'll get you for that comments , George . 
 ah , I don't know a fit works . Last time , all I saw the gym were bunch of lidos , like me . 
 All right . But so help me it's a better work . 
 Not me . I'm too hot and I'm too tired . 
 Well , that's not for me . 
 It wasn't as good as you think . 
 What's Ron Marston like , Pauline ? 
 What did your boss say to him ? 
 Did he telephone again last night ? 
 What did you say to him ? 
 Did he telephone again ? 
 I'm tired of you always wearing my clothing ! 
 But it's the White House . The president and his family live there.They won't let us see most of it . Probably we can only see a couple of rooms . 
 Hmm . If that's true , then the security there must be very good.Because it's strange to think they will let people walk around in the White House . 
 So I can't take my gun then . 
 Yes , it's true I don't . 
 What ? Do you think someone will arrest me for making a joke ? Someone will arrest me here at the breakfast table ? 
 I'll be careful . Don't worry . I don't want to get arrested by the FBI.But how long does the White House tour last ? 
 Alright . We should take a taxi over there right after breakfast . 
 That's a good idea . Do you want some more coffee ? 
 I bought it . I got a watch , too . The company that sells this car has a car club . 
 Yeah , and meet other drivers of the same car ! 
 I know girls love this kind of car . Look , it's got a sunroof ! Imagine ... a cool , starry night ... 
 No . I borrowed it to go shopping . 
 Thanks . I finally got rid of that old Nissan that got me through college . 
 No , it ’ s last year ’ s model . 
 $ 14,500 . It only has 10,000 miles on it , so it ’ s like a new car . 
 Well , sometimes , I think it ’ ll be nice to drive to work instead . We ’ ll see . Want to go for a ride ? 
 Come on . 
 I feel cold , and I'm shivering . I have a terrible headache and a sore throat . 
 About a day . 
 Ah ... 
 Not so good . 
 Your pulse is weak . 
 Yes , you have a high fever . I'd like to give you a blood test . 
 no , of course not . Go ahead . 
 yes , now that you mention it , I think we had a chemistry class together in high school . 
 What did you do after high school ? 
 I took a year off to go travelling . 
 I went all over the world . It was the best year of my life . Where did you go to school ? 
 Oh , did you study a foreign language ? 
 that's a very difficult language to learn , isn't it ? 
 so you can speak Chinese ? 
 I think most languages take a lifetime to learn well . 
 Certainly . It ’ s actually the Chinese New Year and is regarded by the Chinese as the most important holiday of the year . 
 Family members usually get together on the Eve of the New Year and have a special dinner to celebrate . Relatives and friends often visit each other during the holiday to wish each other a happy new year . 
 Yes , just like Christmas in western countries , it is a time for eating lots of special food . 
 I've had enough of it while working under the sun in the day . I don't need any more sun-tan . 
 It might be good to you . But please keep in mind that too much tanning damages the skin rather than does any good to you . You might end up with skin cancer . 
 Can you give me the number for Jessica Hanson on locks Ave ? 
 Yes , I ’ m pretty sure . 
 Yes , I do . It ’ s 109 Locks Ave , L8V 4N9 . 
 I see . Thanks anyway . 
 Is everything OK , Madam ? 
 I can help you with that . Holiday , you say ? Lucky you ! Where are you going to be travelling to ? 
 That is one option , Madam . If your are travelling to either Hong Kong or Macau we are permitted to exchange up to 1,000 USD for you . 
 Today's rate is 823 . 71 RIB to 100 USD . 
 Yes , it's not bad . I will need to see your passport though . 
 Yes , show me your tickets please . 
 The train is driving after ten minutes . 
 It's over there . Have a good trip . 
 How much is this shirt , please ? 
 Do you have it in a larger size ? 
 You know Ernie , it seems we both like the same artists . 
 But if we're going to start a band , we have to be able to sing and dance . Can you do that ? 
 Great ! I'll sing , and you can dance in our band . 
 What kind of movie is it ? 
 Oh , I've no interest in such films . 
 Thank you , Mr . Jackson . 
 How do you do ? Those women are very hard-working . What are their jobs ? 
 How do you do ? They aren ’ t very busy ! What are their jobs ? 
 Who is this young man ? 
 I had fun talking to you . 
 I think we should really do something sometime . 
 What do you want to do next time ? 
 Yeah , let's do that . 
 I'll call you so we can set that up . 
 All right , see you . 
 How long will it take for our order to be delivered ? 
 Fine , we will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control . 
 Just remember . The main thing right now is to make sure Stars.com is happy . 
 Elvin , please . Can I count on you to keep your cool for a week , or not ? 
 By the way , how's the nose ? Boy , that must have hurt . 
 I ’ m going to visit my brother . he ’ s just had a baby . He lives in Minneapolis . 
 I ’ ll be here for approximately three weeks . See , here ’ s my return ticket for the twenty-sixth of March . 
 My brother , here , this is an invitation letter from him . I will stay with him and his family in their home . 
 Well , I own a house . actually , I ’ m leaving my dog there with my neighbors . I have a car at home , and oh , my job ! I ’ m employed by Tornal as an engineer . Actually , I only have three weeks ’ vacation , so I have to go back to work at the end of March . 
 Well , I do have assets in my country . like I said , I own a house , and see , here ’ s a bank statement showing my investments , and my bank balance . 
 Wow . Look how polite your son has become . 
 ABC Rent-a-Car . May I help you ?

 Hi Jim . Do you have a minute ? 
 Some of us are going to start a soccer team . Would you like to join us ? 
 That ’ s all right . We ’ ll teach you . 
 Not very much . It ’ s something like hockey , except that you use a big ball and no stick . 
 Good idea . I think you ’ ll like it if you give it a chance . 
 You can come back in twenty minutes , and it will be ready . 
 Yes , you can have it delivered or filled at any location in our HMO . 
 You need to take it at bedtime . 
 Don ’ t mix alcohol with this medication , but you can take it with or without food . 
 You might feel a little dizzy at first , but it should pass . 
 Let me try . It has to be somewhere amazing , and far away ... Egypt ? 
 Yes . I overheard your mom and my mom talking in the grocery store . 
 I wish our family took outrageous summer vacations like yours . 
 We'll get to go fishing at the river . I hate fish . 
 Hm ? Oh , that's Alice . She's totally mad . Don't get yourself in a room alone with her . 
 Yes , I know , but she's dangerous . 
 Well , I'm not one to gossip , as you know , but rumor has it that she sued her former boss for sexual harassment . 
 Well , this is just between ourselves , of course , but he was her lover and he wanted to leave her , so she got revenge . I heard him say she was a dangerous woman . 
 Oh , while we're on the subject , what happened to you and your secretary ? 
 Oh , come on . Everybody knows . 
 Oh , sure . 
 Have you found a suitable job ? 
 But as to me finding a good job is the most important thing . 
 Good morning , Miss Monica . Nice to meet you again ! 
 After the internal discussion , we have all agreed that you are the most suitable person for this position among all the candidates . So , today let ’ s talk about your expected salary and social benefits . What is your expected salary ? 
 The basic salary for this position in our company would be 4800 Yuan to start with increases giving according to your performance . 
 40 hours a week , Monday to Friday , 9 AM to 5 PM with one hour lunch break every day .. 
 We do expect overtime work when it is necessary , but we pay twice of the work hour for working on weekends and three times for working on national holidays like Spring Festival and the Mid-Autumn Day . 
 No probation is involved . If you feel good , you can start next week . 
 Hello , Steven ! 
 Not bad . What about you ? 
 Why ? 
 How is your family ? 
 Where are you going now ? 
 OK , see you next time . 
 Car trouble center . How may I help you ? 
 Hold on , before you kick your car let ’ s go through some possible problems . 
 OK , first of all , can you turn the key in the ignition ? 
 Those are possible problems , but tell me , when you turn the key , do you hear the starter motor crank ? 
 No . If you step on the accelerator pedal you can flood the carburetor and your car will never start . 
 I know this may seem like a silly question , but does your car have gasoline ? 
 Excuse me.When ' s the next bus ? 
 Oh , good.That ' ll be the number forty four ? 
 So when's the next forty-four ? Will it be here soon ? 
 So when will it be here then ? 
 Never ? 
 I hope the teacher decides to curve our test grades . 
 She did last time . 
 Who is it ? 
 You're always so careless . 
 Okay , but I haven't prepare supper . 
 What do you want to eat ? 
 Dumplings . 
 Yes . In fact , the recommendation letter written by the university is an indirect self-recommendation . In the long period of cooperation , the university has established good relationship with the companies or organizations , they trust each other well . If your university recommends you , you can be approved more easily . 
 More and more persons have the same discoveries since most universities do that in order to save energy . If your university also does like this , you can look for other methods , because such kinds of recommendations say nothing for you . 
 It depends . If it has something special or useful , I suggest you send it out . 
 Yeah , why not ? We haven't been out for dinner for quite a long time . A new French restaurant has just opened in our neighborhood . We can go there . 
 No need for that . It's not usually busy on weekdays . 
 Why not now ? I'm hungry . 
 I need the haircut . But you seem so busy today . 
 Ok , but how long I have to wait , it is going to be more than 30 minutes . 
 Thank you . 
 Ok , thanks . 
 Yes , please . 
 Actually , I'd like a booth by the window if that's possible . 
 This will be fine , thanks . 
 Thank you . 
 What are you talking about ? Where is your Halloween spirit ? Didn ’ t you ever dress up in a costume and go around the neighborhood trick-or-treating with your friends ? 
 Whatever , I ’ m going next door I heard Mrs . Robinson is giving out big bags of M & Ms ! 
 Yes , it's most irritating . 
 We're going to do something about it . 
 We can't put up with it any more . 
 I don't think so . 
 Why don't we call them ? 
 Good morning , Sir . Can I help you with something ? 
 I see . Yes , the advertisement has proven very effective . Would you like to apply for a card with us ? 
 That's right . But don't worry ; it's a very simple procedure . 
 Of course , it can be done right this minute . If you could just fill in this application form for me ? Do you have your ID card with you ? I'll need to see that . 
 Yes , please . That's being processed now . As soon as the account is set up , we can issue you with a card . 
 It was nice talking to you . 
 I really have to go . 
 I have things to do . 
 Don't be nosey . 
 Well , it's really none of your business . 
 I'm sorry , but I have to go . 
 The acting of this film is marvelous.In spite of the thin plot , the acting , the music and the scene have won the Academy Award of this year . 
 Don't be too critical.We can't expect it to be perfect . 
 Good day . I ’ m looking for a one-bedroom apartment today . 
 Well , I didn ’ t want to pay more than $ 900 a month . 
 Is it furnished ? 
 No , thank you ! I want to take an apartment , not a prison . 
 Do you think I should buy this now and bring it with us ? 
 Good morning . Elly company . 
 Hold on , please . 
 Pardon me , but I was wondering if you could break a one . 
 I need the change for the stamp machine . 
 We'll take the route No . 10 . 
 Just two . How much does the trip cost ? 
 Is there any chance of a lower price ? 
 Can I take a picture ? 
 What a pity . Do you have reproductions of this paint ? 
 Thank you . 
 No problem . How would like your money ? 
 Here you are . Please sign your name here . 
 The art critic from the daily chronicle doesn ’ t think much of the max oreo exhibition . He says that the artwork is uninspiring and old fashioned . 
 I liked it . I didn ’ t think his works were masterpieces , but the certainly weren ’ t uninspiring , in my opinion . 
 I like landscapes and still life . You prefer abstract paintings , don ’ t you ? 
 I agree . I prefer oils too . I collect landscapes , but I only have a small collection . You have a small collection of abstract art , don ’ t you ? 
 That would be nice . Can you read the characters ? 
 I think that ’ s true with any of the fine arts . 
 I am the apartment manager . How can I help you ? 
 I haven't rented it out yet . Would you like to see it ? 
 How about today at 6 p . m . ? 
 Very good . We'll meet at 6 . Do you need directions ? 
 If you're interested , you can fill out an application form . 
 No . The only thing I need to see is your driver's license . 
 I'm planning to go to graduate school , but I also want to find a job . Otherwise , I'll have nowhere to go if I fail the entrance exam . 
 career path ? I'm not sure . 
 I want to become a professor , a lawyer , an editor , a civil servant ... 
 I don't know . Do you have any advice for me ? 
 I think perhaps I need to buy a few years while I figure out about my career . 
 thank you so much for your advice . I'll think it over . 
 Horowitz , I beg to differ . Even in your most recent study , the investigative approach was flawed ! You know as well as I do that the collection of data was not systematic , and there is a large margin of error . To draw a definitive conclusion based on that data would be misleading 
 You are trying to single-handedly solve one of the world ’ s greatest mysteries , and yet you are oblivious to the fact that you are wrong ! 
 No ! The egg came first ! 
 I know , Mr . Douglas . But I am really sick . 
 I understand , sir . I ’ ll bring a doctor ’ s note in tomorrow . I am sorry , Mr . Douglas . 
 Yes , a little . 
 I'm sorry . I can't quite follow you . Would you mind speaking slowly ? 
 I'd like a hamburger and a cup of coffee.My room number is 402 . 
 Thank you . 
 That's funny . My watch always loses ten minutes a day . 
 I am serious . Every morning I set my watch by the radio , but it still loses ten minutes . 
 Throw it away and buy a new one . 
 So you put your watch back ten minutes every day ? 
 Why bother ? Just buy a new watch . It doesn't cost much . Besides , I just can ’ t put up with this thing any more . 
 I have no idea yet . Do you have any suggestions ? 
 I'd like to . 
 OK , will do ! 
 Hi , is Heather there please ? 
 Is this 617-228-2289 ? 
 Heather Johnson . 
 Do you know where she went ? 
 Yes , would you please tell her Eric Martin called ? 
 Oh , yes . How are you ? 
 OK . Thanks . 
 What sort of experience do you have ? 
 Where was your last job ? 
 Why did you quit your last job ? 
 The taxi drivers are on strike again . 
 They want the government to reduce the price of the gasoline . 
 How long will it take to learn English ? Will I be able to take other courses next semester or will English take up all of my time ? 
 You mean I could finish this course and still not know English ? You ’ Ve got to be kidding ! 
 So do we have to stay in this English class forever ? 
 So it ’ s really the same story . Practice , practice , practice and more practice is the only way to learn a language . 
 I feel absolutely horrible . My temperature is 41 degrees Celsius , and I've got a headache and a runny nose . 
 I've also got a terrible stomach-ache . Is my face still swollen ? 
 Yes , for the most part . It doesn't feel as bad as my other ailments , anyway . 
 No , the burn ointment seemed to take effect right away . I think it's already healed . 
 I scalded on the hot coffee a few days ago . 
 No , but I'm sure I'll get better soon . 
 I took the red ones just before lunch and the white ones just after lunch . 
 Just some water , please . Do you have any ointment for my nose ? It feels so itchy after blowing my nose so much . 
 that sounds good . 
 Why are you handing me a plastic cup ? 
 How am I supposed to do that ? 
 What am I supposed to do with the cup when I am done ? 
 What kind of test is this ? 
 How long will it take to get the results ? 
 I enjoyed talking to you . 
 We should hang out some time . 
 Is there anything you would like to do next time ? 
 I'd like that . 
 I'm going to call you soon . 
 See you soon . 
 I ’ m not sure what you expect me to do , Michelle . You ’ Ve not been very clear about any of this . 
 Yeah . I think that would be a good idea . I ’ m really in the dark on everything . 
 Did you hear what happened to Mike last night ? 
 Well , apparently he had too much to drink and got into some kind of trouble . Typical , isn't it ? 
 Well , I don't know the details , but ... 
 What did he say ? 
 What kind of intermediary is it ? 
 What job did he recommend to you ? 
 Does he ask you to pay some fees ? 
 Then what do you think about it ? 
 Sure , but you must verify that first and don't easily make a promise . 
 Good luck ! 
 Yes . I am looking for a restaurant with a cheerful atmosphere . 
 Well , thanks for your help . 
 Great idea ! Peter , I could use the drink . 
 Sounds good . The food there is fantastic , too . 
 excellent ! That sounds like a plan . 
 It depends on the time of year . At peak times we hire in casual workers to help with packing and dispatch . We also contract out certain services all year round , for example , cleaning . We run a very tight operation ! 
 Sometimes we use a local employment agency . It depends on the job . 
 It's very hot , the temperature is often over 40C . 
 Not really.But I like it in spring and fall . I don't like it in winter . 
 The winter is very rainy , I don't like the rainy day . 
 I lived there for three years . I like summer but I don't like winter . 
 Yes , it is.But it's nice in spring and fall . 
 I don ’ t know whether I am a Barbie Doll or you are one . 
 Well , I am not going to flog a dead horse . Let get down to our brass tasks and tidy these things up . 
 Well , as I know this company is one of the largest and best in this field of business . It mainly produces toys for children . It employs more than 10,000 people throughout the world . The president now is Mr . Jackson . The Shanghai branch was founded five years ago with a staff of more than 2,000 . 
 May I work in sales department ? 
 I ’ m paid 2,000 yuan per month plus some allowances and bonus as that come to about 3,000 yuan a month . How much will you pay me ? 
 Do you have any fringe benefits ? 
 How about insurance and full health insurance ? 
 That sounds good . 
 yes , come on in . how's your new job going ? 
 that's great . I knew you'd do a good job as a manager . 
 how's your assistant manager getting on ? 
 what seems to be the problem ? 
 if you gave him another 30 days , do you think he could figure it out by then ? 
 I see . Not everyone is cut out to work in management . 
 there's an opening in the creative design department . It involves working with computers . 
 Can you exchange this for US dollars , please ? 
 OK . Here . 
 Five tens , five fives and the rest in ones , please . 
 I'm sorry . I've lost my tags and receipt . How can I do about it ? 
 It's a suitcase . But I've forgot the exact color . Maybe it is red or something . 
 It's like this . It's square with a leather cover . Yes , I remember , there is a green string around the handle . That's right . 
 Yes , It is the right one . 
 Here it is . 
 Hello , this is ABC Corporation . May I help you ? 
 Yes , but do you have any experiences as a sales manager ? 
 That sounds fine . Please give me your name and phone numbers . I ’ ll set up an appointment for an interview for you . It will most likely be in a couple of days . Is it all right for you ? 
 Thank you . 
 No kidding . Time is running out . 
 Vince says he can't afford anybody else . We're got to come through . 
 I guess we'll either make it , or we won't . 
 Hello , may I have a double cheeseburger ? 
 That sounds great . 
 May I get a large order of curly fries ? 
 Get me a medium Pepsi . 
 No , thank you . That's it . 
 Thanks a lot . Keep the change . 
 Of course , what do you need ? 
 Is there something else you need that you can think of ? 
 Do you want me to make any other stops while I'm out ? 
 Is it ready to be picked up ? 
 No problem . I'll do that for you . 
 It's no problem at all . 
 Young people enjoy pop songs more . 
 But you don't have such a problem as to pop songs . 
 Good evening . My wife and I would like a room , please . Is there any room available ? We don't have a reservation . 
 Good . We're tired after driving all day , and we're looking forward to relaxing in a comfortable room . 
 How much is it for one night ? We only need it for tonight . We're going to continue our trip in the morning . 
 No , it's just the two of us . 
 Credit card . We don't like to carry much cash with us on our trips . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Excuse me . May I ask you some questions ? 
 Could you please tell me how many credits would be required for a bachelor's degree ? 
 OK . And how long does it take to get a bachelor's degree ? 
 I see . Thank you very much . 
 Tomorrow's Carl's birthday ? 
 Good idea ! Let's make ready , then . 
 Yes , of course , please follow me . 
 This is our courtyard . 
 Yes , about 46 square metres . 
 Yes . 
 They don't have enough time to peel it after they harvested them , so they hung them in the tree . Then in winter , they can peel corn ears in their leisure time . 
 Dad , can you buy a new camera ? My old one has gone west . 
 So , you didn ’ t buy a good one for me . This time how about a better one ? 
 What's on Channel 12 at 8: 00 ? 
 Do you want to watch it ? 
 Do you eat a lot of fruit and vegetables in you country ? 
 I like them very much . We also eat a lot of vegetables in my country , buy we eat different kinds . 
 We eat a lot of sweet corn , broccoli and eggplant . 
 Why is it relatively expensive ? 
 I see . We grow a lot of fruit and vegetables in my country . We export a lot of melons , grapes , oranges and lemons . In your country , do you eat corn on the cob ? It's very popular in my country . 
 Do people usually buy frozen vegetables in your country , it ’ s very rare in mine . 
 How much will it be all together ? 
 Can I pay by check ? 
 OK . How about this card then ? 
 Have you got anything for diarrhea ? 
 How should I take this medicine ? 
 I see . I'll follow your instructions . 
 Thank you . 
 We have so Ay ! But my favorite happens at Christmas Eve . 
 Well , all the brothers and sisters get together and fill the Christmas stockings for the litt 1e kids . 
 Well , in fact it's fun for us to just be together that night and do this one thing . 
 You should be there some Christmas Eve . 
 Please , call me Ted . 
 That ’ s no problem . 
 Well , what kind of salary do you provide ? 
 I see . 
 Sounds fine . 
 Yes , one last thing . How much holiday time do you give your employees every year ? 
 How about sick days ? 
 Any other benefits ? 
 Great . Thanks so much for your time . 
 Tell me something about your work experience . 
 What systems have you worked on ? 
 Do you feel comfortable with the new system by microcosm ? 
 What do you consider your strengths ? 
 Good morning , sir . Do you have a reservation ? 
 I see . We have a window table reserved for you . 
 Would you like to order now or wait for a while ? 
 Abby Park Hotel . Can I help you ? 
 Certainly sir . Could I have your arrival and departure dates ? 
 We have a double room for you with a nice view of the park . Would that be OK ? 
 It is ninety-five pounds per night . It is a double room with a bathroom . There is a fridge , coffee maker and a television in the room . 
 All our bathrooms have full size baths with a shower attachment . 
 Yes , all our rooms have complimentary wireless Internet . 
 Yes , breakfast is included in the price . Our guests have the choice of a full English breakfast or a continental breakfast . 
 Certainly , Sir . 
 I see . 
 Sure . 
 No problem . 
 No problem , sir . Just tell me your name , phone number , and date of reservation . 
 Okay , sir , let me hit the delete button , and your reservation will be cancelled . 
 Not at all . 
 Oh , I remember , there is a job fair in the personnel market . 
 Really ? I have been there several times . 
 Yes . The personnel market is a place specially for job-hunters and employers . 
 Yes , there are many famous corporations . 
 Every Saturday and Sunday 
 No , it's free . 
 OK , let's go . 
 Yes , I wanna buy a skirt . 
 I am not sure . 
 Ok , thank you . 
 pompous . How may I help you ? 
 How large a group are you expecting ? 
 Would you like to reserve a private dining room ? 
 All right . May I have your name , Sir ? 
 It would be nice to go to the beach sometime this weekend . 
 The weather this weekend is supposed to be warm . 
 I think it will be . 
 I want this trip to be perfect , I hope it stays warm . 
 I know . Every day the weather seems different . 
 That would make it easier for us to make plans . 
 I've been waiting here in the conference room for ten minutes already . What time does our meeting start ? Where is everyone anyway ? 
 What ? The meeting was proponed ? No one told me anything about it . 
 What memo ? There haven't been any memos this whole week . I check my unbox every day , and I haven't seen anything . 
 You know how things get piled up on my desk when I am busy — I know that sometimes I do misplace things , but I always read all the memos that go around . They go directly to my in-box . Are you sure it was sent to the whole office ? 
 I'm usually too busy to take a bunch of coffee breaks and gossip by the water cooler . Anyway , I am sure the memo never got to my in-box . I'll have to talk to our secretary about it . 
 Could I change these pounds for dollars , please ? 
 It doesn't matter . 
 Yes , I'd like to know the exchange rate for yen . 
 Whew ! Thanks , Karen . That car almost hit me . 
 For my part , xiangqi . Maybe it's because my girlfriend is Chinese . 
 Quite right . And unlike the soldiers in xiangqi , the pawns in chess can promote once they reach the furthest rank . It is very agreeable to grant merits to people with good performance . 
 Yeah , and though the king in chess doesn't have bodyguards , he has a queen who is the most powerful piece . I think this demonstrates the relatively higher social status of aristocratic women in medieval Europe than in China . 
 You mean , xiangqi pieces are allowed a larger space in which to move around ? 
 Would you please make a skirt for me with this material please ? 
 I like miniskirt . 
 When can I get it ? 
 Thank you , see you then . 
 Room service.What can I do for you ? 
 Have you turned on the air-conditioner ? 
 I am sorry , sir.We will send our staff right now . 
 Do we need food ? 
 What are you going to get ? 
 Maybe you should go and look in the refrigerator . 
 Just get the basics . 
 You know . Get some eggs , milk , and bread . 
 Fine , I'll go do that for you . 
 Yeah , it's very easy . But it's above Nick's head 
 He's always confused by easy questions . 
 You can never do that . 
 There's been bad blood between them since Bobbie took away John's girlfriend . 
 We ’ re in the last stretch of this very exciting race , and Kimmi Rikknen is leading the pack with only four laps to go ! They are heading to turn three and Lewis Hamilton tries to pass Rikknen ! It ’ s a close one and , oh no ! Hamilton hits the wall ! 
 The cleanup crew is towing the heavily damaged car and the green flag drops ! Rikknen is still in the lead with only two laps to go ! 
 How unlucky for Rikknen , and this race is over ladies and gentlemen , Alonso takes the checkered flag ! 
 Today is Thursday . 
 Today is May first , 2003 . 
 Well , I don't think so . 
 Hi . I ’ m calling from Room 209 . I couldn ’ t find the TV Guide . Can you send me one , please ? 
 Yes . There is one more thing . 
 The mini bar door was open when I checked in . I didn ’ t use it . Could you send someone to check it out ? 
 Thanks . 
 No , I didn't . 
 I'm not sure where they sell bus passes at . 
 Where should I go ? 
 I had no clue that I could get it there . 
 Thanks for letting me know . 
 I'm going to go and get it right now . 
 I needed some money , so I hocked it last week . 
 I had just enough money to make ends meet until payday . Then last Wednesday I received a phone bill to the tune of $ 195.00 . I hit the ceiling when I saw that . 
 I'd forgotten that my brother had used my phone earlier this month to call his girlfriend . He forgot to mention that she happened to be in New York at the time 3000 miles away . 
 Thanks , but tomorrow's payday I can make until then . Thanks any-way . 
 Yes , Mr . Ford . The dentist will be ready to see you in a minute . Have a seat . 
 Mr . Smith , do you like the hotel we booked ? 
 I've come to make sure that your stay in Beijing is a pleasant one . 
 The plumbing in my new apartment is not working . 
 The bathroom sink is stopped up . 
 Just the bathroom plumbing seems to have a problem . 
 Everything worked beautifully until a few hours ago . 
 I am not sure if I will be home later . 
 Steven , why are you so depressed ? 
 What's the news ? 
 It's horrible . 
 Yes . How about donating some money ? 
 Just find the answer through Internet . 
 Mark , can you dress the twins for me while I take a shower ? 
 Please ! You can do it . Their clothes are all laid out on the bed . 
 Are you referring to KC getting her head stuck in the pant leg ? 
 Don't worry ! Today they are wearing dresses ! 
 So how long have you know Jack ? 
 Really ? You guys must be really tight . 
 He seems sincere , and trustworthy . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Oh , my ! Really ? I never thought he would be like that . 
 So , can I trust him or what ? 
 But I need someone that I can count on for this job . 
 Come on you're confusing me.Give it to me straight . 
 What do you do ? 
 Good morning , sir ! Please know some about our latest products . 
 They are our products . Please come in and have a look . This is the catalogue for our products . 
 Of course , here you are . 
 Would you sit down and write down your name and address here ? 
 This is the latest design for our products . The design of I-series keeps the fashion in a close way . The sales volume of the new product is about 50,000 per month . And we received many orders from many clothes companies . New functions and attractive outlook are the key points for our products . 
 Why ? It's unfair . How about going dutch ? 
 Oh , come on , I almost forgot . Don't worry about it . I didn't mind picking up the tab last time . 
 Ok , but it's only for this time . 
 It's 12 dollars 80 cents all together . But don't forget the tip , it usually 15 % . 
 I need some flowers for my girlfriend . 
 Oh , no . Carnations are not very elegant.Artificial flowers have no passion . 
 Money is no object . 
 I will take ten . 
 Of course . Can I have it delivered to my girlfriend's house this afternoon ? 
 That's ok . Here is the address . 
 Sure . How about the tweed ? 
 Hello , I bought the pendant in your shop , just before . 
 Now I come back to the hotel and try to show it to my friend , the pendant is broken , I'm afraid . 
 Would you change it to a new one ? 
 Yes , I do . 
 Thank you so much . 
 It's not just spreading out to new markets that we have to address . I think we'd better first pay attention to developing our brand in the markets we already have.We ' Ve reached the awareness level , but we haven't established customer loyalty . People know who we are , but they still don't trust in our brand . 
 Have you ever done your shopping at Whole Foods market ? 
 The food there is wonderful . 
 I prefer the food at Whole Foods . 
 Sons doesn't offer a lot of organic foods . 
 Yes , that's the place to go to get healthier food . 
 If you like Sons , then I'm sure you'll love Whole Foods . 
 Hi , Mr . Smith . I ’ m Dr . Hawkins . Why are you here today ? 
 Yes , well you haven ’ t had one for ... five years . You should have one every year . 
 Well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . So , try to come at least once a year for your own good . 
 Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ? 
 Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . You really should quit . 
 Well , we have classes and some medications that might help . I ’ ll give you more information before you leave . 
 I ’ d like to post this letter to Korea . 
 No thank you . I ’ d like to send it just by normal post . 
 Thank you ! I am interested in your product . But I am not familiar with your corporation . 
 No wonder . 
 Thank you ! 
 Hello ! I'd like to reconfirm my flight reservation . 
 It's flight CA169 , which leaves Beijing at 8: 00 a . m . on January 20th . 
 My name is Deng Li . 
 Oh , no . I'm sure I made a reservation for a first-class ticket . 
 That's what I should do . And I don't want to lose it . 
 OK ! I shall . 
 Yes , I'd like to know if the company provides opportunities for further education . 
 That's very generous . 
 Thank you . I appreciate the time you've given to me . 
 I'm not sure if we've got any now.Books of that kind are on this shelf.Well , I'm afraid we've sold out . 
 Come some time next week if you like . I think we'll have got some by them . 
 That's unfair , Mom . 
 Dad is bigger than you , but how come I'm smaller than May . 
 What should I do ? 
 Got it , Mom . 
 Mom , don't worry about me , I can do it . 
 OK . Bingo ! We win . Give me five , Mom . 
 I just had a complete physical examination and passed with flying colors . 
 I understand that . 
 Well , that is the chart showing our company ’ s organizational structure . 
 Ok . On the top , Mr . Thomas , the managing director , is responsible for running the company . 
 Four . They are production department , finance department , sales and marketing department and HR department . I directly report to Mr . White . He is on a business trip and is suppose to be back this morning . Probably you will be meeting him at lunch . 
 Mr . White , too . 
 Sure . Where shall I begin ? 
 I went to the university of Ohio , in America . 
 I got a bachelor ’ s degree . 
 I majored in English and minored in Chinese . 
 I graduated with honors . I had a 3.9 . 
 Yes . I ’ d like to obtain a master ’ s degree in international relations . 
 After I have 3-4 years of work experience . 
 Reservations . Can I help you ? 
 How long will you be staying , sir ? 
 What kind of room do you want ? 
 A single room with a front view is 100 dollars per night , one with a rear is 80 dollars . 
 Linda , would you care for some candies or cookies ? 
 You are not really chubby . You are actually thin enough . 
 So you are watching your weight , aren't you ? 
 Good morning . Do I need an appointment ? 
 Thank you . 
 I've been wearing my hair long for years , but now I'd like to try some kind of modern style . What do you suggest for a woman like me , that is , with hair like mine ? 
 I hope so . I'm really tired of this old-fashioned style that I've been wearing . 
 Yes , if you think it will help . 
 It's great ! Will it be hard to care for ? 
 By all means . 
 Yes , I do . I ’ d prefer you didn ’ t . The AC ( air-conditioning ) is also on . 
 That ’ s not a very good idea . It ’ s quite hot outside . Why don ’ t you smoke outside ? 
 Though the AC has the air-purifying function . I ’ d still rather have fresh air than smoke . Are you okay with that ? 
 May I fix an appointment with Dr.Cui ? 
 When will it be convenient for her ? 
 How about ten o'clock tomorrow ? 
 Ok , I ’ Ve got an up-to-day map . Let ’ s check the route from here to the airport . 
 No , we turn right . Remember that we are coming from this direction . 
 How far is that ? 
 According to the map , we get off the M11 at the second junction and join the M25 . That ’ s the motorway that goes around the edge of London . 
 Then we drive west on the M25 . we must be careful to turn in the right direction ! 
 Then we take the first Heathrow Airport . What ’ s the total distance ? 
 22 miles to the M25 , 33 miles on the M25 , and 3 after that . That ’ s a total of 58 miles , isn ’ t it ? 
 We can only go fast on the motor ways if there isn ’ t much traffic . I think we should allow ourselves plenty of time to get there . Being early is much better than being late . 
 Let me see . Go straight on , then take the first turning on the left . 
 Twenty minutes ’ walk at most . 
 everything's great . And you ? 
 no , I haven't had a chance to . But I've been watching a Chinese TV series called Chinese-Style Divorce . 
 yeah . I found it is so close to our life . 
 you said it . You know , the divorce rate has been on the rise in recent years . 
 I know a couple who divorced a week after getting married . 
 that's true . It's said the short-lived marriage is typical of the post - 80s generation . 
 definitely . They don't take relationships and marriages very seriously . 
 I think , as the saying goes as the saying goes haste makes waste , it is the same thing with marriage . 
 You see , I have these Euros , and of course they are of no use to me at the moment . So I'd like to save them in my account , but I'm not sure how to go about it . 
 I see . What's the interest like on those ? 
 Yes , I couldn't agree with you more . A 1 year time deposit it is ! 
 No , thanks . I ’ m just looking around . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Do you have any English songs ? 
 Let me have a look . Everything I do I do it for you 、 Unchained melody 、 My heart will go on . Oh , and I ’ d like to try Everything I do I do it for you . 
 Is it easy to locate it ? 
 I used to be a better singer . I haven't sung in the Karaoke for a long time . It's your turn . 
 That's really my pleasure to listen to a Chinese song . 
 I think there's too much violence and it did no good to my little boy . 
 It's really hard to avoid such bad influence anyway . 
 Yes , what's in the package , madam ? 
 How would you like to send it ? 
 Do you want to insure it ? 
 3 dollars . 
 It's quite good . I will take it . 
 Well . I am a traveler from China . Would you please mail to China ? 
 Verry sorry to have kept you waiting so long . What do you want , Madam ? 
 How long would you like your haircut today ? 
 You wanna tight , medium or naturally curly perm ? 
 How about you hair style ? 
 Well , with perm we can do very kinds patterns such as bob , chocolate hairstyle or bang.Which do you prefer ? 
 It looks wonderful . 
 What do you think of it ? 
 Liu , two days later , you will be in England . Don't you feel excited ? 
 Have you got everything ready ? 
 By the way , have you double checked your flight time ? 
 This is the schedule for the project . Any comments or questions ? 
 Don't worry . These dates are only targets . 
 Fine , thanks . How about you ? 
 Yes , there is one at Sanyuan Bridge . It is a famous restaurant in the city . 
 I think so . I think you'd better make a phone call to see whether there is a table available . 
 Here is a tourist guidebook . You can look it up in the book . 
 It's a pleasure . 
 Of course . It's the best one I have here---and it's only 300 yuan . 
 Really ? Even for such an excellent one ? 
 I just don ’ t find it very interesting . 
 I think that for a lot of people , it ’ s just a way to try and show their country is better than other countries . 
 I ’ m not sure about that . We still have many wars in the world . I think that the idea behind the Olympics is a good one , but the reality is that during the Olympics countries compete . There ’ s no real spirit of cooperation and people are usually not very friendly to each other . 
 Well . I think that the most amazing performances are by athletes who participate in the Paralympics . 
 Excuse me . Are you Mr . Smith ? 
 Oh , I'm so sorry . 
 Hello . What can we do for you ? 
 Certainly . That shouldn't be a problem . Tell me , do you have a Basic Account with us ? 
 Oh , that's good . We will come to our final decision based on your credit rating , the payment capability ... 
 I'd like to extend my visa for another two years . 
 Student visa . 
 I'll go into a practical training as soon as I receive my Master ’ s degree from the University of Pennsylvania early next month . 
 OK , folks , let's get to work . We need to come up with some ideas for the new essentials perfume campaign . This is a really big contract and we are under a lot of pressure here to impress the client . 
 The reason I have called this meeting is to review a proposal we have received from our international division in Hong Kong . The agenda for this meeting is as follows , first , a presentation of the new proposal by Mr . Black . Second , an analysis by Ms . Nielson . Finally , a discussion about whether or not to implement this proposal . 
 Maybe you two should go see a marriage counselor . 
 What are the odds of finding a parking space there ? 
 I'm afraid I spilled coffee on the tablecloth . 
 I want to apologize . Is there anything can do for you ? 
 Hello , My name is Candy Brown . May I have your name ? 
 Nice to meet you , too . Where are you from ? 
 I was born here . 
 It's nice talking to you . But I have to go . 
 OK . It's 15066688866 . Call me ! Bye-bye , then . 
 Excuse me , sir.Is there a barber near here ? 
 I'm a stranger here.How can I get there , please ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 I have an issue . 
 There were charges on my debit card that I never made . 
 I do . 
 It ’ s the last four charges . 
 Is that going to take long ? 
 That ’ s wonderful . Thank you . 
 Thanks.You too ! 
 Well , my family's away and I can't afford to do much.What about you ? 
 Marry ; Mr . Johnson wants these documents to be copied . 
 I'm afraid ... 
 Well now that I know what kind of movies you like , tell me , what's your least favorite kind of movie ? 
 I know ! I don't get them at all . But wait , isn't ' Terminator ' a sci-fi movie ? 
 I hear Jean married a business tycoon . 
 But I don't think she really loves him . 
 If I were her , I wouldn't marry a man I don't really love . 
 The weather is terrible . 
 I'm wearing my heavy jacket . 
 Will it snow today ? 
 Yes , when it snows , every where is white . It's very beautiful . 
 Good idea . 
 Stop fussing ! It is said that the training is important for our newcomers . And my company also informs me to attend the training next week . 
 I disagree with you . Companies usually make a workable and reasonable plan for the trainings , so as to improve new comers ' understanding of the company and its rules in short time . Through the training , we get to know many things , such as the corporate culture and spirit . Our newcomers can really grasp the essence of the company 
 If only we'd remember to close it . 
 I wish I'd put it in the bank . 
 I know , I am sorry I ever bought it . 
 It's a pity they didn't take the tele . We need a new one . Anyway we can claim for all this from the insurance company . 
 You know Iden , I don ’ t know much about you . Where were you born ? 
 What was your childhood like ? 
 Do you get along with your parents now ? 
 Where did you go to university ? 
 What ’ s your current occupation ? 
 Did you always know you wanted to be a writer ? 
 How did you start writing ? 
 Are you writing a book now ? 
 Sounds interesting . 
 Well , I'm looking for some winter clothes . And I notice you have pre-season sale on all your winter apparel . 
 Do you have any skirt that will go with this sweater ? 
 I don't think that shade of green will go with my complexion . Do you have any of those skirts in black or tan ? 
 Oh , yes . Just show me where the fitting rooms are now . I can't wait to try this on . 
 It's certainly a tight schedule . 
 At what time ? 
 Do you know how far you will be from the airport at 5 ? 
 So you are not sure how long it will take to get there ? 
 Don't forget it's Friday nighty . If Frankfurt's anything like London , everybody will be leaving for the weekend . It will be a rush hour and traffic might be moving very slowly . 
 I am a realist . 
 Oh , dear . 
 Oh , well , I looked around . There wasn't any other space . I waited a while and nobody came . I'm sorry if I've taken your place . 
 Haven't you met yet ? 
 I'll be glad to do it . 
 Hello ! Could I speak to Sheerly Lim please ? 
 This is Sue from work . 
 OK . I just saw a Versace for thirty dollars . This stuff can't be real ! 
 I'm not sure I'd want to give these people my credit card number . 
 Sure , but it's so complicated . They asked for my credit card authorization number . 
 I have trouble understanding all these forms ... but I'm sure I'll get it . 
 Yes ! Let ’ s go sailing and water skiing . That ’ s so exciting . 
 Yes . Let ’ s sleep on the sand . That ’ s most exciting ! 
 Give me 10 yuan , your ID card and a photo of you please . 
 Yes , it is . But you must pay a deposit for the card . 
 Yes , if the card is well kept and has no dirt and scratches . 
 Where ’ s the wagon ? 
 The water wagon . 
 The wagon with the water , of course . 
 No , you can ’ t do that . There isn ’ t much water in the wagon . And we need the water for drinking . 
 Ah , that's a good idea . But I heard the film club of our school would show a film for free . Maybe we don't need to go to the cinema . 
 I'd like to , but I'm afraid I can't . 
 That's not the reason . I have to go to the English Corner tomorrow evening . You know , I've been going there every week . 
 You said you wanted to improve your English , so how about coming with me tomorrow ? I can also introduce some friends to you . 
 They are not geeks . They are also interested in singing , dancing , and so on . They are excellent , and they can always help me a lot . 
 It depends . If they are not busy , they will come to join us , and talk with us . 
 Of course not . The foreign teachers also teach us English songs , and play games with us . 
 You won't be disappointed . 
 Brian ! How have you been ? 
 Oh , well , I've lost some weight . And my hair is longer than before . 
 I'm doing really well . I got married about three years ago . I have two kids now . 
 Hi dude , you look upset , what's up ? 
 what's the problem ? 
 well , you can simply tell them you want to sleep , or make an arrangement for a time when the room should quiet down . 
 I understand . I used to live in a dorm with four people . I was great in some aspects . We always went out and and had fun together . But on the other hand , when I wanted some quiet time , and people kept 
 I stayed at Bob's last night . 
 I guess I should have told you . 
 Do you have any seat preferences , sir ? 
 Yes . Would you like a window seat ? 
 I finally found an apartment that I want to rent . 
 I saw it in this ad for apartments in today ’ s newspaper . 
 I really did , but what ’ s so great about it is that it ’ s really affordable . 
 Well , most importantly the apartment is beautiful . 
 The rent is $ 725 each month . 
 That ’ s what I said when I found out how much the rent was . 
 Hello , this is Francis . 
 Today , I am busy all day long . 
 That ’ s not good for me at all.It ’ ll have to be another time . 
 I know . I am available from 1 PM to 4 PM on Friday afternoon . 
 See you . 
 I'm afraid not , we're very short-staffed at the moment . Can you ask the shift supervisor to ask one of his team to do some overtime ? Perhaps Tommy can stand in for an hour or two until we find a replacement . 
 Yes , of course . 
 I'd be very pleased . 
 Good idea . How much do I need to deposit ? 
 And how do I withdraw if I need to ? 
 I'm sorry , refresh my mind . What's different about a Type B Account ? 
 David , why don't you clean your room ? 
 Why are you feeling depress ? 
 I don't think she would do such a thing . 
 Oh , cheer up ! A girlfriend is not everything . 
 Then forgive her mistake . 
 I heard you've found a new job . 
 So you're quite happy with your new job ? 
 I would love to be famous and have thousands of adoring fans . 
 I love being photographed ! If I were famous , I ’ d do interviews for all the top magazines , like cosmo and elle . 
 No-one really believes gossip columnists . 
 I think you ’ re right about that . I ’ d need a good manager to be my spokesperson . I could do a lot of charity work , which would help a lot of people . 
 I love children , as you know , so probably a children ’ s charity . 
 Thanks , but actually I was hoping I could ask you to write my biography . 
 It ’ s my pleasure . 
 Would you please tell me about your pay skill first ? 
 They sum my skills and experience . I ’ d like to start it with 4000 yuan a month . 
 Do I have paid vacation ? 
 I'm so sorry about your brother , Mr . Wang . 
 If you need any help , just let me know . 
 I have no idea . What about you ? 
 I ate pizza the other day . 
 How about some burgers ? 
 What are we going to do ? 
 That sounds like a plan . 
 I think they sell both at the cafeteria . 
 We are sorry , but single rooms have been occupied . 
 Then how about this room , with just shower ? 
 No , sir . The tax is included . 
 Where do you need to be that is more important than school ? 
 Do you have a plan to make up your missed work ? 
 Are you going to go right away ? 
 All right , but please remember that it is your responsibility to catch up . 
 Goodbye , and try not to miss any more school . 
 What kind of food will they be serving ? 
 It sounds like this is going to be authentic Mexican food . 
 Do you know the day they plan to open ? 
 Maybe we can make reservations ahead of time ? 
 May I see your identification , please , sir ? 
 Thanks . Do you have a credit card , sir ? 
 I'm very sorry , sir . We accept only VISA or MasterCard . 
 Thanks . Room 507 is a spacious , nonsmoking room , with a queen bed . Does that meet your expectations ? 
 That's wonderful , sir . Now , here's your key . Should you need anything , just dial 0 . 
 Which room are you staying in now , sir ? 
 Usually if you are leaving today , you'd better check out before 12 noon , and leave the room . If you check out after 12 noon , we will count one day more . 
 Since your plane leaves at 3 p . m . it will be too early for you to leave the hotel at 12 0 ' clock . We can arrange you to stay in the room until 1 p . m . ; but first you should still check out before 12 noon . 
 Yes , sir . Here it is . 
 Your bill comes to 60 dollars . How would you like it to be paid ? With cash or credit card ? 
 Would you please give to me , and will imprint it ? 
 not really . I wasn thinking of maybe going to a movie . Do you want to go with me ? 
 have you heard of Hot Fuzz ? 
 that's the one . It's an actioncomedy . What do you think ? 
 what do you have in mind ? 
 isn't that the chick flick with Kate Hudson and Owen Wilson ? 
 not really . Do you like biographical / drama films ? 
 Anne Hathaway is in a new movie called Becoming Jane which is based on a true story about Jane Austen . 
 it's on at 8: 00 pm at the Phoenix Theatres . I have a membership there , so I can book the tickets ahead of time . 
 sounds good . I'll see you then ! 
 What is a tornado warning ? 
 Really ? In New Berlin ? 
 I understand . They think a tornado might come . 
 And the second stage is called a " tornado warning " . 
 It's scary . 
 What do you mean " a loud train " ? 
 But if you hear them coming , isn't it already too late ? 
 Have you seen a lot of them ? 
 Did it hit their house ? 
 What were they doing when you called ? 
 That's terrible . Do many people die in tornadoes ? 
 I'd like to make sure my plane reservation is in order . 
 World Airlines , Flight 201 . 
 John Anderson . 
 Thank you . 
 How much is this pen ? 
 And how much is this pencil ? 
 Here's fifteen Yuan . 
 OK , that's right . 
 OK . 
 Buy more and get more special discount coupons . 
 Of course You get a coupon for every 3 bags of sugar . 
 10 pence off if you use this coupon . 
 Yeah , you need to take advantage of it within its expiry date . 
 The coupon can be used at least one year . 
 All right . I will get them for you . 
 Almost ready . Could you set the table ? 
 We'll have fruit salad to start and then the roast beef . 
 I didn't prepare it , but if you want , I can cook some . What soup would you like to have ? 
 Hello , Tom , are you free next Sunday ? 
 I'm going to have my first baby , so I plan to hold a baby shower next Sunday . 
 It's the tradition . But baby showers as we know them today were not common until after World Warri . 
 So you will come , won't you ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 I appreciate what you have done for me.Everything I have seen here has left a deep impression on me . I really don't know how to express my thanks to you . 
 Will you be kind to say " Thank you " to Mr.Zhang and other friends for me ? 
 Of course , I will.Well , it's time for me to say goodbye.The plane will take off soon.Hope some day you will come to America for a visit . 
 Goodbye ! 
 The material is so abstract that I have trouble understanding it . 
 Yes , everything is fine . 
 Didn't they announce that our flight was delayed ? 
 We boarded the plane on time , but then we were held up for almost an hour due to a maintenance problem . 
 We finally took off , but about 30 minutes later , the captain came on to the loudspeaker to warn us that there would be some bad turbulence for most of the flight . 
 Yes , but this was the worst turbulence I'd ever experienced in my life ! Everyone started getting sick . The flight attendants had to stay in their seats . The captain decided to land early . 
 We landed in Southampton and waited an hour for the storms to pass and then took off again . 
 It wasn't too bad . At lease I'm alive . 
 I managed to get a sandwich from a flight attendant . How about you ? 
 Excuse me . You can't leave your car here . 
 I'm afraid you'll have to find a parking meter . 
 No , sir . I'm sorry you can't . 
 Yes , I am looking for a coat . 
 I have no idea . 
 Well , it's good in style , but I am afraid it doesn't wash well . 
 I'm not surprised . 
 My brother in-law just dropped in from the states . 
 I decided to put him up while he's here , big mistake ! 
 He's lazy . I tried being a good host , but if you give him an inch , he'll take a mile . 
 You can say that again . 
 Two weeks . If he thinks I'll put up with his attitude that long he's got another thing coming . 
 Hello Mr Fang ! It's good to see you again . What can we do for you today ? 
 That shouldn't be a problem , Mr Fang . Have you got your Certificate of Use of Foreign Exchange Account and the Foreign Exchange Account Opening Notice with you ? Our most widely used currencies are US dollar , Japanese yen and Hong Kong dollar . 
 We will transact this for you as soon as we can after the materials you have given me have been checked and verified . 
 Your husband is very helpful , isn't he ? 
 Really ? 
 Mr . Emory , I ’ d like to take this afternoon off if it's all right with you . 
 I know , Mr . Emory . I'm sorry . But I really need to see the doctor this afternoon . I feel dizzy and I can't concentrate on my work . 
 OK , thank you ! 
 Who ’ s that boy ? 
 The one next to the telephone . 
 I think he ’ s the boy who just moved into my apartment building . 
 to be honest , I don't really care for either one . 
 I used to play basketball when I was little , and I never scored a goal . Every time I watch a basketball game , I think about how horrible I was at it . 
 how about you ? What's your favorite sport of all time ? 
 have you ever seen a live game ? 
 I've never really understood the game . 
 thanks , that'd be nice . When's the next ice hockey game on ? 
 that's a good idea . 
 Are you ready to move ? 
 Yes , but there is a chance that might be suitable for you . 
 I can't say , but let me make a call and see if I can help . 
 I enjoy watching Channel 5.They always have films from all over the world . 
 I can read the subtitles.My set is a huge-screen one . 
 Welcome to our shop . It seems you are interested in this dress . 
 That's no problem . It is made of linen , so you won't feel hot in it . I can assure you it is of superior quality . What is more , it is very popular with young women . 
 88 Yuan . 
 Have you gone bowling before ? 
 There are 10 frames in a bowling game . Each player is allowed to bowl two balls in each frame . 
 ' Round ' and ' frame ' are two different terms . 
 Hey , slow down . I'll tell you more while playing . 
 I'm going to the Golden hotel . 
 Thank you . I have an appointment with an important client at 10 
 Thank you.here ' s 10 $ , just give me 1 $ back , please . 
 Well , these things happens , I know that . You just have to stay straight with me . 
 Well , I suggest you just keep me posted.That should do it.That way the burden is on me to decide when to buy , not you . 
 Yeah , it really is that simple.Every time there's a change in the items we do business on , you let me know . That's all you need to do . 
 No , any change . I want you to keep me as informed as you are . I need to know as much as you do . If you hear about something that might happen , then tell me about it.Tell me it's rumor , what it's based on and your opinion on how likely it is . 
 No , everthing.Those things for sure , but also labor problems , raw materials , new subcontractors , mergers , in short , anything and everything.So I can make a fully informed decision . 
 I think we'll get along fine . 
 I had meetings back to back all morning . And phone rang off the hook from the minute I walked into the office . 
 I can ’ t believe it . I guess I ’ ll be here until 10 again tonight . 
 I don ’ t see any problem , only the car is a bit old . 
 Get in . 
 Well , actually , I'm not free today . Do you have anything urgent ? 
 How about tomorrow instead . 
 All right . See you then . 
 Don't mention it . I lost a bunch of money on it this year . I think it is on the brink of bankruptcy . 
 I changed my strategy around too . I am investing in good companies now . 
 It's a good idea . But please be careful when you invest this time . 
 If you have any question , you can ask me . 
 All right . Let's chat next time . Bye-bye . 
 Remember that old man who used to beg for money on the street across from our house ? 
 He got a job and now he owns a small grocery in town . 
 Tom , you promised to cut the lung . You won't forget , will you ? 
 And you'll repair the television , won't you ? 
 Do you promise ? 
 And Tom , you will help Johnny with his homework , won't you ? 
 But you'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight , won't you ? 
 Tom , darling . You'll try not to be late for dinner tonight , won't you ? Please ! 
 Have you a garment ? 
 Show me the black one , my size . 
 Well , I don't think it matches my jeans.Can you give me some advice ? 
 Good morning . 
 Very well . What about you ? 
 That is so nice of you . 
 Why did you ask that ? Do you want to buy the used goods ? 
 You know the car I'm driving , which is still in good condition though it is second-hand . And it only cost me 300 dollars . It was so cheap . 
 It depends . So you must be careful buying second-hand goods . 
 Do you mean lying to people for their good ? 
 It's hard to say . I mean , how can you judge what's good for them ? Maybe it is best to tell them the truth no matter what it is . 
 I know . If you're sure the truth will do harm , maybe you can choose not to tell it . 
 May I have some water , please ? 
 With my dinner , please . And can you take my order for dessert later ? 
 I'm back . 
 Going shopping . It tires me too much . 
 Can I ? 
 OK . What does it sell ? 
 That's great . 
 Almost . I ’ Ve put up the decorations , and we ’ Ve decorated the Christmas tree with plenty of tinsel and baubles . 
 I ’ Ve prepared most of it already and we ’ Ve got plenty of snack foods-you know , crisps , biscuits , and things . Are you going to make the punch ? 
 I think everyone will be coming . Dave don ’ t come because he has to go to his parent ’ s home and they live in Scotland . 
 Yes , we do . I hope we have enough for everyone . Did you send out all your Christmas cards in time ? 
 I did the same . I spent hours yesterday evening wrapping presents . I hope I didn ’ t forget to buy anyone something ! 
 I ’ Ve got this really neat idea , you can hire a car and drive straight there . 
 But that ’ s the quickest way to make your plans work . 
 Hello , Sir , may I help you ? 
 Very well , here are the general terms of our loan policies . We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans . 
 It depends on how long you take to pay it back . If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . This of course is considering that you don ’ t default on a payment ! 
 That is a very serious problem you see , the bank must assess your personal information , past loans , assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan . 
 Excuse me , Mr . Li . I have something to discuss with you . 
 I would really appreciate it if we could talk for a few minutes now . It's about the overtime you've asked me to put in . 
 I really can't work overtime . Because my husband has been ill recently , I must take care of him . 
 God , I didn ’ t realize . I didn ’ t , I didn ’ t know ... 
 Excuse me ? 
 You were spying on me , weren ’ t you ? You probably rented those children . 
 Because I am your competition which you know perfectly well , or you would not put up that sign just around the corner . 
 What is that ? What are you doing ? You ’ re taking all the caviar ! That caviar is a garnish ? 
 Excuse me , can you tell me where I can go fishing ? 
 I want to go fishing today , but I have left my rod and fishing line at home . 
 Are we going to have dinner tonight ? 
 I'm not cooking dinner . 
 I'm not sure what to cook for dinner . 
 I have a taste for some chicken and potatoes . 
 So are you planning on cooking it ? 
 I'll cook dinner . 
 Dad , I want to learn how to drive this summer vacation . 
 I will get registered now at once . Do you know any training schools ? 
 OK . look , I've typed driver schools , and there are so many results coming out . 
 3,000 Yuan is a little bit steep . 
 I've heard that the Ideal Life School is famous . They offer many programs and there are many classes available . The charge is also fair . 
 Ah , got it . Ideal Life School , programs 
 To get around your difficulty , Mr . Brown , I'd suggest that you reduce your order by half . You can send in an Addi trional order later . 
 A month before the time you want the goods to be delivered . 
 Getting the goods ready , making out the documents and booking the shipping space - - all this takes time , you know . You cannot expect us to make delivery in less than a month . 
 When will that be ? 
 You can rest assured of that . We'll book you order and inquire for the shipping space now , so that shipment can be effected within two or three weeks of receipt of your L / C . 
 Very good . Well , thanks to your cooperation , our discussion has been very pleasant and fruitful . I sincerely hope that the volume of trade between us will be even greater in the future . 
 Well , this is something new . A few of our friends from Europe have also suggested that we participate in joint enterprise with them dealing in some of our goods . We think there are a lot of details to go into . 
 Naturally , I appreciate your efforts in pushing the sale of Japanese arts and crafts . But I'm not in a position to discuss your proposal today . I must first talk to our director , and discuss it with you some other time . 
 We'll talk about it next time . Now that everything is settled , let's have a cup of tea , and take our minds off business for a change . 
 Alright , no problem . 
 Wait a minute . Cal's bar ? 
 That's a gay bar . 
 I thought he was maybe gay , but I wasn't sure.Anyhow , you don't expect me to go into a gay bar , do you ? 
 Why doesn't he meet us outside ? 
 Yeah , but who wants to go in ? I'm not gay , you know . Why should I go in a gay bar ? 
 I just wouldn't be comfortable . 
 No , never . 
 Well ... 
 No , I don't . But I never went into a gay bar before . 
 Okay . I will try it . I suppose it isn't reasonable for me to refuse to go in.After all , gay people aren't afraid to go into normal bars . 
 Fine . 
 Is it stimulating ? 
 I hope I still have chances . 
 Oh , sorry , I can't . I'm going to work late tonight . I have to finish this report . 
 No , I'm not . What are you planning to do ? 
 Sure , I'd love to ! But let me pay for the tickets this time . It's my turn . 
 Are you going to vote tomorrow ? 
 I am . 
 My polling place is up the street at the park . 
 Where ’ s yours at ? 
 You should know that already . 
 You do know that you can look online , right ? 
 Honey , I ’ ll be right back ! 
 I told you already ! I ’ m going to get my nails done . 
 Well , first of all , I like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . You should come with me ! 
 They don ’ t only paint my nails ! The manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish ! 
 Excuse me , miss.Should I check in here for taking MS121 to Florence ? 
 Here you are . Can I have a seat in the back of the plane ? 
 I see Mike farmer has make it into the Olympic team . He beat the national record by 0.1 of a second . 
 I think you ’ re right . I think we have a very good athletics team . They should do well in the Olympics . How many medals do you think we ’ ll win ? 
 What do you think our chance are in other events . 
 We might get a gold medal in the sailing too . Our team put in a lot of practice . 
 You are very optimistic ! 
 No , there ’ s no need . We can change it within two days if it ’ s not damaged . 
 I know . I will pay attention to such a thing next time . 
 Checking out , please . 
 Excuse me . What are these charges ? 
 Wait a minute . I made a phone call , but I never made a connection . 
 Isn't that a bit excessive ? 
 OK . Here is the money . 
 Hello ? Is that Mark ? 
 I've been overseas , So have you been busy lately ? 
 Yes , I was just wondering when you'd have time to go fishing . 
 That sounds good . I've missed you my friend . 
 Do you know his sister ? 
 That's right . 
 Um ... let me see now , is it 18 or 19 , I can never remember ... 18 ... 19 next birthday . Tthat's it . 
 Well ... 
 Yes ... quite pretty . 
 We have a kind of floating bonus on a yearly basis . 
 Yes . Floating bonus is the kind of bonus that is indeterminate in amount , such as quarterly bonus , bonus at the end of the year . 
 I'm most upset to hear that.Are you better now ? 
 Good morning , miss . 
 How would you like it ? 
 Did you meet the new girl in our sales department . She is taking the place of Maggie during her alternative leave . 
 I guess not , They haven't officially introduced her to the whole staff yet , she barely started yesterday . 
 If the new girl is competent , maybe they will promote her when that time comes . 
 You may pick it up in twenty minutes . 
 Yes , and you can renew this prescription by phone . 
 Take it three times a day . 
 You should take this medicine with food and no alcohol . 
 You might get a little dizzy , but that is it . 
 It's bulldog 123 . 
 Yes . 
 What do you mean ? 
 456 Cherry Drive , Pasadena , CA 91170 . 
 So what's the problem ? 
 Oh , I get it . My email address is bluedog123@yahoo.com . 
 Yes , they all stop at this corner . 
 You can take any bus except the Number 9 . 
 They run about every five minutes . 
 About fifteen minutes.It ' s not far.Are you a stranger in New York ? 
 How do you like New York city ? 
 You'll soon get accustomed to it.It ' s not difficult.Well , here's the bus.Fortunately , it's not full . 
 Don't mention it . 
 Thank you . I am glad that everything turned out so well . 
 I took a cooking class at the Culinary Institute . 
 Isn't that great ? That is coconut ginger chicken with rice . 
 Yes , there is shrimp in there along with sea vegetables and lemon grass . 
 I appreciate you bringing the wine . It goes well with the chicken . 
 Ha , she is unstoppable . I'm learning so much from her . 
 She's demanding . But I like that . I mean , I know our timeline is tight . 
 You guys are working around the clock , I know . That guy Dave next to Zina never leaves . 
 I hear that you are in love with Mike . 
 Don't you hit it off ? 
 I will travel to Southeast Asia this summer , so I need to exchange some US dollars . Can I get the foreign currency at any bank ? 
 Do you mean there is no way to get any foreign money ? 
 Only $ 2,000 ? Are there any other ways to get the money exchanged ? 
 I'd better take more dollars with me . It seems that I need to borrow some from my friends . 
 Well , I'd like some legal advice . Jane and I are thinking of incorporating . So Want to find out what sort of legal procedure one follows in forming a corporation . 
 I know . I have an idea that we get together to discuss this next week . 
 I will give a call . 
 Thank you , but I'm just looking around . How much does this skirt cost ? 
 May I try it on ? 
 Can you give me a better deal ? 
 Well , I'll give one hundred and eighty yuan for it . 
 No , this is my final offer . 
 Tony looks very handsome in the suit . 
 Judge from his look , he's a very serious person . 
 I like watching comedies , like ' Boat ' . Do you like watching comedies too ? 
 You like horror movies ? I don't like them because they're too scary ! I like comedies because I love to laugh . 
 There's so much to do and so little time . 
 Yes . We're going to be married in my hometown church , the first minute of the new millennium ! 
 All set . And we're having a red bean cake and dim sum for the Taiwanese guests , just like your mom wanted . 
 have you finished going through the contract ? 
 Ok . Ask away . 
 yes , employees can take up to 10 days of sick leave per year . However , in order to get paid , you ’ ll have to bring in a note from the doctor ’ s . 
 that ’ s correct . 
 well , we ’ Ve had to add that to the contract because we found that many of our employees were taking almost one sick day a month , even though they weren ’ t sick . 
 do you have any other questions ? 
 we do actually . We can add that as an amendment to your contract . 
 men are allowed to take 10 days of paternity leave for their first child . 
 well , women are the ones giving birth . I think it ’ s fair to give them more time , don ’ t you ? 
 yes , please . 
 I don't mind at all . 
 To tell you the truth , I'm not married . I'm still single . 
 I don't know . It's still up in the air . 
 Well , how many tax-free things can I bring with me ? 
 I think I have nothing to declare . I have just brought a bottle of wine . 
 Yes , please . I'd like to make a reservation from Hong Kong to Tampa with a stopover in Houston . 
 I would like to leave Hong Kong September the first and leave Houston for Tampa on September the 12th . 
 Lily Smith . 
 Hong Kong side 3854295 . 
 Thank you . 
 Give it to me . 
 It ’ s from NYU . 
 I didn ’ t get accepted . 
 I ’ m serious . 
 NYU was my first choice . 
 I ’ ll just have to wait for UCLA . 
 That's okay . I can explain a little . 
 Don't worry . You can't lose all your money.because you won't gamble all your money . 
 Of course I'm right . I already told you the rule for Las Vegas . Remember ? 
 That's right . That's the best way to have control over yourself.You say to yourself . Tonight I will gamble fifty dollars . Only fifty dollars . No more.If you follow the rule , you can't lose more than fifty dollars . 
 But I won't let you do that . I will watch you . 
 So how much do you want to gamble ? 
 500 dollars ! That's too much ! You just said you are afraid to lose your money.If you're afraid , why do you want to gamble 500 dollars ? 
 That is a bad attitude to have , Karen ! If you think that way , Las Vegas will be really dangerous for you . 
 I like all sorts of movies , primarily drama and science fiction . 
 Western and horror are the two types of movies I don't care for . 
 Some are entertaining , but I find most of them stupid and childish . For example , I don't understand why a person always goes into the house alone when something is suspicious . 
 How long will you stay in New York ? 
 I am sorry . If you have here more than 24 hours between connecting flights , we can't check your luggage through London . 
 That's right . It's over there . 
 Hold on 
 From mid-November , snow started to pile up in Ottawa . 
 Although the weather here is very cold , the people are warm . 
 The kitchen stinks . 
 Can we sit on the grass , darling ? 
 Look , darling ! I can see a bench near that tree . 
 It's not raining , darling . The bench isn't wet . 
 Yes , I can . 
 It says ' Wet paint ! ' 
 What is its national anthem ? 
 Can you sing the song ? 
 So will you come to work with us ? 
 We'll have to negotiate that . It's a possibility . 
 Don't push your luck , Dave . 
 As soon as you can get here . We'll be waiting for you . 
 Of course . I can eat a horse now . 
 Where shall we go now ? A Chinese restaurant or a local one ? 
 Thank you all for coming to our monthly staff correlation meeting . Today we have a lot of new things to introduce to you all , there will be a lot of changes in company policy to accommodate better employee welfare . 
 In the past , our welfare program has consisted of benefits packages only , meaning partial health insurance coverage and retirement plan . But we hope to boost morale by increasing incentives and adding additional welfare considerations . 
 It is proposed that from now on , employees will be given 10 paid sick days , in addition to their 2 week vacation periods . They will also be encouraged to maintain proper physical health with a company sponsored aerobics class on Friday nights . We have also consulted with the human resource department and have hired a new liaison between management and employees . Let ’ s all welcome Ms . Michelle Cain to our team as our company ’ s ombudsman . 
 Yes , that ’ s right . From now on , whenever you have a question or concern regarding anything that happens during the work day , Ms . Cain will be your advocate . If you believe there is anything inappropriate or unfair in the management practices , the ombudsman will be the first person you seek . Her job is to have your best interest at heart . 
 The best opportunity is called callous , which is an Internet-based job placement service that you can make use of . 
 There are computers at our EDD offices for you to use in your job search . 
 We have information available about the job market as well as workshops . 
 We have workshops in Resume Writing and Interviewing , to name a few . 
 College job placement services can help . 
 I'll see if she is in . 
 I'm afraid she's out . 
 Yes , of course . 
 Sure . 
 It's my pleasure . 
 I know , I know . But you always bat around without doing things useful . 
 All right . Do what you can do now instead of twiddling your thumbs . 
 Yes , we do . That one comes in green blue and red . 
 Oh , that's 39 dollars and 95 cents . It's on the sale at the moment . 
 I'll just go and check for you . 
 I'm from Guangzhou . 
 It's in the South of China . 
 How regular ? 
 You are kidding me ? It is against the labor law . They should be aware of their rights . 
 That ’ s not right , somebody should do something . 
 Sorry , sir . Dinners are available 20 minutes , drinks are served throughout the flight . 
 Did you have a part-time job when you were still in school ? 
 Yeah , I worked about twenty hours a week in a pizza restaurant . 
 It was always very busy there . 
 I stood behind the register and took pizza orders . 
 Yeah , I got to eat as much pizza as I could for free . 
 It's nice . But what kind of dress are you looking for ? 
 Of course . It's common too that we wear something special for our Chinese New Year . 
 Any other common customs of your New Year ? 
 What's that ? 
 By the way , where are you going on New Year's Eve ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 I took more than 10 subjects including Theoretical Economics , Political Economics , Western Economics , Statistics and so on . In addition to the courses of my major , I took minor courses too . 
 I took computer science and English courses as my minor subjects . 
 I would like to return this book . 
 I also want to check out this video . 
 That ’ s all I need . 
 Here it is . 
 That won ’ t be a problem . 
 I won ’ t damage it . 
 Roast pork chops with a bottle of red wine , please . Is soup served here ? 
 Clear soup . I think tomato soup is fine . 
 No . I caught a cold two days ago . I only finish reading half of it . 
 I'm feeling better today . 
 About more three days , I think . 
 No problem . 
 Not a great deal . 
 For accounting system and things like that , you mean ? 
 Yes ? 
 Of course , his machine must have been connected to a computer . 
 I need to eat something . 
 I know , but I'm hungry again . 
 I think I'm going to go make myself a snack . 
 I'm not exactly sure . 
 I have no idea what kind of sandwich I want to make . 
 I'm going to do that . 
 This place serves good breakfasts , don't you think ? 
 What are you planning to do today ? 
 Have you done windsurfing before ? 
 Can you take a little advice from a friend ? 
 Don't waste your money . Windsurfing is very hard . And it will be windy today.They will charge you fifty dollars for a half-hour , and you won't be able to windsurf.You will fall and fall and fall . 
 Yes , but it takes a long time to learn.You would spend a thousand dollars to learn it on a rental windsurfer . 
 I have learnt how to ride a bicycle . I plan to go to the Water Park by bike this weekend . 
 Oh , my dear sister , I am no longer a baby ! 
 How about this set ? 
 How is everything going with your girlfriend ? 
 Oh , I am sorry to hear that . I did ’ t know that you had split up . What happened ? 
 Really ! Did she tell you why she didn ’ t show up ? 
 What was she thinking ? Did you confront her about it when you saw her ? 
 I can ’ t believe she would do that to you . It ’ s so dishonest---and rude ! 
 I bet you she regrets what she ’ s done . You were such a good catch ! She really lost out , didn ’ t she ? 
 I know . It ’ s always nice to have some closure , but I don ’ t think you ’ ll have a problem finding another girlfriend . 
 Hum , me too . This winter holiday was especially long . What have you done ? 
 You know , I like traveling . I made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself . 
 I want to get my car washed . 
 I don't know what you mean . 
 Do you wash windows ? 
 What about the interior ? 
 Sounds good , regular car wash package will be OK . 
 Do you have deviled crabs ? 
 I want an order of that . By the way , I want it hot . I like chili . 
 Bring me a bottle of beer . 
 You should go to the dentist . 
 Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist . 
 Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out . 
 Good . You'll feel better after you do . 
 I think we have a while longer . 
 That's true . 
 I don't know . 
 I wasn't really paying attention . I think we missed our stop . 
 Yeah , we definitely missed our stop . 
 My bad.sorry ! 
 Not much , just heading over to the shooting range . You wanna come ? 
 Yeah , it will be fun ! I have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . I also have a revolver that ’ s really fun too ! They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you 
 Whoa , take it easy there Rambo . Don ’ t get carried away . These weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be 
 The reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! So are you ready ? 
 What ’ s your city like ? 
 Is the traffic bad in the city centre ? 
 What about restaurants and entertainment ? 
 Is there a lot of nightlife in your city ? 
 It sounds like a really exciting city to live in . 
 Where's the toilet ? 
 How are the children doing at sport ? 
 He ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ? 
 Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ? 
 How are they at swimming ? 
 Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters . 
 I think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher . 
 Where do you live , Kim ? 
 Oh , that's convenient , but ... how much crime is there ? 
 . I have a house in the suburbs . 
 No , not much . In fact , nothing ever really happens . That's the trouble . 
 OK . Great idea ! 
 Yes . In 1996 I received my Bachelor of Science degree from Hebes University , and in 2001 I received my MBA degree from Peking University . 
 In fact my records were excellent . My overall GPA was 9 on a 10 scale , which was the highest in my class . 
 English . It was both interesting and useful , so I showed a great interest in it . 
 Because I am very interested in administration and I did take some courses in it . I also performed well in the subjects . Hence I believe that I can do a good job in this position . 
 Yes . I was awarded a scholarship from the university every year . In 1995 I participated in the National Contest of Maths Models and I won the prize . 
 Yes . After so many years of hard work , I ’ d rather I had an office of my own . 
 I ’ ll be very glad if you would help . 
 Thank you . I wish I would . 
 Are you done ? 
 Let me see . Everything looks fine . We ’ ll be taking applications for this position through Friday . We ’ ll start calling for interviews sometime next week . 
 That ’ s right . 
 Bye now . 
 I think something must be done . 
 I agree with you . Only in this way can we ease the traffic problems . 
 Really ? I ’ Ve never heard of it ! 
 I think Mary must be sad , because she loves her husband very much . 
 you know I hate shopping more than anything else in this world . 
 what kind of errands do we need to run ? 
 I ’ ll only go if we can stop at the office-license to pick up something to drink for tonight . 
 sounds good . You have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though . I know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms , especially if the stores have special offers . 
 ok , let ’ s go then ! 
 for what ? 
 you said you were only going to window shop ! 
 I should have known ... 
 Yes , sir . Shall I explain the details of the plan now ? 
 According to your schedule , you will visit the Times Company , including its office building , workshops and stores , in the morning from 8: 30 to 11 
 Is it all right for me to come in now . Mr . Sutcliffe ? 
 Do you mind if I sit down ? 
 I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put in for a transfer ? 
 Do you mind if I speak frankly ? 
 Well , you see . I don't like the office . I don't like the staff and I'm afraid you and I don't get on . So may I put in for a transfer ? 
 I miss grandma . I dreamed about her yesterday . 
 We're thinking of ordering fifty refrigerators . But , there's one problem . 
 The only problem is the price . It's not possible for us to make any sales at this price . 
 I'm afraid I can't agree with you there . Your price is much higher than other companies . 
 I don't deny that the refrigerator is of top quality . If you could go a little lower , we'll place the order right away . 
 All right , we'll wait for your answer . 
 I'm considering buying a new car , the old one hasn't been running too well recently , and was wondering what kind of credit you can offer me . 
 That's great . I'm looking to borrow quite a large sum , though . 
 That's good news . The car I'm interested in is priced at 120,000 RIB , but I think I can get a bit of discount on that . I can afford to put up around 40,000 RIB myself . 
 The funds are all ready to go in my personal account , so let's transfer it . 
 Well , you can just see the sea . Between the factory chimneys . 
 Well , it can't be helped . We'll just have to put up with it . 
 No , thank you . I had too much to drink yesterday evening . I had a bad hangover this morning . My head felt terrible . 
 Yes . It was a friend ’ s birthday party . We drank all kinds of things-beer , wine and spirits . After midnight , we were even drinking cocktails ! 
 I know , but it was a celebration , you Kwon ? I don ’ t think I ’ Ve see you drunk . 
 You are a sensible drinker . Anyway , I ’ m not going to drink any alcohol this evening . I don ’ t ’ want another bad hangover . 
 Yeah . That ’ s a good idea . I heard that coke was first used as a medicine . 
 Are you going to the wine tasting tomorrow ? 
 ... and taste a few ! There will be wines from several countries and an expert to give advice on which wines are good and which ones are not . 
 How are Zina's new programmers working out ? 
 So you'll make the Stars.com deadline , and have us up and running next week ? 
 Good . After Stars.com starts paying us , we won't need Vikam's cash anymore . 
 How do I get to the post office from school ? 
 OK , I see . Thank you very much . 
 Devi , do you have any preference for where you would like to go for dinner for your birthday ? 
 There is a great restaurant directory here in the weekend section of the newspaper . 
 Do you have a particular type of food that you would like ? 
 That Japanese restaurant , Shogun , got good reviews . 
 Would that be a place that you might like to go to for your birthday ? 
 Are you ready to order now , sir ? 
 How would you like the steak , rare , medium , or well-done ? 
 Would you like something to drink ? 
 My dear , what's for supper ? 
 What about soup ? 
 Which condiment do you use for ? 
 Very good , need I help you ? 
 Thanks . I can watch TV now . 
 Okay , I'll do it next time . 
 Then you must hurry up.There ' s only ten minutes left . 
 Let's go to the cinema tonight , shall we ? 
 What about ' Farewell My Concubine ' ? I've been wanting to see it for a long time . 
 My brother has offered me two tickets for this evening . 
 At eight thirty . 
 OK , I'll be waiting . 
 OK . Shall we go to a bar ? 
 Why ? 
 Don't you think it ’ s too noisy here ? The rock music ! I can hardly bear it . 
 Well , I'll try . Then what would you like to drink ? It's on me . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 We have many kinds of different purpose . I wonder whom you are buying for ? 
 I see , sir . This one is very good . 
 You may rest assured . It sells well . 
 Certainly . Here it is . 
 80 yuan . 
 It's a bit . But I can give you a discount . 
 No . I'm afraid the price is too low . 
 I'm sorry , but I think you should give me no less than 65 yuan . 
 It was really hard for our parents to save money when they were young . 
 Yeah . They simply had no extra money to save up or for other things . 
 Good morning , I would like to reserve a berth . 
 T112 to Washington please . 
 That's Lincoln . 
 Air freight is the quickest and safest way , I think . 
 can I get you something to drink ? 
 so how about an aperitif ? 
 stirred or shaken ? 
 here you are . 
 sure . All of our mixed drinks are excellent . You can also try a delicious non-alcoholic cocktail . 
 try a Singer . It has lime juice and grenadine over ice . 
 here we go . 
 enjoy yourself . 
 Hi ! Dear ! I'm waiting for you . 
 You know , although we've chatted twice , I've been thinking of you already . 
 & you ? 
 Oh , thanks . I wanna see the real you . 
 OK ! Before that I'll take this one as you . 
 Cute , like you . 
 Me too . Send you a kiss ... 
 Are you ready to order now , Sir ? 
 Yes , here you go . 
 Sure , the Huanghe carp with sugar and vinegar is famous in our restaurant . 
 Anything else ? 
 How about drink ? 
 Good morning , Miss.Are there boat tickets to Miami on the first of September 
 I'd like the first-class cabin for two . What's the fare ? 
 How long is the boat time-table effective ? 
 I want to know what port does our ship stop at ? 
 How long will the trip take from here to New York ? 
 Thank you . 
 Absolutely we need a house here . But what makes me upset is the prices in this city . 
 It is depressing to hear the price goes higher and higher . 
 And the rich still wants to buy more , even though they have at least one house to live . 
 Yes , it displays some social problems and interprets the values of our white-collars . 
 Good morning , sir . Here is the hotel's sauna room . What can I do for you ? 
 Sure Those who have heart disease or high blood pressure are not allowed to take sauna , for their sake . 
 First , change your shoes to slippers . Then walk up to the changing room to get prepared for a shower . 
 After the shower , step into the washroom with birch switches , dip them in the warm water and briskly whisk them over your skin . 
 Yes , then enter the bathroom , There is a stove tired with wood in the room , and on the top of the stove , there is a pile of stones , which keep the heat . Throw some water on the stones , and dry steam is given off . 
 What's the second solar system ? 
 Is this good news or bad news ? 
 You mean with people on it ? 
 You've heard of Bruce Jenner , haven't you ? 
 I read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles . 
 Sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat , with his legs pumping away . 
 He has a girlfriend already . 
 Her new girlfriend is a far cry from Ann . She is like a breath of fresh air . 
 What was the last movie you saw ? 
 Really ? I've seen that movie , too . 
 I thought it was pretty good . 
 You're kidding . The story and acting were outstanding . 
 I guess it could happen . 
 That is a deadly risky business . He should have it coming on him . 
 I bet he is . He domed his own life . 
 Oh , about two years now . 
 They still live in Shanghai where I was born . 
 Yes , I try to keep in touch with them . 
 I am the apartment manager . How can I help you ? 
 Yes , it's still vacant . Are you interested in seeing it ? 
 I will be at the apartment today at 6 
 Great . I'll see you at 6 . Do you know where it is ? 
 I'll be bringing an application form . 
 No . I might need to see your ID card , but that's about it . 
 Why are you in such a hurry ? 
 Bye ! 
 Oh , yeah , A . Thank you for approving my job . 
 Yeah , I believe it , but I want to know if you will give me a raise . 
 You are right , boss , but I need specific confirm to keep the future work better . 
 To get around your difficulty , Mr Smith . I'd suggest that you reduce your order by half . You can send in an additional order later . 
 A month before the time you want the goods to be delivered . 
 Getting the goods ready , making out the documents and booking the shipping space , all this takes time you know . You cannot expect us to make delivery in less than a month . 
 When will that be ? 
 You can rest assured of that . 
 Of course and very well . 
 Oh , very easy . They are heart , spade , club and diamond . 
 Would mornings or afternoons be best for you ? 
 It is best if we can go during the week ; does that work for you ? 
 Would you like to meet at the real estate office , or should I pick you up at home ? 
 We could spend most of the day looking at houses to see all that we have to see . 
 I will fax you a schedule as soon as I contact the owners to confirm the times . 
 Yeah . You said it . 
 I ’ Ve done that . The doctor advised me to cut out smoking and drinking . 
 Most willingly . It's 600 dollars per ton . 
 But you know , the price of this article has soared up since last year . 
 OK . I can make a special offer for you . This price is based on careful calculations . And it is the lowest price we can offer to you . 
 I will need you to take your clothes off from the waist up and put on the gown , leaving the opening in the back . 
 I will need you to face this glass plate right over here . 
 Your arms need to be raised to shoulder height . 
 So far , so good . 
 I am not leaving . I just need you to take a really deep breath , hold it , and then let it out . 
 You will be able to put your clothes on as soon as I have checked the film . 
 Good morning , this is Jane . This is Apple Co . Ltd . 
 Yes , this is . May I help you ? 
 Oh , the results have come out , and I can tell you ... Yes , I find your name . You are hired . Congratulations ! 
 Next Monday morning . 
 Your starting salary is 2500 yuan a month , and after you become a permanent employee , it will be higher . 
 See you ! 
 Well . My watch says five past two . But it ’ s no use rely on it because it has been gaining and losing these last a few days . 
 Yes . I will . 
 It's on the 7th floor . As you get off the elevator , you'll see it on your left . 
 Sure . Go straight ahead and you'll walk into it . 
 You're welcome . 
 I haven't gone to the interview yet . It's tomorrow . I am so nervous . 
 I hope so . 
 Thanks , I'll keep that in mind . 
 Don't worry.The bus will arrive soon . 
 That's no use.This is morning rush hour . 
 I ’ Ve never seem such a scene either except in films . 
 Good evening , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 How would you like your Bourbon , straight or on the rock ? 
 Here you are , sir . Bourbon with iced water . 
 The bourbon is 15 dollars plus 10 % service charge . So the total is 16.5 dollars . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Thank you , Joe . What would you like to drink with your meal ? I can offer you wine , mango juice , or water . 
 Excellent choice . Can I dish you up some chicken ? 
 How about some salad to go with your chicken ? 
 Would you like to have rice with your chicken ? 
 Good ! Julie , if you could pass this plate down to Joe , I think we are all set . 
 I love them , too . Let's move into the kitchen . Wait until you see the refrigerator . 
 And the stove is brand new . You know how to use a gas stove , right ? 
 It's better for cooking Chinese food . Well , what do you think ? 
 Do you have any questions ? 
 Yes , after you ’ Ve been here a year , you qualify for a three-day vacation 
 That's the company policy . 
 Yes . That's the company policy . 
 Do you have change for a hundred ? 
 Mom , can we get cable TV or a satellite dish ? 
 The shows are dull and they ’ re too many advertisements . 
 There ’ re educational stations too . I could learn while I watched TV . 
 No I wouldn ’ t ... can ’ t we get cable ? Everybody has cable . 
 Mom ! ! ! Please . All my friends have had it for years . 
 Why are you always so mean ? 
 I could help pay for it . 
 O . K . Thanks , Mom ! 
 There ’ s some , but I don ’ t think it ’ s a big problem . A lot of it is petty crime , burglary and car theft . There ’ s very little major crime . 
 That happens in many places . In my city , there is a very good drug rehabilitation programme . The police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes , but I don ’ t know if that ’ s the reason for 
 I think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . If most people have similar amounts of money , they will not think of stealing from others . 
 Shall we share a taxi ? 
 I want to go back to my college on the Huanghe road.It is very close to your house . 
 That's the one . 
 Yeah.If we share the cab , it'll be cheaper.Besides that your Chinese is better than mine.The drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though I practice my pronunciation carefully . 
 do you like playing games ? 
 how about individual games like the Rubik's cube or solitaire ? 
 if I taught you how to do it , I'm sure you could solve it . 
 I didn't really have to figure it out . I just followed the instructions ! 
 hints are really important when you're solving puzzles . If you give me some hints about playing that PS2 game , I ’ ll show you how to solve the Rubik's cube . 
 do you remember , years ago , when everybody at the New Year's party had yo-yos ? 
 I don't know . I haven't tried yo-yo since that party ! 
 if you don't start when you're young , it's hard to get the hang of it . 
 ok . 
 It ’ s nice to go home earlier once in a while . But now it ’ s the evening rush . 
 Sure it is . I really hate to get caught in a traffic jam . 
 It's a pleasure to meet you . My name is Lucy . 
 Yes , I'm from Salt Lake City . 
 I'm glad to hear that . I think it's the nicest city in the United States . 
 It is very nice . 
 Can I order room service ? 
 Good . 
 OK.thanks . 
 I had a great time on the last date . 
 What will you up to this weekend ? 
 would you like to go to skating ? I was thinking of going out to the - - Saturday . It's great up there . Would you like to go with me ? 
 Ok , there is a bunch of going bowling on Sunday . Would you like to go ? 
 Would you like to dancing tonight ? 
 I miss you too . Tell me where you like to do the next day . 
 Anything you say , honey . 
 24th ? I have time . But I can't wait that long , I'm dying to see you . Let's make another time . 
 What is the most unexpected thing you experienced in space ? 
 When viewing the Earth from space , do you feel detached from humanity or more a part of the totality of humankind ? 
 There're a lot of suspicions that the International Space Station is never going to become reality . Is it going to be some future project that never happens ? 
 There were a lot of talks during the Bush administration about a not too distant future Mars mission . It seemed to fizzle out . Do you think that this Shuttle mission will reignite the public's passion for space and get us to Mars sooner ? 
 You had gone to the moon twice , orbited space around the Earth lots of times , and of course you have had the most amazing views that a human being can have . How long do we ordinary beings have to wait to feel the weightlessness ? I just can't wait . 
 Excuse me . Would you please make a suit with this material ? 
 Please don't make it too tight . This is for autumn wear , so make sure you allow for a cardigan underneath . 
 The 10th ? I'm sorry , but you see I'm going to attend an international conference on the 11th . Could you have the suit ready by the 8th , or at the latest , the 9th ? 
 That's fine , thank you . 
 Yes . It is Everest , also called Zhumulangma in China . It is 8,844 . 43 meters above the sea level . 
 Actually , it is impossible because the mountain is covered with snow all year around . And is has heavy fog for most of the time . 
 Yes , it has been conquered by many people in history . 
 thanks , I like it too . I bought it at the nearby department store . 
 yeah , I know that . But at those places . the prices they ask you are ridiculously high , and if you don't bargain hard , you will get ripped-off . 
 yeah , but personally , I hate bargaining . If I bargain , I might come to a lower price , but I will never know the true price of what I am buying ; and I always have the feeling that I am overcharged at th 
 that's why I like department stores more . Shopping at a wholesale market like the locals is one of the few things I am unable to grow accustomed to . 
 My name's McDonald . 
 It's M , C , capital D . 
 Single or return ? 
 A return ticket is forty-six pounds fifty . 
 My watch says half past five . 
 Oh yeah . It loses only a few seconds in the whole month . 
 What's today's date ? 
 When are you going on vacation ? 
 Really ? The day after tomorrow ? That's very soon . 
 How long are you going to stay there ? 
 When are you coming back ? 
 Alright . Have a nice trip . 
 No problem , of course ! How much would you like to spend to impress the lady ? 
 Sir , the restaurant you seek is right here . This hotel has a three-star restaurant . 
 Gramercy Tavern is at least as good as our own hotel restaurant . Plus , they have live jazz . 
 Right away , sir . She will be impressed with your local knowledge . 
 Can you tell me which credit card it was for ? 
 You should've gotten that bill two weeks ago . 
 The computer is showing that all bills have been mailed . 
 Maybe you should call your post office . 
 Yes , but you will need to send us proof of their mistake . 
 Not a problem . Enjoy the rest of your day . 
 You are right . We shouldn't do anything under the table . 
 Hi , welcome to Hal's Computer World . Can I help you with anything ? 
 No problem . First of all , do you want to get a home computer or a laptop ? 
 Yes , they generally cost a little more . 
 Sam , can we stop at this bicycle shop ? 
 Yes , and they have a sale on now . 
 I left it at my parent's house , but I need one here as well . 
 Let's go then . 
 I prefer something like this one - a touring bike , but it is more expensive . 
 The price on the tag says £ 565 but maybe you can get a discount . 
 Good afternoon , would you mind if I sit here ? 
 I ’ m Jack . What ’ s your name ? 
 Do you like this place ? 
 How often ? 
 Who ’ s that ? 
 Do you like swimming ? 
 Do you have any idea what time it is ? 
 Do you really think that that excuses your tardiness ? 
 Didn't I tell you to call when you're running late ? 
 It doesn't matter , you should have called and let me know . 
 If you do this again , don't even bother coming home . 
 Exactly , maybe that'll teach you to respect my rules . 
 Have you heard of Paul ? 
 He's got a promotion . 
 No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells . 
 Well , it's true . The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul . 
 Jack , could you check your calendar ? 
 We're planning a weekend camping trip , and we want to know which weekend is best for everyone . 
 China is now a member of world trade organization . As a member of TO , China will have to make some changes in its economic policies so that it can follow the routines practiced by other TO members . Is it fair to China , do you think ? 
 We can infer that the non-discrimination principle is one of the most important principles of TO agreement . This principle requires equal treatment of domestic and foreign enterprise . Does the principle also apply to domestic enterprise of different ownerships ? 
 I'm trying to reach Robert please . 
 What time should I call back ? 
 Our benefits usually include medical insurance , public accumulation fund and allowances . 
 If you go on a business trip , you will enjoy the allowance . It is 200 yuan per day . 
 As a new-comer , you usually have five days of annual vacation . And remember you have to fill out a request form , if you want to ask for leave . 
 Of course . In spring and autumn , we will hold some sports actives . And in movie seasons , we bulk purchase film tickets . 
 Yes , I am new . 
 I just transferred from another school . 
 I came here from PCC . 
 I am really enjoying it here so far . 
 I think PCC is a lot better than here . 
 I graduated and now want to get a BA . 
 A double cheeseburger sounds good . 
 Yes , please . 
 I would love large curly fries . 
 Yes , let me have a medium Pepsi . 
 Yeah , that's it . Thank you . 
 Here you go . Thank you very much . 
 We have been on good terms . She is a very nice girl . But she got in Dutch with her boss . I don ’ t have the heart to see her pounding the pavements . 
 Well , we hit it off with each other . Nothing more , nothing much . 
 Was it ? 
 Thank you.It was really a challenge to speak before such a large audience , you know . 
 Well Rebecca , is there anything else you need to know for now ? 
 Okay well listen , here is my business card with my mobile number . If any other questions spring to mind don ’ t hesitate to contact me . Of course you can also call Miss Childs too . 
 Well , we are finishing the shortlist interviews tomorrow , so we will certainly have a decision made by early next week . Miss Childs will call you to discuss more on Monday or Tuesday . How does that so 
 The pleasure ’ s all mine , Rebecca . 
 Absolutely . Thanks for coming Rebecca . Goodbye . 
 no , we're not . We've been drifting apart for a while . 
 we did , but since she started her new job , all she does is hang out with her new friends from work . 
 I could , but all they ever talk about is work , so I always end up feeling left out . 
 I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her ! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her . 
 you're right . She would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge . But she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore . 
 I've given her enough time . I'm over it now . 
 I think I just have to accept the fact that it's time for us to go our separate ways . 
 I just got it at the special health store . It's for my flabby arms . 
 I have to say , I have had enough of this roller coaster . 
 Last week I was down to 60 kilos . This week I had one donut more . Now I'm up to 62 kilos . 
 Hi , Susan . What can I do for you ? 
 Let me take a look . Just a second . That ’ s no problem , Susan . See you on Wednesday . 
 Yeah , really . 
 Hi , I ’ m Susan Marshall , You can call me Susan.Nice to meet you . 
 Well , I ’ m a college student.How about you ? 
 Our housing problem is a highly complicated issue . 
 Right . Like our LPF program . The mortgage size is linked with the amount of savings households have accumulated on their LPF accounts . 
 Like you and me ! 
 I noticed there ’ s a jam a few blocks away . 
 I ’ m afraid I ’ ll be late . 
 Of course ! Are you ? 
 You should know that . 
 The election is this Tuesday . 
 I ’ m not kidding . 
 That should ’ Ve been something you knew already . 
 Whatever . Just make sure you go vote . 
 Thanks . 
 My sister did it . When did you get yours cut ? 
 Well , it looks very nice . 
 Thank you for a lovely day . I really enjoyed it . 
 Thank you for the picnic too . It was supper . 
 Yes , I'd love to . Thanks again . Goodbye . 
 A cup of coffee sounds good , doesn't it ? 
 Do you feel like having anything to eat ? 
 Sounds great . That's just what I feel like having . 
 I don't feel so good , Mom . 
 No , Mom . I'm really sick . 
 I think Andy's party will be fun . 
 What's that ? 
 Sure . Oh , that reminds me . Could I borrow your black leather boots ? 
 Hilton Hotel . Can I help you ? 
 Fine . Beginning when ? 
 That's the twenty-fourth of June ? 
 Your name , please ? 
 Single or double ? 
 You're all set . That's a double room for the twenty-fourth , twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth of June , in the name of Hamlin . 
 Sure , just send me through internal mail . 
 No problem at all . Welcome . 
 Cheer ! 
 Half past seven in the morning . 
 In the market . 
 Bottoms up . 
 Thank you . This place is nice . 
 Wait a minute . I think we have missed an important point . We should include an arbitration clause in the contract . 
 I hope so . too . But I still think the provision of arbitration is of great importance to both of us . 
 I suggest the arbitration be held in a third country . 
 Ok . 
 It's Thursday , I think . 
 We're busy on weekdays , but we'll have a good rest at the weekend . 
 I went shopping without my umbrella yesterday morning . 
 So did i . that's why i didn't take my umbrella . i got cold in the rain in the afternoon.it was raining cats and dogs . 
 We really have some miserable weather sometime . i wish i would live somewhere which were sunning all year round . 
 I guess you are right . maybe i just wish the weather could be a little more predictable . 
 I have to go up to London for a couple of days next week . Would you like to come ? 
 Well , I prefer to go on the train , but I suppose you want me to take the car . 
 And I've got to drive . You know I'm not fond of that . I found it much more relaxing to sit in the train . 
 But very much quicker . But I know we'll never agree on this subject . You prefer the car . I prefer the train . 
 Hello ? 
 Yes . 
 Not too bad , thanks . And you ? 
 I'm terribly sorry , but I've already made arrangements for Wednesday . 
 That would be fine . 
 Whenever is suitable for you . I have no plans for that day . 
 And where would you like to meet ? 
 I'm not very familiar with Chinese cuisine . What can you recommend ? 
 Of course ! Peking Duck is world-famous . I would love to try it . 
 All right . Well , I'll see you later . 
 Lisa wins the first prize in the English speech contest of her college . 
 But I always feel disappointed . I have many problems with English learning . 
 I feel confused about the grammars . 
 And my writing is not good . I feel so frustrated . 
 I know that , mom . But sometimes I'm just sad . 
 Yes , mom . You are right . Nothing is impossible to a willing heart . I will keep going . 
 How long have your headaches been going on ? 
 Any unusual amounts of stress in your life going on right now ? 
 Have you been able to sleep regular hours ? 
 Has anything hit you in the head lately ? 
 Let ’ s have you come back in a few days and see how you feel . 
 How do you do ? 
 I come from the city of Tangshan in Hebes Province . 
 Really ? It's nice to meet you . How long have you been with this company ? 
 Oh , Thank you very much ! 
 This is Kevin . 
 Yes . 
 wow ! That ’ s great . Sure , I can . Where is the Human Resources Office ? 
 Thank you very much . I ’ ll be there on time . 
 Fred , we're gonna have a meeting after half an hour . Have you got it ? 
 Hush ! The wall has ears , you know . 
 My boy . I give you my sympathy to you . However , this meeting is said to be extremely important , so we have to attend it . 
 It is to give honors and promotions to some colleagues who made outstanding performance last year . 
 I am sorry to hear that you are not feeling well . How are you ? 
 Is that so ? But I think It shouldn't keep you long in bed . 
 I'm hungry . 
 It wasn't enough , because I'm hungry again . 
 I'm going to get a snack . 
 I don't know . 
 I don't know what kind of sandwich I want . 
 I may just do that . 
 Sarah , what did you do today ? 
 Did you buy anything ? 
 What did you buy ? 
 Yeah , I like it a lot . It's very pretty . Where did you buy it ? 
 Was it expensive ? 
 That's cheap . 
 I don't think you'll need to wear it for a while . It's been really hot lately . 
 Yes . This is Mrs.Davinson . I'd like to reserve a two-room suite for tonight . 
 Mrs.Davinson . Mary Davison . M-A-R-Y , mary . D-A-V-I-N-S-O-N . Davison . 
 Thank you . Good-bye . 
 What do you do in summer ? 
 I don ’ t often go for walks , but I either play sports outside-you know , tennis or badminton-or just sit in the sunshine and read a good book . 
 Well , I play sports indoors quite often . If I ’ m feeling lazy , I just watch a film at home . I prefer summer to winter . 
 Yes . I like wearing shorts in summer . My legs would freeze ! 
 Thanks to global warming , it could be hotter than ever ! 
 Wow ! It's a trivia game all about the Academy Awards . 
 Does it have questions about foreign language films ? There's hardly any American films worth watching . 
 Have you found another job yet , Sally ? 
 What kind of job are you looking for ? 
 You haven't had any experience in either of those fields . 
 What position have you held before ? 
 Would you tell me the general description of your present job ? 
 What made you decide to change your job ? 
 Why do you leave your present company ? 
 Why did you pick this organization ? 
 What made you decide to join our company ? 
 Wow ! Look at all these books ! I bet I can find a book about anything here ! 
 Ok , I'm sorry . Are you the librarian ? Maybe you can help me , I am looking for a book . 
 I am looking for a book that has nursery rhymes . 
 Ok , I would like to check out these books . 
 No . How do I get one ? 
 Here you go . 
 Ok , thanks ! 
 Hi , Don . What a surprise ! 
 Have you noticed what has changed ? 
 Yes . I ’ m on a diet , but I ’ Ve not taken anything . I just eat less and exercise more . And it really worked in the past three months . I ’ Ve lost twelve pounds . 
 What kind of exercise do you think I do ? I just go to dance everyday after work . I ’ m taking an amateur dance class . I dance two hours everyday . 
 Sure . Join my class next week . 
 Sorry , I'll bring them to you right away . 
 We are short of staff today . 
 What's wrong ? 
 They were delivered this morning . 
 I received an E-mail from mother today . 
 She missed us and asked when we would go back home . 
 I don't know . Maybe next week . We haven't been to the Great Wall yet . 
 All right . 
 Congratulation . What will you do ? 
 That's wonderful . I want to get a part-time job too . Tell me what I should do . 
 Good . I'll do it . 
 What is a sixties party ? 
 That sounds like fun . But where can I get clothes that old ? 
 Good idea . Can I bring some music from that period too ? 
 Don't tell me you have a record player ! 
 Hi , I need to transfer some money to another account . It ’ s urgent . 
 No . I ’ Ve never made a transfer before . 
 A company account . I need to pay a bill . 
 I have all the information in this folder . 
 Oh , that ’ s such a relief . I didn ’ t want the payment to be overdue . Thank you so much . 
 What does your company do exactly ? 
 And who do you sell to ? 
 Hi , who has the remote control ? 
 Yes , please . I can't stand watching the channel any more . 
 Put it on Channel 5 , OK ? 
 Don't make such a fuss . I'm sure you will like today's programme . 
 A basketball match between Chinese team and American team . 
 It might begin now . 
 Yes , are you Mr James ? 
 That's right . 
 Of course not . My name is Li Ping . Is this all your baggage ? 
 Welcome to Hong Kong . I'll go and get the car . Could you please wait a few minutes ? 
 Thank you.Steven.That was the most magnificent meal I've had abroad.You ' ll have to let me reciprocate the next time you're in Beijing . 
 We don't . 
 At hotels and some restaurants they add a service charge to the bill , but other than that , tipping isn't customary . 
 In a cab you just pay what it says on the meter . I generally tip hotel porters 10 yuan per bag , but in first-class hotels they're instructed not to accept gratuities . 
 The country is strong only in appearance . Don ’ t you think so ? 
 You can say that again . The government must open it ’ s eyes to the fact . 
 Nothing planned . How about you ? 
 I'm always up for a drink . To tell you the truth , it's been quite stressful here too . 
 But we have to work tomorrow . 
 I hear ya . Let's do it . 
 You see , I've been offered a new job . I can't decide whether to take it or not . 
 It isn't that easy . I hate to quit my present job . People around here are very nice and the work itself is challenging . 
 Yes , they say I would get a big sum . 
 Yes , she leaves it to me . 
 I have to think about it . 
 How do you do , Ms . Chi ? 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , we have . I ’ Ve brought with me a list of the quantity of your products we ’ d like to import for the second half of this year . Here is a copy of it . 
 I hope so , too . Now I'd like some of your sales literature and a price list for all of your export articles . 
 Thank you , Ms Chi . What are your normal export terms ? 
 What commission do you usually pay for your exports ? As you know , we import on commission basis . 
 All right . When can we meet again for more specific details , Ms Chi ? 
 I'll be expecting you , then . 
 Eight o'clock . It's time for you to get up and have breakfast . 
 You won't go to work today , Steven , It's Sunday . Come and have breakfast now . 
 You have been too tired recently , darling . That's why I didn't wake you up this morning . After breakfast , you can go to sleep again . 
 I love her so much , you know . I want to be alone . Please keep quiet . 
 What's wrong ? 
 Have you checked the fuse box ? 
 There might be a loose connection somewhere that's making the safety switch trip . Check the settings on the trip-switch . If you can't fix it yourself , call in an electrician . 
 Sorry , We don't take returns on sale items . 
 Well , I'm not sure . Maybe it means we can buy something through the Internet . 
 It must be very convenient and pretty quick . 
 Have you met John recently ? 
 Yes , he has been like that since his accident . 
 Where did you get assigned to go this time around ? 
 Hong Kong again . I would like to go somewhere different for a change . 
 If you really want to learn , remind me when you get back from your business trip . 
 When do you leave ? 
 I would like to buy a ticket to New York please . 
 I ’ d like to pack my bags and leave tonight . 
 Yes I know , but I just got the chance to leave and so I am going to take it no matter what . 
 I wish I could stay there , but unfortunately it will have to be a round trip ticket . 
 My return date will be the 14th . 
 Anything but a center seat is fine with me . The middle seat drives me crazy ! 
 Will there be any layovers ? 
 Perfect ! I ’ m afraid to ask , but how much is it ? 
 I spend all my time looking after my baby . I'm so tired . 
 I've tried it , but he would have none of it . 
 So what ? 
 Wow , I like concerts . 
 Yes , it is . Kelly ? 
 Do you have a cold ? 
 Oh , no ! What about your presentation today ? 
 I understand . What should I tell Mr . Morley ? 
 Alright . Have you been to see a doctor ? 
 Do you think you'll be able to come in tomorrow ? Or should I call off your appointments for tomorrow too ? 
 It's rainy weather today . Maybe it's better if you just stay inside.Make yourself some chicken soup and sleep . 
 That bad , huh ? 
 Well , I'll cancel your appointments for today . And I'll tell Mr . Morley . 
 Hope you feel better . 
 Oh , you are such a good child today . Come here . Sit next to me . 
 Oh , you read ? Very good . Then , I think we should do something different today . I'll give you some privilege . 
 Now I see what you read the book for . But it's fine . I'll give you the lion's share . 
 This is not common noodles . They're “ long-lived ” noodles.it ' s an old Chinese tradition to eat.long - lived noodle on birthday . 
 Hi Colin . How are you feeling today ? 
 It's probably jet lag . 
 Do you want to visit any tourist spots in the city ? 
 Good idea . I ’ d be very happy to go there . 
 Yes , we really enjoyed it . 
 Yes , that sounds great . 
 The apple crisp sounds great . 
 Good suggestion . Could you please bring us a chocolate mousse cake and four dessert forks , please ? 
 Let's have four coffees , please . 
 Thank you ! We have really enjoyed our meal here . 
 Same here , Ms . Drake . I've been looking forward to this . 
 No , no , no , not at all , you were right on time . I was early . I hope I didn ’ t rush you . I ’ m glad for the opportunity to interview with you . 
 I ’ m fine , thank you . 
 Great , that ’ s why I ’ m here . 
 Fine ! How about you ? 
 what was your wedding ceremony like , Abigail ? 
 three parties ? That's quite a lot . That must have been expensive ! 
 were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ? 
 did your husband's family get to meet your family ? 
 that makes sense . Did you go on a honeymoon ? 
 you really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ? 
 Have you got any better ? 
 Okay , I'll take one . 
 If we are to modernize our information processing , manufacturing system and management code , we need to complete our office automation . 
 Our copying machines are too slow , our telephone system is limited in function , and our offices are not well-equipped for us to work efficiently . To improve the offices for higher efficiency , we have to change all the chairs and some of the desks also , redesign our office so that we may have more space . 
 Good afternoon , what can I do for you today ? 
 That's no problem . We have many different ways to go about getting a mortgage and all with terms to suit you . 
 Well , congratulations ! It's lovely being a newly wed , but also so much pressure . Could you tell me what kind of property you are looking for ? 
 Yes , I see . There are just the two of you at the moment . Please take a look through this brochure ; it's especially for first-time-buyers . I think it'll be very helpful . 
 Welcome to Lens Magic , ma ’ am.How can I help you ? 
 Well , we ’ Ve got several point-and-shoot cameras.These are all 35mm compact cameras with auto-focus and a built-in flash.We also have these Polaroid cameras . 
 Yes , it does.But you can turn it off if you want . 
 Yes , it does.Here , I ’ ll box it up for you . 
 When did it happen ? 
 Tell me where it happened and how . 
 That happens often these days . Well , please fill in this Report of Theft . 
 This is where we sing ? These booths are so comfortable I think I could fall asleep ! 
 I'll have whatever you're having . 
 Well ... the beer sounds good ! 
 I don't know . You know what they say about office romances . 
 They say you shouldn't mix love and work . 
 You ’ Ve got a point . Once I dated one of my supervisors and all of my co-workers accused him of favoritism . Then when the relationship went bad , he fired me . 
 That may be true , but I don't want an inter-office relationship to affect my productivity . 
 You are sounding like we are already married . 
 Well , I don't feel right about it . 
 Most starts with dinner , but then it gets out of hand . Besides , haven't you asked out every woman in the entire office ? 
 Company ? I heard about you from Linda . She said you were an octopus ! 
 Well , I hope you can find something else to be passionate about . 
 In your dreams . Now if you don't mind , I've got some work to do . 
 What's going on ? 
 This Friday , I'm throwing a party . 
 Are you serious ? 
 Can you make it ? 
 The party starts at 8 . 
 Am I going to see you there ? 
 Have you ever gotten a parking ticket ? 
 I got a ticket yesterday . 
 I parked in the red zone . 
 I needed to get something really quick . 
 At my apartment building . 
 I needed to be fast . 
 What shall we do today ? 
 Let's go out for some exercise , shall we ? 
 Shall we do some jogging ? 
 I feel well now . 
 Quite right . 
 My main duties include designing survey sheets , transferring them to the dispatchers , making telephone covering on blurred information and processing the data and doing the primary analysis . 
 First , it was how to design survey sheets according to the subjects , because we had to prevent the questions from being too influential and we must make sure that every question was balanced and equitable . Secondly , it was how to get information through telephone covering in the fastest and most effectively way , because the person doing the survey usually doesn ’ t have the patience to wait for long feedback . So the way we put up questions must be clear and direct and only by this means can we get accurate data . 
 Hello , Is that Stefan ? 
 Really ? Are you sure ? I called before and he was there . 
 That can't be true . I remember the number clearly . Is your number 1199886 ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry I bothered you . I'm really sorry . 
 Sorry again for bothering you . 
 I'm sorry I'm so late . I had a really bad day . 
 I know . I know . I'm really sorry . I lost my bag . 
 I didn't think of it.Thank you.And I do apologize for being late . 
 I'm not feeling well , doctor . I have a sore throat . 
 Yes , my back aches . 
 It began the night before last . 
 Lots of people are ill at the moment . 
 What would you like for Christmas ? 
 Have you asked Santa ? 
 Here , Let me get the door for you . 
 Do you need a hand with that ? 
 Don't worry about it . 
 What attracts you most ? 
 I was told my friend Joe was speaking ill of me . That's a real let-down . 
 Maybe I should go and ask him whether it's true . 
 Depends . 
 It has stopped snowing , but it's even colder . 
 And the streets are covered with snow . 
 I missed today's weather forecast over the TV . 
 The ice will soon be thick enough for skating . I am so fond of winter sports . 
 How about you , Chuck ? Where did you grow up ? 
 And when did you come to Los Angeles ? 
 Oh . What was your major ? 
 That's interesting . So why did you become a hairdresser ? 
 Good morning , Jim ! 
 Yes , it is . The sun is shining . There is no wind , only a pleasant breeze . 
 We have decided to go to the park this Sunday . Would you like to go with us if you have not decided yet ? 
 He ’ s predicting clear skies . 
 Mike promised to help us . 
 Why not ? 
 I can look anybody in the face because I ’ Ve done nothing to make me feel guilty or something . 
 You are flattering me . 
 OK , what would you like ? 
 Sure and which one would you like ? 
 Are you looking for shoes ? 
 What about this brown one ? 
 I think I'll write a book . 
 All of the time tested healthy habits from around the world . 
 The interesting thing is to see what really works and what's just hype . 
 That's right . I think we all have much we can learn from each other . 
 I am sorry I am so late to work . 
 I lost track of time . 
 OK , it won't happen again . 
 OK , no problem . 
 Yes , I understand the numbers . 
 Here you are . You left the medicine here . 
 I firmly believe that you love your brother very much . 
 Yes , we have some Chinese medicine for common cold . 
 It depends . It's true that you can take some for prevention . 
 Yes , I want to send a registered airmail letter to France . 
 Here is five dollars . 
 I also want to pack up my package . This is the notes . 
 Oh , one more thing , where can I mail this letter ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 We're thinking about going to America . 
 There is that . 
 You're just left school , haven't you , Emily ? 
 You sound relieved . 
 Well , what are you going to do now ? Have you made any plans ? 
 You mean getting into university actually depends on your passing your A level subjects ? 
 Good morning , Mr . Huang . It's a pleasure to meet you again . 
 Thank you . Can I meet my colleagues ? 
 Hi , Steven , welcome to join us ! 
 That ’ s right . Just call me if you need anything . 
 Well , as the other guys are still not in , I ’ ll introduce you to them later . 
 What do you do ? 
 Really ? That ’ s so cool . 
 What station do you work at ? 
 Marry Wang's Office , this is Marry . 
 How can I help you ? 
 This section of the store is called Junior . Why is that ? 
 But I can't find anything in my size here . 
 Well , there's nothing I can do about my height ! 
 What's in the petite section ? 
 Excuse me , I'm looking for your 3 - liter Pepsis , the ones that are on sale this week . There don't seem to be any in the soft drink section . 
 Yes , I would , thank you . 
 Did you get any pizza ? When I got there , only small one was left . What a pity ! 
 What's that , a new video game ? 
 For instance ? 
 Wow ! Anything else ? 
 What if I want to use CD-ROMs or floppies ? 
 Hurry up , Daniel , it's Barbie time . 
 Come on , it's cool outside . 
 Hey , Daniel , what's your favorite weather ? Snowy or sunny ? 
 What ? Are you crazy ? 
 Ew , Danny , gross ! 
 I love snowy , because it is very very romantic . 
 Are you through with your meal ? 
 Here is your bill . 150 yuan in all . 
 No , I'm sorry we don't . We accept credit cards and cash . 
 OK . ( A few minutes later ) Sorry to keep you waiting . Here is your change . 
 My pleasure . Welcome to our restaurant next time . 
 Cool ! Flashy red lines ! 
 Is it waterproof ? 
 Uh , huh ... so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for ? 
 Isn ’ t this great ? I always wanted to own a farm , live out in the country , grow my own food ! 
 That ’ s fine ! Don ’ t worry about it ! 
 Relax , it was just a goat ! 
 It ’ s just the cows that are grazing over there . We can milk them later . 
 Honey , seriously , It ’ s just a sheep . Relax ! 
 You know what ? I don ’ t think I can hack it here out in the countryside . I ’ m going back to the city ! 
 I had to . I was missing you a lot . 
 So , why haven't you visited me ? 
 What have you been doing ? 
 I've also been busy . 
 Basically , I've been working too . 
 So am I . 
 We're going to that new restaurant for lunch . Would you like to join us ? 
 Where have you been ? I've been trying to get in touch with you for two days . 
 I got fired . 
 It's a long story . In a word , I didn't do a good job of it . I messed up a business deal , a deal that would have made ten million dollars and I messed it up . 
 I am trying to find a job asap . Lily doesn't know yet . I didn't tell her . I spent the past three days at the coffee shop next to your office , and she thought I went to work as usual . 
 Yes , I did . But I wasn't qualified for most of the jobs that I was interested in . 
 I just don't know how to bring it up . Well , all right . She has the right to know anyways . 
 Chicken ! 
 Dogs are nice , but they are really energetic , and you need to make sure they get enough exercise every day . 
 What about cats ? They are more independent . 
 How about a lizard ? Are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting ? 
 Yeah , they are pretty low-maintenance ; they eat almost anything . 
 Sure ! Are you okay ? You seem a bit worried.What ’ s on your mind ? 
 Okay ... 
 What ? Why ? I mean , we ’ Ve had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we ’ re happy together , aren ’ t we ? 
 So , what are you saying ? You ’ re breaking up with me because I ’ m perfect ? 
 Baby , come on . Don ’ t do this to me ! Whatever it is , we can work it out . Just give me another chance ! I know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! Don ’ t leave me . 
 Laura ... 
 You have been so busy these months . What are you up to ? 
 I'd like a facial . 
 Which would you recommend ? 
 What does it included ? 
 Does it include facial mask and massage ? 
 Will it exfoliate the skin as well ? 
 That sounds great . 
 Yes , of course . And I'm amazed the those karate and judo boys were so helpless before the wrestlers . 
 You're going go Dresden for sightseeing ? 
 I think a train journey is as fast as a bus journey . 
 Your search on this project has been excellent . 
 The final report is exceptionally thorough and well done . I think that you have been come up with some interesting recommendations for the client . 
 I am sure they will be pleased . 
 What fools we were ! 
 And my new car . To think that he simply drove off with everything in my car . That's what hurts me most . 
 I hardly dare call the police . They'll just laugh at us . 
 And his story didn't even hold together . I feel such an idiot . 
 I'd like to pay this cash into my account please . I usually do it at the machine , but the queue is very long today . 
 I see . Here's my Bank Book . 
 Thanks . 
 Yes , you're at the right stop . 
 Are you new here ? 
 Have you got small change ? They require exact fare . 
 One yuan . When you get on the front of the bus , just drop your money into the box . 
 It runs every ten minutes . Oh , here comes the bus . 
 Well , I have the day off from work . 
 Well , I ’ Ve been working so hard lately , so I ’ ll probably just take it easy . 
 Yeah , I ’ ll probably just stay in and relax . Maybe watch a few movies . 
 Sure . Any time . 
 Today is December 23,2002 . 
 Merry Christmas to you ! 
 That is a blast from the past . 
 Yes . You sure have come a long way in valuing your hard earned dollars . 
 But what are you going to do with that pig ? 
 Who knows , maybe one day he will sit on the desk of a top CEO in a major corporation ! 
 I'd like to get a good RPG . Can you recommend any ? 
 This one looks pretty good , but I'd like to see more before I make up my mind . Do you have any other suggestions ? 
 Hmm , it's a tough choice , but I think I'll go with this one . 
 That's not a problem . Just give me your name , phone number , and date of visit . 
 I see your info here on the screen . I'll hit just one button , sir , and you're cancelled . 
 It's a pleasure . 
 I won't ever forget it ! I was sitting in the cafeteria all by myself ... 
 Oh , it seems like it was just yesterday . 
 I like baseball and basketball . 
 In my country football is brand new , so I never learned the game when I was younger . 
 Yeah . I heard a lot about it . Is it really that fun ? 
 Are you a football player ? 
 What is two hand touch and flag football ? 
 I see . It's safer then right ? 
 I'll give it a try . Give me a call and let's go down together . 
 Great . 
 I don't find it very exciting . 
 I can't wait ! 
 Alright and what is your name , please ? 
 Ah , yes , here you are Ms . Gleason . You reserved a single , right ? 
 Do you mind being next to the elevator ? 
 Are you going to the party on Saturday ? 
 Yeah , I heard it's going to be a lot of fun . 
 It starts at 8 
 Everyone from school . 
 This party is going to have a DJ , food , and drinks . 
 So am I going to see you at the party ? 
 William , do you like studying English ? 
 It's not that bad . If you talk to your American friends every day , you'll learn quickly . 
 Sure , what do you want to know ? 
 Laptop . 
 A laptop is a type of computer that you can carry with you . Do you understand ? 
 Laptop . 
 Yes , that's right . That's very good . 
 That word is pronounced kitchen . 
 Thanks . 
 I would if I could . 
 Yes , With pleasure . 
 Thank you . It's very kind of you to invite me to such a beautiful place . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Thank you . Oh , it tastes nice . 
 Well , Vince dropped off some sales reports for you.Said you signed a big deal with HomeSupplies.com . 
 You're right . All the entertainment web sites follow Stars.com . 
 Elvin stopped by to see me . 
 Hello.this is Susan . 
 Yes , I think So . 
 What ’ s the time ? 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry I can ’ t because I have to do some housework.You can ask Jenny to go with you 
 Good bye ! 
 I'm having a great time . I love it . I'm glad we came . 
 I love the museums , too . 
 Yeah . I hate all this traffic . It's really noisy . 
 I can't stand making decisions . You choose ! 
 May I help you ? 
 What dose she look like ? 
 What was she wearing ? 
 When did you last see her ? 
 How long has it been ? 
 George , did you remember to buy the book ? 
 When will you buy it then ? 
 May I help you ? 
 What size do you wear ? These shoes are on sale . 
 Of course , yes . They look nice . And they're not expensive . 
 They are $ 168 . 
 Will you give your friends a buzz and put out a feeler to see if they like to offer me a loan ? 
 I just want to make sure that there is possibility of giving us a loan . 
 I want to say goodbye to everyone . 
 I ’ m catching the 9 fifteen train tomorrow morning . 
 You really don ’ t need to . 
 I hope so , too . Thank you , Lily . Thank you for everything . 
 Please say goodbye to the rest of the family for me . 
 Thank you . Remember to look me up if you ’ re ever in Washington . 
 Goodbye , then . Thanks again for everything . 
 Watch his bread , it seems to be delicious . He had a lot on the ball . 
 Oh , hi , Jessica , are you going to see this movie too ? 
 Then let's go in . 
 I'll say the movie's starting in the minute . 
 Looks like he won't show up . He's done this before , hasn't he ? 
 What's he trying to pull anyway . 
 Maybe you should start seeing someone else . 
 Peter , why don't you go outside and play basketball with your friends ? 
 I just can't understand why you want to stay at home . It is such a wonderful day today . 
 Didn't you just finish watching a basketball game on TV ? 
 Oh , Peter . You really should go and play ball yourself rather than watching games . 
 You really shouldn't watch so much television . 
 Ohm , hello , Marcia . I was ... 
 Well ... thanks , Marcia.It ' s very nice of you to say so . I mean ... 
 Do you really think so ? I mean , was I ? Er ... you ... must be disappointed . 
 That's a relief for me and a misery for the children . 
 It's too late . 
 He does , he started five years ago and now ends up the richest among us . 
 It seemed to be useless to study well when we were young if we examine his case . 
 Well , that's an hour's ride.Why not just post your mail here . 
 I see . 
 Yes , the bus doesn ’ t go there directly.You have to take the No . 26 bus for five stops and then change to a No . 16 bus and get off at the third stop.When you get off , you can see the bank . 
 It ’ s about an hour . 
 Not at all . 
 Good afternoon . Lilian . This is Tom Baker over at Beck ’ s Trading company . We need to arrange a banquet for next Wednesday afternoon . 
 Well . We ’ re expecting about twenty-five people and we ’ d like to spend no more than $ 20 a head . 
 You haven't heard about it ? 
 This truck flipped over on the 210 . 
 I'm telling you the truth . 
 Two people were injured . 
 I think so . 
 Yes , they were lucky . 
 I'm in the mood for some chips and salsa . 
 And they have tangy , freshly-made salsa , too . My mouth is watering already ! 
 Surprise me . 
 Nothing particular . But , ... 
 I , I don't know how to explain it to you . 
 Yes , of course . But I'm afraid I can't tell you . 
 Have you settled the bill ? 
 OK , 400 Yuan please . 
 No , but we still stay in touch . 
 We contact through email . 
 Your words sound a bit reasonable . But don ’ t forget the time difference . 
 Carrie , I want to buy a pair of leather shoes to wear for the interview tomorrow . 
 Good idea . Let's go . Where should we go ? 
 Have you seen the new girl in school ? 
 She's really pretty . 
 She's not too tall . 
 She's about 5 feet even . 
 She has pretty light brown eyes . 
 So you have seen her around ? 
 Hmm , what should I wear today ? 
 Well , haven't you ever heard people say that there is always one piece of clothes missing from a woman's wardrobe ? 
 Loving to look beautiful is women's nature . In fact , I am thinking about going to my favorite clothing shop today . 
 Well , I need to change the shoes I bought from Nasi . They are too small . I want to ask them whether they come in a larger size . 
 Hi , again . Can I get you some more fruit ? 
 OK . I'll go then . 
 If you give me your credit card , I can take care of it for you . 
 I am the manager.Can I help you ? 
 All right.Take a seat , please.Would you like to be a shop assistant or a cashier ? 
 So now do you want a full-time job or part-time job ? 
 Now we really need some part-time workers.You see , our full-time staff knocks off at five pm , but now we hope to extend the hours to eight pm.We need some part-time shop assistants to work 3 hours a day from five pm to eight pm.But I am not sure if you are qualified for the job.Since most of our customers are foreign , competence of good communication in English is necessary here . 
 That is fine . I think you have the qualifications needed for the job , so I will let you have the job.Does the work schedule suit you ? 
 Good.There is only thing to be settled.Ten RIB an hour is the maximum we can pay you.Is the rate of pay acceptable to you ? 
 Sure.You will get more if you can invite more customers with your good service . 
 That is good of you to say so.When can you start working ? 
 Ok.Let ' s make is next Monday . I n the end , you need to fill out the application form . 
 Let me suggest this one . It's an excellent watch , it looks good , and it's only $ 100 . 
 Uh , no . Analog watches don't come with stopwatches . You'll have to get a digital if you want a stopwatch . 
 Right here . 
 Yes . Make it out to Time After Time . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , what kind of room do you want ? 
 Sorry , right now we can only have you a room without shower . 
 Wake up sleepyhead.The sun is beginning to shine . What a lovely summer day ! 
 It's not that hot . It's cooler than yesterday . Let's go swimming ! 
 Yeah , sounds like fun . I can wear my new pink bikini . 
 Who cares ! Well , the smart guys get there early . That's the kind of guy I want to meet . Let's go ! 
 Ok , you could borrow one of mine . 
 No problem . Here it is . 
 no , I can handle it . Thanks anyway . 
 well , maybe just a little . I can't seem to make it fit . 
 that's so true . thanks for your help . Are you in the aisle seat in this row ? 
 I'm in the middle seat . 
 thanks . sorry for making you get out of your seat again . 
 no , not at all . Which one would you like--the New York Times or the Guardian ? 
 I was just going to do a little Sudoku while we wait for the plane to take off , so the Guardian is all yours . 
 that would be great . thanks . 
 Good afternoon , I'm looking for Mr . Alert Li . 
 Sure . This is Nigel Smith his personal banker . Could you ask him to return my call ? 
 It's 2781703 1 . 
 Thanks so much , bye . 
 Well , it'll take three weeks to demolish the old building and clear away the debris . We should be ready to start the construction work in week 23 . 
 About ten weeks in total if everything goes according to plan . 
 What's going on ? 
 I'm throwing a party next Saturday . 
 Yeah , are you going to come ? 
 Why not ? 
 Well , why don't you ? 
 Well , that's okay . 
 What would you like to eat ? 
 How about something to drink ? 
 OK . I'll see if I can get waited on . 
 Next Saturday ? I ’ m sorry . I ’ Ve promised to go to a Chinese Opera with my daughter . 
 Yes , Sunday sounds fine . What time ? 
 It suits us fine . We ’ ll see you then . 
 Post office offer lots of services nowadays , don ’ t they ? Years age , you only really used the post office to send mail , save money , and send or collect money . 
 I save money in a post office saving account . There used to be just one kind of account , but now there are several . They each have different conditions and interest rates . 
 Post offices are still the place to go to collect welfare benefits , like unemployment benefit and child support benefit . The queue are very long on the days when people collect those payment . 
 Do you think that the service at post offices has improved ? 
 I like being able to buy newspapers and magazines at the post office . It means that I don ’ t need to go to two places 
 Grand Central Station , please . I want to catch a 6 p . m . train . 
 Here is the Grand Central Station . 
 The meter reads 9.15 dollars . 
 Thank you . 
 Well , it's Thursday today . 
 The 5th . 
 I am seven . 
 Yes , I am seven . I am a big girl now . 
 Yes , come on , and we will have fun . 
 As long as it doesn't take too long . 
 Was he upset when you told him you had to leave this weekend ? 
 So what's the problem ? 
 In total , it should be about $ 5,000 for the week conference . Would you like to see the breakdown ? 
 First we have the airline tickets , which are $ 500 per person ; with four of us going , that's t $ 2,000 . For our accommodations , we're spending $ 80 a night , per room , for five days . That's another $ 800 . 
 I have two people to a room . The $ 80 room rate is the lowest I could find . With the conference going on that week , all the hotels have inflated their prices , they're making a killing . 
 I have budget $ 25 per Peron per day for food expenses . That totals another $ 800 . And for other incidentals , like take fees , and tips , I have estimated about $ 400 . 
 That's my buffer ... I wanted to leave a little room in the budget , just in case---it's better to be safe than sorry . 
 Raise the alarm by breaking the glass of the nearest fire alarm . Call Security , say ' Fire ' and give your name and exact location . At night you should phone the fire service from the nearest telephone . 
 If you discover a small fire , you can try to put it out with a fire extinguisher but only do this if you have been trained . Make sure you use the right extinguisher . They are all colour-coded and contain different substances to put out the fire . 
 Is that right ? I didn't know it . 
 Will you forgive me ? Could you return my camera ? 
 Oh , I see.Then can I buy slides and picture postcards somewhere ? 
 Hi , my name is Tom . 
 Nice to meet you too.Melinda . 
 Really ? This is a nice office , but it's quite small . 
 It looks like you guys work hard . 
 Hmm ... Tell me more details about our jobs . 
 Would you like to go sightseeing tomorrow ? 
 What would you like to see in Beijing ? 
 I'll pick you up here tomorrow . 
 Sure . First you pick up the receiver and hit one of the first 3 buttons . Do you hear a tone ? 
 OK . Now you dial 9 on the keypad . Do you hear the tone change ? 
 Well , when you hear it change , that means you have an outside line . Where are you trying to call ? 
 OK . Well , to dial to the outside you just now dial the number . For a call inside the company just hit the extension number . Do you know the extensions ? 
 Well , if you ever need help with an extension , you can dial O . 
 I'm not sure I can't agree , dan 
 Surely , there are other ways to save money . 
 I hear you're being sent to Madrid for the annual conference . Is that right ? 
 Are you serious ? You haven't even been anywhere on vacation ? 
 Well , being able to go to the conference sounds like such a great opportunity . Have you applied at the embassy for a visa yet ? 
 You leave next Tuesday , right ? What time is your flight ? 
 If your flight is leaving so early , I can take you to the airport and see you off . I'll still be able to make it into the office by 9 . 
 Excuse me , would you mind changing seats with me ? 
 Thank you . That's very kind of you . 
 What are you doing now , Steven ? 
 Oh , my God . Do you want to be a millionaire ? I can see you are very crazy about money . 
 No , you are wrong . Money can't buy happiness and health . I won't sacrifice my health in order to get money . In other words , I don't want to be a millionaire and I want to have more free time to enjoy life . 
 Maybe you are right . Please take care of yourself when you make money . Anyway health is the most important thing . 
 No thanks . 
 It's a really useful piece of equipment . It's for smoothing rough edges . Here let me show you how it works . It's very simple to operate . 
 $ 60 . 
 Yes , the shoes on that shelf are on sale now . They are much cheaper . 
 It's about 14 hours . We are supposed to land there at 19:00 . 
 Of course . We are already out of our motherland . 
 No problem . What are you looking for ? 
 Yes , your laptop is on the chair . 
 Which one ? 
 It's under the table . 
 There's a pencil in front of the lamp . 
 Oh , sorry . There is a pencil behind the cup . 
 It's in between the wall and the bed . 
 They're on the left side of the TV . 
 Sorry , I made a mistake . They're on the right side of the TV . 
 Oh , and here are your glasses . They were next to your cell phone . 
 Generally speaking , Mark's personality is much more agreeable than Jones 
 Possibly . 
 I am sorry , but I can't lend it to you now , for I haven't finished reading it . If you don't mind , I can lend you some back numbers to you . 
 No , it is a fortnightly . So , you see , I can get the new one quite soon . 
 This dress is beautiful . May I try it on ? 
 What is the material of this dress ? 
 That's good . Can you give me a reduction ? 
 Do you have any cheaper ones ? 
 Mr . Smith , I have been doing some industry research and was shocked to learn that the average salary for a position that is similar to mine pays on average $ 2,000 more per year than I am c 
 First and secondary research . I hope that you can address this concern immediately as i find it very disturbing . 
 I wish the same . As such , I hope you will seriously consider a pay increase . 
 Hi , Mary , can I have a minute ? 
 Well , actually I want to tell you that I've put in notice . 
 Many reasons . I've been here for too long . Next year will be my five-year anniversary . I want a change of setting . Besides , our company is downsizing . I don't want to stay on just to be let go . 
 Maybe . But that's not kept the new boss from breathing down my neck . To be honest , I've got a better offer from another company . 
 Senior director of market research . In addition to a nice pay rise it has some nice perks , like a company car , one month paid vacation , and an apartment downtown . And it's an international company so I'll have lots of chances to travel and meet new people . I'm really looking forward to it . 
 Indeed . But let's stay in touch . I'll let you know how things go . 
 Could you show me how to operate this fax machine ? I am going to receive some urgent fax from a company . 
 That's right . 
 I couldn't agree more . 
 What can I do next ? 
 Look . Some of the faxes come through blurred . What is wrong with it ? 
 Hi Michael . 
 I'm looking for the airport . Can you tell me how to get there ? 
 I think I can take the subway to the airport . Do you know where the subway is ? 
 Where ? I don't see it . 
 Oh , I see it now . Thanks . 
 Do you know if there's a restroom around here ? 
 Thank you . 
 Hi , Mary , it ’ s been a long time 
 Well , I ’ m doing okay . And how about yourself ? 
 Oh . I ’ m sorry to hear that . What happened ? 
 I think so too . It's just pointless . 
 I don't know.Maybe they are really crazy . 
 You're late . 
 My phone ? 
 Really ? I had no idea . Let me check.Yes , it's dead . There's no dial tone . 
 But this is terrible . I'm expecting important calls . 
 You know what.The theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play.They are supposed to call me this evening.If I don't have a phone . Oh , what can I do ? 
 Do you have a cell phone ? 
 Can you drive me ? I will go to Ann's house . It isn't far . I can call the theater guild from there and give them her number.She will let us wait in her living room . 
 Yes , I do.At Ann's house I will call the phone company and have them check my line.If they can fix it right away without coming to my house , then we'll just return here.But if not , I need to wait at Ann's house to talk with the theater guild.It ' s very important to me . 
 Yes , let's go . 
 Because that company's behavior is not in accordance with international law . 
 I would like to return some books . 
 Here you go . 
 Yeah . I totally forgot they were due . 
 How much are the late fees ? 
 I have to pay 25 cents a day ? 
 That shouldn ’ t be a problem . 
 Yes , thank you . I ’ Ve already been helping myself . 
 I like hot food , especially Sichuan cuisine . 
 I'II have another cup of beer insist . I know I don't like to drink alone , especially there are someone sitting there next to me . 
 Bottom's up , and you're right . This meal is incredible . I wish I had known this restaurant before . Thanks for bringing me here . I know I'll be back soon . 
 Yes , I'm calling from Tenga Company . I'd like to know if you have rooms available for the nights from October 8 to October 12 . We are going to have a business conference . 
 20 persons . 
 Double rooms with twin beds . 
 Thank you . Is there a special rate for a group reservation ? 
 That is fine . 
 It ’ s nice to meet you , too , Ms . Green . This company seems so big right now ; I don ’ t know how I ’ ll ever get used to it . 
 Great – That ’ ll be big help , Ms . Green . 
 No ! 
 Last time I lent you money , you never paid me back . 
 Ok , but I'm taking your skateboard as collateral . 
 It's nothing personal , just business . 
 How long have you had it ? 
 I think you've got the flu . There's a lot of it about . 
 Take some medicine and stay in bed for a day or two . 
 I am afraid not . I haven't worked in an American company so far . 
 The first is accounting entity , and the second is going concern . The third is measuring unit . The fourth is accounting period , and the fifth is objectivity . 
 The Scholar ? Let me see . Oh ... yes , Of course I know . It ’ s in the Lincoln Square . 
 Oh , yes . It ’ s just a few minutes walk . Turn left at the traffic light , and you ’ ll see it . 
 Hello Bill , what's new ? 
 I'm glad to hear it . 
 Why do you change your job and apply for a translator ? 
 What do you think are the capacities for a success as a translator ? 
 Where do you work ? 
 Are you a doctor ? 
 How are you today ? 
 Do you need help with something ? 
 What account would you like to transfer the money from ? 
 Where do you want the money to go to ? 
 How much money are you going to transfer today ? 
 Is that all I can do for you today ? 
 Can I order something from the kitchen ? 
 A bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare would hit the spot . 
 Sure ! Right now , I would even eat hamburger ! 
 Thank you , but I just finished eating some chocolate-covered cherries . 
 Not a problem . 
 Do you have a minute ? 
 Have you been in America long , Hellen ? 
 Where are you going to study ? 
 What are you going to major in ? 
 For nearly four years . 
 Bob , I'm really upset with you . 
 You forgot it last year as well . 
 So , are we all behind this new project ? 
 Ditto , it doesn't look too expensive either . 
 I can't see a problem . Let's give it a try . 
 oh , it is really far from here . You ’ re going in the wrong direction actually . 
 it doesn ’ t matter . Go back the way you came . After about five kilometers , you ’ ll see a hotel on the side of the road . It ’ s a big one . You can ’ t miss it . 
 take the next right . Drive about one click further , and you ’ ll see the entrance of the highway to the Great Wall . 
 you ’ re welcome . 
 without traffic , it takes about an hour . 
 yes , I think so . It doesn ’ t close until 5 o ’ clock . You still have plenty of time . 
 my pleasure , and have a good time ! 
 Yes , I am . I always make a plan before I do anything . 
 I don't want to have a specific title . I just want to enjoy what I am doing . 
 It's the most important thing to me . 
 That obviously depends on how things go - - whether I'm suited to the firm and the firm to me . 
 I want to put my knowledge and experience to use in a challenging position . In order to achieve this goal , I just want to work step by step . 
 I haven't thought it over at all . 
 I think the most important thing is the interest in the job . 
 Take care ! I will miss you so much . 
 You can renew the books over the computer . 
 Mandy , Would you like to come for dinner tonight ? 
 At the new Five Spices restaurant in Chaoyang . 
 It ’ s Asian fusion . I heard it ’ s delicious . 
 I hate to be the bearer of bad news , but it's that time of year again . Have you got your performance evaluations finished yet ? 
 Well , you do still have three weeks . But remember the employee must sign them , too . Filling them in is nothing - it's meetingwith the employees that takes so much time . 
 So it's the subjective criteria like team building and colleague support that you find hard ? 
 I suggest letting each employee fill out his or her own evaluation for those items . Then , based on their self - assessment , you can add your comments . It's a great starting point for discussion 
 Hello there . Is there anything I can help you with ? 
 Which company are you from ? I'll check your details . 
 Ah , yes . Mr Can , isn't it ? Yes , the money has been transferred successfully . But you'll need to change it into RIB before you can have it . 
 You have an account with us , right ? If so , there shouldn't be any problem . 
 Who is the author ? 
 Sorry , we ' re sold out right now.Please come back next week . 
 What happened to my cup ? 
 Don't worry about it . I've got another one I can use . 
 I am Looking for a T-shirt . 
 What kind of material is this ? 
 Can I try it on ? 
 I assure you , that's not a problem . What is your full name , please ? 
 It's a pleasure to assist you . Please tell me when you'll be needing the room , sir . 
 Sir , our room prices are slightly higher than you may have thought . Will that be okay ? 
 Only $ 308 per night , before taxes , of course . 
 Now , as for the room , sir , do you prefer smoking or nonsmoking ? 
 Nonsmoking . Now , sir , does a single queen-size bed meet your approval ? 
 Queen , nonsmoking . Okay , sir , your room is reserved . Now if you'll just give me your phone number . 
 Thank you for making a reservation with us . We look forward to seeing you in April ! 
 What time did he come in last night ? 
 Who was he out with ? 
 But , we just finished eating lunch . 
 I'd strongly recommend that you wait for a while before going swimming . 
 Yes ? 
 Sure he is . Winter swimming does good to health , I hear . 
 Yes , could you please put me in the non-smoking section ? 
 Yes , if any one is available . But not over the wing . 
 It doesn't matter , I will take an aisle seat . 
 Hello , Jack . It ’ s Mary . What are you doing in your office ? 
 Would you like to come and have dinner with us on Friday ? 
 What about Saturday ? 
 Will you come round next Tuesday ? 
 What do you say next Wednesday then ? 
 Okay . Bye . 
 Would you like a piece of birthday cake ? 
 I thought strawberry cake with cream cheese frosting was your favorite ? 
 A diet ? What for ? You are in great shape . 
 Oooo . This sounds serious . 
 Hello . Overseas operator . May I help you ? 
 Your name , please ? 
 Who would you like to talk to ? 
 Is that Mr . Edna Kent ? 
 What number are you calling from , please ? 
 And the number in Japan , please ? 
 Hold the line , please . I'll put your call through . 
 I'm planning a trip to Europe . 
 Well , what's the price of this route ? 
 Hey Mel ! Are you up for some tennis today ? 
 You sound exhausted . Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out ! She can pick the kids up and take them to their after-school activities . She can also help you do some household chores , and run so 
 I think you should definitely consider it ! This way you won ’ t have to juggle such a busy schedule , and you ’ ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings . I can refer you this great 
 Good morning , Sir . Where are you going ? 
 When is your flight ? 
 we are checking in . May I have your ticket and your health certificate and your luggage please . 
 Are you keeping the small bag as carry-on luggage , sir ? 
 You must weigh that as well . 
 Your luggage is two pounds over . I ’ m afraid They'll be in excess luggage charge , Sir . 
 It ’ s ten yuan . 
 This is your luggage check Which You must show when you disembark at your destination and here is your boarding pass and your ticket . 
 Now , please wait until your flight is called . There's about twenty-five minutes to go . 
 There ’ s nothing at all to worry about . Once you are in the air , it ’ s just like sitting at your sitting room . It ’ s going to be a very pleasant flight . 
 Just a minute . 
 Yes , we have . We've had to clean up our production process a lot to meet tough government standards . 
 Well , we've had to cut down the amount of solvents we use and we ’ re not allowed to use lead in our products any more . 
 We try not to because you might have to pay quite a heavy fine . 
 I was worried you would think it was too far to drive . 
 I think if you try some more authentic Chinese food , you might understand how we students from Taiwan suffer . 
 I mean , in Milwaukee there is no good Chinese food.So we miss the food in Taiwan too much.Sometimes we just have to drive down here to Chicago to find something better . 
 Yes , even in the winter . 
 Why not ? I've been craving good food for three weeks now . I'm too sick of hamburgers and pizza ! 
 Don't tease me ! Good food is really important to Chinese ! 
 Yes , all these dishes are different " dim sum " dishes.You can't find this kind of thing except for in a few cities in America . 
 Of course . I will try to buy some things at the Asian grocery down the block too.Then I can do a little cooking in my apartment . 
 No way ! 
 We're going up to the " new " Chinatown for dinner . I already know where we're going to go . 
 No , dim sum is usually eaten around lunch time , or sometimes closer to breakfast.We ' ll try more Taiwanese style up at the " new " Chinatown . 
 No , dim sum is more Cantonese style.But of course you can buy it in Taiwan . 
 I'm a great cook actually . You will see . 
 Thanks for coming over to help . I really appreciate it.First , could you peel the vegetables ? I ’ Ve put them all in the sink and there is a peeler . 
 After you ’ Ve chopped the vegetables , could you fry the meat in a little oil ? Just use a very small amount of oil.Fry the meat until it is cooked , then we will add some spices to flavor it . 
 These ones here.The one on the left is very spicy , so we must be careful about how much we add . 
 Cook it over a high flame , so that it will be ready quickly.Keep stirring the meat around the frying pan.Don ’ t let the meat stick to the bottom of the pan . 
 I ’ m mixing the sauce.It ’ s my speciality . I make it according to my own secret recipe . 
 No , just a super-boy . 
 Yes , because a real man doesn't need Mom to worry about him so much . He can do things by himself . 
 Oh , my poor Danny , sure , you are a man . But you know , running like this in street is very dangerous . 
 Do you remember the rules of road safety ? 
 Walk the sidewalk and please right-hand side . 
 Yes , so you still remember , ah . 
 Excuse me . My name is David Walker . Haven't we met before ? 
 Yes , I do . 
 You won one million yuan in a lottery . What will you say ? 
 I understand . It's too good to be true , isn't it ? 
 Bob ! 
 Fine , just fine.And you ? 
 Guangzhou . I've got a cousin there . 
 yes , it's my new business phone . Do you like it ? 
 yes , it's got wireless Internet access . 
 yes , but I don't really use it that often . Have you ever used it ? 
 yes , I guess I should try to use it . 
 of course it does . Doesn't every new phone include a camera these days ? 
 sure . Here you go . 
 no , why ? 
 oh , yeah . Probably . I don't really know how to use this phone yet . 
 no , it's ok . Check your email first ; I'll check my unbox later . 
 I'm surprised you know so much about it . Where's your phone ? 
 how have you been living without a cell phone for a week ? hasn't it been driving you carry being without a phone ? 
 let's go shopping . You can't depend on public phones in this day and age ! 
 Hi , Jim . 
 He ’ s been sick since he came back from Italy . 
 Yes , Doctor William said that he could come back to work ASAP . 
 Dad , I have to do my homework . 
 Dad , I don't want to talk about it now . 
 I'm sorry , dad . But I would rather stay at school than go to cram school . 
 Sounds like you will be doing some serious cramming till Friday ! 
 Why did you put it off until the last minute ? 
 Maybe you got your plate too full this semester ? You can change that next semester . 
 I'll say . The regular eighteen is just about all I can handle myself . 
 Yes . What about you ? 
 What do you mean you already voted ? 
 Why ’ d you have to do that ? 
 Why is that ? 
 You can always go to work late . 
 Oh , I understand . 
 Make sure that you understand the company . Do you understand what it is that they do ? 
 When you've finished your research it will help you figure out whether your company is rigid in philosophy or kind of more relaxed . Does that make sense ? 
 So all of that information will help you to pick out what to wear . Do you have something to wear ? 
 You know I could go shopping with you sometime if you need it , but can we talk about other basics ? 
 Focus on being relaxed and open , don't forget to smile and shake hands and be genuinely interested in what their company is about . I'm sure you'll do well . 
 Yes , I am , Your Honor . 
 Your Honor , the police officer pulled me over for speeding . 
 No , Your Honor , I was not . 
 I was going 35 in a 40 mph zone . 
 So , I don't have to pay the ticket ? 
 Thank you very much , Your Honor . 
 Don't be scared.Bite the bullet and everything will be right again . 
 How do you celebrate national day in your country ? 
 What kinds of parades are there ? 
 We don ’ t have a national day . 
 I guess it is . Most countries have on , but we don ’ t . 
 What's the matter with you , then ? You look miserable . 
 What do you mean by " us " ? 
 What do you mean ? We ' re talking now , aren't we ? 
 Yes . I remember . But we never used to argue . You used to think I was wonderful . Where are you going ? 
 Let ’ s play a game ! 
 No , no , a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . I ’ m going to describe someone ’ s face , and you guess who it is ! 
 Let ’ s see . He has a roman nose , bushy eyebrows and dimples ! 
 Aunt Rose ! That mole is so huge ! OK , my turn . He has a crooked nose and full lips . He has quite a few freckles and an oval face . Oh , he is also bald ! 
 Not funny . 
 Only once or twice at the most . 
 I have no idea . 
 Chips , finger foods , desserts , baked beans . Where're the pork and beef strips ? 
 Ah ... hence the buns and condiments we bought . And this is Holly's potato salad . 
 Let me know if I can help . 
 That all depends on how the visiting team shapes . 
 But two players of the team have been booked and one is out . 
 I'm sorry I'm late . I overslept . Is the manager here today ? 
 Oh , I hope he didn't notice me . 
 You said it . It won't happen again . Do you really think he'd fire me ? 
 You are probably right . I'll go right now and apologize . I try hard not to be late but it is difficult with Beijing traffic . 
 Do you mind if I ask you a question ? If it ’ s too personal you can forget it . 
 Have you got a scholarship , or are you on your own ? 
 I have a tuition scholarship from the university . Otherwise I ’ m on my own . 
 Oh no . My family supports me . And believe me , changing foreign money into dollars is heart-breaking . You seem to get so little in return . 
 I Don't know how they do it ! Our competitors have undercut us by 10 % percent on the price of our latest model . There is no way will be able to compete against that . We're barely breaking even with the present prices . 
 Profits are almost nonexistent now , we can't beat their price . How do they keep their price so low ? 
 You really think we can make it ? I don't have much faith in our ability to lower the price again . We're no match for them , the competition will beat us hands down . 
 A tough job . They even offer in-service training every Wednesday afternoon . 
 I don't like it . I am not used to this kind of 9 to 5 work hours . Above all , I hate talking to those poker faces everyday . 
 I guess so . I am badly off and I need this job . 
 When pigs fly ! 
 Oh I forgot ! I'll run home real quickly and bring you the money . 
 I'd hate for you to think I was lazy in returning your money . 
 How did he make a fortune ? 
 what's your apartment like ? 
 what is it like living in on-campus housing ? 
 did you have to pay a deposit ? 
 do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent ? 
 how long is your contract for ? 
 have you started looking again yet ? 
 Good luck ! 
 There ’ s a problem with my check . 
 My check for $ 100 bounced . 
 I thought I did . 
 Thank you very much . 
 That can ’ t be right ! 
 All right . Thank you very much . 
 What ’ s stopping you ? 
 I don ’ t understand . 
 I can help you figure it out . 
 Slide your card into the machine . 
 You need to type your PIN in . 
 Click on whichever option you want , and you ’ re done . 
 Sure , what would you like ? 
 Why don ’ t you have a water or juice instead , so you don ’ t get dehydrated ? 
 Hey ! I have a surprise for you . 
 Open this card and read . 
 What separates your product from the competition ? 
 Is the software user-friendly ? 
 Is this training part of the package or will it cost extra ? 
 Are you feeling OK ? 
 What have you been eating ? 
 Maybe the food had something wrong with it . 
 Have you been under a lot of pressure lately ? 
 Perhaps you have caught that bug that is going around . 
 Excuse me , could you tell me the bookshop ’ s address ? 
 Thank you very much.By the way , is the hospital beside the bookshop . 
 Thank you for your help . 
 Food is less expensive in a cafeteria , because you serve yourself . 
 Just pick up a tray , then put a knife , a fork , a spoon and a paper napkin on it and stand in the line . 
 Not long , because people rush for lunch . 
 Tell the man behind the counter what you want . 
 Just point to it if you don't know the name . 
 Did you see that ? 
 How could you miss that ? 
 Daniel , I can't catch up with the English teacher very well . 
 You are quite good at English , can you help me with it . 
 English school ? What is that ? 
 Is that different from our school's English course ? 
 What's the problem ? You don't look happy . 
 How come ? 
 Why don't you go to the English corner to talk to your classmates in English quite often ? 
 You should always keep in mind , the more you practice , the better English you can speak . 
 You know what , I've just got a new job with a computer company . 
 OK , Dead Man . If this doesn't start your engine , nothing will . 
 No , I don't . 
 Uh , are you sure about that ? I thought espresso was an Italian word . 
 Yes , I have been working for eight hours . 
 No , really . I'm not in the mood for it . 
 I can recommend the spare ribs . They are very tasty here . 
 Ok why don ’ t you order the braised fish then ? 
 Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll help you eat it . 
 I am sorry , sir , it's for 4 persons to have . I think it's too large for you . 
 Sorry , sir . We have never done that before . 
 Yes , sir.how can I help you ? 
 You would need to speak to Ms.Stevens . 
 One moment , please , and I will connect your call . 
 Yes . I'm looking for a green dress . 
 I wear size 32 . This one looks nice . Where may I try it on ? 
 How does it look ? 
 How much is it ? 
 I'll take it . 
 I'd like to reserve a double room . I will be arriving next Monday , the 12th . My name is Wilson . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 Three or four days , perhaps longer . 
 Drive me to Kennedy Airport , please ? 
 Where is the next taxi stand ? 
 How are you doing today ? How many in your book today ? 
 Smoking or non ? 
 Right , this way , please . Something to drink first ? 
 Wold you like to see menu first or wait for your friends ? 
 Certainly , sir . If you need anything else , please let me know , and I'll be happy to get it for you right away . 
 Because the job I am doing in my present company is of no challenge , but I like challenge.Your firm is a young organisation with many innovative ideas . It has been very successful in an expanding market since its establishment 10 years ago . Working for you would be exactly the sort of challenge I am looking for . 
 I have excellent communication skills and I am familiar with the procedures for the last company I worked for . Besides , I am a team player and have great interpersonal skills . 
 Alright , sir . You are making a good choice . Honda has made a lot of design improvements in the new Accord . 
 On all our new cars , the standards include 
 Why not , sir ? 
 Well , sir , I know some of our customers are concerned about cruise control . But Honda has never had a single cruise control malfunction that led to an accident . 
 You know , sir , you don't have to use it . You can turn it on or off . If you don't want to use it , you just never turn it on . 
 No , the sunroof is optional , sir . 
 Welcome ! 
 With ice , sir ? 
 Anything else , sir ? 
 Fruit juice , milk or mineral water ? 
 Coming up immediately . 
 We shouldn't have any trouble if the traffic isn't too heavy . Is this your first trip here ? 
 You haven't seen the sights yet , have you ? 
 Why don't you visit the Great Wall first ? 
 Here we are . That will be seven yuan and seventy cents . 
 What's up ? You look low . 
 How come ? 
 I understand that . But I think maybe it's not a date . You are taking the matter too much to heart . 
 I would like to open an account please . 
 I have my Tennis Club card . Is that good enough ? 
 Oh ... wait a minute ... here ’ s my driver ’ s license . 
 OK , I ’ ll fill out the form and come right back . 
 Yes , this is the Resume Writing Workshop . Welcome ! 
 It ’ s easy . Don ’ t worry about it . 
 Well , the most important thing we need to do is make sure that our name and contact information are across the top . 
 You can either list your job experience next or your education--whichever is the most impressive should be first . 
 Sure , that would be a good place for them . 
 Not at all . I was born in Madrid , but I came to the States when I was a teenager . 
 No , I haven ’ t been back for more than ten years . 
 Good morning . I ’ m looking for a new jacket . 
 I like this jacket . Can I try it on ? 
 Thanks . 
 Don ’ t be intimidated . There is a lot to sign , but I will explain everything to you very clearly . 
 All the papers have been drawn up , but I will need to see your picture ID so we can notarize these papers . 
 We are going to go through these bit by bit . You will have plenty of time to read the fine print . 
 We want you to get any outside help that you need . Do not ever sign documents that you don ’ t understand . 
 When these papers get processed , the house will be yours ! 
 Yeah . We ’ re never going to get to the end of this one . 
 Well , it does have a lot of girls in it . 
 Do you think Bruce Willis just drank a Coke for his health ? 
 Of course . 
 Yeah , Got a Coke ? 
 Hurry , the movie is coming back on . 
 Dress casually . 
 We'd like to take a tour to Florence . 
 We have got a 2 weeks ' vocation and we plan to leave on Thursday . 
 What's wrong , Bob ? 
 Of course , I will . 
 Hello . Can I help you ? 
 I'm afraid it is still being washed . 
 Yes , we can . But you need wait a moment . 
 Yes , it will be ready then . 
 No problem . 
 I want to travel . 
 The seaside . 
 I ’ Ve been to Qingdao before , so I ’ ll choose Dalian . I've heard that the environment there is very good . 
 Thank you ! 
 I don't really feel like a walk . 
 All right.That sounds more interesting . 
 The same to you , Joey . 
 It's very thoughtful of you . Wow , it is so beautiful . Could you tell me how American people celebrate Christmas ? 
 How would you like your hair cut ? 
 Then , I'll just trim it . 
 Are you busy next Saturday ? 
 I need to get a costume for a fancy dress party , and I reply don't know what to get . Will you come shopping with me ? 
 One of the girls in my office . 
 There is no specie occasion . She just likes to organize parties from time to time . This time it is a country theme . 
 Well where am I going to get that sort of costume ? 
 Oh good . 
 We'll get a big bonus this year , won't we ? 
 Welcome , what would you like to order ? 
 Would you like everything on it ? 
 Do you want any fries ? 
 Can I get you anything to drink ? 
 Is that everything ? 
 You're welcome , and your total is $ 5.48 . 
 Are you all right ? 
 Don't worry.He is an acrobat 。 
 Let's begin by having you tell me about yourself and your background . 
 What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession ? 
 Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description ? 
 Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome . 
 What are your strengths and weaknesses ? 
 Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss . 
 When do you find a job satisfying ? 
 How would your coworkers describe you ? 
 Do you have any questions ? 
 Why are you going out with Andy ? 
 Me , too . I think he ’ s really a shoulder to cry on . 
 I have 10 years financial industry experience , working for several companies . For the past two years , I have been working in an investment banking . In addition to my analytical mindset , I have a background of solid accounting principles . I am a team player and have great communication and interpersonal skills . I thrive on challenge and work well in high-stress environments . 
 My background and experience include working on a variety of projects and jobs in the financial industry . Most of my experience has been behind the scenes , doing the calculations . I want to work with clients and continue to grow and be challenged . 
 I'm not finding the work as challenging as I used to . I want to find a job that is stimulating , where I can grow . 
 One of my strengths is my ability to be flexible . I've seen companies go through many changes in structure and management philosophy . I've had to adjust my style to the new environment several times . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But by being aware of my tendency to overwork , I have learned to pace myself more and work less overtime . 
 She'd say I have a lot of initiative , I see the big picture and I do what has to be done . Second , I always meet deadlines . If I say I'm going to do something , I do it . Lastly , I have the ability to focus on what I'm working on I am not easily distracted . 
 I'm sure whatever you offer will be a fair amount for a person with my qualifications . Salary is not the most important factor to me . I'm looking for opportunity . 
 Yes , I do . What do you see as the future trends for the industry ? 
 I don't know . I just woke up . 
 Okay . It looks like rain . 
 The sky is gray . 
 No . 
 The street isn't wet . 
 You'd better take an umbrella . 
 Yes , it is . Hi , Tom ! It's a real surprise to see you here . 
 Nothing much . What about you ? Is everything going well ? 
 How was it ? 
 Sorry , I've got a meeting in half an hour . 
 Great ! It's good to see you . Goodbye ! 
 Give me your email , would you ? 
 Good afternoon , anything I can do for you ? 
 Well , we have some nice sugar . 
 Sure , follow me . 
 Yeah , I'm going to be making phone calls all day . What a blast . 
 Save it , Vince . After I put my first million in the bank , I'll say you're welcome . 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 I'm sorry , sir . But this is the self-service pump . 
 Yes . You must fill up the car yourself . 
 Yes . Are you traveling here ? 
 In America , most gas stations are like this . 
 Well , since this is your first time , I will do it for you.But next time , if you want a full-service gas station , you should look at the sign . 
 Under the sign for the gas station , there will be a smaller sign that says Self-Serve or Full-Service.And some gas stations have both.But if they have both , some pumps will be self-serve and some will be full-serve.You have to look at the signs . 
 Why don't you go out with Jack ? 
 Excuse me , but is this dress on sale ? 
 Are you sure ? I'd be happy to pay the sale price today . 
 OK , I'll just check out a few other stores . 
 Ladies and gentlemen , welcome to tonight's fashion show . 
 How very appropriate , because tonight we have a most dazzling show for you ! 
 Some of tonight's highlights are dressed in the latest straight from Shanghai . 
 So , sit back and relax and get your order forms ready . 
 What sights are included on the tour ? Is the entire time spent in Paris ? 
 Can you fax a copy of the tour itinerary to me ? 
 It's 212-331-7600 . 
 May I help you at all ? 
 We certainly do . I can give you some details about a loan called Personal Loan for Studying Abroad . We offer this to anyone who will study outside this country . 
 This loan is specially provided for people who are studying overseas to pay for their tuition fee and other sundry items . 
 That's right . The sundries could include accommodation , text books and so on . The guidelines are not so strict , you see . 
 What are you thinking ? 
 It ’ s about 7 o ’ clock . let ’ s have our breakfast first . 
 What do you want ? 
 Sorry , I didn ’ t prepare this . 
 Ok , I ’ ll have it sent to you immediately . 
 I know only too well what that's like . 
 I was very sad when I was laid off last year . 
 yes , I experienced one when I was in Tokyo once . The tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over . 
 I don't remember , but it wasn't very serious . Have you ever been in an earthquake ? 
 where are you from ? 
 did your house ever get damaged from the winds ? 
 wow , that must have really been scary . 
 have you ever experiences a flood ? 
 that sure didn't last long ! 
 Are you working fewer hours than you used to work ? 
 You usually qualify if you got laid off or are working a lot fewer hours . 
 Most jobs provide unemployment , but some don ’ t . 
 You can call your unemployment office , and they can check for you . 
 There is a formula to determine the amount based on how much you earned . They will let you know when you file your claim . 
 My coach wants you to check my blood pressure . 
 I don ’ t have any symptoms of high blood pressure . 
 What test do you do for high blood pressure ? 
 When you get the reading , what information does it give you ? 
 I am hoping that this test goes well for me . 
 cool down , Harry ! What are you really mad about ? Did you get ripped off ? 
 is that so ? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . It's the norm of free trade . The seller sets 
 of course , that's something really irritation . And the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . I recommend you to consult the price tags in the superb 
 Oh , thank you . What is the occasion ? 
 Oh , yes , I'd very much like to go . 
 I'll be there in time . 
 Bye . 
 It's my favorite . 
 I like Indian food as well . 
 What does it say ? 
 Thank you . But I don't think I'll bother . 
 I don't think I'll have any trouble with getting old . But perhaps you can keep the article for a while , I may read it later . 
 I'm ready when you are , sir . 
 You are so right , sir . The clock just struck nine . 
 Sir , right here we have a storage site . Its only $ 5 an hour , but you need to leave a deposit . 
 I'm sorry , sir , but it isn't . Your MasterCard or VISA will take care of things nicely . 
 Okay , sir . But don't take too long . You only have 30 minutes . 
 Yes , that is why I never drink it . 
 Very seldom , because tea has tannin which may be harmful to one's health . 
 What good is it for ? 
 That's true , but it must not be allowed to stand long . 
 Because if you drink a kind of tea which has been prepared for some time before , it will do you harm . 
 Yes , Mr . Miller . We'll use the conference room on the third floor for the meeting . 
 In the dining room . It's spacious there . 
 I've arranged for an interpreter to be present . But it is said these foreigners could speak English . 
 We've prepared name cards to be put on the conference table for guests to sit by . What time would you like refreshments served , Mr . Miller ? 
 All right , I see . 
 What do you do with it ? 
 Okay . 
 OK . 
 Hey ! 
 Got it . 
 Not completely . Our production process is partially-automated . We use robots on the production line for routine assembly jobs but some of the work is still done manually . 
 Well , the parts are automatically selected from the store room using a bar-code system . And there is an automatic feeder which takes them to the conveyor belt at the start of the production line . 
 They're transported to the workstations on automated vehicles - robot trucks - which run on guide rails around the factory . 
 why ? Did tom pop the question ? 
 let me guess , your parents want you to marry a Chinese man , right ? 
 I used to have the same problem when I was with my ex . 
 I just let it go and continued dating with my Korean boyfriend . But finally we broke up . 
 simple . We had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences . 
 he hoped to live in the Korean way and asked me to give up working and stay at home to take care of the family . 
 yes , he said it would be batter for me and for the whole family . But I simply can not quit working . 
 not really . There are many successful mixed marriage around us . 
 It is a new film , ' Transformer ' . 
 I expected too high from that movie , but I was a bit disappointed about it . 
 Box office can't explain everything . I do not think it is cheerful or well-made . The plot is old and the female character is not pretty . 
 What's it about ? 
 I prefer the tragedy . It is moving and makes me ponder about my life . 
 We can buy the popcorn before entering the cinema . 
 Sure , I think that would be possible . Where is the fundraiser ? 
 Would you need it for both Saturday and Sunday ? 
 I think that would be OK . Who will be driving it ? 
 Could you drop it off on Sunday night ? 
 Yes , that would be fine . Just make sure that everything is returned by Sunday night . 
 Yeah , this one closes at ten . We could drive to the 24 - hour store on sixth . 
 I wish the store close to us was open 24 - house a day . 
 Yeah , and the prices there are very high . 
 You should draw a picture of a fancy kingdom of animals in forty minutes . 
 Just imagine , if a horse can fly , if a bird can swim ... and things like that . 
 OK . Here you are . Anybody who wants help , please come to me . 
 I heard that Kevin got divorced . Is that true ? 
 What ? 
 Poor Kevin , we should do something for him . He is a nice guy and does his job well . 
 Oh . It looks like Jack is going to make his annual speech . 
 Yeah . I'm still hungry , but I guess it's kind of rude to keep eating while he's talking , huh ? 
 No . He's so far away I can hardly see him ! Let's keep eating ! 
 All that's left is a leg . I gave the head to Tim ! 
 No , I'm not . 
 I was just robbed ! 
 Someone just robbed me . 
 He took all my things , but he didn't hurt me . 
 I need to make a statement at the police station . 
 Thanks . 
 I'd like to buy a tapestry to decorate my new room . 
 These are beautiful ! Is this the marvelous landscape in Guiling ? 
 How fine the needlework is ! What's the price ? 
 It's too expensive . 
 You're right . Would you please show me some embroidery ? I also want to buy some embroidered tablecloths to match the tapestry . 
 Hi , I am afraid that the fax machine in my room won ’ t be working till tomorrow . A technician has just come and checked it . He will bring me a new one tomorrow . It seems there is a big problem with mine and it will take some days for repairing . Can I use the one in your office ? 
 Yes , I think you have the same model as I have . Does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ? 
 What do you think we need to do to get our new branch office running well ? 
 That ’ s very important . A friend recommended a good law firm to me . We ’ ll need someone to hire staff . 
 Yes . We have . We chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD . 
 The offices there were too expensive . Have we negotiated any contracts yet ? 
 When will the branch office open ? 
 Has and advertising campaign been prepared ? 
 I made plenty of business contract on my last visit and through the embassy . We should be able to get plenty of customers . 
 The nearest one is about ten minutes ' walk from here . 
 just walk down this road and you'll find it . it's on the right side . 
 Your results are posted on the website . Just put in your password and you can see the exact numbers . 
 We always contact you by phone to come in if there is a need for follow-up . 
 The purpose of each test is given on the site . 
 The website will give you your results and then tell you what the normal range is . 
 Yes , you can see every test for the past five years . You can compare them . 
 Yes , of course . There are various forms of travel . 
 There is no need . We have the tour everyday . 
 I am sorry , sir . All the tables have been booked . 
 Would you mind waiting in the lounge for 10 minutes ? I am sure I can arrange you a table then . 
 My word , you do look ill ! 
 You seem to have something on mind . Promise me , go to see the doctor right now . 
 A piece of cake . You'll be successful . 
 It's called ' Endless Love ' . It was a gift from a sister city in Australia for the 100th anniversary of the city . 
 Just two months ago . There were very big celebrations and there was a spectacular fireworks display . I took part in the great parade myself . 
 Yes . We all loved the celebration of our city's birthday . It made the people feel so proud of our city . 
 Yes , I have a spare room . 
 Would you come here in twenty minutes ? We're right in the middle of dinner . 
 Yes , it has two bedrooms . That's convenient . 
 2,500 yuan a month . 
 Good afternoon , sir . May I help you ? 
 Would you like anything to drink with that ? 
 Will that be all ? 
 For here or to go ? 
 That'll be $ 4.25 ... ( The customer gives her a 5 dollar bill . ) ... out of five . Here is your change , sir . Have a nice day . 
 Tian'anmen Square . 
 How long will it take ? We are in a great hurry . 
 Hope there is no traffic jam . 
 Could you drop us off on that corner ? 
 How much do we owe you ? 
 Here is ten yuan . Keep the change , please . 
 Thanks and you too . 
 Goofed off ? Maybe , but I'm not a clock-watcher . I finished doing what I should do and then knock off an hour earlier . 
 I'm sure of what I'm doing . 
 Can you please tell me where you are located ? 
 Thank you , I know where that is . 
 I ’ m Liu Yi . I ’ d like to speak to Mr . Smith . 
 I ’ d like to speak with Mr . Robert Smith . 
 Good morning , Mr . Smith . 
 It is 9 o'clock now . 
 You have two meetings today . One is at 10 am , and the other is at 2 pm . After the meeting , you will have dinner with Mr . Brown at the Chinese restaurant in Sister Hotel . 
 No problem . Do you need the OHP ? 
 OK . Do you want to ask the receptionist to wait for our customers at the receptionist counter before the meeting ? 
 Hello , this is Lucy from ABC Company . Is this Monica ? 
 I am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at 2 PM this Thursday afternoon . Please come on time . 
 Oh , you can take the subway , get off at B stop and walk north for several minutes . You will find a building . It will take about 40 minutes in total . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Where to ? 
 Certainly . Let's put the suitcase in the boot . 
 Take it easy . We should be able to make it unless we get caught in a traffic jam . 
 Don't worry . The traffic is smooth . You will be there in time for your flight . 
 What's the problem ? 
 Is there a problem ? 
 I apologize for their tardiness . 
 Again , I do apologize for the inconvenience . 
 Seeing as they were late , that won't be a problem . 
 I'm going to refund your money right now . 
 All right . ... What's the date today , please ? 
 Johnny , you did badly on the test . I think you haven't been studying enough . Am I right ? 
 Well , you'd better start studying harder if you want to pass this class . 
 All right , sir.When are we supposed to be there ? 
 Hello ! I'm sorry to bother you . This is a complimentary fruit tray . Your food will be ready soon . 
 Actually , uh , I made it myself ... 
 Sorry , but I've gotta run . Enjoy your food , and ring the service button if you need anything else ! 
 I would like to book a table for seven thirty o'clock , please . 
 For four people . We'd like a quiet table with a fine view of the river . 
 This is Peter Kaufman . 
 Peter Kaufman , P-E-T-E-R ( Peter ) , K-A-U-F-M-A-N ( Kaufman ) . 
 Bye-bye . 
 Sure , I have to go anyway . But the first place you need to go is immigration office . They ’ ll check your ticket , passport , visa and immunization record book . After that we can go to the baggage claim area . 
 This is my luggage , but it's too heavy . I can't move it . Could you help me get it out of the conveyer belt ? 
 Where shall we go next ? 
 Ok . 
 No , I don't . 
 Sure . 
 Chocolates . 
 No , they are peppermint chocolates . 
 About a 100 and I have had them declared . 
 A visitor . 
 Hello , this is Li Bo speaking . 
 Oh , that is wonderful . Congratulations ! 
 Don't mention it . I think that is because you have right qualifications and nice personality . 
 I agree . 
 Sorry , miss . I'm afraid we don't have any on hand today . 
 Yes , maybe you can come on Friday . 
 I ’ m very fond of you . 
 Why ? You mean a lot to me . 
 What question ? 
 You know that I care for you . I---I ’ m proud of you . 
 I---I don ’ t feel like saying it 
 No . 
 Yes . . . a bit . . . ouch ! 
 Yes , that hurts quite a lot . 
 NO , nothing . 
 Hello , Sir . What can we do for you today ? 
 L / C stands for ' letter of credit ' . This is necessary for trade between two countries . A Letter of Credit is quite literally that — a letter addressed by the buyer's bank to the seller's bank stating that they could vouch for their good customer , the buyer , and that they would pay the seller in case of the buyer's default . Nowadays , it's sometimes used for domestic trade too . 
 What do you like for dessert ? 
 Yes . 
 OK . I will bring it for you . 
 Oh , yes . I got so tired . My son began to cry the moment we got on the train . It was very embarrassing because we took the over-night train and the noise made it difficult for other people in the cabin to sleep . 
 Yes , we did . Fortunately we put his Teddy Bear in the bag , and finally he fell asleep at mid-night with it in his arms . 
 My wife didn't like to go to amusement parks , so we compromised and finally went to the seaside . I think vacation in summer is not good . 
 Yes , he was every excited to see the blue sea and picked up many seashells to give as gift for his classmates in kindergarten . 
 And I taught him how to swim in the sea . It was fun and made him braver than before . After we returned home , he wasn't afraid to sleep alone in his bedroom . 
 His name is Bingo . 
 We're not sure because the neighbour gave him to us after they moved away . 
 Oh yes , he is . When he was a puppy , he liked to chew my father's shoes , but he's okay now . 
 I didn't know you had a cat . When did you get her ? 
 Really ? Why is that ? 
 Bingo could never do that . He stays in the house except when we take him to the park . 
 What are you going to look for ? 
 What store are you going to ? 
 You don't know ? 
 Would you like me to tell you where I got mine . 
 I went to get mine from IKEA . 
 They're not cheap , but neither is their furniture . 
 Oh , Steven , I made a big mistake . 
 I really wish I hadn ’ t done it . 
 I got caught cheating . I feel so ashamed . The teacher saw me and told me I failed . 
 You know my father . If I fail , he'll kill me . I have to do well . 
 I know ... I know ... it's all my fault . I feel awful that I didn ’ t study , and I cheated , and I got caught . 
 Congratulations , Vivian . You won the grand prize , again . 
 You did ? How ? Did you wear red underwear again this year ? 
 Tell me ! Tell me ! What's your secret ? ! 
 What ? ! You did that ? ? ! ! ! 
 New York Times . I read it everyday . 
 It's too biased . I just don't agree with their one-sided reporting . 
 Yes , they have a good reputation for fairness . 
 That ’ s fine ... I need to pick up some stationary-you know , a stapler , scissors , files , who should I see about that ? 
 Thanks . I need to make a few photocopies . 
 Do you enjoy working in this office ? 
 What ’ s usually discussed at the department meetings ? 
 Hello . Do you know how I can find a room to rent ? 
 Will that work ? 
 Good idea . Thank you . 
 If that's what you want to do , then we can . 
 I'm buckled up . What's next ? 
 What do you want me to do ? 
 How far should I go ? 
 Tell me before you want me to stop . 
 Thanks . Let's go driving again tomorrow . 
 Okay . 
 I'm sorry , madam , there ’ s a limit to the speed . 
 I'm sorry about that . What ’ s your flight time ? 
 Don ’ t worry , madam . I guess we should get there not later than 1:30 p . m . 
 Here we are . 
 Just a minute . Here's your change . 
 My pleasure . You're a sweet couple . Do you have any questions ? 
 No , it doesn't . And there's a maintenance fee for each month . It's forty NT per ping . 
 Yes , but that doesn't include cable . It's for cleaning and trash removal . You just leave your trash outside your door . 
 Yes , I am . That's why I make plans before I do anything . 
 I want to make more contact with extra clients and use my organizational skills in the future . 
 Hello Wang . I'm Dou . Pleased to meet you . 
 Just call me Miao Dou , Please . 
 What's the problem ? 
 Okay , I'll speak to him . 
 I'm feeling a little under the weather . 
 I'm sorry , hold on a moment . I'll check it out . But we have already shipped it to you last month . Would you like us to contact the express company to know what's going on ? 
 Ok , I am terribly sorry for the trouble you are getting into.We will contact you first thing , once we know the reason . 
 Hello , is this 4482098 7 ? I'd like to speak to Mr Doff . 
 May I know when he will be back ? 
 Thanks , Mrs . Doff . Please tell him to be at the airport at three p . m . 
 This is Lucy White . Thank you . Bye . 
 I can't believe my eyes , Bill . Are you having a salad for lunch ? No hamburger ? 
 I know . But why are you suddenly interested in lessening your salt intake ? 
 Do you have hypertension ? I would have thought you were too young . 
 Well , I'm glad you're starting to pay more attention to your diet . 
 So do I . That's why I've been trying to lower my cholesterol level . 
 That's right . I could stand to lose a few pounds , too . 
 We're glad to be able to offer our services to your business , Mrs . Wayne . 
 Almost twenty years . We were the first total PR services company of our kind in California . 
 Well , yes , but now we have six offices in California alone . 
 That's right . We are their sole PR sector business . 
 Not long actually . So I'm sure I will learn a lot from our cooperation . 
 yeah , you know what ? I've been going to the club regularly . The training really pays off . Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit . 
 it's important to do proper exercises . 
 the trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet . 
 we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic . 
 surely it is . Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness . 
 yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . That can help one to keep sound physical health . 
 you bet it ! 
 Come off it . 
 Why not ? 
 This is Mary speaking . 
 Oh , that sounds nice . I ’ d love to . 
 Yeah me too . Oh ! Can we stop at the shop really fast ? I lost my makeup bag at the airport and I want to pick up a few things . 
 No ! Five minutes I promise ! 
 Are you crazy ? You have no idea what you are talking about ! Just for my eyes I have to get eye-liner , an eyelash curler , eye shadow , an eyebrow pencil and mascara . Then I need to get foundation , liq 
 What about you ? You spend as much or more money on your razors , after shave , cologne and gel ! Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and ... 
 When can I see the one-bedroom apartment ? 
 What time does the open house start ? 
 Oh dear , I ’ m late . I have to be in the office by 8am . 
 Well there is an important meeting with a new client . 
 Oh , you don ’ t have to do that but it would be a great help . 
 The government is going to organize a folk-custom activity at the end of the month . And our community is supposed to put on a performance . 
 Stuff like that but I think the lion dance is a bit too difficult and dangerous . 
 Good idea . Shall we get everyone in the community ? 
 I know that they already have a Range Dance team and then what we need is just to do some rehearsals . 
 We can raise money in the community . You know each family 10 yuan maybe . 
 Great idea . There is a travel agency nearby who would love to be our sponsor . It's a perfect chance for them to promote ethnic tourism . 
 It ’ s about an hour ’ s drive . 
 I can ’ t promise , but I ’ ll do my best . 
 I hope so , too.Rose and her husband have been wanting a boy so much . 
 But baby girls are just as good and just as fun as baby boys . 
 That was delicious . 
 Thanks , but I couldn't eat another bite . I'm really full . 
 No , Nancy , today I'm here to make a withdrawal . I made a formal request 7 days ago . 
 That's correct . But before I do , I was wondering if you could give me some advice . 
 Maybe I'm making a big mistake cashing in my Time Deposit before maturity . 
 No , not really . My Current Account is for cash flow and couldn't withstand having all of that money taken from it . 
 You do ? How are you going to contact him ? 
 What does it say ? Do you think he'll see it ? 
 Can I spy on you guys from the window ? 
 Now I understand . But I don't smoke or drink.So what am I supposed to buy in here ? 
 No , I'm sorry . I don't think it is nice to have butterflies mounted in boxes.It is kind of disgusting . 
 Yes . I think they should just let them fly free , and not try to sell them to foreigners . It is a kind of destruction of nature . 
 Who knows ? Hey , I like these jade bears here . 
 This one is 2300 dollars.Maybe I should buy it for my mother . What do you think ? 
 Yes , but she would like this a lot . She likes to collect little things like this . 
 Maybe I could buy some Cognac for my brother . He always drinks it . 
 Stand back from the door , please . There're plenty of seats in the rear . 
 One yuan fifty cents . Drop it in the box here . 
 Take a No . 2 . This is No . 12 . 
 Then this is the right bus . Move on , please . You're holding up the passengers . Tian'anmen Square is the last stop but one . 
 I can't open this email attachment our Paris office has sent me . 
 Well , yes it's definitely the same program but I might have the wrong version . Their system is newer than ours . 
 Waiter , can you come here for a moment ? 
 I'm afraid you've made a mistake . This isn't what I ordered . 
 And also this soup is cold . 
 This looks like a nice restaurant . 
 Let's sit over there . 
 Can you pass me a menu please . 
 I'm going to have a glass of beer . How about you ? 
 Do you want to order an appetizer first ? 
 OK . What are you going to have to eat ? 
 Sure , I've had the steak and the lobster before . They're both very good . 
 I'm not that hungry . I think I'm just going to have a salad . 
 Sure . No problem . 
 What forms must we fill out , Miss ? 
 I see . But why do we have to fill out these forms now ? 
 I ’ m pretty sure that Jim will turn out to be a good lawyer . 
 He knows a lot about law and he ’ s eloquent , too . 
 Ten more minutes , mom . Please ! 
 I bet she will hang around with her mates after school . 
 Good morning . Can I help you ? 
 Do you have an appointment with her ? 
 Okay . What ’ s your name , please ? 
 Thanks . Please sit down . She ’ ll be with you shortly . 
 Hello , Mrs.White ! I'm Anne . 
 Thank you.You ' re so considerate . 
 I have a flat tyre . 
 489 3362 1978 . 
 Eve . 
 It's July 16,2009 . 
 It's on the west street , near Royal Hotel . 
 I was going west . 
 BMW 530 . 
 It's red . 
 SAY 201 . 
 I would like to order some internet today . 
 What kind of internet is there ? 
 Which of those two is best ? 
 So that one better ? 
 What do you mean by that ? 
 So then I can't use my phone if I'm on the internet ? 
 I'm glad these batteries are on sale . 
 But that's what the ad said . 
 Oh . You're right . I misread the ad . 
 Well , you can't blame them . It's a confusing ad . 
 Well , as long as I'm here . 
 What does Human Resources Department do ? 
 They take care of a lot of things . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Yes ? 
 OK . 
 I see . 
 I have a laceration on my left forearm . 
 I got hit by a car in an accident . 
 No , not much . 
 Will I need stitches ? 
 No , not really . 
 Thank you , doctor . Bye . 
 Really ? You are a lucky dog . You know , many girls dream of dating him . 
 Hi , Francis . 
 Not bad . It seems you are super yogurt lover . You have so many in your cart . 
 Oh , I haven ’ t noticed that before . Maybe I will try next time . 
 Thank you . In fact , I am in a hurry . My wife is waiting for me at the parking lot . 
 Me too . Have a great day . 
 really well , thanks . 
 she's not bad . She's a bit bossy , but I'm sure I'll get used to her . 
 she's far better than my old boss . He didn't know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down . 
 they are all pretty easy-going . It's a very friendly place to work . 
 of course . I spent so much time at my old workplace that I got to know them all very well . They were like family to me . 
 sure . Since we work together in teams , we have to get along with each other . 
 yes , it helps everyone to understand what we're doing from different perspectives . 
 I prefer it to working independently . I think most people do . 
 Hello ? 
 Speaking . 
 Hi , Alice.How are you ? 
 I ’ m sorry to hear that.You ’ d better stay at home.After all , we can visit Mrs.Brown later 
 Bye . 
 How terrible ! This is quite unexpected ! 
 What happened ? 
 My doctor says that I need a blood test . 
 What are you taking my blood for ? 
 What information does that give him ? 
 Is a blood test painful ? 
 Oh , my God , that hurts ! 
 There's going to be a highway here . 
 The traffic problem will soon be eased . 
 I've got an idea . Let's make this game even more interesting . 
 Well , if you want to ! Seriously , though , let's make a bet . 
 Don't be such a chicken ! Whoever loses has to treat everyone to a movie . 
 Yes.That would be good . 
 What's the matter ? 
 You shouldn't have used the machine.Did you lose your money ? 
 You ought to complain.These machine are always out of order . 
 Good morning . This is room 113 . I'd like some breakfast , please . 
 That's right . 
 I'd like some grapefruit juice , marmalade , two scrambled eggs with two sausages , toast , and a pot of black coffee , please . How long will it take ? 
 Great . Thank you . 
 And that is ? 
 I'm afraid we can't agree to that . We concluded the business with you here in Houston , and the goods you ordered are manufactured in New York . We wish to point out that all orders accepted by us are shipped from New York or Seattle . Hong Kong is out of the question . 
 I see . You want to have your goods shipped from New York to Osaka via Hong Kong , where they can be transshipped . Is that the idea ? 
 Your idea may be a good one , but the trouble is that there are risks of pilferage or damage to the goods during transshipment at Hong Kong . How about shipping them from Seattle instead of network ? You may choose either one as port of shipment . It makes no difference to us . There are more sailings from Seattle than from New York . 
 We'll try our best . Anyway , we assure you that shipment will be made not later than the first half of April . 
 I would like to report a break-in . 
 I believe it happened last night . 
 It happened at my house . 
 I haven't checked yet . 
 My front window was broken . 
 I'd appreciate that . 
 Here you are . 
 Yes , I think so . The suit matches the trousers . 
 Would you be kind enough to lend me forty pounds ? 
 That's all right . 
 Is this about the Sales Assistant position ? 
 Mr wilson is on the line right now . Please have a seat . He'll be right with you . 
 Can I get you something , coffee , tea ? 
 Do you like plum blossoms ? 
 It's snowing heavily . What about taking a walk ? 
 What a heavy snow ! 
 I've got it . I like the sound of stepping on the snow very much . 
 Do you smell the sweet scent ? 
 The fragrance of plum blossoms comes from the hard coldness . 
 Hi , Tom.Want a cup of coffee ? 
 Oh , hey , did you look in the classified ads ? 
 No , Ah ... single sellers . 
 Uh huh.How about a used car ? They've got good ones now . 
 Oh , hey , how about a new car ? They've got easy loans now.You ' d feel so good driving a new car . 
 Do you want to rent a car ? 
 I think that one fits you . Do you need insurance ? 
 OK , by the way , fill the gas tank when you return the car . 
 I'm a little short . I don't have enough for you . 
 I really don't have enough money . 
 Well , why don't you ask Bob for some money ? I'm hungry too . 
 Okay , so on Friday , you can buy yourself something to eat . 
 You can always go home and make something to eat . 
 Sorry . That's not my fault . 
 Leave him alone , he ’ ll soon stop . 
 OK . Nothing serious . He just wants us to be with him . 
 Would you show me your ID , sir , please ? 
 Thank you very much . Now , sir , do you have a credit card ? 
 Regrettably , Mr . Sandals , we accept only MasterCard or VISA . 
 Thanks . You're in room 507 , a big , nonsmoking room , with a queen bed . Is that okay , sir ? 
 I'm happy to hear that . Here is your key . Just dial 0 if you need anything . 
 It's hard to say . Perhaps swimming is my favorite . I like swimming because it helps improve my lung capacity . In the scorching summer days , there's nothing like a cool swim . Currently , I go to the pool twice every week . 
 Well , it costs an arm and a leg — 30 yuan per person . What a costly sport ! That is why I have to refrain from even thinking about it . And I find jogging a very agreeable substitute . 
 You know what ? You won't get a rush from it until you fully understand it . It is a simple sport and doesn't require skills of any sort . This leaves room for me to enjoy the beautiful suburban scenery while jogging . Fresh air caresses my face and blows into my chest , which translates into inspirations . Inspirations are really good stuff for a writer like me . Sometimes , I even come up with a verse or two . 
 Hello , Bill ! How are things going ? 
 So-So . 
 Yeah . We went to a movie last Saturday . We saw Police Partners II . 
 Richard did , but I didn't . Of course , I told him I liked it . 
 Well , we went to a dance club . 
 Yeah , we had a great time . And we're going to go there again next week ! 
 It's on the south wall of the store , in aisle A . 
 I don't know . The produce person can tell you , though . 
 Don't worry about such problems . We can deal with them for you . Other questions ? 
 You are welcome . 
 What a good idea ! 
 OK . 
 Don ’ t worry about it . I have his pager number right here . 
 Forget it . It ’ s nothing . 
 Well , my roommate was friends with Amanda , so he introduced us . 
 Yes , he described her to me , and she sounded like my type . 
 Oh , I make a phone call once a month . 
 Yeah . 
 Is it convenient and cheap ? 
 Really ? I'm so glad to hear that.But I don't know how to get access to the Internet.Could you show me ? 
 I'll appreciate it very much . 
 We'll notify you next Thursday at the latest . Shall I telephone you ? 
 All right . Thank you for coming today . 
 Hey Michael . Where are you going ? 
 What for ? 
 Hey , I play basketball with a bunch of friends twice a week . It's great exercise and it's fun too . Why don't you come out and play with us ? 
 Did you already take the history exam ? 
 I take it tomorrow morning . There is so much material that I dont know what to emphasize on . What types of questions did you get ? 
 What about Abraham Lincoln ? Did you get any questions about him ? 
 Hopefully he will use the same exam , cause Im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war . It is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class . 
 Aright . Thanks for the info . I gotta go to the library now . 
 Thanks . See ya . 
 Positive 。 
 I'am absolutely sure I'm right . 
 This is right . There is no doubt in my mind . 
 Check and double check . 
 I suppose so , but don't rush . I've got to tell you how to do it . 
 Who ’ s this ? your girl-friend ? 
 How old is she ? 
 She is tall ? 
 And she is thin , isn ’ t she ? 
 Could you take us to the Fifth Avenue ? 
 Is the traffic very heavy this hour ? 
 Could I have my bill , please ? 
 I'm afraid there has been a mistake . 
 I believe you have charged me twice for the same thing . Look , the figure of 6.5 dollar appears here , then again here . 
 I heard Nick found a job in a bank and his salary is said very high . I also want to work there . 
 I know that , but making a lot of money makes me crazy . 
 Actually , I am afraid I will be stuck in the job forever , if I choose a bad one . 
 Did you get any rewards or honors in college ? 
 Did you join the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) ? 
 Very glad to know something about you , then what are you going to do when you finish . 
 That ’ s a good idea . It must be easy to find a job in shanghai . 
 And English is very useful in your job . 
 You will be a very promising one . 
 Next time you buy veggies or fruits , have them bagged and weighed before you come here . 
 The total comes to US $ 65.81 . How will you pay today ? 
 Slide your card through the card ID pad and punch in your PIN . 
 One moment . Do you want to withdraw some cash while you're at it ? 
 Paper or plastic ? 
 Do you want paper or plastic bags for your groceries ? 
 Hello , Dora , I haven't seen you for a long time . Where have you been ? 
 What's up ? You look unhappy . 
 Oh , I know . Sometimes I have the same feeling with you . But you'd better not be so emotional . 
 Sure , no problem . You can call me any time you are alone from now on . 
 Not at all . We are friends . 
 Yes . I am thinking of a tour to Australia . 
 That's really cheap . What are the fees included ? 
 OK , I will take the tour . 
 I ’ m looking for a bookcase , but I don ’ t want to buy a new one . 
 Not really . There aren ’ t any used bookcases listed . But there are a few rummage sales on Saturday . I think I ’ ll go to them . 
 Not at all . These private sales are great places to bargain . And sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk . 
 What happened ? 
 Hi , Boss ! I'd like to tell you what we've discussed during the day . 
 I think it's going very well , actually . We had a long meeting with them . After several lengthy discussions they decided to accept our offer . 
 We're meeting with their finance director today and then with the other directors tomorrow , just to sort out some final details . 
 OK . I never forget it . 
 Oh , I'm sorry , Nigel . I'm rushing to a meet right now . 
 Sure , but this week is crazy for me . Can we make it next Monday ? 
 That's fine . See you then . 
 Good morning . I have a reservation for a single room with a bath here . 
 John Bradley . 
 Yes , can I borrow your pen for a minute please ? 
 What should I fill in under the room number ? 
 Here you are . I think I have filled out everything correctly . 
 Oct 24th . 
 Ok , I will take good care of it . 
 Yes , I am ready . Thank you . 
 I will try . 
 OK , a moment , please . 
 For which one ? 
 Yes , of course . 
 Sorry . No . You should go to the other counter . 
 Sorry , this biography is over the deadline . You should pay extra for it . 
 3 Yuan , please . 
 You are welcome . See you next time . 
 No , I'm good . All we need now is our check . 
 I have never had bad service at this restaurant , but this time was really exceptional . 
 Let's take a look at our bill . The total price for our dinner is $ 36.00 . 
 I know that 15 % is a normal tip , but I really thought that this waitress went out of her way for us . What do you think about tipping her 20 % ? 
 So we can add her tip of $ 7.20 to the bill of $ 36.00 and the total will be $ 43.20 . 
 It absolutely was a great meal . We'll have to return here for lunch sometime . 
 That ’ s great . 
 The rent each month is $ 1050 . 
 Did you have a better price in mind ? 
 That ’ s way too low . 
 How about $ 900 a month ? 
 Great . It was a pleasure doing business with you . 
 Do you think she'd like a laptop ? 
 A Mac is something most people appreciate . 
 Our 15 - inch Pro will cost you only $ 2,100 . 
 You've made a good decision . How would you like to pay ? 
 It's all yours after you sign here , please . 
 This is good to go . If she wants accessories , just visit us again . 
 Have a nice day , and thank you for shopping here . 
 Yes , I am . I like to watch soccer games on TV , but I don ’ t play . I watched every game of the 2002 World Cup . 
 Italian . They played very well , but they were not very lucky . 
 Are you a good driver ? 
 I need you to teach me how to drive . 
 Yes , I have it . 
 I drove a car before , but only once . 
 I already know all of them . 
 When do you have time ? 
 What sort of problems do you have with these machines ? 
 What's Beijing like ? 
 What can I see in Beijing ? 
 What ’ s it like ? 
 What do you think of this suit ? Do I look good or what ? 
 Didn't they say we're going to the Ritz ? 
 In that case , let me make a quick change into my street clothes . 
 Ta da ! Let's go to the Ritz ! 
 Don't you feel a little strange taking the place of your old boss after he was demoted ? 
 Did they mutiny ? 
 It is a really good chance for you to get more exposure at work . supervisors get to take the credit for all the hard work of the people under them . 
 Guess what I just heard ? 
 The boss is planning to sell the company . 
 I need a room for a few days . 
 John Sandals . That's S A N D A L S . 
 I'll be there in April Friday through Monday , the 14th through the 17th . 
 Possibly . What's the actual price ? 
 $ 308 ! That's not bad . 
 Nonsmoking , definitely ! 
 Yes , that'll be just fine . 
 It's 626-555-1739 . 
 Jack's been looking unhappy lately . 
 No wonder ! I'd be unhappy , too . 
 Oh , yes . Laura ’ s the oldest . She ’ s a computer programmer . 
 She ’ s a librarian at the public library . 
 Christy is working as a waitress at a restaurant in Paris . She ’ s married to a French photographer . 
 Larry drives a truck . He drives all over the country . We hardly ever seen him . 
 Colorado . 
 Oh , no . Rocky is a pilot . 
 Yes . Mostly to England and France . 
 You did a fabulous job . 
 That's what I'm telling you . 
 You did mess up a little on one thing . 
 You had a little trouble on your parallel parking . 
 That's something that you really need to work on . 
 You're still going to get it . 
 Fine , Mr . Richardson . What do you have in mind ? 
 Yes ! I agree ! We could really use another one ! I ’ ll get on that right away ! What else would you like to order ? 
 Why not ? 
 When poyou have to see her ? 
 Good morning , Japan Airline domestic reservations . Can I help you ? 
 The flight to Huston takes off daily every two hours from 6:00 to 11:00 pm . So you don't need a reservation . Seats are available on a ' first come , first served ' basis . 
 Can you go to the store for me ? 
 Just a couple things , here's a list . 
 No , I think that's all that I need . 
 If you can , could you pick up my prescription for me ? 
 I think so . It should be . 
 Thank you so much . 
 Excuse me , sir , the toilet in my room doesn't flush . 
 812 . 
 The tap is always driving . I can't sleep well . 
 Excuse me . Is this seat taken ? 
 Are you ready for your big interview tomorrow ? 
 Lots ! Have you done any research about the company ? 
 Have you updated your CV ? 
 I would like to check out now.My room number is 712 . 
 Do you accept traveler's checks ? 
 Here you are . 
 You'll never be in shape until you eat less and take more exercise . 
 I often eat fish and eggs . 
 Oh yes , and fruits . I love fruits very much . 
 Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . 
 I drink a lot of milk . I drink milk almost every day . 
 Well , I walk every day . 
 Yes , quite right . 
 What size do you want ? 
 How about this one ? It's the latest design . 
 Hey , Mary . We're back . Have you eaten yet ? 
 Let's go out for brunch . 
 It is a meal that combines breakfast and lunch . On Sundays , many Americans sleep late and go out for brunch . Those who go to church without having breakfast have brunch also . 
 Have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ? 
 Well , but for this one , don ’ t bring your cell phone to meetings , I think it is not reasonable . What if there are some important calls ? 
 I didn ’ t pay attention to that . 
 I worked as a personnel manager in a state-owned company , and then I transferred to a joint venture as a sales manager . So I am familiar with the exile market in China . 
 They treated me very well . We cooperated harmoniously and respected each other . 
 I have learned some skills about how to deal with clients and how to behave myself as a personnel manager . 
 I prefered working with other colleagues when I worked in my previous company . I think teamwork and cooperation are very important . No matter how competent he or she is in a company , he can't do without them . 
 No , what ? 
 You're kidding ! 
 How's business ? 
 How do you do , Mr.Smith ? This is Lili . I'm calling to thank you for the wonderful dinner we had yesterday . I enjoyed it very much . 
 Thank you , Mr.Smith . I'm returning to China today . 
 Yes . I appreciate all help and in particular , all the time that you've spent on my account during my stay here . 
 If there's anything that I can help you in the future , please let me know . 
 Could we have the honor of you presence of the meeting ? 
 Would you prefer some other time ? 
 Are you quite sure you can come next Tuesday ? 
 What time am I supposed to pick you up ? 
 OK . 
 See you . Have a nice day ! 
 Ouch ! 
 Yeah , I just bumped into the table . 
 Yes , it is . 
 Yes , he is . 
 Sure . What about the cloth over there ? It's in fashion . 
 Come here and I will measure you . 
 What is life ? 
 Then do you think that life is arranged by something above us . 
 Right . 
 I went to play tennis in the public park . 
 Twice a week . How about you ? 
 But it is very difficult to gather a team of players together . 
 Do you like watching football matches ? 
 Oh , I watched it on television . It was an exciting match . 
 Half past 11 . 
 No , it's an express . 
 Excuse me . Check please . 
 Very nice . Thank you . 
 Yes , can you put it in a plastic bag ? 
 Do you take credit cards ? 
 OK , here you are . 
 OK . 
 Thank you . 
 Daniel , you know ? Lisa has invited us to have dinner this afternoon . 
 Can I help you ? 
 A single ? 
 Please fill out this form , sir . 
 Here are your keys . Check out time is noon . 
 No . 
 Where do you think you lost it ? Outside the hotel ? 
 I'm afraid , ma'am , you have to pay U . S . $ 100 since you lost the key . 
 I'm afraid no.It is not covered by this insurance . 
 Why ? Is there some new , cool computer out on the market ? 
 That's a notebook ? 
 It looks more like a toy , or a cool briefcase ! 
 They're right over there , next to the dictionaries . 
 Let ' s see . These books here focus on grammar , and those are mainly for conversation practice ... Here we are . This book has short passages for students to read and answer questions about . 
 What happened ? 
 Hello , Hanson . Today I come to say goodbye to you , for I'm going back to London tomorrow . 
 Much as I wish to but I really can ’ t . I've already booked the flight . 
 Of course not . You can come to London to visit me in future . And I also will come here if I have a chance . 
 I will miss you , too . You're really a good friend . 
 It doesn't matter . 
 I will . 
 Thankyou . Goodbye ! 
 Can we go somewhere nearby ? I don't feel like walking too far . 
 I mean the food for something spicy . 
 That sounds great . I love Korean food . 
 Mr . Thomas , this is a standard size . 
 Yes , we have plenty on hand right now . 
 OK , thanks for the order . 
 Yes . We don ’ t give bonus every month , but we offer semi-annual bonuses . 
 Yes . Commission will be given on the basis of your sales revenue . And the percentage will be 2 % of your total revenue . 
 Yes , speaking . 
 OK . What time is it ? 
 I ’ m afraid I'll be tied up at 3 o ’ clock this afternoon . Could you make it 5 o'clock this afternoon ? 
 Fine . Good-bye . 
 Like a cat on hot bricks , as you might say . I don ’ t believe you are listening at all . 
 Don ’ t worry him , he has been grown up and I think he can take himself very well . 
 Maybe he is on the way home now . 
 I don't know what happened ! 
 No , I didn't . Really ! 
 Mr Ludlow , hello . It's good to see you again . What can we do for you today ? 
 No problem . Could I please see the bill and all of the other documents ? 
 There's no problem here , everything's in order . I can transact that for you now . 
 No , you don't need to pay anything on top . We just simply deduct the discounting interest . 
 What's the matter ? Please tell me . Maybe I can help you . 
 Don't worry . I know about this . 
 First you should have a salutation , which can be the company's or a person's name . 
 Then you can write about his performance in college , including his academic achievements and his competence . 
 You can also state his personality traits , hobbies and relationships with schoolmates and so on . 
 You can write all his strengths in the recommendation letter . 
 You should also state that you are his class president , so you are qualified to write this recommendation letter 
 That's the transfer completed . Can I do anything else for you today ? 
 Could I have your Savings Book and the money , please . You are making a deposit of 800 RIB , is that correct ? 
 Please enter your PIN number on the keypad . 
 Will you be voting ? 
 I already have . 
 I mailed in an absentee ballot . 
 I can ’ t vote on Tuesday . 
 I have to go to work . 
 I need to take care of some business that morning . 
 Nice and warm again , isn ’ t it ? 
 How are you these days ? 
 Fine today , though a bit under the weather last week . 
 Hello , Lina . I'm calling about your new PIN scheme . I'm new to all of this , so some of my questions may sound a little ignorant ... 
 I see . How about buying and selling items ? 
 That's good to know , because I do travel quite frequently . 
 ok , what unusual food do you want to try ? 
 what's that ? 
 I don't know . I don't know what most of this food is ! 
 I'd like to have some vegetables first . 
 no , what is it ? 
 what do you use to eat it ? 
 that sounds great . Do you know if there are any vegetable dishes that are spicy ? 
 I'll try all of those . How do you know so much about International food ? 
 Please point out the painful place with your finger . Is there any relation between the pain and the weather ? 
 Have you ever had any trauma ? 
 Does the pian become more intense at night ? 
 Do you have the sensation of ants crawling over the painful part ? 
 I'd like to treat you with acupuncture if you agree . 
 Acupuncture may cause just a little pain , but it also causes a certain feeling of numbness and distension . We'll try it every day for seven days . Will that be all right ? 
 This will be your office here . 
 We try to get everyone in the upper management team a nice office . 
 I'm glad you like it . 
 Yes , we have a coffee machine and some other beverages in the break room . 
 It's just down the hall , the fourth door on your right . 
 You can always call me if you need anything and I will get it for you . 
 Anita , I ’ Ve been here only three days and you ’ re leaving already . 
 Gambling ? Where ? 
 If you gamble all night , you ’ ll run out of money in a few days . 
 We need to redo the curtains and paint all the walls and ceilings . 
 You mean we can't just buy curtains already made ? 
 While the curtains are being made , I can start having people look at the kitchen . I can't stand that old kitchen . I won't be able to cook there . I don't want to use that electric stove . 
 I agree . The colors must be soft and pleasant . You should feel comfortable when you cook our dinners . 
 No , I don't think so . I'll be too busy having tea in our new tea room . 
 And you'll have to sell your motorcycle . And your cameras . Right ? 
 Four times might be enough . Not once or twice . 
 Don't take it too hard . There are some tips you should know in job-hunting of 2010 . 
 Firstly , you must always show your best to the interviewer . And secondly , try to avoid spamming through e-mails , because this will make the reader go crazy . The last but not the least , there is no substitute for pounding the pavement in such a digital age . 
 Good luck to us . 
 Yes , are there any planes to Paris ? 
 Yes , please . And I'll need an economy class open return . 
 How do you get along with your boss ? 
 What do you think is important in your work ? 
 Do you know that John isn't going to come back to our school ? 
 He had moved and held a party on July 1st . 
 Even he's not coming back to school anymore , you still can call him and meet him on weekends . 
 Excuse me . Can I get a refund of my ticket ? I have to cancel my trip because I have something emergent to deal with . 
 It is Train No . 249 . It will depart in four hours . 
 How much is the cancellation fee ? 
 Thanks . 
 Gee , how dangerous ! I've almost knocked him down . 
 I braked as hard as I could . 
 Don't you know that he has been carrying a torch for Mary for years ? 
 Of course not . 
 Excuse me , sir . What would you like to eat , Chinese food or western food ? 
 Are you going to have this set course or have dinner in the dining room ? 
 Please put down the table in front of you . It's more comfortable that way . 
 It's my pleasure . What would you like to drink , milk , tea , coffee , orange juice or iced water ? 
 Yes , here you are . Enjoy your meal . 
 OK , enjoy yourself , sir . 
 It is beef . Do you like it ? 
 You are welcome . Please press that button if you need any help . 
 Which language do you speak ? 
 Yes , I do . I ’ m learning Chinese now on the internet . 
 It ’ s not easy , particularly with listening and speaking , because sometimes the connection isn ’ t too good . 
 Actually , many of the characters are the same or very similar in both Chinese and Japanese , so they ’ re easy for me . 
 Yes . How are the Spanish classes going ? 
 You're having coffee , aren't you ? 
 What are you going to have to eat ? 
 That sounds good to me . I'll have the same . 
 Let me see . Your name , please ? 
 We are sorry to bring you so much trouble . 
 Yes . That's what we want . 
 All I had was a sandwich , chips , and soda . 
 I went to the cafeteria and bought it . 
 I ordered a ham sandwich , but they gave me a bologna sandwich instead . 
 I enjoyed it , even though I had not asked for it . 
 Is that right ? 
 That may be true , but I'm sure you enjoyed your sandwich . 
 I would be happy to . Did you find everything you needed ? 
 The total is 200 dollars . Would you like to put that on Sears card ? 
 Good morning ! May I help you ? 
 Do you have an appointment with Mr . Smith ? 
 Wait a moment , please . I'll tell his secretary that you are here . 
 I'm sorry . He is holding a meeting until ten o'clock . 
 May I try on this pair of shoes ? 
 I think it's 35 . 
 Hmm , I don't feel very comfortable . 
 This is just right for me . I'll take this one . 
 Good . And because this is our initial order , and your products is so new , we would like to make a deal with you . 
 We want to make this a trial order . If we can sell all the products in two months , we will pay for them ; if not , we will send them back to you . 
 We promise that if the products are sold out in two months , we will place a repeat order right away , at the same quality . 
 Hey Matt . I just got a job at a consulting firm . 
 I'm so happy . I don't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore . 
 I start next Monday . 
 I know . I'm a little nervous , but it's pretty exciting . 
 Yeah . I'm going to celebrate tonight . Wanna hang out ? 
 Of course . How about Toby ? Should we call him ? 
 I should still tell him . In the least , I can refer him to my company . It might help . 
 I went to Jessie's birthday party yesterday . It was very good . 
 We ate a lot of things . We played games and gave gifts to Jessie . We had a lot of fun . 
 My birthday comes next month . I want to hold a birthday party , too . 
 My son closed his ear to what I said . I don ’ t know what I should do . 
 I cannot have the heart to do that . 
 Yes . We ’ re having a special sale on this machine here . 
 No . It ’ s Swedish . Would you like me to demonstrate it for you ? 
 Bill , your work is too messy . 
 Is this a promise ? 
 How are you doing today ? 
 What can I help you with ? 
 As a matter of fact , you do . 
 You owe $ 235.13 . 
 Will you be paying some of that off today ? 
 How will you be paying ? 
 ... Now , that's all I want to say about world coal reserves . So let's move on to the next topic , renewable resources . There are three things we have to consider when talking about renewable resources . First , sustainability ; second , marketability ; lastly , the reality factor . Let's talk about each point in more detail ... John , would you like to take it from here ? 
 I wonder if you could help me ? 
 Could you take a picture of me to my friend ? 
 Hi , Mary . I haven't seen you in ages ! I heard that you and Daniel are getting married on August 8th , the opening day of the 2008 Olympic Games . Is it true ? 
 good for you ! It sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time . 
 is everything ready now ? 
 have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job . 
 it's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . 
 I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available . 
 my pleasure . 
 Yes . Everything's all set . 
 We're supposed to be meeting alone . 
 Fine . But no one else , OK ? 
 Tom's new business will do well . 
 How do you like the food ? 
 Yes . I made it this afternoon . Would you like some more ? 
 Oh . Would you like some soup instead ? 
 Tomato and rice . Have you had that before ? 
 It's good , try it . What do you think ? 
 Yes . 
 Thanks , next time I'll make chicken soup for us . 
 No , I learned by myself . I have a good cook book that I read when I have time . 
 All right , Mr . Green . 
 Pretty well . Everyone is working hard . 
 You mean I'm among the people who have to go ? 
 Did I do something wrong ? 
 But you know I've been working very hard . And I have a family to support . 
 Jared , I just heard about your father . How is he doing ? 
 I'm so sorry to hear that . But this is a good hospital . I'm sure they will do whatever they can . 
 You must feel really worried right now . But you know your dad is a fighter . 
 Where is she right now ? 
 Hey , I'll go with you . 
 It's really no problem . 
 So you're traveling around the world , aren't you . 
 When did you arrive here ? 
 Did you have a good journey ? 
 Where have you been on this trip ? 
 Really ? How long will your holiday last ?

 I want a rematch . Let's play again . 
 Are you coming or not ? 
 Well , make up your mind . We need to know . 
 Mary , why are you so tired ? 
 Why don't you think about applying for a job on the Internet ? 
 Well , it's very convenient and very popular now . 
 Just get online and send your application through email to the employer . 
 You could place your job hunting information on the Job Wanted channel on a recruitment website . 
 Yes . If they think you are a fit , maybe they will contact you . 
 If you log in some formal websites , it must be very safe . 
 Hang out the clothes . 
 I have been washing the dishes for over a week now . 
 No . We made an agreement that we would take turns doing the dishes . Now it's your turn to do them . 
 Mr Jacobs ! Lovely to see you again ! What can I do for you today ? 
 What a thoughtful granddad ! Do you have her account details with you ? 
 Great . Please fill them out on this deposit slip . 
 That's right . How much do you want to pay in ? 
 Not just a thoughtful granddad , but a generous one too . 
 Some people are always closing their handsets , so it's difficult to inform them . 
 Can short messages reach them ? 
 Why haven't I thought of this skill ? 
 I am informed that many people used short messages to pay a New Year call , and only on the Spring Festival it amounted to 1 billion this year , didn't it ? 
 Have you met John ? 
 Have you noticed how fluently he speaks English ? He has only lived in America for less than three months . 
 I had to announce his innocence in court today , but it left a nasty taste in my mouth . 
 I ’ m not sure . I ’ ll try to prove my feeling . 
 It rumored that Jean is fooling around with another woman's husband . 
 Someone declared that he saw it .

 Hello , can I speak to Mark Wyatt , please ? 
 Does Mark Wyatt work there ? 
 W-Y-A-T-T , Mark Wyatt . 
 No problem . 
 Tell me what the problem is . 
 Try checking the connections . 
 The cords that you see behind your CPU that plug into an outlet . 
 If they're not connected right , that will keep it from turning on . 
 You should check the connections . 
 Tell me if it's still not working . 
 That's great ! Congratulations . 
 Oh , it's my pleasure . After all , you are very qualified for the position .

 No . But I ’ m sure she is a good girl . My sixth sense tells me so . 
 Would you like a cup of coffee ? 
 I'm going to get one for myself . They make really good coffee here . 
 Shall we visit the Summer Palace tomorrow ? 
 How far is it from our hotel ? 
 If we start early , do we have some time for Yuanmingyuan ? 
 Decent dressing and appearance , which contribute to a good first impression of the interviewer , are surely quite important . 
 Whatever you wear , it should perfectly reflect your confidence and vitality 
 Gentlemen should wear western-style suits in the interview , which will help you look handsome . 
 But those fashionable and shiny clothes should be avoided . 
 You should present the best of yourself in order to achieve success in the interview . 
 In a word , dressing and appearance are indeed important , but it should never be all . 
 have you ever been to Disneyworld ? 
 the one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland . 
 well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon . 
 some time next year . We haven't set the date yet . 
 thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ? 
 for the most part , yes . Some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though . 
 even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ? 
 thanks for the advice . I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight . 
 Hello , may I speak to Kevin , please ? 
 Hey ! Are you getting dressed ? 
 Why ? What time is it ? 
 But it's Saturday ! ! 
 No , I'm not . I'm staying in bed . 
 If I'm awake . 
 Oh , come on . Let's not beat a dead horse . 
 Which book ? This one ? 
 This one ? 
 Here you are . 
 Would you like to go skiing with me ? I heard the new ski area is great . They have safe tracks , especially for the beginners and provide free training . I think it suits you best . 
 Then you can go to the three-day-long training camp first . There ’ re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise . 
 Come on ! It is really a fun game . 
 Sure , what's the author's name , please . 
 Charles Dickens ? 
 OK , do you know the title of the book ? 
 So , show me the note please . 
 Oh , such bad luck , sir . Can you please name the category of the book ? 
 OK , I'll search it for you . A moment , please . 
 Where can I get a good novel ? 
 Hello , this is Wal-mart . Can I help you ? 
 We close at 10:00 every day . And we open at 9:00 in the morning . 
 Same hours as on the weekdays . 
 Yes , it runs till the end of the month . But things are clearing out fast . 
 Thank you for calling . 
 Oh John , I thought we said we would start eating right ! Remember ? Our new healthy lifestyle ? That ’ s all junk food ! 
 Well , healthy food , of course ! I got some whole wheat bread , skimmed milk , fresh fish and organic carrots ... 
 They were grown without using any chemicals that are harmful to our health . And yes , John , we need organic carrots ... 
 Yup , better for the environment and better for us ! 
 I like doughnuts . 
 I did , too.Come and visit us again , will you ? 
 Excuse me , is this seat taken ? 
 You work upstair , right ? I think I have seen you before . I'm Karren , Karren Brown . 
 Happy to know you , Tim . 
 I did . Why ? 
 No , I didn't . I'm sorry . It won't happen again . 
 the end of all the hard work for my master's . what a nice feeling to get my degree ! 
 certainly . After years of hard work , I wouldn't miss it . By the way , where can I find cap and gown ? 
 oh , I think they're provided by the school for that special day . 
 what do most of the students do ? 
 then , I might as well have them made . 
 hold it a second . I want to fix my hairpin . 
 here's Lisa . May I take a picture with her ? 
 Hello , Grace . That's a beautiful skirt you have on . Where are you going ? 
 What kind of job are you applying for ? 
 Oh . That dress doesn't exactly match the job . 
 Yes , your skirt is really beautiful , but you are applying for a teaching position . You see , your skirt is very short , and your make up is too thick . What's more , the color of your lipstick doesn't match your skin . As a teacher , you should be a little more sedate . 
 Some of my friends tell me that being a teacher , the most important is the beauty of mind . You shouldn't pay too much attention to your appearance . You should appear frugal and prudent . Your experience and knowledge will gain the appreciation of your interviewer . 
 Thank you . Wow , your school has so many honors . Congratulations ! 
 Excuse me . I wonder see Dean Mr . Lee first . I was wondering if could you tell me where his office is ? 
 Excuse me ? 
 Thank you very much . It ’ s very kind of you . 
 This is it ? 
 Hello , Bob . Can you give me an update of the situation ? 
 Is everything under control ? 
 Thomas , would you be so kind as to lay the table for me ? I'm busy in the kitchen . 
 They're all here . 
 Thanks a lot . I'm most grateful . 
 So you knew it was me ? 
 Look , before we get into the secret admirer thing , I want to talk to you about WebTracker . 
 So you're really planning to quit invoking and switch over to WebTracker ? 
 How much will it amount to ? 
 Do you receive traveler's checks ? 
 can I see these silk ties ? 
 I ’ ll take this one . 
 No , thank you . I want to have a look at that scarf . 
 Oh . I like this one . I have been looking for this color and design . Please wrap it for me , and I ’ ll take it . 
 I think she is in her room putting a little something together for you to take to school with you . 
 I know , but she is going to miss you something awful . Have I told you how proud I am of you ? 
 I mean it . You have really shown us that you are prepared to take on the adult world . 
 We have great confidence in you . 
 OK , I ’ Ve been looking for a job for days , and I haven ’ t found one yet . It's so hard finding work these days . Have you had any luck ? 
 Are you well paid ? 
 Not bad . 
 That ’ s great ! I ’ ll go there right now and speak with the boss . 
 That was nice of you , Susan . Thanks a lot . 
 Could you tell me a bit more about the work there ? I mean , those dos and don'ts . I am a green hand , you know . 
 Be a yes-man , you mean ? 
 I hope not . 
 It's Peter's turn . 
 OK . 
 I thought he only liked to listen ! 
 He has a really good voice ! 
 Where did you get all these barney tour pamphlets ? 
 That ’ s why it ’ s become a very popular holiday destination these years . Someone told me the service there is very good too . Are you planning to spend the holiday there ? 
 How many days is the tour ? 
 That ’ s a perfect plan . Enjoy yourself . 
 A man stepped on my feet when I was waiting for the taxi . 
 Yes . Do you have a savings account in our bank ? 
 How long do you want to keep it in our bank ? 
 You have to fill in this form with your name , address , ID card number , deposit term and the amount you want to deposit . 
 Don't worry . You can draw your money at any time . But you'll not receive the time deposit return of interest . What we can offer is a current one . 
 In that case , we'll just regard your account as a regular savings account from then on . 
 I'd like you to bring me some food . 
 Please send up a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare . 
 Sure , I love porterhouse , too . 
 I'd love to , but I'm allergic to strawberries . 
 Go right ahead . 
 Eric , how long will you be in China ? 
 Well , have you ever thought about learning some Chinese ? 
 Don't worry . All things are difficult before they are easy . 
 Well , are you invested in some language-exchange program ? 
 It's where I teach you Chinese , and in exchange you teach me English . 
 How about this sunday ? 
 Good . I'll give you a call tonight . 
 Bye . 
 Why not ? 
 I wouldn't say that . It looks fine to me . 
 Oh , come on , as long as it looks good on her . 
 You ’ re darn right . I am out of style . So what What's the point of keeping yourself in style 
 Is Tom in ? 
 Isn't this Li's residence ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry . 
 You must be joking . The job is nice and she is well paid . 
 I'd like to have internet on my computer . 
 What are my options ? 
 Which one would you recommend ? 
 Why is DEL better ? 
 What exactly does that mean ? 
 That means that I can't use my phone and the internet at the same time , right ? 
 Janice , the president of our company , Mr Smith , will invite two programmers to give us a lecture this afternoon . Are all the members notified ? 
 Is the room ready for the lecture now ? 
 Excellent . How about the microphone and speaker ? 
 Write up the official notice in duplicate . Do not forget to put name cards and pens on the tables for our guests . 
 How would you seat them ? 
 Well , after the half of the meeting , there will be an interval for rest and refreshment . 
 How high did the price go ? 
 You didn't watch the end of the auction ? 
 How upsetting ! He has been away for a week ! 
 I have reported it to the police . 
 Good morning , madam . 
 May I help you ? 
 This way , please . 
 You're welcome . 
 Just Mr . White . 
 He wouldn't say over the phone . 
 I ’ m looking for a sweater . 
 Well , I ’ m looking for size 10 but you don ’ t have it . 
 Yes , I like the color . Can I try it on ? 
 It fits well . I like it a lot . What do you think ? 
 Oh , it ’ s my favorite . How much is it ? 
 Okay . I ’ ll take it . Thank you very much for your help . 
 Ernie , I'm really excited about starting this band together . We're going to be the two coolest students on campus . 
 That's a good question . You know I love hip hop , so maybe we can play some Vanilla Ice songs . 
 That's OK . You can buy his songs on iTunes and listen to them . 
 Yes , it does , sir . 
 First connect your laptop to the cable in the desk . Then open up your web browser . 
 You can buy credit on the hotel website or at the business centre . 
 I am calling to ask the position of HR manager . Could you tell me more about it ? 
 I have a master's degree in HR management in Peking University . And I worked as a HR manager in a European enterprise for many years . I know it is not just some clerical issues , but more social work with reason and patience . 
 OK , thanks a lot . See you then . 
 Yes , thank you . I want to get a handbag . 
 No , I have no girlfriend . 
 I am afraid it is too big . 
 Too bad . But , is there any other leather store nearby ? 
 I hope so . Thanks . 
 What do you do ? 
 You are an early bird , Tom . What do you do in the morning then ? 
 So , you choose to spend it on bodybuilding . Where do you exercise ? 
 Do you do the same exercises every day ? 
 Why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ? 
 Oh , yes . Singing is also a good way of keeping fit , at least mentally . 
 No , I don't think so . 
 No . It's no problem.Are you American ? 
 No . I'm from Taiwan . Can't you see ? 
 I don't think so . You are flattering me . 
 Are you flying home ? 
 You were visiting Taiwan ? 
 Really ! You live in Taiwan ! 
 May I ask what your job is in Taiwan ? 
 Of course . It's a good school . How long have you lived in Taichung ? 
 It must be strange for you to live in Taiwan . 
 No . Well , I don't know.But Taiwan is so crowded . Don't you miss life in America ? 
 don ’ t worry . I don't think you ’ re going to lose your job over one mistake . 
 but it wasn ’ t just you who was involved , right ? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do . 
 let ’ s think realistically about what might happen . How much money do you have in your savings ? 
 well , that ’ s good . If you lose your job , you can just move in with me until you find another job . That will save you plenty of money . 
 if you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . If you live frugally , you ’ ll save plenty of money . 
 I like to stay here . 
 People are very kind down your way . You ’ re lucky . 
 Never . 
 Yeah . People down our way hardly speak to each other . 
 I ’ m very well , thank you . 
 yes , that ’ s true . 
 I fixed many kinds of machine tools such as milling machines , grinders , welders , etc . I also repaired other things such as vacuums , toilets , locks , etc . I also did some electrical work . I took some courses about electrical systems . 
 I took care of commercial and residential coolers and heaters . I fixed many kinds of power failure problems . Some co-workers and I even rewired part of a building . 
 the best job ? What do you mean ? 
 I think my favorite job so far was when I worked for Linaria . It was hard work but the people on my job crew were great to work with . We really worked as a team . I enjoy working with those people . 
 I fixed a big problem with a machine and saved a lot of money for the factory . I got bonus for it . 
 Go ahead , please . 
 wow , this question is hard to answer . I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever had a job that I really disliked . But I dislike work that is monotonous , always the same from day to day . I like to move around and do different things . 
 no . I can ’ t think of any right now . 
 thank you very much . I ’ m looking forward to hearing from you about this job . 
 Yes , I have the Tour Guide Certificate . 
 Because your travel agency has a good fame in this market ; what's more , all the staff here are working very hard . I like doing some challenging job . 
 Oh yeah ? 
 How did you feel when you graduated ? 
 What did you do after graduation ? 
 Sounds like you're happy with your decision . 
 It was also a proud day for me , but I also felt like a kind of loss that day . 
 While seeing others going to work or continue their study , I didn't know what I would do . 
 I had one , but I didn't like the job very much . I wanted to attend graduate school , but I was afraid it would be too tough . 
 Would you like a smoking or non-smoking room ? 
 Hello , I ’ d like a return to Xi ’ an please . 
 Tomorrow . 
 How much is the soft sleeper ? 
 Ok , I ’ ll take a return ticket on the soft sleeper please . 
 The kitchen god ? What does he do ? 
 Oh , no ! I did a lot of bad things this year . I hope the kitchen god isn't like Lester--he blabs my mistakes to everybody ! 
 What is it ? Tell me ! Will it work for Lester , too ? 
 Hmm . Are you sure that will work ? I already tried giving chocolate to Lester . 
 His face broke out and he said it was my fault ! 
 Oh , I know . She is a famous woman and a focus of the newspaper now because of this thing . 
 Yes . Do you know its name . 
 Oh , I think she wants to do this thing in memory of her father . 
 Yes , I did . I heard that they took both drivers to hospital . One needed surgery . 
 The second driver was luckier . He had a concussion and needed some stitches for his head wound . 
 I understand that he ’ s connected to a heart monitor and breathing apparatus . His condition can ’ t be very good . 
 It means he ’ s really badly injured , but he will almost certainly survive . 
 hello , Kate ! How are you doing ? 
 fine . How are your term papers ? 
 how could it be ? They are due two weeks later . 
 Kate , you know , I am thinking of getting a part-time job next year because I really need more money and I don't want to ask my parents for any more . But I'm so busy ! How am I going to work and study 
 my advisor ? 
 Thank you for your compliment . I bought this PC with my first-month salary . I am getting to know the on-line trade . 
 Yes , I often do business through internet now . 
 Yes , very gorgeous . Sometimes , I can deal with my business without stepping out of our house . 
 Firstly , it is convenient . And secondly , it has low cost , because you know you only need to pay the fee of internet service . 
 The most important is that it is very convenient . You know you can browse the website and send E-mails to your customers at any time . Even you can have e-contract with your regular customers . 
 Sure , but every coin has two sides . Doing business through the internet is not as safe as doing business through traditional ways . 
 Of course , such as Alabama , which is a famous website . 
 I'd like to change some US dollars into euros and I'd like to know today's exchange rate . 
 Is there any service charge ? 
 400 US dollars . Here it is . Would you please give me small bills ? 
 This position requires a high level of English ability . How is your spoken and written English ? 
 What other foreign languages do you speak ? 
 Anything else ? 
 What special skills do you have ? 
 Have you got any special training in programming ? 
 Do you have a good psychological resilience ? 
 Hello , my name is Bill Martin and we have a reservation for party tonight . 
 I need to cancel that . We have had a last minute change of plans . 
 OK , we will let you know as early as possible . By the way , will we be able to get a refund on this cancellation ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Good-bye . 
 Hi , I was just coming to see you.But since you made the trek to my office , you get to go first . 
 Well , I can try , what do you need ? 
 Sure , no problem.But I need something from you . 
 I'm supposed to have this package ready for mailing out tomorrow morning and I'm miles away from being ready.Can you edit this product study I wrote while I do these ? 
 That works for me . 
 Here's a print out of the study , and this is a disc with the full report on it.The file name is product study , this is and extra copy so you can do whatever you want with it . 
 So what are you trying to say to me ? 
 How should I say it ? 
 It has only been 6 months , our relationship hasn't had a chance to maturate . We are still have some hurdle we have to jump over . 
 Last week I saw Brain kissing you on the cheek . 
 That is ok , then ? Starts on the cheek ? pretty soon you french kiss in the back on his car . 
 So is it ok if I kiss other women on the cheek ? 
 You see , we still have hurdle . 
 Give me a minute . 
 There you go . 
 What's wrong ? 
 What's so bad about it ? 
 Sorry about that . 
 Well , let me talk to my manager , okay ? 
 Why not ? 
 So what ? His father is in prison , not he . 
 What's your favorite course , Daniel ? 
 Science ? That's a surprise . 
 I thought you would like PE . 
 Are you interested in science ? I can't believe it . 
 Your parents would be happy if they knew that . Because you are always a naughty boy . 
 Hope so . 
 Thank you . 
 Sure ! Well , I graduated with honors from Chesterton University with a major in Business Administration , with a specialization in Information Management , and I minored in psychology . I chose this course of study for two reasons . I wanted to gain some practical , marketable skills , which the information management track provided , and I also feel that interpersonal skills are essential for professional success , hence the minor in psychology . 
 Well , I am really passionate about consumer behavior , so I pursued a master ’ s in that area . I also strive to keep my professional skills current , so I continuously attend seminars and conferences related management and customer service . 
 Yeah , I worked as their customer support manager , which brought me a breadth of experience in both client care , and process management . I supervised and coordinated the customer support team as well as implemented new strategies to achieve better customer satisfaction . 
 Yes , in this position I was able to make some pretty significant contributions to the overall success of the company . With the different initiatives that we implemented , we lowered our churn rate to about five percent , which had a direct impact on revenue . 
 I am . 
 The police officer that pulled me over said I was speeding . 
 I was not speeding . 
 In a 40 mph zone , I was only going about 35 . 
 Do I still need to pay the fine ? 
 I appreciate your understanding . 
 I know . I ’ m just waiting for confirmation on one of them . I can get them to you by tomorrow morning . 
 That ’ s all right . 
 OK , thank you . 
 That'd be nice . 
 OK , but do you want to talk to your wife if she calls ? 
 All right . 
 I don ’ t have the slightest clue . 
 I ’ m not sure . 
 PCC is perfectly fine for me . 
 That ’ s not a bad idea . 
 You have a point . 
 I ’ m just going to keep going to PCC . 
 Stephany said she would go out with me . 
 That ’ s in one month , and besides , this is a group date with all of our friends . 
 We ’ re going fishing . 
 These girls are different , they are not wimpy . 
 Why would I do that ? 
 Some men do , but not me . 
 I'm an open book . Watch me all you want . 
 You won't catch me , because I love you . I'm not a cheater . 
 I don't want any other woman . 
 Honey , please . You're the only woman for me , forever . I swear it . 
 Let's see . That would be ¥ 160 a day a mile . 
 Do you have a valid license ? 
 Fine . Now complete this form and sign your name at the bottom . 
 I only started looking for a job a few days ago . 
 yes , I was precise with every word in my resume ? 
 absolutely , I've highlighted all my strengths and the resume is clear and easy to read . 
 a cover letter ? I've never thought about that . Won't a CV do for my job application ? 
 sounds reasonable.Even if I'm the right one for the job , many people are applying for the same vacancy at the same time , so I should try my best to catch the Human Resources manager's attention . 
 got it . I'll start right now . 
 I know , but these are the figures that we came up with . 
 I love dogs . They have been used as guards for centuries . Nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers . 
 Horses are useful to people too . We use them for sports and recreation . 
 Can you ride a horse ? 
 I can ride too . Perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend ? 
 Thank you for your hospitality , Leon . I had a wonderful time ! 
 What can I do for you ? 
 Well , this company can be dated back to 1893 , so it has a hundred years of history . 
 Oh , you look kind of pale . What's the matter ? 
 Do you ? Just a minute . Let me get the airsick bag ready ... Here . 
 Shall I get you some water ? 
 You have been doing a great job this year and I am very satisfied with your work . 
 Based on your contribution , I would like to give you a pay raise . Your monthly salary will be increased by 800 Yuan . This increase includes an 80 % married increase based on your achievements and increase responsibilities and then the additional 20 % increase were reflecting the changes in cost of living . 
 Please file all the reports for me . 
 Yes . Will you also make copies and file them using both methods ? 
 Good . Can you please also list all the documents in those old files ? 
 Before next Friday . 
 The NASDAQ gained a few points today . 
 It's hard to say . The stock market is weird . You never know what will happen tomorrow . 
 It's a kind of investment . If I choose a good stock and hold it long enough , I can get good returns . 
 I don't think we can . 
 By the middle of October , I think . 
 I understand . 
 But our factories are fully committed for the third quarter . In fact , many of our clients are placing orders for delivery in the fourth quarter . 
 I see your point . However , we have done more business this year than any of the previous years . I am very sorry to say that we cannot advance the time of delivery . 
 You may take it from me that the last thing we want to do is to disappoint an old customer like you . But the fact remains that our manufacturers have a heavy backlog on their hands . 
 All right . We'll get in touch with our producers and see what they have to say . 
 We had a difference of opinion . 
 She'll be fine . 
 I'm looking . Can you still remember what the conductor said ? 
 But I don't see it . 
 Oh , my god ! We get off at the wrong stop . I'm so sorry , honey . 
 It's my fault . So what can we do now ? Walk ? 
 OK , you promise don't tell your mother about it , we'll take a taxi . 
 If you keep your promise , I will also let you watch Ultraman this evening . 
 Are you new here ? I come to this coffeehouse often . But I didn't see you here before . 
 Do you mind if I ask you why you've taken the part-time job here ? 
 Oh , are you an English student ? Or you just study English for interest's sake ? 
 Very nice . Thank you for your time . 
 OK then . I don't want to put you in trouble . 
 OK . But I'd like some cookies . 
 I surely know that . Don't forget that I am a regular customer here . 
 It's OK . Thank you . 
 What's its name ? 
 What is it about ? 
 Sounds interesting . 
 Yes , do you have tickets ? 
 Let's go to the theater and buy two tickets now , shall we ? 
 OK . Let's go . 
 Please yourself . 
 Hi , Shirley . I'm Sophie . It's nice to meet you . 
 Please come in . 
 I really appreciate it . 
 I will . Actually , I am worried so much about the security of this community because my house has been burgled twice before . 
 Really ? That's good . Is there any supermarket in our neighborhood ? 
 That's terrific ! 
 Yeah , and we can get to know each other at the party . 
 But the ref didn't whistle . 
 Anyway , the host team seems to fight for the gold . 
 Is it a Chinese New Year's gift or a birthday gift ? 
 Oh , I see . Let me guess ... something sexy for the new bride on her first night of marriage ? 
 Well-endowed ? Don't worry . I have some bras with bigger cup sizes in the back . 
 Let me have a look . Can you see there's a stone in your kidney ? 
 No , but it's painful . 
 No , it's not necessary since the stone is not big . 
 Yes , you're lucky . But you should go to the Ultrasonic Department to disperse the stone . Meanwhile , I'll give you some herbal medicine . 
 What's the quickest way to get there ? 
 Can you tell me where the taxi stand is ? 
 Thank you . 
 I think we should buy some souvenirs to take home . 
 Good idea . I noticed that on our way to the tower there are so many shops selling all kinds of souvenirs . 
 Good afternoon . Can I help you ? 
 Of course , that's no problem at all . 
 How much would you like to change ? 
 Please fill in this exchange form , and I'll need to see your passport , and sign here . That's the money and your passport back . Of course , if you don't spend all of it , you can come back and we'd be happy to buy the local currency back from you . 
 I got stuck in a traffic jam . 
 It looks like you're very interested in the circus . 
 I have never seen those before , but since you're so excited it should be good . 
 Okay , I will go and get some popcorn first . 
 Actually , a friend of a friend . 
 Alecia . 
 Thanks . They look delicious . 
 That would be great . I would love some . 
 Quite well . I made good records in college . I won the scholarship in every semester . 
 Yes , I had taken finance courses in a training school . Compound talents are needed in the society and I must study continually to keep abreast with the times . 
 Taylor ? Taylor ! Is this a joke ? Is it really you ? But ... but ... everyone said you were dead ! 
 Oh , Taylor ! I'm so ... so happy . But then ... who's that ? 
 Do you like the food here ? 
 I am glad you like it . 
 Sure . It's $ 100 . 
 I have no idea . Maybe I will sleep for the whole day . 
 Sounds interesting . Who are the other people ? 
 Gorgeous ! What should I bring on that day ? 
 You mean , we can do many other things after the picnic , right ? 
 What are we waiting for ? Come on ! 
 This needs dry-cleaning.Can you remove this stain without harming the fabric ? 
 Ok , then . We ’ ll I ’ d also like to have this pressed . 
 No starch . 
 Could you put me through to Dan Aykroyd ? 
 Could you leave him a message ? 
 Could you tell him that Horst Weissmuller phoned . 
 Of course . It's H , O , R , S , T , then W , E , I , S , S , M , U umlaut , L , L , E , R . 
 Just tell him I'll call him when I get back from Australia . That's it . 
 Thanks . Bye . 
 Maybe I should go home . 
 Are you sure ? 
 Sounds like a good idea . 
 Thanks for reminding me . 
 You flatter me . 
 Mr Green , please . 
 What time you suspect back them ? 
 No , thanks . I'll call back later . 
 Ok , thank you.Goodbye . 
 Thank you very much for offering me this opportunity . 
 I have enjoyed talking with you too . Thank you . 
 Yes , please . My telephone number is 367 - 1314 . You can call me between four and six in the afternoon . 
 Thank you for your interview . 
 Happy birthday , George . Many happy returns of the day . Here's a present for you . 
 I hope you like it . Oh , have the other guys arrived ? 
 Let's go . 
 I like the apartment , but I see something wrong with it . 
 There ’ s a leaking faucet in the sink . 
 That leak is going to raise my water bill . 
 You need to fix it . 
 I won ’ t rent it if the faucet isn ’ t fixed . 
 I ’ m glad you finally agree . 
 Don ’ t touch that thermostat ! You don ’ t pay the bills around here ! 
 Put on a sweater ! I ’ m not gonna let you run up my heating bill just because it ’ s a bit chilly . 
 When I was your age , my parents didn ’ t have central heating like you do ! We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it . We used it to cook , heat the house and even dry our clothes ! We never caught a cold . You should be grateful ! 
 I'm not sure if I'm at the right counter , but I need some advice on mortgages , can you help me ? 
 A specialist ? That's excellent , thanks . 
 A black coffee with 2 sugars would be much appreciated , thanks . 
 Let me see it , can I ? This is a good photograph . Who are these people ? 
 What a beautiful ship ! Who ’ s this ? 
 Ah yes . The one who offered you a job in Australia . 
 Who ’ s this ? 
 It ’ s not you , is it ? 
 Why did you shave it off ? 
 I watched a very interesting documentary about plants yesterday evening . It was called unusual plants and looked at several species of plants from around the world which have unusual features . 
 Well . There was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them . 
 No , it isn ’ t . it ’ s a pity , because I ’ d like to see it in action . 
 They showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee . The insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar . Other insects cannot get it . Of course , when the insect molle 
 That ’ s right . That ’ s one reason why it ’ s so important to protect every species . 
 According to the documentary , they have an incredible ability to find water supplies , however small , and then store them without losing much through evaporation . 
 This is what my boss is expecting , Sandy . He wants a detailed list of expenses and equipment costs . 
 The sooner , the better , Sandy . I don ’ t think he ’ ll sign anything till he ’ s got that in his hands . 
 Hi , could you help me find a place where I could buy some lunch ? 
 I was thinking of pizza or something else Italian , maybe . 
 Good ! Where is it ? 
 That would be great . 
 I'm so hungry . Shall we go eat now , Rick ? 
 how about some dumplings ? I just can't get enough of them . 
 well , what do you have in mind ? 
 oh , it's too spicy for me . Don't you remember last time when I tasted the lamb ? It was so spicy my eyes teared up ! 
 sounds great . Do they serve noodles ? I am in the mood for some tasty noodles as well . 
 great . Let's go ! 
 Excuse me , when is the next train to Los Angeles ? 
 Can I get the ticket here ? 
 Thank you . 
 I'm getting sleepy . 
 Time difference also makes me feel weak . 
 It's four o'clock in the morning in Chicago now , but it's time to go to bed in Shanghai . 
 Let's meet tonight at the Thai restaurant at about 5 . 
 Why don't you walk ? It's only about 20 minutes walking and it's a nice evening . 
 Ha-ha , see you then . 
 I have , actually ; I ’ Ve always wanted to build my dream home myself . 
 well , it would be spacious and located next to a park , because a nice view is important to me . 
 I ’ d want it to have three bedrooms on a second floor with balconies on each , and one main bedroom on the main floor with an attached en suite . I ’ d also want a large living room and kitchen connected t 
 I ’ d have one guest bathroom in the basement , one attached to the main bedroom , and one upstairs , so a total of three . 
 I don ’ t like a lot of clutter , so I wouldn ’ t have lots of things out . I would have a few vases on the mantel piece and some pictures of my family on the walls , but other than that , most things would b 
 I think TV is a great waste of time , so I would only have one small TV in the kitchen to watch the news in the morning . 
 What're the teams ? 
 I bet AC Milan will lose . 
 Hold on a second , please . I'll see if he's in . I'm sorry , Mr.Baker had just gone out . Who's calling ? 
 Yes , certainly . What's that ? 
 OK , I'll have Mr.Baker call you as soon as he comes back . 
 You're welcome . 
 Oh , don't worry . I just killed a pigeon . 
 It spoiled my painting ! 
 I'm sorry , but there's no one here by that name . 
 Yes , this is . What number are you calling ? 
 Sure it is . This is 6666777 . 
 It doesn't matter . Bye-bye ! 
 I don't think we can meet the delivery date you suggest . It's too soon . 
 The earliest we can do is by the end of June . 
 The local newspaper has ads for housing . 
 Sometimes you can post an advertisement saying that you need a roommate . 
 Would you like an apartment for just yourself , or do you need it for two people ? 
 You should be able to easily find that for twelve hundred dollars a month . 
 Sure , I ’ ll go look at apartments with you anytime you want . 
 That would be great . I am really in the mood for a spicy hotpot . Any special reason for the invitation ? 
 It was my pleasure . How about this evening ? I feel very hungry now . 
 Ok with me . You are the boss . I will meet you downstairs after work . 
 Yeah . 
 Oh , my mother is a German , so I can speak German . 
 Yeah , I'm eager to learn Chinese , but it is too difficult for me . 
 Very Good . I'd like to do that . 
 How about tomorrow night ? 
 Would you like some cake ? I made it myself . 
 Thanks . Would you like to have one more slice ? 
 How many pieces of luggage do you want to check , sir ? 
 Ok.Is this your luggage properly labelled , sir ? 
 Ok.Would you please put all your luggage on the scales ? 
 Hand-baggage is not to be weighed , sir ... I'm sorry , sir , you're 25 kilos overweight . I'm afraid there'll be an excess luggage charge , sir . 
 Ten yuan for each kilogram.You ' ll have to pay 250 yuan for the excess baggage . 
 Here's some water . Take these multi-vitamins and Tylenol . 
 Your throat must be swollen . 
 Here , I'll break them up , so they're smaller . And here's some cough syrup . 
 I know , it tastes horrible . But it'll make you feel better . Try holding your nose . It won't taste as bad . 
 We want to look at some of your products . 
 Could you commend me some moisturizers ? 
 Yes , that's right . 
 Oh , very good . I will buy this one . 
 No . Thank you . 
 Can you believe the headlines ? 
 I ’ m reading about Michael Milliken , the Bond King . 
 He got arrested all right . 
 Yup , that ’ s him . He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless . 
 That ’ s the kind of thing in America that gets me mad . Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail . 
 I think that you look very cute today . 
 What store did you get it from ? 
 I love your outfit right now . 
 Thanks . I found these new shoes earlier at the store . 
 These are Chucks . 
 They only cost me about forty dollars . 
 Good morning . Can I see Mr Jackson , please ? 
 Yes . We have an appointment at eight o ’ clock . 
 Robert . Philips Robert . 
 Well , it has a lithium battery that lasts for 24 hours and it has a 160 second anti-skip mode for when you're playing sports . 
 Using MP3 mode , you can download about 10 hours of music from either your CD player , or your computer's hard disk onto one mini-disk . 
 You can choose from several play modes , or you can use the full-spectrum equalization , 3 D mode and Mega Bass features . We rec-ommend using it with the studio monitor headphones . 
 It's ultra-compact , it has a brushed , titanium metal body and a rubber shock-proof , weather-proof case with a belt clip . 
 Oh , no , surely . Your ideas were very interesting as well . 
 Oh , that would be lovely . Thank you . 
 Oh , yes . Marvelous ! 
 How long will the system be down for ? 
 That's fine . We've allowed forty-eight hours to be on the safe side . 
 No , but this is an emergency ! Please ! 
 OK , OK , fine ! Just open the gate ! 
 Thank god ! A car's leaving . It's my turn ! 
 OK , what does that entail ? 
 Yes , it does seem a little silly to cash it now . I'll probably need about 25,000 RIB . Will that be a problem ? 
 I'm glad you thought of this . I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest , right ? 
 Absolutely , Jenny . Thanks very much , I think you've saved me quite a lot of money today . 
 You need to make posters ? 
 I see . Then let's make a shoppinglIist first before we go there.othe rise , It may take us a whole day to search for the things you need . 
 Wow , it is like a maze , I think I might get lost soon . 
 Oh , yes . You are so smart . I see them . So I have to go to shelf number 3 first to get my markers , color pencils and highlighters and somebrushes . 
 It's at the back . I think you are near-sighted . You had better get yourself a pair of nice glasses . 
 I have no idea . Maybe I want to take a boat down the river . 
 Won't it be dangerous ? 
 That's better . 
 Yes , I'd like to settle my bill . 
 Sure . Here you are . 
 That much ! Would you mind letting me have a look at it ? 
 Thanks . Well , It seems to be right . How much is that in dollars , please ? 
 I see . OK . 
 In cash , please . Here you are . 
 By the way , please forward my mail to this address . 
 Where can I enjoy the best local food ? 
 Yes , I do . 
 Is it very far from here ? 
 How are you feeling , champ ? Ready to go ? 
 In what ? 
 Can you do the vault ? 
 Did you bring your certificate for nursing ? 
 How about your nursing education ? 
 Can you manage English conversation ? 
 I've found a nice place in this district.Three bedrooms , a large kitchen , high ceilings , a tile bath and a big drawing room . 
 What about the one on the Yellow River Road ? It's a two-bedroom one , and renovated building with an eat-in kitchen . 
 Do you mind if I open the window ? 
 Oh , that's too bad . Should I call a doctor ? 
 OK . 
 What about these ? They are very fresh and exceptionally juicy . 
 Very sweet . 
 These are a dollar each and those are 75 cents each . 
 OK . Anything else ? 
 Yes , we've just had some wonderful tangerines in from Tailband . Here they are . 
 Thirty dollars . 
 Really , what's wrong with it ? 
 Oh , do you use your computer often ? 
 Don't worry . Have you got receipt with you ? 
 We'll go to your house and repair it on Tuesday . Ok ? 
 See you then . 
 Hi David , this is Marge . Can you meet me after work for a few minutes ? 
 That will work . 
 That will be fine . What I have to show you will only take a few minutes of your time . 
 Yes . I just need to double check a few details with you . 
 Sure . It is helpful to shorten the distance between you and the interviewer and create a lively atmosphere . 
 But you should pay special attention to your words and attitudes . 
 In the interview , use polite words , such as ' Thank you ' , or ' Please ' . 
 When talking you should focus your eyes on the interviewer in order to closely watch his or her expressions . 
 Whatever the result is , you should keep your good demeanor . 
 In short , you should present the best of yourself throughout the interview . 
 Hold on a minute , please . 
 I am sorry to have kept you waiting . Mr . Johns needs a telephone call from you . 
 I'm afraid we have nobody available at the moment . 
 OK , we wait for you . 
 Um ... Hello , I would like to open an account . 
 I want to open a current account . 
 What's the minimum deposit for opening a current account ? 
 Well , here's 3,000 yuan . 
 OK , here you are . 
 Done ! What else should I do ? 
 OK . Thanks . Goodbye ! 
 Tell me about yourself and your past experience . 
 Why are you interested in this occupation ? 
 What do you think is the chief characteristic for a stewardess ? 
 Do you get angry easily ? 
 If a passenger had a accident , what would you do ? 
 If you are hired , when can you start work ? 
 What are your salary expectations ? 
 Hi . Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 If you could show me your details , please . What can I do ? 
 We can amend it for you as long as your customer agrees to the amendment . 
 That's fine . All you need to do is fill in this form and state the amendment . 
 No , I don't . I don't have a family , so I don't think I need it . 
 Thank you , but I've never thought about it before . 
 Being a diabetic , you're not allowed to eat certain foods . 
 I'm afraid not . 
 Can you recommend a resort to me ? 
 Have you ever been there ? 
 What is especially impressive ? 
 Is there a waterfall ? 
 What an attractive place ! How can I get there ? 
 Waiter , please bring me some toast . 
 Pardon ? 
 I see , bring me the whole wheat toast . 
 Milk , please . 
 It's supposed to rain . 
 Well , it won't last long . 
 Oh ! I heard that he loves to boss people around . 
 No sweat ! Think nothing of it . 
 You could have tried to explain to him about the new programmers . 
 You might be right . He does think pretty highly of himself . 
 I heard . But did you have to tear out his nose ring ? 
 How about the cinema ? 
 What would you suggest to see ? 
 Are you going out again ? 
 You mustn't go to bed very late . Can you be home before nine . 
 No . I won't let you ride a bicycle late at night . 
 OK . Here's the key . Take care . 
 I'm afraid I forgot to lock the door . 
 Sorry , Mum , I'll lock it right away . 
 I want to open a saving account , sir.What ' s the proper procedure ? 
 Is there any minimum for the first deposit ? 
 What is the annual interest rate ? 
 By the way , can I open a checking account too ? 
 I couldn ’ t believe you should crack such a joke to them . 
 You carried it too far . You obviously offended someone . 
 I know , I know . But someone took offence . 
 I'm looking for it , but you see , the market shard for jobs , too . 
 It's very dark in here.Will you turn on the light ? 
 Then , turn on the lamp , please . 
 It's there by the window . 
 Over there in the booth . 
 For a local call , just insert 35 cents in the slot and use it in the same way as your home phone . Inquiries are free from a public phone . 
 But where have you been , Alice ? You're over an hour late . 
 But why were you getting off work so late ? The office close at six , doesn't it ? 
 But didn't you tell him you had an appointment ? 
 Well , you're here . And that's the main thing . 
 This book is so good . I just can't put it down ! It's called ' The Power of One ' . 
 Me either . From the very first page , this author just pulled me right in ! 
 Yes . I'm in the last chapter now and it is just gripping . 
 Okay . But be prepared for an all-nighter ! I doubt you will want to put it down either . 
 I have no idea . 
 what seems to be the problem ? 
 what were you doing when it crashed ? 
 I think that might have been a virus . 
 what kind of computer do you have , a Mac or a PC ? 
 no , some people have Macs now , too . 
 PCs often crash from virus , but it's nearly impossible to get a virus from a Mac . 
 has your computer turned back on yet ? 
 did you end up losing any of your work ? 
 you should probably call the IT department and have them check your computer for virus . 
 Hello . 
 Hi , Troy . How ’ s your trip going ? 
 Are you all right ? 
 Yes . Everything is fine in the family . Don ’ t worry about the family . Just enjoy your trip . How ’ s the weather there ? 
 That ’ s good . Take good care of yourself . 
 I love you , Troy . 
 A friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days . He told me the other day he has learned a lot from it . He recommended me to subscribe to it . What do you say ? 
 Well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals . 
 Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . It seems that you need this course more than I do . I love my current job . If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance . 
 What is your corporation website address ? 
 Is there a dot after ' com ' ? 
 Are you sure that this is the place to wait for our school bus ? 
 But it doesn't look like a real bus stop . 
 How much is it going to cost ? 
 Is that yellow bus it ? 
 What do you think of your teacher ? 
 And I hear he gives very good lectures . 
 Jim and you are bosom friends , aren't you ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 Can you tell me a little about Paris ? 
 I want to see some of the famous places like Eiffel Tower , the Seine River ... 
 That's a good idea . I almost forget it.What else ? 
 Oh , wonderful ! How is the weather ? 
 Sounds exciting . I can't wait . 
 In America , most children start primary school at the age of five . 
 Kindergarten students usually only go to school for about four hours every day , but after that , they spend about eight hours in school every day . 
 no , most children in America only go to school Monday through Friday . 
 In most schools , they study about nine subjects . 
 some private schools require their students to wear uniforms , but public schools don't . 
 I went to a private school for elementary school and university , but went to a public school for high school . What about you ? 
 did you have to wear uniforms ? 
 at least you didn't waste time thinking about what you were going to wear every day ! 
 Greg . I want to speak to you for a minute . 
 I ’ m afraid there is , Greg . I don ’ t mind you taking a break . But you ’ Ve been away from your desk for twenty-five minutes already . 
 Sun-set hotel . May I help you ? 
 Hold on , please . Let me check it for you . Yes , you're right . You will keep it for 3 days . 
 OK , that shall be arranged . 
 I'd like to book a ticket to Singapore , please . 
 June 3rd . 
 Okay . I will book this flight . 
 Here you are . 
 Oh , how high class ! So you just wear it forever ? 
 Is it dry yet ? 
 They look fake . 
 I want to rent this car for 5 days . 
 By the way , do I have to return the car here ? 
 I'm sorry , but I can't come to your party . 
 How do you do ? Nice to meet you , Diane . 
 Well , I think you ' Ve reconsidered our proposal , Diane . 
 I should not be surprised , many customers have the same opinion . Do you have any suggestion in mind ? Our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable . 
 That's true . But if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product , you'll agree that 679 is not high , especially when we allow you a 10 % discount . 
 Well , considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600 . That's the best we can do . What do you think of that ? 
 Very well . Thank you . 
 Yes , I'm looking for a house . 
 Oh , to rent . 
 About 300 a month . 
 How big is it ? 
 Well , actually I prefer something a bit bigger if that's possible . 
 How much is it ? 
 What's it like ? 
 It sounds interesting . Can I go and see it ? 
 Good morning , Loans . 
 I would like to compliment you on your diligence . 
 Yes . And we're proud of you , Loans . 
 What is the matter with you ? 
 How long have you been like this ? 
 I think you've got a flu.Take this prescription to the chemist's and then go back and sleep . 
 Don't worry about your flu . You will be OK soon . 
 We are very interested in your printed pure silk scarves , so could you introduce us your prices ? 
 Please send us your best offer and state payment terms and time of shipment . 
 I'm waiting . Your early offer will be highly appreciated . 
 Are you going grocery shopping today ? 
 Yes , please get some white bread , thick cut , some ham , not the processed stuff , some gouda cheese , some galla apples and . . . 
 I'll treat you dinner . 
 Hi , this is ABC Company . Is that Joseph ? 
 I am calling to tell you that the interview for you is in our company on Monday morning at 8: 00 . 
 It is on the Jianshe Street where there is a Carrefour Supermarket near it . 
 Yes , the fried chicken is too hard to eat . I suggest you bring me another one free of charge . 
 OK . I will talk to him direcly . 
 It's user friendly . 
 Oh yeah ? What do you need to go shopping for ? 
 Do you know where you're going to find your bedroom set ? 
 There's no particular place that you want to look at ? 
 I can tell you where I got mine , if you'd like . 
 I bought mine from IKEA . 
 Not really , but you're paying for quality . 
 Yes , I was , Officer . 
 I was there as it happened . 
 The robber came in with a gun . 
 He had a mask over his face . 
 He was alone . 
 I would be happy to . 
 How long have you felt like this ? 
 It sounds as if you have a virus . 
 I'll give you something . I want you to take it easy and come back in a couple of days . 
 Good morning , Pete . 
 Ah , this is my daughter's birthday present . Her birthday is next week . 
 That is not for a while . His birthday is only in August . 
 And when is your birthday ? 
 My birthday is in June , when we are always on holiday . So my family often forgets my birthday too . 
 I'm just in the mood to act goofy . 
 I guess I'm glad exams are over . 
 Yes . I'm looking for a guide . 
 By the way , we want one who can speak beautiful Chinese . 
 Good morning , madam . I'd like to apply for a library card . Can you help me ? 
 OK . Here you are . 
 OK . Here is the money . And If I return the card , can I get the refund ? 
 OK . I see . Thank you . 
 Watch out ! You're too close to the fire place . 
 Really ? That's wonderful ! 
 Not at all . 
 Peter , where are you going ? 
 Won't you watch TV ? 
 The TV station will air the World Cup football match alive at 8: 30 . 
 The Brazilian team versus the American team . Don't miss it . 
 Who do you think will win ? 
 I think so . 
 I just stayed at home and watched TV . 
 yes , it was a very evenly matched game . 
 it ended in a tie . 
 it was three all . 
 if Barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won . 
 their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal , but he kept on playing anyway . 
 how many more games are left this season ? 
 when do the playoffs start ? 
 of course ! I really love watching football games on TV . 
 sure , that would be great . 
 Hi , Monica , congratulations ! Your presentation at the meeting was very successful and everyone was impressed by your speech . And it was so persuasive and I bet our clients will be convinced to invest their money in this project . You really made a big contribution to our company . 
 You must have been prepared for a long time . Some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find , right ? 
 Now , the effort pays off . You have accomplished something . 
 Lovely day , isn't it ? 
 You are not English , are you ? 
 Excuse me . How long has it been since the business was founded ? 
 So , it has a history for more than a decade ? 
 Hi . This is a Receptionist Desk . How can I help you ? 
 What ’ s the problem ? 
 I ’ m sorry . I ’ ll arrange a non-smoking room for you right away . The doorman is going to help you with your luggage . I do apologize for the inconvenience . 
 Can you help me out , Chuck ? 
 I want to put my desk over there , but it's too heavy for me to move . 
 There ’ s a letter here for you . 
 What ’ s the letter about ? 
 Tell me what it says ! 
 You ’ re lying . 
 Are you upset ? 
 I ’ m sorry you didn ’ t get accepted . 
 You have to help to the laundry today . 
 Have you decided on something ? 
 Sure . Anything else ? 
 Potato chips and French dressing . 
 You have gotten amazing success . Congratulations ! 
 Without a doubt . Relevant department will try their best . 
 All right , madam . When I was sales manager at the Beijing Friendship Store . I succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 % and profit margins from 50 % to 80 % . 
 I don't think so . I'll create further achievement in the future . 
 Yes . I got the title of " Advance Worker " in 2006 . 
 Yes . I wrote a thesis entitled " On Interpersonal Relations in the Socialist Market Economy " and it was published in China Daily . 
 Yes , that ’ s right . To be honest , the first year was quite tough for me . I was really just treated more like an intern . I didn ’ t have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating . 
 Well slowly but surely I proved myself , and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer . 
 Yes , I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . I spent 3 years in that position , but to be honest it wasn ’ t an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long-term . 
 I just felt that the paper couldn ’ t offer me any new opportunities . I really needed a more challenging role to be honest . 
 No , I am not eating there anymore . I have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner . The food served in the cafeteria is not my type . I am a total meat lover . But the cafeteria is doing its best to force me to be a vegetarian . They have been serving the Chinese cabbage and white gorse for three days . Haven ’ t you noticed that ? 
 Well , then the cafeteria suits you best . But anyway , if you like to have a lunch outside the company , feel free to join me anytime . 
 You are so kind . Thank you very much . 
 What's Tiananmen famous for ? 
 What's that ? 
 All the sightseeing in china is very attractive and crescive.travelling to China is very worth one.thank you so much for your guides , and I'll miss you . 
 At five . 
 Yes , they do . 
 Yes , I do . 
 Yes , they do . 
 O levels and A levels . 
 Three or four years . 
 Driving ? No way , it's too far . 
 Too long , and you do not have much time . 
 Could you show me my bill ? 
 Can I have it charged to my account , please ? 
 It's a lovely day , isn't it ? 
 I love it when the weather is like this.Why don't we sit down outside and have our lunch ? 
 I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado.but I must admit , this sure is a nice spring day . 
 Okay.Hey , is that a dark cloud over there ? Do you think it will rain after all ? 
 If the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend.It ' s been a while since I've not really gotten some sun . 
 Our meal was absolutely perfect ! 
 Dessert sounds perfect , but I would like to split something with my friends . 
 I think that the apple crisp would be wonderful . 
 We would also like a piece of chocolate mousse cake . Could you bring us four dessert forks , please ? 
 We are all tea drinkers . Please bring us four teas . 
 The hot drinks first would be great . Thanks ! 
 Of course . Go straight ahead . Turn right at the next street . You'll see a tall , yellow building.The post office is on the first floor . 
 Yes , you are right . 
 No , It's only about five minutes ' walk . 
 It's my pleasure . 
 I know . They ’ Ve already sent back two approvals I sent them . Where do I sign ? 
 Oh , right . I remember . There you are . Hope you don ’ t have as many problems as I had ! 
 Well , it is like a shop but the things here are quite cheap . 
 $ 5 . 
 Sure . Here you are . 
 Sure Paula , shoot ! 
 Yeah , What happened ? 
 And so ... 
 Hold on , Paula . It does sound pretty serious . But I ’ m sure you can work this out . 
 Sure , I ’ d be glad to help you straighten things out . Why don ’ t I stop by at about seven thirty ? 
 hi , Mary ! What do you like to do in your spare time ? 
 what a confidence ! I always watch a lot of movies , too . 
 actually , I watch whichever movie there is , be it a comedy , a sci-fi or a suspense movie . How about you ? 
 really impressive . These two genres are totally different . 
 how often do you go to the cinema ? 
 movie salon ? where is that ? 
 is it good ? 
 really ? Maybe I shall also sign up for its membership . 
 Hey , Paul , why the long face ? 
 Try me . 
 Take it easy , maybe tomorrow will be different . 
 Cheer up , I hope you'll feel better soon . 
 I learned to drive and I got a driving license . 
 Travel . 
 Is he ? He ’ s never been healthy . 
 I ’ m afraid he won ’ t make old bones . 
 Not yet . I am looking for a black suitcase . 
 Yes . I would prefer Nike . 
 Thank you . 
 Really ? 
 I will . Thanks for telling me . 
 What ! 
 Don't you dare tell me that ... 
 Well , they should have called you ! 
 And you didn't think to leave them my cell phone ? 
 It's the holidays ! Everybody knows how hard it is to get tickets ! 
 Trust you ! You can't even handle simple plane reservations ! 
 Welcome to Flower Power , sir . What can I get for you ? 
 Would you like them delivered ? 
 Do you want to sign the card ? 
 Ah ... very well , sir . I'll have them delivered this afternoon . 
 I'm sorry Marry is out right now . 
 Why don't you call back later this afternoon ? 
 Yes . We charge 50 cents for iced water . 
 Sure . Do you need anything else ? 
 I'll put all that into the bag for you . 
 No , there's no charge for those . 
 Sorry , sir , here you are . 
 Please wait a moment , I will bring you one . 
 Could I have a look at those pens ? 
 Have you got anything a bit cheaper ? 
 No , they're not quite what I want . Sorry to trouble you . 
 Did you say you saw lily alone ? 
 Where did you say she was ? 
 I must say I think that is very odd . Are you absolutely certain it was her ? 
 Because I don't want any , er , do you understand ? But you are quite sure , are you ? 
 Give me enough for a skirt , will you ? 
 Can you give me a discount ? 
 OK . 72 yuan . 
 No , Thanks.Not today . 
 ( Bob groans . ) What's the matter.Bob ? 
 What happened ? 
 Can you stand ? 
 We'll have to get you to a hospital for an X-ray . 
 It may be worse than it seems . How's it feel ? 
 Someone will be out to take a look any minute now . 
 Of course ! It's the sort of thing a hospital emergency ward is for . Will we have to wait much longer ? 
 Look at these newlyweds . They seem as if they are on top of the world . 
 People who have just got married feel that the world is right before them . 
 Do you have some good ideas of losing weight ? 
 Any more ? 
 Got it . 
 Well , it seems that I should do some jogging from tomorrow on . 
 Let me guess . You want to watch the History Channel again ! 
 Well , I guess I could tape The X-files and watch it later ... 
 Mysteries of the Pyramids . Didn't we watch this program last week ? 
 Well , sir . If you want to check out now , we will charge you $ 200 as well . 
 Well , the check out time is 12:00 o'clock everyday , if you checked out after 15:00 , we have to charge you for another day . 
 I had no idea how seriously that country takes soccer ! 
 Okay . In the middle of their streets there are parks , big soccer fields as far as you can see . 
 That's not all . They use them ! Every night men , women , children all out there till 3 and 4 a . m . 
 I don't know how they function the next day ! It's like they eat and breathe soccer ! 
 Yes I am . And you ... 
 So nice to meet you , David . Call me Bill . It's very nice of you to come here . 
 Thank you . I'm very glad to be here . As Ms . Tina said , the purpose of my presentation today is to familiarize you with the new EBB . As you probably know , EBB stands for Electronic Book Player . Our company put the original EBB on the market a year ago , but we have since all developed an improved model which we believe will be a big seller in both China and the U . S . 
 Certainly . First of all , the old model had a rather small screen , so not much information could appear at one time . So on the new model , we have made the screen much bigger and ... 
 Oh , there are many uses and I'll explain them in detail a little later . First , I'd like to ... 
 You were right , Mr . Tim . Your colleagues do want know all about it . 
 Yes.Do you sell stockings ? 
 Sure . Are those pantyhose made of artificial silk ? 
 Yes . I bought this sheet here yesterday . 
 Yes . When I spread it out back home , I found this hole . 
 Here it is . 
 That's very kind of you . Thank you . 
 Recently , there prevails ' Net Love ' ! 
 Two people chat on the Net and step by step fall into love ! It's Net Love . 
 Maybe yesterday you've received a man's woos . He's called ' Beast ' ? 
 I watched the screen display ! 
 It's typical Net Love , and a typical lesbians ' homosex ! HA ! 
 I have no idea what to buy for Mary for her birthday . 
 Yes , that would be good ! 
 If I remember right , she likes music , skiing , and reading . 
 Her roommate , Malia , might know what her favorite groups are . 
 Let's give Malia a call and ask her for her help right now . 
 Peter , wash your hands first , and then have some dessert . 
 Not today , Honey . Don't eat too much ice cream . 
 Ok . The last piece is for your dessert . We're having dinner soon . 
 The Cosby Show ? Wasn't it over many years ago ? 
 So how come it's still playing ? 
 Reruns ? 
 As we know , mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives . 
 Is it ? I've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone . 
 That's true . Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones . 
 People say that you never have a real winter in the South China , but I don't think so . 
 I did experience a winter with snow in Kunming , the Spring City . 
 Janice , I can't find the document I was working on last month . Can you help me to look for it ? 
 Yes , but I still can not find it . Maybe it is in this cabinet . 
 I am sure that document was filed . 
 Good idea ! It seems that I asked you to put it in Nova's files . 
 Honey , which hand should I use to hold the fork ? 
 Got it . It's so troublesome to have western food . I've been learning the table manners for hours but still can't really it . 
 Yeah . Which restaurant are we going to tonight ? 
 Fine . I believe in Cindy's taste . Oh , what should I wear ? 
 I don't want to mess it up . Please do it for me . I'm going to the bank to cash some money . How much do we need ? 
 Honey , you are a good accountant . So I'd better leave that to you , too . 
 I'll take care of the order . 
 Don't forget about the dessert . 
 Do you like shopping ? 
 Why don't you do your shopping at home ? 
 I mean you can buy things through the Internet , that is E-commerce . 
 Hi , I need broadband for my computer . 
 That's a problem . My laptop has no Ethernet port , it's wireless only . 
 Go ahead . I'm all ears . 
 That's great ! How much is it ? 
 Okay . What about the other alternatives ? 
 Yes , that's the ticket ! And if I need to print something there ? 
 Is this the right bus for San Francisco ? 
 When's the first stop ? 
 Thank you . 
 Sure , but only in the rear , and only cigarettes . And alcohol is not allowed . 
 Hi Kara , this is Mike . 
 Great , how are you ? 
 Kara , I had a great time the other night and was wondering if you would like to go out again this weekend . 
 Maybe I could help you with what you need to get done . 
 Would you like to go to a concert with me ? 
 Hey , Ken ... I need to talk to you . 
 Can we step into the conference room ? This is a more private conversation . 
 Ok ... I'm just going to lay it all out on the table , What do you think of Vincent's management style ? 
 I don't want to put you on the spot . Here's what I'm getting at , I don't think Vincent is the man for the job . 
 As I see it , he lacks the proper vision . His style is more about survival , and he's not taking the company anywhere.He ' s treading water instead of swimming . 
 I've been with this firm for 26 years and I'd hate to see it go down the drain due to poor leadership skills . 
 Yes and no ... We can't ask for a show of hands on who thinks he should be fired , but we can introduce a vote of no confidence at the next board meeting . 
 There is something wrong with my girlfriend . 
 The department manager is all over her . He says he loves her . 
 Of course not ! She thinks he's an apple-head . She doesn't like an apple-headed man , you know . 
 Hello . What can I do for you , sir ? 
 Sure . 
 No problem . I'm gonna need you to turn off your engine and open the hood for me . 
 Your oil is fine but your tires are a little flat . 
 Right here . I'll do it for you . ( Three minutes later ) Your car's ready . 
 Nine gallons of premium . That's $ 15.32 , please . 
 I didn't really like it . 
 I found it very disappointing . 
 I wasn't happy with it . 
 I have made up my mind . I am getting a tattoo . 
 Yeah ! Why not ? They are trendy and look great ! I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back . 
 Really ? 
 Oh , I didn ’ t know that ! I thought they just paint it on your skin or something . 
 Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing ! 
 Hello . My name is Jessica Smith . I ’ d like to cancel the newspaper . 
 8902365 . 
 845 lincoln Avenue . 
 Beginning the first day of next month . 
 How was your vacation in Paris ? 
 Hey Stacy . What's going on ? 
 Why ? You're not working so don't you have a lot of time on your hands ? 
 How about your husband . Does he help much ? 
 That sucks . 
 That's crossing the line . 
 Can you suggest a few exercise to help me get fit and stretch my muscles a little ? 
 I need to excise my arms too . How can I do that ? 
 When I do push-ups , should I bend my elbows so that my nose touches the ground ? 
 What ’ s a good exercise for my chest muscles ? 
 So I need plenty of space for this exercise . 
 Great . Thanks for you advice ! 
 Why do you need running shoes ? You aren't a runner . 
 That's not the same.Maybe you want to buy running-shoe-style shoes , but not real running shoes . 
 There isn't much difference . But there is some difference.For one thing , real running shoes are much more expensive.They have very lightweight materials.They ' re designed for serious runner 
 They look like running shoes.They have the same shape . And you can use them for running too.But they're not so serious . They aren't designed for serious runners.You can use them for exerce 
 That's right.If you want a really lightweight shoe , you should buy a high-quality running shoe . 
 But it's a waste of money . You won't really run in them ! You don't need such a shoe to use exercise machines . It's just a waste of money . 
 Well , do what you like.There are different kinds of New Balance shoes though.You don't have to buy the most expensive . 
 Your sister is a fitness expert , huh ? 
 I really think you are stubborn about some things.But here . Let's look at the New Balance shoes . 
 Yes , that's it . That's their top model . 
 Well , we can wait for the assistant to help us , or we can look through the boxes down here . What is your size ? 
 Well , here you are . Size six . Woman's . 137 dollars.Wow , what a waste of money ! 
 Mary is really a diligent girl . 
 She learns to speak Latin by osmosis within three months . 
 Wow ! That ’ s a pretty dress , but it ’ s too expensive . 
 It ’ s because of good quality and the fine design . 
 Anyhow , this dress is really elegant . 
 Yes , on Monday . 
 I'm probably going to spend the day looking at cars . 
 Yes , I am . I'd like to be able to get around a little more . 
 Oh , I don't know . Of course , gasoline costs a lot these days . 
 A lot of people do . I'll try it for a while anyway , but I certainly don't want to pay a lot of parking tickets . 
 Never mind about that . 
 No , I won ’ t hear of it . 
 Yes , that looks great ! Is it on our Open House list ? 
 Well , it looks great from the curb . Let ’ s go on inside . 
 OK , let ’ s go check out the kitchen next . 
 Make sure that you pick up a flyer with the information about the home . 
 Yes , it seems to have been discounted from two hundred and thirty-five thousand to two hundred and twenty-five thousand 
 I ’ m fine . Thank you . 
 I need to transfer money . 
 From my savings account . 
 I would like it transferred to my checking account . 
 I want to transfer $ 200 . 
 Yes . That will be all . 
 It's about time . 
 Oh , hi ! 
 Pleased to meet you . My name is Alice . Did you just move in next door ? 
 Me ? I guess so . I've lived here for about six years now . Have you lived in America very long ? 
 I teach mathematics at a college . What do you do ? 
 Well , Tom . It's good to meet you . I have to go now . I am teaching a class this evening , and I need to get to the college . 
 See you around ! 
 Well , how did you enjoy your seaside trip ? 
 Tell me about it , will you ? 
 Did you stop at the big waterfall for pictures ? 
 You were lucky then . What did you do after that ? 
 So you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday . 
 I hear Fred is a very good student in your class . 
 What do you mean by on the whole . 
 I'm going to the park to play baseball with the guys . 
 Yeah , but that was before the guys ask me to join the team . 
 You know how much I want to be on the team , and now there is an opening for me.If I don't go to practise today.They ' ll get someone else and I'll miss my chance . 
 I know , and I will . 
 After baseball practice . 
 No , I won't . I'm going to skip TV tonight and work on your chess game with you if that's ok with you . 
 No problem , I'll play as hard as I can and give you an extra game to say thanks . 
 Yeah , sure . Let's go . 
 All right . Now what ? 
 Which direction should I take ? 
 Tell me how far to go . 
 Okay , but let me know ahead of time . 
 That was great . Thanks for taking me driving . 
 You mean one for the city ? 
 I'm afraid we don't have any . If I were you , I'd try one of the newspaper stands . 
 Good Morning , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 How much do you want to change ? 
 It's 1 Australian dollar to 6.1 Yuan RIB . 
 The rate was 1 Australia dollar to 6.5 Yuan yesterday . 
 It does , sir . Do you still want to have it changed now ? 
 I don't know , sir . But it won't change much . 
 Okay . Please sign here in this form . 
 Here is the 6,100 RIB . 
 Hi , I'm George . I'll be your waiter this evening . Are you ready to order or do you need a few more minutes ? 
 And would you like an appetizer before your meal ? The soup of the day is our delicious tomato soup . 
 Can I get you anything to drink ? : 
 Okay . I'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad . 
 Did you like the party ? 
 Why ? What had you expected ? 
 Rachel has decided to quit smoking . 
 You never guess she is going to have a baby . 
 Yes , yes . She said she is going to stop drinking coffee too and quit all the unhealthy habits just for the baby . 
 Do you think we can get to the airport by 8 
 Is it the rush hour now ? 
 Wow , you ’ re up early today ! What ’ s for breakfast ? 
 Smells good ! I ’ ll make some coffee . Do you want me to make you some eggs ? 
 Www , I don ’ t know how you can eat your eggs like that ! Ever since I was small , I ’ Ve had eggs and soldiers . 
 You know what really drives me crazy ? When I ask for soft boiled eggs , and they overcook them , so they come out hard boiled ! How can you dip your toast into a hard boiled egg ? 
 Here you go , honey , fried eggs . 
 Hello Mei , How about going for a meal this evening ? 
 Ok that sounds good . Where shall I meet you ? 
 Ok great , I ’ ll see you at six . 
 Let's go in . 
 Good morning , everyone . We will get to destination in only one hour . 
 I hope that you had good journey . 
 Make sure that your customs forms are with you . 
 Before disembarkation , please get ready . 
 By the way , don't forget your luggage on the ship . 
 You will see the beautiful city . 
 Could I have a word with you , Madam ? 
 I have to tell you that I can't be in today and tomorrow . 
 I feel sick and coughed a lot at night . 
 Yes , I did this in the morning . And my doctor wanted me to have a rest these two days . 
 I hope so . And I will definitely tell you if I can not . 
 The road ahead is blocked . There might have been an accident . 
 Not really , but they are on the rise . 
 Vancouver is the third largest city in Canada . 
 There are many famous places such as Robson Street , Stanley Park , Gaston , Lion Gate Bridge , The Vancouver Art Gallery , and The Canadian Crafts Museum . 
 Sure , what ’ s up ? 
 Okay ... what makes you say that ? I thought you were pleased with his overall performance . Didn ’ t you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude ? 
 Well , I ’ m sure he had a perfectly good reason ... 
 Yeah , but come on , Geoff , as if you don ’ t check Facebook at work . Look , you hired this guy , we ’ Ve invested a lot of time and money in his training , so now it ’ s up to you to coach him . Make it work , Geoff ! 
 What's this city famous for ? 
 Where can we have the famous tea ? 
 Thank you . 
 Don't worry . Everything will be fine . 
 oh , Iris , it ’ s about the job with the PR company . 
 but my mother won ’ t allow me to accept any part-time job . I ’ m afraid she will say no again . 
 she says a part-time job is cursed blessing . It takes so much time and energy that I won ’ t be able to focus on my studys . 
 I turned down quite a few offers before for her sake . But I ’ m a senior now , I don ’ t want to miss the chance this time . 
 I ’ ll try , but what if she insists ? 
 do you think it will work ? 
 ok , I ’ ll do that . Thank you , Iris . 
 Can you offer me something a little cheaper ? 
 I want to stay under $ 20 . 
 What do you make of the case ? 
 What do you mean by saying so ? 
 Oh , yeah ? 
 We hope that there will be no repetition of this kind of trouble in the future . 
 We look forward to your settlement at an early date . 
 Mr . Wilson , here's a present for you . 
 I hope you will like it . 
 What's for dinner tonight ? 
 You're not going to cook ? 
 Yeah , and I love your cooking . 
 You're being serious ? 
 Okay , I'll make dinner tonight . 
 Do you want me to wake you up when dinner is ready ? 
 You keep bowling spares but no strike . 
 I don't think it was the problem with your hands , you did several excellent spares . You have no problem with your hands . 
 The problem is you are too nervous . You want to have a strike so much , so you deliver the ball too hard . And when it comes to the I second roll , there's no pressure . That's why you could bowl all those spares . 
 There is a new coffee shop opening up down the street . 
 That's right . You don't drink coffee , do you ? 
 What kind of things would you like to see on the menu ? 
 That shouldn't be too difficult . Since this is a small neighborhood , maybe they will take this suggestion . 
 Hey , let ’ s go to the night market after work tonight . 
 That reminds me I should buy some new socks to go hiking this weekend . 
 No kidding ! When did that happen ? 
 Oh , no . 
 Sixty two cars . Oath . Do they know how many casualties yet ? 
 That's amazingly low for such a huge accident ! 
 Well . We only accept the payment to be made by confirmed and irrevocable L \ C , payable against shipping documents . 
 I'm afraid not . That is our usual practice , because we are sure we will get the right amount of money that way . 
 We would like to do it in accordance with an F . O . B . 
 Wait for my instructions and then proceed accordingly . 
 I was in the Law School in Harvard University . 
 I want to be a lawyer in the future and the Law School was one of the best schools in Harvard . 
 How long would you like to keep it ? 
 Yes , that'd be all right . 
 I'm just fine , thanks , Jane . I'd like to make a withdrawal from my Current Account , please . 
 That might be a good idea , yes . 
 I think 2,000 RIB will suffice , thanks . 
 No , I don't think I have . But I would like to hear the full details , if you think it'll be beneficial to me . 
 Oh , we need an umbrella . The weather is so changeable in that area . 
 All right . 
 Oh , sure . How are you ? Long time no see . How are things at Lemans ? 
 No , not at all . Go ahead . 
 Well , I can't speak for all universities , but my salary is a definitely lower than at Lemans . I just don't think the salaries are comparable when you leave a major corporation . 
 I'd have to say yes and no on that . I don't get a big end-of-the-year bonus like I did at Lemans but I get to take classes for free if I want to . I've always wanted to get a graduate degree so I'm taking classes now to do that . 
 Yeah , I guess I am . Working at a university is really suits me . 
 I got a character part — some old lady who shows up in a few scenes . 
 Are you kidding ? You got the leading role . 
 I would trade you if I could but I don't think I'd be a very convincing macho A . 
 I do a good old lady . I wouldn't mind being the damsel in distress once in a while . 
 Yeah . I'm really looking forward to it . 
 They're pretty similar , but in different ways . I really can't decide . How about you ? 
 Does that mean work isn't that great ? 
 But work is a huge portion of our lives . I'm looking forward to making it fun . 
 I hope you're right . 
 Hi , Vince . Thanks for stopping by . How's the work coming along for the online auction ? 
 Can't Elvin handle it ? 
 Welcome to our Colonial Tramcar Restaurant , ma'am . Where would you like to sit ? 
 All right . Come with me , please . Here is your seat , ma'am . Would you like to order now ? 
 What would you like for a drink ? 
 What kind ? 
 Would Chablis be all right ? 
 What would you have for a la cane ? 
 Did you go to the movie yesterday ? 
 What did you think of it ? 
 I think it is the worst one I have ever seen . 
 I can't think the same . 
 I couldn't agree with you . 
 Is that so ? I didn't know it . can I possibly borrow a jacket and a tie ? 
 Then we'll return to the hotel and come back , will you change the appointment ? 
 At 7 , please . 
 A party of 13 . 
 Well , we've settled the problems of price , quality and quantity . What mode of payment do you wish to employ ? 
 Could you adopt D / A or D / P ? You see I have to pay a deposit when I open a letter of credit . That will tie up my funds and add to the cost of my imports , especially for such a huge order . 
 Anyhow , there would be certain bank charges . We've done business for years and you should have some faith in our credit . It would help me greatly , if you could accept D / A or D / P . It makes no difference to you , but it does to me . 
 I need a taxi , please . 
 No , thanks . A taxi is just fine . 
 I don't want anything except a taxi , thank you . 
 Rockefeller Center . 
 The sooner the better . 
 Great ! And remember , a taxi , not a limo . 
 We're leaving now . 
 Right . And would you please forward our mail to this address ? 
 Thank you . Goodbye . 
 Have you got anything to declare , madam ? 
 Have you got any wine or spirits ? 
 What about cigarettes or cigars ? 
 How many , madam ? 
 Does it look like a good fit ? 
 Yes , it is very nice . I'll take it . 
 Let me use my credit card . 
 No problem . 
 What is your greatest strength ? 
 Why do you say that ? 
 Are you ready to go shopping ? 
 What research ? 
 But they're just ads . 
 You ran the stop sign . May I see your driver's licence , please ? 
 That doesn't justify your violation . May I see your licence , please ? 
 Well , sir , your insurance looks good , but I still have to write you a ticket . 
 Hi . Are you new in this class ? 
 My name is Steven . What's your name ? 
 Very well . And my favorite subject is Chinese . 
 I guess English has fewer characters .

 Typical Francis , whether you are at work , or engaged in leisure time activities , you always show the same eagerness and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself . 
 Hello ! I need to make a copy of something at once . 
 Fantastic ! Is there a charge ? 
 Well , I'm only making one copy , so I guess I can afford it . 
 Cindy , can you show me how to call Connecticut ? 
 A good friend of mine is there on a homestay program , too . 
 Is it expensive to make out-of-state calls ? 
 What do I do here ? 
 That's it ? 
 How many people does your company employ ? 
 What's your annual turnover ? 
 It's raining . 
 How nice it is here 
 I ’ Ve heard the whether here is ideal , just like spring most of the year 
 so , your friend ’ s getting married on Saturday . What have you bought her as a wedding gift . I find is so hard to choose the right gift . 
 that ’ s clever ! Then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there ’ s no chance of two people buying the same gift . What things were in the notebook ? 
 so , what did you get them ? 
 what ’ s wrong with is ? 
 household appliance don ’ t seem to last for a long time nowadays . 
 I've booked an air ticket to Venice . 
 I'd like to stay there for a week . 
 Certainly . 
 So soon . Why don ’ t you stay a little longer ? 
 Oh . It ’ s pity you have to leave . 
 I'm glad you enjoy it . 
 When I have time , I sometimes draw and paint . 
 Every so often , I do . 
 I was taught in high school how to draw and paint . 
 Exactly , it was my favorite class . 
 I appreciate that . 
 Everyone has a talent . They just need to find it . 
 This one . It is of the best quality and excellently tailored as well . You may try it on . 
 The collar ? It is just the collar that is popular with young people in Shanghai . 
 250 Yuan . 
 But it is really worthwhile . 
 Here you are . 
 My dear , it's five flights up ! 
 Is the place well-furnished ? 
 What about the kitchen ? 
 Are the plumbing all right ? 
 The place is OK.Let ' s go there and have a look at it again . 
 Yes , we're making plans for a tour . 
 Well start out from Long Island this Friday . We've planned a four day drive to Salt Lake City , where we'll join my brother and his family on his fortieth birthday . 
 Oh , we'll spend the nights in hotels and enjoy local food as we pass by . How does it sound , David ? 
 Yes , we'll take our time . And we'll go to Five-lake Strict and the Wall Street . 
 You can say that again . 
 What are you excited about ? 
 Was this your first time ? 
 You ’ re lucky . 
 Because you turned 18 in an election year . 
 You didn ’ t ? 
 You should be , because you ’ re a part of history . 
 I can't sleep ... 
 Exactly . I'm too excited for Christmas morning . Also , I thought I heard Santa . 
 Well , I heard that naughty boys and girls get coal in their stockings , so I thought I'd be nice and make Santa cookies . I even left out some milk . I heard someone in the kitchen eating the cookies , so I came downstairs ! 
 Really ? 
 O-K ... 
 Dora , are you interested in going to the museum with me tomorrow ? I read the newspaper this morning . I know there is an art exhibition in Taipei Modern Art Museum . 
 I don't think so . I think we had better go there earlier , or we may have to spend a lot of time waiting . 
 Look at the ticket booth in the center . There seems to be not as many people as we thought it would be . 
 Good idea . 
 I have no idea . Let me take a closer look at my museum map 
 It's on the 2nd floor . We are going to see some beautiful paintings about the history of ancient Greece . 
 Tell me what ’ s the matter with you , Bill . 
 Come on . Let ’ s talk heart to heart . I think we can find a solution . 
 I am sorry to hear that , but face the music . 
 Yes , a little . 
 I tried before . There are no buttons on the air conditioning . 
 I think it is centrally controlled . They control it at the main desk . 
 I'm going downstairs for more drinking water . I will ask them . 
 They said it is centrally controlled.All the rooms are the same . They can't change it . 
 You can wear more clothes . 
 Coco Lee . 
 No wonder it looks so huge . 
 Why is it called Autumn Moon over the Calm Lake ? 
 Very romantic . 
 Sure ( They get on the boat ) . 
 You are right . That's the Heart of Lake Pavilion , situated on an islet.It was built in 1552 and is the largest pavilion on the West Lake . Oh , here we are at the Little Yingzhou island . Let's get off the boat . Please watch your steps . 
 Aisle A is where you'll find all the produce . 
 I don't know , but I'm sure the produce person can tell you . 
 Are you even glad that we get to buy new clothes too ? 
 They look really good on you . They look comfortable too . 
 Okay . I chose this swimming suit . Do you like it ? 
 Great and white ! Which reminds me , let's pick up some heavy duty sunscreen ! 
 We still have more to go , I think . 
 You're right . 
 I don't think so . 
 Maybe we did miss our stop . 
 I'm positive that we missed our stop . 
 My mistake . 
 I don ’ t really mind . 
 I suppose I could . 
 All right . If you really want to . 
 Nothing really , why , what ' s up ? 
 Sounds great , I'd very much like to accept your invitation , thanks , when ? 
 Do you need help setting up or anything ? I don't mind . I like to do that kind of thing . It's fun and I have a good eye for decorating . 
 Ok , I will see you then . 
 I'm sorry to interrupt you . Please take care not to make a mess while you are selecting goods . If you don't want it , please replace it . 
 What's the brand ? 
 Oh , it's out of stock at the moment . Why don't you choose another brand instead ? 
 You can have a try . Maybe you will like it . 
 Hi , I'm back ! Hmm ... your hair is pretty damaged , and you've got split ends . 
 Well , the trim should fix the split ends , but you might need a deep conditioning treatment . 
 I'm also going to add some layers to frame your face . 
 No problem ! 
 Really ? What can I do ? 
 Umm , OK . Whatever you think will help . 
 Can you use the thinning shears on top , too ? My hair is really thick . 
 Did you read the letter in the paper about smoking ? The person who wrote that must be crazy . 
 Maybe so . But a law banning cigarettes will do no good . 
 Do you have cheongsams ? 
 The styte is OK . Which country is this made in ? 
 Please wrap it . 
 I'd like to buy a shirt . 
 I prefer the blue one . 
 I'm not sure . Could you measure me , please ? 
 Can I try it on ? 
 Good evening , sir . 
 Yes , sir . Straight or on the rocks ? 
 Room service.May I help you ? 
 I am sorry for that.We will send someone to your room right now . 
 Hi , Stephanie . I hear you have a new job . 
 So how do you like it ? 
 Not bad . You know I'm an air traffic controller now . 
 Yes , but it's very stressful . 
 Sure , here they are . 
 Just this suitcase . 
 No problem . What about this carry-on ? 
 Can I have an aisle seat , PLS . 
 Thank you . And when is the latest time for me to board the plane ? 
 Thank you very much ! 
 Hello . miss . I am wondering if there is a meal served on this flight . 
 Well , I would like a glass of warm water . 
 Of course not . I believe he ’ s innocent . 
 He nursed a viper in his bosom . His best friend Tony foamed him in . Tony first seduced his wife and then trapped him . 
 Well , I ’ ll be glad to help you out . We can deliver what you need to your office . 
 Fine , I ’ ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on Thursday . 
 I really appreciate your offer , but I have to decline it , because I have already taken another job which I prefer to work in . 
 I will . Thank you . 
 We guarantee our product for two years . 
 Yes . All repairs are billed at cost . We'll only bill you for parts . The on-site service is $ 300 a year after the warranty . 
 Certainly . We always have the interest of the customers at heart . 
 That's right . 
 I did reporting for the university newspaper in my school.And I always be very interested in journalism . 
 I study the administration.Yes.But I'm more attracted to writing articles . I want to use my knowledge of business to write financial news . 
 I know that starting reporters work many hours . I'm very willing to take on the challenge . 
 It is 15 minutes ’ drive . 
 Mitsubishi , HP , IBM and many other famous corporations . 
 Yes , our company has two floors , the 6th and 7th floor in this building . 
 Yes , at the end of the hall . 
 I'm afraid I won't be free next week . 
 That's OK . 
 Air mail or surface mail ? 
 Please put it on the Scale there . Seventy five cents . 
 Oh , then it'll be one dollar twenty five cents . Thank you . 
 Yes , they are all on the shelf . 
 Yes . Here you are . 
 Yes , please wait a minute . I'll fetch it for you . Here it is . Please try it on and take a look at the mirror . How do you like it ? 
 If you think so , we'll shorten the legs a bit . It'll take about twenty minutes . 
 You're welcome , sir . 
 No . It doesn ’ t . There ’ s no through bus to the national history museum Madam .. 
 You can transfer at Cuchan Men . 
 Well , it ’ s only three stops from here . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 He appeals to the fans thanks to two things 
 Certainly not . What really counts is to play as a team , passing the ball amongst each other , dodging defenders . Free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts . However , a few free k 
 yes , his face looks are manly , with a straight nose and infinite eyes . As a man of medium height in the West , he keeps a powerful but elegant figure , looking neither lanky nor stout . 
 Why aren't you at work ? 
 Which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most ? 
 How would you solve the problem ? 
 It would probably be very expensive . 
 It ’ s not a bad idea . I think education is the biggest problem at the moment . Schools don ’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly . 
 Most voters what everything both ways . They want the government to pay for lots of things , but without increasing taxes . 
 Yes . The government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly 
 China Hotel . 
 Well , I think I'll take the bus this time just for a change . 
 Sure , Johnny , how much do you need ? five bucks ? 
 I don ’ t know about that ; with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ’ s just too much instability . I wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate . 
 Come on , son , you ’ re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point . 
 Why did the boss come down on Joe like a ton of bricks . 
 How did he know that he had bad mouthed him ? 
 He is then in a very difficult situation . 
 Thank you for coming . 
 I have a leaky pipe . 
 The pipe is behind a wall in my bathroom . 
 It began leaking a couple of days ago . 
 I know . 
 Not as long as it gets fixed . 
 Good morning , Doctor ! 
 I am not feeling very well . I've got a bad cold . 
 No , but I've got a headache . 
 Thank you very much . 
 How did you do on your driving test ? 
 That's great and it was your first try . 
 Sure . It ’ s quite far from here . Don ’ t worry , though . It ’ s not difficult to get there . 
 Yes . First , you need to turn around . Do you remember passing some traffic lights further up this road ? 
 That ’ s right . Drive back to the traffic rights and turn right . Follow the road for about a mile , until you see the plaza hotel . It ’ s a really big hotel . You can ’ t miss it . Turn left at the hotel . 
 Then you just go straight on until you see the station ahead of you . 
 No problem . 
 What news ? 
 You know what we will get ? 
 What docking station ? 
 Another big step forward in saving on our office equipment , I don ’ t need a desktop anymore . A laptop is enough . 
 I need to think it over . 
 All right . I'm prepared to , if the pay is reasonable . 
 No , he isn't . He's an engineer , the most famous one in our company . 
 May I help you , sir ? 
 By air or by sea ? 
 How about this wallet ? It's made of fine leather . 
 This gift is the best for a man who has everything . 
 Hey Bob . Whatchy doing ? 
 I didn't know you paint . What type of painting is it ? 
 That sounds so interesting . I wish I learned a hobby . 
 I think I will . Thanks for the info . 
 Hello , Miao Ping . Yes , I've been stuck in back to back meetings all day , but I really wanted to come and speak to you . 
 I'm interested in putting some of my money into investment tools , you know , something other than stocks and such like . Do you have any ideas ? 
 Yes , I've heard about that . Isn't it where many investors pool their money together ? 
 How can you help me to decide which areas to invest in ? 
 Is this the information here ? Well , let's take a look then ... 
 What's that ? 
 That's easy . Everyone knows that there are nice . 
 Nice try . I wasn't born yesterday , you know . 
 That sounds crazy . They can't just change their mind about things like that . 
 I suppose you're right . They also used to think that they were so important that the sun revolved around them , not the other way around . 
 Do you think that we'll one day be able to travel to another planet for a vacation ? 
 Do you think we'll ever get to meet an alien from outer space ? 
 You're so old-fashioned . That's what people used to think about people from another country ! 
 Mom , I'm starving . 
 My teacher had a sudden stomachache , so the class was cut shot . You ? 
 You are cooking at least two hours earlier than the usual . 
 Then it's for Dad , isn't it ? It's so unfair ! 
 What was that again ? 
 I'm sorry , I didn't know that . But I wanna help . 
 I'll get knee to knee with her . 
 shall we dance ? 
 oh . no as a matter of fact , i haven't danced for a long time . 
 thanks for flattering me 。 i think you dance much right ? 
 oh , i like this music very much , let's tango . 
 Why are you quitting ? 
 Hello . 
 What's up ? 
 I don't know . 
 No , Lucy . Don't get me wrong . I mean school will be open on Sept . 2nd , and I will have a very tight schedule by then . 
 That will be fine . When can I see him ? 
 Make sure you come here before noon . I will be picking up my friend at the airport in the afternoon . 
 By bus , of course . 
 Great . By the way , what does your friend do ? 
 Ok , see you then . 
 Good morning , I would like to make a doctor ’ s appointment . 
 I have been having skin problems that aren ’ t going away . 
 No . Except for the rash , I feel fine . 
 I would like to come in on Tuesday . 
 I would like to see Dr . Smith . 
 How many days do you take off for Easter ? 
 What will you do for this Easter ? 
 What do you want to eat for breakfast ? 
 You know that breakfast is the most important meal of the day ? 
 That's not a good excuse . 
 I just eat some oatmeal , toast , and orange juice . 
 It's good , and it's easy to make . 
 So , are you still going to have cereal ? 
 Why are you up so early , Mary ? 
 What are you watching ? 
 At least five channels have morning cartoons on Saturdays . 
 I agree . And some cartoons are entertaining even for adults . 
 Are you kidding ? It's too early for her . 
 You have not fulfilled your lease agreement yet . 
 There ’ s a problem with that . 
 I won ’ t be able to give you back your deposit . 
 This was stated in our agreement . 
 I can ’ t do that . 
 That ’ s not my fault . 
 Yes sir . How can I help you ? 
 OK . And anything else I can do for you ? 
 Sure . 
 I think my husband has some . 
 That ’ s true . If something happened to my husband , I might lose everything . Both of us have to work to keep our home , car , and our children ’ s education . I can ’ t afford that by myself . 
 Certainly . 
 I have a camera and three bottles of whisky . 
 Well , where shall I pay the duty for the whisky ? 
 I've paid the duty . Here is the receipt 
 Thank you . 
 I think so . 
 I'd love to . I heard about Halloween when I was in Beijing . It's kind of a children's day . Small kids get dressed up , then walk around with paper bags or baskets , knocking on the neighbor's 
 That's kind of cool . But what's the trick mean ? 
 That sounds kind of fun , maybe I can get tighter with my friends that night . 
 That does sound a lot of fun . 
 No , I'm afraid we'll have to cancel the order . I'm not sure whether it agrees with me . 
 I'd prefer swordfish steak . 
 Oysters , please . 
 I was nervous at that time . What about you ? 
 We can have a rest now after this tough interview . 
 Sounds like a good idea . And I think this can leave deep impression to HR . How can we write a suitable letter ? 
 I am getting to know your meaning . 
 Now , how would you like this check cashed , madam ? 
 Here you are . 
 Just make out a deposit slip and come here during bank hours . That's from 9 a . m . to 3 p . m . 
 I'd like to buy a toy car for my son . 
 It looks nice . How much is it ? 
 Oh , I'm afraid it's too expensive . Can you show me something cheaper ? 
 OK , I'll take it . Here's the money . 
 You don't look too well . What's going on ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . Have you been looking for another job ? 
 That's tough . What does your wife think about this ? 
 I have some friends who might be able to help you find a job . I'll see what they can do . 
 No problem . In the meantime , don't try to worry so much . You'll get through this . 
 That's right . I'm glad you're here . It hasn't been working properly for the last few days . 
 Just a couple of weeks ago . It's usually very reliable . 
 Well , it's making a strange noise when we try to change paper trays . 
 Hi , Monica , I got big news . 
 Not really , just take a wild guess . 
 Well , it is not going to happen so soon , I guess . 
 Ok , I lost 5 pounds . 
 It's our pleasure . 
 May I help you with something ? 
 What happened to this book ? 
 I ’ m going to have to charge you for the damage . 
 It ’ s only $ 5 . 
 I know it ’ s not . 
 Thank you for your payment . 
 I see by your resume that you have just graduated from college . I assume you haven't had any working experience . Is that right ? 
 Well , experience is not important in this job . We are looking for a man we can train to be a teller . By the way , do you like to work with figures ? 
 We are more interested in finding someone who is alert and quick at figures . Do you like meeting the public ? 
 We have very pleasant working conditions and I think we have a fine staff to work with . You would be assigned an experienced employee to help you . He would be responsible for training you . Have you studied English conversation ? 
 Yes , many of our customers are Americans , so you would be speaking English with most of them . Do you know anything about various kinds of savings and checking accounts ? 
 That's good answer . I appreciate your being frank . 
 OK.Take care . 
 Sure . The color is perfect for you . 
 It's made of cotton . 
 Hello , is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Single or double ? 
 Would you like to have your room on the top floor ? 
 Isn't it wonderful walking here ? 
 I mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us . 
 It's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ? 
 What other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ? 
 What's there after that ? 
 What are they all for ? 
 What can I help you with ? 
 What's your question ? 
 What do you need to take it for ? 
 You need six hours . 
 You have to do it in three days . 
 That's everything . 
 How did you enjoy your family party at “ ginger ’ s ” ? I hear that they have a lovely menu and buffet . 
 I like the buffets they have , but if often order a la carte , because I don ’ t feel extremely hungry . I like the wine list there too . 
 Some restaurants allow you to take your own wine and just charge you corkage , but the don ’ t do that at “ ginger ’ s ” . what was included in the seafood buffet ? 
 Did they have lobster ? 
 Yes , it probably is . I don ’ t like ordering oysters in restaurants . You never know whether they are fresh . 
 When you eat out , do you usually eat from the buffet ? 
 Oh , you don ’ t usually have a starter ? 
 Hello ! Can I help you ? 
 Oh , it's the high time for you purchasing in our clothes shop . We are now having a preseason sale on all our winter apparel . 
 Every thing for winter is 20 % off . 
 Sure , we have both skirts and trousers that would look well with the sweater . Look at this section . 
 You have a good taste . It's very much in style this year . 
 Look on the rack to the right . 
 It's ok . 
 Yes , and you must be James . It's nice to meet you at long last . 
 No , thanks . I'm fine . Did you have a nice holiday ? 
 I stayed in L . A . and it was sunny the entire weekend . We spent most of the time at home but we did go see King Kong on Christmas day . 
 It was better than I expected . But , you know , I think I would have enjoyed skiing in Tahoe even better . Do you go there often ? 
 I don't blame her . I really enjoyed it there when we went a few years ago . I'd like to go back sometime soon . 
 I like hitchhiking.will you go with me ? 
 It's a pity.Say , how about a place near enough ? 
 New England . 
 Excuse me , Professor . I think there might be an error in my test score . 
 I think that the percentage is incorrect . 
 Sure , let's do it . 
 I don't see any mistakes . 
 Yes , let's total it . 
 Yes , you're right . 
 May I help you ? 
 How long is your journey ? 
 The popular tour of the season is a 14 - days ' sightseeing to Venice . Are you interested in that city ? 
 I'd have a look at some pots and pans . 
 What kind is most durable , please ? 
 I'll have the stainless ones . They look very solid . 
 Excuse me sir . May I come in ? 
 I'm sorry , but my sister was ill , so I 
 But it's true . 
 That's coincident 。 
 I promise I will . 
 How were things in the Tokyo branch when you were there ? 
 Do you see the trend continuing over the next few months ? 
 Why would you say that ? 
 I'll say ! Sometimes they just do things really differently . But one thing I can say , they are really hospitable . 
 Sure ! I just got back yesterday . I'm still suffering from jet lag . 
 Ok , on that day , boys usually give roses to the sweet hearts and girls give them chocolate to return . 
 Yeah , that is the holiday is hot , isn't it ? 
 Good morning ! I'd like to buy twelve tickets to Beijing for October 14th . 
 Well , the express one , with air-conditioning . 
 When do they arrive in Beijing ? 
 In that case I think Train No . 14 will be better . We can do more sightseeing in Beijing . 
 In a cushioned sleeper , please . 
 Hello . Mr . Higgins , please . 
 Oh yes , this is Penny's Pet Boutique . Please remind him that his appointment for his dog's shampoo and cut is on Saturday morning at 11 am . 
 That's fine . 
 Over here is our gym . We have all the latest equipment . 
 Certainly . We have here the race apparatus , stationary bike , muscle builder set , chest expander , bar bell , dumb bell and so on . 
 Here's the swimming pool . It's open from 10 a . m . to 11 p . m . There are also massage rooms here . 
 Do you have any particular conditions that you would like our company to take into consideration ? 
 All right . If we decide to hire you , we'd pay you two thousand and five hundred yuan a month at the start . You can have Saturdays and Sundays off . Besides , you may have a paid month holiday every year . How do you think about it ? 
 Well , we'll give you our decision in a couple of days . It's a pleasure to talk to you , Mr . Liu . 
 Hello , Kevin . 
 Thanks . You too . 
 Let me see . It's £ 800 per set CIF London . 
 Usually the commission is three percent of the net invoice amount after deduction of discounts . 
 Considering our good relationship and our future business , we give you four percent . That's the best we can do . We can't go any further . What would you say to it ? 
 I've been accepted by the university , and they've offered me a position on the basketball team ! 
 Mom , what are we going to make tonight ? 
 That sounds nice . I can peel the potatoes first . 
 Mom , the water is boiling ! 
 Welcome to IBA . Can I help you ? 
 Thanks . I'm sorry to say that you need to get this stamped . There is no stamp on this slip and it is essential before I can process it for you . 
 Yes , that's right . Down here , at the bottom right hand corner to show that you agree to pay the printed amount . 
 Diana's Flowers , Diana Lin's office , may I help you ? 
 No , she's out for lunch . May I take a message ? 
 Ok , I'll make sure she gets the message . 
 Are you looking for a small , medium , or large pan ? 
 Does this one look big enough ? 
 Well , what do you think of the aluminum pan ? 
 Here's the same pan , but it has a space-age , heat-resistant plastic handle . 
 I'm so happy that you found what you wanted . Do you want to use a credit card ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry . Here's the lid . Yes , it comes with the pan . 
 Sure , what's up ? 
 Good question . I have to think about it . 
 France ? Is he crazy ? 
 Well , how can I put this ? France is a terrible team . 
 I want to have a two-day trip around the city . 
 It's interesting . I think I will take the bus tour . By the way , what about the lodging ? 
 Do you know about All Fools ' Day ? 
 April fool ! 
 You should have seen the line at the housing office.It took me an hour to make my dormitory deposit for next year . Have you made yours yet ? 
 Why not ? There ’ s not much time left . Are you short of cash ? 
 You ’ d better hurry up if you wanna a dorm room next September ... 
 Do you have any idea how much that would cost ? 
 You should study in the library the way I do . Think of the money you ’ d save . 
 I hope you will have second thoughts . 
 Can you do that in the mornings , or would the afternoons be best ? 
 There are a number of open houses this weekend in your area . Would that okay with you ? 
 We could meet at the real estate office , or I could pick you up at your home . 
 I can think of five houses that we should look at . It will take most of the day . 
 When I have confirmed the times with the owners , I will e-mail you our plans for the day . 
 It ’ s good . But to tell you the truth , I don ’ t wear perfume . 
 That ’ s all right . Thank you all the same . 
 Don't worry yourself too much . 
 Hello , Steven . Congratulations ! 
 How's your married life ? 
 That's very good . It's said that marriage is the Ab of love . But the words may not be right . 
 Sandy . Do you have a minute ? 
 Not much . I just wanted to see how you were . How ’ s married life treating you ? 
 Hello , sir , what can I do for you today ? 
 No problem ! We have a broad selection of suits , all tailored made so that it will fit perfectly . 
 Very well sir . Would you like to have some shirts made also ? 
 Very good . Now , if you will accompany me , we can take your measurements and choose the patterns for your suit and shirts . 
 Well . I am breaking up with Cathy . 
 No . She is really a very nice girl ... 
 Well , you are right . But sometimes she is too caring . Well , no ... she ’ s just possessive and I kind of want a break ... you know ... for some room for myself . 
 I've tried , but it didn't work . 
 Maybe tonight . I don't know . I don't know how to tell her . 
 I know ... 
 Yes , I'm still working there . But I really find my job boring . I'd like to change my job . 
 I think I'm quite fit for a driver . 
 I don't care . 
 I haven't told them . Maybe I'll make them know after the vacation . 
 You just need to send an application . 
 Yes . You are expected to know the e-mail address of the company . 
 Yeah . 
 Well , if that's the case , I don't mind breaking the image that they might have or the standards that they have . I can only do what I know , and live how I've lived all my life , because I'm a fairly stubborn person . 
 I don't go to parties . The parties I go to are the barbecues I have in my house . Being seen in the right places is something that I don't believe in . I don't believe in going to events just for the sake I of being seen . 
 Yes . I have a very low-key life ; I have a great life . I love what I do and I love how I spend my time , which isn't in a public place . 
 I've never had one person that I'd idolized . The comparisons to Jul-ia Roberts are incredibly flattering . I don't really know who I would compare myself to . I'd like to be a combination of a lot of people . A little bit of everything , really . I haven't quite figured out where my strengths are yet , and I've definitely found my weaknesses . 
 Yes , I ’ m the manager here . What can I do for you , Madam ? 
 Which room are you in ? 
 I ’ m awfully sorry to hear that . I ’ ll turn to it right away . 
 Do we have to type out our homework ? 
 Is there anything else ? 
 We are allowed to use a calculator in class ? 
 How was your first date , David ? Are you satisfied with Jane ? 
 Yes , so I think she is suitable for you . 
 Stop acting like this . Say away ! 
 What did she say ? 
 Give her up . 
 I am not sleepy . 
 There is no way that I can fall asleep right now . 
 It won't work . I'm nowhere close to being tired . 
 What if I stay up and do something , until I get tired ? 
 I'm going to get to sleep eventually . 
 Good night . 
 Please come in , Mr.Jackson . 
 Did you ever get a parking ticket ? 
 What's a few ? 
 Did you pay your fines ? 
 How much are the parking tickets ? 
 That's expensive . 
 You should probably pay the fine soon . 
 You've met her before , haven't you ? 
 Welcome . Can I help you ? 
 Yes , here are what we have exclusively for our guests . 
 Sure . Take as much as you want . They are free gifts from this shop . 
 Please try the shop there . They might have them . 
 No , their cards are for sale . 
 You're leaving so soon ? I wish you stayed a little longer . 
 Have you got the ticket ? 
 What time are you going ? 
 I'll pick you up by nine o'clock and take you straight to the airport . 
 OK , goodbye . 
 Very well , do you know any shorthand ? 
 Can you use the computer or other office machines ? 
 Yes , I see , this is a permanent position . 
 Oh , no , I ’ m student at a university , and I have to study most of the time . I can only work part time . 
 Amy , you don't look so well . What happened ? 
 Do you feel anything else ? 
 Have you had similar feelings before ? 
 Don't worry . I believe you are just not agreeing with the local climate . I will get you some medicine . You will be alright after a good rest . 
 Can you imagine a boat letting in the river ? 
 Sure thing . I have an experience like that . 
 I was in such a panic at that time . Fortunately another boat came along and I was saved from drowning . 
 They sure are . They are practically jumping in the boat . 
 We're catching most of our fish with lures . 
 What kind of live bait are you using ? Worms or minnows ? 
 Are you having any luck with the worms ? 
 That's too bad . Why don't you try using lures instead ? 
 That's too bad . Well , where are you fishing ? 
 We went out in our boat . I have a favorite fishing hole out there . 
 Oh no , I can't tell you . It's a secret . Say , why don't you go over by the lily pads and try fishing there ? 
 Sure , I used to catch my legal limit of bass there all the time . 
 Good luck . I hope you each some fish . 
 I know what love it . When I was young , I felt the same way . 
 You are , why not ask for a date ? 
 it certainly was a great party . It ’ s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here . 
 I doubt it , I ‘ ll deal with it right away . Luckily it wasn ’ t a glass of red wine , I ’ ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth . 
 afterwards , we can do the washing up together . Everything will be finished within an hour . Your friend Keith is really funny . I liked his magic tricks . 
 Amanda told some very funny jokes . At the beginning of the party , she was being ver serious . 
 what did you put in that punch ? It tasted great , but was quite strong . 
 very much . The birthday cake was delicious , wasn ’ t it ? Emily told me that she and karen made it themselves . 
 all cleaned up . Are you ready to start on the washing up . 
 We need to talk about the size of the country and its population . 
 It says here that most of the people are han Chinese , but there are 55 minorities that make up almost 10 % of the population . 
 We could divide into five parts . There ’ s the northeast , which is mild in summer and very cold in winter . Then there is the northwest , which is largely desert . Tillet is famous for its mountainous climate . The rest of the country can be roughly divided into two parts . One is temperate-mild in winter and warm in summer . Then , in the south it is hot most of the year . 
 It is , buy remember that we only have a few minutes to make our presentation . We can select cities from each part and give data for each one . 
 Yes . The other large cities are Chengdu , Dalian , Wuhan , tianjin , shenyang , Chongqing . Hongkong and Guangzhou . 
 Good morning ! What's wrong with you ? 
 How long have you been like this ? 
 Do you have a fever ? 
 Let me take your temperature first . 
 I received a bachelor's degree . 
 I received my bachelor's degree from Peking University in 2004 . 
 No , I'm full . My stomach isn't growling at me any more . 
 I'm all set . Thank you for the dinner , Jack . 
 I really think all Americans look alike . 
 But they do . 
 They wear the same clothes , they ’ re all blond , they all drive cars , they all own Parker fountain pens ; they all drink Coca Cola , and they all chew gum . 
 Maybe I am just homesick . I know you ’ re right . I just miss China , that ’ s all . 
 I hope so , do you have a shopping skirts ? something i could wear working in a ban ? 
 It is nice , may i try it on ? 
 Does this fashion really fit my figure ? 
 Oh , thank you , just shows you what is going to max jemmy redate for all this body . 
 I thought you recognize she from there . 
 Yes , it is really good for my arms and shoulders , ok , i will take this one , do you have a blue in this size style ? i want one for my sister , she has a great figure and she loves blue . 
 Oh , good , do you have a discount for two ? 
 That is great , i will take this two , how much is that ? 
 Ok , 90 dollars , do you accept this card ? 
 Debit card . 
 No , thanks . 
 Thanks , you too , how see your maxes sometime . 
 Thanks , byebye . 
 That ’ s great . 
 I want to go back to school . 
 I haven ’ t decided yet . 
 I ’ m never coming back . 
 I realize that . 
 Thanks . Things are going to be different now . 
 What's the problem ? 
 You need change . 
 Yes . It costs fifty cents for the washer and a dollar for the dryer . 
 You put the coins into the slot , push it in , and it will turn on . 
 There's nothing else to it . 
 You're welcome . Let me know if you need anything else . 
 Not really . I could take it or leave it . 
 How can you do that ? 
 I want to change my hairstyle . What would you suggest ? 
 Do you think it will suit me ? 
 Ok , I'll have it for a change . 
 Uh ... yeah . Hi ! Is Susie there ? 
 Oh . I'm sorry . But is this 321-9987 ? 
 I am really sorry . 
 Did you get a chance to speak with the sellers about my counter-offer ? 
 Did they accept the counter-offer ? 
 How much will that cost ? 
 Can I choose the home inspector ? 
 So , when are you going to inform the owners of my acceptance ? 
 Who do you think will win the championship ? 
 There's a game on tonight . You want to watch it with me ? 
 good afternoon . “ ginger ’ s restaurant ” . May I help you ? 
 certainly . For how many people ? 
 I ’ ll just check . At what time on Friday evening ? 
 yes . That ’ s fine . We can book you a private room for up to ten people at that time.Could you give me your name please ? 
 yes . Do you intend to order a la carte or will you be having our seafood buffet ? 
 Did you watch the Premiership last night ? 
 No , it wasn't . Rather , it looked like a Bundesliga match , where physical contact is so frequent . English League teams are apt to pass the midfield quickly with long passes . It seems to me English soccer players are very gentlemanly . As Diego Maradona spoke teasingly , they often knew only chasing hard after the ball , but forgot to steal it . 
 Which team do you back then ? 
 But the Reds keep a weak midfield . I think Juventas of Italian Series A have always maintained a very formidable midfield . It is the main source of its strength . 
 what ’ s wrong , Jim ? 
 Twenty minutes just to find out what their business hours are ? 
 Oh , I hate getting voicemail instead of a person.What did you do ? 
 Couldn ’ d you choose to be transferred to a real person ? 
 Mary , please go to the door . I hear the bell . 
 Give it to me ... How wonderful ! He's coming to visit us . 
 He's coming by car on the twenty-fourth . He's staying from thetwenty-fourth to the twenty-sixth . 
 No , he's coming with Aunt Cynthia and the girls . 
 Your cousin Fay is fifteen . Rosemary is older than Fay . She's seventeen . 
 Of course . The girls can stay in your room with you . 
 If you like , but now we have to think about meals and many other things . 
 Mary , it was wrong of you to be so late . Mother ’ s very worried . 
 I don ’ t really like Henry . I like my Rose . 
 But my Rose is great . 
 Really , Mary , you ’ re horrible . 
 Do you like cooking ? 
 I don ’ t like it.It takes up too much time and I really hate having it clean up after the meal . I can ’ t stand doing the washing up , drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away . 
 So what kinds of dishes do you usually make ? I know you like Italian food . 
 Do you find it hard to get ingredients for Chinese food ? 
 How long does it take you to cook a meal for 5 or 6 people ? 
 Welcome to IBA Bank , how can we be of service ? 
 What I need you to do first is fill in these forms , with as much detail as possible . Then we can get you a new card . 
 I'm sorry , Sir , the full procedure can take up to 7 days to process everything . 
 If you bring some ID with you , it's possible for you to make a withdrawal over the counter if you need to . But unfortunately , without your new card you cannot use the ATM , so all withdrawals must be made within working hours . 
 Well , last night I had a big argument with Ann . 
 Now that I look back at it , it wasn't that big a deal . I shouldn't have lost my temper . 
 It's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while , and we decided we could both make it this weekend . Then out of nowhere she called me up , said her boyfriend had made plans and that she need to cancel the trip . I was so angry when she told me that I said she didn't care about our friendship at all . 
 I know , but I was so upset . I mean , come on ! Does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ? 
 Well , I think I was being a little selfish myself . I know they don't get to see each other very often . 
 Yeah , I'll call later to patch things up . 
 I know something about it . Our company often organizes all kinds of lectures to improve our professional skills . 
 Is that true ? 
 If that information is exact , I guess our company is willing to promote someone . 
 Where are they from ? 
 What are they doing in Beijing ? 
 Which hotel are they staying at ? 
 Did you go to the basketball game on Friday ? 
 You missed a really good game . 
 Our school did . They played really well . 
 Yeah , you should have . It was really exciting . 
 The score was 101-98 . 
 That's what made it so great . 
 Mom , did you feel the earthquake this afternoon ? 
 The breaking news just reported some houses were destroyed by the earthquake . 
 Do you think we can donate some clothes and food for the victims ? 
 What stresses you out the most ? 
 How so ? 
 You have to deal with a lot of pressure from your parents . 
 Ever since I brought home some bad grades in elementary school , they never expected much . 
 What do you do to deal with the stress ? 
 That sucks . You wanna go grab a beer ? 
 Do you have this design with only one breast pocket ? 
 It's a pity . I'm afraid that's too loud for me.Thank you . 
 What channel did you watch last night ? 
 How do you feel about it ? 
 Well , I don't think much about it . To me , it's a sheer waste of time 
 Variety shows and talk shows , I think . 
 Oh , hi Kim . How ’ s it going ? 
 Ok , sure . When did you have in mind ? 
 Why don ’ t ’ we say the 3rd around 2:00 p . m . ? 
 Great . Talk to you then . 
 What are you going to buy ? 
 I'm probably going to buy something too . 
 I want some sort of candy . 
 I want some chocolate . 
 I'm going to get a Snickers or a Kit Kat . 
 I'll just get a Snickers then . 
 I am ready to make my plea . 
 I plead not guilty . 
 I realize that , but I am not guilty . 
 I had nothing to do with the crime that was committed . 
 I ’ ll tell you if you let me go . 
 I am willing to tell you that information . 
 Yes . But not too much . It is considered as the head of five sacred mountains in China . 
 Because in history , the Chinese emperors used to climb onto these mountains and pay tribute to their ancestors and pray for good harvest and prosperity for the whole nation . 
 Definitely . There are many wall paintings and inscriptions on the huge rocks on the mountain . 
 That is easy . You can go directly to Tai'an city and buy a ticket to Mount Tai . 
 No problem.madam.But I think the red sweater is not colorfast.Would you like to have it dry cleaned ? 
 I will bring them to your room tomorrow afternoon . 
 Which subway should I take to get to the East Side ? 
 Which train is that ? Which platform does it leave from ? 
 Sorry I was late for the meeting today . I got stuck in traffic . 
 I am here to tell you that the clothes are very much to taste of our market and the customers are quite satisfied with the excellent quality . 
 Well , we have an extensive sales organization and a thorough knowledge of Asian market . Your products would sell very well here . We are prepared to do more business with you . We are also interested in handing a sole agent for you . 
 No problem . 
 I'll be leaving on the fifth of August for the vacation 
 I'm taking two weeks now . but I want to save the other week and take it sometime during the winter . 
 To the beach 
 Oh , I don't need to do that . I'll be staying with friends 
 Just think , in a few days , I'll be swimming and lying in the sun and just taking it easy . 
 Yes , I didn't know Washington , DC got so cold in winter . 
 I really think we should take a tour of the White House . 
 Of course . But today I feel like seeing the White House.We should see it first , because it's the most famous historical building here . 
 Boring ? How can it be boring ? It sounds very interesting to me . 
 Sure , what kind of shoe are you looking for ? We ’ Ve got strappy sandals , sleek high heels , edgy pumps , or if you ’ re looking for something a little more practical , we ’ Ve got Mary Janes , ballerinas . 
 Ok , right this way . What color did you have in mind ? 
 Of course . We ’ Ve got this style here that is very popular . Because it ’ s an open-toe shoe , you can wear it any time of the year . They look great on everyone . 
 OK , these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two-inch heel so they are very comfortable . 
 What size ? 
 Here we are . How does it fit ? 
 Have a nice day , Ma ’ am . 
 Yes , but I'm not sure what exactly I would need . 
 That would be a definite bonus . 
 How can we do that ? 
 No . 
 That sounds great . Thanks . 
 I know that they are auspicious fish . It's quite popular nowadays . 
 Not at all . I think the tattoos are so cool and chic . 
 Honey , it's not so serious . It's just an animal . 
 OK , I understand , but what else could we do ? 
 We would like to book a table for 6 at 7:00 in the evening . 
 Can we bring drinks by ourselves ? 
 All right . Thank you . 
 What size ? 
 What colour ? 
 I ’ m sorry . We don't haven any . 
 Did she buy them here ? 
 We had some shoes like those a month ago , but we don't have any now . 
 I ’ m afraid that I can ’ t . They were in fashion last year and the year before last . But they ’ re not in fashion this year . These shoes are in fashion now . 
 They are very uncomfortable . But women always wear uncomfortable shoes ! 
 Why ? 
 Don ’ t make a mountain out of molehill . I am sure he will do that on his payday . 
 Oh , Thank you . I'm looking for the train station . 
 Right ? OK , got it . 
 Next left then right ? OK . 
 Thanks , Mark . I used to be a member of the school choir . 
 Well , you are flattering me . I wouldn't say I am a professional , but I did receive some training at school . My music teacher used to be a professional singer . 
 You are quite right . 
 Yeah.It is the very latest in digital video cameras . 
 Getting cheaper is not the only reason for their popularity.They come with a lot of inviting functions . 
 They offer clearer and sharper images . Many of them also have up to 20x optical zoom lenses , a photo mode and fast-action mode . 
 Right ! Anyway , the basic difference between a digital camcorder and its traditional counterpart is that it speaks digital . 
 This means digital camcorders can be connected with the digital equipments you have at home , like your digital TV or your computer . 
 Sure ! And without any conversion process or loss of quality ! You quickly find , cut , and record video segments and create slide shows . Some camcorders even offer editing software for adding titles and special effects . 
 Like creating a sepia tone look and some special effects such as fades and dissolves . 
 With the development of the broad band Internet , you can easily upload your video files to websites or e-mail them to relatives or business partners . 
 You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law . You have the right to have an attorney present during questioning . If you cannot afford an attorney , one will be appointed for you.Do you understand ? 
 What's your name ? 
 What's your nationality ? 
 What's your relationship with the victim ? 
 Why did you attack the victim ? 
 How many times did you stab the victim ? 
 Did you know hat your actions might cause serous injuries or death ? 
 Was it your intention to kill the victim ? 
 OK.Give me his number and we'll contact him . 
 My family is not big , there are only 3 of us-my parents and I . 
 My father supports the family , and he is the sole breadwinner . My mother is a housewife . 
 Yes , we live a happy life together . 
 What time ? I ’ d like to go , but my calendar is really full today . 
 I ’ ll try to make it . I should be able to fit some time in around 3 o ’ clock . 
 I want to leave . We've already been here two hours . 
 I would rather buy them somewhere else . 
 I don't like shopping in malls . I like shopping on the street . There is more variety . 
 Alright . 
 The styles here are too boring for me . I told you . I like street shopping . 
 Sure I would . 
 Do they have it in LARGE . 
 Where is the fitting room ? I don't see it . 
 Okay , I will try it on . 
 I look like a nerd . 
 Well , I don't think it's the best style for me . 
 Alright . Alright . 
 Yes , maybe . But I like street shopping . There is more variety . I'm sorry . I just don't like malls . 
 No problem . What floor ? 
 Oh , so am I . 
 Yeah , I know her pretty well . 
 What does a housing go for in south mountain district ? 
 We ’ re looking for a three-bedroom home . 
 Under 300,000 RIB , we suppose . 
 What about a two-bedroom house ? 
 I see . 
 Okay , I will take it into consideration . 
 It is very common in the winter in Ottawa . 
 Don't you think we ' d leave for the concert now ? 
 In about 25 minutes . 
 Be quick . Put our bags in the deposit box . 
 I told you to hurry up a thousand times . You just put a deaf ear to it . 
 I surely did ! Ask the customer service counter if we can deposit our stuff there . 
 It's all your fault ! Now we can't get in shopping . 
 That sounds like a good idea ! 
 What color do you want ? 
 May I speak to Mr . Smith ? 
 What time do you expect him back ? 
 Ok , I have the number . Bye ! 
 Let's eat the kind that has both spicy and mild broth in one pot . 
 Yep . That way I can satisfy my craving for spicy food and you can eat hot pot without burning into flames . 
 Good afternoon , how can I help ? 
 Of course . Your balance is 92,320 RIB in your Securities Account . How much would you like to withdraw ? 
 No problem . Please fill in this transfer form that will authorise us to send the amount from the Securities Company to your account . 
 Do you live in Pasadena ? 
 You could always take the 264 . 
 It goes all the way there . 
 Catch it on Altadena Drive . 
 Now you know . 
 No problem . 
 I want to apply for a passport here . 
 ( 10 minutes later . ) Hi . Here are completed forms . 
 Here you are , But I forgot my photos . 
 OK . I am going right now . 
 Which one will you be going to ? 
 Sure , I've been meaning to visit that place myself . 
 OK , can I bring a date with me ? 
 Yes . that is a very good idea . It would be a shame if we could not find a place to sit . 
 I'll be there . Oh , is there a cover charge at the bar ? 
 I want to make sure I bring enough money for my date and I . 
 One last question.Is there a dress code there ? 
 Perfect . I wanted to have a casual evening tonight . 
 Okay . See you then . 
 Yes . I would like to go to New York for my Christmas vacation . 
 1 week . Would you recommend me scenic spots to see there ? 
 That's fantastic . 
 Thank you ! The same to you . 
 I've been invited over to a friend's . And you ? 
 I can ’ t make out anything , the words are too light . I thought they have already changed the toner cartridge this month . 
 Ok , no problem . We do it ourselves . 
 Check with somebody from the IT department . They are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment . 
 This is Wang Ling speaking.You satisfy all the requirements . Congratulations ! You're hired . 
 I think you'd be perfect for this job . This company needs someone like you . When can you start working ? 
 Very good . You will normally be sent an official notification of the results of your interview by post . Once you get the notification , you can come . 
 See you . Bye . 
 Come on . Cheer up ! 
 That's no problem at all . May I have your name , please ? 
 It's a pleasure , Mr . Sandals . My name is Michelle . What days will you need a room ? 
 One minor problem , sir . Our prices are now slightly higher . Is that acceptable , sir ? 
 It'll be $ 308 nightly . 
 Good ! Now , sir , do you have a preference for smoking or nonsmoking ? 
 I hear you , sir . Nonsmoking . Now , about the bed , is a queen-size okay ? 
 Okay , sir , let me reserve those dates , there . Now , if you'll just tell me your phone number . 
 That's 626-555-1739 . Thank you so much for choosing our hotel , sir ! 
 It is in that brand new , tall building over there . On the 9th floor . 
 It is the basement of that red building in front of the tower with big bells . 
 The Computer Center is on the first floor of the library . 
 The library is next to the Adminstration Building . The Adminstration Building is over there near the school ’ s main entrance . There are school maps for free in the lobby of the Admin . 
 Sure . Glad to be of service . By the way , my name is Mike Sullivan . You will see me around a lot . I am running for President of the Student Government . 
 Thanks you for the encouragement . 
 Have a good day . Bye-Bye ! 
 It's ok . It seems we have a lot in common . 
 He is tall and slim , fair-haired . 
 He is a nice guy and very considerate . I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor . 
 He didn't say , but he said he would call me . 
 Oh , steve . Stop it ! I am a bit nervous ! What if he doesn't call ? 
 Thank you , Steve . You're always so encouraging . 
 I have a real problem when I meet people . 
 I never know when to shake hands and when not to . Can you tell me something about it ? 
 Oh yes . Men , women , and children shake hands all the time . 
 But some women do shake hands . And now a lot of children have such good manners , they shake hands too . 
 That sounds easy enough . 
 Merry Christmas , Linda ! 
 Linda , thank you for this wonderful Christmas dinner . I really enjoyed it . 
 Let's get this card for mom , it's funny . 
 Do you mean girly ? 
 Are you for real ? 
 I think we should each get our own card . 
 What is up ? 
 Oh , don ’ t be angry . I just thought you might need them sometime . 
 All right , let's see who's ruining my TV time . 
 Is your boss named Vic ? Your pager says , This is Vic . Here I come ! 
 Here , see for yourself . That's really strange ! It's almost the same as when I ... 
 It sounds that you have a high opinion of him . 
 Birds of feather flock together . 
 You cannot judge a person that way . I have a hunch that he is a sly dog . 
 You can never tell . He might do you in when he sees an angle in doing it . 
 No , it isn't . 
 Oh , no . This is going in the opposite direction . 
 I suggest you get off at the next stop and ask again at the station . 
 Hello , reservation desk . Can I help you ? 
 What day would you like to reserve the suite for , sir ? 
 I ’ m sorry , sir . We can ’ t accept reservations for next Friday due to over booking . May I suggest another hotel , sir ? 
 Please hold the line . I ’ ll see if there is a duplex suite available on that day . ( a minute later ) Sir ? Holiday Inn is available for your need . 
 I ’ ll give you their phone number . It ’ s 601 789 5634 . 
 I ’ d like to book a room . 
 What ’ s the rate for a standard room ? 
 I ’ d like a standard room . 
 December 23rd , please . 
 4 days . 
 Nancy Brown . My phone number ’ s 709 678 5634 . Nancy Brown 。 
 Around 3pm . 
 No , that ’ s it . Thank you very much . 
 Yes , may I know your name ? 
 Let me see your passport , please . 
 You come from Germany , don't you ? 
 How long will you be staying in China ? 
 OK . Have you filled in the Declaration Form ? 
 Is this your luggage ? 
 What do you have in the luggage ? 
 That's all . Thank you for your co-operation . 
 Fine , just get it ! We have been shopping for furniture for five hours ! I ’ m so tired ! 
 Fine ! I am going to go home and drop off this nightstand , coffee table and love seat while you look for the rest of the things . 
 While you are at it can you pick out a nice recliner ? I really want one so I can watch TV . 
 Hello ? 
 What are you doing in Australia ? 
 Oh , right . What time is it there ? 
 Yes - four o'clock in the morning . 
 That's OK . I'm awake now . 
 Where to , sir ? 
 Please hop in . 
 It ’ ll take about 20 minutes . 
 Yes , they are . 
 Yes , it is . Are you in a hurry sir ? 
 Yes , sir . 
 Oh , hello , Mr . Campbell . I'm fine and Jack's doing well . How are you ? 
 Yes , I'm leaving at four pm . 
 Yes , me too . 
 I just dropped in to say goodbye . 
 I ’ ll leave at ten o ’ clock . 
 Thank you , I will . Hope to see you again next year . 
 Usually for lunch , we don't have to reserve a table , they should allow walk-ins . But to be on the safe side , I'll order a table for half-past twelve . Will that suit your schedule ? 
 Are you planning on treating the investors to a full-course meal ? 
 That'll be pretty heavy for a mid-day meal , don't you think ? 
 With your prime rib and chicken choices , you'd better hope nobody's vegetarian . 
 John ? Can you come over here for a second ? 
 I need you to take a look at these samples . I think there are a few problems . 
 How do I look ? I love these braids . They're fun ! 
 An Ethiopian restaurant ? Whoa ! I always think of starving people in Ethiopia . 
 That's so ironic ! Well , what's it like ? Is it your traditional food ? 
 Good afternoon . 
 Speaking . 
 Let me check my diary . Er . I'm afraid I can't make Tuesday . I've got to go to Beijing for a conference . I'll come back on Thursday . 
 Yeah , that would be fine . What time ? 
 Yeah , that's fine . Next Friday at 12 at Garden Hotel . I'll look forward to it . 
 Sure , Stacy . Let me just grab my coat . 
 Don ’ mention it . I ’ m glad to help . 
 Didn't you just eat ? 
 We ate everything from dinner . 
 What are you going to make ? 
 Go make a sandwich . 
 Why don't you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ? 
 Maybe you should . 
 Let me see . 
 Good morning , Steven . 
 It'll be a national campaign starting next week . 
 I suggest that we focus on slice of life , showing how you can beat the summer heat by biting into a cool ice-cream sandwich . 
 Definitely . 
 What did you find ? 
 Go and try it on . 
 I love that shirt on you . 
 They don't really fit you right . 
 That blouse is absolutely wonderful on you . 
 That would be a good idea . 
 No , you don't . Just fill out this card and sign your name and room number on it . 
 Yes , will this do ? 
 Wait a minute . This is your safe box key , don't lose it . You'll have to pay two thousand yuan if you lose the key . 
 How do you celebrate Thanksgiving in the US ? 
 Do you say prayers before dinner ? 
 What is the biggest fun for you on Thanksgiving ? 
 Guess what ? 
 Mr . Smith , this is your schedule . 
 Do you have any different ideas ? 
 I like spring . 
 Oh , everything comes back to life in spring and the weather gets warmer . 
 Hi , Victor . How are you ? 
 So , are you going to go to class tonight ? 
 Really ? What's the matter ? 
 Listen . Come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner . 
 I want to change rooms immediately , plus a refund for tonight . 
 I'm knee-deep in cockroaches ! 
 Thank you . I'm glad that this hotel strives to keep its reputation intact . 
 Steven , what are you thinking about ? 
 That's easy . A girl at her age must like beautiful ornaments . How about a hair pin ? 
 Well , what about a brooch ? 
 Maybe you should ask her what she wants for her birthday . 
 Hello . Mr . Zhang . It's Mary . 
 I'm afraid we're really staffed this week , Mr . Li . I'd like to meet you , but I'm sorry I really can't . 
 Not at all , sir . I'd just like to delay our meeting to next week , I'll have time at the beginning of next week . 
 How about Monday morning at 9 a . m . ? 
 Why'd you run into me ? 
 You have completely damaged my car . 
 You don't see what happened to my bumper ? 
 You smashed my bumper in with your car . 
 Your bumper looks exactly the same . 
 Give me your information , in case I don't hear from you . 
 How delicious ! Tender and crisp ! 
 Yes , it's really savory . 
 Ok , honey , time to take down the Christmas tree . 
 Come on , it ’ s losing needles all the time and the branches are sagging . 
 A good atmosphere ? The tree is falling apart , and it ’ s messing up the room . 
 But Christmas was two weeks ago ! It ’ s been there only because we ’ Ve been too busy to get rid of it . 
 But it ’ s falling apart , and the cat keeps playing with the lower branches . 
 Yeah , it was a good Christmas . It won ’ t always be this good , but we can ’ t make it last longer than it should . 
 I ’ ll make a deal with you . We ’ ll leave it up until Sunday , and then we ’ ll take it down after church . 
 Hello , Helen . This is John . How are you ? 
 Fine , thanks . I ’ ll have a party next Sunday at home . I ’ m calling to ask whether you can come or not . 
 Okay , now you are a famous star . 
 What ’ s wrong with you ? 
 Okay . 
 good morning , Gav ! Did you sleep well last night ? 
 that's great news ! You look much more relaxed than you did yesterday . 
 what's that ? 
 that's annoying , but nothing to worry about . 
 just breathe deeply when you feel yourself getting upset . 
 is there anything else bothering you ? 
 do you have any other plans this weekend ? 
 try not to take on more than you can handle . 
 I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there ’ s something wrong with the fax machine . 
 Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ? 
 What did you do this weekend , Kate ? 
 That sounds nice . Where did you go ? 
 Not really . I just worked on my car all day . 
 But then what would I do every weekend ? 
 Yes . I've had one for as long as I can remember . 
 I actually like having a curfew . I have an excuse to get to bed on time . 
 I don't like being too tired the next day . 
 If you stayed up much later , you would see that just about every-thing closes around ten anyway . 
 Me , too . I overheard someone say Taylor has a brain tumor . 
 That could explain all his stomachaches . He's trying to hide it from us . 
 No , but someone said he was in the men's room puking . Follow me ! 
 It was hard work . 
 It took three of us to move it . 
 True . When I tell my kids to behaves themselves , they will make a face and slip away . 
 What's the problem , Nada ? You look down in the dumps . 
 come on , nothing can be that bad . 
 ok , I promise . So what's troubling you so much ? 
 really ? Is he married ? 
 then what's your problem ? 
 oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip . 
 office romance is very tricky . 
 cheer up , Nada . You'll be fine . 
 Yes . in some sense . I should say I like mountain climbing , you know , because I'm not so professional . How about you ? 
 How did you spend the night there ? 
 I had a similar experience , but that was on the top of Tasha Mountain in my country . 
 Yes.It IS one of the Five Mountains . 
 I'd love to . 
 Yeah , I think it will be wonderful . 
 No , thanks . I'm just looking . 
 No , thank you . I don't need any skirts . 
 No , thank you . 
 No doubt . Look , I'm just browsing . If I need your help , I'll let you know . 
 Excuse me . Could you please tell me how to get to the nearest cinema ? 
 Will it take me long to get there ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 hey , Lily , what are you doing ? 
 you mean the boy you met on MSN ? 
 you must be joking . You can't fall in love with someone you've never met ! 
 I think it's just a crush . You can't be serious . 
 did you tell him ? 
 you shouldn't take it too seriously . It might be a lie . 
 I think you should enlarge your circle of real life friends , and then the right person will come along . 
 Could you tell me my account balance ? My account number is ... 
 Emily Smith . 
 Thank you . I want to make a withdrawal of 150 dollars . 
 Thank you . 
 Actually , it could have been better . 
 It is a new restaurant . I don't think they have their act together yet . 
 I felt that the food was pretty mediocre . 
 I agree . The service was not good . 
 No , I think that I've had enough of this restaurant . 
 I ’ Ve been getting really short of breath , and my coach wanted to have a doctor check me out . 
 No , I have been pretty healthy . I just have trouble taking a really deep breath . 
 Peaches make me break out , but I don ’ t have any other allergies . 
 I ’ Ve noticed that it is worse when I am under stress , like during finals week . 
 I appreciate the referral , doctor . 
 How is everything going on ? 
 You look prettier than before . 
 Excuse me , but I'm not feeling too well . I think I'm going to throw up . 
 I must've missed it . 
 Yes . I'm going to San Francisco . 
 Hey , I'm feeling much better already . 
 Thanks . By the way , my name is Mary . 
 Could you fill in this form , please ? 
 Have you got any identification ? 
 How about we taking a tour to Hawaii ? I have a 2 - weeks ' vacation . 
 Me , too . Why don't we get ready now ? 
 how was school today , Dominic ? 
 why ? What happened ? 
 it's just one exam . Can you re-take the exam ? 
 why didn't you do a good job ? 
 do you think you studied enough for the exam ? 
 what did you do last night ? 
 did you study at all last night for your exam ? 
 I am sure if you had studied , you would have done well . When can you re-take your exam ? 
 alright . Get out your books and I'll help you prepare . 
 With this ring I thee wed . Wear it as a symbol of our love and commitment . 
 This one ? 
 Oh , right . This one , right ? 
 Okay , Okay , I got it ! This is the ring finger ! 
 I haven't received my credit card bill yet . 
 My Master Card . 
 I never got it . 
 What am I going to do since I haven't received the bill ? 
 Can I get an extension on my bill if it does happen to be the post office's fault ? 
 Thanks for everything . 
 How can I help you ?

 Who's that man over there talking to James ? 
 He's very handsome , isn't he ? What's he like ? 
 Really ? I love eccentric people . 
 Why ? What do you mean by that ? 
 Heard what ? No one ever tells me anything . 
 Really ! How fascinating . 
 Well , what can I say ? I didn't know . Oh , I meant to tell you earlier , your blouse doesn't really match your skirt . Those colors don't really suit you either . 
 No , Dave . I haven't wrecked my jeep . I'm calling to offer you a job . 
 I'd like you to manage a new online auction site we're building . 
 Don't play hard to get . The pay is good . You'd be working with Elvin again . 
 Elvin doesn't hold a grudge , if that's what you're worried about . 
 Of course ! 
 My vote was for Barack Obama . 
 I had no doubt in my mind that he would win . 
 Nobody could compete with him . 
 Times are changing . 
 I support our new President 100 % . 
 Hello . I've been told to come in and see someone about my L / C . I just had a message to come in and see someone called Kristy . 
 I received a letter asking me to come in and see you . I'm Mr Simons from Dalton's Electrics . 
 Oh dear ! Where should I go from here ? 
 Hey , Cindy , I ’ m so sorry about yesterday . I shouldn ’ t have yelled at you in front of everyone . 
 I don ’ t know what happened to me . I just lost it . 
 Yes , you ’ re right . Good night . 
 Hello , could I speak to the export manager , please ? 
 This is Joey from Mary trading company . I learned that you are the leading export of cloth by Hummed company . 
 We are interested in cloth made in China . The clothes are sold very well here . We are a big location supplier for the northeast market here . I'm thinking that we'll have some business opportunities . 
 No , it's too loud in here . 
 This is him speaking . 
 Yes . I am very glad to have the chance . 
 Hello . Can you help me ? 
 Oh good , come in , please . 
 Hi , Cindy . It ’ s Michael Kurt . Is Mr . Johnson in ? 
 Yeah , that ’ ll be great . I ’ m on extension 4283 . 
 Hi Steve . This is Mike . What are you doing ? 
 There's nothing to watch right now . 
 Me too . Let's get together and do something . 
 Yeah . Let's plan something tomorrow . 
 I think it is going to be the same as today . Clear and sunny . 
 Are there any special events going on tomorrow ? 
 Oh yeah . I heard about that too . Let's go check it out . 
 It starts at one PM . 
 Perfect . I'll see you in front of the apartment at eleven thirty . 
 Let's have a look . Oh yes , you need a 10 mm ring spanner . Here you are . Just leave it on the workbench when you finish . 
 No problem . 
 You should try to put your best foot forward , and be careful of your personal appearance . At least you should get yourself dressed up . Appearance isnt everything , but it's the first thing an interviewer notices about you . 
 Don ’ t boast and don ’ t be modest . 
 Appear confident and show the interviewers that you ’ re competent . Don ’ t exaggerate things or you'll give the impression that you ’ re talking big . 
 Try to be natural , alert and interested . 
 My pleasure . Good luck to you . 
 They are in aisle 5 . 
 When do you usually go to the movies ? 
 The movie theater is always so crowded on the weekends . I like to go to the movies during the week . 
 This place is so quiet and peaceful . It ’ s really different from my pad at city . 
 I don ’ t know . I don ’ t mind coming out here for a while , but that will get old pretty soon . 
 I think I ’ d go lonely if I do like that . 
 Now that would be hard to live without . We city folks are pretty spoiled . 
 Did you hear the news ? Two of our major suppliers , Murphy Music and U-Tunes are merging ! If they are conglomerated into one company into one company , it would have some serious affects on our market strategy . 
 I read it myself on the financial page.They ' re really going to join together . U-Tunes was bought out by Murphy's , they will take over the company as of next month . 
 I guess they must have figured it would be easier to merge than to keep up the cutthroat competition.If you can't beat'em , join'em . 
 I wouldn't say that.They seem to be on good terms but actually they always speak ill of each other . 
 Could you change these for me , please ? 
 Twenties and some smaller bills , please . 
 Yes . Could you tell many balance ? Here's account number . 
 Can I have Mr . J . Smith paged ? He said he'd be in the main dining room . I'm Mr . J . B . White . 
 Mr . J . Smith . 
 To the front desk . 
 Mr . Wang , have you enjoyed your stay here ? 
 We ’ Ve all enjoyed being with you . When will you come back ? 
 I ’ m looking forward to seeing you again . Take care . 
 Hello . Mr . Rodriguez ? 
 Yes , sir . I ’ Ve just dropped those slides off at the Winthrop office . Do you need anything else while I ’ m out ? 
 Let's go ! 
 Hey , Ben ... did you catch the game last night ? 
 Baltimore defeated Texas by 17 points ! 
 Football of course ! 
 No , I'm talking about American football . The World Cup is soccer . 
 So Chinese people prefer soccer or basketball ? 
 Oh , certainly . I wouldn't miss a game for the world . My girlfriend says I have an addiction . And actually , if I had to choose between her and my games ... I'd probably pick football . 
 Oh , yeah ! I think the love of sports starts when kids are very young . Americans come from many different backgrounds so I guess sports are something we can all enjoy together . 
 I ’ m sorry sir . This computer is not broken or damaged . It ’ s simply just too old ! That ’ s why your programs and applications are running slow . There really isn ’ t much I can do . 
 Yes , but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster ! 
 Well , this desktop over here is our latest model . It has a four gigahertz processor with sixteen gigabytes in RAM and a hard disk with one terabyte . Of course , it includes a mouse , keyboard and desk speakers . 
 This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze ! If it does , we ’ ll give you your money back ! 
 Who ? 
 You must have the wrong number . 
 Professor , where's Canada ? 
 Can you show me on the map ? 
 Oh , I see . Where's Mexico ? 
 How about Connecticut ? Where's that ? 
 What state is west of Pennsylvania ? 
 OK , Where's Los Angeles ? 
 Where's Boston . 
 Where is Las Vegas ? 
 Do you need help with something ? 
 Do you see anything that you like ? 
 That is a wonderful choice . 
 It's very inexpensive , and it has all the appliances . 
 The fridge and freezer is very spacious , and it also has an ice maker and water dispenser . 
 Take a look inside . 
 Hi , is this Rich ? 
 It ’ s Alex ... Have I got some great news ! We got the Baker account . It ’ s all ours ! 
 Would you please take a seat over there ? There are some interesting magazines on the coffee-table . 
 It shouldn't be long . Thirty minutes , tops . Are you in a hurry ? 
 Good idea . Do you want a wash or a massage ? Massage is especially good when you are tired . 
 Because it helps you speed up your circulation . 
 How do you like it ? 
 We have discount coupons . 100 Yuan for ten times . Would you like to have one ? 
 Of course . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Let me see ... the train to New York City ... here it is ... daily except Sunday at 10 thirty , 12 twenty and 15 ten . 
 Sorry , not before 10 thirty . 
 One way or round trip ? 
 A soft seat or hard one ? 
 $ 15 . And for a hard one , only $ 6 . 
 OK . Here is your change . The train leaves on platform 8 . 
 Of course . How about this one ? 
 It's a luminous watch with a time-reminder function . 
 Yes , and it comes with a worldwide guarantee . 
 Have you worked out the offers . Mr . Thou ? 
 Are the prices on the list firm offers ? 
 I wonder whether there are any changes in your prices . 
 How long does your offer remain valid ? I need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan . 
 Hello , what can I do for you ? 
 Give me your water and electricity bills , please . 
 You should pay 160 yuan for the electricity fee and 80 yuan for the water fee . 
 Yes . Will you pay by cash or credit card ? 
 I get 250 yuan from you , and this is the change , 10 yuan . 
 Bye . 
 Oh , not too bad . I'm just glad the weekend's finally here . 
 Give me a screwdriver on the rocks . 
 Thanks . 
 I'll teach you how to keep her . 
 After you've solved this problem for me . 
 Marry is not in right now , she went shopping with her mum . 
 That's all right . We don't go to bed early . 
 It's more violent than TV news ! 
 Nine-thirty . 
 No time . That's their headlights in the window ! 
 Little dude , your life is over ! 
 Madam , I made a close study of the draft contract yesterday evening . I think there are something needs to modify . 
 First , about the terms of payment . Your draft contract says that payment is to be made by D \ A . This is not our practice . We prefer to have the payment made by L \ C through a negotiating bank in America . 
 The second thing I would like to point out , that is packaging . It's stipulated in the contract that all the computer parts should be packed in cardboard boxes . But I think the wooden cases are much safer . 
 As far as the contract stipulations are concerned , there is nothing more . Thank you very much . 
 I've been working hard for a whole year . I really need a break . 
 You said it . I'm looking forward to my annual vacation . 
 Later this month . I can't wait ! 
 Bring me some toast , please . 
 Spread some jam , please . 
 Black coffee is fine . 
 Yes . speaking . Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 What do I need to take with me ? 
 Are you planning on voting ? 
 I will be voting tomorrow . 
 My polling place is at the park up the street . 
 Yeah , where is yours ? 
 How is it you don ’ t know ? 
 You can always just check online . 
 Good afternoon madam . What can I do for you ? 
 OK . Please hold on a minute . So you checked in on Monday and stayed 3 nights in single room 1005 . Is that right ? 
 OK . Here you are . If there are no questions , could we have your signature in the blank below ? 
 Here it is . We are pleased to serve you here and we look forward to seeing you again . Wish you have a good day . 
 Well , I'm here to get some help from you . I was hoping to have someone who we can deal with exclusively . On a long-term basis , if that's possible . 
 That sounds perfect . 
 Many children are learning drawing , dancing , swimming and so on in their spare time . You can follow suit . 
 Well , you should talk with your son and let him make his own decision . 
 What are you thinking of getting ? 
 I think I may get something too . 
 I have a sweet tooth . I want candy . 
 I really want some chocolate . 
 I either want a Snickers or a Kit Kat . 
 Then I guess I'll just get a Snickers . 
 Oh ! ! My car isn't working . I'm waiting for a tow-truck . 
 Yes , my wife is coming to get me . 
 No , we live in the suburbs . What about you ? 
 Do you have a car ? 
 You're lucky ! 
 Sure ! How about we go home and prepare a couple of sandwiches ? 
 All you ever do is have unhealthy fast food Pizza , fries , burgers and hot dogs ! You have to start eating better ! 
 Yeah right ! I ’ m serious ! You should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . You drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! It ’ s really not healthy ! 
 It ’ s a start , but I ’ ll be happy when I see you stick to your promise ! 
 Yes , it is . It has some really good articles in it . 
 I didn't know that . How much does it cost to subscribe ? 
 I used to subscribe to it , but I cancelled my subscription last year . 
 I was the only person in my family reading it . Everyone in my family just likes to read Fashion . 
 Hello , Betty , how are you ? 
 Just fine , thank you.How ' s your father today ? 
 I'm glad to hear that.Bye . 
 Are you a wrestler or a boxer ? 
 Your muscular shoulders and chest impress me so . 
 Excuse me . I'm looking for an old music box . 
 Something made in the ' 20s would be nice . 
 Are dancing figures a part of any of the boxes ? 
 Oh , these are great . I think I'll take this one . 
 Now , does this come with a warranty ? 
 That doesn't surprise me . 
 Bill , I must tell you the truth . You failed the English exam again . 
 Haha . April Fool's ! Did you forget what day it is today ? 
 Alright , now let's be serious . Actually , you get high marks in the exam . 
 What time will the library be closing ? 
 Does it always close at six ? 
 Will the library be open on Saturday ? 
 What are your hours on Saturday ? 
 All right . Thank you . 
 That ’ s it . Thank you . 
 You have found your way to the interview class . Please come in ! 
 When we go into an interview , what do you think our first consideration should be ? 
 Friendliness and a good attitude are also very important . 
 The interviewers always are interested in what you ask them about their company . 
 Be yourself and be honest . Simply answer the questions put to you . 
 He must be green . It ’ s lucky that we will get off soon . 
 Yes . In fact , the recommendation is a way of indirect self-recommendation . The university and the business have a long-term relationship . If you are recommended by your university , you can be approved more easily . 
 More and more people have the same discoveries since most of the universities do that in order to save effort . 
 What ’ s going to be covered in the orientation ? 
 Quite a lot . All them one afternoon ? 
 It is ok with me . I enjoy being busy and learning new things . 
 Nothing . What's going on with you ? 
 I had no idea . 
 I didn't hear anything about it . 
 What time ? 
 I'll go . 
 No doubt . 
 Thanks . Does it suit me ? 
 I know . That ’ s why I bought it . I hate wearing the same styles like everybody else is wearing . 
 It ’ s very nice of you to say so . I should say you are glamorous yourself , as a matter of fact . 
 good afternoon ! Can I help you ? 
 this way , please . Here they are . They're all handmade . 
 of course . The fitting room is right over there . 
 I'm sorry . All the back of that size are sold out . Would you like a red one ? 
 oh , that suits you very well . Besides it is believed in China that the red color brings happiness and good luck . 
 our pleasure . Please fill out this form , leaving your address and telephone number . 
 let me see ... 
 I have got a computer engineer's qualification certificate . 
 Oh , yes , I have . I worked part-time as a typewriter in a computer company when I was at college . 
 In my opinion , it has a broad prospect and it needs smart mind . 
 This'd better be good . I'm about to fire you all and find another company . 
 Mmm , smells good . Sure better than my instant . But please don't tell me this is another coffee-themed pitch . I thought I told you ... 
 Mr . Smith , welcome to our factory . 
 You'll know our products better after this visit . 
 Yes , all of us have naps . 
 No , not at all . 
 So cool ! Can I get a load of it ? 
 Neither can I . 
 What ? 
 Oh . Why did she do that ? 
 National Trust . 
 Just one second , and I'll check . 
 Brad , wait ! 
 How come you have a locker but I don't ? 
 I had to carry my backpack with me all day . 
 Does it have a lock ? 
 Could you tell me something about your previous job ? 
 Didn't you like it ? 
 Why do you choose our company ? 
 What do you know about our company ? 
 Hello ? 
 Hi Joe . 
 It's really cold . It snowed all day and the schools closed early . 
 It's 30 degrees now . It was even colder this morning . 
 I was watching the news a little earlier . They said it's probably going to snow tomorrow . 
 Me too . How's the weather where you are ? 
 She lives a happy life after marriage . 
 Lucky her . 
 I set up the Personal Wealth Management Service with you , but I'm going to be travelling overseas . I'm not quite sure what I should do . I mean is it possible to still use the service ? 
 Really ? In that case , could I have the number of the Service Centre please ? 
 And they can deal with everything ? 
 That's good to know . Thanks . 
 It's nothing . I'm just a little stressed out . 
 School . Since I was working part time , I had a difficult time keeping up with class . Now that we have exams coming up , I'm totally freaking out . 
 I hope so . I guess I won't be sleeping for the next 3 days . That's what it'll take . 
 That will be great . 
 I'm glad we're meeting today . Thank you . 
 I would like to talk to you about your daughter . 
 No , your daughter is great . 
 Your daughter is a wonderful student . 
 Of course not . Your daughter is smart and very well behaved . 
 It is my pleasure to have her in my class . 
 Don't you know that ? It's all about new office rules . 
 It says smoking is not allowed in any private offices . It might be the most terrible thing for you . 
 If you want to ask for leave , you should get the approval from the manager in charge of your department . 
 The note says you should call your manager first , and then tell him your reason , and then ask him for the approval . 
 No . We still enjoy 10 - day of paid vacation per year . 
 Of course . That's what we deserve . 
 I have something else to remind you of . Don't be late , if you are late , you will be fined 20 Yuan per minute . 
 So remember to set your alarm clock . 
 Yes , mum . I'm coming . 
 Oh , must I ? 
 Excuse me , I ’ d like to buy a guitar.Could you recommend one ? 
 An acoustic one . 
 What ’ s the difference ? 
 I ’ m mainly interested in learning to play rhythm guitar . 
 This one ’ s a little too expensive for me . I ’ d prefer something cheaper for now.When I ’ Ve learned to play , I might get a better one . 
 Hmm.All right , I ’ ll take it , and this book on how to play the guitar as well . 
 Oh , right.Thanks for your help . 
 Hello , I'd like to subscribe to a magazine . 
 Fitness Consultant . 
 Only one , please . 
 For six months , please . 
 Shirley , that's my wife's name . I subscribe to this magazine for her . 
 OK . How much is the subscription ? 
 650 Yuan ! You must be kidding ! I can subscribe for evening newspapers for ten years with that much ! 
 I go occasionally when there's a game on near home , but usually I watch it on TV . 
 Sometimes . But I'll never forget the game in which our Chinese Women's Volleyball Team won the World Cup . It is the most thrilling and exciting game I have ever seen . 
 Yes , sir ! What can I do for you ? 
 Will you have it strong or weak ? 
 What can I do for you , Ma'am ? 
 How old is she ? 
 We have a new-fashioned cell phone especially designed for young girls . The brand name is Nokia . 
 Sure . This is the one I will not hesitate to recommend . Its color and style is so attractive and also the quality is really reliable . 
 Sure . By the way , here are some free adornments . Would you like one ? 
 Have a seat over there . I'll pack it up for you right away . 
 Good morning . Do you have a small house for the 18th and 19th of this month ? 
 One bedroom will be okay . 
 You do allow pets , don't you ? 
 No problem . I don't have a dog or a cat . 
 Good morning . My name's Jason Smith . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Oh , my CV . Yes , here it s . There are three copies . 
 No , I haven't . I'm awfully sorry . Can I send them to you ? 
 I haven't been involved in international business , so I don't have any experiences , but I am diligent and I learn very fast . 
 Yes , in most circumstances.Are you available for business travel ? 
 OK . You are good . Hope to see you next time . I'll call you if you get picked for next test . 
 If I won the Pools , I'd go round the world . 
 What would you do ? 
 One thing's certain . If I had a lot of money , I wouldn't work any more . 
 As I said , I'd go round the world . 
 Oh , I don't know . It'd take me a long time to go round the world . 
 Anyway , we haven't won the Pools , and we're not likely to win them . So there isn't much point in talking about it , is there ? 
 And my wife would be happy if I bought her a mink coat . 
 What'll you have ? 
 I'd have a Scotch if I were you . We deserve it . 
 I hear you ’ re taking a music class . I didn ’ t know you ’ re interested in it . 
 In my opinion , you ’ ll make it . 
 No , I ’ m serious . 
 Okay . Loser has to take out the trash for a month . 
 See you in the court . 
 Morning . Can I help you ? 
 All you need is your student identification card to check out books . 
 How many pieces of baggage have you lost ? 
 Can you tell me the features of your baggage ? 
 Don't worry . We will look it for you right now . 
 Good evening , sir . Are you Mr . Jim Stewart from the States ? 
 Glad to meet you . Mr Stewart . I'm the guide from Pacific Tour Agency . My name is Zhang Hua . 
 I'm always at your service , sir . By the way , did you have a pleasant trip ? 
 Well , shall we go to the hotel right now ? I've already made a reservation for you . 
 So we must get you to the hotel as soon as possible . I hope to see you refreshed and revitalized tomorrow morning , as we are going to visit the Great Wall . 
 Could I help you on your new project ? 
 I want to help with both . 
 Most of the time that is what I prefer . 
 I am not sure yet . 
 I will do that . 
 I'm here to conduct the annual census of foreigners living in Beijing . This is my service ID card . 
 We only need to verify your information against our records . 
 Please show me your passport and Residence Permit . 
 How long have you been living here ? 
 May I know your occupation ? 
 Is that right ? Which university , if you don't mind my asking ? 
 Everything appears to be in order . Thank you for your time . 
 Yeah , so what do you think about the teachers ? 
 I think so too . I don't like him either . Well , who do you like best ? 
 Me , too . She speaks very clearly and doesn't use very complicated words so that it is easy for us to understand her . 
 Yeah , I like her way of teaching . She told us not to cram for exams , and to pay more attention to communicating than memorizing . 
 Actually , our new math teacher is a good person . He just can't find an appropriate way to teach us . 
 I ’ m very sorry . 
 Ha ! It's not like you've ever been one to beat around the bush . 
 No , seriously . . . I really want this . 
 I know . But things have changed . I guess I've settled down . 
 I'm really sorry , Bob . I accidentally damaged your bike . 
 I'll make it up to you . Let me know how much it costs and I'll give you the money . 
 Every so often . It is very convenient and the price is lower than in stores . 
 Books , cosmetics , daily necessities , even large electrical appliance can be ordered from online-stores . 
 Even you can bargain with the owner of one on-line store , although he or she provides ' But It Now ' prices . 
 Some provide wrong pictures for the goods , so many buyers are deceived . 
 Do you really want to know ? 
 You did pretty bad . 
 You didn't pass the test . 
 There are a few reasons why you failed . 
 The main reason is the fact that you're a horrible driver . 
 You'll be able to take the test again in a couple weeks . 
 Yes , what would you recommend ? 
 It does sound wonderful , maybe I'll try it . 
 Not today , thanks . But I'd like to know any of the vegetarian dishes . 
 Maybe I don't want the fish , I think I had the greenbean dish instead . 
 I'd like the egg drop soup . 
 Yes . 
 Just nice water , thanks . 
 We have a great selection . What decade are you looking for ? 
 We have six . 
 Actually , two of them have dancing figures . 
 A good choice . I prefer that one myself . 
 Oh , no , I'm afraid not . These things are just too old to guarantee anything . 
 Even if they break down , they're still works of art . 
 Yes ? 
 Certainly.Go along Queen's Road ... 
 Yes , and turn right at the Hilton Hotel . 
 Then go up Garden Road , past the Cathedral . 
 Yes.Then cross the road at the next traffic lights.The Peak Tram is straight ahead.You can't miss it . 
 Yes.Why ? 
 One of my students told me she was very depressed today . 
 Her father is dying . 
 Yeah , she ’ s broken up about it , poor kid . 
 I talked to her for a while , but she ’ s really depressed . So , I made an appointment with the school counselor for her . 
 Yeah , that ’ s what I told her . I ’ m glad she ’ s reaching out for help , instead of trying to deal with this on her own . 
 What's going on ? 
 A lot , like the party I'm having on Friday . 
 Will you be able to make it ? 
 What do you have to do ? 
 Maybe you can come next time . 
 I'll look for you at my next party . 
 Excuse me . May I come in ? 
 I am glad to meet you , Mr.Joey . 
 That is excellent , your investment proposal is a wise decision . May I have some idea of your suggestion ? 
 Good evening . I've come to see Miss Morrison 
 Oh ! I've just come back from Canada and I've brought a parcel from her parents 
 But you're busy , aren't you ? 
 I can leave the parcel with you , can't I ? 
 Do you think the bad weather will last long ? 
 I hope so . We have planed to visit the square but we have to cancel it . 
 Good idea . Thanks a billion . 
 Thank you . I have been working on it for several years . 
 It also helps that I have strong team members , such as yourself . You really know your stuff ! 
 Are you looking for an apartment ? 
 I think I have just a right apartment for you . 
 Yes . It has one bedroom , a large living space and 4 kitchens . 
 Yes , it ’ s brand-new . 
 It ’ s $ 8.50 a month . 
 We can take a see by there now if you like . The landlord left me a set of keys with me . 
 I want to see the man responsible for selling typewriters . 
 Well , look here . Ten new typewriters were delivered to my company yesterday afternoon and only five of them work properly . 
 Never mind being sorry , what are you going to do about it ? 
 Good , I hope you'll make sure that it won't happen again . 
 Thank you . Goodbye . 
 I would like to look at some watch . 
 Pure gold ones , please . 
 What is the price for this one ? 
 That's quite steep . Can you come down a little bit ? 
 It's rather more than I was thinking of paying . 
 OK . I'll take it . 
 May I have your ticket and passport please ? 
 No problem . Put your baggage on the scale , please . 
 OK . Here's your ticket , boarding pass , passport and baggage claim tag . You'll be boarding at Gate 8 . The boarding time is 9 a . m . 
 Well , Mr . Smith . That's a nasty infection you have . 
 I'm going to prescribe some antibiotics and some cream to ease the itching and burning . 
 The pharmacy will give you a discount since you came to the clinic . 
 The fourth . I'll send the prescription down there so you can just pick it up on your way out . 
 That looks like an interesting book . 
 There are the pymeids . It ’ s easy to see how they got that name ! they don ’ t have smooth sides though . 
 Look at that cylindrical office building . I ’ Ve never been seen one that shape before . 
 Tv towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top . They ’ re not perfectly cylindrical . 
 What sports do they play there ? 
 Is that building a perfect cube ? 
 Is says here that it ’ s a war memorial . Now , there ’ s a distinctive structure-the stomium in Brussels . See ? It consists of several connected by cylinders . I believe you can go up and down inside it . 
 No , sir . Would you rather sit near the dance floor ? 
 That's free . 
 Because they are full-grown . Look at their curvy figures . 
 They suddenly become shy when they speak to boys . 
 She is certainly not my kind of girl . 
 You are so Platonic . Those naive girls will eventually grow into real women . They can't resist love , and men cannot resist their attraction either . 
 I ’ d like to set a fixed time for this meeting before we finish today . Can you all take a look at your schedules ? 
 That ’ s out for me . I already have a standard meeting on Thursdays at 9:30 a . m . How about Wednesday afternoon at 2 
 Mary , we're going to the supermarket . Do you want to come ? 
 Let's all go together then . 
 She's getting coupons from her desk . 
 They give you discounts on some stuff that you want to buy . 
 Because there is a coupon for almost every product , we always bring coupons on our shopping trips . 
 The bigger they are , the harder they fall . 
 What's the matter with it ? 
 How about the tires ? 
 I met Mark yesterday . He looked blue . 
 It belongs to the past . He lost his job the other day , and he ’ s up a tree now . 
 I am here to get my prescription filled . 
 Do you ever deliver prescriptions by mail ? 
 How should I take this medication ? 
 Should I avoid alcohol with this medication ? 
 Should I expect any side effects ? 
 Credit Services , how can I help you ? 
 Would that be our standard card , our gold card , or our platinum card ? 
 Well , the standard card has a lower credit limit , that's 20,000 RIB , whereas with the platinum card you can have a credit limit of 80,000 RIB . 
 It's all about credit rating and salary . If your credit rating and your salary are high enough , we can offer you the platinum card . 
 Yes , we have contracts with various luxury shops and health clubs , where if you use the card to purchase items from them , you can get some healthy discounts . 
 How much is the fare ? 
 Could you tell me how to use it ? 
 Oh , I see . By the way , how can I get out of the platform after I get off the train ? 
 Thank you for your help . 
 Is there a train leaving for Philadelphia ? 
 May I buy a ticket here at the station ? 
 Where ? 
 Thanks . 
 Yes , ma'ma . There'll be no problem with the quality . 
 You don't have to worry about it . We have a one year warranty . 
 Sure . We have a good after-sale service . Your satisfaction is guaranteed . 
 I haven't gotten started on my room yet . 
 I have every intention of cleaning my room later . 
 I already told you that I'm going to do it . 
 I'll remember to do that . 
 I'll clean my room before I leave . 
 Isn't it time for dinner ? 
 How about Mac Donald's ? 
 I'm sorry . 
 You are so thoughtful . 
 You'll see the world-famous magnificent waterfall . 
 Your dream will come true.It ' s really breathtaking . 
 Morning , Meg . You look not well today ? Are you ill ? 
 Then , What ’ s the matter with you my child ? 
 Oh , come on , baby . Tell me what happened . 
 Oh . Take it easy . You can set your aim from today . 
 I may go grocery shopping later . 
 I don't think we have any food . 
 What food are we out of ? 
 Could you look for me ? 
 What would that be ? 
 Would you please make a list for me ? 
 Hi , John ! I haven ’ t seen you for ages . 
 I ’ m glad to see you , too . How ’ Ve you been ? 
 Not bad . I finally bought a house . It ’ s an old one , but built really solid . It is close to here . Do you want to come over for lunch ? 
 OK , next time you ’ re here . 
 I heard that you moved to Florida . 
 Tell me more . 
 Sounds great ! 
 I want to see Disney World , Sea World , Universal Studios , and Weeki-Watchee Springs . 
 I ’ m jealous . I ’ Ve never been to Florida . 
 That sounds great ! I ’ ll take you up on that invitation . 
 I sure will . 
 Count on it . And here ’ s my card . Don ’ t hesitate to call me anytime . 
 Well , I ’ m really glad we bumped into each other . Have a good trip . 
 I will . Good-bye . 
 Did you go to school today ? 
 I didn't want to , so I didn't . 
 That's a switch . 
 No , I haven't . Why ? 
 So go then . 
 Well anyway , do you plan on going to school tomorrow ? 
 He's honest , hardworking and responsible . I simply can't find any shortcoming of his as an employee . 
 Don't be so jealous . He never speaks ill of you before me . 
 Well , I go jogging every morning , eat a healthful diet and work out in a gymnasium twice a week . 
 Hi , Ann . 
 I just heard that our school will hold a singing contest in 5 days . 
 Of course . This is a great chance for me to show off my beautiful voice . 
 I heard that the winner gets a Panda Radio . 
 A chance ? Not just a chance , I'm a hundred percent certain.Everyone says my voice is beautiful . 
 I still have 5 days to practise . It's in the bag ! 
 Yeah , maybe . 
 This is Ryan . How may I help you ? 
 Do you know what the problem is ? 
 Have you had it a long time ? 
 Have you been using anything for it ? 
 That will probably take care of your symptoms . I ’ ll see you tomorrow . 
 Do you know what kind of beef you want ? 
 How many pounds do you need ? 
 What kind of ground beef do you need ? 
 Let me go and get that for you . 
 No problem . I'll wrap it up for you now . 
 What are your personal weaknesses ? 
 Are you more of a leader or a follower ? 
 Do you think you can make yourself easily understood in English ? 
 Are you available for travel ? 
 Hello , Fife Computers . How can I help ? 
 Oh , really ? Do you know which company they are from ? 
 What's the charge for that ? 
 That seems pretty reasonable . Thanks . 
 In just three weeks , and I am excited . But there are still a few things I need to do before I go . 
 Like renewing my passport , going to the travel agency to buy my plane ticket and figuring out what to do with my apartment while I ’ m gone . 
 No way . I ’ ll never find another apartment around here . But I don ’ t like the idea of paying three months ’ rent on an empty apartment , either . 
 Yes , but whom to ? 
 That ’ s exactly when I ’ ll be away . It sounds ideal , as long as the landlord agrees . 
 Well , thanks , Bill . Let me know what happens . That extra money will really come in handy . 
 Yes . After my graduation from university , I worked as a Customer Service Coordinator in a foreign representative office , and then I transferred to a joint venture as a Market Development Manager . So I am familiar with the market in China . 
 I learned to be patient when dealing with customers complaints and try my best to solve them . In addition , I learned at my previous jobs how to cooperate with my colleagues . 
 No , I haven't discussed my leaving plans with my current employer , but I am sure he will release me . 
 Very good . 
 They would say I'm a dependable and hard worker . 
 It's about 3 kilometers . 
 Why not walk further to the tree over there ? 
 Lucy , I ’ d like to fix the light in the corridor , it keeps flashing , which drives me crazy . Would you like to help me with the ladder ? 
 I think I can handle it by myself . 
 I see . If I got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , I wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility . 
 Like this one ? Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder.Yeah , thank you for telling me . 
 Come on , Tara . Let ’ s go up to the window and buy two tickets . The movie is starting in a few minutes . 
 Two tickets , please . How much are they ? 
 I ’ m looking forward to this film . I read a good review of it in this morning ’ s newspaper . 
 Are these seats okay ? 
 Have you seen this news article ? Apparently an organization has made a list to name the new seven wonders of the world and people could vote for them online . 
 Well , the Great Wall of China , the Taj Mahal in India . 
 Cool ! Also amongst the winners is Petra , in Jordan , Mach Pitch in Peru and the pyramid in Chichenitza in Mexico . 
 Well , let's see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year . 
 Are you going to vote ? 
 Yeah , but what day are the elections ? 
 That ’ s why I ’ m asking you . 
 Really ? 
 Good thing you told me . 
 It slipped my mind . 
 I'm sorry , I'm engaged at 2 p . m . 
 Sorry , the whole afternoon is filled up here.Will tomorrow do ? 
 Let me tell you some more . The interest is settled on the 20th of the last month in each quarter , It's paid quarterly . Of course it also needs to be settled if you cancel the account . 
 Well , the Type B Account is very restricted . If your aim is to use the account the same way as your use your Settlement Account , I would recommend the Type A Account for you . 
 You are freaking me out . 
 What do you want , Essie ? 
 I don't want coffee . I'd like some orange juice . 
 I don't like coffee in this cafe . 
 Most people think so . 
 Great . That will give me time to talk with my staff before I make final decision . 
 Good news . Thanks for getting things done so quickly . 
 yes , I did . I won a prize for best local history book at the annual book awards . 
 actually , I was happy just to get the book published . Winning the prize was an added bonus . 
 I won $ 200 to spend on any books of my choice . 
 I shared a prize with some friends last week . We won a bottle of whisky at a pub quiz . 
 Hi , can I help you ? 
 What about this one ? 
 Oh , you want a convertible sofa . This way , please . Over there is the one you want . 
 Yes . Here it is . 
 I'm going to visit some relatives here for several months . 
 The only things I brought were some cloths and my notebook computer . 
 No , Sir , I did not . 
 Good morning . I want to deposit a sum of money into my account . 
 Well , I want to deposit 2,000 yuan into my account . 
 OK . I wonder about the rate of interest of the account . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Good morning . May I speak to Mr . Black , please ? 
 This is the Front Desk . I'm afraid that the air conditioning in your room needs repair . We would like to request you to change your room . We are very sorry for the inconvenience . 
 What time is the most convenient for you to change rooms , sir ? 
 What time will you be back ? 
 We could move your luggage while you are out , but could you take any valuables with you ? You may pick up your new room key No . 216 from the Front Desk when you return . 
 Thank you very much , sir . 
 What happened ? 
 She did ? Why didn't anyone tell me ? 
 No , I had no idea . 
 Oh my God , that's great ! 
 I think that I might . 
 Thanks for telling me . 
 Have you any definite idea ? 
 I think you'd better try an active job . 
 Well , there are several things . Of course , you must do everything you can to keep costs down and revenues high . 
 No . if you do that , the workers won ’ t like their jobs . They will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . Those things will increase you costs . 
 You need to invest in some good advertising . You have to know where your potential customers are and target them . It ’ s no good trying to sell computer games to older people . The market is too small . 
 Find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . Price yourself near the low end . Don ’ t be much cheaper than everyone else , because many customers distrust very cheap things . Th 
 My washing machine isn't working . 
 The water will not drain . 
 No , that's it . 
 When will you be able to fix it ? 
 That would be perfect . 
 See you then . 
 Yes . I've been through them and there's a problem , a rather major discrepancy actually . You see ? It should be KN509 . 
 Exactly , if we accept these it could cause a lot of problems in our record and our accounts system because the numbers don't match . 
 Thanks for inviting me . And happy birthday , Julia . 
 So what do you think of my new dress ? 
 Um , ninety-five dollars ? 
 I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen ’ s Boutique . I didn ’ t know I could get it cheaper somewhere else . 
 I don ’ t know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive . 
 I am Tim Green in Room 1021 and I want a wake-up call at five thirty AM tomorrow . 
 I want to change my wake-up time . 
 Tim , in Room 1021 . 
 At six thirty AM tomorrow . 
 Could you please pass me the salt ? 
 What time shall I pick you up ? 
 That'll be fine . See you soon . 
 In three months or so ? 
 Did I ? Well . Anyway , you'll get your raise when the economy starts picking up . 
 Yes . 
 Excuse me . I was wondering how to order office supplies . 
 I need paper , ink cartridges , and paper clips . 
 I need all of my supplies right away . 
 I will check to see what my budget is . 
 Please deliver them to my office . 
 Thank you ! 
 Yes . I need a tow truck . My car is broken down . 
 I ’ m on the Highway 401 , close to the Lipton Link . 
 Black . 
 AKIM 400 . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 It was terrific . I really enjoyed it . 
 I was there for about three weeks . 
 Yes , most of the time . But it snowed a lot in Chicago . 
 Oh , that's difficult to say . But I guess I liked Nashville the best . 
 Yes , I'm studying in the Foreign Languages Department . 
 I'm majoring in English . 
 Yes . The language is hard to learn , but it's interesting . 
 I'm reading a lot of books about the two countries . I like the culture . 
 You're right . 
 But the semester just started ? Why the rush ? 
 How often do you meet ? 
 What days , do you know ? 
 Okay , count me in . 
 I don't know anything about American food . What do you recommend ? 
 I'd rather have meat . 
 OK . Whatever you say . 
 Oh , Jane . What on earth have you been ? I've called you a thousand times . 
 But I called your cell phone , and there was no answer . 
 Do you feel better now ? 
 I can't wait to go skiing tomorrow . 
 I always get excited the day before . 
 I only go skiing twice a year , so it's a real treat for me . 
 What things make you excited ? 
 Oh ... that makes me excited too ! 
 Hey Michelle . Good to see you . Are you at lunch ? 
 No , I wish I was ! I just got back from Spain actually . 
 My first time . I've traveled around Europe a lot , but this was my first time to Spain . It was amazing , and the weather was just beautiful ! No rain , and just sun , sun , sun ... 
 Well , I really recommend Spain . You really should go . Anyway , it's been great to catch up , but I must be going , this is my floor . Speak again soon I hope . 
 Is it formal or informal ? 
 In that case , formal suit with a nice tie will be better . 
 The brown leather shoes are OK . 
 Don ’ t mention it . 
 Wow ! She's gorgeous . 
 Knock on wood . But I have a very important date . 
 Is that Anne ? 
 What are you talking about ? We had a great time . We laughed and talked all night last time . 
 That's not fair . We had fun . Give me a second chance . Can we meet tomorrow night for drinks at the pub ? 
 But Anne ... 
 I'd love to . 
 OK . 
 Let me help you . 
 Yes , I'll have a boiled egg with toast and orange juice , please . 
 Hard-boiled , please . 
 Dark , please . 
 Later will do . 
 No , that's all . Thanks . 
 That's right . 
 There is a problem in my apartment . 
 A pipe broke in my wall , and water is leaking . 
 Yes , it ’ s creating mildew on the walls . 
 I can call a plumber to fix it right now . 
 Well , you can ’ t do it until tomorrow , and I need it fixed now . 
 You ’ re okay with me calling someone ? 
 How do you like the food here ? 
 There are many things I miss . You can't get the ingredients here . 
 Perhaps . i just haven't had time to find them yet . 
 We heard you weren't feeling well , so we came to check on you . 
 Who , Femi ? Yeah , Yi-jun saw her inside . 
 I remember someone spiked my punch . You sat with me in the girl's bathroom ... 
 Yes . There's one on the corner of 23th street . 
 Just walk north for 3 blocks . It's next to the Mexico restaurant . 
 Oh , very close . Maybe 5 minutes walk . 
 Of course . Are you a new member here ? 
 Welcome . My name is Johnson . 
 Do you have any experience using weights ? 
 Well , first it is important to go through a good stretch.You must warm up properly so that you don't hurt yourself on the machines . 
 Alright . Great . Then we must get a card for you . 
 No . Not that . I mean a training card.The card allows you to keep track of how much weight you use on each machine.Here , let me show you . 
 Now , you can see that on this card there are all the machines listed.So , when you go through the series of twelve machines , you enter in the number of repetitions you do.And you also enter in the weight at which you set the machine . 
 Yes . And it also reminds you what is a suitable weight for each machine.Today , I will go through the machines with you one by one . I will show you how to use them.And we will determine what is a good starting weight for you . 
 So you write your name and member number at the top of the card.And then , after you exercise each time , you file the card here . 
 Are you alright ? Can you do more ? 
 That's okay . Don't worry.It ' s important not to push yourself . Especially not at the beginning . 
 We can just go through them next time . It's no problem . Really.The most important thing is to know your limits.So if you feel burned out now , it is good to stop.Because if you strain a muscle or hurt your back , then you won't be able to exercise for a couple weeks . Right ? 
 Are you a social person ? 
 What is your strategy in communicating with colleagues ? 
 I have to go home now , Jenny . Thanks for inviting me to your party . 
 I had a wonderful time . 
 Yes , I need to check-in for the eleven 20 flight to New York , please . 
 Here you are . 
 I want an aisle seat as close to the exit door as possible , please . 
 No , I just have this one small bag . 
 Thank you . 
 You , too . 
 Good . I'll take care of it . 
 Are you sure ? Do you have somebody in mind ? 
 OK . Just keep in mind it has to be somebody who can get along with Elvin . 
 What do you think of the former champ ? 
 No champion can remain at the top for ever . 
 I have talked a lot about your restaurant business and your friends with my friends . One of my friends seems to be on good terms with Sue . 
 She is indeed well . But she would not give anyone a tumble , you bet . 
 Let's plan a surprise party for him ! 
 That's easy . Anything else ? 
 Won't he be surprised ! 
 That's O . K . Maybe his wife will spill the beans ! 
 Yes , please . 
 Beef , please . 
 I like lamb , but my husband doesn't . 
 Give me that piece please , and a pond of meet , too . 
 No , thank you.My husband likes steak , but he doesn't like chicken . 
 Come again ? What are you talking about ? Aren't we on the same team now ? 
 What do you mean ? You didn't ? Oh , no ... No ! 
 But how ? So you knew all along I was with WebTracker ? How did you know ? 
 morning , Mr . Winthrop . This is Sally Parker , Mr . Emory ’ s secretary . Mr . Emory has asked me to set up a meeting with you . 
 I understand . Would you like me to call you back ? 
 I can see you've got some color back in your cheeks . 
 You've formed a sound habit . 
 Good morning , Madam . What can I do for you ? 
 That shouldn't be a problem , Madam . I'm sure we can sort this out for you quickly . 
 Well , to be honest , it will slow things down a little . But it's not a big problem . You can do it by T / T . 
 It means ' telegraphic transfer ' . So , if you use this way it's fast and secure and can be done from anywhere , to anywhere in the world . 
 ( beep ) This is Miriam Lavalle – that's spelt L , A , V , A , L , L , E . It's about an appointment I made with Simon Meredith . I'm afraid I'm going to have to change it . Can you call me ? The number is 01563 566 770 . Thank you . 
 I feel so good . That warm hot pot certainly hits the spot on winter nights . 
 Oooo ... gross ... you're sweating all over the place . 
 You're going to have a little Montezuma's revenge tomorrow morning . 
 What ? Why do we have to do that ? 
 I see . That ’ s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock ! 
 That ’ s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ’ s like we went back in time ! 
 He stepped out of the office for a little while . 
 In about twenty minutes . 
 Yes , yes . It seems that everything is settled . 
 We have discussed it and decided that at the moment we would like the salaries to be paid into the employees's accounts , whether they are currently with this bank or not . 
 Of course , if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank , or open new accounts with you . 
 I am totally fed up with my boss . He has crossed the line one too many times with his sexist comments . This time I am really going to report him for sexual harassment . 
 He constantly lets inappropriate things slip out , referring to the women employees as girls or calling us sweetheart or darling . I doubt any of my male colleagues would stand for such treatment . 
 You ’ re missing the point . It ’ s about respect . He treats us with such a patronizing attitude , as if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers . It ’ s his attitude that needs to be changed , not just his words . 
 Don ’ t you agree that all the thieves should be punished by cutting off their fingers ? 
 Don ’ t you think in that case , there wouldn ’ t be so much stealing ? 
 I'd like to rent a car for several days . 
 Well , what kinds do you have ? 
 Honda is OK . 
 I'm glad you liked it . Are you ready for dessert ? 
 I made strawberry shortcake . 
 Great . Would you like coffee or tea with that ? 
 Do you take cream or sugar with your tea ? 
 Definitely . Would you like skim or whole milk ? 
 What happened ? 
 I'll go with you . Where is she ? 
 Is she alright ? 
 Don't worry . Family comes first . Come on , let's go . 
 Ok . Just call me if you need anything then . 
 Excuse me ? 
 Well , I bought this skirt here yesterday afternoon . But I got the wrong size . It ’ s too small for my daughter . I wonder if I could refund it . 
 I intended to , but as far as I know , all the skirts of this kind here are of the same size . 
 Sorry to have given you trouble . 
 This is Lincoln Bank , Consumer Credit Department . How can I help you ? 
 We offer a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan . The application process is pretty straight forward . I trust you have enough funds to cover the 20 % down payment ? 
 The next step is for us to recommend a dealer to you , who are already contracted to us , so ... 
 That will certainly cut down the processing time . We can move on to the next step . Do you have the purchase price ? 
 What we need you to do next is to come into the branch with a correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment . 
 Could you give me some advice ? 
 It feels all right . But if it were a darker color , I will like it better . 
 Hi ! Susan ! I haven ’ t seen you for ages ! 
 Oh , fine . Hey , why don ’ t we grab a bite to eat and do some catching up ? 
 Let's do something different today . 
 I would like you to give me a different hair style . 
 Give me a short haircut . 
 I want you to cut it to a few inches long . 
 I've had this idea for some time now . 
 This is what I want . 
 Is anything the matter , sir ? 
 What's wrong with it , sir ? 
 I am sorry you didn't enjoy it , sir . I will return it to the kitchen and bring you one that is well cooked . How is your steak this time , sir ? 
 I am glad you enjoy it . I will tell this to the chef . Would you like some more beer ? 
 Can I bring you some dessert ? 
 How about some coffee or tea then ? 
 Yes , Mr . Emory ? 
 Just one moment , sir . Here you are – 767-4512 . 
 Fine . I miss you so much , uncle Benjamin . 
 It's been 3 years now . 
 How is aunty Shirley ? 
 How has May been ? 
 Do you have any hobbies ? What is it or what are they ? 
 How do you spend your spare time ? 
 What kind of books are you interested in ? 
 Well , those books are really good . I like them too . How do you entertain yourself ? 
 Come on ! It's time to go ! 
 Well , I've got to stop and get gas in the car , first . 
 Well , it won't if there no line at the pump . 
 I'll give you five more minutes , then I'm going on without you ! 
 Oh , yes , I would ! 
 That's all right . 
 I'd just like a trim and don't make it too short . 
 A little trimming , please.Trim a little more above the ears . 
 Yes , but it's quite a ways . 
 This bus doesn't take you directly there . You'd have to change buses twice . I suggest you walk . It'll take you less than 20 minutes . 
 Go straight ahead through the intersection . 
 Keep walking till you pass the square , then turn right . Walk past two lights and turn left at the third . 
 Keep walking and look for a tall building . 
 The right side . ICCC should be on the first floor . 
 You're welcome . 
 Oh really ? When is it going to start ? 
 Well , I ’ d like to , but I ’ m going to have to look at my schedule . 
 Oh , no ! I can't have failed . surely ? 
 Whatever am i going to tell me parents . 
 What am I to do ? 
 Are you going to the movie theater with me tonight ? 
 Titanic is playing tonight . It's a blockbuster . 
 OK , let's meet at the movie theater entrance tonight . Don ’ t be late . 
 ( After watching the movie . ) Are you crying ? 
 Tragic movie ? I think it's a love story . 
 Ah , you're just too emotional . 
 So what did you get ? 
 What's this ? Essential oil ? Wow ! This stuff is expensive . 
 How is oil supposed to make you relax ? 
 Mmmm . They smell nice . 
 No . Go to bed right now . 
 Yes , sir , where are you going ? 
 Get on , please . 
 I am not sure , sir . Generally we can , but look at the traffic . It's the rush hour . 
 We are really in a hurry . 
 I'll do my best . 
 Is that Sue ? 
 A.This is George . 
 How did you know ? 
 Does it happen often ? 
 Hi , Tim , any news about your job interview ? 
 Oh , what a pity ! 
 How do I know when to tell EDD that have I started a new job ? 
 So I guess I have to report that I ’ Ve found a little bit of work . 
 What about if I find a job that I know will only last for a couple of weeks ? Can I take it ? 
 This website offers very convenient air tickets booking service . It is quick and accurate . 
 So it has attracted more and more customers these days . 
 Melissa ? I ’ d like to invite you to my wife ’ s birthday party . 
 Her birthday is on the 9th . We ’ re going to have dinner at a Mexican restaurant , and then maybe go out dancing . 
 What are your responsibilities as a secretary ? 
 What courses did you take in English secretarial studies ? 
 Is Alice available ? 
 I've called you a hundred times today . 
 No problem . 
 Did you want to do something tomorrow ? 
 How about a movie ? 
 Call me tomorrow then . 
 Hey , Mark , long time no see . 
 Great . I just got back from a week's vacation in Thailand . 
 Fantastic ! I didn't want to come back . 
 They are . And not only that the people are friendly , but also the food is delicious , not to mention cheap . 
 Not much . I've go enough city life in Beijing . 
 Hey , wouldn't it be great if we could go to Thailand together sometime ? 
 Which one of them is Marys brother ? 
 I'd like to meet him.Will you introduce him to me ? 
 Thank you for purchasing your new mattress with us . 
 Would you like us to deliver the mattress for you ? 
 When do you want it delivered ? 
 What time exactly ? 
 We can have it to you at that time . 
 We will deliver your mattress tomorrow at 12 o'clock . 
 How do I use this adhesive ? 
 How do I use the lotion ? 
 Well , thanks very much . 
 Hi , I'd like two tickets to Providence , please . 
 What time does the next train leave ? 
 Ok , could you give me two tickets for that ? 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 Do you have a reservation , sir ? 
 Sorry , sir . That table has been reserved . This way , please . How about this one , sir ? 
 Would you like some drinks ? 
 May I help you , sir ? 
 All right . What is your type of skin ? 
 You can use this . It has special effect for keeping your face moisturized . It has this lotion , as a gift attached . 
 How about this one ? It is well-known for the effect of removing scurf . 
 Yes , it is a new brand . 
 Anything else ? 
 Yes , here you are . 
 I bet my button dollar that he won't . He is no more than a nine day's wonder . 
 Many people like him get a flying start but soon disappear . 
 You are not the gray train , I guess . But bite the bullet and you'll soon be in the chips again . 
 But the darkest hour is the nearest dawn . I bet you'll soon turn the table . 
 Can ’ t you stay a little longer ? 
 Say hi to your parents for me . I hope to see them soon . 
 Yes , I will . Take care , then . 
 Going to the gym tonight , Mary ? 
 That sounds like fun.Would you mind some company ? 
 I'll get my things and meet you there . 
 Excuse me , Supen . 
 Please forgive me , but I have to leave . I feel terrible . but ... 
 My daughter isn't feeling well . 
 I don't know . Will you forgive me ? 
 Thank you . It's our first date . I hope it's not too offensive . 
 John ! Wait a second ! I was just heading downstairs for a cup of coffee . You want to come ? I ’ Ve got some good news ! 
 I am . Don ’ t worry about getting your wallet . It ’ s my treat . 
 Ann invited us to dinner this saturday afternoon . 
 How about a china vase ? 
 So am I on the right road to Piccadilly Circus ? 
 What did he say ? 
 That ’ s it . I think we ’ re one block beyond . 
 Hello , Brian . 
 Hello , Bob . 
 You haven't ? If you've never tried it I can show you how . 
 Downloading music is really fast and convenient , and you can preview all the songs before you buy them . 
 That sounds great ! I ’ d love to ! Here is my address . Pick me up at eight ? 
 Thank you for such a lovely evening ! The food was amazing , and I had a great time . 
 What is it ? 
 Good afternoon , sales department.May I help you ? 
 I'll see a piece available , who should I say is calling , please ? 
 Hold the line , please.Mr Wood is in the meeting with managing director at the moment I afraid.Can I help you ? 
 I don't think the meet will go on much longer , should I ask him to call you when he is free . 
 Could I have your name again , please ? 
 And the number ? 
 Ok , you will be hearing from Mr Wood later in the afternoon then , Mr John . 
 You are welcome , goodbye . 
 I apologize . This should not have to be this way . 
 Of course , I should have been more careful . I ’ m sorry . 
 No , I am on business . I will spend half a month for the business . 
 I am currently working in a foreign company as a salesman . 
 Maybe . But it provides much wider space for me to improve the skills and increase the experience . What about you ? 
 Do you like your job ? 
 Which kind of news do you catch ? 
 Are you feel tired ? 
 You have to experience this if you want to be an extraordinary reporter . 
 Who's the woman you talked to just now ? 
 Oh , no wonder you're so respectful to her . 
 Good idea . We could meet on Monday or Tuesday . Which day would you prefer ? 
 OK . Do you think we should meet in the morning or in the afternoon ? 
 That will work out . I will e-mail the exact time tomorrow . I need you to bring your plans with you . 
 Should we invite the whole committee or should we just have the sub-committee there ? 
 Yes , I agree . We'll make sure that they get notified . Can you find the meeting place ? 
 Great ! We will send you all the details later . Looking forward to meeting with you ! 
 Thank you for inviting me . 
 Yes . I was in charge of profit and loss for the northwest region of Canada . As a manager , I was directly responsible for a 50 % increase in sales over a four-month period . 
 I believe persistence and perseverance are key attributes . 
 Get in , please . Where to , madam ? 
 I can't promise anything , but I'll try my best . 
 That'll be 10 dollars , please . 
 Hey . Steven . You have a large chunk of money , but why do you still live in the old flat , instead of buying a new villa ? 
 But I found you always hate to part with your money . Look at the car you drive ; it's such a junker ! 
 But ... But ... 
 Maybe you are right . 
 To Australia . I'm going to visit my uncle in Brisbane for three weeks . 
 By air , of course . It takes over two weeks to go by sea . 
 Why ? Did you feel frightened ? 
 What did the pilot do ? 
 Did you land safely ? 
 Wasn't that a great flick ? I was on the edge of my seat through the whole movie . 
 Well , I'm no movie expert , but those special effects were impressive by any standards . 
 Okay . But you have to admit that it was an exciting story , especially with that surprise ending . 
 Oh , really ? How does the book end ? 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 What kind of presents do you want ? 
 OK . How about some very cool sneakers for your children ? Anyway , it won't cost you much . It's only around $ 59.95 for each pair . It might be cheaper than that in America . 
 Just a hunch , sir . 
 $ 59.95 . 
 Sorry , sir . 
 Because in this duty-free shop , your total expenditure cannot be over $ 300 and you also have one more present to buy for your wife . 
 That's good . And I can also recommend you a good one . It's the brand of DENY . 
 It's $ 60 here . 
 Of course not , sir . 
 Do you like to dance ? 
 What kind of dancing do you like ? 
 Pardon me . Does your hotel have a fitness facility ? 
 Great ! Where is it ? 
 Do I have to pay extra ? 
 What are the gym hours ? 
 Great ! Is a trainer available ? 
 I want to buy some jewellery . 
 I should like to look at some bracelets . 
 Gold ones . 
 Pure gold ones , please . This is so beautiful . I'll take it . 
 How much is it ? 
 Have you finished your work ? 
 Where is the baby ’ s mother ? 
 Look how fast that car can accelerate ! 
 Good afternoon . May I help you ? 
 Certainly , may I take your name ? I ’ ll let her know you ’ Ve arrived . 
 Ms . Stevens will be with you momentarily . Can I offer you something to drink ? 
 Here you are . Ms . Stevens is ready for you now . I ’ ll show you to her office , right this way . 
 I agree with you , but that's easier said than done . 
 Is there any particular size that you want ? 
 What do you think of this one ? It's a 16 ” pan . 
 Well , look at our aluminum pan . It's much lighter . 
 No problem . Look at this one . Same pan , but with a lightweight wooden handle . 
 I think you'll love this pan . Do you want to pay with cash ? 
 I'm sorry . I forgot to show it to you . Here it is . It comes with the pan . 
 Yes , the main stockholder is International Business Machines Corporation , namely , IBM for short . 
 I wish to work in the planning department . 
 I expect to operate computers . 
 I wish to move up to higher positions with acquisition of more experience in the future . 
 It's a twenty-minute bus ride . 
 I ’ ll work here as long as you expect me to . 
 I ’ Ve thought about that a lot . I know that many women take a job , planning to make a career of it , and then they change their mind . But I am hoping to make it my lifetime work . So if I get married , I will find some ways that I can continue my work . 
 I think so . 
 Ever since I was a young girl , I ’ Ve been clever with my hands . I ’ Ve always enjoyed doing detailed work . If I could use that ability to make your products a little better and to benefit the company , I would be happy . 
 No , nothing in particular . 
 I'll first get further information about our goals , ways , counterparts and management , etc . . Then I ’ ll make my plan . And then I ’ ll go with all my effort to see it is realized . 
 I ’ ll report it honestly . I ’ ll give a correct analysis . I may quit the job - and pay compensation . But I have my way to judge whether I fail . 
 People are supposed to work hard within regular work time , especially when it is an important work that is highly paid for . I don ’ t mind work over spare time if it is paid for . 
 Getting more experience with a widely-known company like yours . Using my speciality in marketing and management . And getting advancement in salary and position . Show my enterprise , confidence and character in passing . 
 I would select the individual that has the most qualifications among all the applicants . He doesn ’ t have to be the person if we have to fill the vacancy . But he has to be the best , even if we have to pay him higher . 
 I will feel it is a pity . But I will not feel so bad . I will go for other interviews until I am employed satisfactorily . Hopefully before I find another position , you will call me back . 
 What is that problem , sir ? 
 Are you sure , sir ? Flies I could believe , but cockroaches ? 
 Sir , we run a spotless and cockroach-less hotel . 
 I'm sorry , sir . Let me transfer you to my supervisor . 
 Fill it up with regular , please . 
 No , thanks . I'm in a hurry . 
 Good ! How much is it ? 
 That is expensive . 
 Don't open any of my forwards ! I got a virus ! 
 Yes , that's exactly the bug I got . Though , I do kind of like the pictures . 
 Wait a second-are these pictures copyrighted ? 
 Are you doing anything tomorrow morning ? I'm wondering if you'd like to come to my office to discuss the new project . 
 Then I'll see you in the afternoon . 
 Hi , I haven't seen you in a while . 
 How long has it been since we last saw each other ? 
 What have you been doing for the past two years ? 
 What are you majoring in ? 
 You should easily be able to find a job with that major . 
 Good morning , what can I do for you ? 
 Oh , I see . Would you mind telling me your monthly salary ? 
 OK . We can supply you a loan . How much do you want to loan ? 
 It's only 4.5 % for one-year loan . Do you want to apply now ? 
 OK . Please fill out this loan application . 
 My pleasure . 
 Nothing really . 
 What's on these days ? 
 That sounds pretty good . Let's watch that . 
 How about at the subway entrance . 
 Did you tell others that we are getting married soon ? You have such a big mouth ! 
 Welcome to Al ’ s Garage . What seems to be the problem ? 
 Very wise decision . When was the last time you had a tune up ? 
 We usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers . 
 First of all , we change the motor oil and oil filter . If you don ’ t do this , it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves . 
 We also check your spark plugs , fuel filter , and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones . 
 Trust me , regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs . 
 That was a cake walk.It ’ s nothing to speak of . 
 What you said is true . But the film producers there are more flexible ways to get more audience . For example , to make more movie Ccds , so people will spend money buying them . 
 Yes . Take myself for example . I seldom go to cinemas , but it doesn't mean I no longer see films ; instead , I see films at home-watching Ccds . 
 Yes . What can I do for you ? 
 What ’ s your name ? 
 You have been in Peking University , hadn't you ? 
 What degree do you have now ? : 
 Do you have any experience in this field ? 
 Why are you interested in the position ? 
 All right . If we decide to hire you , we'd pay you 5,000 yuan a month at the start . How do you think about it ? 
 Would you like a lift home ? 
 Oh dear , my weight has gone up again . 
 And I suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office doesn't help . 
 I do wish I could lose weight . 
 I've tried diets before but they've never worked . 
 Yes , maybe I should . 
 Yes , I do . I also use an anti-spyware program and a firewall . There are so many nasties on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . You have to be very careful and keep you computer clean . 
 I usually run it every few days . It finds a virus about half the time . 
 How you tried this one ? It ’ s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . You can also download updates for free . 
 Just a minute ... go to this one . I ’ ll send you an email with the line in it . It only takes a few minutes to download . Then you have to go through the set up procedures . But they are not complicated . 
 I use it for several things-surfing the net , word processing and creating presentations . I don ’ t play many games on my computer , but I do a lot of work with photographs . Using c computer program , you can edit and resize photographs . You can also make them brighter or darker and cut pieces from different photographs to create new ones . 
 At last ! The weekend comes again ! 
 After five days ' hard work , I'm surely going to have some fun . 
 It is so quiet here . I like the place . 
 I can't stand the loud noise in the city . 
 I hope I can stay here longer . 
 The day after tomorrow . 
 Yes , you are right . 
 It's easy to get loose bowels in summer . 
 You ’ Ve got to be careful on the food you eat . 
 Good morning , sir . Is there a bank near here ? 
 Well , that's too far.Can you change some money for me ? 
 RIB . 
 1000 Yuan.Here you are . 
 I'd like to very much . 
 Who's playing ? 
 Do you know what they are playing ? 
 And who is directing ? 
 hey , Lucas , how was your trip to Paris ? 
 did you go to the top of the Eiffel Tower ? 
 what else did you see ? 
 you must have had a great time . 
 yes , you need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroad . Sometimes new food might disagree with you . 
 that is great . Everyone says French food is wonderful . 
 Hello , John . How are you ? 
 Very well , thanks . Nice to see you again . I haven't seen you for a long time . What have you been doing lately ? 
 Fine , thanks . I've been busy lately . 
 I've been studying for my exams . My school exams will begin next month . 
 Thanks . And how are your parents ? 
 Where are you going now ? 
 I can't . I have to meet someone . 
 Good-bye . See you again sometime . 
 I need to find a new way of getting my insurance . 
 Could you give me some details about that ? 
 That sounds great . More dividends if I want to purchase them ! 
 I'll go through the materials that you have given me and return shortly . Thanks . 
 Well , of course I can ’ t miss it . Which team are you for ? 
 Me too . Do you think they are going to get the championship this time ? 
 I hear little Bob has recovered . 
 The operation was very successful . 
 It's such a nice day . 
 It looks like it may rain soon . 
 Why is that ? 
 Me too . It always smells so fresh after it rains . 
 Really ? Why is that ? 
 I really hope it rains today . 
 The Spring Festival is drawing close . By then we will have five days off . I am expecting it . 
 Just like you celebrate Christmas , we celebrate our lunar New Year's Day , the Spring Festival . It is a time for the family members and relatives to have a get-together . 
 Christmas has more religious nature , while our Spring Festival is a more traditional holiday . On the New Year's Eve , we have a big dinner called ' Family Reunion Dinner ' . One of the traditional food to eat at the dinner is dumplings . After that , the adults usually sit chatting , watching TV , or playing cards . 
 They usually go outside to play firecrackers and fireworks . 
 Perhaps it is like what people told you . At 24 hours midnight , the time when the New Year really comes , we exchange ' Happy New Year ' to each other , and parents and grandparents will take out small packages wrapped with red paper , in them are some what we call ' Lucky Money . 
 Of course the children . 
 And the winner is ... Vivian , again ! I don't believe it ! 
 Well , there are still some consolation prizes . We can go up to the front and pick them up . 
 A lousy desk lamp . And you ? 
 Look at Vivian ! She thinks she's the cat's meow ! 
 Bill , please . 
 Excuse me , what's this item for ? 
 But we've can canceled one bottle . 
 I'm sorry for the miscalculation . Here's the new bill . Would you mind checking it again ? 
 If you're staying at our hotel , you may sign the bill . 
 This is James Hong calling from Lincoln Bank . 
 I'm calling to let you know that the funds for NX567822100007 have arrived . 
 Well , it's here now . Shall we credit that straight to your account ? 
 Hey , Joe ! Where have you been these past few days ? 
 Cool ! I ’ Ve always wanted to do something like that ! Have you learned anything useful ? 
 Have you treated any real emergencies ? 
 I can imagine ! I tend to faint when I see blood , so I think I won ’ t be taking up a course like that anytime soon ! 
 Hello , this is John . I want to speak to Linda . 
 Hi , Linda , I'm just calling to invite you to a dinner party tomorrow evening . 
 7:30 PM at London-Chinese restaurant . I \ ' ll be at your place at seven to pick you up if you need a ride . 
 See you tomorrow at seven . Make sure your dress a little formally . I heard the restaurant is kind of upscale . 
 See you . 
 Really ? Why would you worry about me ? I ’ m just fine . 
 No way ! I like my apartment , and I like to be independent . 
 Not at all . I see you and your family twice a week , and I enjoy seeing my own friends . I ’ m too busy to feel lonely ! 
 I missed it . I watch a live show of a concert . 
 Love Music Woman 
 That's all right . 
 Fine , and you ? 
 All except the back door . I left that open for Tim . He took the dog for a walk . 
 Ok , I ’ m going to stay up awhile . I ’ Ve got to go over the household budget , We ‘ re a little over-spend this month . 
 Ok , Good night , see you at breakfast . 
 Very well , thank you . And you ? 
 That's right . How nice to see you again . 
 they are doing well . 
 Of course . They will be happy you asked about them . 
 Can I give you a hand ? 
 Sure thing . I've got time . 
 Fine , thanks . 
 Well , Yes . There are something wrong actually . Perhaps you can give me some advice . 
 Well , Last night when I returned from thetheatre I found I lost my wallet . 
 Well , some money of course , a vise , all my identity cards and some photos . 
 Yes , I have already done that and they already look for it . I ’ ll leaving soon and I need my vise and identity cards badly . 
 Yes , quite sure . 
 But that takes too long . 
 Hi there ! My name ’ s Terry Graham . You ’ re new around here , huh ? 
 Well , if there ’ s anything I can do for you , let me know . 
 I heard that your previous manager was very capable , he is a good manger . 
 What do you mean ? 
 How you celebrate your Valentine ’ s Day with your wife ? 
 what's your favourite steps ? 
 how about rock and roll 。 
 and can you dance tango ? 
 don't be so modest . i am sure you can dance it very well . then i'll see you at six . is that all right ? 
 great . i am your lucky fellow then . 
 I'd rather you didn't . 
 I ’ m trying to put the vase on the shelf . 
 No , thank you . I can manage it , I think . 
 I think a mountain village is splendid ! 
 It has fresh air , and it is nicer than a big town . 
 But I like the small mountain village . The big town is noisy . How charming it is when walking along the hill ! 
 Have you met the new girl ? 
 She's one of the prettiest girls at the school . 
 Well , she's quite short . 
 I would say she's only 5 feet . 
 She has light brown eyes , absolutely beautiful . 
 Have you seen her ? 
 Could you tell me something about investment environment of your country ? 
 Well , what about price ? 
 Waiter , we have been waiting for 20 minutes . Would you mind hurrying ? 
 That's fine . Would you please bring me some wine ? 
 Yes . Thank you . 
 Why ? 
 Really ? Well . Ok . Get the receipts out . 
 That's 1,825 dollars . 
 3,075 . Our paychecks are 3300 combined . That means we don't have any receipts for 225 . 
 Good afternoon . How can I help ? 
 Yes , you can . Is that US dollars or HK dollars ? Both are available for exchange to RIB . How much would you like to exchange ? 
 Today's rate is 821.32 USD to 100 RIB , which isn't bad . 
 A Westerner said to his Chinese friend . “ Chinese people slurp when drinking soup . It ’ s disgusting . ” The Chinese friend replied , “ Westerners make a lot of noise licking their fingers when eating . It ’ s even worse . ” 
 I attended a course on table manners while I was in the United States . Some of the things we learnt included how to place the napkin and utensils and how to pass the bread . Before each course , the teacher would ask if we wanted to learn the Continental European way or the American way . We always said “ American way . ” It ’ s amazing that everyone is so used to their own table manners . What is the Chinese way ? 
 Not really . I did some research about Chinese table manners . The important rule is to remain silent while eating . Of course , this refers to family meals only . Not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health . It is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party . The table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated . Each dish should be placed in the correct position . When fish is served , the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty . If it is in winter , the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter . Each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table . The diners should sit close to the table so food won ’ t drop on their cloths . No noise should be made when chewing . No one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn ’ t like it . One should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise . All these table manners are very similar to Western habits . 
 Yes . We say “ eat well and drink well . ” 
 You need to fill out a special form to apply for unemployment benefits . 
 You can call the Employment Development Office and request a form . 
 Be prepared to provide your employer ’ s name and address and what dates you worked . 
 You need to be prepared to show that your unemployment is not your fault . If you have a termination notice , that would be great . 
 The Employment Development Office will call you for an interview . 
 You can catch the 486 . 
 I believe so . 
 It only takes 45 minutes to an hour . 
 It's a pretty short trip . 
 It only gets crowded once it gets to LA . 
 No problem . 
 No , thank you . Check , please . 
 Here are $ 40 . Keep the change . That's my tip for you . 
 I am , sir . 
 Yes , sir . 
 We actually met at a dance party . He fell for me . 
 He said that I put all other girls in the shade . 
 Well , he indeed likes me . 
 No , he is the sort of man who likes to hide his candle under a bushel . 
 Just say the word , sir . 
 I agree . The dew is still on the grass . 
 We do have a storage space for your bags . There's a small charge , plus a deposit . 
 Regrettably , no . But simply present your VISA to cover your deposit . 
 Okay , sir , but don't think too long . Your checkout is only 30 minutes away . 
 Yes , I have a driving license . 
 Sure . 
 That's fine with me . 
 As long as it isn't too far from this city , I don't mind . 
 I think I can commute that far without any trouble . 
 No , nothing in particular . Thank you . 
 Yes , but I don't mind working hard . 
 would you mind if I helped out in the kitchen instead ? I do enjoy cooking . 
 cooking makes me feel relaxed . So , what are we cooking ? 
 sure . We should probably pre-heat the oven right away , too . 
 that's a bit high for lasagne . I'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there . 
 you know , I could do this myself . Why don't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ? 
 well , if it's not broken , then you need to learn how to vacuum better , because it doesn't look like you've vacuumed for ages ! 
 We still have one more day to go before we return home . What will we see tomorrow ? 
 what about a factory tour ? 
 yes . I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which open to the public every weekend . We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry . 
 I'm not sure , but as far as I know , most factory tours are free . They are sponsored by the company providing the tour . 
 I believe most of them think of it as good public relations . They can promote their product and make their company better-known . 
 exactly . 
 I'll call the tourist information centre to check . 
 Yes , he does . He of ten has had one to many . But I advised him not to drink too much , he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table . 
 Shall we have two tickets for for seven thirty ? 
 In the front , please . 
 Well ... alright . I guess I have a minute . 
 I've heard about it , but I don't really know about it . 
 What about beer ? 
 That's pretty cool . How much of a discount ? 
 And all these other things , pizza and movies for instance--how much of a discount do I get on that stuff ? 
 Alright , alright . Let me look at that pamphlet.Hmm . Alessio's Pizza Parlor . That's cool . I go there all the time.And Cosmo's Club . And 4 - D records . Alright . How much does it cost ? 
 Whoa ! That's expensive ! It should be cheaper . 
 Yeah , maybe . Alright . Give me an application form . 
 Nothing much . 
 Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy . or a kitty ! 
 I will ! I ’ ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard ! 
 Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ? 
 Fine ! Let ’ s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome ! 
 Yay ! 
 Is This where I pay the airport tax ? 
 I'm sorry , but I've never done this before . How many what ? 
 My wife and me . The two of us . 
 Oh , OK . Here's 200 yuan . 
 Thanks . What shall I do then ? 
 Oh , I guess I'm a little confused . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 I know it's not good for me , but the problem is I just can't help it . 
 I'll try . 
 Stop picking on me . I am going to be mad . 
 I am.What can I do for you ? 
 Very good , you majored in International Trade ? 
 Well , for this position , we prefer experienced employees , Those who have just graduated from university , they are supposed to start by working as an intern for at least half a year . 
 Good.That is the kind of man we are looking for.By the way , do you like traveling ? Our sales representatives need to travel a lot . 
 Are you willing to work for extra hours ? 
 What about next Monday ? 
 Well , see you next monday . 
 I have some shirts that need laundering , and I ’ d like my suit pressed . 
 How long will it take to get my clothes back ? 
 That ’ s all right . Pls send someone to pick it up . 
 Excuse me , Mr . Emory ? 
 Could you tell me where the copier is , please ? 
 May I help you ? 
 Here we can exchange HAD , USD and Euros . Which do you require ? 
 At the moment it's 830.43 RIB for 100 USD , which is a pretty good rate . 
 May I see your passport ? 
 How long are you going to stay ? 
 What is the purpose for your visit ? 
 Where are you going to stay ? 
 Do you have anything to declare ? 
 What a nice day ! 
 Great , let's go ! 
 Exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ... 
 Why not go again to celebrate our one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant . 
 Never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ? 
 Ok . I'll make the arrangements . It will be great . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 What do you need me for ? 
 What are you being charged with ? 
 I ’ m willing to provide my services . 
 I work for $ 150 an hour . 
 That ’ s what I charge . 
 I think your presentation impressed the client , Daniel . You did a good job . 
 Is there a car park near the supermarket ? 
 I see . Thanks . 
 Of course . 
 With pleasure . I think we should go to the palace first . 
 Good afternoon . Which service do you require . 
 What you need to do is apply for an amendment on your existing L / C . 
 You'll need to fill in this application form and there is a charge of 30 US dollars for this . 
 Thanks . Yes ... that's all in order . What we will do now is send the L / C amendment to the negotiating bank . As soon as we know anything , we'll contact you . 
 I can hardly make ends meet these days . 
 My income remains the same but prices just continue to rise . 
 Definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month . 
 Actually , I learn many things from it . I find that I am a quick learner in new things . 
 At first I didn't know anything about the machine . Now I know how to operate it . Besides , the work gives me a sense of fulfillment and achievement . 
 Thank you . That's a long way to go for my job . 
 OK , let's go . 
 I suppose we can bring him to visit our company , as well as our display room . In this way , he can know more about our company and our potential power . In my opinion , visiting the factory will help him learn our manufacturing process very much . 
 Well , I understand . 
 Let ’ s see if we can reach some sort of agreement over your curfew . 
 Well , I ’ m not everyone-else ’ s father . I think you need be in the house by ten o ’ clock . 
 I ’ ll be worried if you stay out late . 
 would you like to learn to tango Donar ? 
 i am offering you my services . for your church . what do you say ? 
 of what ? 
 no mistakes in a tango Donar.not like life , simple , that will make the tango so great . if you make a mistake , you'll get all tango done . just tango along . why don't you try ? will you try it . 
 Can I take your order please ? 
 Sure . Anything to drink with that ? 
 Eating here or to go ? 
 That's 7 dollars and 25 cents . You can get free refills with your coke . 
 I don't think so.It ' s impossible to equate wealth and happiness . 
 Of course not.Sometimes a poor man can be extremely miserable . 
 I didn't know you did Yoga . 
 What have you learned ? 
 As opposed to short and shallow ? 
 I read something like that once . I think it was , ' Life is in the breath . ' 
 You should be optimistic about this . Things have taken a good turn . You should remember that less than two centuries ago the dangers of train travel seemed similarly terrible . 
 It's once in blue moon . 
 The main one is radiation . There are two sorts of radiation man must fear in space . The first is radiation from the sun , and this is particularly dangerous when the sun is very active and explosions are occurring on its surface . The second , less harmful , comes from the so-called Van Allen Belts . 
 Yeah . You can take them home and either use them as a gift or keep them as mementoes . 
 I'd suggest that you go to the Philately Store in Nanjing Road East , where the items are authentic and the prices are reasonable . 
 You're always welcome . Anything else can I do for you , sir ? 
 I guess it is . The restaurant is on the second floor . Please enjoy your dinner , sir ! 
 No , I don't . 
 That sounds like a good idea . 
 Oh , do you ? Good . 
 Yes , I'm glad we've had very pleasant cooperation in the previous years . And your achievement for promoting our clothes was great in the three years . 
 To be frank , you are not the only one who applies for an agent for us in your country . I'd like to know some ideas of terms on which you would be willing to operate as our agent . 
 Sounds reasonable . I will tell my boss about you agent application . Another question , what do you think is the minimum annual sales you can guarantee ? 
 Well . As our sole agency , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own . 
 What a coincidence seeing you here . ! 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 Let me give you a hand.The author is ... 
 Oh , yes.Here it is . 
 Yes , we have both the paperback and hardcover.which would you want to buy ? 
 It's $ 25 . 
 Hi , Alex . How are you doing ? 
 I know the feeling . I ’ m calling to let you know about this new Italian place I found . It ’ s right around the corner . 
 You ’ Ve been a sales manager for three years . How do you like the job ? 
 If I may ask , are you happy with your salary ? 
 Is there a bonus system or any other incentive plan in place ? 
 What is your salary expectation for this position ? 
 Is this the A housing office ? 
 I was hoping to get into something on campus , but my friend told me that everything is full . 
 Please . And in the mean time , can I look at apartments available in the area from this office ? 
 Who do I talk to if I want I to see some of them ? 
 Good afternoon , Mrs . White . 
 Can I see Mr . Cooper , your manager now ? 
 All right . 
 Thanks a lot , Mrs . White . 
 Beth , would you like me to help you carry it ? 
 Don't be silly . It's no trouble at all . 
 Don ’ t worry , you can pay in an installment , that is to say , you don ’ t have to pay the whole amount of money at once . 
 Certainly , you need to pay a deposit at first , and you will pay the rest monthly . 
 It depends . 
 Certainly . 
 I need to do a credit investigation on another company , but I'm worried it'll be a bit difficult . 
 Well , it's an American company , you see . I'm worried that there will be too much red tape involved . 
 Really ? I have been told , by another bank , that it makes it difficult if you want to investigate a company which is registered outside China . 
 I'm not exactly prepared right now . How about I go back to the office , get the relevant information and come back before closing ? 
 I'll return at about 4:30 pm . See you then . 
 It ’ s horrible . Why do drivers run a red light then ? 
 Talking on the cell phone while driving is very dangerous too . It increases the chance of accidents . 
 Oh man ! I ’ Ve been starving myself for days now and I haven ’ t lost an ounce ! 
 Yeah , my friend is getting married next month and I ’ m supposed to be a bridesmaid . I have to fit into my dress and look nice for her wedding , but I haven ’ t lost any weight ! Look at these love handles . 
 Why ? If I eat less , then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves , right ? 
 So you are saying that I should eat , but I should just watch what I eat ? 
 If I do all this do you think I can lose twenty pounds in four weeks ? 
 I guess I'd better go now . 
 In that case , I'll be seeing you . 
 Here's the schedule we've prepared . 
 Do you mind if we talk about your schedule tomorrow ? 
 And this is the schedule for Mrs . Watson . Eileen from our department will take care of her . 
 All right . I'll see you in the lobby tomorrow morning . 
 Hi ! Crenshaw and Hawthorne , at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner . 
 From China . 
 It ’ s fine . I am actually from Mexico . I was in China on a business trip , visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products . 
 Don ’ t you know it ’ s rude to ask a lady her age ? 
 Well thank you ! In that case , I am 26 years old , and what about yourself ? 
 Really ? That ’ s great ! Do you speak some Spanish ? 
 Have you finished that report yet ? 
 How much time do you need ? 
 Hey honey , how was your day ? 
 Why ? What happened ? 
 Yeah , you ’ re right . We aren ’ t getting any younger and our kids are getting older . 
 Sounds good , although , do you think we can qualify for insurance ? Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money . 
 I wish our company or country provided us with healthcare . 
 Well , you know how important a clean house is to your grandma . 
 She was the head janitor at St . Mary's Hospital for thirty years , after all . 
 You know , maybe she's just a neat freak . 
 You could be right . 
 What scene ? 
 Mr . : Are you Mary Lin ? 
 Mr . : I'm Mr . Rogers , your homeroom teacher . 
 Mr . : Why don't you sit behind Brad ? 
 Mr . : He's that guy in the blue shirt . 
 Mr . : As soon as the bell rings after the morning announcement . 
 Oh , thanks a lot . 
 1 thirty P . m . But I've got to check in at 12 thirty P . m . 
 Pan American Airlines . Flight 282 . 
 Ok . See you tomorrow . 
 Project Management . I was very interested in this course when I was a student . And I think it's very useful for my present work . 
 Yes , I have studied in an English training program and a computer training program since I graduated from university . I am currently studying Finance at a training school . 
 Although I am a little shocked , I can deal with it pretty well . I didn't perform as well as I should have in the interview . 
 OK , thank you , I'll try if there were other chances . 
 Yes , I'm excited to hear about your new product . 
 Yes . I've heard a lot about it . 
 Yes , I would have to agree with you . It seems to offer more options than the others . But new product sometimes has a few troubles . How about yours ? 
 How do you ensure quality ? 
 Are your prices negotiable ? 
 What happens if I am not satisfied with my purchases ? 
 I see . But I have to discuss it over with my boss before I make a decision . 
 Hello , I'd like to get a seat on flight PB12 to Rome . 
 Is there any discount for a non-direct flight ? 
 What if I buy around ticket ? Can you offer me some more ? 
 I've come to apologize for what I said yesterday . 
 I must make an apology for losing my temper . 
 I ’ m relieved to hear that . Anyway , it ’ s my fault . 
 I've got them . 
 Good afternoon . Mr . Tylor's office ? 
 I'm sorry , but could you please transfer this call to Mr . Tylor's office ? 
 Thank you . 
 You are so kind , you helped me a lot . 
 Your tree looks beautiful . Do you decorate it this way every year ? 
 Well , everything seems to be just about ready . Now all we need is snow.Do you exchange the presents in the morning ? 
 And we'll have a great turkey dinner at around four o'clock . My brother and his family will be joining us . I look forward to meeting them . Well , it's late , so I'll say good night . I'll see you early tomorrow , so I can share your Christmas morning.Good night ! 
 Sorry , but I ’ m not really that interested in those things . 
 Really ? 
 Oh , I don't care about that . 
 Are they ? 
 I am afraid I am not interested in fashion . 
 But thank you very much all the same . 
 Hi , what ’ re you reading ? 
 No , not that one . But I saw the movie . Could I borrow it when you finished ? 
 Oh , I ’ m crazy about them . 
 It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld . 
 Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ? 
 I've had that problem too many times . So I learned to save.When I'm writing something , I save every three sentences or so . I don't want to lose anything . 
 What are we going to do now ? 
 I wonder how much of the city is down . 
 Maybe . But if there's a blackout , probably the pubs are closed.And besides , I know you have a political science exam tomorrow . I thought you had a lot of reading to do . 
 I have a flashlight in my closet . If you want to use that to read , you can . 
 I like your idea of getting a beer . I think I'll go out myself . 
 No , it just won't work.If I read for your exam , you won't know the answers tomorrow . I will . 
 How many students are in the class ? 
 So it won't work , old buddy . They'll see that I'm not you . Sorry . 
 Hello ! Is your company advertising for administrative assistant on the newspapers ? 
 First I want to check about the availability and see if you could give me more information . 
 Of course . I will deliver my resume to you in minutes ' time . I hope you will consider my application and I shall appreciate a reply at your earliest convenience . 
 Bye . 
 Yes , What can I do for you , sir ? 
 I can try to arrange that for you . 
 Can you describe for me , where you were sitting ? 
 You're in luck . We still have that little table . 
 Yes . I could use a cup of coffee . 
 French toast sounds good . What are you going to order ? 
 Marriott Street . 
 M , A , double R , I , O , double T . 
 That dress is too expensive . 
 Yes , it is pretty , but it costs $ 200 . What about this one ? It ’ s almost the same , but it costs half as much . 
 It ’ s just a little shorter . 
 Well , it ’ s your money . You can spend it however you want . Do you really think it ’ s pretty ? 
 Ok , so who are we going to invite to our dinner party ? 
 Don't forget my friend Andy from the office . He has nothing to do on Friday , so I invited him over . 
 Why can't we ? 
 I'm not sure . He just broke up with his girlfriend recently , and I don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon . 
 I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill . It's only a superstition . It really doesn't mean anything . 
 Ok , ok . I'll ask my sister to come . That way we'll have fourteen for dinner . 
 I've been told that you are a very successful businessman abroad . I wonder how you managed to achieve such success ? 
 I suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first , wasn't it ? 
 You mean you didn't know much English then ? 
 That's incredible . Could you tell me what you did to make a start ? 
 Really ? I wish you could tell me more about your experience . 
 Let's take a break . 
 Sounds good . 
 Yes . I'd like to buy a sweater for my husband . Which style is the latest ? 
 I like this style . But do you have any other colors ? I feel that this color doesn't suit his complexion . 
 Great ! I will take it . And could you suggest a pair of trousers to match this sweater ? 
 Let me see . Yes , they are perfectly matched ! 
 Not yet , Dad . I am watching Ultraman instead.No , no , Dad . Please . This program is on only once a week . 
 What makes you think that ? 
 But there are cartoons on TV . Bees , big trees , seas , and a lot of other interesting things . 
 About 6 . 
 Dad , it's not fair . I am so disappointed with you ! 
 I did for a while , I suppose , until I left university , but after that not really . 
 Oh yes , how's she getting on ? 
 What , from Peter ? 
 Good morning , and welcome to Live Tech . It is my honor to make this presentation for you . Let me begin by explaining some of our digital cameras ' selling points . You will see immediately that they are very stylish , but what you can't see is the cutting-edge technology inside . All of our cameras are light , compact , and easy to use . 
 Be my guest . Live Tech's digital cameras combine point-and-shoot simplicity with the ability to easily turn pictures into great-looking prints . Furthermore , it allows users to transfer pictures to a computer while the camera recharges . 
 Sure , Just push the button , like ... 
 I think you will find these are the best digital cameras on the market today . 
 What do you do in your spare times ? 
 What sports do you like best ? 
 Do you like reading books ? 
 Who are you favourite authors ? 
 How do you put this seat back ? I know there is a lever somewhere . 
 I'm getting dressed , what does it look like ? 
 I'm good at this . Nobody will see anything . 
 All right , pull over at that service station and I'll dress in the ladies ' room . 
 And how will you be paying for your room , Ms White ? 
 Both rooms on the same card ? 
 Your card number please ? 
 Double one , zero two ? 
 4434 1234 5678 9902 ? 
 And the expiry date ? 
 Could you repeat that please ? 
 Thank you . I've booked two rooms for Ms White and Mr Webber from Wednesday the 25th to Saturday the 28th of September . 
 You're welcome . We'll see you on the 25th , Ms White . 
 Goodbye . 
 Yes . Now we are in the Olympic stadium , the center of this park . 
 The whole stadium is to be finished this June . 
 Oh , there are 5000 seats in total . 
 It is ! Look there , those are the tracks . And the jumping pit is over there . 
 We put many signs with English translations for foreign visitors . 
 You don ’ t need to carry the furniture home because we have delivery service . 
 Wo will deliver the goods to you for free . 
 Sure . Please write down your name and your phone number . 
 No later than tomorrow . 
 How can we develop a new brand image with no direction whatsoever ? 
 I guess this is a good excuse to surf the Net on someone else's dime . 
 He must have just got online for the first time last week . He still thinks it's some kind of new toy . 
 Yes , luckily our office is just down the street . 
 Oh , I see . 
 Hi ! Good morning , Sarah ! 
 I have not seen you for a long time . How are you ? 
 What are your symptoms ? 
 Where is the pain ? Could you show me please ? 
 What kind of pain ? Sharp pain , dull pain or severe pain ? 
 Is the pain continuous ? 
 Please lie down over there . 
 Does it hurt when I push here ? 
 What about here ? 
 How long have you been like this ? 
 How about your appetite ? 
 How about your bowel movements ? 
 I am so busy today . 
 I ’ m not sure . Perhaps you could do the shopping . 
 Or maybe make the beds . 
 Thanks . That ’ s terrific ! 
 Oops ! 
 I overcooked the corn . 
 Thanks . Sometimes talking with a friend is a great way to get over something . Do you mind if I vent a little bit ? 
 Great , because I am really mad at William . I mean , what kind of an idiot wouldn't be able to appreciate a smart , beautiful woman like me ? Anybody who would be friends with that guy has to be really dumb . 
 Oh right ... present company excluded , of course ! 
 I don't mind . Go ahead . 
 OK . You can keep it as long as you need . 
 Oh , it seems there is nothing that evening . 
 I'd like to , where ? 
 When ? 
 I'll go in time , thank you . 
 I'm so glad that the Spring Festival is near at hand . 
 Think of the big face down the eve , hmm . 
 Hey , do you know any mystery belief serve the festival ? 
 You know why fire crackers are set off in festival . 
 And also to frighten away evil spirits . 
 And my parents say the whole year will be as good or as bad as new year day itself and bad or rude words on the day will bring a bad year . 
 How do you think a manager should react to an employee ’ s unsatisfactory work ? 
 Exactly , I overheard a manager scold his employee in the elevator this morning , they were from the company on the 12th floor , I guess . They were only three of us in the elevator , I felt very embarrassed to be in the middle of them . 
 Sure , no matter what happened , they should wait to discuss in their office and find the solution in a positive way . 
 You don ’ t love me , Roy . 
 No , you used to be . But not now . You are in love with someone else . You are in love with my friend , Janet . You appreciate her very much . You think she is beautiful and fun to be with and you think I ’ m dumb and uninteresting . 
 I envy her and also I hate her at the same time . 
 Oh , shut up , Roy . 
 Oh , SHUT UP ! 
 That's great . 
 Don't worry . There are all kinds of things in the center . 
 Who's calling , please ? 
 What is it , John ? 
 Good morning . Thank you for the interview . 
 Actually , I enjoy both . 
 I need job security . 
 I am open to relocating . 
 I need at least 75,000 per year . 
 Excuse me . I've been waiting for my main dish for quite a time . 
 Thank you for waiting.It takes another ten to fifteen minutes , I'm afraid . 
 I see . 
 Well , yes.How about beef stew ? We can serve you at once . 
 If I remember correctly , time of delivery is another point on wich we differ . 
 Ok . I hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of Sep . We'd like them to be there in time for our Christmas sales . 
 But in the United States the Christmas season begins about a month before Dec . 25 . 
 I hope you'll try to get them to step up production . 
 If that's the case , there is nothing more to be said . 
 What's your last word as to the date then ? 
 All right . I'll take you at your word . 
 I promise . 
 Sorry . Were you trying to sleep ? 
 I'm sorry . You're right . I should have asked . 
 I haven't gone to get it yet . 
 I don't know where to go to get one . 
 Where do I get it ? 
 I had no idea . 
 Thank you . 
 I'll buy it later on today . 
 Thank you , Mr . Jackson , ladies and gentlemen , colleagues , friends . The subject of my talk is international relations in a morgen world . I plan to say a few words about the current situation in the Middle East and how it affects world economy . I'd like to give you an overview of the way that the economies of seemingly unrelated countries are intertwined . I've divided my talk into three parts , first an overview of international relations , second a discussion of current political situations , and lastly trends for the future . My presentation will take about two hours , but there will be a twenty-minute break in the middle . We'll stop for lunch at 12 . 
 Hi , Tom . How have you been ? 
 What do you need ? 
 You have your library card , right ? 
 There is a wait right now to use the computers . 
 Would you please write your name on this list ? 
 I will call you when a computer is free . 
 Use the number on the back of your library card . 
 The boat is ready to leave.Everyone come onto the ship , please . 
 Can I see your ticket ? 
 Your seat is in cabin No . 5 , the upper deck . It ’ s near amid ship . 
 There ! ( Point out the direction . ) You can see a window there . 
 You are welcome . Have a good trip ! 
 Cheer up ! It's not the only chance in life to do well on a test . There'll be many more . 
 Don't worry about it . All in all , you've done very well in school . 
 I want a shirt . 
 Well , do you have the same in black ? 
 I can't bear you anymore . I am sick of your drinking . I am divorcing you . 
 How many chances should I give you ? I've given up on you ! 
 hello , Deva , how are you ? 
 not bad . Have you heard Wendy divorced her husband ? 
 Yes . They used to be joined at the hip . 
 yes , she said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things . 
 you said it . You know , they fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage . 
 yeah . We Chinese have quite different lifestyles and values from foreigners . 
 we've heard so much about Chinese film stars divorcing foreigners . 
 Excuse me . Could you tell me the way to the Star Hotel ? 
 How long will it take me to get there ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Reciting texts really bores me to death . 
 Yes , the teacher says recitation is real good . 
 Fortunately , there is no person died . 
 Yeah . Earthquake is one of the most badly natural disasters in the world . 
 Well , China is located on the Eurasia plate , where earthquakes happen frequently due to the earth's plates knocking against each other . 
 Yeah , we've experienced the 8.0 magnitude earthquake in Wenchman . 
 Right . But people at that time only know two words , " save " and " assistance " , they will never don't lift a finger . Life is the most important compared with anything else . 
 What are your career goals , Miss Li ? 
 Great ! It sounds like you might be a good fit . As you know , we ’ re one of the largest brokerage houses in the world . Our daily work is quite hectic , and we , re looking for an assistant who can keep us organized ... help keep the engines running smoothly , so to speak . Our hours are long , but the overtime pay is good ... sort of makes up for the long hours . 
 Well , that ’ s the problem . We never seem to have ' typical ' days , but you'd spend about 30 % of your time on the computer . There would also be a lot of telephone time , setting up appointment , and taking care of a lot of support work . 
 Kathy ! How are you ? It's been ages ! What are you doing these days ? 
 You're kidding ! You've always hated cooking ! 
 When did you change your mind ? 
 I still can't believe it ! So , did you go to cooking school or something ? 
 Really ? How long did you stay there ? 
 And what did you do after that ? 
 How do you do , Prof.Smith . 
 Thank you . I begin to like English even when I was a child . 
 At school , in China.This is my first time to be out of my own country . 
 have you read the feature article about Oprah Winfrey in this magazine ? 
 apparently , she's being given an award for donating so much money to charity . 
 I heard that she's one of the wealthiest women in the world . 
 you know ; I heard that she was opening a school for underprivileged girls in Africa . 
 yes , she's not only building the school , but is also using her own money for the upkeep of the school and to pay the teachers a fair salary . 
 I agree . So many celebrities waste their money on sports cars , expensive clothing , and luxurious hotels . 
 what a waste . It's good to see some stars that are more concerned with charity than status symbols . 
 Oh , you don't ask much , do you ? 
 I'll tell you what . Your class can rent them from me for the night and buy back any damaged ones . 
 Not as fun though . A live band is way more exciting ! 
 Let me know with your next dance . I know a band that may give you a break for the publicity . 
 What kind of girl is she ? 
 Is her fiance Taiwanese ? 
 How old is he ? 
 Do you mind if I ask your friend out ? 
 Okay , that's good . 
 What's your favorite TV Program ? 
 I also like variety shows , but sometimes the host lacks a sense of humor . 
 What is the highest goal of your company ? 
 Well , it is a really high target . 
 I am looking for a pan . 
 A big one would be nice . 
 Oh , yes . I like that one . But it's too heavy . 
 Oh , yes , this is much better . But it has an aluminum handle . 
 Yes , that's perfect . I'll take it . 
 Oh , wait a minute . What about a lid for the pan ? 
 Shut up ... Billy ... BILLY ! 
 Wow ! What's that ? 
 It's so small that I didn't notice it . 
 Who is your favorite music composer ? 
 Then you must despise such modern music as rock ? 
 how do you usually get to school ? 
 I feel that I can see more when I pedal a bicycle , but when I feel lazy , I drive my car . 
 I agree , but I would find it difficult to stop using my car . It's just so convenient . 
 do you have a car ? 
 maybe if I sold my car now , I wouldn't be so tempted to use it . 
 that's true . Every month , I spend hundreds of dollars on gas , insurance , and repairs . 
 I could stand to lose a few pounds . Having a car has made me lazy . I never end up walking anywhere ! 
 sounds good ! Let's go ! 
 Could you spell that please ? 
 Cygnet . OK , I've got that . 
 In response to your offer , the sellers have decided to counter-offer three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars . 
 You can accept this offer or decline it and come up with another offer . 
 Personally , I would consider making one more offer , but it is up to you to decide what to do . 
 I will contact the sellers with your current offer . 
 Usually the response to the second offer moves along a bit more quickly than the first one . 
 Yes . I'd like to book a double room with bath . 
 I plan to arrive on August fifth and leave on August eighth . 
 Li Gang . 
 That's right . 
 I see . When can I receive your confirmation ? 
 I'll log in to the Internet to know about you . I know your address . 
 Our usual supplier has let us down and I ’ Ve been looking through your parts catalogue . I need fifty GT670s . How soon can you deliver ? 
 What ’ s your new job like ? 
 Um . 
 Very nice . 
 Well , that ’ s life , isn ’ t it ? 
 Take bus 12 and get off at the terminal station . 
 You are welcome . 
 Well , to start with , Markweed Inc . has a reputation for being one of the best employers in the field . 
 First of all , they have an excellent benefits package for all employees , even the maintenance staff have health and dental coverage . 
 From what I hear , they are very reasonable . A lot of the prestige the company has built is because they have attacked some high profile employees with their incentives . 
 It's a great place to work . They give you fair pay and benefits , and a lot of room to grow . I think if they off you a job , you should definitely take it . 
 Hello , Miss Wu . 
 Pretty good , thank you . And you ? 
 I need to remit £ 500 to London . 
 T / T , please . 
 Have you heard about John ’ s obscene words towards the manager ? 
 How about we go to the flea market today ? 
 Me , too . There are so many cheap but nice things . 
 May I speak to Mr . Thomas ? 
 I hate to trouble of you . But it is urgent . Please leave this message into him 
 Excuse me , sir , may I talk to you ? 
 Well sir , as you know , I have been an employee of this prestigious firm for over ten years . 
 I won ’ t beat around the bush . Sir , I would like a raise . I currently have three companies after me and so I decided to talk to you first . 
 I understand your position , and I know that the current economic downturn has had a negative impact on sales , but you must also take into consideration my hard work , pro-activeness and loyalty to this company for over a decade . 
 Great ! It ’ s a deal ! Thank you , sir ! 
 Oh , the electric company , gas company and water company ! 
 Terrible ! Does he want to divorce ? 
 Don ’ t lose your reason . Go to find him and talk with him . 
 Who ? 
 That bad egg , who took the low road since he was a boy . 
 Ok . 
 Well , I just spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother . Anyway , I have done all my work and it is about the time to leave . 
 Certainly , work always comes first . 
 Well , keep a low profile . 
 I go jogging , how about you ? 
 Oh , that's fantastic ! 
 What time would you like to see him ? 
 Just a moment , please . I'll check for you . 
 Sure , Emily . We haven't done that in a while . 
 Well , keep this under your hat , but I think I'm going to quit after New Year . 
 I know I should be pretty happy here , but I'm not finding the kind of job satisfaction I need . I'm a good graphic designer ... 
 That's kind of you to say . But ... the stuff we do here hasn't really challenged me very much at all . 
 That's one way of putting it . For me , a job needs to stimulate my brain , otherwise it becomes a daily drudgery . 
 What exactly ? 
 In your first letter , that is , when you apply for admission , you should also tell them you need their financial aid . 
 If the aid is available , they will give you two or more application forms , One is for admission , the others are for the aid . 
 They will tell you the aid is impossible . 
 Yeah , I just got back this morning . 
 Well , we were only there for three days , so we didn't do too much . We went shopping and went out to dinner a few times . And at night we walked around the city with some friends . 
 Yes , I have them with me . Do you want to look at them ? 
 This one is of my wife and me on the beach , and this one is our daughter Emily standing next to my wife . 
 I know , they look very similar . 
 That was taken at the train station before we left . 
 No , not this time . We went there last time . 
 Yeah , it was a lot of fun . 
 Yes , I am . My wife and I understand each other . 
 I don't know . But they say that Mrs . Smith wears the pants in the house . 
 That's right . She is pretty , but she wants to control everything in his life . 
 I'll go and quit my job in the ABC Company . 
 I'm afraid not , but can you make it Thursday afternoon ? 
 Yes . See you then . 
 Yes , Ma'am . May I have your name and room number ? 
 What kind of watch is it ? 
 Yes , we have it . 
 I ’ m sorry , dad . But you can ’ t do that . It ’ s for me to decide . 
 I didn ’ t say I ’ d already decided , dad . I said it was for me to decide . There is a difference . 
 I didn ’ t say that either . I was hoping we could discuss the matter together . I want your advice but I don ’ t want you to tell me what to do . I ’ Ve got to make decisions for myself , dad . 
 So he is . But , why not try to help him to become stronger ? 
 Look , that bamboo groves are flourishing . Let's go and play there . 
 ' Please don't enter the bamboo groves . ' We're not allowed to go in . 
 OK . 
 Of course I did . I dreamed to be a pilot when I grow up . But unfortunately , I didn ’ t realize it . 
 Okay , forget about that . S , do you have some practical dreams at present ? 
 You're promising . Just follow your dream and never give up . 
 Can I have this roll of film developed here ? 
 Here you are . 
 Regular will be fine . How long will it take ? 
 Good . I'll come back in the evening . 
 China National Textiles Import and Export Corporation 
 Our products are of good quality.Since the prices of textiles have gone up in the world market we've had to increase them on some items by about ten percent.If you place a large order it is possible for us to cut down the prices by five percent 
 It depends on how much you order 
 I'd rather use the CIF terms.You ' re welcome to come to talk about it in detail with your general manager and sign a contract . 
 Yes . You've done a good job . But there's one thing . You should narrow down your topic . 
 Hey , guys ! 
 How's business ? 
 Wow ! I'm impressed ! 
 I quit my job as a food critic . 
 You have been staying at home for several days . Would you like to hang out with me ? 
 When you were in school , what were your favorite subjects ? 
 Still , you must have had some subjects you enjoyed more than others . 
 That's too bad . We could really use someone who is bilingual . 
 Good afternoon . Can I be of service ? 
 Yes , of course . We have Treasury Notes with two , three and five-year terms available . 
 OK , could I take a look at some ID please , like a passport ? 
 No , I'm afraid that isn't possible . You must wait until maturity before you cash them . 
 It all depends on what you want to accomplish in your life . 
 I'm sorry to have made you disappointed . 
 Was I ? Sorry , I didn't mean to be . I do apologize . 
 Forgive me darling . I'm very tired . 
 Of course , pick up the receiver , hit a button and listen for a tone . Are you hearing it ? 
 Well , after you dial 9 on the keypad , you should hear the tone change . 
 When you dial 9 and hear the tone change it means you have an outside line . Who are you trying to call ? 
 For an outside call you now just dial the number . For a company number you need to know the extension . Do you have a list of extensions ? 
 You can always look an extension up on the company website . 
 Thank you . 
 What a lovely dog ! How did you know I love things like this ? 
 Maybe you won't believe this , but it was made by my grandmother . 
 Thank you , Please have a cup of tea . 
 How about some fish ? 
 OK.Let me make a wish ... Do you want a big piece of cake ? 
 It is so very kind of you . I'm so moved by you . 
 Well , that's life . 
 Mom , what should I do ? 
 OK . I will call Peter to clean it together . 
 Hey , your Chinese is coming along ! 
 Yeah . It ’ s a lot better than mine . 
 Hang in there . It ’ ll all come together one of these days . 
 I'd like to cancel a reservation . 
 Jim White . 
 From November 21st for 4 nights . 
 It's for myself . 
 Yes , it's Zheg In and my number is 3811658 . 
 You look so happy , Anna . Any good news ? 
 Really ? Congratulations ! 
 By the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? Tomorrow is my birthday . 
 Not so soon . It ’ s not my birthday today . Well , you ’ ll come , won ’ t you ? 
 My pleasure . 
 Hello . Is there a package tour to Beijing ? 
 Does the tour have a Chinese-speaking guide ? 
 What is the cost of the tour ? 
 It's a bit expensive . Can you tell me the schedule ? 
 Which church do you attend ? 
 What ’ s the difference between this and other Churches ? 
 Then does that mean the other churches are corrupt ? 
 Do you believe that Mormons have all of it ? 
 Why do you really go to church ? 
 I'm afraid I have lost my air ticket while I was shopping . 
 Yes , I checked again and again , but I can't find it . By the day after tomorrow , can I have the ticket reissued ? 
 I talked with the manager over the phone and he told me I can have it reissued because I have a copy of my lost ticket . 
 Can you believe that Susan got married ? 
 No . That ’ s what is surprising me . 
 He ’ s a postman . 
 Excuse me . May I take a picture of you and your little boy ? 
 It ’ s for a book . 
 Thank you . I appreciate your help . 
 I suppose my strong point is that I like developing new things and ideas . 
 Yes , I like inventive jobs and I am capable and responsible . 
 No , he isn ’ t . 
 He is afraid of his father-in-law . 
 We've had a few problems . One of the bolts has worked loose and a blade has snapped off . 
 I think the valve is faulty . I couldn't regulate the pressure and the seal burst . I tried opening the emergency valve but it was jammed . 
 Good afternoon . What can I help you with today ? 
 The maturity date isn't for another 10 weeks . Are you aware of that ? 
 The regulations state that the interest is paid at the rate of a Current Deposit , so unfortunately you will lose some interest . 
 ok , so what have you got in store for me tonight ? 
 what ? I don't understand . 
 Oh ! Ha-ha ! That's not what I mean when I said ' go Dutch ' ! 
 ' going Dutch ' means to split the bill , silly ! 
 Can you help me buy my textbooks ? 
 No , I don't have that . 
 I am not sure where the bookstore is . 
 Yes , I knew I could do that . Exactly how do I go about selling them ? 
 I think maybe I could be there . 
 Maybe that would work . 
 Hey , you wanna see a movie tomorrow ? 
 How about Legally Blonde . 
 Isn't that a scary movie ? 
 Ok . I'll give it a try . 
 Ok . See you tomorrow . 
 I'm afraid you are beginning to look a little overweight . You really need to stop smoking . That's the main reason you're unhealthy . 
 Why don't you try smoking one cigarette less each day ? How many do you smoke each day now ? 
 Ok . So for one month , reduce the number you smoke by one a day . At the end of the month , you'll have quit . You should also buy a tracksuit and go jogging every morning . You don't need to jog far . 
 Be careful when you go jogging . Don't put yourself under too much stress . You're still a smoker shouldn't do too much exercises in your condition . 
 Good idea . Remember to eat healthily too . The trainers at the fitness centre will be able to advise you on your diet . 
 Mm ? 
 Of course , Jim . Have I met Tom before ? 
 Oh , yes . I remember Tom . His family comes from Maine , right ? 
 Where is John ? I can't find him anywhere . 
 What ? Beg your pardon . 
 I just cann't believe my ears ! 
 Arden wants to have a trademark for our new series of products registered . But I have no idea on the registering process . 
 Is it so easy ? I never experienced this . Can you tell me something about it ? 
 Based on what you said , does it mean that we can not have a trademark like ' genova ' , right ? 
 Can you tell something about the preparation for the register ? 
 Do you mind retiring earlier ? 
 I do . I don't know what to do after I retire . I'd like to work till I drop . 
 Summers is hot and usually lasts a long time . Winters are short , but cold , wet , and windy . I love the summers in my city , but I hate the wintertime . 
 We usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks , but apart from that , summers are dry . Thunderstorms make the air fresh again , so most people don ’ t mind then . 
 I like spring because flowers bloom and trees grow leaves again . In spring , the weather is very changeable-sometimes cold , sometimes warm . It ’ s usually windy with some rain . Autumn is usually sunny an 
 Do you usually go on a summer holiday ? 
 I usually go on holiday during the spring or the autumn . I try to go somewhere where the weather is more reliable than in my city . 
 No , not really . Why do you ask ? 
 You saw a ghost ? When ? 
 So that's where you saw the ghost ? In your house ? What did it look like ? Was it hideous ? 
 So what did you do ? 
 Until what ? What happened ? Did you see it clearly ? Did it attack you ? 
 Good morning , Madam . This is room service , may I help you ? 
 All right . What kind of room would you like ? 
 It's my pleasure . We have single rooms , double rooms , suites and luxury suites , ect . Well , here is an introduction to our hotel . 
 All right , madam . For which dates do you want to book the rooms ? 
 I see . Now please fill out the form . 
 Just a minute , madam . You should pay a deposit of 500 yuan beforehand . 
 Thank you . Please keep this receipt . 
 Yes , there is a 15 percent discount . 
 You're welcome . I hope all of you will have a good time here . 
 I'm almost finished . 
 I'm done now . Do you like it ? 
 You really like it ? 
 I'm glad you like it . 
 It's going to be $ 55 . 
 Make sure and come back in a couple of weeks . 
 I'm so sorry . Kindly tell me what the problem is , sir . 
 Perhaps you could look again , sir , to double-check . 
 Mr . Sandals , I've worked here five years without seeing one cockroach . 
 You're right , sir . Please let me transfer you to my supervisor 
 You'll never guess what happened today ! I went to the doctor after work and the doctor told me ... 
 No ... He told me I'm pregnant ! 
 And so I bought all these books on having kids and ... 
 How did you know ! They say listening to classical music can make your baby smarter ! 
 I go to the gym every day to keep fit . 
 I've been doing yoga for a long time . 
 Yoga is used to promote people's physical , intellectual and mental harmony and healthy . 
 Oh , I feel really tired and sweat a lot . 
 Sure . But more importantly , I can have peace of mind . 
 Yes , can I help you ? 
 What kind of currency have you got ? 
 One US Dollars in cash is equivalent t0 7.9 Yuan . 
 Minus the fee . Here are your dollars . Please sign here . 
 I'm afraid I have to return this sweater . 
 You see , there is a run at the neck . 
 No , thank you . 
 The choice of destination is very important . It will too energetic for the old people if you make an excursion or go to climb mountains . But they'll be interested in going to the historical places of interest where they can have fun . 
 That's a good idea . That will allow both you and your parents to enjoy yourselves . 
 It's some medicine the doctor recommends . If you leave it at home , you will find it difficult to face up when the old people suffered a seizure . 
 You'd better have all a light schedule . You can rest up for a few days if your parents find tired 。 
 Yes , that's right . Having an enjoyable time together is the goal . 
 Sorry , I don't smoke . 
 May I have the key for Room 358 , please ? 
 Thank you . Is there any mail for me ? 
 Is everything ready for the big family barbecue tomorrow ? 
 We should also cook a couple dozen hot dogs and kebabs . 
 Great ! I asked Grace to bring cups and serviettes as she is also bringing two big coolers for the beers . 
 Welcome , how may I help you today ? 
 Then you will be happy to here that today all our pizzas are on sale . Two for one . 
 What size would you like ? 
 Which kind do you want ? 
 We have two seafood pizzas . Tuna and crab . 
 Would that be for here or take away ? 
 That'll be in a ten minutes . Please sit over there , and I'll call you over as sooner as it's ready . 
 What's the specialty of your restaurant ? 
 I'm afraid I don't like seafood quite well . Would you suggest some others ? 
 OK . I will follow your advice . 
 I think Applied Sociology is a practical subject that can be widely applied to research on soci-ety and man . Hence , I chose it as my major . 
 I am sorry to say I haven't , but I have taken many other courses that concerns the PR , such as Social Psychology , Public Affairs and Mass Communication . 
 Our science field trip is next Monday at 8 a . m . in the morning . Can you mark that on your calendar ? 
 That will be Monday , December 2nd . We need to start loading the buses half an hour early , so plan to arrive at 7 . 
 We will return 6 days later on December 8th . Will someone be picking you up ? 
 The return bus will leave the campground at 5 p . m . and return to campus 3 hours later at 8 p . m . 
 I am going to post all of that information on the geology club web page . Check it out when you get a chance . See you Monday ! 
 Well , it's hard to say . I cough a lot in the evening . 
 You're right , but you know , it's hard to give up an old habit . 
 You know , I often have to work till late at night . I need something to keep me awake . 
 Thank you for your advice ! I'll try it . 
 Hi , Debbie . Have a seat . How's it going ? 
 Pretty good . Listen ... have you heard about the new Thai restaurant over on University Avenue ? 
 That's the one . A bunch of us are going there for dinner tomorrow night.How about coming with us ? 
 Great . I'll call and make reservations . 
 All right . I'll call you tonight and tell you the time . 
 IBA , Maria speaking . How can I help ? 
 I'm here to help . Tell me your questions and I'll do my best to answer them . 
 What repayment period were you thinking of ? 
 A wise decision . If you decide to take out a short-term loan with us , say for 6 months or less , the interest rate shall be for that of a 6 - month loan . 
 Well , we could adjust the interest rate based on the original rate and the amount of days you actually borrowed the money for . 
 It's our pleasure . We are always happy to have another satisfied customer . Thanks for calling . Goodbye . 
 Hello , I am going to the store to buy some fruit . 
 Yes ? 
 Sure . Do you want it to be registered ? 
 Yes , I will be glad to mail your letter . 
 you are welcome . 
 Why do you say that ? 
 Thank God , we haven't encountered a burglar . I hope that our house is secure against burglary . 
 Is the security door useful ? 
 I totally agree with you . In this way I won't be afraid of the burglar if you are away . 
 After you . 
 That's very kind of you . 
 Hi honey ! What ’ s wrong ? Why do you have that look on your face ? 
 No ! I said I was going to cut down which is very different . You can ’ t just expect me to go cold turkey overnight ! 
 I know , I know . I am trying but , I don ’ t have the willpower to just quit . I can ’ t fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch ! Please understand ? 
 May I speak to Mr.Huang , please ? 
 Well , you see , I won't be able to keep my 9 
 Yes , of course . Thank you very much . 
 Hurry up , will you ? 
 Hello ! 
 Yes . 
 Just a minute please . Oh , I'm sorry , all the tickets for tonight have been sold out . 
 Oh , you're lucky , there are just two tickets left . Do you want to take them ? 
 OK , your name and telephone number please . 
 Yes , of course . 
 I don't think I can manage this morning . I wonder if we could after the time of meeting to tomorrow afternoon . 
 All right.Thank you . 
 Hello , I ’ m the landlord . John Taylor . 
 Please , call me John . 
 Sure . Come on it . We just finished rebuilding everything . 
 No , we ’ re going to get that done next week . 
 Thank you . 
 That ’ s right . 
 Yeah . But why don ’ t you come by your office tomorrow to sign the lease ? 
 Thank you . See you tomorrow . 
 I ’ Ve gotta hand it to you , you really did a good job ! 
 I think you deserve a promotion . 
 Do you carrying fresh fish ? 
 I already looked , but did not see anything . 
 Thanks . 
 Oh , gosh . I didn't see it . 
 I ’ m not a Christian . I just want to know why Americans believe that sort of thing . 
 You know ... like , say God is the creator of the universe , the Bible , and Jesus Christ ... 
 What do you believe , John ? Are you Christian ? 
 Do you believe that one religion is better than another ? 
 Do you go to church regularly ? 
 She's a Persian . She has papers and everything . Not like a street dog . 
 And bugs . They can catch anything . 
 No , they use litter boxes or go outside by themselves.Thev ' re so smart . 
 It's better than picking up dog poop . 
 We have lots of options , what type of job do you need ? 
 Do you want to work part-time or full-time ? 
 We have binders with local job listings or you can make use of the computers . OK ? 
 If you make an appointment with a job counselor , they can also provide you with a lot of information . Do you want to see a counselor ? 
 Well , you know that this job center is here for your use , so help yourself . Good luck ! 
 Of course , ma'am , Tell me where to go . 
 All right.There we go . 
 Cancelled ? That's just can't happen ! 
 Oh , I hope it be fixed on Friday . 
 You'll never lose weight if you listen to your stomach . 
 You want to be beautiful , don't you ? Think about the butter and flour in ... 
 Most models only eat once a day . If they can do it , so can we . 
 I think you're hallucinating ! What are you talking about ? 
 And your point is ? 
 I agree with you , but I think people are pretty bad , too . 
 People are always gossiping about one another . 
 We can be so critical of one another . 
 It's Sunday today . 
 I think we should have a house cleaning today . What's your opinion ? 
 Come on . What do you want to do ? Washing clothes or cleaning the house ? 
 Okay . Here is the laundry . 
 Don't worry . I'll help you with it later . 
 Congratulations ! So , have you started planning your move ? 
 Not really . 
 Since I did not have much staff , I asked my cousin to help me out . 
 Yeah , it was . But I still have some information that I collected last time , and if you want , I will give it to you . 
 Excuse me . But are you Mrs . Smith from America ? 
 Yes . Nice to meet you , Mrs Smith . 
 Broadway Mall is having a big sale this weekend . You wanna go ? 
 Well , we can still do some window shopping , can't we ? 
 I'll go myself then . 
 Oh , certainly.When would you like to come ? 
 This weekend would be OK with me . 
 How about coming with me to meet my American friends ? 
 Okay , I'll pick you up at eight o'clock . 
 He is the guy I was telling you about . 
 Hi , Mr.Lin . I am leaving tomorrow and I am just packing . 
 It doesn't matter , Mr.Lin . I can understand . I know you are always very busy . Work must come first . 
 Yes . And I would like to convey my thanks to you for your help during my stay here in Nanjing . 
 Me too . I am looking forward to cooperating with you again . 
 It's Flight No . 104 , Northey Airlines , which leaves at ten O'dock tomorrow evening . 
 That is so thoughtful of you . 
 Thanks a lot . My wife and I will be welcoming and looking forward to your visit . 
 Goodbye . Thanks again . 
 You're going to have to make an appointment . 
 When would you like the installation to be done ? 
 The only time we can come on Friday is at 3 
 I'm sorry , but we're booked up on Friday . 
 Saturday is perfect . What time would you like ? 
 That's perfect . See you on Saturday . 
 I think families everywhere have changed a lot in the last 5 decades . 
 Well , in the past , three or four generations would live together under the same roof . Nowadays , living in the same city as one's relatives is becoming rare . 
 Would you consider having your parents live with you when they get older ? 
 That's very respectable , but I could never live with my parents . I usually only see them at our christmas celebration — and that's enough ! 
 Two of my sisters still live at home , even though they have already graduated from university and have good jobs . They enjoy spending their free time with my parents . I guess in that respect , I'm the black sheep of the family . 
 They're always asking me to come home , but I think our relationship is better if we keep a distance from each other . Whenever we see each other , all we do is fight . 
 Four is an unlucky number here , Peter.Four sounds like death in Chinese.Hotels often have no fourth floor . 
 People don't usually tip here , but you can.Fifty dollars should be more enough . 
 Yes , actually . I don't really know anyone , but it's a nice place . Are you having a good time ? 
 Hello Paul . I'm Jane . So what do you do ? 
 Really ? Me , too . I work for an accountancy company , T & D . Maybe you've heard of them . 
 About two years . And you ? Are you based here ? 
 Since China was open to the outside world , its trade forms have become much more flexible . One of these commonly used forms is co-production . Would you please do a bit explanation of it , Mr . Walker ? 
 I suppose that the assembling of these components and parts , particularly the marketing of the finished products should take place in China . 
 I think the principle of co-production is to expand export trade . It's a reciprocal business , isn't it ? 
 It's a beautiful day ! Let's play on those rides in the park . 
 Me too . I love to play on the swing as well . Swing is my favorite . 
 Look at the flowers over there . What are they ? 
 They are . We can find many different kinds of flowers and insects in the park . 
 If you come to the park in the morning , you can find squirrels running on the lawn . 
 Well , off we go . I am sure we can have a great time . 
 Oh , how splendid ! Can you take a picture of me here ? 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 OK , take a seat please , sir . First of all , can you show me your ID please ? 
 OK , could you please tell me what your backpack looks like ? 
 Mmm ... does it zip closed ? 
 OK , can you tell me the distinguishing features of this backpack ? 
 So what's it , sir ? 
 OK , can you name the items in it ? 
 OK , sir , I'm sure it's your bag . Thank you for your cooperation . You can have it now .

 Hey , Karen . Look like you got some sun this weekend . 
 That ’ s great . Where did you stay ? 
 So , what did you do out there ? I mean besides bask in the sun , obviously . 
 Not to mention cooler . Did you go swimming ? 
 It all sounds so relaxing . I wish I could get away to the beach like that . 
 Hello , welcome to prise star hotel . How may I do for you ? 
 And what name of reservation made under ? 
 Mmm , let me see , it seems there is no Johnson listed for a room for tonight , is there any other name that you reservation list under ? 
 Ah , yes , here it is , you have a standard double room , non smoking on the 3rd floor , I just need to see some identification and the credit card you booked the room with if you don ’ t mind . 
 Come in please . 
 How long will it take ? 
 Well , would you please come back fifteen minutes later ? We are to visit the Tower . 
 Good.Now what kind of job do you want ? Mr.Wilson ? 
 Well , I know Brown's Biscuit Factory are looking for a porter.They pay $ 200 a week . 
 Good.Now here's the address of the factory.The manager's name is ... 
 For you , I would recommend this one here . 
 This automobile is just right for your needs because not only is it compact for ease in city driving , but also , it has many safety features . I know that as a parent , you are concerned about safety in driving your kids to and from school . 
 This model features anti-lock brakes , airbags on both driver and passenger sides , and impact collision design . But that's not all . This car isn't only safe but it's also very economical . 
 Yes , this price is very affordable , but driving this car you'll also notice a significant annual saving in gas consumption . The main attraction for this model is the fuel economy . 
 Why don't you take it for a test drive , and think it over . 
 I'd like to buy some Chinese-style cakes . Could you recommend me some ? 
 Moon cakes ? What is that ? 
 Sounds very interesting . I'll buy some to family people . 
 What's the difference between these two styles ? 
 Get me some of each . 
 Excuse me , can you tell me the name of the book you read ? 
 Harry Potter ? Is that book funny ? 
 Got it . 
 No , but my little brother likes it very much . 
 I'll try to read it . Actually , I like literature very much . 
 Jane Austen . 
 I like it too . But Sense and Sensibility is my favorite . 
 What ? 
 Yes . We need some . How much did you change ? 
 Yes , it's about 35 pesos for every Taiwan dollar , right ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 Why ? 
 Sixty ? That's too much . How can that be ? 
 Just two days ago it was 35 . How can it be 60 ? 
 That's amazing ! Really ? How could it change so much in two days ? 
 I would like to file a complaint . 
 I was robbed . 
 It happened this morning . 
 My wallet and my cell phone . 
 Yes , I was . 
 That would be easy . 
 You have done excellent work . 
 Really ? How did you get the chance ? 
 My warmest congratulations on your entering the Oxford University . 
 Hello , I really appreciate the opportunity to interview for this position . 
 I like to work on group projects that value and need each individual ’ s contributions . 
 I have children so a steady job is important but I would like a chance to advance . 
 I could not relocate in the next year , but might be open to it in the future . 
 A minimum of 75,000 per year . 
 Do you have any hats ? 
 I like both of the two hats . Can you give me a discount if I buy both of them 
 I like this colour and it is very bright . 
 Yes , I think so . How much are they ? 
 What is your temperature now ? 
 How high was your temperature yesterday ? 
 Will you open your mouth ? Your throat is swollen . 
 You seem to have a cold . I'll give your an injection and let me write down your prescription . 
 Hello . I'm not sure who I need to speak to . I got this 50 yuan note today and it seems a little odd to me . 
 What happens now ? 
 Mr . Bryant ? Hi , I'm Mike from Florence Incorporated . I'll glad you made it okay . How was your flight ? 
 That is a long flight . You had a layover too , is that right ? You must be tired . 
 Good ! Here , let me help you with your bag . Is it your first time to Seattle ? I'd be happy to take you around this city and show you the sights tonight if you're up to it . 
 I've already made a hotel reservation for you , let's go to the hotel first and drop off your things . Then , I'd like to have a drink so that we can get better acquainted . I've booked a table at an exclusive restaurant downtown . Afterwards , I've made arrangements to take you to see the city lights . Seattle ’ s nightlife can be really quite exciting . How does that schedule sound to you ? 
 I want to buy a wallet . 
 May I pick it up ? 
 Do you have one of better quality ? 
 There is no problem about the price . How much is it ? 
 OK , I'll take it . 
 Of course , I'd like to . 
 What is in it ? 
 Do you get along with your roommates ? 
 Which floor are you on ? 
 Oh , you can climb the stairs as a workout . 
 Wow , your roommates are cleaning the room . 
 There are so many environment problems in the world today . Do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world ? 
 We need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere . There ’ s lots of clean , modern technology , but companies in developed countries say it ’ s expensive . Developing countries 
 In other parts of the world , especially in Africa , there is a problem with desertification . Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert . In means that people cannot grow e 
 Have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment ? You could get involved with projects to improve the environment . 
 I can't finish this steak . 
 Hi . My minibar is empty . 
 I finished off everything . 
 The Perrier and the Jim Beam . Let me have three more of each . 
 I really loved the apples in my room . Bring me a few more , please . 
 Oh , yes , speaking of fruit , bring me some grape juice , too . 
 Hi , Susan ! 
 Not so well . I've come down with the flu . 
 Thank you . 
 I think so . Blue is still very fashionable at the moment . 
 I think this kind of dress will stay in fashion for a few more years . People don ’ t change fashions every year . It would be too expensive . 
 There are some real fashion victims who just have to keep totally up-to-date with expensive clothes . 
 I know what you mean . The situation will be worse if we marry our boyfriends and have children . The we ’ ll have even less money to spend on fashionable clothes ! 
 What's the special here ? 
 Well , let's try some braised pork , sweet and sour fish and some fried beans . 
 Just some soft drinks and only a bottle of beer . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 Yes , what's the problem ? 
 So you will stay until 9th ? 
 OK , we'll make the correction for you . 
 Hi.Mike . 
 Fine , thanks.And you ? 
 Hello everyone ! I ’ m Rick Fields , and here with me is Bob Copeland . 
 That ’ s right , and it looks like we ’ re just about ready to start the match . The ref is calling the players for the face-off ... and here we go ! The Russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! Federal gets checked hard into the boards ! 
 Alright , the puck is back in play now . Pavel Bure is on a breakaway ! He is flying down the ice ! The defenders can ’ t keep up ! Slap shot ! He scores . 
 Hi , Mary , long time no see . 
 Yes , next March . 
 Would you help me figure out what to do about the office party ? 
 I would like to help you with both . 
 A dressy party would be fun ! 
 We should probably have both . 
 Maybe we could do both ! 
 Good morning . What can I do for you , sir ? 
 Very well . Please sit down here . Do you want me to cut your hair very close ? 
 It's such a hot season , isn't it ? May I suggest thinning out the top ? 
 ( several minutes later ) Now it's done . Is it satisfactory ? 
 Anything else I can do for you , sir ? 
 I don't think the teacher had a right to say that.The teacher was wrong to have accused her in front of the whole class . 
 I agree she had the right to say something , but I feel she should have done it privately . 
 What do you think about studying in the U . S . ? 
 Do you have any advice ? 
 Anything else ? 
 I will think over your advice . 
 I really appreciate your help . 
 How about next Friday ? 
 How do you feel about hiring that clown to come and entertain the kids ? 
 That's what I was thinking . 
 Do you feel like a king in your castle ? 
 We got numbers back from our offices in Beijing , Hong Kong , Taipei , Singapore and Tokyo , we're waiting on Bangkok and Kula Lumpur . 
 It's hard to say , because the branches are located in diversity different countries , cultural and social influences will definitely play a part in the success of the product in the various markets . 
 For instance , some products that do very well in Tokyo branch are a flop in Malaysia.We ' re talking about different people with different lifestyles and different needs . Each of the branches takes these types of things into consideration when they compile their reports and their marketing plans . 
 How's this one ? 
 What about this one ? 
 Good evening , Mr . Lee and thank you for choosing our airline . We have just discovered that this flight is overbooked . Would you like to volunteer to give up your seat ? 
 From time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft . That ’ s overbooked . 
 Actually it ’ s a common practice to overbook , as passengers often don ’ t take their flight as scheduled . Most of the time there is no problem but today , more passengers arrived than we have seats , 
 Well , first we ask for volunteers . If someone like yourself volunteers , they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year . If no one volunteers we just have to select someone . 
 Employees in this company have to have a good command of English . Do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken English ? 
 Well , then , please tell me about your English education . 
 I see , do you speak any other languages ? 
 I can't decide whether to go to university or to get a job . 
 But I don't even know what to study . 
 That's what my parents want me to do . 
 But if you go to university , you'll still have time for fun . 
 And if you try to find a part-time job , you'll have some money too . 
 is that your rabbit ? 
 that's good of you . why did you decide to get a rabbit . 
 rabbits aren't usually that affectionate , are they ? 
 i didn't know that . Are rabbits difficult to take care of ? 
 that sounds pretty easy . Do rabbits make your house smell ? 
 can you train a rabbit to do things ? 
 that's amazing ! Has she bitten you yet ? 
 I ’ m sure you never dare to go against your wife . 
 Have you ever got the goods on her for wrong doings ? 
 Well , it ’ s nice to have a husband like you . 
 And good shot ! 
 What can I do for you today ? 
 Do you have your library card ? 
 There is a wait for the computers . 
 You need to print your name on this list . 
 Once a computer is available , I will let you know . 
 All you do is type in the number on the back of your card . 
 Good morning . More Hotel . At your service . 
 All right . Single-room or double-room ? 
 Hold on , please . Let me check the bookings . Yes , we have double-rooms available . What kind of room would you like , sir ? 
 We have a nice garden-view room . 
 Yes , sir . And there is also a party going on each Saturday night in the bar till next morning . 
 888 Yuan per night . With breakfast . “ Northern Star ” buffet ! What's there arriving time ? 
 I see . May I have your name and phone number ? 
 Good evening . Welcome to Mansion Hotel . 
 Last name , Rodgers ? 
 Very well . Welcome , Mr . Rodgers . Would you please fill out the registration card ? How are you doing today ? 
 Mr . Rodgers , how would you handle your account ? 
 I will check to see if there any messages for you ? Well , here is one message for you . 
 Certainly , I can take care of that for you . What time would you like the wake-up call ? 
 Mr . Rodgers , this is George . He will take care of your luggage and show you to your room . If there is anything I can do for you , please let me know . 
 Have a pleasant stay . 
 When are you planning to go ? 
 What time would you like to leave ? 
 We have a flight at four thirty . 
 The next flight is at five fifteen and there's another at six thirty . 
 Yes , we have a seat available on that flight on the thirteenth . 
 The flight only takes an hour and a half . It arrives at eight o'clock . 
 Yes , I would like to buy a Walkman . Can you tell me about the models you have ? 
 Mostly cassette tapes . 
 Kreng ? I've never heard of that company . 
 I suppose I don't want that one then . I don't like auto-reverse . It breaks too easily . 
 Yes , twice now . I think it's too high-tech , and so it's the first part that breaks . 
 Well . No , I didn't clean it.But still , I only had the last one two months , and it broke . I don't trust auto-reverse . 
 How much is it ? 
 Can I test it out ? 
 It sounds great . I'll take it . 
 Thanks . 
 Okay . What time is the meeting tomorrow ? 
 So , tell me , what makes you think we should give you a raise ? 
 Salaries are confidential , how do you know how much money these " other people " make ? 
 Those are company cars provided to the sales staff for their business trips . Also , some employees receive sales commissions . So good salesmen will naturally earn more . 
 I see your point . However , it might be hard to get a raise approved . Profits were down last quarter , and the whole company is tightening its belt , so anything that affects the annual budget 
 Ticket , please.Do you have a seat preference ? 
 Sure . Please put your baggage on scale . 
 20kg.Yours is not overweight . Here is your boarding pass and baggage tag.Please go to the satellite hall to wait for boarding . 
 are you ready for your first driving lesson ? 
 the pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas . 
 automatics are very simple to drive . The first thing you should do is put your seat belt on . 
 very funny . Next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . Can you see out of them ? 
 how ’ s that ? 
 check your petrol situation . 
 that ’ s a good idea . Put your keys in the ignition , start it up , put the car in reserve , wait for the road to be clear , and then back out of the driveway . 
 remember , no honking this time . The horn is only for emergencies ! 
 Hey man , what do you have on tap ? 
 Cool , give me a pint of Heineken and half a pint of Bud . 
 Sure ! Let ’ s have some nachos and mozzarella sticks . 
 Wait ... What ! 
 You should go to the library to find some information about American universities , and write to the Admission Office . Then the Admission Office will send you application forms and other related materials . From experience , many applicants write to several universities instead of just one . 
 That is true . I ’ ll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities . First of all , you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work , three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence , and the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It ’ s usually 550 ) . Then you need a financial guarantee , and an application fee of 25 dollars . 
 If they agree to enroll you , they will send you a TAP - 66 Form . With TAP - 66 , you can apply for a passport from our government , and then apply for a visa from the US . Embassy in Beijing . 
 From 3 to 6 months if everything goes well . 
 You are welcome . Please feel free to ask if you have any more questions . 
 Oh hello , Sally . This is Dave Thomson here . Could I speak to Jim please ? 
 Any idea when he might be back ? 
 OK . well , tell him I've called , will you , and I'll try again later . 
 Thanks then Sally . Goodbye . 
 It was chosen as the most popular magazine of the year . 
 As far as the language is concerned , it's worth reading . 
 No , and I have no way of getting ahold of him ! There's no phone where he's at ! 
 My older sister Judy will be here soon to help . She already has a boy and a girl of her own ... 
 Happy birthday , Lillian . Here's a little present I bought for you . 
 Do you want a shampoo ? 
 What brand do you prefer ? 
 All right , miss.This one is very hot . I'll come to turn it off in fifteen minutes.Will that be alright ? 
 Do you know what exporters consider ? 
 Could you talk about it in detail ? 
 I understand . Thank you . 
 Hi Jack , I'm working on these documents . The manager wants them for half an hour . 
 Is there something any need ? 
 Yes , I have nothing to do . 
 I beg your pardon ? 
 Really ? well , ok , you're welcome . 
 Hmm , how about seven ? I can treat you to dinner . 
 OK . Then I'll be expecting you . 
 I'm sorry , sir . I'm going to have to ask you to leave . 
 Well , she apparently doesn't think it's so friendly . Let's go . 
 You'd better cooperate with me , sir , or ... 
 Did you have a good holiday ? 
 Wow ! Look at the time . lt's about 11 0 ' clock . 
 I've got to catch the last bus . See you later . 
 Yes . The porter will go and help you . 
 OK , sir . 
 Yes , they were . But it has already past . The traffic from the airport to downtown has been relieved after the completion of Yan'an Aerial Road . 
 That's wonderful . OK . I'll remember that . But I have to warn you that you must drive very carefully in the downtown area , for there're no separate lanes for motor vehicles and bicycles in some places , and still quite a few people don't take road regulations seriously . 
 Not much . Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight . 
 Well , I ddin't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found him extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! We have so much in common . We like the same teams , music , and most amazingly , we both love Chinese food ! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends . 
 There's nothing definite I think . I don't have a list or anything , but when I first meet somebody , I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . It seems I have a radar helping me spot new friends . 
 I agree . You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need . 
 I really enjoyed tonight's party . Thank you , Sarah . 
 Nice meeting you , too . 
 Beg your pardon ? 
 Oh , Let me see ... It's three forty-five . Er ... wait , My watch is five minutes fast . So it should be three forty 
 Today is Friday . Are you new in Beijing ? 
 Welcome to Beijing . This is my business card . I'm an engineer . If you need any help in Beijing , just give me a call . 
 Go ahead . 
 It's October the 1st , our National Day . I'd like to talk some more , but I've got to get going now . It was nice talking to you , though . 
 As you know I ’ Ve been thinking about moving my career in a new direction . I am hoping that you will be able to provide me with a reference to help me jump-start my future . 
 Thank you . I ’ Ve really enjoyed my time here . I've grown both personally and professionally with this company . 
 It will be hard to say good-bye . This office has become like a second home to me . 
 I'm sorry , I'm having a little trouble understanding your accent . 
 Every teacher likes him . 
 How he manages to do that is always a mystery to me . 
 Why are you all dressed up ? 
 Tomorrow is Sunday . Let's go out and get some fresh air . 
 why not ? I love animals and I love nature . 
 sounds very interesting . I can't wait to go there . 
 That is true . Some people go camping , some people pick fresh fruit , some people go boating and some people go grass skiing . 
 Well , now you know . Let's go to the lake over there . Some people are fishing over there . I haven't had a chance to fish in a lake , I really want to try . 
 Yes . we can get what we need at the stands right by the lake . Who do you think will catch a big fish first ? 
 Wait and see . I want to try horseback riding after fishing . It looks very exciting and fun . 
 No problem . It is always worth trying something new once in your life time . 
 Hold on please ... Yes , you are booked already . 
 I am sorry.Flight LJ88 0n that day is full . What about 22 ? 
 How are you , Kim ? I haven ’ t seen you around for a few days . 
 I ’ m sorry to hear about that . Why don ’ t you join me for a hot cup of tea ? It ’ ll be good for you ! 
 It ’ s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . The air is so fresh and clean . 
 I can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . The problem is that , for me , each advantage has its own disadvantage . 
 Well , I hate the noise in the city , but I love being around lost of people . The problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . The tow just don ’ t go together . 
 People can ’ t have it both ways . If you live in the country , it is often less convenient . If you live in a city , it is noisy , buy there ’ s more to do . 
 I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . When the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes . 
 Just remember that in that village there ’ s nothing to do . There ’ s not even a pub or restaurant . There ’ s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods . 
 Loans Department , how can I help you ? 
 Certainly , Sir . I'd be happy to . The Personal Pledge Loan is a loan secured by undue certificates , Time Deposits , for example , or Visible Treasury Bonds . 
 That's correct , Sir . The bank will issue receipt to you and also take care of all the pledged securities . 
 The maximum maturity period is a year , but it also cannot exceed the maturity on the certificates used as collateral . 
 The initial amount is just 2,000 RIB , but we can go up to 100,000 RIB . But remember , it cannot exceed the amount on the certificates you are using as collateral . 
 My pleasure , Sir . Bye . 
 Donations for what ? 
 How much money are you trying to raise ? 
 What are you doing to raise money ? 
 You should try other fundraisers . 
 You can always wash cars and sell candy . 
 That ’ ll help you make more money . 
 Well , Mr.Li has very good taste in wine , and Galp is one of the biggest clients . I suggest you take them to a decent French restaurant . Make sure you make a very good impression . 
 Or Lapis . They are both listed this year glory magazine for have most of frantic Fetch cuisine in town . But I heard Lapis has a better wine selection . 
 Sure . 
 Oh , great ! 
 I like No . 4 . 
 Yes . In fact , I think it's much better than this week's No . 1 . 
 I like it as well , but I don't think it's as good as Sweet Heart . 
 Well . I don't like Your Lips very much . 
 I think it's too slow makes me sleepy . In fact , it's the worst in this week ’ s top ten , if you ask me . 
 Hello , welcome to the International Business Counter , Sir . What can we do for you today ? 
 Of course . Is there a problem with them ? 
 You will need to return the documents . That's no problem ; we can deal with that for you now . 
 Did you watch the final last night ? My favorite singer won ! 
 Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions . 
 Me too . 
 Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ? 
 He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him . 
 Hi . Can I help you with anything ? 
 Sure . Let me get it out for you . What is your size ? 
 Here you go . 
 Actually , we have a few to choose from . They are over here . 
 Oh . I'm sorry . I'll check the price for you . It is $ 199 . 
 Yes . Why don't you try this one on . 
 Sure . Here you go . 
 Sure . Take your time . 
 No problem at all . 
 Mr Edwards , this is Kristy calling from IBA . 
 Do you remember coming in to do the L / C amendment last week ? 
 The negotiating bank has just been in touch ... 
 No , Mr Edwards , not at all . We are contacting you to let you know that everything has gone smoothly and the amendment has been accepted . 
 Miss , where do you want to go ? 
 No problem . 
 Yes , you are changed 50 cents a piece . 
 Hello baseball fans , and welcome back to today ’ s game ! My name is Rick Fields and of course , I am here , once again , with the man that seals the deal , Bob Copeland . 
 Well , the national anthem has just been sung , and the umpire has started the game . It ’ s time to play ball ! 
 A very nice curve ball by the pitcher . The catcher gives him the sign , he winds up and Vargas gets a line drive ! 
 Great play ! 
 Home run by Okapi ! That puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at Richie Stadium ! 
 Morning . What would you like for breakfast ? 
 Come on . We are going to be late . 
 Milk ? 
 Hi . 
 Yeah ? 
 Yeah ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry . 
 I'm so sorry , I .. I didn't realize it was that loud . 
 It's true.It was a bit loud . 
 Oh , it's no problem.It ' s OK.You know , it only happened once . 
 It's getting late . 
 Hi , Mr . Smith . Are you enjoying the cookout ? You don't look too happy . 
 Is that what people usually do on Memorial Day ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . Thank you for telling me a little more about it . 
 Well , things are all right . 
 Yeah , Bob moved in last week . He is a nice guy and so far everything is cool except this girlfriend . 
 She came over last weekend . She is a nice girl but there's something about her voice that really creeps me out . I tried to smile and be polite , but the whole time all I could think was " what's wrong with your voice ? " 
 I doubt it . Last time was an oral train wreck . Listening to her talk is like chewing tin foil . 
 No , it's so much worse . And tonight they invited me out to dinner . I really have no idea how I'm going to pull it off . 
 That's the plan . 
 Cindy , I have this room to myself ? 
 It's twice as big as my room in Taiwan ! 
 I think I'm going to like it here . 
 Wow , I have my own bathroom ! 
 We share the same bathroom , in other words . 
 Wow . It's just the two of us . I don't know if we need that much room . 
 I guess you're right . And we'd like to have company anyway . 
 Now that's a plus ! 
 Yes.Which kind of salad dressing would you prefer ? 
 I'll do that then . 
 Yes . I like it very much . 
 It's excellent . 
 It's delicious . 
 I like beefsteak very much . Have you tried Chinese dishes ? 
 Well , it's getting late . I have to get up early tomorrow . So I must say good night . 
 Hello , and welcome to IBA . Which service do you require ? 
 That's no problem ; I can take care of that for you . 
 If it's this kind of consultancy service , I'll have to direct you to another department , I'm afraid . 
 There are many services you can choose from . Why don't you take a look at this leaflet while I find someone who can help you ? 
 How long have you been in Taiwan ? 
 So , where did you grow up ? 
 I am not sure , where exactly is it ? 
 No , I was born in Gaoxiong , I only moved to Taipei after I graduated . 
 Me too . Is there a place nearby that we can get something to eat ? 
 Kentucky's ? Is that a chain restaurant ? 
 I've heard about it , but never had one . 
 OK . Let's go . 
 So what about the tennis racket ? 
 How much did that end up costing you ? 
 Hey , two for one . That's a super deal . 
 I've been at this for two weeks now and nothing ’ s turned up . 
 What do you mean ? 
 You ’ re right , I don ’ t want to pay , but I don ’ t want to live without pay , either . 
 Do you have anyone in mind ? 
 Who ? 
 Ya , they do . Anyone else come to mind ? 
 I was thinking about applying for the new position . 
 It seems like a good idea but I am not really sure . 
 Well , it would give me a chance to grow , but I am wondering if I would like the job . 
 I am also thinking about the pay . 
 Yes , it might be worth it . I am not certain . 
 No . 164 in lane 3 achieved 11 ' 16 in the 100 meter dash . Isn't that something ? 
 He won the first place ! 
 Hello , Sir . So , you are back ? 
 That's pretty easy to explain . With the Deposit , the interest is fixed , but the Dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . The longer the term , the higher the Dividend you earn . This is because it is calculated at the Compound Interest Rate . 
 Yes . And if you already have a Current Account with us , the Insurance Premium can be paid through it , which saves all of us a lot of hassle . 
 What do you mean , Janice ? 
 I ’ m sorry , Janice . But we ’ Ve been waiting on the client . It ’ s out of our hands at the moment . 
 You peel the onions and wash them , then chop them . 
 Let me see . Wash the cabbage over there . 
 What is your father doing now ? 
 How about Daniel ? 
 Be careful of the peeler . Don't cut your fingers . 
 OK , we've finished . Can you get your father and brother ? 
 I've never seen a machine like this before and need some help . 
 I want to buy a drink . 
 I've got the correct change already . 
 OK , what next ? 
 OK , next ? 
 I agree with you . 
 Good evening , do you have a reservation ? 
 Let me see . Ok , this way , please . 
 And would you like to order now ? 
 Here is the menu . 
 Hi , Sir . What can I do for you ? 
 Right . If the cheque is coming from the US , into a local currency account it will take 7 working days to clear . 
 There is , actually . If you can get your company to apply for a cheque from a bank in Shanghai , that'll speed things up no end . 
 I am very pleased to meet you . 
 That sounds an interesting job , Bob . 
 Yes , I am Professor Clark . 
 Yes , how are you doing ? 
 That sounds painful . Are you going to be OK ? 
 How many days will you be out of school ? 
 I am glad you let me know that you will be missing class . Get well ! 
 Which dish do you like most ? 
 Actually , it's the dish recommended by this restaurant specially . 
 Sorry , I can ’ t . I ’ m busy . 
 I always do volunteer work on the first Saturday of every month . 
 I help out at the children ’ s hospital . I help plan activities . 
 Yeah . It ’ s exciting . This month we ’ re doing crossword puzzles . 
 How much is the fare , please ? 
 Wait . I want to ask you if this bus goes down Fifth Avenue as far as Greenwich Village . 
 I thought this bus Went down Park Avenue . 
 But I thought this was the right bus to go to Washington Square Park .

 Why don ’ t you find the information on the internet instead ? 
 Do you have an online edition of that magazine ? 
 Do you have a subscription ?

 Come on , just a little piece . 
 I have no idea . 
 That's amazing . 
 Come on , you are making too big deal out of this . 
 OK , dear sister , I see . This kind of thing will not happen again . 
 there ’ s branch on new street . Walk up this street until you get to the first set of traffic lights . Then turn right at the traffic lights . 
 not far . About 150 meters perhaps . 
 then keep walking until you reach the war memorial . It ’ s a big statue of a soldier . You can ’ t miss it . 
 you ’ ll see the national bank near the war memorial . It ’ s a big building and you ’ ll see a big sign on the front of the building . 
 Can you tell me about a nice restaurant to go to ? 
 My date is quite sophisticated . She would expect nothing less than the best . 
 That's a good idea , except I want to go out , not stay in . Something else , maybe ? 
 That sounds good ! Could you call them to see if I can get a reservation ?

 Look at this headline , Soo Mi . 
 Is it the same in Korea ? 
 Do people get married young ? 
 Hmm . Do women usually work after they get married ? 
 I want to improve my handwriting , and I've practiced it for several weeks , but nothing happened . You see , my handwriting is still bad . 
 I know it , but I don't know when I can make it better . 
 Yeah , you are right . I must stop complaining and stick to it every day . 
 I have tickets to The Phantom of the Opera on Friday night . Would you like to go ? 
 It's at 8: 00 .

 Sounds fun.Anyone I know ? 
 Sounds like I'm missing out on a good time.Oh , well , there's always next year . 
 Just whose fault is this damage ? 
 It certainly didn't arrive here that way . 
 How about taking the damaged portion at a lower price ? 
 I was thinking of 30 % off . 
 May I help you ? 
 Oh , that's a really good buy ... Here . There's only one left . 
 Sure , if you show me your passport . 
 No , it isn't . That's why it's such a bargain .

 Oh , but I can't . It wasn't my fault . 
 Wow ! You look like a drowned rat ! Didn't you know there is a thunder-storm today ? 
 Well . You'd better take a hot shower right now , or you will catch a cold . 
 I ’ m sick of my job , I always have to work late at night , and the company keeps me working in the office . 
 What do you suggest ? I can ’ t afford to quit my job until I get a new one . 
 I'm sorry I scratched your car . 
 What happened , John ? 
 Why do you look unhappy ?

 Then how about a salesman ? 
 Well , how was the interview ? 
 What did the woman ask you ? 
 Did she ask you any questions about your family ? 
 Did she tell you whether you would get the job ? 
 Welcome back movie lovers to another Premier Movie Review . My name is Richard Clarke and I am joined today by the very erudite DavidWatson . 
 Well , I think this film is simply a fable , depicting man ’ s eternal greed for power , and in my opinion , it ’ s a very fine film . Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries.The musical score was amazing , the animation was very well done , and the story was simply enchanting . 
 Predictable ! How ! Come on Dick , It ’ s a G-rated movie ! It ’ s for the kids ! It ’ s not a thriller ! 
 How can it be cliche ? It ’ s a fable ! It ’ s telling a time-honoured story ! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption , and teaches children the value of respect , life and love . 
 Open your heart Dick . Don ’ t shut us out . 
 He loves that blonde girl . 
 Did she accept it ? 
 Hi , happy new year ! 
 Time flies ! One year has already been a history ! 
 Yeah . Have you made any good resolutions for this new year ? 
 I want to be healthier this year , so I think I should take more exercise . 
 Maybe I should make a plan about learning my biochemistry , which is a mess ! 
 How are you ? 
 What can I help you with ? 
 Cash or check ? 
 How much do you want to deposit ? 
 What account will you be depositing this money into ? 
 What else can I do for you today ? 
 Do you do a lot of your shopping online ? 
 No . I ’ m a little worried about security . You never know who ’ s trying to find out your codes and passwords . Aren ’ t you worry about that ? 
 I ’ m surprised to hear you say that . I thought you loved anything technological . 
 So , how about coming to the department store with me ? I want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet . 
 Sure . While you ’ re in the computer store . I will visit the book store opposite . I like to browse through their books and see if they have anything interesting . 
 Thanks for reminding me . I had forgotten to get mine . 
 Okay . Is your hair naturally curly or is it a perm ? 
 That's my specialty . Let me put this around your neck . 
 With the cut I'll give you , we will minimize a lot of that . 
 And when we're done , I'll show you some great stuff to take care of the rest . 
 Well , for a monthly pass , it'll cost you $ 65 .

 No , dad . Can I go there to play ball ? 
 I would like to talk to you , if you have time . 
 I want to discuss some things about my lease . 
 Can you tell me when my lease is up ? 
 If I ever decide to leave before the three years , will there be a problem ? 
 Why is that ? 
 Oh , I see . 
 An interesting meeting , isn't it ? 
 Let me introduce myself , by the way , my name is Dick Brown . 
 Sorry , what was your last name again ? 
 OK . I'm Dick . 
 It was very kind of you to give me a tour of the place . It gave me a good idea of your product range . 
 Very impressive , indeed , especially the speed of your NW Model . 
 The machine gives you an edge over your competitors , I guess . 
 Could you give me some brochures for that machine ? And the price if possible . 
 Thank you . I think we may be able to work together in the future . 
 Yes , sir . I think you'll find our gym quite satisfactory . 
 It's only one flight down , sir . Just take the elevator or the stairs . 
 Sir , you can use the gym for free . All you need is your room key . 
 Sir , our gym is open around the clock , every day of the week . 
 I'm sorry , sir , but we have no trainer . 
 I wouldn't do it if I were you . 
 It's very dangerous , you know . 
 It's an easy way to get hurt , let me tell you . 
 Well , take care of yourself , and don't say I didn't warn you . 
 Yes . It's very convenient and the price is even lower .

 No . Please don ’ t . I couldn ’ t let you do that . 
 Yes , I know it is one of the leading industries in the petrochemical field . 
 Yes , I hope I will be a manager in 5 years . 
 Do you really ? 
 Well , I just think he deserves it . 
 That's great . You need to prepare for it . 
 Buy an expensive suit . 
 Yeah , fine . And dressing leather shoes . 
 Morning Sally ! What's up ? you seem many hurry ! 
 Don't worry , I'll drive you . 
 How are your cases coming along ? 
 Wow , Good for you . It sounds like a lot of work . I'm proud of you ! Is this the red of building ? 
 You're welcome . Good luck , bye ! 
 What is this eviction notice for ? 
 Are you kidding me ? 
 You can ’ t just throw me out on the street ! 
 Will you still throw me out if I make the rent payment ? 
 I am going to take care of the rent payment right now . 
 Happy anniversary , sweetheart ! 
 I'll drink to that . Thanks for making this a night worth remembering . 
 That's good to know . Oh , listen ! The band's playing our song . 
 Always . 
 Yes , I need some more cash for my visit in China . May I cash a traveler ’ s check here ? 
 I was going to cash it at the hotel , but one of my friends said that banks always give better exchange rates . 
 You mean there is really not that much of a difference . 
 Well , may I cash these three checks for 100 dollars each ? I think that will be enough . 
 Ok . 
 I have not given it much thought . Do you have any good suggestions ? 
 I have been there . It is in the middle of the mountains . It is not noisy there and you have to be a vegetarian . 
 Does it have enough lodging ? 
 There are many ancient pine trees there . It is especially quiet at night . It is wonderful to listen to the monks chanting while listening to the soothing sound of the winds in the pine trees . 
 Take some thick clothes with you . It is rather cold there at night . If you wear the T-shirt you're wearing now , you will become a ' popsicle ' . 
 If you like taking pictures , you may bring a camera with you . 
 What day is it today ? 
 I need to make a copy of a document as soon as possible . 
 Very good . How much does each copy cost ? 
 A dime ? I remember when copies used to cost a nickel . 
 Nick , it's very nice of you to see me off . 
 Very well . If I leave I'll miss you . 
 I'm sure and I remembered your phone number . I'll call you . 
 It's time I left . 
 I am sure we will make it up as soon as possible . 
 We hope this matter will not affect our good relations in our future dealings . 
 Excuse me , do you go to the Central Park ? 
 Could you please tell me when I get to the Central Park ? 
 ( A few minutes later . ) Should I get off at the next stop ? 
 Is it a long ride ? 
 OK . I know . Thank you . 
 May I see your airplane ticket , passport and health certificate please ? 
 Will you please put your luggage on the scale ? 
 Sir , your bags are 30 pounds over weight.You are allowed only 45 pounds of baggage . 
 That comes to H . K . $ 120 . 
 Thanks for reminding me . It always slips my mind . 
 Cool ! That's a great idea . What did you have in mind ? 
 Don't tell me , socks . 
 You ready ? 
 Are you ready to transfer to a new school tomorrow ? 
 You ’ re not nervous , are you ? 
 Why are you nervous ? 
 That ’ s not a problem . 
 It ’ s fun meeting new people . 
 Hi . I'm looking for a gift for my niece . 
 That's perfect . I want to see one . 
 Oh , I like Digital Barbie ! How much does she cost ? 
 That's perfect . Let me have her . 
 No , that'll do it for now . 
 Let me give you cash , please . 
 You're from New York , aren't you ? 
 What do you suggest I should see in New York ? 
 No , I don't like museums.They ' re boring . 
 Ah ! That sounds interesting . 
 Yes , I do . I am the oldest child . I have a sister and a brother . My sister is in college and my brother in high school . 
 We get alone very well . 
 Yes , it is . Please put your luggage on this scale . 
 Yes , it is . How many pieces of hand luggage do you have ? 
 Robert , this is my friend , Mrs . Smith . 
 Nice to meet you too . 
 I'm a doctor . 
 New York University hospital in New York City . What do you do ? 
 What do you teach ? 
 Where ? 
 That's nice . How old are you ? 
 Hi , Robert . What happened to your face ? It looks swollen . 
 Did it hurt ? 
 How long were you in the chair ? 
 Well , I guess you've learned a good lesson , huh . You have to take good care of your teeth . 
 Don't you have a dental insurance ? 
 Oh , my God ! What's this ? 
 Look ! This window is open . 
 Are you kidding ? It's winter . Why would I open it ? 
 No ! Oh , my God ! Someone has broken into the house . 
 I locked it when I left though . 
 I don't care about that , Allen ! What did he steal ? That's the question ! 
 The TV's still here . 
 But what if someone's still up there ? 
 Sorry to have smoked in your room . 
 It ’ s very kind of you . 
 I know . I ’ ll try to give it up . 
 Yes , it is . Are you here on business ? 
 I ’ m going there for a tour , too . Is this your first trip to China ? 
 Why don ’ t we go together ? I can show you around . I think you ’ ll have a better time . 
 Great , let ’ s go ! 
 Yes , he's holding a bunch of books . 
 Hello , let me introduce myself . I'm your new neighbor . My name is Andy . 
 Nice meeting you , too . 
 Thanks for the invitation . I will ! 
 Speaking . What's up ? 
 My bad , I had chores to do . 
 What was the reason for your call ? 
 Sounds good . What did you have in mind ? 
 Okay , let's go see a movie . 
 Talk to you later . 
 Actually , I did have a question . We'd like to know what you had in mind for the budget on this project . We are hoping to put together a really competitive bid . But at the same time , we'd like to hit your target price , too . 
 Do you have any price range ? Is there any way you can give me any idea of what direction to go or how high is too high ? 
 The concert was really great . 
 The singing group used to be very popular . 
 Excuse me , I bought this sweater yesterday . But when I got home and tried it on , I found it ’ s too small . 
 Yes , here you are . 
 No , can I exchange it for a bigger one ? 
 Oh , that's too bad . 
 Can I pay my bill here ? 
 How much is the charge ? 
 Do you receive checks ? 
 Here is my card . 
 Don't mention it . 
 Good night ! 
 I'd like to open a new account . 
 yes . And I've brought some documents along with me , too . Do you need to see my passport ? 
 yes . Does the checking account come with a debit card ? 
 that's very convenient . 
 yes . What's the maximum amount that you are allowed to have in an overdraft ? 
 is there a penalty for having an overdraft ? 
 that's true . Is everything alright with my documents ? 
 thank you very much . 
 How time flies ! 
 I can still remember our first date . 
 Yeah , oh my god ! It's still there . We have our first date right on there . 
 You were dull at that time . 
 I can't believe this for it's been 20 years since we got married . 
 I know . It really makes a mess of the whole election process . 
 The problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up . 
 Have you ever listened to AM radio ? It's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on TV and FM radio . 
 Another place you can get real insight is European papers . You can get them on-line . 
 Oh , yes . I really like it here . 
 Sure . I'd love to . 
 Yes . I've already been to several clubs here . 
 Uh , actually , I've gone twice this week . 
 Well , I haven't been to the theater in a long time . 
 Great ! Let's make a reservation . 
 Certainly ! The first thing is to be honest about how much time for you can devote to your pet . Dogs are very demanding . You need to take them for walks and they love to play . Cats , on the other hand , are more independent . 
 Unusual pet are often more expensive to keep . Is that a problem ? 
 We have those , but I only sell them to people I know well , for obvious reasons . How about a lizard ? I have some that are very brightly coloured , are not aggressive , and are easy to feed and look after . 
 Sure . Come over here . As you can see , I have a wide selection of species . They can live together , if you want lizards of different kinds . Do you have a favourite colour ? 
 You can feed them on various things . They will eat small pieces of meat , but I ’ d recommend insects . You can get them from your garden , but remember that lizards eat a lot insects . I sell them here . 
 That ’ s fine . You shouldn ’ t make a hasty decision when choosing a pet . 
 That's all right.Show me the blue pen , please . 
 I see.Thank you . 
 Yeah . I get sick of her . She always bends my ear about what she thinks . 
 But I don ’ t like anyone who would drive me crazy by telling me what to do . 
 OK . Do you want a trim , or do you want to get your hair done ? 
 Like that Rastafarian over there ? You mean dreadlocks ? You crazy ! That'll take way too long . 
 I'm gonna get a relaxer , then flip the ends up like Halle . 
 Can you take part in our picnic this Saturday ? 
 We plan to go to a forest in the suburb . There is a beautiful river there . We can do some fishing . 
 And don't forget your fishing tackle . 
 Hello , Rebecca , fancy meeting you here ! 
 How have you been ? 
 Pretty good . What brings you here ? 
 Have you eaten ? 
 it's getting cold . 
 Oh , it's made of wool . I like the striped pattern . 
 it looks great , but you need something to go with it . It's too plain on its own . 
 that's a good idea . When did you buy it ? Is it a name brand ? 
 that looks lovely . Just one more thing---you need a pair of earrings . 
 perfect ! 
 thanks . We should be ourselves . There are so many fashion victims out there . 
 I've been looking for a swimming pool , but I haven't found one yet . 
 Swim stations ? Could you be a little more explicit ? 
 Gee , that's a great idea . Now , how much do I have to pay ? 
 Great ! Now , when can I go down there and use the stations ? 
 Boy , oh boy ! I can't wait to change into my swim trunks . 
 Too ... your face is really oily ... perfect ! 
 Nope . I'm going to tell your fortune . So ... the oilier , the better . 
 It's facial paper , and it fits into the rings of my binder ! It's magical . 
 Good morning , doctor . I've been suffering very much from a toothache lately . 
 I think one of the back ones at the top is giving me the most trouble . 
 Oh , I hate having teeth pulled out . Will it hurt ? 
 Will it take long ? 
 Is it out ? 
 Well , really ! That was wonderful ! I felt no pain at all . Thank you , doctor . 
 Hi , I ’ m Paul . Could you show me the apartment on the first floor ? 
 I like this one . How much is the rent ? 
 Does the rent include utilities ? 
 Where ’ s the laundry room ? 
 What ’ s your rule about pets ? 
 How come ? 
 who takes care of bug control ? 
 Thank you very much for taking your time . I ’ m still deciding . I will call you tomorrow . 
 Yes , of course . I'll take it . 
 I like it . 
 Why ? I think it ’ s convenient and good . 
 Why should we run after the fashion ? 
 You know that this job requires frequent business travel . Can you accept it ? 
 Mostly short business trips , but sometimes long ones are also needed . 
 The company will pay all the expenses . 
 Usually Shanghai , Qingdao , Hong Kong and so on . 
 And you need to go abroad once in a while . Can you ? 
 After the business trip , you could apply for reimbursement of all the expenses , such as passage money and accommodation charges and so on . 
 You can take a break for one or two weeks after you have a business trip every time , which depends on the circumstances . 
 Can we have two tickets for seven thirty ? 
 In the front , please . 
 Thank you . And what's on tomorrow ? 
 Can we get tickets now ? 
 If you like you can try it on.The fitting room is in the corner . 
 I think it fits you . It flatters your figure . 
 That's all you need to know about the interview for the job as a fireman . Any other questions ? 
 You can contact me any time you need me . Bye ! 
 Helen , you must be excited at going to America to study . 
 What do your classmates think of it ? 
 How long will you study there . 
 Which university will you go to ? 
 Good luck ! 
 Excuse me , sir , your steamed crabs is coming . 
 Mix a little soya sauce , vinegar and sliced ginger on this plate and dip the meat in it before eating . 
 Are you going to vote on Tuesday ? 
 I ’ Ve already voted . 
 I sent in an absentee ballot . 
 I won ’ t be able to vote on Tuesday . 
 I have to work . 
 I have important business to take care of that morning . 
 Do you know that the dolphin is the most intelligent animal in the world ? 
 They must be amazing animals . 
 I read that story too . They seem to be able to understand men . 
 Excuse me , how do I get to Wall Street ? 
 I ’ m sorry , but how do I know the subway train is going south ? 
 O . K . , so it ’ s this one ? 
 Oh , sorry . 
 Did you hear peter just retired ? 
 He is not young as he looks . I think he's almost sixty . 
 Good morning , sir . Could I be of any service to you ? 
 Yes , we have landscape paintings , figure paintings and flower-and-bird paintings . 
 Good . How about this picture of cranes with pine trees ? It was painted by a famous Chinese painter in King Dynasty . 
 One thousand dollars . 
 Ella , it's been such a long week . I'm ready to go out and party . Hey , let's go out for a night on the town . 
 Let's go to the new club on West Street . 
 You can wear that pretty red dress . 
 I need to cancel an account . 
 I don ’ t need two different accounts anymore . 
 Can I transfer it to my remaining account ? 
 That ’ s lovely . 
 No . That ’ s fine . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Yes , I want to have a photo . 
 Yes . I am ready . 
 How about we go and get something to drink ? 
 Do you know what you want to get ? 
 Soda isn't the best thing to drink when you're thirsty . 
 Soda isn't good for you . 
 You should really drink water . 
 It's a lot better than soda . 
 I don't know . What do you want to eat ? 
 That's what I ate yesterday . 
 I wouldn't mind a burger . 
 We're going to have to compromise . 
 Sounds good to me . 
 We can get both at the cafeteria . 
 My first job was in a well-established company where the division of labour was very clear . I do not have more chances to enrich my experience . Then I got an opportunity to really broaden my experience with a new company that was starting up , but unfortunately , they closed their service in three months ' time . I have worked in my present company for a considerable length of time and enjoy the job I am doing now , but I think I have accumulated enough experience to take up more challenging post in a much larger and diversified company where I could make solid contribution . 
 This is the place I was telling you about . 
 Good . 
 Yes , of course . Excuse me . Could you possibly let us see your menu ? Oh . They haven't got one either . 
 If the weather is good , I'll go to climb mountains . 
 No , I'm going alone . 
 Of course not . For me , mountaineering is both relaxation and a hobby . 
 Yeah , you are right , but it's really interesting . 
 Why doesn't he ask her ? 
 He's a chicken guy . 
 We appreciate your efforts in promoting the sale of our clothes in the market of this city . But according to our record , your annual turnover is not too big , so I think it is premature for us to discuss the question of agency . 
 I mean to double the amount for your sales this year at least . 
 We know you have done a good job in building up these exports for us . However , our company has the regulation for the agency . 
 I am sorry to say that it's a little higher . Our agents in other areas usually get a 3 % to 6 % commission . 
 Our price is worked out according to the costing . A 20 % commission means an increase in our price . So , I'm afraid we have to decline your proposal of acting as our sole agent . 
 Hi , Kenny . Let's go for a drink . 
 Somewhere new . It's a great place to pick up chicks . 
 Yeah , I broke up with Lisa.She blew a gasket over it . Whoa , get a load of that ! 
 Never mind the getup.She ' s beautiful ! 
 I'm gonna introduce myself . 
 Oh , oh , that tears it ! I'm getting out of here . 
 My ex-girlfriend's here.If she sees me , my goose is cooked . 
 OK , catch you later . 
 Are you all right ? 
 Good . You scared me . 
 Sure . Is this your first time skiing ? 
 Have you got any experience in advertising ? 
 Do you have any practical experience as a secretary ? 
 Would you tell me the essential qualities a secretary should maintain ? 
 Have you had any experience with computer ? 
 That's fine . What about operating the fax and duplicator ? 
 What have you learned from jobs you have held ? 
 Very good . 
 I think you should work out more too . 
 I have lost about five kilos . 
 I was on a diet and exercised daily . 
 You can try a low-impact workout schedule . Why don't you go to a gym ? 
 The secret is persistence . 
 OK . It falls on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month . It is said that there is a beautiful goddess Chang'E on the moon who had eaten some sort of elixir and had to depart her husband . She is always expecting to see her husband again . So , later we have the traditional idea that when there is the full moon , it is time for the family members to come together . 
 You are right . In China , ' round ' is an auspicious word . The moon cakes are in round shape . 
 It was not in the past . But from 2008 , we can enjoy a three-day holiday for this festival . 
 OK . Commodity inspection is really an important part of our trade contract . 
 Following the rules of world business , the exporters have the right to inspect the goods before the delivery , while the importers have the right to re-inspect the goods after their arrival . 
 Inspection is to be done by the China Commodity Inspection and Testing Bureau . Usually inspection is conducted within five days before each shipment . 
 Yes . The re-inspection should be made within seven days upon the arrival , and if any discrepancy is found , the claim must be raised within one month . 
 They always use the standard and method laid down in the contract . 
 A seminar of technical specialists including the surveyors from both sides will be held to clarify which result is correct . 
 Excited about what ? 
 Is this the first time you ’ Ve voted ? 
 That ’ s lucky . 
 You turned 18 in an election year . 
 Really ? 
 You ’ re a part of history . 
 It is beautiful ! Look , there are so many birds around it . 
 Listen to the sound of nature ! It's like music . 
 What are those ? 
 I'm going to take more pictures today . 
 Paul , can I set up a time with you to go over the training manual ? 
 Tuesday morning is good for me . How about 10:30 in my office ? 
 What made you decide on this type of occupation ? 
 Can you make yourself understood in English without too much difficulty ? 
 Do you know what the responsibilities are for a stewardess ? 
 Are you in good health ? 
 Have you had any nursing experience ? 
 How tall are you ? What about your eyesight ? 
 What would you say are your strengths and weaknesses ? 
 If a passenger can't understand what you say , what should you do ? 
 So you're going picnicking ? 
 Have a good day ! 
 Here is the final draft of our contract . I'm glad that we have reached an agreement on almost every term in our trade . 
 Do you have some points to bring up ? 
 Yes , including a description of the shirts you want to purchase this time , the total amount of your order , the price for each piece , mode of payment , packaging , shipping time , insurance and compensation , claim and arbitration , and rights and duties for both sides . Are all the terms here satisfactory ? 
 It is said that the sample 25 is the standard for others . It's complete . So would you like to sign the contract right now ? 
 You said it . I always count on him when I need his help . 
 I'm sorry for being late . 
 About what time can I go to my own class ? 
 Now that it is all over . can I go now ? 
 That's too bad ! 
 I'd love to , but my mother asks me to go home before 11:00 every night . She will worry if I get home late . 
 I have no choice . My mother is always very strict with me . 
 You're right . Mother's love is the greatest love in the world . 
 Yes , I think even though we are adults , it's still a good place for us to relax . 
 I want some exciting . Which is more fun , the roller coaster or the ferris wheel ? 
 Come on . Here is for enjoying and exciting . 
 I like ferris wheel more . 
 OK , let's go . 
 I know . Sorry , I shouldn't have rushed you , but I just couldn't stay at home and wait . 
 Why not ? I'd love to do that . 
 Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ? 
 I surely do . They must have had advanced machines in ancient China to do that . 
 Unbelievable ! I could never do that . 
 Listen ! Some people are singing outside . Is it the opera ? 
 Yes , let's do it . 
 Of course not . We don't do that . 
 Yes . 
 I haven ’ t found one that satisfies my demands yet . 
 Where is the house ? 
 Really ! So it is just near my office building . Great ! How much is the rent ? 
 Does that include utilities ? 
 That ’ s a little expensive . 
 Yes . I won ’ t have to take a bus to go to my office . Is it a one-bedroom apartment ? 
 That is what I am looking for . Could I go to see the house tomorrow afternoon ? 
 All right ! Thank you . 
 What would you like to know , Mr . Green ? 
 In 2004 , I got a job in the sales department of a trading company near Guangzhou . I started a sales representative . A year later , I was promoted to the position of sales manager . I had that job ever since , which is just over a year now . 
 Frankly , some part of it I enjoy very much , but I prefer something more professional . It happens that I have a friend working here in this company . She told me the export department was to recruit an assistant . I felt very excited at this news . That's why I'm here . 
 Okay , Mark , What ’ s up ? 
 That was my line , Mark . I know we worked on the ad together , but that was definitely my line . 
 Yes , but do you think there is eternal love in the world ? 
 I don't care . 
 I ’ m afraid not . Don ’ t you see I ’ m looking up a word in the dictionary ? 
 Well , wait a minute . 
 Yes , could you show me to your coat section ? 
 Oh , These are exactly what I ’ m looking for . 
 I'd like to try them on for size . 
 This seems to be my size . 
 Do you really think so ? 
 Alright , I'll get it . 
 That ’ s certainly true . But , that ’ s what this job is all about , Maria . There's no doubt that this project is unacceptable . 
 All right , Maria . I ’ ll give you until tomorrow at 4:00 to produce a satisfactory piece of work , but otherwise , you ’ ll have to re-do it . 
 Yes , what's it ? 
 It's miles per hour . 
 What do you want to know ? 
 Well , I was born in Shanghai and went to school there , right up through college . My father is a lawyer , and my mother is a teacher . 
 That right . One of my sisters is a doctor and the other one teaches at a university . 
 Oh , nothing in particular , I guess . I always liked mathematics and tinkering with machines . 
 More than five years now . After I did my engineering degree , I began to specialize in computer technology and I even had my own company for a while . 
 Thanks very much . 
 Have you a bus tour ? I have one day left so I think the best way is to take a bus tour . 
 What time does the next bus leave ? 
 All the soldiers in that country are armed to the teeth . 
 The neighboring country is threatening their sovereignty with its nuclear bombs . 
 That's so great ! 
 This t . v is only $ 2500 . 
 That's how much this t . v costs . 
 This television is of very high quality . 
 By how much ? 
 I'm sorry , but the price is final . 
 Tina , you should have more nutritious food.Don ' t eat these crisps any more . 
 Have you ever heard the ads say anything bad about their products ? 
 Yes . If people can not communicate with each other easily , they can not understand each other's way of thinking . 
 Many exporters speak French and German as well . 
 Even if the language is accurate , a misunderstanding can not be avoided due to cultural differences . 
 Yes , it not only includes the nation's historical and cultural background , but also contains the nation's view of life way of life and way of thinking . 
 Excuse me , sir ? I just need a little bit more information . Could you tell me your telephone number and mailing address ? 
 That ’ s 545-8897 and your mailing address is 908 Mulbury Street . The zip code is 20310 , right ? 
 Hello , can I speak to Mr.Green ? 
 This is Steven speaking . I'd like to buy a stock . 
 I'd like to buy 1 000 shares of Duson . 
 Let me see . The offering price is near or at $ 88 . 
 Do you mean that I have to buy it at current price ? 
 I heard that this stock would go up . Hum , I will take it at current price . 
 Yes , please . 
 Yes , we are . 
 In the spring . 
 Well .. we're not sure yet , probably in St.Albans . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 We're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in South London . 
 Yes , probably but I may look for another one when we're settled in . 
 Oh , it's really popular these days . 
 Honestly speaking , I think the one next to it suits you better . 
 That's not true . Look over there ! That lady chose the same one and she is surely older than you . 
 Which color do you like ? 
 Nice choice . 
 I hope not but it will take at least three hours . 
 What can I do ? 
 Well , the books are in the box . What can I do now ? 
 All right . 
 These magazines are interesting . May I borrow one ? 
 Thanks , John . 
 Sure , sir . How many of you are there ? 
 No problem , sir . When are you coming to dinner ? 
 Every time when heroes came back from the battlefield , we took our hats off to them . 
 I wish I were a hero . 
 Is she ? I thought she was a mathematician . 
 Are you ? I thought you had something to drink at her home . 
 I ’ ll buy you a drink . 
 Woo hoo ! This just might be the start of the rest of my life ! 
 I ’ m in the market for a job ! I went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until I got the names of a few employers I would like to work for . I have the resume I wrote for English class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write . I ’ Ve even done my research and found the names of the managers so I can address the letters personally . And you know I can be charming in interviews . Goodbye my penniless days ! Hello salary and a career ! 
 Oh , just for a position as a gas station attendant . You know , starting at a simple lowly job , just like all the greats before they made it big in the world . 
 But I ’ m just in it for the money , right ? How else am I going to be able to afford to keep taking Angela to the movies ? Besides , I love the smell of gasoline , don ’ t you ? 
 I think I am very good at planning . I manage my time well so that I can always get things done on time . 
 I always give each job my best efforts , so when others are not pulling their weight , I am frustrated . 
 I got the Scientific Research Prize from the Gansu government for my achievements in the Northwest Regional Economy Development Research Project . 
 Working under pressure is exciting and challenging . I don ’ t mind . In fact , I am very efficient when certain pressure is exerted on the work . 
 There was a time when both the clerical assistant and the secretary resigned at the same time . I then had to handle their work temporarily . The workload was incredibly heavy . So I started to set priorities for the jobs and hired part-time staff to handle routine work . Finally , I managed to keep the operation smooth until we found someone to fill the vacancy . 
 I stick to my principles and keep to the rules . Sometimes , they just lack enthusiasm and I get them involved with something constructive . Some of them change their attitude later . 
 It's for free , because your computers are still in the period of guarantee--two years . 
 They are working in another factory to provide maintenance right now . Let me call them and see whether they have solved the problem . Please wait a moment . 
 That's wonderful . I appreciate your efficiency and cooperation . 
 Thank you again ! 
 Hello , this is Smith from 1308 , can you add something to my room ? 
 2 towels and l Turkish towel , please ? 
 Thank you . 
 No more , thank you very much . 
 Oh , that's right . They're filming a movie up there , aren't they ? 
 I wonder how all the businesses in the area feel about that . 
 The movie company has to pay them ? 
 Oh , yeah , they get to be in a movie for the whole world to see ! 
 I'd love to go out with you , but I'm sorry I'm busy tonight , but I'd like a rain check . 
 Will they send me a form telling me that I have been granted unemployment ? 
 What information will be in that letter ? 
 What other forms will I need to turn in ? 
 What will they be asking me on that form ? 
 What else will they ask me ? 
 Hello . I want to send the computer to my sister in Shanghai by logistics transport . 
 Yes . This is the computer and this is the keyboard and the monitor . 
 There are a mouse and a camera . 
 Yes . How much is it to send these things to Shanghai by regular delivery ? 
 I see . Can you weigh them for me , please ? 
 OK . See you later . 
 That ’ s great . What are the prizes ? 
 To encourage the staff increases . 
 What about the afternoon ? 
 Sam , I am so sorry . It was your birthday yesterday and I completely forgot about it . 
 Margaret really told me off when she found out that I had forgotten all about it . We did try to phone you , but you and Jane must have gone out . 
 Oh , yes , I know the one . How was the food ? 
 Oh , no . 
 I would think this was the least they could do . 
 Great . I have also been thinking of getting one . Do you think you could ask Jane to have a quiet word with Margaret ? My birthday is not that far away . 
 It is too bad today . 
 My som was lost . I told him to stand rooted to the spot when I went shopping , but he ignored it . 
 It was the police wo helped me to do that . 
 May I speak to Marry ? 
 Ok , I'll try her back then . 
 Aunt Shirley , I heard the Yuan Miao Festival is the name for the festival . Why did it get its name ? 
 Oh , I see . I also heard today is the last day for the street fair . Can ’ t wait to sample all the snacks . 
 Can you recommend some must-try ? 
 What ’ s that ? It gets the name from the festival itself . That ’ s really funny ! 
 Oh , I know Tangyuan . It ’ s a sweet snack , good for dessert . 
 I ’ d like to try the salty ones . Where does that strange smell come from ? 
 Hello , Lucy . This is Monica again . I have a question . 
 I was wondering what kind of resume do you prefer , an e-resume or a paper one ? 
 Ok , thank you . 
 Let's get down to business . 
 Yes . I have . I'm interested in your underwear . If the price is acceptable we would like to order it soon . 
 What's your price ? 
 That's a bit more than I was prepared to pay . 
 I offer you 110 yuan . 
 All right . I go up to 115 yuan , but not a penny more . Is that acceptable ? 
 Well , I'll accept the price and place an order for 10,000 pieces . 
 What's the weather like in your hometown ? 
 Is it hot in summer ? 
 What do you reading , Linda ? 
 What's it about ? 
 Is it difficult to understand ? 
 Besides novels , any other types literary works that you indulgence . 
 Have you read anything else besides literature ? 
 I agree . People who don't read are no better often people who can't read . I also agree that books are like food for the mind . 
 Where are you heading , sir ? 
 What's your flight time ? 
 I guess we should get there no later than 7:00 . 
 Well , since it's rush hour , I'd say the ride would take about thirty minutes , more or less.Is that okay ? 
 Excuse me . Do you mind telling me the time when the recruitment will officially start ? 
 Should I arrive early or on time ? 
 How do I buy my textbooks ? 
 Yes , I have my list . 
 Yes , I know where the bookstore is . 
 No , I didn't know I could do that . 
 Yes , I am going today . 
 Yes , thank you . That would be great . 
 Where is your native place ? 
 So are you a local ? 
 So , is L . A . all it's cracked up to be ? 
 And , is it what you found ? 
 You're right . Life isn't always like the movies . 
 We don't have a full-sized swimming pool , but we do have individual swim stations . 
 Basically , a swim station is like a treadmill , except instead of running , you swim . 
 If you're a registered guest , you have free access to our swim stations . 
 To conserve electricity , the stations operate only from 7a . m . till 10 . 
 I don't think you'll be disappointed . People really seem to like the swim stations . 
 Her name is Rose.Why ? 
 Oh , shut up.She ' s already got married . 
 Here , sir . Sit down in this wheel chair . 
 The doctor will be with you in a moment . I just need to ask you a few questions . 
 Name , age and date of birth , please ? 
 Health insurance company and policy No ? 
 What ? 
 Well , this is going to be a very expensive broken leg , Mr . Taylor . 
 Have you met the new manager in customer service ? 
 She . She seems to be doing a pretty good job . Of course , anything would be better than that last guy ! 
 Hey , Brad . How was your day ? 
 I'm going home . 
 Is that right ? 
 So he takes attendance once in the morning and once in the afternoon . 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 Would you tell me the name of the book and the author ? 
 I'm sorry . It's out of stock now . Could you come by again next week ? 
 Well , then , is it convenient to leave your phone number so that I can inform you as soon as we restock it ? 
 You're welcome . 
 What's so special about this song ? 
 Not very much . It sounds too emotional to me . 
 I'm afraid my association with Broadway musicals is rather limited . 
 I have a better idea . Let's go to a jazz concert and I'll give you an education in jazz . 
 Let me see . It depends . 
 If you are in a hurry , you should take a taxi . 
 Yes , very . Believe it or not , it will cost you more than one hundred dollars . 
 Take a bus then . It will only cost you 5 dollars . 
 What's the matter with my wife ? 
 I guess so . It was very terrible when she was at the onset of the illness . I am worried that I would lose her . 
 I know . But is she out of danger now ? 
 Thank you very much , Doctor . 
 Marry Lin's Office , this is Linda . 
 Hi , Mr . Wang , what can I help you with ? 
 Certainly , hold on . 
 I really need to find a bus that goes by PCC . 
 All the way up on Las Flores Drive and Fair Oaks . 
 Walking isn't a problem for me . 
 Which direction do I want ? 
 Do you know where I get off at ? 
 Thanks for letting me know , home-girl . 
 What are your plans for today ? 
 Would you like to have dinner with me at King Hotel at 7pm ? 
 Come back . You haven't paid yet . 
 But he took some newspaper away without paying . 
 Why ? You make me confused . 
 Why does he have such a privilege ? 
 I see . Does he live by himself ? 
 He must be lonely ? 
 How respectable ! 
 I find the sheet in my room is so stained.Would you please help us change it for a clean one ? 
 All right . Please be quick about it . 
 Where do you want to go ? 
 I'm sorry , but you got on the wrong bus . 
 You should change to the No . 701 bus at the next stop . 
 Not at all . 
 Sure.It will depart 2 hours later . 
 That's $ 150 . 
 Of course.Right now it is the slack season , we will give you ten percent off . 
 I am sorry , there is no difference . 
 Oh yeah and decorating the house too was colored paper and pictures . they will put a Christmas tree just inside the front door , pained toys and colored electric lights along the branches and plays all the gift packages under it . 
 Sure our thing . 
 Thanks . 
 Rhaki.Do you want some ? 
 I will show you . 
 Less than 5 % . It's quite durable . 
 Let me check the computer . Uh-oh , Looks like your luggage is on its way to Paris . 
 Well , we can give you this lovely shaving kit and call you the minute your luggage arrives here . Just leave us a contact number . 
 Thank you . I am terribly sorry about this . It very rarely happens . We do have a sophisticated tracking system , so I know we will find it soon . But we apologize for the inconvenience . 
 Wow ! I have been working here for 15 years and you ’ re the first person to accept a lost luggage situation cheerfully . 
 How is night life in Beijing ? 
 What do you suggest then ? 
 That's a great idea . Let's go ... Oh , the dance hall looks very nice and the music is wonderful . 
 That's great ! I love to dance to fast music . 
 Yes , disco dancing is my favorite.It ' s great fun and good exercise as well . 
 Now the band is playing a slow dance . 
 Sorry , I think I'Il sit out the next dance . 
 Where ’ s Sally , Jack ? 
 What ’ s she doing ? 
 Is Tim in the garden , too ? 
 I beg your pardon ? Who ’ s climbing the tree . 
 What about the dog ? 
 Union Bank . How can I be of service ? 
 I'll need your name and account number . 
 Jeff , I'm going to the supermarket . Do you want to come with me ? 
 Oh , When does it close ? 
 That's too bad . 
 Alright . What do you want to do now ? 
 Where does she live ? 
 How long has she lived there ? 
 That's a long time . Where did she live before that ? 
 What are you going to do after you return from Washington ? 
 What will you do all day ? 
 Have you ever worked ? 
 I'm going to camp . I've gone to camp for four summers . 
 We do many things . In the morning , we go swimming and boating . In the afternoon , we play basketball or tennis . We sit around a camp fire at night.We sing or tell stories . 
 It is wonderful . What's John going to do this summer ? 
 Well , so long , Mary . Have fun . 
 Can I apply for a permit today ? 
 I think I forgot it in the car . 
 I'm going to go and get my ID from the car right now . 
 Here you go . 
 May I borrow your pen ? 
 Thanks for your help . 
 Hi , sir . Come and have a look here . We have all kinds of sweaters . 
 How do you like this grey one ? It ’ s pure wool , one hundred percent of Xinjiang wool . 
 Yes , we do . What size do you want ? 
 Well , you can always bring it back to us for a full refund . 
 Yes , just a moment , please . 
 I have had an incredible boss , who was my direct supervisor during the last year of my coop work experience . A-bout two months after I began working for her , she really let me spread my wings . She encouraged me to work independently , because she said she had come to trust my judgment and commitment . So I was able to move forward on projects without having to check in with her every day . Of course , I made certain that she knew what I had accomplished on a daily and weekly basis because I gave her summary reports , although she didn't specifically ask me to . Without her support and encouragement , I don't think I would have felt confident enough to have written up a proposal suggesting that the department change a process that had been in place for a long time . But she was open to suggestions , so long as employees could back them up with research and facts . When I submitted my suggestion , she reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work . She then took my revised proposal to her boss . He was a more conservative type , but she lobbied him to try It for several weeks . He did , and it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change . I've also worked for some very difficult bosses in summer and part-time jobs . And while I'd certainly prefer to work for one like I've just described , I'm the kind of person who can get along with just about anyone . 
 I am sure we do have . 
 If you want some changes , just tell me . 
 Well , that's your uncle Bill , his wife and two of their daughters . 
 No , your uncle Jack is my brother , Bill is my brother-in-law , your mom's brother . 
 That's right , Sarah and Jane are both your cousins although they are step-sisters . 
 Sarah is your uncle Bill's older daughter . When she was young , Bill's first wife , Sarah's mom died . Three years later Bill married again . 
 Yes . She is Sarah's step-mother . 
 They want to travel to Europe next year , and will visit us at the same Ae . 
 Welcome . One of your duties is to know the number of the customer and accept reservation . 
 You inform the people in charge and let them reserve dinning tables for guests . 
 Is he all right ? There's a big hospital just around the corner . 
 All right , sir . I'll have someone to take you there . By the way , is he insured ? 
 I'm glad to hear that . In case he's not insured , the hospital will never accepts any patient . 
 He said that I have been eating too much . 
 Yes , he asked me to clean up my diet by cutting red meat . 
 Isn't this lovely weather ? Will you help me water the flowers , Jack ? 
 I do.We haven't watered them for quite a few days . 
 Good.So we don't have to work.How nice ! 
 Why ? 
 Oh , I'm afraid all the flowers will die in the rain . 
 I usually calm down first and think about the reason that caused my anger . 
 Something like listening to music is a good idea . 
 Classic . Something that could calm your mind . 
 Working out is another good way to relieve anger . 
 Jogging , yoga , or even just taking a walk . 
 How long have you had it ? 
 I think you've got a cold . 
 I'll give you some medicine , and you will be better in a couple of days . 
 What's up , officer ? 
 There was a stop sign ? 
 If there really was a stop sign , I couldn't see it because of the overgrown bushes . 
 If I saw the stop sign , I would've stopped for it . 
 Am I getting a ticket for this ? 
 Thank you , I really do appreciate that . 
 Have you finished ? 
 Would you like some of coffee ? 
 Yes sir , one moment please . here is the check . 
 Here is the change . 
 Thank you very much sir . 
 Who was it ? 
 She never cares about others . 
 Her new boyfriend , right ? 
 I was also interrupted by her last week because of such a thing . 
 I think so too , and you have a general understanding of the company now . 
 What else do you want to know ? 
 Then , how much do you wish to be paid each month ? 
 We will give you more than what you hope . 
 You will have a six-month internship after you enter our company . During this period you can get 2,500 yuan a month , and after that you can get 3,500 yuan per month . 
 You can also get a bonus at the end of the year , and if you can keep working in the company , your salary will get a raise every year . 
 Five days every week , but if it is necessary , you need to work overtime once in a while 
 Well , I can ’ t believe your uncle and aunt came to stay with us for a week , and they did not even call us in advance . 
 I know , but it is hard for me to get used to your relatives coming to visit us , and without warning . 
 Yes , but Americans never visit without calling in advance , and they almost never stay overnight . 
 I think you ’ re right ! 
 Big time ! A hacker broke into the company's files and got all her personal information . You really think it's completely safe ? 
 Now we're getting to the truth . 
 See ? And I bet that's easy to do online . Everybody's anonymous . 
 You need to get a car tag first . There's a one hundred Yuan deposit for the car tag . 
 Thank you . We'll bring the receipt up to your room when we get it . 
 Well , I swim and run every day . 
 Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs . 
 Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit . 
 Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you . 
 I feel terribly bored . I'm going to take a job . 
 Then I can buy my own car . 
 And pay for my own clothes . 
 Good evening , ma'am . May I help you ? 
 Will the object fit into this size of box ? 
 Could you fill out this form , please , ma'am ? 
 Thank you , ma'am . Would you like to use it until May 20th ? 
 This way , please . Your box number is 522 . 
 If you would like to use the contents during the period of use , please come here in person . After confirming your signature , we will open the box . 
 May I ask you how much this position pays per year ? 
 What kind of benefits does this job have ? 
 What type of vacation time do we get ? 
 Do we have a 401K ? 
 What type of professional development do you offer ? 
 Where do I sign up for my benefits package ? 
 I stayed online chatting with friends all night . It was great fun . 
 It is better I don't know them . So I can say anything I want . 
 Who cares ? It's just online . It's not real . Do you want to join me tonight ? 
 Have you any idea of the prices of ruby and diamond ? 
 How do you know that ? 
 This is your schedule . 
 You are our honored guests . 
 I ’ m sorry , Janet . I left it at home . I ’ ll bring it back in the morning . 
 I know , Janet . I just walked out and forgot it completely . I ’ ll go home and get it at noon , all right ? 
 I read or go swimming , go shopping , usually . I run or play tennis or do something else like those to get some exercises to keep fit . 
 I wouldn't call myself extroverted . Sometimes , I enjoy being by myself very much . But other times , I like sharing activities with others too , especially during these last few years . 
 I like almost all sports , and I enjoy both playing and watching . I especially like tennis and mountain climbing . 
 Well , I approach things very enthusiastically , I think , and I don't like to leave something half-done . It makes me nervous-I can't concentrate on something else until the first thing is finished . 
 Can you point out your mother for me ? 
 Are you free this weekend , Miss Rose ? 
 Then would you please go to a dance party with me ? 
 Oh , no . As a matter of fact , I haven't danced for a long time . 
 Thanks for flattering me . I think you dance a lot , right ? 
 What's your favorite dance ? 
 How about rock'n'roll ? 
 And the tango ? 
 Don't be so modest . I'm sure you can do it very well . Then I'll meet you at six . Is that at all right ? 
 Great ! I'm your lucky fellow then . 
 No , I haven't . I'm so surprised at the news . 
 Congratulations . But have you heard the proverb that if one gets married too hurriedly one may regret it for a long time ? 
 How's your married life ? 
 I have to say you're a well-matched couple . 
 Excuse me . I seem to have lost my son . 
 Shirley . 
 Daniel . 
 He is in a blue sportswear and a white sportsshoes . About 1.4 meters . 
 I've brought this dress back to exchange it . 
 I was hoping you'd have something on sale today . 
 Is the sale going to include dresses ? 
 I like the sound of that . I'll just come back next weekend . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Certainly . Would you like it with ice cream ? 
 Hi , boss . You wanted to see me ? 
 Excuse me ? I hope I didn't just hear what I think I just heard . 
 You're going to make me rich by not paying me ? 
 Sure . Why don ’ t you try it on ? The fitting room is over there . 
 I ’ m thinking about buying this sweater . I know it ’ s June now , but it will be perfect for autumn and winter . 
 Yes , it ’ s half price . It ’ s supposed to be too large--that ’ s the fashion . 
 There.It looks great , don ’ t you think ? I ’ m going to get these jeans as well . I need a new pair . I ‘ m also going to buy this scarf ready for winter . 
 Don ’ t worry . I ’ Ve got my credit card . You can pay me back later . 
 911 . How may I help you ? 
 When did this break-in occur ? 
 Where did the break-in happen ? 
 Was anything taken ? 
 What makes you think there was a break-in ? 
 I'll send a squad car . 
 Richard ! I need those tax forms from you before five ! 
 Okay . The sooner the better . 
 How are you making out ? 
 I hope so . Thank you again for your delightful gift . 
 Where are you going for lunch ? 
 I know of a restaurant . I'm sure you'll like it . 
 Yes.it serves excellent Sichuan food . Spicy food may improve your appetite . 
 Do you like the apartment ? 
 Everything is okay ? 
 What ’ s the problem ? 
 We will have the carpet cleaned before you move into the apartment . 
 I assure you that we will , and if there are any more problems , feel free to tell me . 
 I ’ m glad to know that you think the apartment is so nice . 
 May I see that ivory horse ? 
 It's genuine , I bet . 
 I'll take it . 
 I never really give them money because I don't want to contribute to their addictions . 
 I usually ask them if they want some food and then give them something to eat . I figure that if they're homeless , they're probably hungry . 
 almost always . However , sometimes they get mad at me for not giving them any cash . 
 the cost of living in London is just too high for most people . 
 did you know that few people can pay the rent on minimum wage , let alone pay for food and other living costs ? 
 added to that is the high unemployment rate right now . 
 politicians like to ignore the problems of the working class . They like to focus on making life easier for the upper class . 
 that was a really good meal , Gordon . 
 well , it is getting pretty late . I think we should go home . 
 let's see how much the bill is . 
 what are you talking about ? We'll split the bill . 
 no way , Gordon . I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill . 
 that's better . This way we will both have money to take a cab home , otherwise , you would probably have to walk . 
 you've got a deal . 
 bye . 
 Marketing has us set up with product launches in five major cities , as well as some sponsoring events throughout the year . All together , there will be 15 events . 
 It's not what you're thinking . These events will give us a wider exposure than most . Take the tri-city marathon for starters . This is a highly publicized event . The television exposure alone will nearly double our customer awareness . 
 We've got a spot in Olympic Stadium sponsoring one of a team's equipment , then a rally for cancer research , and a connection to the inner-city education program . 
 It might seem that way , but this events were all carefully chosen based on marketing research . These are the events that our customers and potential customers care about . 
 My hands are full . Can ’ t you see that ? 
 All right . Just wait a minute , OK ? 
 Yes . I would like a ticket to Pakistan on CA . 
 Round trip , please . 
 I'd like to leave on Nov . 2nd and return on Nov . 21st . 
 Yes , please . Thank you . 
 Okay , Bob , What is it ? 
 All right . 
 Yes , here you are . 
 Well , it's straight , but it's upside down I'm afraid . 
 Oh , to be frank , I think it's sheer waste of time to watch it . 
 But I don't think much of it . 
 Just fill out an application . 
 You are expected to know the E-mail address of the unit . 
 Send out an application through Job-wanted on the website . 
 It's a two-way choice . And your application will be read . 
 Sina , 21st Century Talent Net , and a few others . 
 Hello , sir . What can we do for you today ? 
 Would you like your hair washed as well ? 
 Okay , have a seat over here . How do you want it cut ? 
 All right . 
 But that was the first thing that came into my mind when I heard the shout earthquake ! 
 That would be too late . 
 Yes , I think I should have jumped in any case . 
 What's the minimum quantity of an order for your goods ? 
 No problem . We want a minimum of 1,000 dozen of men's shirts and a minimum of 3,000 dozen of embroidered shirts . Can you guarantee continuous production and adequate supply ? 
 And for such a big quantity , you should give us a discount . 
 That's great . 
 If they all unite on a certain issue , it's the stockholders who have the final say . You'd think it might be our CEO or the workers , but in fact , the stockholders control the money so they have the most power . 
 It might not be the most efficient , but if you think about it , it makes pretty good sense . The stockholders are our investors . They own the capital in our company , so they should have say about what is done with the company . 
 Hello , I'd like to see Mr . Charles , the manager , please . 
 No . I haven't , but I'll take only a few minutes of his time . 
 Yes . My name is Lin Tao , the director of Guangzhou Computer Corporation . 
 ( 2 minutes later ) Mr . Lin , Mr . Charles can see you now . This way , please . 
 I think I will continue my studies . Now it's not easy for a graduate with bachelor's degree to get a job since there are so many graduates with master's or doctor's degree . We are likely to lose in competing with them in the job market . 
 Well , I think so . But I am thinking of going aboard to get a master's and doctor's degree . If can get a Ph . D . abroad , it will be much easy for me to get a job at home . 
 I think I will try to get the scholarship since I really don't have so much money to study abroad . Actually now I am preparing for the TEFL and GRE exams . If I can get high marks in the two exams and if I am lucky enough , I may get a scholarship . 
 Jane , I was wondering if you you had any plans for saturday afternoon . 
 There is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum , I was hoping you ' d like to come with me . 
 What about sunday ? 
 Maybe next week . 
 Sorry to hear that , I was really looking forward to spending some more time with you , I really enjoyed our last chat . 
 Can you give me a ride back home ? 
 Yes , madam ? Can I help you ? 
 Well , yes , we are , madam . The shop shuts down in five minutes . 
 Last week , madam ? I really can't remember which ones you mean . What were they like ? 
 That's strange . I don't recognize any of the ones we had from that description . Are you sure they were in this shop ? 
 I am afraid the sales are over now , madam . And you know we all sold out of the saucepans . 
 Well , it's all new stock in the window now . 
 Eh , well , madam , as you know we are closing . 
 Perhaps madam , if you come back tomorrow , I could show you the whole range of kitchen ware . And there are still one or two things at the sale price . 
 That might be the artificial lighting , madam . Of course , if you could come back in daylight , you might find it ’ s exactly what you are looking for . 
 I'd like to pick up my package . 
 Could you show me your ID , Please ? 
 A moment , please . 
 you said it . Good beer , good music , and on top of that , there are so many hot girls here ! 
 well , she's alright , but not really my cup of tea . What about the blond with the red dress ? 
 yeah ! She could do anything she wants to me ! 
 I don't think so . I get so nervous talking to girls . I always put my foot in my mouth , scare her off , and end up looking like a real fool . Besides , she is way out of my league . 
 okay okay , just let me have another cup of beers to get my head in the game . 
 why ? 
 okay , here I go ! 
 I opened my mail , found this eviction notice , and don ’ t know what to do with it . 
 Just for being a few days late ? 
 Are you taking my apartment away ? 
 Can I keep the apartment if I pay my rent in full ? 
 I will go write a check right now . 
 Tom , I won first prize in the poetry contest . 
 Really ! Here's my trophy . 
 Is the environment a big issues in your country ? It is in mine . 
 What methods do you use to conserve water ? 
 I see . I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution . 
 We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced . 
 I think you ’ re right . There needs to be an international response to this problem . 
 What a great idea ! Now you have a friendly audience to practice with ! 
 Oh , he wants to practice his language skills , too . 
 Maybe Olga can introduce you to some of her friends who can write to you in German and you can do the same for her with your friends to write her in English . 
 I don't know , but you know how to surround yourself with great friends ! 
 Fine , how are you doing ? 
 What do you want to do ? 
 Where do you want to go ? 
 What kind of Italian food do you like ? 
 No , I don't , but I like pizza . 
 Good . 
 Do you mean this Saturday ? 
 Thanks for inviting me , Jack , but I ’ Ve already made plans for this weekend . I won ’ t be able to come , I ’ m afraid . 
 Yeah , that ’ s too bad . 
 Morning , Tom ! What are you doing over there ? Learning to dance ? 
 Oh , my goodness . I'm sorry . But I don't think tai chi is to be practiced like that . 
 Well , they just look a bit funny . but far from making a laughing stock out of you . 
 To begin with , you should keep your neck erect upward at any time . 
 Good ! And then , the entire body . Never incline your body forward or backward . Take care to regulate the point of balance . Place it at your waist . 
 No ! You should avoid sticking out your belly . Keep your hip steady . Don't swing . 
 Oh , yes , things are quite different with the limbs . Keep your knees bent a little . Right , they should be rich in elasticity . Move slowly when you shift your centre of gravity from one leg to another . 
 Exactly ! Move your arms in a relaxed manner . Well . don't stretch yourfingers stiffly . Just keep them in a natural shape . 
 Fine , thank you . I haven ’ t seen you for quite some time . What have you been up to recently ? 
 Oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? They're so scary . 
 It's amazing . But if I were you , I wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one . 
 Maybe , but I would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . I wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one . 
 Yep . 
 Maybe . After all , I am grown up now . 
 May I see your driver's license , please ? 
 We have Honda , Citroen and Toyota . Which make and model do you prefer ? 
 The price is 60 euro per day . Do you want insurance ? 
 That's an extra 10 euro a day . 
 Yes . 
 You mean he had been put in prison before . 
 Oh , he had fooled me . 
 What kind of beef would you like to get ? 
 How many pounds would you like ? 
 What kind of ground beef do you want ? 
 I can get that for you . 
 You're welcome , Let me go wrap the ground beef up for you . 
 Ben , what are you doing ? 
 Why ? 
 Have you thought about graduate school ? 
 Would you mind telling me then — what were those four years of college for ? What was the point of all that hard work ? 
 Now listen , Ben . Look , I think it ’ s a very good thing that a young man — after he ’ s done some very good work — should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself , and lie around , and drink beer and so on . But after a few weeks I believe that person should want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass . 
 Oh , yes . I often went on business trips in the past six years . 
 I speak English and French in addition to my mother tongue , Chinese . 
 My present monthly salary is $ 1,500 . 
 I think so . 
 Thank you . Mr . A , and I certainly hope the answer will be favorable . Goodbye . 
 No , it is the original one . 
 I have changed a case for it . 
 Of course . That's why I bought this type . I can change its case frequently , so it is novel to use it . 
 There are two more , one is orange and the other is pink . I have bought them all . 
 I need to copy a document immediately . 
 Great ! How much is it for a copy ? 
 That sounds reasonable . I'll be down there immediately . 
 It's very nice of you to invite me . 
 Thank you . This is my first time to come to a Chinese restaurant . Could you tell me the different features of Chinese food ? 
 Chinese dishes are exquisitely prepared , delicious , and very palatable . They are very good in colour , flavour , and taste . 
 No more , thank you . I'm quite full . 
 It's the most delicious dinner I've had for a long time . It's such a rich dinner . 
 Thank you very much for your hospitality . 
 Yeah , I just cannot find it anywhere . 
 You are risking your neck . Don ’ t you know they have guns . 
 I ’ m making a deposit today . 
 I would like to deposit a check . 
 Okay . Here you go . 
 Yes , I would . 
 Let me get $ 150 back . 
 Thank you . Have a good one . 
 Yes . Please send one " Fried Rice , Hangzhou Style " and one " Fruit Salad " to my room . 
 Yes , two bottles of beer . 
 Carlsborg . 
 No , thanks . 
 Yes , two of us . 
 Yes , Bill Smith in Room 713 . 
 Hi , Craig ! How are you ? 
 Really ? That's too bad ! You should be at home in bed . It's really important to get a lot of rest . 
 And have you taken anything for it ? 
 Well , it's helpful to chop up some garlic and cook it in chicken stock . Then drink a cup every half hour . It really works ! 
 Hit ' em high , hit ' em low . Class of ' 93 — let's go ! 
 Wasn't that football game great ! I just knew we'd win ! 
 Later we'll let you know who the King and Queen of the Reunion will be . 
 Hi , Deny . Are still working ? 
 So , you are leaving , aren't you ? 
 How nice ! I can see you are busying packing . I'm sorry to interrupt you . 
 Yes , could you please go over this for me ? and see if there is any mistake in it ? 
 Excuse me for taking your time . 
 Hey , Wen ! Welcome to D . C . ! Glad you came out to visit ! 
 Howard is eighty percent black . But there are whites , and even Asians here . Thankfully , it's also coed . 
 Sorry , nope . But the Alpha Phi Alpha's are throwing a party tonight . 
 Hi . I need a wake-up call tomorrow . 
 I need two calls , one at 7 and another at 7 fifteen . 
 Then again , I think 7 fifteen is too early . Change 7 fifteen to 7 thirty , please . 
 Not just now , but if I do think of something later , I'll give you a ring . 
 I was really glad to hear about your promotion . Congratulations ! 
 Sure , but the work you did was really exceptional ! You definitely deserved it ! 
 You are always responsible and careful . 
 Thank you . I'll try my best . By the way , when do you take over the new position ? 
 So what are you responsible for ? 
 So you must get higher pay than before . 
 1,000 Yuan ? That's great ! So ... 
 Really ? Can I order anything I want ? 
 What's for lunch ? 
 We're going to have to postpone the meeting . 
 Mr . Chen can't make it today . 
 Almost ready . I am making a double check . 
 Of course . And I have also packed two umbrellas just in case of raining . 
 Of course . I just bought it last year . 
 Yes , I did . Don't worry . 
 Yes . You think a lot , too . 
 He would get very angry if anyone criticized him . 
 If only he knew it . 
 Can't you stay for a little bit longer , it's only 8 . 
 OK.See you on Today . 
 You too.Thanks for dropping in . 
 I would like to check in . Here are my ticket and baggage . 
 Well , can I put something in this handbag ? 
 Good morning , may I help you ? 
 Please fill out this form . 
 Yes . You must put on her name and address . 
 Let me check . Yes . Your 1,000 remittance , please . 
 This rate is one percent . That will be 10 yuan . 
 Generally it will arrive within three days . 
 So that concludes the introduction . Now let's move to the first part of my talk , which is about 2006 fiscal year marketing plan . So first , right off the bat , When looking at the marketing plan , tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with ... 
 That's correct . If you remember , we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets . Now , when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals , there are three things to consider . First , the original condition of the market , second , our marketing numbers from the previous year , and third , our final sales figures for this year . Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts . If you look at the overhead , you'll see a graph ... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005 , the red line is the sales in 2006 ... As you can see , our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with , but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year . On the other hand , you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket . 
 But newspapers do get some extra income by offering space for ads . 
 Even with volume sales our costs for the Exec User won't go down much . 
 We could take a cut on the price . But 25 % would reduce much our profit margin . We suggest a compromise 10 % . 
 I don't think I can change it right now . Why don't we talk again tomorrow ? 
 Robert , I have been instructed to reject the numbers you proposed , but we can try to come up with something else . 
 I understand . We propose a structured deal . For the first six months , we get a discount of 20 % and the next six months we get 15 % . 
 Then you'll have to think of something better , Robert . 
 Do you have any sunscreen lotion ? 
 I think I'm getting a heart stroke . 
 Why ? It's brand new , and it's perfect on you . 
 Beauty costs , honey . 
 Walking under the sun is certainly not the way . 
 Right . Sorry . Anyway , the radio said that it'll rain later today . 
 Is there anything else , apart from the Credit Rating and Debt to Asset Ratio ? 
 Right , OK . That , again , shouldn't be a problem . 
 Well , as far as I can tell , we qualify . 
 Mr . Green , I ’ d like to introduce you to Mr . Brown . 
 My pleasure , Mr . Green . I look forward to an excellent relationship with your company . 
 Okay , let ’ s make a toast . 
 I think I ’ m very good at planning . I manage my time perfectly , so that I can always get things done on time . 
 Because I ’ m very competent in this area . 
 Yes , I work well under pressure and find it dimly . However , I believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines . 
 I don ’ t try to go ahead of people and lead them , I ’ d rather cooperate with everybody else and get the job done by working together . 
 sure . My mom has been working on our family tree for years . She ’ s always updating it . 
 I can show it to you now , if you like . I think it goes back about 8 generations so far . 
 I ’ Ve got 30 cousins on my mom ’ s side and 10 cousins on my dad ’ s side . 
 the ones that are my age are close relatives . Now that I ’ m older , I don ’ t spend as much time with them as I used to , so I don ’ t know my younger cousins as well as the older ones . 
 it ’ s definitely my mother . And , her mother is definitely the matriarch of the bigger family . 
 at first , she was quite critical of her , but now that they ’ Ve been married for a few years , she ’ s starting to accept the fact that my father divorced my mother . 
 It's awfully hot . 
 Hello , I'm looking for a shop that sells inexpensive cashmere sweaters . 
 Why didn't I think of that ? 
 Thanks . That is a good suggestion . 
 Personnel . May I help you ? 
 This is she . Paul ? 
 Dental clinic . This is Mr . Adams . 
 All right , David . Is this for a checkup or a cleaning ? 
 What tooth is giving you pain ? 
 Let me see ... We can see you this afternoon if you can come in at four thirty . 
 What happened ? Quarrel again ? 
 Don't ask me . I don't wanna be involved in your quarrel . 
 Yes , I'm off again at the beginning of next week . I need to get some Traveller's Cheques . 
 Sure . At least if I do get robbed , heaven forbid , I can get my money back using the traveller's cheques insurance . Once , when I was travelling in France , I was pick-pocketed and not only did you replace my Traveller's Cheques for free , you also did it extremely quickly and easily . 
 Sure , what do you want me to tell them ? 
 Ok , where can I find their telephone number ? 
 Is it their home , office or cell phone numbers ? 
 Alright . What if I can ’ t get a hold of them by phone ? 
 Where can I find their e-mail addresses ? 
 And if there aren ’ t any e-mail addresses ? 
 Ok . That sounds easy enough . Have you called any of them yet ? 
 Did you leave a voice message ? 
 I see . What did you tell her ? 
 Ok , so , maybe I should call her again . 
 One more question . It looks like some of these numbers are long-distance . Do you have a calling card that I can use to get through to them ? 
 Alright . Thanks a lot . Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll take care of it . 
 See you . 
 Send it by the fastest way . 
 How much ? 
 OK . 
 Let me get my morning coffee to get my brain working again . 
 As long as the foam on my macchiato's not burnt , too , I'll be alright for a while . You got your espresso , Jess ? 
 Look , Sally . I ’ Ve put just as much work into this as anybody else . 
 Well . I ’ m sorry you feel that way . 
 I need to make a deposit . 
 I ’ m depositing a check . 
 There you go . 
 Yes , please . 
 I want $ 150 . 
 Thank you , and have a nice day . 
 He's a bright boy , isn't he ? 
 Don't worry , he'll make good progress step by step . 
 Please call me or send e-mail . Could you please let me know when your organization can make a decision ? 
 I really appreciate your time and help . See you then . 
 Not too bad , thanks . And you ? 
 Oh , they are fine . They are enjoying their retirement . 
 Say hi to your family for me . 
 Can you recognize that woman , Millie ? 
 I thought so . Who ’ s that beside her ? 
 Conrad Reeves , the actor ? It can ’ t be . Let me have another look . I think you ’ re right ! Isn ’ t he her third husband ? 
 Doesn ’ t Karen Marsh look old ! 
 I ’ m sure she is . 
 That was a long time ago , wasn ’ t it ? 
 What do you think of shopping ? 
 What do you think of big department store ? 
 Did you hear the good news ? 
 I got a promotion at my job . 
 Seriously , I am so excited . 
 Thank you . 
 Really ? 
 You think so ? 
 Did you see the news today ? 
 You know about the blackout last night , right ? 
 A bunch of people went looting last night . 
 They took full advantage of the lights being out . 
 The news reported that four stores were broken into . 
 The police don't know who did it . 
 Hello . Did you enjoy the tour of our new premises ?

 There are all kinds of deposit services and also the calculations of the interest . It's specific to different accounts and different circumstances . 
 There's information on deposit or loan rates , exchange rates ... 
 Yes , it sure does . And with our new premises , we have new services . We can provide 24 - hour support for your Wealth Management . 
 I came in to see how my home inspection went . 
 I had a home inspection before , but didn ’ t really understand it . 
 The owner said that the roof had leaked , but that he got it fixed last month . 
 Are the sellers responsible for fixing the problems with the house ? 
 Did you find a lot of things wrong during the home inspection ? 
 Could you tell me where you put all the pots and pans ? 
 Where do you keep the dishes , Baker ? 
 And the forks and spoons ? 
 OK , I know . Would you please help me clean the kitchen ? 
 I still have a question to ask you . 
 How much luggage can I take for my flight ? 
 But if I have more than 55 pounds , what can I do ? 
 How about my hand carry luggage ? 
 Ms Anderson , my name is Mike . I am Division Chief of ABC Company . Welcome to Toronto . 
 A pleasure meeting you as well , the flowers are for you . 
 Finally we're on board ! 
 Are they window seats or aisle seats ? 
 Ok . But can I trade my seat with you ? I prefer the one near the window . I'm a terrible flyer . I always get airsick and can never relax until after I've landed . 
 Thanks . Where shall we put our luggage ? 
 Good idea . 
 Ok . Hope it's a pleasant trip . 
 And no hijackers . 
 Aren't you Jim Green ? 
 I believe we met at a concert last year . I'm Taylor . 
 What dances do you like ? 
 Then you must be interested in disco . 
 Oh , it's a disco . Let's dance . 
 Thank you . Now they are playing a rumba . Would you have a try ? 
 OK . Let's get something to drink . 
 Could we borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend ? 
 It is in the hotel ballroom down the street . 
 We will need it for both days . 
 The van will be driven by Mary and me . 
 Oh yeah , no problem . Would you mind if we borrowed a few of the chairs from the lunchroom . 
 What do you want for your birthday from your parents ? 
 Why don't you ask them to buy you a PC ? You will soon use it at college . 
 Hi , Martin . I ’ Ve been looking for you all morning . 
 I want to say goodbye . I ’ m leaving for America tomorrow . 
 Yes . 
 Thank you . 
 Me too . I ’ ll write to you once I get settled . But I have so much to do . You might have to wait a while . But I really will write to you . I love to write letters . I think it ’ s more meaning than the emails even than the phone call . 
 Thank you . 
 Bye . 
 Hello . I have a reservation , under the name Lee , Leo Lee . 
 It ’ s L-e-e . 
 You mean I have to pay now ? 
 I see . I guess you can tell I don ’ t travel much . 
 How are you ? 
 I'm okay . What are you doing these days ? 
 That's great . When are you starting ? 
 I made my little brother cry . 
 Gongshan Development Co . , Ltd.may I help you ? 
 May I ask who's calling , please ? 
 I'm sorry Mrs wang , but Mrs Fu is not in at the moment . 
 As suppose you reback at 10 
 Of course . 
 Ok , Mrs wang . I'll do that . 
 Management is going through a big turnover these days . With Bill's retirement , and department realignment , we have lost about 1/3 of our managerial staff . They've been dropping like flies ... 
 Actually , I don't think so . Supervisors are really important to make sure everything goes smoothly in the workplace . They are necessary for divvying up work and disciplining employees . If there is no one to keep an eye on us , no one would get any work done . You know what they say , when the cat's away , the mice play . 
 Alright ... I get your point . 
 What ? No kidding ! 
 I can't believe it ! 
 I don't know . Where did you leave it ? 
 Are you sure ? 
 Well , you should have kept an eye on it . 
 Fill in the slip , then take it to the circulation desk . They will get you what you want . 
 Sorry , the stacks are closed to undergraduate students . 
 I will if you tell me how you're so sure that we're going to come out on top . 
 After what you did , I don't know how hard Elvin's going to work to meet your deadline . 
 You've got everyone figured out , don't you ? 
 What kind of breakfast do you want ? 
 Yes , a continental one contains eggs , bacon , toast and juice . American one is the same as a continental one except the egg . 
 Is there any ticket left for tonight's concert ? 
 What a shame . Will there be the same performance tomorrow evening ? 
 That's fine . I want 2 tickets . 
 I would like to use the copy machine . 
 Do I have to pay to use the machine ? 
 How much ? 
 Am I limited to a certain number of copies ? 
 Could you show me how to use the copier ? 
 That ’ s fabulous . Thank you . 
 One second , sir , while I print out your receipt . Here you are . 
 May I ask , sir , if you enjoyed your stay ? 
 Thank you for your honesty . I assure you there will be no cockroaches next time . 
 Sure . Here you are . 
 Hi , good evening . Which kind of beer would you like ? 
 How about Yanking Beer ? It's very popular here . 
 Mike , I can't catch up with our Chinese teacher very well . 
 What is that ? 
 Will they recommend me the class that suits me ? 
 That's great . I'll tell my mother about it . 
 what about renting a restaurant and treating the employees to a nice dinner ? 
 okay , let me think . What about a party-and-movie night ? We can rearrange our reference room , invite a band to play some music , order in some food and watch a movie later . 
 well , we can ask people to make small contributions . 
 BYOB ? What's that ? 
 so we're just going to have a party where they bring their own drinks and we just give them some snacks ? I don't know how well that will go over . 
 oh , that sounds like fun ! 
 Here are some.They ' re on special sale these days . 
 Okay , Rebecca . Now you ’ Ve given me a good idea of your work and academic background , but what about you as a person ? How would you describe your key strengths ? 
 Yes , true , but how about other personal qualities ? 
 What would you say is your most positive quality ? 
 May I have your resume , please ? 
 Do you like a job in a library , working with books ? 
 Would you please mail these letters , Lucy ? 
 These two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail . Others are ordinary letters . 
 It ’ s sent to Mr . Charles . I believe he is in London . 
 Office address , please . He might be at work when they arrive . 
 Yes , it ’ s right . 
 Which tea do you prefer , black or jasmine tea ? 
 Of course , here you are . These are Black tea from Anti , Oolong tea from Guangdong , Oolong tea from Fujisan and Longing tea from Xinu . The new products are Curls Black tea , Crushed Black tea and so on . They are the best sellers in many countries . 
 Here is our price list . All the prices on the list are subject to our final confirmation . You can see the prices are reasonable . 
 Right . Could you tell us the quantity you require so that we can work out the offer ? 
 Good . We will make the offer tomorrow afternoon . Is that all right ? 
 I'm really sick of waiting for a bus . 
 But a taxi costs too much . 
 Look , the printer isn ’ t functioning well . I ’ Ve pushed the start button . It is suppose to be working now but it remains like a log . What ’ s going on ? 
 I didn ’ t pay attention to that . I will try to get the paper out . 
 I'm going to take a nap . 
 That's a good idea . 
 No , thanks . Just let me sleep until I wake up . 
 Okay . I think I'll be awake by then . 
 You mean I will smell the food cooking ? 
 I don't think I'm going to dream about anything . I'm really tired . 
 You should not have criticize your son in front of his friends . 
 I know . But at that time your blame is rubbing salt into his wounds . 
 But it is not the right time . 
 I have accumulated a wealth of practical experience in work as a chief advertisement designer . Moreover , I realized teamwork is the key to success . 
 I think building team spirit among the coworkers is very important . I believe we can accomplish a miracle if we stick together . 
 My advantage is that I have strong sense of responsibility . But I lack patience . 
 I will listen and learn more when I start my new job . I plan to become more professional in my field . 
 Thanks for your compliment , but there is still plenty more to learn . 
 Yes , I'd like to check in , please . M y name is Peter Wang . I have a reservation for three nights . 
 Yes , I'm with my wife and child . 
 Did you smell something ? It smells so great . 
 How come I never knew that ? Do they have a new baker or something ? 
 Let's go and get some cookies . I am hungry now . 
 You can taste some before you buy it . They have food tasting at the counter . 
 It's one of my favorite bakeries . 
 Hi . I'm looking for some good deals on produce . 
 Can you describe a mango to me ? 
 Do I eat the seed ? 
 What's the price of these mangoes ? 
 Tell me what they taste like . 
 Do I need to buy them ripe , or will they ripen at home ? 
 Where do mangoes come from ? 
 hi , I'm Lucas , I just moved in next door . 
 nice to meet you too . 
 thanks . Some tea would be nice . Chinese tea is great . I really like your tea set . Where did you get it ? 
 oh yeah , I saw the tea house the other day . I think I might go and have a look sometime . It's a nice neighborhood here . 
 there's a gym nearby ? That's exciting ! I really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible . I've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight . 
 that would be wonderful . Thanks ! 
 I ’ m sure you do miss that type of cooking . But can ’ t you try to get used to Western food ? 
 I suppose you ’ re right , Lee . Maybe that ’ s why so many Westerners are overweight . 
 You see , because we are often busy working , we eat too much fast food , and that food is very fattening . 
 Of course . I've loved writing since I was a very little boy . I won the first prize in a national composition contest when I was in middle school . After attending Nanjing University , I never give up writing . My works , such as Father's Tobacco Pipe , Open Air Cinema , The old City were respectively published China Youth Daily , Yangzi Evening News , and New Beijing . During the period of studying for my degrees of master and doctor , I paid more attention to developing my research ability and published several papers . The Impact of Internet in Chinese Political Participation , The Discipline of Remold , The Historical Direction of Chinese Administration Reform , Bribery Cases of Self governance in Chinese Villages are respectively published in Chinese Publish Administration , Beijing Due Xuebao , Theory and Society and Chinese Reform . I joined in Yangzi Evening News to work as a part-time journalist in 2006 . During this period , I've written a lot of comments , which improved my writing ability to a new level , I have full confidence in my writing ability , and I believe I can do the job well . 
 Yes , just once . 
 I once played truant when I was in college because I intended to organize a donation activity for the disaster-hit areas in Sichuan . 
 No , I'm proficient in both written and spoken English , but I can only carry on a simple conversation in French . 
 My mother is an English teacher in a college , so I began learning English when I could speak , and I took English as my minor subject at university . 
 Oh you ’ re exaggerating . I ’ m never really good at making hairdo . 
 Thanks for saying so , but my husband thinks otherwise . 
 Something's wrong with my computer . 
 My computer won't turn on . 
 I'm not sure I understand what you mean . 
 Is that what's stopping my computer from turning on ? 
 I had no idea . 
 I'll try it right now . 
 Some places aren't good to go.But I can show you the right bus to take . It will be no problem . 
 I have never done that myself . But I hear it is very interesting . You two should go . 
 Yes , but I'm very busy with work.And you know how it is , sometimes people don't visit the tourist sites in their own country . 
 And there's a little upside-down Dilbert on the underside . 
 My dad will love this . He's a Dilbert fan . 
 Model it for me . 
 Wow ! You look just as dorky as Dilbert ! 
 I don ’ t know . 
 Oh , I see . 
 It ’ s Saturday , a great weekend . 
 Don ’ t be angry with me . I have a bad memory . 
 What day is it on earth ? 
 May I help you , sir ? 
 Well , we have many models to choose from here.Do you have a particular brand you want ? 
 I see . And does your son have a VCR now ? 
 Does he watch a lot of movies ? 
 I would like to make a suggestion then , sir . 
 If your son wants to study film , probably he will start to collect movies himself . 
 May I suggest you consider buying him a DVD player instead ? 
 It is very similar . The technology is the same . 
 For one thing , sir , the quality of the image is usually better.That ' s because it's digital . 
 It is a little more expensive , sir.But there is one important advantage which your son might appreciate . 
 If your son starts to buy video tapes , he can't keep them very long . 
 Video tape breaks down after fifteen years.So if he collects a lot of tapes , after fifteen years they will all start to rot . 
 Yes , it is , sir . 
 This is the excellent thing about DVDs.If your son starts to collect DVDs , they will last forever . They will never rot . 
 So let me show you some of our DVD players.In my opinion , DVD is the wave of the future . 
 This is a precious opportunity for us and our company . 
 Did you have any working experience during college ? 
 What did you learn from your part-time jobs ? 
 I have a bone to pick with you . 
 You always have a chip on your shoulder . 
 How may I help you ? 
 Do you have your library card ? 
 It appears that you have late fees . 
 Yes , really . 
 You owe $ 24.50 in late fees . 
 I ’ m sorry , but until you pay it , you won ’ t be able to check out any more books . 
 Hi , Customer Service Desk . What can I do for you today , sir ? 
 Do you have your receipt with you ? 
 When did you buy it from our store ? 
 I ’ m sorry . You can ’ t return it because too much time has passed since you purchased it . In order to receive a refund , you must return merchandise to the store within 90 days of purchase . 
 Yes , I know . After 90 days , you need to call the company that manufactured the vacuum to fix it because it ’ s still under their warranty . Their phone number should be in the direction book that came with your vacuum . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 It really depends on when and how long 
 How do you do ? 
 It ’ s nice to meet you , Mr . Stevens . 
 Thank you . 
 What do the Romans do ? 
 In other words , the Romans do what everyone else does . 
 What do you mean ? 
 I envy them the sun . 
 I certainly do . 
 They always eat spaghetti and drink wine , don't they ? 
 Really ? How much does it cost to fly to Rome ? 
 Good Morning , Mrs . Schmidt ! I see you're standing on your head again . 
 I have to finish preparing a paper for my Western Civilization class . 
 Actually , I study a lot less here than I did in Taiwan ! My classes are great , though . Sociology is the perfect major for me . 
 Tell me where you live . 
 You can catch the 264 . 
 Yes , it does . 
 You can catch it on Altadena Drive . 
 Yes , it does . 
 You're welcome . 
 University Street . 
 You'll see one at the corner on your right . 
 Yes , it is . Please put your luggage on the scale . 
 Oh , can I keep this little suitcase as hand-luggage ? 
 Here's your ticket and your boarding card . 
 I want to check in now . Here is my ticket . 
 No , sir . 
 I'd like an aisle seat . I feel terrible near the window . 
 Mr . Blake ? Mr . Foster ’ s on the phone . He ’ d like to know if you can send over those training manuals ? 
 He was hoping that you could drop them off this afternoon . 
 Room service . What can I do for you ? 
 Yes . In that case , you should connect the operator and he will connect you with the one you want . 
 543210 . 
 Hello , Kith , can you and Alice come around this evening ? We prefer your coming . 
 About 7 o'clock . 
 No , not really . Just bring yourselves . We would like to your presence . 
 I'll put them in my schedule . Are there any other messages ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 How did you first meet Jack each other ? 
 And then ? 
 Then he sent you to your home ? 
 It's a romantic meeting . I can say that a hero saves a beauty . 
 He is so humorous . 
 That's fate . 
 Maybe this is God's will . 
 It's simple . You can use call transfer . 
 Sure . You know , we spend most of our time at home or in the office every day , so I receive handset calls with the hand-free telephone , so I need pay little for receiving calls . 
 Call transfer has many other advantages . When I am in places where network can't cover , such as the high building , I also use call transfer function , which transfers my calls to the hand-free telephone and I will not miss any call . 
 In hospitals or on planes , handsets will interfere with some equip-ment , so we must close our handsets . If you set call transfer , the problem will be solved . 
 It leaves in 20 minutes . 
 Can you pick me up from the airport ? 
 For 3 days $ 300 , for 7 days $ 600 . 
 Okay . I'll write up the paperwork . 
 No , I don ’ t want to eat anything . 
 I ’ m down in spirits . 
 My manager jumped on me for my mistake today . 
 I think I'm too clumsy . I can do nothing well . 
 But I doubt myself . 
 I'm worrying that she may be lost . 
 After all , she is a five-year-old kid . 
 do you remember where you were for the terrorist attacks on 9-11 ? 
 I was at home with my parents in New York City . 
 I didn't see the crash itself , but I did see the smoke and everything afterwards from my parents ' apartment building . 
 no , we decided to stay in our apartment . With all the buses out of service and the underground trains at a halt , many people had no choice but to walk home . It was utter chaos . 
 yes , my uncle's firm had an office in one of the towers . 
 unfortunately , he wasn't able to evacuate in time . He ended up dying in the tower . 
 it was . The hijackers didn't have any respect for human life not even their own . 
 I just got a call from Mrs . Fitzgerald . See what your Willie has just done . 
 Because he takes after you , he's got into trouble again . 
 That was last time . This time it's worse . 
 Well , he was playing baseball with some friends ... 
 True , but that's not all . The ball went through the window and hit the vase she has in her front window ... 
 And then , ricocheted off her fish bowl . Mrs . Fitzgerald at the last minute dived and saved her fish . 
 Stop interrupting me . Finally , the ball flew through the air and knocked out Willie's school principal , who was having a cup of coffee with Mrs . Fitzgerald . 
 If I can improve my vertical jump a few more inches , I think beach volleyball might be my ticket . 
 It's a beautiful sport , isn't it ? 
 OK , OK . Enough already . We'd better hustle . The contest starts in five minutes . 
 Can't it wait ? She's still angry that we sent e-mail wedding invitations . 
 I know . And they're spending enough on the plane tickets to Texas ! 
 OK . 
 Yeah . It is not easy for them to find another job . 
 It is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . What do you think ? Do you want to quit your job ? 
 I need to find the cereal aisle . 
 Where is that at ? 
 I think I can find that . 
 Actually , I do need to find the dishwashing detergent . 
 I thought it was over there . 
 I really appreciate all your help . 
 Hi . I want to place an order , please . 
 Pick - up . 
 I have a menu from your restaurant . I ’ ll order using the number of each meal from your menu . 
 I ’ d like to order number 17 , no . 23 and no . 24 . 
 Medium , please . 
 I ’ ll be there in about an hour . 
 how did you do on your BELTS exam ? 
 that's excellent ! Have you received your conditional offers yet ? 
 do you know where the visa office is ? 
 it's just near the Dong Si Shi Tiao subway stop . 
 have you ever gone abroad before ? 
 have you ever been denied a visa before ? 
 that's good . Are you planning on immigrating to another country ? 
 that's exactly what the visa officers want to hear . Do you have enough money for tuition and room and board ? 
 I think you have a very good chance of getting a visa . I can help you prepare for the visa interview if you want . 
 I want to buy some jewellery . 
 I should like to look at some bracelets . 
 Jade ones . 
 What's the price for this one ? 
 How about seven hundred yuan ? 
 OK . I'll take it . 
 It could be . There are floods in this country almost every year , but in recent years they have been more widespread and more frequent . 
 The summers are hotter . The last three summers have been the hottest for the past 200 years . There have also been stronger winds . 
 I think you ’ re right . Climate change naturally over time , but I think that human activities are speeding up the change . I wish that government would join together and try to resolve the problem . 
 Could you tell me a little about the organization ? For example , how big is your workforce here ? 
 I see . And how about the working hours ? 
 Well I am used to that , Mr . Parsons , so that ’ s not really a shock for me . 
 And when do you need to fill the vacancy , Mr . Parsons ? 
 That sounds ideal . 
 Please sit down and make yourself at home . Please don ’ t stand on ceremony . 
 I ’ m glad that you like it . This is only the first time that I made it . 
 Sure , we call it doubt . 
 How should I know ? It's not my responsibility . 
 Not really ! 
 Maybe , but I think they are just for kids . 
 Maybe they don ’ t agree with my taste . 
 Thank you.Just put it on the table . 
 En , would you please give me some bread please ? I am hungry now . 
 Could I pay for my parking ticket ? 
 Here's my ticket right here . 
 I don't have it . 
 I don't understand why I can't just pay you . 
 I get it now . 
 Will my record be cleared after I pay the fine ? 
 After I am accepted for unemployment benefits , what will happen next ? 
 What will that tell me ? 
 Are there any other forms that I need to fill out ? 
 What information will I need to provide on that form ? 
 Are there any other questions on the form ? 
 Excuse me , I ’ d like to apply for a library card . 
 What sort of proof do you need ? 
 I ’ m a student from out of state , so I don ’ t have a local driver ’ s license . 
 The phone bill ’ s in my name . 
 How long will it take to get the regular one ? 
 Okay.Thanks for your help . 
 This is Room 603 . I'm afraid that the heating system doesn't work . It's very cold here . 
 Yes . I have switched it on for a long time . The room is still very cold . 
 I prefer not to move first . 
 Yes , please . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , goodbye and keep in touch . 
 Yes , miss . What was the problem with your purchase ? 
 Would you like to have them altered ? Or would you like a different size ? 
 I'm sorry , but this was on sale , so I can only give you store credit . 
 Of course ... here you are . I'm sorry the pajamas didn't work out for you . 
 It's delicious . 
 Was it quite special ? 
 Did you hurry back to the bedroom ? 
 Oh , your classmates took you in . 
 I want to get on the bus already . 
 It was supposed to be here thirty minutes ago . 
 I need to get to work , so it better . 
 I agree , it's just never on time . 
 I also hate having to stand at a bus stop in all kinds of weather . 
 We need to get a car . 
 Gosh ! The water faucet is dripping badly again . 
 I know . I ’ Ve got to get it fixed ASAP . 
 I wish I could , but I ’ Ve got to go now . I have an appointment in 20 minutes . 
 Oh , by the way , could you give me a ride ? My car is still in the garage . 
 Paul failed again . 
 How can we help him ? 
 Are you interested in history ? 
 I love history , but I ’ Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened . 
 Some people say that history repeats itself . 
 The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same . 
 Vince . We're both busy , so I'm not going to beat around the bush . I need a raise . 
 Bull . I're done my research . I know you still control more than 65 percent of invoking options . 
 That doesn't matter . I want at least 4 percent . 
 I can ’ t find the book I want . 
 I checked it already . 
 It wasn ’ t there . 
 Will you be getting another copy ? 
 Could you reserve a copy for me ? 
 That ’ s great . Thanks a lot . 
 Let's see . From here , you have to take the 278bus . 
 You should get off at the first Shi Da stop . 
 You're new at this , huh ? 
 No , it's quite simple . When you get on , just ask the bus driver when to pay the fare and where you want to get off . 
 Only 15 NT per section . Oh look , that is your bus . 
 Don't mention it . 
 Well , I think you look very pretty in your polka dot purple dress with your hair piled at the rear . That makes you very graceful and mysterious . 
 Remember to match it with your glittering star-shaped necklace . Very attractive on formal occasions . 
 Sure , more elegant and taller . 
 If I were your date , I would be so charmed by you . 
 Do you have sport shirts for ladies ? 
 I think the red one fits me well . Can I try it on ? 
 Where is the fitting room ? 
 Driver , bring me to the station . 
 Can you please speed up ? I am catching the train . 
 Oh , my god . 
 Yes , my engine warning light is on . 
 Just since today . 
 It runs fine . 
 Okay . 
 Okay . 
 No , you can give a call when you have done checking . 
 Come in , please . 
 Good morning , please make yourself comfortable . 
 Your name and examination number , please . 
 Pardon ? 
 Yes , Mr . Du , when were you born ? 
 Where do you live ? 
 Can you leave me your phone number ? 
 Good afternoon . Is this the Roley Hotel ? 
 Yes . I ’ m calling from Westwood and Westwood Attorneys . I need to make a reservation for Mr . Alex Brent . 
 Welcome to our International Business Counter . How can I help ? 
 Not a problem . Could you tell me you L / C number , please ? 
 OK , just checking for you ... yes , they have arrived . How would you like me to handle them ? 
 That's fine . I'll get on with that for you right now . 
 I just broke up with a girl . Why didn't she understand that I loved her ? 
 I don't know . She always said I didn't love her , but I did . 
 I have asked for a talk again , but she refused and said she wanted to be quiet . 
 Hello , Mr . Black , how are you ? 
 Very well , thank you . It's nice to meet you again . I am awfully sorry for not being able to meet you at the airport , as I was busy yesterday . I do hope you had a very enjoyable trip from New York . 
 How are you getting along with your business ? 
 I hope we can do more business together . Though we are satisfied with our past trade record , there are still possibilities for more business . In the meantime , let's discuss other spheres of cooperation , such as investment , technology transfer and technical assistance . 
 Dad , it's raining outside . 
 All right , all right , I will go swimming with Peter this afternoon . 
 Excuse me , where am I on this map ? 
 Which bus should I take to railway station ? 
 Where am I supposed to change ? 
 Happy Thanksgiving ! 
 Let's have pumpkin pie . 
 What are we going to eat for dinner ? 
 I didn't plan on cooking tonight . 
 I don't know what to make . 
 I've been craving chicken and potatoes . 
 Are you going to cook it tonight ? 
 Okay , I guess I'll cook . 
 Well , how was your honeymoon ? 
 Peak periods always entail hours of queuing . At least you got a nice tan though ! 
 My friends and I just got back from Bali . 
 Yes , we were lucky . My friend's father owns a resort on one of the islands , so we were able to stay for free . 
 I took a few diving classes , but I didn't really like it , so I did snorkeling instead ! 
 I've got quite a few pictures of all different kinds of fish . I'll show them to you next time I see you . 
 We're planning on going skiing in Switzerland . Do you ski ? 
 Would you like to go skiing with us for christmas ? 
 It is Europe's spotless land of lakes and mountains ! Let me know as soon as you can so we can get a discount . 
 I'm not sure if I can , but I'll try . 
 What's the specialty of the house ? 
 I like fish . Please bring me an order of that . 
 Apple pie , please . 
 Make it two . 
 Yes , I did , I thought it was a failure . 
 Well , maybe so . But I still think everyone has their rights of their own opinion . 
 Would you like to rent the house ? 
 I can lend some to you . 
 I'm sorry I'm late . 
 Honey , where did you buy this skirt ? 
 Nothing . I am just checking . 
 Well , you'd better sit down for this . It has been terminal lung cancer . 
 We ’ ll try our best , but you'd better prepare for the worst . 
 I have said that we will try our best . You can trust us . But you know her situation . 
 About half a year . 
 Yes . Where would you like to go ? 
 Of course . 
 Well . That depends on traffic , you know . It's pretty heavy this afternoon . 
 I'll try . Where exactly is your friend waiting ? 
 You've got it . 
 Here we are , Central Park ! 
 Well , it's $ 12 . 
 Thank you . 
 All this is thanks to the efforts of my superiors and colleagues . 
 I just did what I should have done . 
 Thank you for your compliments . I will try even harder to repay the company and your support . 
 Thanks for saying so . 
 It says on the bottle here that you can have two refills . 
 Alright . I'm sorry , Miss . According to our file , this prescription has already been refilled twice . 
 Well , it looks like you have.You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription . 
 I'm sorry , Miss . We can't do it . We must follow the prescription.And this prescription has run out . 
 Miss , I understand your problem.But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription.It ' s the law . I can't do anything about it.We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . Never . 
 A prescription must be valid . It cannot be an expired prescription . I'm sorry , Miss . It's the law.You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you . 
 Miss , I just can't help you on this . I'm a pharmacist , not a doctor . And there are other customers I need to help now . I know it is frustrating when this happens.But there is nothing I can do about it . I'm sorry . 
 Maybe that's true . I don't know.But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too . 
 What seems to be the problem ? 
 What is bothering you ? 
 Would you like someone to walk you over to the Student Health Center ? 
 Do you need a ride home ? 
 OK , then , hope you feel better soon . Check your e-mail for missed assignments . 
 I was doing quite well at college . I completed my MBA degree in international trade with first-class honors . 
 I selected my college because it had an excellent academic reputation . 
 My favorite recreation is cooking . I learned to cook Chinese dishes and western style dishes as well . It keeps me busy and makes me happy . 
 Great ! I'd love to get a little better discount than 6 % , but if your company provides the insurance , that will save us a few bucks ... 
 No ... We shouldn't have any problem with that . I know we talked about a possibility for 90 days , but we won't be needing that after your discounted price . 
 Great ! 
 Yes , but do you have a prescription with you ? 
 I'm afraid you can't buy any medicine without a prescription from a doctor . 
 Then you can buy Aspirin . 
 Yes , here this is . 
 Thank you and take care . 
 May I see your passbook . 
 This is a sizable sum . Is there any reason you are closing your account with us Mr . Lee ? 
 I see . Well for this amount I will have to get my manager ’ s approval . 
 Thank you . This should only be a few minutes . If you would like , there is coffee by those sofas over there . 
 Mmm . Nice and crunchy . And they leave a space uncovered for you to hold ... 
 Or just stuff the whole thing in your mouth at once ! 
 Whatever . Give me another pack . 
 What do you do for a living ? 
 Really ? Do you like it ? 
 I ’ m a bus driver . 
 No , I don ’ t really like it . It ’ s boring . 
 Why ? 
 I'm very sorry for that , but I sent you several messages to explain , my mom was seriously ill , and I had to look afer her . 
 That girl was my cousin . 
 I didn't take my cellphone with me at that time . 
 I know you don't hear me right know , please calm down . Anyway , I don't wanna part . I'll drop by tomorrow . 
 Good morning . How are you ? 
 Oh ? What are you worried about ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . Why do you think so ? 
 How do you sleep ? 
 Do you find it difficult to get to sleep , or do you wake up early ? 
 Are you worried about anything ? 
 I see . please take off your shirt and lie down on the couch . 
 Well , there's nothing very much wrong with you , I'm glad to say.You ' re working too hard and worrying too much.Do you take much exercise ? 
 I can , but I'm not going to . You don't need medicine . You need advice . Don't work so hard . Too much work is bad for you . Don't worry about your work.It ' s silly to worry . Take regular exercise . 
 Then get an easier one , even if you earn less money . Which would you rather have , health or wealth ? 
 Come and see me again in a month's time . I think you'll be a different man ! 
 How do you like this waltz ? 
 May I ask you for a dance ? 
 You are doing the waltz wonderfully well . 
 Mr . Emory ? I ’ d appreciate it if you would look over these letters before you leave today . 
 Thank you , sir . I ’ ll leave them here . If there are no problems , I ’ ll mail them out this afternoon . 
 Hello , this is Mr . Simon . May I help you ? 
 Sorry , I can't give you an immediate answer on the matter . It's pending now . 
 In about 3 to 4 days . 
 Do you really enjoy such dangerous sports ? 
 You are a real fan of extreme sports . 
 Hello , Ms . Murphy ? 
 It ’ s John Anderson . I ’ m afraid I ’ m going to be out sick today . I ’ Ve got a nasty cold . I hope you don ’ t mind , ma ’ am . 
 Ange , can your dog do any tricks yet ? 
 Really ? Does he chase balls ? 
 This can't be the same dog . He's so clean , he shines . 
 He's really cute . His bowl even has his name on it . 
 I'm sorry , it was too cold , and my car couldn't start . I had one to the garage with the heater . I tried to call you , but you couldn't get connection . 
 Yes , your number is out of service . 
 So I couldn't get through . 
 Well , the only thing you can do is pay the fee to recover your service . 
 Take your pick , Julie . 
 Next week , it ’ s going to be quite a shock for him ! 
 You bet . I wouldn ’ t miss it ! 
 Nope . Our company is private-owned and its profit is the biggest issue . We don't think that further study has anything to do with our development and profit-making . 
 Nope . We just hope our employees will make profit for us . 
 Yes , we had a meting about it yesterday afternoon . 
 We decided that we could agree to your price , but we are a bit worried about the slow delivery . 
 Yes , but we hope that the wool could reach us as soon as possible . 
 Good , if you agree we'll draft the agreement right away and sign it then . 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 What kind of oil do you want ? 
 No problem . 
 No , thanks . My husband said , We'd like to pay now . 
 What ? Where does that five come from ? 
 But I only have 900 in cash here . Can you let it go for 900 yuan ? 
 My husband said he had a credit card . Do you accept credit card ? 
 Great . Here it is . 
 Yes , please . Thank you very much . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Who ? 
 Yeah , she is so charming . I like her , too . 
 What's the movie about ? 
 Isn't it silly to see a movie that you know nothing about ? 
 Yeah , she is great . I also admire her for her concern about society . 
 What's the running speed of the machine ? 
 And what's the maximum output ? 
 Good afternoon . I believe that this house is for sale . 
 May I have a look at it please ? 
 How long have you lived here ? 
 Twenty years ! That's a long time . 
 Then why do you want to sell it ? 
 How much does this house cost ? 
 That's a lot of money ! 
 Well , I like the house , but I can't decide yet . My wife must see it first . 
 There's been a dramatic change in the weather pattern . 
 It has been delayed . 
 No , but probably until there is a break in the storm . 
 I think it's smart to stay close to the gate so we can hear the updates . 
 Fancy seeing you here 。 Lily . 
 How's everything going ? 
 Hey Michelle , jump in quick . It's pouring out there ! 
 Yes , he told me . We need to pick him up at his hotel and then go to the conference . 
 Ah thank you ! I'm very excited . We were going to get married next year , but then we decided to get married on holiday instead . It was wonderful . 
 I know what you mean . I think Shanghai is getting more and more expensive , don't you ? 
 Definitely . Oh , there's Mr . Campbell . Driver , can you stop here please ? 
 I know the Chinese teachers had their first festival in 1985 . 
 What will you do on Teachers ' Day ? 
 I intend to invite him to dinner . 
 I'm sorry , but I've got an important job to do . 
 How about the Japanese ones ? 
 Oh , I see . I'll show you some . 
 What did you have in mind ? 
 I just know I want to get out of the mindless gift trap . 
 I want to give a gift that is really meaningful . 
 Or what only we are able to give them . 
 Good morning , sweetie . You finally got up . 
 Did you stay up late last night ? 
 Hey , Trev ! How did the shopping go ? 
 Trev , are you OK ? 
 Aren't you lucky . The vintage-clock guy is driving a hard bargain . So I have nothing . 
 Do you two know each other ? 
 How may I help you ? 
 What can I do for you ? 
 What is your trial about ? 
 I ’ d be glad to help . 
 My rate is $ 150 an hour . 
 I don ’ t know what to tell you . 
 Did you work in a charity organization ? 
 In what way did those social activities have impact on your mind ? 
 Are you still busy today ? 
 Fine , honey . Rome couldn't be built with in one day . 
 Take care , honey . I am always expecting you . 
 I wonder Why . 
 That was my fault . I'm sorry . 
 I don't see any damage . 
 I don't see anything wrong with it . 
 That's not my fault . 
 I'll take care of everything . I just need your phone number and insurance . 
 Here you go . 
 That's a good idea.What ' s on ? 
 What's it about ? 
 Do you want to try the new coffee here ? 
 Have you seen the news today ? 
 Did you know there was a blackout last night ? 
 Well , some people decided to loot last night . 
 They took advantage of the blackout . 
 Yes , apparently four stores were broken into . 
 There was no evidence of who did it . 
 What's the matter with you , Paul ? 
 Looks like it.You need to drink a lot of water and take a good rest . 
 I've heard of ground-level ozone but can you explain what it is exactly ? 
 Sorry ? What does VOC stand for ? 
 So , what damage does ozone do to the environment ? 
 I don't want to do the damn dishes . 
 Good Morning . What can I do for you ? 
 Do you have a registration card ? 
 Then you need to register as a new patient . Can I have a look at you ID card ? I need your name , age , occupation , address and contacting number . 
 Thanks . Which kind of medicine do you prefer , western medicine or traditional Chinese medicine ? 
 All right . Yes , he does . The registration fee is 7 yuan , please . 
 Watch your language . 
 I'd like to buy a skirt . 
 I like one with flowers on its brim . 
 It seems too short . 
 It looks nice . How much is it ? 
 Is there any cheaper one ? 
 I think I'd better take that one you showed me just now . It is better than this one although this one is cheaper . 
 Here is the money . 
 No , thanks . 
 I said , " Do you want me to help you ? " 
 OK . Would you like me to get you a cab ? 
 These shoes are great ! What is the price of this ? 
 That's too much ! 
 No , I was out . Was it worth watching ? 
 Oh , really ? So , Spain is through to the next round ? 
 Do you have any other questions ? 
 Which fees ? 
 You will be required to pay a small fee for every time you overdraft . 
 You'll have to pay $ 25 every time you overdraft . 
 It should stop you from overdrafting . 
 Can I help you with anything else ? 
 Which do you like better , orange or lemon ? 
 Why ? 
 I need to find somewhere to park . 
 I need to find a space on campus . 
 Where is the parking structure at ? 
 Do you know if the parking structure is full or not ? 
 How long ago was that ? 
 Do you think it'll be full now ? 
 Excuse me , are you Miss Green ? 
 May I introduce myself ? 
 I ’ m a new student in the school . My name ’ s John . 
 It ’ s a pleasure to meet you , Miss Green . 
 I'm afraid you can ’ t . 
 Just a moment . Let me find out . Our manager Wil be here in a minute . So will you speak to him ? 
 Can you tell me what happened here ? 
 Did you see the car before it hit you ? 
 Which lane were you in ? 
 What was your speed then ? 
 Which direction were you coming from ? And which direction were you going ? 
 OK , please move your vehicle off to the side of the road . We will check on it . Do you feel like you need an ambulance , Miss ? 
 No problem , Miss . 
 Well you have to try Peking duck . 
 Ok , you could try the Peking wonton then . 
 Actually , I know a great restaurant in Dongcheng . 
 I want take shell on a date , but I don ’ t have much money . 
 She likes to golf , dance and eat foreign food . 
 Well , I really like being with her . 
 Dutch , where is that ? 
 Oh , I wonder if she ’ ll go for that . 
 I've got a suit , a woolen sweater and a white shirt to wash . 
 That's OK . But that must be costly . 
 Oh , my wife just threw them into the washer . 
 I see . The woolen sweater shrunk in the wash . 
 Oh , thanks . You know , I know little about this , so please tell me something that I should pay more attention to when I do washing . 
 I'll keep that in mind . And how much is it altogether ? 
 Didn't you say your friend was American ? Where is she going on her honeymoon ? 
 What a coincidence ! These pajamas would be perfect to take along on the honeymoon ! 
 Bob , can I talk to you for a minute ? There have been some developments for the Stewart case that I really need to talk to you about . 
 Well , I'm afraid there is . I have some bad news for you about the results of the forensic tests ... there won't be any results . 
 I hate to tell you this , but it seems that every shred of evidence that would help us to convict were destroyed in a laboratory fire . There's nothing left . I'm so sorry ... 
 There's nothing that can be done . Everything is gone . I wish I could tell you differently , but what has happened has happened . We will just have to figure out a way to move on . 
 It's raining cats and dogs . 
 Sorry , I can ’ t . 
 I ’ d like to . But I ’ m afraid I can ’ t . 
 That ’ s sounds great . 
 No . I ’ d better not . 
 Because I don ’ t think my husband would like it . Thank you for inviting me anyway . 
 Not bad . Everything goes well . 
 You tell me . 
 You never cook . I always do . 
 Oh please , you need to cook tonight . 
 It was a hard day . Can you just do this for me tonight ? 
 I'm going to go rest for a little bit . 
 Thanks . 
 Right over there . 
 I loved it . I'll take it . 
 Here you go ? 
 No I don't . 
 Not today . Thanks though . 
 Sure . 
 Yeah . I was looking at some of your pants , but they are all a bit too long . Do you have alteration services here ? 
 Great . Thanks for your help . 
 Lots of elderly people want peace and quiet in their old age , but young people want an unconstrained life . 
 What if old people are in poor health and need to be looked after ? 
 When I ’ m old , I ’ ll also be like that . 
 I know that's what I must do . 
 What is it ? 
 Really ? That's something unexpected . You see , all our exports are strictly inspected before shipment . The goods were in perfect condition when they left the port . 
 Our goods are well-examined before shipment . I'm afraid the losses must have occurred on route . 
 We will check with the parties concerned right away . 
 yeah , and most excitingly , I met the girl living under me today . She's really nice . 
 yeah , and most importantly , she's single ! Man , I could tell from the moment I saw her , she's the girl of my dreams ! 
 I don't know . I am not really worried about that . I don't wanna lose before even starting . Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her . 
 not yet . But I am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime . I know some good restaurants nearby . 
 you bet . Now that you mentioned it , I think I'll call her now and see if she is available tonight . 
 thanks ! 
 Could you be a little more specific , sir ? 
 I understand . Now , you're saying that you've already used up all your amenities ? 
 So , what's the problem ? 
 You want some souvenirs ! 
 But , sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items . 
 I understand , sir . I'll call housekeeping . You'll have your souvenirs shortly . 
 I'm sorry , I overslept . 
 Neither.The game ended in two all . 
 But the Brazilian is tougher . 
 I don't know . I'll have to ask my host mom . 
 But I still have to tell her . 
 Tell you what , give me your phone number . 
 Got it . I'll call you later tonight and we can talk about what to do on Saturday . 
 I'm very touched , and I can't help bursting into tears at the wedding . 
 Mary looks so beautiful in the wedding gown , and I record the moment that I was bride . 
 Judy , Why are you so interested in her ? 
 He's terribly handsome . 
 Why are you so bitter ? No one tells worse joke than you . 
 Look , Jimmy's report came today . 
 He's in the third grade Sam ! You see under each subject that he is being taught in school , he receives a mark from one to three . A one means his achievement or work is excellent . Here in Science for example he got a two , which means its satisfactory . 
 He got a three here which means it's unsatisfactory . We should work on that with him . 
 Hi , where can I find a cheap cashmere sweater ? 
 Great idea ! 
 Thank you so much . 
 I like this shirt.How much is it ? 
 Wow , that's sheer robbery.Shall I make an offer ? 
 Good evening . Where have you come from ? 
 May I have your passport and form I - 94 , please ? 
 What's the nature of your visit ? Business or pleasure ? 
 How long are you going to stay in the United States ? 
 What is your occupation ? 
 Do you have a return ticket ? 
 That's fine . Thanks . Enjoy your trip . 
 Hey , Leo . How come you look so terrible ? What ’ s going ’ on ? 
 How gross ! I can ’ t handle people like that . Does he at least give you a hand around the house ? 
 Man , what a freeloader . You better do something quick or he ’ ll never hit the road . After all , he ’ s got it made in the shade here . 
 Now , don ’ t go losing your temper . If you tolerated all you can , just kick him out ... but do it with gloves . I know ! Tell him a white lie like you ’ re getting the house fumigated ! 
 May I help you find something , sir ? 
 We have all shapes , sizes , qualities and price ranges , do you know about the four Cs of picking a diamond ? 
 You've got it . Tell me a little bit about what you might be wanted . 
 You have good taste . Let my show you what I have . 
 I ’ m looking for a job . Are you hiring ? 
 Superintendent . 
 Do you have any other positions available ? 
 What is it ? 
 Can I apply for it right now ? 
 Are you watching another news report about the war ? 
 How did this war start ? 
 Politicians from both sides sound increasingly belligerent . Neither side wants to compromise . 
 What do you think will happen ? 
 It would be much simpler and cheaper if they negotiated first . 
 Are you having a meeting ? 
 I understand . 
 I couldn't sleep well recently . 
 I always drink too much wine in the evening . 
 Yes , you are right . 
 Many thanks for your advice . 
 I will be available on Monday or Tuesday . Choose which day is best for you . 
 Good . Can you come in the morning or would afternoon be best ? 
 Great ! When I check with the others , I will send you an exact time . When you come , be prepared to do your presentation . 
 Who would you like to see there ? Just the sub-committee or should we ask the whole committee ? 
 That will probably be best . Do you need help with directions ? 
 OK . We will e-mail you all the information you need tomorrow . Have a good day ! 
 I like it , but there is one problem . 
 The faucet in the kitchen is leaking . 
 That leak is a problem for my water bill . 
 The leak must be fixed . 
 I will not rent the apartment with that leaking faucet . 
 Thanks for understanding . 
 I am terribly sorry . You didn't come to reconfirm recently.You should have come to pick up your ticket three days ago since it's an international flight , any reservation without reconfirmation within 72 hours will be cancelled . 
 Here is the draft contract , Mr . Brown . Let's discuss the clauses to see if we agree on all of them . Then I will make out an original of the contract . After that , what's left is to fill out the contract and sign our names . 
 The contract is to be written in Chinese and English . Both languages are equally effective . 
 Thank you . 
 That's a good idea . 
 Agreed . 
 I understand your position . 
 What happened to you last night ? You didn ’ t show up . 
 I ’ m so sorry to hear that . 
 Help yourself . 
 Well , we've got some great mangoes on sale . 
 Well , it's a fruit with a big seed in it . 
 No . Peel the skin with a sharp knife , and throw out the seed . 
 Well , they're on sale today for only $ 1 each . 
 They usually taste sweet , but they remind me of an orange . 
 You can buy them either ripe or unripe . Unripe ones are hard . 
 The ones that are on sale are from Central America . 
 I've got a terrible pain in my stomach , Doctor . 
 It started yesterday . I didn't eat any supper . 
 I think so . I feel very hot . 
 I've got an awful headache , too , and my throat hurts . 
 Is it serious ? 
 How often must I take it ? 
 Thank you , Doctor . 
 no , I was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . How about you ? 
 I'm absolutely useless at cooking ! 
 I know they aren't good for me , but they are cheap , convenient , and fairly tasty . 
 yeah , why not . Do you have all the ingredients ? 
 what do we do first ? 
 ok . Should I heat the wok ? 
 what about the chicken ? 
 how about the rice ? 
 white rice , please . None of that healthy brown stuff for me ! 
 We need to work is because we need money to live . We need money for food and clothes and to pay for house . We need money for many different things , and only when we work , we can earn money . And work can also help us feel that we are useful . 
 Yes , it is really hard . But you must believe that you will find a suitable job finally . When you work , you can accumulate a lot of experience . Besides , you need to learn a lot of things while you are working . 
 But whether you like it or not , there ’ s a trend of life-long study to make sure that we can keep ourselves up with the high developing society . And you need to accept this concept positively . 
 You have no choice , so you'd better adjust your thoughts to be ready to learn anything at any time . 
 You ’ d better change it . It ’ s ugly . 
 It ’ s really elegant and it fits you really well . 
 We'd like to visit the factory . Can you show me the way ? 
 How many shifts are there in your factory ? 
 What about your company's QC management ? 
 Where are the workers from ? From the villages nearby ? 
 It sounds nice . We can't wait to visiting the factory . 
 Sure , Carolyn . I'm happy to help you.What kinds of things do you need right now ? 
 Well , as for Albert , he should go to an office supply store.There ' s a very good one called Office Depot . They have everything he will need.And their prices are good too . It's very convey 
 Sure , it's spelled Office and then D - E - P - O - T.It ' s in the Yellow Pages . 
 And as for the kitchen things , do you want very high quality ? 
 I mean , do you want the best quality , or do you want good prices ? 
 Then I suggest you go to K-Mart or Wal-Mart . 
 They are very large , discount department stores.That means their prices are very good.And you can find everything you need for the kitchen or bathroom . 
 Yes , everything.They don't have the most expensive brands , but their quality is usually decent.The main thing is , they have good prices , and they are very convenient . 
 I have never shopped there , but I think Price Club is a kind of membership store . 
 That means you have to pay a membership fee to shop there . I have heard they have very good prices on electronics . 
 Yes . Like stereos and televisions . 
 I'm not sure.But if you are only going to stay a year , I don't think Price Club is good to join.They have great deals occasionally.They are very good for people who like to buy new things all 
 I know how it is . Moving is very troublesome . 
 Do you offer a safety deposit box rental service here ? 
 I'd like to put some valuables inside , you know , documents and jewellery , things like that . 
 What rental do you offer ? 
 I'll have to ask my wife how long she'll need it for as it is mainly for her belongings . I'll come back after we have discussed it . Thanks for your help . 
 I'm going to New York to visit my sister . She is in art school . I've never been to New York before . I'm kind of scared . 
 Well , I know a lot of people have guns there . I think maybe it isn't too safe . 
 Yes , I'm not really scared . Maybe only a little . 
 I want to see the museums , and I want to shop a lot . 
 Hmm . I hope not . 
 I like playing chess . 
 I'm afraid not . 
 Oh , yes . I like playing basketball . 
 Because I like the feeling of cooperating with others . 
 No problem . Who is it ? Anyone I know ? 
 That name doesn't ring a bell . But tell me more . 
 Well , I'll have to personally thank him by making him my famous chocolate cake . 
 Absolutely ! Bob and his whole family are welcome here any time ! 
 Yes . Look , it is on my desk . 
 Not at all . It ’ s a piece of cake . 
 Yes . It ’ s easy and convenient to use a computer . But it takes a long time to really master it . 
 Don't worry , you'll find a way . 
 How can you live without job in the future ? 
 You really should stop smoking , you know . 
 How many cigarettes do you smoke a day ? 
 Wow . You ’ re really a heavy smoker . 
 He died of lung cancer , right ? 
 How can I get my driver's license ? 
 I have yet to take my driving test . 
 When can I take my test ? 
 I would like to make one right now . 
 That would be great . 
 If I could do it in the morning , then that would be good . 
 Could you please tell me how I can go job-hunting in the web ? 
 How should I contact them ? 
 Can I get a quick reply from the sites ?

 I can do that . Is there a special way you want them washed ? 
 Do you have a lot of clothes that need to be washed ? 
 My load isn't that big . 
 I can do this for you . Don't worry . 
 Don't mention it . 
 I didn't get it yet . 
 I have no idea where to get it from . 
 Well then , where do I get it ? 
 I didn't know that . 
 I appreciate you telling me . 
 I'll make sure to get it tomorrow . 
 I have a question . 
 Why do people like all this fancy , expensive underwear ? 
 I'm just curious . I think women are beautiful without this stuff . 
 Hey Jimmy . Let's go workout later today . 
 How about at 3:30 ? 
 Hey . I just played basketball earlier , so my legs are a little sore . Let's work out on arms and stomach today .

 Are you going somewhere ? 
 Really ? Well you ’ ll have to get there before 6pm because they close early today . 
 Yeah and remember if you buy something you mustn ’ t carry it home otherwise your back will get worse . 
 Yes , but it ’ s not free , you have to pay . 
 Which film shall we see ? 
 Yes , I'd love to.Here is a good one , Mozart and Beethoven.It ' s on the Festival Hall.Shall we go there ? 
 No , I'm not hungry . 
 Excuse me . 
 I'm in a hurry . How long will it take ? 
 Do you think the traffic will be heavy ? 
 That's a relief . 
 Hello , Marry , this is Lin Wang , calling from network . 
 May i speak to David please ? 
 Oh , sorry , David Richton . 
 Thank you . 
 You hurt Ben's feelings . 
 That is the most boring , typical gift in the world ! 
 That's not exactly a conversation piece . It's so plain . 
 The diagonal black and red stripes are really conservative though ... 
 A fly-away tie ! What a riot ! 
 Yeah . I am so excited that Obama won . 
 That man just made history . 
 I sure did ! What about you ? 
 I am still in shock to know that he was elected . 
 I pray that he actually makes things better in this country . 
 I know he will , too . 
 If I want , I can protect myself by paying through an escrow account , which holds the money until I receive the item . 
 eBay also offers free insurance . You can get a refund of up to $ 200 if you're not satisfied with your purchase . 
 How much can I change 100 dollars for ? 
 How much will it be in Chinese currency ? 
 Excuse me , I'm looking for the airport bus stop . Do you know where it is ? 
 When does the bus come ? 
 How about the next one ? 
 Isn't there an earlier one ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Hey , what sort of drinks do you want ? Gatorade or water ? 
 Yes , that ’ s the exact thing we need . One for each . 
 We should choose from the backups . 
 That ’ s why we should learn to protect ourselves . Otherwise , the game is not worth the candle . 
 Yes , I played shooting guard , I like shooting and you ’ ll play inside , OK ? 
 Wow , the cheer-section is coming . The music is so fantastic . 
 Well , you should ask your friend . You know I ’ m not the boss . Just kidding . 
 Yeah , what ’ s up ? 
 I also have a doubt . Oh , kill me softly , she is May . 
 Yes . My wife and I are interested in renting a house for the summer . 
 Furnished . 
 No , not all summer . Just for six weeks . 
 My holiday is only six weeks , but I think my brother and his family would take it for the other two weeks . Is the house in good condition ? 
 What did you learn at the workshop you went to yesterday ? Do you think it was worth the investment to go ? 
 The workshop was only one afternoon long , do you really think you can learn that much in only a couple of hours ? 
 Sounds like you really learned a lot . 
 Have you heard my good news ? 
 I got a promotion at work earlier this week . 
 It's the truth . I am really happy . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Are you really ? 
 Is that what you really think ? 
 Hello , Oriental Hotel . 
 I ’ m sorry , Mr . Baker ’ s not in . May I take your message ? 
 Alright . Mr . Cook , I have Mr . baker called you back as soon as he gets here . 
 No problem . What ’ s wrong ? 
 Where is the pipe ? 
 Can you tell me how long the pipe has been leaking ? 
 You do realize that I will need to rip down your wall to get to the pipe , right ? 
 Is that all right ? 
 I ’ ll get started on it now . 
 200 bucks . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Oh , I guess I really did get ripped off . 
 Eighty-five dollars . If my bid is the highest after three more days , I win ! It's fun ! 
 But they won't ! I checked the seller's history , and he got good reviews from other buyers . 
 You are so paranoid ! Not everybody is a crook , you know . 
 Here you are . 
 Take the number 5 train and get off at the United Squire . 
 Do you want to buy a sweater ? 
 The cowl-neck pullovers are new in . It sells like hot cakes . 
 Of course . The brand is Bird and it's famous for its quality . 
 Yes , of course . There are many tea houses and bars in China , too . People can drink , eat and relax at these places . 
 Yes , sometimes the music there is so beautiful . It is very romantic . I can stay there for hours . 
 No , I often go there with my friends . 
 It's at 7:30 a . m . 
 Do you have your ID with you ? 
 Well , I need your ID and $ 27 . 
 Please hurry . 
 Thank you very much . Please fill out this paperwork .

 Thank you . Now turn in your application at Window B . 
 Yes , I'd like to have a look at the 2 - piece suit . 
 Middle size 
 Does this suit come in other color ? 
 How much is the brown one ? 
 Then I'll take it . 
 Yes , I ’ d like to activate my voice mail service please . 
 Sure that sounds great ! Are there any other fees ? 
 Perfect . I also wanted to know if there is any call forwarding service ? I am usually out of town and would like my calls to be forwarded to a local number . 
 Well , Miss Li , it's time for us to say good-bye to each other . 
 I'm glad you could come to see us off . I have enjoyed your interpreting . You have done a wonderful job . I hope you be my interpreter again next time I'm here . 
 It's hard to tear myself away from your friendly people and your ancient country , but nothing lasts for ever . I have to go back home this time , but I'm sure I'll return very soon . 
 Good-bye . Miss Li , say hello to your husband and your son for me . See you soon . 
 This small town has many serious problems . 
 The mayor and high officials practice cronyism and a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions . 
 Hi . are you new here ? 
 I'm Steven , your neighbour . 
 Nice to meet you , too . 
 I guess so . I live next door but one , and hope you'll drop in now and then . 
 Good afternoon , sir . Would you like a tea ? 
 Of course sir , would you like milk and sugar with that ? 
 I really feel like eating a salad . 
 I'm really not sure . 
 Caesar salads are pretty good . 
 I want a salad with some chicken . 
 I like my salads to have croutons , almonds , and shredded cheese . 
 You should make a salad like that . 
 I am afraid the label is not quite suitable for this locality . Could you quote us for the order with neutral cases ? 
 In that case , we'd like you to make some changes in the labeling . 
 First , the languages on the label should be in both English and French . Second , the red color doesn't suit our national customs . Could you print the label in some light colors such as yellowish or bluish ? 
 The brand name and the nice artwork need not be changed , but the net weight must be placed on the lower part of the panel . 
 Thanks for your help . 
 Yes , I hope we meet again . 
 Okay . 
 I felt dizzy when I stare at those shining lights . What should we do firstly ? 
 Let me see the notice . It is here . Our booth number is E108 . Good number . 
 We can also consult some from these volunteers . 
 Should we put our samples on this table ? 
 Jennifer , would you like to have dinner with me ? 
 Is today OK ? 
 How about tomorrow night ? 
 Is 9:00 PM all right ? 
 Is 6:00 PM OK ? 
 The Italian restaurant on 5th street . 
 How about the Korean restaurant next to it ? 
 What can I do for you today ? 
 Can I do anything else for you ? 
 Is that all ? 
 May I see your library card ? 
 You have to take care of this video . 
 You will be fined if you damage it . 
 I need a suggestion for a restaurant here in Manhattan . 
 My date's very sophisticated , so I'm sure she would expect nothing but the best . 
 No , thank you , I want to go out on the town . What other ideas do you have ? 
 That sounds like a good place to take a date . Can you make a reservation for me ? 
 I would like to make an appointment for a project meeting . 
 I would like to meet on Monday . 
 I want to come in the morning . 
 Yes , I can bring the outline when I come to the meeting . 
 I think that we should have just the sub-committee . 
 No , I need directions , please . 
 Good morning , miss . 
 Could you tell me please where can I find a currents exchange ? 
 I'd like to exchange 5000 Singapore dollars into the US dollars please . 
 Yes , here is my account number . 
 Sure , here is my passport , by the way what is the rate today ? 
 Yes , it is the credit demand.Where can I cash travellers ' cheques ? 
 900 dollars . 
 I need 8 hundreds and the rest in 10s please ? 
 Thank you , have a nice day . 
 You wouldn't believe what happened to me today . 
 The teacher asked me to make a speech in English class and I wasn't prepared . He punished me by making me stand in front of the whole class . It was so embarrassing . 
 Let me see . A roasted duck is $ 25 . A plate of pork is $ 6.50 . A bowl of beef is $ 7 . Two bottles of beer are $ 4 . That's a total of $ 42.50 . 
 Oh , sorry sir . We take no tips here . Thank you all the same . 
 Yes , I am James Mason from Anderson and Associates . I would like to see Mr . Smith . 
 Yes , he knows I'm coming . Our meeting is set for 2 o'clock . 
 Sure . 
 That would be very nice . Thank you . 
 Hello , Kate . 
 I was almost on line the whole night . 
 No , I listened to the music , too . 
 I'm tired . I need a rest . 
 Hi there , I ’ m Bill Gotcha , the owner of Gotcha Enterprises . Did you find your way here OK ? 
 Why are you switching jobs at this point in your career ? 
 What are you best at ? 
 What is your biggest challenge in terms of skills ? 
 That is good to hear ! 
 They are my own flesh and blood . It ’ s hard for me to see them suffering . 
 Do you have any particular conditions that you would like our firm to take into consideration ? 
 No problem . We can offer you a flat with two bedrooms and a living room . 
 You ’ ll get bonuses at the end of each year according to your achievements . Besides , we offer you 1 % commission on all your sales . 
 You can have Saturdays and Sundays off . In addition , you may have a paid month vacation every year . But when it is necessary , we do expect you to work overtime . Does it suit you ? 
 If you are satisfied with the conditions here , please sign this contract and give it to me . 
 Hey man ! How ’ s it hanging ? 
 Did you go to the roller rink on Saturday ? I heard it was far out , man ! 
 Right on , right on ! Well , Jim went to the rink with Sherry and he said it was dy-no-mite ! He was low on bread , but Sherry paid for everything . 
 Yeah man , I ’ m starving ! 
 Thanks . Wendy . There will be an important dinner party tonight . So I must make me the focus of my friends . 
 What problems are you having exactly ? 
 That is high . 
 But your promotional materials claim the broads are the least expensive of their types on the market . 
 That will involve additional expenses for us , which we will have to pass on to you as a rate hike . 
 Well . I will tell you what , Mr . Li . I will review the contract and talk with management . Then we will get together and hash this out . 
 I ’ Ve been a secretary for two years , before that I was at university . 
 It ’ s challenging , I feel I have learned a lot . 
 I get along well with people , and I enjoy working with others . 
 I am kind of nervous . 
 I don't know . I never went to a church before . I was not raised as a Christian , so I don't know what to do . 
 Maybe . I know I agreed to go with you , but now I don't feel right about it . 
 Really ? 
 Alright . But will we sing ? 
 I don't know the words . 
 And will I go up to the front to have the bread and wine ? 
 Eu-char-ist ? What is that ? 
 It doesn't sound like an English word . 
 Alright . Well , I feel more comfortable now.Now I understand I am welcome as a visitor . 
 I lost my wallet . 
 How do you know ? I thought Taiwanese people didn't have garage sales . 
 Well , I've grown to like second-hand things . I wouldn't have gotten through university without them ! 
 I use those sites . Hey ! Let's go check out a flea market later . 
 The last thing I want to see is to lose face before my friends . 
 But you know , things cannot always go as you expect . 
 Will you help me take these things to the car ? 
 Bring them to my wife's car . 
 The blue SUV in front of the Honda . 
 That chair over there , but please be careful with it . It was a gift from my mother-in-law . 
 Let me help you with that . I don't want you to hurt your back . 
 Didn't I tell you ? We're moving to Florida ? 
 Yes , that's true , but my wife found a new apartment on the Internet the other day and she wants to move right away . 
 I'm going to the hospital to see Susan . 
 Must I catch a number 7 bus to get there ? 
 Number 13 buses run much more frequently , don't they ? 
 Thank you , Henry . I'll get a number 13 . 
 Farmington ? Would you take a look at these catalogue ads that Roger did ? I don ’ t think we can use them . 
 I know , Mr . Farmington . But , I ’ m not sure that I should bring this up with him . I think it would be better if you spoke to him . 
 Next , please . Where to , sir ? 
 How many did you say , sir ? 
 That will be six dollars . Out of ten-seven , eight , nine , ten . Thank you . 
 I ’ m still shocked that Obama was elected . 
 He just made history . 
 Of course I did . Did you ? 
 I am really excited about this . 
 Hopefully , he ’ ll change things in our nation . 
 I trust him . 
 Yes . Look at these historical relics here , amazing ! 
 For protection . Some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air . 
 No , there isn't . They are all vacuumed . 
 Yeah , they all come from a very ancient time . 
 The bronze cup was made 4,000 years ago . It's priceless ! 
 Danny , priceless means so valuable that you can't put a price on it . 
 You seem to very busy these days . What are you doing ? 
 Where did you spend your holiday ? 
 I saw on TV that there is an entertainment item , bungee in Beijing Longtanhu Park . Except that the height is not exiting enough . 
 The highest bungee spot in the world is located in Mount Kikicama , South Africa , which is 216 meters high . A cable car in a scenic spot in Switzerland is 160 meters high . 
 It is said that Bungee was originally a grown-up ceremony of the indigenous people of New Guinea . People stood on branches of the tree , which was over 30 meters high . Their feet were fastened with canes and they jumped off from where they stood . When they almost reached the ground , they suddenly stopped to prove their bravery and express that they were able to endure the hardships of life independently . 
 How many foreign languages can you speak ? 
 What do you think of your English ? 
 Can you speak English fluently ? 
 Did you take TOEFL or GRE ? 
 When did you begin to learn English ? 
 Do you think your English is good enough to do office work ? 
 Have you taken the written test yet ? 
 You should study before you take it . 
 Why don't you take the test ? 
 Since you already paid for your permit , you don't have to pay again . 
 No , the test skips a lot of things in the book . 
 No , I didn't , because it was pretty hard . 
 Well , I'm glad you're finally back . I was wondering what happened . 
 Why ? 
 You got lost . You're kidding ! 
 You could have called . 
 You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ? 
 I don't know . Where ? 
 Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ? 
 Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here . 
 Hmm , maybe I do . 
 Maybe I have an idea how it happened . 
 You were too busy looking at Joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road . 
 Yes , that's what I think.Maybe the next time you go out with him to buy groceries , you'll get lost for even longer.Maybe six hours or so . 
 What ? 
 Hah , hah ! See ? I guessed right . You weren't watching the road at all . 
 Are you going to the cafeteria downstairs ? 
 Could you please get me a takeaway ? I have some urgent work to finish . So I don ’ t have enough time to go out for lunch . 
 I am not picky on food . Just bring me the day menu . 
 Is this the one you want ? 
 Here you are . 
 It's a ruby . It is from South Africa . Would you like to try it on ? 
 It costs $ 200 . 
 Tom , hi , this is Mary with Gold Star Mortgage . 
 We'd like you to come to work for us . 
 I see . 
 Please call us if you change your mind . 
 What's wrong , officer ? 
 I did ? 
 I'm sorry for running it , but I really didn't know . 
 I know that . 
 I'm not sure . 
 I'm sorry for the misunderstanding . 
 Mom , I hate eating vegetables ! 
 Thanks , Mom.Can I have dessert now ? I love chocolate cake . 
 But I don ’ t like them.It ’ s not fair . 
 Ok , actually I don ’ t mind eating peas and carrots.But I hate broccoli and cauliflower . 
 Thanks , Mom ! 
 Yes , he is running for class president . 
 Take my word for it . 
 In the summer it gets very hot.the temperature is often between 37 and 40 centigrade.when it is hot we often get rains.the winters are drier . 
 What are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees . 
 Yeah , we do . in the middle of summer there can be thunderstorms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog , is that true ? 
 Yes , they are . like i said we have thunderstorms.but each one usually only last a few hours.then the skys are clear again . 
 My grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child.but my parents and i only see it outside of our city . 
 As you know , my city is on the coast.the water is also not clean.but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot in sunny . 
 Until when ? 
 No problem . 
 Cool ! The sound is great . These earphones are awesome ! 
 You certainly need that . You always pump the volume up way too high . 
 You're right ! So I can listen to music while riding my motorbike ! 
 Hi . John , it ’ s Emily . How ’ s everything ? 
 Oh , I was just thinking about getting a bite to eat . Have you had lunch yet ? 
 Hi , this is Sharon in Mr . Reynolds ’ s office . One of your delivery men picked up a package here about an hour ago . 
 Well , it still hasn ’ t reached its destination . I wonder if you could track it down for us . Mr . Reynolds is a bit concerned . 
 I fed them earlier today . 
 Okay , I'll do that later . 
 I know . What time is their appointment ? 
 I got it . I will remember . 
 I ’ m sorry , Mr . Myers . I ’ Ve just been so busy today . 
 You ’ re right , sir . I apologize . I ’ ll get those files for you now . 
 It's really spectacular . 
 I think we can climb to the top , can't we ? 
 How did your vacation go ? 
 What about the trip ? Do you enjoy yourself ? 
 Did your boat float down the river ? 
 Sounds dangerous . 
 What a thrilling trip ! 
 Which glasses ? These glasses . 
 These ? 
 Here you are . 
 Have any plans for the weekend , Tom ? 
 Oh , do you go hiking often ? 
 It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ? 
 Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike . 
 Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest . 
 Thanks , I ’ ll ask him . 
 I am attending Hebes University of Technology . 
 This coming July . 
 I will receive a Bachelor's degree . 
 My major is Business Administration . 
 I have been doing quite well at college . According to the academic records I've achieved so far , I am confident that I will get my Bachelor of Business Administration this coming July . 
 I have already learned a lot in the classroom and I hope to be able to make practical use of it in your company . My specialization at the university is just in line with the areas your institute deals with . I am sure I can apply what I have learned to the work in your institute . 
 Wow , what a lovely cake . 
 Oh , they all went out ! Did you make a wish ? 
 Better luck this time . 
 I can't wait to see the expression on her face when we dump her . 
 Don't worry . I'm patient , but vengeance will be mine . 
 My pal , you are so nervous recently . You don't need to be like that . 
 Just use your head . If you were definitely making some big mistakes , you would be informed . 
 That is merely a dream . Remember , there is always room for us to have further improvement . I think we did the good job in the whole period . 
 Our maths teacher is rather humorous . 
 No , not at all.His examples are really interesting . 
 Yeah , how about your maths teacher ? 
 Bad luck , Anne . 
 She's another antique . 
 I want to take a photograph . 
 I like one taken half length . 
 Print shop . Seam speaking . 
 It usually takes 2 to 3 weeks to complete a job like that . 
 Judy , your husband has a really nice car . 
 Where are you going ? 
 I didn't know your sister lives in the city , when did she move there ? 
 I see . It's almost 5:00 PM now , don't you think there will be a lot of traffic ? 
 Yes , but it can be very crowded around this time . I always feel uncomfortable taking the subway . 
 Doesn't your mother live in the city ? 
 I remember when she moved there . Apartments were a lot cheaper then . 
 Have a good time . Next time you're free , give me a call and we'll go play poker . 
 Mom , I just finished my paper . Can you proofread it before I hand it in ? 
 Thanks . 
 I really did ! I started thinking about what I wanted to say three weeks ago . 
 Let ’ s just hope my teacher agrees . 
 Yes , it is . 
 Please show me your parcel order . 
 Let me check your parcel number . Song Ping's parcel number should be CP 06230221 5 CN . Here is your parcel . 
 Not at all . 
 I suppose you know very well that we require irrevocable letters of credit payable against presentation of shipping documents . 
 I'm afraid it has been our practice so far to insist on payment by L / C . 
 I understand that . Still , I'm not in a position to help you . Maybe we could do something later when we have had more and larger deals together . 
 Sounds good , when ? 
 Any time is fine . 
 Please wait for us even if we're a little late . 
 See you then . 
 Could you tell me if you have ever taken a class from Dr . Miller ? 
 Yes , but I have never taken his class before . 
 Yes , that's what I need . 
 Yes , I guess so . 
 Yes , I had a teacher like that before . 
 No , I didn't , but that could be a good thing . 
 When I was a little boy , I had a dream of becoming a lawyer . 
 Yes , I knew I would make it . 
 Did you tip the bellboy ? 
 That sounds about right to me , fifty cents a bag . If they think you don ’ t know better , they ’ ll try to get more . 
 I disagree . He was polite and informative , and he drove smoothly . One should reward good service . 
 Remember last month when we were in Europe ? Maybe Californians use that same system they add the waiter or waitress into the bill , so you don ’ t have to leave anything extra . 
 Sure . Just a minute . Let me take my camera out . 
 I'm not sure . 
 I hope not ! Oh , I see . 
 The batteries are worn down . I need replace them . 
 All photography shops carry them . 
 Hey daddy ! You look great today . I like your tie ! By the way , I was wondering can I & 
 I haven't even told you what it is yet ! 
 Do you think I could borrow the car ? I ’ m going to concert tonight . 
 Egg ! I told you about it last week ! Smelly Toes is playing , and Eric asked if I would go with him ! 
 Duh ! He's like the hottest and most popular guy at school ! Come on , dad ! Please ! 
 Fine then ! Would you mind giving me 100 bucks ? 
 That ’ s so unfair ! 
 Things are going fairly well . How about you ? 
 I am looking for a job myself . What were you thinking of doing next ? 
 Have you gotten any interviews yet ? 
 Have you thought about the electrician program over there ? 
 I think we should go over there and see if we can apply for that program . 
 Yes . I'll have the fresh fruit cocktail . 
 I think I'll Ty the crisp deep-fried chicken . 
 Sure . Have you checked the weather report ? 
 No , thanks Mom . I'd like some toast and chicken wings . 
 Done . Oh , don't forget to take napkins disposable plates , cups and picnic blanket . 
 Yes , madam . 
 No , mom , I can manage it by myself . His help just causes more trouble . 
 Great idea . Unlike you , I just want to enjoy watching the sea and playing with the sand . I do not want to get a tan because I look good in pale skin . 
 While the pale color symbolizes beauty and elegance in most Asia countries . 
 I will bring a big hat and apply a lot of sunscreen before setting off the beach . 
 ( At the beach ) My bag is so heavy . Let's put the stuff under the tree . 
 I can't wait to play in the water . My feet are burning when I stand on the sand . 
 Fine ! How are you ? 
 I've come to tell you I'm going to the concert this evening.Will you come with me ? I've two complimentary tickets . 
 It will be held at the Music Hall . 
 It's a piano recital . I'm fond of piano , you know . 
 Generally speaking , a CV or resume is made up of 6 parts , personal information , educational experience , practical experience , personal skills , self-evaluation and job intentions . 
 Including your name , sex , date of birth , height , phone number , and so on . 
 Of course not , go ahead . 
 Well , sure it is . Actually , I have been cutting down the amount since two months ago . I used to smoke a pack of cigarettes for a single day . Now I limit it to 6 cigarettes a day . 
 Thank you for your suggestion . 
 When do you celebrate Thanksgiving ? 
 What do you eat on that day ? 
 Anything else ? 
 I'm almost hungry . 
 I don ’ t know . But he must be a big shot . 
 Because everyone is trying to butter him up . 
 Thank you . You're very kind . 
 Yes , I ’ m here for an interview as requested . 
 That ’ s right . 
 Thank you , madam . 
 It is a great pleasure for me to have this opportunity for interview . 
 Yes , here they are . This is my ID card . This is my diploma . And this is my certificate for nurse qualifications . 
 I'm from Lexington Software and I'm here to collect an export L / C . 
 Great . Can I take it with me now ? Or do you need me to fill in some forms or something ? 
 Here you are . 
 No problem , I'll get on that right away . Thanks , bye . 
 Yes , I did . 
 Oh , I didn't watch the football match . I wanted to but my wife preferred to see the old film . 
 How did it finish ? 
 It was quite good . But . I missed the beginning of it because I had to eat first . 
 No , she didn't . After half an hour she stopped watching and started to read a book . 
 I need to know about the fees . 
 I ’ m asking about overdraft fees . 
 What ’ s the fee ? 
 How is that a small fee ? 
 I ’ ll say . 
 I don ’ t need to know anything else . Thank you . 
 I ’ m so sorry that I have got to go . I have a business appointment right now . 
 Yes . The videographer has already started filming my parents trying to speak English with the flight attendants . 
 It'll be the year 2000 ! The flight attendants are coming over here . They're carrying bottles of champagne ! 
 Time for what ? 
 You mean get married now ? On the plane ? 
 I don't know what to say , Jack ! 
 How is your ankle ? 
 Please be careful next time . 
 Mrs . Lee , I ’ Ve stayed here for almost a week . And I really must leave tomorrow . 
 Thank you . You ’ Ve been so nice to me . 
 No , thanks . You ’ Ve done a lot for me already . Thank you for everything . 
 I need your help , Bob . 
 I'm really confused by these annoying abbreviations . 
 A / S / L , IGP , H & K , and ZZZ . What the hell do they mean ? 
 Interesting . Then what does H & K refer to ? The city of Hong Kong ? 
 Really ? What kind ? A girl left this word to me , and I thought she was in Hong Kong . 
 Hug and kiss ? ! How is it possible ? Oh , it's really bad to Miun - Verstand her meaning . 
 Hotel front desk . 
 For what time ? 
 Have you seen the new Hannibal Letter movie ? 
 Yes . What did you think of it ? 
 I liked it , too . It was scary , but not disgusting . I always enjoy watching Anthony Hopkins . He's brilliant . 
 Oh , yes , he is brilliant . What's the name of the young actor ? 
 Yes . He was excellent . They worked well together . 
 I'd love to . 
 Any day except Tuesday . 
 Yes , Thursday would be fine . What time shall I come ? 
 Yes , of course . Thank you very much . 
 What did you buy at the market ? 
 You seem to have bought the whole market ! 
 Paper-cuts are all hand-made . Let me see the paper-cuts you bought . They are all animals . 
 All right . Animals , especially Chinese zodiac , are the most common theme in paper-cuts . But there are other themes . 
 Why do you want to buy so much ? 
 I see . 
 Is this line for non-residents ? 
 Ok . Here's my passport . 
 I think it's soon , maybe in a few months . It was renewed in Beijing , so the new expiry date is on the last page . 
 I won't . 
 No , I don't have anything to declare . 
 I'll be here for about a year . 
 I'll be studying . I'm doing an MBA at Nottingham University . 
 I have a housing contract with the university . I'll be in a dorm room on campus . 
 My father has already paid for that in advance . Here are the receipts . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Oh , Goodness , please not again.That ' s what we did last week . 
 Right , it was a chick flick , just like this one , so what's the difference ? Besides , this is the last week for the third movie in Destroyer series and I want to see that on a big screen . Action movies need to be seen in a theater on a big screen . 
 Oh , sure , it was great . I had popcorn for dinner and paid the price of a movie ticket to get a two-hour nap . 
 That place doesn't have a single meat dish.Just fish and shellfish and you know I don't like fish that much . 
 But when I pick the restaurant , we go to a place that has both chicken and fish . I always respect your food preferences . 
 Now you're talking , we can see that love story next time . 
 Oh , really ? Isn't this spot C408 ? 
 I'm sorry , I must have been confused . I had thought it's C section , but actually it's D section . I'll move my car right away . 
 May I help you ? 
 Do you have an account with us ? 
 Do you want large or small bills ? 
 What denomination ? 
 Do you want the whole amount in traveler's check ? 
 Reservation , can I help you ? 
 Wait a moment , please . Let me check it . 
 Right now we have a suite for 4 people , do you want to book it ? 
 Do you enjoy going on dates ? 
 What's so fun about them ? 
 So you always have fun on dates ? 
 Why not ? 
 So then why would you ask them out in the first place ? 
 Sounds like a huge waste of time to me . 
 We have a great variety of men's suits , sir.Which particular brand do you prefer ? 
 How about this one ? 
 Which window do I go to for parcel ? 
 I want to mail this package . 
 Zhuhai . 
 What's the difference in price ? 
 How long will it take by air ? 
 Then I will send it by air , thank you . 
 Just some souvenirs . 
 Thank you . 
 Any idea when you'll leave ? 
 Let me know when you find out . 
 When will I know your decision ? 
 It ’ s quite convenient . 
 OK . Thank you very much . 
 That ’ s a secret . I couldn ’ t tell you . 
 Ikebana , it's an art of flowers and it's quite different from Western style flower arrangement because in Ikebana's theory you can decorate one flower , only with one flower . 
 Japanese art ? Mm , Ikebana ! Tea Ceremony ! 
 Tea Ceremony ! It's , there's a certain way you have to make tea , not only make tea , there's a certain way to for example wipe a bowl . 
 Yes , with one piece of cloth , and you need to learn how to fold the cloth so that you you use each part of the cloth only once to wipe the bowl 
 There's some professionals for both flower arrangement and tea ceremony . So you need to go to a school , yes , and learn from your teacher and their hierarchy and the organization and you need to pass each test to go , climb up the ladder in the hierarchy . 
 The cat has eaten my fish , I'll kill it . 
 I'll beat him . 
 Can I help you ? 
 What kind of drink would you like with that ? 
 Would you like a super size meal ? Only 2 RIB more , you'll get large coke and fries instead of medium . And today we are offering free toys all the meal boxes . 
 That's not a problem , Miss . Will that be it ? 
 That will be 25RMB , please 
 What do you like to do in your spare time ? 
 Really ? 
 They are beautiful . You did a good job . 
 As a matter of fact , you are really a terrific photographer . 
 I'd like to confirm a reservation , please.My name is Wang Lin . My flight is KF98 . 
 What ? I am afraid you have made a mistake , I am leaving on July 21st alone . 
 No.It is Wang . 
 That's right.Thank you . 
 Really ? Can I join it ? 
 How can I join it ? 
 OK , thank you . 
 Well , a way to make a living , of course , but beyond that I think a job is a way of developing oneself as a person . 
 I wouldn't like to hold a specific title . I just want to enjoy what I am doing . 
 It's the most important thing to me . 
 I think a company is a place to get work done . Certainly friendly , open relationships among all company employees is important , and I think an employee should be serious about his or her work responsibilities and have a professional relationship with the boss . 
 Goodbye . 
 You can check on the bulletin boards at school for local housing . 
 There are websites that can hook you up with a roommate . 
 It depends on what you want . Do you want a one - or two-bedroom apartment ? 
 That will probably cost you around twelve hundred dollars a month . 
 I would be happy to look at apartments with you . 
 Right . The people in your math class might not be the people you have science with . 
 Yep . And the date is set for homecoming night . 
 It's a football game the school team plays at home . The dance and reunions are usually that night , too . 
 Hello , is there a room available ? 
 A twin room , please . 
 Oh , I see . Thank you anyway . 
 That is a good idea , I love it . What time do you think is convenient ? 
 Ok , I will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . It has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . I am sure they don ’ t want to miss it . 
 Excuse me , I'd like to send this parcel . 
 Just a few shirts . 
 No , I'd rather send it by ordinary mail . 
 Here you are . 
 Thank you so much . 
 You seem to be unhappy . What happened ? 
 What does the doctor say ? 
 What happened to your car ? 
 Are they going to pay you for the damages ? 
 What the hell . That doesn't make sense . What are you going to do ? 
 That sucks . I'd be pissed if that happened to me . 
 Oh my gosh . Damn ... screw the court , I would burn down their store . 
 I am looking for some information about home stay . 
 How did you pay them ? 
 Would you please bring us a menu ? 
 Western food . 
 Excuse me , is this the parcel counter ? 
 I'd like to send this parcel , please . 
 Some books and newspapers . 
 Is it all right ? 
 No , I'd rather send it by sea . 
 Thank you . 
 Rachel ? This is John Emory speaking . 
 I ’ Ve got some bad news . All the plans sent over to the McGrath Corporation have been rejected . We ’ re going to have to start from scratch . 
 Doctor , save my baby , please 
 He has had a fever for one day . Just now at home , he had febrile convulsions with teeth and fists clenched and eyes turned up . We were at a loss what to do . We called an ambulance and brought the baby here . 
 About 3 minutes . 
 Three days ago , he began to cough , sneeze and have a running nose . Yesterday , he began to have a fever . 
 It was 38 ° C this morning and it was 39 ° C just now . 
 Is it serious ? Is it meningitis ? 
 Does he have to be admitted to hospital ? 
 Thank you very much , doctor . 
 No , thanks . I'm just looking . 
 I see , sir . Those two ladies in front of your room did the same thing twenty minutes ago . 
 I am afraid we have no extra key . So I will send somebody to your room . 
 Please drop it at the front desk when you leave the hotel . 
 Good afternoon , Mr . Brown . My name is Mrs . Anderson , manager of the sales department . 
 Nice to see you too , Mr . Brown . Won ’ t you sit down ? 
 What would you like , tea or coffee ? 
 Is it your first trip to the Fair , Mr . Brown ? 
 Good . Is there anything you find changed about the Fair ? 
 Really , Mr . Brown ? Did you find anything interesting ? 
 We are glad to hear that . What items are you particularly interested in ? 
 All right . 
 I'd be glad to . 
 Yes . I have to change a room . 
 Next door is so noisy . I can't sleep at all . 
 Look at these clothes designed by top fashion designer like Versacci , Calvin Klein , and Vivienne Westwood . What do you think of them ? 
 I know what you mean . People would stare at you in amazement if you wore something like that in an everyday situation . I suppose only extravagant rich people wear them at cocktail parties . 
 I think that the designers hold these fashion shows for a few reasons . First , it ’ s just like a big party . They can meet each other and network . The other thing is that it is great advertising . All the journalists and photographers are there . Thirdly , it give them a chance to show what they would like to see people wearing . 
 Yes . I think the designers are saying that these clothes are what they would like to see people wear if those people weren ’ t concerned with what other people might think . In a way , the designers are saying ‘ don ’ t worry about what others think . Wear what you like ! ’ . 
 Come on . All this fashion has reminded me that I want to buy some clothes . 
 Please show me your ID card and tell me the receiver's address . 
 Ok , that's all . 
 You bought a compact car ? 
 Let me guess , from Sarah . It looks like something she would drive . 
 I love it . It's so festive ! And where did you get that cup ? It's got the same logo . 
 Yes , I have . I was employed by the financial section of the university ever since I graduated . I worked there for 3 years . Then I had worked in a bank for 3 years . 
 Very short time . I became an auditor within three months . 
 What's the problem ? 
 What charge was made ? 
 You didn't make this purchase ? 
 Sorry . When was this purse purchased ? 
 We'll do an investigation and get to the bottom of this . 
 No . We'll take care of everything . 
 Yes . I've got a small room . 
 200 yuan a week , but smoking is not allowed . 
 Would you mind waiting ? I'm on the telephone . 
 How should I get their contact info . 
 Where should I put them up ? 
 The clients like the Shangri-La Hotel more . 
 What else would I prepare , Sir ? 
 Certainly . 
 Of course . I'm on it 
 I wish to buy a diamond ring . 
 Two carats . 
 No , it seems too old-fashioned . 
 Let me try it on , it's too small for me , haven't you got any larger ones ? 
 This fits me well , how much is it ? 
 It's reasonable . Here you are . 
 It doesn't matter . 
 Could you tell me the advantages of it ? 
 There is something in what you said , but what is the rent ? 
 In my opinion , the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas . 
 Your intention is good , but I still can't agree with you . If no one would like to share it with you , you have to pay it all by yourself . 
 I agree with you in this way . But how often do you go to work or shopping per week ? 
 In my opinion , you have to go to the university every day , and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university . 
 do you believe in UFO's ? 
 I've never thought about it like that before . 
 do you think that there's life on other planets ? 
 why is that ? 
 do you think that there's intelligent life trying to contact us ? 
 I suppose you're right . 
 do you really think that global warming Wil destroy Earth some day ? 
 Jenny , I was wondering ... if you .. eh are you busy this Friday ? 
 Oh , what about Saturday ? Are you free then ? 
 What about tonight ? Do you have plans tonight ? 
 Yes , yes , I want to take you to dinner . 
 Excuse me . I'd like to check out , please . 
 No . 
 By American express , if that's ok . 
 That's ok . I'm expecting a lift from my friend . 
 Cheer up ! Let bygones be bygones . 
 It seems you have to take time . 
 Cloudy in the morning , overcast in the afternoon . 
 No , but I wouldn't be surprised if it rained tomorrow . 
 Hello . I was wondering if Taylor Smith has checked out yet ? 
 The cancer ward ! ? Oh , my . It's worse than we thought . 
 That's impossible ! I'm talking about Mister Taylor Smith . 
 I'm really sick ! 
 What ? You have been in love for six years , haven ’ t you ? 
 What a pity . 
 I had a bad day yesterday . 
 I went to the library and lost my bag . 
 I went back for it . But it was already gone . 
 Excuse me , is there any summer resort around the town ? 
 It doesn't matter . I just want to have a relax and I don't care how far it is . Can you tell me how to get there ? 
 Thanks a billion . 
 Yes . Speaking of digital wares , I bought a digital camera last week . 
 A Sony . It's only one third the size of my old camera and looks rather smart . 
 Superb ! It's a 4 megapixel one and the photos it takes are very vivid and clear . 
 Yes , I just forgot where the bed linens department is . 
 Thank you . 
 What can I get for you today ? 
 Would you like cheese on that ? 
 Would you like a drink ? 
 What kind of soda would you like ? 
 Sure , no problem . 
 Will that be all ? 
 Hurry up ! Time is money ! 
 But you are too slow to follow them . 
 Welcome to our factory . My name is Tiang Had and I'll show you around here.First we'll take a look at the workshop which produces food thermometers . Please , this way . 
 Yes , it has . 
 This is a circuit board . 
 No , they are from other factories . 
 It is lithium which can be used for over three years . 
 Um , sure . What are we having for dinner ? Do I need to put out anything in particular ? 
 Ok , should I use the fancy silverware ? 
 I ’ ll also set some cups and saucers for some coffee after dinner . 
 They are in the cupboard where you keep the gravy boat and serving dishes . Just be careful because the wine glasses are also there . 
 How did you first meet ? 
 Was it love at first sight ? Did you fall in love with her the first time you met her ? 
 Tom has grown six inches within a year . 
 Yeah , do you see his Adam's apple ? It becomes bigger . 
 What did you do at that company ? 
 If a consumer complains about the quality of your products , what will you do ? 
 I would like to buy a bottle of cleansing milk.Can you recommend me some kinds ? 
 My skin is oily . 
 Can you tell me more ? 
 Sure . I will clean the glasses for you . 
 Walk straight and turn left . 
 Yes , I'm calling from Mexico . I will be in town next week and would like to know if you have availability . 
 Yes , July ninth . I will be there for seven nights . 
 What's the difference ? 
 OK , I would like to reserve the superior suite . Is breakfast included ? 
 Sure , my credit card number is ... 
 I grow a variety of things , so that something is in bloom all year round . 
 It looks best in spring , when the plum and cherry blossoms are out . 
 Go ahead . 
 Hi , Steven . 
 I ’ m very well , Thank you . And you ? 
 He ’ s fine , Thanks . How ’ s Emma ? 
 Nice to see you , too , Steven . Goodbye . 
 Yeah , really , jane and ted always have great parties .

 Sir what's the boarding time ? 
 I don't want to miss my flight . 
 Thank you . 
 It is a bit of a fixer-upper . Let ’ s take a look inside . 
 You know , with a little elbow grease and paint , you could spruce it up a bit . 
 Let ’ s go check out the kitchen . The printout says that it is quite large . 
 Maybe the master suite has some redeeming qualities . Follow me , please . 
 Perhaps we should move on to the next listing . 
 Thank you . I can't imagine the design of the new computer is so popular among computer users . 
 I am flattered . But I am not sure whether the manager is satisfied with it . She asked me to her office . 
 I feel nervous when I face her . She looks so serious when we have a conversation all the time . 
 It is said that the sales for the new computer did not meet the expectation . 
 I'm still nervous . I don't know what to say to the manager . I always feel ill at ease in that kind of place . 
 What are you using for bait today ? 
 Is that so ? We're using lures , and the fish are biting those too . 
 I heard the film was after the novel The Godfather . 
 Mario Puku . 
 I'm always interested in how , but seldom pay much attention to who . 
 I don ’ t think so . 
 That ’ s should be fun . 
 It's not my fault .

 Great ! This is my first visit to the Fair . Everything is new to me . Would you please give me some information ? 
 What about your company ? 
 My firm has high standing in my country . My bank is the City Bank , New York . You may refer to it for my status . 
 Yes , very . I thought the last speaker was especially good . 
 How do you do ? I'm Ted Nugent . 
 It's Nugent , N-U-G-E-N-T , but just call me Ted . 
 Glad to meet you . 
 Me ? I'm in the car business . 
 Yes , that's right . And how about you ? 
 Oh , really ? What do you do there exactly ? 
 Which bus should I take from PHS to Sons ? 
 I believe that it's on Fair Oaks and Orange Grove . 
 Do you know which buses I need to take ? 
 What do I do after I get on the 268 ? 
 Then what ? 
 That's all ? 
 Did you call me , sir ? 
 What am I expected to do ? 
 I see . It must be a challenging job , but I would like to do it . And what about now ? 
 OK , I'll get to work on it at once . 
 She will insist . It's a rosary . She has millions of them . Take it . 
 Oh ! My grandmother used to say “ raising pigs , raising kids ... at least you can eat the pigs . ” 
 She likes to complain about her macho husband and her “ bambinos ” , but she loves them all dearly . 
 I'm going to the movies with a friend . How about you ? 
 Well , did you want to go see a movie with me ? 
 I'm not sure yet . Is there something you want to see ? 
 So , did you want to go ? 
 Okay , sounds good . 
 Yes , can I see a few T-shirts , Please ? 
 I'm not very particular about the design.But I want something of good quality . 
 I'm thirsty . Pull over to that store , I'll buy some drinks . 
 Oh , that's too bad , Where can you park around here ? 
 Is a shop there ? 
 Good afternoon . What can I do for you today , Madam ? 
 OK , Madam . We are here to help . 
 I understand completely . There are other options , such as a Personal Pledge Loan . 
 The procedure is really simple and convenient . All you need to do is fill in this Loan Application form . 
 Of course , we'll need some documentation from you . Like your resident permit , proof of salary and your USD Deposit Certificate , to use as collateral . 
 Oh , honey . You came . I'm so glad ! Why are you wearing a bonnet ? 
 They're beautiful . Taylor , you're so pale and skinny ! 
 I guess . Are you sure you're taking care of yourself ? 
 I can't seem to find the cereal aisle . 
 What breakfast foods ? 
 Oh , I think I know what you're talking about . 
 Could you tell me where the dishwashing detergent is ? 
 Oh , I didn't think of that . 
 Well , thank you very much . 
 What are the best places to visit here please ? 
 Great . What do you suggest we see ? 
 The exhibits are really special . I enjoy the paintings very much . 
 How about your grades of study ? 
 Besides your major , do you know some in other fields ? 
 Have you ever been a student cadre ? 
 Did it affect you much ? 
 In your spare time , do you have any part time jobs ? 
 morning , Mr . Montgomery . I ’ Ve been sent over from purchasing to fill in for Clare Williams . 
 Oh , about seven years . Time flies , you know ! 
 I want to have a complete relaxation this weekend . 
 Yes , exactly . 
 What is the scale of the company ? 
 How many subsidiaries do you have ? 
 Who is that guy ? 
 Really ? He is my type . 
 What position does he play ? 
 Oh , I love Michael Jordan . He fills people's lives with great excitement . 
 Kobe is a good player but I heard he is a womanizer . 
 Jordan is a legend , anyway . An idol that no one can replace . I think Clive can make a good professional basketball player . He is not just about muscles he also plays smart . 
 By the way , do you know if he has a girl friend ? 
 Oh , My chance is slim then . 
 Sorry . You know the rules . 
 That ’ s out of the question . 
 Not a chance . 
 Sorry , it ’ s impossible . 
 You're right , we need to start making money soon , or at least manage to break even . But I think that the market is slowly beginning to heat up--sales are bound to pick up any time now . 
 Maybe we should rethink our marketing strategy to include the possibility that our new line of cosmetics could be a big seller . 
 Do you think it's that serious ? 
 My goodness , I didn't realize it was that bad . 
 It ’ s severe punishment , I think . 
 No wonder . 
 It's ages since I went to see a film . 
 But now I would stay at home watching TV . 
 Have you chosen the material ? 
 Fine . And the charge is $ 100 . 
 Next Wednesday . 
 What is it ? 
 What do you mean ? What happened ? 
 How is this possible ? You are supposed to be talking to our stockbrokers and making sure that our securities and investments are safe and making a profitable return ! 
 Do what you have to do ! One other thing , don ’ t tell the rest of the stockholders about this . If they find out , it ’ s the end of this company ! 
 It's a document from the seller to the buyer . It contains full particulars of the goods sold , such as quantity , quality , price , forwarding particulars , and terms of payment . 
 Four . They are Loco invoice , FOB invoice , CIF invoice and Franco invoice . 
 By Loco invoice , the price includes only the cost of goods at the warehouse of the seller . By FOB invoice , the price includes the cost before the cargo is delivered . By CIF invoice , the price includes all the expenses of cost freight and insurance . The price in Franco invoice includes all expenses to destination . 
 Hey , Gucci . I didn't know it would be a charity show . You can see there are many collecting boxes at the entrance . 
 That's really a good thing . Let's do our part . 
 Who will sing in the show ? 
 Mendy ? Are you sure ? I love her songs ! 
 Yeah . Though she was so popular , I heard she managed to maintain a low profile . 
 But I also heard some people didn't like her music . I don't understand why . She is so amazing ! 
 You are right . Anyway , things will be different as the days go on . She can get it . I have faith in her . 
 Here is the programme . Check it out yourself ! 
 This is how a holiday should be . Relaxing on the beach with a nice cool drink . 
 Don ’ t worry about them . They ’ re very responsible . Besides , there are many people there and there ’ s lifeguard employed by the hotel . Waiter ! Could I have another drink pleas ? Thank you . So , what shall we do this evening ? 
 So , we could try that restaurant that was recommended in the guidebook . Then we could go to a club . We haven ’ t been to one for ages . 
 Now , how about going for a swim in the sea ? We shouldn ’ t sunbathe all day . 
 I had no idea when I volunteered to assist governor Brown with this campaign what I was getting myself into . 
 How Ay years have you been working with him ? 
 It's easier doing this kind hard work when I know that I trust the man behind the posters . 
 He would be good . 
 I'm pretty good . 
 Did you get your learner's permit yet ? 
 Do you have any experience driving a car ? 
 Do you know all the controls in the car ? 
 When do you want to start learning how to drive ? 
 We can do it tomorrow ; just call me . 
 Sure . First of all , it ’ s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic . 
 So you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment . 
 That ’ s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes . 
 It ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications . 
 I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . 
 You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous . 
 You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement . 
 It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior . 
 Yeah , but I'm still waiting for my invitation . 
 Well , she'll probably just give me my invitation later on today . 
 I think so . It sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun . 
 What time does the party start ? 
 Oh , well , how many people has she given invites to so far ? 
 Well , hopefully she'll give me my invite later on today . 
 Yes , I'd like to change some money to cover my expenses here . What's today's rate of US dollar against the RIB yuan ? 
 $ 200 altogether . 
 Here it is . And how much RIB shall I get ? 
 That's correct . Thank you very much . 
 Sure . It's the third office down this hall . Are you looking for Bob ? 
 I'm sorry , but he's not in the office now . Do you have an appointment ? 
 Yes . What time did he expect you ? 
 I see . He's usually here on Tuesday mornings ... 
 I know . He's usually here , but today he went out to a site on the east side . 
 Why don't you make an appointment for later in the week ? 
 He's here on Tuesdays , Wednesdays and Fridays . What day did you want to see him ? 
 Morning or afternoon ? 
 I can put you down for ten o'clock . Is that alright ? 
 Alright . I have you down for ten AM this Friday . 
 You are welcome . 
 I'm so honored that you thought to ask me . 
 You're going to do great . And you're going to look great . 
 I still like the olive one best . There's a tailor here who can take up the sleeves for you . 
 These guys are professional . I think they can have it done tomorrow . Let's ask . 
 Would you like those with yogurt ? 
 What else would you like to add ? We highly recommend caterpillar fungus . 
 It ’ s a special kind of Chinese herb . It ’ s good for you ! 
 What would you like to speak to me about ? 
 Is that right ? 
 That ’ s wonderful . I am impressed at someone so young taking a stand . 
 That ’ s fantastic . 
 I ’ m going to vote . 
 I will . Good luck with your volunteering . 
 Do you have an appointment , Mr . Liu ? 
 Mr . Thomas is quite busy , I ’ m afraid he won ’ t be able to see you today . 
 Have a seat please while I call . 
 We appreciate your intention , but the amount of your orders last year was moderate . 
 Do you think it will help if we appoint a local agent ? 
 Well , we'll consider your proposal . 
 Don't worry . No big deal . Just a common cold . 
 No . You can never count on the grown-ups when there is something . 
 Come on , sister . This is the seventh glass already . 
 Do we ? Where is it ? 
 Be careful . Now I have no one but you to depend on . 
 What's the new strike ? 
 Poor me ! 
 We'll have to get you to a hospital . I can ride you on the back of my bike . 
 Yes , I almost slid too.Alright . This tourniquet is tight . How does it feel ? 
 Alright , I'm twisting it around . You tell me when to stop . 
 Steven , have you any friend in London ? 
 Are you close ? 
 I'm going to London on business next week . But I know nothing about it . 
 Yes , Steven . You always know what I want . 
 Thank you ! 
 I have been coming here for the past few years . 
 It's actually a lot cheaper for me to wash my clothes here . 
 Why don't you wash clothes at home ? 
 Why don't you just get it fixed ? 
 So you plan on washing your clothes here from now on ? 
 Don't worry . Besides , it's a lot cheaper to wash clothes this way . 
 Yes , we've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery.And they are all newly renovated . 
 No problem . We have a nice apartment located near the Oriental Square . It's perfect for people busy with office work . It is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details . 
 Ah ! I get your point . We have just what you need . Our Jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . The one bedroom apartments are very economical , but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . I think you can find a very apartment there . 
 Of course . It's just at 19 Lingual Road . You can phone me again if you can't find the right place . 
 I dare you to talk to that girl . 
 You two are so health-conscious ! 
 Why not ! Before you know it , I'll be heading off to the mountains to stand on my head ! 
 Thanks for the carrot juice , Mrs . Schmidt . I've got to run to class ! 
 Hello , my name is Xu Hua . I'm from Beijing . 
 Welcome to China , Paula . 
 Do you like flowers ? 
 What's your favorite flower ? 
 Spring is a lively season . 
 I admire plum blossoms very much . It seems that only it can blossom in the cold winter . 
 It is the symbol of laughing at hoar frost and fighting with snow . I admire the bravery of plum blossoms . 
 The bright people will remember it forever . 
 Hello , may I speak to Mr . Robert the Human Resources Manager ? 
 OK , that's fine . Thank you . 
 Ahh ... What a fine day ! I do feel like an outdoor exercise . 
 OK.It ' s delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh . 
 Don't you see many people over there ? Just on your left . 
 A growing keep-fit fever is sweeping over China . 
 It sounds cool . The rhythms look really difficult . 
 Well , black people are supposed to be great dancers . 
 Ha-ha ! You got me there ! 
 Seventy cents a piece . 
 Sixty cents a piece . 
 Sure ! They are very fresh , first of all . We sell at a bargain , and you make a wise purchase if you buy them today . Eighty cents only , a piece . 
 Thank you very much and anything else ? 
 I heard you will be going on a business trip . 
 How long will you be away ? 
 Who will take your place ? 
 Good choice . He is competent for the position . 
 Both Bob and carl will become somebody in the future.Don ' t you think so ? 
 But Bob is more generous and ready to help . 
 Dad , how can we get to the zoo ? 
 Does this bus go there ? 
 Let's step in , Dad . 
 Dad . Here comes another bus . 
 Why ? Dad ? 
 May I know your full name ? 
 How do you spell your family name ? 
 What is your present address ? 
 May I ask your telephone number ? 
 Where are you from ? 
 May I ask the date of your birth ? 
 Once you arrive at the American airport , please call me . 
 Take care of yourself . 
 You ’ re in America now , my British friend . We just call it football . 
 The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked , but the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone . 
 Yeah , he tackled him so hard his helmet came off . 
 It looks like it , he ’ s getting up . 
 The Giants ? 
 Well , here we go again . 
 The Redskin ’ s quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . We ’ re losing again . 
 Yes , I wanna go to America for my vacation . 
 Sounds good . Are there any group tours I can go with ? 
 Great . So how long is the trip ? 
 Fine . I happen to have 20 days for holiday , so exciting ! How many places will be visited and what are they ? Where will be staying and how about the food there ? 
 Well , cool . What's the price for this trip ? 
 Well . 40,000 RIB that's really a lot of money . I will have to think about it . 
 Is it Thursday ? I mean if I let the chance slide ... 
 Well . Ok , I will take it . 
 Switchboard . Which extension would you like ? 
 I'm afraid the line is busy at the moment . Just hold on , please . 
 Certainty , sir . 
 The one on the manikin is in fashion now . 
 OK , here you are . You look really attractive in that gown . 
 Who is Cindy ’ s husband ? 
 How many children do Cindy and Ron have ? 
 Do they have any grandchildren ? 
 Does their daughter get along well with her in-laws ? 
 Do they have a large family ? 
 Is Bob home ? 
 When you are in a restaurant and you want the waiter to bring the bill , what do you do to attract his attention ? 
 I went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and I noticed that many people shouted for the bill . 
 That ’ s what I thought . I just thought I ’ d ask you and see what you thought of it . Anyway , what did you do yesterday evening ? 
 Did you ? How is he these days ? 
 I need to move some furniture . Could you help me to lift it ? 
 Let ’ s move the sofa . Can you get a grip on the bottom at that end ? I ’ ll lift this end . I want to move it sideways in that direction . 
 Well , I've always used the Bank Book , but now I have this card . I don't know how to use it in the machine . 
 Yes , I sure can . I feel like a dinosaur with all of these youngsters and their electronics . This machine is working , then ? 
 Oh , it wants me to put in my PIN number . OK , I can do that ... 
 There are so many to choose from . I didn't know you could do all of this using a card . 
 Hello , I would like to apply for a permit . 
 No , I left it in the car . 
 One moment while I go and get my ID . 
 Okay , here's my ID and the $ 27 . 
 Do you have a pen that I can use ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Steven , what's your idea of price ? 
 I'm afraid that's impossible . You can't expect us to reduce it to that extent . 
 Price can't be separated from quality . A comparison of the quality of our products with that of rival goods will show you that ours is far superior . 
 Well , I'll have to think about it and get back to you in about 30 minutes . 
 Do you have experience in advertising ? 
 What were you mean duties there ? 
 What qualities do you think an advertising planner should have ? 
 What was the most important thing you have learned at work ? 
 Did you say that Ted was at your mercy ? 
 But he is not someone who can be led by the nose . 
 You didn't come to work yesterday.What happened ? 
 What's wrong with him ? 
 Is he getting better now ? 
 He got the scholarship to Harvard . 
 It's true . He is a hard worker . 
 Evening , table for three , please . 
 Yes , I do . I have made reservations under the name of Wang . 
 No smoking , please . Could we have table by the window ? 
 I didn ’ t receive an unemployment check this week and need to know why . 
 I am afraid that I forgot to send it in . 
 Is it too late to mail the Continued Claim Form in now ? 
 I will mail it in a little early next time to avoid this problem . 
 Will my paycheck arrive late because I messed up on my form ? 
 I am considering going for the new job that was posted yesterday . 
 It may not be the best choice for me , but I am considering it . 
 I believe that this job would allow me to move up but might be a little boring for me . 
 Also , the matter of pay is also a consideration . 
 Yes , sometimes giving up a little to move forward is the best choice . 
 Can you help me with my timesheet ? 
 No , I don't know where to find one . 
 Yes , I can do that . 
 No , I don't know what that is . 
 Yes , I understand how to do this . 
 That was easy ! 
 Karen , do you have a minute ? I'd like to ask you about something . 
 I think you can give me some advice.You have worked here longer , and I just want to know what you think . 
 I am worried about the meeting this morning . 
 Really ? 
 I'm afraid I was too rude . 
 Well , I maybe talked to Mr . Drummond too directly . I thought I maybe said too much . I don't want him to be angry . 
 Really ? 
 But I am new here , and I'm not sure he is used to that . 
 Yes . And he is the president of the company . 
 I am very happy to hear that , Karen.It ' s good to know I'm working in such a company . 
 Good . Thank you for telling me this . 
 have you ever been invited to a Chinese feast ? 
 as far as you could see , is dining at a Chinese table a distinct experience ? To what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ? 
 but you look quite proficient in using them now . 
 yes , table etiquette . There are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . Some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to Westerners , while they are the norm i 
 maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . They resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . It's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present . 
 Welcome to China , Mr . Smith . 
 I heard that you are interested in our silk skirts and new style of coats . 
 Great ! B , most of the items listed are available this year . I hope we can come to an agreement and sign the contracts , so as to enable our timely delivery . 
 What's the proposal ? 
 Good idea ! In this way , our clients ' needs will be met and disagreements between the two parties avoided . 
 This is our best product . 
 They'll be done before the end of the week . 
 Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 Right now fight BW159 is the only one available , it is a non-direct one . 
 It departs at 4:40 pm tomorrow and arrives in Sydney at 10:20 am . the next morning by way of Melboume . 
 About 1 hour . Would you buy it ? 
 hello ? 
 good morning . 
 oh . I had hoped she would have called me back yesterday . 
 is there someone else I can talk to ? 
 any time after 2 pm today would be good for me . 
 I'd prefer to speak with Ms . Fonda . 
 that will be fine . 
 Oh , boy , I hate to say this , but I really have to leave now . 
 I ’ m so sorry . 
 Hello ? 
 I ’ Ve no idea . Nothing really . 
 Wonderful . 
 I ’ ll be ready . 
 Good morning , Ms.Wilson . I've got a lot to learn from you . I think I'll enjoy working with you . 
 Thank you . 
 I see.What if the person wanted is out ? 
 Is there anything else I should do ? 
 All right . 
 Thank you . 
 I really want to stay a little longer , but I still have a meeting to attend . All in all , I am so impressed by your hospitality and your warm welcome . Thank you for the trouble you have taken . 
 During my trip here , I learned a lot and I get to know our choice of choosing your company as our partner is definitely right . I can feel and sense the potential of your company . And at last I wish our further cooperation will be sound and successful . 
 Of course , I will . 
 And this espresso looks like ... oil ! 
 These days , I can't think of anything but motor oil . Even coffee makes me think of it . 
 Good afternoon , Mr.Chen . How are you ? 
 How much do you want , Mr.Chen ? 
 The rate is still high for other foreign currencies . The exchange rate for Hong Kong dollars into Renminbi is 1.053 Renminbi yuan to one dollar . 
 Certainly , sir . How do you want it ? 
 Yes , Mr.Chen . Here you are . 
 Kate , you never believe what's happened . 
 Masha and Hero are getting divorced . 
 Well , I don't really know , but I heard that they are having a separation for 2 months , and filed for divorce . 
 Masha , it seems quiet and makable , no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out . 
 Early in the New Year I guess . 
 Yes , I do . I find it very informative.It always has plenty of articles from correspondents all over the world and the business section is very useful too . 
 Yes . There is . it has several sections , so it ’ s quite a read ! It usually takes me a few hours to read it on Sunday morning . 
 Let me see . There ’ s the news section , the entertainment section , sports , business , and world affairs . 
 World affairs ? They look at the most important stories in more detail . I find it fascinating . Do you buy a daily paper ? 
 I really should be on my way . 
 No , thank you . I can ’ t . 
 Thank you very much . I had a really good time . 
 That would be great ! Actually , can I get your phone number , Ella ? That ’ s assuming you don ’ t mind if I call you sometime . 
 ok , got it . I ’ ll call you sometime next week . 
 It ’ s time to go and I hope we can get together again soon . 
 I'll need a parking permit for next semester . 
 I only attend class part-time in the evenings . 
 I have both , but I usually use my car to get to school . 
 I'll pay cash . 
 No , thank you . 
 I want to ask you for a favor . I want to rent an apartment here in Beijing , but as a foreigner , I don't know the normal practice . Can you give me some advice ? 
 I am a student and want to live in Haitian , so that I can live close to my school . I like to play soccer and I like a quiet apartment so I can study . 
 That sounds great ! 
 Thank you so much . That's very kind of you . 
 Will you wake me up in the morning ? 
 At 7 am sharp . 
 I am studying at Beijing University . I major in Civil Law . 
 Because Beijing University is the best university in China and I'm sure I am one of the best students . 
 I have learned many courses , such as Civil Law , Economic Law , Commercial Law and Administration Law . 
 Civil Law . Because it is broad and profound , and furthermore , it best reflects the spirits of fairness and equality . 
 Psychology . 
 No , I didn't . 
 I think these patterns are quite good . Can you give me a price indication of these ? 
 Thank you very much . If your price is suitable , then we can make further discussion of contract . 
 Very good . How many goods do you have ? 
 We want to order 900 dozen . 
 How do you think the report I wrote ? 
 I jumped the gun . 
 Yes , I overlooked some facts . I ’ ll be more sorrow . 
 How old is he ? 
 Congratulations on your success in the competition . That is quite something . 
 I think luck played a very small part in your victory . It is solely due to your hard work and efforts . That brings honor to you and joy to us . 
 It is real word . 
 Can you help me find my books ? 
 Oh , I see . Thank you . 
 Yes , she's been like this for two weeks . 
 So am I.The doctor says she'll get over in a month . 
 maybe that's why some young chaps often spend a whole afternoon in a coffee bar , surfing the net or just typewriting something with laptop . While they are savoring a coffee at a leisured pace , they 
 then what about tea ? We need to bear in mind in the first place that tea , rather than coffee , has been the most popular drink for the Chinese people . 
 what a pity that the traditional teahouses , as depicted Lao She , keep fading away so quickly in this metropolis . It is not easy to find an old-fashioned teahouse that suits the ordinary people's spend 
 Hi , I would like to return this TV . 
 Yeah here you go . Actually I also want to return this keyboard . 
 The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear . 
 I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work . 
 Fine ! I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways . 
 Can you describe it , sir ? 
 Is this case yours ? 
 What about this one ? This one's got a label . 
 What's you name and address ? 
 That's right . D.N.Hall . 83.Bridge Street . Three pound and fifty pence please . 
 Thank you . 
 What ’ s the matter ? 
 Great . The bed is exactly what I have been looking for ! 
 Oh , I like red wood . How much do you charge for it ? 
 That's sheer robbery ! 
 It's more than I can afford . Can I make an offer ? 
 Shall we make it 250 dollars ? 
 What about 260 dollars ? 
 It's a deal . 
 Hello . Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Certainly , I'll be very happy to help you . Usually we offer current or fixed accounts for individuals . 
 If you open a fixed account , the interest rate is higher . 
 You may withdraw the money at any time . You just need to present your deposit book . 
 OK . Do you have your ID card on you ? 
 Good . Everything is done . Here is your deposit book and ID card . 
 It's my pleasure . 
 Good afternoon . My name is Monica . I am here for the job interview at 2 PM . 
 Done . Here is my paper . 
 What about the 3rd round ? 
 How are your Chinese and English ? 
 How would you consider your salary if you succeed in becoming a translator in our company ? 
 I wonder if you agree that money is not happiness . 
 Then how do you explain so many rich people committing suicide ? 
 Shall we go to the library by subway ? 
 OK . There is no subway in my city . 
 Yes . Does it operate night and day ? 
 Where do we pay the fare ? 
 Do I have to pay an additional fare to change trains ? 
 OK , I see . 
 Of course . Which one do you like best ? 
 Try this one . You can get a picture by simply pressing the shutter . 
 Jenny , you look terrible . What's eating you ? 
 Hey , Chillon , I'm just trying to help . 
 So , what's the problem ? 
 No kidding ! Didn't you study for it ? 
 That's too bad , anyway , I'm sure things will turn around next master . 
 You can't do that , Jenny ! 
 Come on , let's talk about it . 
 Yes , I noticed that . To what extent would local assembly help sales , did you say ? 
 Yes , of course . Assembly would be quite a simple matter . Cycle dealers could put them together in a very short time . 
 Yes , I've noticed that . Where have you been placing them ? 
 Yes . What were they ? Anything that will help sales ? 
 That's to keep the price down , I suppose . I'll take it up with our overseas department and listen to what they've got to say about this . 
 Good morning.Are you Mr.Liu ? 
 How do you do ? Please be seated , How is your trip here ? 
 Oh , yes.How old are you ? 
 Hum , still a student ? 
 What subjects are you studying ? 
 Have you had any working experience . 
 What do you like to do in your spare time ? 
 How are your English and computer skills ? 
 Okay . Mr.Liu , we'll inform you of the results within a week . 
 Yeah , the doctor said that I can leave soon . I really miss home . 
 Yeah , you are right . But I have to stay for another day for observation . 
 No , thanks . I am very grateful that you can come to the hospital to visit me . 
 Good morning . 
 What does the paper say ? 
 Well , what ’ s the weather report ? 
 Did they find those bank robbers ? 
 What about the sports page ? What were the scores of last night ’ s games ? 
 What time is it , Tom ? 
 Is it ? I have no idea if I ’ m so late . I must be off now . 
 I must catch the nine-thirty Train . 
 When can we expect you for dinner ? Can you come tonight ? 
 Well ... How about Friday then ? 
 Good . Shall we say seven o'clock ? 
 That'll be for you to decide . I've got a new dish that I want to try out on you . 
 I need a haircut . 
 No , I don't . You look pretty busy today . Do you have an opening for me ? 
 Just a haircut . I washed my hair this morning . 
 Well , I last had a haircut eight weeks ago . So my hair is pretty long.But I want the same style . 
 Alright . You are the expert . I'm happy to have your recommendation . 
 Fine . 
 Yes . 
 Yes , I know my hair is quite thin.It runs in my family . Everybody has very thin hair . 
 I don't know what to do about it . 
 Do you sell conditioner here ? 
 Great . I would be happy to try it . I know my hair doesn't look good now . It's too weak . 
 Good morning , sir . Are you Mr . Wang , the personnel manager ? 
 No , you don ’ t . My name is Liu Lili . I got the information from the TV that your department wants to hire a clerk , who will work under you . I would like to apply for the job . 
 OK . I ’ m 24 this year . I earned my college diploma from the Night College of Foreign Languages Institute in 2010 . My major is English . Recently I ’ Ve also earned my degree in Secretarial Technology . 
 Of course . I ’ Ve been working as an office clerk in the Textile Company since my graduation . I do a lot of things , such as typing , handling the daily correspondence , arranging meetings and so on . 
 To be frank , not very much , because I can ’ t use much what I ’ Ve learned in my work . I enjoy doing more challenging work . 
 Of course . First of all , she must have a strong sense of responsibility . 
 She must be an honest person . 
 She must also be diligent and do a lot of things on her own initiative . 
 Well , no . But I took related courses . I can gain experience quickly . I ’ m sure I can do the job well . 
 I need to return a book . 
 I want to check this magazine out . 
 Why not ? 
 So what am I allowed to check out ? 
 I need to check out this magazine . 
 That doesn ’ t make any sense . 
 I'm not at all keen on that sort of job.It makes me crazy . 
 You have to type all day . 
 What kind of movie is it ? I don ’ t like many of his movies , actually . 
 I like thrillers and I like Julia Roberts , so it might be interesting . I read a review today and the critic didn ’ t seem to be very impressed . 
 He didn ’ t say it was bad , but he said that it wasn ’ t as good as it could have been , particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it . 
 Good . Dinner is nearly ready and I ’ d like to watch the news before we go . The Oscars were last night and I want to see the results . 
 I lost track of time , am I late ? 
 My friend needed me to help him . 
 I will try . My apologies . 
 Sure , I'll sit right here . 
 I am confused about the projected revenues . 
 I'm really mad at Bob . 
 Bob returned from Japan last week . You know that ? 
 I think so , too . 
 They have moved to Chicago . 
 Mr.Smith has changed his job . 
 I don ’ t know where to get my ballot . 
 How can you help me ? 
 That ’ s great . 
 Here it is . 
 What do I do now ? 
 All right . Thanks for your help . 
 How do you do ? 
 Excuse me . Can you take me to the airport ? 
 Kennedy Airport . 
 Thank you , but I'd rather keep this case with me . 
 Mike , this is Leo in Sales . I was just calling to confirm our meeting tomorrow.Are we still on ? 
 OK . See you at your office at 2:30 . 
 Who finances the magazine ? 
 Does it have a large circulation ? 
 Mike , did you win the lottery or something ? Why the big smile ? 
 You did ? That's great ! You must be very happy now ? 
 Did you tell your parents yet ? 
 They're probably going to be so happy . 
 Do you know which bus I can take to PCC ? 
 I live on Las Flores and Fair Oaks . 
 I'm okay with walking . 
 Do you know which direction it should be heading ? 
 Which stop do I get off on ? 
 Thank you for telling me . 
 Would you like me to type it for you ? 
 Not at all . I ’ ll be glad to do it . 
 Shall I right out again first ? 
 Can I print it ? 
 I've heard that you've made a new strange friend recently , Sophie . 
 So you can learn a lot from him . 
 Hi , Jack . Long time no see ! 
 Not bad . At least I am still alive . 
 Where did you get that idea ? 
 You are right . I am not boasting , but she is really as beautiful as she is intelligent . 
 Sorry to trouble you . Can you tell me how to get to the City Bank ? 
 How long will it take if I walk ? 
 Hello , Jill . 
 Fine , only a little tired . 
 Thank you very much for looking after my house in my absence . 
 Yes , Please.It ' s very kind of you . 
 The rooms are very tidy and the flowers grew very well.You are very helpful . I want to thank you for everything you've done for me . 
 I bought you some books on literature , I don't know if you would like them . 
 Not at all . 
 Yeah . I saw a science program . It was quite interesting . 
 Mars . Scientists say there might be water on it . 
 I hope so . Did you know the US successfully sent two robotic explorers to Mars last month ? 
 Yes . Both have sent back pictures of the planet . And the latter did a better job . 
 OK . What time ? 
 It's 60 yuan , please . 
 Sure . That'll be 40 yuan , please . 
 Can I bring you anything else ? 
 Let me get this . 
 Are you sure ? 
 All right . If you insist . Next time it is on me , though . 
 Hello ? Can you help me ? My computer ! Oh man ... 
 I turned on my laptop and it broke ! I mean , the monitor went black ! 
 I don ’ t feel sick , ... let me check ... Nope ! No fever , I ’ m fine . 
 Phew ! . . . Wait a minute , CRASH ? ? ! ! Spyware ? Trojans ! What ? where ? when ? ! 
 Why do you need to leave early ? 
 What doesn ’ t feel right ? 
 Perhaps you should get checked out at the Student Health Center before you go home . 
 Are you going to be OK to drive home , or would you like someone to go with you ? 
 We hope that you are feeling better soon . E-mail me if you have any questions . 
 Duh ! I would say yes ! Eric is the most popular kid in school ! Okay , my turn . What would you do if you won the lottery ? 
 If you buy me a ticket I will go with you for sure ! 
 Alright this is a good one . What would your mom say if you told her you are going to get married ? 
 Anything else I can do for you ? 
 OK , here you are.Anything else ? 
 You can buy a money order and mail mature immigration . 
 Please fill out the form for the money order.You also need to pay a one dollar fee . 
 You're welcome.Have a nice day . 
 Would you mind helping us take a picture ? 
 Just focus on us and press the button . 
 Good afternoon . Thank you for the opportunity to interview for this position . 
 Actually , I am very familiar with the area so there was absolutely no problem . 
 I am interested in switching fields . 
 I am good at pulling together teams of people to accomplish a task . 
 I am impatient with myself at times and am hard on myself . 
 Can I see the doctor ? 
 No , I don't . 
 Well , I am spending my vacation here and I have a stomachache and ... 
 I ’ d prefer to see him asap . If I have to wait for another 30 mins , I think I will faint from this unbearable pain in my stomach and ... 
 No , not for this country . 
 No , I didn't think I ’ d need it . 
 Cash , credit card , cheque anything . I just have to see a doctor . I am in pain . 
 I know . I am sorry that I yelled at you . 
 I'm rather hungry now . 
 Please give me a piece of pie first . 
 Beef , please . 
 Coffee , please . 
 Only black coffee . 
 OK , what style do you want ? 
 What about this one ? It fits you . 
 You look kind of green . 
 Have you had anything to eat lately ? 
 Perhaps the food was bad . 
 Has anything been upsetting you lately ? 
 Do you think that maybe you are getting the flu ? 
 It's my wife's birthday . I need to buy some flowers for her . 
 How much will the roses be ? 
 Now , that's a price that I like . 
 Okay , I'll take the roses . 
 No , the roses are good enough . 
 Craig , what do you do for work ? 
 What school do you go to ? 
 That's a good school . What do you study ? 
 How long have you been studying English ? 
 That's a long time .

 What movie did you want to see ? 
 I was thinking that I would like to see “ The Secret Life of Bees . ” 
 Jenny , do you want to go to see a movie ? 
 I want to see ' Click . ' 
 I don't know . My friend told me it was a touching movie . 
 Yes . My only recreation is skateboarding . 
 Maybe . But it emphasizes participation and a spirit of courage , and can give one the extreme sense of cheerfulness and success . I'm getting to like the game more and more . 
 I am afraid not . Are there any vacant tables ? 
 That's all right . 
 Yes . I am sure I can . I was an English major in college . 
 Russian is my second foreign language and I excelled the rest of my class in Russian because my father is a Russian .

 Why , this is the most interesting film ! 
 But it's only a film . 
 Sure , honey , we ’ re talking now , aren ’ t we ? 
 Yeah . I know . 
 You know , I think you ’ re awesome . 
 Honey ... 
 Baby , I love you so much . 
 I love you . And I think you ’ re awesome . 
 Come on . Put the gun down . 
 Excuse me , can I deposit valuables here ? 
 Here is the bag . Is that free ? 
 For two days . 
 Sit down here - don't put any pressure on it . I'd better call the company doctor . 
 Yes , it looks interesting . 
 It must be old . 
 Let's enter it ! 
 It must be locked . 
 She can't answer you . 
 It must be a haunted house.Are you frightened ? 
 Are you ready to go to the mall ? 
 Copycat ! 
 You went out and bought khakis , too ! 
 Whatever . 
 That's correct . 
 And we got a 50 thousand dollar ticket for construction workers peeing off the roof . 
 See , I just told you he hit a deer . Man , I knew you weren ’ t listening to me . 
 Nothing ? 
 You and Patricia got engaged , didn ’ t you ? You can tell me .

 Yes , we have insurance against old age , medical problems , unemployment , work injury and childbirth . 
 Insurance against old age , medical problems , unemployment will be paid by both the company and you , and the others by the company .

 Oh , she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use English throughout the class.She doesn't mind your making mistakes , though . 
 I really like the way this house looks . 
 The landscaping is wonderful ! 
 Oh , I see what you mean ! 
 I love the sage green carpeting with the sunset-colored walls .

 I really like the Jacuzzi bathtub in the bathroom . 
 Here we are . This is Wangfujing Street . 
 25 yuan , please . 
 Thank you . Here ’ s your change and receipt . 
 The day before yesterday . I only visited Montreal and Ottawa , but I had a great time . 
 That's hard to say ... I think Ottawa is prettier.It has better sightseeing , too . A lot of museums and galleries . 
 Montreal is more exciting . It has better shopping.The stores are cheaper and more interesting . 
 Oh , Montreal of sure . It has more restaurants and clubs.They say Montreal is the most exciting city in Canada . 
 Oh . I just wanted you to shut up . You were off-key anyway . Let me see that ! 
 What a cool see-through blue ! How do you wear this thing ? 
 How do I turn it on ? 
 I'm out of work at the moment . 
 I was fired last week . 
 It doesn't matter . 
 After the tour I'll have a rest . And then go to find a new job . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , here you are . Would you care to order now , Sir ? 
 Any vegetable ? 
 OK . Can I serve you anything else ? 
 All right .

 Are you kidding me ? Why do you say so ? 
 OK . Let me see where to start . 
 Sure . You should include your name , address and phone number in your resume . 
 Your job objectives , of course . In other words , what kind of job are you searching for ? 
 Yes . And don't forget to list them by date . Besides , you should begin with the most recent and then move backward . 
 No , it's also necessary to list a few related interests that are in some way connected to the jobs you want to take . 
 You said it . At last you ’ d better attach a list of references to your resume . 
 And one more thing , smile widely . 
 Hey ! I learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns ! 
 Whatever ... Smell ! Perfume samples ! 
 You mean , you like the pictures of the beautiful models ... Hello ? 
 I ’ ll be glad to . But my schedule is super tight this week . I think the only time I have free is at lunch on Wednesday . 
 All right , then . I ’ ll see you at noon on Wednesday . 
 One to the beach . How much is it ? 
 Sorry . I can wait a moment . 
 Thank you . 
 Almost , let me just put my apron on . 
 Got it . 
 Do I have to use a whisk or can I use the electric mixer ? 
 OK , so now we need a baking pan right ? 
 Done . So how long do we bake it for ? 
 Wow ! This was a lot easier than I thought ! 
 I will tell you ahead of time , that there is a lot to sign here , but I will help you every step of the way . 
 Basically , what I need from you now is your driver ’ s license or some ID that shows your residency status . 
 We will be going through these papers one by one . I will be explaining them all to you , and you can ask questions as we go . 
 We do not want you to sign any documents that you do not understand . You may get assistance with any questions that you have . 
 This is the last thing you need to do , but it may take a while for the papers to be processed . 
 All right . I'm nearly ready.What time does the bus leave ? 
 Oh , we've got plenty of time . 
 All right.Let ' s go . 
 Good afternoon , miss , can I help you ? 
 It ’ s certainly a pretty dress . I can ring you up at the register over here . 
 Will you be paying by cash , check , or credit card ? 
 Sorry , no . We only take MasterCard or Visa . 
 Very well , ma ’ am . Oh , there seems to be a problem , it says it ’ s rejected . 
 Alright . Thank you . Yes , it seems to be working fine . Your total is $ 199.00 , sign here , please . 
 Here you go , and here ’ s your receipt . Have a nice day . 
 Good day to you . How can I be of service today ? 
 I see . Well , this bank offers many different accounts of this nature . There are 7 to choose from 
 Well , you could change your Australian dollars into , say British pounds and then open an account . How does that sound ? 
 Where do these flower vases come from ? 
 Are they breakable ? 
 No wonder it's so expensive . 
 Yes , sir . Most of us had positive review in last quarter . Take Fred and David for examples . Both of them try their best to achieve the best . Their progress is distinct , especially in last quarter . 
 All these say a lot for their characters . 
 Room service.What can I do for you ? 
 There is a laundry form in your room ars well as a bag.Fill out the form and put them together with the laundry in the bag.The maid will come and pick it up . 
 Excuse me , sir . Can I help you ? 
 I haven't got enough for prosecuting him . 
 I'm just thinking about that , but the trouble is , I don't know who is well in the know . 
 Thanks for reminding me . She's the right person to help me . 
 Congratulations ! 
 No . But I am going to apply for some vocational schools . I like fashion design and want to study it . 
 How old are you ? 
 Hello , stewardess . Could you bring me a blanket ? I feel so cold . 
 I'd like a pillow as Well . 
 Do you think they two will get married ? 
 I think so.Yes , they get along so well . 
 You're right . He sure is . 
 But where do I get a ticket ? 
 Oh , I wish I didn ’ t have so much to carry . 
 Speaking . 
 Of course . How're you ? 
 I'm sorry , Karen , but I can't . I have to work late this Thursday . 
 Yeah . I really like Lesley . 
 Well , I can't make it on Friday either , but I'm free on Saturday night . What time does it start ? 
 That sounds perfect.And let's go out for coffee after the show . 
 See you at seven fifteen , Saturday . 
 I think so , but how should we write it ? 
 Yes , it should be so . Then we should write the body and in the body we should mention the place where we saw the job advertisement . 
 We should write our skills and let the company know we are competent for the job . 
 Oh , you have recommended yourself very well . I should think about how to recommend myself as well . 
 Yes . At the end , we should conclude the letter with greetings . 
 Are you ready to order ? May I suggest a veal . 
 The chicken is also nice . 
 Our special tonight is lobster . 
 Perhaps you'd enjoy the lamb 
 What ever you say ? 
 Yes.Do you have football stockings here ? 
 OK , I'll buy two pairs of each color.And do you have sports socks ? 
 OK , give me two pairs in white . 
 No.That ' s all . 
 Yes , here you are . 
 I'm the general manager of the Far-East Industry Corporation . 
 Yes , I have been invited by the East Import & Export Corporation of China for business talks . 
 Yes , I have some foreign currency to declare . 
 All right . 
 Not at all . The changing rooms are just this way . 
 Sure . I'll give you the next size up . That one is small , right ? 
 Well.It doesn't go with your skirt . I think the color itself is fine though . 
 I don't care as long as it's a Chinese restaurant . 
 I really find Chinese dishes more to my taste . 
 You could try shopping at a flea market . 
 A flea market is an outdoor place where people sell all kinds of used stuff . 
 Well , you can check the local paper or search ‘ flea market ' online . 
 What is it ? 
 Don't you like to know anything about stocks ? 
 Excuse me , could you tell me where I can get a shopping basket ? 
 Well , I can't find the way to the entrance . Would you tell me where the entrance is ? 
 Thank you very much . By the way , where are the vegetables ? 
 Come and sit down . Would you like a drink ? 
 Do you like olives ? Or would you prefer crisps ? 
 Do you like it ? It's Irish music . 
 Arm - I think it was in the CD shop in the Mall . Have you been there ? 
 Yes . Hey , I've got some photos of our holiday in Ireland . Would you like to see them ? 
 Do you really have to work today ? 
 But you'll miss out on the football game . 
 you are dressed to kill . You look gorgeous , Alexander . 
 how did you meet each other ? 
 is this your first date ? 
 sure it will . Oh , no , it's seven fifteen already . I'm going to be late for my date . 
 absolutely not ! He's a cheater . I will never talk to him again . I'm over with him . He's history ! 
 a guy I met on the internet three month ago . 
 please don't be so fussy ! I didn't just meet him yesterday . 
 Jack , you should have known in general the situation of our company now . 
 Do you have any other questions ? 
 OK , we will pay insurances for employees after the probationary period . 
 Include endowment insurance , medical insurance , unemployment insurance , work-related injury insurance and maternity insurance . 
 Employees will also have housing payment reserve funds . 
 Do you have other questions ? 
 The permanent staff can have a paid month-long vacation every year . Besides , they also get chances of free traveling . 
 Please show me the menu , Miss . 
 Yes . I'd like an Italian soup to start with and then some fried noodles . 
 Yes , I'd like another cup of coffee afterwards . Make it hot , please . 
 Did you check the internet for next week's weather forecast ? 
 Yes ! Somebody up there loves me ! I knew it wasn't too late for snow . 
 There have been so many dry winters lately that it's about time , don't you think ? 
 This will be the best ski trip I've ever taken . I can't wait to use my new hoard . 
 Can you believe her ? She is not even a hundred pounds and she is going off on how she wants to go on a diet . 
 Me too . But what are we going to do ? I have been on 4 different diets and I can't seem to lose weight . 
 What do you know ? You are over weight too . 
 I know . But I don't have someone to diet with . If we help each other and motivate each other , then I think we can lose some weight . 
 C'mon . You'll feel better and look better and as a reward you can eat a little bit of ice cream here and there . 
 It's a great idea . I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier . Going on a diet with a friend to back you up is a great way to succeed . 
 Great . I'll get our plan started right away . 
 Julia , I apologize to you for what I have done . Please forgive me . 
 It does ’ t matter . I know that people are easy to get mad when they're tired . 
 You're welcome . Happy couples need mutual understanding . 
 We'd better not move him . I'll get the first-aider . 
 I'll go take a shower . 
 The aroma of roasting coffee beans . 
 Green beans . They pop and turn brown when you roast them . 
 This machine roasts the beans just right . If you roast them too long , or the temperature is too hot ... 
 Saying you want to kill yourself , you terrified me out of my wits . 
 That ’ s too much . 
 Hey Sarah . Why are you limping ? 
 Was it your first time ? 
 I remember the first time I went . My back was sore , I couldn't sit down because it hurt my butt , and my legs would cramp if I walked too fast . 
 It's only like that the first couple of times . 
 You gotta give it a chance . It's fun after awhile . 
 Welcome to Super Stereos . What can I do for you ? 
 Yes , this system over here is on sale for $ 1,000 . As you can see , all of the components are brand-name . 
 Our selection of stereo systems with turntables is somewhat limited , but we do have this system over here . 
 He's 21 . How old is James ? 
 How's your father ? 
 He can spend more time with his grandchildren . 
 So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea ! 
 In the same way , probably . 
 My name is Han Ran , number is 050920 . 
 I ’ m from Living , Yunnan Province . 
 It's a very beautiful place in Southwest China . 
 Not very big . There are five of us — grandmother , father , mother , sister and I . 
 No . I'm still single . 
 I don't know . 
 Don't waste time . 
 But it's none of our business . 
 Winning is a piece of cake to me . 
 It's the latest and quite popular among young people . 
 Sure . Here is your receipt . 
 You can refund it in 7 days and exchange it in one year . 
 Can you enlarge the picture ? 
 I want it enlarged to 5 inches . 
 Everything's gone wrong . 
 What are we going to do now ? 
 What can I do for you ? 
 Is there a problem with your account ? 
 What about all your money in that account ? 
 That ’ s fine . 
 Would you like to make a withdrawal ? 
 I ’ ll just cancel your account right now . 
 Hi , I ’ d like to have my phone turned on , please . 
 345 Lincoln Avenue . Oklahoma City . 
 John Smith . 
 Very well . 
 Fifteen minutes ? I ’ m sorry , but I ’ ll have to call back . I need to get back to work . 
 Steven , it's ten o'clock . I'm going to bed . I'm beat . 
 Oh , can't you do it tomorrow ? It's already past 10 . 
 Okay . Please close the door to the basement before you go to bed . I don't want the dog down there tonight . 
 Good night . 
 Here , Ma ’ am please get on the stretcher . 
 Calm down , sir . We ’ ll call her to make sure she ’ s on the way . 
 How long has she been in labor ? 
 O . K . Are you planning on being in the delivery room , sir ? 
 Please follow the nurse . She ’ ll get you ready . 
 I'm interested in applying for a credit card with you . 
 Yes , I've had a Current Account with a debit card with you for years . Now , I'm looking at upgrading to a credit card . 
 When I opened the account with you , I was a student , I graduated a couple of years ago and have a steady salary , so I figured now would be the best time to go ahead . 
 As you can see from the statements for my Current Account , I have never been overdrawn . I'm always very careful about that . 
 I thought you were going to let it grow out long . 
 You're in one of those in-between stages , aren't you . 
 Have you thought about wearing a hat ? 
 Well , it's one way to get through the in-betweens if you really want to grow it out ! 
 Oh , I am sorry . I ’ m afraid I can ’ t do it now . I have to meet my supervisor in a few seconds . But I could mail it after that . 
 I won ’ t . 
 Don ’ t mention it . See you . 
 Well , Jim . It is a combination of how much you eat , the type of food you eat , and when you eat your meals . 
 That's a big mistake , you should always have a good breakfast . You will not run your car without fuel , and yet you won't expect your body to work without food . 
 I bet you eat a large evening meal , then sit and watch TV or read a book . Then instead of burning off your energy , your body stores it as fat . 
 Well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits . 
 Hello , Tom . I'm really glad to meet you here . 
 I'm so surprised , B . Why did you decide to end your marriage suddenly ? 
 I didn't know that . I thought that you were happy together . 
 I can't believe it . But if you both determine to divorce , I hope you will have an amicable split . 
 Hello , Tom . I'm really glad to meet you here . 
 I'm so surprised , B . Why did you decide to end your marriage suddenly ? 
 I didn't know that . I thought that you were happy together . 
 I can't believe it . But if you both determine to divorce , I hope you will have an amicable split . 
 How time flies ! We have been in Beijing for almost 4 years . 
 yeah , feels like yesterday . Now I ’ m almost settled down here . We ’ re planning to buy an apartment and tie the knot . 
 thank you . Is your company going to move to other cities ? 
 why is that ? 
 yeah , the hustle and bustle is really difficult to handle . 
 I understand your position . Perhaps it ’ s time to stop floating and go back to where you belong . You ’ ll feel much better with your family around . 
 Would you consider an offer of $ 56,000 per year ? 
 Our standard package includes health insurance , two weeks vacation and a company car . 
 Uh ... not normally . What do you have in mind ? 
 What an interesting idea , Ms . Wilson . Would you also be willing to accept a cut in initial salary ? 
 What seems to be the problem ? 
 Has this been a problem before ? 
 For how long ? 
 Do you only feel this way when you stomach is empty ? 
 Do you feel nauseous ? 
 Do you have regular bowel movements ? 
 Let me take a look at your abdomen . Lie down on your back and bend your knees up . OK . relax ... Alright , it seems like you have a duodenal ulcer , but we'll have to run some tests before I can be certain . You should get a good rest first and try not to strain your stomach too much . 
 Not too serious , but it'll take you some time to recover , so you'll need to be patient . 
 No , sir . 
 I'm sorry . I did not know that . 
 Can't you give me a warning ? 
 How much will the fine be ? 
 I have to go to court over a brake light ? 
 Can I have the ticket , please ? 
 Is that right ? I hear all these horror stories of internet business crashing because there is not enough of a customer base yet . How can you be sure your idea will cash in ? 
 That's marketing research ... But what about getting started once you have an idea ? 
 Sounds like a lot of work ! 
 Ann , stop bugging Jess and help me order something new . Lattes are so passe these days . 
 Sounds a little weak . 
 Sounds better , but I hope it doesn't inspire me to take a hammer to the client's head . 
 We're on the same team here , Elvin . I'm being nice because we need to get along together . 
 If we want to beat WebTracker , we're going to have to work hand in hand . 
 You'd rather lose to WebTracker than do things my way ? 
 what sort of music do you like ? 
 so , you're into 80s music then ? 
 I like alternative music . 
 to be honest , no . I'm always in search of new music to listen to . 
 I usually go to see a live band about twice a month . What about you ? 
 there's an open mic night at the pub down the road every Thursday night where my favorite local band usually plays . You should come along next week with me . 
 that's too bad . Maybe another time . 
 I'll let you know . Did you want to watch some TV ? 
 there's a reality TV show about a group of people who are trying to lose weight . 
 Morning , Tom . 
 You seem to be in a hurry . 
 Okay . I won ’ t hold you up then . 
 See you later . 
 Ten more minutes , mom . 
 It's already 3 8 o'clock . 
 I want to get a bite to eat . 
 I have no idea what I want . 
 I wouldn't mind getting some Chinese food . 
 I'm not sure . 
 Do they do a good job on the food ? 
 I think I will get my food from Panda Express , too . 
 Sorry , they are too busy these days . 
 Yes , I think so . 
 Why don't you run outside ? 
 Yeah , I suppose . I guess it isn't healthy to run in this weather . 
 Wait for me a minute . I'll go over to the gym too . 
 Yes , why not ? Just let me get my gym clothes together . 
 What do you mean by that ? Everyone can exercise ! 
 No , not at all . I was on the swimming team in high school.And I'd like to do some weight training . They have decent equipment at that gym . 
 Are you laughing at me ? 
 Maybe not . But I want to start . I need to get in shape . I feel these past couple months that my energy is low . 
 So I need to do something too . 
 I know . But I want to start today with a little weight lifting.Then I'm going to buy a new swimming suit and goggles , and every other day I'm going to go swim laps in the pool . How does that sound ? 
 What ? 
 Mr . Chen , I have a Marry from realty world on line one . 
 OK , I'll take a message . 
 This is Action 5 News reporter Sarah O ’ Connell reporting live from Washington , D . C . where a protest has broken out . Thousands of angry citizens are protesting against the proposed bailout of the auto manufacturing industry ! Sir , sir , Sarah O ’ Connell , Action 5 news . Can you tell us what ’ s happening ? 
 Sir but what exactly is making everyone so angry ? 
 I see . But , many supporters of the bailout argue that it could help save the jobs of millions of hardworking Americans . 
 Good point . This is Sarah O ’ Connell reporting live from Washington D . C . , back to you , Tom . 
 Yes , I packed it myself , and it hasn ’ t been out of my possession . 
 No . 
 Not at all . Go right ahead . 
 It ’ s traditional Chinese Medicine . I mix it with hot water like tea . Sorry . I forgot about it . 
 Oh no ! I forgot about those too ! Those are Chinese sausages for my Aunt Lily . 
 Mom , when you come home , please buy a coat , a skirt , a sweater ... 
 Lucy , you ’ re back . How was your first day of school ? 
 What classes did you have ? 
 What do you think about the teachers ? 
 That ’ s too bad . How was your English teacher ? 
 Where is she from ? 
 Were you able to understand everything that she said ? 
 She sounds like a good teacher . Do you think you ’ ll pass her class ? 
 What does that mean ? 
 If you like the class this much already , I ’ m sure you will . 
 did she give you any homework ? 
 no wonder you like the class so much . 
 Don ’ t mention it . It ’ s my pleasure . Have you been to one of these large , sit-down dinner parties since you got to New Haven ? 
 Cookouts often start slowly . A two o ’ clock start means you arrive any time after two . 
 I was late getting back from the mall , but I ’ m hurrying . 
 Don ’ t worry . We won ’ t be the first . 
 i like my professors and the classes , but it's a lot of work . 
 right now , I'm doing some research into the languages of different African tribes . 
 yes , I learned how to speak it when I was little . 
 well , I grew up in Africa , so I learned quite a few different languages . 
 I don't know because I haven't received my test results yet . 
 about two weeks ago . 
 I left feeling pretty confident about my score , but I heard that my professors are very strict graders , so I'm a bit nervous . 
 You know me ; I'm always studying ! 
 Thanks for the vote of confidence , Justin ! 
 Certainly . Mr . Graham . When would you like to meet ? 
 Fine . At 3:30 ? 
 Is that so ? 
 Have you decided ? 
 Could you tell me why you want to quit ? 
 Oh , that sounds terrible . Would you be happier with higher pay here ? I'm sure something can be worked out . 
 OK . I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you.However , I think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay . 
 Sure . We love each other and take care of each other . 
 My grandpa . He has the final word about almost everything . My grandpa is “ President , ” and Grandma is “ Vice-President . ” My parents , uncles and aunts try to arrive at a consensus on important questions . 
 No . Not anymore.Mine is highly educated but traditional family . Most South Korea families today are a lot smaller . In traditional families , the old people are well respected and taken good care of . Ho 
 Of course there'll be a room for you ! 
 Yours is a modern family . I'm sure your dad loves you and would want you to stay for the summer . You just need to try your best to get along with your new stepmother and her boys . 
 It will be a new experience , and you might as well learn to adjust to changes . 
 It is good to have goals in life . If California doesn't work out , come and visit me in Korea , OK ? 
 We could share a room ! It would be fun . And we could do some traveling around Korea . You could see for yourself what life in a big family is like ! 
 Are you going to take the job ? 
 Do you see the woman ? Is she a teacher ? 
 Does she teach Chinese ? 
 And who ’ s the man in the green beside her ? 
 Do you like watching TV ? 
 What do you exactly mean by usually ? 
 Have you ever climbed the mountain before ? 
 Now your dream comes true . Do you know the altitude of the mountain ? 
 Do you mind if I sit here ? 
 What are you studying ? 
 Hello . Can you tell me what the procedures of applying for a job are ? 
 What is the qualification needed by the position ? 
 When should I come for work in the morning ? 
 When does the job start in the afternoon ? 
 I like the design of the coat . 
 Anyway , it's my ideal coat . I'll take it . 
 Welcome on board . May I see your boarding pass ? 
 Your seat is three , in the third row , near the window . 
 Either in the overhead compartment or underneath the seat . 
 Please come in ! 
 Oh , so nice of you to come here . Have a seat . Please make yourself at home . 
 Thank you . My wife would be very happy to hear this . 
 You bet . 
 Most people like football . More boys like football than girls . A few girls play it really well . Some people like playing basketball . 
 More and more people like it now . fewer people play table tennis than before . Many people like swimming , because it is fun and keeps you fit . 
 Extreme sports are only for a small minority of people . Several people from my university enjoy them , but most of us just watch . No one I know plays golf . 
 A great deal of people follow rugby in my country . 
 How does it fit ? 
 The price is on the tag . How would you like to pay ? 
 Yes , we do . 
 Here's your receipt . Thank you for shopping here and have a nice day . 
 We've been waiting here for nearly ten minutes now , and there still isn't a bus in sight . 
 Have you got the time , Tom ? 
 But you bought it only last month . 
 How long will it take us to get there ? 
 It's not far away , then . Let's walk , it's beginning to rain . 
 I can't believe Mr . Fro didn't buy it . Who does that guy think he is anyway ? Bill Gates ? 
 Time to order . Balista , today I want a skinny triple latte . 
 I'm not . I just don't feel like drinking whole milk today . Why ? Do you think I'm fat ? 
 Both our countries are quite small . How would you describe the landscape in your country ? 
 Is it really completely flat ? 
 Yes , there are . They are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries . 
 That doesn ’ t sound too bad . Great for sunbathing ! The coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . There are cliffs , then sandy beaches . Then rocks . There are lots of caves in the cliffs . 
 We also have waterfalls in the mountains . They make the landscapes look very scenic . The landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion , especially by water . 
 Thanks . Try not to work too hard while I ’ m away ! 
 Okay-bye ! Have a nice Christmas . 
 Oh , it ’ s almost eleven twenty . 
 You ’ re welcome . The rain is quite heavy , isn ’ t it ? 
 I have one . We could share it . Which way are you going ? 
 I am going there , too . We can walk together . 
 Hey , let's eat out tonight . 
 No . Just want to relax a little bit . You don't have to win the lottery to relax , do you ? 
 Come on . It's on me . 
 Don't be silly . I'll take you anywhere you wanna go . 
 Dream on ! 
 I always approach things very enthusiastically . When I begin something , I don ’ t like to leave it half-done . I can ’ t concentrate on something new until the first thing is finished . 
 Dishonesty . It ’ s unacceptable . 
 He looks strong.What does he do ? 
 He must be very brave . 
 Did you ever buy food from the snack stands near our hotel ? 
 How do you like them ? 
 I always have the temptation to eat something there . 
 I don't know how much we can trust them . Do you have any ideas ? 
 It doesn't taste good ? 
 That's my greatest concern . But how can you tell which one is clean ? 
 I got it . I think it's worth trying . 
 I'd like to try some kebab , roasted squid , and many different appealing things . 
 I see . Thank you . 
 Certainly . How do you like your room ? 
 $ 40 per night . 
 It can ’ t be time to get up yet . 
 What ’ s the time ? 
 My watch says ten past . 
 Are you sure half past seven ? 
 It ’ s only seven o ’ clock . Your watch is fast . 
 I could have stayed in bed for another half hour . 
 Sorry , not yet ! can you help me to select the dress ? i don , t what i should wear to fit thinner party . 
 How about transom ? 
 Oh , i nearly forget it . 
 Gosh , another stop.It seems the cars ahead of us have to stop every two minutes , It's no quicker than a bus . 
 It was silly of me to have taken a taxi . 
 No , from New Zealand , sir . I visited New Zealand and saw lots of overseas people there . 
 The more the world becomes open , the more people become international ! 
 But I ... I don't agree with thatbecause computers weaken kids'ability to thinkbecause kids don't learn basic skills . 
 They can't spell , they can't add , they can't subtract , they even don't remember any more . that's because they rely on gadgets . 
 Those guys work at the same company and go to the same bars . They do everything together . 
 I want to take a look at that home with the Open House flags out front . 
 Yes , that is one of the houses that we have on our list . 
 I am going to go sign my name in the registry to let the listing agent know that we were here . 
 I really appreciate that the listing agent provided water on such a hot day . 
 Is the current asking price listed on the flyer ? 
 I want to change rooms . In fact , I want a refund for tonight ! 
 Cockroaches have declared war on my room ! 
 Thank you for not asking me to collect the roaches in a jar as evidence . 
 Hello , this is Sunshine Trading Company . Can I help you ? 
 Great . Could you tell me something about cash control ? 
 Excuse me , would you mind taking a picture for us ? 
 It's simple . Just press the button , like this . 
 Thank you . 
 No . How about you ? 
 We're going dancing tonight . 
 Has the train come yet ? 
 It ’ s so unreliable . I ’ Ve been late for my meetings all this week . 
 Yes , my customers have started to complain too ! 
 Shogun Restaurant of Pasadena . 
 I can help you if you can just tell me what evening you like the reservation for . 
 What time do you think that you would like to have dinner ? 
 How many diners will be in your group ? 
 I have a table for four available at 7 
 Mr . Foster , we will be expecting you this Tuesday at 7 
 Do you know who ’ s just got married ? Old Mc Donald . 
 He ’ s nearly 90 . 
 I am . Whatsmore , his wife is 84 . 
 Yes , she is . And guess what , he is her sixth husband . 
 May I help you ? 
 Sure.Please sign your name here ... and here . 
 Thanks.How would you like them ? 
 Would you care to join for the picnic tomorrow ? 
 We'd like to invite you for our dress party tomorrow evening , are you free ? 
 What a pity ! You can't join us . 
 what's your opinion about childless couples ? Will you choose to have no kids ? 
 why ? Do you have to make a choice now ? 
 what's the puzzle ? 
 oh , I see . I think the older generation tend to think in a different way . 
 oh , really ? Maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren . 
 definitely . 
 don't worry . I think in most cases , children are the glue that keeps a family together . 
 sure . You can fully enjoy your time together . 
 That's great . What's on tonight ? 
 Romantic ? I am afraid I like thrillers better . 
 On the contrary , very exciting . 
 Oh , you are out of breath ! What happened ? 
 Take it easy . They will get caught . 
 Why do I need to do that ? 
 Oh , my goodness . Who do I need to talk to ? 
 Absolutely . I think I still have the boarding passes from our flight here somewhere . 
 Since 911 I think every airline requires that the passengers show ID to board . 
 Yes , I really want to know about the housing system in your company . 
 I also want to know if there's a holiday at your company , for I must visit my parents every year . 
 No , thanks . 
 Well , my sister is a lawyer . 
 Yes , she does . But she's working in Washington , D . C . , right now . Her job is top secret . 
 He's a painter . He's working in Argentina this month . He has an exhibition there . 
 How many candidates do you choose for the first round ? 
 The first round ? 
 How are you going all these days ? 
 But you look depressed . 
 Is it serious ? 
 How about your family ? 
 We have one day to visit the big city , can you give us some advice ? 
 I don't think we can visit the city in one day just by walking . How much does the limo cost ? 
 What's your expected salary ? 
 How do you feel about an annual salary of 100,000 Yuan plus bonus . 
 That sounds very reasonable . 
 Generally it is 6 months and during this period you are half-paid . 
 well , there are certain factors that effect people's size and weight . 
 one study said that low-income groups have a higher percentage of over-weight people than higher income families . 
 the survey said that the low , income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis . 
 and junk food contains lots of fat and oil . There is one final reason why so many people are fat . 
 nobody exercises anymore-not even kids ! The average american home has the TV on for 6 hours a day ! 
 yeah , I guess so . 
 hey , I started a diet and lost 10 pounds . 
 well , I quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds . 
 Will you bring our bill , please ? 
 Thanks.Let me see . I think there's a mistake on the bill here.Would you mind checking , please ? 
 How about tax and service charge ? 
 Then one hundred U . S . dollars covers everything , doesn't it ? 
 What do you base our grades on ? 
 Does the final count the most ? 
 How do you total our scores ? 
 What if we are out sick ? 
 How can we know if we are doing OK during the year ? 
 Excuse me.Where do I register ? 
 Is that the large , white building ? 
 Thanks . 
 Yeah , Why ? 
 You can bet on that . 
 No , I don't . 
 Because I think it's boring 
 Learn a lot ? Really ? 
 Do you have magazines now ? 
 Can you lend me one ? 
 Here . Keep the change . 
 You're welcome . By the way , is there a pay phone near here ? 
 Yes , I do . Thank you . 
 Would you like orchestra seats ? 
 Not unless you want the matinee . 
 Coffee , please . 
 Yes , of course . I can't go through a day without coffee in the morning . 
 I totally disagree . The other day I read in a book that a number of recent studies suggest that it can be a highly beneficial drink . Researchers have found strong evidence that coffee reduces the risk of several serious aimed 3 ' including diabetes , heart disease and cirrhosis of the liver . 
 I don't think so . Coffee helps me wake up , keep alert , and improve my short term memory . 
 Maybe you are right to some extent . 
 Maybe I could have a try . 
 It's my pleasure . How many copies would you want ? 
 Yes , sir . Will there be anything else ? 
 Your document will be ready in about ten minutes . 
 If we want to get this internet business off the ground , we've got to do something fast . 
 We've got to put more buzz words into the page text , so it will pop up when people search about our kind of products . 
 I think one of the least costly ways to attract business is to ask some of our neighboring sites to offer links to our page inside of theirs . If they have related services , they may be willing to help us out . 
 My friend Emily recently lost 18 pounds . 
 The point is that she has been persuading me to lose weight too . 
 Good ? Yes , it's good for her but not for me . You see , she tells me that I'll feel better about myself if I slim down . She keeps giving me newspaper clippings about the latest miracle diet and insists that I join a health club , as she has . 
 I just can't bear it that Emily made me feel like a baby who always pigs out on junk food . 
 But junk food is so easy . It requires no silverware or plates , no rigid mealtimes , no pleases and thank yous . 
 Yes , but life without chips , ice cream and coca cola is boring . 
 Well , that sounds better than giving it up . 
 This Friday evening ? 
 Thank you for the invitation . I'll be very happy to go . 
 What time should I arrive ? 
 Fine . See you then . 
 I heard the radio announcer say it was 18 degrees below zero . 
 My car didn't want to start either at first . 
 Not in the new apartment . We have to leave the car in the parking lot . 
 I do . Right now I have it protected up to 30 below zero . 
 Not really . It sometimes gets to 20 below . 
 Is it your first time to join the sports meeting of Junior High School ? 
 Long-distance race , dash , hurdle race , relay race , standing long jump , high jump , shotput and so on . 
 OK , let's go . 
 Wonderful , Bruce is taking the lead . 
 Come on , Bruce . Come on , Bruce . 
 Hello ? 
 No , I ’ m afraid not , Mary . May I take a message for her ? 
 O . K . No problem . Anything else ? 
 All right , I ’ ll leave her the message , Mary . Thanks for calling . 
 Goodbye . 
 No , You're got on the wrong bus . You can take a No . 22 bus at the University station and then transfer to a No . 83 bus at the railway station . 
 Nancy , please turn the TV down . 
 I don't care . I have a headache . 
 Yes . I ’ m here to apply for the job of director that your company posted yesterday . Is it still available ? 
 Great . Where can I get an application form ? 
 Where is the Human Resource Office ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 I need it . Thank you . 
 I'd been feeling pretty well until just a few days ago . 
 I feel run down , tired . I've been having headaches almost every day . And I'm not getting as much sleep as usually do . 
 Well , I haven't been eating well , I guess . I usually only have enough time to grab a sandwich and a cup of coffee for lunch . 
 Sometimes I'm too tired to eat anything at all . 
 I don't like to take any medicine at all without talking it over with a doctor first . 
 Nice to see you , too . I heard you are a staff of Nokia company . 
 Congratulations . What did you do during the interview ? 
 How can I have the good external expressions ? 
 Where are you going this weekend ? 
 Oh really ? It ’ ll be nice and warm there . Have you been there before ? 
 I see . What ’ s it like there ? 
 Well , have a great time ! 
 That would be great . Actually , can I get your phone number , Ella ? That's assuming you don't mind if I call you sometime . 
 Ok , got it . I will call you sometime next week . 
 It's time to go . Bye , Ella . Hope to see you soon . 
 Welcome , Li Mei . Please give me your coat and hat . 
 Oh , let's come in and enjoy yourself . 
 Thank you , Li Mei . Come into the dining room . I'm going to cut the cake soon . 
 It's a secret . 
 No , I can manage it myself.Just sit down , please . 
 Never mind . 
 Certainly . 
 No.sir . If only you check out before 15:00 
 I'm very grateful for what you have done to my son , doctor . 
 I know he has brought great trouble to you . A million thanks . 
 I will . It's most thoughtful of you . 
 Yes . I ’ m going to travel around Europe . 
 I think I will start off in Paris . Then I ’ m going to take the train to Nice and then go on to Milan . 
 Oh yes and try lots of new food too . 
 Oh , don ’ t worry , I will ! 
 Let's take a cab . 
 They are actually fairly straightforward . Do you know where the blanks are kept ? 
 OK , well after you take one out of that second drawer , you put your name on the top . Do you see ? 
 Next you fill in all of your hours for each day and total them . Do you know how to show time on a 24 - hour clock ? 
 Midnight is zero and when you put the minutes in , make sure that you show them with a dot followed by the minutes . Do you understand ? 
 It's easy , just write in the hours , total it , sign it , and put it in the box . 
 Try it and if you can't do it , one of us can always help you later . 
 can't bear it , right ? I've been there before . I'll feel comfortable if no one calls me or sends me text messages , like there is something missing . 
 actually , this is a kind of addiction called " infomania " or " information overload " . 
 yes , it is . Do you consider a frequent check of your income emails to be an integral part of your working day ? 
 do you have your cell phone with you wherever you go and check text messages and phone calls from time to time ? 
 do you open all your IM tools whenever you're using a computer ? 
 now I can tell you're definitely addicted to the overflow of information . 
 Thank you . And a merry Christmas to you ! 
 As a matter of fact , I am a bit upset . I just came out of a meeting and it didn't go very well . 
 No one would listen to any of my suggestions . Instead , they just kept arguing with each other . 
 Bob . 
 That's exactly what happened ! He kept interrupting everyone with his own suggestions and did not want to hear what others had to say . Then he expected everyone to agree with him . 
 We were trying to come up with ideas to streamline the office's workflow to make it more efficient . 
 Exactly . I had tons of ideas that I wanted to share , but they just wouldn't let me finish . What should I have done to get my point across ? 
 Short and sweet ? But what if I have to explain something complicated ? 
 That's a good idea , I think I will try that at the next meeting . 
 Well , as you know I was in Thailand last month , and I took a cooking class ! So I prepared some of my favorite dishes . 
 Ok , for starters we have Tom Yam soup . It's a bit spicy , but really good ! 
 Now this next dish is one of the most famous . Foreigners call it papaya salad but the proper name is Tom Sam . It is a spicy salad made from a mix of fresh vegetables including shredded unripened papaya and tomato . 
 Ok , now for the last and best dish in my opinion . This is called Pad Thai . It's stir-fried noodles with eggs , fish sauce , tamarind juice , red chili pepper plus bean sprouts , shrimp and tofu and garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander . It's practically Thailand's national dish ! 
 Want some more ? 
 Julie , what's on the tube ? 
 yeah . Maybe we can change to another channel . what about the sports channel ? Let's see if there's a game on . 
 it was a good game , but not good enough to watch again . Keep surfing . 
 oh , what is it ? 
 oh , I know this kind of shows . Sometimes they really piss me off . If I wanted reality , I'd go outside . 
 I don't get it . We have more than 100 channels and there's still nothing good on ! Maybe we should just turn off the TV , get outside , and do something real . 
 Hello , is John in ? 
 Yes , would you leave him a message to call me ? 
 I want to know how to buy something from this machine . 
 I want to buy one of those snack things . 
 I'm clear so far . 
 It won't go in ! 
 Yes , next step . 
 They're totally unreliable . 
 May I invite you to dance with me ? 
 Never mind , I can teach you . 
 No , it is easy . 
 You just follow me . 
 Yup , because dance can relax myself . 
 Good news ! 
 The state of economy is starting to go up in our country . 
 I am a student in Cambridge University . I read your ad , I want to know something more about your room , please ? 
 Is there a bathroom ? 
 It sounds good . Could I go and see it myself ? 
 See you later ! 
 Welcome ! Come in , please ! 
 This way please . Your room is upstairs ... Here it is . 
 Yes , if you want to wash something , there is a separate lavatory room outside . 
 Anytime you like . 
 Most of our customers are foreigners . How many foreign languages can you speak , Elizabeth ? 
 And how well can you speak them ? 
 And how about your Spanish ? 
 I see . Well , we have a lot of Spanish customers , but you wouldn't need to write any Spanish here . 
 How much are you asking for this ? 
 Is tax already included in their price ? 
 Would you consider a volume discount ? 
 I'll accept your offer . 
 Okay . Do you have a particular size in mind ? 
 Look at this one . It's our biggest pan . 
 Okay , we have the same thing in aluminum . 
 Try this one . Same aluminum pan , but with a heat-resistant bamboo handle . 
 That's a good choice . How do you want to pay for it ? 
 I'm so sorry . A lid comes with the pan . Here it is . 
 What color do you like ? 
 Maybe you could have a look at this one . 
 Large . 
 Happy Valentine's Day ! 
 Could I treat you to dinner tonight ? 
 Good afternoon , sir , is there anything I can help you with today ? 
 Well , I would be happy to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for her . Is there anything particular that you have in mind ? 
 Well , you can give her a set of pearl earrings , or this beautiful heart-shaped pendant . What is her favorite gemstone ? 
 Don ’ t worry , we specialize in providing our customers a relaxed , pressure-free shopping environment . That stone is an amethyst . We have a range of beautiful amethyst pieces . Take a look at this bracelet . It ’ s 18K rose-gold , studded with amethyst and blue topaz . It ’ s a great statement piece . 
 We have this beautiful platinum pendant , or you could also get her a locket . You could also get her a timepiece — it ’ s both glamorous yet functional.If you tell me a little more about your girlfriend , maybe I can help you find something for her . 
 Perhaps you could give her a ring ? 
 Well sir , I believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose ! 
 Fabulous ! We should look at engagement rings then ! Now that ’ s a whole other section . 
 I will join John in his mountaineering trip . 
 We haven't made up our minds . Will you come with us ? 
 We're supposed to check in at the air-china ’ s counter . Thirty minutes before take off , Joe . 
 Do we need to show our ID cards when checking in . 
 What about our luggage ? 
 Are they going to frisk all the passengers ? 
 Do you have any plan on your mind ? 
 How are we going there , by bike or by bus ? 
 Something ’ s burning ? 
 Mm , I love burnt bread . 
 But I prefer burnt bread . 
 Wonderful ! A perfect piece of bread ! 
 Hello , I am calling about my cable service . 
 For the past week my cable hasn't been working . 
 Do you know when it is going to start working again ? 
 Will I still have to pay for the cable while it's not working ? 
 So I don't have to pay anything ? 
 Okay , thank you very much for your help . 
 The new computer software is driving me crazy ! I really need a break ! 
 That ’ s what I ’ Ve heard . But as far as I ’ m concerned , it takes a genius to figure it out . Can you pass the sugar , please ? 
 Hello . I'd like to get a seat to New York City on a flight leaving sometime before this Friday . 
 Well , in that case , that's fine . I want a first class ticket on Thursday . 
 Cash , please . 
 Well I had several tests and an oral presentation this week so I didn ’ t get a chance to memorize the second page , but I think I mastered the tricky section . 
 Charles ? Before I start I was wondering if it was ok if I put a small crescendo in here and then decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here ? 
 It was horrible ! I played play it much better at home ! 
 Is that better ? 
 Sorry ! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make . 
 I'm going to the store downtown this afternoon to try on my wedding dresses . 
 Will you come with me and help me choose ? 
 Good . I think I'll get too nervous to look at myself in the mirror ! 
 I'll cook dinner for you . 
 My shirt needs ironing . Could you please help me with that , Mary ? 
 Please , I promise this is the last time . 
 Would you like a cigarette ? 
 Really ? Why ? 
 I see . You mean you don't enjoy smoking any more ? 
 Stop talking like my mother . That's what she keeps saying . 
 What do you mean ? What are you talking about ? 
 Who ? Me ? Could't give up smoking ? Nonsense ! Of course I could ! I know I could ! 
 Because I've already proved it . Smoking's the easiest thing in the world to give up . I've done it hundreds of times ! 
 I just took a shot in the dark . 
 Nothing much . What's new with you ? 
 Me too . Seems like all I do is eat and sleep . 
 Okay . Check you later . 
 It's wet and rains a lot.But right now it's the golden season to take a tour there . It is fine there almost everyday . 
 It's not so hot as it is here . 
 I've got a sore throat and my chest hurts . 
 Yes , I ache all over . 
 A little bit . 
 It's gone completely . 
 Is that all doctor ? 
 Thank you , doctor . Goodbye . 
 What's the problem ? 
 I really didn't see it . 
 I only saw bushes at the intersection . 
 I really didn't mean to run it . 
 Are you still going to write me a ticket ? 
 Thanks for being so understanding . 
 Lately I've felt that company morale is at an all-time low what can your firm do to help get my business back on track ? 
 It seems that my employees are having trouble working as a team . Not to mention serious lapses in service , sales and leadership skills . 
 What a relief ! I was beginning to think it was no way to get my business rolling again . 
 Freeze ! Police ! Put your hands over your head ! 
 You're under arrest for concealing illegal drugs . 
 You are suspected of hiding illegal drugs . So we are taking you into custody . 
 We've found some heroin at your house . 
 That may be , but you're still under arrest . And you'd better stop talking . 
 Whatever you say . 
 Certainly . You are more welcome to do . What is it ? 
 Well , if spicy local dishes are what you are looking for , In Hua Restaurant is the best place to go . The restaurant serves very good and spicy local dishes . You might want to try there . 
 It is near the university . Five minutes ' walk from your flat , I think . 
 You're welcome . May you have a good time . Please give my regards to your wife . I wish her a happy birthday tomorrow . 
 I really like my debate class . 
 I've entertained the idea . But I'm I leaning more toward politics . 
 That's not like you to generalize . 
 I think I can do a lot of good for our country . 
 Now , madam , here is the Hotel . 
 $ 15 . 
 Well , madam , the meter was not on at all . You didn't tell me . 
 It says here that you graduated from Beijing Normal University with a major in English Language and Literature . 
 Yes . 
 So you must be an extravert ? 
 What do you think are the responsibilities of a tourist guide ? 
 Don't you consider it a hard work ? 
 Have you any experience as a tourist guide ? 
 Have you ever learned any other foreign languages other than English ? 
 Are the galaxies in the universe moving through space ? 
 But I heard that our Milky way galaxy may one day collide with a neighboring galaxy . If galaxies are moving apart from each other , how can they collide ? 
 Wow , you're really informative . Thanks a lot . 
 Hello , Kevin . I hate to do this , but I have to cancel our appointment . 
 Yeah , I really wanted to come , too . But something unexpected in Shanghai have come up . I have to fly out for a few days , but I'll be back soon . 
 I should have some free time next week . Say , next Wednesday evening ? 
 Yeah , I'm expecting to come back on Tuesday . 
 OK . 
 Hello , I'd like to speak to Mike please . 
 Hello , I'm afraid Mike's unavailable right now . He's in a meeting . Can I take a message ? 
 Sorry , could you repeat that please ? 
 Let me read that back to you , 123 456 789 , Mary from Happy Travel . I'll ask him to get back you as soon as he can . 
 Anything else ? 
 Bye . 
 By amenities , exactly what do you mean , please ? 
 Okay , I got it . You've already run out of all your amenities ? 
 I'm more confused now than before . How is there a problem ? 
 Okay , finally I understand . You would like souvenirs ! 
 If it's souvenirs you want , sir , just visit our souvenir shop . It has everything . 
 No problem at all , sir . Housekeeping will deliver you all the amenities you like in a bit . 
 It ’ s great , dad . I don ’ t mind delivering papers , but the real fun is collecting the money . 
 I ’ Ve never had a bank account before . Why don ’ t I just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does ? 
 But what if I need my money suddenly ? 
 Great ! So it ’ s almost the same as keeping it under the matters ! 
 OK . Guess I have to do that before . I can make money my first withdrawal . 
 We are going to climb a cliff on the Colorado River . 
 It is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet . 
 We rappelled down the side of 300 - foot cliff . It was very exciting . 
 Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb . 
 O . K . See you . 
 Sorry , I thought you knew . 
 Didn't I ? 
 Well , I'm telling you now . 
 I didn't think you'd be interested . 
 Sorry , I didn't think it mattered . 
 I'm going on a cruise this summer . 
 My brother won a free trip and he's taking me . 
 I can't go to your party . 
 Would you like this one ? 
 This one ? 
 This one is especially built for hard , continuous play . And every detail of workmanship and material has been carefully checked to make it a dependable one for tournament use . 
 This cover comes with the racket . 
 The mark says six hundred yuan , plus tax , it's six hundred and eighty yuan . 
 Sure . If you'll just wait here , I'll be right with you in a minute . 
 I think I prefer train . It's cheaper and safe . 
 Birds of feather flock together . You must be one of these men . 
 That ’ s enough for you to worship the ground she treats on . 
 Good afternoon . I would like my hair done . 
 I'd like to try a new hair-style . Could you show me some pictures of hair styles ? 
 Thanks . Please give me the style in this picture here but make the wave longer . I would like hair spray , please . 
 Beautifully done . 
 No , thanks . How much should I pay ? 
 Here you are . 
 How long have you been in England ? 
 Almost two years ? Your English is very good . 
 Where do you want to go ? 
 Get in . I'll take you . 
 It will cost you $ 10 . 
 You can see the time on the meter . I have radio time , you know . 
 Certainly . 
 Yes , please . What's special today ? Any special recommendations ? 
 The name sounds fascinating . What is it exactly ? 
 Sorry , I'm not interested in vinegar . 
 OK . I'll have that . 
 Thank you . That's enough . 
 Thanks . 
 What do you want to speak to me about ? 
 Oh , you do ? 
 What made you decide to volunteer ? 
 Good for you . 
 I will be voting . 
 Thanks for letting me know . 
 Yes , let me see some of your hats , please . 
 It's a little bit tight . 
 Yes , it fits all right now . I'll take it . Please put it in a bag and I'll take along . 
 How much is it ? 
 Here is the money . 
 Nothing else , thank you . 
 I wish I could place a monthly order for a minimum of 50 cases , introducing your goods to my customers , but your price , $ 100 for a case , is too high in this highly competitive market . 
 People here desire medium-priced air freshener only . Please carefully consider my proposal , which will lead to a larger business between us . 
 Then , I am sorry to say I must regretfully decline your offer and seek quotations for the other suppliers . 
 Yes . I'll welcome other opportunities to do business with you . 
 The system crashed when I was surfing on the internet . 
 No , But does that matter ? 
 I see . I'd better never try . 
 Do you know what's wrong with my PC ? 
 Is anti-virus software necessary for a PC ? 
 I'm afraid yes . But what about the data I stored in the computer ? 
 Yes , please . I'll really appreciate that . 
 We have a variety of transportation services . Would you prefer a private vehicle to a taxi ? 
 Perhaps you'd prefer a limousine . That's such a stylish way to travel . 
 And what is your destination ? 
 I see . What time do you want to depart from the hotel ? 
 Okay , a taxi will arrive in seconds , sir . 
 It won't be but a few seconds , sir . 
 Let me see . Yes , we still have four left . 
 How long would you stay ? 
 Hi , Elvin . How are the new programmers I got for you ? 
 Are you still mad about your nose ? How is it ? 
 That won't be necessary , Elvin . Look , I want to apologize for your nose . I'm sorry . 
 How was school today ? 
 Really , that's good . 
 They aren't hard . I am sure you can do it . 
 The sea water treatments are supposed to be really good for you . 
 But the water has to be kept at 34 degrees so that the minerals can be absorbed by your body . 
 How do you usually sell your products now ? 
 Oh , really ? Is it a good way ? 
 What advantages does it have ? 
 Yes , if we do business through other ways , it will cost a lot of time . 
 Yes , going abroad to join the exhibition will cost much . But does it have any disadvantages ? 
 You mean there may be credit problems ? 
 Will you give some suggestion ? 
 Thanks . Maybe I will do business through Internet in the future . 
 Speaking . 
 Sending it won't be necessary . I'm actually coming in for a meeting with my Personal Banker this afternoon . 
 Indeed . Is there anything I need to do before I collect it ? 
 I'm sure it'll be fine . How about my PIN number ? 
 Great . I'll be in later today . Thanks for calling . Bye . 
 I like current affairs programmes and documentaries , especially wildlife ones . How about you ? 
 I agree . People often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence . 
 right . You can ’ t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programmes . They need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programmes . 
 that ’ s great idea . But don ’ t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ? 
 not as far as I know . We have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! That ’ s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv , where you pay a fixed amount each mo 
 well , there ’ s a wildlife documentary on tv in a few minutes . Shall we ? 
 I only wish it were this time yesterday . 
 Perhaps we ought to get dressed and have breakfast . We'd feel better . 
 Perhaps I'd better ring the police ... 
 How much is it ? 
 It s a little overpriced . Is there any discount on this laptop ? 
 I ’ d buy this if it were cheaper . How about 5 000 yuan ? 
 Is it the final price ? 
 Alright , I ’ ll buy this one . 
 Did you see his last dive ? 
 He's diving for the gold . 
 Oh , my God . It ’ s beautiful . But it looks expensive . 
 I want to have a car like that . But I am not rich . And I don ’ t have a rich daddy . 
 Give me your hand . ( takes Rose's hand ) Close your eyes . Go on . ( Rose closes her eyes ) Step up . Now hold on to the rail . Keep your eyes closed ; don't peek . 
 Step up onto the rail . Hold on . Keep your eyes closed . Trust me ? 
 All right , open your eyes . ( Rose opens her eyes . She stretches her arms , and Jack stands behind her , arms around her . ) 
 Which school is your children in ? 
 Oh , it costs too much . It's more expensive than the public school . 
 But the private school amount to better schools . 
 I want to have a trip to Sydney . 
 3 weeks 
 It's good . By the way , what kind of clothes do I have to bring with me ? 
 I always think everybody looks down on me 
 How can you be optimistic ? You can see it in their eyes . 
 Don't be that negative . 
 Is there a lot of oil and coal in your country ? 
 Yes , it is . My country is famous for having that natural resources . We also have a lot of natural gas . 
 No coal has been discovered in my country , but there may be undiscovered deposits . We don ’ t have many metal deposits . 
 When I traveled around your country , I bought some jewellery made from gold from your country . The jewellery told me that there are few gold mines in your country . The gold was found in mountain steams . 
 You have many trees in your country . That ’ s another natural resources . 
 I see . That ’ s probably a good idea . Too many forest are being destroyed . 
 We have some inspections , but it is very hard to avoid pollution when extracting oil . There has been some damage , but it is under control . 
 You have to make an appointment before we can come out and install it . 
 What day are you available ? 
 Three o'clock is the only time we can come in . 
 I'm sorry , but that's our only available time . 
 We're completely open on Saturday . 
 That'll be fine . 
 Not bad . There ’ s a new English teacher . 
 She is beautiful . 
 She is quite young and her hair is blond . 
 Not really . Her eyes are blue . 
 Not much . She is very tall and slim . 
 May I have a reservation ? 
 I've got three guests today . We'd like a table next to the window . 
 I'm Chen Liang . 
 We may come at 6:30 p . m . 
 Goodbye . 
 I think I caught a cold . 
 Runny nose and coughing . 
 I have just taken the temperature , I don't think so . 
 Are you sure ? 
 What should I do ? 
 Hello . I'm leaving . Here is my key . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Well , most of my time here was pleasant . And New York itself is fantastic . 
 I am confused . How could a golfer need so many clubs ? Seems to me , 14 altogether , right 
 Then what makes a ' set ' of clubs ? 
 So many ? 
 Have you heard of Tiger Woods ? 
 I ’ ll be away for a moment . 
 Look ! I ’ v been watching that man down in the street . He keeps peeping into the shop . Keep your eyes skinned for that guy , will you ? 
 Good morning . Can I help you ? 
 Just a moment , please . I am sorry , sir . There is no ticket available on that day . But we have flights for Hong Kong the next day . 
 A 9:12 flight in the morning and a 14:00 flight in the afternoon . 
 At 10:20 
 All right , sir . Please reconfirm your ticket no later than 12 noon two days before the flight ; otherwise , your reservation will automatically be canceled . 
 It's 500 dollars , not including ground transportation fares between the airport and downtown . 
 Right , sir . And please do not forget to bring a valid travel document with you when you buy the tickets . 
 Hi , Mike . Haven't seen you for a while . How's Cathy ? 
 What happened ? Did you break up ? 
 Oh , I am sorry . Maybe you were just emotional at that moment . Do you think you guys can get back together ? 
 Oh , you are such a dog ! 
 but you said your dream was to be an entrepreneur , to be your own boss . 
 it sounds like you've got a perfect plan . 
 it can save you lots of time and effort to simply copy a successful business model . 
 that's right . You should establish good relationships with them . what else are you planning to do while working for that company ? 
 sounds perfect . I think with all that you have in mind , you'll become a successful businessman . By then , perhaps , I'll join in as a partner of your company . 
 How many credits for each course ? 
 Thank you , sir , I'm sure I will . 
 I don ’ t know who placed the call . However , the call was from Toronto . 
 Sure . 416-790-1256 . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Hello , I am Amy . 
 I saw that your Corollas are on sale . 
 Tell me about Corollas . 
 Sounds good . How about $ 15 , 000 ? 
 I am serious . $ 15,000 . 
 No . Just talk to your manager and let me know . 
 The price is fine if you give me free security system and free carpet mats . 
 Thanks ! 
 Oh , would you please turn off the fire ? My hands are sticky with the dough . 
 Thanks . 
 Well , I go to the gym a lot . I am a member of a gym nearby . 
 About three times a week if I can . 
 Not really . I ’ d really like to try golf , though . 
 I look at many things , attendance , quizzes , and tests . 
 Obviously I look for improvement as we go along , but I would like you to do your best from the beginning . 
 The final and midterm are 40 percent of your grade ; homework , attendance , and quizzes total 60 percent . 
 You can only miss one class without penalty . 
 I will be letting you know during the year if you have a major problem . 
 I'm not sure , but I think It's open until 4 o'clock . 
 It's a quarter past three . 
 Wonderful ! We can meet your requirements and the offer is ready for you . Here it is . The unit price is USD 15.00 per kilogram . 
 It's FOB Shanghai . 
 Certainly , that's easy . We will work out our CIF offer this evening . Could you come again tomorrow , say , at 10 AM ? 
 Can I have a look at your international timetable ? 
 Yes . Do you have any direct flight to Tokyo ? 
 What about a flight to Paris ? 
 I'm glad you're on your ten-year reunion planning committee . 
 That's not why . This way I can see how you guys do this sort of thing . 
 Definitely . Every year . But just for our forty-person class . 
 Melanie , can you help me with something ? We need to finalize the account with the Mexican Embassy and , I need some advice on phrasing this letter correctly in English . 
 Okay , so ... To Whom It May Concern , I am writing . 
 Okay , more relaxed . Got it . Hey , Sally , what ' s up ? It's Tracy here , just . 
 Great , okay . " Dear Miss Cooper , I'm writing to confirm the final quotation for the full page back cover color advertisement you requested for the spring issue of Voila magazine " . 
 " The final costing , including advert design and production , comes to forty-five thousand six hundred RIB . We want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . Thanks for ... " 
 Oops , okay . You are right . Then I can just end with " All the best , Tracy " . 
 Oh , Melanie , you are a life saver , thank you ! 
 that depends . What is it ? 
 I'd love to help you out , but I'm a bit short on cash this month as well . I had to get a new engine put into my car , and that ate up my savings . 
 let's see , I've got about $ 50 to get me through the weekend . I can only spare about $ 20 . I would give you more if I had it , I just don't have much money to my name right now . 
 that'd be great . Thanks ! What time should I come over ? 
 see you then ! 
 What do you mean by that ? 
 You've been always active and versatile . It seems that you are interested in everything . 
 I have fewer hobbies than yours . That's why I find campus life a bit dull and uninteresting . 
 That's a good suggestion . It's fine today . Maybe I can take photos on the scenery of the lake at sunset . It must be fantastic . 
 And I can concentrate on my study after the relaxation over the weekend . 
 What's the matter with me , Doctor ? I feel so tired these days . 
 And what's the cause of that ? 
 But I can't just slow down . 
 You mean I've got to lose weight ? 
 Pardon me . I need an old music box . 
 Actually , I was thinking about something from the 1920s . 
 Do any of the boxes have dancing figures ? 
 I love the dancing figures . I'll take this music box . 
 I was wondering , does this come with any kind of warranty ? 
 I was just hoping . 
 May I have the bill , please ? 
 How much altogether ? 
 Does it include the charge for drinks ? 
 Here is $ 200 , keep the change , please . 
 Don ’ t be angry with them . After all , they are still children . 
 If I were you , I would not put crime in their doing these thing . We should encourage our children to do what they like , so long as they are not far off track . 
 It ’ s time to get up . 
 You shouldn ’ t stay up so late watching TV . I told you we had to get an early start . 
 Do you want to eat breakfast here ? 
 Ok by me . 
 No , it isn't mine . I blundered upon it under the sofa . Do you know whose watch it is ? 
 Well , here you are . Remember to put it in a proper place . 
 Well , I just want to enjoy what I ’ m doing it ’ s the most important thing to me . 
 Yes , because I think being interesting thing is the best teacher . Or have more opportunities to have career growth . 
 Yes , of course . 
 In five years , I ’ d like to be a senior manager of this corporation . 
 By doing whatever is necessary . 
 Two hamburgers and French fries . 
 Give me two cokes also , please . 
 We'll eat here . 
 And can I have some ketchup , please ? 
 Cindy ! Are you getting take-out ? 
 Yeah , thanks . Could you pick me up a chicken salad sandwich , an order of fries , and a large diet coke ? 
 Don't throw paper on the floor , Bill . 
 Put it in the waste-paper basket , please . 
 In that case , take the basket outside and empty it . 
 Where did you empty the basket , Bill ? 
 Silly boy ! The dustbin is at the back of the school . Now pick up the paperand put it in the dustbiri . 
 Well , I think you'll like the mangoes . 
 It's a fruit . It has a big stone in it . 
 No . You would break all your teeth on it . 
 The sale price today is $ 1 each . 
 They usually taste sweet , but they remind me of an orange . 
 Don't cut into them until you can feel that they're soft on the outside . 
 They come from tropical countries . 
 Perfect . Couldn't be better . 
 Of course you can . ( Lead Carl to his garage . ) 
 My car is simply a daisy . It drives smoothly . 
 I am glad to hear that . I'm really pleased with it . 
 I've heard that you provide very good service , so when I need a mover , I call you guys first . 
 Oh , you see , we are on the 8th floor , and moving into the 6th floor in another building . It is about 15 kilometers to get there . 
 How much will it cost in that case ? 
 Your charge is divided into two parts , the Payment in Advance and the rest . I thought that I should pay all of it before moving . 
 The damage and compensation item confuses me . Could you give some explanation ? 
 We finally get a chance to meet . 
 It's no problem . 
 Is there something wrong ? 
 I'm glad to hear it . 
 You don't have anything bad to say about her ? 
 I am so happy that she's doing okay . 
 It's said that the government will clamp down on the new policy . 
 I am not certain about that . 
 I would like to register for a class today . 
 I would very much enjoy taking a Psychology class.Because I'm crazy . 
 Which days are these classes on ? 
 What about the other class ? 
 Are you sure there are no more open classes ? 
 Sign me up for Monday and Wednesday . 
 Do you have any plans for Veteran ’ s Day ? 
 Well , as you know , on November 11th the allies signed a peace treaty with the Germans , also known as the Armistice Treaty . This marked the end of WWI and many countries around the world commemorate this date under names such as Remembers ’ Day . In Poland it ’ s their independence day ! There ’ s a lot going on around the world on this day . 
 Hello ! So you are leaving today . 
 It is my pleasure to see you off . 
 I hope so , too . 
 You're welcome . Have a nice trip ! 
 They arrested me for nothing . 
 They weren ’ t supposed to arrest me . 
 They didn ’ t let me go until the next morning . 
 They sure did . 
 I matched the description of a robbery suspect . 
 I want to take them to court . 
 Hello , this is David . 
 I am a little nervous about my presentation on Friday . 
 Wouldn't that take you away from your project ? 
 Is there a good time for you to help me ? 
 How about meeting in my office ? 
 Sounds like you'll be able to help me a lot . 
 Hey man , you wanna buy some weed ? 
 Weed ! You know ? Pot , Ganja , Mary Jane some chronic ! 
 I also have blow if you prefer to do a few lines . 
 Come on man ! I even got dope and acid ! Try some ! 
 I got my connections ! Just tell me what you want and I ’ ll even give you one ounce for free . 
 Yeah ? 
 What ’ s the date today ? 
 Right . What present should we give him this time ? By the way , how old is he ? 
 How time flies ! He ’ s a big boy now . 
 OK . Let ’ s invite all their little friends to come and celebrate . 
 Yes . It has been a long time since the last time we met . 
 No . I've been visiting relatives recently . 
 I went to visit an uncle in San Francisco . 
 No . Why ? 
 Great . Let's talk over coffee . 
 Yes , sir . We have a fine exercise facility . 
 You're actually standing above it . Just take the elevator or stairs down one level . 
 No , sir . There's no extra charge . All you need is your room key to open the door . 
 Sir , you'll be pleased to know that our gym never closes . 
 We might be getting one in the near future . But at the present time , no . 
 It's really there ? This all seems so surreal-like it's all one big nightmare . 
 Poor Femi . Taylor's death must have made her realize that she still cared for him . 
 It's already half past four . We should go and pay our respects . Taylor's family will be there . 
 I listen to various types of music . 
 I enjoy listening to both Rock and R & B . 
 I enjoy the different types of instruments that they use . 
 That's exactly what I think too . 
 Everything's going very well . The first phase of the project was finished three days ahead of schedule . We're on target to complete phase two by the beginning of week 40 . 
 Well , we've just finished laying the cabling and we're waiting for the safety inspector to give us the go-ahead to continue . I'm just going to meet him . Do you want to come ? 
 OK . The X2500 has the unique feature of providing better data flow with less input time . It will reduce your work load at the office . 
 Of course . One of the real pluses of this product is that it is of very high quality , and of compact size . No one can match us so far as quality is concerned . 
 We have this item in three price level . 
 That means this one . 
 It's hard to get tickets for the movie . 
 Yeah , two at the tenth rows . 
 3.5 dollars each . 
 Yes.We have an excellent service here . 
 OK . 
 I heard it . 
 Just let it be . Her rudeness will come back to haunt her . 
 It's a ETV palace ! I'm glad I brought my platinum card . 
 Where is Stanley ? It was his idea to have the bachelor's party at a ETV , wasn't it ? 
 Then I bet he's really good ! 
 Do you know what the BBS is ? 
 Tell me then . 
 Oh , I see , but what's it used for ? 
 Tell me in details . 
 Oh , that's great . I want to try later . 
 Are you sure you know where this bus goes ? 
 What do you mean it should ? 
 Dude , are we on the right bus ? 
 It doesn't look like we're on our way to Altadena . 
 What does that sign say ? 
 Yup , I'm never trusting you with the bus schedules again . 
 Yeah , at least . 
 Yes , speaking . Can I help you ? 
 Sure , I'd love to . Thank you . 
 They will be ready this afternoon . 
 Is that right ? We are very sorry 
 I ’ m afraid ... be can returned by eleven o ’ clock . 
 Yes , we ’ ll do so . 
 Sure . All you need is your student ID card or admission card to check out books and read journals or magazines in the library . 
 Two books at a time . Except magazines or journals , they have to be read within library . 
 For one month . If you can ’ t return the books in time , you'll be fined . But if you renew them , you can keep them longer . 
 Yes , just over there to your right . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Hi there . I'm calling about Personal Internet Banking , what details can you give me ? 
 That sounds good . At the moment I spend ages queuing at the post office to pay my bills . 
 Yes . I ’ m trying to find a pair of earrings to match my necklace . Can you recommend some to me ? 
 These look wonderful . Do these come with a guarantee of quality ? 
 I ’ ll take them . 
 Yes , What can I do for you ? 
 Welcome to our corporation . I'm in charge of the export business . 
 I'm In Hui . Do sit down , won't you ? 
 We'd be very glad to do so . Have you seen the exhibits displayed in the hall ? 
 Yes , of course . If you make an inquiry , we can make you a firm offer . 
 My son is alway complaining that I dump on him . He was very rude and told me to mind my own business . I cannot put up with that . 
 John is a peacemaker.He simply doesn ’ t bother.He says he should give him a free hand . 
 I have to say , my favorite movie is Superbad . 
 Honestly , it is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time . 
 I didn't think you saw that movie . 
 I was laughing through the whole movie . 
 Same here . 
 Of course . 
 My condolences . 
 I lost one of my contact lenses , and I ’ m searching high and low for it . 
 Thank you very much . I think I lost it near the window . 
 We only have spring rolls today for take-out . 
 Of course , ma'am . 
 Not long . They'll be ready in a few minutes . 
 Steak , please . 
 Well-done , please . 
 It's fried sole . 
 Sure . Please wait for a moment . 
 I ’ m calling to cancel my reservation for Trans Pacific Flight 8 on July 19 from Taipei to Minneapolis . Could you please make it for the same flight on August 2 instead of July 19 ? 
 My name is Judy Wang . 
 My first name is J-U-D-Y , and my last name is W-A-N-G . 
 It ’ s OK . Where should I pay for the penalty ? 
 That ’ s 1POJ7403 . 
 Thank you ! 
 No , thanks . I ’ m all set . Good-bye . 
 What's up ? 
 It is really good news . How much do you earn a week now ? 
 Darling , I know you are a good husband . You don't have to work so hard . After all your health is the most important . 
 I see . You must have more rest . 
 Happy birthday to you ! I'd really love to come , but I'm not sure right now . I'll try to make it.Thank you for your invitation . 
 This is the property manager . What seems to be the problem ? 
 Could you tell me what room had the leak ? 
 Could you please remind me which floor you are on ? 
 I will be sending the assistant manager to check it out . May we look at it this morning ? 
 If you aren ’ t there , we will use our master key to get in and check things out . 
 Well , most of the time it is , I guess . 
 I think money will make me happy . 
 It will for me . Then I can do all the things I want to do . 
 Then I can find something new to do . If I don't have to worry about money , then I don't have to work . 
 You see ... money doesn't equal happiness , but it takes away a lot of responsibilities . 
 What has caused you to make such a decision ? Didn ’ t you used to go with Helen ? 
 Oh . That ’ s really annoying when seeing a film . 
 Now let's use the weight machines . 
 Great . They've all got built-in TVs . 
 But we could just stay there for 20 minutes . 
 I would recommend doing some squats . Spread your feet about shoulder-length apart , toes facing forward , and slowly bend at your knees . 
 Keep your back straight and look forward . Good . Do about 3 sets of 20 . 
 Can I sign up for some classes today ? 
 I would like to take a driver's course . 
 Why do I need an appointment ? 
 Can I do that right now ? 
 How about 9 o'clock tomorrow morning ? 
 Thanks for all your help . 
 Really ? Thank you . I bought it in Spring Street yesterday . 
 Thank you.It ' s very nice of you to say so . 
 That's quite a compliment coming from you . 
 Hello ? Mr . Bernie . My name is Lisa . I hope I ’ m not disturbing you . I just heard about your daughter . I wanted to call you and tell you how much we ’ ll miss her . 
 What ? That ’ s odd . I ’ m so sorry if I ’ Ve bothered you . 
 I have something really cool to tell you about ! Do you know anything about online auctions ? 
 They're awesome ! I was browsing through the eBay auction today , and I found the cutest fat little copper Buddha ! It's over a hundred years old . 
 Why not ? 
 Hi , Larry , how was your weekend ? 
 Great . I hung out with Jo all day shopping , and the went out for dinner together . 
 Yeah , I never thought we could be good friends either . We have our differences . She's more outgoing and active while I am more quiet and reversed , but we still get along extremely well . We can talk for hours about anything . 
 When Jo and I are together , we argue a lot , but that's also part of the fun . Besides , I know she will always be there for me when I need her , and she knows I'll be there for her . 
 Exactly . Having Jo as my friend is one of the best things that's ever happened to me . 
 Thanks , I think so too . 
 Yes , I'd like to close my account . 
 Adam Smith . 
 56 Edison Ave , Apartment 39 , Los Angeles . 
 Next Friday . 
 14 May flower Ave , Los Angeles . 
 Miss , the air-conditioner in my room doesn't work . 
 Are you saying you saw an eagle ? There are no eagles here . 
 You must have seen some other kind of bird . 
 I ’ Ve often wondered the same thing . I also wonder who reads them . Then I realize that I ’ m standing here reading them myself . 
 I think we picked the right line . This one seems to be moving more quickly than the others . 
 I ’ m glad . We have only about twenty things here , and I ’ m in a hurry to get home . 
 We can pig out on potato chips and cookies . They are very cheap . 
 Sure . Here you are . 
 Sorry , tomato soup is not being served today , but we have egg soup , it's very delicious . Why don't you try it today ? 
 Would you like to have a drink ? 
 Anything else ? 
 OK . I'll be back soon . 
 Yes , please . I'm looking for a cotton polo shirt . 
 Not really . 
 I like the design , but don't particularly care for the colour . Do you have that in other colours , too ? 
 Yes . I prefer white - and may I see a pale yellow one , too ? 
 Just make yourself at home . 
 Wouldn't you like some more chicken ? 
 I ’ ll take this blouse and skirt please . 
 Can I pay by card ? 
 Ok , I ’ ll pay by card then . 
 Can ’ t be better ! Bob , aren ’ t you glad the semester is over ? 
 I didn ’ t think much of it . Are you ? 
 Sounds like fun . 
 Are you broke again ? Let me treat you . 
 You know , I am a waitress at the student center . Anyway now those final exams are almost over . I ’ d love a night out . 
 Take a guess . 
 Not bad . I ’ m proficient in both written and spoken English . 
 I passed College English Test Band 6 , with good skill in listening , speaking , reading , and writing . I haven't got any certificate of computer skills , because I don ’ t think certificates are necessary if what ’ s needed is merely operating a computer . I think practically , to know how to use a computer is more important . And I am quite familiar with Microsoft Office . 
 I took a part-time job last semester in translating and doing reception work for an exhibition . My work included hosting the visiting foreign exhibitors , communicating with them , arranging their agenda , and translating several materials . I think this activity well demonstrated my ability in English . And I will be glad to take any form of English test you arrange for me to prove my ability . 
 I stick to my principles and keep to the rules . Sometimes , they just lack enthusiasm . When I get them involved with something constructive , some of them change their attitude later . 
 Will you look at this form ? 
 I don't understand some things . 
 What does MI mean ? 
 What does MM / DD / YY mean ? 
 I don't understand . 
 Oh . That's simple enough . 
 Would you like chicken or beef ? 
 Here you are . 
 Certainly . The service cart will be down the aisle again soon . 
 Yes . All international ping-pong tournaments have become a demonstration of Chinese supremacy in the sport . 
 In the first place , I think the whole nation is just fond of the game . It is well grounded with the mass . With huge numbers of people playing ping-pong , we can always spot a handful of potential world champions . 
 Sure . There is a careful mechanism for selecting players from provincial teams , and those lucky dogs have to observe strict rules . 
 They are subject to hard training . And you know what , for a player on the national team , personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions . They are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other . 
 Well , ping-pong is our national sport , and we just have to keep winning one honor after another . That's why many people think such rules acceptable . After all , they are funded out of taxpayers'money . 
 I'll give it a try . 
 There's no need to apologize . 
 Forget it . It was an accident . 
 I'm nervous as can be . 
 Well , I almost always get up very early , and I lift weights for an hour . 
 No . And then I often go Rollerblading . 
 About five times a week . What about you ? 
 Did you see the fashion awards last night ? 
 Not interested ? 
 But they are showing what will be all the rage next year . 
 Did you know that fashion is cyclical ? 
 Precisely ! For example , Flares were popular for a while , then went out of fashion . Now we can start to see them coming back in again . 
 They're also known as bell-bottoms . They are a type of trousers . 
 That's fine , but then you'll always look plain . 
 It is especially important for the graduates who step into the job market for the first time . 
 The contents should be mainly descriptions of your background . And the length depends on the particular situation . 
 To sell yourself successfully , you should leave the interviewer a deep impression . 
 It should also be truthful and realistic . Do not blindly blow your own horn . 
 While you should not omit your weak points , they need to be described appropriately 
 Besides , in the interview , it is best that you make corresponding adjustments to apply your prepared contents flexibly . 
 Yes , may I have some water , please ? 
 May I get an order of barbeque wings ? 
 No , thank you , that'll be all for now . 
 I'm ready . 
 May I have the fettuccini Alfredo ? 
 Yes , that's it . 
 It will be a piece of cake . 
 Gave me the receipt , please . 
 What's wrong with it ? 
 Would you like another bigger one ? 
 OK , here is your money . 
 This is Mr Brown speaking . I'd like to speak to Mr . Thomas , please . 
 That's bad ! I've been trying to call him for the last ten minutes , but your line has been busy . Will he be back soon ? 
 Is there anywhere I can reach him ? 
 I have a business appointment with him for tomorrow morning at ten o'clock , but I'm afraid I can't make it . 
 Unfortunately , I'm leaving town rather unexpectedly , and I may be gone for several days . 
 Thank you . 
 I was scared stiff of giving my first performance . 
 Thank you for your kindly words . 
 Yes , I do it quite often . 
 Simple , it's fun . 
 Ah , that's the biggest fun of all . You see , even though you're not a good singer , people will listen to you . 
 But I like the feeling . 
 Oh , she ’ s just fine . She ’ s so grown up now . 
 Four and a half going on twelve ! 
 Nothing special . 
 Yes , we are just looking for one . What's the charge per day ? 
 That's reasonable . 
 Wait a minute , please . 
 No , I'd like to book a single room with one double bed . 
 2 nights , how much does it cost ? 
 Does the charge include everything ? 
 Do you require a deposit ? 
 Okay , so let ’ s go over everything one more time . I really want you to get this job ! 
 So , let ’ s see , you did your research on the company , right ? 
 So what would your role in the company ? 
 Sounds good , and so , why do you want to work with them ? 
 You idiot ! Don ’ t say that ! Do you want this job , or not ? 
 I know . I have to prepare the supper for the whole family before I leave . 
 The housework is really a big problem for me . My husband is on a business trip to the U . S . now and I have to take care of everything myself . 
 I've asked my parents to live with us for a while , so they can look after her for me while I am at work or in the class . 
 Me too . Sometimes I do want to give it up . I can't deal with so many things at a time . 
 It's close coming up at the end of this month . That will be no more than 15 days from now on . 
 Why don't you take the CPA exam ? You are already a good accountant , having so many years of experience . 
 Do you want some dessert ? 
 Oh , here comes our waitress with our check . 
 Yes , the service was quite good . 
 How much do you think we should leave for a tip ? 
 I agree that 20 % would be just about right . 
 Yes , what a nice dinner that was ! 
 How do you understand the organizational structure of a company ? 
 Is it true that just like a human skeleton that defines their shapes , companies have structures that define theirs ? 
 Why are you in court today ? 
 Is the officer that pulled you over here today ? 
 Tell me what happened . 
 The officer wouldn't lie about that . 
 There was no picture taken of your license plate ? 
 I'm just going to let you go . 
 This is the best dinner I've ever had . 
 I've never tasted anything better . 
 How about doing shopping this weekend ? 
 Sportshoes.Will you go with me ? 
 Could you just hold this for me ? 
 Yes , but I've nearly fixed it . Just take it , will you ? 
 Is your city a historical place ? 
 How did it grow into such a large place ? 
 As the city grew , it must have absorbed many village nearby . 
 I see . Are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ? 
 Really ? So your city does have some old history after all . 
 No , not usually . Most people are married in a church , and then the wedding party and guests go to another place for the reception . Sometimes , however , they hold the reception in a big room in the church . 
 Either they go to a public place such as a hotel , a restaurant , or a club , or to the home of the brid 
 Why do you ask ? 
 Oh ! In our country the bride's family is responsible for the entire wedding-arrangement , costs , etc . So the reception is held at her home . 
 Many American furthers joke that they would rather hold the ladder for their daughter to climb down and elope than pay for a wedding . 
 Yes . When the bride and groom are ready to leave on their honeymoon all the single girls gather in one place . The bride stands with her back to them and throws her bouquet over her shoulder and they each try to catch it . The one who does will be the next one married . 
 could we possibly discuss my salary some time ? 
 first of all , I want you to know that I really like working for this company . Do you think I'm doing a good job here ? 
 I try very hard . The problem is , my salary just isn't enough to live on . Now that I have a wife and a child to support , we hardly have enough money for food and rent . 
 I could really use a 5 % rise . 
 listen , if you give me a raise , I'll take on extra responsibilities . 
 that's fine . Do I get over-time for any extra hours that I work ? 
 that sounds good to me . I really appreciate it . 
 Welcome ! Sophia told us you were coming ! 
 Thank you ! Your cheeks are as red as a tomato ! Are you shy ? 
 Some of my grappa will cure your shyness . 
 It's a clear spirit we drink any time of the day . You will love it ! 
 Chris , where are you going ? 
 Really ? I need to go to the store too . 
 Yeah , let's go together . 
 Now . 
 Now would be better . 
 Should we walk ? 
 Jane ! What an enchanting skirt you have on ! 
 Bright colors , smooth material , exquisite craftsmanship , soft lines ... Darling , it looks elegant on you ! It can't be any cheap stuff . Something around two hundred , I guess . 
 Then you got a windfall ! Was sixty-five the original price , or did you get a special discount ? 
 How much did she ask for ? 
 She must be fuming with anger at such a bid , wasn't she ? 
 Then you pretended to go without buying it ? 
 In the past half year , we made some schedules and objectives , do you still remember that ? 
 How do you feel what you have done ? Did you meet our goals ? 
 Yes . And you also overworked in last month , when Steven asked for leave . I have been very satisfied with your performance . And your dependability has been a great asset . 
 Hello , Tom ! Do you have plans for this evening ? 
 How about having dinner with me ? 
 Let ’ s fix it at seven o'clock , OK ? 
 Don ’ t worry . I will arrange everything . 
 See you . 
 Oh . Yes . It is 
 That ’ s a good idea 
 It ’ s mild . but it ’ s not always pleasant . 
 I like spring . The days are long and the nights are short . The flowers in blew . We go on picnics 
 Sure . What do you need ? 
 Yes , we just got it and it is fabulous . Well , first you have to turn this switch on . 
 Now press this button . 
 Just a second . I'll go get some . Then you need to send the file . Make sure you choose the right printer . We have a few here and you're hooked up to all of them . 
 It's the Canon . 
 I don ’ t know ! This stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . Luckily , I managed to start it up and drive it here . What do you think it is ? 
 What do you mean ? My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . It ’ s brand new ! 
 Ugh ... So how long is this going to take ? An hour ? 
 What ! How am I supposed to get to school or go shopping ? This is not happening ! 
 Before 12 a . m . 
 I haven't seen your father in like 5 years . How is he doing ? 
 Why ? What's wrong ? 
 Is it due to old age or is he sick . 
 That makes sense . It's important to take care of your health early in life . 
 Well , I hope he starts feeling better . Say hi to him for me . 
 My car has broken down . Could someone come right away and check it ? 
 I am on Route 80 , a few miles east of the University of Utah . 
 It is a red Audi . 
 There's a taxi rank over there , right outside the gate . 
 This all looks good ! I think we know what we want . 
 I am dieting , so could the chef prepare the food with no extra sauce ? 
 Could you tell me if there are any entrees that are vegetarian ? 
 I am going to go with the grilled shrimp with garlic sauce . I would like the garlic sauce on the side . 
 You can serve our salads with our dinner . 
 Your lease isn ’ t up yet . 
 That ’ s going to be a problem . 
 It ’ s a problem because I can ’ t give you your deposit back . 
 You ’ re breaking our contract . 
 That ’ s not going to happen . 
 That ’ s really not my problem . 
 well , I'm looking for some summer clothes . 
 Really ? What's that ? 
 I like this T-shirt . Would you like to help me look for any skirts that go with it ? 
 This one is good . 
 I'll take this one . How much are they ? 
 Here you are . 
 I'm glad you like it . The bell is on the bedside . Just ring if you want anything . The room attendant speaks a little English . So I don't think you'll have any trouble . 
 I think so . Here it is . It's by the basin . 
 Yes , it is . 
 I wanna register for this mathematics course . 
 Closed ? The clerk told me I could come back and register any time during the first week of classes . 
 Some woman in here when I tried to register three weeks ago . She said I just had to pay a late fee . 
 She said I couldn ’ t until I had my birth certificate . Here it is . 
 Serious ? Only the proof of my address . 
 But it ’ s unfair . 
 Great . 
 This is the White Rose Restaurant.May I help you ? 
 What time , sir ? 
 May I have your name please ? 
 We have received many bookings.But we'll try our best . 
 Hello sir , how may I help you ? 
 I see , may I ask what the occasion is ? 
 Very well.This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness . 
 Mmm , well this is our I ’ m sorry I cheated on you package . Two dozen red roses lined with tulips , carnations and lilies . The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you . 
 I ’ m sorry sir but , what exactly did you do ? 
 Get out of my store , you jerk ! 
 What ? 
 Jay Chou's title song in his new album . 
 Gorgeous ! There is another song combining Chinese and western music styles . I am crazy for it , so I hear it over and again . And I plan to make it as the ringbone of my mobile . 
 I suppose this song can be the No . 1 on the top chart . 
 What's your favorite magazine ? 
 What kind of magazine is it ? 
 Really ? It is a weekly , isn't it ? 
 Does it enjoy popularity among the young generation ? 
 Oh , I think I should try to read one . 
 Yes , I'm sure I've been here before . 
 Yes , there's that bar we passed an hour ago . 
 Is your boss coming by ? 
 Okay . Get back to your work , and call me back this evening . 
 Bye ! 
 I was planning on making some kind of vegetable . 
 What kind of vegetable do you want ? 
 How do you want it ? 
 I can boil it , grill it , or microwave it . 
 Is that really what you want ? 
 I guess I can do that . 
 Sorry , we don't . But I think you can fly on Northwest Airlines to Berlin and then have a connecting flight on Canada Airline to Toronto . And it is the most economical flight , just 1,900 dollars . 
 At 8 am . By the way , it also makes a refueling stop . 
 Less than one hour . 
 Not so long , just one hour . 
 About 13 hours . 
 You are welcome ! 
 Sure did . It's a beauty . Where do you want it ? 
 Let's go to work . We want to have the tree ready to light up by evening . 
 Hand me some globes and paper flowers , I'll put them on these top branches . 
 Let's switch the lights on . 
 Well , I guess we're all set for another merry Christmas . 
 No , that's not right . I didn't order a coffee . I ordered a cola . 
 Waiter ! 
 It's not that . There's an animal in my soup . 
 I've never been to such a dirty restaurant , and never seen such slow service . 
 Hello , the International Hotel . May I help you ? 
 What time would you like your table ? 
 Would you like to sit in the hall or in the private room ? 
 Wait for a moment , please . Let me check whether the private room is available or not . No problem . 
 OK . A reservation for eight at7 : 30 , Room 208 . Please don't be more than half hour late , or we will have to give it to other guests . 
 Thank you . 
 She has been admitted to Yale with a scholarship . 
 Thank you . 
 I am sorry , I didn ’ t catch what you said . Could you repeat it please ? 
 Sorry , my English isn ’ t so good . Could you speak a little slower ? 
 Really ? How do you get the chance ? 
 Congratulations . How lucky you are ! 
 I ’ m sure you ’ ll enjoy the trip . China is such a beautiful country . 
 Have a nice journey , Lily . 
 Tom ! How are you ? We missed you at the party last night . Are you OK ? 
 Come on.We ’ Ve been through this already ! Look , I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here , but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it . 
 Yeah , it can get pretty lonely over the holidays . When I first got here , I ’ d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home . I almost let it get to me , but then I started going out , keeping myself busy and before I knew it , I was used to to it . 
 OK . how does this sound . let ’ s get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight . I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there ! 
 Not at all ! It be fun ! It will be like a boys ’ night out ... well kinda ... 
 Hello . 
 No , Lily is not here at the moment . 
 Sure . What ’ s your number , please . 
 Thanks . And your name is Tony , right ? 
 You ’ re welcome . Bye . 
 Sir , your hair is done . Anything else I can do for you ? 
 All right , sir . Would you lie back so that I can shave you ? 
 Don't worry , sir . I've never cut a customer . Shall I trim your moustache ? 
 Now , I've finished . How do you like it ? 
 20 dollars . 
 Bye-bye . Welcome to come next time ! 
 It really depends on you . 
 If I were you , I'd buy . 
 You did ? 
 What do you think now ? 
 But I still say Americans spend a lot more money on useless things than we Chinese do . 
 Excuse me , Is this the bus I should take to get to the Central Park ? 
 Where should I change for the Park ? 
 But I don't know which stop is Tinge Depot . 
 Thank you . 
 Do you mind if I ask you to practice speaking English with me ? 
 Well , I'm meeting some American friends next weekend . 
 Is there a sofa in the living room ? 
 That ’ s too bad . Is there a desk in the living room then ? 
 Where are the chairs ? 
 Are you free tomorrow , Sam ? 
 I'm going to go hiking . Do you want to join me ? 
 Please wait till your name is called . OK . Your bill includes the doctor's fee and the cost for a 3 - day supply of medicine . It comes to one hundred yuan . 
 Good . Here is the receipt . The dispensary is over there ... By the way , will this be covered by your insurance from work ? 
 In that case , I'll give you a certificate , so you can get it reimbursed . 
 Don't lose this receipt , because insurance companies are very difficult about helping when they don't have the right paperwork . 
 Yeah , they all received very strict training . A minute on the stage takes ten-year practice . 
 Exactly , you know , water ballet puts dancing , music and swimming together . 
 That's my boy ! Katherine Curtis created this activity in 1920 . And in 1984 , it was authorized as one activity in Olympic Games . 
 My little boy , you should learn more from me . I'm almost thirty years older than you . 
 Oh , my God . It's so dangerous . And he might break his leg . You mustn't do anything like that . 
 Somebody broke into my house in the morning . 
 About 12 o'clock , when I came home from work . 
 I wonder how the burglar did it . 
 That's because we have a strong lock . 
 Did you find anything ? 
 Oh , er ... sorry that's because we didn't have time to clean it . 
 Definitely not , sir . 
 I'm afraid he's having an important meeting now . Can I help you ? 
 Of course , he would . Would you leave them with me ? 
 We're thinking of ordering some special styles of summer clothes . We should be interested in your products if they are of the styles we want . 
 How long would it take you to deliver the orders ? 
 Good . I'll send your catalogues to those who are interested . Meanwhile , may I have an indication of price ? Can I have your price-sheet ? 
 Could you please cover for me two hours this morning ? 
 I have to see the dentist . We have an appointment for this morning from 9 to 11 o ’ clock . So if there is any phone call , please pick up for me . If there is something urgent , tell them I will be back in two hours . 
 Yes , I will need it . Thanks . 
 Of course , where do you want me to stand ? 
 I'm glad you're replacing it . We need more space to work on things . How deep will the new workbench be ? 
 Well , it's about 65 cm at the moment . Could we increase it by about a third ? 
 I've read your report , and I'm not sure I agree with you.You think you can get attendance improved by requiring salaried employees to take their all of their sick days ? 
 We give them 10 or 15 sick days per year . Surely requiring people to take them couldn't possibly help . It sounds like a counter - productive policy change to me . 
 I see . So our current policies are encouraging sick people to come to work , resulting in more sick employees . 
 Let's give it a shot ! 
 No , thanks . I've really got to go now . 
 You , too . 
 What happened to you ? You look like you got hit by a tornado ! 
 You mean at the mall ? Was there a sale ? 
 Cool ! 
 Do you want a cigarette ? 
 You don't mind if I have one . 
 Yes , you are right . 
 I've tried to give up smoking several times , but it's no use . 
 Yes , I did , Ms . Chen . 
 I'm positive , Ms . Chen . 
 Let's line up here . This line seems a little shorter . 
 Fish , beef , pork , chicken , vegetables and beancurd . For staple food we have rice , steamed bread , stuffed buns and noodles . 
 I'd rather take stewed cabbage with beef . 
 That's good , we can share what we have . Here we are . You go ahead . 
 I'm sorry I don't like it's a little too salty . 
 Yes , I like the fish cooked in sweet and sour sauce best . Try some beef , please . 
 Your appetite is good . 
 Mr . Thomas is making a long-distance call . Please wait for a few minutes . 
 Coffee would be fine . 
 I like it black . 
 Are there other chores for us to do ? 
 You used to do this by yourself ? 
 I'll do the second floor and you do the first floor . 
 What about you ? 
 Did you remember to bring back that software I lent to you ? 
 That ’ s ok . If you could just bring it in tomorrow , I would appreciate it . 
 Good morning . Ru Via Hotel , Room Reservation . Can I help you ? 
 How and in whose name has the reservation been made ? 
 Please wait a moment . I'll check it in the computer . Thanks for your waiting . You've booked 10 standard rooms for trade negotiation for March 5th , 6th and 7th , is it correct ? 
 Let me check the reservation list . Fortunately , we have just 10 standard rooms available for the three days . 
 She does have a heart of gold . 
 I feel dizzy and I have a headache . 
 Since yesterday . 
 Excuse me , can I change my order ? I am afraid I don't have so much time to enjoy my dinner . 
 That's all right . 
 Yes , what seems to be the problem ? 
 I am afraid not . Have you lost your passport ? 
 Where exactly did you use your passport in the store ? 
 Well , let me call the shoe department to see if they ’ Ve found a passport . Sorry , your passport hasn't turned up there either . 
 You can fill in this lost property report and I will keep my eye out for it . These kinds of things usually turn up eventually , but I suggest you contact your embassy and tell them about your situation , so they can issue you a new passport in case it doesn't show up . 
 Here you are . 
 Beautiful day , isn't it ? 
 I wish it would stay this way for the weekend . 
 She is so stupid . 
 So what ? 
 I hate landing in the sand trap ! Now I'm probably going to waste strokes getting it out . 
 Could you hand me my wedge ? I'll try ... 
 No . you go ahead and putt it out . Then I'Il go . 
 How will you spend this lovely weekend ? 
 We haven't played chess for a long time . How about playing chess ? 
 Don ’ t worry , I will teach you how to win . 
 See you tomorrow . 
 Hi , is that Jessica ? 
 I want to inform you of the interview . 
 I said I am informing you of the interview . 
 What range of salary do you have for this position ? 
 It sounds amazing to me . 
 No , I only know four great beauties of China . 
 Yeah ? Were they famous because of the ugliness ? 
 Then who were they ? 
 It seems that the inner beauty is also important . 
 Daddy , what's next ? What else do we do now ? 
 Great . Let's go . Where is it ? 
 We have many cookies left here . Can we use them as baits ? 
 So let's go and catch earth worms ! 
 Daddy , do you think we're gonna catch any fish today ? We've been fishing here for more than two hours , and we get nothing . 
 I love sashimi . Did mom bring any soy sauce for that ? 
 Cool . Hey , I've got an idea . Why don't we cook it separately ? Half for sashimi , and the other half for grill . 
 Well , all right . There is nothing to complain about . 
 Great ! I would like to see cute pandas , too . 
 We can take the MET and get off at the Zoo Station . 
 ( At the zoo ) Wow ! This zoo is really huge . 
 Look at the map . It has different areas , such as marine lives , mammals , polar animals and insects . 
 We have to go to the mammal area . We are at the gate right now . We need to go straight from here and turn left and go along to the end and make anotherleft turn . 
 Well , if you have no further questions , then we have done . 
 You ’ re welcome . I appreciate your coming . 
 We need to consider several other applicants and we hope to make a decision by the end of this month . We will call you regardless of whether you are hired or not . 
 Well , I really appreciate your coming today . 
 Good-bye . 
 When did you last time have your eyes checked ? 
 Come over here . I will test your eyes . First cover your left eye like this , and when I point , please read the chart from the top , and go as far as you can telling me which way the “ E ” points . 
 Good . Now the other eye . 
 Never mind , just read as far as you can . 
 Hello , Madam . What can we do for you today ? 
 I certainly do . Here it is , an Export L / C from Tokyo . 
 Yes , it is . Sayuri Beds , Tokyo , Japan . 
 Just sign right here , please . That's everything you need to do . 
 I want to try something different today . 
 I want a different hair style . 
 Can you make my hair short ? 
 Make it a few inches long . 
 I've been thinking about this for a while now . 
 I honestly want my hair that short . 
 Hi Mark . 
 How was your summer vacation ? 
 I took summer school . I withdrew from two of my classes last year so I wanted to make them up . 
 Yeah . And I have 5 credits to spare . I only needed to take 10 credits over the summer , but I took 15 because the price was the same . 
 She dropped out of school completely . 
 She worked at a startup company as an intern and since the business did well , they asked her if she wanted to work full time . 
 It sounds good now , but I'm traditional . I want the degree , so I wouldn't have accepted the offer . 
 I don't know . But I bet it must have been a good offer , or she wouldn't have accepted it . 
 Yes , a red wine and a cup of coffee . 
 With milk but without sugar , please . 
 Yes , please . 
 Sure . Wait a moment . 
 OK . 
 Yes . 
 It'll start on lst September . 
 Hello , this is the property manager . How may I help you ? 
 What room was the leak in ? 
 Are you on the top floor , or is there another apartment above you ? 
 I will be sending someone out as soon as I can get hold of the roofer . Will you be home this morning ? 
 Fine . If you do end up going somewhere , we can just use our pass key . 
 About 3 weeks . 
 By the end of this month , at the latest . 
 It has fifty parking spaces . 
 Why ? 
 Quite the contrary , sir . Plenty of the spaces here are free when people drive their cars out to work . 
 We plan to rent some of them out at the hourly rates . 
 I am not sure . But it'll be at least ten yuan an hour . 
 That would be twenty yuan , sir . We charge only by the number of hours , no split of each hour . 
 Does your child still believe in Santa Claus ? 
 How sweet . 
 When are you going to tell her that Santa Claus doesn't exist ? 
 May I help you ? 
 This way , please . How do you like this one ? It's made of cotton . 
 Yes , ma'am , how could I help you ? 
 Yes , we do . 
 From 200 to 800 . 
 No problem . 
 Not much . 
 That sounds good . 
 Candlelight in the Window 
 I'd rather not . I don't like horror movies . 
 No . I heard that's really boring . 
 Great idea ! 
 Yes , my house is far away from here . May I ask for an apartment ? 
 That's great . Thank you so much . 
 I received some leaflets in the post from you , one of them talked about a new service you have where you can transfer money between this bank and securities companies . Is that right ? 
 I also read that if the customer is a stock investor , which I am , it's possible to get additional benefits ? 
 What if I don't want to come in to the branch , can I use the consultation service over the phone ? 
 Mr Hughes ? Do you have a minute ? I would like to discuss something with you . 
 I was wondering , I have heard many of my co-wokers that your knowledge and experience in international markets is phenomenal . Also , I ’ Ve heard the rumor that you speak fluent Japanese . Is that right ? 
 Right now I ’ m working on a product launch project to open up our Asian market . We have several upcoming events to take place for the Japanese cities . We ’ ll be heading to Tokyo next month to get things started . What I would like to talk to you about is joining our team to help bring this project to completion . 
 We aer looking for someone who is familiar with the market and cultural issues to act as an advisor to our marketing staff . We would like to set up a partnership , where we can help each other . 
 We could give you an uncite office , as well as potential to develop your own contracts in Japan.At the same time , after helping with our project , we will be willing to split our profit with you . 
 Of course . 
 I have a plan for handling WebTracker . Step one is the Stars.com contract . 
 Don't worry about that , Dave . Look , I have to see Vince now . Think about what I said . 
 Oh , no , I'v already made several trips to Guangzhou , this is my first trip to Beijing though.It is a lot larger than I expected it would be . 
 I hope to have time to visit great wall when I am here , I always want to go there , I think it would be a real shame by came all the way in Beijing and didn't make out the wall , do you think I have a chance to see it ? 
 Yes , that would be nice , would I have a tour guide to tour completely visit these places ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Room service . Can I help you ? 
 What would you like , sir ? 
 It will take about 20 minutes , sir . Is that all right ? 
 Of course , sir . 
 Yes , I can , but not very well . 
 At school . And I'm still learning it now . 
 About three years . 
 I'm afraid not . 
 What kind ? 
 You need to keep a minimum balance . 
 You need at least $ 100 in your account . 
 Yes . That ’ s the minimum . 
 You will get a fine . 
 It ’ s going to be $ 25 . 
 I have a part-time job now , so I work in the evenings . 
 Excuse me , but can you tell me the way to the railway station ? 
 About how long will it take me to get there ? 
 I see . Is there a bus I can take ? 
 Thank you so much for your help . 
 Can I make preservation now ? 
 9:45 , please . We want a table next to the window . 
 In that case , please help us reserve a table for 4 at 9:00 . 
 Oh , okay . I can get it back when I move out , right ? 
 All right . Here's the lease and the check for the deposit . 
 Whew ! I had to wait for almost an hour to get to the front of the line . 
 Wow ! Your calligraphy is very beautiful . It was worth the wait ! 
 What does it say ? 
 That's very nice . Is it for sale ? 
 Really ? Then what do you do with it ? 
 Wow ! Really ? Are you sure ? Now I'll have a lucky year ! 
 Linda , this is Todd calling . 
 Linda , I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed our time together last Friday night . 
 I had a great time too and was thinking that maybe you might want to join me for a hike to the waterfalls on Saturday . 
 Linda , that would be a perfect addition . 
 I was hoping to leave by 9 o'clock so that it won \ ' t be too hot for the hike . 
 Hi , can I help you ? 
 What's your name , Sir ? 
 Yes Sir . We have your reservation . Could you fill up these forms , please ? 
 Yes , Sir . That's correct . 
 Yes . I'll have the shrimp cocktail to start . 
 I'll have a steak , medium rare . 
 May I have your room number 。 Sir ? 
 Just a minute , Sir.Are you Mr Wang from China ? 
 Mr Wang , did you sign any bill in the last two hours in our hotel ? 
 Have you used any hotel services this morning ? 
 Here is your bill.It totals 3250 dollars . 
 What kind of card ? 
 Yes , we do . Here is your bill and receipt . 
 The company regulates that men should wear a suit and tie in business meeting . Company policy is not negotiable . 
 hello , this is the International Student Office . My name is Leah . How may I help you ? 
 ok . Can I ask who is calling , please ? 
 and what is your call regarding ? 
 ok , I'll try and put you through . Please hold .

 I got it . When should I have her call you back ? 
 ok , Nathaniel . I'll have Ms . Collins call you back sometime tonight before 6 pm . 
 bye ! 
 People of different races are fit for quite different sports . For instance , Asians are especially good fattable tennis , badminton , diving and shooting . They seem to have been born with certain natural endowments in technical sports , in which flexibility , agility and quick reflexes are favorable . 
 Yes , in all these four sports . the Chinese Olympic dream teams led the way . They swept the floor against their opponents in table tennis and diving . 
 I think they are in a better position in those sports that demand a high degree of intensity , speed and explosive force like swimming , field games , etc . 
 It's common sense that African athletes always make a clean sweep in track events , middle or long distance races , relays , hurdles , barriers , and marathon . 
 I need your help . 
 I locked myself out . What do you suggest I do ? 
 I see that there are Olympic mascots in your car . 
 Me , too . I want to be a volunteer for 2008 Beijing Olympics . 
 No problem . I'm an ' Olympic expert ' . 
 The ancient Olympics originated in ancient Greece . 
 They name it after the place where it was first held . 
 This question is a piece of cake . A Frenchman named Baron de Coubertin . 
 Of course he was called ' the father of the Olympics ' . 
 He once made a speech on the ‘ Renaissance of the Olympics ' . 
 I've told you I'm an expert . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Yes , I'd like to see the manager.Here ' s my card . 
 No , I'm afraid I don't . Is it possible for me to see him now ? 
 Well , how long will it be ? 
 That's too bad . I can't wait that long . I have another appointment at ten . 
 No , I have discussed the details about sales of our new equipment with the manager on the telephone yesterday . 
 Yes , I suppose that's the best thing I can do for now . I'll be here on Thursday morning at 10 o'clock . Is that all right ? 
 We have waited for a long time . When will we start ? 
 Do you think I could use your car tomorrow ? I ’ Ve got a date with this girl , see ? And ... 
 Nine thirty ? That ’ s no good . Couldn ’ t I have it a bit longer ? Even if I fill up the tank ? 
 You don't look very well . 
 Is it because of the bad weather ? It's been really miserable for the past tew days . 
 Not really , but I've got used to it now . 
 Not quite good . It's windy and dry . We have got continental climate there . It's dry all the year round . Usually autumn is the best season of the year In New York . 
 No , it isn't very cold at that time . You'll only need some light wool clothing with somejackets and shirts . 
 OK . How much is the fare ? 
 45 yuan ? It is too much , Are you sure ? 
 Is there something wrong with your meter ? 
 OK . Could you give me a receipt ? 
 Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 Have you made a reservation ? 
 Yes , children are half price . 
 Have you ever seen coco ? 
 I'm so familiar with her songs , but I don't know what kind of person she is in real life . 
 Yes of course . This is a really good one actually . 
 This one is 1500 yuan . 
 Would you like anything else ? 
 How much are these in all ? 
 Here is my member card . Can I have someone carry those bags to my car ? 
 Hi , Carlos . What are you doing this afternoon ? 
 Well . I was just wondering if you would come by and give me a hand with the fliers for next week ’ s party . 
 We're considering of ordering 200 computers , but I'm wondering about the price you'll possibly offer . 
 Your price is higher than I expected . Could you give us a little discount ? 
 But the price is always negotiable and you should consider our quantity of order . 
 Could you make it $ 4500 ? 
 Can we meet each other half way ? 
 Let's close the deal at $ 4800 , OK ? 
 Valerie ! Hi ! Wow how are you ? It ’ s been such a long time ! 
 Really ? Thanks ! I went to that hair salon that you told me about , but enough about me ! Look at you ! You haven ’ t aged a day since the last time I saw you ! What is your secret ! 
 Yes , my little Paul is finally a doctor . They grow up so fast you know . 
 Thank you ! What about your daughter , Pamela ? I heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently . 
 Such a lovely girl . I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday ! 
 Same here ! We will catch up soon , maybe over coffee ! 
 See you soon ! Bye ! Egg ... I can ’ t stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter . 
 Well you should have picked , in the end you always complain about everything . 
 I ’ m thinking of taking you back home . I thought we could have a nice evening , but you ’ re always so negative . 
 You see , that ’ s what I ’ m talking about , I can ’ t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore . 
 Well he ’ s more of a man than you are ; at least he appreciates love stories . 
 Don ’ t criticize Mario or else I ’ ll start on those fat , drunk friends of yours , they ’ re no saints . 
 You ’ re unbearable , you can walk home , I ’ m leaving . 
 The brain ! 
 The heart ! 
 The stomach and intestines ! 
 Yeah ! Our kidneys , liver and bladder ! 
 So what do these organs do , teacher ? 
 I am unsure how to add a class and need help . 
 Yes , I have an add sheet . 
 No , I'm not sure . 
 Thanks . I understand what to do now . 
 That sounds good . 
 Excuse me . 
 I've never used this place before.Can you give me some idea what I need to do ? 
 Yes , but ... well ... 
 How do I use the machines ? 
 I see . Do the machines have soap in them ? 
 No . I don't have soap . 
 Thanks.Okay . I have my soap . 
 I don't know . I want my clothes to be clean . 
 Oh . I guess I didn't know . I have never washed clothes before . 
 Yes . 
 No . Never . 
 I'm nineteen . 
 My mother always did it . 
 I know about this fact.American children are more independent . They do more for themselves.But I am from Taiwan . In Taiwan , children must study very hard.So the mother does everything for the kids.The mother wants her kids to get very good grades at school.So I've never washed clothes before . You shouldn't laugh at me for it . 
 What ? 
 I don't know . It's hard . But I have to learn . 
 Thanks . My name's Nick . 
 Thanks , Mom . Thanks . 
 Tom Hanks is always my favorite film star . 
 Many ! 
 With an ocean view ? 
 A double room without a view for just one night ? 
 Yes , we do . 
 You seem to like her very much , don't you ? 
 But I heard that she had a three-year-old girl . 
 Have you had any publications ? 
 How about your communication skills ? 
 Tell me something about yourself and your past . 
 What was the most significant project you've worked on ? 
 What finance experience makes you qualified for this position ? 
 How would your coworkers evaluate you ? 
 What are your salary expectations ? 
 Can you speak English ? 
 Where did you learn it ? 
 What else can you speak ? 
 Hey , don ’ t walk on the lawn . 
 You lost your wallet ? Anything important in it ? 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry to hear that . I think you ’ d better talk to the police officer walking there . 
 You are welcome . 
 Great ! I went hiking in the mountains on Saturday . 
 Really good ! you should try it sometime . 
 Uh , nothing much , just went to bed early . I was still tired from Saturday . 
 No.The time we have spent apart has been good for us.Absence makes the heart grow fonder . 
 I haven't started yet , but I will . 
 I'm planning on cleaning it up a little later . 
 I know . I am still going to clean it up . 
 I won't forget . 
 My plans aren't until later , so I'll clean it before I go . 
 Yes , I need some traveler's checks . 
 Three thousand US dollars . 
 Yes , here you go . 
 It's all the same to me . 
 Thanks . 
 I want to return this video . 
 I also need to check this magazine out . 
 I don ’ t understand . 
 What can I check out ? 
 I need this magazine . 
 That ’ s weird . 
 It's $ 1.25 for this bus . 
 I started driving the bus a few months ago . 
 Not at all . 
 I never did either , but it pays the bills . 
 I liked talking to you too . 
 They aren't evenly matched . 
 Yet the Argentine attacker is worth a bet . 
 In that case , I won ’ t keep you any longer . Drop in anytime . 
 See you later . 
 What ? You ’ re tired ? But we just started about twenty minutes ago . 
 What ’ s the matter ? Didn ’ t you sleep well last night ? 
 Then when did you go to sleep ? 
 When ? 
 Oh , Susie . Didn ’ t I tell you over and over again that you wouldn ’ t be able to climb the mountain unless you got enough sleep ? 
 This is a one-day trip . We ’ ll have to keep going and try to reach the top by noon or give up right now and go home . Which one do you choose ? 
 So , make up your mind quickly . Whether to keep going or give up . 
 Good morning . I ’ m thinking about buying some new furniture for my living room . Could you help me ? 
 I came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . I think I like the black leather suite . It ’ s on sale , isn't it ? 
 I ’ ll take it . I also need to improve the lighting in my living room . Do you have any suggestions ? 
 It ’ s quite large . It ’ s about 40 square meters . 
 OK . I like the design of this lamps . I also need some cushion covers . I ’ ll just browse through those ones over there . 
 You've got a large collection of sample foodstuffs here . 
 I'm particularly interested in shortbreads . Do you have some samples you could show me ? 
 The small sizes are more marketable than the large ones for us . I wonder if Your pastry tastes better . 
 Oh , it's delicious ... 
 Don't you have one like this in blue ? 
 Do you need every color in the rainbow ? 
 Ze ze ze ... Women ! 
 Unbelievable ! How do people go through it ? 
 I wish I had a chance to see it with my own eyes . 
 My wife and I want to go to Beijing for a tour . Can you arrange it ? 
 I'd like to know what kind of tour your travel agency has . 
 Excellent . 
 September 28th . 
 We would like to visit the Great Wall , the Ming Tombs and the Imperial Palace . 
 Did you watch the movie program on Channel 6 last night ? 
 I wonder why TV programs often show much violence . 
 They are especially harmful to teenagers . 
 so , have you seen all three The Lord of the Rings movies ? 
 that's the Return of the King , right ? 
 I thought the special effects were amazing , but I got a bit confused . The plot was too complicated for me . 
 no . did you ? 
 yes , trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me . 
 most movies are . Another problem for me was the film was dubbed in German with English subtitles . 
 I heard that The Return of the King was nominated for 11 Oscars . 
 what are you looking for ? 
 do you know what camcorder options are available ? 
 would you like to look at the new digital camcorders that have just come in ? 
 ok . This Sony model is their newest and our most popular camcorder . Why don't you see if you like the way it feel ? 
 it's got an above-average battery life . It lasts up tp 12 hours and can be charged in 30 minutes . 
 yes , that is an option . 
 yes . I can show you examples of some footages that was taken with this camera in the dark . 
 It can record any sound that's within about 8 feet of the camera . 
 there are models that can pick up more sound than this one , but they're much bigger and heavier than this one . 
 Do you know how to drive ? 
 Could you teach me how to drive ? 
 Yes , I have my learner's permit . 
 I've only driven a car one time . 
 I know them . 
 We can do it when you have some time . 
 Paul , a company called me for an interview . 
 How ? 
 OK . 
 Is a white blouse OK ? 
 How about make up ? 
 I never watch foreign films . They're too boring . 
 Hey , it is ! A lot of people like that movie ! 
 Face it , you don't like action movies because you're a snob . 
 Hi , good morning , Miss ? what can I help you with ? 
 OK , please put it on this scale.Airmail or by sea ? 
 Usually about two month . 
 About ten days . 
 Let me see.It ' s 57 dollars , 20 cents , including tax . 
 Although it's expensive to send it by airmail , it's quicker and safer than by sea . 
 Do you want to ensure the contents , Miss ? 
 Please fill out this form , also please write the value of the items in this space . 
 How's Jimmy today ? 
 Can I see him please , Mrs Williams ? 
 You look very well , Jimmy . You are better now , but you mustn't get up yet.You must stay in bed for another two days.The boy mustn't go to school yet , Mrs Williams . And he mustn't eat rich food . 
 No , he doesn ’ t . 
 Yes . He must remain in bed for another two days . He can get up for about two hours each day , but you must keep the room warm . Where's Mr Williams this evening ? 
 I think this one will do . 
 Why ? What's wrong with it ? 
 I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks . 
 Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market . 
 Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen . 
 In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course . 
 Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal . 
 The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10 % commission will not leave us much . 
 We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with . 
 Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ? 
 Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products . 
 Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ? 
 All right , but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair . And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency . 
 I am really tired of Terry . 
 He is a bootlicker . I suppose that is because he is quick on the uptake . 
 A cheeseburger and an order of french fries would be great . 
 I feel like having a Coke . 
 I hear your sister has had an accident , is it true ? 
 That's a crying shame . It really is ! 
 John , do you mind helping me prepare for the picnic ? 
 Yes . It says it will be sunny all day . No sign of rain at all . 
 Okay . Please take some fruit salad and crackers for me . 
 That's great . We can also take the dragon kite with us . After the picnic , we can fly it . 
 Okay , it sounds good . 
 I'm allergic to these things , you know . 
 Let ’ s go over there and get some milk , a couple dozen eggs and some orange juice . 
 OK . But just let me pick up a bottle of cooking wine and oil as we go by . 
 Hi , David . You are very difficult to reach . I called several times . But I kept getting a busy signal . Is your phone out of order ? 
 Ok . Let me call you later . Is that okay ? 
 Reception . May I help you ? 
 Certainly . Where are you now ? 
 OK . Just wait where you are . I'll send someone up to help you . 
 I would like to see your summer suits . 
 Will it wash well and the color won't fade ? 
 My son has really taken it out of me . He never keeps out of mischief . 
 Yeah . Anyway he is driving me mad . 
 Sure , just ask . What can I do for you ? 
 No sweat . It ’ s a piece of cake . 
 Absolutely . I ’ m a great mechanic . 
 Anytime . 
 Yeah , I'm OK , I have been having a lot of mood swings lately . I think it has to do with the pills my doctor prescribed that are causing chaos on my hormones . 
 Yeah , it's weird . For example just this morning I was feeling detached and lonely , even though there was really no reason to feel that way . 
 I hope you are right . 
 That ’ s alright . 
 Surely it is . 
 You can nod or ask questions at the right time to show that you have already understood or you are quite interested in his words . 
 Don't move from time to time . It is very impolite and will make you nervous . 
 The best would be you have a smile on your face in the interview to win a good impression of the interviewer . 
 Throughout the interview you should maintain patience . 
 Only in this way can you leave the interviewer a good impression and achieve success . 
 I'm interested in taking a tour to Sydney . 
 How much does it cost ? 
 Does that include the insurance ? 
 Can I help you , madam ? 
 Would you like to try this one on ? 
 All right . How about this one ? 
 Of course , madam . 
 Well , have you thought of getting an MBA ? I heard it does wonders in getting you to the top . 
 Nonsense ! The business schools measure your ability through a test called GMAT . 
 Graduate Management Admission Test , it contains three parts 
 Up to you , you could have a one on one session with a tutor or group sessions , you can also use free or private computer software . Going to church might help as well ! 
 Umm . . . That's the spirit ! 
 Lily broke up with me last week . In fact , she dumped me . 
 She said it was because we had very different ideas about life . 
 Of course not . I knew she had fallen in love with another guy . It is difficult to see her move on so quickly . 
 Thank you , Steven . You are really a good friend . 
 Sure . I'll do it after lunch . What length do you need ? 
 Yes , no problem . It'll be ready by 2 p . m . 
 I think that the public transport system could be made simpler . I never know where the bus routes actually go . The routes seem to twist and turn rather than going roughly in a straight line . 
 If we built more roads , people would just fill them with cars again . I think we should discourage people from using their cars . 
 I think we should do a few things at once . Improving public transport would encourage people to use that . If we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre , they won ’ t use their cars as much . 
 I think that they should pay more tax . Look at the damage they cause to the environment and people ’ s health by discharging all those exhaust fumes . 
 That ’ s a good point . Car owners will probably be against it , but people who use public transport will be in favor of it . 
 Sure . What's your room number , sir ? 
 A minute , please . It's 6212 yuan all together . Tax included . 
 Sure . Can I have your passport , please ? 
 Thanks . Are you satisfied with your stay here with us , sir ? 
 Sure . It will be taken care of , sir . Which flight do you take ? 
 Got it , sir . It'd be great to see you again , sir . 
 Excuse me , sir , I'm afraid you can't park your car here . 
 I'm afraid not , sir . 
 But I saw a red car always parking here before . 
 Maybe . But the car of this space has a broken rearview mirror on the left . 
 Could you wait for a minute , sir ? I'd like to have a check . 
 Sorry , sir , my mistake . This is your parking space . 
 Hi , Ellen . That outfit looks terrific ! 
 No , we just don ’ t usually admit it ! 
 I need help with the office party . 
 I have no idea what the entertainment should be . 
 Let's make it a formal affair . 
 American food would be the best choice . 
 We should bring in a really good DJ . 
 Cigarette ? 
 Sorry , here . 
 I ’ ll stand in with you if you like . I ’ Ve got nothing else to do . 
 Have you thought of moving at all , Sarah ? 
 Buying a house can be expensive , but there are ways to find cheaper houses . 
 Well , sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . You ’ d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day , but you would definitely save money doing it that way . 
 Sure , my sister-in-law and her husband just bought a house that way . They ’ re pretty satisfied with it . 
 Not at all . The woman , who owned it , took good care of it . But when she died , she had no family left and no will , so the government had to sell it for her . 
 It was about 75 years old . There were a few repairs that needed doing , but it didn ’ t take a lot of money or time . 
 The area can be a bit rough in the evenings , but the neighbors watch out for each other , so it ’ s ok . 
 Do you already know how to play an instrument ? 
 Aside from yourself , who are the other members of the band ? 
 Yes , I ’ m a singer . 
 Great ! Wait here ? You don ’ t have enough room for the amplifiers , microphones or even your drums ! By the way where do you keep them or practice ? 
 Yes . It's really wonderful here The grass is greener and the air is fresher than those in the city . 
 Great , let's go . 
 En , it's so beautiful that I don't want to move my eyes from it . 
 The same to me . All the things here make me happy , the mountain , the water , the grass , the birds , the sunshine ... 
 That's the point . We should walk into the nature and enjoy its beauty whenever we have time . 
 Do I need a visa ? 
 Yes , I know . I must get my traveler ’ s check and some foreign currency . 
 Really ? That ’ s very good of you , Helen . But I must get a new suitcase , my old one needs repairing . 
 That ’ s very kind of you , Helen . I hope you don ’ t mind my leaving you like this . I need a holiday . It won ’ t be long . 
 So , where is this bus supposed to take us ? 
 Well , don't you know for sure ? 
 Are you sure we got on the right bus ? 
 This place doesn't look like Altadena . 
 Read one of the street signs or something . 
 That's the last time I'm trusting you with the transportation . 
 How do you do ? 
 Do you mind if I introduce myself ? My name is Wang Li . 
 Yes , I am . 
 Yes , very . They make the trip in about an hour . 
 No , I hope not . I want to have a deck chair and enjoy the crossing . 
 The sea seems quite calm , so there will be no fear of seasickness . Are you seasick ? 
 I'm not a very good sailor , either . My mother is a dreadfully poor sailor . In fact , she never takes a voyage unless she has to . I am better than that , and even on the Pacific . after ten days of it , I can still find my sea legs . Well , happily we shall have a smooth passage today . 
 Yeah , I am of the same opinion . 
 Better now . We are just back from the hospital . We were lucky to meet a well-known doctor . 
 He said that he had a really bad cold . 
 The dispensary closed . Here is the given prescription . 
 Probably not . Some medicine we need is ethical drug which you can't buy without a prescription . 
 I'll go back home with Danny . You go to the pharmacy again . 
 What ? How come ? The third time ? 
 Be careful . 
 I want to save some US dollars into my account . 
 Yes , that's what my husband advised me to do . But I'm not sure how long I should save for . 
 Mmmm ... 2 years does seem like a long time . How about the interest if I save for 6 months ? 
 That sounds fine to me . Yes , I think 6 months is the way to go . 
 No , that's okay , I already have a coke.Why don't you have a seat , you look like you've been on your feet all day . 
 It's great ! The mountains here are beautiful and the skiing is spectacular.Have you been here for a long time ? 
 What do you do for a living ? 
 Wow , talk about job perks ! That's great . I would like to do something exciting like that.But I am only an accountant.Not too much excitement there.huh ? 
 Jenny , you should go to bed now . 
 Don't stay up late . 
 Well , honey . Turn off the light , lie down and go to sleep . 
 Not yet . Do we need to take it with us ? 
 Is that hard to get a passport ? 
 It is hard to believe this little thing is so valuable to us . 
 No , but the nurse at school says that I should have my blood pressure checked . 
 No , I have never been told that I have high blood pressure . 
 How do you check for high blood pressure ? 
 What do the numbers mean ? 
 Good . That will help me know how I am doing . 
 Oh , you didn ’ t know that apartments here are considered valuable , even if they are small and crowded ? 
 I don ’ t mind paying high rent to live in New York . 
 Yeah , but so what ! I ’ m proud to live in the world ’ s most exciting city . And , the salaries here are the highest in the nation , too . 
 No , madam.May I help you ? 
 No problem.Step in , please . 
 Your face is so red , you must running a temperature . 
 Please go to see a doctor . 
 Bobby ! Come here , look what I got you ! 
 A chess board ! Daddy is going to teach you how to play ! 
 Ok , each player gets 16 pieces . You can be the white ones and I ’ ll play with the black pieces . Now in the front , you set up the pawns . Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . When you are about to capture another piece , it can move one space diagonally . 
 See this one that looks like a tower ? It ’ s called the rook . The one with the tall hat is called the bishop . See this little horsey ? This is called the knight , it ’ s a very important piece so it ’ s best to not let your opponent capture it . 
 That ’ s right ! That ’ s the queen and that ’ s the king . If the other player captures your king , he will say Check Mate and the game is over ! Doesn ’ t this sound fun ? 
 Good morning , Mr.Robinson . I am afraid there is a change in today's program . I just got word that your appointment with Mr . Smith , the general manager of Western Textile Co . , Ltd . , will have to be put off . 
 Mr.Smith called just now that he had to fly to Shanghai on urgent business today . 
 Mr.Smith is sending his apologies and has asked me to find out if the day after tomorrow would be all right with you . 
 Then shall we make it nine o'clock the day after tomorrow morning ? 
 I'm hungry . Do we have anything to eat ? 
 That's fine with me . 
 What's the difference ? 
 You must have bought many things in the mall ? 
 It's wise to do it . The Americans have the habit of selling their junk when they are moving to another place , so they usually display all the things they want to sell in their gardens at the weekend . And many things they are selling still look quite new and they are also very useful . 
 You must have got many useful things for your new apartment . 
 Huh ? Me ? 
 Why should I do that ? It's only a piece of garbage . Why should you care ? 
 Listen , I really don't know why you're making this into such a big issue . It's only a small piece of garbage in a large space . It's not like there's garbage everywhere . Besides , someone will come along to clean it up at some time or another . 
 Ok , whatever . See , I'm putting it in the garbage can . 
 I have difficulty with this form . Will you please explain it to me ? 
 Oh , that's great . Thank you very much . 
 Why ? 
 Oh , good . 
 I prefer TV play to football . 
 What are you going to do ? 
 Maybe we can enjoy the TV play together . It's interesting . 
 I didn't realize it was so difficult though I know I'm always too nervous in such competition . 
 I don't think I performed well . 
 Can you tell me how to improve myself ? 
 Thank you for your encouragement . 
 Hi there . How can I help ? 
 I see . And your company has a Wage Distribution Service Agreement with us ? 
 Yes , that's a Current-all-in-one Passbook . That's what you need to get your salary . 
 Well , we could probably get started with a strategy meeting tomorrow morning at 8: 00 . 
 That's fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ? 
 I am sorry . It's not allowed . You have to wait till the next station . 
 Can you please slow down ? I am not in a hurry . 
 Lily , do you know Lizzy ? 
 Lizzy smith . 
 Then , Do you know her younger sister ? 
 Yes . 
 Oh , not bad . Then do you know her mother ? 
 That sounds terrific . 
 I just want to visit the family some day . 
 Me too . 
 Of course , but I'll have to go now . 
 Yes . Let ’ s say Tuesday at noon . Bring your portfolio with you . 
 No , that ’ s all . I already have your resume . 
 I'm sorry . He's not in right now . 
 He should be back in ten minutes . Could 1 you call back later ? 
 I ’ Ve had it ! I ’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere ! 
 That ’ s exactly what I am going to do ! I ’ Ve decided to create my own company ! I ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself ! 
 Well , no , it can ’ t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ? 
 Well , that seems easy enough . 
 Geez . Is that all ? 
 Umm . I think I ’ ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business ! 
 The same with the previous speaker , we must know how things stand with us . 
 It's the time to emphasize sense of crises . 
 I'm going out this Saturday . 
 Unfortunately , we do . Let's plan for something together for Wednesday . We can go right after work . 
 We won't have much time , so let's play somewhere close to work . 
 How much does it cost over there ? 
 That's pretty good . Let's do it . 
 Make it 4 
 Sounds good . I'll see you on Wednesday then . 
 Will do . 
 Oh , that's all right . 
 No . Forget about it . It's not important . 
 Please dissolve the powder in hot water . Soak your hand or foot in it for 20 minutes twice a day . 
 Put the eye-drop into your right eye 4 - - 6 times a day , 1 - - 2 drops each time . Squeeze a bit of the ointment on your eyelid every night . 
 You're welcome . 
 I may get some fruit . 
 I tend to only eat grapes and apples . 
 I've always liked green apples . 
 Why do you say that ? 
 You'd rather eat a red apple ? 
 They're okay , I guess . 
 That ’ s a big order , Jane . I am really swamped . 
 Right . Okay , let me see what I can do . How about 1:30 right after my lunch meeting ? It won ’ t take more than a half hour , will it ? 
 Oh , hi . Thanks for getting back to me quickly . 
 I was calling about your son . 
 Your son was acting up in class . 
 He was talking and causing a disturbance during class . 
 If you could just talk to him , I would greatly appreciate it . 
 Don't worry about it , but thank you very much . 
 I wish I could , but I can't . 
 Well , I am up to my neck in work . I've got to finish this report . Sarah needs it by noon . I don't want to be scolded if I can ’ t finish my work by the deadline . 
 We'd like a half-day package . 
 How many can we choose ? 
 We'll do the seaweed wrap , the jet bath , and the foot massage . 
 Hello , this is the International Youth Hotel . How can I help you ? 
 ok . There're vacancies . Since the peak season is coming , it's advisable to book soon . Would you like to make a reservation now ? 
 yes , we accept all major credit cards . 
 there's free Internet access in the lobby . 
 Unfortunately not . 
 yes , breakfast is included and parking is available . 
 you're welcome . And we have 24 hour reception . Please don't hesitate to call anytime if you have any further questions . 
 No , is there a single room left ? 
 For a week or so . Do you give discount for a week or more ? 
 All right . I will take a room for a week . Here is my passport . 
 More than one . I think the count is now three , if I remember correctly . 
 I don't know . I know there are advantages to joining , but I'm not much into group stuff . 
 I think I'm going to decline . I just prefer to do my own thing . 
 My dad was , but not my mom . 
 Yes , of course . This is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines . 
 Thank you for the invitation . 
 Yes , please . Thank you for everything . 
 I think salary is closely related to the responsibilities of the job . Shall we discuss my responsibilities with your company first ? 
 I know it is a crucial position , but I can do it well . So I'm asking for 200,000 Yuan a year as a starting salary . 
 Every honored guests , welcome to Hang Thou . Now we are visiting Tiger-running Spring . 
 Its name originates from a legend that two tigers run here and made a hole , and then a spring gushed out from it . 
 The Longing Tea and the Tiger-running Spring water are always considered as the “ Two Wonders in West Lake . ” 
 That's right . All my guests , attention please . We will have half an hour to visit the spring and take photos . And next spot will be the Moon Reflected in Three Pools . 
 How are your wedding plans going ? 
 When will your wedding take place ? 
 It will be a large church one . Is your wedding dress ready ? 
 You will be very beautiful on your wedding day . 
 Which hotel will the reception be held at ? 
 It's excellent . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . 
 I think you made the right decision . 
 Yes , please . Have you any vacancies for tonight ? 
 No , I don't think so . 
 Hello , Mary . How are you ? 
 Fine . Thank you . 
 That's out of the question . 
 I don't think so . Michael . 
 Pleased to meet you , too , Shirley . So , what do you do ? 
 I live here . I was invited by George-he's the tall guy over there . He looks a bit drunk , actually ... 
 The beauty under the tree ? 
 She is a young man ! 
 I've got a headache . 
 No , thank you . I'll take an aspirin and see how it goes . 
 Yes . What can I do for you ? 
 We've got a bad line . Can you repeat that please ? 
 Sorry , the connection is terrible . I'll call you back because I can't hear anything . 
 What is it , dear ? 
 You mean stuff like tampons and sanitary napkins ? 
 Follow me . All the things you need as a woman are in aisles 10 and 11 . This section is usually near the medicine section in any supermarket . 
 Listen to this . Mary got married . 
 Yes . Yesterday . 
 She married Jerrod . 
 She ’ s going to live in Paris . 
 What do you think I should do , doctor ? 
 Is it useful for me ? 
 OK . Thanks a lot . 
 May I help you ? Miss ! 
 What color set do you prefer ? 
 We have a beautiful selection of eye shadows this fall . Look at the colors . Aren't they beautiful ? 
 If you insist , I can show you the brown sets . I'll have to warn you that they're very ordinary , though . 
 Why don't you wear purple eye shadow for a change ? We also have lipstick to go with it . 
 Sure . Are you wearing any make-up ? 
 Have a seat , please . Now , here is the mirror . How do you like it ? 
 Try the lipstick as well . See , how fresh and charming you look . 
 Hey , Benjamin , have you finished your report on the project ? 
 What ? Man , you don't know how to write a project report ? That's sounds a little bit ridiculous . 
 Oh , sorry , I've totally forgotten that you are a workaholic . 
 First is your final conclusion on your work of this year , and then comes your plan for the next year . 
 Let me see , no , you have to include more details about your final conclusion , for example , your experiences in dealing with some emergent events . 
 And only that doesn't make a perfect one , you also have to pay attention to the format of the report . 
 I'm sorry . There isn't . Because different people have to write different kinds of reports . 
 OK , no problem . But you have to learn it and then do it yourself next time . 
 The balcony is still available . 
 No , I'm afraid that's it . 
 It's freezing . 
 Let me see . I am sorry we just have sold it out . 
 I think so.Could I have you name , telephone number ? If we get one , I will call you . 
 Can I help you ? 
 The Times is a must . 
 Excuse me , I'm looking for a good novel . Can you recommend anything ? 
 I'm not really sure . I don't like romance novels , but any other genre is okay , as long as the book's good . 
 Sorry , I forgot to mention that I don't like horror much , either . 
 Hmm ... I sometimes like mysteries , but I don't think I'm in the mood for one right now . 
 I love science fiction and fantasy , but I've been reading a lot of both lately , so I'd prefer to get something else . 
 That sounds interesting . Okay , I'll get this one . Thanks for all your help . 
 What's your favorite sport ?

 Very affordable sir . You can take it out of this lot today with 0 % down payment and no interest for the first year ! You can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back . 
 Did you enjoy the movie ? 
 Sorry to hear that . I think it's even better than On the Golden pond . 
 Welcome to McDonald's . Can I take your order ? 
 Would you like something to drink ? 
 Will that be it ? 
 Then I'll take them . How much ? 
 Here is $ 150.Keep the change . 
 You too.Bye .

 The best island of Korea-Jizhou island . 
 Attractive scenery , pleasant climate , these make it charming . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Yes , you are right . 
 Goodbye . 
 What would you like ? 
 I'm sorry . We're currently out of filet mignon . May I suggest the porterhouse instead ? 
 And may I suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ? 
 Okay , no strawberries . Room service will be charged to your amenities account . Is that all right ? 
 It will be up shortly . Enjoy your food , sir . 
 It's nice to be here . 
 Just a club soda for me , please . 
 What kind do you want ? 
 How many pounds would you like me to get you ? 
 Exactly what type of ground beef do you want ? 
 I'll get that for you right now . 
 Don't mention it , I'll just wrap this up for you . 
 David , recently I established a travelling forum , and now I want to make a plan to hold the first activity . Where can we go for this time ? 
 a dozen . 
 It's surely worth going to . There are ten famous spots there . 
 Inform my members to prepare for the travelling . And then we can discuss about the travelling costs . 
 Not really . What ’ s up ? 
 I ’ m kind of useless in that area , but I ’ ll take a look at it . 
 I need to talk to you about something . 
 I have some questions about my lease . 
 Exactly how long is my lease for ? 
 What will happen if I move out before then ? 
 I don ’ t understand . 
 Okay , I think that I understand . 
 Did you have a good weekend ? 
 Not bad . What did you do ? 
 I wasn't feeling too well , so I stayed at home . 
 Oh , flowers ! What for , my dear ? 
 Oh , thank you.You are so sweet ! 
 OK . By the way , I'd like to tell you that the check-out time is 12 
 Have you used any hotel services this morning or had breakfast at the hotel dining room , Mr . Green ? 
 How about the charge for the days you shared the room with your friend ? 
 The total for the eight days is five hundred sixty yuan . 
 You must like to dance , right . 
 Yes , I like the old style dance , such as waltz 、 rumba and so on . They are quite graceful . 
 Thank you for saying . I think you are light on your toes too . Oh , the music starts again , would you like to have another dance , miss ? 
 Neither do I . I don't like any kind of modern dances all . 
 Yes , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 Sure . I strongly advise you to buy a bottle of perfume and a lighter . 
 May I have a look at your passport , please ? 
 I'd rather say it's confusing . what are those " strict nutrition philosophies " about ? 
 Probably , Iris . That must be the job of nutritionists . 
 Oh , believe it or not , I came across an article the other day , saying that pizza is a healthy food . 
 Yes , I felt exactly the same way as you did just now . Scientists must be crazy in saying so . 
 Absolutely . I myself sometimes believe that healthy eating is just about feeling great . As long as I have enough energy , it's fine . 
 I want to have the overcoat made to measure . 
 No , I don't know which one to choose . I think maybe you can help me . 
 I will take your advice . 
 Sure . How about this one ? 
 Yes . We have both the paperback and the hardcover . 
 The hardcover is more expensive . 
 Can we go to the beach on foot ? 
 Is the bus station close by ? 
 Put all baggage on the conveyor belt.Walk through the detector gate one at a time , please .

 Thanks for helping me up . 
 I'm the hazardous one here . I made three people fall over ! 
 I'm so humiliated ! What's that man saying ? Everyone's laughing ! 
 Hello , Sir . Are you still there ? 
 Did you check with reception at your hotel ? 
 OK , that's fine , Sir . We just need to ask you some questions for security purposes . 
 Could I have your name , please ? And do you know your card number ? 
 That should be fine , Mr Kowalski . And your PIN number ? 
 That's completely natural . Most of our customers do the same thing . Could you just hold for a moment please ? Thank you . 
 I saw a lot of teenagers when Alan and I were there yesterday . 
 Speaking of that trip , Alan bought a shirt at a department store , but the sleeves are too long . Do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ? 
 Isn ’ t that complicated ? 
 We ? Do you want to go with me ? 
 What do you do there ... hang around , like the kids ? 
 I think you should buy a bottle of moisturizer . 
 Yes . It will keep your face from getting dry and make your skin soft . 
 Yes , I would . 
 It's sapphire . We have only one brooch of this type . Will you try it on ? 
 Only 700 yuan . 
 How about this one ? This is 500 yuan and the same kind of material as that one . 
 Oh , yes . Any kind of goods are dependable as our shop is well-known throughout the city . 
 Yes , I would like the chicken cheese enchiladas with a side of guacamole . 
 Sure I ' ll have the burrito . Do you have nachos ? 
 Sounds good . 
 Sure , I ' ll have a Corona . 
 What do you mean , Mom ? For breaking your best china ? 
 Well , it's more like she kept me busy ... 
 Am I back in your good books ?

 What are your strengths and weaknesses ? 
 What qualities would you expect of persons working as a team ? 
 How do you spend your leisure time ? 
 So , what kind of sport do you like most ? 
 Hello . This is Doctor Bell ’ s Office . Can I help you ? 
 I ’ m sorry to hear that . Cancelling the appointment is no problem . Thank you for your call . 
 Hi , Sarah . The results of questionnaire have come out . We need to discuss it together then write a research report . 
 30 % of the people are attracted by the style . Buyers always pay great attention to packing . In my opinion , these goods didn't sell well merely because of the poor packing . 
 Almost 30 % of the consumers can ’ t accept the price . Maybe we should lower our price a little . 
 Absolutely . 
 Good afternoon . I need some stamps and envelopes . 
 A dozen 30 - cent stamps and 6 envelopes . 
 That ’ s all . How much altogether ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Please take me to Plaza Hotel . 
 As soon as possible , because I've got an important meeting to attend . 
 Hey John , nice skates . Are they new ? 
 What position do you play ? 
 Yeah , you ’ re a pretty big guy . I play goalie , myself . 
 The Rockets . 
 All right , see you later . 
 Thank you very much . I will devote all my efforts to my work . 
 I'm thinking about that idea we talked about . 
 I'm not sure . 
 The economy has been stagnant for a while now . We've been in a recessive state for several months already . What worries me the most is the trade deficit . I think the government should do more to encourage exports . 
 It's true that we should do something about unemployment , but what about inflation ? If unemployment falls , there's pressure to increase pay . That would result in inflation , which would result in a much less dynamic economy . 
 He is a worker . 
 She is a nurse . 
 Really ? OK , I will try my best to be relaxed . 
 Hi George ! It's good to see you ! 
 I just opened up my own business not long ago . 
 I'm a professional party planner here in the city . I do catering and all that . 
 Well , I don't know about the profit part yet . But I am really having fun ! 
 I would like for you to come in and talk about a few more tests that I would like to run . 
 I just want to talk to you about the tests that I want to run . 
 I don ’ t know anything for certain . We always do a double check if there is a question . 
 You can come in this afternoon . If you are feeling too stressed , feel free to bring a friend along . 
 Don ’ t worry about a thing ; we are just taking a second look and talking . 
 Really . What do they mean ? 
 What do you think then ? 
 I ’ d like to take this opportunity to thank you for everything you did for me . 
 I wouldn ’ t be able to make it without your help . 
 My old man always harps on me . 
 But I can't bear it , John . 
 Yeah , but he really puts blame on me . 
 No , I'm scared of cats . 
 I feel they're dirty . 
 No . What did it say ? 
 A garage sale ... that's where people check out cars , right ? 
 I'm pulling your leg , Paul . I'm a shopping queen , remember ? So of course I know what a garage sale is all about ! 
 I think you will get a big bonus , because you always have high sales . 
 Yes , I am expecting to get the bonus . I hope we will both get the salary and bonus . 
 Can you work over tonight ? 
 Okay , I'll ask Bob to cover it . 
 Merry Christmas ! Mary ! 
 Will you come to join us at dinner this evening ? My family will be happy to see you . And father misses you very much . 
 Do you like ice skating ? 
 Then you've got to try it . Let's go to the skating rink on Thursday . 
 Friday then . How about it ? 
 It's settled then . 
 did you get the position you wanted ? 
 I'm glad to hear that . Congratulations ! 
 sure , but you really did great and outperformed the others . You deserved it ! 
 you always have unique ideas and you're such a team leader . 
 that's very nice of you to say so . I'll try my best . When will you start at the new position ? 
 so by then , you'll be in charge of the whole department . 
 Excuse me , what's the price of a single room ? 
 Are meals included ? 
 Fine , I want to book one for overnight . 
 Honey , I am sorry that I am too busy most of the time . 
 What did you do last weekend ? 
 Did you play football with other children ? 
 Cool , we can take the football , shuttlecock and badminton racket to the park . 
 After that , we will have a picnic . 
 Okay , it sounds good . 
 No.Why ? 
 No way ! 
 Jack ! You've really done it this time . 
 I told you to get this consignment out last week.We can't very well run a light bulb conference without any light bulbs , can we ? What am I going to do with you ? 
 Well , I guess I could give you one more chance , but this is the last time.In themeantime , I hear that Tom who normally does night shift is taking three weeks ' vacation , Can you think of anyone who would be willing to work nights while he is gone ? 
 Bingo ! 
 Not anymore . Now I work nine hours a day , and I get a good sleep almost every night . No more burning the candle at both ends . 
 Yes , of course . What is it ? 
 Okay , what should I do ? 
 Yes , of course . I have to go there every Tuesday . 
 What's the presentation about ? 
 Will you need anything special for the presentation ? 
 I suppose you need the whiteboard set up . 
 Yes , my name is Peter . I have made a reservation for a single room from June 18th to June 21st . I'd like to make some changes . The reservation should only be to June 20th . 
 Yes . 
 That's exactly what I want . How much does it charge ? 
 It sounds good . I'll take that . 
 Don't take too much off . I'm trying to grow my hair longer . 
 That sounds perfect . Do you think I can get some highlights today , too ? I've always wanted red . 
 All right . I'll just have the cut and perm today . 
 OK . 
 Do you have a car or motorbike ? 
 In that case , you can park either in a student lot or on the street . Are you aware of the marked handicapped spots ? 
 The handicapped logo with blue means that you are not to park there unless you have a handicapped permit . Will you mostly be parking during the day or the night ? 
 Make sure you pay special attention to the street signs with time limits . Have you noticed those signs ? 
 Pay attention to what the signs tell you in terms of time limits and what days you can park there . Do you know what the curb colors mean ? 
 Just remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means loading and unloading only . I think you'll be good to go ! 
 A few months . 
 Great ! I'm having a great time . 
 We were in the same science class last term . 
 I did . 
 It was no big deal . 
 They're glad that I finally got a boyfriend . 
 Good morning madam . What can I get you ? 
 Certainly madam , what kind of coffee would you like ? 
 Well we have espresso , cappuccino , latte , skinny latte or Americano . 
 Here you are . You ’ ll find the sugar just over there . 
 Oh , it has nothing to do with me . 
 I came here only a month ago . 
 No . I am a transit passenger going to Sweden . 
 Only one night . 
 No , I don't . 
 They are my personal effects . 
 And what did the program say ? 
 I think that many physicians 8 now agree with that idea . 
 And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise . My father is over 60 years old , and he lifts weights every day . 
 For What ? 
 Well , that sounds like it would be OK . Just be careful . 
 Excellent . As soon as we landed , we boarded a bus to Disneyland . I love Mickey Mouse . Janet and I spent the entire first day going on all of the rides . 
 I felt fine . I must have been too excited to notice . 
 How do you get along with your co-workers ? 
 Do you think management should fire someone just because they gossip ? 
 So how do you develop good relationships in the office ? 
 I think you're right , but it does seem that there are always a few co — workers that are harder to work with than others . 
 Yes , I worked in a fashion shop as a part time salesgirl . 
 I'm working as an export sales staff member for a trade company . 
 I work at Yangshi Trade Company Ltd . I have been working there since 1997 . 
 Well first put your money in . 
 Then just press this button . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Really ? I didn't expect that . 
 I should have booked the tickets in advance . 
 Joanne , let ’ s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is , okay ? Let ’ s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly , so we can go our separate ways , alright ? 
 What was that ? 
 Let ’ s not go there , Joanne ! Ok , so let ’ s start with the record collection , I ’ ll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back . 
 I believe that was a wedding present to both of us , Joanne . And you hardly ever use it ! 
 Whatever ! Alright , I ’ ll concede the silly gramophone , if you ’ ll agree that I get the silver tea set . 
 Which ones ? Let me have a look.Wow , look at that ! That brings back memories ... That ? 
 ... and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet . I had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley , smiling and laughing in the rain ... 
 Oh , Joanne , are we making a big mistake ? I know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can ’ t reconcile and try again ? I still love you . 
 The motorcycle ? But that ’ s mine ! 
 Oh , sorry . I didn ’ t know . 
 No , I ’ m afraid not . 
 Sorry . 
 I wanted to see the White House . 
 Oh , no . 
 Oh , well thank you very much . 
 The music is on.May I have the pleasure to dance with you ? 
 Certainly . 
 Just a minute . I need to make a list of thinks that we need . 
 I don ’ t have onions on my list . I ’ ll add them . We should get some tea . Is green tea ok or should we get the same tea that we usually get ? 
 Yes , it is . Here ’ s my list . Is there anything that I ’ Ve forgotten ? 
 What kind of cheese do you want . 
 We don ’ t have enough cash , so I ’ ll take my credit card and we can pay with that . Where are the car keys ? 
 Good afternoon , Mr Meng ! It's nice to see you today . It's been a while , hasn't it ? 
 I envy you , Mr Meng ! What can I do for you today ? 
 Right . Do you have the code for that one ? 
 Here it is . Have you got the advice slip with you ? You have sufficient funds in the account , so we can go ahead . 
 I need to open a second account . 
 I need another savings account . 
 I sure do . 
 That ’ s fine . 
 Transfer $ 100 . 
 That ’ s fine . Thank you . 
 I know them . They are the two brothers living next door . 
 It's said that the father's will caused the dissension among the two brothers . 
 No , everyone keeps in mind that ' Don't intrude in a family dispute ' . 
 Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer , and a prompt will tell you the payment options . 
 That's too bad . But there are several alternatives , if you want to hear them . 
 We run a fully equipped computer lab on the first floor . 
 The service is free to hotel patrons . However , printing costs ten cents per page . 
 Alternatively , we do offer wireless in our lobby . You can bring your laptop down here . 
 You would have to use the computer lab . I'm sorry for the inconvenience . 
 Sure , Brian . What ’ s on your mind ? 
 No , not at all , Brian . This year , we ’ Ve all had to cut back . I ’ m hoping next year ’ s going to better . I hope you can understand . 
 I want to buy some records . 
 Are there the records of Michael Jackson ? 
 Oh . it's too late . Maybe I should go to other video stores to have a look . 
 Well , it depends on what you have . 
 It takes only one day and you could experience almost all the famous spots in the city , I don't think you would like to miss it . 
 50 dollars per person . 
 Of course . Please take it easy . 
 Why not ? 
 I know it is not the cheapest on the market . But if you take the quality factor into consideration , you will find your company will benefit in the long term . This device is built in with the most advanced technology . Every aspect has reached the international standard . It is a worthwhile investment . 
 Well , the best I can do is to lower the price by 5 percent if you are willing to pay 90 % cash of front and 10 % on delivery . That is our best offer . 
 Sure , no problem . 
 Yeah , Cal Ripen just hit a home run . 
 Well it was 3 to 4 , but Ripen ’ s home run made it 5 to 4 since another player was on first base . 
 Right . 
 Yeah , there isn ’ t a bad seat in the place . 
 It was a great idea to spend a day watching a game . 
 Hello , could I speak to Mr . Wang , the PR Director ? 
 I am calling to inquire about the position of PR manager . What requirements does the job need ? 
 What are the branches of Operations ? 
 It seems that it is a key department for providing materials and transportation . 
 The dress looks beautiful . Can I touch it ? 
 I see . What about the dress over there ? I would like to try it on . 
 Did you check before you left the shop ? 
 Really ? Let me have a look at it . Mm . OK . Let me change it for another one .

 Good-bye . 
 The first thing that you should check out is callous , which is a great Internet-based placement service that you can use .

 We can help you find local information about available jobs and workshops .

 Many times there are special services available to certain groups like Women at Work or job help for non-English speakers . 
 Well , I am not sure . Lets me check my agenda 
 I am free on Tuesday afternoon from 2 PM to 4 PM , is it convenient for you ? 
 Yes , there is . See you then . 
 Good morning . I want to post this letter . Can you tell me what the postage is ?

 Thank you . Goodbye . 
 Hi , is this Sue ? 
 Sue , this is Tom Lin from Allied Trust and I'm calling to offer you a position with our firm . 
 Senior account rep . 
 It starts at $ 30,000 . S 
 Can you give me more details on what is included in the package ? 
 What about the hotel accommodations ? 
 Great . What types of things will we do at Lushun Falls ? 
 Way to go ! It seems beautiful and very delicious . 
 Miss Fallen , can you tell me why you want to get a visa to the States ? 
 And do you have the Letter of Acceptance from the University with you ? 
 Thank you very much . And do you have any proof of the financial support for the three years ? 
 Could I see that , please ? 
 Thanks very much . Well , I'll be able to give you a visa for one year , a student visa , that is . 
 Yes , it is a three-year , but you can renew the visa each year in the States . It is our usual procedure . 
 Roger ? Would it be possible to meet with you to discuss my department ’ s budget ? 
 All right . That ’ ll be fine . Can you put together a rough idea of the kind of money I ’ ll have available for the next year ? 
 Are you going to the beach this saturday afternoon ? 
 The radio says it'll be fine . 
 hello , Jason , there is going to be a screening of Final Destination 3 at our campus cinema tomorrow . I plan to go to see it . 
 yeah , I love horror movies . Would you like to go with me tomorrow ? 
 that's funny , I didn't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside . 
 alright , all joking aside , what kinds of moves do you like ? 
 that is to say , you like all genres except for horror movies . 
 not quite . I also greatly enjoy romance and comedy . 
 really ? I haven't heard of it . 
 Ok . I can't wait to see it . Let's go ! 
 I would like to buy two exquisite watches for me and my girlfriend . 
 This pair is Rolex , right ? 
 What function does this watch have ? 
 Sounds good . 
 How long is the guarantee ? 
 How much does the pair cost ? 
 It is a bit expensive . But it is worth buying one's favorite . I will take them . 
 Really ? How much is it ? Oh , it's 42 yuan ! How expensive ! 
 How come ? I have never seen such a popular book before . 
 You are right . Let's buy the cheaper one . 
 So , please ! 
 I bought you a new one last year . Isn't it handsome ? 
 Frankly , he is more well-behaved than you . 
 Why hasn't the bus come yet ? Every morning we have to wait for so long . 
 Really ? I am looking forward to that . What about the traffic ? 
 It is quite important to be a good listener in the interview . 
 It can show your good attainment as well . 
 First of all , you should keep proper posture and make eye contact with the speaker with a smile . 
 And your statement should be clear and brief to the point . 
 Sure , in order not to leave a bad impression on the interviewer . 
 Don't be absent-minded even when you are not interested in the talk . 
 The National Day is coming . What are you going to do during the holiday ? 
 Why don't you go sightseeing ? 
 I intend to stay at home for the whole seven days and have a good rest . 
 Yeah , some places are very short of water . 
 You see , This time I traveled to the West . When I looked out of the windows of the rain , all the lands that I could see are as dry as a bone . 
 Can I take your order ? 
 What kind of drink do you want with those meals ? 
 You can super-size your meals for only three dollars extra . 
 How about anything for dessert , like an apple pie or ice cream ? 
 Is there a bookstore near here ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 I can't come until next week . 
 Thanks , I'll see you around Wednesday then . 
 Yes . I'd like a hamburger and a large order of french fries , please . 
 Yes . I'll have a mixed green salad . 
 Italian , please . 
 Yes , I'd like a large soda , please . 
 What ? 
 Oh , how awful . What a terrible thing to do . 
 Well , maybe they've got a point . I mean , I suspect that they think the same about us . 
 I guess not . My view is that we should give in to their demands , so that innocent people can stop getting killed . 
 Well , that's probably true , but I don't think we should be dogmatic about it . A colleague of mine was kidnapped once , so perhaps I have a different view of things . 
 Well , it was in the Balkans during the war . He was only held for three days , and then they simply released him . It was a case of mistaken identity , and they just let him go when they found out he was no use to them . It was lucky they didn't kill him . 
 Hi , I want to check out . 
 Can I pay by a credit card ? 
 OK . Here is the money . 
 Would you wrap it for me ? 
 Uncle Ben , how did the Forbidden City get this name ? 
 His residence ? You mean the whole palace ? 
 Oh , unbelievable . This was too luxurious . 
 OK , then . I love these unique structured towers with the delicate carvings on them . It's really artistic . 
 I agree . It's definitely a product of wisdom . Well , why were those small animal sculptures placed on the tops of the buildings ? 
 Why are there so many yellow things ? Is yellow the lucky color in China ? 
 Just like the pattern dragon , right ? 
 Oh , it's really fabulous . I wanna take a picture here . 
 My wife is really a chatter box . It ’ s so boring . 
 What is it ? 
 What was the party like last night , Jean ? 
 Well , I couldn't get away from work early . And when . I got home I had a headache , so I had to go straight to bed . But I was over-tired , because I wasn't able to get to sleep for hours . 
 I don't like them . I used to take them when I had to work overtime , you know . 
 Three every night . 
 Because I was under a terrible strain . The doctor saidthey weren't very strong . Anyway , I used to feel awful the next morning . 
 The doctor said I had to be careful . 
 So I stopped drinking coffee late at night instead . 
 I ’ m afraid I ’ m busy tonight . I ’ m having dinner with friends . 
 What about tomorrow ? Are you doing anything tomorrow ? 
 Shall we go out tomorrow then ? 
 Lisa , I am told you did very well in your exam . 
 Congratulations on your success . 
 Hello , Wendy speaking . 
 Hi , Gerry . How can I help you ? 
 Yes . But she is very busy right now . Can you call her later ? 
 Thanks , bye bye . 
 What places does the tour include ? 
 So many places I have been looking forward to . We will take part in the group . 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 Can I have your key and room number , PLS ? 
 Here is your bill , sir . Could you PLS check it ? 
 Here you are , sir . You are all set . I hope you enjoyed your stay and that next time you are in town , you will stay with us again . 
 The bell captain will put it in storage room . When you are ready to leave , you can claim your luggage from him . 
 Shouldn't you already be in bed ? 
 You need to get some rest , as you have to get up early in the morning . 
 Just close your eyes , and try not to think . 
 It doesn't matter , you need to get some sleep . 
 Then you're not going to go to sleep . 
 I want you in bed , right now , so sweet dreams . 
 Thank you for seeing me . Did you look over my letter and resume ? 
 Yes , I think it is possible more important than the salary . 
 Good , about the essential living conditions ? 
 I see . I'm a female . Are there any special benefits for me ? 
 I think it is very necessary for us . I wonder whether I am on holiday with payment every year . 
 Right . How about the unemployment compensation and the retirement pension ? 
 Yes , I see . 
 Could you fill me in on the details for buying foreign currency ? 
 Kula Lumpur , in Malaysia . 
 That sounds fine . I'll bring in my passport and everything tomorrow . Thanks . 
 I don't have the day off . Our labor union is staging a nationwide strike today , all of the workers in our department are supporting the labor union by participating and not going in to work this week . 
 It happens quite often , actually.Whenever there arises a dispute between the union and the executive group , the first thing they do is to call a strike . Usually it only lasts a day or two before both sides can come to an agreement and we start work again . Anyhow , it's a nice , unanticipated holiday ... 
 oh , Iris ! what was it about this time ? 
 I believe she was right . You must know that fried foods contain a lot of fat . 
 I think you'd better take her advice since health is the greatest wealth . 
 well , that's true . 
 she also believes in healthy diet . And she requires us to have regular meals . 
 Oh , i am grateful for my mother on this point . her idea of healthy eating helps me a lot keeping fit . 
 not really . I may have some occasionally for a chance . But I don't indulge myself too much . 
 it's pretty simple , Iris . Just keep it in mind that you're what you eat . 
 No , not yet . I ’ m still looking . I ’ Ve been doing some work through a temp-agency though . 
 I ’ m temping at a pharmaceutical company . 
 Mostly office work - filing and so on . 
 Till the end of the month . 
 Let me check ... what's your voucher number ? 
 Wait a minute , please---Mr . Wong , I'm terribly sorry . Our delivery truck had an accident today . I'm afraid your sofa won't be delivered until tomorrow . 
 Yes . When do you start severing dinner ? 
 Well , that's fine . So I don't think it necessary for us to make a reservation . We will be there at 9:30 . 
 They got a divorce at last . 
 You said it . Love but on the sand will soon be on the rocks . 
 Do you feel all right ? You look Pale . 
 Have you taken your temperature ? 
 How long have you been feeling this way ? 
 Oh , probably you've been working too hard . 
 I'm searching for an old music box . 
 If you had a box made in the ' 20s , that would be nice . 
 Would any of them have dancing figures ? 
 Oh , they're both so beautiful . Let me have this one , I think . 
 One last question 
 I guess I was asking for too much . 
 What was the biggest turing point in your life ? 
 Really ? Why is that ? 
 What would you say was the lowest point in your life ? 
 What went wrong ? 
 How long were you married ? 
 Have you remarried since then ? 
 Do you think you'll ever get a divorce again ? 
 How long have you been married ? 
 Do you think you'll still love him when he is old and gray ? 
 I ’ m sure you will . 
 Give me just a few seconds , sir , and I'll hand you your receipt . Here you are . 
 I hope you enjoyed your stay , sir . 
 I apologize again for the cockroaches , sir . I hope you have a nice trip home . 
 yes , doesn't everyone ? 
 it's hard to say . While dogs are more affectionate , cats are much easier to take care of . 
 when I was little , we had a few domestic dogs at home . 
 definitely . rich or poor , dogs always love their masters . 
 i had one a few months ago , but she ended up running away . 
 she left through a window that was open one night and never returned . 
 i was pretty sad . i still hope that she'll return some day ! 
 I think I will . It's difficult to feel longly when you have a pet around . 
 i do , too . 
 This is Mr Meng speaking , Michelle . 
 That was quick ! I wasn't expecting it until later this week . 
 Shall I come in and collect it ? 
 Mmmm ... if I come in and collect it this afternoon , is there any way I could use it today ? Petty cash is getting low , so I need to draw some money . 
 I see . Yes , that's fine . I'll be there at around 2:30 pm . See you later , and thanks . 
 OK , sir . How many are coming ? 
 We require a jacket and tie . 
 Can I be of any service to you ? 
 There are over a thousands kinds of articles in our shop.For example , there is tricolored pottery originating in the Tang Dynasty , embroidery , batik , jade carving , just to name a few.Do you have anything in mind ? 
 I would suggest you buy paper-cuts , embroidery and batik.They are very easy to carry . 
 Dan , Dan , dude . You have to come over to my house right now ! 
 Just get over here ! Come in ! Quickly ! 
 What do you mean ? 
 Security , Dan , security ! You can never be too safe you know ! A lot of sickos out there . Just the other day they caught that peeping tom red handed ! Had a high power telescope and binoculars by his window . 
 Paranoid ? I ’ m not paranoid ! I ’ m cautious ! You see Dan , we have to be on guard at all time ! People just invade your privacy as if they knew you ! Telemarketers , solicitors , even your bank ! They have way too much information ! I like to keep everything on a need to know basis . 
 You are being watched ! Be careful Dan ! Be careful ! 
 Yes , sir . 
 Of course . You don't have to come here and we will drop you off at your hotel . 
 Nice to meet you , sir . I come from New Times Clothes Company . We learnt that your exhibits on the Trade Fair in Shanghai this month were marvelous . Would you please quote the price ? 
 Your summer clothes for white-collar and men's jackets . 
 That is to say , 10000 sets for the one of white-collar and 5000 for men's jackets . 
 Do you quote CIF or FOB ? 
 What are your terms of payment ? 
 Another question . Could you tell me the earliest possible time of shipment ? 
 Well , I got all the point . All the decision will be made since I get the approval from my supervisor . 
 Mary , would you like to get something to eat with me ? 
 At 10 o'clock . 
 No , at night . 
 OK , how about 1:30 PM ? 
 How about 5:00 PM ? 
 OK , see you then . 
 Excuse me , I need to get to Cambridge today . 
 I am not sure , which one is better ? 
 And how long does the train take ? 
 Where do I catch the train ? 
 How do I get to King's Cross ? 
 Can you show me on the map ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 What a beautiful day ! 
 I heard that it's supposed to get up to 90 degrees Fahrenheit today . 
 Well , you could never tell about the weather here in New York . 
 Did you vote yesterday ? 
 What candidate did you vote for ? 
 I ’ m shocked he actually won . 
 How ’ d you know ? 
 What about him being black ? 
 I think you have a point . 
 Sorry , I can ’ t hear you . Could you please speak up a little ? 
 Pardon ? The line is bad . Don ’ t hang up please . I ’ ll have the call transferred to another line . 
 Not really . 
 I'll do it later , Dad . I must prepare the concert on Saturday . 
 We hope so . 
 Oh dad . You don't understand at all . 
 I don't need it to play the guitar . 
 I'm sorry . 
 I didn't sleep a wink last night . 
 Well , I am under a lot of pressure . My boss is very pushy . He assigned me three projects . Now the deadlines are near , and I still have not finished all of my projects . 
 Well , I guess no one can help me but myself . For the moment , I just need someone to talk to , so that I can relieve my stress . 
 You got me on that one . 
 It's Ellie and her friends . 
 She's my little niece.It ' s her birthday.They ' re singing " Happy Birthday " . 
 She's ten . 
 Oh , yes.Ellie was playing games all day yesterday.By the way , Alice , when's your birthday ? 
 Today ? 
 Well , imagine that ! How old are you ? 
 Very much.What time ? 
 I'll be at your house at about five thirty.Happy birthday . 
 Nothing . It's just one of those days . Everyone at the office is sick and I'm getting blamed for work not being done . 
 I'm sick of doing other people's job and getting blamed for not doing it right . 
 I wish he could understand . You know what , if this goes on , I think I will get stick like everybody else . 
 Oh , come on.You ' Ve just started . 
 How do you get road news ? 
 So you have all the news on broadcast ? 
 I would suggest roast beef , sir . 
 We have clear and cream soup at your choice.Which one do you prefer ? 
 I need to buy a bus pass . 
 What are the different kinds ? 
 Could I get a student pass , please ? 
 Sure , here it is . 
 How much for the pass ? 
 Okay , I'll take it . 
 You are welcome . 
 Yes , of course . We have day tour and night tour . Which one are you more interested in ? 
 You are smart . The city is really charming at night . 
 All right . In my first teaching position I received the Excellent Teaching award the past two years in succession . 
 Yes . I was chosen as one of ' the Top Ten Prominent Youths of Beijing ' in 2002 . 
 Yes . I have got two articles in English in The International Youth Writer's Collection . 
 Well , I think this Star Wars episode is an excellent piece of work , but not as good as the previous ones . 
 Why do you think so ? 
 You are right . The special effects were amazing . And I like the fact that they created so many fantastic settings and otherworldly costumes , weapons and creatures . 
 Yeah ! It reminds me of the previous Star Wars scenes . 
 I thought the overall plot of the movie was very interesting , but I don't think the character development was that strong . 
 No , the casting is great and the actors were excellent . They just didn ’ t have a lot of funny or meaningful dialogues . The writing was also a little weak . 
 I liked him too . He is so cute ! You know , even though I was slightly disappointed , I can't wait for the next episode . I wonder when they ’ re going to start making it and when it ’ s scheduled for release ? 
 I hope so , too . 
 Okay , let's go ! 
 There is a special form to apply for unemployment benefits . 
 You can go online to begin the application process . 
 You need to be able to say whom you worked for and when . 
 You should be able to provide a layoff notice or proof of severance . 
 You need to be interviewed over the phone . They will set up a time for you . 
 I'll have to think about it . 
 Yes , go straight along Beijing Road and turn right . 
 No , it's just a couple of minutes . 
 You're welcome . 
 What a bone head ! Be careful next time . 
 I really missed you a lot . 
 I don't understand why you haven't come to visit me . 
 Tell me what you've been up to . 
 I've been pretty busy myself . 
 I've just been working a lot . 
 I'm glad I did too . 
 Not a problem . What time shall we call you ? 
 It'll be our pleasure . We'll call you at 7 and then at 7 fifteen . 
 No sooner said than done . Can I help you with anything else ? 
 Okay , sir . Have a pleasant evening . 
 I like word games . 
 I don't like it at all . 
 I'm not one for the games . 
 What about playing go ? 
 That man's really a bore to me . 
 The man with his hair cropped . 
 Oh , dear . What was in it ? 
 Well . Go to the police station and see if it ’ s there . 
 You're right.The air is so warm and everything looks so fresh and green . 
 Marvelous idea ? 
 Really ? How many do you have ? 
 That is a lot of friends . Do you have a best friend ? 
 How many best friends do you have ? 
 Hmm . I have only one best friend . 
 I have only a few friends . 
 That's very nice of you . 
 Does it really look OK ? 
 And I got it on sale . 
 Merry Christmas ! 
 I said Merry Christmas ! Don ’ t you know that Christmas is almost here ? 
 Huh ? Didn ’ t you know ? Aren ’ t you excited ? 
 Forgotten about it ? How could you ? 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry . I didn ’ t know . 
 I guess so . So what do you do around this time of year ? 
 Well , would you be horribly offended if I invited you to a Christmas party at my house ? 
 Mom , where are you going ? 
 Good . I wanna come with you . 
 We learnt about vegetables and meat at school . But I never see the real thing . 
 Er , is it cabbage ? 
 Yeah , I know , this is Popeye's favorite food . 
 Mom , come here . I know this , it is carrot , am I right ? 
 I ’ d like to ask whether it is correct to partake in the firm ’ s insurance plan ? 
 But people keep talking about the benefits from the plan . 
 As a matter of fact , I am . 
 No . I transferred here from a different school . 
 I transferred here from PCC . 
 I really like it here so far . 
 I like PCC better . 
 I graduated and I'am working towards my next degree . 
 Hello , George . 
 Yes , I have . 
 Paris in the Spring . 
 Paris is a beautiful city . I have never been there . Have you ever been there , Ken ? 
 Paris in the spring , eh ? 
 Just like dear old London ! 
 When would you like to fly ? 
 I will check , please hold on . Sorry to say that flight is all booked up . Can I book you for the 3rd of September ? 
 How many people are there in your party ? 
 What class will you fly ? First class ? Business class ? Or economy class ? 
 Round trip or one way trip ? 
 How will you pay , cash or charge ? 
 I am sorry , we do not accept checks . 
 Great . What name shall I put the reservation under ? 
 You are booked , Ms . Green . 
 It's a pleasure . 
 Fair to middling . A little hard to appreciate . 
 It is very hard , you know . 
 Good luck ! 
 Yes , we can handle that here . How can I help you ? 
 Did you work at all during the last pay period ? 
 Did you report it on your Continued Claim Form ? 
 Well , we deducted a portion of the income that you made from this week ’ s check . 
 That is cheating and , if you get caught , you will be fined and disqualified from collecting unemployment . 
 Don't worry . I'm almost finished . 
 All right . I'm finished . 
 What do you mean by that ? 
 What don't you like about it ? 
 I'm sorry that you don't like it . 
 I'm sure we can work something out . 
 A compact please . What's the daily rate for that car ? 
 Does the rate include the cost of gas ? 
 Hi , Fanny . 
 Are you feeling OK ? You sound a little tired this morning . 
 What happened ? 
 Oh , what a nightmare ! Then what happened ? 
 You have got a great mother . 
 That sounds good ! 
 Me too . But I tell myself that if they don ’ t accept me , another school will . 
 I tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward.It ' s more difficult for me to be around timid people , because I move quickly and I am decisive . 
 I admire and work best with people who are of good character and integrity . I also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment . 
 The only thing I really don't like is to get feedback in front of others . I want to hear good and bad feedback in private , so that I have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . I believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior . 
 I love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario.Then , I set a timetable that's realistic.What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because I've already visualized what could happen and how I'd react . 
 I had to complete an end of quarter report once while I was on the road for two consecutive weeks.The amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible , because I could't bring my office files with me.Luckily I had a great secretary and a logical filling system , so we located everything we needed . 
 I've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value.The last thing I do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which I take care of at the end of the day or week . 
 I changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings . 
 Yes , but you look fine . 
 Poor boy ! But don't worry . Here are two pills made in Germany . It's really effective . He will be just fine . 
 Take some with you next time , just in case . 
 You mean the boy who felt carsick just now ? 
 Oh , sorry , maybe I gave you the wrong medicine . 
 It's just sleeping pills made in America which is also very good . But don't worry . It has no undesirable side-effects . 
 What did the boss say ? 
 You are still student so I don't think you should have time for that . 
 Okay , then . What kind of newspaper he wants you to sell ? 
 Sounds interesting . Especially that we are Olympic Volunteers . 
 And a good way to get some pocket money . 
 I'll say yes . Wait a minute . I need an IC card . 
 Yes , but I don't want my Mom to tap my phone when I call Clive . 
 You need all your receipts for reimbursement . 
 Yes , here is the form for an expense report . Fill it out and give it to me . I ’ ll get it signed for you . 
 I schedule my appointments from two to four on Saturday ; what works best for you ? 
 Great , do you need directions to my office ? 
 Well , just make sure to go through the double doors , and I'll be on the right . 
 It's very easy to find . 
 I will enjoy seeing you ; have a good week ! 
 Is Ms April Wang available at the moment ? 
 I hope so . I'm in the process of applying for a credit card with you , and Ms Wang asked me to drop off these documents . 
 Do you need anything else from me ? 
 No problem . How much ? If I don't have enough on me , I'll pop over to the ATM and draw some . 
 I think I can manage that . Let's see ... yes , here we are . 
 I would if I were you . 
 We could make it lower for you . What's your counter-offer ? 
 If you order in large lots , we'll accept the price . 
 All right , as a token of friendship , we accept your counter-offer . 
 What kind of job do you intend to do ? 
 What are your plans if you were hired ? 
 Taxi ! 
 Please rush me to the railway station 
 Can you speed up a bit ? 
 But I have no time to lose . 
 Can you drop me off here ? 
 Can I help you , madam ? 
 Are you all our guests ? 
 Please fill in this form . 
 So you're leaving this evening , we ’ ll keep your bags until 6pm , here is you tag . 
 Excuse me , I'd like to have these pants I bought here yesterday altered . Here's my receipt . 
 They're a little bit too long , so I'd like about half an inch taken off them . 
 Thank you very much . 
 John ? It ’ s Susan Miller . 
 Do you know where that memo about office procedures is ? I want to give my secretary a copy . 
 Hi , dear , I've got your voice at last . 
 Are you OK today ? 
 So do I . You are a beautiful flower in my mind . 
 Hi , can I speak with the apartment manager , please ? 
 I'm calling about the apartment for rent on Main Street . 
 I would love to see it . 
 Yes , I will be able to make it then . 
 I used to live in that area . 
 That sounds good . Do I need to bring anything ? 
 Good afternoon , Johnson . 
 Not bad , thanks . 
 I have just arrived in Scotland and I'm staying at a Youth Hostel . 
 He says he's just arrived in Scotland . He says he's staying at a Youth Hostel . You know he's a member of the Y . H . A . 
 The Y . H . A . , mun . The Youth Hostel's Association . 
 I'll write a letter soon . I hope you are all well . 
 He says he'll write a letter soon . He hopes we are all well . Love , Jimmy . 
 He can't write very much on a card , mum . 
 Of course . Here is our thickening mascara . We also have mascara designed to lengthen the eyelashes . 
 We have a very wide selection of colors . And our eye shadow is specially designed to moisturize the skin . So it is very gentle on your eyelids . Would you like to sample some ? 
 I can help you with that . 
 Good afternoon Miss.Are there plane tickets to San Francisco on the day after tomorrow ? 
 Are there tickets for Saturday then ? 
 I'll need a coach open return . What's the fare ? 
 What time will the flight put me there ? 
 OK I'll take three . What's the flight number ? 
 Can I see your ticket please ? 
 Ok , Mr . Smith . Do you have any bags to check ? 
 And would you prefer a window seat or an aisle seat ? 
 Boarding time is ten 20am . 
 Gate 29C . Have a nice flight . 
 I'd love to ! But I have never learned martial arts , and there is only a month left before the New Year . 
 Sounds great ! Shall I learn the actions that Jet Li did in the movies ? 
 Whatever ! I'm glad to learn something of Chinese kung fu . Thanks for asking me . 
 Good ! 
 I'd like to have a sightseeing tour in South Africa . Do you provide a package tour ? 
 What interesting places shall we visit ? 
 How many days shall we spend on the trip ? 
 Sounds good . 
 Thank you , Mary . We have been looking forward to trying out this restaurant . 
 Sure , that sounds great . Where are your appetizers listed ? 
 The chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good . Is that pretty good ? 
 OK , I'll take one order of that . 
 Perfect ! Please add on an order of onion rings . 
 Yes , I am afraid there are not enough outlets . 
 Yes , but 4 of them are broken . Can you send someone here ? 
 How's your thesis going ? 
 I've finished the first draft , but the professor said it's poorly written . I have to rewrite it . it's so depressing . 
 Veronica ! Veronica ! Veronica ! Are you OK ? 
 I will come clean as soon as we get to safety , OK ? For now , you have to trust me , please ! I would never do anything to hurt you . 
 I haven ’ t been completely honest with you Veronica , I ’ m sorry . I ’ m not a fireman . I ’ m not even from the United States . I ’ m a spy for the Indian government . 
 When I was a young boy , I used to play cricket my father back in my hometown of Hyderabad . It was a peaceful town , and my father was a renowned chemist . One day , he was approached by members of the CIA , claiming that my father had made the discovery of the millennium in his small lab back at the university where he taught bio-chemistry . I never saw him again . I vowed to discover the whereabouts of my father and consequently joined the Indian Intelligence Bureau . 
 I ’ m sorry , I wasn ’ t supposed to meet you . I wasn ’ t supposed to fall in love with you , but you have to believe me when I tell you that what I feel for you is real . 
 Veronica , wait ! 
 Yes , you can draw your tax back at any customs in the EU . 
 No problem , sir . 
 Do you have any idea how many you'd like ? 
 Would you fill out this form , please ? 
 If you detect any difference , I'll take you out to dinner . 
 Thank you . Your order will be ready seven days from now . 
 We can certainly give you faster turnaround , but it will cost you extra . 
 Hello , Lucy , this is Monica . I ’ m calling for the accountant position . I saw the information about the vacancy on your company ’ s website . Is it still available ? 
 No , not yet . First , I want to check about the availability and see if you could give more information . 
 The notification period of my current job is not that long and I ’ m quite profession to English and I am happy with the traveling abroad as I ’ m good dealing with the people from other cultures . It makes the whole job even more interesting . I will send my resume to you still this week . 
 Is there anything wrong ? 
 It's hard for us to believe it . Our instruments have been the best quality for years . Have you any reliable evidence ? 
 Well . According to the contract , we are responsible for repairing or replacing those defective instruments . We ’ ll send our technicians to repair them . 
 I am sorry about the quality problem , but I propose we compensate you for 3 % of the total value apart from the inspection fee . 
 Excuse me ! 
 Yes , I'd like to send this book to France . 
 Can it go in an envelop ? 
 Do I need stamps ? 
 When will it arrive ? 
 We've got a new manager in our department . 
 Yes , I did . 
 Someone called Drexler . Carl Drexler . He's been with the company onlytwo years . I've been here longer . And I know more about the job , too 
 Because I'm the wrong sex , of course ! 
 Yes , that was probably it ! It isn't fair . 
 A dark suit . White shirt . A tie . Why ? 
 You mean you think I didn't get the job because I come to work in jeansand a sweater ? 
 Do you really think I should wear different clothes ? 
 Why should I wear a skirt ? Or a dress ? 
 Why should I do that ? I'm good at my job ! That's the only important thing ! 
 Excuse me , but can you tell me the way to the Today Mall ? 
 How long will it take me to get there ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 My long-term goal is to become an expert in this field . 
 In order to achieve that objective . I would work step by step and make further study . 
 She can cope with it . Don ’ t be such a wimp ! 
 I ’ m afraid he's not in . 
 Certainly . May I ask who ’ s calling , please ? 
 Northward Airlines . Can I help you ? 
 May I have your name and flight number , please ? 
 When are you leaving ? 
 And your destination ? 
 Hold the line , please . ( ... ) All right . Your seat is confirmed , Mr . Adams . You'll be arriving in Buenos Aires at 4 o'clock p . m . local time . 
 Yes , but please check in at least one hour before departure time . 
 No , sir . The plant expansion project has been delayed.There was a snag up in the fling process to get the necessary construction permits.It seems that the property we were slated to build on is also habitat for some endangered indigenous species . 
 The environmental review board has a team on it now.Hopefully we'll know more by the end of the week . 
 Yes , I have . In fact , I had worked for a foreign trade company for nearly two years , where I established business ties with several firms . 
 Visit customers , dispatch consignments and things like that . 
 Yes , I did . 
 I left it two months ago . I didn't think I could learn much there , and there were not many opportunities for self-development . 
 I've been informed that there are many opportunities to develop myself in your company . Besides , I grew up in a city in the Northeast . I have lots of acquaintances in the region , which might help to push sales . 
 Which account would you like to open ? 
 It is 3.2 % . You may earn a little interest on money . 
 Yes , the opening minimum deposit is 1,000 Yuan . 
 For the later deposits , you can deposit any you want . Even one Yuan is OK . 
 Your ID , please . 
 Wait a moment , please ... Here is your bankbook . Keep it well please . 
 We'd like some local-flavored pastry . Can you recommend some ? 
 What is that ? 
 That sounds appealing . OK , we will have that . 
 OK . We will try some . 
 No , it's enough . 
 OK . Thank you . 
 Here you are . 
 3 weeks . I am here on tour . 
 Shall we go for a drive today ? 
 Maybe you're right . 
 So , how are you feeling today ? 
 Do you have enough time to get the right amount of sleep ? 
 What time do you usually go to bed ? 
 Have you been under a lot of stress lately ? 
 Have you ever tried doing relaxation exercises before you go to bed ? 
 I'm freezing . Turn down the air conditioner , will you ? 
 Not if you take off your jacket . 
 Yes . I believe you have a luncheon meeting this coming Wednesday.Could you give me some more information about that ? 
 Mmm , that sounds very interesting . 
 You will have to take your driving test . Have you taken it yet ? 
 Could you fill these papers out , please ? 
 You need an appointment . 
 Is Friday good for you ? 
 Okay , so Friday at what time ? 
 All right . Come in on Friday at 11 
 I want a leather jacket . 
 Size 40 . 
 Let me see . Do you think a brown one will do ? 
 Really ? Please get it for me . 
 Is this dress made of pure silk ? 
 Is it washable ? 
 How much , please ? 
 All right . Will you wrap it for me ? 
 Yesterday I had a quarrel with my roommate . I'm really fed up with all this . 
 My roommate always brings a lot of friends from off-campus . They stay in the room until midnight , singing and talking , drinking and playing cards while I have no place for study . I even don't have the quietness to sleep . 
 Can I trouble you for some change ? 
 I need some cigarettes . 
 OK , thanks . 
 I'm a teacher . 
 I'll try a steak sandwich . 
 Yes , I'd like a chocolate shake . 
 Where are we going now ? 
 Where is it ? 
 What can we see in it ? 
 Anything else ? 
 Tragedy . 
 Excuse me , waiter . I have just dropped the spoon onto the ground . Would you please bring me another one ? 
 Thank you . We'd like to have some dessert . 
 Good morning , Paul ! 
 Yes , traffic wasn't much today , so I made it to the office earlier . 
 Well , about an hour or so . 
 No . I take public transportation . It's safer . 
 Well , both have advantages and disadvantages . 
 Oh , my computer crashed again ! 
 That would be great ! I hate working with computers ! 
 We'll miss you while you're studying in the United States . 
 Turn on the TV , please . 
 What's wrong with the TV ? It isn't clear and the color's not right . 
 Can you do something about it ? 
 That's better , but it's still not quite right . 
 Good idea . 
 Morning . Can I help you ? 
 All you need is your student identification card to check out books . 
 That's all you need . 
 You can check out two books at a time . But you can't check out newspapers , magazines and periodicals ; they have to be read within library . 
 For two weeks . After that you must renew the books if you wish to keep them longer . 
 Yes , over there to your left . 
 Yes , I want to buy some grapes . 
 People say grapes from XinJiang are much sweeter than other kinds . Please give me a kilo of that . 
 Make sure they are fresh . 
 Look , here're two coins named Kai Yuan Tong Bao — the sort of coin made in memory of the founding of a new dynasty . These two coins were made in different periods of the Tang Dynasty . 
 The one made in the early Tang period is bigger and has more characters on it , while the one with smaller and elegant characters was made in late Tang period . Look carefully , and tell me if you see the difference now . 
 Various methods were used in history to produce fake coins . We usually send the coin to an authorized unit to have it tested by experts with special machines . We can judge it with naked eyes . 
 Certainly , they did . Liao Coins and Song Coins , for example , coexisted in circulation during the Southern Song and Yuan period some 800 -1000 years ago . The Liao Coins look plain and bold in style , just like the characteristics of the Mongolian tribe . Let me look for one and show you . 
 Tell me a little bit about yourself , please . 
 Would you tell me something about your family ? 
 Good afternoon , sir . Gan I help you ? 
 Which brand are you interested in ? 
 Do you prefer imported ones or domestic ones ? 
 How about Flymo ? It's selling well . 
 Of course . The warranty period is one year . 
 Sure . But you must show us the receipt . If something comes up , we'll change it for you . 
 Should we ask Jason to play ? He's always watching movies on HBO . 
 Oh , come on ! The game is better with three people . Anyway , if we don't ask him to play , he'll be mad . 
 Excuse me . Could you give me some directions ? 
 A gas station . My car ran out of gas two blocks back . 
 Do you know the name of the street ? 
 By the way , do you know the price of the gas now ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Photograph . 
 Olympus . 
 No , usually I get my films developed at a photo studio , but I make my own enlargements . 
 Because I can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . That's more , but that saves money . 
 Have you brought your student card ? 
 In that case , you have to buy two full fare tickets . 
 Kevin ? Hi , it ’ s Elizabeth . I have a big favor to ask you . 
 Well , I ’ Ve got a huge load of typing and Mr . Blake has insisted I get it done by tomorrow afternoon . 
 Linda , it's really late . Let's call it a day . 
 Sure thing . Do you want me to give you a ride home ? 
 Don't mention it . It ’ s my pleasure . 
 Your office called and said that the owners had made a counter-offer to my offer to purchase their house . 
 I think that maybe I should accept their offer . 
 I want to make another offer , but I am afraid that they will decline and I will lose this house . 
 I would now like to offer three hundred and thirty thousand dollars as a counter-offer . 
 Can you tell me how long it will take them to get back to me ? 
 Hello , is that John ? 
 I am calling to tell you some issues about the interview . 
 Yes . I think it is now a moderate volume . 
 Thank you for that , and in return , here's your receipt . 
 I hope you'll visit us again , sir . 
 I guarantee you that our little “ friends ” won't be back . I hope your trip home is pleasant . 
 I want to work in the banking industry . I ’ Ve always been interesting in working for an international invest bank . I ’ d like to help people invest their money . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve sent letters to several banks . A few have invited me for interviews after we take our examinations . 
 Which field would you like to work in ? have you decide yet ? 
 Perhaps you should apply to banks as well . They need people to market their service . As you said , the banking industry pays well . 
 Is there any way you can cut us a better deal on your wholesale price for this order ? 
 Based on the estimate you gave us , by the time we figure in transportation and other expenses , our profit is short.With the offer you've given me , we're making next to nothing.Can ' t you do any better ? 
 I'll be honest with you , our budgeted cost can't exceed more than $ 150 per unit.That is our bottom line . If you can meet that price , you've got the deal.Otherwise ... 
 Will you be done doing my hair soon ? 
 How much time do you need ? 
 I think it looks gorgeous . 
 I honestly think it looks great . 
 How much is it for my hair ? 
 Thanks for doing such a good job . 
 Slow down ! You can't exceed the speed limits . 
 No , you can not . It is dangerous . 
 No . You shouldn't drive like that . 
 Why ? 
 I see . 
 You have drank dozens of cups . You are bound to get a bay window . 
 What case do you have against the police ? 
 I don ’ t understand . 
 They let you go , didn ’ t they ? 
 They detained you at the station ? 
 Why did they arrest you ? 
 I get it now . 
 who are you writing a letter to ? 
 OK . I guess I could add something . Tell them that I send my love . 
 well , maybe you could tell them about my promotion . 
 just today . I guess I forgot to mention it . 
 shouldn't we finish writing this letter first ? 
 it is good news , but it looked like you were almost finished . We might as well just sign off . 
 I guess you can write that I'm looking forward to seeing them in June . 
 and also thank them from the bottom of my heart for the Christmas package they sent us . 
 what would you do without me ? 
 I like this apartment . Do you think we can afford the mortgage ? 
 I love the balcony . We can sit outside and enjoy the sun in summer . We are on the 12th floor , so there ’ s very nice view from the balcony . 
 Yes , and there are many houses nearby . I like it that the neighbourhood isn ’ t full of apartment blocks . 
 Yes , it would . Don ’ t worry . There ’ s a lawn outside the building and there ’ s the park nearby . This place will be fine . 
 Yes , everything has been well designed . 
 Yes , I'm missing a sweater . I sent it in the laundry yesterday , but my laundry was returned without it . 
 505 . 
 That's all right 
 That's $ 20 in all . 
 Let me see . I am terribly sorry , sir . That should be $ 18 . 
 Excuse me . May I take a picture of you ? 
 I just want to show my children how an American policeman looks . 
 Oh , no , it won't . Just stand there , please . 
 It sounds a good idea . Let ’ s go . 
 Yes . I heard about that . And I know you want to buy it , but I ’ m not interested in detective novels . 
 Magazines about fashions , such as Cosmo Polian . 
 Yes . I can lend you some . 
 We seem to be lost here . 
 I suggest that we go and ask for help from the policeman . 
 Fixing computer isn ’ t my cup of tea . You can leave this job to Jason . 
 But what ? 
 You must be Mr.Sellers . I'm Steven . I am here to see the apartment you advertised . 
 Could I have a look at it first ? 
 It's nice . So this is the bathroom . And that must be the bedroom . 
 Is there air conditioning ? 
 What's the house rent ? When is the rent due ? And how much security deposit do you require ? 
 I like the apartment , Mr.Sellers . You can show me the lease . 
 Yes , this is a very popular car . 
 The car is beautiful , isn't it ? Come on inside and we'll discuss the price . 
 50000 yuan ' What a deal ! That will , of course , include tax , licence , and registration fee . 
 Then what price would be fair to you ? 
 I can see that you are a smart buyer . Forty thousand is my best price . 
 38000yuan is my final offer . 
 Mom , may I play the card games for a while ? 
 I won't make any noise . Mom , please . 
 Yes , I ' Ve finished . 
 er ... , mom , I promise . I won't make a single noise . 
 Ok . I won't get into trouble . 
 Thanks for the warning , Mom . 
 Thank you . It looks very attractive . 
 Tasty and tender ! It must be one of the famous local dishes . 
 And it must be very particular in cooking . 
 I see . 
 Good morning ! The Inland hotel . How may I help you ? 
 Certainly . What kind of room would you like ? 
 A single room ? That ’ s fine . In whose name shall I make the booking ? 
 We offer a 20 % discount for guests staying of Friday and Saturday . The total cost will be $ 80 , including breakfast . 
 Could I just take your credit card number please ? I should mention that there is a cancellation charge of $ 20 . 
 May I speak to the apartment building manager , please ? 
 I was hoping that the apartment on Main Street was still available . 
 Yes , it would be nice to see the apartment . 
 Yes , I can be there at 6 . 
 I'm okay , thank you . I already checked out the address on MapQuest . 
 Is there anything that I need to bring with me ? 
 Excuse me , I'm lost . Can you show me where I am in this map ? 
 That's great ! It's not my day . I just have very bad sense of direction . 
 I am supposed to go to Liu Ichang . 
 Yes . Yes . Can you tell me how to get there ? 
 Should I tell EDD that I have found a job ? 
 What difference does it make ? 
 If I take a short job and then get laid off , will I be starting over trying to get unemployment ? 
 You know , smoking does do harm to your health . 
 Why don't you try to give it up ? 
 Have you ever thought of just cutting down ? You could do it gradually . 
 I am keen on a coat on www.dingding.com . But it requires having an online banking account . Is it necessary ? 
 Do you know how to get the bank account ? 
 So easy . 
 My shopping life will be more convenient . 
 You can trust him . He always tells the truth . 
 I said you can trust him . You just have to believe it . 
 I like the old styles of dance . Such as fox-trot , waltz , rumba , tango and so on . They're all graceful . 
 Why not ? Do you think I should like modern dance ? 
 Oh , sorry . I don't like them . Why not ask Lily . She likes modern dance . 
 Hi , is this the Bread and Cheese Deli ? 
 I need to place an order for a couple of sandwiches and drinks . Can you deliver ? 
 I'm very annoyed at your disobedience . 
 You should have asked for my opinion before you did it . 
 You'd better remember your promise . 
 Of course not . We have 50 channels in all . 
 OK . I will send a maid to your room right now . 
 Easy come , easy go . 
 Yes , is that you , Allen ? 
 Not bad . 
 Sure.Thank you very much . 
 Ok , see you . 
 Boy , it looks like everyone in your family is here , from young to old . 
 And after church they come here for lunch ? 
 Yeah , what's up with that ? 
 They don't really think you took it , do they ? 
 How many of them were there ? 
 Like what ? 
 What on earth has that got to do with some money disappearing ? 
 Oh well , that's it . They obviously think you're a desperate criminal and you have to steal to eat . I should think you'll get thirty years . 
 How did you meet your girlfriend ? 
 That's great . Did you start dating right after you met , or did you become friends first ? 
 Isn ’ t he the best instructor ? I think * he ’ s so hot . Wow ! I really feel energized , don ’ t you ? 
 What ’ s wrong ? Didn ’ t you think it was fun ? ! 
 Oh , no , get off it . It wasn ’ t such a killer class . You just have to get into it . Like they say , no pain , no gain . 
 Look , next time get yourself some comfy shoes . You ’ re gonna come back again with me , aren ’ t you ? 
 Come on . You ’ ll feel better after we hit the showers . 
 Happy Halloween ! What creature are you going to dress up as ? 
 May I have a look at your costume ? 
 I like your black clothes and your fangs are cool . 
 Haha . Wish you good luck . 
 I ’ m in , let ’ s go ! 
 Geez ! What ’ s the rush ? 
 Are you nuts ! I ’ m not going to run a red light ! 
 What ’ s your problem ! Geez . Having a fit is not going to help ! 
 I ’ m going as fast as I can ! 
 You ’ re such a geek ! 
 Hi Vicky . 
 Yes . 
 That's no problem . I just wanted to tell you I'm inside . 
 On the second floor . 
 Come upstairs . 
 Oh , Can you hear me OK ? I said , come to the second floor . 
 Just looking at some books on how to learn English . 
 No , I'm still full from dinner . 
 I don't know for sure . When you get here we'll talk about it . 
 Bye . 
 I want to take out a loan for school . What kind of interest rate do you offer ? 
 Yes , but I need to borrow some more money . 
 What's the interest rate ? 
 How do I go about taking it out ? 
 All right , thank you ! 
 What ? 
 Too bad I missed it . 
 Oh , I am so tired . My back is sore and my neck hurts . 
 You are wrong , Shirley . I was always absent-minded in the class . I meant to concentrate on the class , but I was just so tired . Maybe I am old . 
 One of my friends took the Adult College Entrance Exam last year . He filled the school column with his name , and his score was relinquished . 
 He said he hadn't taken any exams for ten years , and couldn't get used to it immediately . He was extremely nervous then . 
 Yeah . The test was fairly easy and almost every test-taker could pass that exam . Adult College Entrance Exam is much easier than college entrance exam . And there are fewer subjects . 
 It's so earlier this morning , Mr . Li ! You just came back yesterday , you should have rest much more . 
 How about this post-trip ? 
 Really ? 
 OK , it's no problem . 
 Yes , what can I do for you ? 
 OK , please don't worry about it . You should set your mind at rest . 
 Thanks your flatter . 
 I think I may have seen it on the kitchen table . 
 who's the director ? 
 yes , it was fantastic ! Can I read the article when you're finished ? 
 that's ok . I'll wait until you're finished . Just out of curiosity , do you have a subscription for that magadize ? 
 how much does the magadize cost ? 
 that's quite expensive . Who is their target audience ? 
 I bet you'll still buy it , though . You wouldn't be able to live without your fashion magazine ! 
 Hi , Ross . Glad to see you , too . 
 A party ? Yes . I'd love to . Thank you for inviting me . Will Monica come ? 
 That's great ! What time will it start at ? 
 OK . I'll come . See you then . 
 Good morning , Mary . 
 Sunny side up , please . 
 Let's go now . 
 I couldn't wait to meet you in person . 
 Same here . 
 Do you believe in UFOs ? 
 But I never saw them . 
 You mean that you can them . 
 They come to the earth ? 
 Aliens from the outer space ? Do you talk to them ? What do they look like ? 
 That means that you talk to them ? In which language ? 
 Wow . Sounds fantastic ! 
 Hold on , please . 
 Sorry , but she ’ s out . 
 I ’ d be glad to . 
 Yes . Why ? 
 Just asking ? ! Why is your face burning like mad ? Ah-huh , someone has a crush on Jenny , doesn't he ? 
 Come on , Ted ! Don't be such a chicken . If you like her , you ’ Ve got to tell her . Maybe she likes you . 
 What are you so afraid of ? Just tell her what you are feeling about her . 
 But that's better than keeping everything to yourself . You ’ Ve got to let her know . Come on ! You ’ Ve got to take a chance . Even though you are rejected , it ’ s not the end of the world . There ’ s nothing to lose , is there ? 
 Excuse me . Does this bus go by Tiananmen square ? 
 At which stop should I get off ? 
 Okay , thanks very much . 
 Oh , there are so many good ones ! I loved the Spice Girls . They were so cool ! 
 I was really sad too , but at least I can still listen to their Cds . 
 I'm not sure . 
 Really ? I'm sorry . I did not know that . 
 Why can't you just let me off with a warning ? 
 How much is the fine ? 
 I have to be at court ? 
 All right . Just give me the ticket . 
 Oh , honey , you made a mistake . 
 OK . Let's do it together . 
 16 divided by 2 equals 8 . 
 You are looking really healthy lately . What are you doing differently ? 
 Tell me about it . I'm interested . 
 Ha ! That's right . You used to smoke . I forgot ! 
 At the gym ? 
 Are you okay ? 
 What's wrong ? 
 By who ? 
 Are you hurt ? 
 That's crazy . 
 Do you want me to take you ? 
 What can I do for you ? 
 What did you do to this book ? 
 You will need to pay for the damage . 
 I ’ m going to need $ 5.00 . 
 It isn ’ t . 
 Thank you . 
 Hi , Cindy . I thought I ’ d missed you . 
 It ’ s all right . 
 I was in a comfortable place , so really , it ’ s no problem . I am happy to see you . Did the rain hold you up long ? 
 I totally understand . 
 I worked in a foreign representative office for one year . However , I leave there two years ago because the work they gave me was rather dull . I found another job that was more interesting . 
 I have learned a lot about business know-how and basic office skills . In addition , I learned at my previous jobs how to cooperate with my colleagues . 
 I guess so . Now Anna's got four kids and another on the way . 
 That's Anna for you . She keeps up the image of the stylish Italian woman . Here she comes . 
 Yeah , or the expensive Italian facial treatments . 
 You should wear a formal dress and be confident . 
 You should take several resumes and some copies of your graduate diploma . 
 Aw , shucks , ma'am . 
 Could you tell me something about safety deposit box rental , please ? I need somewhere safe to keep some insurance documents ; I just simply don't feel comfortable keeping them at home or in the office . 
 I think I'll go for the smallest , as it's just for documents . Will I be the only key holder ? I'd perhaps feel a little nervous if I knew someone else could have access to it at any time . 
 That's great ; I can give an extra key to my wife . I feel perfectly comfortable with her having a key . Thanks for your help . 
 OK , I'll take a small , for 1 year , in this branch , please . 
 In a while , crocodile . 
 I have to go to work . 
 I ’ m working at the polling place . 
 I work at the polling place every year . 
 I signed up for it online . 
 It ’ s a very cool job . 
 They pay well enough . 
 Yes I have . I ’ Ve been there three times in the past year . 
 No I haven ’ t . I haven ’ t visited the Bund either . I ’ Ve always had too much work to do . 
 Actually , I ’ Ve eaten soup dumplings in a lovely restaurant on Nanjing Lu . They were delicious ! 
 It's not like him to be late . 
 It's huge . 
 Yes , of course . 
 May I help you , sir ? 
 When do you want to go ? 
 There ’ s a train at 7 a . m . It'll get you there at 11 a . m . But there are many stops along the way . 
 Yes , there is one at 8: 30 a . m . That arrives at 11:35 a . m . 
 Sure . 
 I will . 
 I see . And I'll always be devoted to you . 
 I'll never hurt you ; I'll never lie . 
 It can't be dry , and can't die . 
 Aha , Aha ... 
 What's the problem ? 
 Let me take a look . Maybe I can figure it out . 
 Hello , is Mr Over there 
 I want 6420422 3 , is that right ? 
 oh , I'm sorry to bother you . 
 Did you put this morning's faxes on my desk ? I'm waiting for some urgent faxes from headquarters , I'm pretty sure they came in last night . 
 Yeah , you're going to have to call them and get them to be re-faxed . These copies are so dark , I can't make out any of the words . 
 This one ? This one is so light I can barely read it . How can that be ? 
 Yes , but this one will have to be re-faxed as well . And look , there's about three pages missing ! It looks loke the fax machine ate half my important faxes , and the ones that made it through are so blurred or too light , they're unreadable ! 
 Who wants to go first ? Allen ? 
 OK . Put on something by the Backstreet Boys ! 
 I'd better not . Brooke hates the Backstreet Boys ! 
 Yes , what kind of apartment are you interested in ? 
 Yes , I have one . When you need it ? 
 Well , It's a one-bedroom apartment . The monthly rent at 650 dollars and a 300 dollars security deposit . You pay electricity only . Gas and water is included . Both the heat and stove are gas . Let me see , what else ... Oh , you'll be assigned a sheltered parking space at no extra charge . And that's probably it . 
 Sure . What time would you like to come ? 
 Good , May I have your name , please ? 
 Thanks for calling , Blanca . I'll see you tomorrow . 
 I ’ m sorry , sir . Could you tell me your name and order again , please ? I ’ ll check on the delay . 
 Thank you , Mr . Morris . Please wait one moment and let me check on the order . Would you like anything to drink , sir ? On the house . 
 I was told to come over to this window if I want to make a withdrawal . I'm not withdrawing from a Current Account , you see . I want to withdraw from my Certificate of Deposit . 
 Oh , I see . Will I lose any money if I decide to withdraw on it now ? 
 Oh dear . Well , if it has to be done , then it has to be done . 
 OK , the job is a full-time one . 
 We need a person with ability and flexibility . 
 No , this isn't . 
 Sure . Wait a minute . 
 Yes . He carries a lot of weight . Everyone here is willing to follow his orders . 
 There are three of them , the Three Tenors . 
 Yeah , it's really a unique experience . It's a solo concert by Pavarotti . He put on the performance in the Forbidden City in Beijing . 
 Besides , speaking of classical music , we should never forget about the New Year's Concert . 
 Sure . It's undoubtedly one of the biggest classical music events . Have you ever been to the live show ? 
 Wow , you are so lucky . I saw that one on TV . But it must be so different to be there in the concert hall . 
 Who was the conductor at that event ? 
 So cool . I wish I can go to the live New Year's Concert someday in the future . 
 I believe in that . Well , the performance is about to begin . Let's be quiet . 
 I am . 
 I think I'm in love . 
 Her name is Jenny . 
 We are in the same math class . Our teacher sat us next to each other . 
 She's very funny . She makes me laugh all the time . 
 Whatever brought us together , I'm happy . 
 Well , as I mentioned before , I think I am easy-going . I enjoy working and talking with people and I'm a responsible person . 
 No . Not at all . I'm quite easy-going . 
 Oh , I'm very responsible , I can make fast decisions , and I do not need much supervision . I enjoy completing challenging tasks . 
 Probably routine , dull work . Oh , I am much more enthusiastic if I'm given a challenge and responsibility . 
 A friendly one . I think an open , friendly , honest relationship should exist . An employee should feel she ( he ) can go to her ( his ) boss anytime with any kind of question . 
 Well , there's a lot of stress in a Chinese company also , although much of it is below the surface . I have confidence in my ability to handle conflict . If I have a problem with a co-worker , I do everything I can to work it out directly with that person . If I am unable to work it out , then I ask a supervisor to help out . If my boss shouts at me , I try not to take it personally . I try my best to understand the stress he is under . It's kind of like being in a family . Often family members say things in the heat of the moment , but don't mean what they say . A company is like a family , it has good times and bad times . 
 That's no problem . I know that every company has busy periods . When this happens , I'm ready to put in as much time as necessary to get the job done . 
 I want to feel that I am making a real contribution to the company , so I would like my boss to trust me with important work . 
 I'm quite outspoken . I enjoy calling a spade a spade and hate talking in a roundabout way . So I'd call myself outgoing . 
 Seldom . But I hate someone's frequently being late or lazy . 
 Hmm . as I mentioned , I can work well under pressure and I enjoy work that challenges me . I think that my English ability is also a strong point . 
 I think I sometimes try to be over-organized . So I am learning how to let some things go and concentrate on the most important part of my job . 
 We don't have a swimming pool , sir , but we do have swim stations in the gym . 
 It's just a deep bathtub with a current of water that you swim against . 
 As a guest , sir , you pay nothing . 
 If you want to swim , you can visit the gym any day between 7 a . m . and 10 p . m . 
 I'm sure you'll enjoy your workout , sir . Everyone seems to like the swim stations . 
 I'm starving . Let's go grab a bite . 
 How about Karlis ? 
 True . ok Let's go to Grumose ? 
 I guess it is a little pricy . 
 That will be Ok . Come on , I can't wait to chow down . 
 Is that why you stiffed the waiter ? 
 Mr . Jones , shall we now discuss the packaging ? 
 Good . A wrapping that catches the eye will certainly help push the sales . With competition from similar garments producers , the merchandise must not only be good value but also look attractive . 
 What about the outer packing ? 
 Cartons ? 
 Could you use wooden cases instead ? 
 I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for such a heavy load . 
 Maybe you are right , but the goods are to be transhipped at Hamburg or London . If the boxes are moved about on an open wharf , the dampness or rain may get into them . This would make the blouses spotted or ruined . 
 Well , I don't want to take any chances . Besides , cartons are easy to cut open , and this increases the risk of pilferage . 
 Maybe so , but I'm afraid that in case of damage or pilferage , the insurance company will refuse compensation on the ground of improper packing , or packing unsuitable for sea voyage . 
 If you could guarantee compensation in case the insurance com - any refuses to honor a claim for faulty packing , we would be quite willing to accept cartons . 
 I can understand your position . Perhaps I'm asking too much . 
 Well , I'll call you immediately for instructions on the matter . 
 How is Jim recently ? 
 Poor guy ! It will take him a long time to get back on his feet . 
 What is it ? 
 You big scrooge ! 
 But you may have some trouble convincing the kids . 
 Now we know that they realize the real meaning of Christmas . 
 OK , Mr . Coffee Connoisseur , so what's the next step in the coffee-making process ? 
 Let me guess , Mocha , Mandheling , and Santos ! 
 No , I just read the names off the packages ... Ha ! 
 Nice to meet you , Lvan.My name is Alike . I'm from Japan . 
 A second language is always difficult . 
 A crazy language ? Why do you say that ? 
 No wonder you say English is a crazy language . 
 Hi , this is Susan Smith . I ’ m calling about my appointment with Doctor Brown today at 3 
 I got the flu . I have a fever and a headache . Can I cancel my appointment ? 
 Oh , there ’ s a charge ? Why ? 
 I see . That ’ s ok . I ’ ll pay . 
 No . Not right now . When I feel better I ’ ll call you again . 
 Thank you . 
 It's me , Ali . There's this strange guy who keeps coming around . He's been here three times this week . 
 He makes me nervous . He looks at me funny . And he never buys anything ! 
 Excuse me , sir , this is the express check-out lane for people that have fifteen items or fewer . It looks like you have more than fifteen items there . 
 Fine ! Please place your items on the belt and push your shopping cart through . Do you prefer paper or plastic ? 
 No problem , I ’ ll take those . Sir , these coupons expired yesterday . 
 Do you have a club card or will it be cash ? 
 Will this be debit or credit ? 
 Yeah , sure . Your total is seventy-eight dollars and thirty-three cents . Here is your receipt . Have a nice day . 
 That was quick work . Let me have a look at it . Yeah , everything looks fine now . Thank you very much . 
 How much do I owe you ? 
 Really ? You worked here for just half an hour . I consider the price very high . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve been getting harassing calls recently . Can I have my phone number changed ? 
 How about 560 436 4040 . 
 How about 560-436-8976 ? 
 As soon as possible . Can I have it right now ? 
 Thanks . 
 I hope we'll get together again soon . 
 Thank you . 
 Son , you just go back to bed , and stop crying wolf . 
 Put it on my VISA . 
 What ’ s wrong with it ? 
 You ’ re kidding me ! 
 I only have one card . 
 I don ’ t have any cash on me . 
 I ’ ll be back tomorrow . 
 Yes , I had a bf before . 
 We parted from each other last month . 
 Mmmm , no . How about you ? 
 Haha , so you are my E-bf . 
 Mmmm . .. OK , let's try to be . 
 Hey ! What is it ? 
 LL 
 I have no champagne right now . How about this ? 
 Is it made of chocolate ? 
 Oh , I will have a sweet dream . 
 A little bit . I have to go to sleep though I don't want to . 
 Thx.Bye for now . Kisssssssssss . 
 So are you going to get a new swimsuit ? 
 Why don't you get a bikini ? 
 You aren't fat . I'll bet you'd look great in a bikini . How about this thong bikini ? 
 I guess that one-piece isn't too bad , either . ( to be continued ) 
 Really ? That's a straws in the wind . 
 Yeah . They suit each other . A perfect match between a man and a girl . 
 Really ? You've done a good job . 
 I have never heard that men would trim their eyebrows . Are you kidding ? 
 Do you mean that it is a trend for men to trim their eyebrows ? 
 Yeah , let me have a try . 
 I'm sorry , sir , we don't have one . However , in our gym , we do have swim stations . 
 Think of a deep bathtub that you can swim in , but against a current . 
 Sir , guests pay nothing to use the stations . 
 The gym is open 24/7 , but the stations are open from 7 a . m . to 10 p . m . only . 
 I think you'll like the experience , sir . It's a great workout . 
 Which bank ? There are two , the Allied Irish Bank and the Bank of Ireland . 
 You need to go to the Allied Irish Bank which is near the local shopping centre , Dunned Stores . 
 Cross the road and turn left at the other side . Walk along the footpath until you reach the traffic lights . You will see a shopping centre on the right hand side . Walk across the road and turn right after the shopping centre . Keep going straight for about 100m and the bank is to your left . 
 It's not so complicated . It's about five minutes walk from here . I can draw a map for you if you wish . 
 You will be going northwards . You are now in the the Western part of the city and the Allied Irish Bank is situated in the North East . Here's a rough sketch of the area . 
 First , you have had an impressive growth record , ever since the company had been founded for half a century . Second , I can improve myself by working here . 
 Yes , I get it . Will the medical plan cover me while on duty ? 
 Yes , I have read . In the contract , I am expected to be available up to two hours past normal working hours . Is that right ? 
 That's exactly my understanding . 
 Hi , my name is Sovia.What ’ s your name ? 
 What do you do ? 
 I ’ m a nurse.What do you do in your free time ? 
 I like to hang out with my friends , play games and go swimming . 
 Sure , that ’ d be great.Where would you like to go ? 
 Aren ’ t you sweet . 
 I need to finish my research paper . 
 Honey , I am sorry I have no time . 
 I am afraid you are right . Recently , even going upstairs makes me out of breath . 
 Terrific ! It is also a good exercise to keep me fit . 
 OK , I'll go . 
 Sure . 
 Yes , it sure is . I had to run here from work ! I need to rush as I'm on my lunch break . 
 Oh , that's so nice of you ! Thank you very much . 
 Sure . Well , the avocado sandwich is delicious , and it's the healthiest thing on the menu . Personally , I think the beef salad is the tastiest choice . I usually get that . Also , the milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town ! 
 Oh , don't mention it . 
 I think they must have horrible lives . All the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . They must get sick of it . 
 I think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . They only want it for their films . 
 Show biz stars have plenty of expenses . That ’ s why they need so much money . They need million of dollars to buy big , seclude houses and wonderful dresses . I bet most show biz stars would prefer to Wea 
 I think you should give them some credit . They ’ re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves 
 Too much , Harry . Don't blame her anymore . 
 I know . But there's no point in making her feel worse , isn't there ? 
 Alright , we need to have a plan here . First of all , which bed do you want ? 
 Alright . Do you have a coin ? 
 Heads . 
 Oh , well . So you get the bottom bunk . What about our stereos ? It looks like we both brought our stereos . Probably we only have room for one . 
 No , I don't mind . I just don't know where we can put the speakers in this tiny room . 
 Alright . That's a good plan . What about the desks ? We have two desks , one by the window and one by the door ? Which one do you want ? 
 Yes , I agree . 
 Alright . 
 Is that right ? 
 Well , I hope you let me hang out with you then . Maybe I can learn from you . 
 Are all lucky people so stuck up ? 
 Anyway , I get the desk by the window , you get the bottom bunk . That's it . 
 I will go get something to eat . You unpack first.Then , when I come back , I'll unpack . 
 Guess what came in the mail today ? 
 My acceptance letter to Yale ! 
 Freshman orientation is the last week of august , but I want to go two weeks before that to get settled in . 
 Yes . I ’ ll be very busy ! I have to get a visa , buy a plane ticket , and pack my things . But first , I want to register for classes . 
 Well , they sent me their prospectus , so I can start looking now . do you want to help me decide which classed to take ? 
 Well , I have to take all the fundamental course , plus a few from my major . 
 I hope to major in English literature , but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year , so we ’ ll see . 
 In order to graduate , every student must take a certain amount of classes in history , math , English , philosophy , science and art . 
 Yes , it is . It ’ s also very different from the British education system . 
 oh , sure . In British , students don ’ t have to take the foundation course . 
 maybe because they think they know everything already ! ha ha . 
 No , are there any vacant beds for us ? 
 Just an ordinary one , six people living in a room . 
 3 days . 
 I've got a sore throat , a runny nose and a headache . 
 I am not very sure . Maybe for three days . 
 I guess so . It comes and goes . 
 Is that serious , doctor ? 
 Oh , doctor . Do I have to ? I am afraid of needles ! 
 Oh , doctor , please ... 
 You are right . I won't cry anymore . 
 We have to find a shelter . 
 Let's go under the tree . 
 Then let's go to that store . 
 What is it ? 
 It's huge ! 
 The craftsmanship is excellent . 
 Thank you so much . 
 Would you recommend some places for sightseeing ? 
 Is it worth seeing ? 
 I'm so angry . I feel like killing someone . 
 Donna ! How are you ? It's good to hear your voice . 
 So how are things in the land of the free and the home of brave ? 
 Things are so great here . I almost smiled myself to death last week . One of my coworkers had to give me CPR . 
 Or a curse . 
 That , my dear , was classic sales technique delivered by a professional . 
 Heck no , we doubled the price , but because it's you , I'll let you have'em at 50 off . 
 I could , but where's the fun in that ? 
 Can you stay a little longer ? 
 Hello , Jack ! Fancy meeting you here ! 
 Fine . How is Jim ? 
 Good idea ! 
 Actually it was the most interesting day I ’ Ve had so far . 
 I did ! I found this lovely teapot . It was the best one I saw in the shops . 
 I took a taxi . It seemed the easiest thing to do . 
 I did actually but I think I met some of the friendliest people in China . They soon showed me the way ! 
 That ’ s all right . Everyone feels under the weather sometimes . Just finish the rest when you feel well . 
 You are pulling my legs ! 
 Good afternoon . May I help you ? 
 May I see your ticket and passport , please ? 
 Please put your baggage on the scale . 
 Thirty two kilos . 
 No . They aren't . 
 Sure . But please attach this claim tag . 
 Here is your boarding pass . 
 Gate Four . Please go and have a seat in the waiting hall . 
 It depends on where you are and what position you are in . For instance , if you are in an elevator and you smile , you will make other takers uncomfortable . 
 I cannot see eye to eye with you here . You see , I am fed up with those who keep smiling to me . I mean , they smile for no reason at all . 
 So , Fred , what are your plans for after graduation ? 
 That ’ s cool . Have you already found an apartment to live in ? 
 I couldn ’ t even if I wanted to . My parents told me that if I went home , then ’ d have to find my own place . 
 Not really , they just don ’ t want me living at home . My older sister did that , and she lived at home for seven years . Once she started living at home , it got harder and harder for her to move out . 
 My parents just didn ’ t handle my older sister very well , and because of that , they want me to be more independent . They think that it ’ s important that I should learn how to live on my own . 
 Who is it ? 
 Wait a sec . 
 We're watching a football match . What's the matter ? 
 I'm sorry about this . 
 You can rest assured that we won't disturb others anymore . 
 Yes , Mr . Li . 
 I also have done it . 
 Yes . They have been laid by their name cards on the meeting table for each attendant . 
 What is it ? 
 Do you mean you want to sell up your company of your own ? 
 That ’ s not a bad idea . Bet after all you should get some sound financial guarantee . 
 Sure.Which one ? 
 Where do you want to sit ? 
 Are these seats all right ? They're in the second rows . 
 Sorry.We ' Ve nothing further back . 
 Thirty yuan . 
 Do you know anyone who ’ s had plastic surgery ? 
 Why not ? Why can't we go back to the way things were ? 
 Darned right I would ! 
 Come on , Liz . Be open-minded ! Look at my eyes , they are puffy . And my eye bags , they are dark and loose and full of lines and circles . I really hope surgery can wipe out the tired feelings . 
 I don't care what other people think . I am ready for a lift . 
 You should first write your name and contact information . 
 Such as your land line phone number , mobile phone number and e-mail box . 
 Then you should write your objectives , such as seeking a position in foreign trade . 
 Yes . After that you should emphasize your skills , educational background and related experience . 
 Don't worry . It will take time to accumulate experience . You need to be confident for yourself . 
 Generally from the college 
 When would you like me to send those plans over to your office , Mr . Montgomery ? 
 That shouldn ’ t be a problem . What is the exact address , again ? 
 You've decided that you definitely want to purchase this particular one ? 
 I would recommend that you at least glance through these brochures , just to make sure that you have selected the right policy for you . Take your time , Sir . 
 Of course , Sir . If I could have your details again and your ID , I'll check them and we can go on . 
 I ’ m well . And you ? 
 I don ’ t know if I told you or not , but I decided to start my own business . 
 I ’ Ve started an investment banking firm with some of my old colleagues from Goldman Sachs . 
 it started off a bit slow , but now , business is really booming ! 
 our headoffice is here in Beijing , but we ’ re planning on opening up two more offices soon . 
 if all goes well , we ’ ll open one up in Hong Kong in April and another one in Singapore in October . 
 we ’ re negotiating the final details of the leasing contracts tomorrow . 
 thanks ! 
 Yes . I ’ Ve finished making the birthday cake and I ’ Ve put all the things on the table . Did you find the party hats ? 
 Thanks . Do you think we have enough for the kids to eat and drink ? 
 That birthday cake looks wonderful , but you haven ’ t put any candles on it yet . 
 I ’ Ve brought a tape with lots of children ’ s songs on it . 
 This motor oil case is still really slippery . 
 Sure , why not ? I think I want a chocolate chip cookie , too . 
 So what ? 
 What's wrong , Lisa ? You keep pacing back and forth . 
 Don't worry . You'll do fine . 
 Yeah , I ’ Ve been meaning to talk to you about that . I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline . 
 Well , the thing is , we ran into a lot of problems . . . 
 I know , and I apologize for the delay . But some things were just beyond my control . I had trouble booking the photographer , and then Michael was sick for three weeks , so I couldn ’ t include him in the photos , and the design team lost all the files , so I had to re-do the pictures . 
 Happy birthday , John . Many happy returns of the day ! 
 Well , making good wishes . 
 Sure . We hope your wish will come true . 
 No . 
 A little , but not very well . 
 2 months . 
 I'm a student . How about you ? 
 What time does the train for Boston leave ? 
 When does it arrive ? 
 How much is a one-way ticket ? 
 We're broke . 
 The whether in Beijing is just beautiful . 
 Yes . I can see . The summer heat is over . And the winter cold is still far away . 
 Autumn is also very nice In Washington . 
 No . it isn ’ t . But sometimes it slows a lot in winter . 
 Oh . Yes . Sometimes it rains very heavily 
 There ’ s a lot of rain in summer . But it seldom rains in autumn 
 That ’ s true . many people from the south don ’ t like the whether here . 
 No . I ’ m from the north . I was born in Beijing actually . 
 Excuse me . Where can I buy some cigarettes ? 
 Can I also get some souvenirs there ? 
 By the way , where is the men's room ? 
 Thank you . 
 Can you help me , please ? 
 I want to send this small parcel to Canada . 
 How different are these rates ? 
 How long it will take by sea ? 
 Then , by sea , please . 
 All right . Thank you very much . 
 Are you interested in going sightseeing , Mr . Simpson ? I think you are here not only for the negotiation but also for sightseeing . 
 Shall we go to the Tiananmen Square first ? 
 It's my pleasure . Shall we go there on foot ? It's very near . 
 Mike , shall we book two tickets online ? 
 Yeah . How many tickets remain ? 
 Brilliant idea ! That will make our journey rewarding and much safer . 
 One of many abundant resources , I'd like to point out . 
 Good morning , nurse . I want to see the dentist , please . 
 No , I don't . 
 Yes , it is . It's very urgent . I feel awful . I have a terrible toothache . 
 I must see the dentist now , nurse . 
 That's very late . Can the dentist see me now ? 
 I can wait , but my toothache can't ! 
 Not well . I ’ Ve been feeling pretty lonely lately . 
 You know what they say'a friend to all is a friend to none ' . I don ’ t feel like I really know any of my friends . In fact , I should probably call them acquaintances , not friends . 
 I know you are , you are my girlfriend . I wish I had a guy friend to hang out with sometimes . 
 Not at all . 
 That ’ s a good idea . 
 I ’ m not sure . I guess I ’ d like to meet some people who have a positive attitude and want to have a good time . 
 That ’ s a possibility . Thanks ! 
 I went on a trip with my family last week . 
 We went to Europe . 
 London , Paris and a few other cities . 
 No , We didn't go there . I'd like to go there next time . 
 That's what I've heard . 
 Thanks . 
 That's absolutely ridiculous ! 
 Excuse me , what did you say ? 
 That's incredible . I can't believe it . 
 How amazing ! 
 Well you know , claiming that your grandmother is sick is the classic excuse used to get out of doing something . 
 Is there anything I can do to help ? Just remember that I'm there for you if you want to talk about it . 
 OK . You ’ d better come back in two hours . 
 Well , there are 2 reasons . First of all , I'm itching to work in a foreign enterprise . Secondly , your branch is a new establishment in Beijing . I think I'll be assigned more workload and responsibilities here . 
 Yes , of course . The balance sheet contains 3 major sections , that is , assets , liabilities and owner's equity . 
 Drop in if you're free.Bye for now ! 
 What do you think of the way people use and treat animals ? 
 Perhaps people should stop eating animals . We could grow more crops . 
 We could provide them with better conditions anyway . We should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos . We should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible . 
 I agree . I ’ m an adult and I love going to the zoo . I don ’ t like animals experiments though . I believe that we can do tests in other ways . 
 That ’ s good news . The good thing is that most people treat their pets well . 
 Have you every given money to any of the charities that take care of animals . 
 Stewardess ! 
 May I have a magazine or a newspaper please ? 
 I'd like sports , please . 
 Oh ! I read this before . May I have another one instead please ? 
 Oh , I'm a little busy these days . 
 Don ’ t you know Christmas is coming ? I have a lot of things to get ready . 
 Yeah , so I have to buy presents for everyone before I leave . 
 Americans don ’ t like giving money , they prefer presents you buy for them . So I have to figure out what to buy for all of my family and friends . 
 I will . Merry Christmas . 
 Shift it a little before you get up . 
 Do you develop films here ? 
 Well , the 4 x 6 is fine . 
 The last one is black and white , all the rest should need color . 
 I hope they will come out well . When should I pick them up ? 
 Yes , it is . And develop them as glossy as possible . 
 Yes , a roll of Kodak film please . 
 Oh ! Is it too hot ? I'm sorry . 
 OK ! Here you go . 
 Excuse me . Do you study Chinese at this university ? 
 It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing . 
 Yes , I am . I am from Guangzhou . I am here to study international relations . 
 I like it so far . But my English still needs work . 
 Are there any seats left for Saturday night ? 
 I suppose there's nothing cheaper , is there ? 
 I have a sweet tooth . I can not help but think about having something sweet between meals . 
 That sounds really attractive . Let's go to that candy shop now . 
 why not ? I would like to buy some candies . Since there are so many people , I think they must have delicious candy . 
 They have lollypops , chocolate drops , fruit candy , mints , pearbrittles and toffee . They are in different colors and flavors . 
 Me too . I finally understand why a small shop like this can always befilmed with dozens of people . 
 You are a candy terminator . Be careful or you'll get a lot of cavities . 
 You really can't live without candy . 
 I have a headache . These past few days I've been living off painkillers . Man , I feel like my head is going to explode . 
 The results are too slow . On top of that , just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me . 
 But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ? 
 Scraping is too terrifying . When they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . Cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . It looks like someone beat you up . 
 Chinese medicine is strange . The patients are already ill , and then the doctor makes them suffer more . 
 Forget it . I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself . In a little while I'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap . 
 What can I do for you today ? 
 Tell me the problem . 
 Oh , I see . 
 Do you still want both classes ? 
 I'll try to change one to a different day . 
 Miss , which is the movie channel ? I can't find it . 
 Thanks so much . 
 Yes , please . May I get a glass of lemonade ? 
 May I get an order of barbeque wings ? 
 That'll be fine for now , thank you . 
 Excuse me . I'm ready to order . 
 Let me have the baby-back ribs . 
 That will be it for now . 
 Yeah , I do . I guess I'm a real fitness freak . 
 Well , I do aerobics every day after work . And then I play racquetball . 
 Oh , do you want to play sometime ? 
 Pretty well , I guess . 
 No problem , Rod . I won't play too hard . 
 I'd like to , but I've got to write a term paper . It will be due by this Thursday . 
 I know it is no good for my health if I am staying in the classroom all day . But how about my paper ? 
 I'm terribly sorry I can't go with you . Shall we find some other time ? 
 She is so pretty sick . 
 Thank you . 
 Speaking . What can I do for you ? 
 I am sorry.sir , I will check for you.what ' s your room number ? 
 Fine.we we'll send it to you right now . 
 Yes . 
 That will be fine . 
 I want to pick up my valuables . 
 Sure . Here you are . 
 Yes , thank you . 
 No thanks . We just need our check . Have you seen the waitress ? 
 Yes , the service hasn't been the best . Is that our waitress over there ? 
 Good idea . Just bring it back and we'll figure it out together . 
 How much do you think we should leave for a tip ? 
 I agree , but we don't really know the whole story . There may have been problems in the kitchen beyond her control . 
 I agree . We will leave $ 3.60 for the tip . 
 Thank you . No . I ’ m late for dinner at my house . I really have to go . 
 I ’ d appreciate that . 
 Thanks . 
 Yes , speaking . 
 No , I haven't got one by now . I will go to the interview of yours . 
 What's the problem ? 
 That's easy . If I were you , I'd date me ! 
 Please , call my John . Well , there ’ s a subway stop and bus station just around the corner . Do you have children ? 
 Well , in that case , the schools in this area are very good . 
 Oh , well . As far as other conveniences in the neighborhood , there ’ s a grocery store just up the block , and there ’ s lots of little shops nearby . 
 Here ’ s my card , just give me a call if you ’ re interested . 
 For a local paper in York called the York Herald . Actually , I started with them as an intern in the beginning . I was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism , and this seemed like a g 
 They seemed impressed , and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . I ended up staying two years there actually . I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . I really 
 Yes , that ’ s right . My husband and I moved to London , and so I managed to find a position with a National newspaper based in London . 
 Yes , in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future . 
 No , thank you . I'm on a diet . 
 I'm considering entering for the beauty contest this summer , so I must have a slender figure . 
 I'm afraid the judges do not think so . All the beauty contests are for slim girls only . 
 How much do they weigh ? 
 But I'm not fat enough to enter that contest . 
 Hello , is Doris available ? 
 Hi , Doris , this is Mike calling from Parker's Dentistry . I'm calling to confirm your appointment for tomorrow morning at 9 am with Dr.Parker . 
 If I put you in at a later spot , would that work out ? 
 Sorry ma'm , the only opening we have after lunch is one fifteen , but I might be able to work you in after 4 . would that be a better time ? 
 No problem . I have you appointment changed from tomorrow morning to tomorrow afternoon at one fifteen . 
 Hi Melissa , are you going home this weekend ? 
 Where do your parents live ? 
 How about your mother ? 
 Oh , I am sorry to hear that . Is your father still working ? 
 Do you have any family here ? 
 Do you have any brothers or sisters ? 
 Do you see them a lot ? 
 It's very thoughtful of you to invite me to your wedding . 
 My best wishes to you and the bride ! 
 How did your company's fundraiser go ? 
 So how does it work ? How were you able to make money with the marathon ? 
 Sounds like a great deal for the American Cancer Society . 
 Have you bought a lot of new clothes for your vacation ? 
 What does travel light mean ? 
 Excuse me , is this the baggage claim area from KL17 ? 
 Well , this is my baggage claim tag . Can you get my baggage now ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 It looks very nice and the food looks delicious . 
 Really ? 
 No , I haven ’ t . I have never eaten jellyfish before . 
 No , I have not and I ’ m not sure I want to try them now . 
 Yes , please . I ’ m Mr . Peter , the Director of Personnel . What can I do for you ? 
 Oh , yes . How do you do , Miss Wang ? Sit down , please . 
 What was your major in school ? 
 Have you done any work in this field ? 
 What section did you work in ? 
 So you must be very familiar with export procedures . 
 That's good . 
 Not good . The doctor told him not to smoke again , but it just rolls off him like water off the duck ’ s back ! 
 I hope it will be of some use . 
 My grandmother just passed away . 
 A couple of days ago . I just go back from the funeral . 
 No ... not really . The sad thing is that I wasn't there when she died . I really wanted to be there one last time . 
 Yeah . She died in her sleep . 
 At least she didn't suffer . 
 I know . But I miss her . 
 Yeah ? That's what I was thinking too . Thanks . 
 You're right ... I should eat something . Let's go . 
 I ’ d stay over there , if I were in your shoes . 
 See your problem ? You get so restless when it ’ s time to calm down . 
 Hi , Doris . You look a little bit down . What's the matter ? 
 Really ! 
 How do you feel about that ? 
 Mm , so what are you going to miss about Japan ? 
 What especially about the night life are you going to miss ? 
 How are the clubs different in Japan than in London ? 
 Did you like the Chanel bag that I got ? 
 I bought it on eBay . It was only one-tenth of the original price . And the purchase was so easy . 
 Well , it came with a certificate , and it looks real . But auctioning on eBay is risky . 
 Then you haven't browsed eBay before ... get online . Don't hang up ! 
 I'd swear that's Eddy from circulation . 
 Not very long from the looks of it ! 
 He's dancing with Jack ! 
 The wei-ya is the one time a year you can make fun of the boss . 
 You're right . They are spinning pretty fast . Aren't they getting dizzy ? What if they fall ... 
 How embarrassing ! 
 Q-Duck ? Do you mean the famous roast-duck store ? 
 They have moved to some other places long time ago . 
 Yeah , a lot of changes have happened here . 
 Yeah , they are my wife's heaven , but not mine . I always get lost in the supermarket . 
 Is that better now ? 
 Tell me a little bit about yourself , please . 
 What kind of jobs have you had ? 
 Would you like to tell me something about your outstanding achievements ? 
 What special skills do you have , can you tell me ? 
 I know in your resume that you have worked in your present company for 3 years . Can you tell me why you want to leave your present job and join us ? 
 Well , I think our interview is complete then . We will give you a call in ten days or so . 
 What's our target audience for this campaign ? 
 Do you think that's much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for ? 
 Right , that makes sense . What's the average age ? 
 Does bullfight interest you much ? 
 So I ’ Ve got two tickets to the latest show but I need a little favor from you . 
 How did Jim get the money ? 
 He must be mad ! Nick is a loan shark . 
 What would you be doing in U . S . A ? 
 What do you want to see particularly ? 
 Have you ever shopped online ? 
 Do you have some experiences to share with me ? I want to have a try . 
 What about the registration procedure ? Is that complicated ? 
 It is so nice of you . 
 I didn ’ t see anything out of the ordinary , but I want you to log onto our website for a printout of all of the details . 
 If there were any major problems , I would always notify you by phone to come in . 
 A description of each test is given on the site . 
 The website will give you a normal range and then tell you what your results are . 
 Your entire test history is on the site . You can compare your results from other years . 
 That of the old man . 
 Some of the scenes moved me into tears . 
 I see . Will you walk this way , please ? What experience have you had ? 
 Have you got any selling experience at all ? 
 Now tell me about your educational background . 
 What courses have you completed ? 
 What subjects did you like most at university ? 
 Why would you like to work with us ? 
 What are your future plans and what kind of expectations do you have of the company ? 
 Good . Do you know anything about this company ? 
 Have you got anything to ask me ? 
 Yes . 
 Three times a year at most . How do you feel about this ? 
 It ’ s over . 
 Our relationship . I mean my friend and I ... 
 The cause is another boy . 
 Did you have a good weekend ? 
 Oh I see . So what did you do then ? 
 Ahh . And how about on Sunday ? Did you watch the football ? 
 Hello , Fred . What are you doing ? 
 Can you tell me the concept of e-commerce ? Now , many people mentioned the word , ' e-commerce ' , in front of me . 
 What kinds of channels can you use in e-commerce ? 
 What are the benefits of e-commerce ? 
 How things have changed now ! 
 What time do you want the call ? 
 We can certainly do that . Expect a call from us at 7 o'colock and then again at 7 fifteen . 
 I can certainly do that . Is there anything else ? 
 Okay . Good night , sir . 
 Not much . Joann . Do you want to hang out ? 
 Me , too . What would you like to do ? 
 I have , actually . How about the movie , Million Dollar Baby with Clint Eastwood ? 
 We could , but it looks like it ’ s going to rain soon . 
 I ’ d really rather not . I ’ ll be too tempted to buy something that I can ’ t afford ! 
 I don ’ t know . Do you want to go bowling at the new bowling alley on 1st street ? 
 Let ’ s see . Do you want to go to a bar and sing some karaoke ? 
 Doesn ’ t sound like that ’ s be fun , then . Do you want to come here ? 
 Goodness , we ’ re not having much luck here , are we ? 
 No , but I could take the bus . 
 That sounds great ! Have you eaten ? 
 Perfect . Are you prepared to give me all your money ? 
 Oh , right . I suppose so . As long as you promise to lose ! 
 See you soon . 
 Excuse me ... 
 I would like to return this item ... Are refunds allowed ?

 No . I would rather just return it . 
 Yeah , right here . 
 No , thank you . 
 Good morning . Can I help you ?

 What kind of juice would you like , sir ? 
 Yes , sir . I'll get them for you right away . Would you please sign this bill first ? Thank you , sir . 
 I want to get a package of cigarette . 
 No , this kind of cigarette is too strong for me , I desire a mild one . 
 It suits my taste , I'll take it . Do you have lighters ? 
 Show me the one made of plastic . 
 Thank you . 
 No , I'm not . I am interested in some scarves . 
 Hm , It looks nice , but I ’ d like to have something warm for the winter . 
 I think that's what I want . How much is it ? 
 It's a little expensive . Do you think it's possible to get a discount ? 
 That's good . Could you wrap it for me ? 
 No , that should be it . Thank you ! 
 Come in , please . 
 In 3 months or so . 
 Did I ? Well , anyway , you will get your raise when the economy starts picking up . 
 Yes . 
 Nah , don't be so fast . We like your work here , but this company is on hard times and I can't be handing out raises for anyone . 
 I hear what you're saying , and I wish there were something I could do . 
 What do you think of the novel you just finished reading ? 
 What do you like best about it ? 
 What do you think of the ending ? 
 What does this have to do with me ? 
 Order tea . Isn't that what you like to drink ? 
 If you want to be macho , order a double shot of espresso . 
 Do you have any seats available ? 
 What's the special today ? 
 Then give me a large one and an egg drop soup . 
 ... So what I think we need to do is ( XXXXXXXXXX ) finish on time . 
 Oh , OK , I said ( XXXXXXXXXX ) on time . 
 ( XXXXXXXXXX ) 
 ( XXXXXXXXXX ) but I don ’ t think you can hear us . ( XXXXXXXXXX ) Hello ? ( XXXXXXXXXX ) 
 ( XXXXXXXXXX ) OK ( XXXXXXXXXX ) . 
 It's a boy . 
 Hello , this is Miao Eng calling from Lincoln Bank . 
 No , not at all . I was just calling to tell you that everything has been checked and double checked , and there is no problem with the documents you brought in this morning . 
 Shall I go ahead and process them for you ? 
 Would you like to have some icecream ? I've got a variety of flavors for you to choose from . I've got strawberry , peach , chocolate , coffee , vanilla and praline . 
 Come on , just a bite . It doesn't really hurt to have just a bite . 
 Gee ! You are really strong-willed . 
 Well , I'd better not tempt you . Otherwise , if I give you a piece of cake , you might ask for a glass of milk . 
 Yes . I'd like to borrow these books . 
 Thanks . 
 What happens if I'm not finished with them in a month ? 
 OK.Thank you very much for your trouble . 
 I found it at a garage sale once . 
 Well , because I like you ... ninety bucks . 
 Sixty bucks ? No-can-do , son . You'll be lucky if I go down to eighty-five . 
 What does it cost to ride this bus ? 
 Have you been driving buses a long time ? 
 Do you like to drive the bus ? 
 I would have never dreamed of ever becoming a bus driver . 
 It was really fun chatting with you . 
 Have a good one . 
 Look at the cloud . 
 Let's go quickly . 
 Come in , please . 
 Yes . The television is not working properly . 
 The remote control doesn't work . I turned on the television , but I can't change the channel . 
 That's great . 
 No , thanks . 
 OK . Thank you . 
 Where'd the rest of your money for the bus go ? 
 Well , that was an intelligent thing to do . 
 No , I don't . 
 You should just ask the bus driver for a transfer . 
 It's free ; just go ask for one . 
 No problem , just go ask . 
 Not bad . Thank you . You look great today . And how is your husband ? 
 Well , I'm glad to hear that . Please give my regards to him . 
 I wish I had access to the public library . 
 Mary , how was your date with john ? 
 oh , really . That is great news . What does he look like ? 
 sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ? 
 Are you leaving ? 
 You have a job ? 
 You ’ re working there this year ? 
 How are you able to work at the polling place ? 
 Sounds like fun . 
 They don ’ t pay a lot , do they ? 
 Nurse , I am sure to die soon . They just don't tell me the truth , I know . 
 Is what you said really true ? 
 Thank you . 
 We have a beautiful natural park . 
 Come on.Let ' s walk there . 
 Yes , I know a great place . What types of food do you like ? 
 Oh , I know a place where you might like to eat . 
 It's down a block on the right ; can I show you the way ? 
 This will work out well . I'm getting hungry just thinking about it . 
 Yes . By the way , you are having a great make-up today . I like the color of your lipstick . So adorable ! 
 Well , girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things . Actually , do we still have a meeting this afternoon ? 
 How do you like your job here , Linda ? 
 Why ? 
 I'm happy to hear that , but publishing is more than just talking to writers . it involves a lot of work , patience and responsibility . Most of the work is boring . 
 Do you have any complaints ? 
 Yes , you have many opportunities to grow in this company as long as you do well . 
 Does the material stand washing ? 
 Is it drip-dry ? 
 Why , Tom ? It's five to six already and you are still writing here . 
 Yes , have you forgotten ? We have arranged to go to Mary's to watch some videos tonight . 
 What's the matter with you ? You are the one that persuaded all of us to go there . 
 Hello , is that 2896919 16 ? 
 Can you book me a room with a bath for August 28 ? 
 Which season do you like best ? 
 I like autumn , too . Where I'm from , Autumn is the best time of year . 
 It's no problem . I was really missing you anyway . 
 Why haven't you tried to come see me then ? 
 Doing what ? 
 I would've come to see you sooner , but I've been busy too . 
 I've been working too . 
 I am too . 
 Yeah . Sometimes I just cannot accept his behavior . 
 OK , it ’ s better to be far away from him . 
 What is it ? 
 Okay . 
 How late can we stay out ? 
 But if we're going to be late ? 
 we really were lucky . We got the last available table for two---and we didn't even have a reservation ! Did you see the long lines behind us ? 
 let's take a look at the menu so we can order . Do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ? 
 I heard that one of their specialities is the samosa . 
 sounds good . What are you going to have for your main course ? 
 what's in a dahl ? 
 that sounds nice . Do you want to share some kebabs as well ? 
 that's my favourite . Do you want to have some wine or beer ? 
 ok , shall I flag down the waitress ? 
 you're right . That might seem a bit rude . It's a good thing I've got you with me ! 
 Here ! Here ! Use my card ! 
 Not on my life ! I'm the best man , so I pay ! 
 What's that ? 
 You've got it ! But are we coming back for the music , or for the fruit ? ! 
 That cup is for a urine sample . 
 This particular test calls for you to urinate into the cup after you have urinated a little into the toilet . 
 You need to leave the cup in the cubby in the restroom , and the lab tech will get it from the other side . 
 If there are bacteria in your urine , it could mean an infection somewhere . 
 Your doctor will be contacting you with the results . 
 Of course . What kind of postal savings account do you want to open ? 
 OK . We offer a few different kinds of postal saving services . They have different interest rates . 
 That would be our Savers Plus account . You must pay 10 000 yuan into your deposit account . In this way you can get 5 % dividend at the end of the year . 
 Just fill out these forms , and I ’ ll be with you in one second . 
 What's your favourite steps ? 
 How about rumba ? 
 Really ? You must like tango , right ? 
 Don't be so modest . I'm sure you can dance it very well . Let's dance it now . 
 Oh , you dance it so well . 
 I think I'm your lucky fellow . 
 I ’ m afraid this seat is taken . 
 You ’ re welcome . Why don ’ t you ask the conductor when he comes by ? 
 Look , George , There's the Great Wall . 
 Yeah , it stretches over for thousands of miles . 
 Where can we climb it ? 
 Well , we could take the cable car . 
 Okay . Let's go . 
 But we made it . 
 It was first built about twenty-five hundred years ago . 
 There are so many ancient relics in China . 
 Of course . 
 Do you take dressing on your salad ? 
 Now I know why I split up with Mike . We found we were simply not good for each other . 
 Well , he is a typical Sagittarius guy , while I am a Cancer . We aren't really compatible 
 What's strange about that ! As a person born under the sign of Cancer , I am home-loving and wish for a peaceful family life . But according to astrology , Sagittarius guys are too adventurous and risk-taking.They seldom think of leading a settled and peaceful life . 
 But in my case , the fact matches the theory . Mike is humorous , energetic , always as fresh as a daisy , but probably too ambitious . It frightens me ! 
 Exactly . But later on , he cares more about his career than love . Work seems to be the better all , and all for him-so much that he doesn't even grudge sparing a day out with me . 
 What is your problem ? 
 You need not always do that . Why don ’ t you pat them on the back occasionally ? 
 Yes . This is Mr . Wang in Room 1305 . Please send up a boy to help me with my luggage . 
 Well , two big suitcases and two small bags . 
 Do you mind if we call on you this evening ? 
 How about seven o'clock ? 
 Have you seen the news that there is a serious flood in the South ? 
 What a pity ! I know you've been longing for it these months . 
 Hi . I want to get something nice for my niece . 
 I like that suggestion . Show me one , please . 
 Oh , my niece will love her ! How much for her ? 
 That's great . I'll take her . 
 Thank you , but no . This will do it for now . 
 I'll pay cash , thank you . 
 what are your strong points ? 
 what kind of people do you like to work with ? 
 what ’ s your greatest strength ? 
 so , you ’ re smart . 
 what do you consider your weakness ? 
 that ’ s not a problem . It ’ s unnecessary for this position . 
 Well , why don ’ t you use a local SIM card ? 
 Yes . Just go to the convenience store and ask for a SIM card . Then insert it into your phone . 
 Well it ’ s 100 RIB for the SIM card then it will cost you about 10 RIB per minute to call the UK . 
 Excuse me , I have something to trouble you . 
 An hour ago , I bought this vase with my tourist . 
 I'm afraid so . We found this crack on the bottom when I went back to my hotel . 
 Oh , It's quite all right , I suppose . It can't be helped sometimes . 
 All right . Thank you . 
 Oh , yes , it is . I'll take this one . 
 Well , there's no reason to apologize for such a trifle thing . 
 You are in the right place . Roll up your left sleeve and have a seat . 
 Your doctor wants to know what your white blood cell count is . 
 Usually if your white count is off , the doctor suspects an infection . 
 It is only a pin prick . I have to put this tourniquet on your arm to make the vein easier to find . 
 That blood that just filled the tube is all that I needed . Thanks for coming in !

 I'll pick a shampoo that's just right for your hair type . Sit right here , and rest your neck on the side of the sink . Is the water too hot ? 
 Let me know if I'm using too much force . 
 OK ! You're all set ! Come back with me to your seat , and Eva will be right with you . 
 Hi , Jason . It ’ s Elizabeth Montgomery . Have you got those plans drawn up yet ? 
 Thanks a lot . Sorry to trouble you . 
 Sure . I have it right here . 232-2453 . If that one doesn ’ t work , try 232-2456 . 
 That ’ s right . 
 The reason is that he once was bitten by a dog . 
 Where are you going to spend your holidays this year , Tom ? 
 Will you travel by sea or by air ? 
 I'm sure you'll enjoy yourselves . 
 Here you go . I made up the burger patties for you . 
 I'll take over for a while to give you a break . 
 Then I'll tell folks the food's ready . Come and get it ! I've always wanted to say that ! 
 That's disgusting . 
 I ’ m afraid we ’ re in for a rough weekend , Mary . There is a storm system moving through the East Coast . It will be drizzling all day today , and there ’ s a 60 percent chance of thunderstorms this eve 
 Unfortunately , yes . It will be clear early Saturday morning but there is a high chance of showers and thunderstorms later in the day . There is a severe thunderstorm warning for some parts of the Sout 
 It gets better on Sunday , though . The storm systems move east and the skies will clear up at night . It will still be rather cool , with highs in the low 50s . The West Coast will be experiencing some

 Thank you . I ’ ll put the call through for you . Hold on the line , please . 
 Just a minute , please . It's in my bag . Here it is . 
 All right . Shall I enter all my belongings ? 
 My sister was taken to the hospital yesterday 
 She was hit by a car . Luckily , she wasn't seriously hurt . 
 We'll have to hurry ; visiting hours will be over soon 
 I was wondering if I could collect unemployment benefits . 
 I am still working for now , but I might get laid off . 
 Does everyone who gets laid off get to collect unemployment ? 
 How can I find out if I can collect ? 
 How will I know how much I can collect on unemployment ? 
 I heard you are going to move . 
 What are you worried about ? 
 You can call a mover . 
 Around 200 RIB for a truck . 
 But think about it , you just need to pack your stuff and leave everything for the movers , how much trouble you will save . 
 I know a mover which has a very good reputation for their service . I ’ ll leave you their phone number . 
 It ’ s 8357688 8 . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Well , the state will benefit a lot , I suppose . 
 Ah , it ’ s hard to say . 
 Hello , Becky . Well , you see , I have this thing here , called a Fixed Deposit Certificate , and I've just noticed the date on it . 
 I think I'll redeem , if that's not a problem . 
 Anything you like , but not too many large notes . It's useful to have smaller notes . 
 Yes , yes . Everything's fine . Thank you very much , Becky . 
 Hi , I saw the sign outside says that you do all kinds of interior design . 
 Well , I am thinking about redesigning my kitchen . 
 Yes , I prefer a more contemporary design . 
 Blue , green or earth tone colors . I do not like the colors that are too bright . 
 I'd like it to look simple , neat and relaxing . 
 No problem . How about 10 ' o clock this Sunday morning ? 
 Of course . This is my card . See you then . 
 So do I ! 
 No , it's too expensive for me . I've decided to take some exercises on my own . 
 Run around the track . In the morning I run for an hour , and in the afternoon I run around the building . 
 I hope so . Would you like to join me ? 
 Is everything to your satisfaction ? 
 Oh ! Sorry to hear that . This is quite unusual as we have steak from the market every day . 
 I'm sorry , sir . Do you wish to try something else ? That would be on the house , of course . 
 Help ! Help !

 Ii is distinguished for the strength of law and foreign languages studies .. 
 We have hundreds of constituencies and the voters in each one elect a member of parliament . Most people call them mp ’ s . 
 Almost all of them do . A few are independent . That means that they do not belong to a party . If one party more than half of the mp ’ s . they form a government . That means that they choose a prime Finist 
 This is a small group of people-perhaps 25 mp ’ s who are usually ministers . They make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy . 
 Any mp can present a law to parliament . The proposed law is debated and voted on . If it is accepted , it becomes law . 
 Yes , it does , because they have most of the mp ’ s . most mp ’ s vote the way their party wants them to . 
 They produce manifesto . These documents which states their policies . Some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . Voters who often change the party they vote for are Calle 
 Fine , thank you , sir . It ’ s nice to see you again . 
 Very well , thank you , Mr . Parker . 
 What do you think is wrong , the math or the way your answer was scored ? 
 I am willing to take a second look because teachers make mistakes , too . Will that work for you ? 
 Check your answers against the ones on the answer sheet and let me know where you see the mistake . 
 Yes , I agree ; let's move on to the calculating of the score . Would that be OK ? 
 We add all of these up and divide by this and that gives us this percentage .

 Weigh ? It must be a greatest Chinese invention . I've tried hard to learn it . Its rules can't be any simpler , but I've never won a game of Go . Well , it's all Greek to me ! 
 I heard it is included in the four major arts of China , is it ? 
 I know it is quite different from Western chess . 
 But isn't it the same with wiki ? 
 May I come in ? 
 How are you doing , Madam ? My name is During . I am coming to your company for an interview as requested . 
 Nice to see you , Mrs . Smith . 
 Did you move into your new apartment ? 
 Don ’ t worry . It ’ ll probably take you about three weeks to get everything organized . 
 Have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ? 
 What do you mean by that ? 
 Yes , but you only pay 800 dollars a month . Emm , it ’ s hard to decide which is better , shorter commuting time or lower rent . 
 Is there a supermarket nearby ? 
 Sounds like you better buy a bicycle . 
 Merry Christmas , Mr . Wang . I would like to give you the book I specially chose as my appreciation for your sincere help to me in the past few days . 
 I hope it will be of some use to you . 
 That will be great . 
 No.May I help you ? 
 Oh , that's where I'm going . 
 Yes , I am , and I am so excited . 
 I love my candidate . 
 My candidate is probably the most intelligent . 
 I also agree with all his policies . 
 I know he ’ s going to be the next President . 
 I can ’ t wait to vote . 
 Yes . One more is needed . 
 But do you have any experience like that ? 
 OK.Then I want to ask you some questions about the tourist guide.If there wasn accident , for example a tourist falls ill , what would you do ? 
 If one of them forgot a camera in a restaurant , would you let the tourist bus go back ? 
 Well , it seems that you have all the practical experience to handle these cases . I am very glad to welcome you into our company . 
 Did you hear what happened to Mike in Accounts ? 
 He got arrested on Friday night and spent the night in jail . 
 Well , it was all a big mistake , actually . He got home on Friday night really late , and apparently he'd been out drinking with some clients , so he was really drunk . 
 Yes , I think so . 
 Well , anyway , he'd somehow lost his wallet and his house keys , so he couldn't get in . He lives alone , you know . 
 No , she left him last year . 
 Hang on , let me finish telling you what happened . Where was I ? 
 Oh yes , well , he tried to climb in through the bathroom window , but apparently he slipped and broke the glass with his foot . The neighbors heard him and thought a robbery was in progress , so they called the police . 
 Yes . So when the cops arrived , they didn't believe his story 
 Well , when he sobered up , he called someone from work to come and bail him out . 
 Yes , I know . 
 Oh , thank you ! It's very kind of you . Ah , it is a porcelain vase . 
 Yes , it is lovely . I have been expecting something like this for a long time . Thanks ever so much . 
 OK , Devon , I've been putting on a few pounds and you're quite a lean fit guy . 
 What do you recommend ? What can I do to lose weight ? 
 Yeah , well , actually , one of the problems is that I actually exercise a lot . 
 Yeah , so maybe it's my diet . 
 That's pretty tough ! 
 Good morning . This is Dan . Could I speak to Nova ? 
 Really ? When will she come back ? 
 Well , the reason why I am calling is to tell her that our appointment in next month will have to be postponed . And the exact time for this meeting will be discussed after she comes back . 
 The file for the meeting needs to be retyped and please send it to us as soon as possible . 
 Can I take your drink order ? 
 The wine choices are posted on the little menu in the middle of the table . 
 We can make a number of mixed drinks at our bar . 
 Our house special is our Cuervo Gold margarita . 
 Can I prepare your drink on the rocks , or would you prefer it blended ? 
 Do you like your margarita with salt or no salt ? 
 Do you like ethnic food ? 
 Really ? Have you ever tried Moroccan ? 
 I don't know . A friend of mine said I should try it . 
 As a matter of fact , he gave me this address . 
 Oh , Linda , you must be so excited about going to study in America . 
 Well , I'm sure you will . 
 What's the matter 
 Maria sings like a lark , doesn't she ? 
 Maybe she'll make a famous singer in the future .

 I finished it all .

 So click here , then up to the top . 
 Then open that window . Yeah , that one . 
 And that's it . You're done . 
 What's all the security check about , Jimmy ? Does it mean the bar may be a dangerous place ? 
 I don't know . Maybe the same . Actually , this is my first time being in a bar . 
 Sure . I love this place , especially the decoration . So tasteful ! 
 Here it is . But , what for ? We're already in . 
 Yes , orange juice will be fine for me . But how can you get the drink ? It's so crowded there around the counter . You can barely move . 
 Cool . Thanks . ( Jimmy brings May a glass of orange juice . ) 
 Not everyone . But a lot of people do , especially the young . It's a fine place to spend an evening with friends or to make some new friends . 
 Yeah , a dancing queen . Wanna go and join them ? 
 OK . Let me help you to hold the drink . 
 Who's better at chess , Bill or Fred ? 
 You said it .

 You saved my life yesterday , Rachel . I can't believe I forgot to bring my wallet when we went to lunch with those clients . 
 Let me buy you lunch today to pay you back .

 I think it is amazing . You can enjoy both the traditional Chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city . The only thing I didn't enjoy was the subway . 
 yes . There were always so many people . After taking the subway during the rush hour , you ’ ll envy sardines in their cans . 
 that's a good idea . Wish you a great vacation ! 
 So , how'd everyone do ? 
 Your vintage clock ? ! I just paid sixty-five dollars for it . 
 It must be my special touch . I think bargaining is in my blood ! 
 David , what's new with you ? You are not in the mood . Can you tell me ? 
 Do not take things so seriously , my pal ! Every one of us will face the trouble and job-hunting is inevitable . Take it easy ! Believe in yourself and some day you will be successful . 
 Guess who I saw yesterday ? 
 Avril Lavigen ! 
 yeah , I worked as temporary staff in her concert . Look , her poster , a CD ... 
 not really . But I like some of her songs . She's actually very talented . She's a song writer and fashion and fashion designer , too . 
 yes , though I don't think her acting skills are that great . 
 she looked sweeter than her pictures . 
 no , there were too many people . When she got out of the car , her fans were all screaming , trying to give her flowers and ger her autographs . 
 Hello , Steven . Can you do me a favor ? 
 My car has broken down . 
 I have done it . But now I have an urgent appointment to keep . Could you drive me to the subway station ? 
 Thanks a lot ! 
 Three . 
 I am in charge of the trading department . I'm handling invoices , shipping bills and computing freight costs , that's most of the documentation . 
 I must be there no later than 9:00 . 
 I quit work whenever I get finished , usually about six o'clock . 
 No , the secretary does this . It's not part of my job . 
 I am working in a small company where further promotion is impossible , so I decided to change my job . I'd like to find a job which is more challenging . 
 I'll be right back . I just need to mail this package . 
 Would you like me to leave the samples with you ? 
 Fine , Mr . Grant . Thanks for your time . I ’ ll talk to you next week . 
 Yes , sir ? 
 I can understand that . Let me see if I can clarify some things for you . 
 Really ? There aren't many left now . 
 Were there any animals in the forest ? 
 Put on the helmet , please . 
 You ’ d better , to protect your clothes . Now please watch your step . 
 Well , not fully automated . 
 All products have to go through five checks in the whole manufacturing process . 
 One thousand units per month now . But we ’ ll be making 1,200 units beginning with October . 
 About 2 % in normal operations . 
 Yes . Shall we take a break now ? 
 Well , yes , I ’ d like to , if it ’ s not too much trouble . 
 That ’ d be fine . 
 Well , I'm afraid we've had a slight delay . 
 The cement arrived late but don't worry , I'm confident we can still meet the deadline . The crew is on stand-by and as soon as the concrete has set we can get started again . 
 You married Joe , didn't you ? 
 I remember you are in love . 
 It's Greek to me . 
 Our reservation is under the name of Foster at 7:00 for four people . 
 We would like to begin with a cocktail while we are waiting . Would you tell the hostess to please come and let us know when our table is ready ? 
 The patio tables look really nice . Could we be seated there , please ? 
 Thanks ! We'll sit out there then . We will just order our drinks out there . 
 Yes , why don't you bring us a bottle of the house Chablis with four glasses to start with ? 
 We appreciate your help . 
 Will you please copy these diplomas tor me ? 
 15 copies for each diploma . 
 Fine . Do you want your windshield cleaned ? 
 It comes to $ 15 . 
 I've been feeling pretty ill for a few days now . 
 I feel chilly , I've got cramps , I keep throwing up , and I feel dizzy and tired . 
 yes . I can't seem to drink enough . 
 no , just soda . 
 that seems to be a bit low , but that's not uncommon when you're ill . 
 no , but my girlfriend has mono . 
 thanks . 
 My watch is a few minutes fast . It's about six forty , I think . 
 If we start now , we can make it by taxi . 
 She is my dog . I like her very much . 
 Her name is Fluffy . She is a sweet dog . 
 But I don ’ t like big strong dogs . 
 Oh , yes , it is . Thank you . I was looking for it just now . 
 Have you ? 
 Just two blocks away , in that tall building . 
 My family move in just two weeks ago . We live on the fourth floor . 
 I ’ m Chen Ming . 
 I ’ m glad to meet you , Mr . Song . 
 No , I ’ m going to the airport to meet some friends from Beijing . 
 Yes ? What can I do for you ? 
 And what is the problem ? 
 Let me see ... I'm sorry , but we don't have any more non-smoking rooms.We won't charge you for your room tonight . 
 I'm very sorry about this . 
 Can I go to my room , now ? 
 Thank you , sir . 
 Hello , Jack.Happy birthday ! 
 I'd like to offer you my congratulations on your birthday and best wishes for your future happiness , good health and continued success . I've asked the Fairy Flowers to send you a bunch of flowers . I hope you'll like them . 
 Now let me sing " Happy birthday " for you . 
 Are you planning on voting ? 
 Yes , but this will be my first time voting . 
 Yes , and I have no idea how to do it . 
 I don ’ t know any of the laws they ’ re trying to pass . 
 I didn ’ t know that . 
 That ’ s good to know . 
 You look tired . Did you sleep well last night ? 
 Go easy . Overwork is bad for your health . 
 By all means . 
 You're welcome . 
 Gee ! You scared me ! 
 Yes , Ma'am . No magazines during the office hours . I'm sorry . 
 It is about sports for white-collar workers , people like you and me . 
 Aerobic sports , for example , jogging , yoga , skating ... 
 Stretching exercise after sitting a long time . 
 Can I have my magazine back now ? 
 Hello , Sir . Can I help you with anything ? 
 No problem at all . With this service , you can pay up to 10 parties at one time . Are these parties on your current beneficiaries list ? 
 Select ' pay multiple beneficiaries ' , here ... then select ' pay from the account ' in the drop down menu ... OK , good . Then we need to enter the beneficiary statement reference . 
 And your statement reference and the payment amount . Click on next , then ' pay beneficiaries ' . That's it ! All done . 
 OK , sir . How do you like your meal ? 
 I'm glad you like it . It's $ 60 in all . 
 Helen , did you hear I ’ m having a party ? Next Saturday in my place . 
 Well , drop by if you can . 
 No , just bring yourself . I hope to see you there . 
 Yes , but you can't get there with out a change . 
 You have to get off at the hospital and change for bus 15 . 
 Good morning Mr Smith . My name is Susan and I am a reporter for the Evening Star . 
 I was hoping to talk to you today about your business . 
 How long have you been the owner of your computer shop ? 
 And how many staff do you employ ? 
 So this is a family business . 
 And how many computers do you sell each day ? 
 That about one hundred a month . 
 Thank you B for your time . 
 Does your country export a lot of natural resources ? 
 Which resources do you have to import ? 
 I heard that you country recently discovered deposits of precious stone . 
 If your government invests in your country ’ s infrastructure , it will be money well spent . 
 Rachel ? I ’ m not sure how you want to handle this account . I think there are a few things to be sorted out . 
 That ’ s true . But even beyond that , there ’ s the question of meeting the deadlines they ’ Ve set . 
 Your teacher has left you not very much homework this weekend . 
 My advice would be to finish it at once . 
 I'm very busy these days . It seems I can never finish my work . 
 I'll try . I'm under a lot of pressure right now . 
 I can't . I am really behind of my work . 
 I ’ m not sure where to pick up my ballot . 
 How are you going to help me ? 
 Fabulous . Thanks . 
 I have it right here . 
 Now what am I supposed to do ? 
 Sounds good . Thanks . 
 Yes . An passport and a visa are necessary for entry into China . 
 They should fill in an application form , hand in the copies of Identification Card and household register . 
 What is it ? What happened ? 
 No , it can't be . Really ? Who ? 
 What did you do ? 
 Did he leave when you left ? 
 What did you do ? 
 I can believe it , and I am very excited about it . 
 Of course I did . Didn ’ t you ? 
 I have total faith in Obama as our President . 
 Yeah . I have faith that he will help America turn over a new leaf . 
 I believe that change has already begun . 
 I no longer need to worry about what will happen with this country . 
 Don ’ t put me on the spot . You know , I can ’ t do that . 
 Yes , it's much better than yesterday . 
 Oh , let's just hope it stays warm . 
 You ? You are full of hot air . 
 No . 
 It involves a lot of travel . 
 It still feels really strange to me . 
 How does it feel to be in charge of so much money ? 
 I guess you could choose that if you wanted . 
 Dad really knew what he was doing when he chose you to take over for him when he was gone ! 
 That's why he's very popular among girls . 
 You are ! 
 Sure , what I can do for you ? 
 You can just put Dear Sir or Madam , officialese not personal , you can write to whom may concerned . 
 Good ! But also , write off the bed you want to tell them the reason of your writing , give them more reference . 
 Right , do you need them to respond ? 
 You can tell them " Please finding the enclosed customer service survey , else also , you can say Attach a customer survey . If you need resource it right away , you can tell them the urgent by saying Please return the survey without dely as soon as possible . Maye it more polite with this as early as convenience . 
 By all means . 
 Yeah , but we still need RIB 500,000 . Maybe we can use some of our savings to pay part of it . 
 Great , so we can afford the new apartment after all ! 
 What are your thoughts on the apartment ? 
 There aren ’ t any problems with the apartment ? 
 What problems ? 
 We will have the carpet cleaned before you move in . 
 Yes , but other than that , are there any more problems ? 
 I ’ m happy that you find this apartment so appealing . 
 I have been looking at this online catalog for over an hour and I still haven ’ t finished getting all the kitchen appliances that we need ! 
 Well , the first thing on my list is a new blender . I decided to also get a juicer and a new coffee maker . 
 Yeah I know . I also decided to throw away the old toaster and get a new one . I am also getting a rice cooker and steamer to make some nice steamed fish or veggies . 
 That ’ s a good idea ! The kitchen will look amazing ! 
 You can be sure of that , sir . 
 Oh . Have you finished listing your study preferences ? 
 Good . So , which is your top choice ? 
 I see . Which subject did you put last then ? 
 That's interesting . Could you give any reasons for your choice ? Can you explainwhy do you put medicine first ? 
 Yes . I suppose so . 
 Then what about you , Miss ? 
 The vegetarian dishes are at the last pages of the menu . 
 What kind of movies do you like , Sue ? 
 Just like my wife . So , what ’ s your favorite movie ? 
 Yeah , my wife likes that one , too . Personally , I prefer action movies . 
 I don't think you really want to hear about it . 
 To be honest , it was horrible ! My manager is such a pain in the neck ! 
 Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me ! 
 There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired me for sure . 
 He treats everyone pretty badly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake ! 
 I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair ! 
 Not really . I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion . 
 I try to be sensible about it , but it's not very easy . Sometimes you just have to grin and bear it . 
 Did you need help ? 
 I ’ ll help you with that . 
 I ’ m working here today . 
 Can I see your ID , please ? 
 I have your ballot card right here . 
 All you have to do now is vote . 
 Royal Hotel , can I help you ? 
 Yes , we have . What kind of room would you like ? 
 No problem , sir . 
 It is $ 200 per night . 
 Yes , but the offer ended yesterday . I'm sorry . 
 No , sir . So far it is the least expensive suite for tomorrow night . 
 Yes , it does . Now could I have your name , please ? 
 Would you kindly spell it for me ? 
 Thank you , I got it . And how long do you expect to stay ? 
 OK . Our check-in time is after 12:00 . And see you tomorrow . 
 You're right . Watching movies at home is way cheaper than going to the theater , too . I like downloading movies too because it's easy and fast . 
 Have you ever heard of a movie rental company called Netflix ? They send the movies directly to your house in the mail . 
 Yeah , but I wish they delivered video games too . Then I would never leave my house ! 
 Thanks ! These are beautiful . You shouldn ’ t have ! 
 I forgot what I put up with in that case . I do deserve these flowers . 
 All right , but tell me what ’ s happening . Give it to me straight please . 
 And now ? 
 That ’ s great news . 
 That ’ s good to hear . She is usually full of vein and vigor . 
 Thanks for helping her , doctor . 
 Thanks . I will . 
 What's up , Bro ? What's in the bulletin ? 
 Blackout ? Even the TV has the limit . 
 Oops , no , Daddy can't watch American Idol , either ! 
 Oh , my god ! No air-conditioner ! 
 How about playing Barbie out there in the neighborhood ? 
 Do you have a better plan ? 
 What do you think about violence in movies ? 
 But kids like watching things like that . It's just for fun , would't you say ? 
 I heard that you finished my home inspection , and I was wondering how it went . 
 I am not sure what a home inspection is all about . 
 Wouldn ’ t the owners have told me about any problems ? 
 Can I require the owners to fix the problems ? 
 What did you find out when you did the inspection of my new home ? 
 I feel that Bob ’ s father-in-law is a hard nut to crack . 
 But his daughter is a very nice girl . 
 You should do one of the two things - either to lodge a claim with the shipowner or with the insurance company . 
 Yes . They usually do it . 
 Of course . In Europe , they charge a commission of 1 % of the amount of the claim for their service . 
 They do the work without charge to the importer . 
 Exactly . 
 No , you must also obtain a statement from the shipping agent certifying that the goods were actually loaded on their vessel for shipment . 
 You must provide full original set of ocean bills of lading original insurance policy or certificate and the original commercia invoice . 
 You are welcome . 
 You ’ re right . 
 I should have turned it off . I ’ ll turn it off now . 
 I ’ m sorry , Jim . 
 Hi . Can I help you , sir ? 
 We posted several positions . Which position are you looking for ? 
 Yes . Applications will be accepted for this position until next Friday . 
 If you ’ re interested in this position , please send me your resume . 
 Sure . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Thank you , Bob ! This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many , a series of unprecedented meteorological events occurred around the world . In Switzerland , a major avalanche was reported in the Alps . Fortunately , no one was injured . Due to to the extreme cold this winter , a blizzard has struck the US Midwest , causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled . Moving to to Latin American , Ecuador has suffered a six month drought that has not only affected farming , but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides electricity for the entire country . In Chile , a major earthquake that registered seven point five on the Richter scale struck the southern region . Losses are reported to be in the billions . Authorities have not yet released an official statement . 
 I ’ m afraid not , Bob . One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted , causing major floods and landslides in the region . Meanwhile , Mexico ’ s coast has been hit by hurricane Liliana and officials say that all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami may hit Central America , affecting Honduras , Guatemala and Panama . That ’ s all the news we have for today , but stay tuned for updates on the six o ’ clock news . Back to you Bob . 
 Sure . Thank you for saying that . Actually , those songs were sung for the first time today . I wrote them in the past two months . 
 You can say that . But my band and I also sing regularly in several other places , too . 
 I picked up guitar at an early age , maybe around 8 years old . Afterward , I taught myself by listening to some records of top players . 
 What does your sister look like , Mike ? 
 Is she like you ? 
 Is she as clever as you ? 
 Big head ! 
 It's 800 US dollars per kilo CIF five percent Hamburg . 
 Why ? This is a fair market price . 
 Then what leads you to think that we have to reduce our price ? Please tell me candidly . 
 We give you quotations on the same basis as we quote in the domestic market . 
 But even with the overhead out , the export overhead must be put in . Finally , it comes to the same thing . Anyway , this is a quality item and should be sold on its value . 
 You look depressed . What's on your mind ? 
 Take it easy . When we last talked , you promised there would be more exercises in your life . But now you are putting on some weight . 
 Well , I think it's time for you to change your eating habits and develop a healthy lifestyle . Regular exercise will improve your health . 
 You can do some jogging . It's easy and it doesn't take much time . 
 Hello , is that the Peace Restaurant ? 
 Yes . I'd like a table for six at 7:00 this evening . Can you arrange it for us ? 
 Let me see . It seems a little late . 
 OK . I'll change the time to 8: 00 . 
 It's John . 
 i saw lily for the first time . and fell like i'v been struck by lightening.she is a girl of my dreams . i have a date with her on Friday , but i really can't decide what to do . 
 not bad , any other ideas ? 
 good idea . that ' s why i think i have culture . you have any other suggestions ? 
 They are good , but i still need a few more . 
 Cool , but what if the weather is not ideal ? 
 they are all good . 
 I should finish it as soon as possible . 
 Why can I learn it ? 
 I feel I really stupid . 
 Yes.please . 
 Oh , my god . 
 I hope so . 
 Have you always been on this site ? 
 Why did you move ? 
 He has lots of hobbies . 
 He ’ s won a dozen prizes for his pictures and roses . 
 He lets his cousins look after his business . 
 Hello , Friendship Restaurant . May I help you ? 
 Yes , Sir . For how many people , please ? 
 What time ? 
 So sorry , we're fully booked in that room . Would you like to make reservation some other time ? 
 I want to get in shape . I feel like a fence sitter-not really fat , but not really healthy . 
 Would you like to get in shape together ? 
 How about going to the gym ? There's one really close to work . 
 As a matter of fact , they are having a promotion right now . 
 Hi , Walter ! 
 What do you think of our new teacher ? 
 You're got a point there . But do you think he's a little absent-minded ? 
 Sir , would you like some dessert now ? 
 Here you are . sir , the chocolate cake is very delicious . 
 I am afraid there is none . 
 Fine . I will bring it right away . 
 Good morning , Ruth . Did I wake you up ? 
 Listen , I am calling to confirm what you said yesterday . Are we supposed to meet at the Chinatown terminal of the Avenue B bus or D bus ? 
 Oh , you mean Canal Street ? 
 Oh , I get it . When did we decide to meet ? 
 I cannot get hold of her yet . 
 See you later . 
 Oh , Mr Green , my name is Jianshan . You don't know me , but I'm a friend of David Smith . 
 When I told David I was coming here to live , he give me your number , and suggest that I give your a ring . I was wondering if you could give me some advices . 
 Well , I'm looking for a place to live . David thought as you are a @ agent . you might know something is suitable . 
 Yes , I've got the address . 
 I'm at the post office . 
 Thank you very much , Mr Green . 
 Look ! There's even a built-in handle to carry it with . 
 Oh , yes , it does . Look , here it says that the CD-ROM is built-in ! 
 It says that it comes in teal and tangerine . 
 And it says that it sleeps . 
 All right.How about other guests ? 
 OK . 
 I'm afraid we have no more sole . 
 Certainly.Just a moment , sir . 
 What ? You're suddenly some kind of coffee snob now ? What's a ristretto anyway ? 
 Sounds like it must be just full of caffeine . I want one of those instead ! 
 Hi Bob , how ’ s business ? 
 Okay , enough small talk . Let ’ s get down to business . 
 Since we ’ re good friends , you don't have to pay me . 
 Bob , what are you thinking about ? 
 When do you go ? 
 What time does the next train to London leave ? 
 Is it a direct train to London ? 
 I see . One ticket to London , please . 
 Single , please . 
 Here you are . 
 Why don't you watch where you're going ? 
 There was plenty of room for me to pull out.You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in . 
 I think my arm is broken . 
 Listen , let's just wait until the police get here.Then we can decide whose fault this accident was . 
 I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ? 
 It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there . 
 Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police . 
 It really hurts . 
 To hell with you . The accident was your fault . 
 To hell with you . 
 Needless to say , it must be Indian Yoga . 
 Tracing back , Yoga has a very long history . It was originated before India had approved Yoga and these documents were arranged and written according to the contents passed by mouth to mouth . In other words , Yoga is passed down from ancient times , which cannot be recalled . 
 But they're hard to be disposed of . 
 How are you doing , Jim ? 
 Not too bad . 
 I'm not sure . What's the difference ? 
 Mostly just to browse the Internet and send emails to friends . 
 Hello , Mr Lawson . It's a pleasure to see you again . You seem to be in here all the time at the moment ! What can I do for you today ? 
 You're right , no problems . You are becoming quite the expert , Mr Lawson . If any problem does turn up , which I'm sure it won't , I'll give you a call . 
 Excuse me . I'm your new neighbor , Jack . I just moved in . 
 I'm looking for a grocery store . Are there any around here ? 
 OK . And is there a laundromat near here ? 
 Thank you . 
 A barber shop ? ! 
 You mean a murder cycle ? Did you know more cyclists die in accidents than motorists ? 
 I'll tell you what . You can get a motorcycle on one condition . 
 You spend two weeks with dad in his ambulance as an EMT trainee and volunteer at the emergency room for one month . 
 After that , we'll let you decide if you still want a murder , I mean motorcycle . 
 Hi , Ben . Come in . Diane's not ready yet , so you'll have to wait a few minutes . 
 That ’ s great to hear . 
 For each month you would have to pay $ 1050 . 
 I don ’ t think that is too much for rent . 
 That ’ s not enough . 
 $ 850 a month is not enough money . 
 That ’ s my final offer . Take it or leave it . 
 Yes , it is better than last year . They have done a very good job this time . 
 If someone wants to find us , they can look at this floor plan.It shows where all the companies have their booths . 
 Really ? They didn't give you one with your ticket ? 
 That's strange . 
 Are you hungry ? 
 I went across the street . There is a good Chinese restaurant next to the hotel . 
 They must . Let me look at that.Here it is . Cortex . It's on the second floor , next to the Roll booth . 
 For whom ? Cortex ? 
 I've never met Darren.But you're right . That would probably be uncomfortable . 
 Yes , maybe . If you're Darren McDowell , you should probably check . 
 No , I'll stay here at the booth . I ate earlier . Are you going to the Chinese restaurant ? 
 I ’ Ve always wondered , what ’ s the difference between English for Chinese students and English for native students ? 
 I think a Chinese student concentrates on written English , and uses it as a basis for communicating . From start to finish he ’ s learning vocabulary and fundamentals of grammar . This is a very difficult way to learn . 
 They get higher level English , which is more formal than everyday spoken English . They also deal with matters of style and creativity . 
 Absolutely not ! Native speakers make a lot of grammar mistakes , especially if they come from a home where nonstandard English is spoken . 
 Actually there are more non-native speakers than you think . That ’ s why it ’ s so important to quit worrying about making mistakes . Just talk to everyone every chance you get . 
 Ok , here is $ 50 . Oh , can you make out an invoice for me ? 
 No , I am a teacher . I teach art . 
 It is . You must be new here . I do my shopping here regularly , once a week . 
 Thank you . Nice to meet you , too . 
 No , I haven't been registered . 
 I'm a medical case . 
 Yes , here you are . 
 The doctor told me to stay about one month . 
 Well , when they leave the hospital , give me a call and I'll come back . 
 Have you had a chance to look over the contract ? 
 And do you have any questions ? 
 No , probably not . For the first two weeks you may teach 10 or 15 hours . 
 I understand . That's why I didn't write the date on the contract.For the first two weeks , we will pay you according to the hours you teach.When you have 22 hours of classes , then the contract will take effect.Is that alright with you ? 
 I don't want you to misunderstand , Miss Briggs.We are very serious about hiring you . We want you to teach for us.We usually do contracts this way because it is more convenient . 
 Good . And your benefits will begin immediately . 
 Yes . We will apply for your health insurance tomorrow.And your free membership in the club starts today if you like . 
 What would you like to know ? 
 Absolutely . The only difference is in the restaurant and bar vouchers . 
 Paying club members get around 300 dollars a year in restaurant vouchers.The vouchers can be used in the restaurant or the lounge.But we don't offer vouchers to employees . 
 That's right . So in a way , it is cheaper for you than for the members.You get more benefits than they do . 
 Yes . I've prepared the contract just so that you understand everything.So that you understand the terms . 
 I'm very pleased . We look forward to having you here , Miss Briggs . 
 Hello , nice to meet you . I ’ m Mr . Gotcha . Have any trouble finding the place ? 
 So why don ’ t you tell me why you are interested in changing positions ? 
 What would you consider your strengths ? 
 What is your biggest weakness ? 
 We have a position where that could work out well . 
 Look , most of the maple leaves have turned red . 
 Of course , my father used to take me to Kiang Shan or somewhere like that as a child . 
 Honey , I'm sorry . I promise you , this summer vacation , I will take you to Huang-Shan Mountains . It is more beautiful and magnificent . 
 Yes , I went there five years ago . You were still a baby at that time . 
 Surely . You can enjoy the beauty of numerous streams and waterfalls . The sea of clouds has a fairy tale beauty . 
 That depends . If you are lucky , you can see a vivid rainbow across over two peaks . 
 I appreciate your remarks . And we are always happy to do more business.But , you know , if we take on a contract to produce new products , we want to be confident the product is marketable . Because , to start producing new things requires a lot of preparation.It requires a lot of investment for us . 
 I would like to offer you a good price.But I won't be able to do that if I think this is a one-shot deal.So I would like to have some confidence in your idea . 
 Yes , of course . 
 And I would say the logo is successful mainly because it comes from Japan.It is the Japanese that have made it a fad . 
 So what you are really trying to sell is a fad . 
 I understand . But why won't you show me the logo ? 
 I see . The problem , however , is that I can't be confident in giving you a good priceless I am confident your product will last . 
 Alright . I understand . Right now you just want estimates . 
 Have you been to the Queen Street West ? 
 You can find the most fashionable restaurants there . And also you can see the galleries , antique shops and the ballrooms . 
 Thank you . I just got this outfit the other day . 
 I got it from Macy's . 
 Thanks again . You look nice today , too . 
 Really ? What kind of shoes are they ? 
 I really like those . How much did they cost ? 
 I think I'm going to go buy myself a pair . 
 Well , it is hard to say . At least you need to come up with a good reason . 
 Yes , you should be there . Go find the manager and ask . I think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . Don ’ t forget to fill in the leave application form . It will be signed by the manager for approval . 
 I learned of the railway accident only this morning . 
 Is that true ? 
 Thanks . 
 I've got it . 
 OK , sir . 
 190 yuan . 
 Thank you . Welcome to call again . Goodbye . 
 Have you any tour route to Budapest ? 
 About 2 weeks . 
 Well , will you offer me any reduction since it's a out-of-season tour ? 
 They're here ! Now that's speedy service ! And they arrived within two days of each other ! 
 Wow ... this shirt is nice , but looks big . 
 With the shipping included--seventy dollars . 
 Ouch ! I just bit my tongue . 
 I think it's bleeding . 
 Yeah . I bet you did forget everything . What's the date today , do you know ? 
 How do you usually part your hair ? 
 ( The hair stylist cuts the customer's hair . ) Almost done . I just have to even things up a bit . ( She shows the customer the results . ) Will that do ? 
 Would you like a shave ? 
 Okay , let me brush you off . Thank you very much for coming . 
 You didn ’ t show up in the morning meeting . What ’ s up ? 
 But you still look a little bit tired . What time did you leave ? 
 That ’ s normal after a tense work evening . Working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either . Once , I worked overtime everyday for a whole week including the weekend . That really broke my rhythm and I got a little sick later . 
 But if the company asks , what else can we do ? 
 I think there ’ s a Western on . 
 Well , I really wanted to see the football game . 
 I believe there ’ s a sitcom . 
 Let me look in the TV Guide first . 
 If I remember correctly , it's a quiz show . 
 Let's watch it together . 
 Nothing , Mummy . I was hungry so I came here for some milk . 
 I don't , but I couldn't find anything to eat in the refrigerator . 
 Nothing . 
 Promise that you won't get angry . 
 It's a kitty . 
 Please , Mummy . Everybody else in my class keeps a pet . Please , I'll take care of it . It's a good kitty . It'll not bring you any trouble . 
 Please , Mummy . I found it this afternoon by the garbage bin . It was starving and looking for something to eat . Please ! You see , it's so cute and tame . 
 I will . Thank you , Mummy . 
 So you have to open all the envelopes . 
 Do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ? 
 I take care of the letters . I may read , sort out and organize incoming mails . 
 Yes , except the personal mail . And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly . 
 Yes , and I check all the e-mails for Mr . Thomas . 
 I have no idea . 
 Let me show you , the one with curly hair . 
 I know I ’ m going to bite the dust going down this hill . I almost got killed on the chair lift ! This is going to be so embarrassing . 
 This is only your second time skiing . This is definitely a case of the blind leading the blind . 
 I don ’ t think I can get up enough nerve to do this . 
 No ! ! ! 
 Don ’ t hold your breath ! 
 Uh , yes . I'm going to the States and I need some traveler's checks . 
 One thousand U . S . dollars . 
 Oh , no . I want to withdraw from my U . S . dollars savings account . 
 Right . Here it is . 
 Mm . In hundreds , please . 
 Yes . How do I get an outside line , please ? 
 No , thanks a lot . I'll try it myself . 
 We have a few different wholesale vendors , so our cost varies a bit over the fiscal year . But the difference is miniscule , a fluctuation of about 0.2 % . 
 Retail price is 29.95 per unit . We take into consideration changes in supply cost when figuring this price . 
 No , that's the price before tax . The tax rate is varies from different marketing areas , so it is difficult for us to figure in . 
 Our profit margin is in the neighborhood of 20 % . 
 Does he like that country ? 
 Would you ask him to tell us more about the country ? 
 It's for you . 
 You're screwed . You can't do anything about that . You have to hope that you get some classes that will be useful . 
 No . They will tell you the same thing in a worse way . 
 Of course . Registering for classes is not something you want to miss . 
 Well , I know psychology 101 is a big class , so there will always be seats in that class . You can also get into Sociology . 
 I took that class last year . The professor is really cool , so if you go to his office , you can have him sign a card that will let you in even if the class is full . 
 I guess that's because so many people drop out of that class . 
 No problem , man . 
 You bet , Emily . Pull up a chair . 
 OK , let's start from the top of your pay stub . This number here represents your gross pay . 
 All right , I see . So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now . 
 Yeah , I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that . So there are two separate income taxes — one at a state level and one at a federal level ? 
 I see . All right , well I think everything else I can figure out on my own . The deductions for health insurance and my 401 ( K ) are pretty self-explanatory . Thanks for your help , Susan . 
 Yeah , I guess it's the same in the UK , I just never paid much attention . See you later ! 
 The thing is , I've got all of this information here , all of these leaflets , but I can't make head nor tail of them ! 
 I'm not sure which would be better for me ; buying some insurance or putting my money in a Savings Deposit . 
 I was thinking of around 10,000 RIB . 
 And for the Savings Deposit ? 
 Wow ! A third more ? Very good . 
 Good for you . Did you use Paypal ? 
 That's the beauty of it , and the danger . 
 How much ? 
 Mmmm , sounds like risky business . Good luck . 
 I think my English is fairly good . As you can see from my CV , I graduated from university with a B . A . degree in English . I studied the English language and English literature systematically . 
 I can type 80 words a minute , basically no mistake , and can take dictation in English at 120 words per minute . 
 Yes , I am . 
 How do you do , Mr . Zhang ? I'm glad to meet you . 
 Thank you very much . 
 On the whole , not too bad . 
 Yes , I am , rather . But I'll be all right by tomorrow and ready for business . 
 Thank you . 
 I'd like to . Let's go . 
 I've read your resume and know a lot of things about your qualifications for this position . One thing you didn't mention is why you left your last job ? I know the company you worked for is a good company . 
 I understand . Why would you like to join our company ? 
 Like what ? 
 that's good to know . Why do you think you ’ re qualified for this position ? 
 Have you a bus tour round the city ? 
 Day tour . How much does that cost ? 
 Is lunch included ? 
 What he said disappointed me . 
 He advised me to change to a more suitable course . 
 He said that career in law was unsuitable for a women . 
 I dislike Susan . She is always above herself . 
 What of it ? 
 Dad , what are we doing tonight for fun ? 
 Yard work ? I said ' what are we doing for fun ' , not work ! 
 Dad . You're so cute . What do I need to do to help get ready ? 
 Jeans and a tee shirt , right ? 
 This looks like a very nice house . 
 The style of the exterior is just what I ’ Ve been looking for ! 
 This home is gorgeous on the inside ! 
 The wall colors totally suit the style of this house . 
 I love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops . 
 There is plenty of room for our king-sized bed , and I love the light in this room . 
 Excuse me , can you tell me where the breakfast cereals are ? 
 Are the snack foods in that area , too ? 
 Okay , I'll go take a look . Thank you so much for your help . 
 What lovely weather ! 
 Let's go out and enjoy the fresh air . 
 Hello Martin . Have you been to any events yet ? 
 Oh wow . How was it ? 
 Oh I still haven ’ t managed to get any tickets . I ’ d love to see something though . 
 What a great idea . 
 Sure . 
 Do we have enough time ? 
 The seats are excellent . We're right in the center . 
 I can't agree more . 
 In the United States , yes . But back in China , I went to concerts a couple of times with my parents . 
 We have two . One is like this one . The other is a little smaller . 
 Thanks for the advice , Mr . Macmillan . I ’ ll keep it in mind . I had better head off though . I ’ m meeting my husband for dinner . 
 Thanks , sir . You too . Drive safely , I hear there ’ s a lot ice on the roads . 
 Hi , it is a pleasant surprise ! 
 Couldn ’ t be better . And you ? 
 I'm worried sick that she will leave me tomorrow . 
 Maybe I'll have to face the music . 
 All right . Where do you live , sir ? 
 Very well . Why do you want to disconnect your phone , sir ? 
 O . K . May I have your name please ? 
 Thank you . Mr . Smith . What ’ s your telephone number ? 
 Thank you . Where should I send your final phone bill ? 
 Thank you , Mr . Smith . Your phone will be disconnected after this phone call . Have a nice day . 
 Hello , what can I do for you ? 
 How long will you stay with the host family ? 
 Usually the host family prepares at least two meals a day for you . 
 There's a problem with my credit card . 
 A charge came up on my bill that I didn't make . 
 The charge was for a $ 350 purse , but I did not buy it . 
 I would know if I bought something that expensive . 
 It was bought on November 12th at 3 
 Until this investigation is finished , will I have to pay for the charge ? 
 we are going out for dinner tonight . Are you coming , Betty ? 
 oh , Jake made a reservation at Friday's . 
 yes , the one with the R $ D team . Is that a problem ? 
 why did you say so ? 
 oh , really ? 
 are you kidding me ? How could he behave like that ? 
 what a shame ! Didn't he realized that ? 
 maybe he should really something about eating etiquette . 
 I really want to go to China for vacation , but I can ’ t find a cheap plane ticket . 
 No , not yet . Can you find a good price there ? 
 Well , you don ’ t have to be mean . How do I do it ? 
 O . K . Thanks . I ’ ll let you know what I find . 
 I ’ ll look for a ticket for you , too . 
 A ETV ? Are you serious ? ETV ? 
 I don't know . I never went to one . 
 Many Americans have never gone to a ETV . It ’ s not an American thing to do . 
 OK , let's go . 
 Fine . 
 Oh , I have been with my uncle for a week . 
 He is an accountant . I have been helping him for a week . 
 Yeah . How are you these days ? 
 Would you like to book a table , sir ? 
 Sure , when ? 
 For how many guests , please ? 
 How much would you like to spend ? 
 OK . 
 Eight . 
 Sure . The main courses are roast Beijing duck and fried eel slices . 
 I was looking for the Resume Writing Workshop . 
 I am not really sure that I remember how to even put a resume together . 
 How do we get started ? 
 Then what ? 
 Could I list my interests and special skills next ? 
 So Kim , have you ever had anything stolen ? 
 My uncle just had his motorcycle stolen a few nights ago . I was just thinking about how clever criminals are these days . 
 I don ’ t know . The ones who stole my uncle ’ s motorcycle were pretty good . 
 He did . It was one of the best ones available . But that didn ’ t stop them from disabling it . And on a crowded street too . 
 You would think that people would be smart enough to stop something like that . No one knew his motorcycle was being stolen . The thieves came in a truck and convinced everybody that my uncle was parked illegally and they were there to tow it away . 
 That ’ s not the end . They were so good that they convinced a bystander to help them lift the motorcycle and put it in the truck . 
 No , I have't got the chance to meet the famous professor yet . 
 Thank you very much . 
 I am sorry you don't like it , sir . But that's just the special point of the dish . 
 Yes , hope you can enjoy it . 
 Really ? I thought he loved his wife very much . 
 He deserved it . 
 I want to check out these books . 
 I have it right here . 
 Are you sure ? 
 How much ? 
 I don ’ t have that right now . 
 I ’ ll do that soon . 
 It will leave at 3:00 p . m . 
 It should be due in at 7:30 a . m.tomorrow . 
 It's 86 coach and 175 berths 
 Here you are at last ! You're half an hour late , you know . 
 What happened ? 
 If the weatherman's predictions are accurate , it should rain tomorrow . 
 Susan , can you give me a hand ? 
 I want to create a password for this document . Please tell me how to do it . 
 What do I do after I've typed in my password ? 
 Where can I buy textbooks ? 
 Yes , I have that . 
 No , I don't know where the bookstore is . 
 Really ? How can I do that ? 
 No , I can't make it today . 
 No , thanks . I'm good . 
 Are you ready to go shopping ? 
 Good idea . Have you written down tea , eggs and potatoes ? 
 Let's just get both . Do you bring enough money ? 
 How do I know if there is a vacancy in a company ? 
 Which websites are most popular ? 
 Do you know that Jack got divorced last month . 
 Jack always lives by his wits and he cannot support his family . 
 Taxi . 
 Thank you . Pls hurry , I am late . Can I get to the Battery Park before 4 ? 
 How exactly do you figure out the car fare ? 
 Oh , I see . 
 Thank you . How much do I owe you ? 
 That's 20 dollars . Keep the change ! 
 Mr . Lin , what are you interested in ? 
 Really ? I'm not much of an outdoor person . What do you like about it ? 
 Do you hike or fish on your trips ? 
 Did you catch anything ? 
 How about Joining our summer camp next week ? 
 How are you , Sue ? 
 Congratulations on your success . 
 And how ’ s your brother ? 
 He ’ s going to be sent to Britain to study , really ? 
 Fantastic ! Please send him my congratulations . 
 Could I ask some questions regarding to the social benefits ? 
 How long is my paid vacation every year ? 
 What about the insurance and housing policies ? 
 How often is the bonus ? 
 Do I have training opportunities ? 
 Well , I don ’ t have any other questions so far . I would like to think a couple of days before I give you my final answer . 
 Ok , thank you for your time and patience . 
 I'm exhausted . 
 Have you seen the new James Bond movie ? 
 Yes . What did you think of it ? 
 Yes , I liked it , too . It was exciting , but not over the top . Do you know what I mean ? 
 Oh , yes . He's brilliant . Did you like the title song ? 
 Hum , Edward Norton , or something like that . Did you like him ? 
 I don't know . I think the woman was better . She provided a good love interest . Lucky James Bond ! 
 This is our Submission of Tender which includes the information about volume of the project , the cost and so on . 
 What kind of guarantee are you going to provide for us ? 
 Should we pay earnest money ? 
 Where do we submit the tender ? 
 Oh , I see . By the way , is tender-opening done publicly ? 
 And are the prices stated in the US dollar ? 
 OK ! We will . Bye ! 
 Paul sends you his regards . 
 Excuse me ! How can I get to the post office , please ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Why didn't you text me last night ? 
 I didn't get any of them . I was waiting for you to text me the address of where the party was and I never got your message . 
 Well , because I didn't have any credit on my phone . I used it all up this month . 
 I do , but if I don't have any credit in my phone , it won't let me call or send messages . 
 Where do you plan to go this winter ? 
 Oh , yes , you like skiing . 
 Did you hear that Mary ’ s marriage is on the rocks ? 
 Yesterday I met Mary , and she told me her husband often made pass at his secretary . 
 Darling , I have news for you . Bobby and his wife , Evelyn , are going to have a baby soon . 
 Actually they ’ re expecting the baby to come on my birthday . 
 In fact , they ’ re both very excited about the coming baby . Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like , since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese . 
 It ’ s still a mystery . Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant . But she begins to take her maternity leave now . 
 Good morning , Linda . How have you been ? 
 I ’ m sorry to hear that . Is there anything else I can do ? 
 Well , I hope you ’ ll feel better soon . 
 I ’ m from Channel 5 News . 
 I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions . 
 First of all , did you vote today ? 
 Who did you vote for ? 
 Why not ? 
 I apologize for invading your privacy . 
 Now let's talk about your interests and hobbies . 
 You have a colorful life . 
 How do you usually spend your time after work ? 
 What kind of books interests you most ? 
 You seem to be a man of imagination and logic . 
 If so , you can benefit a lot from them . 
 I definitely want to meet with you , Mr . Parker . I just need to sort out my schedule . 
 I realize that . We don ’ t have any time to waste . I can put you down for 9:20 . Could you make that , Mr . Parker ? 
 What are you reading about in that science magazine ? 
 I ’ m not sure I like the idea of that . I don ’ t want people copying me or other people . It could be very confusing . 
 In the future , that could be possible . 
 Really ? What else have you discovered ? 
 That ’ s great , because it uses natural materials rather than ones that scientists make themselves . I prefer natural remedies to man-made ones . 
 Two cars forward . 
 7:00 , sir . 
 Are you kidding ? 
 There is a formula that can help us figure that out . What is your annual salary ? 
 What is the length of time that you have worked at the job you have now ? 
 Do you receive any other income ? 
 Do you know what your credit score is ? 
 You are in good shape . Figuring in your other expenses , you can easily afford a house costing seven hundred thousand or maybe even a little more ! 
 Where to , sir ? 
 Hop in , please . 
 It will take about thirty minutes because it is the rush hour . 
 It is an exhibition of Chinese jades . It is held each year . A nice collection jades of are on display and sold . 
 No problem . 
 Yes . We have all kinds of colors for it . 
 What's your favorite color ? 
 Sometimes pink is not bad , too . 
 Thank you . Anything else ? 
 Would you like to have this kind of suitcase ? 
 You can check it , sir . 
 We've managed to reduce our energy consumption in our factory by about 15 per cent in the last two years . 
 Mainly because we've invested in a heat recovery system . 
 Well , we use the exhaust gases from our printing presses to provide energy to heat our dryers . 
 We don't use any fossil fuels . Most of our power comes from hydro-electric plants . We're hoping to use even more energy from alternative sources in the future - perhaps even wind power . 
 We have two cleaning ladies . But both of them have received little education . 
 But I actually dislike another lady . She is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . But the trouble is she Isa backseat driver with some of us . She would tell you what to do and where to put things . 
 Well , that's life . 
 Yes , there are many cities where it's almost always warm.San Diego , for example . 
 Many.Most of the cities in the southern part of the United States are hot all year . 
 Most people grow accustomed to the climate , but there are many others who complain about it all the time . 
 Several.Two good examples are Seattle , in the state of Washington , and Portland , Oregon . 
 In the north there are many cities which are very cold in the winter.Boston and Chicago are two of them . 
 Oh , no.On the contrary , there are many beautiful days , especially in the spring and fall . 
 Of course , what can I do for you ? 
 Oh , what exactly is problem ? 
 Oh , I'm so sorry , Sir . I'll see what I can do about that . 
 The boy is good for nothing . 
 He is hopeless . 
 Yes . To be frank , I really love him to death . 
 Why do you say that ? 
 You really think so ? 
 I sure hope so . 
 Hey doc . Well , I think I might need glasses . I ’ m getting headaches , and I really struggle to see things that are far away . But I have always had 20/20 vision . 
 Mmm .. . X , E , R , 3 , a question mark , and I can ’ t quite make out the other symbol but I think it ’ s the peace sign . 
 Yeah , I know , my vision is really blurry at times . 
 Thanks doc ! 
 do you like music ? 
 do you think this music is warm matched ? 
 how about the lyrics ? 
 it bring me back to some of my childhood memories . 
 of course.it is really fantastic too , and it makes me eager to dance . 
 this song is really worthy listening to and enjoying . 
 Oh , my God ! I feel nothing is going smooth . 
 Hi ! Tom . Fancy seeing you here It's a nice party isn't it ? 
 Quite well . I got my MA degree two weeks ago . 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 When did you lose it ? 
 Can you make a description of your wallet ? 
 Hello . 
 Mick ! Nice to hear from you again . How are you ? 
 Oh , not so bad . I've been very busy , but I'm going away on holiday soon . 
 New house ? Really ? 
 Well , that depends . When is it ? 
 Well . . . I'm going away on Sunday morning . Very early . Will the party go Convery late ? 
 All right . I'll come . But I'd like to bring a present Something for your new house.What would you like ? 
 But I'd still like ... 
 Yes , it has . I'm looking forward to seeing you . too . and your new house . Uh . . . when does the party start ? 
 Yes . Oh . by the W .. 
 Wait a moment , Mick . You haven't . . . Mick ? Are you still there ? You haven'tgiven me your new address . Hello ? Mick ? Hello ? 
 We have to equip our company with a network of work stations at every office and show room as soon as possible . 
 Besides , Internet tends to be more essential now in the information age . 
 And , to be frank , our copying machines are too slow ; our telephone system is limited in function . 
 May I see your ticket , please ? 
 How far are you going ? 
 Where did you begin your journey ? 
 I see . Do you remember how much you paid for your ticket ? 
 Looks like dinner's ready . 
 One Grand Slam breakfast for you ! 
 Thank you for pointing that out . I mistakenly gave you your friend's breakfast . 
 A special order of banana pancakes for you ! 
 I am so sorry , madam ! 
 I will go trade those pancakes for waffles right now . 
 We are free this afternoon , aren't we , Mr John ? 
 It's very kind of you , Mr John.the sightseeing trip between our business talk will be sort of our work division.business can be make for pleasure.what kind of exhibition we're going to see ? 
 Could you give more detail information about some of the industries you just mentioned ? 
 What the others ? 
 How about textile industry ? 
 That's surprising , three days ago when I went to yancheng store , I saw different kinds of textile goods . I've bought some for my wife , some for my friends.they seem very attractive . 
 I'm sure I'll enjoy seeing them.and will have more information of your city industry.what is more ? I'd like to visit if it is possible.the famous Goumi street in the city . 
 I am sure I'll enjoy some real chinese food then . 
 Thanks . But I'm not so sure . Interviews stress me out . 
 I ’ ll do my best , but sometimes I have trouble being myself in stressful situations . 
 Yes ... ah ! I forgot to include my e-mail address . 
 I ’ ll be sure and do that . I also need to pick out the right suit , shirt , and tie for this interview . 
 Sort of . I prepared a list of all the people who can vouch for my experience and good work ethic . 
 Sorry , you ’ re not on it . I don ’ t think using my brother as a reference would be very convincing ! 
 The pleasure is mine.Happy birthday and many happy returns of the day ! 
 Don't be silly . 
 Thank you for allowing us 3 % reduction , but still we find your price is on the high side . 
 If so , we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks . 
 This is our counter-offer . 
 So are we , our counter-offer is in line with the world market . 
 Agreed . 
 I ’ m great . Thank you for asking . 
 Do I owe any fees ? 
 Could you tell me how much I owe ? 
 I can ’ t believe that . 
 I ’ ll pay them off right now . 
 I will pay with cash . 
 Yes , and you could too if your hair wasn't hanging down in your face . 
 You like it , but it's getting to be a handicap for you . 
 I know a great hairdresser not far from here and she is cute too . 
 Did I mention she's good at cutting hair too ? 
 No , mom . Piano is for girls . 
 No way , mom . I don't like piano . 
 All right , all right . I understand . 
 I'm very sorry , sir . I'll bring you a cloth immediately . 
 I'd like to apologize for my carelessness . May I clean it up for you ? 
 Here is my card , sir . Could you send me the cleaning bill and I will refund the cost to you ? 
 I'm very sorry to have caused you this trouble . 
 I will , sir . I'm really very sorry . 
 What kind of character do you think you have ? 
 What is your strongest trait ? 
 How would your friends or colleagues describe you ? 
 What personality do you admire ? 
 How do you get along with others ? 
 Can I have my check , please . 
 May son adores my new hairstyle so I suppose it is worth it . 
 Thank you . 
 Wow , it's surprising . So what do I get ? 
 Probably not . Doing that will probably take another three hours which I can't afford now . 
 You mean I should make an appointment ahead of time ? 
 Got it . Bye for now . 
 The northern line is what you want . 
 It ’ s two yuan . 
 Just go through the number eight to ticket barrier over there . A train will be in directly . 
 That ’ s all right . 
 No I'm afraid not . I'm meeting Ruth then . How about the fourteenth in the morning ? 
 What about the next day ? 
 Yes , I think I am . Let's meet for lunch at mouth restaurant . 
 That's fine . See you there ! 
 Speaking . 
 May I ask how much I can get every month ? 
 I thought the starting salary is too low . 
 I hope to make 4,000 yuan a month for supporting my family . 
 No problem . Thank you for hiring me , I am very proud to be employed by your company and I will come in at eight o ’ clock sharp Monday . 
 Yes , well Miss Childs did give mean overview of the position over the phone , but there were some details I ’ d like to clarify . 
 Could I first ask about the remuneration package ? 
 I understand . And are there other bonuses included ? 
 Well , Mr . Parsons , I am flexible when it comes to salary . The opportunity to work in Hong Kong for you is the most important thing for me . 
 Mr . Black , when is the earliest shipment you can make ? 
 I am afraid shipment by early May would be too late for us . Our customs formalities are quite complicated , and it takes time to distribute the goods to the farmers in our country . The fertilizers must be delivered before April , or else we can't be in time for the spring sowing . 
 You understand a timely delivery is very important to us . 
 What a great weekend that was ! 
 I really enjoy the beach in the summer . 
 We should come here more often . 
 I'd like to come back next weekend . 
 You really look familiar . 
 My name is Phillip Hammer . I think we are related . Who is your dad ? 
 That's my uncle . You're my cousin ! Hi cousin ! 
 It really is . Do you have time to eat dinner and catch up ? 
 What are you doing ? 
 There are no countries marked on the map . 
 The thing that I find most surprising is that most of the world is covered with water . Compared to the oceans , most countries are tiny . 
 Rivers have created deep valleys and canyons like the grand canyon . 
 It ’ s all so interesting . I ’ ll have to find more information about it on the internet . Or perhaps I should try and attend your geography class . 
 OK , sir . How many people are there in your party ? 
 Of course . 
 Go ahead . 
 Come on . Don ’ t hesitate . 
 How much is the video camera ? 
 It is cute . I will take it . Please make out the receipt . 
 I've just had an argument with Bob . 
 He did and it's his entire fault . 
 Good evening , Saliva . What's that wonderful aroma from your kitchen ? What are you doing now ? 
 Are you good at cooking ? 
 It is a good idea . What dish are you cooking now ? ! 
 Yes , I have . But the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . The fish is not well-done and too salty . 
 I have the same idea as yours . 
 Thank you . Oh , it's very delicious . 
 Besides steamed fish , what else are you good at cooking ? 
 So many dishes . Next Friday week is my birthday . I would like to invite you to cook for my dinner party , OK ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 This is frank speaking , may i ask who is calling ? 
 I'm sorry , he is not here at the moment . He has gone to the International Business Center . 
 I'm not sure , he didn't say when he wound return . If you'd like.you can leave him a message until he is back to you until the moment it's free . 
 Does he have your number ? 
 That was 5264453 6 , right ? 
 You are welcome . 
 I'm ok . I wish I could say the same for my friend . 
 he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving . 
 unfortunately not . He was charged with a DUI when he was in university . 
 not much ; it was a minor offence back then . He got away with a fine of $ 500 . 
 no , they were really easy on him . The problem is that that was a long time ago . They are much tougher on crime now . 
 well , he'll definitely lose his license , pay a fine , and maybe even spend some time in jail . 
 not yet . If we can't find a lawyer for him , then the state will appoint him with one . 
 that'd be great ! I know he'd appreciate your help . 
 I graduated from Hebes University . 
 I majored in Economics . 
 I take more than 50 courses in university , including microeconomics , macroeconomics , marketing principles , sales management , statistics , and so on . 
 I did well in university . I was one of the top students in the class . 
 I didn't minor in any subject when I was in university , but I attended English and computer courses . And I am currently studying finance in a training school . 
 I learned from your ad.That you will provide on-the-job training for new employees.This is just what I need , because I'm a recent college graduate . I have the necessary knowledge and skills but I lack experience . 
 I want to prove my true value in the electronic industry , and hopefully in the near future I would be promoted to a higher position . 
 How do you use an ATM card , Billy ? 
 Oh yes . I ’ Ve got it written down here . Just a minute . 
 OK , I ’ Ve entered my PIN . There are several options on the screen . I guess I just choose which service I want , don't I ? 
 I can just enter the amount using the key , right ? 
 These machines aren ’ t very difficult to use . In fact , I quite like them . They are much faster than dealing with a band clerk . 
 Yes . Is it easy to get around ? 
 How about the subway ? 
 did you watch the Oscars on Sunday night ? 
 yes , that was surprising . I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go . 
 they're also one of the richest couples . They have so many money and they can buy almost anything they want . 
 did either one of them win an Oscar this year ? 
 Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ? 
 I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves . 
 I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you . 
 thank goodness we're not rich and famous ! 
 Guess , what I ’ Ve bought for you . 
 I hope you like it . 
 that ’ s all right . 
 I ’ m sorry , we have no mid-size available at the moment . 
 Yes , we do , unfortunately we ran out of cars . 
 I know why we have reservations . 
 But we do have a compact or an SUV if you ’ d like . 
 Alright . We have a blue Ford Focus for you , Mr . Fox . Would you like insurance ? 
 Miss Liu , have we received the fax from MS Company yet ? 
 Excellent . I have been expecting it . 
 You bet it is . It's about the new contract . 
 Here ’ s a letter for you . 
 Who ’ s the letter from ? 
 Read it ! 
 Really ? 
 I ’ m so happy for you ! 
 I am really proud of you . 
 He's too young for the job . 
 Welcome . May I help you ? 
 We have different colours of eye-shadow . May I know what colour you usually wear ? 
 Yes , I see . How do you like this one ? 
 Certainly . 
 Not from this brand , I'm afraid . 
 How about this one ? 
 Then , Mary . We need 10 more loose-leaf binders , five pounds of heavy duty white paper , and what else did I say ? 
 Right . And I ’ d like one of those new electric pencil sharpeners . 
 You taught at a local school for a year , right ? 
 Did you enjoy yourself there ? 
 So why did you decide to resign ? 
 I see . But why don't you continue to work as a teacher ? 
 So you can have more room for development . 
 It sounds like a good idea . 
 Have you washed any clothes yet ? 
 When you wash your dark clothes , can you put some of mine in ? 
 Just make sure you keep it on the gentle cycle . 
 There isn't a lot , why , do you have a large load to wash ? 
 Do you mind washing my clothes ? 
 Thank you so much . 
 Sir , I am very glad to tell that we have successfully registered the trademark for our new product . It is the time to think of some effective promoting strategies . We are beginning to get more attention from overseas . 
 OK , Let me see . I suppose we must strengthen our promotion , because our brand is still new to some consumers . Maybe we should start our advertising program with our local and overseas distributors simultaneously , because they stand on a better position for selecting the best ways to advertise in market places . Besides , the advertisement fund can encourage them to spend more attention on advertising our products . 
 Yes , the mass media has wider influence . One of my classmates works in an advertisement company . I can get help and inspiration from him . And we can also try some less expensive approaches of advertising , such as on-line sales . Personally , I prefer to the on-line sales , for it is cheaper , faster and wider . 
 Yeah , yeah , yeah . Hi , Mary . How are you ? 
 Yeah , I guess I did . They're going to buy invoking ? 
 I'm getting by OK . I heard MicroPower was going to make Zina president of their new invoking Internet division . 
 I ’ d say , think twice about it . Well , you are not going to quit school , are you ? 
 What did you get ? 
 That's not bad . 
 Listen , John . I understand that you are such an excellent student and I know you must have lots of stress , but you really want to give up ? 
 I know . Don't worry . Do you know what you should do ? 
 You need to blow off some steam . The world is not on your shoulder . 
 Forget about school and exams . Come over to my house and have fun . I have some really good DVDs . 
 Then go to bed and have a good sleep . 
 Of course I am . Well , pleasant dreams ! 
 I hear you're moving to New York . 
 Well , we'll certainly miss you in Boston . 
 Let's keep in touch . 
 Michael , it is time to wake up . 
 Yes , it is time to wake up . And , also , from now on I will speak only English to you . And you should speak only English to me , too . 
 Right . That's good . 
 I know you can do it . 
 That is great . All I want is for you to do your best in everything you do . 
 Yes . I have no plans . 
 Yes , that sounds wonderful . 
 But wait , wait , will there be food that is not meat ? You know . I'm a vegetarian 
 The other day , I decided that I needed to loose more weight so I am going to try to be a vegetarian . And you know what ? I don't miss the taste of meat . 
 Yes , it really is . After having vegetarian diet . I have much more energy , I need less sleep , I feel calmer . I can maintain an ideal body weight without worrying about how much I eat and I can think more clearly . 
 Yes , maybe . But I feel better since becoming a vegetarian . Maybe you could also have a try . 
 Maybe you would change your mind after having a vegetarian diet . 
 I have been having a lot of headaches lately . 
 I have had headaches my whole life , but they have been getting worse lately . 
 I ’ Ve been under stress , but no more than usual . 
 No , I only sleep a few hours a night . 
 Yes , actually I fell skiing last week and hit my head . 
 Which university did you graduate from ? 
 What was your major at university ? 
 What course did you like best ? 
 What do you think is the relationship between the subjects you've taken and the job you are seeking ? 
 I ’ m looking for a budget hotel in Orlando . Have you ever stayed at the Comfort Hotel ? 
 Why not ? 
 Oh . I guess you get what you pay for . How long did you stay there ? 
 Hmm , I ’ ll pass . Hopefully I can find a decent place that won ’ t cost a fortune . 
 You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness . 
 Do you really think so ? I don't . It will just make us fat and act silly . Remember last time ? 
 I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends . 
 Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us . That is excellent exercise and fun , too . 
 All right . 
 Sure . Firstly , it is very important for you to be punctual . Interviewers usually don ’ t think much of a candidate who comes 5 or 10 minutes late only to explain that he could not find the place or he was stuck in traffic . 
 Secondly , you need to create a good image in a limited time . 
 I think you should make some preparations . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . What ’ s more , try to avoid a too causal style . 
 You ’ d better not . Informal clothes like sports shirts , tom jeans or dirty sneakers convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . 
 Hello , I want to order an Easy-own package . What would you recommend ? 
 About the same . But I'm looking for a job , so I have to answer the phone often . 
 That's good . How can I order it ? 
 Thank you . I'll have a try . 
 the James ’ s file , Christine ? 
 Christine , I know you ’ re new here and there ’ s a lot to learn , but you are going to have to learn to keep your work in better order . We can ’ t afford to lose an important document . 
 How would you like your hair set ? 
 Shall I put some oil on ? B 
 Ask John . He is sure to know about it . 
 He has a finger in the pie . 
 I'm afraid I've got a terrible cold . What should I do ? 
 Yes , but I'm not feeling very better now . Actually I'm feeling even worse . 
 My stay is over . Here's the key to my room . 
 Many thanks . 
 This could be a great hotel , once you get rid of the insects . The city itself is great . 
 Did you hear what happened in the Scott case ? Some of the sensitive material were leaked to the press . Now every newspapers is all over it . 
 I'm sure they have their suspicions ; there were only a few of the senior level layers who were privy to the case details . 
 I'm sure there'll be canned ! And there also might be some legal consequences . 
 Because whoever let the cat out of the bag was breaking client confidentiality . 
 I'm sure management is on top of it . 
 Well , I know you are interested in architecture , so you should't miss the Temple of Heaven , and the Great wall is a must too . 
 Why are you considering trying for it ? 
 What is it about this job that appeals to you ? 
 Yes , you could be right . There is a lot to consider . 
 Would a slight decrease in pay be worth it for a new opportunity for growth ? 
 I think you should give it a shot . What do you have to lose ? You can always change your mind . 
 Me ? Why me ? Why not you ? 
 And you think I fit the qualifications ? 
 Really ? What is there to do after we graduate ? 
 I'm honored that you think I would be qualified . But I would really have to think about this first . 
 When you made your appointment , what day did you choose ? 
 At what time was that appointment ? 
 I can see the appointment that you had . What day do you need to change to ? 
 What time would you prefer ? 
 I will put you down for that time . Thank you for calling to reschedule . 
 No . Someone had stolen a march on me and bought it . 
 It is marvelous , and the price is marvelous , as well . 
 Yes , do you have a wine list ? 
 Do you have mixed drinks in this restaurant ? 
 I am not sure what I want . Do you have any house specials ? 
 That sounds good ! Please bring me one of those . 
 I would like it blended . 
 I would like my margarita with no salt , thank you . 
 Well , apparently I ’ Ve run up quite a bill . I was under the impression that the Junior Executive Holiday Package only cost 250 dollars per night . I ’ Ve just been informed that it ’ s actually 500 do 
 But I definitely was led to believe that a three-night stay would be $ 750 . 
 When I booked the room , your staff didn ’ t mention this . And the brochure and your promotional mailings do not mention that . 
 Yes . Have a look . 
 Perhaps you could arrange to provide me with a new bill that reflects the advertised rate . 
 Thank you . 
 What's your last name ? 
 Yes , I do show your reservation . How could you like to pay for the room ? 
 Fine . Here is your room key , here is also a map of our hotel . The swimming pool , gym and sauna are all located on first floor . 
 Yes . If you want to order room service , just press 0 on your phone , and that will connect you with the front desk . 
 Good morning . I'd like a business suit made with this material . 
 The kind that never goes out of fashion , I guess . 
 I'm sure you're right . I just dread the idea of making a new suit every year . 
 Good . I think I'll choose this single breasted one . When can I get it ? 
 Thank you . 
 No , sir . 
 Good-bye , sir 
 Hello . This is the operator . Can I speak to Mr . Smith , please ? 
 I have a collect call for you from Jennifer . Will you accept the charges ? 
 Okay . Thanks . 
 Pity we didn't catch it . 
 We have to wait six more minutes ! 
 Yes , that's true . 
 It depends.But usually it's about 15 days . 
 Yes , dumpling is a must.There is also other food.For example , people eat chicken for good luck . 
 Yes , it's really wonderful ! 
 I'm sure you'll have a good time . 
 All right . Please read it to me . 
 Very good . 
 Oh , that's great . 
 We have a good variety . What decade would you like ? 
 There are six on this table . 
 Many people like the dancing figures . Two of our boxes have the figures . 
 That one will bring you many hours of pleasure . 
 I'm sorry , but if it breaks down , you're on your own . 
 When you buy a Model T , you can't expect a warranty . 
 Do I have a choice ? You said the guy who was supposed to do it didn't show . 
 Just come over here , sir . First you need to sign in and get your photo nametag . 
 Would you like to donate to our alumni fund ? 
 What's the rush ? 
 I'm not ready to get off the phone with you . 
 What is it that you need to do ? 
 I'm not being nosey , it's just a question . 
 That was mean to say . 
 I guess . 
 We are willing to work with you , but do you think it would be possible to extend your confirmation deadline ? We need to check the warehouse to make sure the products are in stock . The earliest I will be to get back to you is tomorrow morning . 
 We can do that , but it will cost ... If we have to check our inventory with all our guys on overtime , you're looking at an increased cost of , I'd say , maybe 10 % . 
 No , and let me tell you why ... If I make my guys stay over to check the inventory , I'll have to pay them at an overtime rate , which is time and a half . I estimate it will probably take 3 guys two hours to finish , that will be an increase on your labor fee by at least 10 % ... if you need the numbers that urgently , I can have them do it . Otherwise , we can wait until tomorrow morning , and I'll call you with the numbers after they're done . It's your call ... 
 What for ? 
 Sorry , I don't feel like playing . I have too much homework . 
 Yeah , I ’ m going to be running the Walker Avenue Branch . 
 Thanks . I appreciate it . 
 Oh , no ! No more paddling ! My arms are sore ! 
 Beth , what date is today ? 
 What is the date today ? 
 Oh , i almost forgot . Today is my mom's birthday . 
 Thanks ! I will do that ! When is your birthday ? 
 Wow ! What a lucky girl ! Your birthday is on Christmas Day . 
 April 2nd . I missed being a target of a lot of jokes by one day . I guess I am lucky , too ! 
 Thanks . 
 I guess so . 
 That should work out great . You are miracle worker ! You have got me awake and motivated . 
 Hey ! How was your first day of class ? I ’ m in level two and I ’ m loving my class this semester ! It ’ s great being in a class of international students ! 
 That ’ s both fortunate and unfortunate . It ’ s the United Nations in my class ! We have people from all over the world ! There are three Germans , a Pole , a Scottish , two French , an American , a Brazilian , a Chilean , a New Zealander , though he prefers to call himself a Kiwi . Who else do we have ? Oh , we also have a Moroccan , a Togolese , a Pakistani , and two Indonesians ! 
 Well , I think you ’ re pretty lucky actually . You ’ ll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture . 
 Don ’ t ! Stay the course ! Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful . I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice . 
 Well , there is that , yes . 
 Really ? Do I look happy all the time ? 
 Oh , do you know why ? Actually , it ’ s easy . Because I always exercise . My exercise , I think , is very hard . I often feel very good after conquering these difficulties . I feel alive ! 
 Yeah , they are doing it for fun . Seldom would people like my exercise . It ’ s difficult and boring . 
 But I think Chinese students need to exercise more . Besides exercise will help them learn new things better . Don ’ t students want to have a good memory ? 
 Well , do what you like to do . It can be anything . Jogging , doing aerobics , going bicycling , and playing ping-pong . Absolutely anything . Doing three or more workouts a week is good for you . But remember to do some stretches first . 
 can I use your laptop for a while ? 
 oh , isn't your computer Wi-Fi capable ? 
 oh my , no internet access is killing me . 
 no , I'm not feeling myself . I just want to check my emails , visit my favorite websites and chat with my friends . 
 what does that mean ? there's nothing wrong with me . 
 that's alright . I just can't bear losing track of all the latest information . It almost drives me crazy . 
 Tell me why you saw the movie twice . 
 You bet it . 
 Oh , no . I forgot to turn the alarm clock on ! 
 Thank you . You save me . 
 I'm fine , thanks . Just trying to get adjusted . It's hard to keep track of everything around here . 
 Yeah . I just got here a couple of days ago . How about you ? 
 Sure . Doing your homework and preparing for an interview really pays off . 
 Well first you have to have more confidence.Employers look for people who are interested , enthusiastic and sure of themselves . 
 No , you should always be upfront and honest about your weaknesses . However by focusing on your strong points and maintaining a positive attitude about your abilities , you can take the attention 
 Thank you . That way , PLS . 
 An attendant will pass them around after we take off . 
 No problem . Here are your headphones . Do you want something to drink ? 
 Where are you going ? 
 OK , here we go . 
 We shouldn't have any trouble if we don't get stuck in the traffic jam . 
 Here we are , you still get plenty of time . That's 8.15 $ , please . 
 Hello Mrs Parker , how have you been ? 
 Very well . Let's see , according to his vaccination record , Ricky has received his Polio , Tetanus and Hepatitis B shots . He is 14 months old , so he is due for Hepatitis A , Chickenpox and Measles shots . 
 Well , I can only give him these for now , and after a couple of weeks I can administer the rest . 
 We will check our records and I'll have the nurse administer and the booster as well . Now , please hold Ricky's arm tight , this may sting a little . 
 It's about 5 degrees centigrade . 
 The weatherman says it's going to snow tomorrow . 
 I think I'll soon get used to it . 
 lt's about 180C , but in winter the temperature may fall to 10-15 degrees below zero . And we have a long winter . 
 I prefer spring when little by little everything becomes green and the weather is almost always nice . 
 Hey , that's not fair . I did as much work as you . 
 ( Before Christmas Party ) Are you ready for the Christmas party tonight 
 Use this lipstick and it will make your lips shine ! 
 I've already got mine . 
 Here ! Open mine first . 
 Hey ! Why don't I have any presents ! 
 Tom has gone to lunch . 
 Do you want me to have him give you a call ? 
 He should be back in about forty minutes . 
 What ’ s wrong ? I want a break from this horrible job . 
 Would you like to buy a bottle for me in the shop ? 
 Ok , I will go there myself . 
 It doesn ’ t matter . Oh , God , I have only four dollars in my wallet . Is that possible for me to buy one ? 
 Are you alright , child ? 
 What did the nurse say ? 
 In that case , you should go home and get plenty of rest . 
 Then I'll phone our family physician and make an appointment for you . 
 Thank you , but I hate having to leave here and working abroad . 
 Sometime next month . 
 I need to cancel one of my accounts . 
 I don ’ t need it anymore . 
 Just transfer it over to my remaining account . 
 That would be great . 
 Not today . 
 That ’ s fine . Take your time . 
 Let me see , in 5 minuets . 
 Don't worry . The bus tour is really worth while . You can enjoy the whole city in a single day . 
 It lasts 4 hours , from 10:00 to 14:00 
 Over my dead body you are ! 
 Sorry , it ’ s all sold out . 
 We have tickets for the matinee . It starts at 3p . m . 
 Where would you like to sit ? 
 Certainly . 
 Yes , this is Jin Lili . What can I do for you 
 There is too much static on the line . 
 Pardon ? I can hardly hear you . I will call you later . 
 I'm sorry , Steven . 
 I know . But I ’ m not ready for married life yet . 
 Your way does touch my heart . 
 I want to think of it for some time . 
 His girlfriend dumped him , and he is tearing his heart out over her . 
 Love is blind , you know . 
 Let ’ s go for a joy ride . 
 But I don't have any reading assignments . 
 Aw , Mom-you're such a drag . 
 What are you here for today ? 
 Is the arresting officer here ? 
 Plead your case . 
 Why would the officer lie ? 
 Did the camera take a picture of your license plate ? 
 There was no picture taken , so I'll let you go . 
 Were you around when the robbery happened ? 
 Could you explain what you saw ? 
 What did you see ? 
 Did you see his face ? 
 Did he come in with anyone else ? 
 Would you come down to the station for further questioning ? 
 Do you want to talk with John with tongue ? 
 When should I tell him to call back ? 
 All right . 
 Ant Shirley , it's being years since we last met . How were you doing in the passing years ? 
 Fine . Where are the other guys ? 
 Bad timing . I want to see them so much . How are they ? 
 Yes , that's why I'm here . I'm thinking about buying a second-hand apartment . 
 No , that will be too expensive . 
 My first job's salary will be a bit low . So the cheaper the better . Just one I can afford . 
 I'll appreciate it so much . 
 Well , I came to talk to you because I want to apply for a scholarship . 
 Thanks . I really appreciate it.In fact , I do need a letter of recommendation for this scholarship . 
 It's an undergraduate scholarship offered by the American Minority Students Scholarship Association . I'm eligible for it because I'm Asian American . 
 I'm a junior now , and my GPA is 3.92 . 
 Well , I hope so . The competition is probably pretty heavy.And they want a writing sample too . 
 No , they want a special essay . I must write an essay on a particular question they pose . 
 They give applicants a topic.The topic is , The Place of Ethnic Minorities in a Democratic Society.My essay must be three pages typed and double-spaced . 
 Yes , but I need to write it by next week . 
 I came here today to talk to you because ... Well , I need to ask two favors . 
 First , I need a letter of recommendation . 
 And second ... Well , I'm not sure if it's normal . 
 Yes , if you could . I mean , if you could read it to make sure there are no mistakes.Or maybe you'd have some suggestions . 
 I will . I want to write the first draft tonight.So I could bring it tomorrow morning . 
 That would really help me a lot . I'm very grateful . 
 It will do you good to go out for entertainment at weekends.What kind of movie do you like best ? 
 Shall we go downtown for a movie this Friday evening ? 
 I'm not sure . Let me give a call to find out . 
 Thanks , Monica . Without support from you and other colleagues , I would not have made it . 
 Well , just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough , you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective . Don ’ t be afraid of taking challenging . They might be opportunities and failing is not fatal . You learn more from that actually . Sometimes , you need to fail to be successful . 
 I think it is a smart idea . Our boss always likes it when employees take initiatives . 
 Would you like anything else ? 
 All right . And do you want to separate bills or just one single bill ? 
 Here is your bill . It comes to 80 yuan . And yours is 60 yuan . 
 What would be a good day to finally move into the house ? 
 Will the electricity and water be on , or do we need to do something to get it turned on ? 
 The carpet needs to be cleaned , and I want to paint the walls a different color . 
 I want my appliances to be delivered as we are moving into the house . 
 Would you be willing to help me do a few things on the day I move in ? 
 Waiter , get me rag , please . I have just spilled my wine . 
 Thank you . Please bring me some paper napkins . 
 I think I should be more careful next time . 
 How about this one ? 
 It doesn't matter , sir . Shoes will stretch a bit with use . 
 Welcome back . 
 I think it is time to study . Our chemistry exam is coming . 
 December 1st . 
 It seems to be from chapter six to chapter ten . 
 Why are you so pessimistic ? 
 I believe you can pass the exam with good preparation . Don't lose your heart . 
 Henry , I want to ask you something . 
 You see . The wage is not paid yet , I am wondering if you could possibly lend me some money . 
 Did you get my email ? 
 Sure . 
 Well , to be honest , nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss . 
 I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses . I spent half of the weekend on a train ! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets ! 
 I see . Well , then perhaps they could give me a few days off after a business trip . It was really tiring for me . 
 Thank you . I can't imagine getting much done today . I'm just too exhausted ! 
 No , should I have ? 
 Jessica , I am very sorry to hear that . Why are you leaving ? 
 Oh . If you had talked to me first , we would have given you a raise . 
 Ok , good luck , Jessica . By the way , if you ever need a letter of recommendation , I would be happy to write one for you . 
 Please , where do I catch the plane for New York ? 
 That one there ? 
 Thank you . You ' Ve been very helpful . 
 Yes . We need a plumber here . 
 I am sorry . They are not available now . 
 What a shame ! 
 That's too bad . 
 I'm sorry to hear that . 
 What a pity ! 
 Ho , no ! 
 I pay much attention to my daily diet . You know good eating habits help to fortify the body against disease . 
 I eat more fruits and vegetables and limit amounts of fatty and fried foods . 
 I drink milk every day . It's really good for building strong bones and teeth . I drink tea quite often , for it's protective against kidney cancer . 
 You are what you eat , and a healthy diet creates a body resistant to disease . 
 You're welcome ! 
 What did she say ? 
 Really ? I can't believe it . 
 But I think a master degree is good enough for a girl . 
 Yeah ? You finally decided to wipe the slate clean ? 
 So what are you going to do ? Take up an art class or something ? 
 I ’ m with you on that one . Anything else you ’ re planning on doing ? 
 It ’ s about time ! 
 I am great ! How about you , Mary ? How are you ? 
 I was wondering if you want to go see a movie with me tonight ? 
 OK . What about going to the movies on Friday night ? 
 I was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer . 
 That's a chick flick ! 
 Hello , this is John . I wanna speak to Linda , please . 
 Hi , Linda . I want to invite you to a dinner tomorrow evening . 
 At seven thirty pm , Longing Chinese restaurant.And I'll go to your home and pick you up at 7 . 
 No , have a nice day ! 
 See you . 
 I ’ m not sure . I feel hot and cold . 
 I was sick most of the night . 
 Have I got high fever ? 
 Yes , I have . 
 ah . 
 All right , thanks . 
 What shall I do today ? 
 Julia , the apartment I looked at today is pretty decent-around 120 square meters . 
 A new two-bedroom apartment , around 100 to 120 square meters , in the Sanlitun area . 
 Very quiet and safe . And it's got a lot of trees and plants . 
 Yeah , it's near a bus stop . 
 You look upset , anything wrong ? 
 Why ? 
 You'd look before you leap . 
 When he told me I had to work overtime , that was it . 
 Yes , he's really pushed me too far . 
 Have you watched any of the talent shows on TV ? 
 Yeah , and they know exactly what the audiences have in mind . Everyone desires equal opportunities and a channel to climb up the social ladder all the way to the highest in society . 
 But it seems that these talent shows are getting less popular these days . There's no such program on this year . 
 No surprise . The over-the-top promotion has ruined the audiences ' appetite . 
 The same is true for ' My Hero ' . Winners of the contest used to star in the TV series ' The Frog Prince ' . 
 What's this , I wonder ? 
 A coffee grinder ? 
 Oh , that would be very useful . 
 Good morning . 
 Yes . I'd like your breakfast special , please . 
 Soft-boiled , please . 
 What's bothering that guy ? 
 It ’ s very nice to meet you . 
 I can ’ t believe I ’ m actually speaking to a candidate . 
 I want to ask you what your policy is on gay marriage . 
 Would you make gay marriage legal ? 
 I know a lot of people wouldn ’ t agree with that . 
 I think that is really cool of you . 
 Hello . My name is John Sandals , and I've got a reservation . 
 Sure . Here you are . 
 I sure do . How about American Express ? 
 No American Express ? Okay , here's my VISA . 
 Yeah , that'll be fine . 
 Are you going to buy a bicycle ? 
 ¥ 350 . 
 Your discount is already included . Normally we charge ¥ 400 , but now we can give you a special price . This is our sale period . 
 Sorry , but this is the best price . You can ’ t get it any cheaper than here . 
 I'm afraid you can ’ t . You ’ re welcome to pay in cash . 
 Yes . My car is having problems . 
 It won't start . 
 No , thank you . I think I can handle it . 
 I will . Thanks . That's sweet of you . 
 I might need some tools though . Do you know where I can get some ? 
 Thanks . That would be very helpful . 
 OK . If you really insist , I could always use the company . 
 I think there is an accident ahead . 
 I know . Why don't we take a different route ? 
 Ok , let's do that , even though we may have to take a longer way . 
 What's up ? 
 Are you asking me for a date ? 
 I don ’ t like to go to the movies on a date . It's noisy there . 
 Let's go to the coffee shop then . It's quiet there . 
 How about seven ? 
 Do you think it's time to sign the contract , Mr . Simpson ? 
 OK , no problem . I hope there are no questions about the terms . 
 Shall we sign this contract now ? 
 Just sign at the bottom . 
 You're right . Thank you for your cooperation . 
 How would you describe your relationship with our boss ? 
 What do you think his strengths are ? 
 Why are you holding me in this jail cell ? 
 Merry Christmas , Bill . 
 What are you doing there on the computer ? 
 That's pretty interesting . Did you get one from Haven ? The reason I ask is that I am looking for her number . 
 Yeah , that would be great . Thanks . 
 Thanks million . 
 Can you give me a hand with the dishes ? 
 I wash and you'll dry . 
 I'm the coolest high-tech stud around ... 
 Not yet ... I got an MP3 player and a set of stereo headphones . 
 Yep ! And take it with me anywhere ! And the music is free ! 
 Welcome to the company . We are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company . 
 You're kidding ! Something as simple as that ? 
 Yes , there has been a lot of research into RSI's . Something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries . Tell me , did anything else influence your decision ? 
 Well , welcome to the team . 
 Oh , really ? Just a moment ... You paid with a ten-dollar note and I gave you ... Oh , sorry , here's a five left . I'm terribly sorry . 
 I have no idea . To be honest , I couldn't care less . 
 Let me see ... Wednesday morning . Yes , I am booked solid all morning . What ’ s up ? 
 I can explain them to you . It ’ ll just take about a half an hour . How about Friday afternoon ? 
 OK . Shall we say next week , on Tuesday at 2:30 ? 
 We are interested in some precision machine tools . We have some inquires on hand . 
 Can I have a look at your catalogue and the corresponding technical data ? 
 I think our users have the impression that your prices are always much too high , compared with those of other supplies . 
 Your products may have certain advantages , but your prices are too stiff . 
 OK , I'll come back to discuss it to some details after our users have studied your catalogues and price list . 
 Oh , so Dalian is hotter than New York now . 
 Are you staying at the Hilton ? 
 Good evening , can I get you a drink ? 
 Would you like to order anything off the appetizer menu ? 
 Would you like to order anything else ? 
 No problem , call me when you're ready to place the rest of your order . 
 What did you want to order ? 
 Can I get you anything else ? 
 Show me a smaller pair of trousers , sir . I am not that fat , you see . 
 I have no idea . Measure me , please . 
 ( After trying ) I'm afraid it's still too fight around the stomach . 
 ( After trying ) Mm , a perfect fit . How much ? 
 A little expensive . But I'll buy it anyway . It's hard for me to get a perfect one . Here is 200 Yuan . 
 Hello , is everything alright ? Can I help ? 
 Similar to a Promissory Note , yes . I can deal with that for you right here . The difference between a Promissory Note and a Bill of Exchange is that this product is transferable and can bind one party to pay a third party that was not involved in its creation . 
 That's right . We didn't issue it to you , but technically we are buying it from you . So , we become involved . 
 As long as you have all of the documentation we require you have nothing to worry about . 
 Steak , please . 
 Medium rare , please . 
 May I have a glass of red wine , please ? 
 First you add the washing powder then you add the clothes . 
 Yes , for the last 20 years . 
 I was wondering if you could help me to get a library card . 
 I'm finished . 
 OK , the form is all filled out . 
 No , I have no idea what they are . 
 Yes , right . 
 Can I help you ? 
 May I know the reason , madam ? 
 When did you buy it ? 
 Can I see the receipt ? 
 Well , if there is no damage , you can return it . 
 Do you have a Chinese edition of this ? 
 I'll try to read one . 
 I think the job should make use of the professional experience I have obtained , and offer me opportunity for advancement . 
 I feel my background and experience are a good fit for this position and I am very interested.What ' s more , your company is outstanding in this field . 
 My graduate school training combined with my experience as an intern should qualify me for this particular job . I am sure I will be successful . 
 Your company is very reputed in this city . I heard much praise to your company . 
 You mean with my performance ? 
 I guess everyone has a few secrets up their sleeve . 
 I was part of a band in school . 
 Come on ! This is work . Don't you think that would be a little weird ? 
 Yes , I did . By the way , in case there is a flaw in this CD player , can I return it ? 
 Is there a charge for that . I know other stores have a restocking fee . 
 Thank you . 
 Thanks . I'll put it in a safe place . 
 What is it ? 
 Maybe there's something wrong with her . 
 Yup , I think so . The car ’ s packed.we have munchies and music , and the map ’ s in the car . 
 Got it ! Did you fill up the tank ? 
 You ’ re sure we ’ re not forgetting anything ? 
 Well.let ’ s get going then ! I love road trips ! 
 But we ’ Ve only been on the road for ten minutes . 
 What did you say when she told you the news ? 
 But I put my foot down and insisted on her forgetting that . 
 Hi there , Philip . How ’ s everything going ? 
 I don ’ t blame you . You ’ Ve had a busy first week . Take a rest ! 
 Excuse me . Can you tell me how to find some books on social science ? 
 Yes . 
 So if I'm looking for a look called A History of Western Society , I'd just look under ' A ' . 
 What if I don't know the title of the book ? 
 Could you give me an example ? 
 How do I get to the EDD ? 
 Can I go in to look for a job at their office ? 
 Is there an office near me ? 
 Do you know where the local office for this area is ? 
 If I go there , will I be able to collect money right away ? 
 When can you get the finished product to me ? 
 Great ! That ’ ll be ahead of schedule ! Good work . 
 how did your interview go ? 
 if you get the promotion , what will your new title be ? 
 will you get a pay-raise , too ? 
 that makes sense . Who interviewed you ? 
 what kinds of questions did she ask you ? 
 the second one sounds rather difficult to answer . What did you tell her ? 
 those are good answers . How did she react ? 
 what do you think about her as a boss ? 
 you're lucky . Not everyone has such a great boss ! 
 when you find out you get the promotion or not , let me know . 
 Mary ? Are you still there ? 
 Did your bid win ? 
 Hey ! I'm trying to be nice , and you still want to fight ! Did you get the statue or not ? 
 Sorry . I take that back . I mean the copper Buddha you wanted . 
 Just give me a second . I'll be right up . I ran a virus scan on your computer , and it turns out that you have a lot of infected files ! 
 Well , you have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly , yours wasn't up to date , that ’ s probably what was causing your problems . 
 Yeah , try not to kick or hit the computer ! 
 Hey ! What's up ? 
 Yeah , I've been out of town . 
 Great ! Work is really busy now , but it's fun . 
 I haven't taken it yet . 
 I study every night . 
 Does it cost money ? 
 Does the test cover everything in the manual ? 
 Did you pass the test your first try ? 
 Wish me luck . 
 Yes . 
 I am afraid I can't attend the press conference due to an urgent conference with the Board of Directors at half past four . 
 Yes , thank you very much . In addition , do you have the marketing proposal ready ? 
 Dahua's Market . How can I help you ? 
 We are on Nanjing Road , next to the theatre . 
 What can I do for you , sir ? 
 Do you want to have a tub bath , surfing bath or shower ? 
 All right . The fitting room is over there . 
 $ 100 . But we will charge you $ 200 as a deposit . 
 Yes , I'd like to make a deposit . 
 I prefer time deposit . 
 RIB deposit . 
 Yes . 
 Six months . 
 Here you are . 
 Thank you . 
 I'm glad that you could get back to me so fast . 
 I needed to talk to you about your son . 
 He was acting up in class one day last week . 
 He wouldn't stop talking throughout the class . 
 If you could , would you please talk to him ? 
 I really appreciate your help . 
 Well , it doesn't seem like it.He must have forgotten . 
 Are you the loan officer of this bank ? 
 I was wondering if I could ask you some questions about a loan I want to make . 
 Thank you . See , I ’ m planning to buy a car here and I ’ m planning to use my time deposit here as the collateral . 
 He said his grandmother got cancer and has only a few weeks to live . It's really so sad ! But when I talked to him on the phone , it sounded like he was holding up really well . 
 I asked if there was anything I could do to help his family , and I told him that I could be a shoulder for him to cry on . 
 Will you book a ticket to New York for me ? 
 This Saturday . 
 That's right.Will you check what fights are available on the sixth of September ? 
 I'll have the 5 o'clock one.What time do I check in ? 
 Thank you . 
 Sorry , we have sold out the tickets . 
 ' Beautiful Mind ' will be playing again . And there's also ' Titanic ' . 
 Yes , 20 yuan for each . 
 OK . Here you are . 
 Honestly , the flexible hours were the main attraction for me . The traditional working day doesn't fit in with me lifestyle ; I love being able to tailor my working hours . 
 At first it is going to be difficult . During the first three months , I'm on probation . So I won't get sales commissions until after that . 
 Yes , I'm looking forward to that ! I just hope my first performance review is favorable . 
 Great ! Then I suppose I'm looking forward to my first promotion , too . 
 You're welcome . 
 Well here . Help yourself to some shrimp . It's fresh . 
 I thought you knew , Todd . It was decided last week . I guess you weren ’ t at the meeting . 
 I ’ m sorry . Todd , but Mr . Emory felt that it was going too slowly , and that it needed a fresh start . He should have told you . 
 Very sorry , I am occupied tonight . What about tomorrow night ? 
 7:00 in my staying hotel . 
 My wife is sick , so I have to cancel a reservation I made . 
 I'm Rudy Randolph at 818-555-1234 , April ninth to the fifteenth . 
 I wish everything in life was so simple . Thank you . 
 I want to fly to Congo on Monday , the 17th . 
 By the way , I'd prefer a night flight . 
 That's fine . I want to pay in cash . Here is the money . 
 Yes , I am . 
 How do you do ? 
 It's kind of you to meet me at the airport . 
 No , I have visited China several times , but it's my first visit to Beijing and I think it's a great honor to be invited to your beautiful city . 
 Thank you . I'm sure I will have a wonderful time here . 
 Here's the application form . 
 Thank you . Now if you'll just give me a credit card . 
 Thank you . 
 I didn't realize you felt so strongly about it . 
 I'm sorry . I'll ask next time . 
 Yes , Sir , the specialty of our restaurant is the seafood . 
 Perhaps you would like some sole . Many guests like it very much . 
 Any drinks ? 
 That's all the general information of our company . I think you already have good knowledge about our company . 
 When we have the final results , we will call you . 
 If you pass the interview , the personnel department will inform you within two weeks . 
 I'm sorry we won't . You can wait for two weeks . If you don't get a telephone call , it means that you weren't successful . 
 I'm sorry but I can't make the final decision myself , and I have to discuss it with other interviewers . 
 Your mentality is very good and that's great . 
 My pleasure . 
 Hi , Malia ! What a nice home ! 
 How long have you lived here ? 
 Well , it is very beautiful . 
 Good ! I am really thirsty . You know it really is hot outside ! 
 Mango juice would be perfect . Thank you ! 
 No problem . 
 You mean the white building near the playground ? 
 That is the library . And it has more than 1,000 , 000 books . 
 You know , our school is divided into two parts , the junior high school and the senior high school . That is the new classroom building for our senior high school . 
 Yes . There is a large swimming pool , but it is only available in summer . 
 I believe that you can make your dream come true . 
 Hello , everybody . I am Monica and this is my first day at work . I am working in the finance department . I am very happy to meet everyone and I am looking forward to working well with all of you . I am very happy to be one of the team and I will do my best to get into the working situation as soon as possible . By the way , call me Monica . Everybody calls me so . 
 I know , we've met . 
 Yes , we met last year at a conference . 
 You would like me to send this to all managerial staff ? I'm sorry , sir , could you please clarify ? Who all is included in managerial staff ? 
 What about the senior account managers ? Do they count ? 
 Have you any evening bus tour ? 
 I have heard of that before . When shall we start ? 
 Susan is going to get a divorce . 
 She told me that peter and she has a quarrel last nigh , and she left this morning , bag and baggage . 
 Which countries have you been to ? 
 I thought you had been to Australia too . 
 I think I ‘ d say norway . It has many picturesque fjords , waterfalls , and mountains . 
 Well , the north of Norway is almost always cold , but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . It ’ s a wet country , so there ’ s snow almost everywhere in winter . 
 Do you want to sign for a Korea language class ? 
 Right , we have located a business partner in Seoul . The first contact proves to be successful . The general manager of South Korean company has scheduled to pay a visit to us next month . I think it is quite possible to set up a joint venture company with them soon . 
 A slow sparrow should make an early start . You know , I am not quick at learning any language . 
 What do you need ? 
 He seems to be quite qualified . If it is a personal problem I preferred if you would work out between yourselves . 
 It's near the Wall Street , a bit far from there . Why not get on the car 
 Of course . More than that , you have Italy pizza , English steak , kimchi and local specialties . 
 Hello , miss . Can you bring me something to drink ? 
 Thank you for reminding me . Well , please give me a glass of brandy and I will pay for it . 
 Excuse me , waiter , would you please bring us a nest ? A friend of mine will join us . 
 By the way , we would like to order some dishes for my friend . 
 May I help you ? 
 Have you brought your receipt ? 
 I am sorry , we will change yours for a new one . 
 Since we have reached an agreement on all terms , there shouldn't be any problems for the contract . 
 Yes , I got it . Thanks . 
 It's famous for beautiful countryside with clean air . 
 Yes , sir . We offer a 10 % discount for groups more than 5 . 
 Not bad . But too hot for me today . 
 Absolutely . Who were you playing with ? 
 Really ? Oh , well , in that case we should play together some time . What's your handicap ? 
 No kidding ! I'm 16 , too . We should definitely play together some time . My name's Bob . 
 Me too . So , do you like the course ? 
 Well , they used to , but they got rid of them because of environmental concerns . 
 Actually , in my opinion , the carts were better because you don't have to tip them . 
 Possibly , but I still miss them ! What bothers me is that the heat makes the caddies ' life quite hard . One member's caddy fainted last week ! 
 Right . Luckily it was on the eighteen hole , quite near the clubhouse , so he didn't have far to carry him . 
 Yup . 
 I'd like to make a person-to-person call to Beijing , China . The number is 2135367 8 , and I want to speak to Mr . Zhang . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 My name is Luo Gang , and the phone number is 513-3284 . 
 What the number I gave you , operator ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry . should have been 2135-3668 , not 3678 . I've given you a wrong number . 
 Yes . 
 Thank you . 
 We have a great variety of Chinese antiques . Besides , we have landscape painting , figure painting and flower-and-bird painting . 
 How about this picture of cranes with pine trees ? It was painted by a famous Chinese painter in King Dynasty . 
 And what is more , in traditional Chinese thinking , cranes and pine trees symbolize longevity . 
 Of course . I always keep what I catch . 
 If it's within the legal limit , I prefer to keep it . 
 I take architecture as my major . 
 I am dealing with the study of the architecture style of ancient Chinese buildings . 
 Rather difficult . How about you ? 
 Rather . I'm afraid I didn't do very well . 
 That's because you did well . 
 Why ? 
 You seem to be in the seventh heaven . What's put you on ? 
 Did she give up her decision to marry Dick ? 
 The band is pretty good . How do you like the music ? 
 well , then , may I invite you for the next dance ? 
 don't worry . I'm not much of a dancer myself . 
 you dance beautifully too . 
 in college . But I don't dance very often . What's your favourite dance ? 
 how about tango ? 
 Tango is my favorite . Anything but hip-hop or the foxtrot . 
 my pleasure . Let's go and have a drink . 
 Morning , Peter . Nice suit ! A new one ? 
 Maybe . Several people have suggested that I get more yellow clothes . They say the color suits me because I have a fair complexion . 
 Thank you for your compliments . It sounds like you're a clothing expert . 
 I would like to make an appointment to discuss the problems I keep having with my apartment . 
 We gave you a list of problems last week . 
 Well , the garbage disposal doesn ’ t work , we have rats , and the toilet is backed up . 
 These things are your responsibility , and you need to fix them immediately . 
 If these problems are not addressed immediately , I will be contacting the health department this Friday and you will not get a rent check . 
 You are too picky . 
 Which guy ? 
 I can't see him . Where ? 
 Oh , I see him now . Wait ! That's ... 
 Oh , wow ! It's really him ! Who is that woman he's with ? 
 I can't do that . 
 I think he won't remember White Day . 
 Uh-huh . How about you ? 
 You got a big return for a small gift . 
 What does it do ? 
 Wow ! What else does it do ? 
 Cool ! Anything else ? 
 Wow ! 
 Hello , BCD Company , can I help you ? 
 This is Mrs Smith , may I have your name ? 
 Hello , Mr . Sun . 
 You are welcome , Mr . Sun . 
 You certainly made a good impression on me , as well . 
 We'll be making the decision by the end of this week and we'll contact you as soon as possible . 
 You are welcome . 
 I see , we have an explanation left on the table . If you follow the direction , it ’ s quite simple . 
 Oh , certainly . 
 Would you like to order anything else ? 
 Our waitress has been kind of scarce tonight , hasn't she ? 
 She doesn't appear to be headed this way , so I will go get the check . 
 Our total for dinner is $ 36.00 . 
 I kind of don't want to leave any tip for the lousy service we received . 
 I believe that 10 % is just about right amount . 
 How do you think people get their personalities ? 
 Don ’ t you think people get their personalities from their parents ? 
 So why do you think many kids have personalities that are so different from their parents . 
 You might be right . I guess most parents want their kids to be like them , but kids today grow up in a different environment . You know , they know much more about the world from the internet , newspapers , and tv . 
 Maybe some of it . I think a lot of people blame TV and movies when the real problem is that the parents aren ’ t bringing their child up correctly . 
 Yes , that ’ s true . Your son is doing well at school , isn ’ t he ? 
 So , he ’ s not a bookworm ? It ’ s good that he has an outgoing personality . Some kids are very quiet and introverted . You wonder they ’ ll survive in the real world without their parents to support them . 
 Well , some people use a standard set of words , but many couples today write their own wedding vows . 
 It wasn't . It was birdseed . We don't throw rice anymore because someone discovered that birds come along and eat the rice and have trouble digesting it . 
 Wait until you see what happens next ! The bride is getting ready to throw her bouquet . Let's go over and watch . 
 She ’ s my friend ’ s ten-year-old niece . I guess there won ’ t be another wedding in this family for a long time . 
 I think so ; hurry up and get off . 
 I don't know . 
 I think I was wrong . 
 I don't know ; it kind of looks like we did . 
 I'm sorry . I thought this was our stop . 
 We could always wait for the next bus to come . 
 Does all that come to 10,000 NT ? 
 Where do I sign ? 
 OK . 
 Well , the teddy bear is for me ! 
 Pam , where's the closest ATM ? 
 The big one or the small one ? 
 Yes . 
 Do you know if there's a convenience store around here ? 
 I really need to get some things before I leave . 
 Can I take the subway to get there ? 
 Won't that be expensive ? 
 Hi Wei , what are you going to do this weekend ? 
 Oh right ... How about Sunday ? 
 Oh really ? I ’ ll come along with you if that ’ s ok . 
 Oh great , I ’ ll see you there ! 
 Yes . My eyes are small so I want to buy false eyelashes . 
 Can you recommend me one ? 
 Hello , who is speaking , please ? 
 Oh , good . Let me get a pencil and take down the information . Well , go ahead , please . 
 What time does it leave ? 
 That is good . 
 That's right . 
 Those are in the non-smoking section , aren't they ? 
 Fine , thank you very much . 
 Sure . They are my kids , Alex and Kathy Stern . 
 Thanks . 
 Working conditions are very relaxed . You may work whatever hours you want , provided you get your job done properly . 
 Would you mind changing the position or working place you've applied for ? 
 did you go to university ? 
 when did you graduate ? 
 I just graduated from high school . 
 I'd like to get a BA , but I don't know where I should go . 
 yes , I've applied to four universities and have been accepted into all of them . 
 the tuition is the same for all of them . 
 I think the course at Leeds University is interesting , but I think the one at Manchester University would be more practical . 
 I'd really like to be in London , but it's the most expensive city in England to live in , so I don't know if I can afford to live there . 
 not yet . 
 that's a good idea . 
 I'm so thirsty . 
 That's a good idea . 
 I kind of want a soda . 
 What do you mean ? 
 What are you supposed to drink ? 
 I guess I will get water . 
 Good morning , Oriental Electric Limited . 
 That is all right . Maybe we can make another arrangement . 
 I'm afraid there is a bit of a problem . in fact , he has booked up the whole week except tomorrow afternoon . 
 Please let me check ... Tomorrow afternoon ... Yes , he'll be free from 3:00 tomorrow afternoon . Do you think it's convenient for you ? 
 All right . Let's change it . Tomorrow afternoon at three . I am going to schedule it for that time and inform Mr.Liu about the change . 
 See you . 
 Yes , we have a nice room on the sixth floor . 
 200 yuan a night . 
 Yes . And could I have your name ? 
 How long do you want to stay ? 
 Sure . We'll be there in a few minutes . 
 We'd like to . You may call the attendant if you need any help . 
 Why not ! It ’ s a classic . In fact , it ’ s one of my favorite novels . 
 Don ’ t judge a book by its cover . Do you Kwon what it ’ s about ? 
 First of all , it ’ s a romance novel , set in the early 19th century . 
 It ’ s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls . 
 Since he doesn ’ t have a son , he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . That way , all of his daughters will be cared for . 
 No , that ’ s the problem . Though they are well-off , once he dies , his house will go to his cousin . So , when he dies , the girls will have nothing . 
 So , are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ? 
 That ’ s probably because she wants you to read the book first . 
 How about this . When you finish the book . I ’ ll get the movie and watch it with you . 
 Can I take this bus to city center ? 
 The Empire Hotel . 
 Well . I think I will wait . 
 the chef is going to slice it into thin pieces . There will be around one hundred and twenty pieces of both skin and meat for each . 
 absolutely . It is said that they serve 3,000 ducks every day . 
 oh , they are pancakes , hollowed sesame buns , scallions , cucumbers and oisin sauce . I will show you how to make one . 
 Just roll it up and have a bite , Amy . 
 certainly . First , a Beijing duck is specially selected . After it is cleaned and dressed , it will be roasted in an open oven . Only wood of fruit trees are used to fuel the fire to give the duck a unique 
 Yes , Amy , please have some more . 
 The current owners will be moving out on Tuesday , so technically you could pick up the keys and move in on Wednesday . 
 You need to contact the utility company and make arrangements to transfer the utilities to your name . 
 If I were you , I would take a few days to take care of those things before you move in . 
 That would be perfect . That way , someone will be there , but you will have them right away . 
 I think that I have something else really important to do on that day . I just can ’ t remember what it is . 
 You should ask for a holiday and relax yourself for a little bit . You worked so hard . 
 Can I also take the MET to get there ? 
 No , can I trouble you to lend me a hand ? 
 You have to buy a ticket first . You want to go to Shi Da , right ? 
 Ok , then you need to go to Tai Power Building Station . 
 Look at the map to see where you are . Then look at where you want to go . The number is how much money you have to pay . 
 Then , when you have your ticket , you go wait on the platform . 
 Just remember to hold on to your ticket . You need it to get out of the station when you get there . 
 The bank closes in 30 minutes and I need to cash a check . 
 Thanks . But it's necessary for me to buy a TV set . 
 You can take me to the bank if you want to . 
 If you're observant you'll see rare birds , insects , butterflies , and a few reptiles . But you must look for them . There are also a few am-phibians in lower places . 
 Huh ! I am really out-of-shape , Why aren't you out-of-breath ? 
 How can you say that ? But , you could give me a piggyback the rest of the way . 
 Here's 30 yuan for my ticket . 
 No , you can't do that . 
 Hello . I have left my key in my room . But I can't get in now . 
 I am Molopo and my room is 5022 . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Yes , unlikely my flight will be 2 hours due to the fog . Would you please keep my reservation ? 
 Lincoln . That's L-I-N-C-O-L-N . Thank you . 
 Why ? 
 It's July 7th . Chinese Valentine's Day ! 
 I thought you had trouble with Clive ! 
 Poor guy ! It's not fair . You forgot it too . 
 Wow ! Good timing . 
 Come on . Two is company . 
 It's Valentine's Day . Come on . Just go . 
 Do I have to get up now ? 
 What are you talking about ? The alarm hasn't even gone off yet . 
 I must have slept right through it . 
 Just let me sleep five more minutes . 
 Yes , please have a seat , and we ’ ll discuss this right now . 
 The counter-offer was acceptable to them , but they want you to pay for the home inspection . 
 It can cost as little as five hundred dollars and as much as one thousand dollars . 
 Yes , it is your choice as you are paying for it . Make a wise investment and choose the best inspector you can find . 
 Let ’ s call them right now . I am sure that they will be happy to hear that you have agreed to pay for the inspection . 
 I need a phone card for this new cell phone . 
 It's for my daughter who is still a senior high school student . 
 What's special with the service ? 
 That's nice . And I need a pre-paid phone card . 
 Oh , good . Then what is it ? 
 May I have two of them ? 
 Okay , then a third one for my husband too . 
 Good morning . Thank you . 
 Yes . I have written for several top newspapers in the country . I ’ m also in the process of writing my first novel . 
 We scored six goals . 
 And I score three of them . 
 We had extra time of course . 
 Were you able to get a look at the suspect's face ? 
 I must ask you to pick him out of a line-up . 
 Look closely at the five men in this line-up . 
 Do you see the suspect ? 
 What number is the suspect ? 
 Thank you for all your help . 
 Come on . All of us are waiting for you . 
 Excuse me , but please empty your pockets of all the metal things and put them in this tray . 
 Yes , and please step over there . 
 Just open your bags so we can check them . After that you can pick them up right behind that X-ray machine . 
 That's all right . This machine will not damage the film . 
 Can I have your boarding pass ? We need to stamp it . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes . Here is your boarding pass . 
 How do you like this one ? It's nice and cheap It's only thirty-four dollars . 
 Sorry . I think that's the cheapest 
 Yes . you can The fitting room is right over there . 
 Shall we sing with a karaoke ? 
 For us , karaoke is becoming a popular entertainment . 
 I can not agree with you more . And if you are an awful one , that will be funny . 
 Is that true ? Shall we invite him to join with us ? 
 Flowers for my favorite girl . 
 That's a secret . Here , let me help you with your coat , and we'll be on our way .

 Really ? Thank you . I am thinking the same thing about you . 
 Did you hear who won the election ? 
 I couldn ’ t be happier to know that he ’ s our new President . 
 You voted for him , right ? 
 I voted for him . 
 So am I . 
 I have faith in him . 
 When the interview finally comes to an end , the interviewee will probably breathe a sigh of relief . 
 At this moment you can thank the interviewer again for the opportunity of the interview . 
 Don't forget to ask when you can receive a reply . 
 You should state politely that you will wait for the results patiently . 
 In this case , you should remember to give thanks for the reply you get . 
 Just say goodbye to the interviewer before you leave . 
 I hate this kind of weather ! 
 I think he had water on the brain . This is bad . 
 Okay , Pollyanna , what's so good about this weather ? 
 We ' get ' to stay home ? Do you know something that I don't ? 
 Could you do something to advance your time of shipment ? 
 I hope you'll try to convince them to step up production . 
 Well , in that case , there is nothing more to be said . What's your last word as to the date then ? 
 All right . I'll take you at your word . May I suggest that you put down in the contract shipment on October 15th or earlier ? Our letter of credit will be opened early September . 
 That's very considerate of you . And now , shall we discuss the insurance terms ? 
 I suppose the additional premium for the special coverage is for the buyer's account . 
 Then what about SICC ( Strikes , Riots and Civil Commotions ) ? Can we request you to cover this for our imports ? 
 Then please cover W . P . A . and TEND for this transaction . 
 I'm so busy . I don't know how will get this done . 
 Well , that's all for the interview . Thank you for your interest in this job . 
 May I call you about our final decision ? 
 We will get in touch with you by the end of next week . 
 We'll notify you if necessary . Goodbye . 
 Thanks for your help . 
 Let me know if I can do anything for you . 
 Did you see the letter I got from Bradford Films ? They sent it in response to your phone call last week . 
 I guess they must not have your contact information , so they sent it addressed in care of your department head . Anyhow , they wrote to confirm in writing what you discussed about the Milton contract . 
 Sure , here it is ... 
 Did they ask you to send the files beforehand ? 
 I don't think so , why do you ask ? 
 Maybe they forgot to attach it to the letter . You should give them another call . 
 What's that supposed to mean — that it's weak ? 
 Mmm ! Beer , tequila , and ... lime ! 
 Fresh tomatoes , green and white onions ... 
 Front desk . May I help you ? 
 Yes . Sure . You do have storage service . When will be checking out tomorrow ? 
 Shall we arrange a bail boy to pick up your luggage at nine o ’ clock ? 
 May I have your room number please ? 
 1218 . we ’ ll collect your luggage at nine o ’ clock tomorrow . Would you then come to the front desk to get your storage receipt please ? 
 You ’ re welcome . Good-Bye . 
 Oh , I thought I did a good job . 
 Anyway , I have to face the music this time . 
 No , that would be too expensive . We used the train system.We bought a special pass called a Enrail pass . It lets people use the train wherever they want , as often as they want . 
 Yes , they do . I wish we Americans had a better train system . 
 I agree . And probably the automobile companies are too powerful.They never allowed the government to develop trains . 
 Americans love cars for different reasons , I think.One reason is that we are very individualistic.And cars are a very individual way of getting around.Americans like the freedom of driving around by themselves.They don't want to ride in a train or bus with a group of people . 
 Why do you say " have to " ? 
 Maybe you're right . They will have to develop alternative transportation.But it will be hard in America . Too many people are used to cars.Even in our movies cars are very important . 
 Do you want me to give you a ride ? 
 Alright.Well , I'll stay here and have another coffee . Nice running into you . 
 You're made a good choice . This china tea set is unusual . 
 It was made in Jingdezhen . 
 You are right . 
 It is the best quality porcelain-the famous egg-shell China . 
 But it is really worth the price . 
 Yes , madam , how much would you like to remit ? 
 Which would you like to remit , by mail or by cable ? 
 The cable will take less time for your account , in the meantime , the regular service charge is also higher than that of the mail one . 
 OK , please fill in the application form giving the name and address of beneficiary , your name and telephone . 
 Everything is OK . The commission is 50 yuan . 
 Mr . Emory ? I think it ’ s time to get a new computer . 
 For the amount of work we do on the computer these days , the one we ’ re using is just too weak . We really need a higher model . 
 Would you mind if I ask some personal questions ? 
 Are you in robust health ?

 Dear , can you drive me to the clinic ? 
 Why ? 
 Could it be the battery ? 
 Well , I suppose it could be the gas . 
 Perhaps it's the starter then ? 
 Did you happen to bring that book that we were talking about yesterday ? 
 Thanks so much . 
 I had no idea that there were specific things that should be given on different anniversaries . 
 It says that traditionally , give something made of paper . 
 How about your grades of study ? 
 Well . In that case , you must have got good records in English , too . 
 How about your oral English ? 
 Hi , this is Ralph Simmons . With whom am I speaking ? 
 I ’ m hoping you can sort a few things out for me . Could you pull up my account ? 
 what are you listening to ? Is that Beethoven or Mozart ? 
 I think Beethoven's music is incredible . I've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent , too . Do you believe that ? 
 what other kind of music do you listen to ? 
 to be honest , I think classical music is too complicated for me . 
 I like pop music . Do you ? 
 I see what you mean . I think that's way I like it so much . 
 I've always been into it . Have you always liked classical music ? 
 so , how did you become interested in it ? 
 do you still play piano ? 
 Finance , Angie speaking . 
 Yes , Mr . Reynolds . They were approved yesterday . You can pick up the check today . 
 I'm not satisfied with it . 
 Sometimes it goes fast . And sometimes it goes slow . And the alarm doesn'twork , either . 
 No . Can I have my money back ? 
 A receipt ? 
 Oh , I'm not certain , but I think I've lost it . 
 Yes . I'd like to make a reservation to New York for 18th next month . 
 How long is that journey ? 
 Thank you . 
 But there're some mare's tails . 
 Oh , really , I thought it was a sign of rain . 
 Table tennis . 
 Not really , but I like watching . 
 Aah ! Close your eyes . You aren't supposed to see this . 
 You can't peek ! This is a surprise . 
 Here's one little hint . If you don't go out right now , this won't be under the tree . 
 And please shut the door and lock it behind you ! 
 Well , if you want to look professional , serious and more conservative , a blue dress , white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice . But sometimes , very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . It depends on the company ’ s dress code . 
 Whatever you choose , make sure they are neat and clean . 
 Of course , my grandpa is generous and kind.My grandma cooks the most delicious Chinese dishes in the world . 
 What upsets you ? 
 It is not your mother finding one for you ? 
 Perhaps you can try the three minutes date , the latest type . 
 No , there is an updated version , three minutes video date . I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes . 
 I think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone , so-called love at first sight . 
 Don ’ t worry . There are many other options using the internet as dating methods . Some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications . 
 I don ’ t want to post my personal information on the internet . I ’ m not knowing who is reading it . 
 Josh and I were just on our way back home from the beach and thought we'd drop by . 
 Yes , it has been a long time since we have seen you . 
 Oh no , thank you . We aren't all that thirsty . 
 No , thank you , we just ate lunch a little while ago . 
 Everyone is doing great . My sister finally had her baby . 
 Better take the subway . It ’ s faster , and more convenient . 
 Just go to the ticket office in the subway . 
 No , you don ’ t have to . Here comes the train . Be careful ! Subway doors open and close automatically . 
 Don ’ t ever mention him . I ’ m getting over it . 
 Are you done ? 
 Yes , I ’ m afraid I am . My husband is a smoker too . 
 No . But my husband smokes 20 or more a day . 
 I had my first cigarette when I was 17 . 
 Yes . Twice . 
 Let me check . Oh , oh ! It ’ s at 3:25 . 
 It's at ... gate 14 . 
 OK , so here's the plan ; When we land , run to gate 14 ! 
 What are you going to do for one year abroad , Tom ? 
 You are going to take courses ? 
 Sounds hard . 
 Won ’ t you get lonely ? 
 These vegetables taste very sweet . 
 Really ? Dad , how do you know how to plant organic vegetable ? 
 Dad , come on ! Just tell me . 
 I hate to see the abuse of animals .

 How much is your last salary ? 
 How much do you want us to pay you ? 
 I am not sure what to do during the holidays , any suggestions ? 
 The problem is that I find all of them are full of fun . I just don ’ t know what to do first . 
 Actually , I ’ m interested in all of them . The more choices we have , the harder to make a decision . 
 You ’ re free to leave . 
 What are you planning on doing now ? 
 What are you going to major in ? 
 I don ’ t want to see you back here . 
 I don ’ t think this place is for you . 
 I wish you luck .

 Do you want to borrow my coat ? I have a black coat that would look smashing on you . 
 Well , no one could survive without water , but you see pollution has been making more and more water unable for drinking . 
 But what are the sources of water pollution ? 
 Well , direct ones are the pollution directly from factories , refineries waste treatment plants etc . , aren ’ t they ? 
 But what about the indirect ones ? 
 I see . For the sake of us all , we should be an active participator in the prevention of it . 
 I'm about to run out of business cards . I need some new ones . 
 Two thousand should get me through the year . 
 My old card is perfect , so all I want you to do is copy it exactly . 
 ... Here you go 
 I'm sorry , but can you give me a three-day turnaround ? 
 How about your present pay ? 
 What are your salary expectations ? 
 Don't be too sad . If you really think that you have no feeling with him , then , in my opinion , getting divorced maybe is the best way to solve the problem . 
 Yeah , child is the matter . Don't tell Jenny the truth , only tell her the white lie . When she grows up , you find the suitable opportunity to tell her . 
 Good morning , sir . Can I see your boarding pass , please ? 
 Excuse me , sir . This is your passport . 
 Yes . As a matter of fact , you can't board the plane without boarding pass . 
 I'm sorry sir . I can't let you pass . 
 Ugh , in about thirty minutes , sir . 
 Calm down , sir . You are creating a commotion . 
 Could be . 
 Would you please put that cigarette out ? I get sick on it . 
 Thank you SO much . 
 What ? 
 I ’ m sorry ? ! 
 This is Mrs Smith . Can I help you ?

 Ok , I will . Do you have any question ? 
 Goodbye . 
 What ? You don ’ t know the first thing about gardening ! 
 Oh yeah ? Tell me then , smarty pants , how will you go about setting up your garden ? 
 What type of tools ? 
 Right . Well it seems like you have all your bases covered . What ’ s next ? 
 Well , good luck with your garden , especially considering we are in the dry season and it won ’ t rain for the next three months !

 What kind of strong suit do you get ? 
 Do you want to be an instructor in the future ? 
 I've been thinking of taking I've been thinking of taking a Crazy English course.Do you think it's a good idea 
 Really ? Do you think English is that important ? 
 Great ! It's always better to do things with a friend . 
 No , I left it at home.Sorry ! 
 So , do you want to go somewhere for dinner and practice our English together tonight ?

 Forget it ! That's what friends are for ! Besides , I have a VIP card for a discount . 
 I think so too.Let ' s go ! 
 Can you stay for dinner ? We'd love to have you join us . 
 Mr . Mass , here is a gift for you . 
 It's a souvenir I bought for you from Rome . 
 I'm glad you like it . 
 Don't mention it . Just a little thing I did . 
 I live in Haitian District where there are lot of universities . 
 I live at No . 50 Xingu Street . 
 May I see the agreement first ? 
 ( Read the agreement . ) There's a three-month period of probation for new recruits . 
 I think I know it . I wonder whether the agreement has the guarantee of law or not . 
 ( Sign . ) OK , I signed the agreement with the signature of my name . 
 I see . Thank you very much . 
 Did you already wash your clothes today ? 
 Could you wash some of my dark clothes with yours ? 
 The only thing is that they have to be washed on the gentle cycle . 
 There aren't a lot of clothes , do you have a lot to wash ? 
 You don't mind , do you ? 
 Okay , thanks a lot . 
 These two sections need to be re-written , Jerry . The last guy that did this really mixed things up . 
 Not until next week , I think , the 15th . 
 What fruits are in season right now ? 
 Can I sample a grape ? 
 It tastes good . How much are the grapes per kilo ? 
 So Emily , do you still want to see a movie together this weekend ? 
 Mmmm ... I know ! We can go to a really bad sci-fi movie and sit in the back of the theater and make fun of it . What do you think ? 
 Hey Annie , who is this picture of ? 
 I think you can say your seventh great grandfather ! Cutie ! What's his name ? 
 Nice pun . What is it you active about him most ? 
 He looks like a very personable man . 
 I visited the Polar Aquarium today . 
 Almost . There are a lot of polar animals sea birds , such as seals , whales and penguins , People don't get much chance of seeing them . 
 Absolutely . To be frank , I learned quite a lot about those animals and polar areas . I'm thinking of my kids there one of these days . 
 Hi ! Wang Mei.Come and have a look at my new dress . 
 Thank you for saying so . 
 I bought it in a store near my school . 
 It's only thirty yuan . 
 I'll go together with you . 
 The exact time ? Let me think . You know , it happened at night . 
 Oh , I remember . It was about 10 o'clock . When I was about to go to bed , suddenly I heard help outside . 
 Hello , Karl . I ’ m Chuck Jones . We ’ re going to be neighbors . 
 This is a small town , and we like to be neighborly . We know everyone who lives around here . 
 So , tell me , Karl , hyoid you come all the way to Minnesota to live ? 
 It looks to be a nice day today . 
 Okay , I'll get the car out of the garage . 
 Waiter , come here please . Could we have a doggie bag ? 
 do you like cooking , Julia ? 
 how often do you usually cook ? 
 that's a lot of cooking . You must save a lot of money by eating at home so much . 
 what kind of dishes do you usually make ? 
 do you make a lot of traditional British food ? 
 how about spicy food ? 
 what's your favorite dish to make ? 
 Did you go to the bank to withdraw money ? 
 So you didn ’ t . Is that right ? 
 Why didn ’ t you just answer my question directly ? Why would Chinese answer questions this way ? I simply asked if you did it or not . It ’ s a very simple question . And Chinese often give the reason before they would give a direct answer . 
 You know , today I asked a student if he brought his dictionary with him . It ’ s a rule I made for the class that everyone brings a bilingual dictionary with them because sometimes they don ’ t understand me . The funniest thing is that this student gave me a lot of reasons and no direct answer . 
 Yeah , after all the explanations like , it ’ s too heavy , I was in a hurry ... whatever . 
 Lily , I ’ m not sure . Let me check , I think I spent $ 50 . 
 I know that I should learn how to save more , but I hope that we can spend a little on ourselves sometimes . 
 That ’ s okay . I ’ m sorry , too . It ’ s a good idea to prepare for the future possibilities . 
 It's a little like being a mom , only I get paid for it ! 
 That's exactly why my business is doing so well ! 
 Well , I've been in business for one month now and I have ten clients . 
 If you ever need a job , let me know . I can always train you . 
 That sounds great . I'm absolutely starving ! What kind of food are you in the mood for ? 
 You're a woman after my own heart . I don't know many people who can handle spicy food . Are you sure you are up for hotpot . 
 Ok , you're really all eyes when it comes to talking about food , aren't you ? 
 Let me think about it for a minute . Let's see ... oh the name of the restaurant is on the tip of my tongue ! Give me a second and it'll come to me . 
 No ... 
 That's it ! That's the one I was thinking of ! I told you I'd remember it ! 
 Is it Fred's fault ? 
 But he's equally responsible because he tried to overtake you . 
 Cash . 
 Thank you . 
 It ’ s an article about language . It talks about the idea of having a single global language . 
 Actually , it suggest English . The main argument is that English is already being studied as a second language in most countries-china , India , mexico , Nigeria , Pakistan , and japan . So beginning again with a language like Esperanto would be wasteful . The second argument is that English is used in modern technology far more that any other language . Most emails are sent in English and the vast majority of website use English . 
 The article points out that many languages have been lost and will be lost , but others will continue to be used for generation , even if English continues to be the dominant language . 
 Exactly . The article suggests that those languages will be used , but that they will only rarely be used in international communication between non-native speakers . 
 I hear that you've been to the Saikei Ski Resort for the weekend . Did you enjoy it ? 
 Isn't there any coach to teach you how to ski ? 
 Could you move smoothly ? 
 What happened afterwards ? 
 Poor girl ! 
 Thank you . Is that a window table ? 
 It's very nice of you . 
 Yes , I do . The look of a picture is very important . 
 You wouldn't know a good movie even if it bit you on the nose . 
 Enough ! If we don't finish the game , there won't be time for any movies tonight ! 
 Here you are . We've ironed them for you already . Please check and see if there is any damage . 
 I'm terribly sorry . You know we are so busy today and we forget to sew the button back on . Please wait a moment . It will be ready soon . 
 Would you like to have a look ? Is it to your satisfaction ? 
 It doesn't seem like that . Sorry , sir , we've tried everything , but we're not able to get it off the shirt . It was from the sugar I think . 
 Yes , the sugar was burnt during the dry-cleaning process . And there you go . 
 I am awfully sorry . Please tell us about the stains before the dry-cleaning next time . 
 This is a membership card . You can get a 20 percent discount next time . 
 Hope to see you again . We will provide the best service . 
 A cheap day return ticket ? 
 That'll be twelve pounds . 
 Are you serious ? 
 But why ? Did I do anything wrong ? 
 Hey , come on . It ’ s too early to say that . We can fix things . 
 But I still love you . 
 I knew this would happen some day ... 
 Well . It ’ s not all my fault , Anna ... 
 I would like that Anna , but I think I ’ ll need a little space for a bit . 
 Shall we keep pur friendship ?

 Did somebody hit you ? Or did you just fall ? 
 Hey , what's good with you ? 
 I'm throwing a party on Friday . 
 Do you think you can come ? 
 What are you going to be doing ? 
 I was hoping you would come . 
 I'd better see you there . 
 What do you like to do with your free time ? 
 You mean you like to study English ? Why ? 
 Studying English wouldn't give me any satisfaction.It ' s hard work . 
 May I help you ? 
 May I do anything else for you ? 
 I can ’ t let you do that . 
 Our policy doesn ’ t allow anyone to check out the magazines . 
 You are only allowed to check out books or videos . 
 I ’ m sorry , but that ’ s our policy . 
 Hi , Linda . I haven't seen you for ages . 
 So do I . 
 Yes . I graduated last year and got a job in a press . 
 Well , since we're collecting gifts instead of red envelopes , I made a " for guests only " gift chat room . 
 The Taiwanese won't have time to buy gifts in America . The chat room is more convenient . 
 Or discuss what gifts they could buy together . 
 We can also put a guest book on the website for people to sign and write comments . 
 Yeah , that will be the best part . Jack hasn't seen yours yet , right ? 
 It's time for you to wake up . 
 I'm sorry , but it's time for you to get ready for school . 
 You're not going to get up in five minutes if I let you fall back asleep . 
 There's a lot that you need to do this morning . 
 I would like for you to not be late for school . 
 Go back to sleep then , but only five more minutes . 
 Well , how does it look ? 
 Let me pay for it now . 
 I think I'll use my credit card . 
 Here's my John Hancock . 
 Can you look after my son for me tonight ? 
 Yes , sir ? 
 I'm very sorry.sir . I'll ask the manager to take care of this . 
 Yes , I ‘ d love to . it ’ s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good . 
 Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . Which films do you think will win awards this year ? 
 You ’ re right . This year should be much more exciting than usual . What ’ s you favourite award category ? 
 It ’ s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood . I like the best actor and actress . 
 Let me see . Are dimes and quarters OK ? 
 Then you'll need small change . 
 Yes , I just wondered why the price between the ninth and tenth floor is so different . 
 Oh ! I see . Can you show me the location of Block I ? 
 How many elevators are there ? 
 How about the car-park space ? 
 Any other facilities ? 
 What is the completion date ? 
 How about the price and the bank mortgage ? 
 How many payment methods are there ? 
 Thank you . I think I have to talk to the bank representatives . Thank you for your help . 
 I decided to go for this kind of life . 
 I know . I always hope for the best and prepare for the worst . 
 Good morning , sir . Sorry to disturb you . May I make up your room now ? 
 No problems , sir . Everything will be already when you come back . 
 Oh , thank God . We all felt frightened by the bad new about him . 
 Right . Unless , who know what will happen . 
 Excuse me , professor . I need to go home now . 
 I just feel funny . 
 I have a terrible headache . 
 I already have some medicine at home if I could just get there . 
 Thank you , but the bus stops right at my house . 
 Hello , 35 .. 
 Speaking . 
 I am sorry . I am very tired . I'm going to bed early . 
 No , I ’ m sorry . I'm going to meet some friends tomorrow evening . And I'm in a hurry now . 
 What would you like to have for dinner ? Chicken or beef ? 
 Good choice ! 
 Well , we have all kinds of beverages in addition to fruit juices . 
 Anything else ? 
 Another flight attendant is coming down the aisle with coffee and tea . 
 Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look . 
 Look at that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that . 
 You are right . But what if an avalanche happened ? 
 Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow here ? 
 Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ? 
 hi , Lander . What's wrong ? 
 same here . I have't brought any new clothes for three months . 
 true . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities . 
 the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken . 
 inflation is more than just the rising prices , I guess . But the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation . 
 yes . The government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy . 
 you said it . I think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending . 
 for a start , we can take the public transport to work . You know , running a car is a big expense . 
 Could you call Mr . Jacob for me , Sara ? I need to go over some stuff with him . 
 Sure , it ’ s 4-8- 7-2 . Don ’ t worry . You ’ re doing a fine job . 
 Tom ? Oh , it's been a while since we've talked to each other . Nice to hear you again . 
 Really ? 
 Why didn't she call me ? 
 Well , I may have stayed on the phone too long . Can you give me her number ? I'll call her later . 
 Thanks . So how are things with you ? 
 Wow ! Great ! Where ? 
 Yeah , it's really convenient . The theater and Shopping Mall are within walking distance . Well , I got to go . I'll get in touch with you soon . 
 Don't worry . Bye . 
 Yes , we have many kinds of pies and puddings . 
 Sure . We have lemon pies , apple pies , coffee rum pies and ice cream . 
 I ’ d like to have this cashed , please . 
 Yes . 
 Ten hundreds and Ten Twenties and the rest of small changes please . 
 What did you say your stop was ? 
 Oh , then you should have gotten off at the last stop . 
 But don't worry . You can get off at the next stop and walk back . It's not far . 
 Yes , I live in that house with my parents and my sister . 
 Do you take your dog for a walk every day ? 
 And I take the dog for a walk every Wednesday , Thursday and Friday . 
 On Saturday we all go to the park and the dog comes with us . 
 My mum and my sister do the housework and cooking but I clean my room . 
 Right over here , sir . What size do you wear ? 
 These here are all mediums . 
 Shall I gift-wrap them for you , sir ? 
 Hi , I think I was supposed to call for my test results today . 
 Are you saying that there weren ’ t any problems ? 
 Will I be able to read the results on the website and understand them ? 
 How will I know what the numbers mean ? 
 How can I see test results from tests I have taken before ? 
 When and where were you born ? 
 You look so young . 
 Elaine ’ s back from school . I think it might be a nice gesture if you asked her out . I suppose she ’ s not good enough for you , is that it ? 
 How do you know ? You haven ’ t seen her since high school . I guess your evenings , whatever you do with them , are just too valuable . 
 I guess I ’ ll just have to tell Mr . Robinson that you ’ re too busy every evening – doing God knows what ... God don ’ t go on like this . If you absolutely refuse to take her out ... 
 Then I will simply have to invite all the Robinson ’ s over for dinner on Thursday . 
 I am a graduate of a technical university and have been employed as a technician with Company or approximately 10 years . 
 I am looking for a growth opportunity , which I feel is not available at my current employer . In terms of skills , I am Microsoft certified in Windows XP and several other operating system 
 I see myself in a management position . 
 I just found out that my husband is cheating on me . 
 That's what I thought . It seems that he's been seeing someone else for about two months . 
 I asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . I picked it up and a girl asked to talk to Mark . She then asked if I was his sister , and I said no , I was his wife . She hung up immediately . 
 Yeah , he first said it was someone from work . He gave me a lame excuse , and so I pressed him on it . 
 He kept trying to make stupid excuses , and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion . 
 I told him I would divorce him if he wouldn ’ t tell me the truth or end the relationship with her . 
 hi , Natasha , how's life ? 
 oh , you must be very happy . How many people are there in your family ? 
 I have a small family . They are my parents , my younger brother and me . 
 yes , it did . But my parents are ethnic minority people . It's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children . 
 the child must feel very longly . My younger brother is 10 years younger than me . Before he was born , I used to be the only child and always dreamed that I would have a younger sister or brother one da 
 yes , we are very close . He is 12 years old and very smart . He always makes us laugh a lot . 
 thank you . 
 Hello . Is that Nicholas ? 
 Never ! Do you know his new number ? 
 Yes , I do . Go on . 
 4945939 . Marvellous ! Thanks for your help . 
 Yes.what can I do for you ? 
 Fine , what time do you want to get up ? 
 Mr . Lee , I was wondering if you and your wife had plans for next Friday night ? 
 I've mailed a formal written invitation to your home inviting you to a dinner party at my home . 
 Actually , we thought it would be fun to have a formal sit-down dinner for the holidays . 
 Yes , we've invited four other couples , so it should be a good mix of people . 
 Oh yes , everyone we are inviting is from our company . 
 What do you think of the acting of the two main actors in the film ? 
 Well , I'm afraid not . I think the hero has much more to be believed in . 
 Sure , I used to work there . Go straight for about a mile , then turn left at the light . The mall will be on the right . 
 Yes , the address is 541 Main street . 
 No problem . 
 No , that way is longer . There are more stop lights on that street . 
 Excuse me , do you have any English songs ? 
 Great , thanks . 
 Oh , I see . 
 I want to have a picnic with my friends , Mum . 
 OK , Mum . I'll invite my friends home . 
 How did you know that ? I heart Tom ’ s father didn ’ t agree with that . 
 It ’ s great . Although his father didn ’ t agree with that , Tom went through with it . 
 Why don't you have dinner with me tonight ? 
 Let's say about 6:00 ? 
 What are in this folder ? 
 Are they filed alphabetically ? 
 Can you find last month ’ s report for me , please ? 
 Hello , can I help you ? 
 What dress size do you wear ? 
 This dress is the latest fashion form Paris . It ’ s made of pure silk . And this silk blouse would go with this skirt . Do you like it ? 
 Why don ’ t you try it on and see how you feel about it ? 
 How does that feel ? 
 You look wonderful . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 It's a small . 
 It has never been worn . It was too small for me so I'm selling it . 
 I got it as a gift so I couldn't take it back . Good luck ! I hope it will fit you ! 
 Once in a while . 
 Yes , I ’ d like to reserve a room . 
 From April 16th to 20th . Just my wife and myself . 
 A Twin , please . 
 Ok , I ’ ll take it . 
 Sure . May name is Aaron Johnson , and my phone number is 3242-5827 . 
 It ’ s double A , R , O , N . 
 Around 9 p . m . 
 Fine . Do you accept American Express ? 
 It ’ s 134986 
 That was a nice funeral . 
 The son gave a nice speech about his father . 
 I think it was about 45 minutes long . 
 I liked it . 
 Do you think anyone will come to my funeral ? 
 I think only the family will be there . 
 Excuse me , is this the Guyon Travel Agency ? 
 I want to travel to the ancient town in the south of China . Would you please tell me something about it ? 
 Wonderful . That's just what I expect , where is my first place if I go there ? 
 How long does the tour take ? 
 what's the cost ? 
 I know . Thank you very much . 
 Thank you . 
 The dinner was really good . It knocked my socks off . 
 Great . Sweet wines are my favorite . They always make a great finish to a decisions meal . 
 Port , please . 
 The port is quite exquisite . It must have spent years aging in barrels . Am I right ? 
 Next time we are about to dinner we should try some Canadian ice wine . 
 It's made from naturally frozen grapes . 
 OK , here's to your health . 
 Cheers . 
 Nothing doing . 
 It can be solved by drawing a draft on us at 90 days sight . 
 All right . But we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us . 
 Then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . You know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible . 
 So do I . 
 Don't get up so late next time . You should have gone to bed earlier last night . 
 Did you hear who won the English speech contest ? 
 It's George . 
 Hey , look ! They ’ re playing reruns of the 1996 Olympics . 
 He completed the first 200 / 400 double in Olympic history ! 
 Carl won the gold in the 100 , 200 , long jump , and 4x100 relay in 1984 . 
 Would you mind taking your feet off the table , Mike ? 
 Do you put your feet on your own table ? 
 Why not ? 
 Well , will you please put them down ? 
 I forgot something on the table . 
 Hello , China Southern Airlines . Can I help you ? 
 Sorry , there is no flight available on July 21st . 
 I can give you a reservation on flight No CZ 387 on July 22nd . 
 It departs at 12:10 and arrives at 15:10 next day . 
 Yes . 
 Would you prefer first class or economy class ? 
 And your name , please ? 
 Mr . Smith , you can get things fixed through our agencies in Guangzhou . Do remember to bring your passport with you . 
 Bye . 
 It's unbelievable ! They are only married for one month . Then who is at fault ? 
 Do you think they'll become reconciled ? 
 What a shame ! Their marriage is really a mistake . 
 That would be very nice . Only that I ’ ll be a little late . Is that OK ? 
 So will I . Thank you . 
 Things are going well for me , Dr . Smith . 
 Yes , I am applying for new health insurance , and I need a physical examination to qualify . 
 I ’ Ve been having a little trouble breathing . Would you look into that , please ? 
 I would appreciate it . When you give me a blood test , what are you looking for ? 
 I am expecting the tests to go well . I have been taking good care of myself . 
 Sure . May I see your receipt ? 
 That's right . Try it on . 
 Really ? Let me see . 
 He must be an experienced accountant . 
 Great minds think alike . 
 Tired and stressed . This wedding is giving me a headache . 
 I'm worried that everything will be chaotic ! 
 You're going to have to tell them what to do in church , what everything means ... 
 I can't find proper parking space . 
 No , there's no parking sign . 
 Hey John , did you register for classes yet ? 
 What classes do you plan on taking ? 
 Is that class really that popular ? 
 What other classes are you going to take ? 
 I took that class already . There is a lot of writing , but it's not that bad . 
 I had Professor Mahoney . 
 I'm not sure if he is or not , but I thought he was definitely fair . 
 Not at all . I got a 3.8 . 
 I got a 4.0 in that class . 
 It's not what it appears . I actually tried harder in the 101 class . If I put as much effort into the 201 class , I would have received the same grade . 
 Could I have a word with you ? 
 I am disappointed with your work lately . 
 Have you got any hobbies ? 
 Which is easier to learn ? 
 Does she make any sense to you ? 
 She's speaking French , not Greek . 
 Me neither . All I have to do is study French hard . 
 Mr . Smith . could you give me your quotation for your bicycle A5 , FOB Qingdao ? 
 100 for immediate delivery , and 500 in two months time.that ' s by the end of July 
 Since this is a sizeable order , I was thinking you might give us a 5 % discount . 
 Only 3 % ? That's not much . If you could make some concessions , we would probably buy some of your other products . 
 I think I can accept that . 
 Why do you listen to rap ? 
 Heavy metal music is a lot different from rap music.You can dance to heavy metal . 
 I can't dance to it . And I know you can't either . Because I've seen you try . 
 I don ' t think that ' s a good idea . I am just not good with approaching someone and starting up a conversation . 
 Pick-up lines don ' t work ! 
 What ? Come on ! That ’ s just lame ! No girl would fall for that ! 
 That ' s a good one ! I think that ' s pretty funny . 
 Ok , how does this sound , “ I was so enchanted by your beauty that I ran into that wall over there . So I am going to need your name and number for insurance purposes . ” 
 Are you ready to order now , sir ? 
 You have a choice of vegetables , green peas , lima beans or spinach . 
 Yes , sir . What would you want to drink , coffee , tea or milk ? 
 The cream and sugar are on the table , sir . 
 Would you like to order some dessert ? 
 Ice cream , fresh fruit or chocolate cake . 
 Yes , sir . 
 Here you are , sir . Pay the cashier at the door . 
 Seventy-six , I think . 
 nothing really . I think I've had a few too many coffees . 
 it's the only perk of this job ! How's your day going ? 
 why is that ? 
 your boss is a real salve-driver , isn't he ? 
 that's not just your boss . No one is allowed to send personal emails from the office . 
 maybe your boss isn't so horrible after all ! 
 try not to let it bother you too much . 
 ok , I'll see you in a bit . 
 What characteristics should an interpreter own ? 
 Why is that ? 
 These days my son has turned his computer into an electronic playground . He plays football , rides horses , drives racing cars , and does a whole bunch of other things on the computer . The funny thing about it is that , no matter what he plays , he always wins first place . I wonder if he'll be able to cope with a defeat in real life . 
 That's exactly like my wife . She spends at least two hours a day on the computers discussing things ranging from stock prices to soft-ware standards . 
 Aren ’ t you going to swim ? 
 You are not telling me that we drove 50 miles to come here for just sunbath , are you ? 
 What about your beautiful bathing suit ? We shopped all day . Don't you want to show it off ? 
 All right . Suit yourself . I am going swimming . 
 Yes ? 
 I've got a better idea . Why don ’ t we hire a boat and go for a ride ? What do you think ? 
 What should I do when I find a job ? 
 Does it make a difference ? 
 If I get work for a few weeks , will I be terminated from EDD ? 
 I don't know how John can put up with his son , who fools around without working . 
 If I were him , I would give him a good talking-to . I would insist on his stopping fooling around like that . 
 Hmm ... you look too dressed up . How about this purple top and these jeans ? 
 Be confident . Wear styles you ’ re going to be comfortable in . 
 You are late . The last piece has sold out . 
 There are several , take a piece . The crash appears in the headline . It is famous for offering catastrophe stories . 
 There are various magazines in the rack . 
 That's the top magazine in America and is popular with young people . OK . It is totally 30 dollars . 
 Have a nice trip . 
 Can I have a look at your handworks ? 
 You have quite a range , haven't you ? 
 They are all produced in China , aren't they ? 
 Could you please select me one ? 
 Oh , I like it very much . How much does it cost ? 
 OK . I'll take it . 
 Yeah , I'm worried . If it's like this tomorrow , our big outdoor party will have to be canceled . 
 I'd like to order breakfast , please . 
 Two muffins and a cup of coffee.Will it take long ? 
 How was your date recently ? 
 I guess so . Going to watch a movie and having dinner at a restaurant are usual . 
 Yes , now many girls want to be independent , so it is a little popular , especially among white collars . 
 Forget about it ! 
 It will be a long story . We have many differences , for example , she usually puts all her clothes into washing machine . That is the sort of thing I can not bear . 
 For what ? Are you taking up painting ? 
 Oh , good . How old is your niece ? 
 It's a wise thing to do . Art will do a child a world of good . 
 Yes . Fill it up , please . 
 I don't really know . I have just bought this new car . And it's the first time I've gotten gas for it . 
 Premium , please . Thanks . Please fill it up . 
 OK , thanks . 
 Good . How much does it come to ? 
 OK . Here you are . 
 Hello , I want to make a reservation for a Qingdao cruise . 
 Next week . 
 Good ! How much does the sea view stateroom cost for per person ? 
 I see . Does that include fees for shore excursions ? 
 Thanks a lot . Give me one ticket , please . 
 That sounds good but I don ’ t know what ’ s on . 
 Ok , that ’ s a good idea . Where shall we meet ? 
 That sounds good . I ’ ll call you once I arrive . 
 Hi . 
 OK . 
 It's huge ! 
 There must be about 50 computers in here . 
 Do I have to take gym ? 
 When were you born may I ask ? 
 Do you know what it was according to the lunar calendar ? 
 By the way , could you tell me when the film will begin ? 
 I am frigid I can't be there on time . 
 I don't want to miss it today . 
 See you . 
 It's all right . Kids are like that . 
 Don't worry . His teacher will tell him to be good . 
 Happy birthday , Alice , here is a little something for you . 
 I tried to ask the bank teller why it changed , but she didn't speak English well enough.So I decided to go to the magazine shop . The one around the corner.And I bought an American newspaper . 
 It seems that yesterday the Mexican government declared wouldn't pay back the loans it got from the World Bank.The government declared a default on the loans . 
 I know . The economy here is having serious problems.But because the government declared a default , the currency value went way down . 
 Yes , it's an amazing drop . 
 Yes , it's very good . We suddenly have twice as much money to spend here.Our hotel is now half as expensive as when we got here ! Isn't that strange ? 
 What ? 
 Why not ? We should do it . Because now we can afford it . 
 Good morning.Mr.Green.My name is Helen.What can I do for you ? 
 Yes.Are you interested in the job ? 
 Have you eve worked with tape recorders before ? 
 Good.There are many different kind of language labs , but ours is a small one.If you decide to take the job , I'll explain how to operate the system , Are you sure ? 
 Ten hours a week.From Monday to Friday , from 4 to 6 P . m . , and $ 150 a week . 
 Fine.Please fill out the application form . 
 Sorry to say it , but neither of those . I'm here to close our account with you . The market around here has been dropping for a while now , and it's just not sensible for us to stay . 
 I guess I should just withdraw everything . 
 Here you go . That's everything , then . Thanks very much for your service over the years . 
 Like who ? 
 I've got it under control . 
 What if you had three more top-notch programmers to help you ? 
 So , did I tell you about my New Year ’ s resolution ? I ’ Ve decided to go on a diet . 
 Exactly ! I ’ m going to cut out all that junk I eat . no more chips , no more soda , no more fried food . 
 But this time I ’ m going to stick to it . I really mean it ! Trust me , Carol , I ’ m going to be a new man in one year ’ s time ! 
 Thanks , honey , that was a great meal . I ’ m stuffed . Do we have any chips left ? 
 Yes , I'll be with you in a minute . Here's your bill , sir . It's 480 yuan altogether . 
 That's for the wine . 
 Would you like to put it on your hotel bill ? 
 Your name and room number , please ? 
 May I have a look at your room card , Mr . Black ? 
 Hi , I'm checking in . The last name is Rama . 
 Actually , no . It should be a suite . I had booked a non-smoking king . 
 That's okay . I'm here a little early . Is it possible to check in right now ? 
 Here it is . 
 Oh , just one . 
 No , I'm fine . Thanks . 
 Are you listening to me , Dan ? 
 What did I just say ? 
 Just what I thought ! 
 I like collecting stamps . 
 Yes , you're right . What do you like to do in your spare time ? 
 Do you play basketball well ? 
 Shall we have a game together some day ? 
 Bob ! Your eyes look bloodshot . Did you not sleep well ? 
 you have it right . Alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in China . Drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in Northern China . 
 you lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . This will endear you 
 then he must be opening his heart to the friends . In a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you . 
 Hi , Jane . How are you doing this morning ? 
 Late night ? 
 Are you there , Mary ? 
 How much is my stamp ? 
 Don't get ahead of yourself . Fat boy isn't yours yet . 
 Hi , darling ! I have a one-month vacation saved up . How about a trip to Europe ? 
 Oh , but I really need to leave this town for a change . Working day after day has worn me out . Do you have any other suggestions ? 
 Wonderful ! I think that's a great idea How soon until we can make this happen ? I can't wait ! 
 Perfect . I'II start preparing tomorrow . If we re going to drive , l'II need to fill up the tank . 
 We can take the train , that will be faster . I'II book the tickets tomorrow morning . 
 No problem . I'm really looking forward to the coming week . 
 Something's wrong with my computer . 
 All I get is a black screen . 
 I think I know , because this happened before . 
 My hard drive crashed . 
 It sure is , but I'm going to call HP first , just to make sure . 
 No , I always back up my files . 
 Okay Rebecca , well I think you ’ Ve given me a clear impression of your positive qualities , but let ’ s talk a little bit about your weaknesses . 
 Definitely , but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be ? 
 So would you say if things don ’ t go your way at work it could easily get you down ? 
 Well , you know journalism is a highly competitive world , so you do need to keep pushing yourself it ’ s true . Okay , well let ’ s move on to talk about the job position here , shall we ? 
 Hello , Could you please connect me to Mr . Cook's office ? It is on Line Three . 
 Oh . Then I don't know what his number is . Can you check it for me ? 
 OK . Thank you . 
 Thank you . You helped me a lot . 
 There are many art craft items in this shop . I suggest you take your time , and you might find something you like . 
 If you have any problem , please come to me . 
 You are an expert on it . That wood carving is very rare . But I'm so sorry . that is not for sell . 
 Do you have any special request ? 
 So that means you are shopping for presents ? 
 Actually , I think the paper-cuts is OK , because it is easy to carry and foreign friends are also interested in it . They think that is a miracle . 
 I have collected different kinds of paper-cuts all over the country , you can pick the one you like best . 
 As a matter of fact , I open the shop because I'm interested in the arts . I spent lots of time doing research on the folk art of our country . 
 Hello ! Let me introduce myself . My name is Nancy .

 No , I transferred here . 
 I transferred from PCC . 
 I wanted to attend this school originally , but my grades out of high school weren ’ t good enough . 
 PCC is great ! 
 Thank you very much . 
 There're many things I can do on weekends . 
 I'm keen on talking short trips to nearby scenic spots . More often than not , I go with some of my friends . By the way , what are your favorites ? 
 That's great ! I think they do you a lot of good . Where do you swim ? 
 I'm fond of dancing . 
 Did you order the cake ? 
 Get on the phone right now . It might not be too late . 
 Yeah . How about “ Happy Birthday Tony , from the gang . ” 
 Can your dog do any tricks ? 
 I wish I had a dog . My cat can't do any tricks . 
 So who takes care of him then ? 
 I can't do that with my cat . She hates water . 
 I often go to a place of leisure . 
 I very much like to go to a cafe and doze in the afternoon sunshine . 
 The coffee , books , music and sunshine are just beautiful there . 
 I may take you there some day . 
 Let's go to the animal shelter . 
 I want to get a puppy for my son . 
 I'll get him one of those little dogs . 
 And eat too much . 
 Oh , yes , I took him there yesterday . He showed me one that he really liked . 
 He wanted to take it home yesterday . 
 I was wondering if you could help me with something . 
 Actually , it ’ s a little bit silly . 
 What words do I need to know to buy a pair of shoes ? 
 Don ’ t worry about that . I can point it out in the store . 
 Let me write all that down . I ’ m going shopping this afternoon . 
 Thanks . 
 May I see your ticket please ? 
 Any form of picture I . D . will do . 
 That will do . What an interesting picture ! How old is it ? 
 Barely . Will you be checking any luggage today ? 
 Ok . Mr . Lee , you ’ re all set . Your flight leaves from gate 10 . Boarding begins at 10:30 
 It does seem like the perfect day ! I ’ m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! This looks like the perfect spot ! Ok kids , put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up ca 
 Ok kids , here ’ sa beach ball and a Frisbee , a pail and a shovel . I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave . Don ’ t stray too far . Wait ! Leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes 
 You ’ re back already ? The water was too cold , huh ? I ’ ll tell you a secret . Do you see that small pool of water over there ? It ’ ll be warmer in there . Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some 
 Ah ! Not on me ! Ow ! 
 Where are we going ? 
 Do you have a washer down there ? 
 That's so convenient . Where are the dirty clothes ? 
 But I didn't see you carry them down . 
 Would you like to go to the movies tonight ? 
 Well , we could see something different like a detective film . 
 How about a comedy ? 
 How about a love story then ? 
 What's you opinion ? 
 Really ? 
 No , but I can't imagine that a girl like you would wonder to see a war movie . 
 I need the police . 
 My neighbor hit my brother on the head . He ’ s bleeding . 
 176 Wooden Street East . 
 I will , but please hurry . 
 I ’ m going to the beauty parlor . Do you want to come too ? 
 I want to have a foot massage and a haircut . 
 Good idea . We should also get pedicures and manicures . 
 I think it ’ s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . Don ’ t you agree ? 
 Maybe we should try a thai massage too . 
 That ’ s when the masseuse walks on your back and massages you with her feet .

 We came back the day before yesterday . I enjoyed myself there very much . The beach is beautiful . You should go there some day . The sun was lovely , too . 
 I have a special party tonight , and I'd like to change my style . Actually , I ’ m thinking about a perm . My sister is getting married next month . I think that if I have a perm now , I'll look very natural by then . What do you say ? 
 No , I don't like short hair . I like this one . The wave looks beautiful , and it fits my age too . 
 No , you can take your time . Oh , I also want a manicure while I am having the perm . 
 Thank you . How much will this cost ?

 Just don't come looking to me for help . 
 I'm signing off . 
 Is there any cable for the Internet ? 
 How much do I need to pay for it ? 
 Is there a mailbox in the apartment ? 
 Are there any parking lots for the tenants ? 
 Is there an alarm system in the apartment ? 
 Who will take responsibility for the heating system if it has a problem ? 
 Are smoke detectors provided ? 
 Good morning , Madam . What can I do for you ? 
 Maybe sandalwood fan is good . 
 Of course . 
 The small ones are one hundred yuan for each . And the big ones are two hundred and thirty yuan . 
 What else are you interested in ? 
 OK . Here you are . 
 Good . Thanks for asking . 
 I need help with something . 
 I am looking for a newspaper article . 
 I didn ’ t even think about that . 
 That would be a lot of help . 
 Thank you so much . 
 Have fun . 
 Yes ! Yes ! And yes ! Jared , of course I ’ ll marry you ! 
 Oh , Jared ! I can ’ t wait for our wedding ! I hope you don ’ t mind , but I ’ Ve already chosen a date ! Six months from now in the summer ! Melissa saw you buying the ring last month so I ’ Ve had plenty of time to start planning ! 
 Oh don ’ t worry , sweetie , I didn ’ t know when you were going to propose . It was still a nice surprise ! As I was saying , I ’ Ve got it all planned out . There ’ s almost nothing left to do ! I wrote up our guest list and we will have roughly four hundred guests attending . 
 No need to sweat it . My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding , which is going to be low-budget anyway . So roughly four hundred people , which means that the hall at Northwoods Heights will be our reception venue . I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents ’ church and my uncle of course would be officiating . We ’ ll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling . The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer . My step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that . My cousin will be the official photographer . I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo . Did you know that she ’ s going to be a professional opera singer ? 
 And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we ’ ll get the Youth Group to serve us . I was thinking that your friend ’ s band could be our entertainment for the night . though they might have to tone it down a bit . Or we could hire a DJ . Your sister ’ s husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings . what ’ s their name again ? I was thinking that we could have an island paradise-themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine . And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we ’ ll make our toasts ! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors ? Who else am I missing ? Oh , your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake ! 
 See ? It ’ s going to be wonderful ! Oh this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of . 
 My goodness ! You ’ re kidding ! 
 That ’ s amazing ! You got a good pay here , didn ’ t you ? 
 Come on ! Don ’ t be silly ! 
 Well . How do you know ? 
 I've been away on a vacation . 
 Yeah , beautiful sunshine , pleasant scenery and many new friends 
 That's a cool jacket . Where did you get it ? 
 Whoa . Now I'm awake ! Zina has a secret admirer . 
 I know what you mean . I can't stand computer geeks . 
 Who do you think it is ? 
 We've heard about that festival before . It would be quite helpful if you could give us some highlights of the festival . 
 What do you think we can see during the festival ? 
 I'd like to take the one that goes to the Wild Animal Park . 
 Wow , must be interesting to watch dragon boats compete a-gainst one another on the city river . 
 It depends where you live , sir . 
 Yes , we deliver there . But it costs two pounds fifty . 
 Morning or afternoon ? 
 Where is our son , dear ? 
 What happened ? Have you talked with him ? 
 I'm glad we took the train . I don't like to ride in buses . 
 Even in Taiwan , I always liked to take the train . It is more comfortable . 
 Look at that village ! 
 Do you think I can take a picture through this window ? 
 I was just thinking to call you , then the phone rang and it was you calling me . 
 Hey , look at my new shirt . What do you think about it ? 
 I bought it on a street market . A real bargain ! 
 Well , it was nice talking to you . 
 We should really hang out again . 
 Where do you want to go ? 
 That sounds good . 
 I'll call you later . 
 See you later . 
 What's up , how are you ? 
 Could be better . 
 I got on about fifteen minutes ago . 
 I usually just drive . 
 Yes , I have my own car . 
 I'm waiting for our President to lower the gas prices . 
 Unfortunately , according to our regulations I have to confiscate these counterfeit notes . 
 I'm sorry but it is our regulation , so I must follow it . We will issue you with a receipt to show that the notes you presented us with are counterfeit and have been confiscated . Then , if you wish to pay in some more cash , you are free to do so . 
 Here's your Passbook back and the receipt to say we confiscated the 500 RIB worth of counterfeit notes . 
 Yes . Please fill in a new deposit slip and we can continue . 
 There ’ s a possibility . 
 I mean if you don ’ t sell your shares now , it ’ s quite likely that you ’ ll end up losing your shirt . 
 Absolutely . Take my word for it . 
 All right , Bill.Here ' s your daily exercise schedule . You are to jog before breakfast . 
 Then , you are to walk to work . 
 Thirty minutes in gym at lunch time . 
 Use the stairs , never the elevator . 
 And three times a week , you can either swim , play racketball , or hand ball . 
 OK , you can stop now.It ' s time for the dance class . 
 You will . 
 Come on , Let's go for lunch , Gregory . 
 Don't worry about it.It ' s on me . 
 I agreed , Hi , guess what ? I went bungee jumping last weekend . 
 Definitely . you know , I'm into serious sport in a big way . 
 come off it , It's not that serious . You should DIY ( do it yourself ) sometime . 
 No , really , I think you'd like it . I adapted to it right off the bat . 
 I can teach you how . 
 No , not really , but I think I have lost my wallet . Where can it be ? 
 Yes , May I help you ? 
 we are very sorry to cause you a lot of inconvenience . 
 We're rather busy right now . It will take another 15minutes 
 I'm afraid it will take 15 minutes at most . 
 Have you heard that we will have reorganization ? 
 Yes , flexible , aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department . 
 James is going to be packed off there . 
 Red restaurant . Do you want to make a reservation ? 
 At what time ? 
 No problem , sir . 
 Yes , I am looking for a suit . 
 Can I have a black one over there ? 
 Yes , I packed it myself . 
 It's my health-conscious lunch , good for my health and beauty . 
 Ok ... I ’ ll talk to you later . Bye 
 I just got off the phone with my boyfriend . He is always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing . It ’ s so hard to talk to him at times . 
 Yeah but , he is always in a really foul mood . I try to find out what ’ s bothering him or get him to talk about his day but , he always shuts down and brushes me off . 
 I guess you are right . What do you think I should do ? He wasn ’ t always this grouchy you know ... 
 You are something else you know that ? 
 Sure . But it's a very difficult one , you need to have a dictionary at your elbow . 
 How is Tom now ? 
 Let's congratulate him on Sunday . 
 Yes , I'm looking for a job as a clerk typist in English . 
 My name is B . How are you , Miss Kelly ? 
 Thank you , Miss Kelly . 
 I can type 120 words a minute and I take shorthand at 80 words a minute . 
 Yes , I would . 
 Yes , I'd like to give it a try . 
 The summers are so great here ! Not hot at all . I love the cooling breezes , the clear air , all the greenery . 
 Let's do both ! Are we in a rush or anything 
 Sounds fine to me . Whatever , let's enjoy this pond first . 
 I see them ! Wow ! How do you know they're wild ? 
 They're neat . Now Let's take that path into the woods and see what we can see ... 
 Yes , it's the correct thing to do . 
 Even so , we can't do business with him.he ' s not reliable . 
 Yes , surely . 
 No , you don't . It is free of charge . 
 Yes , certainly.Would you wait for a few minutes ? 
 Yes , what is it ? 
 Sure . I'll be back in a minute . 
 I agree , I think that that would be perfect ! 
 That might be a little too cold for some people . 
 What about April ? April has good weather that isn't too cold or too hot . 
 You know , maybe we could take a survey to see how that works for everyone . 
 Fine ! Well , I'll get right on it now ! 
 Fully agree . I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel . The latest office equipment is more type-functional . It combines fax machine , copy machine and printer in one . It saves a lot of place , one machine instead of three . 
 When will we get one of those ? 
 how do you usually spend your day , now that you ’ Ve retired ? 
 what do you have for breakfast ? 
 that sounds nice . How do you spend your mornings ? 
 how do you spend your afternoons ? 
 What sort of job would you like to take ? 
 We need an operator now . 
 It was good to see you here , John . 
 Pretty good.Thank you . 
 Yes , I am . I opened an account with you about a month ago , but today I'm here to see about a loan of some kind . 
 Yes , that's fine . My credit is good ; I banked at my former bank for many years . 
 Haha ! Actually , I felt that your array of services is much better than what my old bank had on offer . Plus , I've got plenty of friends who bank with you and they are extremely happy . 
 I have everything right here . I'll let you go through that and come back . I'd like to have a good read of your materials to make sure I make the right choice . 
 I think it's a great idea . Studying abroad will offer you plenty of new opportunities . Are you planning on going abroad ? 
 which country do you want to go to ? 
 have you applied to any schools there ? 
 congratulations ! That's excellent news ? What do you have to do to get an unconditional offer ? 
 if you study hard , I don't see why you wouldn't . Have you received any other offers ? 
 if you're worried about money , the cost of living is lowest in America . However , if you go to Oxford University , you'll probably be able to get any job you want in the future . 
 if I were you , I'd apply for some scholarships and grants before you decide . Whatever you do , I know you'll succeed . 
 I'd be glad to . What is it ? 
 Glad to meet you , Mrs.Tina . 
 That's what I understand . 
 Exactly my understanding . 
 Yes , I have . 
 Just one . I noticed an item about flex-time.Is that a possibility for me ? 
 That's acceptable . 
 Good morning . Can I help you ? 
 Sure we do . First-class or economy ? 
 Jack , I think it's best that I actively ask for the results of interview . 
 I think so , too . What do you think about that I write a letter of inquiry to the company ? 
 Good idea . It is convenient and fast . 
 Certainly . 
 I think that about one hundred words are enough . 
 OK , I know now . 
 Good evening . Is the kitchen open now ? 
 It ’ s ok , good night . 
 Jack , I hear you got promoted.Is that true ? 
 Oh , Jack , you deserve it.You ' Ve been working so hard . 
 Today people are hearing about information superhighways and the intermet . 
 Yes , I think so . My friend once used it mostly to play chess , but now he has learnt how to do other things on the Internet . 
 That's true . I can imagine companies sending advertisements directly to customers over the net . Customers , in turn , can examine and compare whatever goods they want to buy and tell their computers to find them at the best price offered . 
 Are you ready ? 
 Who can tell us something about the author's life ? Volunteer ? 
 Very good . Sit down , please . Susan , what's the general idea of the text ? 
 No , you can't . This is an English class , and you have to express yourself in English . 
 Excellent . Class is over . Let's have a break . 
 For me , the times of chatting online has gone . 
 I opened my blog today . In order to have more visitors , I have to land on others ' blogs and leave my messages for their blogs . 
 Do you still remember Justin ? 
 He seemed to be dumped by his girlfriend . I found his blogs were a little sad . 
 What ’ s the plot of your new movie ? 
 Did you enjoy making the movie ? We heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director . 
 Critics are not very happy with the movies that you ’ Ve made recently . Does that bother you ? 
 Did you do you own stunts in the movie ? 
 Thank you very much for doing this interview . 
 Yes . I have . I liked it very much . Like you , I was very impressed with Rachel ’ s performance in the movie . She ’ s going to be a star . 
 No , I'm just browsing . Thanks anyway . 
 Ben cancelled his trip . 
 Because General , his dog , got sick . 
 Excuse me . I have an appointment with Mr . Li at nine . May I come in ? 
 Yes , I am My Liu . Thanks . 
 According to your advertisement , you want an experienced software engineer . I think my background meets the requirement of this position . 
 My major was computer science when I was at college , and I am quite familiar with Visual C + + and Java language . 
 The developments in software are going ahead very quickly and more and more problems are resolved by software . In some regions , the hardware is completely replaced by software . So I think the software industry has a great future . 
 Yes , I have designed some programs for the network with Visual C + + and I have passed the test for programmers - MUSE . 
 Yes , can you tell me what's my responsibility in this position ? 
 I see . This is my advantage . 
 No . 
 Thank you , bye-bye . 
 Don ’ t be fool . I ’ ll always side with you . 
 the air quality in this city is horrendous ! The pollution levels were so high that we weren't supposed to go outside with a face mask again ! 
 on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city . 
 I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse 
 it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature . 
 they're related to one another , yes . 
 people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well . 
 I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place . 
 Yes , yes I did . Please come in ! I ’ m so glad you came ! This old house is falling apart ! Come on into the bathroom . See , here , there ’ s water leaking everywhere ! 
 Oh , that must be because of my four-year-old daughter . She is always flushing things down the toilet . You know how kids are . 
 That would be great ! Is it expensive ? 
 What did her boss say to you ? 
 Yeah . You look so unhappy recently . What ’ s the matter . 
 Darling , can't you stay for a few more days ? 
 I'm really going to miss you.Take care of yourself . 
 Hello . 
 Sure , just a minute.Mark , you're wanted on the phone . 
 Hi ! This is Jill.How come you didn't come in today ? 
 That's too bad.You ' ll have to be more careful nest time . 
 No , nothing special.Oh , yes , you know Bill , The guy with the moustache.His wife had a baby girl last night and he passed out cigars to everyone today , He said his wife and daughter are doing fine.The baby is their first child . 
 Yes , we have to.Do you think you can make it tomorrow ? 
 You're welcome.Bye . 
 16 hours . Beijing is 16 hours ahead . 
 We are gaining a day . 
 That's right . 
 I only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . I don ’ t think that tv is bad for kids . I think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes . 
 If you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch , remember to have something else for them to do . If you don ’ t , they ’ ll get bored and misbehave . 
 Sure . You could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time . 
 That ’ s a good idea . Remember that if the parents watch too much Tv , the kids will probably follow suit . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Don't tell me you actually believe all that ? Don't be so gullible , they are just urban legends . They are just stories people make up to scare you . 
 You really think an artist or song writer is going to go through the trouble of putting subliminal or satanic messages in a song ? Don't be so naive ! 
 Sounds a bit too far fetched to be true , don't you think ? 
 What do you need ? 
 Right now the cable isn't working . 
 The cable should be running again in a couple of days . 
 We'll just give you a credit for the inconvenience . 
 It'll be free until it comes back on . 
 Thank you for all your patience . 
 Just call her Lisa , Mary . She's cooking dinner . 
 Of course ! Make yourself at home . 
 Please , just call me Tom . 
 Where's Cindy ? 
 Can you tell her to come downstairs ? We're about to have dinner . 
 Do you have some new perfume ? 
 Well , I wanna buy some new perfume . 
 That's all right . 
 Can I open it ? 
 It smells sweet . 
 Really ? How much is it ? 
 Ok , I will take two bottles . 
 No , thanks . 
 Yes . What can I do for you ? 
 Oh , it ’ s right downstairs . I ’ m going there myself . Just follow me . 
 Don ’ t worry about it , I ’ ll call my friend and have him take care of it . I can ’ t believe he was stalking you all these years . What a nut job ! 
 Don ’ t apologize ! From the moment I met you , not a day has gone by when I haven ’ t thought of you.And now that I ’ m with you again , I ’ m ... I ’ m just scared , Veronica . The closer I get to you , the worse it gets . The thought of not being with you , I mean , I just can ’ t handle it ! We were made for each other , Veronica . You are my everything , my soul mate . What can I do ? 
 I ’ m so happy to hear that ! I knew we belong together . I love you so much . 
 Yeah ? Why ? Don ’ t you like living with me ? 
 Well , check the newspaper . 
 Yeah , prices have really gone up the past couple of years . 
 No , it ’ s pretty good . Why not give the landlord a call ? 
 Can you tell me the time ? 
 Is your watch right ? 
 Shall we discuss the packing ? You know , a well-designed package helps sell the goods , so the products must not only be superior in quality , but also attractive in appearance . I'd like to see the sample of packing . 
 Quite good . The beautiful design and bright color are just the European taste . How are you gonna pack these blouses ? 
 Wonderful . 
 Hi there Mr . Anderson ! How are you on this fine morning ? 
 It sure is cold this morning , isn ’ t it ? I barely even get out of bed ! 
 Did you catch the news this morning ? I heard that there was a fire on Byron Street . 
 Did you happen to watch the football game last night ? The Patriots scored in the last minute ! 
 Oh . . . By the way , I saw you with your daughter at the office Christmas party . She is really beautiful ! 
 Sir this is the 56th floor ! We are on the 70th ! 
 Where will you go in your vacation ? 
 You're so industrious . 
 Where are you going to buy one ? 
 You like my living room set , don't you ? 
 I found mine at IKEA . 
 Everything I got from IKEA cost me a couple thousand . 
 The furniture isn't built cheap . 
 You will feel comfortable paying the money . 
 Let's take the MET . lt's faster and cheap . 
 We should take the red line . Let's get the tickets at the automatic vending Machine . 
 5o dollars . Later you have to place your ticket near the sensor . 
 It's so crowded . All the seats are taken . Let's go there . There is a seat over there . 
 Yeah , you are right . Let's stand . It takes only about 20 minutes . 
 Anyway , we are arriving at Danshui soon . I can't wait to watch the beautiful sunset . 
 I don't think so . I'm just shaken up a little . 
 No , don't bother . I think I'm OK . 
 Yes , it's OK . 
 Are you serious ? Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! It disgusts me . 
 Well , to begin with , Gambling is addictive , ruins marriages , destroys families and bankrupts communities . Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . People have lost their houses , cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . Secondly , it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . Women gamble to escape , and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies . 
 You cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . Now excuse me , I have a protest rally to organize ! 
 Yeah . I have a fancy for some wine tonight . Can you recommend something for me ? 
 All right . What kind of red wine do you serve ? 
 The dry red wine looks quite good . I'd like to try this one . 
 Why ? Do I have to order that ? 
 That's really nice . I'd like this one . It looks very attractive . 
 Croissant for appetizer and two beef steaks for dinner . 
 Medium , please ? 
 Sure . We'd like to have Black Forest Cake for dessert . 
 Where do you have to go . 
 When do you have to be there . 
 How long do you have to be there ? 
 When will you be back ? 
 hello ! How are you . 
 what have you got ? A cough ? A cold ? 
 perhaps you ’ Ve been working too hard . You do have a high-pressure job . 
 well . I ’ m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . Dr . Jameson is very good . 
 OK . Hope you feel better soon . You should take it easy . I ’ m sure the doctor will prescribe rest , you know . 
 Oh no , I won't . But we will have an accident if you don't stop shouting . 
 Oh , shut up , will you ? It was all your fault.If you'd kept quite this would never have happened . 
 Room service , can I help you ? 
 What would you like to order ? 
 Okay . I ’ ll have them brought to your room right away . 
 Good morning . Is this where I can get a library card issued to me ? 
 I'm done . 
 Sure , here it is . 
 I am pretty sure how to use it , but can you remind me ? 
 I see . 
 Bob from accounting is on the line . Do you want to speak with him ? 
 I'll put the call through then . 
 hello ! How are you today ? 
 it ’ s not use worrying about it now . you ’ Ve done test and you can ’ t change any of your answers . 
 let ’ s go and get a coffee together . That will help you to wake up again ! 
 oh , you know me . I ’ m always happy ! If I think I ’ m getting into a bad mood , I call some friends and socialize or have a chat . 
 I hate spending too much time at home . I get bored of it really quickly . I ’ m always excited about going out to party or other social event and meeting people . 
 We can't wait any longer ... 
 You'll knock yourself out the way you've worked.Why don't you slow down ? 
 All right.Now that everybody's here . Shall we be getting started ? Miss Lin , are you ready ? 
 Excuse me , Miss Lin.Would you mind speaking up , please ? I can't hear you very well . 
 I have some good news for you . We've decided we'd like to send you to Shanghai on a business trip this weekend . 
 Don't you think that it'd be a good thing for you to get out of the office foe a couple of days ? 
 I thought you'd be a bit more excited about this . Everything will be paid for and I'll send my assistant with you to take care of everything for you . All you have to do is to get on the train tonight at 7 pm . 
 Oh , no . We've bought your return ticket for you . I think you'll find it comfortable . 
 Oh no . the train hasn't been crowded at all recently . Besides , you're in first-class , so you'll be fine . 
 They've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9 
 We've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings , so you won't need to deal much with the transportation system . 
 That's not a problem . Have a nap if you can . You don't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip . 
 Of course . How can I help you ? 
 What size do you wear ? 
 Here . How do you like this one ? 
 You can try it on in the fitting room over there . 
 We offer a reduction of 50 % and comes to $ 10 . 
 Well , here you are . 
 Of course . 
 Merry Christmas . Steven ! 
 I'll have supper with my girlfriend and go shopping . What about you ? 
 I'd love to . But I am going to meet my girlfriend right now . See you later . 
 How about having a cup of tea with us ? 
 Would you like to go to the cinema with me ? 
 Can ’ t you come in and have tea now , Peter ? 
 Do you have to water it now ? 
 What a nuisance ! 
 Well , I ’ ll have tea by myself . That was quick ! Have you finished already ? 
 It ’ s raining . That means you needn ’ t water the garden . 
 Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ? 
 I suppose she's right.Does she speak English very slowly ? 
 It must be interesting to study English . 
 Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ? 
 How are your stocks doing , Jim ? 
 Yeah . I lost money investing in the Internet , too . 
 I changed my strategy around too . I invest in good companies now . 
 No , what happened ? 
 Oh , boy . His wife can ’ t be happy about that . 
 Yes . I have a spare room . 
 10.00 dollars a night . 
 Sure.Come on in . 
 Ms . Lee , could you tell me what number 7 is again ? I didn't catch you . 
 No , thank you . 
 Yes , I'd like to try the blueberry pie . 
 No , I'm stuffed . I'm ready for the check . 
 Thank you . 
 Come in please . 
 Sure.How much is it ? 
 Well , here is the money . 
 Fine . 
 Perhaps they should give it a second thought . The residents are getting up in arms about it . 
 How's your time spent in the United States ? 
 I'm glad to hear that . What impressed you most ? 
 You mean we Chinese think differently from the Americans ? 
 That's weird . 
 You really cared about your friend . 
 I'm confused . Why did he say that ? 
 Absolutely . Now I understand why he responded that way . 
 Do you think it fits me ? 
 I bought it at half price . 
 Traxi.taxi . 
 Could you please help me put my bags in the truck ? 
 Take me to Hilton Hotel . 
 Do you do morning exercises ? 
 Shadow-boxing ? How interesting ! Do you think it really helpful for your health ? 
 I think I'm going to China this vacation.How about you ? 
 I went to France last summer . 
 Hello . This is the Stewart Resident . 
 This is Mr . Stewart . Who ’ s this ? 
 I ’ m sorry . I ’ m not interested in it . 
 Happy Anniversary , honey . 
 After the trouble I got into last year , no way . 
 You can take this car into consideration . It works well and its price is reasonable . 
 Professor , I am going to need to leave class early today . 
 I need to go to the airport to pick up a relative . 
 Yes , I've got that part covered . 
 I don't need to leave until the very end of class . 
 Thanks , Professor . See you later ! 
 Can I help you ? 
 Sure . Please come this way . 
 Of course . Here is the fitting room . 
 Yes , here it is . 
 You look really beautiful in it . 
 I would like to order cable . 
 What kinds of packages do you offer ? 
 What else do you have ? 
 Do you have a package that includes all the movie channels with the basic channels also ? 
 I want that . 
 No , but is it possible for me to add channels later ? 
 Good idea ! I've heard that the Expo is doing pretty well now , and ads are seen everywhere in the country on all means of media , newspapers , TV , street signs , etc . 
 what's interesting to see there ? 
 I visited the First International Flower Festival in the city last year , and was impressed with so many beautiful flowers ! 
 It would be a rare occasion to be able to appreciate so many fine species of Chinese and foreign flowers fully blooming in one park ! 
 Excuse me , please show me that business suit , the dark one . 
 May I try it on ? 
 Hi there , I want to reserve a hotel room . 
 Sure , John Sandals . 
 My plans are to be there April 14th to the 17th . 
 Well , it depends on the price , of course . What is it ? 
 I have no problem with that . 
 Definitely nonsmoking . I can't handle that smell . 
 No problem . 
 Of course ! It's area code 626-555-1739 . 
 Hello . I'm answering the ad in the paper about your car.And I wonder if it is still available ? 
 Good.Can you give me some information about it ... uh .. mileage and the tires and things like that ? 
 Good morning , Madam ! Can I help you ? 
 Oh , look at these two watches , aren't they lovely ? 
 How about this one ? It's graceful in style . 
 Sure . 
 500 dollars , Madam . 
 Surely . As this is the latest model , and you can also set the alarm . 
 Just do like this.Very simple . 
 Front desk , can I help you ? 
 Sure . Your room number , PLS ? 
 Room 1019 , tomorrow at seven thirty . Ok , we will give you a call in the morning . 
 I was looking for a book , but I couldn ’ t find it . 
 I already did . 
 I didn ’ t see it . 
 Will you ever get another copy ? 
 Could you please reserve it for me ? 
 Thanks . I really appreciate that . 
 I'm afraid this seat is taken . 
 You're welcome . If you ask the conductor when he comes by , he should help you find one . 
 I'm here to sign the agreement . 
 Can you speed it up and let us have it today ? 
 Let me have a look.Well , it contains basically all we have agreed upon . 
 I don't think so . 
 That's fine . 
 Do you really believe in that ? If they are going to focus on something , they should do it on civil rights . 
 I understand your point , but we continue to have transgressions against human rights . If so much attention weren ’ t devoted to the topic of animals , we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala . 
 Well , you are right on that point . This is the reason that I don ’ t buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products . 
 Wow ! So many students crowded in . More than I excepted , we are lucky to arrive in hour earlier . Or else we definedly have problems to getting good seats . 
 Yeah , I hate sitting in the front row . 
 That would be great . 
 Ok . 
 Oh , yes . It's a great party . There are some people I don't know , though . 
 That would be great . 
 I like feature films best . How about you ? 
 I always like to see the oldies , like The Sound of Music , Gone with the Wind . They are realty the best - in the acting , the scene and the plot . 
 Can you give me a hand with some things in the kitchen ? I don ’ t think I can finish everything in time . 
 First of all , I need you to do the drying up . I ’ m almost finished the washing up . I ’ m going to clean the cooker when I finish . 
 We ’ ll have this finished in no time with two if us working on it . 
 Actually , it was just some leftovers from yesterday . I made far too much food to eat alone . I am glad you could come over to help me finish it . 
 Yes . Look in that drawer . I should throw the old one out . 
 When you smell them , they affect your nervous system . 
 You can do that , too . Both methods have a healing effect . 
 Ha-ha ... I'm just fatigued . And tomorrow is a big day . 
 More sales ! 
 Many of our business friends in England , France , Switzerland , Italy and Germany are paying for our exports in Japan currency . It is quite easy to do so . 
 Many banks in Europe now carry accounts in yen . They are in a position to open letters of credit and effect payment in yen . Consult your banks and you'll see that they are ready to offer you this service . 
 Sure you can . Several of the banks in London , such as the National Westminster Bank and Barclays Bank are in a position to open letters of credit in yen . They'll do so against our sales confirmation or contract . 
 I can't even imagine you snorkeling ! 
 OK , Bond . 
 So you can always keep two times at once ? 
 The only two times you need are I'm late and I'm really late . 
 Nothing special . 
 Oh , I'd rather not . 
 You know , I am poor at English , especially spoken English . 
 A :: You must be Wily . It's nice to meet you . 
 A :: Tim , please . Please be seated . 
 A :: So , Wily , you have been with IBM for two years , ready for change ? 
 Which is more interesting to you , flying kites or going roller-skating ? 
 I've got no kite . Do you have one ? 
 Henry , don ’ t get out of doing housework . 
 You mean that is my business . 
 I ’ m your wife , not a housewife . I have my own work . 
 Please take a seat . 
 Now what can I do for you ? 
 Fine , but first I need some information about you . 
 Well , first of all , your name.What ' s your surname ? 
 And your other names ? 
 Have you got your e-mail address ? 
 How old are you ? 
 Where were you Bron ? 
 Too bad you missed Jane's performance . 
 It was so perfect that it won a unanimous 10 . 
 Boy , you are lost . It's across town . 
 You can take a No . 12 bus here and then transfer to a No . 23 bus to get there . 
 I think we have a little ways to go . 
 I know . 
 I'm not sure . 
 I don't know . We may have missed our stop . 
 Yeah , we did miss it . 
 Sorry . 
 There are hundreds and hundreds.English is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions . 
 I'll look up the rate.To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof.It means to search for and find some information . 
 That is just a natural , grammatical English expression.It has a direct translation in other languages . 
 Why are you so quiet ? 
 You must feel terrible now . 
 I remember my first break up . It was the worst feeling in the world . I was crying everyday for three months . And slowly , it got better . I know you'll feel better too . 
 Yeah . I remember it very clearly . The pain makes it easy to remember . I know you're really hurting right now , but you know many people experience break ups . 
 I know it's painful , but it's only temporary . After the pain goes away , you'll find other girls . 
 You'll change your mind . Look at everyone in the world . They all break up and move on . The faster you understand this , the quicker you will recover . 
 I also know you must still have strong feelings for her , but try to think of all the bad things . You know she didn't treat you that well . Is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ? 
 I'll give you a call later . We should hang out . It's good to be around people . 
 wow ! You're going to Tibet ? 
 that's really cool ! I've always dreamed of going somewhere like Tibet , seeing something unique . 
 nothing particular . 
 oh , Tibet sounds great , but I'm afraid it'll cost too much . Last time I traveled to India , and it cost me a fortune . 
 ok , then count me in . where will we stay ? 
 then make sure that you book me a room , too . 
 and check whether they accept credit cards . 
 May I come in ? 
 How are you doing , sir ? 
 Please allow me to introduce myself . My name is Li Hua . Nice to meet you . 
 This is the Bell Captain's Desk . May I help you ? 
 I'm very sorry to hear that . May I have your name and room number , please ? 
 And how many pieces did you have ? 
 Is there a name tag attached to them ? 
 We're very sorry for the delay . I'll check immediately and call you back . 
 Yes , I'm going to Europe on business and I need to purchase some Traveller's Cheques . 
 I think Euros will be the best , as I'll only be in Mainland Europe . 
 5,000 Euros will be sufficient , thanks . 
 That would be perfect , thank you . 
 Very good . I feel quite refreshed now ! You should come with me sometime - exercise is good for you ! 
 I just ran alongside the main road . 
 Oh ok , I ’ ll try that tomorrow . It ’ ll probably be better than fighting with the traffic ! Go on , why don ’ t you come along ? 
 That's really convenient . We were wondering if you could take a little off the rent , though . 
 That's great . Every little bit counts . And we don't need the parking space . I guess we could rent it out . 
 That'll bring the price down to twenty-five . That's the price we were shooting for . 
 Good afternoon , welcome to IBA . How can I be of service ? 
 This refers to the deposit business offered to the level 1 account of group companies . 
 Group companies can use this to make their arrangement of funds flexible , when dealing with their subsidiaries . 
 Can you help me find a nice gift for my young niece ? 
 You're right . Girls love Barbie . Show me a Barbie doll . 
 She's beautiful . What's the price for Digital Barbie ? 
 Only $ 29.95 ? I'll buy it , of course . 
 Thank you , but no . This will do it for now . 
 Cash , please . 
 I have read your notice on the wall so I come to see if there is anything I need . 
 How much is the desk ? 
 The goods in the yard sale are really cheap . I will take it . 
 Chill ! I'm just curling my eyelashes . 
 You're such a wimp ! You're afraid of an eyelash curler . 
 It just makes my eyelashes curl upwards . 
 Honey , don't tell me that you forgot our anniversary , did you ? 
 What's in it ? 
 A necklace ? 
 I have no idea . 
 Oh , my god . A diamond brooch . It's so beautiful . You're so kind to me , A . Thank you ! 
 Hi , Daniel , how are you holding up ? I am greatly sorry for your loss . 
 How ’ s that going ? 
 Have you bought a burial plot and a casket ? 
 I see , that sounds like something she would have really liked . I am sure the memorial service will be tasteful . You are doing a great job . 
 morning . Rent-A-Car Agency . May I help you ? 
 Certainly , Mr . Alexander . When would Mr . Phillips like to leave ? 
 Excuse me . Is there any body here ? 
 I've finished up all my water . I would kill for a sip of water . 
 Thank you very much . Are you here alone ? 
 I'm a back-packer from America . 
 It means a hiker who loves traveling around the world . 
 Yes , actually almost half of all the countries over the world . I love traveling places . 
 You can do it . But do work hard on your English to make it easier . 
 Did you take my money from the table ? 
 Is that room service ? 
 The maid has just delivered some laundry to my room.But it's not mine at all . 
 Tell me about yourself . 
 What type of position are you looking for ? 
 Are you interested in a full-time or part-time position ? 
 Can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job ? 
 What is your greatest strength ? 
 What is your greatest weakness ? 
 Why do you want to work for our company ? 
 When can you begin ? 
 But you should be considerate to the kids , it ’ s their nature to play . 
 Of course , it ’ s not polite of them , but sometimes you should put things the other way round and try to understand them . 
 They were not too bad . I really liked my poli-sci class . 
 I don't know if I would call it my favorite , but it ranks up there . 
 I took a business communication class last year and it was terrific . 
 Would you please tell me something about the agriculture and industry of New Zealand ? 
 I see . 
 OK , I will . 
 70 hours ? I would be dead if I worked hard like that . 
 I haven ’ t played softball since I was in high school ! 
 Okay . I guess I could give it a try . 
 It sure is.The Grand Canyon is truly masterpiece . No man could ever make anything like this . 
 It is the Colorado River . You will go down the river in a boat if you wish . 
 There is a beautiful state park here . I can see why so many people come out here to camp . 
 It definitely is a nice change from the polluted and crowded city . 
 Well , I ’ d better get back to work . I ’ Ve got a ton of stuff on my desk ! 
 Yeah , definitely . I was hoping to catch a ride with you . 
 I'm terrible sorry . I seem to have mislaid your MP4 . 
 Very sorry that I have caused you so much trouble . 
 Won't you let me buy a new one tomorrow ? 
 Please accept my deep apology . 
 Maybe we'd better go now . 
 Gosh , it's already 10.Stay here if you like . 
 OK.Hurry up . 
 Hi Tom ! I'm fine , and you ? 
 Good . See you ! 
 Excuse me , do you speak English ? 
 Actually , yes . Could you show me how to use my key card ? 
 Ok , like this ? 
 Oh , it ’ s open . Thank you very much . 
 Yes , I'd like a hamburger , please . 
 No . Don't put mustard in it . 
 Sprite with ice , please . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes . I'm interested in your package tour to Paris . Could you tell me more about it ? 
 How long is the tour ? 
 Mr . Smith just called me back . 
 We got the contract ! 
 I was wondering whether you could ship the tennis racket overseas to Taiwan . 
 I understand you don't have a history of shipping overseas , but I am willing to pay extra for shipping . 
 Thanks so much ! By the way , is the racket really Serena Williams ’ ? 
 I found a new job after all , and I like this one even better than the last . 
 Good afternoon , Sir . You're here to see about a Temporary Loan , right ? The loans we offer are for purchasing income-generating assets . Is that what you require ? 
 Well , we offer 60 - day or 90 - day loans . The balance of the loan is to be repaid in full by the end of the specified period . 
 Unfortunately , not . 
 Not a problem , Sir . If you'd just fill out these forms , and of course with necessary clearance , we can get you the money right away . 
 How long have you been like this ? 
 I think you've got the flu . There's a lot of it going around . 
 Get this prescription filled and go straight to bed . 
 Where did he go ? 
 Like me ? But you see I am so successful now . And if he is really like me , he will be more successful than me in the future . 
 Pay him ? But he studies for himself , not for you or for me or for anybody else . I got an idea . You should send him to class every morning and after the class begins , you can go to work . 
 That's a good idea . Why have I never thought of that ? 
 Hello , is John in ? 
 No , I'll call back later . 
 Who did the stupid thing ? 
 No , I don't think you're right.Kate never does things like that.It must be a naughty boy who did it . 
 Me too . I'll talk to you later . 
 The time has come to say goodbye . 
 I feel that way , too . But all good things must come to an end , as they say . 
 I've had a delightful time and I really appreciate your spending so much time showing me the sights . 
 You'll be out to see me next year , as you promised ? 
 I'll be expecting you then . 
 I agree . We need to recycle our trash and use public transportation more often . 
 Sandy , I think we made a mistake ... 
 It's a cute little teddy bear ! 
 And look what we did to him ! Hey ... he left me his business card . 
 Excuse me . Is flight KL638 late ? 
 Oh , my god . If this flight is late . I will for Sydney.What can I do now ? 
 OK.thank you . 
 Yeah , this is my first visit here . 
 Thanks , but I speak English with a strong German accent . 
 On and off , for quite a few years . 
 Hello . I'd like to have my nails manicured . 
 I don't need the full service . 
 No , thanks . All I need is painting and polishing . 
 Thanks very much . 
 Sure , here you are . 
 Yeah , I think the food is alright , it's not too spicy though it's a little salty for me . But you are Chinese , you should have known better . 
 Oh , I see how this food can be really hard for you . I can sympathize with that . I stayed in Sichuan for a year . The food was difficult at the beginning . Every dish was so spicy . After a while though , I got used to the taste , and now I won't consider anything a real dish if it isn't spicy . 
 I completely understand . I didn't intend on liking spicy food at first either , but when you have no other choices , you've got to adapt . 
 Exactly . 
 I got a great look at him . 
 I can do that . 
 All right . 
 He's there . 
 He's number four . 
 I'm glad to help . 
 No , not yet . I'm really worried . 
 Maybe you're right . But I'm still worried . 
 Yes , Mum . 
 But it's Sunday , isn't it ? 
 Are you nuts ? It's the President of the United States in lingerie ! 
 What's next ? Tony Blair in high heels ? 
 Inspiration can come in the strangest ways ... 
 I ’ m fine . Thank you . 
 I need you to help me . 
 I am looking for an article in a newspaper . 
 I didn ’ t even bother to think of that . 
 I get lost in this library . 
 Thanks a lot for your help . 
 Certainly I do . 
 I'd be happy to do something new . 
 Well , What seems to be the trouble , Mr . Williams ? 
 How long has this been going on ? 
 How was your appetite ? 
 You haven't lost any weight , have you ? 
 Unbutton your shirt , please . 
 You'll have to have some laboratory examinations to know for sure . 
 A blood test and during test . You can come back next week , say 4 pm to see the results . 
 Yes , I also felt that . I'm always busy , and have no time for rest . I don ’ t know how to make use of time . 
 That's a good idea . And in this way we will know how we spend our time and spare a lot of time to do other things . 
 Yeah , time is money . We really need to make good use of it . 
 No . I am Canadian . Are you Chinese ? 
 Nice to meet you , too . Let me show you around . 
 About two years , but it seems as if I got here yesterday . 
 Why , thank you . I wasn't sure if it looked okay or not . I can't believe all the words the salesgirl said . 
 I'm glad that you think so . I thought it might be a bit too revealing . 
 I got it on sale down at the department store . 
 I was just there a couple of days ago . You know , you should go down there too . They have a lot of stylish clothes on sale . 
 Anything you want . They have both casual and formal styles . 
 That's a good idea . Some of your ties are pretty outdated . 
 Anyways , are you going to the party tonight ? 
 I don't think so . It is a little too formal . I'm probably going to wear something more laid back . 
 I guess that you will really be dressing down . 
 Good point . I suppose that we all have our own individual styles . 
 The reason for my application for this position is simple . My educational background and professional experience make me qualified for the job . 
 Oh , just one thing , could you give me some ideas of the pay ? 
 2,000 RIB per month . 
 3,000 RIB per month . 
 No , that's all . 
 We serve excellent Chinese food . Which style do you prefer ? 
 It's divided into 8 big cuisines such as Cantonese food , Shandong food , Sichuan food etc . 
 Yes , Cantonese food is lighter while Shandong food is heavier and spicy . 
 Most Sichuan dishes are spicy and hot . They taste differently . 
 I think Mapo bean curd and shredded meat in chili sauce are quite special and delicious . We have a Sichuan food dining room . May I suggest you to go there ? It's on the third floor . 
 It's my pleasure . 
 I couldn't agree more ! 
 Oh , yeah , two beers . 
 I am a little bit shy and I blush every time I speak in public . I think I should open myself more and be more outward with people . 
 I am self-indulgent sometimes . 
 I'm sorry that I'm late . I couldn't find the room . 
 What are we doing ? 
 May I have a book ? 
 Hello . Is Becky there , please ? 
 Thanks . 
 That ’ s okay . I ’ ll call back later . 
 Yes . Swimming is one of my most favorite sports , indoors or out-doors . 
 I have never thought that swimming can bring us so many benefits . I only know that swimming in great waves and deep running water can train people's spirits , and enable people to be fearless of the hardships , dangers and difficulties and become brave and staunch . 
 Yes , but not always . However , I won't let it go if I have a chance . 
 I listen to a lot of hip hop . What about you ? 
 Yes , me too . I mostly listen to hip hop , but there are many genres of music I like . 
 We are leaving on our science field trip at 8 a . m . next Monday . Do you have something to write that down on ? 
 That will be on the second of December . Be there half an hour early to get your bags on the bus . Do you understand ? 
 The bus will bring you back 6 days later on December 8th . Is someone coming to get you ? 
 We will be leaving the campground at 5 in the evening and arrive at our campus at 8 p.m.Any more questions . 
 I put all of that information in the packet . I'll give you another copy if you need one . See you on Monday ! 
 Yes , you can find it at the entrance . 
 Ok , I'll get one for you . 
 Here it is . It ’ s really hard to find a shopping cart at this moment . 
 We make deliveries only for bulk buying . 
 No , but the charge is rather low . 
 Thanks for the pizza . It was delicious . 
 Next time , it's on me . 
 I'm serious . 
 Certainly . The vegetarian pizza looks pretty good . It must be very delicious . 
 What'll it be today , sir ? 
 Shall we check your oil and tires ? 
 ( The attendants fill the tank , clean the windscreen , and add some air to the tires . ) All right , sir , that'll be $ 26.50 . 
 What sort of shift-system do you operate ? 
 Do you ever have to do the night shift ? 
 Please lend me some money . 
 Yeah , I really want it . I am on my uppers . 
 Thanks . 
 Hello . I'd like to send 600 RIB in cash to my daughter . How long will it take for her to receive the money ? 
 Are there any extra charges , like commission ? 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Did you have anything particular in mind ? 
 Well , we have some handmade products . Let me show you some . 
 About how much were you planning to spend ? 
 Oh , in that case . This one is OK . 
 OK . Wait for a moment , please . 
 more or less . There's just one thing bothering me . 
 well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree . One of them tried to give me a gift that kind made me uneasy . 
 it's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift 
 I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way . 
 that's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . 
 Because I ’ m not in the mood , that ’ s why . 
 Help you in the kitchen , I don ’ t feel like it . 
 Really ? Do I have to do it ? 
 Well , isn ’ t there anything you want ? 
 No , why should I ? I don ’ t feel like it . Besides , I ’ m in such a bad mood . 
 How beautiful the detached house is ! 
 It's marvelous ! The lawn looks like a green carpet , and the garden with so many lovely flowers . 
 No wonder it smells fragrant . 
 It's fantastic ! 
 I am looking for cologne , small bottle . Can I see that one in the glass shelf ? 
 It's too expensive . 
 What's the difference between the two ? 
 Let me see . 
 Let's see . It says that you were charged Monday at 9:00 p . m . for the movie ' Titanic . ' 
 Okay , let me see what I can do for you . 
 I can take the $ 10 off your bill , but I need to charge you $ 2 for the service . 
 Unfortunately , sir , it's how the computer is programmed . 
 I'm sorry , sir . Perhaps you'd like to write a letter to headquarters . 
 I ’ m having a problem . 
 I apparently owe some fees , but I never got the bank statement . 
 My fees went up , but I didn ’ t even know I had fees to pay . 
 What are you going to do about it ? 
 I don ’ t have to pay any fees ? 
 That ’ s fine . I appreciate your help . 
 OK , Mum , when will you be back ? 
 It has a receiver , a CD player , a double cassette deck , and a turntable . 
 The CD player is a three-disk player . Here , we'll put a disk in so you can check out the sound . ( He puts a CD into the CD player . ) 
 You can also play Ccds on it if you hook it up to your TV . 
 No problem . Hope to see you again soon . 
 Cookies ? You just ate an hour ago . 
 Well , why don't you have some fruit instead ? 
 I don't think much of the film . 
 Really ? Do you like the story ? It's sheer nonsense ! 
 Hello , this is my claim tag . Can I get my baggage ? 
 Thank you . And where can I get a pushcart ? 
 Nice day today , isn't it ? 
 We can't complain about the weather recently . 
 I wonder how long this weather can last . 
 Have you heard about Michael's new home ? It's in one of the poshest areas in this area . 
 No , he's living in an old house in Warton . 
 That's the one . 
 He didn't buy it . His grandfather died recently and left him loads of money . 
 No one in the family expected to get a dime from him . It was quite a surprise . 
 He still has a complaint though . 
 He wanted to live right on a bus line , but he doesn't . so , if he wants to take a bus anywhere , he has to walk 1/4 mile to get to a bus stop . 
 You can say that again . 
 No , I think I didn't like your method . 
 Hi , Jack , how have you been ? 
 Why ? Looks like you're feeling very down ! What happened ? 
 Come on . For a man who's feeling so , down , there're usually two reasons . Either his career is going downhill , or he has a broken heart . Since you're so successful , it must be the latter . 
 Oh , I'm sorry . I thought you two were made for each ocher . 
 Well , she is not to blame . It's always difficult to choose between career and family . 
 Jack , I don't know what to say to comfort you , but cheer up ! There are plenty of fish in the sea and you'll find your soul mate , your perfect match ! 
 May I help you ? 
 Alright . Do you have your receipt ? 
 And why are you returning them ? 
 I see . Oh , wait . Ma'am , I'm sorry . These slacks were on sale . 
 I'm sorry , but we don't allow returns on sale items . 
 I'm sorry , but we usually don't do it . It is our policy . 
 Well . Let me talk to the manager for a moment.Ma ' am , the manager says I can do it this time . 
 Please show me your receipt again . 
 I will have to give you store credit , Ma'am . If you find something else you like in the store , you can use the credit . 
 We appreciate your business , Ma'am . 
 Maybe you can pick Mary ’ s brains now . She knows a lot about stocks . 
 Do you have shoes here ? 
 I want to buy a pair of shoes for an interview . 
 My feet is size 37 . 
 I need to file a complaint . 
 I got robbed . 
 It happened this morning . 
 My wallet and cell phone . 
 I sure did . 
 That shouldn't be a problem . 
 I'm just comparing prices . 
 But they don't let you have goods on approval . 
 Yes , he married my sister ten years ago . 
 Yes , my sister loves his personality . 
 Me too . 
 I meet too many jerks . 
 This city is full of jerks . 
 But what can you do ? 
 And they will yell back at you . 
 No . The best thing to do is just stay home . 
 Hi . Last month , our company , Turner Interiors of Beijing , ordered some documents under our new L / C . What I want to do is check and see if the documents have arrived yet . 
 Oh , dear . When do you think they will arrive ? 
 Good morning , sir . Can I help you ? 
 Yes , sir . Can you show you identity ? 
 Don't you have any other identification ? 
 Ok . Would you please sign your name on the back of the check ? 
 How do you want your money ? 
 All right . Please wait for a moment . 
 Does it work ? 
 Don ’ t count on it . I think the best way to prevent AIDS is to keep yourself clean by having clean sex and keeping a regular sex partner . 
 This is our rock-bottom price , Mr . Lee . 
 What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great . 
 What's your proposal ? 
 Do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible ! 
 The best we can do is another 30 dollars off . That's definitely the lowest we can go . 
 OK . We can meet halfway again . 
 OK . See you . 
 For example ? 
 Oh , that's interesting ! 
 Hi , Susan . How are you feeling today ? 
 Glad to hear it . 
 Hi , Robert . This is Janet Reese calling from American Advertising . We placed an order with you about a week ago . 
 Well , it still hasn ’ t gotten here , and my boss is pretty angry about it . 
 Yes . May I help you ? 
 I'd be very glad to show you around , but I'm very busy right now.Could you come back about 3,30 ? 
 Good . See you later . 
 How did you choose courses when you were abroad ? 
 Wait a minute . There are some new terms for me . I can hardly follow you . 
 Everything is so new to me . I think I'll have to experience a very difficult period when I get there . 
 I am very grateful for your advice . 
 Long Distance . May I help you ? 
 No , sir . I'm afraid not . 
 The charges vary according to the types of call you make . The cheapest is a station-to-stcrtion call , then a person-to-person call . The mini charge will apply for the first three minutes , then each additional minute will be charged . 
 Certainly . Who are you calling ? 
 And what's the number you are calling ? 
 And your name and number ? 
 Hang up and I'll call you back in a few minutes . 
 I want to buy some cleansing milk . What would you recommend ? 
 Anything that can keep my skin clean will do . 
 Hm ... the smell is too strong , I can't stand it . I'm very sensitive to fragrance . 
 I'll try that . Do you have facial cream to go with that ? 
 I'll buy the moisturizing lotion and cleansing gel first . If they suit me , I'll come back for the others later . 
 The police need our help finding a robber . 
 The TV news is reporting a bank robbery . 
 Yes , he's 6 feet tall , 200 pounds , black hair , and about 30 years old . 
 They didn't say . 
 Of course not . That would be racist . 
 Don't ask me . 
 Hello , I've got to get up early tomorrow , so please give me a wake-up call . 
 Actually , I need two calls , one at 7 and the other at 7 fifteen . 
 Wait a minute ! I don't like 7 fifteen , now that I think about it . Change it to 7 thirty . 
 Nothing that I can think of right now . If something comes up , though , I'll call you . 
 Have you ever run into a person who tries bleed you white ? 
 I hear that some guys splash all their money about on them . 
 I have an appointment for half past one . 
 Well , I have a problem with my class schedule . 
 It seems that I've been given two classes scheduled at the same time . 
 Is there any way that you can fix my schedule ? 
 Yes , I do . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Hi Martha . Everything is perfect . 
 It couldn't be better . My husband is so supportive with my work and he helps around the house so much . 
 I'm so happy . Even though we are both working , we get to spend a lot of time with each other in the evening and on the weekends . 
 In the evening , we just sit and talk over dinner . But on the weekend , we try to go out to the beach or hit a nice restaurant , or go to a nice cafe . 
 What are you hiding in your coat pocket ? 
 You want to take pictures of the inside of your pocket ? 
 What's that supposed to mean ? 
 May I invite you for a dance ? 
 You dance well . Do you breakdance ? 
 There's a story about breakdancing in the paper . 
 According to the story , it's some sort of modern dance style . 
 Well , breakdancing is more a physical exercise than a dance . 
 Right , a disco is a place where people dance according to nonstop recorded music ... 
 You are witty . 
 Yes , Miss Parks ? How may I help you ? 
 I ’ m very sorry , Miss Parks , but the 9:05 flight is completely booked . I can put you on a waiting list if you would like . 
 Well , all right . There are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents , information and other things . 
 They are , keep the documents in chronological order , remove all the chips and pins , punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder . 
 You should always remember that one customer on file is the rule . 
 If you bring them back with your receipt within seven days , you'll get a full refund . Also , if you need alterations to the pants , just bring them in and we'll do them for free . 
 That'll be $ 70 , please . Will you be paying by cash or charge ? 
 Okay , sir , here you are . Thank you very much . 
 Good morning . Could I speak with Mr . Willard please ? 
 This is Chris Emerson speaking . 
 I wonder if I can ask you a question . 
 Well ... er ... it is just ... just that I ... 
 I ... er ... I just want to know if you could lend me a few bucks . 
 Yeah . But I ... 
 Well , I have them in my bag . I'Il put them on right away ! 
 Thanks ! 
 No , I haven't . I've tried hard to remember and I'm quite sure I've memorized the rhythm correctly . 
 What will I earn per year in this job ? 
 Are we covered by a good benefits plan ? 
 Can we take personal days off ? 
 What do you offer in terms of a retirement plan ? 
 Do you reimburse for education that relates to my job ? 
 Do you have a benefits brochure ? 
 Your luggage is over 8 kilograms . 
 You have to pay the excess luggage charge , please . 
 Sure . Here you are.Attach the label to your luggage and put your bag here . 
 Yes , very . I thought the last speaker was especially good . 
 How do you do ? I'm Bob Evans . 
 I made a doctor's appointment for you . 
 Then I guess you're healthy enough to clean your room before school . 
 Bundle up . It's wet and rainy out there . Here's some soup . 
 Soup does the body good , sweetie . It's what you need when you're under the weather . 
 We can figure that out right now . How much do you earn annually ? 
 How many years have you held your current position ? 
 Is there any extra income that you receive other than salary ? 
 Have you ever figured out your credit score ? 
 Adding in your expenses , I calculate that you can spend three hundred thousand on a house . 
 Two , I hope and I hope that by telling me about them you are planning on taking me ! 
 How in the world ! Who came up with seats like that from your company ? 
 Can't beat that ! Thank you accounting guy ! 
 What are we waiting for ? Let's go ! 
 Can I help you ? 
 Alright . I'll send someone over tomorrow . 
 Fine , I'll be up in a few minutes . 
 Are you introverted or extroverted ? 
 What kind of personality do you think you have ? 
 What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ? 
 What basic principles do you apply to your life ? 
 It's very kind of you to come and see us off . 
 We would stay longer . but I've got to attend a meeting tomorrow morning . Thank you for your warm hospitality . 
 My wife and I will look forward to it . 
 lt's Flight No . 302 , Northwest Orient Airlines . 
 Then we've got to get going . 
 Thank you again for all your help . 
 oh , the clothes here are so expensive ! No wonder there are few people . 
 yeah , it's lovely , but to be frank , it's not the most practical . You don't have many formal events in your calendar , do you ? 
 when you buy clothes , you must think about the material , quality and price . 
 make sure you buy what you need and your clothes can be worn for various occasions . 
 that's true , but you already have two back coats and one black sweater . 
 exactly ! Oh , my god ! I love Britney ! I'm going to get it . 
 it's just the right size--a perfect fit ! I'll take it . Oh , no , I'm a little short . Did you bring your credit card ? 
 I promise I'll pay you back as soon as we get home . 
 Yeah . But whatever the planes are , he always has an eye to money . 
 Hello , Jack . I'm John . 
 Sit down , please . Maybe you have read the contract , but I want to give you the details again before you sign the contract . You must have a three-month internship . 
 When you become a permanent employee , you will have the insurances . You will get monthly pay and will be on eight-hour / day work shift . 
 Yes . You can also enjoy legal holidays and year-end bonus . 
 If you need to work overtime , you will get twice the usual salary as overtime pay . 
 You have read the relevant terms of the contract . Do you have other questions ? 
 About two weeks . 
 If you don't have other questions , just sign here . 
 Good morning . Miss Lee . My name is Alex Jones . I'm the new assistant in the office . 
 Yes , I'm looking forward to meeting everybody and getting started on my new job . 
 This is wonderful . Thank you for doing all this for me , Miss Lee . 
 Good afternoon , Mr . Anderson . 
 How nice to see you again ! 
 It's been a long time , hasn't it ? How are you ? 
 Very well too , is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Sure , Mr . Anderson , please come along with me . 
 My pleasure . 
 Yes . 
 Yes , I'm used to being on my own . 
 I do not like the play with complicated plot . What's on today ? 
 I know that . I have seen the film as the same title . Andrews gives a performance to be remembered for a lifetime from Maria to a cheerful governess . 
 Of course , it is a nice song that can make audience calm and pleasant . 
 I hope the opera will be more stupendous than the movie . Have you bought the tickets ? 
 Let's go . We'd better buy the tickets earlier and have dinner in restaurant . 
 But Ben is not a bad man . I know him from A to Z . 
 I can understand that . But ... 
 Sounds good . 
 Oh , nothing . 
 ( Laugh ) All right . You caught me in the act . I finally worked up the nerve to ask Diana out . I was just writing a note to put on her desk . 
 I admit it . I'm a wuss . I just can't do it in person . 
 That's different . When I'm working , I'm in a different frame of mind . But , when I even think about asking her out , I get tongue-tied . At least in a note , I can get the words out without turning beet red . 
 Well , for one thing , she's gorgeous . She's so upbeat and sweet . Who doesn't like her ? Oh , I don't know . All I do know is that I think we have great chemistry together . But , what if I'm wrong . Maybe she's just been nice to me out of courtesy and doesn't think of me that way . Oh ... forget it . This was a bad idea . 
 What note ? 
 You're kidding ! I can't believe you've been standing this entire time and didn't say anything . 
 Yeah , I want the note . 
 Thanks . I plan on it . 
 Let me see . Roll up your sleeve , please . Um ... it's swollen and red here . I'm afraid we'll need to take an X-ray to see if it's broken . 
 Then we'll put you in a cast . 
 Well , we apply tape and plaster to from a solid enclosure to protect the bones from moving . In this way they will heal properly . Take it easy . It won't hurt you . Let me see . The X-ray picture indicates that your humerus is broken in two places . And you'll have to wear the cast for three weeks . You'll need to come back in two weeks , so I can have another look . 
 Sure ! What ' s playing ? 
 Twilight ? As in the vampire movies ? No way , I am watching that , but I don ' t understand why everyone is so excited about these films about vampires . It doesn ' t make sense . 
 I don ' t buy into that . I think it ' s just a fad . Pretty soon this will pass and everyone will be into wear-wolves or zombies ! 
 Of course I can . It's a piece of cake ! Believe it or not , I can do 30 push-ups a minute . 
 You mean 30 push-ups ? 
 It's easy . If you do exercise everyday , you can make it , too . 
 Yes , unbelievably cheap . Carlsborg is less than $ 1 . 
 It's fashionable . 
 Mary , it's not about the blind following . What matter is I enjoy in drinking . It's like when you get off of work . You're so tired . You need to get relaxed . You can't just turn on the TV and keep watch the programs until you fall asleep . You need to make your after work time more fun . 
 Drinking is just part of it . I mean , you have a bunch of friends coming by and having fun . You drink and talk . And the more you drink , the more you talk . It makes me so relaxed . 
 It's a long time ago . When I first went to a bar to pick up girls there , I saw the most beautiful girl sitting and sipping a coke . Then I went up to her and said ' can I buy you a drink ? ' 
 Then I talked to her and got her number . You know what ? When you don't know what to say ? Just drink . 
 Let's play chess . 
 That's all right , I'm a beginner . I've just learnt how to play . 
 You're a very good player 
 So did I . I won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners . 
 Don ’ t you have air-conditioning in your apartment ? It ’ s sweltering here ! 
 I guess not , huh . 
 You should have moved out long , long ago . 
 So how can you stand the heat ? 
 I had broken up with him , how painful I feel . I ’ m going to drown my sorrows . 
 Can you type , Jane ? 
 How many words a minute ? 
 En ... and can you speak any foreign languages ? 
 Really ? that ’ s very good . What about French ? 
 ... Can you start next week ? 
 Yes , on Monday . 
 Yes , that ’ s right , you have the job now . 
 They sure are . 
 The one that stole a small plane ? 
 Did they catch him ? 
 Did he crash ? 
 Did the cops find out why he flew into the U . S . ? 
 Poor guy . 
 I like people who are open and friendly . Those people are usually more active and fun to be with . I like spending time with my friends . We go to bars together or play sports together . 
 I think it ’ s important to most people . The problem is that you can usually only find out if someone is honest by getting to know them . 
 if you know any of their friends . You can ’ t rely on your friends to introduce people to you all the time . You have to go out and make the first move sometimes . I also like funny people . 
 sometimes it can be hard to tell , but if you know the person fairly well , you can usually see from their expression what they are really thinking . 
 maybe people don ’ t like to have friends that are all the same . Most people like a little variety in their lives-including a variety of characteristics in their friends . 
 It fits you to a T . 
 Cash or charge ? 
 Sign here , please . 
 Good-bye , and thank you for shopping here . 
 Good . 
 That's excellent , thanks for all your help . 
 At the supermarket down the street . Help yourself . 
 That radio's pretty loud . Could you turn it down , please ? 
 Yes . And something else , please don't borrow my clothes without asking . 
 Do you have maps of downtown area ? 
 How much is it ? 
 Thanks so much . 
 Mandarin is the language I spoke since I was a child . So I can speak it very fluently . 
 I can speak and read Cantonese because I worked in Guangdong for many years . 
 Oh , you may call him Uncle , or Henry . 
 He's checking bags.He ' s an official in the customs . 
 Hi Mary . We are really looking forward to a great meal here . 
 I would love an appetizer . Are they listed in the menu ? 
 I am thinking about the popcorn shrimp . How is that ? 
 I'll trust your taste and take one order of that . 
 In that case , we'll take an order of onion rings with our first choice . 
 sure . What do you want ? 
 really ? Why ? 
 and the holidays provided you a chance to think over all this and make a decision ? 
 absolutely . With your expertise and experience , you're clearly working below your pay grade . 
 this way , you'll earn more at the new work place . 
 that is to say , most IT professionals can get a pay rise more easily by changing a job than waiting for a rise . I'm wondering why IT companies are always willing to pay more to new employees instead 
 Your achievement is obvious to all . 
 Yes , this is also the competitive edge of our company . 
 no , it's definitely my turn to treat you ... you paid last time ! 
 ok , ok , how about we just go Dutch ? It's settled . Listen , I'm still pretty new around here , would it be alright if you found the restaurant ? 
 It's too hot to read . 
 Which season do you like best ? 
 How about summer ? 
 Why ? 
 But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons . 
 How many of you ? 
 Yes . Babies under six months are free of charge . We offer 50 % discount to children under 7 . How old are your children ? 
 Altogether you have to pay $ 800 . 
 What a pity ! 
 That's OK . 
 Jane , I ’ m on the other line , can you hang on for a second ? 
 OK , I ’ ll be right back . 
 Why not fifty or one-hundred dollars ? 
 I don't know . You have to be smart , but you have to be lucky too.Some games are all luck . With some , you need to be smart . 
 I knew you would say that ! Then you should play the slot machines . 
 So what do you want to play then ? 
 Huh ? You are breaking our rule already ! And we didn't even start to play yet ! 
 Yes , and if I stay with you , we will have to walk back home to New York.Because we will lose all our money and our plane tickets too ! 
 Sure . Show me your receipt , please . 
 Wait a moment . Here is $ 10 you paid for duties . 
 Your doctor has requested a urine sample . 
 We want what we call a clean sample . Urinate a drop or so into the toilet , and then stop the flow and urinate into the cup . 
 You put the cup in the little cubby in the restroom and close the door to the cubby . 
 He is looking to see if you have a bladder or urinary tract infection . 
 Your doctor will call you in a few days with the results . 
 Very well . We ’ Ve got everything taken care of already . 
 Neither of us is very religious , so we decided not to get married there . 
 Yes . The Palace Hotel . You have to be there . 
 Write down your name here in ink . 
 I ’ m afraid a pencil won ’ t do . Wait a moment , I ’ ll find you one . 
 I'm pretty good , you ? 
 How long have you been on the bus ? 
 Do you catch this bus a lot ? 
 So , you have your own car ? 
 Then , why are you on the bus with me ? 
 That's good thinking . 
 I'm not an expert , but that's the impression I have . 
 Needless to say , as a Westerner , it's bread . 
 Give me a six-piece chicken nuggets , a large fry and a large Coke . 
 That's fine . 
 Here's a twenty note . 
 Thanks . 
 He said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man . 
 Nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question , you know . 
 Airmail or surface mail ? 
 Oh , anything up to 3 or 4 months for surface mail . It depends on the sailing of the ships . Airmail would only take 1 to 2 weeks . 
 Just let me weigh it for you . That's 2 lb . and 6 oz . That's be £ 10 . 
 Could I have some fish ? 
 Oh , spinach , I think . 
 Just a beer , please . 
 Would you like to have some more beer ? 
 Of course . Please wait a moment . I'll go and get it . 
 Hi , I would like to purchase a one way ticket to Brussels , please . 
 How long does it take to get there ? 
 Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time ! 
 Great ! I ’ ll take it . 
 I understand . Thank you very much ! 
 How do you choose which companies to work with ? 
 Could you help me prepare for my presentation on Friday ? 
 I hate to ask you to do something like that . 
 When could we get together ? 
 Would you like to meet me at the coffee house next door ? 
 I'll come prepared . 
 What are the requirements to apply for the position ? 
 Do you think my educational background suits this position ? 
 Does this job require that new employees take any kind of training course ? 
 Could you tell something about the job ? 
 Oh , I see . I believe I can do the job well . 
 I almost want to send him a virus to shut his stupid computer down . 
 True-well , do you have any forwards for me to send him ? 
 Good morning , sir . 
 How do you want it , sir ? 
 How about your sideburns ? 
 All right ... Tilt your head to the right , please . 
 Exactly five dollars . 
 You are welcome , sir . Good-bye . 
 Here you are . 
 Yes , one box . 
 OK . By the way , can you tell me how many kilos of free baggage each passenger is allowed ? 
 First-class . 
 How many pieces of baggage can I carry on to the plane ? 
 If my baggage exceeds the allowance , what should I do ? 
 I see . Thank you very much for your information . 
 Goodbye ! 
 Thank you . Could you change it for a purple one ? 
 Will it shrink when washed ? 
 Do you surf online regularly , Joe ? 
 Are you crazy ? What are you doing four hours online ? 
 Online chat ? Aren't you afraid of meeting bad people who pretend to be what they are not ? 
 It sounds interesting . 
 Of course , sir , I'll have a look in the back . 
 I'm afraid I haven't got one in your size . 
 Yes , I'd like to check out . 
 Jack Remington , room 1408 . 
 Which of these is my bill ? 
 I see . So this is the bill then and the total is ... ? 
 In cash . 
 Yes . 
 Good afternoon , Mr . Yang . I'm Jill , Mr . Smith's secretary . Would you like to look around the factory first ? 
 Now this is our office block . We have all the administrative departments Sales , Accounting , Personnel , Market Research and so on . 
 That's the warehouse where the larger items of medical instruments are stored . We keep a stock of the fast-moving items so that urgent orders can be met quickly from stock . ( in the workshop ) This is one of our three workshops . This is the delivery bay here . 
 The steel sheets and bars come in , as you see , in different sizes and are unloaded onto the delivery bay here . We buy them in from a steel works in Wales . This is the new conveyor belt we installed last year . We doubled our output in this department as a result . 
 I'll take you to the assembly shop ... 
 Each ring has 3 small diamonds inside the band . 
 Stop making fun of me . 
 I don't need a guy to buy a wedding ring ! 
 Professor wang can I ask a few questions ? 
 What is the tariff ? 
 Why does the government levy the tariff ? 
 Anything else . 
 Oh , I know . Thank you . Professor wang . 
 Hi Steve , it's nice to meet you . I hear that you're looking for an apartment , and I just rented a two-bedroom downtown . I'm looking for a compatible roommate . 
 Alright . So tell me , how would you describe yourself ? 
 I'm like that too . I like to invite friends over sometimes , but I don't want to have lots of crazy parties at the apartment . 
 That would be a good shot . Can you take my picture here , dear ? Please try to get the garden in the frame as well . 
 Thanks . Could you take one more from this angle ? 
 Now let's have one together . 
 Let me see ... set the timer first and push the button , oh , come here . 
 Cheese ... 
 Yes , but it's blurred and a little dark . 
 Ok , let's go . 
 Perfect . It really hits the spot . 
 I'm glad you like it . 
 Not at all . 
 Oh , I'm glad . 
 No problem . 
 Well , first of all , you need to make sure that you eat the right foods . 
 You should emphasize fresh fruits and vegetables , along with whole grains and protein . 
 You need to avoid highly fatty and greasy foods . You should also avoid too much sugar and caffeine . 
 You need to get plenty of exercise every day . If you smoke , you need to stop . 
 Actually , studies have shown that people who have one-half a glass of alcohol per day do better than those who don ’ t drink . 
 Yes . I've dreamed a thousand times that I could lie down here to relax . 
 I'd like to stay here for all my life if possible . 
 I don't think it will spoil our trip . 
 Let's kick off our shoes to walk on the green flag stoned roads . 
 I am looking for a comfortable convenient way to see the country . 
 No , I've not heard of it . Tell me about it . 
 Is it just a bus ? 
 Wow ! That sounds like pure luxury . 
 I like reading novels about early America . 
 Which one do you like best ? 
 Yup . Though the words he used are simple , but the spirit he has conveyed is great . 
 Excuse me , I am a transit passenger for flight PB965 , can you tell me where to go ? 
 Where is it ? 
 I hope it hasn't left without me . 
 I ’ Ve looked at your units , and I am very happy with them . Your goods are all far above standard quality . 
 Well , we ’ re really interested in placing an order under negotiation . We can start the negotiations as soon as you want . 
 Fine . Also , would you mind if I asked to see a surveyor ’ s report of your products ? I may have a few more questions about your quality analysis . 
 Well , I like playing the violin . 
 About ten years so far . I started learning when I was in middle school . 
 Sure . So what about you ? Do you have any hobbies ? 
 Of course it does . Everybody has his own hobby . 
 Hello ! 
 Yeah , my name is Nandu . 
 Yeah , my name is like N-A-N-J-U . 
 I'm from Madras . 
 Alex . It ’ s Nancy over in Marketing . I ’ Ve got some good news for you . 
 Mr . Morris was so pleased with your sales work on his account that he went straight to the top with it . He wrote a letter about it to Mr . Macmillan ! 
 Not yet , Mom . Why are you on such a cleanliness kick anyway ? 
 Oh , my God , I forgot grandma's coming ! 
 ... I know I'll be killed if I pee on the toilet seat . 
 Which institute did you choose in university ? 
 How many departments were there in your university ? 
 There are many new kinds of newspapers . I find it hard to choose among them . Which is the most popular paper circulating in our city ? 
 What's the reason that people prefer to read this one ? 
 I can predict it will have the largest circulation in one or two years . 
 I have no idea . 
 I was not aware of that . 
 You can't give me a break ? 
 How much is the ticket for ? 
 I have to go to court ? 
 Fine . Give me the ticket . 
 This is Soft , may I speak to Lamely ? 
 Hello , Lamley.Are you free tomorrow ? 
 Would you like to go to an activation with me ? 
 See you . 
 No , ma ’ am . This is Sean . Steven ’ s out sick . 
 Hello , Sir . You're here to discuss the Network Settlement Service , right ? 
 Yes , it's important to be all clued up before you enter into any agreement . To make full use of the Network Settlement Service and take advantage of the whole banking system , we provide internal fund transfers , account inquiry , agency clearing to name but a few . 
 Yes , and it's extremely simple . All you need to do is make a Network Settlement Agreement with us . 
 Em , it's delicious ! 
 You're lucky . 
 I beg your pardon . 
 Oh , I see , since I'm a heavy smoker . May I change my seat ? 
 Oh , did you ? Thanks a lot . 
 Well , it depends . 
 No , I think the music is too fast . 
 It sounds nice . 
 Yes , I think so . It's very emotional . 
 Full of energy and hope . 
 Certainly it is . It's worth an Academy Award . 
 I am just waiting for my friends . It won't be long . 
 But I didn't see the sign , Ma ’ am . 
 I didn't see it . 
 What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ? 
 Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows . 
 You are absolutely right . They are too brief . They don't tell you anything . 
 Absolutely . I've sorted out all the materials we need and sifted three great ways of marketing . 
 We can discuss them detailedly over the meeting and choose the best way to promote our key products . 
 Hey , Vernassa . why be angry look ? 
 I've never seen you so worked up . what did she do to you ? 
 Are you sure she was trying to put you down ? 
 You shall go easy on her . she is new here . 
 You shall just take it in surprise . 
 Try to pull it together , Vernassa . I am sure things will turn note , ok ? 
 Well . if you think I can help , let me know . 
 Excuse me , what time do you expect to land in Berlin ? 
 Do you have any idea how long it will take to clean customs ? 
 You ’ re a wonderful person , Kathleen . 
 And I ’ m so honored that you would want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasn ’ t truly worthy . 
 Don ’ t , don ’ t , don ’ t , don ’ t say that . That , that makes it worse . 
 You don ’ t love me ? 
 But we ’ re so right for each other . 
 How are you doing ? Pretty good , I imagine ? 
 OK , let me hear it . I'd be glad to help if I can . 
 Well , I trust that your presence will hasten the settlement of payment terms . 
 But for an enterprise of your size , an order from us will certainly not embarrass you financially . 
 In what way can we solve the problem ? 
 Yes . But the sum is large , it must be provided by a group of banks . 
 Well , we accept your suggestion . 
 didn't you hear ? He was disqualified . 
 if he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won . 
 he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster . 
 they are . The reason why they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards . 
 I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country ! 
 I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs . 
 Hello , this is Lucy . May I speak to Mr . Smith ? 
 I'm afraid I can't come to work today , Mr . Smith . 
 I've got a fever and a very sore throat . 
 Yes . I have to stay in bed today , but I'll be able to come tomorrow . 
 Thank you , Mr . Smith . Goodbye . 
 Why are there so many people ? 
 Those people are quarrelling . 
 Oh , I'm sorry . 
 Thanks . Could you tell me where I should deposit my bag ? 
 OK . I will deposit my bag right now . 
 Ok , thank you . All you have to do is focus it . 
 Thank you very much . 
 I'm sure it will . 
 Yes . The light in this room is too dim . Please get me a brighter one . 
 Oh , no . Go ahead . 
 It's much better now . Thank you . 
 Ah , yes , the room is too cold for me . I feel rather cold when I sleep . Can you turn off the air-conditioning ? 
 Maybe I'm getting a cold . 
 OK . And would you please get me some hot water , too ? I think I need to take some medicine . 
 No , thanks . 
 Why do you want to be a tour guide ? 
 What courses have you completed at college ? 
 Have you learned any other foreign languages ? 
 Do you know that is a hard job ? 
 Is there anything you want to ask about ? 
 Excuse me . What time does the next train to London leave ? 
 Is it a direct train to London ? 
 OK . Two tickets to London , please . 
 Single , please . How much in total ? 
 Here you are . Which platform should I go to wait for the train ? 
 OK . Thank you . 
 How do I set up an email account ? 
 Which link ? 
 Oh , no . What did I do ? It ’ s asking me for a password . 
 Yes . 
 Oh , I see . 
 Congratulations ! I heard that you are going to take a two-week training course in the headquarter . 
 Sure it is . This is a changing world . Does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? They are very useful for us . 
 Well , good for you . I hope you can get what you want from the training . 
 You look pale today . 
 You should do sports to keep young . 
 It's especially cold when the wind is blowing . 
 What can wearing one do for me ? 
 So wearing a scarf helps your body to stay warm inside your jacket . 
 You know , sometimes I can't feel my ears and fingers . 
 Thanks , Pam . You're my lifesaver . 
 Fine . Here you are . Anything else ? 
 This one looks great ! I love the seashore . 
 And listen to this ! What do you think of sailing , swimming , windsurfing , and fishing ? 
 Yeah ... me , too . 
 Hey ! Look at this ! We can stay in a big hotel or we can stay in a little cabin by the beach . 
 Neither do I . Let's stay in a cabin.It ' ll be much nicer right beside the ocean . 
 Ruth ? Basil . 
 Want a ride to the office ? 
 Hold on . Just 5 minutes . 
 It's my pleasure . See you . 
 Hi , Ruth . Hop in . 
 Of course I don't mind . For your report ? 
 Good for you . No problem , I'll listen to the car radio 
 No , I don't . Please . 
 Of course . And 2 - week paid vacation a year , a 5 - day work week . 
 I came two years ago after I graduated from college . This is my first job . 
 Of course ! Everyday , there is a deadline to meet . Bosses watching and testing me all the time , not liking in college , handed in paper months later and tested on schedule . It is so busy . But anyway , I have been trying my best to be a good employee . 
 It is so encouraging to hear this remark . The secret is to make plans . Write down your goals , short-term and long-term and make detail plans for a week or a month . Then just work hard . 
 Yeah , I've been there twice . 
 Oh , it's fantastic . 
 On my first trip I went to Tokyo , and on my second trip I visited Kyoto . 
 Very big and exciting , but very crowded , too . 
 And the restaurant are excellent ... but they're kind of expensive . 
 Kyoto is lovely . It's full of beautiful old temples and gardens.It ' s a very historic city . 
 I was in Tokyo in August , and it was really hot and humid . I went to Kyoto in October.It was hot and sunny , but there was no humidity . 
 Great . My favorite-soup , soup , soup ... 
 Blow my nose ? 
 No , please , Mom ! Don't make me gargle with saltwater ! 
 Why is there no water coming out when you turn on the faucet ? 
 Well , it's just drip drip drip . But that's not water . 
 Did you call the apartment management yet ? 
 How long ago did you do that ? 
 That's outrageous ! I just don't understand why they're not on top of this . 
 We could easily provide you with a private vehicle , if you'd prefer . 
 Perhaps you'd like to take a beautiful limousine . 
 No private vehicle , no limo . Got it . Where are you going ? 
 What time should the taxi be here to pick you up ? 
 I'll have a taxi for you momentarily , sir . 
 You'll enjoy our new , clean taxis , sir . 
 I suppose so . Hair cut , please . 
 I ’ d just like to trim . Don ’ t cut too short . 
 I think they need a little trimming . 
 No , don ’ t use them , please . 
 Would you trim off a bit there , about the ear . 
 oh , yes . That would be better . 
 No , not that much . And yes , that ’ fine . 
 Yes . 
 How are you doing ? 
 What can I do for you today ? 
 Unfortunately , you will not be able to view it today . 
 You ’ ll need to make an appointment to view the apartment . 
 How does this Friday sound ? 
 That will be fine . 
 What is your nationality ? 
 Where is your domicile place ? 
 Peter , go and tidy up your toys now . 
 I'm mad ! I said now ! Turn off the TV , and do it now . 
 Peter , if you don't do it soon , I will throw your toys in the trash can . 
 Hello sir , may I help you ? 
 Sure . Here it is . 
 50 dollars . 
 How about this one ? It's on sale for only 35 dollars . 
 How about the one next to the black gloves ? It's very similar to the one you like . 
 30 dollars . 
 Is this color OK , or would you like a different color ? 
 Do you need any more of these shirts ? 
 How many do you want ? 
 Okay . This trail looks the best . It's a little steep . But I'm sure it will be alright . 
 ... What a stink . This place stinks like rotten eggs . 
 Suddenly the ' great outdoors ' isn't so appealing . Let's hike a little faster ... 
 Well , we want to have the largest share . Our company is much larger than yours , and we have been in business longer . 
 What are you thinking about ? 
 Then , what would make you feel more comfortable ? 
 After you've thought it over , get back to me and we can go ahead . 
 It is higher than the rate of interest for Current Deposits and a little lower than the rate for the 6 - month time deposits . 
 First of all , you need to sign a Corporate Agreement Savings Contract with us . This means we can go ahead and open an account of agreement savings based on your settlement account . 
 The teacher should give us more time to complete this assignment . 
 Hi , Zina . I had a feeling you'd be stopping by . 
 Yes . 
 I know it . WebTracker is playing for keeps . They'll go for our jugular if we give them the chance . 
 Maybe . Maybe I will . 
 Yes . I like winter . 
 It's snowing heavily . What about taking a walk ? 
 What a heavy snow ! Look ! The water is frozen . 
 I've got it . I like the feeling of stepping on the ice . 
 There is a snowman over there . 
 What's the matter with you ? You don't look well . 
 Really ? I like rainy days . The moisture in the air is good for my skin . 
 Me , too . At this time of the year , I often miss my home in the warm south . 
 Oh , thank you . 
 Yes . I'm rather tired and want to go to bed early . Please make the bed . 
 You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord . 
 A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform , I was extremely nervous . When I looked down , I was nervous even more.If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to bake meat . However , I knew my worries were unwanted . I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was 30 seconds . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or eight seconds . When rebounding to the high altitude , I felt a sudden sense of relief . I did not feel nervous very much , but very comfortable . 
 Can you send someone to fix my internet ? 
 My internet is having problems connecting . 
 I've been having this problem for the last few days . 
 It'll pop up , but it won't connect to a webpage . 
 Do you think you can send somebody over to fix it ? 
 How long will it be till they get here ? 
 Bad news , I'm afraid . Our supplier has gone bust . The parts you ordered have arrived at the docks but the handling agent won't release them until someone pays the invoice . We also need to arrange transport to the factory . 
 Mr . Crane ’ s office . Sandy speaking . May I help you ? 
 Certainly , Mr . Knight . When would you like to meet with him ? 
 Are you ready to order ? 
 Would you like fries with that ? 
 And to drink ? 
 Is this dine-in or take-out ? 
 May I ask who's the manager ? 
 I've something urgent to tell you . 
 Does this TV work well ? 
 Is it a color TV or a black and white TV ? 
 I'm calling about our appointment . I can't call on you this evening.My wife is terribly ill . 
 How about next week ? 
 Do you know that scientists replicated a sheep into an identical clone . 
 It's a big jump in science . Maybe more like a leap . 
 Hi , Steven ! What do you like to do during the weekend ? 
 That ’ s great ! I think they do you a lot of good . 
 But why do you choose cycling at first ? 
 You are really a good citizen . 
 I'd like to have this shirt washed and ironed . 
 Yes , heavy starch in the collar please . 
 I also have a suit to be dry-cleaned . Can I fetch it the day after tomorrow ? It's urgent . 
 Could you please tell me when your laundry opens and closes ? 
 I see . 
 Thank you . 
 Nope . I guess something might have come up . 
 I don't know . I hope it's nothing serious . 
 Oh ? What happened ? 
 Is she fine now ? 
 Oh , poor Alan ! His sister is the only one he has left since his parents died last year . 
 Yes , it's definitely a growing business . 
 Mainly plastics . Plastics aren ’ t bio degradable - they don ’ t break down easily in the environment - so they shouldn't be thrown away . 
 Well , there are basically two methods . One is to break down the chemicals in the plastic into smaller chemical particles . These can then be used in the production of new chemicals . 
 No , we don't do that here . We recycle polyethylene and we make it into other products . 
 By melting it down and then reforming it . Our main products are bin liners for kitchen bins and carrier bags for supermarkets . 
 Yes . That is why I'm here . 
 I was pulled over for allegedly speeding . 
 To be honest , I really wasn't . 
 I was under the speed limit . I was going 35 , when the speed limit was 40 . 
 What about my ticket ? Do I still need to pay ? 
 I'm so glad for your help . 
 I can ’ t stand up ! My stomach is killing me ! 
 It hurts smack in the middle of my gut ! 
 I felt OK until an hour or so ago , and then I just doubled over . 
 No , and I don ’ t usually get a lot of stomachaches . 
 I think that that is the best way to figure out what is causing this . Thank you . 
 Thank you . It has been handed down in my family for three generations . 
 It surely is . 
 How about your academic records at college ? 
 In which subject did you get the highest marks ? 
 Have you received any scholarships ? 
 Have you been a class leader ? 
 Did you join in any club activities ? 
 What sport are you good at ? 
 You are excellent . 
 Sure , I'd love to . 
 Yes , I have a very special one . I will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . A friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer keepers . I was very interested . So I asked him to get me the application form . Lucky , my application was approved by the manager very soon . 
 I will help to prepare food , feed animals and clean up . I ’ m very excited about it now . 
 Ok , I will bring you photos as many as possible . 
 Yes , this week's issue just came in . Here it is . 
 Let me check ... yes , we got the October issue a few days ago . It's on that shelf over there . 
 I see by your resume that you have been working ? 
 Tell me what you know about our company , please . 
 What do you know about our major products and our share of the market ? 
 What made you decide to change your job ? 
 Do you like this job ? 
 What do you think is the most important qualification for a salesperson ? 
 I agree with you . Do you have any questions to ask about this job ? 
 I think the starting salary for a salesperson is between 1,500 - 2,000 Yuan . But the specific number will be determined according to your sales . 
 We cannot reach a final decision until we have talked to all of the other five applicants . Anyhow , we'll contact you within this month . All right . Nice meeting you . Good-bye . 
 My brother joined the army last year . 
 He's tall and strong . 
 Welcome . Can I help you with anything ?

 Yes . Right over here . 
 The pants are on sale for $ 40 , and the belt is $ 25 . 
 Just save the receipt and we will gladly return or exchange them for you . 
 Hi , buddy ! How do you deal with your salary ? 
 Look ! This stock is rising now . I am researching it , and planning to buy some shares . 
 No . This is my first time to buy some . You can see that its historical price data is rising now . 
 Hey ! Do you still remember our teacher of economics , Mr . Locker ? 
 I can ask for some advice from him . 
 He's a hero in our town . 
 Yes , indeed , People say he's the smartest young man . 
 Yes . I needed a large one . Before , I had a separate refrigerator and freezer , but this has both combined into one . 
 Yes . You know I ’ Ve been cooking more kind of food recently and I needed some extra space for spices and ingredients . 
 No , I didn ’ t . I gave them a really good clean , so they just look new . The worktop was in poor condition , so I had a new one added . 
 Yes , I have . I need them to help me with these new dished I ’ m trying to make . I need a little more practice before I invite guests over . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve always likes Indian and thai food , so I ’ Ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . I ’ m pretty good at making curries now , but I still need practice at making thai food . 
 I hope you can stay for dinner . I need a guinea pig ! 
 Sure , what's the matter ? 
 What do you think we can do about this ? 
 Well , sir , I am busy in market development . So I am worried whether I can do this . 
 OK ! I will try this . 
 She ’ s not at her desk at the moment . Is there any message I can give her ? 
 Ok . I ’ ll let her know as soon as possible . 
 Hi , Bill.It ' s Marsha Black at MPPD Ltd.How are you ? 
 Not too bad at all.Do you have a minute ? 
 We're ready to place our Christmas order and we need a formal bid . 
 Right , this is not a drill . This is for all the marbles . 
 ASAP , in writing of course . 
 The usual guys , so you better use a sharp pencil . 
 What would you like to eat ? 
 Would you care for some soup ? 
 Do you like egg soup or mutton soup ? 
 Is there anything else ? 
 I'll get them back right away . 
 Sounds good . I want to go get some coffee . 
 Yes , I am looking for a skirt . What's in fashion now ? 
 Well . Could I try it on ? 
 ( A moment later ) It's cute.The color suits my complexion . 
 Yes ma'am , may I help you ? 
 Yes ? 
 Oh , yes , ma'am . We'll come right away then.Your room number and your name , please . 
 Thank you.Would you hang up and wait ? 
 Yeah . People always enjoy the lighted lanterns and the gala performances . 
 Did you notice the characters on the lanterns ? 
 They are puzzles . It's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the Lantern Festival . 
 It's really eye-catching . It's the biggest dragon lantern I've ever seen in all my life . 
 Very impressive . It's made of glass which makes it even brighter . 
 Let me have a look . Oh , no . They are Chinese poems which describe this happy scene . 
 Well , I have got a vacancy . 
 Eight dolls fifty a week excluding laundry . 
 Can you call back later ? We're right in the middle of lunch . 
 Yes , I nearly didn't sleep last night . 
 No , I just watched Supergirl , and it began too late in the night . I was too excited to get asleep after one o'clock . 
 The contestants are different . These girls perform in free styles . 
 I think less than 3 hours . This year I didn't watch any entertainment programs . Too many ads between the programs . I prefer listening to the radio . 
 If they could make beautiful ads , I could bear . 
 No , I don't think we have . 
 How do you do ? My name is James Green . 
 And here's mine . 
 And I'm glad to meet you , too . 
 Actually , i popped in them last night . 
 Well , they're really beautiful people . 
 Yeah , she is a neck-off for sure . 
 He is a professional football player . 
 Anyway , that is not what I meant by beautiful . 
 I meant that they're very simple , easy to talk to . 
 Yeah . I think things are worked out just fine . 
 Oh , yeah . We will have winter holiday . 
 Don ’ t worry , mum . I will study hard tomorrow . 
 How do you shoot pool ? 
 And ? 
 How do you know whether you should hit the solid or the striped one ? 
 Can I get the black ball in ? 
 Let's go and try now ! 
 That's great ! You need to prepare for it . 
 Get your hair done at a good hair saloon . Tell them you are going for a job interview . 
 Buy an expensive suit . 
 The more expensive , the better . 
 That'll do it . The best way is to find the dressing color code of the company . 
 If you know somebody at the company , ask them . If not , dark color will be fine . 
 Yeah , fine . And dressing shoes . 
 Black is good . 
 No . Dark or skin colored . 
 Necklace , ring , and earrings are all fine . But don ’ t wear too many pieces of jewelry . 
 Not much make up . 
 Yes , some . But be aware that different people may like different scents . 
 It's picture association of the concept that the professor taught today . 
 I don't really know for sure yet . I'll tell you after the test on Friday . 
 I was told once that the more time you spend writing , the less you are paying attention and so you miss stuff . 
 One time I tried just listening , no notes , no pictures . I think I really learned more that day . 
 Yes , I'd like to look at some suits . 
 Size 41 . I want something in dark flannel . 
 It feels all right . But if it were a darker color , I'd like it better . This seems too light for winter . Do you think you could get me one ? 
 It looks good . But can I try it on ? 
 Thanks . It's comfortable . Well , how much is it , please ? 
 Ok . I'll take it . Here's the money . 
 Yes , thank you . I am really far behind on this project . Could you help me with the extra typing or xeroxing ? 
 Good . That would be very helpful . Can you start with those pages over there ? 
 Thank you very much ! How long have you been working here ? 
 Well , we have some special projects coming up . Would you be interested in working on any of those ? 
 Well then , I'll keep you in the loop . Thank you for your help today . 
 Trust me . She'll keep nagging . She thinks something will go wrong . 
 You guessed it . She says we have to get married on January 2nd , or we'll have bad luck . 
 My mom just wants everything to be perfect for us . 
 Come on , don ’ t be so dramatic ! I ’ m sure everything is going to work out just fine . 
 But , you two are on a break . Theoretically he can do whatever he likes . 
 Come on , hon . Pull yourself together . It ’ s going to be alright . 
 You know what , Veronica , I think you should make the first step . I ’ m sure he ’ ll forgive you ... 
 do you hear something ? 
 Yes . I received everything in the post this morning . 
 What's the exchange rate today ? 
 Great ! Do you need me to sign anything ? 
 Jack and Mary broke up . 
 Mary said Jack was cheating on her . Jack was seeing a girl from his hometown . One day , Mary saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately . 
 no , he doesn ’ t . Anyway , she found out that he had been two-timing her for a long time . 
 how so ? 
 poor Mary ! She really liked him . 
 do you think they ’ ll get back together ? 
 I hope she ’ ll recover soon . 
 Good coming , sir . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 You've come to the right place.We ' Ve got the best shoes in town . 
 No . As far as I can remember he was supposed to be on a business trip to Lisbon . 
 Maybe you'll call his home . 
 Lindsay , of course , I will be more than happy to recommend her to you . 
 She freelanced with us for 3 years . She was always consistent and punctual with her assignments and a pleasure to work with . 
 She ’ s a consummate professional and a team-player . I have utmost confidence in her abilities . You can ’ t go wrong in hiring her . 
 OK . Do yon have a pen and a paper now ? 
 Our company is in Pudding new area in Shanghai . 
 Hello , Todd ! 
 Yes , in fact , my mom's house we have three , three pets . two dogs and a cat . My family actually raises dogs for helping blind people . 
 How do they train the dogs ? Well , I mean , it's a long process , right ... we get them when they're puppies ... and so we train them basic ... you know , sit , come ... really basic things ... then , after they're about two year old , they go a different training school . 
 Oh , just one ! We have our own dog , and then we have a dog that we have that we are training . 
 Sometimes we'll see them , they'll have like sort of conventions of reunions of the pets so , yeah , you get to see them once in awhile . 
 I guess the most important thing is companionship , right ! So there is always somebody there for you that will like you no matter what . 
 Well , I guess if you are Sigrid and Roy you can keep a tiger or lion . I guess all types of things don't they . 
 no , but I'm pretty good at eating ! 
 well , to be honest with you , Chinese food is really different from western food . 
 I'm not really used to it yet . 
 like most foreigners , I really like Sweet and Sour Pork and Kung Pao Chicken . I eat them almost every day . 
 I tried once , but they are quite difficult to eat with chopsticks . 
 that's good to know . I'd like to try more Chinese food , but since I can't read any of the menus in the restaurants near my home , it's difficult to try new food . 
 that would be great . I really only want to taste real Chinese food , not just the food that foreigners like to eat ! 
 Mary , it seems that your family and friends have been calling you recently , am I right ? 
 What do they say ? 
 Really ? What jobs are they ? 
 It's great ! 
 This is a good opportunity . 
 You can give it a try ! May be you will succeed . 
 If you have any good jobs , keep an eye for me ! 
 Are you willing to work abroad ? 
 How about your family ? 
 I can ’ t stand being with you anymore . I'm sick of your drinking . 
 How many chances have I given you ? I don ’ t trust you any more . 
 Welcome back , Sir . I trust the materials were helpful to you ? 
 Your credit is fine , Sir . Now , tell me , what is it that you need the loan for ? 
 I see . And what loan amount are you expecting ? 
 I'm sorry , Sir . The maximum we can lend you on this type of loan is 20,000 RIB , with no exceptions . 
 I need some documentation from you . Such as your resident permit , your occupation and salary details and I already have your credit details here . 
 Do you feel all right ? 
 I am sorry . It's not allowed . If you do want , please go to the smoking section . It's in the back part of the plane . 
 We're now staying at the Holiday Inn . How do we get to the airport ? 
 What is the earliest one ? 
 OK , thank you . By the way , what can I do if I want to put off my flight ? 
 OK . What can I do if l want to cancel the ticket ? 
 That's reasonable . OK , thank you very much . 
 What brand ? 
 Soda or water ? 
 All right . Please wait for a minute . 
 How terrible ! 
 I really don't want to go into the world , I feel afraid of it . 
 I know . 
 Yeah . I hate spending all day in there , too . 
 We need milk , eggs , butter , coffee , vegetables , fruit , bread , cheese , and some snacks . 
 Anything else ? 
 No , you get those . I ’ ll go and get the fruits , vegetables , milk , butter , and eggs , you get the rest . 
 Yes , I watched once . 
 Well , honestly speaking , I went to watch it out of curiosity . I ’ d say it ’ s really a special art form . 
 Really ? Good for you . 
 Yes . I want to buy a pair of shoes . 
 Well , maybe sneakers or rubber shoes . 
 Could I have look at that pair of canvas shoes ? They look nice . 
 I suppose I should choose one from the ' Best Career List ' , to be a public officer , what do you think ? 
 It beats me ! I never thought about it before and maybe I thought finding a career is a simple thing . 
 How was the party yesterday ? 
 Oh , don't talk to me about yesterday ! It was the most awful evening I've ever had . 
 Well.John had promised to be my date , but he stood me up . I waited for a full hour in the cold wind . 
 I left after the opening dance . I couldn't wait to get out of there . 
 Very good . That may be the most delicious food I have ever eaten . 
 I really appreciate you for having invited me . 
 Anyway , I owe you one . Are you free tonight ? 
 I want to invite you to enjoy the food I cook . 
 So , who do you work for ? 
 And which side of the business do you work in ? 
 Where are DAK headquarters ? 
 Hey , Doug ! How ’ d it go at that meeting yesterday ? I know you were pretty anxious about it . 
 Great ! When do you take over ? 
 Good coming . 
 Never mind , come right in . I've almost finished.You always keep the room neat and tidy , I must say.It saves me a lot of work , but you should let me do it . 
 It's very considerate of you to do so . Do you have any laundry today ? 
 Let me have it , please . I'm taking some laundry downstairs anyway . 
 Yes , I have obtained an accountant's qualification and a driver's license . 
 I spent a year to get my license . 
 Take my VISA . 
 What ’ s going on ? 
 That can ’ t be right ! 
 I don ’ t have another one . 
 I didn ’ t bring cash with me today . 
 I ’ ll come back for them tomorrow . 
 No . I haven't had a chance to read the paper yet . 
 What's so interesting about it ? 
 What ? How did that happen ? 
 Wow . What does his look like now ? 
 What did he look like before his dog bit his face off ? 
 What's he going to do now ? 
 Welcome to Jinyuan Shoe Town . What can I do for you ? 
 White ? What make do you want ? Arid what size ? 
 Adidas ? They wear well . Try this pair , Size 38 , please . 
 Okay . What about this one ? 
 You are so lucky . They are on sale today . It costs only 250 yuan . Pay at the counter over there . 
 Hi ! This is John Li , is my car fixed yet ? 
 Carla , I know you ’ re kind of new in this business and I want to give you some advice . 
 You have to listen to what the client asks for . What you have just shown me is not at all in line with the client ’ s wishes . 
 Well , speak of the devil . 
 I was just thinking about you the other day . 
 Hi , can you tell me where I could make a copy of a document right now ? 
 That's great . I don't suppose the copy machine is free for guests ? 
 In the good old days , it was only five cents a copy . I'll be right down . 
 Mr . Wilson . We very regret the mistakes in goods . I am very sorry and we are responsible for the mistake . 
 The first problem is supposed to be solved after the investigation . About the second problem , I admit it's our fault , so we will exchange all merchandise that falls short of our sample . 
 I can assure you that such a thing today will never happen again in future delivery . We have made the plan to improve the package of our exported goods . 
 Yes , Jason , right ? Nice to meet you . Welcome to Taiwan . 
 You had a long flight , you must be tired . 
 Oh , sorry to hear that . But , don worry ! Taiwan has plenty of great things to eat . First , lets get you to the hotel . 
 My car is in the parking lot , lets go this way . Let me help you with your bags . 
 Do you know what kind of pass you want ? 
 There are passes for a day , month , and week , and there are student passes . 
 Let me see your student ID . 
 Thank you very much . 
 The monthly sticker is $ 24 , but the actual pass is free . 
 We appreciate your business . 
 May I renew them if I haven't finished reading them ? 
 I don't know why Mark often comes to me and asks me for advice . I smell some rat in it . 
 Nonsense ! There's no indication that he's in love with me . 
 Excuse me , could you tell me where you have got that music book ? 
 It's too high . I can't reach it . Could you help me ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 I like almost all kinds of music . But I like country music best . 
 I wish I had been there ! 
 You have good taste in music . 
 Don't be so angry . It's passed anyway . 
 You'd better cool yourself down first . 
 I know but I have no choice . My stomach just keeps crying for more and more . 
 I've been going to the gym these days . The exercise makes me hungry all the time . 
 Don't pull my leg . 
 Surely not . I can feel the results . I'm starting to feel different now . 
 I'm planning to meet my personal trainer to have the work-out plan fixed . 
 Your father is a bit too timid . He even doesn't know how to introduce himself . 
 Girl , don't make fun of your Daddy . But I can introduce him to my personal trainer . Maybe one day he will be a fitness freak instead of a cough potato . 
 Didn ’ t you punch in this morning , Monica ? 
 That ’ s ok . I should have told you earlier . This is a company rule . 
 According to the company rule , we should punch in before 8 o ’ clock and punch out after 5 o ’ clock every work day . 
 From 11 thirty to 1 o ’ clock . 
 Sometimes , but not quite often . 
 Do you realize that all these shoes are half off ? 
 Yes , but the offer only lasts this week . 
 Very well . We have some fresh red roses . 
 $ 20 per dozen . 
 Yes , they're on sale today . 
 Splendid . Will there be anything else ? 
 I'm sure your wife will love them . 
 I'd like to send a fax to Shenzhen . 
 Each of both . 
 Here you are . 
 Well , how long will it take to arrive in Shenzhen ? 
 Great . How much ? 
 Thank you . I will deal with it . 
 Do you have stocks or a title deed of a house to pledge as security ? 
 We do not allow any request for a loan against personal security . This is a common regulation . But we may consider it if you can provide a reliable guarantor . 
 Good . He is a man of high standing . I think we can grant the loan you need after some further discussion . But I suggest you borrow on overdraft instead of on loan . 
 Yes , I'm thinking of buying some T-shirts , but I find your price is on the high side . 
 I'm not so sure of that . I think it's difficult for me to push sales at such a price . 
 I think to get the business done , you should at least reduce the price by 20 % . 
 As a trial order , I'll take 5,000 dozen this time . 
 That's really a big change from 20 % . I really can't accept that . 
 To conclude the deal , I'd say a reduction of at least 15 % would help . 
 If that's the case , I'll have to go somewhere else to meet my needs . 
 8000 would be too large a figure to be used for a trial . 
 Ok . Let's call it a deal . 
 Hi . This is Amy Yang . I ’ m calling for a home phone cancellation . I ’ m moving out next month . 
 The end of this month . 
 No , thanks . 
 Honey , wait ! I've sprained my ankle . 
 Of course not ! 
 The pain is killing me . 
 I thought leather shoes will do just as well . 
 What are you going to do ? 
 God ! It's freezing ! 
 This is my friend Jenny . 
 It's Snow . 
 They're blue . 
 It's brown . 
 She's 42 . 
 Yes , it's $ 167 . 
 I wish our competition will quit poaching our people , when Susan resigned last week to work for the Sunburst , she was our fourth employee to leave us for them . 
 Well , those do leave will soon find out the grass isn't as green on the other side of sense as they thought it was , I know Sunburst is suffering from inbreeding . 
 With Susan leaving , we should probably look to someone new on board . 
 Maybe we should start shopping around the competitors people . 
 He doesn't mind . As a matter of fact , he's very pleased . 
 Hi , Bob . Can I have the book back I lent to you last month ? 
 Well , it doesn't matter . I almost forgot it too if it is not for Peter who asked me about it this coming . 
 I started washing here about three years ago . 
 I can wash my clothes for less money here . 
 What reason are you washing here today ? 
 Go and get it repaired . 
 Are you going to continue washing your clothes here for a while ? 
 Washing clothes at a Laundromat costs a lot less money . 
 If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company . 
 But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency . 
 Hey , Mom , look what I found ! 
 Thank you for calling the Twin Theatre . 
 The next show is at two o'clock . 
 In the discus throw , you scored 30 meters at the final throw . How did you make it ? 
 Is this your best score ? 
 Hi , Charlie ! What are you reading ? 
 Who ’ s it about ? 
 Who is he ? 
 Who ’ s the author ? 
 What do you think about it ? 
 Can I read it when you ’ re done ? 
 How many chapters does the book have ? 
 When do you think you ’ ll have finished reading it ? 
 Thanks . Charlie ! 
 What do you think ? 
 I would like to purchase it . 
 Here , take my credit card . 
 Sure . Here you go . 
 You know that ? Joan has got the scholarship . 
 But I think Henry is a backroom boy.He always helps her with her study . 
 You know that this afternoon's meeting is cancelled , right ? 
 I sent out a notice . You've stopped checking your e-mail ? 
 How obnoxious ! I heard he was sending you dirty jokes . 
 Golden Taxi cabs , how may I help you ? 
 Sure , where are you ? 
 What sports do you think women excel at most ? 
 I mean which ones are they better at than men ? 
 That's a good point . Let me change my question . What sports do women like best ? 
 Are you saying that women can't be generally categorized ? 
 Peter ? This is Steven from China . I've got the document you want . 
 That'll cost me a fortune . 
 OK . I'll try . But I'm not sure Federal Express picks up mail in this city . If that's the case , I'll send the package through Chinese express mail service . 
 Do you know anything about Dr . Miller's classes ? 
 I'm thinking of taking his class next semester . 
 Yes , I really need someone who is really good . 
 Maybe , but I'm not sure . 
 No , that stuff isn't important to me . 
 I don't care about any of that . 
 Good evening , madam . May I help you ? 
 Sure . Most facials start with a thorough cleaning . Then we usually use a toner to invigorate the skin , followed by exfoliation treatment-a peeling mask or scrub that removes the dead cells that make the skin lock dull . After that , we'll massage your face and neck with oil or cream to improve the circulation and relieve the tension , followed by a mask to moisturize and soften the skin . 
 We have half-hour and one-hour treatments . 
 Well , the half-hour facial costs 50 yuan and the one-hour costs 80 yuan . If you want make-up , another 20 yuan will do . 
 That's fine , madam . 
 Yes , madam . 
 I said , ' Do you want me to help you ? ' 
 Go three blocks and turn right . It's right there . 
 No . It'll only take about five minutes to walk . 
 Anytime . 
 Hello . I'm having a problem with my air conditioner . 
 The one in the bedroom . 
 There's no cold air coming out . 
 512 . 
 I'm going out right now . But that's all right , you can come when I've gone . 
 I'll participate in a quiz about the 29th Olympic Games in Beijing . It will be held tonight . Will you come ? 
 It was held in 776 B . C . at Olympia . It also has a long history of more than 2700 years . 
 Yes , there were no games in 1916 , 1940 and 1944 , because of World War I and World War II . 
 Oh , it's the Beijing 2008 Olympics ' Emblem . It's a Chinese seal , meaning that Chinese people warmly welcome the friends from all over the world . 
 Sure . 
 Would you recommend some materials on the World War Two ? 
 Yes , but I don't think they are enough for me . 
 That's a good idea . Thanks a lot . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 Yes . What's your size ? 
 All right . Let me see . I think you'd wear a size 8 . This shirt is size 8 . 
 Sure . The fitting room is over there . 
 I absolutely love what you're wearing today . 
 Seriously , it looks really nice on you . Where did you buy it from ? 
 I really like that outfit . 
 Thank you . I just bought these new shoes earlier today . 
 These are some Chucks . 
 I got them for forty . 
 I think it's going to be a nice day . 
 But it'supposed to get cloudy and windy again this afternoon . 
 May , my grandpa is ill . I will go to look after him . Catch you later ! 
 You didn't show up to my performance last night ! Some kind of friend you are ! 
 Sure . You look like you're all black and blue . 
 You're serious ? 
 I guess I misjudged you . I hope you can forgive me . 
 Hi Bill , I saw your grandma yesterday . 
 I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track . 
 Well , it pays off for her.How old is she anyway ? 
 That is truly amazing ! 
 Yes , I'd like to book a room at your hotel . 
 I'd like to book a single room with a bath from the afternoon of October 2nd to the morning of October 6th . 
 What is the rate , please ? 
 What services come with that ? 
 That sounds not bad at all . I'll take it . 
 Let me check , sir . You were charged for watching ' Titanic ' Monday night . 
 Okay , sir , bear with me a moment . 
 One slight problem , sir . I need to charge you $ 2 to remove this error from your file . 
 I feel your pain , sir . 
 I agree with you , sir , but all I do is work here . 
 I need some remedies for an upset stomach . 
 Yes , and I also have the runs 
 When should I take them ? 
 How long should I continue taking them ? 
 Thank you for your advice . 
 I know . I intent to go to the store today . 
 Which one ? 
 Oh , you mean kikois . 
 Well . I ’ ll see , sometimes the store don't have some one of new kinds of cereal . 
 Actually , I haven ’ t been sleeping well . I am kind of out of it . 
 I go to bed , but I just can ’ t get comfortable enough to stay asleep . 
 I usually try to go to bed around 11 
 My mother is ill with cancer , and I think about her a lot . 
 I usually watch a lot of television before I go to bed . Maybe I should try something else to help me quiet down . 
 What do you need help with ? 
 Do you have any change ? 
 You need to put 50 cents into the washer machine and a dollar into the dryer . 
 The machines will turn on once you put the quarters into the slot . 
 That's everything . 
 I'm here if you need any more help . 
 Yes , but not here . Have you got registered yet ? 
 The registration office . Did you bring your records with you ? 
 Is anybody here with you ? Parents or siblings ? 
 You are a brave kid . Go ahead to the registration office first , then to the doctors . 
 It's in the hall on the first floor . 
 No , kid . This is the gynecology department . 
 Yeah , It's only for girls . 
 I think Hebes is a good place . 
 Really ? 
 How do these storms affect the people who live in these areas ? 
 It sounds that sandstorms are trouble for everybody ! 
 Did Bean send these dirty jokes to you , too ? Look ! 
 No wonder he asked for my address first-he just wants to harass me ! 
 Is my car ready yet ? 
 It's LF 312 G . 
 I bought it here three days ago . 
 Have your mechanics finished yet ? 
 Well , it was my car . 
 That's right . I drove it into a lamp post . Can your mechanics repair it ? 
 Did you ever take History 231 ? 
 Who was the professor ? 
 I have him this semester . What do you think about him ? 
 What did you end up getting ? 
 That's probably because he grades on a curve . 
 I hate it and I was about to withdrawal . But after hearing your experience , I think I will tough it out . 
 Thanks for letting me know . I feel relieved now . 
 His nose is out of joint because we forgot to invite him to the party . 
 A man is pursuing me . He was my schoolmate in college , and he has been carrying a torch for me for three years . 
 Yes , I do like him . 
 You know that I have had a series of miserable relationships . Last summer , I fell in love with John . But the romance blossomed for six or seven weeks , and then wilted . 
 Maybe you are right . 
 Here are our passports and tickets . 
 Yes , we did . Just this morning . 
 No , sir . We left directly from the hostel . 
 Yes . Oh ! And these two carry-ons . 
 Right . Thanks . 
 Thanks . 
 You have a lovely house , Jack . 
 That's too bad . What problems are you having . 
 I ’ Ve studied home decoration as a hobby . Could I make some suggestions ? 
 Well , I think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room , and maybe some new drapes for the windows . Also , a grandfather clock would look great in the den . Perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room 
 You are welcome , Jack . Glad to be of help . 
 Are you scheduling a check-up , or are you ill ? 
 Have you been feeling any joint aches with that rash ? 
 I have times available for Tuesday or Wednesday . Which one would work best for you ? 
 I can fit you in on that day at 10 
 You can see the doctor of your choice then , and we will see you at your scheduled appointment time . 
 Hi , Gary , what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater . Why didn ’ t you meet me there ? 
 Don ’ t you know our movie starts at seven ? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . Then it doesn ’ t make sense to meet at the apartment . 
 Why don ’ t you try to be clearer about your intentions ? 
 It ’ s okay . I don ’ t want to go now . We ’ Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . I don ’ t want to see a movie without watching the beginning . 
 No way . I want the satisfaction of squishing this bug myself . Plus , what if it's Vince ? 
 He's just a distraction , like a mosquito buzzing in my ear . I want no distractions . 
 May I have your attention please ? 
 Well , my speech isn't very long . Would you please ... 
 May I know how old you are ? 
 What is your date of birth ? 
 Excuse me , can you tell me how to apply for a visa to America ? 
 And what should I do next ? 
 How long will I wait for ? 
 What's the fee for application ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 What sort of accommodation can you supply for me ? 
 Good afternoon , Peace restaurant , may I help you ? 
 Yes , sir . What time would you like , sir ? 
 Fine , a reserve a table for two at 8 PM , sir , may I have your name , please ? 
 Thank you , Mr.Berman . and you prefer smoking or non-smoking ? 
 I'll try my best . With a toward to having with this tonight , Mr.Berman . 
 Goodbye , and have a nice day . 
 I ’ m doing well . 
 Could you cancel a check for me ? 
 I wrote the check out for way too much . 
 I wrote the check out for $ 150 . 
 I was supposed to write the check out for $ 100 . 
 That ’ s great . You ’ re a lifesaver . 
 Which date would that be ? 
 I'm afraid our hotel is fully booked on that night . Is it possible for you to change your reservation date ? 
 We might have cancellations . Could you call us again some other day ? 
 I'm very sorry , sir , but we are unable to do that . We would appreciate it very much if you could call us instead . 
 Oh , hi , Lily . When did you get back from Canada ? 
 How was it ? 
 Well , tell me . What are they like ? 
 Excuse me , are you Sara Wilson ? 
 Nice to meet you too.Let me help you with your bags . 
 Wow , you're not kidding.Hold on a second.Hello , could you give us a hand , please ? 
 Did you come late ? 
 Why is that ? 
 Oh , okay . Well , here you go . 
 Oh , wait , here are the rest . 
 Don't mention it . 
 Yes , what is up ? 
 Sure . 
 Will I be getting any help ? 
 Lucy , where are you going ? 
 Wait a few minutes and I'll go there with you . 
 Good idea 
 Let's check out the fruit section first . 
 Look , nice fresh cherries ! They are ripe and soft . I'll take some . 
 Let's go to the snacks section . I want some chocolate and sweets . 
 Do you want to buy something else ? 
 Excuse me , can you help me figure out how to get to the Wudaokou subway station from here ? 
 An after I buy the ticket , where should I go ? 
 So I transfer from red to blue , then how long do I ride the blue ? 
 It sounds so complicated ! 
 Would you like some more rice ? 
 Hey Mei Hong , how are you getting to Xi ’ an next week ? 
 Yeah but the bus takes a long time . You could fly - it ’ s not so expensive these days . 
 Ok well , you let me know your schedule and I ’ ll book a ticket for you . 
 I know you have a son . How old is he ? 
 Who is looking after him ? 
 You really are lucky ! 
 Where are we headed now ? 
 Awesome . Was someone killed there ? 
 Cool ! Is it safe for us to eat there though ? 
 Where are you going ? 
 What's wrong with her . 
 Congratulations to you . 
 Have you got your invitation yet ? 
 The house warming party . 
 Tom and Bill Smith . They are both working now you know ? And they've bought a new house . 
 It's out in the suburbs . 
 Yes , I have . I went out with them last weekend . 
 Yes , it is . There are three bedrooms , a living room , a dining room , and a big kitchen . There's also a garden . 
 They are moving today . Tom's taken the day off . He's rented a truck , and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight . 
 Next Saturday night . You should get your invitation today or tomorrow . 
 I heard there is a big yard sale at weeks this saturday morning , i will go there to see if there is some nice clothes , do you want to go with me ? 
 How about we go to the yard sale first and then to the university flea market ? 
 Dad , I've finished my homework . 
 Do you want to play poker ? 
 I'll teach you . 
 When do children start school in your country ? 
 But thats only in the cities , isnt it ? 
 Can kids in the countryside get equally good benefits and education like those in the cities ? 
 Do you have a reservation , sir ? 
 I ’ m sorry the restaurant is full now . You have to wait for about half an hour . Would you like to have a drink at the lounge until there ’ s a table available . 
 Yes , of course . May I have your name , sir ? 
 we ’ ll try to arrange it , but I can ’ t guarantee sir . 
 your table's ready , sir ? Please step this way . 
 Atlanta Daily . 
 Here you are . 
 Good morning ! I'm Steven Smith . I want to open an account here . 
 Thank you very much ! And then what ? 
 OK ! Thank you . 
 B , what's in your hand ? 
 Why do you read them ? 
 I got your meaning . Reading is your own solution to solve pressure from busy tasks . 
 I often go to the bar near our dorm when I am overtired . I am crazy for drinking wines with special taste . 
 Shall we have a drink someday ? 
 Excuse me , would you tell me who that girl is ? 
 Would you love to introduce me to her ? 
 Ping-pong must be the top-ranking popular sport in China . It seems to me in every school , factory , army unit , or residential area , men and women , young and old , are swinging paddles . 
 What do you think might be the source of its popularity ? 
 And sometimes a substitute table can be made out of a few desks . 
 Haha , these are very good inventions . All these speak the public's fondness for the sport 
 I know President Hu Into likes playing ping-pong . 
 I see . There was also the famous ping pong diplomacy , wasn't there ? 
 I am glad that you have been happy with my performance . 
 Does this title come with an increase in salary ? 
 Can you give me the specifics ? 
 That sounds fair . 
 You should pay close attention to your manner of speaking . Speech is a reflection of personality , you know . You should reflect confidence by speaking in a low voice , loud enough to be heard without being aggressive or overpowering . 
 Your speech should not call attention to itself , but should reveal your individuality and ability . 
 You ’ d better overcome your nervousness . it is considered an indication that you lack self-confidence . 
 In China , it is impolite to look into the senior speakers eyes while speaking . But in Western countries it is the opposite . Eye contact gives a strong feeling of sincerity . Looking downwards or sideways shows that you are either insincere or absent-minded . 
 Yes . Don ’ t eat onions or garlic before you come . If you do you ’ ll have bad breath . 
 You should never chew gum or smoke during an interview , even if you are allowed to do so . 
 Excuse me , we have book table 6 . Would you please come and tidy the table ? 
 Thank you . Could we have the menu , please ? 
 What is wrong with your face ? 
 Why ? 
 We need a person who knows how to operate and repair all kinds of office appliances . 
 So you're quite confident in your experience and skill 
 we'd like to rent a flat near the university . 
 yes , we are . obviously , we'd like something as cheap as possible . we've heard that there are places for 80 to 100 pounds a month . 
 net really , no . we'd preferably like to live in a quiet street . 
 we'll need two bedrooms . the kitchen and dining room can be separate or combined . 
 how far away is it from the campus ? 
 that sounds ideal . can we go to have a look at it ? we'd like to see it before making a final decision . 
 thank you . that would be great . 
 Sorry , turkey . I have already got dibs on the TV for tonight , remember ? And I'm watching ' Disco Fever ' on channel 6 . 
 Hey , what's wrong with the TV ? 
 Looks like the TV wins that argument . 
 Sure , why not ? 
 I don ’ t know till now . 
 Why they hold a flour war ? 
 They are not feeling satisfied ? 
 But how guilty to waste food ! 
 Ok . Where should we go ? 
 Fine . I ’ ll be ready in a minute . 
 I'm sorry , It's all my fault . 
 Sorry , I had no intention . 
 I know I was an idiot , But if there is anything I can do to make up , Please do tell me . 
 I don't know . It's a rental . 
 Sure , why not ? 
 Is it expensive ? 
 Well , I don't want it then . Can I move to another pump ? 
 Give me regular unleaded then . I will back up.Can you wash my windows for me ? 
 Really ? Well , I guess I have to get used to it . 
 Well , that's hard to say because there are so many good ones . I don't think I could pick a favorite . 
 Oh yeah , that's one of my favorite flicks . I think Jim Carry is one of the funniest comedians ever . 
 Do you have any cars available ? 
 Great , what's the rate per day ? 
 I'm going to need it for three days . 
 Sure , here is my driver's license . 
 Good morning , Jerry.How ' s everything ? 
 Doing anything for lunch ? 
 Excuse me , but can I draw on my account for payment of things I buy in China ? 
 RIB 8,000 , please . Would you please tell me my balance ? 
 Two burgers , please . 
 Oh , here comes a bus ! 
 How long have you waited ? 
 It's your turn now , Helen . 
 This is your song . I picked it for you . 
 Push the red button on the mike to turn it on . 
 I think it's a piece of cake for you . 
 Well done ! I hope I can sing as well as you one day . 
 I hope so . Thank you for saying so . 
 You ’ re welcome . Would you like some cold dishes ? 
 Ok , and anything to drink ? Maybe some jasmine tea ? 
 And for your main course ? I can recommend the sizzling beef . 
 Oh , that ’ s a good choice . Very healthy too . 
 Zina , why are you whispering ? 
 What ? Are you serious ? You'd defect to our archrival ! ? 
 We definitely have to talk , Zina . And watch your back . Elvin is still mad about his nose . 
 Joy Chain elementary school , please . 
 How frustrating ! The bus is still not coming . 
 Yes . I am in a hurry . Please take a shortcut . 
 The traffic is terrible on Monday morning . It takes us almost 1 hour to get to school . 
 That's wonderful . He is killing two birds with one stone.Sir , please turn right at the next corner . And stop at the taxi stand . 
 What is the fare ? 
 Keep the change ! 
 Northward Airways , good morning . May I help you ? 
 One moment , please ... Yes . There's a flight at 16:45 and one at 18:00 . 
 Economy , business class or first class ticket ? 
 That would be 346 Euro . 
 Certainly . Which flight would you like ? 
 Could I have your name , please ? 
 How would you like to pay , Ms . Jones ? 
 Yes , but you will have to confirm this reservation at least two hours before departure time . 
 Now you have been booked , Ms . Jones . The flight leaves at 16:45 , and your arrival in Sydney will be at 9:00 a . m . , local time . The flight number is NWA 476 . 
 You don ’ t look so good . 
 Do you know who you got it from ? 
 Did you take any cold medication ? 
 I think that rest and liquids are what doctors recommend for a cold . 
 A pharmacist might be able to help you if your home remedies don ’ t work . 
 Good afternoon , how can I be of service today ? 
 It is possible to take into account special circumstances , should the manager agree to it . If your credit rating has been class A in your initial trading period and your debt to asset ratio is sound , and then I'm sure the manager will see you to discuss it further . I'll set up a meeting for you . 
 I love that vase . 
 Yes , it looks perfect . 
 That's amazing ! 
 I hope I get an easy question like you did . 
 Oh , great . That's just my luck ! I hate those arty movies . 
 Oh , please ! I have no idea . 
 I'd like to request some more amenities . 
 Well , the free stuff ! You know the soap , lotion , shampoo , etc . 
 Not at all . I still have enough for the next few days . 
 I need some to keep as souvenirs ! 
 Yes , souvenirs . Trinkets to remember my trip by ! 
 Oh , that's not the same . I never pay for hotel souvenirs ! 
 Thank you for showing me your offices , Mr . Becker . I can see why Washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs . 
 The city is beautiful , the off ... , the offices are modern and comfortable , and the work is so interesting . 
 Do you mean financially rewarding ? 
 I ’ Ve always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy . 
 How much do you make ? 
 I want to get some cable . 
 What packages do you have ? 
 What else have you got ? 
 Is there a package with basic and movie channels ? 
 Let me get that package . 
 That's everything , but can I add channels later ? 
 How did you two meet ? 
 Pardon me . Please speak a little louder . 
 Sure . What else can I do for you ? 
 Thanks a lot . We arrived at Kaohsiung International Airport . 
 Yes , I'm hungry . What types of food sound good ? 
 I have a great idea of where you might like to go . 
 It's on the second floor . May I join you ? 
 Let's hurry . I'm starving ! 
 I am so excited to be voting . 
 I am so impressed with the candidate I ’ m going to vote for . 
 I feel that he is very intelligent . 
 Yes , and I agree with all his policies . 
 I think this man is going to be the next President . 
 I ’ m going to make sure and get my vote in . 
 Sure . Let's buy it . 
 Sure . What do you need the most help with , the food or entertainment ? 
 OK , well , let's coordinate our efforts . Should this party be formal or casual ? 
 I agree . Next , we have to decide on food . We have a choice of Chinese or Continental Cuisine . Which one should we have ? 
 Perfect choice . For music , should we have a live band or a DJ ? 
 OK then . Well , I will work on my part and get back to you with my progress on Friday . 
 It makes no sense to tell him about that . 
 Because he'll tell Mary and that will cause us problems . 
 Usually , you cannot prepare for these questions in advance and have to depend on your immediate performance . 
 In this case , you should first keep calm and normal to the face . 
 Formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation . 
 Try to show the best of yourself with decent words and manners . 
 You should admit your weakness frankly . 
 You must have confidence in yourself . 
 Do you have any other particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ? 
 You may ask questions about us , if you have any . 
 Are these all yours ? 
 Cash or credit card ? 
 Not yet . Oh , Madam , this item is no longer on sale , and this goes on sale tomorrow . Will you take them ? 
 Sure , it is 80 yuan in all and you have to give me another coupon . 
 Certainly . 
 Okay . Input your pin number , please . Sign here . 
 Here's your receipt . 
 Hello , Mr . Brown , long time no see . Where have you been ? 
 Great . What do you think of it ? 
 Did you go to the Summer Mountain Resort ? 
 It sounds great , and is it really cool there ? 
 What is the special local product ? 
 I hope to go there someday . 
 Nice to meet you . My name ’ s Sophie . 
 Yes , I ’ m . Are you French , too ? 
 What nationality are you ? 
 No , I ’ m not . 
 I ’ m a keyboard operator . What ’ s your job ? 
 Wow ! I can ’ t believe I ’ m standing here ! 
 I ’ m standing in front of an exquisite work of art ! 
 I ’ Ve seen it so many times in books , but I never imagined I ’ d get to see it in person . 
 Maybe so , but do you have any idea how much this one is worth ? 
 About 80 million dollars . 
 How much money do you expect in this position ? 
 Well , it is a little more than we had planned . 
 I think I'm going to go get some food . 
 I can't decide what to get . 
 I think I might like some Chinese food . 
 I honestly don't know . 
 You like the food there ? 
 I think I'll go and get my food there . 
 Look ! They're going to do the first drawing ! It's for a DVD player ! 
 They're picking a name ... It's ... Darryl from marketing ! Rats ! 
 Hmm ... Darryl doesn't look like the red underwear type ... 
 What is it ? 
 What ? Do you mean that you are pregnant ? Is it true ? 
 Oh , dear , I'm so happy . 
 We need to elect club officials before the summer starts . 
 Let's make it the first item of business in our next meeting . 
 Can you take care of sending out a bulletin by e-mail to all the club members ? 
 Let's schedule the actual election times the week after the nominations . Doesn't that seem logical ? 
 Could I speak to Mary , please ? 
 This is Bob . Where have you been , Mary ? I have been trying to get on to you for the last half hour . Don ’ t you leave your home at 7 
 I arrived this morning . I would have rung you before but I have been terribly busy all day attending a conference . It has only just ended . Are you doing anything tonight , Mary ? 
 But that is terrible ! I am only here for one night ! 
 I didn ’ t know myself till this morning when my boss suddenly dashed into the office and told me to rush up here to attend the conference . 
 Yes , he does but when he was driving up here last night he had an accident and was taken to hospital . So I am doing it instead . Mary , Must you go out tonight ? Couldn ’ t you get out of it ? 
 No , I will stay another day.my boss will get over it . Would you like to meet me for lunch tomorrow ? 
 It is all right . I will call the boss and tell him I am staying another day . I stayed an extra night in Boston last month and he didn ’ t seem to put about it . 
 I will tell you tomorrow . See you tomorrow , Mary . 
 Do you know Mark ? 
 Can you introduce him to me ? 
 I have a complaint to make . The bill you sent me was incorrect . What's more , it isn't the first time 
 Don't you think it's about time you got them working properly ? 
 So how can I make it ? 
 But I ’ Ve gotta have the budge before anything else . 
 Hello , Jane . What do you do in your spare time ? 
 Don't you have any hobbies , like stamp collecting or things like that ? 
 I like collecting antiques . It's expensive , but it's a lot of fun . 
 So far I have more than 500 collections . 
 A set of ancient china . It is really invaluable . 
 Is the math wrong or the way the answer was marked ? 
 These things can happen ; let's double-check the answers first to be sure , all right ? 
 Look at the answer sheet and compare it to your answers . Do you see any place where I made a mistake in grading ? 
 Yeah , I see the same thing ; now we can do the math and check that , right ? 
 I count all of the correct answers , total them , and divide by the total . Does this look right to you ? 
 Thank you for caring enough to check on your scores ; keep studying ! 
 Yeah . I have got much pressure in the company . I have to be wrapped up in my work . 
 Thank you . I will . 
 Why ? 
 I realize that but I needed to make a decision . 
 No problem . What do you want me to get ? 
 Did you forget to put anything on the list ? 
 Would you like me to go anywhere else for you ? 
 Has your prescription been filled yet ? 
 Sure , I'll go get it for you . 
 Anything for you . 
 Just a second . I'll have to check that . Anything else I can do for you ? 
 There you go . 
 Oh , how annoying ! 
 Is's infuriating ! I have to be in Rome by five . 
 Yes , he has . He sold it last week . 
 No , not yet . He's still here . He's going to move tomorrow . 
 No . Tomorrow afternoon . I'll miss him . He has always been a good neighbour . 
 When will the new people move into this house ? 
 Will you see Mien today , Janey ? 
 Please give him my regards . Poor Mien ! He didn't want to leave this house . 
 What makes you think you are able to do the job ? 
 What kind of work were you responsible for in the past employment ? 
 Steve . Is that you ? 
 Not much . What a surprise to see you here . 
 What have you been up to ? 
 Really ? Where do you work out at ? 
 What do you mostly do during your workout ? 
 I should start exercising more . 
 I have a running machine at home . I used to use it , but I already got sick of it . 
 If I want to exercise , I will need to join a gym . 
 That's a good idea . Let's go over the weekend . 
 Aright . I'll talk to you later . 
 Which university did you graduate from ? 
 When did you graduate ? 
 Did you enjoy your weekend at the highland hotel ? I heard it ’ s and excellent place to stay and has good facilities . 
 Do they have a swimming pool ? 
 What ’ s the service like ? 
 It sounds perfect . Did you have any complaints at all ? 
 I suppose you were happy to forget about the outside world . 
 Thanks . Was there a mina bar in the room ? 
 One of the things I dislike about hotels is that everyone expects tips . 
 Rachel , do you like music ? 
 What kind of music do you like best ? 
 Really ? I can't believe this . I am also keen on classic music . And do you know there is a concert of classic music tomorrow evening ? 
 I got two . We can go there together . 
 Mark , you really did a good job . 
 You must have spent much time on the project . 
 Your project made much profit for the company . And the board of directors decided to give you a bonus . 
 May I come in ? 
 Hello , Mr . Liang . I've done with the work . My report is here so please give me new instructions . 
 Would you please have a look at my report ? I hope the project meets your demand . 
 If you have any questions about it , please don't hesitate to tell me . I'll go . Bye . 
 Are you an art aficionado ? 
 I love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art . 
 Art isn ’ t for everyone . I ’ m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery . It ’ s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture . 
 I thought I ’ d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . Does that sound ok to you ? Bus 51 goes directly there . 
 Let ’ s meet at 12:30 . it will probably take us there or four hours to see all of the exhibits . 
 Sure , what is the problem ? 
 I can suggest a product called Techne that comes in a lotion or cream . 
 Hikers tell me that the cream is best because it stays on longer . 
 You can take an antihistamine . 
 You are welcome . Please feel free to ask me a question any time you need help . 
 I finished Young Primary School in 1998 , and entered Xi ’ an Middle School that same September . I graduated from there in July of 2004 , and that September I entered Wuhan University , where I'm studying now . 
 I think I have a good understanding of fundamentals in the areas your company deals with , and I can go on from here to build up the specific skills and knowledge I need to do my job well . 
 Yes . I did some work on that , and I found out some really interesting things about the conductivity of liquid helium . I was sure I had a great discovery until my teacher told me the same discovery already made twenty years ago . I think the most important thing , I learnt though , was the importance of keeping good records . 
 Can you repair my shoes ? 
 Really ? Look at the toe of this shoe . It is worn out . 
 Can you do it ? 
 Cheers ! Let ’ s tie one on . 
 Hmm . Not bad . I think I look younger with shorter hair . 
 I just want a light wave . I look really silly if my hair is too curly . 
 Super . How long will I have to sit under the Hot Cap ? 
 Hi , Bill . Are you going to the commencement ? 
 OK . ( Several minutes later . ) Let's go into the school auditorium . 
 Yes . I find my heart is now rising and falling like waves , all sorts of feelings welling up in my heart . 
 How time flies . Look , the president of the college has come onto the stage . 
 Excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the school clinic ? I've lost my way . 
 Straight ahead to the traffic lights , left and then right . 
 Thank you very much . 
 It's nice of you to see my off at the airport . Thank you very much . 
 Sure . You've given a great help to me in the past days . 
 Certainly . I'll be glad to . 
 Yes , we should go . Thank you very much . Goodbye ! 
 Usually cities have greater traffic problems . 
 I hate the car columns on the road . 
 Give me a call tomorrow . 
 Please help yourself at your dishes . I hope you ’ ll enjoy what you ’ Ve got . 
 Would you like to try my special recipe ? 
 It ’ s as easy as pie . I always follow recipes . 
 I think so . 
 Yes , yes . I've got all of that here . 
 Check , check and check . 
 Yes , that's one of the main things we are interested in . When do you think I can get hold of this report ? 
 No problem , I'll settle that now . You can take it from my Business Account . 
 What flight has seats available to Milan on this Sunday ? 
 Oh.my god . But I have to be there on Sunday . I want to go on stand-by . 
 Thank you . 
 I'm crazy about it.It makes me very excited . 
 It can't be expressed by words . 
 Sure . At what time ? 
 Let me see ... Sorry , sir . We are fully booked tonight . Would you mind making a reservation some other time ? 
 Yes , sir . 
 Dodge Automobiles , may I help you ? 
 No , I'm the operator . 
 One moment and I'll check . 
 I think that looks like a very nice house . Is it on our Internet listing for Open Houses ? 
 I love the beautiful lawn . What a great front entryway ! 
 That works for me . We can check out the kitchen next . 
 Check out the flyer with all of the home ’ s information on it . 
 They have changed the asking price since it first went on the market . It is now two hundred and twenty-five thousand . 
 Oh , I'm afraid I'll be busy tomorrow evening . 
 OK.Thanks for asking me . 
 it was fantastic , but I'm glad to be back ! Being a tourist is really tiring ! 
 because it's off-season , we got a really good package deal to Paris , so we went there . 
 that was the first thing we did . I have a few pictures . Do you want to see them ? 
 oh , that's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city . 
 no , by that time , I was sick of sightseeing . I had had enough of art galleries , cathedrals , fountains , statues , and palaces ! 
 we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . We had a few coffees , watched a movie , and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel . 
 of course ! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery ! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though . 
 What's today's special ? 
 OK , I'd like to try it today . 
 Yes , do you know the nine to five timetable ? 
 Yes , you are right . 
 Do you have any rooms available next Saturday and Sunday night ? 
 A double room , please . 
 My name is Monica Cellar . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , of course . I love the picnic party . It ’ s really family fun time . 
 Right , she is so excited and simply can ’ t wait . 
 He has to deliver letters every day . 
 Oh , no , he likes the job . 
 What would you like to drink ? 
 Thanks for lunch . It was delicious . 
 Next time lunch is on me . 
 I'm serious . 
 It's a deal . 
 As a rule , we don't allow any discount . 
 That's true . But I am sorry I can't make an exception . We have quoted you our lowest price . We can't give you any more discounts . 
 Not at all , I was totally in the dark . 
 We shall open an irrevocable L / C to cover our shipment from Shanghai to Hamburg . Is it at sight or after sight ? 
 Some customers demand that 80 % of the credit amount be paid at sight , and the rest be paid after the machines are proved satisfactory on trial . 
 But such terms are quite common in the machinery trade . Other suppliers are offering better terms . Some even allow payment 60days after sight . 
 That's true . I'm eager to know if you could send some fitters to ensure good operation . 
 If you send fitters along with the machines to ensure that all the machines run properly , and if you provide after-sales service , we agree to make the payment in full . 
 Good morning , can I help you ? 
 Here are several sets of furniture , including sofa , dressing table , wardrobe , and sideboard . How about this one ? 
 I would like you to meet my family . Can you come to dinner next week at my parents ' place ? 
 Actually , I've told them a lot about you . They are excited to meet you . 
 I think you'll like them . My family is pretty laid back . 
 Let's see . there's my mom and dad and my two brothers and one of my sisters . 
 Is there any meat ? 
 Is it chicken ? 
 Is it ready to eat ? 
 I'm very worried , doctor . I'm afraid that I'm very ill . 
 Because I feel tired all the time , even when I wake up in the morning . I find it very difficult to do any work . I have no appetite . 
 Very badly , doctor . 
 Well , yes , I am . I'm worried about my work . I've just taken a new job . I earn a lot of money but it's difficult work . I'm always afraid of making a mistake . 
 I saw your car outside , so I stooped by . 
 Is anybody here ? 
 Quite a lot . I need one pound of potatoes , three pints of milk , a dozen eggs and one pound of tomatoes . 
 How much are the lemons ? 
 Give me a dozen lemons . 
 No , thanks . How much in total ? 
 Do you consider yourself a good mother ? 
 How can you manage to do both ? I mean , it is so hard to be a working mother . 
 Does your husband feel the same ? 
 I would back him up to the hilt anyway . 
 He's my brother . 
 Thanks for your belief . 
 No , I listen to background music . 
 The radio has too many comerials . 
 Do you get up early every morning ? 
 Good habit . How long does it take ? 
 No , my little sister lives with me . 
 About 12 . She is a good girl . 
 Would you be willing to meet the extra cost if we meet your additional requirements ? 
 That shouldn't be a problem , as long as we can make ends meet . 
 We never fail to meet our client's expectation . 
 I come home for lunch . 
 Only 1 hour . 
 Mom , will you tuck me in tonight ? 
 I hope I don't have any nightmares tonight . 
 Thanks for tucking me , Mom . 
 I think it's beautiful . I want to hang it in the living room . 
 That's the beauty of it — the imperfection . 
 Your daughter . She sold it at the school auction . 
 I guess you see the value in it , too . 
 True . With the extension of railways and highways , and the improvement of safety and capacity of airplanes , ships and boats have been giving place to trains , planes and automobiles . 
 The pace of life of people is now getting faster and faster , so the speed of ships and boats seems to be so slow . I think it may be the reason why people don't like to travel by boat . 
 Oh , my god . What happened ? Are we dying ? 
 Is that a no-smoking sign ? 
 What does that sign mean ? 
 Lisa , would you like to go to the library with me ? 
 Sure . First we'll go buy a newspaper and then we'll go to the library . 
 The weather is really nice today . Let's walk . 
 Alright , then let's take an umbrella . Is your brother coming with us ? 
 Wow , it's already 10:00 AM . He must have been up late last night . 
 I hope he can come later . 
 How do we get to the library from here ? 
 I'm looking for the produce section , please . 
 Are bananas on sale today ? 
 Every country should face the history . 
 Sometimes , we , human beings , really had done something wrong , so we should admit it at first . 
 I believe such things won ’ t be realized , just daydreaming . 
 OK . Here is my application form and all the documents . 
 Because I want to have a view of the exotic landscapes to extend my views and understanding of the world . 
 Myself . 
 Yes . Everything is ready . 
 I attend an aerobic class three times a week . 
 No , I feel young , fresh and energetic . 
 Oh , yes.What do you recommend today ? 
 OK , I'll have it for change . 
 Yeah , the air is really fresh . 
 Because it rained last night . 
 It sure did . It was a heavy storm , with lots of thunder . 
 Well , it may rain again later today . 
 There may also be a strong wind coming in . 
 Maybe not . Dust is no longer a big problem in Beijing . 
 We've been planting trees for many years . 
 But the summer isn't . It's scorching in the summer . 
 Spring is warm and short in Beijing . 
 You got it . Oh , by the way , it may be really cool in the evening around this time of the year . Don't forget to put on more clothes , or you might catch a cold . 
 You're welcome . 
 I ’ m in pretty bad shape , Doctor Ford . 
 No appetite , always unaged and I can ’ t sleep well . 
 YES . I ’ Ve lost quite a few pounds since last month . 
 About two month ago . 
 What am I suppose to do ? 
 Thank you , doctor . I ’ ll do what you say . 
 Yes , I would like to make a reservation for May 3rd . 
 Only one . 
 John . 
 To visit our supplier ? 
 Well , I guess you will meet many people in this field . So don ’ t forget to pack enough business cards in your suitcase . 
 By the way , do you know that our company just made some changes in the business trip policy ? 
 Ok , there is no cash advance anymore for short trips . You have to pay out of your own pocket , so save all the receipts from your business trip . And then attach them to your expense account . When you get back , our company will reimburse everything . 
 I am not sure . You can check with the finance department . 
 You ’ re welcome . Have a nice trip . 
 Yes , I would like to buy a pair of dress shoes . 
 Ten and a half . 
 No , I don't like black . What have you got in brown ? 
 Oh , Lord , no . Those are ugly . What else do you have ? 
 Hmm , they're not too bad . 
 She had a very impressive resume , but she seemed to lack the confidence that I think a good manager needs . 
 Did you notice the way that she avoided making eye contact with us while she talked ? 
 When she first walked into the room to greet us , she didn't shake our hands or introduce herself at all . I thought that was a bit unprofessional . 
 It sure would . Did you also notice the way she slouched in her chair during most of the interview ? She had horrible posture ! 
 On top fo all of that , she didn't seem to have any sense about people's personal space . she didn't keep enough distance between us when during the meeting . 
 Don't worry , we'll find someone eventually ! 
 Coming as ? 
 Um ... I have to confess , I haven't given it much thought . I'm from China and Halloween really isn't celebrated there . 
 Oh ... Sure . We have an entire month ! In traditional Chinese culture , Ghost Month is a period when the door between this world and beyond opens up and ghosts come back to earth for a visit . 
 Well , people sometimes set off firecrackers , some people burn paper money as an offering and many people go to a temple to burn incense.Mainly though , you need to feed the ghosts because they're hungry . 
 Yeah ... we set up tables with food , fruit and drinks and offer that to the hungry ghosts . 
 Yes ! How did you guess that ? 
 Good Point ! 
 No ! So ... is Halloween essentially the same thing as ghost month ? 
 Sure . We try our best . 
 Mr.Chen , are you sure you're taking BA - 007 back to Tokyo ? 
 I'm afraid this flight is all booked up . 
 I'm afraid so except we have many no-show passengers . 
 We have the offer ready for you . Let me check . 10 boxes with 50 brooches per box , at 20,000 yuan ; 20 boxes with 50 waistbands per box , at 30,000 yuan ; 15 boxes with other ornaments per box , at 7 , 500 yuan , for shipment in June . The offer is valid for five days . 
 You know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years . The prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where . 
 But you must take the design and quality into consideration . You know we are superior to others in design and quality . We have various styles , which the other companies cannot catch up with . 
 Well , since your order is large enough , can you give me a rough idea ? 
 Impossible . How about 5 % off ? 
 There is too much traffic in Taipei these days , I think cars should be banned . 
 Well , why not use buses or the MET ? 
 Why not ? There is nothing wrong with our buses and trains . 
 I need to get internet . 
 What kind can I get ? 
 Which one do you feel is best ? 
 DEL is better than dial-up ? 
 I'm not sure what that means . 
 That'll make it impossible for me to use . 
 Oh , you can rest assured that they'll be no problem . 
 Your upstairs neighbors live in Canada and rarely come back to Taiwan . When they do , they're never home . 
 Two flight attendants that are also in and out of town . When they're here , they're usually sleeping . And next door to you is me . I'm a quiet neighbor . 
 They are a nice middle-aged couple , just like us . 
 Of course they are . 
 Oh , we are the part on the edge of middle . That's all . 
 Oh , fool ! You're nearly seventy and I'm in the low sixties . Would you like to spend the rest of the afternoon squabbling about this ? 
 Hey , how are you doing ? 
 Sure , whatever you need . 
 I ’ m afraid we are really short staffed this week , Mr . Cranial . I ’ d like to accommodate you , but I just don ’ t think I ’ ll have the time . 
 Not at all , sir . I ’ d just like to push it up to next week . I ’ ll have a lot more free time at the beginning of next week . 
 Jeff , look at this listing ! It says there is a cozy studio apartment for rent , and it's only $ 700 per month . What do you think ? 
 Hmm ... let me look . Yes , it says it's a pet-friendly building . 
 It says it's located in the suburbs . 
 Thank you . My husband gave it to me . 
 Yes I am . I got married five years ago . 
 No , we met at university . 
 Sure.Where would you suggest ? 
 Sounds good . 
 Hey , look . My admirer has struck again . 
 It's an e-mail . It says , We need to meet . I'll give you a sweet treat . It's not what you think . 
 You know what , I think I know who my admirer is . 
 This suit looks nice.Can I try it on ? 
 What kind of food do you like ? 
 But your American ? 
 Jack , what are you doing ? 
 I can see that . But why are you reading advertisements for houses for sale ? Are you buying a house ? 
 Can I have a look as well ? 
 Oh , this one looks really good . And look at the garden . So beautiful . 
 Yes , but my house has large windows and so gets lots of sun . And it has a small balcony at the top . 
 Talking about a barbecue , didn't you say you are organizing one next week ? 
 Operator ! Operator ! 
 Yes , I was talking to a party . We were disconnected . 
 Thank you . 
 Oh , yeah . The total amount is no less than 13,000 RIB , according to our itinerary . 
 Sit down . I'll show you the list of our financial budget . First of all , it is nearly 4,000 RIB that we should spend in transportation . 
 Then we must pay a large amount of money for the hotel . But if we want to save money , we can choose a hotel which is not so good . 
 In that case , we can choose the Youth Hotel . It's a good choice , clean and economic . 
 Of course , Mr . Green . 
 No problem . I will do it immediately . 
 OK . Would you like this report done in a formal or informal style ? 
 I see . Anything else ? 
 I don't like this movie . It's a bomb . 
 Well , give me the Walkman . I'll listen to the music then . 
 Do you mind if I borrow the notes from last week ? 
 I was unable to make it . 
 I was sick that day , and couldn't make it . 
 Are there any more ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Vince , I think one of your programmers is spying on us for WebTracker . 
 I won't say who , because I'm not sure yet . But I'll know soon . 
 It isn't Elvin . 
 Loan me that tape recorder you have . And don't say anything to anyone until I come back . 
 Perhaps because of the dirty air . 
 Some poisonous gas . 
 Yes . I think I won't come here again next time . 
 We waste a vacation . 
 I can ’ t believe these skirts are so cheap . 
 I ’ ll have to get a couple in different colors . 
 Buy them now though , or they might not still be here tomorrow . 
 Dave , wake up . 
 It's seven-thirty . I want to know who left this note on my desk . 
 It's a little green post-it note , stuck right in the middle of my computer screen . 
 It says , Zina , I like how you rhumba . An admirer . 
 why ? I thought Americans were supposed to be more open than that . 
 do you think most people in America believe that abortion is wrong ? 
 it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in America . 
 what do you think about abortion ? 
 do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ? 
 why not ? It's their children , too . 
 that might be true , but I think men should have some kind of say in the matter . 
 I am free tomorrow afternoon between two and four ; do you have a particular time in mind ? 
 Fine , do you know where my office is ? 
 Remember , it is in the E building on the third floor . 
 Don't worry , it will work out fine once you get there . I'll see you then . 
 Looking forward to meeting with you ! 
 Hi , Jenny ! Jason here . It's great to hear your voice again . 
 It's pretty nice , but I'm going to start looking for an apartment soon . Hotel living is not for me . 
 How about you ? When are you leaving for Berkeley ? 
 So soon ! Well , I'd really like to see you again before you leave . Would you like to go out with me on Friday ? I'd like to take you to dinner and maybe a movie or something afterwards . 
 Saturday is fine . I'll make dinner reservations for 7 o ’ clock . Is that ok ? 
 Great . I'll pick you up at six thirty . 
 What a bother having to climb storeys home every day . 
 I don't care ! 
 We would like you to stop by again so we can show you some more problems that have come up with our apartment . 
 We sent you an e-mail the first week we moved in ; it listed the problems we found . 
 The roof leaks when it rains , there is mold on the bedroom walls , and the dishwasher doesn ’ t work . 
 Maintaining basic health and safety standards is your responsibility . 
 Unfortunately , you won ’ t be getting a rent check unless these problems are fixed by Friday . 
 Brooke , are you still mad ? Is your mom mad ? 
 It will be . And today is , too . I just talked to the airlines ... 
 No , they're giving us discount tickets on a honeymoon package in ... 
 You got it ! We'll fly there directly from Texas . 
 Where to , ma'am ? 
 The Grand Hotel ? 
 No , Madam . I don't think I do . 
 Oh , yes . I know where it is . 
 Well , thanks all the same , Denise . But no I don't think.Sorry , I'm sure you would enjoy it . I'd like to Denise , but I'm busy on friday this week and next week too . 
 Thursday ? Oh , sorry . I meant thursday too . I mean I busy then too . 
 Yes . some other time perhaps.Thanks again . 
 A lot . I probably got to moonlight for the rest of my life , but so what , it ’ s worth it . Come on , get in . Let ’ s take a drive . 
 Check out what happens when I put on the brakes suddenly . It can stop quickly . 
 Yes , I know it . I went through my last set of tires fast . I even had three flat tires in two weeks . 
 Cut out , would you ? 
 Fine . I have your letter and I've made some notes . 
 We have quite a lot of import and export information and can give you figures on population , consumption , production , and foreign exchange reserves . 
 But you're also going to have to give some attention to trade restrictions . You can get much information about environment of investment . 
 You have hit the point . It's really hard for a magazine to be well known to people of various ages and educational backgrounds . 
 To my mind , the success of Digest is in the clever selection of its articles in each issue . 
 We'd like to look around the town . Can you tell me the best sightseeing route to take ? 
 I think this route is quite interesting . How long does the tour last ? 
 Let's see now . Cut the potatoes into small cubes . 
 On the bottom shelf in the cupboard under the sink . 
 Donna ? Well . She is about 20 . She is very lovely and I think you will like her . What about Paul ? 
 Could you get me the pepper from the cupboard ? 
 It's in the small one beside the cooker . 
 Oh , there Isn't ? Oh , no . 
 I want a chemise . 
 Could I try it on ? 
 Well . It's not my taste . Would you please bring me a short sleeve ? 
 That should be no problem . May I have your full name , please ? 
 Hello , Mr . Sandals . My name is Michelle . What days do you need that reservation , sir ? 
 Our room rates recently went up . Is that okay with you , Mr . Sandals ? 
 Each night will be $ 308 . 
 Wonderful ! Do you prefer a smoking or nonsmoking room ? 
 Next question , Is a queen-size bed okay ? 
 Okay , Mr . Sandals . Your reservation is in our computer . All we need now is a phone number . 
 Thank you , Mr . Sandals . We look forward to seeing you in New York ! 
 Good morning . There is no reason to miss so beautiful a morning . Is that a new bird ? 
 It looks so cute . Is it a parrot ? 
 I see . It's interesting that there is also a parrot in my English book . His mane is Polly . 
 He can speak English , too . 
 Lulu . Lulu . Say hello . hello . Oh , she is so smart . Good bird . 
 I had a fantastic time . 
 Yes , you get off at the square . 
 Well , you will get there in about half an hour if the traffic isn't too heavy . 
 Drop 50 cents in the box , please . 
 Sure . I will . 
 Awesome , we went to Australia and New Zealand . 
 Well , we went bungee jumping when we were in Australia . 
 A little , but the rush was worth it . 
 We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us . 
 Yeah , It was scary , but exhilarating . 
 How much is it ? Eight films and a bar of chocolate . 
 Can you accept a check ? 
 Here's two twenties.Keep the change . 
 What do you consider to be your strong points ? 
 Why do you say that ? 
 Really ? Are you still playing ? 
 I see . You must be tough . 
 What do you consider to be your weak points ? 
 What kind of people are you reluctant to work with ? 
 Do you prefer to work alone or as part of a team ? 
 what can I do for you , sir ? 
 Fruit juice , cake and refreshments and everything . 
 Any serial , sir ? 
 And eggs ? 
 How do you want to your eggs ? 
 Anything more , sir ? 
 It ’ s a wonderful party , Joan , The food , the drink , the atmosphere ... Everyone is enjoying himself . 
 Bottoms up ! By the way what kind of entertainment are we gonna have ? 
 Oh , how wonderful ! Every girl on the campus has a crush on those handsome guys . 
 There's a typhoon coming . 
 That's what the weatherman said last night . 
 Why don't you go to bed ? 
 Excuse me , this is my first time on a plane . How do I check in ? 
 Yes . Here you are . 
 No , I only have a handbag . 
 Is that all ? 
 I see . Thank you very much . 
 Yes . I have friends even though I am a man of few words . Just like the old saying goes , " Actions speak louder than words " . I am a hard-working silent person . 
 Teamwork is ok to me , and I hope the team will be complementary in personality . 
 Could you show me some scarves ? 
 Show me some of the latest fashion , please . 
 Yes , it will ; this must be the foreign produce . 
 Let me try it on . I think it really suits me . Can you give me some discount on it ? 
 But that still sounds expensive . 
 Hello . I need to reserve a room . 
 Of course . I'm John Sandals . 
 Right now . I plan to be there in April from the 14th to the 17th . 
 Maybe . How much is a room ? 
 That sounds fine to me . 
 I hate cigarettes ! Nonsmoking . 
 That'll be no problem . 
 Sure ! My number is 626-555-1739 . 
 You mustn't touch the wet paint , Bill . 
 Try to be more careful in future . Look ! you've damaged the sign . 
 It says No smoking here . 
 Yes . I am looking for a pair of gloves . 
 Excuse me , but I want a pair of mittens . 
 Whip me if I get below 80 marks out of 100 ! 
 Yes . Can you help me remember how to spell ' beautiful ' ? 
 Yes , but I doubt if I get it . I've never got it . 
 May I ask what the name is the girl ? 
 The tallest one . 
 Oh , it's so . She looks very lovely . Could you give me some else information on her ? 
 How do you think about her ? 
 I'm wondering if she has boyfriend . 
 Great ! Thank you very much . 
 That's right . Do you think it'll be cold ? 
 Do you think I'll need a cotton coat ? 
 Egg , this bathroom is a pigsty ! 
 I just can't stand it . It's really gross in here ! There ' s a stain on the toilet seat , and the floor was wet and slippery . So I cleaned it ! 
 I can't help myself ; it's just so disgusting in here ! 
 Hang on . I'm just gonna quickly wipe the sink and sweep the floor . 
 Is the Chinese team taking the lead ? 
 Japanese teams always play a dark horse . 
 Hi , Janice . Our first weekend after being employed is coming . Show me your plan . 
 What are you assigned to do ? 
 For me , I think I will iron my shirt and trousers . Actually , weekends tend to be the most hectic day in the whole week . 
 I couldn't agree more . 
 No , I rarely smoke . I don't drink , either . I only drink with my family on celebrations or with close friends . 
 My favorite winter sport is skiing . In addition , I am keen on basketball . 
 I like doing aerobics in my spare time . It's good for my health . 
 Yes , I have . I collect stamps , Chinese stamps as well as those from other countries . 
 Yes , I'd like to buy a color TV . 
 No . Which one do you recommend ? 
 Thank you , but I'd prefer to buy a China-made set . 
 Sky worth . 
 Tim's always bothering me . 
 It's a beautiful day , isn't it ? 
 Do you now the temperature today ? 
 How nice . I hope the weather will stay like this for the whole week . I'm going on the canoe trip this weekend . 
 What a nuisance ! Every time I plan to go canoeing or camping , a storm comes along . The sky gets dark , the wind starts to howl and the temperature drops.Well , I'd better stay home . 
 That's smart . I'm going to start doing the same thing . 
 I can ’ t believe it . 
 I plan on going back to school . 
 I ’ m not sure yet , but I plan to do good things . 
 I have no plans on being back . 
 That ’ s true . 
 I ’ m going to be fine . 
 Oh , please do not mention it any more . Last night he did it for the first time . 
 Forget it ! It was a bitter pill for me to swallow . 
 Ha-ha . Last night , I only told him practice makes perfect . 
 Yeah , it will become a wider trend . 
 Sure . If you get on this road and turn left at the second intersection , you'll see it on your right-hand side . 
 You are welcome . 
 There are such shops living on selling parts . I don ’ t like their service either . All they want is your money . But in the long run , they will be losing costumers . Anyway , car service business is new in China . We all have to control what they are doing . Otherwise , they will not improve . 
 Yes , there is . Those organizations exist . You always can call a lawyer if you need legal help . 
 Because they are rednecks . 
 Sure ! You just basically gotta let the caller know who they called , and ask them for their contact information so you can call them back . 
 That's more or less the idea , but try something that sounds more friendly . 
 A little too friendly Abby . Just say this , " Hi , you have reached Abby . I am unable to answer your call right now , but if you leave me your name and phone number , I will get back to you as soon as possible . Thanks " . 
 Oh , dear ! which dress should I choose ? I can't make up my mind . Please help me . 
 Which dress do you like best ? 
 Only all right ? 
 Mike , that's no help to me at all . I can't wear both of them at the same time . I want a decision . 
 Oh , yes . The green dress is very smart . but I can't be sure if it goes with a hat . 
 Are you going to take your children along ? 
 Have a nice holiday ! 
 I cannot dance , you know . I have't such a talent . 
 Nothing . I have told you before that I won't go to the party and that's flat . 
 You have always got your nose in the air , which hurts many boys ’ hearts . 
 Is this the right counter to check in for this flight ? 
 Here you are . I have just come from downtown . 
 Really ? What can I do now ? I can't miss the important meeting . 
 Your English has really improved in the two months you've been here , too . 
 No , I'm going to leave the office early today . My annual medical check-up is this afternoon . 
 He's on a weeklong meditation retreat and won't be back until this weekend . 
 What's it look like , lady ? This is the ticket line I'm standing in , isn't it ? 
 So , what's your beef anyway , lady ? 
 Oh sure , lady , and fat chance I'd get a ticket before they're sold out . I'm staying right here , understand ? So be a nice lady and butt out ! 
 Because I'm no sucker ; only suckers go to the end of the line . It's as simple as that , lady . 
 Okay , lady , just to show what a gentleman I really am , I'll let you go in front of me . Now , just buy your ticket and shut your trap , will you , lady ? 
 What was that you just said ? Last one ... ? Hey , they've closed the ticket window ! 
 Lady ! This is unfair ! I've been cheated ! I was in line before you.That should have been my ticket ! Come on , hand it over , lady ! 
 Do you have a package tour to Hollywood ? 
 The seven-days trip shall be fine . How much is this tour ? 
 We will take the trip . Could you give us a pamphlet ? 
 I'm so excited ! We have two weeks off ! What are you going to do ? 
 Well , my parents have rented a condominium in Florida . I'm going to take long walks along the beach every day and do lots of swimming . 
 Say , why don't you come with us ? We have plenty of room . 
 Can you tell me the results of my home inspection ? 
 I never had a home inspection before . 
 I asked the owners , and they said that everything was great with the house . 
 I heard that the owners must fix all of the problems before the escrow closes . 
 What kinds of things did you discover in my home inspection ? 
 Good evening , welcome to Rainbow Restaurant . May I take your coat , please ? 
 Have you booked already ? 
 OK , sir . I will show you your table . 
 Sure . Go straight on down this road , take the second left and then the first right . It ’ s next to Tiananmen Square . 
 Don ’ t mention it . 
 It is very dull , and the production isn't very satisfactory , either . 
 To be fair , both the costumes and scenery are marvelous . 
 Well , we'd better go to a musical comedy next time . I think the one we saw last month was very good . 
 Me , too . I hate to sit there and look at the same stage scenery one scene after another . 
 I want to draw some money from my current account . 
 Well , I want to draw out 4,000 yuan . 
 Yes ! Here is my bankbook . 
 Yes . Do I need to sign my name here ? 
 Well , I want 1,000 yuan in traveler's checks and the rest in cash . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Do I have to write the invitation cards ? 
 Oh , well . If I must , I must . 
 Yes , I'm leaving on the 14th of next month . 
 Actually , it is a policy in my company . The human resources management department has connections overseas this year , so we can receive training there . 
 No . The company pays for everything . Doesn't this sound very attractive ? This is why our company can always get the best employees ! 
 That ’ ll be most helpful . 
 How much do you spend on development every year ? 
 What ’ s that building opposite us ? 
 If I placed an order now , how long would it be before I got delivery ? 
 Hey , Frank . I heard you got a new job . 
 Is it true that you have a heavy work schedule ? 
 So , why did you apply for such a demanding job ? 
 Oh , I see . And can your family utilize 5 the health insurance , too ? 
 That ’ s a great employment benefit ! 
 I really need a new pair of trousers . 
 Yes , I do . This one is very old now . 
 They ’ re not all right . They ’ re uncomfortable and they look terrible . 
 So Kevin , what is your type ? 
 I agree . I like guys that can make me laugh . 
 Thank you very much for telling me all these things about the college . 
 It's my greatest pleasure to have met you.See you around . 
 Here's the dress you wanted to be made . 
 What's the matter ? 
 What's wrong with it ? 
 This is a pity ! 
 That's a wonderful way to celebrate this grand old library ! 
 That is right up my alley . You say party and I'm there . 
 Will it be an all day event ? 
 That was quick thinking . 
 For color prints ? 
 About three days . 
 Here's your receipt . 
 Yes . Thank you . 
 A glass of Qingdao beer . 
 Will you make some recommendation ? 
 They turned me down . 
 I think the only reason is that I was too nervous during the interview and I couldn't express myself the way I wanted to . 
 It doesn't matter . I'll try other companies . 
 On the Internet ? I've never heard of it . 
 Is that safe ? 
 Thank you for your advice . I'll have a try . 
 Yes , sir . Did you call the airline ? 
 Certainly , sir . What is the flight number and when are you leaving ? 
 Oh , I see , sir . We have the airline office inside the hotel . They have an English-speaking staff . Just dial 35 , please . 
 You can exchange this dress with anything of the same value . 
 I'm sorry . There are no sales today . 
 Everything's going to be on sale next weekend . 
 Okay . I'll see you then . 
 Me too . 
 Yes . I have lost about ten kilos . 
 I am on a diet . And I do more exercise regularly . 
 It lies in perseverance . 
 You should have a try . 
 Steven , are you talking to me ? 
 I was thinking about the accident I saw in the morning . I was petrified when two cars collided . I witnessed the traffic accident . 
 A driver died instantly . The other one was badly hurt . A poor boy called Peter was killed in the accident too . 
 I think both . They drove too fast . What's worse , one of them was drunk . 
 I don ’ t understand . Maybe they feel they are okay and driving fast seems very cool . 
 No , I wasn't . I came here in 1992 . 
 I was seventeen . 
 No , because my English wasn't very good . I studied English for two years first . 
 Thanks . Your English is pretty good , too . 
 Hi ! I see you are having fun with your new computer and internet connection . 
 I can give you the name of a few useful website to visit . 
 When you sent your emails , did you attach any files to them ? 
 When you use the internet , be careful not to give out your email address very often . If you do , you might get a lot of spam-unwanted email from companies trying to sell you things . 
 That ’ s right . Another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . Your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time you want to visit . 
 Take this web page for example . Press the keys “ control ” and “ d ” together . Click on “ favourites ” at the top of the screen . There you are . It has been added to you favourites list . If you click it , you will automatically go to that web page again . 
 I ’ m so excited about Chinese New Year ! When do I get to visit Grandma ? Grandma makes the best dumplings in the world ! 
 Of course I miss Grandma , too . I bet she ’ s gonna teach me how to play Mahjong ! Hey , Dad , are you going to buy me firecrackers this year ? We ’ re going to have the best fireworks ! I ’ m really looking forward to lighting them ! 
 No , fireworks are awesome ! 
 I was scared because ... because I saw a bug . That ’ s all . 
 Oh , and I can ’ t wait to watch the dragon dance ! Dad , can I sit on your shoulders this time ? 
 Well , I ... anyways , I was just thinking of the red envelopes . I wanna make a list of all the things I ’ m gonna buy with my red envelope money ! I can ’ t wait ! I ’ m gonna have so much money ! Mom , can I get a pen and a piece of paper ? I want a new transformer , no , two transformers ... the Optimums Prime , and ... maybe the wheeljack ? I ’ ll get a PSP game , ahahah , and I ’ ll buy the entire class lunch at MacDonald ’ s ... 
 I need to get a passport . 
 When will I be able to do that ? 
 That ’ s fine . 
 Then what do I do ? 
 How long will it take for my passport to be ready ? 
 That ’ s perfect . 
 Hello . My aunt in the US has sent me $ 500 . She sent it yesterday , using the standard service . It's my birthday today , you see . 
 Yes . Here's my card . Do you need my ID ? 
 There you go . 
 OK , may I have your key ? 
 Was everything satisfactory ? 
 You have stayed here for 3 nights , that's $ 230 . 
 Excuse me . May I see that laptop for a moment ? 
 No , the one on the left . Yes , that ′ s the one . ... Thank you . 
 That ′ s impressive ! What ′ s the sale price ? 
 Do you know Yahoo Greetings , Edgar ? 
 Can you tell me how to send one on it ? 
 ID ? What's that ? 
 Oh . I see . But I have done it . 
 Is that all ? 
 Oh . I see . Thanks . 
 As a rule , we use cardboard boxes for outer packing . Besides , I would like to make it clear that each piece of computer will be dismantled into several parts before shipment . 
 Yes . As you know , that's the common practice for exporting computer . This can avoid some damages on computers in the process of transportation . 
 If you prefer wooden cases , we will provide them . But cardboard boxes are light , less expensive , and more convenient to handle in the course of packing and unpacking . 
 Perhaps . That will be more complicated , if we use wooden boxes . 
 That is guaranteed . Each box is lined with foam plastic in order to prevent damage by air , water or stress . Besides , cardboard boxes will be secured together on wood pallets by overall metal strapping . 
 Is that girl your girlfriend ? 
 She doesn't look like our classmate . 
 Really , she's so pretty . 
 I was away for my vacation . 
 Good . I wish I could have another vacation . 
 Thank you . 
 Three . Would you please help us take them to the hall ? 
 Doctor , I feel much better now . Will I be albe to go home some time this week ? 
 Do you think I can get back to work very soon ? 
 Is there anything I should do ? 
 Should I take some medicine ? 
 It's very kind of you . 
 My TV hasn't got a clear picture recently.How ' s yours ? 
 I think something is wrong with mine . 
 That's two for me and one for you . 
 I got a raise . 
 Here are the plans for the new finished goods warehouse . Do you have any thoughts or comments ? 
 Let me check . It's 3.80 m . 
 That's a good point . I'll make a note to increase it to 4.80 to make sure we can accept the new containers . 
 Certainly . Come to my office at ten ten . Be prompt , please . I've another appointment at 11 . 
 Thank you for your letter . 
 Yes , I ’ m feeling very well these days . 
 And I was glad to receive your letter . 
 I will be back again next Wednesday . 
 Bye . 
 Well , I'm not too happy about it . 
 Well , I'm afraid it's not at all what I wanted . You haven't really followed my instructions.It ' ll have to be done again . 
 You seem to be very hesitant about doing things . 
 You are meeting trouble halfway , I guess . 
 That's where the shoe pinches . 
 No , not really . 
 Well , it's very expensive and they're usually singing in another language . That kind of gets on my nerves . 
 Has someone already helped you ? 
 Which do you like best ? 
 360 yuan . 
 Sorry , sir . This is the last one we have in stock . 
 I can give you a 10 % discount . 
 I'm afraid that's the best we can do . 
 Would you like something to drink ? 
 Here you are . 
 Wait a moment . 
 Hey , guys . Ready for a pick-up game of touch football ? 
 C'mon , Yi-jun . It's lots of fun . You've seen football played on TV . 
 There's barely any contact in touch football . People just tag you to stop the play . 
 Why do you look so sad ? 
 Why not go and see a doctor ? 
 Well , do you have any experience in guiding ? 
 What places of interest did you show them ? 
 Good morning , sir . May I help you ? 
 OK . In cash or by credit ? 
 Five hundred and thirty yuan altogether including charges for service . 
 Not at all . Welcome again . 
 Good Morning Mr Jones . 
 I will make it now . 
 I will bring the diary . 
 On Wednesday , you are going to London . Don't forget your train leaves at 9.30 am . 
 At 11.30 . And on Thursday Ms Von wants to talk to you . 
 She is our new project manager . She starts next week . 
 That would be wonderful . 
 The rent is $ 1050 every month . 
 What is good for you ? 
 That ’ s not high enough . 
 I can let it go at $ 900 a month . 
 I can live with that too . 
 What are you doing ? 
 You are sick , young lady . Get back in bed ! I called you in sick today , so you're going to lie down and fight that flu ! 
 Then maybe you should go to school . If you're feeling so much better , you'll ace that English test , right ? 
 Shall I get you another cup of coffee ? 
 Shall I make more sandwiches ? 
 my mp3 player is broken , so I want to change it for an mp4 player . Can you offer any advice about which brand and model to buy ? 
 Oh , that's a good idea . Perhaps I should have a try . 
 that's cool . I can use the computer and the internet pretty well , but I'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products . 
 yeah , if I buy a cell phone like this , I don't have to take a music player everywhere I go , and I can save the cost of buying an extra mp4 . 
 256MB . 
 I'm getting so paunchy that I'm afraid I have to buy a new belt to-morrow , and I think I must go on a diet . 
 You know , I'm a compulsive overeater . I got to watch what I eat . 
 You said it . 
 I agree , but the maintenance team is fully stretched dealing with problems . We don't have time to carry out any preventive maintenance . 
 It is high time you have a talk with him . That may help clear the mists . 
 If I were you , I would put the whole matter on the table . 
 so , are you enjoying the performance so far ? 
 I think you're being a little critical . The actor in the lead role is fantastic . I suppose the chorus could be a bit better , though . 
 actually , the woman playing Ophelia is a past classmate of mine . 
 that's only part of it . I absolutely adore this director . Every play he works on turns out great . 
 quite a few actually . By the way , after the play , there's always a big party for the cast and their friends . My friend has invited us . Do you want to go ? 
 I've never had a part in a play before , but I used to be a part of the stage crew in high school . 
 I helped build the sets and find props for the plays . What about you ? 
 why not ? 
 that sounds kind of boring . Oh , look . They're dimming the lights . I think we should get back to our seats for the second half of the play . 
 Am I late for the party ? Looks everyone is already here . Hope I didn ’ t miss something interesting . 
 Great , here are some flowers for you . I hope you like them . I was not sure if the color will suit your new apartment . 
 Don ’ t bother . I will help myself . 
 It is such a nice place . 
 What are you and Corey doing for Valentine ’ s Day this Friday ? 
 You have to do something romantic . 
 Well , you have three kids , so you knew what it meant once upon a time ! 
 Thank you for your application , Mr . Sweeney . Mr . Jacobs would like to set up an interview for early next week . Do you have time ? 
 Fine . Let me take a look at his schedule . He ’ s free on Tuesday afternoon at 1:30 . Could you come in then ? 
 What do people usually do on Saint Valentine's Day ? 
 What will the girls do ? 
 Have you ever been shopping at Whole Foods ? 
 They have the freshest foods there . 
 I used to shop there , but I find the food at Whole Foods to be a lot better . 
 They don't have a lot of organic foods there . 
 They have lots of healthier food at Whole Foods . 
 Whole Foods is way better than Sons , trust me . 
 What's your schedule like this year ? 
 What's your major ? 
 Oh , don't you have to take that class on 18th century poetry ? It's really difficult . I hear the students in that class have to write a paper a hundred pages long . 
 When is it due ? 
 Remind me never to sign up for that course . 
 Certainly , Mr . Baker . 
 Yes , I will . Do you need it finished right away ? 
 I will never forget Linda . After all , she was my first lover . 
 I remember that someone says that it is difficult to forget the people who don ’ t want to forget . 
 Well , Mike , nowadays there's much talk about nanometer . But what on earth is it ? 
 Hmm ... it's hard to figure out the exact size , I'm afraid . 
 I see.Thank you . 
 sure . Have you got anywhere in mind ? 
 that Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . Do you want to go there ? 
 if you want spicy food , then I'd recommend going to a Thai , Indian or Chinese restaurant . How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road ? 
 you're right . Most of their dishes have sweet sauces . We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us . 
 the Taj it is then . 
 they'll still charge us a corkage fee . 
 don't worry about money . I'll treat you tonight . 
 no , I'll pay . It's my turn anyway . You paid last time . 
 I'm calling to cancel a reservation I made earlier in the week . 
 Rudy Randolph , 818-555-1234 . My reservation begins on the second Monday of April . 
 Thanks . I'll call again when things get better at home . 
 What can I help you with today ? 
 What is the problem ? 
 Do you have enough money in your account ? 
 Let me check that for you right now . 
 Apparently there is only $ 57 left in your account . 
 That ’ s what my records show . 
 Could you just run through the evacuation procedure ? 
 Should we use the stairs ? 
 I can't stand being with you any more . I'm sick of your drinking . 
 How many chances have I given you , I've given up on you . 
 It's not just for your drinking . But you are lacking sense of responsibility . 
 Even if I was seriously ill you couldn't spare a moment . 
 I just don't trust you any more . 
 Do you remember when and where you last saw it ? 
 Could you please tell me your passport number ? 
 And what is the expiration date on your passport ? 
 I see . Please fill out this form . And you need to contact your embassy or consulate to report it as soon as possible . 
 Mr . Smith is not in his office . I am afraid he will not be back before 3 pm . Would you care to speak to Mr . Brown who takes all the calls in his absence ? 
 OK , I'll tell him that you called . 
 Hello . Yes , I've just read your leaflet about the new MoneyLink Card . I was wondering how I go about applying for one . 
 That does sound good . I'm already an account holder , have been for many years . And I already have your existing card . 
 Perhaps your letter is already in the mail ! So , I can just upgrade automatically ? 
 Certainly ... 
 Wonderful ! And , you mentioned ' perks ' ? I do hope I'll be getting some of those . 
 Let me have a look . Oh , yes . This one is the IC phone and the other is the coin phone . If you have an IC card , you can insert it into this slot , wait for the dialing signal appearing on the small screen , and then dial the number of the person you are going to call . 
 First , you pick up the receiver , wait for the dialing signal , dial the number , and then put the coin into the slot , press the ' speak ' button . Then everything is done . 
 Can I help you sir , what do you need ? 
 Of course sir , no problem . 
 Don't talk too much , Tom . We are on duty today , we should hurry up . 
 Tom , your task is to clean the blackboard . 
 I'm going to sweep the floor first . 
 Stand on the chair , Pig Tom . Use your brain . 
 How about the podium ? 
 Be quick , please . Our teacher and classmates will come soon . 
 Jane's mother always wants her to marry a big shot . J 
 But it's unfair for Jane . 
 Yes . I'd like to book a room , please . 
 March the 23rd . 
 Three nights . 
 Er ... double with bath . I'd appreciate it if you could give me a room with a view over the lake . 
 Fine . How much is the charge per night ? 
 No , thanks . 
 That's fine . 
 Mr and Mrs Ryefield , that's R-Y-E-F-I-E-L-D . 
 Yes it is . Thank you . 
 Goodbye . 
 I would need to check on that . Where is the fundraiser ? 
 What day will you need it for ? 
 Maybe that could work . I need to know who will be driving it . 
 If I give you the keys to the garage , could you bring it back on Sunday evening ? 
 OK , but make sure that everything is back by Sunday night at the latest . 
 OK , I'll get it . It's for you , Jeff . 
 How many people are in your family ? 
 I have one daughter and one son . Then there ’ s my husband and I . What about your parents ? Do they live with your family ? 
 My parents live by themselves now . When they get older , they ’ ll probably go to a retirement home . Do you just have one brother ? 
 I also grew up in a big family . I have one older brother and three younger sisters . 
 About seven years now . and you ? 
 It ’ s becoming more and more common . However , I don ’ t ever want to get divorced myself ! What about you ? 
 If that happens , maybe you could marry my brother and we could become in-laws ! 
 Of course not ! 
 My friend and I was argued with each other . For this , I ’ m very sad . Because I don ’ t want to lose this friend . 
 Thank you , but I really want to relax myself . I ’ m very sorry . 
 I am sorry , sir . I have broken the reading lamp in my room . 
 503 . I would like to pay for it . 
 OK , can you bring me a new one ? 
 I'm very sorry , sir . My car has broken down . 
 I'm afraid not . 
 Although you spare no effort to complete the project . I think you have missed the boat . 
 What is my schedule for today , Miss Liu ? 
 Do you have the meeting report ready ? 
 Hi . Can you give me a wake-up call tomorrow ? 
 I need two wake-up calls , if you don't mind , one at 7 and the other at 7 fifteen . 
 On second thought , you'd better make that second call at 7 thirty instead of 7 fifteen . 
 No , that gets it for now , thank you . 
 Hi ! How are you doing ? 
 Pretty good . Say , where are you living this semester ? 
 Oh , I am looking for an apartment . I prefer living off campus . I can study better . 
 Okay , see you around . 
 You are studying here , aren ’ t you ? 
 Do you like this campus ? 
 How come ? 
 Oh.It ’ s awful , but it can ’ t be helped . 
 This is our main service area . We do all the routine services here and have two full-time mechanics . 
 They're serviced regularly . We give them a basic service every 10,000 km or so and a main service once a year , or every 100,000 km . 
 Well , the same as for private vehicles really , but we do it more often because they get a lot of wear and tear . 
 Yes , we've got all the necessary equipment . We can give the engines a major overhaul . If there's a serious problem , we strip down the engine and find the faulty component . Would you like to look around ? 
 I need to make an appointment to see the doctor . 
 Good , but can you tell me how to get to your office ? 
 Haven ’ t you heard ? Richard was fired by our manager . 
 Believe it or not . Everybody is talking about it in the company . 
 Me too . 
 Sure , you want a continental one or an American one ? 
 OK , sir , yours will be ready in a few seconds . 
 You moved to a new place ? 
 Thank you for inviting me . Sounds lovely ! I would like to come . Where is your new apartment ? 
 Who else will come ? 
 Ok , I will be there around 6 . Is that ok for you ? 
 Have you been coming to this Laundromat long ? 
 Why is that ? 
 I've just started doing my clothes here . 
 My washing machine broke down . 
 It's too expensive to get it fixed . 
 Yeah , I think that's what I'm going to have to do . 
 Now let's begin the class . Who is on duty today ? 
 Please come to the front to have five minutes ’ free talk in English . Very well ! Whose turn is it to have a free talk ? 
 Well . Don't forget to perform your duty next time , ok ? Now , let's start our lesson . 
 Here you are . 
 Business . 
 Don ’ t you think it would be an idea to name the ship Dolphin ? 
 So you ’ Ve got something on your mind , I guess . 
 Hello . Is Vanessa there ? 
 Hi , Vanessa . I ’ m Don . I ’ m calling from Seller ’ s Market . Are you still interested in a position as a cashier ? 
 Yes , it is . Please come to see me tomorrow afternoon at 2 00 for a job interview . 
 You ’ re welcome . I ’ ll see you tomorrow at 2 00 . 
 Hello ! Is Mr . Green there ? 
 This is Li with Silk Company . We met last Sunday during the exhibition . 
 Thank you for visiting our products . I remember that you are interested in our silk products and so , could I have a meeting with you this week to show you moreinformation about our products ? 
 What about next week ? Is it convenient for you ? 
 Any time you say is OK . 
 Excuse me . Would you mind trading seats with me ? 
 Oh , thank you . That ’ s very kind of you . 
 Oh , you do ? Good . Looking out of the window sometimes scares me . So I prefer to be the man in the middle . 
 I'd like to buy some perform for my girlfriend . 
 she usually doesn't wear anything but a few drops of Chanel No . 5 . But I'd like to buy her a new Fragrance . 
 which one would you recommend ? 
 that smells great . I'll take one bottle , please . 
 it's ok . She normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder , and I wouldn't know what shade to buy . 
 she doesn't usually wear lipstick . She thinks it makes her nose look too big . 
 no thank you . She has big enough eyes as it is . 
 no thanks . Western women usually try to make their skin darker , no lighter . 
 that will be all . You're been very helpful , thanks . 
 He is playing hob with the fact . 
 Because he stayed with me all the time that night . 
 I had the soup and bruschetta which all together is £ 4.50 and my trout for the main course was £ 12 . 
 Yes and shall we go fifty-fifty for the wine ? 
 So now your bill comes to £ 20.15 and I need to pay £ 22.50 . 
 And is that all ? 
 So now my bill is £ 24.50 and yours come to £ 23.65 . Is that correct ? 
 I think £ 5 would be good . 
 Oh , thank you very much . I ’ d like to come , but I ’ m afraid I ’ m busy that evening . 
 Well , I ’ m not too sure , actually . I ’ Ve got a lot going on the next couple of weeks . Why don ’ t I call you later ? 
 I'd like to speak with the apartment manager , please . 
 I'm interested in the apartment on Main Street . 
 Yes , I would very much like to see it . 
 I have no problem with 6 p . m . 
 No , thanks . I already drove by to see what the neighborhood looks like . 
 Should I bring anything with me ? 
 Let's go to Wangfujing by bus . 
 OK , it will be a new experience for me . 
 Where do we pay the fare ? 
 Let me pay for it . Where can I get a subway map ? 
 Do I have to pay an additional fare to change trains ? 
 Hello , Bill.May I borrow your pen ? 
 The blue one , please . 
 I wonder if the dentist could fit me in early tomorrow . 
 How about 12:45 ? 
 I don ’ t know why bucks have such a great charm that a great many people are after nothing else . 
 But many rich guys don ’ t think they are truly happy . There is always some empty feeling deep inside them . 
 I'm sick . I think I've got the flu . 
 Excuse me , but do you have this T-shirt in size L ? 
 Too bad . I really like it . 
 Do you have it in size L ? 
 Where is the fitting room ? 
 Thanks . 
 I see what you mean . 
 Let me handle it . 
 That's right . Here you go . 
 OK , as I expected . How much will you allow me to borrow ? I mean , I don't need a massive sum of money . 
 That'll be enough , and the repayment period sounds good to me . 
 How soon before this goes through ? 
 Perfect . So , I guess my next job is to go to the newsagent and buy some car magazines . Thanks for everything . 
 I should be coming in on the 11:30 mooring flight . How far is the office from the airport ? 
 That ’ s right . I ’ ll be in the baggage area . 
 I like basketball . I really enjoy watching the NBA games on TV . 
 I don ’ t really have one but I support Huston . 
 I think they do , but I ’ m biased . They have a good manager and a great coach . 
 I have the same problem . The players are really very skilful . I wish I could play that well . 
 Yes , I do . We ’ re doing pretty well this season . We ’ Ve won most of our games , but we ’ re not top of the league table . 
 We ’ Ve got four more games . I hope we can win all of them . 
 Really ? He is so great . 
 Surely I want . It's quite popular nowadays . 
 You are going to be really jealous when you find out where I ’ m headed for the holidays ! 
 You got it ! I ’ m going to spend two fabulous weeks in Hawaii ! 
 What are your plans for the future if you are hired ? 
 Do you have any short-term goals ? 
 What ’ s the postage on this letter to hongkong , please ? 
 Yes , Five one dollar stamps , please . 
 We will have a vacation next month . Why not have a tour ? 
 What about going to Xi'an ? 
 So what's your plan ? 
 So we'll compromise . We'll hit the Huangshan in Anti . 
 Yes , madam , can I help you ? 
 We have the medicine for that . I'll go and get it for you . 
 Certainly . I'll be back right away . 
 Yes , how should I set up my new computer ? 
 Great , thanks a lot . 
 You're telling me . 
 To the cinema . What about coming with me ? 
 What a pity . I believe it's a very good film . 
 Once a week . Most nights I sit at home and watch telly 
 No , I'm sorry I don't . I never read the papers till I get home . 
 I don't know yet . My wife's going to her mother's for a couple of weeks . She Livesay the sea , you know . 
 Yes , but I want to go to the country . 
 Yes , very much . But I need peace and quiet when I'm on holiday . What are coughing to do ? 
 Aren't you going to have a holiday abroad this year ? 
 Many congratulations on your winning the game . 
 You were doing great out there ! 
 Do you know who that tall man is ? 
 Do you know where he comes from ? 
 So how long have you known Mary ? 
 Only four days ! That's so short , and you seem so crazy about her . 
 Shall we go out tonight ? 
 We'd better ask dad first . 
 Linda , do you know Mr.Green ? 
 Please meet him now . 
 Mom , I'm ready for school . 
 I know , mom . 
 Oh , my jump rope . Mom , can you get it for me ? 
 Hello , Mr . Clark . You ’ re early for lunch . It ’ s only eleven o ’ clock . 
 What would you like today ? 
 And would you like salad ? The salad plate today is lettuce , tomatoes , and black olives . 
 About 12 hours . 
 Most people do when they travel long distances . 
 8: 00 Beijing time . 
 It ’ s harmful not only for yourself but for others . 
 Stop producing cigarettes . 
 That ’ s right . But I don ’ t think there are better ways . 
 Maybe it can take effect . 
 Promise ? 
 I'm doing great . What about you ? 
 Everything's been good with you ? 
 I started school recently . 
 I'm going to PCC . 
 I like it so far . My classes are pretty good right now . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 I'm going to be studying overseas next year and I'd like some info about suitable loans . To be honest , I'm not even sure if I can get a loan . 
 Would I have to get my parents to guarantor the loan ? 
 I see . What about age limitations ? 
 Got it ! I fit into that category very nicely . That's great ! I'll have a chat with my parents and come back . Thanks very much . 
 You said it . We ’ er breathing poisonous air every day . 
 I absolutely agree with you . 
 I'm not sure I'm following you , sir . 
 Oh , now I understand ! So , you've already used up all your amenities ? 
 I'm losing you , sir . What's the problem ? 
 Okay , I got it . You're collecting souvenirs ! 
 Have you visited our souvenir shop , sir ? It's loaded with all kinds of items . 
 Sir , housekeeping will bring you a basketful of amenities momentarily . 
 You are in the right place . Please come on in ! 
 It ’ s going to come together just fine . Trust me ! 
 We start at the top with our name and contact information . Make sure the information is current . 
 Put your job experience first , if that is more impressive than your education . 
 Yes , that would make a good ending for your resume . 
 Not too good actually , people are not spending as much as before ! 
 Lots of reasons I guess , unemployment is pretty high these days . 
 Don't ask me . 
 Thank you Bill , and good morning Salt Lake City ! 
 Well , it ’ s a bit of a mixed bag in Utah today . we ’ Ve got heavy cloud cover here in Northern Utah , and we ’ re calling for scattered showers throughout the day , with a day-time high of forty-five degrees.Now , if we move down to the south of the state , we can see that a cold front is moving in.We can expect clear skies , but it will be quite cold , with temperatures hovering around the thirty degree mark . 
 Well , it ’ ll be a rainy day for Northern Utah.we can expect some isolated downpours in the morning . Winds will be coming in from the North East , with gusts reaching twenty-three miles per hour . Salt Lake City can expect the rain to turn to sleet in the evening . Things are looking a bit better for the South.we ’ ll see cloudy skies with a chance of showers . Later in the day , we can expect partlycloudy skies , with a forecast high of thirty-eight degrees . 
 That ’ s right Bill . We will have more later on today on the six o ’ clock news . That ’ s the weather forecast for this morning . 
 Well , it's a bit overweight . You must pay extra for it . 
 We demand a surcharge of 80 cents for it . 
 Pretty good , thanks . And you ? 
 The United Nations should have more authority . 
 Could I speak to Diana Curzon ? 
 This is John Laing from Dantons . 
 Yes , please . I'm actually returning her call . So perhaps you could tell her that I called . 
 She must have , but let me give it to you anyway . It's 01705 455623 . 
 455623 . 
 That's right . 
 Thank you . 
 I attended school today . Did you ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . Would you like the assignments from English class ? 
 It's no trouble at all . 
 Thanks . See you at school tomorrow if you feel better . 
 Why don't you have any money for another bus ? 
 That was smart . 
 I don't have any . 
 Get a transfer from the bus driver . 
 It doesn't cost anything . 
 You know what ? Don't mention it . 
 All right . One moment , please ... No , Mr . Smith checked out this morning . 
 I ' m afraid he didn ’ t leave one . 
 Mr.Black , if I'm not mistaken . 
 Pleased to see you.too . 
 There are 3 secretarial categories here . One is receptionist , one is junior secretary , and the other is senior secretary . 
 I would like to be able to work independently and take over some ordinary responsibilities such as answering routine correspondences , taking phone calls , and sometimes assisting you with personal business affairs . 
 I'm looking for a Sharp DVD Player . 
 Yes . The DS102 series . 
 Will you be getting more in . 
 Excuse me , would you please do me a favor ? 
 I appreciate the building so much . I am wondering if you could take a picture of me against the building . 
 That's OK , Ben , just let it go . I thought you were just a little too much into it . 
 Honey , have you ever heard that there are a lot of stray cats now . 
 Now they are collected by some volunteers , and people can adopt them or make a donation for the shelters . 
 I want to adopt a cat , and it can be Barbie's boyfriend too . 
 That's all right . At least I got myself left . 
 I hope that he would grant me with that . 
 Excuse me , can you tell me where the post office is ? 
 I'm afraid I don't quite understand . 
 Excuse me.Does this train go to Brooklyn ? 
 Do you know when it leaves ? 
 So , what do you plan to do today ? 
 Did you buy tickets already ? 
 Well , probably . Probably you will have to wait in line if you don't have tickets . 
 Outside , on the sidewalk . 
 The MYOMA is very popular . There will be a lot of people . 
 Oh , sorry.It stands for the Museum of Modern Art . It's an acronym . M O M A MYOMA . 
 I suggest you go to the Jewish Museum.It ' s not far from the Guggenheim , near Central Park . It is really very interesting.Also , there is a great museum of medieval European art further up north.It ' s called the Cloisters . 
 You can take a bus . 
 how are you doing , Christopher ? 
 are you doing anything this weekend ? 
 are you available on Sunday ? 
 ok , well , my friends and I are planning on going to the beach on Sunday . We tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere , so you could still sleep in . Do you want to come with us ? 
 it's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city . 
 we've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you'll have to bring your own sunlounger . 
 do you like surfing ? 
 we've got a few . I can teach you how to surf on Sunday . It'll be fun ! 
 you'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . My friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money . 
 we'll pick you up at your place at noon . Be there or be square ! 
 You are not late , Mr . Thomas . There're still 15 minutes to go . Mr . White has just called you . 
 He said there was a traffic jam , but he is coming . 
 I told you that she is no fool . 
 She cannot get in Dutch with him . He is her boss , you know . 
 I work so hard that I do not have the energy to exercise . 
 But I work hard all the time for long hours . Often I have no time for lunch . Yet , I am still getting fatter . 
 I know you're right , but what can I do ? 
 But I'll miss the news.It ' s important in my business to keep up with events in China . 
 That's a good idea ! 
 I wouldn't be so sure ... People want to wear what they feel most comfortable in . 
 I think what you wear is so overrated . I would rather have a down-to-earth , honest and solid sales person than a painted , patent leather , designer suite salesman . 
 Maybe you're right , but I'll take my sneakers and jeans any day ! 
 How would you like to send it ? 
 Sixty cents please . 
 Please write down the zip code in the mailing address . 
 OK . please give me twenty cents . 
 You're welcome . 
 I would love the help ! Would you prefer helping with the writing part or is programming more your thing ? 
 Perfect ! You'll be working alone on that portion . Do you like to work alone ? 
 Our first meeting is next Monday . Could you meet with us at that time ? 
 Please send me your background information before the meeting so I can look at it . 
 OK . I look forward to working with you . Enjoy your week ! 
 What kind of wine do you offer ? 
 Thanks . 
 What do you recommend ? 
 I'd like to try something typically Chinese . 
 OK . Let me try it . 
 Thank you . 
 Thank you , Peter . Come into the dining room . We are going to cut the cake soon . 
 That's Cathy . She is pretty , isn't she ? She likes dancing . Ask her to dance . 
 Don't be afraid . She isn't going to bite you . 
 How do you want your hair cut ? 
 Who is Peckham ? 
 You are a big fan of him ! He has strong legs . 
 Hey , wake up . It's done . How do you like it ? 
 But it's the same hairstyle . 
 Oh . I made a mistake . I thought the guy on the right was Peckham . 
 Sorry , but do not worry . I think I can fix it . Just cut a little more off the temple . 
 That's great ! We made 20 minutes earlier . 
 Mom , you are the best ! 
 Mom , come on . What are you thinking about ? 
 Don't tell me you want me to do that ? 
 But I don't like playing the piano . And the homework keeps me busy enough . 
 How depressed ! 
 I'm sorry to hear that . 
 Yes . 
 Do you know where Dawanglu is ? 
 You can take me there ? 
 That's good . 
 Let's go . 
 Good morning . 
 I'm running a high fever and feeling terribly bad . 
 Since last night . 
 Fine . But can you tell me how to get to the Medical Department , please ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 How much is it to rent an economy car ? 
 Could I have one for tomorrow morning ? 
 Sure here it is . 
 What reason do you have for missing school ? 
 How were you sick ? 
 Did it get any better ? 
 Would you like anything for your stomach ? 
 Get better . 
 My mother and my wife are always holding different ideas . 
 You mean I should please her by following her suggestion . 
 Are you going to watch the Indy Five Hundred on TV this weekend ? 
 You were when we were in high school . That , and baseball . 
 True , but I still have to watch my baseball . The season's in full swing now . 
 Hello ? Is the real Taylor in there ? 
 Yes . I'm sorry , but I've lost my passbook . 
 About RIB 12,000 . 
 I'm Bob Brown . But I can't recall my account number . 
 Thank goodness . It is still there . Thank you very much . 
 OK . 
 Certainly . Do you have your receipt ? 
 Now , why do you want to exchange it ? 
 I'm sorry . I'll get you a new player . 
 Okay , here's a new one for you . 
 No , thank you , Mrs . Carter . I'm fine for now . 
 Excuse me , Ms . Montgomery ? 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry , Ms . Montgomery . I ’ ll come back later . 
 Do you have much experience with kids ? 
 To tell you the truth , sometimes I regret having a baby so early . I have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby . 
 What about your mother ? Did she help you ? 
 I see . So if my little family goes to America , I would end up taking care of my child all the time . My husband would have to make the bread for us . I just don ’ t know how I would get some education and be able to get a job some day . 
 Sounds not so easy to me . When that happens , I will be too old to learn . 
 I ’ m itching for moving ! 
 It ’ s so wet and dark , I ’ m just fed up . 
 It ’ s probably just people trying to get an early start out of the city for the weekend . Nobody sticks around in the summer . 
 Actually , you might because there ’ s a big convention in town this weekend . 
 Good evening . Welcome to Cherry's . Do you have a reservation ? 
 How many of you , please ? 
 I'm afraid all the big tables are taken . 
 Hello . I'd like to make a call to Australia . 
 Oh , can I ? 
 Could you please tell me the international prefix and the country code for Australia ? 
 What time do the special rates apply ? 
 I wonder if I can charge this call to my hotel room . 
 This is Mr . Ma in room 215 . 
 Thanks very much for your help . 
 Bye . 
 It's a huge headache . I have no idea what I want to do . 
 It should be , but there are too many options . My grades are good enough that I have a lot of choices , but after that ... 
 Yup , you understand . And my parents are trying to pressure me into going to a Catholic college . They both attended one and think that it combines a good education with good discipline . And the tuition 3 is usually pretty low . 
 Thanks for the information . And good luck in your college search . 
 What happened ? 
 What ? Why ? Can ’ t you renew it ? 
 Well , I can help you pack . We should start looking for a new place for you ASAP . 
 Well , let me know if there ’ s anything I can do to help out . 
 Hehe .. sure 
 No , I'm not clear . 
 Don't make a fuss.The price is rising 
 Thanks . Now , I have to find a job . 
 I ’ d like to conduct some scientific research into genes . It would be wonderful to make a medical breakthrough . 
 Many companies and universities investing resources in genetics , because there are so many possibilities . Few people know where next discoveries will be made . 
 I ’ m having a problem . 
 A pipe burst in my wall . 
 The water is causing mildew . 
 Can I just call someone myself to fix it ? 
 You won ’ t do it until tomorrow . 
 So , I can call someone to fix it ? 
 What is your salary now ? 
 What's your expected salary ? 
 I can offer you 5 , 000 yuan per month . Raises are given after three months ' probation period according to your performance . Is this satisfactory ? 
 Any question about the work ? 
 The general manager of your section . 
 We'll offer that on holidays . 
 Yes , we have inspection abroad . 
 Okay . 
 What's the price of the bread ? 
 And how much is the coca cola ? 
 Here is ten Yuan . 
 Thank you . 
 Mr . Brown , I'd like to talk with you about something that is getting to be a problem . I'd like , if possible , to see it settled at this meeting . 
 It's about the quality of 300 cartons of dried mushrooms . They reached us two weeks ago , and were immediately examined after they arrived . To our astonishment , about 20 % of them were moldy and in many cartons there were even small brownish bugs crawling in and out of the half eaten mushrooms . We can't accept them in this state . They are unfit for human consumption . And the Medical Officer of Health has issued a Stop Notice on them . 
 Certainly . Here's a survey report by a well-known lab in London , whose testimony is absolutely reliable . 
 The mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags , sixty of these bags to a carton . It is stated on the surveyor ? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact . So it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing . 
 I think the Inspection Bureau at your end , when effecting inspection , only selected a few package at random these happened to be up to the standard . The part that was not dried properly , most probably , escaped their attention . As the amount in question is only 20 % of the whole shipment , I think it is only reasonable that you should compensate us for the loss . 
 We've already got in touch with the underwriter . But they have refused to accept any liability . They attributed the accident to the effects of dampness during the long sea voyage . 
 To my regret , we failed to cover contamination . This is an unfortunate oversight on our part and a lesson to us . 
 Well , live and learn . It seems we'll have to waive the claim . 
 This hotel has no full-size pool , but we do have swim stations in our gym . 
 You swim in a swim station just like you run on a treadmill . 
 The swim stations are available to all guests for no charge . 
 They're available anytime between 7 a . m . and 10 p . m . , seven days a week . 
 The swim stations are very popular , sir . I hope you don't find a line down there . 
 Speaking . 
 Yeah , exactly ! I bought them last year . En ... at present , they are still in good state . 
 Your company is developing so fast . Maybe later on I will plan to buy more . 
 Bye ! 
 Is this something that you could schedule for another time ? 
 Have you arranged for someone to take notes for you ? 
 You know that I only allow one absence per semester , don't you ? 
 Write down your name and the date on a piece of paper and give it to me . 
 Well , have a good day off from class . 
 I'm very sorry , sir . I could put you on a waiting list , but you would be wise to check out other means of travel . 
 I have not sir . But I do have a number for a very comfortable bus that goes to Chicago every hour from here . 
 Here is the number , and your name is on the waiting list . 
 Right now I show that there are 176 people on the list . And you are number 176 . 
 Two hours.That area is a little backward . 
 You're right . 
 I'll be happy to get back to you with an estimate in the next few days . 
 Well , I would need an idea of how large your order would be . About how many units would you need ? 
 Please give me a few minute to calculate ... Our asking price should be about $ 100 per unit with an order of 100 . Is that price acceptable to you ? 
 Would an order of only 100 units , it'll be difficult to work within that kind of budget . Maybe if you were ordering 500 units or more units , we might be able to work something out . 
 Of course ! I am very interested to know how my child is doing and also get some insight from you as to how he can improve . 
 I guess he gets that from me , I never did well in math when I was a kid . What can I do at home to compliment what he is learning in the classroom . 
 Thanks a lot ! I will definitely do that . Is there anything else ? 
 Oh yes , I ... 
 Hello . I'm a Financial Manager in a local company and we'd like to open a Foreign Currency Account with you . 
 We have recently started doing a lot of business with British companies , so we'd like to open a GAP account . How should we go about this ? 
 That's great . Let's begin as soon as possible . 
 First of all , as far as I know , your company has had impressive records in business . Second , I want to enter the foreign trade field . 
 I am in charge of marketing activities in South-East Asia , for example , organizing trade conferences and arranging exhibitions . 
 Nice to meet you . My name is Tyler Smith . Let's go to your office desk , follow me please . 
 Here is your working place . Nancy will come to show you how to set up the telephones . I'm going to call her now so that you can get started . Is that OK ? 
 If you have any further questions , just ask me . 
 You are welcome . Have a nice day . 
 Besides Chinese , I can speak English and French . 
 No , I can only carry on a simple conversation in French . 
 I can speak the language better than read and write . 
 I think so . I used to be an interpreter . 
 The amount of English I know enables me to do general desk work . I believe what I know is sufficient to work in an American firm . 
 No , thanks . I'm fine . 
 Yes . I would like to book a table for 2 at 7:30 tomorrow evening . 
 In that case , please put my name in your waiting list . We know you are quite a good restaurant . 
 hey , Tom , did you enjoy your lunch ? 
 what ' the matter ? 
 I see . You simply can't blame the server for this . 
 that's true . 
 it was good . I brough lunch from home today . 
 well , I personally don't like then because i don't believe they are healthy . 
 yes . I am wondering that you must believe fast food is your lifestyle , don't you ? 
 well , actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places . 
 yeah , it's hard to believe but true . 
 Yes . I'd like to try Chinese food . But I don't know anything about it . 
 Is there any difference between Cantonese food and Sichuan food ? 
 Really ? I like hot food . Can you make a few suggestions ? 
 OK . I ’ ll have them . Is there any soup ? 
 That ’ s fine . I'll have a try . 
 Martini , please . 
 Would you like to come to our party ? 
 what happened ? You look so pale . 
 What makes you say that ? 
 Oh , that's too bad . Work harder next term . 
 Don't loose heart . Everything will be fine . 
 What would you like today ? 
 Do you want cheese on it ? 
 Can I get you something to drink ? 
 What kind do you want ? 
 Would you like anything else ? 
 Is that all ? 
 Look , there's no way we can convince people they need fresh motor oil every morning . 
 It tastes funny . Why can't people just stick to plain and simple coffee ? 
 I'm not sure , is this our stop ? 
 Do you have any idea where we are ? 
 This can't be the right stop . 
 We got off too early , didn't we ? 
 I should've just stayed on the bus . 
 Great , we have to walk now . 
 Jenny , what's wrong with you ? Why do you keep weeping like that ? 
 Honey , cross my heart , I'v never looked at another woman since the first day I set my eyes on you ! Believe me , that's the truth . 
 Are you looking for a space on or off campus ? 
 You can park in the student parking structure . 
 You'll find the parking structure on the west side of the campus . 
 Last time I checked , it was pretty empty . 
 That was earlier this morning . 
 I have no idea . 
 Yes , would you like to tell me what's playing for tonight ? 
 Are there any good seats left ? 
 Well , what time does it begin ? 
 OK . I see . 
 Just two . 
 Here is the money .

 I would like to make a collect call to Taipei , Taiwan , please . 
 Tim Chen . 
 The area code is 2 , and the number is 2367-9960 . 
 You look so excited . What happened ? 
 So they have started the year end sale earlier this year . 
 I guess I'll wait a few more days . There maybe even bigger discount then . 
 Where are you going to spend your holidays this year , Harry ? 
 Will you travel by sea or by air ? 
 It ’ s cheaper , isn ’ t it ? 
 I ’ m sure you will enjoy yourselves . 
 Mrs.Smith , time has stood still with you ! 
 I'm not flattering you.You ' re full of energy every day . 
 The new webpage design is much more effective than before . I feel confident it will rope in a lot more business because of its user-friendly format . 
 The old page was okay , alright , but there wasn't a big influence in our sales volume , because the site wasn't developed with an eye towards the marketing aspect . Now it's different . We got our marketing department team in on the action , and the results are smashing ... 
 First , the visitors to the site are encouraged to give their contact information . They can sign up for a free monthly drawing . Once we've got their info , it goes into a database for future marketing mailers and advertising targeting . Also , there are clear links to descriptions of our products and services , so as to give confidence to new customers . We also added a specific area for on-line customer service ... So far we've gotten a ton of positive feedback ... 
 It's said that John's broken up . 
 I hear that John's leading a double wife . 
 The buildings are really magnificent . 
 The journey is worth while . Where are we going after this ? 
 The mailboxes are right down there , and the laundry room with coin-operated washers and dryers is over there . 
 All right , do you want to sign a nine-month or a one-year lease ? 
 Sure . Just let us know before your lease expires . 
 Right away , sir . 
 Yes , sir , it is . 
 Please come again . 
 Here . Do you have a registration card ? 
 Please register your information here and pay for it . And I ’ ll make a medical record for you . 
 Please pay ten yuan for the registration . 
 This is your registration card . Please don ’ t lose it and bring it whenever you come . 
 Go down this way until you come to the drugstore . Make a left turn and it's just there . 
 I taught English in a primary school in Beijing . 
 I am equipped with much experience in teaching for more than 30 years and I also edit teaching materials by myself . 
 thanks ; do you like it ? 
 yes , everyone on the sales floor has to wear one . They're supposed to make us look more professional . 
 I don't mind it , actually . I don't have to worry about what I'm going to wear every day . 
 it's much better than my old one . My new boss is great . 
 I like the fact that I get to work with people . It makes the day go by much faster . 
 yeah , I've met her . She's a genius saleswoman ! 
 how do you know her ? 
 why didn't you tell me about that before ? 
 well , now that I know that , maybe we should all go out for dinner sometime . 
 We still have an important attraction . 
 Melbourne Zoo . 
 The place is a must-see . This zoo was built in 1862 , and it's the oldest zoo in the world , and still among the best . There are more than 3,000 species of animals here , including the popular kangaroos , wallabies , koalas , and wombats . 
 Most animals are not locked up in tiny cages . Rather , they are set in almost natural surroundings or well-tended gardens . 
 Of course , I'm sure you will like it . 
 Fishing . It's great fun . 
 No wonder you always look so active . 
 Sure . Where would you like to stand ? 
 OK . 
 Are you ready ? Here we go . Say Cheese ! 
 Is it the battery ? 
 Do you have an extra battery ? 
 If you don't mind , you can use my camera and leave your address with me so I can send you the photos later . 
 You're welcome . Now smile ... 
 Yes . Why ? 
 So ? 
 You are attracted to her . That sounds great , but how do you know that it is a crush or it's real love ? 
 That's a big question . Well , if you are in love , maybe you ’ ll take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all . 
 And you think about her all the time ? 
 And maybe you suddenly have new interests . I mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid , ie.You used to sleep in every morning , but because she jogs every morning , then you begin to like jogging . 
 Oh , congratulations ! Sounds like you ’ Ve found your soul mate . 
 Yeah , that's right . If you find this person is more and more important to you and you can totally trust her , then you can stay in love . 
 While staying in love is even better . 
 The lecturer is dull , too . 
 I feel the same way . 
 What time is it ? 
 Well , we still have about 15 minutes . 
 12:05 . And it takes only 20 minutes to get to the station by bus . 
 Relax , those buses run every 10 minutes , so we have plenty of time . 
 It is a quarter to twelve . 
 Hello , Walter ? 
 I was wondering if you wanted to go for a walk with us . 
 Oh , man . I hope you get to feeling better . 
 OK , then . I'll be there in a minute . 
 I'm in the bathroom . 
 Gross . Diarrhea ? 
 OK , whatever , I don't want to hear about it . I'll call the doctor for you . 
 Enough . I don't want to hear any more about your bathroom time . 
 Are you sure you want to go ? 
 Is this the Friendship Hospital ? Please send an ambulance to 68 Hu Nan Road . 
 Of course . It's urgent . I think the partie nt is suffering from acute appendicitis . He may die if not treated in time . 
 ( after a while ... ) Where's the patient ? 
 Don't worry . We'll put him in the stretcher . You are coming with us ? Step in please . 
 Help the patient bathe and change his clothes , nurse . Then bring him into the operating room . 
 He had appendicitis , but is all right now that it was removed . He'll have to rest for a few weeks to recover . 
 No , outside food is not permitted . 
 Yes . But first you must observe the visiting hours , It's from 2 to 5 p . m . By the way , consult the nurse before you enter the ward . 
 By the way , you can bring some flowers . 
 Don't worry about him . 
 Our nurse can take good care of him . 
 Actually , I was watching your auction all along . I saw you drop out at $ 250 . 
 I watched Buddha buyer go up to $ 315 . I waited until the very last minute and then I jumped in at $ 325 ! I sniped him ! 
 Hey , what's the matter ? 
 Are you sure that this has nothing to do with sleep ? 
 Well , Peter , you have to do better than that next time , won ’ t you ? 
 Of course , you have . You must try harder this time . 
 No , you needn ’ t do that . You ’ d better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes . 
 You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ’ t have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study . 
 Who knows ! That might come to later . 
 Shall I come to your office this afternoon ? 
 Have you ever been to Xi ’ an ? 
 I ’ Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring . I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day . Of course I won ’ t miss the local food either . You know , the sites interests a food in scenery , food is a key factor when visiting a place . 
 Sure it is . Is it convenient to get there by plane ? 
 There was something wrong with the plane last Thursday . 
 Flight 198 . Fortunately , there were few passengers . 
 Well , all the passengers and crew members landed on their feet finally . 
 What do you mean , Mr . Smith ? You said to make it brief . 
 What do you think of when you're praying ? 
 Does that help you faith ? 
 Excuse me , how can I fill in this blank ? What does marital status mean ? 
 No , I'm still single . 
 I've got a bone to pick with you over your last shipment to Dalian . A part of the goods were damaged in transit . 
 Please handle future shipments with more care . 
 Excuse me , haven't we met somewhere before ? 
 Oh , I see.Glad to see you here . 
 I wonder whether I could possibly borrow your new bicycle now . 
 Thank you very much . 
 I wish it could be Germany . But it seems they are not in a very good conditions . 
 It seems they've been out of luck since the beginning of the event . Their shots hit the woodwork as many as six times . Oh . my goodness ! I'm afraid the team is under a spell . 
 I agree . Eeven though German attackers are not good at dribbling past opposing defenders , they breach the defensive line through quick movements to the right attacking positions and through accurate , well-timed passes . 
 Yes . They have a good reputation for their tenacity and discipline , especially in vital , decisive encounters . 
 I am . I just went to the travel agent ’ s and picked up these brochures . 
 I fancy going to Tibet for a few days . Have you ever been there ? 
 Would you recommend going there for a few days ? 
 You ’ re probably right . What do you think about Yangshao ? 
 I ’ d like to get away from the big city life . 
 I guess if I only have a few days , I should probably think about going somewhere that isn ’ t so far away . 
 Thanks , I ’ ll give them a call later . 
 I want to send some money to Hangzhou . Today , if possible . 
 I think account to individual would be best . But which is the quickest way ? 
 Right , that's fine . I'd like it to get there as quickly as possible . 
 Okay ! What do you suggest ? 
 Is that so ? Why not ? 
 What's on ? 
 That sounds interesting . Which is the nearest ? 
 What time does it start ? 
 But we won't have enough time for dinner . 
 Ah ... I fancy going to the later show . 
 That's Okay , I think . 
 Hi , Is that David ? 
 Hey , what's new ? 
 Sorry to hear that . What happened ? 
 Hey , that ’ s not the girl with pink hair , is it ? The girl I saw with Jack yesterday . 
 Hey , she is not worth it . Forget her . 
 Hey , she is not worth it . Anyway , there are plenty more fish in the sea . Listen , let's go for a drink in the town . How about that ? 
 But you have to promise me that you are not gonna wear that face . 
 The one where you look like your dog just died . You have to get over her and the sooner the better . 
 When it comes to select a fund , you will always read Past performance is not an indication of future results , can you believe that ? 
 If you refuse to take risk , you can ’ t have better returns . 
 Did you see Ally Mabel last night ? 
 Yes , wasn't it funny ? 
 Ha , yes , brilliant ! 
 Charles Dickens.Actually no one can parallel him in writing . 
 It is difficult for old people to do away with old ideas . 
 The government is making efforts to change situation . 
 How about another beer ? 
 Stay around for a while.The party is warming up . 
 This shirt you gave me is not my favorite brand . 
 Do you have any night tours ? 
 Is that a guided tour ? 
 That's fine . Let's get on the bus . 
 One bottle of perfume and a watch . 
 In Boston . 
 Oh ... I go to see my sister twice a year or so . 
 Nearly ten years . 
 I can't remember , but I've got the receipt somewhere.Would you like to see it ? 
 Yes.Does that mean I'll have to pay duty on it ? 
 Ok.Here you are.Is that all right now ? 
 Yes , I did . I had a fine time . 
 I'm sorry . Every customer coming here must do the warm-up exercise before getting down to swimming . That's out regulation . 
 OK , lovely boy . Try to be patient . Do you know the danger of swimming without warm-up ? 
 That's right . But the most dangerous thing is that their legs may spasm out of control when swimming . 
 Yes , besides that , we also provide our customers with goggles , swimming suit and something like that . 
 Of course , all the workers here are able to swim , and they will come to your aid quickly . 
 Sure , Emily . How can I help you ? 
 That ’ s fine , as long as you can get that report typed up before you leave . 
 Is it my turn ? 
 Not too long.Cut a little off behind and on both sides , too . 
 By the way miss , where is the toilet ? 
 What ? Oh , what we live ! Thank you very much for your help , miss . 
 What are the most popular sports in your country ? 
 Jogging and bowling . Do you know how to practise Bungfu ? 
 Is it easy to learn ? 
 Thank you . I can teach you how to bowl . 
 It's getting late , and I have to go now . 
 Please excuse me , won't you ? 
 What's the date today Mr.Brown ? I don't have a calendar . 
 25th Sep ? Oh , I have an appointment tonight . 
 It is at 8 o'clock . 
 I don't know what time it is . 
 I have to go now . I don't want to be late . 
 Excuse me , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 Yes , sir . 
 OK . Would you like something to drink in advance ? We have all kinds of sodas , juices , beers and wines . 
 How are your Chinese lessons going ? 
 Well I guess you have fewer characters but I think Chinese grammar is easier . 
 Yes , I guess basic speaking in the English is easier . 
 Everyone wants to be financial lose kill . You must invest your savings if you planed to retire rich . I ’ m thinking about buying stocks . It can be a good investment if I can manage well . What do you say ? 
 Wow , you sound very professional . 
 Today is your birthday . First of all , happy birthday to you ! 
 Listen , Karen , I need your help . I don't know anyone here yet . 
 My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L.A.Hank and I will be flying there tonight . 
 Doctors aren't sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her . 
 Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights . 
 I don't want to do that to you , Karen . 
 Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days . 
 I'd like to talk with her.This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight . 
 I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older . 
 Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free . 
 What ? 
 Huh ? Oh , my name is Laura . 
 Huh ? I can ’ t hear you , the music ’ s too loud . 
 Hold on , my ears are still ringing from the music ... what was it you asked me ? 
 Sometimes , usually once every few weeks . Do you ? 
 I usually come with a group of friends . We dance a little , have a few drinks , and just have a good time . 
 That ’ s good . It ’ s good to hit the books , but you need to get out once in a while . 
 Hey , the pool's open now ! 
 So it's time for the kids to get outdoors ... 
 Not this Taiwanese girl . We don't like to get suntans . 
 Maybe you'll get another chance at the statue . 
 And let them ruin my life ? Forget it ! 
 It's not worth it . Besides , I have to save up to pay for some bills . 
 Yeah . Well , I'll see you this weekend . 
 Don't mention it , let's go in . 
 She sure can . Are you jealous , Leslie ? 
 You can ! With a little practice . 
 I think he's hot too . 
 Exercised over and over . Exercise is a key . 
 Good for you , Leslie ! 
 All kinds , but mostly Pop , rock and classical . Why ? 
 What kind of music is it ? 
 When is it ? 
 Yeah , I'd like to go . Do you think we should have dinner first ? 
 Let's eat at the restaurant across the street from my apartment . 
 Yes , that's right . You have a good memory . 
 These red ones ? I'm not sure . 
 Oh , these ? Hmm ... Yellow isn't a good color for me . 
 Which one ? 
 It's $ 42 ! ! That's expensive ! 
 How may I help you ? 
 What problem are you having ? 
 Do you have the statement for your card ? 
 What are the charges you ’ re referring to ? 
 I ’ m afraid we ’ re going to have to investigate these charges . 
 I honestly don ’ t know , but we will freeze payment on these charges . 
 How have you been ? 
 And how ’ s everyone in your family ? 
 I ’ d love to but I ’ m afraid I can ’ t . I ’ Ve already got a lunch engagement . 
 Do you have air ticket and claim tag ? 
 Well , then , would you fill out this PIR from ? And also we need your signature here . 
 Hopefully by tomorrow evening.Which hotel are you going to stay ? 
 When is the expected date of your departure ? 
 Hurry up ! Mom , I can't wait any more . 
 OK , Mom . Can I swim now ? I want to learn butterfly stroke . 
 Mom , it's so terrible . Water went down into my throat and I almost got drowned . 
 Oh , Mom , I think I'm not the right person for swimming . 
 Right , I'll make up my mind . Please correct me if any of my movements go wrong . 
 Really ? I can't believe it . Everything is possible to a willing heart . 
 Yes , like a dolphin . Am I on the right track ? 
 Could I have your name , please ? 
 How do you spell your last name ? 
 Right . Thank you very much ! 
 Let me have a look . 
 I like the fabric , but I don ’ t like the style . 
 They are too bright . 
 Yeas , It is.Sewen Jes speaking.How can I help ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry to hear that , sir.What exactly is problem ? 
 Oh , dear ! I'll do well I can . 
 OK . What ? 
 You wouldn't do that . Would you ? 
 What about your accounts ? 
 Yes . 
 Hi . My name is Jessica . 
 Pleased to meet you too . And where are you from , Robin ? 
 I'm from New York . Oh , this is my stop . Bye , Robin . 
 Hi . I want to open an account with you , so I can pay my bills by direct debit . 
 Yes , that's what I thought . It's so much trouble coming down here or to the post office to pay all of my utility bills every month . So , what exactly do I need to do ? 
 Here you go . Is that it ? 
 Here . What's the least I can pay in to get this account open ? 
 OK , here you go . 
 I prefer potatoes to eggplants . 
 But as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better . 
 Can you lend me your car ? 
 Where are you going ? 
 Excuse me , sir . 
 Is this your car ? 
 I'm afraid you've parked on a double yellow line , sir . 
 I'm sorry , sir , but I'll have to give you a ticket . 
 My I have your name , please , sir ? 
 It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months . 
 I checked it out of the rental library . It only costs five cents a day . 
 I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter . 
 They ’ ll do the operation for you this Friday . 
 I think it ’ s important to do now . We can have a birthday party for you when you come out of the hospital . 
 But your health is more important . Believe me ! 
 Yes , I think I speak English quite fluently . I've often explained historical places in Xi'an to foreign tourists in English . They say my English is quite good . 
 Oh , more than ten years . I started learning English when I was still in a primary school from a foreign teacher . 
 Certainly . 
 We are going to the national park . 
 The Yellow Rock National Park . 
 Dad , hurry ! The train is coming . Aha , I am a superman . 
 Oh , we should . There are so many people . What if the train got full before we could get in ? 
 How many stops are there to the Aidan station ? 
 Oh , my God ! 
 Because I need to use the restroom . Is there a restroom on the train ? 
 Why not ? You told me that subway is a kind of train . If it had no restroom . what kind of train would that be ? 
 Oh , yeah , but not today . I am busy with praying the subway may get there as fast as possible . 
 Rich ! I ’ m glad I caught you . Mr . Carlton ’ s just come over here from the main office . 
 He needs to see the two of us to talk about next week ’ s annual sales meeting . 
 What experience do you have with office machinery ? 
 Where do you want to be in five years ? 
 Very good . Any questions ? 
 Do you know how to play go ? 
 But I heard it is very difficult to play . 
 Couldn't you extend the delivery period by two weeks ? That would make things much easier for us . 
 I can understand , but our company is fully committed at the moment , and hundreds of clients are placing orders for delivery these days . 
 Why did you stay home today ? 
 Good afternoon , it's nice to see you again . Have you decided to go ahead and try for the Fixed Asset Loan ? 
 That depends . Our repayment plans go from 1 year to 10 years . The Fixed Asset Loan is a long-term loan , you see . The loan can be paid in either monthly or quarterly instalments , to suit your needs . 
 You will need to pay part of the principle sum and part of the interest due . 
 Hi , I'm calling about the ad in the paper . 
 For the job . 
 Oh ! It was for a market sale manager . Is that still available ? 
 What company is this for ? I mean where's the opening ? 
 Well , I'm already in this field and know most of the companies . Before I come in to fill out an application , I need to know who it's with so I know whether or not I'm willing to work with them . 
 So you're a headhunter . 
 What's special for today ? 
 We'll have it for two people . 
 Where will it be ? 
 OK . But let me park my car in a better position . All right , miss . Where are the bags ? 
 That's a lot . What did you bring with you ? 
 Could you tell me where you put my book ? 
 No . A Walk in the Woods . 
 No . The bookshelf is full of fashion books . 
 No . Now would you like to help me look for the book ? 
 Oh , very good . 
 What is it ? It's eight in the morning . 
 No . I'm not a religious person . 
 Maybe next weekend . I went to bed too late last night . 
 Alright . 
 Yes , I ‘ m just reading them myself . It ’ s been a great competition . We got gold medals in three events . 
 We won the men ’ s high jump and the women ’ s 1500 meters . 
 The woman who won the 1500 meters also broke the world record by 2 seconds . 
 A Russian man broke the discus record by a centimeters . Out best athlete broke his personal best in the long jump , but it only got him third place . 
 Was he disqualified ? 
 Three twenty-five cent stamps , please . 
 And please sent this letter by registered mail . 
 There ’ s a check of two hundred dollars and photograph . 
 No . don ’ t bother . 
 How do you think should I handle this problem ? 
 But I'm already in a lot of trouble with my boss . 
 She's always bothering me . What should I do ? 
 But she always harps on me . 
 Yes , great ! 
 Yeah , Please do . Now let me show you the house . 
 You bet . This is the nicest room in the district . You know what , I just had all the walls repainted last month . 
 It's a well furnished eat-in kitchen . The stove and the ice-box are in good order , and the plumbing is OK , too . 
 Terrific ! When are you moving in ? 
 Welcome to IBA . Can I help you ? 
 OK , just a moment ... yes , it has arrived . The amount is 51,998 US dollars net , 12 US dollars has been deducted by the intermediary bank . 
 It's already credited to your account . 
 Yes , I do . How can I help you ? 
 Of course not . What exactly would you like to know ? 
 It's 1200 . Room service is available 24 hours a day . 
 Yes , the control unit is on the wall next to the bathroom . Is 24 ° C all right ? 
 You should call the Housekeeping Department on 2300 . They will replace any stock for you immediately . 
 That's no problem . Just dial 9 to get an outside line , and then dial the number as usual . 
 No problem , sir . If there's anything else you need , you can find me at the desk by the elevator , or you can call housekeeping if I'm not there . 
 Goodbye , sir . 
 Yes . I did . 
 I want to leave home , mum . 
 I am a grown-up , and I can stand on my own two feet . 
 What do you feel your greatest achievement has been at your current job ? 
 That certainly is quite an accomplishment . 
 What's your sales record been like there ? 
 If things are going so well , why do you want to leave the firm now ? 
 I ’ ll sing you a song . 
 Most of my songs are sad , sorry . 
 OK , I ’ ll sing San Francisco then . 
 Not really , do you ? 
 Take it easy . It is all over now . How was it going , anyway ? 
 That ’ s strange . But probably , it is the new interview technique they call it “ Getting to know you more personally ” . What about your answers ? 
 Excuse me ! Are you Bart Simpson from Western Electronics ? 
 I am Steven . I am here to meet you . 
 You must be tired after the long flight . Let me carry the bags for you . 
 Our car is in the parking lot . We've booked a room for you . I will take you to the hotel soon . Let's go . 
 What do you think about all the different diets people go on ? 
 But what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ? 
 So you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ? 
 How about drinking soda ? 
 That's good advice . Have you ever tried taking vitamins ? 
 How do you know so much about food and dieting ? 
 Hello , Steven . Annie said that you and Julia have had a quarrel , haven ’ t you ? 
 That's the reason why you fought ? 
 You two are always quarrelling over little things . 
 Are you still mad at her now ? 
 Will you apologize to her ? 
 Would you like some more coffee ? 
 The waitress is bringing the bill right now . 
 Yes , this waitress did a great job . 
 What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip ? 
 Yes , 20 % would be perfect . 
 Yes , that was one fantastic meal ! 
 Hi , excuse me . I am sorry to bug you , but do you know where the Royal Hotel is ? 
 Well , I seem to be a little bit lost here . I am worried that I ’ ll never find my way . What's worse . I forgot my glasses and as blind as a bat now . 
 I am trying to get to the Royal Hotel . Do you know where that is ? 
 Great . Are there any landmarks nearby ? 
 Oh , that's good . I should be able to find it pretty easily then . Is that far from here ? 
 Oh , that will take too long and I am kind of in a hurry . Can I take a bus there ? 
 All right . I guess I'll take a taxi then . How long will it take by taxi ? 
 Cool , thanks . 
 I'm the Mortgage Advisor at this branch . You wanted a chat about housing loans ? 
 I see . It's a problem most of us face . May I ask what the purchase price is ? 
 So , you've already made a large initial deposit ? That is good news . OK , let's have a look at your credit details and get this started . 
 That is good , it should speed things up nicely . 
 We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments . 
 We need to find a good realtor . 
 What do you mean ? 
 But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles . 
 I still think we should have a realtor.We ' re new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house.And also , the realtor will inspect the house.He can tell us if the house has 
 So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ? 
 And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ? 
 Why ? 
 Hmm . It all sounds very complicated . 
 I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like . 
 Would you like any toast , dear ? 
 Toast , dear ? 
 Would you like any tea , dear ? 
 Oh , you ’ re not listening to me . 
 Who's in charge of the construction project ? 
 I can ’ t I'm afraid . I've got another meeting scheduled for 2:30 p . m . 
 They're discussing whether they should replace Miss Smith , the Music teacher . 
 Because she's not responsible enough . 
 Why , do we need groceries ? 
 Do you know what to get ? 
 Why don't you go and check the refrigerator ? 
 Why don't you just get the basics ? 
 Eggs , milk , bread . Things like that . 
 Sure , no problem . 
 I'm getting sick of work man . I can't take the political bull in the company any more . 
 Yeah , but that's not why I am upset . I just found out another guy got a promotion . He doesn't know how to do anything . He sits there and kisses the managers butt all day long . 
 I'm just pissed that management can't see behind his smooth talking lies . 
 Yeah . I shouldn't stress about this anymore . It's not like I can do anything about it . 
 How about a cold bottle of beer . 
 Do you speak a foreign language ? 
 How well do you know English ? 
 I think the government needs a radical plan to improve things . The government just talks , but in the long run , nothing is done to improve the economy . 
 Well , income taxes were decreased last year in hope to give the economy a boost , but I think it's backfired . The immediate effect of the tax reduction was to cause inflation to rise . 
 I have a good solution ... We need some new blood ! We should get rid of this president and boat in some new leaders ! 
 How about this product selling from last month on ? 
 Am . Well , can I have a try of the sample free of charge ? 
 Thank you . We'll order once we try the sample . 
 OK . 
 Yes . When can I get them back ? 
 That's fine . By the way , please have that suit dry cleaned . 
 Excuse me . 
 Do you have any information about the city sights ? 
 Thank you . And what ’ s the best way to get downtown ? 
 You ’ Ve been very helpful . 
 Do you like playing table tennis ? 
 When did you start it ? 
 May I be of any assistance ? 
 You can have a broad choice here . Are you interested in a particular brand ? 
 Ma'am , these are complimentary with each purchase . How about that one below the toys ? This is the best seller . They are of the latest model that can be found in town . 
 Yes , we do . What a great taste you have ! But we only have one left in stock . 
 You know a good product will always sell ! Would you mind waiting for a while , we'll get it right away . 
 Here it is . It's very elegant , I think you will like it . 
 Its durability will be a big surprise to you . 
 500 yuan . And if you buy it today , there will be a 15 % discount for you . 
 Yes , we are on the same plane . 
 So you have to bring your baggage to the transfer check-in area . 
 Why not go and find a porter ? 
 Yes . 
 Yes . I'd like a crab cocktail . 
 Very well . 
 I want egg soup . 
 I'd like to have some meat . 
 No , thank you . 
 What is it ? 
 OK . Let me try it . 
 No , thank you 
 My chicken tastes all right , but it is pretty dry . How is your fish ? 
 It's almost as if this food has been sitting a little too long . It doesn't seem fresh . 
 How are your vegetables ? 
 Mine are the same way . It seems like they've been overcooked . 
 I agree . Maybe they can bring us some better food . 
 That won't be a problem , sir . 
 You're right , sir . Your whole day is still ahead of you . 
 We have a storage place here , but you have to leave a deposit . 
 Just present your VISA card , and there won't be any problems . 
 Okay , sir , but remember how close it is to your checkout time . 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry . 
 Yeah , I know . 
 Hi , Mary . You look pale today . What's the matter with you ? 
 You'd better take some medicine and have a good rest . I hope you'll be yourself pretty soon . 
 Lisa , is there a milk section ? 
 What's Condiments ? 
 Oh , I see . 
 Great ! Pasta for dinner . 
 Maybe we should get a shopping cart . 
 Shakespeare was born in 1867 . 
 Are you sure ? Can you make it more exact ? 
 Say , what's you favorite sport ? 
 Do you know how to skate , like a skater ? 
 Then you must know a lot about skating . 
 Sure . I thought people only showed off pictures of their new babies , not new pets ! 
 I see what you mean . He ’ s really cute . How old is he ? 
 Hello , Lucy . 
 Yes , I have decided to work with your company . 
 It ’ s my honor to be one member of your company . I ’ d like to begin to work any time as you like . 
 No problem . Thank you for calling me . 
 OK , Nick . Here's the question , What movie and its sequel both won an Oscar for Best Picture ? 
 Whew ! I'm impressed ! You really know your stuff ! 
 Paul , you were also a parent of young kids before . So , can you tell me what you did when your kids didn ’ t behave very well ? 
 I do it , too . You know , sometimes when we eat , my child would pull a dish towards him and grab it with his hands and eat . And if it were something he doesn ’ t like , he would spit it out and throw it into other dishes . He does it very often . I really get mad . I can ’ t help spank him sometimes . 
 My husband is an American . He criticizes me when I do that . He says that I can ’ t change a child ’ s behavior by using force . He is learning what I am doing now . 
 Yeah . I ’ m still learning how to control his behavior and my temper . My child is almost two years old , and I ’ Ve learnt the distraction technique when he cries for something . 
 I'd like to buy a keepsake for my girlfriend . Could you make a recommendation for me ? 
 It's not special . It can be seen everywhere . 
 It's interesting . Let me see . 
 Yes , how much is it ? 
 OK , I'll take it . 
 Thank you . It was a lot of hard work.But I'm glad I did it . 
 When will you give me a raise ? 
 I feel quite embarrassed for having to request a pay raise so quickly . 
 5 000 yuan per month . 
 I can't believe the weather is so gorgeous for your wedding . 
 And all of the flowers are in bloom . 
 This is Dunlin . Is this Mrs Smith speaking ? 
 I just want to call and say thank you for letting me interview yesterday . 
 And I also want to know what the status is of the position . 
 Do you have any questions we didn't cover in the interview ? 
 Thank you , I am looking forward to hearing from you . Bye-bye . 
 Excuse me for being late to work . 
 My car broke down . 
 Yes , I'll work on it . 
 Great ! Fill me in . 
 I don't understand the projected revenues . 
 To start with , may I know why you are interested in working for our company ? 
 Now you are with Quandong Company . What is your chief responsibility there ? 
 Do you have any questions about the job ? 
 Certainly . This is an international company , and ther're good chances for you to work overseas . 
 Excuse me . My name is Richard Davis of Magic Office Supplies . I'm here to see Mr.Chen . 
 What happened today on the freeway ? 
 What did happen ? 
 Really ? 
 Were there any injuries ? 
 Are they all right ? 
 I'm glad to know that everyone made it out okay . 
 Taxi ! Taxi ! Could you help me load these luggage in the trunk ? 
 Over there . 
 Okay , what package would you like to order ? 
 We offer packages with all the movie channels . 
 We also have packages with all the sports channels . 
 We have that available . 
 Would you like anything else with your package ? 
 Yes , you can add or get rid of channels later on if you would like . 
 I have a problem . 
 Someone else is making charges on my debit card . 
 I have it right here . 
 The last four charges . 
 How long will that take ? 
 I really appreciate your help . 
 When I was in LA , I met the WebTracker sales rep . 
 The sales rep had a green note pad just like yours . He said everybody at WebTracker used them . 
 We both may be snakes , Dave , but I'm just better at it . Among the snakes , I'm the sneakiest . 
 I have just left school , but I am well acquainted with office work . 
 Since leaving school , I have attended typewriting and shorthand classes , and have now attained a speed of fifty and ninety works respectively . 
 I know how to gather and summarize information from the Intent , which is an essential skill for market analysis . 
 I am a good accountant and have a thorough knowledge of the English language . 
 I'm Mr.Stephen ' s secretary . He has an appointment with Mr.Green today . 
 I'm afraid we have to reschedule it . 
 I'm very sorry . But Mr.stephen must leave for Hong Kong right away . 
 That'll be fine . 
 Let me see . Laptop , flash disk , a ballpoint pen , a pencil , a notebook , a pair of glasses , cell phone , charger , moisture lotion , ... Oh , that is too much . You are not going to a business trip . 
 Actually , the company will provide you with all of these supplies . So , you can leave this very thick notebook at home . 
 Suit yourself . Don ’ t forget to set the alarm clock . 
 He isn't a punctual person . We may have to wait for a little while . 
 Make it three cups . Here comes Harry . 
 Ah yes , I'd like to book two rooms for myself and my father . Could you tell me the cost of a single room per night ? 
 Fine . 
 From the 25th to the 28tri of September . 
 That's right . 
 Yes , we have rooms available then . You require two single rooms ? 
 Can l have your name please ? 
 And your father's name , Ms White ? 
 Could you spell the surname please ? 
 Double P for Papa ? 
 Hello , Mr . Smith , Wang Peng speaks . 
 I'm calling to thank you for the wonderful dinner I had yesterday . 
 I'll come back to China tonight . I hope to see you again sometime . 
 I appreciate all help of you during my stay here . 
 Please let me know when you go to China and let me be of some assistance to you . 
 Thanks , good-bye ! 
 What should I do to prepare for a job interview ? 
 Sort of , but I could know more , I guess . 
 I think that they are a very formal company . 
 I need a lot of help in this area . 
 Yes , what else should we think of ? 
 What's up ? 
 I'm having a party this Friday . 
 I wanted to see if you wanted to come . 
 Doing what ? 
 I really wanted you to come , but I understand . 
 I'll hold you to that . 
 Excuse me , I'd like to make a suit of this material . 
 Yes . Should I take off my coat ? 
 Please make a single-breasted . 
 How much does it cost ? 
 All right . When can I get it ? 
 Thank you . 
 I am not sure . What are you doing ? 
 That sounds like a great idea ! 
 Sure , I would love to go with you . When would you be leaving ? 
 That would give us plenty of time to explore . Did you know that there is a music festival on the beach in Santa Barbara ? 
 Well then , I'll see you on Saturday . Thanks for asking me to go with you . 
 Where is your seat ? 
 OK , you mean the vacant one on the left ? 
 No need . I have only this small handbag with me . 
 You honestly believe the world ’ s improving every year ? 
 I don ’ t think you ’ re right there . 
 I don ’ t believe that . 
 I agree with you in the sense . But we ’ re all more miserable than ever , aren ’ t we ? 
 That ’ s your opinion not mine . 
 It ' s an Indian restaurant ! I know you have never had Indian food , so I thought you might want to try . 
 Well , Indian cuisine actually doesn ' t serve beef . You see , cows are a sacred animal , a very important element in the Hindu religion , so beef is not eaten . 
 There are many amazing dishes to choose from . We can have some chicken tikka masala which is an amazing curry . It ' s a bit spicy , but I think you can handle it . 
 Yeah . Also , we can have some Naan bread which is baked in a tandoori oven . Since you don ' t use any utensils to eat , you can use this bread to scoop up the curry or rice . 
 They have a good variety of vegetable-based dishes like talak panter , vegetable samosas or daal . 
 Mom , can I have more allowance ? 
 I want to buy more books . 
 Of course not ! I'm telling the truth . 
 This way , please . We've got a nice private for you . 
 Here we are . I hope you will like it . 
 And here is the menu . I'll come back soon . 
 Good morning . sir . How may I serve you today ? 
 Sure . Large or medium ? 
 Anything else to go ? 
 You've got it . 
 Sure . It's seven eighty-nine . 
 Thank you , sir . Have a nice day . 
 Most of them are not so practical . It will be very bad for your health if you skip lunches or supers as the recommended . I think making an exercise plan can be more effective . 
 You don ’ t need to lose weight , you are not fat . 
 Hi , how are you ? 
 It's my pleasure . 
 Is she acting up in class ? 
 Is she really ? 
 So she isn't causing you any problems ? 
 I'm glad to know that you like her . 
 What a hot day ! 
 Where are you going this summer vacation ? 
 Do you want to go to the beach there ? 
 The same to you . 
 I would like to have a new suit made . something in a dark blue wool . 
 I think I would like the pants pleated . I am not sure about the jacket though as I'm a little overweight . 
 Yes , that is why I usually choose dark colours for my business suits . 
 Certainly . 
 Well , we've been waiting for our luggage for about one hour . 
 It's blue , Samsonite bag . 
 This is room eleven-seven and my name is Terry Chen . 
 My friend's room ? Oh , I see . Thanks a lot . 
 You look hot and tired . Jack , have you been exercising ? 
 Who won ? 
 What was the score ? 
 Dad , you've been driving for three hours . Why don't we have a switch ? 
 Trust me . I've been driving for two years . 
 Have you taken your temperature ? 
 Well , open your mouth and let me have a look . It is nothing serious . You haven't got a fever . But you should take the medicine and need have more rest recently . When you feel well , you could take more exercises , or play sports like basketball , running , and swimming . And eating healthy food , having more fruits and vegetable and drinking milk are good for your heath . 
 You stepped on my foot ! 
 Acknowledgments play a necessary part in the interview . 
 We often ignore the acknowledgments in our daily life , and consider them as disposable . 
 We should particularly pay attention to acknowledgments in the interview . 
 Don't forget to say " Thank you " when you take a seat . 
 You can win a good impression of the interviewer in this way . 
 Finally , at the end of the interview , make acknowledgments to the interviewer again . 
 This house is not looking all that great from here 
 I don ’ t think that it is looking any better inside here . 
 It is just too dark in here with so few windows . 
 The kitchen may be large , but it doesn ’ t have any storage space . 
 How many dogs live in this house ? 
 Are you going home now ? 
 What are you going to do ? Are you going to work late ? 
 An apartment ? Why ? 
 Where are you living now ? 
 How are you going to find an apartment ? 
 Apartments in the city are expensive . 
 I don't like the merry-go-round . 
 Ok , I guess it's worthy of two yuan . 
 Linda , John and I are going to get married next week . 
 Thank you , Linda . We would love you to come to our wedding . 
 It's May 1st . 
 It's Saturday . Could you make the time ? 
 At nine sharp . 
 Thanks . 
 I do wish I could afford one . 
 Of course I know that . But don't you notice that the house price is skyrocketing ? 
 Someone has stolen my gold necklace . 
 Of course not . 
 Yes , I've looked everywhere in my room and I can ’ t find it . 
 Last night on the dresser . I took it off before I went to the shower , and forgot to put it back on after the shower . And this morning I left the hotel in a hurry without wearing it . 
 Yes , I am positive . 
 Yes , I think I did . It has to be one of your maids who took it . I want my necklace back . 
 That just isn't good enough . Cet me your general manager . I want to speak to him now . 
 Excuse me , can you tell me the way to the British Museum ? 
 Which bus should I take ? 
 What time does the museum open ? 
 Thanks a billion . 
 I really love this kind of atmosphere . 
 There are people everywhere . What's that girl doing ? 
 And what about that man there ? 
 I see you have a coffee bar for a water cooler . The staff here must be comfortable . I think it really helps morale when people feel supported by their employees . 
 Hi Amanda , how are you ? I've missed working with you and the whole gang since my transfer last week . 
 It's great . I really get to focus on what I like to do and everyone has been very nice and welcoming . However , I'm having a small problem with my new colleagues . 
 Well , three people are celebrating their birthdays this month and the policy here is for everyone to contribute ten dollars to a card and cake for each person . 
 I know . It is a lot of money and I haven't gotten to know any of the people celebrating their birthdays well enough yet . At our old department , it was only three dollars for each birthday and there were only ten of us . 
 What is that ? 
 I definitely don't want to be that ! But , I still think it's unreasonable for them to ask me for such a big sum of money when we don't know each other very well . What should I do ? 
 Yeah , everyday . And there ’ s only one choice.All the other buses are going the other direction . 
 Oh , yeah , it ’ s terrible . I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China . It ’ s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt . 
 What happened ? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus ? 
 Hmm . Good exercise , uh ? 
 And it ’ s so much fun . One day , the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl ’ s behind was pressed against my front . I was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her . 
 What do you think ? I ’ m a good boy . 
 Cut what out I ’ m not doing anything . 
 Fine ! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup ! 
 You ’ Ve got to be kidding me ! You ’ re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ? 
 Fine . Let's call a truce . I'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down . 
 He said he will get married by the end of this month . 
 Who knows . After all , he is handsome and rich . 
 Very interesting . Thank you for bringing it to us . 
 We haven't decided yet , we will let you know if we do . 
 Not good for business ? I don't see eye to eye with you.The new policy offers new opportunities . 
 Ok , so where do you think we can save more money ? 
 Yeah . That ’ s a good idea and you like to cook . What about the books ? 
 Come on . If we save more money , we can retire earlier and you ’ ll actually have time to read all those books you buy . 
 Ok . Let's compromise . If you agree to only spend 75 on books , I'll agree to only spend 40 for my next shirt . 
 Good morning , Janice . Our office will hold a welcoming party in the evening , so I will allocate you some assignment . 
 Don't worry . I will find someone to assist you . 
 Firstly , you should go to the supermarket , which is nearest to our company , to buy some fruit , drinks , desserts and cakes . Here is the list of things you need to buy . 
 The meeting room on the Fourth Floor needs to be swept . Jerry and Tom will help you at that time . Any questions ? 
 Don't worry about that . I have already calculated the money about things you will buy . Remember to give me the receipt when you come back . 
 It gives me great pleasure to introduce Mr ... eh Mr ... 
 Yeah ! May I introduce Mis ... eh ... Miss ... 
 Oh yeah ! Would you please welcome ... Miss Jan Brown . 
 Certainly , Mr . Emory . Is there a problem , sir ? 
 Fine , Mr . Emory . Let me just grab a pad and pen . 
 No . I ’ Ve not had the pleasure of meeting her yet . 
 How do you do ? 
 What would you like to drink ? 
 I like the Honda Accord you showed me before . I think it's more practical for my needs . 
 What does it come with standard ? 
 Cruise control ? I don't like that . 
 I think it's dangerous . What if I can't turn it off ? 
 I wish it didn't have cruise control . My wife doesn't like it either . 
 I suppose . And what about the sunroof ? Is that standard ? 
 I see . Another important question is the time I can get this car . I need a new car rather soon . 
 That's good enough , I think . What colors does the new Accord come in ? 
 My brother has last year's Accord.And his car is a kind of soft purple color mixed with silver . I really like that color . I wonder if I can get that color on my Accord . 
 Yes , I think that's it . Can I get that on the Accord ? 
 Well , I think I want to order the new Accord then.It looks like an excellent car . 
 Yes , I know . I think Honda is the most reliable car on the road . I would never change to anything else.The Honda I have now almost never has service problems . It runs smooth as silk . 
 Hey Jack . How's it going ? 
 What ! With who ? 
 Did you guys go on a date already ? 
 Does she have a boyfriend ? 
 Dude , you're a stalker man . Just ask her on a date . 
 So why do you think you're in love ? 
 That's called blind love . Well , I gotta run . Tell me how it goes next week . 
 I ’ m glad to have had the opportunity to meet you here . 
 I ’ m doing great , thank you . 
 I need to find a new furniture set for my living room . 
 I have no idea . 
 Where'd you get it from ? 
 How much did it cost you ? 
 Is the furniture sturdy ? 
 I don't mind paying a lot as long as the quality is good . 
 In my opinions , someone else has caused the fire of this house . 
 I ’ m not sure now . In any case , let ’ s first make some careful investigations . 
 Yeah . 
 Yes , most of the time . But , sometimes things can get difficult . 
 You know , sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . They may insist they are sick when they are not . 
 Not much , usually I'll just keep silent . 
 Have you made an appointment with this company ? 
 Yes , it's very important to make an appointment before the interview . 
 If you go to the company without appointment , the interviewers may happen to be busy with other things , and have no time to give you an interview . 
 If the interviewers are not in the company , you will go there for nothing . 
 So you should make an appointment in advance with the company for the interview . 
 You could directly call the company and arrange the time and place for the interview . 
 If you succeed in doing that , you must attend the interview on time . 
 This is room 2012 . Where is my laundry ? You promised to send to me this morning . 
 Yes , I ordered the express service . 
 That's fine . 
 I agree . I ’ ll look in the paper . 
 Here ’ s an interesting ad , For rent . Two-bedroom , unfurnished house , fenced yard , one-car garage . Pets OK . 
 The ad says $ 325 plus deposit . 
 It ’ s available now , and it ’ s got a very good location . You won ’ t be far from work . 
 I wonder if we can make payment for this order by documentary collection . 
 But our order this time is very large . To open an L / C for such a large amount at a bank is costly . Can you be a bit more flexible and bend the rule a little ? 
 To be frank , a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import . When I open a letter of credit with a bank , I have to pay a deposit . That will tie up my money and add to my cost . 
 Are you free this afternoon ? 
 How long have you been there ? 
 Is there any change ? 
 Really ? Is it tiring ? 
 I want to go there , too . Can I ? 
 The tranquility of the night , the chirping of some insects , everything is so natural ! 
 And I was overwhelmed by this scene , too . 
 Thank you . 
 Only as a clerk in a store . 
 I'm a quick leamer , Mr.Jenkins . 
 Yes , and I'm a very good driver . 
 Do I have to travel a lot ? 
 But how will I get to know the products ? 
 How much is the salary ? 
 How much commission do your consultants get ? 
 Well , I'm very interested in the job . 
 Thank you . 
 The answer is zero ! What a let-down ! 
 No hard feelings . After all , he is a child . 
 Harry , come here immediately ! 
 Don't take that tone with me ! I saw you hit your brother . 
 I don't care . You know better than to hit him . Go sit on your bed for 10 minutes . 
 I needed to ask you a question . 
 How many hours of the behind-the-wheel course do I need to take ? 
 I want to get my license . 
 How many days do I need to finish the course ? 
 Is that all ? 
 That sounds easy enough . 
 Oh , hi , Mary , come on in . Any problem ? 
 Great . I forgot to ask you , though . How long did you want the place ? 
 Oh , well , that might be a problem . I usually only sign one year leases . 
 Well , if it ’ s not a problem . Then here you go . 
 Of course . 
 Yeah , and don ’ t worry about the security deposit . If everything ’ s all right when you move out , you ’ ll get it back . 
 Yes . Thanks . You can move your stuff in tomorrow . 
 How many years have you done business with China ? 
 Do you have any difficulties in doing business in China ? You know the Chinese economic legislation is still incomplete ? 
 Well , it's known that the Sino-American relation is in a dilemma . Does it influence your business in China ? 
 Thank you . 
 Where are you employed ? 
 What do you think of your present job ? 
 How do you get to office ? 
 What does your work consist of exactly ? 
 Would you mind working overtime at night ? 
 How much money are you making a month ? 
 Why do you plan to change your job ? 
 you don't look too well . Maybe you should take the day off from work . 
 do you feel ok ? 
 why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some seat or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now . 
 you're really hot . Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down . 
 Zach , what's that on your arm ? 
 it looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ? 
 I completely forgot about your cat allergy . I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . Oh no . we'd better go to the doctor to get some medicine . Let's go . 
 we would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse . 
 I'll be glad when winter comes . 
 Because I love the snow . 
 Last year we made a big snowman . 
 It was seven feet tall . 
 It took us all day . 
 Of course . We gave him a big carrot for a nose . 
 Do you have the same in different sizes ? The trousers are too long for me . 
 Will the trousers shrink when washed ? 
 That's good . I will take it . 
 Sure . What's your room number , sir ? 
 A minute , please . It's 6215 yuan all together , tax included . 
 Sure . Can I have your passport , please ? 
 From reviewing your resume I can see that you have ample experience for this position.What I want to know is why you think you ’ re right for the job . 
 So you ’ Ve acquainted yourself with the company . It ’ s refreshing to interview someone who ’ s sure of what they want . 
 Commitment to the company and the team is very important to us here . 
 Where is my contract ? 
 Look at the show on TV . I am watching a food show at a very famous seafood restaurant . I really want to eat at that restaurant . I am a seafood lover . 
 Sound great . Let's go ! 
 True . I would like to have some salmon sashimi and a roast salmon head . 
 You are not too bad as well . I also want to have a steamed lobster . It is really taste like heaven . 
 Wait . Let me tell the lady what we would like to order in front of the seafood fridge first . 
 Do you think we should try some deep fried oysters ? 
 What kind do you want ? 
 Caesar salads are good . 
 What kind do you plan on making ? 
 Chicken salads are really good . 
 That sounds like a great salad . 
 That sounds like a plan to me . 
 Yeah . That's just what is troubling John . 
 This situation isn't easy to handle . 
 You look a bit pale , don't you ? 
 You should get plenty of sleep . 
 If I were you , I wouldn't drink too much . 
 You better do some exercise every morning . 
 Why do you worry about your future ? You're very young , and you'll make great contribution to the world . I hope you take my advice . 
 Good morning . I want to buy a lipstick for my wife because it is her birthday today . 
 Light pink . 
 I'd like her to have a change . 
 It is nice . Is it water proof ? 
 Okay , I'll take it . Could you help me gift wrap it ? 
 I don ’ t want you to be worried , but our son has some bad habits now . He says painful words everyday . 
 He says kick mommy , beat mommy , don ’ t want mommy very quickly if I do something that he doesn ’ t like . You know , if I wash his face or change his clothes , things like that . 
 Yes , but sometimes he is just not reasonable . 
 It ’ s easy to say , but I will try . 
 I know my parents sometimes threaten to punish him . But this doesn ’ t work , instead he picks up another bad habit . 
 Well , the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulty getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts . 
 And now we have a two-year-old boy . We ’ re very happy that he ’ s healthy and smart . 
 Right now he speaks mostly Chinese , and he can say a few English words . But he will learn . 
 Yes , people surely can . He ’ s whiter than the Chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though . 
 He ’ s doing fine . A new broom sweeps clean . 
 I think we ’ ll benefit a lot . 
 I'm afraid I can't agree with you . 
 Simply because it's not practical at all . 
 Why ? What's eating her ? 
 I don't have the slightest idea . 
 What ? Not my Dad , I hope ! ? 
 No kidding ! Jack is such a log ! He's never dated a girl . 
 And the problem with Jack is that he seems to have no interest in girls . He's putting his heart into his stamp collection . 
 You know what , last night I almost got hit by a vase falling from the third floor . 
 Luckily that was nothing serious . 
 I saw your ad in The New York Times . I am seriously considering one of the apartments listed in it . 
 The two-bedroom apartment on 38th east street . 
 That's why I think it may suit my needs . 
 The ad says the rent would be 840 dollars per month . Is it true ? 
 Will it possible for me to rent the apartment on a month-by-month basis ? 
 Oh , that's no problem . 
 Of course not . I'm just observing casual day . On Fridays , the company doesn't require us to wear formal business attire . 
 We don't think so . Casual days are becoming more common , and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes . 
 Not really . Besides , there is a separate dress code for casual day . People can't just wear whatever they want . 
 Believe it or not , it has the opposite effect . Employees are actually more productive on casual days . 
 What will you discuss at the meeting ? 
 And anything else ? 
 That's all ? 
 OK . 
 I have a problem with this check . 
 I wrote out a check for $ 100 and it bounced . 
 I believe so . 
 All right . Thanks . 
 That ’ s impossible . 
 Okay . Thanks . Have a nice day . 
 No , I'm stuffed . The check , please . 
 Yes , we did . Do I pay you or the cashier ? 
 Here you are . 
 Such bad luck , 200 yuan was stolen by a thief on the bus today . 
 Well , you can just comfort yourself like that . 
 You're really sporty ! 
 Do you have clubs ? 
 There are clubs for beginners . It's cheaper to buy those rather than rent them a few times . 
 Like the seven-piece set . It's only $ 120 . 
 Okay . 
 Oh yes , I ’ Ve been to Britain many times . I go there on business . 
 Usually , I go to London twice a year but sometimes I go three or four times a year . 
 I ’ m afraid I never go for a holiday . It ’ s always business . 
 Yes , may I ask something about the salary and benefits in your company ? 
 What is the salary while on probation ? 
 That sounds fine . 
 Are there paid holidays ? 
 Hello , I'm Jack . Are you Christina ? 
 Are you from Italy , Christina ? 
 Really , I went to Munich last week . 
 Oh , yes . It is a fantastic city . And I like German food as well . 
 I am from California in the United States . But I am now studying in England . 
 I am studying languages . This year I am doing German and Italian . 
 How are you getting along with your paper ? 
 You should hand it in before next Sunday . 
 I believe you can do a good job . 
 Thank you . I ’ m pleased to meet you , Mr . Brown . My name is Kathy Pewless , the representative of Green Textile Import and Export Corporation . 
 Thank you for saying so . Have you seen the exhibition halls ? On display are most of our products , such as silk , woolen knitwear , cotton piece goods , and garments . 
 Our silk is known for its good quality . It is one of our trade - trional exports . Silk blouses are brightly colored and beau - fully designed . They ’ Ve met with great favor overseas and are always in great demand . 
 One second , please . All right , here are your painkillers . 
 You are welcome ! 
 What ’ s wrong ? I thought everything was set . 
 Maybe we could work out an overtime schedule . It ’ s definitely worth it to finish by the twentieth . 
 Thanks . It ’ s nothing special actually . 
 Oh , it was nothing . Anyone could have done it . I still have a lot to learn yet . 
 Thank you . I won ’ t let this promotion change me . 
 Sporting goods ? Is that bike Tim wanted on sale ? 
 Well , maybe we could get it now and hide it until his birthday . 
 Don ’ t buy him underwear again . He hates that . 
 See anything else we need there ? 
 Shoes ? You already have a closet full of shoes . 
 Oh , all right . I need some new shirts , too . Let ’ s go after breakfast . 
 This is the interview class . Welcome to our class . 
 We are all learning things that will help us in our interview . What do you think are some important considerations going into your interview ? 
 Yes . Second , as you can imagine , attitude and friendliness go a long way . 
 Believe it or not , the interviewers are as interested in your questions as they are in your answers . 
 Always be honest with your answers . The interviewers really do want to know if you will be a good fit for them . 
 He's such a buppie-a black yuppie . Black people come in all shapes and sizes . Just check out the party . 
 You'll find some of those here , too . But not if you don't shake it up ! There's an African saying , “ If you can talk , you can sing ! If you can walk , you can dance ! ” 
 Are you ready to order , sir ? 
 Of course . Here you are . 
 Our seafood is fresh . I recommend shrimp with garlic . 
 I ’ d like to check in please . 
 Mr Harold Smith . 
 Yes , I am . That ’ s right . 
 Yes please . At 6.30 am . 
 Thank you . 
 Oh , what does it say ? Does it say water could still exist under the surface of Mars ? 
 Then could the soil on Mars somehow be fertile enough to Groh simple plants ? 
 Actually , we are doing a project in school that involves landing a ship and staying on Mars for an extended period of time . Does NASA have any type of portable habitats that could be used to stay on the planet ? 
 One of the most exciting things about Mars is that there could have bean life on it . What are your personal opinions on the life on Mars theory ? 
 But maybe there is a chance of gradually improving the surface and atmosphere of Mars so it may be inhabitable by humans . 
 I'd still like to hope that some day we could set up a human colony there . 
 Can you make the tea , Sam ? 
 Yes , there is . 
 It ’ s over there , behind the teapot . Can't you see it ? 
 There it is ! It ’ s in front of you . 
 There are some in the cupboard . Can you find them ? 
 Hurry up , Sam . The kettle ’ s boiling . 
 I ’ d love to , but you know I ’ Ve got another appointment . I ’ m really sorry . 
 I ’ m afraid not , George . You gotta know something , I ’ m not available any more . but I know Becky has a crush on ya . 
 Look at these gorgeous paintings ! 
 Why not take a picture ? 
 What ? You want to leave early ? 
 Do you really need to ? 
 Is it important ? 
 You really have to ? 
 I guess so . 
 I have a question . 
 I need to take the driver's course . How many hours do I need ? 
 I need to get my license . 
 How many hours a day can I do ? 
 That's all I need to do to finish ? 
 Thanks . I'll get back to you . 
 As your realtor , I am here to take care of this process . How much were you planning on offering ? 
 We want to leave ourselves some bargaining room . Let ’ s offer three hundred and twenty thousand dollars . 
 The market is fairly down right now , so the offer is a realistic one . 
 The owners usually respond to an offer within a few days . 
 You are already pre-qualified for your loan , so you are in good shape . 
 I ’ m terribly sorry , sir , but I ’ m afraid it is true . That flight has been canceled . Would you like to try to book tomorrow ’ s flight ? 
 It ’ s possible . If you would like to book with another airline the line is right over there . 
 That ’ s the one . It seems that everyone is anxious to get to New York tonight . 
 Certainly . You will also be receiving a 50 % discount as our way of apologizing for the inconvenience . 
 Are there any people who speak English ? 
 Tom , we are in the restaurant now ! 
 I'd like to see the menu , please . 
 Thanks . I am starving . Tom , what are you getting ? 
 Let me see ... What's this , shrimp rolls ? 
 Twenty five yuan is a little expensive . 
 Sounds nice . We will take this , two bowls of shrimp rolls . 
 We will have this one first and order something else later . 
 May , look at this mess ! You threw waste everywhere . 
 You mean it shuts off to save energy ? 
 It's not breathing ! 
 Jen , it's not alive ... but it does look user-friendly . 
 hi , Bob , I am so glad that you came . 
 yeah . It's hard to believe that it's been ten years since graduation . It feels just yesterday we collected our diplomas . 
 oh , where to start ? There have been ups and downs . I'm still trying to find my place in this world . It's only recently that I've been able to start settling down . How about you ? You still with Jenn 
 oh , that sounds wonderful . I have always known you two would make it . I hope I can keep in better contact with you guys . I don't want us to drift apart again . 
 sounds great ! I'll be there . 
 When I have some time , I like to exercise . 
 I joined Samsung Health Club a couple of months ago . 
 I usually spend 30 minutes on the bicycle for the Carpio , and then I lift weight for about 45 minutes . 
 I want to go four times a week , but I'm too lazy . Last week , I only went to workout once . 
 Oh , I no longer work there . I'm working with a multi-national corporation . 
 I want to try different things before I find the one I really like . 
 I could handle everything pretty well in the old position , so I decided to move around and learn something new . 
 I'm pretty satisfied with it . I can broaden my experience , learn lots of new things , and have more development opportunities . 
 Oh , it runs every 20 mins . You must have missed it , when you came here . It should be here any minute now . 
 Yes , I do . You can go to the Transport Department to get yourself a bus schedule and a bus route map . 
 Welcome , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 You've made a good choice . This china tea set is unusual . It was made in Jingdezhen . 
 Yes , sir . 
 No , if you take some care when you use them . 
 Two thousand . 
 Steven , have a rest . Could you have a talk with me ? 
 Janice has just got sick and I need a hand now . Could you come here earlier tomorrow morning ? 
 Let me think . About half past seven if it is okay for you . 
 Sorry , honey , something has cropped up again . I have to deal with it . Perhaps I will go to back home till very late . 
 Oh , come on . I will be back as early as possible . 
 I heard that James was fired because he got a keep back of 20 thousands dollars from a vender . 
 But mine could be a lie for his job . 
 A little bird whispered to me . Keep that to yourself . 
 I heard it might rain . 
 Mmm ... Well we could go to that new art gallery instead . 
 Maybe we ’ ll meet some of the artists too . 
 May I help you ? 
 Yes . What colors do you like ? 
 How about this one ? 
 Of course . This product moisturizes at the same time . 
 Hello 
 Hi B . How are you ? 
 I called you yesterday . Did you get my message ? 
 No problem . I wanted to remind you that my friend is getting married next week . You're still coming to the wedding with me , right ? 
 Yes . Did you forget ? 
 That's good . I want to invite Megan also . Next time you see her , can you tell her for me . 
 Yes , I think they might have gone to the same college or something like that . I'm not exactly sure how they know each other . 
 Yes . I'll pick you up first , and then we'll go get Megan . 
 I enjoyed myself , too . 
 Yes , if it's not too much of a trouble . 
 That's great . Let's go ! 
 I am dead tired and I can't walk any further . 
 Why don't we stop and have a rest here ? 
 We will go to climb up the hill tomorrow . Let's go to supermarket to buy some food . 
 What should we buy ? 
 It is heavy and not convenient to take them to the top . 
 Good idea . We can buy some candy and nuts for children . 
 That's enough for the kids . Get some drinks . 
 Right . We should buy some yoghurt for kids . 
 OK . Four saucers . We can buy some custard tarts tomorrow morning . 
 What sort of salary did you get at your previous job ? 
 I see . I am sure we can offer you $ 3 , 500 at the beginning . Would that be satisfactory ? 
 Good . We also have health insurance , bonus and paid vacation . When can you begin to work ? 
 Good . Please come in on Monday . Working hours are from eight to four-thirty . Lunch is fifty-five minutes . 
 Excuse me , Mr . Graham ? I have something I need to discuss with you . 
 I would really appreciate it if we could talk for a few minutes now . It ’ s about the overtime you ’ Ve asked me to put in . 
 Could I have my hair dyed ? 
 I want the latest fashion , can you make some suggestions ? 
 I don't think that was suit me very well , blond is kind of erratic . 
 Oh , no . I think it's better to be a natural chinese , with natural chinese hair.Have you got good brand of hair dye ? 
 I want the best one . 
 After this dye job , it feels I look younger . 
 You talked like the Terminator for two months ? Wow , I think you liked that movie even more than I liked ' Titanic . ' Why did you like ' Terminator ' so much ? 
 Isn't ' Terminator ' really violent ? I usually don't like gory movies because they gross me out . 
 Hmm ... I don't know . Even though it may not be gory , I think it would still totally freak me out . 
 You can't be serious . 
 Okay . 
 Wow ! It ’ s really good for me , especially the living room . It is big enough to put all my stuff there . It ’ s a deal ! I ’ ll rent this one . 
 Sure ! 
 Okay . Thank you for your reminder . 
 Thank you again . 
 Why not . If I were you , I certainly would . 
 As the saying goes , work value work , play value play . All work and no play make a jucky-dull boy , you know . 
 IMPF Bank , Li Lan speaking , how may I help you ? 
 Hello , Mr Peng , how nice to hear from you again . What can I do for you today ? 
 I see . How much exactly ? 
 No , that's OK . I've got all of your information here on the screen in front of me . The money will be ready and waiting for you tomorrow . 
 I can't believe it , I had faith in Bob and he let me down . 
 Really ? 
 What is the weather like today ? 
 And the streets are covered with ice . Do you know what the temperature is today ? 
 It seems 10 degree below zero at least . I don't mind the cold weather , but do hate when it get slippery . 
 That's fine . let's go skating together tomorrow . 
 That may be so , but reading them is an important way to expand your knowledge . 
 Not much . Just sitting here eating some Chinese food . Is that the paper ? Why don't you open it and tell me my horoscope ? 
 What about Gemini ? What's the prediction ? 
 That sounds bad ! I'm really worried , what should I do ? Maybe I should go home and stay in the rest of the day . 
 Excuse me , how many sightseeing spots are there in the park ? 
 Do I have to buy extra ticket if I want to visit the main spots ? 
 Well , do you have through tickets ? 
 Dad , what's the date ? 
 In seven days it will be Christmas Day . 
 So , can I buy some new shoes as a Christmas present ? 
 I really hope to reach an agreement with you today that is suitable and beneficial for us both . I've thought through a lot of these details , and I hope we can have a chance to discuss them and resolve any differences this afternoon . 
 Firstly , we'd like to discuss a discounted price . If you can give us a discount of 7 % on the high volumes orders , we can pay in 60 days . 
 Well , that might be acceptable , if you handle the insurance fees . 
 We cover the insurance and half the transport fee , and only have a discount of 4 % . 
 Done ... 
 That's a good idea , Charlotte . 
 Just a little please . 
 No , less than that . One and a half teaspoonfuls please . That's enough for me . That was very nice . 
 Yes , please . I'd like a cigarette , too . May I have one ? 
 I'm afraid it's empty . 
 It doesn't matter . 
 That's very good advice ! 
 No , I haven ’ t . 
 Perhaps you left that at school . 
 Well . Didn ’ t you go around to the Smith after school ? You might have left it there . 
 But she can ’ t be home now . She might have gone to the library . 
 How do you like the food sold in this sidewalk snack booth ? 
 Any time . But I don't mind eating boxed lunch . The food sanitation is really good too . 
 Hey , it's not that bad . The food is nutritious and it's really convenient . I don't want to spend too much time on eating stuff . 
 Well , will you just go back to work after lunch ? 
 But you didn't eat anything today . 
 All right . I'm going to the McDonald's . 
 No , I never did . It's for my son . He loves it , and I made an agreement with him that he can eat it once a week . 
 Me , either . But , it's for sure that the children market is a really big one . 
 We are interested in your pure silk , but I'm wondering about the price . How much will you possibly offer us ? 
 That's much higher than I expected . Can you come down a bit ? 
 Supposing we agreed to your price , what payment terms could you offer us ? 
 That would be nice . Let's call it a deal . 
 I'm glad you came . You're welcome anytime . 
 I will . See you later . 
 Nice and easy . Just give it a little gas . 
 First you have to put the car into gear . Move this shifter so the arrow points at D for drive . 
 R is for reverse , P is for park , and D1 and D2 are lower gears for going through snow , or up a steep hill . 
 Why ? You said I was hot when smoking . 
 Smoking is killing . I know . 
 I don ’ t believe it . 
 Of course I know it , but you know it's hard to quit smoking ... 
 Yes , ma'am . Whatever you say . 
 On this occasion , most people do . 
 She is a beautiful bride . 
 Are you crying ? 
 Harris and Anne are perfect for each other . 
 You and Tom also make a great couple . 
 For the wedding ? 
 Try to catch this bouquet then . 
 That will be no problem . We never use any kind of inferior packaging . Your goods will be safe . 
 We always do that , but I will make a point to check it for you since it is so important . 
 We don't usually do that unless we are asked to . I'lI tell my staff to take care of this for you . 
 You know , Taylor's been in the hospital for a couple of days . 
 But you're not to blame for them keeping him there . 
 I'm not sure , but we can find out . I bought some crosswords to keep him busy . 
 I'm free on Sunday . I'd like to take a look in Beijing City , could you tell me where to go ? 
 Any place will be fine . you make the decision . 
 I will pick you up at your hotel at eight in the morning . 
 Um , which of them is the better typist ? 
 Is there any difference in their short hand ? 
 How about languages ? 
 Um . That doesn ’ t really matter . Because we have more French visitors than German . 
 Yes , this way please . 
 Here you are . 
 I recommend crisp beef and fried duck . 
 Do you want any dissert ? 
 how's your job search going ? 
 I see . Have you found anything that you're interested in ? 
 what kind of job are you looking for ? 
 there's not a very high demand for that kind of job , is there ? 
 that's a good idea . You have plenty of experience in the tourism industry , don't you ? 
 by the way , I saw a job in the paper this morning that you might be interested in . 
 it's a job at a recruitment agency . 
 well , you have plenty of experience job hunting . I think you'd be the perfect person for the job ! 
 sure , it's the ad circled with a red pen in the middle of the classifieds . Good luck ! 
 You were scared , too ? I dared not tell you my feeling when I heard that . I almost got fainted . 
 But Sarah says she does not care , so long as he loves her . 
 Yes , I wrote a thesis entitled English Education in High School and it was published in the Education Magazine . 
 Yes , I was chosen as a Three Goods student many times in college . 
 My husband and I have thought about it , but we've decided not to have any . They're just too expensive . Besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of Worl 
 For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn't ever have to share . 
 No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . You know , I don't think I've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home . What do you think fo the one-child policy 
 That's true . But as a woman , I'm glad that even though I don't want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have . On the other hand , I can't imagine what China would be like 
 I don't know what other people think , but I , for one , envy only children ! 
 Yes , we'll be there , come hell or high water ! 
 No , not yet . Is it good ? 
 Oh , she's good . She must be getting on a bit now . 
 So what's the movie about ? 
 Huh ? 
 I see . Batwoman married the boss ? 
 Wait a minute , I'm lost . The cop killed the boss ? 
 And Sharon Stone is Batwoman ? 
 So who does he think he is , anyway , I can't believe the way that my boss has been ordering everyone around lately , I mean , it's now like he is the CEO , or anything . 
 Yikes ! you are joking , right ? I can't believe it . No wonder he is so stressed and bossy lately . I thought he was just being ostentatious by giving orders to people and all the different departments . What big shoes to fill ! 
 What does a CEO do anyway ? I know the CEO makes the most money in the company , but what does he actually do ? 
 Must be one smart guy . 
 we just moved in yesterday , actually . 
 it's great ! Unfortunately , we're going to spend a fortune doing everything up . 
 it's about 200 years old . It has a lot of history ! 
 it's just off of the ring road . 
 it's bigger than our last one . I've got flowers in the front , and fruits , vegetables and a fish pond in the back . 
 oh , yes . Our windows let plenty of natural light in . They've also got wonderful views of the park behind our house . 
 right now , there are three bedrooms , two barrooms , a kitchen , a sitting room , a dining room , and a living room . We're hoping to add on a green room and a guest bedroom . In fact , when the guest room i 
 Mom , give me a glass of orange juice . 
 Oh , sorry mom , i forgot.please give me a glass of orange juice . 
 Oh , it is nice and cold , definitely good orange juice . 
 Oh , sorry again , thank you mom . 
 Hi , this is China Southern Airlines . Is that Miss . Ye ? 
 I am responsible for verifying your information before you come for the interview . What , uh , position do you want ... uh ... to do ? 
 Sorry , I am used to speaking in a slow pace , but I will try to be faster . What position do you want to do ? 
 Excuse me . Could you tell me how to get to the library ? 
 On Memorial Avenue ? 
 I'm afraid I don't . I'm quite new in town . 
 No , I don't . But I do know where the shopping mall is . 
 Well , thank you very much , I hope I can find it . 
 Yes , bring me a bottle of wine and filet steak . 
 Yes , what kind do you have ? 
 I think French will be fine . 
 Yes . What's the buying rate for euro ? 
 Okay . I'd like to change some euro into US dollars , please . 
 Six hundred euro . 
 Here you are . 
 In fifties please . 
 Well done ! 
 Hello ! Do you have any rooms available tomorrow night ? 
 Just one . 
 I need a room with two double beds . 
 Non . 
 Six nights . 
 Oh you look awful ! What ’ s the matter ? 
 Oh dear . Maybe you ’ Ve caught a cold . 
 Well then , you should get some rest this weekend and don ’ t go out drinking . 
 I'm looking for a necklace for my girl friend as a birthday present . 
 I like that one over there . Can you show it to me ? 
 Exactly . How much do you want for it ? 
 Is it made of pure gold ? 
 I'll take it . Please wrap it up for me and give me the receipt . 
 I know how you feel . I had a similar problem with a landlord a few years ago . Fortunately , the one we have now is very nice . 
 Morning , Michael . I ’ Ve been very busy lately . One of our other vendors is going out of business and I ’ Ve been searching for a suitable replacement . 
 No , thanks . I ’ Ve been trying to cut down on the caffeine . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . The demand for phone cameras is growing , and Pear has been falling behind in the market . 
 No , we ’ re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . We were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal . 
 Can you tell me about some good deals on produce ? 
 What exactly are mangoes ? 
 Is the seed edible ? 
 How much does a mango cost ? 
 Maybe I won't like the taste . 
 How do I tell the difference between a ripe one and an unripe one ? 
 Where do most of them come from ? 
 Anyone home ? Jen ! 
 Wow ! You're really working up a storm ! 
 You look like a cooking show host--only messier . 
 Give me a sec . 
 Whatever meal that you plan on making . 
 I do all the cooking . 
 Save it . If you want something to eat , then make it yourself . 
 I had a long day today . I really am not in the mood to make anything . 
 Thanks . I'm going to go take a nap . 
 Thank you . 
 I don't know yet . What's your idea , Dad ? 
 Dad ! It's cold now ! 
 You look tired . 
 Really ? How come ? 
 You shouldn ’ t work so hard . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Daddy , I want to buy a ten-speed-sportsman . 
 No , I'm not asking for money . I'm asking for your advice . 
 That looks like a bad accident . 
 No , there ’ s a police car behind us . He ’ ll stop . 
 Yeah . It ’ s pretty bad , that car looks like a coke can . 
 Yeah , it looks like we ’ re in for a long drive . 
 All right . 
 Well , as per capital income goes up and up , the growth sector seems to be in the high-end . 
 Yes . Things certainly have changed since I was a boy . We've developed very quickly . 
 I don't see why not . We do have some problems , but we are still willing to work hard and wages aren't too high at this point . 
 Guess who I saw yesterday ? 
 My cousin Monk . Have you seen her lately ? 
 Nothing exactly . She's grown into a very attractive young lady . 
 You know , her long lovely blond hair and beautiful blue eyes really make her stand out from others . 
 Yean . Around five feet five inches tall . 
 Yes , there is . There is only one ship there every day . 
 It leaves at 9:30 a . m .. 
 Yes , all the cabins are fit for two . 
 At Pier Five . 
 I haven't met you at the gym for a long time . 
 why ? You have a decent salary , lots of promotion opportunities and a regular life of going to the office at 9 o ' clock and coming back home at 5 in the evening . 
 then SOHO is your ideal work style . 
 and you don't have to work under that much pressure and control . 
 sounds great . Are there many business opportunity ? 
 it's good to have business around . But you should also do some exercise to keep fit . 
 What's for dinner tonight ? 
 I'm not making anything . 
 What am I supposed to cook ? 
 I want some chicken and potatoes . 
 When are you going to make it ? 
 Fine , I'll make it . 
 What's that ? 
 For me ? 
 Wow ! It's big ! What could it be ? 
 What does that mean , not big but fat ? You didn't buy ... 
 I ’ m sure I can do it well . I ’ Ve always wanted to be the best in whatever I did . Give me a chance . 
 You ’ re questioning my ability ? I tell ya , I can make it ! I ’ ll talk to your boss . 
 You think so ? Let ’ s take a chance ! 
 That sounds like fun . 
 It's hard to say . But why ? 
 I can understand your position . We can not make any promise , but we'll try our best . 
 That's right . But feeling sorry for someone is one thing , and sticking to our principles is another . We must make a clear cut between them . 
 Hello , Susan , it ’ s me , An . 
 I am fine . I am going swimming this afternoon . Are you coming with me ? 
 Maybe I can meet you at the club and we can play tennis together . 
 Be quiet , Will you ? 
 I can't wait until my car is repaired . The commuting with public transportation is killing me . 
 But it is ! Take this morning for example . The subway was so packed this morning , I got totally squished by about a hundred busy commuters on the way to work . 
 That's true . The bus is even worse . Just thinking about taking the bus every day makes me tired ! Hey , how do you get to work every day ? 
 I'll bet it's good exercise , too ... a good way to keep fit . 
 Thank you for your visit to our company . I'd like to make an introduction for you . Is there anything in particular you'd like to know ? 
 Our production speed is almost twice the industry-wide average . And we've already expanded the factory this year . 
 I'm not familiar with that part . Let me call someone in charge . 
 I have a little experience . I guided a few foreign tourists around Beijing last year as a part-time job . I showed them to the Great Wall , the Imperial Palace , and the Summer Palace . 
 Yes , I know . A friend of mine is a guide . He talked with me about his work , but I don't mind working hard . 
 No , this is my first . 
 I'd like to be an overseas tour guide someday . Would there ever be any chance of that ? 
 Yes . When can I get the decision ? I hope you can give me a definite answer as soon as possible . If I'd turned down , I ll have to secure a position elsewhere . 
 Thank you . Good-bye . 
 Next please . Hello . How can I help you ? 
 Would you like one way or round trip ? 
 When will you be leaving ? 
 In about 2 hours . 
 First class or coach ? 
 OK , let me check availability . I'm sorry . Tickets for that flight are sold out . 
 Let me see . Yes , that one still has seats available . Would you like me to reserve a seat for you ? 
 That'll be 120 dollars . 
 Thank you , here's your change . 
 Mom , there isn't any hot water 
 It's getting cold . 
 How happy you are ! Next Monday is your wedding day . Congratulations ! 
 Fred is really a good guy . And he loves you so much . 
 He's after your own heart , it is important . 
 I promise ! 
 Are you serious ? 
 I ’ m making a bookcase . Give me that hammer please , Dan . 
 No , not that one . The big one . 
 Thanks , Dan . 
 I ’ m going to paint it . 
 I ’ m going to paint it pink . 
 This bookcase isn ’ t for me . It ’ s for my daughter , Susan . Pink ’ s her favorite colour . 
 What would make this apartment better for you ? 
 You can have a different carpet , but you have to pay more if it costs more . 
 It could vary quite a bit , between 2 and 10 dollars per square yard . 
 I have to see a sample . Bring me one this week , please . 
 Both the new paint and new carpet will be finished by next week . 
 don't you think it ’ s a bit bright ? 
 that dress looks lovely on you , but it ’ s not very practical , is it ? 
 I like the jeans , but you need something to go with the top . It ’ s too plain on its own . 
 that might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ? 
 thanks . You ’ d be ok on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ? 
 that looks great . Just one more thing---you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ? 
 no , they ’ re a Prada knock-off for 1/10 of the price of the real thing . 
 if I were you , I ’ d buy that now while it ’ s on sale . If you spend more than $ 100 , you get a $ 50 voucher for more clothes . 
 How can I get to Lakeside Park ? 
 Will it take me straight there ? 
 What do you do if you find something that isn't on your list ? 
 What color is your new dress ? 
 Thanks you . 
 That ’ s a nice dress . It ’ s very smart . 
 What color is it ? 
 That ’ s a lovely hat . 
 What did he aim at ? 
 How could he have such an ill intention ? I think your father can see that through . 
 Hey , Andrew . How's everything with work ? 
 Really ? What's he been doing ? 
 Are you ? What are you busy with ? 
 I'm looking for a white purse as a gift . Could you show what you have in stock ? 
 They must be popular again this season . 
 Wow . this is nice . I'll take this one . I guess if she doesn't like it she can return it , right ? 
 Good evening . 
 Let me check the list . Yes , we do have a reservation under Mr . Tim . 
 It doesn't matter . Follow me , please . What do you think of the table in the center of the dining room ? 
 I'm sorry , but you see , all the tables by the window are small , with up to 4 seats . 
 Thank you for your understanding , Mr . Tim . 
 Yes , I will . 
 Morning . I'm a new user of your credit card and I was wondering if I'm taking full advantage of it . 
 Yes , of course . It's so much easier than cash , to be honest ; nowadays I hardly ever use cash . I just put it on the card and pay off the balance every month . 
 Really ? 
 So , if for some reason I was having a bad month and spent a little too much I could just pay the minimum ? 
 How so ? 
 Oh , I see . Well , I don't plan on only paying the minimum , but it's good to know that I can if I had to . Thanks for that . 
 I'm fine , Dr . Beecham . Yes , just a cleaning and check-up today . 
 ( She probed my teeth and checked my gums . ) Well , it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose . We need to fill that cavity before it gets any worse and the crown needs to be refitted . Make an appointment for next week and I'll take care of them . 
 Since you had that done here , we'll take care of it . There won't be a charge . And , your insurance should cover the work on the cavity . Now , I'm going to have the hygienist do your cleaning and I'll see you soon for the other work . 
 How ’ s it going ? 
 Did you need help with something ? 
 That won ’ t be possible today . 
 You can only view the apartment with an appointment . 
 Are you available this Friday ? 
 Your appointment for Friday at 6 pm has been confirmed . 
 Hello . In order to kill your time you can experience our facial massage for free . 
 This way please . First , we should clean your face with our clarifying cream . And then we use the massage cream . Next do the massage . I hope that you can feel comfortable . 
 Thank you . 
 Do you want the large size , or the small size ? 
 Yes , we do . I don't have any small pads . I only have large ones . Do you want a pad ? 
 A bottle of glue . 
 I only have small boxes . Do you want one ? 
 Is that all ? 
 What else do you want ? 
 Excuse me , please.Could you tell me how to get to the No . 10 Middle School ? 
 Is it far from here to there ? 
 Many thanks ! 
 May I help you ? 
 what currency would you like to trade in ? 
 No problem , we can accept any denomination . How much would you like to exchange today ? 
 It's a shame you didn't come a little earlier , the exchange rate was reset yesterday afternoon . The American dollar is now worth 7.45RMB.If you would like to sell RIB , we can give you a rate of 7.35.Will that be all right ? 
 John passed away . 
 Yesterday . He suffered from a serious disease . When he saw the red light , it was too late . 
 How long do you plan to stay here ? 
 How so ? 
 What are your future plans and what kind of expectations do you have of the company ? 
 Did you promise me to get the bread ? 
 But you forgot to get the bread . 
 Well , I certainly did . 
 You are free . You can go now . 
 I'll do with the cake . 
 I hate to do this , but I've got to cancel a reservation I made earlier this week . 
 My name is Rudy Randolph . I'm at 818-555-1234 . The reservation was for April 9 . 
 Okay , thank you . I'll make another reservation as soon as I can . 
 Would you check the engine , please ? It is knocking . 
 Yes , please . When can you get it done ? 
 By credit . 
 I read everything I can get my hands on but I like love stories best . What do you think about the love stories ? 
 I don't think so . I like them . Then what's your favorite book ? 
 Oh , the history books are dull to me . 
 I am going to the beech . How about coming with me ? 
 Don't forget the sun block lotion . You don't want a sunburn , do you ? 
 Good afternoon , Miss Tao . Please sit down . 
 I ’ Ve read your application materials with interest . Now I want to ask you a few questions , if you don ’ t mind . 
 The first is why you choose our company ? 
 Why do you want to quit your present company ? 
 Well , when do you think you can come over to work ? 
 When you start to work , I ’ ll give you $ 3,000 a month . 
 Hello , this is Sheila from Huawei Corp . Is that Li Lei ? 
 I am glad to tell you that you are supposed to come for an interview tomorrow . Are you free tomorrow ? 
 Well , I can't hear you . 
 I have a problem . 
 I owe fees , but a bank statement never came in the mail about it . 
 I have no idea about the fee , so my fees went up . 
 Will you be able to solve my problem ? 
 So , I don ’ t have to pay any of it ? 
 That ’ s fabulous . Thank you very much . 
 Yeah , the government really takes a bite , doesn ’ t it ? 
 Yeah , I don ’ t mind it either . We ’ ll both end up rich slobs and not need it , but what if we do , you know ? 
 Yeah . My grandmother gets by on social security and the money my grandfather invested when he was alive . 
 Really ? No , they couldn ’ t . None of them would have jobs if they did . 
 Have you thought about it seriously ? 
 Ok , did you find a new company ? 
 Good for you , but your leaving will be a great loss to us . It is so nice to work with you . 
 Do you have any special skills ? 
 What qualifications have you got ? 
 Do you get special training in office skills ? 
 Please tell me about work you have done , which qualifies you for this job . 
 Can you tell me , Ms . Smith , about the training programs you initiated this year ? 
 What ’ s the result ? 
 That seems very impressive . Good work ! 
 So Alex , you ’ re off to the Olympic stadium then ? 
 Wow , that should be really exciting , especially with so many famous athletes there . 
 Well have a good time . Get me some autographs if you can . 
 It is so wonderful that this transaction turned out to be the satisfaction of both parties . 
 I hope that we can continue our cooperation . 
 This is he . May I help you ? 
 I ’ m very sorry , Madam . Can you tell me what the problem is over the phone or would you like me to go to your office ? 
 What ’ s going on ? 
 Is there any water damage ? 
 I ’ ll go to your apartment tomorrow to fix the pipe . 
 I ’ ll just do it myself . 
 You ’ re right about that . 
 That ’ s fine . 
 It is about 10 minutes walk . 
 Are we going to come back here for lunch ? 
 I have finished . We can go now . 
 Let's stop at the newsagent , I would like to buy a newspaper . We can also buy postcards for your friends . 
 Yes it is down there , at the end of the road , next to the supermarket . 
 Do you have any hobbies ? 
 Oh , that ’ s interesting , and but what kind of things ? 
 Stones ? I know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ? 
 well , I can ’ t just imagine it . 
 It looks wonderful . Very authentic . 
 OK . So , what can you recommend ? 
 Is it salty ? 
 What does ' Duppa del Giono ' mean ? I'm sorry I don't know how to pronounce that . 
 No . I'll try them . Sounds good . 
 Yeah , we probably should.How much is normal ? 
 That sounds about right . 
 Don ’ t you have it ? Did you lose it ? 
 Myrdal , purse don ’ t just disappear . Think carefully . When did you have it last ? 
 OK . Let ’ go back to the hotdog stand . 
 Because it was her husband who beat her . 
 She said that she didn ’ t want to foul her own nest . 
 I think I have a piece of apple pie . 
 Coffee would be fine . 
 Excuse me . Mr . Emory ? 
 I wanted to see if I could arrange a meeting with you to discuss recruitment . 
 Hello . Can I help you ? 
 I'm sorry , but that class is already full.And also , students are supposed to register through the touch-tone registration system . 
 That's because it's full . 
 Well , I could put you on a waiting list.But that doesn't guarantee you will get into the class . What is your name ? 
 Alright . And what is your major ? 
 Wait a minute . You're a Comp Lit major ? 
 Why didn't you tell me ? I didn't know you were one of our students . 
 The university computer system saves extra places , in class 287 for comp lit students . I can give you a special code.When you register by phone , you can use the code to get into the class . 
 That's right . 
 Sure . Here is the code number , with information on how to use it . 
 Sure . Just call the touch-tone registration system again.Then , follow the directions on the sheet . You will get in no problem . 
 Next time you come in here , I will recognize you . 
 I got the information that there is a killer sale at the shopping mall near our block . Get up and I will wait for you at the gate of our flat . 
 Stop complaining , OK ? 
 No , I am not a shopaholic , but a super shopaholic . And I really enjoy smelling the gorgeous clothes and new bags . 
 Hello , this is Peter Dixon from NEZ news radio . May I speak to Mr . Wilson please ? 
 Good morning , Mr . Wilson . I ’ m calling to confirm the date of the next interview program . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Come here , please . 
 I don't like the style . 
 Black is not my favorite colour . 
 It's pretty . How much is it ? 
 It's too expensive . Can you come down a little ? 
 I'll buy it if forty . 
 What are you having for lunch ? 
 Did you bring that from home ? 
 What kind of sandwich did you get ? 
 How was it ? 
 I think I got a sandwich there once before . 
 Yes , and they didn't get my order right either . 
 That sounds great ! 
 I'm doing well . How about you ? 
 So how have you been lately ? 
 I'm actually in school right now . 
 I'm attending PCC right now . 
 It's not bad . There are a lot of people there . 
 Thanks . 
 Yes , I was . I was almost an hour late . 
 I said I was terribly sorry . But he said it was quite all right . 
 No , he didn't scold me because he was late , too . 
 Yeah , I think it's the best way to relax . 
 Really it depends on my mood . When I am sad or depressed , I like comedies . If I'm feeling good , I'll watch almost anything . 
 Yeah , unfortunately , nowadays directors are often more interested in making money than making a good film . 
 Yeah , many of my all-time-favorites were made in the forties . They've already stood the test of time and will stay with us for a long time . 
 Dad , where are we off to ? 
 Where are we going to have a drink ? 
 Yes ? 
 Good . I will have hot chocolate . 
 When crossing the road you must always pay attention to what's around you . 
 I am not sure . We will ask for directions in the coffee shop . 
 Look , daddy is on again . Don't you think he is handsome ? 
 The seats in the middle of this stadium are great , but they're already occupied by somebody else . 
 Of course , tomorrow evening there will be a most exciting game . 
 Rockets vs Lakers . Yao Ming , my idol , will appear in front of several hundred million of the worldwide audience . 
 In 2002 . And since then he has attracted more attention than ever . 
 Oh , you know something . He is 2.26 meters tall . But he is also nimble and skillful . 
 Yes , what's worse is he can't take any further part in the game . 
 Never mind . After all he is not so attractive as Yao Ming , right ? 
 Hello , Cindy . Congratulations ! I hear you ’ re getting married . 
 When ’ s the big day ? 
 May I help you ? 
 Premium or regular ? 
 Anything else , sir ? Should I check the water and the oil ? 
 Joanna , I will go to the outlet center . You wanna go with me ? 
 I saw Emily yesterday evening . She was wearing a CD evening gown . She told me she bought it in the outlet center and she saved $ 120 ! 
 How do you spend your day , Helen ? 
 Really ? What time do you go to work ? 
 And when do you get home at night ? 
 So what do you do , exactly ? 
 Gee , I'm sorry . I don't watch TV . 
 Yeah . But he soon feel regretted for it . 
 He is more nice than wise . 
 What's wrong with it ? 
 Have you checked the connections on your computer ? 
 There are cords that connect your computer to a power outlet . 
 It won't turn on if the cords aren't connected . 
 Try it and see if it works . 
 It should work , but let me know if it doesn't . 
 Annie , you also know the ' new age people ' . I think these people must have undergone much sufferings of flesh in order to ride skillfully . 
 The skateboard does not pollute the air , either . It can be used as a tool to ride instead of walk . 
 Whoops . That's my pager . I had to get it for work . 
 Well , I know how to turn it off ! 
 What are your hobbies ? 
 Like what ? 
 How much is it all together ? 
 Is it possible for you to reduce the price ? 
 London is such a historic city ! There ’ s history everywhere you look . There ’ s nelson ’ s column , built as a monument to one of the Britain ’ s great admirals and his important victory . He won the battle of 
 Nearby , on the banks of the thames , there ’ s the statue of Boadicea . She fought the Romans when they invaded Britain . 
 She was a very controversial leader . Are we going to visit the famous tower of London later ? 
 I ’ m looking forward to seeing the famous castle and prison . Many historic figures were imprisoned there in the past . I really want to see the crown jewels too . 
 Where ’ s that ? Oh , I know ! Madame Tussaud ’ s the waxworks museum . 
 Sometimes , it ’ s hard to know who belongs in each section of the museum ! 
 OK , sir . When will you be there ? 
 No problem , sir . 
 What happened ? 
 Where there are difficulties , there are ways to get over them . Hold on ! 
 No problem . I ’ Ve got a really light week . Anytime ’ s fine by me . 
 All right , I ’ ll put you in my book . 
 Of course . What do you want me to do , Mom ? 
 Alright , what's in them ? They are so heavy ! 
 Well , hurry up and open the door please . I told you these things are heavy . 
 Oh , yes , it's in my pocket . But how can I get the key while I'm holding all these bags ? 
 I'll give you the boxes . You can then go to our gift-wrapping department . 
 It's on the first floor , to the right of the main entrance . 
 Have a nice holiday ! 
 Ms . : Do you have a question , Mary ? 
 Ms . : Let me give you a hall pass for it . 
 Ms . : With a hall pass , you can go to the ladies ' room or wherever you need to go during class time . 
 Ms . : If a teacher stops you in the hallway , just show him or her the pass . 
 Ms . : That's right . 
 Don't you think it's a little early to be looking for schools ? We haven't even had the baby yet ! 
 You are going to be such an adorable father ! Tell me about this school . 
 What about inside the school ? 
 I think our child is going to love it ! 
 I said he was nothing but a yeoman . 
 Yes . 
 I advise you to read Playboy.You can get a lot from it . 
 That's why it's interesting . 
 I really would rather just listen . Isn't there anyone else who wants to sing ? 
 I know , but ... Hey , Stanley's here ! I've been wanting to hear him sing all night . 
 I'll put the song at the front of the list . 
 No , have they have another fight ? 
 You must be joking . Those two ? 
 So when did all this happen ? 
 Well , I believe it now , and when are they are getting married ? 
 I can hardly believe it . 
 Yes . We have reservations . 
 Jack Bates . 
 The reservation was for a double for three nights , wasn't it ? 
 Credit card . 
 Thanks . 
 We'll first go to Mount Tai , then we'll go to Sichuan by air , after that we'll be leaving for Tibet . 
 At least 20 days . 
 Why ? 
 It is because your children have grown up , and you haven ’ t lived with a child for a long time . 
 Is there a reason why you're trying to get off the phone so fast ? 
 I wasn't done talking to you . 
 I'm not being nosey . I'm just asking . 
 That's not nice . 
 Okay . 
 I hope you can give me some advice . I'm sick and tired of coming here or to the post office to pay my utility bills . It's such a long way from my home , but I checked and you are my nearest branch . Is there anyway I can do it from home ? 
 A Direct Debit Service ? What's that exactly ? 
 But how will you know how much I should pay ? I mean , I receive my bills , not you . 
 I see . So , that would mean that every month it would just come from my account ? That does sound like a good idea , totally trouble free . 
 Nine ... but I'll be ten on May 1st.When is your birthday ? 
 Are you going to have a birthday party ? 
 have you adapted to the lifestyle in China ? 
 what ? 
 what is it ? 
 that makes you feel uncomfortable ? 
 perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy . 
 well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus . 
 yeah . 
 Thank you , 175 yuan . 
 Here is your change and your receipt.Do you have goods unpaid on you , sir 
 I'm sorry I need to call the security to have a look . 
 Sorry , sir , it's my job to make sure the goods are paid . 
 Sure . Ah ... That's the problem . Have you paid for it 
 Let me see ... Oh , I am awfully sorry sir . 
 Are you ready , Pa ? 
 No . 
 Mrs . Sue ? 
 Mr . Brown will have to call you back in a little while . 
 Good afternoon ! 
 I'm very well , thank you.How are you ? 
 Yes , it's beautiful , but it's also very hot . 
 What's the weather like in your country ? 
 Where do you live ? 
 Here.Near this school . 
 Yes . I ’ d like to make an appointment with Dr . Galas . Could you arrange it for me ? 
 I ’ m not available tomorrow afternoon . How about tomorrow morning ? 
 That ’ s fine . Thanks . 
 Certainly . My name is Janet Smith , and my phone number is 610-555-1234 . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Do you have any apartment to rent ? 
 Where is it . 
 Is it furnished ? 
 That's good . When can I go to see the house ? 
 Fine . 
 I do hope this undesirable incident will not stand in the way of our future business . 
 I put in two quarters for a coke , but nothing came out of the machine . 
 I'm sure it's broken . 
 Today , we have invited a special guest , Prof . Yang . He will give us some advice on the legal aspects of international business . Your international legal advice is important to our business well being . Please give us some counsels on such issues as which laws govern the contract , what recourse is available for default or breach of contract by our clients or what to do if a dispute arises . 
 In spite of this , international business contracts and arrangement must be precise , specific and all-inclusive to lessen misunderstanding , misconceptions and disagreements to the minimum 。 
 How can we protect our patents and trade market abroad ? 
 As you know , our main focus is to penetrate the markets of countries in Asia . What is the current legal framework in the countries ? 
 Several years ago , the countries and China singed memorandums of understanding , pursuant to which the countries will improve their laws government intellectual property rights protection over the following two to three years . 
 Do you have anything to declare ? 
 Are these all your personal things ? 
 Please open the black case . 
 I ’ Ve come to hear about your offer for bristles . 
 Why , your price has soared . It ’ s almost 25 % higher than last year ’ s . It would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price . 
 I ’ m afraid I can ’ t agree with you there . I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ’ Ve received from other sources . 
 I agree that yours are of better quality . But there ’ s competition from synthetic products , too . You can ’ t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven ’ t changed much over the years . 
 Well , we ’ ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price . But I ’ ll have to try , I suppose . 
 What is the matter ? 
 That is to say , love is blind . 
 Yes , I need to buy a computer for this semester . I was told it is cheaper to buy computers here . 
 I don't know much about computers.But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer . 
 Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ? 
 History . 
 Thirty percent ? 
 Wow . That's really good.And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ? 
 Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ? 
 I don't want Macintosh . I want PC . 
 What ? Are you serious ? 
 But nobody uses Macintosh ! 
 Yes , I'm from Taiwan . 
 But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese . 
 Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry . 
 Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later . 
 Hello ! Is this Mr . Chang ? 
 This is Kelly speaking . I am calling from London . How are you , Mr . Chang ? 
 Mr . Chang , I just want to tell you that we are leaving London for Beijing by flight CP 645 on Saturday morning . Could you meet us at the airport , please ? 
 I will say it again ... Do you hear me now ? 
 Thank you very much . Goodbye . 
 IBA Bank , Business Banking Department . Ling Ming speaking . How may I help you ? 
 Hello , Mr Gwent . What can I do for you today ? 
 Of course . Do you know which bank it was sent through and the amount and currency ? 
 Yes , here it is . That's received and cleared , so it's available for withdrawal . 
 Wow ! I'm so happy for you . 
 Yeah , I went . Did you go ? 
 That's nice , have you been to the movies lately ? 
 It may have been random , but have you ? 
 I would love to catch a movie this weekend . 
 I don't want to see a movie by myself . 
 I think I might just go to the movies . 
 Yes , I've been thinking about visiting you . I hope to get some advice from you . 
 My field is electronic engineering . Which country do you think I should go ? 
 Which university should I apply to ? 
 Oh , I see . Thank you very much . 
 Hi . What ’ s up ? 
 Okay , I ’ ll ask my plumber to come by and fix it today . What else ? 
 What ’ s the matter with it ? 
 I ’ ll get an electrician to repair it as soon as possible . Is that everything ? 
 I ’ m sorry . There ’ s nothing I can do about that . You ’ Ve got to call the phone company . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Good afternoon , could you connect this call with Mr Brown , please 
 This is Li Ping of ABC computer company limited . I'm calling on our Mr Wilson the general manager of our company . 
 I'm afraid Mr Wilson would like to speak to Mr Brown right now.He ' s got an urgent matter to discuss with Mr Brown without delay . 
 Thank you for your assistance , Mr Bush . 
 What are you doing ? 
 Are there any good programs on TV ? 
 Which Channel is it ? 
 It doesn't seem quite interesting . Would you change the channel ? 
 Awfully sorry , sir . There are no rooms available now . 
 Sorry , may I have your name ? 
 Pls wait a minute , let me check . Excuse me , but I can't seem to find your name on our list . Are you sure you have a reservation for tonight ? 
 I am terribly sorry . There must have been some mistakes . Let me check it again . Oh , yes , there is a name listed as Tommy Bush . It must be the fault of the clerk who registered your name . I apologize . 
 According to the records , your reservation is for a single room with shower and air conditioners for two nights . The room rate will be 110 dollars per night , including 10 % tax and 4 % service charge . Is this right ? 
 May I make a copy of your card ? 
 Ok , now could you fill out this registration form ? 
 Your room number is 707 . Here is your key . The bellhop will help you carry the suitcases to your room . Have a nice evening ! 
 What would you like to change ? 
 I would be willing to put in a different color carpet if you pay the price difference . 
 It would cost between 2 and 10 dollars more per square yard . 
 I would be willing to look at a different color . You need to bring me a sample . 
 You can have the new carpet and paint by next Monday . 
 Yes , sir . How would you like to pay the bill , sir ? 
 Yes , sir . But we only accept American Express , Master card and Visa . What kind do you have ? 
 Wait a moment , please . 
 But , Mom , I can't eat anymore . I'm stuffed . 
 It's not that I don't like your cooking , but I ate some cookies before we had dinner . 
 OK ! 
 Thanks ! 
 It's comfortable , but now I'm a little tired . 
 Thank you ! I lived there when I came to Beijing last time . It's comfortable and beautiful . 
 Thank you ! I will . When and where will the dinner be ? 
 Oh , that's nice . Thank you for arranging all of this . 
 Good night , mum . 
 I ’ m thinking about redecorating my bedroom . I bought this magazine in order to get some ideas . What do you think of this ? 
 I ’ d like to have the bed and the wardrobe . 
 Yes , it would . It ’ s very expensive though . 
 Yes . I ’ m sure I could find something similar at one . I ’ d also like to get a new carpet for my bedroom . 
 That ’ s a good idea . I ’ m really looking forward to redoing my bedroom . 
 I always do . Did you go to school today ? 
 You should have , but have you seen any movies lately ? 
 Maybe it was , but answer the question . 
 I want to go to see a movie this weekend . 
 I don't want to go alone . 
 No , I want to go to the movies instead . 
 I ’ m afraid not . He will be not free until 11:30 . 
 Let me check . 
 You called yesterday to tell me that our funds under the L / C had arrived ? It's Ming Cha Legal Services . 
 Yes , it sure is . The L / C number is JD185649000023 . 
 Correct . Could I convert that into RIB ? 
 That's fine , thanks . 
 I'm here on business . 
 From the numbers , it seems like Forest Inc . is our digest competitor ... Le'Ban and Markford are also major contenders in our market . 
 here's information about our competitor's recent market activities ... 
 We're in a very competitive environment . It's sink or saimin this market . 
 I'll see you in Sterlet , then . 
 Sterlet . It's spelt 0 , S , T , E , R , L , E , Y . 
 What kind of jobs have you had ? 
 How many years have you worked as a Production Manager ? 
 Would you like to tell me something about your outstanding achievements ? 
 Wonderful . Then how many employers have you worked for ? 
 Then have you received any award at your present company ? 
 How would you evaluate the company you are with ? 
 How would your colleagues evaluate you ? 
 Can you get recommendations from your present employers ? 
 Do you have any questions ? 
 How about seconds , Victor ? 
 I ’ m glad you could make it . 
 I think a pipe burst in my apartment . 
 You ’ ll find the pipe in my bathroom . 
 It ’ s been leaking for a couple of days now . 
 I understand . 
 I just want the problem taken care of . 
 I love your little Lulu dolls.How much for a batch of 6,000 ? 
 That ’ s a little steep for our company.Do you offer any discounts ? 
 Hmmm.It wouldn ’ t be easy , but if the discount makes it worthwhile , we can consider it.How much of a discount would that give us ? 
 So , for an additional 6,000 dollars , we get twice as many dolls ? That still might be a little hard.Couldn ’ t you discount it further ? We ’ Ve been pricing other suppliers , and this discount might 
 I think we can handle that . Let me confirm with my boss and touch base with you again tomorrow . 
 Yes . Do you exchange foreign money here ? 
 What kinds of currency do you change ? 
 Could you tell me what the exchange rate for USD is today ? 
 I want to change some Us dollars to cover my expense here . 
 Thank you . 
 Sure . What's this for ? 
 What about measuring the floor for a new carpet , and the walls for new wallpaper ? 
 Good idea . I was thinking the same myself . 
 Do you want to go shopping with me ? 
 How about Saturday morning ? 
 Did you ever get your bus pass ? 
 Why not ? 
 Actually , it'll save you money . 
 Because you can use your bus pass as many times as you want . 
 Yeah , and you never have to worry about scraping for change . 
 Yeah , So , are you going to buy one ? 
 How was your education going on in Australia ? 
 Where are you going to work then , in Australia or back in China ? 
 Why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? Many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad . 
 Yeah , China's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country . 
 I should be most delighted . 
 Delighted I was able to help . 
 Oh , Madam , buy what ? 
 Oh , oh , Madam , Madam , I'm afraid you have the wrong number . 
 No . It's Mike's Sporting Goods . 
 No . I don't . I suggest you look in the phone book . 
 No problem . 
 Would you tell me the nature of the problem , sir ? 
 Perhaps you saw a silverfish , sir . 
 Sir , you haven't been drinking by any chance , have you ? 
 Forgive me . You're 100 percent correct . Allow me to transfer you to my supervisor . 
 I would like to have shelled shrimps with cashew nuts . 
 Strawberry cake as dessert , please . By the way , could you serve my main course without garlic and put less ginger in it . 
 Excuse me , sir . Can I look at your ticket ? 
 You must have left it somewhere . 
 Well , I think you should pay upon arrival . 
 So how ’ s everything going for Christmas ? 
 What ’ s that ? Don ’ t tell me you ’ Ve still got Christmas cards to write , it usually takes my wife a month to write all of ours . 
 He still doesn ’ t know that Santa isn ’ t real ? How old is he , eight ? 
 You think it ’ s better that he should be told ? 
 That happened to my oldest girl . She became really upset when her classmates told her Santa wasn ’ t real . 
 Well , when you tell him , be gentle . It ’ s hard for kids to find out something like that . 
 If I hear " Love Me Tender " one more time , I think I'm going to go crazy ! 
 Can we adjust the pitch a little ? Maybe he'll sound better in a higher key . 
 Hey ! Where are you going ... ? 
 I usually just have a bowl of cereal . 
 Yeah , but I don't usually have time to eat a big breakfast . 
 What do you make ? 
 That sounds pretty good . 
 That is a very quick meal to make . 
 Oatmeal and toast sounds good to me . 
 Sure . Take your time . 
 $ 80 . 
 Open your suitcase please . 
 Do you have anything do declare ? 
 Any cigarettes ? Baker ? 
 What is the white powder ? Are they drugs ? 
 May I open one of those ? Let me taste it . 
 Can you tell Bob from Tom ? 
 Don't you notice that Bob has a mole on his face , but Tom does not . 
 Would you and your wife care to come to our place and have tea with us some afternoon ? 
 How about tomorrow afternoon ? 
 This is a very good meeting , Liz . 
 I think we have . Is there anything else to discuss ? 
 Then let's call it a day , shall we ? 
 After a while . 
 What ’ s the problem ? 
 O . K . Do you have your receipt ? 
 Thank you . Do you want your money back , or would you like to exchange it ? 
 O . K . Here ’ s a receipt for store credit . Just take it back to the stereo section and one of our salesmen will help you . 
 No problem . Thank you . 
 Just between you and me , I think he's lazy . 
 No , I haven't . 
 Emm ... yes . But I wasn't too impressed . I found her a little stuck up . 
 Tom ... you are her boss , you down . Of course , she's helpful to you . 
 I don't think so actually . She never even says " hello " to me . 
 I thought he only liked to listen ? 
 And he can move , too ! He dances like Ricky Martin ! 
 Yeah ... hearts , stars and some weird looking things . 
 So decode this for me , Madame Psycho . 
 I'm waiting ... 
 Hi , Nicole . Did you have a good weekend ? 
 Really ? Why ? 
 And I bet you studied , too . 
 Well , I didn't clean the house and I didn't study . I stayed in bed and watched TV . 
 Sort of . I played golf on my computer ! 
 Okay . Do you have your receipt ? 
 I am sorry , but you need a receipt for a refund . 
 Perhaps you would like to talk to customer service . 
 They're right upstairs . 
 Good luck . I hope someone can help you . 
 Katherine ? Well , she's good at languages . 
 She knows how to speak Spanish and Japanese . 
 And she's good at sports , too . She knows how to play tennis and basketball . 
 But there's one thing she's not good at . 
 She's not good at remembering things . We have a date , and she's an hour late ! ! 
 Let me see ... I am sorry the tables you want are booked . 
 No problem , sir . Let me help you . 
 What a beautiful view we have here . 
 Wonderful . Will we have any free time there ? 
 Hello , how can I help you today ? 
 OK , please fill in a Deposit Slip . All you need to do is to write the amount here and your name over here , on this line . I'll take care of the rest . First , could I see some ID ? 
 Take care , Peter . Don't run so fast . Are you tired ? 
 No , you mustn't sit on the grass . Don't you see the notes ? 
 It says ' Keep off the grass ! ' 
 Be careful . You can't smoke here . 
 Can't you see the notes there ? It says ' No smoking here ' . 
 Yes , I ’ m doing some research on Roman civilization . Do you have any books on the subject ? 
 Can I check this one out ? 
 Ok . And I ’ d like to check these books out . 
 Thanks for your help . 
 I'd like to have a look at your air conditioners . Hum , this one looks pretty good . 
 And what about your customer service ? 
 How long is the warranty ? 
 Very good . I ’ ll take it . 
 Mrs . Smith has not checked in yet . 
 Yes , I'll see that she get the message when she checks in . 
 Good morning , Miss Bell ! 
 Nice to see you too . It's been a long time . 
 Just fine , and you ? 
 Did you drive yourself to the airport ? 
 Did someone meet you at the airport here ? 
 Is this where we'll be holding the meeting ? 
 Nice to see you , Patrick . 
 Yeah . All of us tried our best . 
 I've just visited your showroom . You surely get a lot of fancy bedsheets . I like them very much . 
 20 is very colorful and feels nice . I'd like to start with it . Is it pure silk ? 
 Thank you for saying that . But what's the unit price ? 
 The price seems acceptable . Can you supply the bedsheets now if we order some ? 
 That's fine . Then let's sign a contract . 
 The radio said it's OK on this road . 
 We have too many cars ! 
 Where will you go , sir ? 
 OK , it's not far from here . 
 Sure , I'll try my best . Here we are . 
 The reading on the meter is 15 yuan . 
 Thank you very much . 
 I'd like a coke . 
 Okay . 
 Red . 
 Ugh , I feel terrible . I went out last night with Trevor , and things got a little out of hand . 
 We hit a couple of local bars , and met up with some friends . Everything was cool until Mike came along , and it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday ! 
 Tell me about it ! We drank everything in the bar ! 
 Yeah . I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous . I threw up like five times . 
 I was so dehydrated that I drank like a gallon of water , and my head has been pounding all day . I swear , I ’ m never gonna drink again ! 
 Oh , yeah . I ’ m there ! 
 You can go to ZhongShan Park . 
 Yes . The scenery there is so breathtaking 
 Yes , of course . It's really worth visiting . 
 Here . Are you all right ? 
 I don't have an aspirin . Perhaps you should go to a doctor . 
 Really , John . I still think you should go to a doctor . You've been sneezing ever since you entered the office this morning . Why don't you take this afternoon off ? If you don't want to see a doctor , at least you can go home and have a good rest . 
 You didn't do anything but sneeze this morning , and you can't do anything this afternoon like this . Gee ! You've got a fever . 
 Listen to me . You go home now . I will call my doctor and have him go over . Ok ? 
 I'll handle him . Now go home . I'll call you after work . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 OK . This way , please . 
 We've particularly busy on Sunday . Please sit here . How do you wish it cut ? 
 It's a long time since you had a haircut last time , isn't it ? 
 How long ago ? 
 Hello ? 
 Not yet . 
 I ’ d like to , but I can ’ t . 
 I ’ Ve a lot of paper work to do right now . I ’ m behind schedule . 
 Sure , thanks . 
 Bye . 
 I started to date someone recently , but it didn't work out . 
 Well ... that's a long story . 
 I'd like to start at 3000 yuan a month . 
 Does it include bonuses ? 
 Very good . 
 Uh ... Andrew . Hello . I can't quite remember you . 
 Um ... we never were . We're just friends . 
 ... I am seeing someone . This is Yi-jun , my ... 
 We can inform the department in charge and ask for revocation of passport . 
 We need a detention warrant . 
 Nice to meet you . How can I help you ? 
 Certainly , Mr . Murphy . Could you come to my office this afternoon at 2:30 ? 
 I'm glad you appreciate our folk music . But a live performance is much more interesting . 
 The show starts at 7 and is over at around 10 o'clock p . m . 
 I'm glad you enjoyed it . It's had long run , but the house has always been full . 
 Personally I liked the main character . He was true to type . 
 When will the campus recruitment of L'Oreal being this year ? 
 It is really early , isn't it ? 
 I'd like to reserve a table for two , please . 
 Around 8: 30 p . m . 
 Yes , Anthony Fox . 
 I'm more worried about snipers . 
 Sniping is when someone makes a bid at the very last minute to steal something for a bargain price . 
 I heard about a software program called turbid . It automatically submits a bid with just a few seconds to go in an auction . 
 Last trip was very terrible . I hope everything will be fine this time . Don ’ t blow it . 
 Charles , have you finished your homework ? 
 I want you to have a walk with me . 
 I am having a hard time at my job . 
 My colleagues quickly get promotions , while I always get sidelined . I don't know what to do anymore . 
 But I don't know what else I can do . I am willing to work hard . Sometimes I make mistakes and the boss is not happy . 
 Tell that to my boss . 
 Yes . 
 He was also assassinated because of his views . 
 Well , if he can become president , then I can at least get a promotion . 
 What can I help you with today ? 
 Do you have your library card ? 
 Would you like to apply for one right now ? 
 I ’ m going to need you to fill out the application . 
 All right , now please sign the back of the card . 
 That ’ s all there is to it . 
 Wait for me 。 
 Dad , how do you say this word ? 
 What does this word mean ? 
 Dad , can you just tell me what it means ? I'm too lazy . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 How long would you like to stay In these cities ? 
 There is a three-day package tour . You will have 3 full days in the cities . It is a general tour of the cities . The itinerary includes the places of interest such as Window of the World , China Folk Culture Village . Chen Clan Academy , Southern Yue Tomb , and Gongbei Market . 
 200 yuan for each person . 
 It includes your air fare , your hotel accommodations and the meals . 
 Yes . we could do that for you . 
 Yes , ma ’ am ? 
 Certainly , ma ’ am . Just take these stairs down to the first floor and turn left . You can ’ t miss it . 
 I went to a movie with my boyfriend . 
 It was great . The director took a lot of care while framing . They say be has good chance at winning the Oscar for best director . Also I like the actors , some really great new young actors . 
 Well , it's the classic love story between two people from conflicting backgrounds . But besides a beautiful story , the cinematography is great . There is some really dramatic footage . It's really quite a visual feast . And the soundtrack is moving . 
 The ending is a bit of a surprise . I don't want to ruin it for you . 
 It would be a really good choice . The movie is very suitable for lovers to see together . I'm sure you won't regret it . 
 Thank you . 
 Certainly . ( He brings her the sauce . ) Here you are . Can I get you anything else ? 
 We ’ re going to the movies . Will you join us ? 
 Why not ? 
 Then would you like to have lunch with us ? 
 Would you like me to give you a lift ? 
 Come on . It ’ s no trouble at all . 
 The stepmother was very wicked . She couldn't stand a happy smile on the boy's face . 
 And she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy . 
 After this lunch , I haven ’ t got much green left . 
 Do you have the time ? 
 What do you do in your spare time ? 
 That sounds interesting . 
 Do you have any hobbies ? 
 What kind of things do you paint ? 
 What kinds of sports do you like ? 
 Good morning , Mr.Black . I am the new secretary . 
 I don't want to make a bad impression . 
 I will . 
 I'll keep that in mind . Does everything on the desk belong to me ? 
 What's the extension number for my phone ? 
 Can I make personal phone calls during my office hours ? 
 I understand . 
 what date is it today ? 
 look at the girls in the street . They all have bunch of flowers.Is it Valentine's Day ? 
 did you have a fight with Jack ? 
 come on , dear ! You forgot it , too . 
 is that your phone ? 
 wow ! good timing . 
 come on ! three's a crowd ! 
 just go ! it's Valentine's Day ! 
 Yes , of course . 
 Sorry , sir , you have to pay in the check-out counter . It's there . 
 What ? What ’ s up ? 
 Fantastic ! I ’ ll be there ! 
 What about it ? 
 The cable is down right now . I am very sorry . 
 It should be back on in the next couple of days . 
 We're going to give you a credit while the cable is down . 
 No , not until your cable comes back on . 
 You're welcome , and I apologize for the inconvenience . 
 Yeah . My whole GPA is screwed up now . 
 Well , I bombed my econ final and ended up with a 1.7 . 
 Well , it's my fault because I didn't study as much as I should have . 
 That's what I plan on doing unless I keep screwing up . How did you do this semester ? 
 My GPA is pretty similar to yours . I have a 3.1 now because of the stupid econ class . 
 I was sitting happy with a 3.4 . 
 Let's just say I screwed up more than my econ class . 
 I started playing starcraft and ended up wasting a lot of time . 
 You're right . I'm not going to play games during school anymore . 
 You should send him to the boarding school . He need a strict teacher . 
 Ladies and gentlemen , our flight will be delayed for one hour due to the congestion of the airport . 
 We'll be delayed for one hour , because the airport is very crowded . 
 Oh , will you ? That's too bad.We ' re very sorry to cause you a lot of trouble . 
 Don't you think it's nice out ? 
 I think that it's going to rain . 
 You like the rain ? 
 I understand . Rain does make it smell cleaner . 
 How come ? 
 I would love for it to rain today . 
 I've just been a little depressed lately . 
 Nothing really . 
 Welcome to the International Business Department . How can I help you ? 
 No problem , I can do that for you right now . Have you checked the documents ? 
 Of course , that's all part of the service . 
 Don't worry ; I'm sure it will be fine . If I do have any queries I'll call you , OK ? 
 If I understand the terms correctly , the length of the contract would be one year with a one-year option . Is that correct ? 
 I was under the impression that both contracts had the same terms . 
 Could you elaborate on that ? 
 Let me see if I have that right . This contract is for six months of training , but if it isn't cancelled , continues for another six months . Is that right ? 
 Okay , that's clear enough . Let's move on to the other terms . 
 Yes . Can I help you ? 
 Of course I remember you . 
 Oh , no . Really ? I didn't see anything . 
 No , I didn't . Would you like to go look by the table with me ? 
 No . It's been empty the whole time . 
 I remember , sir , that your friend took the bill.You didn't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ? 
 Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ? 
 Maybe you lost it before you came here . Or maybe you left it at home . 
 Well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home.Then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . Next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that . 
 You can if you want . But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets . 
 I'm sorry we couldn't find it , sir . 
 The hotel is full tonight . we will need to find a new place to stay . 
 How did you do in the last quiz ? 
 Don't be so worried , You know Professor Robert is not too strict . 
 I hope you'll do better in the final . 
 So Emily , what do you like to do for fun ? 
 I also like going to the movies . 
 I was inquiring about a bill that I never got . 
 The bill was for my Master Card . 
 It never came in the mail . 
 I have not gotten my bill , so what should I do about that ? 
 If it is the post office's fault , may I have an extension on my bill ? 
 Thank you for all your help . 
 Nice to meet you . 
 You are a graduate , right ? 
 So you don't have much related work experience . 
 Well , did you get any honors or rewards in college ? 
 What about your computer skills ? 
 And anything else ? 
 I see . 
 Tom's dating your sister . 
 This is 911 . 
 Slow down and tell me your address . 
 An ambulance is on its way right now . They should be there any minute . Are you close to him right now ? 
 Is he breathing ? 
 Can I go to my room now ? 
 Thank you . 
 So no more regret now ? 
 Come on . Don't be so hard on yourself . Enjoy your life . 
 It's only seven minutes into the game , too early to cheer up . 
 Who knows ! It's a long game . Look ! That was a really nice shot ! 
 Wait , that guy , I know him . He is just a bench warmer . 
 Clive is ready to explode . Keep your eyes open . 
 Good that he resembled his old , quick self . 
 Yes . So what else to do now ? 
 I see . How do you like the game ? 
 Who do you think do better ? 
 Exactly . He is unbelievable . 
 They were really tough . 
 I can't agree more . Okay , time is up . Let's do the last thing . 
 You could get him a tie . 
 Why not ? 
 Well , you can buy him a pet iguana then . 
 He would think you were crazy , Caroline . 
 How much do you want to spend ? 
 Alright , I have an idea.You know he carries that conservative-looking briefcase every day . 
 Well , he isn't a lawyer , so I don't think he needs to have a briefcase like that . 
 I think he would appreciate having a very fine leather bag.But more like a workbag or shoulder bag.You know , not so hard and square like a briefcase . 
 I don't think this mall has a leather goods store.So we have to go to State Street . 
 We can buy something for Mom and Dad here , and then go buy Uncle Teddy's gift on State Street . 
 She said she wants one of those automatic foot massagers . I think they sell them at Sears . 
 How about the iguana ? 
 A tie ? 
 I was just kidding . 
 Yes , I would like to schedule an appointment for you to come in and talk with me . 
 No , sometimes the test results aren ’ t clear and we need to do more to get a clearer picture . 
 I would if I knew anything for sure , but I want to take a second look . 
 You can come in this afternoon . If you would feel better , bring your husband with you . 
 Just relax . We will talk about it this afternoon . 
 I don't think that there is any easy way . The United Nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . 
 It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it's harder to make peace between countries . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 When do you need them , sir ? 
 No problem . Do you want 3 x 5 or 4 x 6 ? 
 And do you want the glossy or matted finish ? 
 You pay when you pick them up . I don't need a deposit for just one roll of film . 
 I am so glad I caught you at home . I need your help ! 
 Cafe au lait , cafe latte , cappuccino , cafe mocha ... I can't keep them all straight ! 
 It's about a girl . No , an angel ! I'm going to the coffee shop where she works right now . 
 How do you do ? Mr . Barker . 
 Oh , Parker with a P ? 
 Er ... I ’ m Barker . 
 Yes , with a B . 
 Thank you , Mr . Parker . 
 I'm working on my resume . 
 Yeah , I just got some good information off the internet . 
 I didn ’ t just find out about one job . There were several ones that looked good . 
 Sure you have to be patient . But I think it ’ s much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls . 
 How do you know if you don ’ t have a try ? 
 I'm looking for someone who works here , but I lost his business card . His name's Long or Sang or something like that . 
 Yeah , that sounds right . 
 Let me think ... accounting , finance , something like that . 
 That's him ! 
 I appreciate your help . 
 Here's my card . 
 What are my choices for lunch ? 
 Fish with noodles , please . 
 Coffee , please . 
 Oh , wonderful ! You speak English ! I need to exchange this foreign currency . 
 It's Traveller's Cheques , is that possible ? 
 Yes , right , certainly . Here you go . 
 The work is rather hard , but it's interesting . 
 I work in a publishing house . How about you ? 
 What do you do then ? 
 As an experienced interviewer , could you tell me what kind of behavior the interviewer hates most ? 
 And we should have good sitting posture . 
 Where should I put my overcoat and briefcase after entering the office ? 
 I think that ’ s the reason why Princess Diana ’ s hair style became so popular . 
 I ought to respect other people ’ s privacy , as most Westerners do . 
 the bathroom looks lovely . Did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ? 
 so , let ’ s see . You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . You ’ Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . The bath , shower and waterbasin are the sam 
 how long did it take you to do the tiling . 
 I think you ’ Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ? 
 Excuse me ! Do you know of any hotel nearby ? 
 OK , I see . Thank you ! 
 I see , thank you very much ! 
 I went first last time . 
 Oh , Okay . 
 Yes , speaking.May I help you ? 
 That's too bad.What kind of accident is it ? Are you all right ? 
 OK . I'll do it right away , but tell me how it happened . 
 Are you doing the football pools , Brian ? 
 You always say that , but we never win anything ! What will you do if you win a lot of money ? 
 I don ’ t want a mink coat ! I want to see the world . 
 But if we spend all that money we shall be poor again . What will we do then ? 
 It ’ s a pleasant dream , but everything depends on if ! 
 Sure , no problem . Asking for leave again ? You have been absent from class five times this semester . 
 I agree that Miss Li doesn't teach so well . Most students either sleep or do other things in her class . 
 Fortunately her class is just an elective course , not as important as compulsory courses . 
 But isn't it too impolite to be absent ? 
 Oh , I thought you just gave an excuse on this note . 
 Yeah , besides , your credit will be deducted . That is kind of serious . 
 You can't write with one hand and draw with the other . 
 You can count on me . 
 Speaking . 
 Hi , Rose . How ’ s everything ? 
 Sounds good . What time do you want me to come ? 
 It seems to me that you fall for good-looking guys . 
 Why don't you date up a handsome guy and spend time together ? 
 You must have a lot in common and a barrel of fun . 
 Mr.Chen , do you mind if I smoke ? 
 You don't look well at all . Are you sick ? 
 How long have you been feeling like this ? 
 How did you feel at the very beginning ? 
 I see . You've caught a bad cold . I'll give you a prescription . 
 How do you spend your spare time ? Are you interested in sports ? 
 Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ? 
 What can I do to help you ? 
 I could do some typing for you . 
 Sure I will get to do that right now . 
 I have worked here long time . 
 I'm not sure . Let me think about it . 
 Well , I'm afraid I must be going now . I have no idea it was so late . 
 I'm afraid I can't . I have a dinner party at seven tonight . You see , I am going to England the day after tomorrow . 
 It has been a pleasure . Goodbye . 
 Are there any interesting stories in the newspaper today ? 
 Was it caused accidentally or naturally ? Sometimes it gets so hot that fires begin naturally in Australia and Africa . 
 What is the international community doing to help ? 
 How many countries have been affected ? 
 I saw on the tv yesterday that there has been another earthquake in iran . 
 Does the newspaper say anything about casualties ? 
 Are you being served , madam ? 
 Yes , what size is in your mind ? 
 Any particular brand ? 
 How about this one ? It ’ s the latest design , simple but elegant . 
 $ 100 . 
 How much would you say ? 
 Well , I am a regular member of this club . 
 Yes , membership fees vary depending on the club but usually they run into tens of thousands of dollars . 
 Very few , unfortunately . 
 Extremely good . I shot a 78 , including 5 birdies ! 
 Ten . How did your game go ? 
 Maybe you can correct it by going to a driving range before you play again . 
 I listen to music and read . 
 I think I like classical music better . 
 I like NBA very much . 
 No , I didn't . 
 Do you like NBA ? 
 Who do you like best of the NBA players ? 
 So do I . 
 That's fine . 
 Really ? What about your opinion , Daniel ? 
 Oh , it is my cell phone ringing . I set it in the vibration mode . 
 You are right . Some ring tone is just terribly loud . You can hear it even in the next door . It is really a kind of distraction . 
 Good idea . 
 Of course not . 
 Yes . I gave her my resignation a few days ago . 
 Yes , I think she will . 
 Well , there are several reasons . I don't think my present job is suitable for me . That's the first reason . Secondly , your company has a good reputation . I think it can offer me more challenging opportunities . Last , frankly speaking , I wish to get higher pay . 
 Yes . It's a Korea company and it was built in Beijing five years ago . 
 We are practically full up , but I will see . What do you want , a single room or a double one ? 
 How long do you plan to stay ? 
 You can have a room on the second floor . 
 I think you will find it quiet . It faces the courtyard . 
 The current rate is 50 dollars per night . 
 A radio , a color television , a telephone and a major international newspaper delivered to your room everyday . 
 Yes , we give 5 % discount for one week , 10 % for two weeks and more . 
 Will you fill out this form , please ? The bellboy will show you up to your room . Your luggage will be brought right up . 
 We do serve dinner . 
 Waiter , bring me the menu , will you ? 
 I'd like to see the menu . Would you get me one , please ? 
 Thank you . Ah ! But this is in French . Would you mind giving me the English menu ? 
 Thanks . I'll need a while to choose . Could you come back in a minute ? 
 I'm sorry , I haven't decided yet . Do you mind giving me a couple of minutes ? 
 We are willing to participate in the bid which you advertised in China Daily . Would you please tell me the detail of the tender conditions ? 
 OK ! Our company is very interested in the tender . I am sure that we will do our best to win the bidding in building the factory . 
 Maybe I have asking too many questions today . 
 Fine , thanks a lot . Bye ! 
 Can we talk ? 
 I ’ m not too clear on some things about my lease . 
 How many years is my lease for ? 
 Can I move out before those three years ? 
 Why would you keep it ? 
 I get it now . 
 Good morning , sir . Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Sure . How do you like your suit ? 
 Pasadena Traffic School . How can I help you ? 
 What classes did you want to sign up for ? 
 You'll have to make an appointment . 
 You need an appointment so you can sign the papers . 
 When are you available ? 
 I can schedule you for that day and time . 
 Good morning , how are you doing today ? 
 So , I can see by your chart that you are here for your annual physical . 
 We are basically going to check your heart , lungs , blood sugar levels , and eyes , ears , and nose . 
 Yes , I will check you for asthma , and maybe we can check you for allergies later . 
 We will be checking for blood sugar , cholesterol , and white blood cell count . 
 Hello , do you know anywhere that sells cheap cashmere sweaters ? 
 What a splendid idea ! 
 Thanks for helping me . 
 So Jen , what did you think of William ? Did you guys have a nice time on your first date ? 
 You said all that on the first date ? Alright ... Well are you two going out again ? 
 more and more Chinese are marrying foreigners . 
 oh , why ? 
 I wouldn't say that's totally true . I've met many happy intercultural couples . 
 I guess it's because the Chinese women are more attractive to Western men . 
 what do you mean ? 
 a left girl ? What's that ? 
 you have a point here , but I believe some mixed marriages are based on true love . 
 Good morning , sir , can I help you ? 
 I'd be glad to , sir . But may I ask what line of business you are in ? 
 I see . Would you be interested in seeing the audio-visual products ? They are made by our company . 
 Yes , of course . Would you like to make an inspection tour of some factories ? 
 I'll make the arrangement and let you know the time tomorrow . 
 Could you change this note for me , please ? 
 Eight tens , six ones and large silver for others . 
 Thanks . 
 I wish the teacher wouldn't make us read this book . 
 David , I heard you lost your job . 
 Well , that'll teach you to control your temper . 
 Please wait a moment .. I am sorry right now there is no vacant seat . I have to ask . 
 By the way , hold your bag in case you vomit . 
 Sorry . I'll clean it up . 
 You too . Have you lost some weight ? 
 Not some crazy diet fat I hope . 
 Good for you , keep it up . 
 Cool ! They're big ! What have you got in there ? 
 Are you planning a trip to the Outback ? 
 Well , my pants are very slimming . They're capris . 
 I wouldn ’ t miss it for the world ! It ’ s sure to be fun . She ’ s invited a lot of people . Do you think everyone will be able to get into her house ? 
 Are you taking anything ? 
 That ’ s a good idea . She told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . I think it ’ s going to be a noisy party . I hope her neighbors don ’ t mind too much . 
 I ’ m really looking forward to it . This party is going to be a blast ! 
 Hello . Can I talk to Miss Li , please ? 
 Miss Li . Li Lin .

 Sure . 
 It's 423-6681 . Isn't it right ? 
 I'm sorry to have bothered you . 
 We're sorry , but we cannot allow your claim . 
 The material was not damaged by us . 
 Hello . I bought a China dress in your shop this morning . 
 I bought it one size up by mistake . 
 I wonder if you can change it to one size down . 
 Then I'll come to your place later in the evening , and how late is your shop open ? 
 Mike's Mechanics . Can I help you ? 
 Go straight up Zhongshan Road and you will see our sign on your right , after you pass the museum . 
 Did I do well on my driving test ? 
 So , I passed ? 
 Did I mess up on anything ? 
 What was that ? 
 Yeah , that's pretty hard for me . 
 I know , but I still get my license , right ? 
 Do you like this dress , madam ? 
 What about this one ? It's a lovely dress . It's very smart . Short skirts are in fashion now . Would you like to try it ? 
 I'm afraid I haven't got a larger dress . This is the largest dress in the shop . 
 Thanks . I just got back from summer camp . 
 Great . I got to try so many things for the first time . 
 I went sailing , fishing , and horseback riding . 
 The counselors were so nice too . It was the best summer ever . Except for all those mosquitoes ! 
 Yes , I want to book a plane ticket from Beijing to Shanghai . 
 The day after tomorrow . 
 I'd prefer a morning flight . 
 Book it for me , please . How much should I pay ? 
 Credit card . 
 Thank you . 
 That's because Americans love sitcoms . 
 Situation comedies . A sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly . Sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people . If there is one thing that all the shows have in common , it is teaching wholesome values . 
 I think Americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time . 
 Hi . We'd like to open a Foreign Currency Account , please . 
 Yes , yes , we do . Right here . 
 We will go for the US dollar account . 
 Herman , why are you so excited ?

 My friend Jane is very beautiful . 
 Perfect . And I like her charming eyes , too .

 We'd prefer separate checks . 
 Hello , ABC Company . Can I help you ? 
 Can you name some courses you completed ? 
 Do you have wool socks ? 
 Can you guarantee the quality ? 
 Where are the panty-hose ? 
 Hi , Mary , I didn't see you at work this morning . Are you all right ? 
 Oh , I'm so sorry to hear that . Have you seen a doctor or taken any medicines ? 
 Are you feeling better ? 
 Do you need anything , grocery ? 
 Sure , I'll get it for you.Books or magazines ? 
 This blouse is a special offer today . You can have it at 10 % off the regular price . 
 No . 10 % is my last word . 
 I am starving . 
 Is there somewhere you wanted to go eat at ? 
 I haven't eaten there before . 
 What kind of food do they serve ? 
 I have a taste for Chinese food . 
 Okay , let's go to the cafeteria . 
 Do you know Sally ? 
 Why is she still single ? She must have a face that would stop clock . 
 Can I talk to you for a moment , manager ? 
 I've decided to leave . 
 I've worked here for two years . And I want to do something different . 
 I want to live abroad and learn to speak a different language . 
 Thank you , manager . 
 We look forward to a further extension of our pleasant business relations . 
 That will be good . 
 That's a wonderful choice . 
 January is a little too close to the Christmas holidays . 
 I think that April would work . Spring is a lovely time to be in the mountains . 
 Maybe if we asked around we could see what people would prefer . 
 I'll take care of taking the survey and get back to you with the answers . 
 Not particularly . I like fat girls . 
 I can ’ t say I do . What I like a girl with good manners . 
 Yes . But I like a girl with a nice personality . 
 Not particularly . I like a girl to be good . 
 Are you still working ? 
 If you got laid off or are working a lot fewer hours , you may qualify . 
 Not all jobs pay into unemployment insurance , so their employees cannot collect benefits . 
 You should have noticed unemployment insurance being deducted from your paycheck . Check your pay stubs . 
 The more money you made , the more you will earn on unemployment . They have a formula . 
 It is . What can I do for you ? 
 Would that be a Fixed Deposit or a Current Deposit ? 
 We have various different types of Current Deposit , the Variable Term Deposit , a Notice Deposit and the Usual Current Deposit . Which would you like ? 
 OK , just a moment . I'll find the relevant data and help you with that . 
 Can you take he away from me ? 
 She kept on bothering me . 
 But I am her brother , not her servant . 
 The same as usual . 
 She's my grandma . 
 92 . 
 Oh really ? Is he all right ? 
 Poor old John ! I am ever so sorry . 
 Of course I know . 
 OK . I'll go right now . By the way , do you think I ’ ll have to stay in the hospital for long ? 
 Thank you , Doctor . I will go now . Bye-bye . 
 Hi , the lab said that you would be getting my test results in today . 
 I think that this is a bad sign . 
 Why wouldn ’ t you tell me over the phone ? 
 I need to come in right away . 
 You are scaring me ! 
 This man looks very handsome.Is he married ? 
 Oh , I can't believe it.He looks very young . 
 I see . 
 Actually , I prefer if you didn't . Air conditioning makes me sneeze . 
 Oh , sure . It's very stuffy in here . 
 Yes . We are a foreign-invested company and there are many chances to go abroad . 
 Sure . We attach great importance to the all-round development of the staff , and the development of individuals will motivate them to work more diligently and efficiently . 
 Can I get you another blanket ? 
 I'll turn the heat up . 
 Won't you have some of this ? 
 It's my grandmother's favorite recipe for barbecue . 
 I use a special dressing and homemade catsup . 
 I'm glad you like it . 
 Oh , but Chinese food is so delicious . I wish I knew how to cook Chinese food . Do you follow recipes ? 
 I always use a recipe but my grandmother never did . She was a great cook . She would make clam chowder and cornbread every Sunday night . 
 Let's stop the car and enjoy it for a minute . 
 Wow . We don't get to see this in the city ! 
 Look behind us at the mountains ! They're reflecting pink ! 
 Where is our camera ? Let's see if we can catch this on film ! 
 I quarreled with my roommate last night . He is really stubborn . 
 He is really outrageous . 
 I went back home last night . You know tired as a dog , so I took a quick shower and went to bed . I couldn't fall asleep , because Brian was there in the living room , playing his stupid stereo so loud . I kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . He shouted at me . 
 Well , he did it anyway . Then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah ... you know . 
 I shouted it back of course . 
 What would you do if you were in my shoes ? 
 No way , Kate . I mean it's just not my fault . 
 I am too angry to do that . 
 You know that I have no secrets toward you . 
 Why asking that ? It's often the sort of Dutch treat . 
 Here you are . 
 An aisle seat , please . 
 It ’ me . Susan Taylor 
 On , what ’ re you doing ? You look as busy as a bee . 
 Really , that ’ s cool . Let me see what you ’ Ve done . 
 That ’ s all right . Let me see , oh , that lace looks so unique , and it ’ s so creative to make a picture display here . How did you get that idea ? 
 Hello , james . Come in . go through to the living room . 
 I told you that I had been saving up money to buy some new furniture and do some redecorating . I finally saved enough and did everything at once . 
 Do you like my carpet ? Be honest ! Tell me what you really think . 
 Well spotted ! I actually had it cleaned twice , because it was so dirty . The rug is new . You remember my trip to china ? Well , I bought is there . 
 Sure.It ' s just right . 
 No ! It's a perfect fit ! 
 About David , No , I didn ’ t hear anything . 
 Sorry , I don ’ t quite follow you . 
 Oh , that is a shame . He is really hard working . 
 The chicken tastes wonderful , but it is kind of dry . Is your fish OK ? 
 It seems as if they got busy and left it sitting before it got to us . 
 Are your vegetables a little mushy ? 
 Mine aren't so good , either . 
 I think that we should let someone know . They will probably want to fix the problem . 
 We ’ ll have them worked out by this evening and let you have them tomorrow morning . Would you be free to come by then ? 
 Perfect . Our offer remains open for 3 days . 
 I ’ m sure you ’ ll find our price most favorable . Elsewhere prices for hardware have gone up tremendously in recent years . Our prices haven ’ t changed much . 
 We shall be very pleased . Is there anything else I can do for you , Mrs . Anderson ? 
 Certainly , I ’ ll make an appointment for you with Mr . Jordan of the Egypt National Native Produce and Animal By-products Import and Export Corporation . 
 Is the lake very polluted ? 
 Are local factories allowed to discharge waste water into the lake ? 
 Hi , Steven , take a seat ! How are things at work ? 
 Can you finish it on time ? 
 OK , I will send Beker to help you . We need to get the brochures done and sent them to our clients on Friday without delay . 
 Do you have any certificates on computer ? 
 How did you get it ? 
 Good morning . What seems to be the problem ? 
 I ’ d say you ’ Ve been working too hard or are under stress for some reason . Have you been taking anything for your cold ? 
 Good . I ’ m going to prescribe something stronger . It will make you feel drowsy , so you certainly should rest . 
 Have you been working hard recently ? 
 Good . Let ’ s take a look at that rash ... it looks worse than it is . I ’ m going to prescribe some ointment for it . If the rash doesn ’ t clear up in a few days , come back and see me . Do you have any other symptoms ? 
 Don ’ t worry about that . It ’ s probably of the stress you ’ Ve been under . Just take some aspirin . Combined with the stronger cough medicine , it will make you feel very tired . You shouldn ’ t work or use any equipment which requires concentration . If I were you , I ’ d just sleep , read a book , or watch TV . Here is your prescription . 
 How much is the rent ? 
 And how much is the deposit ? 
 Excuse me , can you do me a favor ? 
 Where's the busiest street of this city ? I am a stranger here . 
 Well , we are so tired today . Can you tell me which bus I should take ? 
 Thank you so much . 
 Yes , I am sure I can . 
 Yes , I think I am quite proficient in both written and spoken English .

 He certainly is . He is the Peckham in our collage . 
 I need help . I think my arm is broken . 
 No , I haven't . I need help quick . It hurts really badly . 
 Let me see a doctor . 
 I thought this was the emergency room . 
 No . Only a little . I fell off my porch . 
 My left arm . 
 No , I can't . I'm left-handed . 
 Yes . But why do I have to fill out a form anyway ? This is the emergency room . 
 No . Just let me see a doctor . I'm worried about my arm . 
 Steve Schliessman . S C H L I E S S M A N .

 No , I don't . 
 Can I sit down now ? 
 Hi ! Tom . Want to go to play bowling tonight ? 
 Let me see . How about 6:30 at the gate of the club ? 
 Good morning , Miss . 
 On the left of the elevator of the 3rd floor . 
 I ’ m sure you can find your favorite there . 
 It ’ s my honor . 
 That means they have tapered legs . 
 Mine are , too . 
 Yeah . Let's just lounge around ! 
 Quite good . Excuse me , are there any places of interest ? 
 Thank you . I think today we will go there . 
 So did I . At first , I thought it was going to be boring , but then it turned to be good . 
 Well , the scene of the hero's struggle with enemies impressed me the most . 
 Actually , tears also came to my eyes . 
 It deserves it . The film gave us a lot of inspiration . 
 I hear that his father died . 
 He is out of luck . 
 Oh , they're fine , still very active and enjoying their retirement . 
 Sure , thank you . 
 I don't have any money to buy you a burrito . 
 Look , I only have money to buy myself a burrito . 
 If you're so hungry , why don't you ask someone else for money ? 
 Well , I guess on Friday , then you can eat . 
 Why don't you just go home and eat ? 
 Well , I guess you're out of luck . 
 Don't you know that ? It's panda . 
 OK , then put on your glasses , and do you know what does the panda eat ? 
 That's right . 
 You sound quite knowledgeable . 
 Actually , it likes milk too . 
 Do you know other famous animals in the world ? 
 That's right . OK , let's move on . 
 Here is my passport . And this is the declaration form . 
 Business . I have a trade convention I'm attending in Chicago . 
 No . I will fly back twelve days from now . 
 Yes , I want to spend a couple days in New York . I have friends there I will visit . 
 Just my cameras , my clothes , and some books . 
 No . 
 Alright . 
 Thank you . Good afternoon Mrs . Smith , Miss Duncan , Miss Lamb . 
 Thank you . 
 I don't like the weather like this . Cold and rainy . Hope it become sunny as soon as possible . 
 I am not sure . I don't know that many restaurants around here . 
 Good . Let's take a look ! 
 I enjoy Thai or Japanese the best . 
 Oh yes , I've heard of that one . Everyone I've spoken with says that it is great ! 
 I think that that would be a really good choice ! Let's call and make a reservation . 
 It will be fine . 
 No , don't give it another thought . 
 I booked a table yesterday . 
 Smith . 
 I feel pity for the old man . 
 It must be dreadful to grow old . 
 Believe it or not , tea is the most popular beverage in the world after water . 
 Right . And China is the homeland of tea . 
 Do you know there are several catagories of Chinese tea ? 
 Well , have you ever heard of Oulong tea and compressed tea ? 
 You surely know a lot about Chinese tea . 
 Oh , so do I . 
 Great . We can chat while enjoying a cup there . 
 Hello , room service . Can I help you ? 
 We are sorry for the delay , ma ’ am . Could you hold the line , please ? I ’ ll check your order .

 Where is it ? 
 How many rooms are there ? 
 How much is it ? 
 OK . How much is the deposit ? 
 Welcome home , Peter ! 
 So , how was your trip to Thailand ? 
 I'm having a hard time getting the information . 
 Oh , I didn't think of that . 
 I can ’ t wait to vote . 
 The person I ’ m voting for is the best . 
 He is very intelligent . 
 That ’ s right . Plus , I agree with his policies . 
 I ’ m voting for the next President . 
 I ’ m going to make sure and vote . 
 Yes , I do . 
 But I can't sing it well . 
 OK , I'Il go with you . When shall we go ? 
 It's too early . Let's make it seven , OK ? 
 Fill it up with premium , please . 
 No , that's OK . How much do I owe you ? 
 Take a seat inside and see what you think.So you will take the Porsche then , sir ? 
 You're smart to buy it . At 45 dollars for three days , it is a good deal . 
 San Francisco ? No , sir.We only have this office here . You will have to return it here . 
 No , sir . That's only with the very big companies . I'm sorry , but this car must be returned to this lot . 
 Do you still want the car , sir ? 
 It's a beautiful drive . 
 Just a moment , sir . We have to finish filling out the forms . 
 Thanks so much . Miss , I believe I ordered my eggs scrambled , and these are fried .

 Sure , what's the postcode of Shanghai ?

 Ten kg ! Dear Shirley must have put a lead ball in it ! 
 I want a new brand image . Something creative , something strong . Make no mistake , something with ... resolve ! 
 Let's meet on Friday to discuss your progress . Give me your e-mail address ... umm , I mean addresses ... We'll be in touch . 
 Yes , I am . 
 I'm going to be a clerk . 
 He works in an office . He writes letters and reports , and he types . 
 A-what ? 
 Good gracious ! What's that ? 
 I once read a story about a person who talked to animals . It was very interesting . 
 How much is a stamp to send a letter to France , please ? 
 Air mail , please . 
 Four stamps , please . How much is that ? 
 There you go . 
 You'll need to make an appointment . 
 What day would you like us to do the installation ? 
 We're only available at 3 
 I'm sorry . That's the only available time . 
 Yes . Anytime on Saturday will be fine . 
 We can do it . See you then . 
 I want to effect payment under an L / C today . 
 That seems alright . What's the exchange rate like today ? Good or bad ? 
 Have the owners come up with a counter-offer to my offer to buy their home yet ? 
 Should I accept their offer ? 
 What if I make another offer , and they don ’ t accept it ? 
 I think that I would like to offer three hundred and thirty thousand dollars as a counter-offer . 
 How long before I find out what their decision is ? 
 Our productivity has been down for more than six months now . I'm seriously considering pulling in an outside consultant to diagnose the cause of our problematic areas . I think we'd all benefit from an outsider's perspective . Sometimes we're just too closed to the problems to see the forest for the trees . 
 Do you have his card ? What's in his portfolio ? Which firm has he worked for in the past ? 
 Dad , why are you taping the windows ? 
 Really ? Wow , I don't have to go to school tomorrow . 
 OK . Dad ! I'm coming . 
 We have lots of fresh red roses . 
 $ 20 a dozen . 
 Yes , you came here on the right day . They're on sale today . 
 Very good . Would you like anything else ? 
 She should be very pleased with these roses . 
 0kay . Dinner's on me . 
 Why do you say so ? Everyone admires that you have a good wife . 
 But now you are rich . 
 This is ordinary marriage life . 
 Oh , no . I forgot . 
 What time does the recycle truck come by ? 
 I'll just take it out to the street tomorrow morning . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Do you think I'll forget to do it ? 
 Okay , I'll take it out front right now . 
 Hello , Mr . Henderson what can I do for you ? 
 OK , I can have it ready by the end of the week . 
 OK , I can have it ready tomorrow afternoon , but this suit is also very stained . I can ’ t guarantee we can remove it completely . 
 Certainly . 
 I have a stomachache . 
 All right . I'll do that . 
 I ’ m going to down town . 
 My boy wants me to buy a toy , so I think I ’ d better satisfy him . 
 There is none now because he likes to destroy toys . 
 Yes , I am annoyed by this , too . 
 Yes , I think so . 
 Hello miss . Can I see your ticket number ? 
 Thank you miss ... Wang . I'm Bob Jones and I'll be handling your application . 
 The first step is to determine your eligibility for a U . S . visa . Let's see here ... you're applying for a special business visa . Why is that ? 
 I think a regular visitor's visa should suffice . With this visa , you can stay in the United States for up to 90 days . 
 Yes . You are free to do temporary business with this visa . If you were planning on setting up a new business in the U . S . you might need to apply for a long-term visa . 
 Benter's Books . 
 We have several hundred in stock . 
 Did you ever get a parking ticket ? 
 Yeah , I just got one the other day . 
 The ticket was for parking in the red zone . 
 There was nowhere to park , and I needed to run in and get something . 
 I parked in front of my apartment building . 
 But I really needed to be quick . 
 Isabelle , you know I'm not interested in fame . 
 You know I'm interested in teaching . I'm looking for jazz students ... 
 I know they're out there . I'll find them . 
 Susan ? What brings you here today ? 
 Really ? So what ’ s the news ? 
 What would you like to eat , sir ? 
 Would you care for some lemon for your tea ? 
 Are you married ? 
 How long have you been married ? 
 How many people are there in your family ? 
 Who are the members of your family ? 
 Hello . Could you have a taxi pick me up before 10:00 a . m . ? 
 I stay at No . 115 Fucking Road . 
 What are your rates ? 
 I have a lot of luggage . Will those fit in the taxi ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Sorry . No . You need to transfer to a connect flight in the middle . 
 You have to do it . But it takes only about 30 minutes . 
 It has become more time saving . 
 Could you make up this prescription for me , please ? 
 What can I do ? 
 Could I ? 
 Great . I'll take this brand . And how do I take these medicines ? 
 Thank you . 
 Well , we've settled everything in connection with this transaction except the question of the mode of payment . 
 Payment by sight L / C is quite usual in international trade , and as a rule , we only accept payment by sight L / C . 
 Accepting time L / C is unusual and I've never done it before , but we could consider your request . I'll phone our company to see what they say . 
 This afternoon . 
 Don ’ t be kidding , OK ? 
 Because I have given him up as a bad job . Our relation has been over . 
 It ’ s as plain as the nose on your face . They ’ re dating each other . 
 Well , you can bet this relationship ’ s going to be a flash in the pan . 
 I think you are absolutely right . Actually , my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . They got married a month later . 
 Don't you like it ? 
 I think it's a basketball match on channel 5 . 
 Well , I'd rather see a movie . 
 ' Star war ' . 
 Yes , you're right . 
 In summer I go hiking , and in winter I ski . 
 No , not at all . Glad to have you . 
 Not really . To be honest , it's very cheap . I only spent $ 100 . 
 Yes . I bought it in Johnson thrift store . 
 Yes , it is . 
 What ? How could you forget to reserve the concert tickets ? 
 How could you ? I reminded you just this morning . 
 I have been looking forward to this performance all month . 
 I am interested in buying a house and need some information . 
 I am interested in Pasadena or Arcadia . 
 We need a medium-sized house with at least 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms . 
 Yes , we want to stay in the ABC School District . 
 I would love to have a home with a view . 
 There must be something weighing on your mind . What is it ? 
 Don ’ t worry . I'll buy a new necklace as same as the old one . 
 I ’ d like to open a current account . 
 Here your are . I wonder how much interest can I earn for my current account . 
 Why is that ? 
 I see . How do I draw money from my news then . 
 Here you are . 
 The special today is fried chicken , and beef is good too . 
 Well , I'll be back in a minute . 
 It ’ s hard to say.Just so-so . 
 Would you stay for another cup of coffee ? 
 It seems so strange to be here , burying you , but it's not you . 
 This has been the worst and best day of my life , Taylor . They kept you in the hospital , and ... 
 But you're OK ? It was nothing serious , was it ? 
 Excuse me ! 
 We're ready to order . A cup of coffee for me , and a glass of oranges for her . 
 Just black coffee . Do you serve anything else besides drinks , say cake . 
 Give me two pieces of cake . 
 I've been having a hard time sleeping lately . 
 well , I'm really worried about my grades . I didn't think this course would be so stressful . 
 you're probably right . I just wish it were that simple . How can I stop feeling so anxious all the time ? 
 I don't really have time to learn anything new . I need to spend my time studying ! 
 you ’ re right . I usually end up starting at my computer or checking my email instead of doing my work for class . 
 that ’ s fantastic . I ’ m going to go try that out in my room now . good night !

 Let me see . Oh , yes , we have your reservation number . 
 I ’ m sorry to say no . 
 Next , please . May I help you , sir ? 
 Certainly , I can can help you with that . What type of account would you like to open ? A chequing or a savings account ? 
 Well , if you just take a look here , see , with our chequing account , you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee , and our savings account has a higher interest rate , but you must carry a minimum balance of $ 10,000 dollars . 
 Alright , then , with this chequing account you ’ ll be issued a debit card and a cheque book . Will you require overdraft protection ? There is an extra fee for that . 
 In that case , I ’ ll get you to fill out this paperwork . I ’ ll need your social insurance number , and two pieces of government ID . If you could just sign here , and here , and here . we ’ ll be all set . Would you like to make a deposit today ? 
 Excuse me , sir , may I take your order now ?

 Without a doubt . Maybe if he knew he doesn't have to give up any of his old friends to make new ones , it will be easier for him . 
 Well , we can help him keep in touch with his old friends . 
 Yeah . There's a lot we can do to help him through this transition . 
 He said his present job seemed to be a blind alley . 
 Hello , Vicki . 
 Well , you can have it for eleven hundred — as a friend . 
 What ? Seven hundred ? 
 No , one thousand at least . 
 You ’ re a thief , Vicki . But I guess , eight hundred and fifty is all right .

 I would like to book a table for five at 7:00 tonight . 
 Michael . 
 Lin's office supplies . How may I direct your call ? 
 Sure , just a moment . ... I'm sorry no one answer the phone . 
 Certainly ! 
 We cannot avoid being asked questions in the interview . Sometimes , my mind goes blank . 
 Admittedly , you can get prepared in advance for the interview , but you cannot cover everything concerned . 
 Firstly , your answer should go straight to the point , and be clear and brief . 
 Never should you give an answer completely beside the point . 
 Pretending to know when you do not know may expose yourself to ridicule . 
 Try to avoid the possible duplicate answer if you can . 
 What do you think of the lawyer's speech ? 
 Don't believe him . He's liar . 
 It's time to go . Are you ready ? 
 Come on , you must tell me everything about him . 
 Hmm ... 
 Oh , how long ? 
 OK . OK . You'd better tell me what he does . 
 Really ? 
 Fine . 
 I'm hungry . 
 Where should we go eat today ? 
 I never bought food from the cafeteria . 
 What do they have ? 
 Well , I want Chinese food . 
 I guess we can eat there then . 
 It's nice and bright today , isn't it ? 
 How about winter ? 
 It's boring , right ? 
 Do you get much rain during the summer ? 
 So you should bring an umbrella often . 
 Hi , I'm Jake . I'm new to the choir . What's your name ? 
 Do you sing alto ? 
 Looks like we both float back and forth . I'm baritone . 
 I heard them warming up earlier . You're right . 
 Excuse me ! I don't have time to waste . I've been here almost one full hour ! 
 Unbelievable ! Parking in this city is such a nightmare ! 
 Oh , gosh ! I have to go to the restroom so bad ! I can't bear it anymore ! 
 Oh , look ! There's a spot open next to the public restroom ! Can I take it ? 
 No . We broke up last month . I ’ m taking a break from dating for a while . 
 We just decided to stop seeing each other . It was all very amicable . Are you still going out with mike ? 
 Good for you ! Have you seen Kelly recently ? Is she still dating nick ? 
 She was right to do that . I heard the Neil and Tina getting married soon . 
 I think it ’ s 26th September . I ’ ll check and make sure that Tina remembers to invite you to the hen night . 
 He certainly looks interested , doesn ’ t he ? Shall we invite him over to our table ? 
 Morning , Mike . 
 I ’ Ve already got your certificate for sick-leave . How do you feel today ? 
 Have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ? 
 I will explain it in detail in the next class . Could you preview it ? 
 Awful ! My cell phone is out of service again . Fred , can you lend me some money ? 
 200yuan . I bought a computer online , so I have to pay the mortgage . 
 It's so nice of you . You really make my day . 
 What you said is absolutely right . I will pay you back as soon as I get back on my feet . 
 Diana , in your opinion , which is more important , IQ or EQ ? 
 I watched the movie Forrest Gump last night . And the question just lined in my mind . 
 Why ? You seem pretty sure about it . 
 But IQ is decided at birth.One can't expect to make a lot of improvement in it . 
 That ' s true , but what if one comes across some difficulties . He must rely on his EQ to deal with them . 
 I think it is independent of IQ and plays a prominent role in deciding the way we live our lives . 
 Just as Forrest ? 
 I got it . 
 Tsingtao beer ? 
 Really ? 
 How about its taste ? 
 That sounds great . Two Tsingtao beers , please . 
 Tin , please . 
 No , thank you . 
 Mike ! Look at the floor ! 
 What's wrong with it ? It's filthy ! 
 It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes . 
 What are you looking for now ? 
 Well , they ' re not here.They are in the dustbin . 
 Good morning , sir . Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 How about this one ? It's the special local product . 
 Yes . This is a duty-free shop . 
 Thank you.That ' s the result of exercise.By the way , do you work out ? 
 Fine . 
 Well , my mum lost her job yesterday . 
 The supply outstrips the demand in the job market and women are in a disadvantageous position as a whole . 
 Well , she is thinking of doing some household cleaning or baby sitting in the community . 
 Thank you . I just hope she won't feel pressed . 
 Temple fair ? 
 Sounds interesting ! 
 I just can't wait to see them . Which one do you choose today ? 
 Great ! Do you know how to get there ? 
 Couldn't be better . 
 I want to open another account . 
 I would like to open a savings account . 
 I have another savings account open already . 
 I would like to do that . 
 I only want to transfer $ 100 . 
 Great . Thank you very much .

 Chicken ! You're afraid I'll beat you . 
 I called HP about my computer . 
 They said I need a new hard drive . 
 It's not too much , only about $ 85 . 
 No , my hard drive is easy to remove and replace . 
 Yes , it's just a couple of screws . 
 It's a lot better than paying someone $ 60 . 
 Excuse me . Could you please take a picture of us with this camera ? 
 This one . 
 No , this is a focus-free camera . All you have to do is point and press the button . 
 OK , so this is the main factory area . We're now walking past the printing machine . It's printing in four colours at the moment . 
 They're setting up the machine for a new run . 
 About twenty minutes .

 Please make sure to fasten your seat belt . We are to take off . 
 Check out please . 
 Here is the cash.Can you look after my baggage for a while ? 
 OK , thank you . 
 What are you thinking of making ? 
 How about making a teriyaki bowl ? 
 All it consists of is teriyaki beef and white rice . 
 All you have to do is cook some white rice . 
 Then cut up the beef and marinate it in teriyaki sauce . 
 All that's left is to cook it . 
 We are faced with the problem that part of the consignment is unacceptable . We assume that damage occurred during the consignment was in your care .

 What happened ? 
 What are you going to do ?

 How come ? 
 George , is your chicken OK ? 
 My fish is very dry . 
 That's exactly what I was thinking had happened . 
 The vegetables are kind of mushy . 
 The food here is usually good , so I think that we should tell the waiter that there is a problem . 
 Welcome to our hotel's indoor swimming pool . What can I do for you ? 
 You don't need to worry about that . madam . We have a warm massage pool , and the temperature is 36 ° C . 
 Certainly , madam . The deepest place is two meters but you can swim in the shallow area , which is only l . 4 meter in depth . We have separate locker rooms over there and they are free of charge .

 Oh , I see . 
 Take it easy.you ' Ve made enough preparations . 
 I'm sure you'll pass it . 
 yes . He ’ s in hospital with a bad back . One morning , he just couldn ’ t get out of bed.His wife called an ambulance and they took him to hospital . He ’ s been there for a few days now . 
 you have to be very careful with seafood . It tastes lovely , but it often causes upset stomachs . Have you heard anything from tom ? 
 he might be allergic to pollen . My niece is allergic to pollen . It seems like she has a cold , but in fact it ’ s her allergy . 
 it ’ s nice that she ’ s back for a while . Thinking of all these ailments , I got a splinter the other day . It took a long time for me to get it out of my skin . Look .

 I sure did ! 
 I can ’ t disclose that information . 
 My vote is my own private business .

 Really ? 
 Excuse me , Mr . Macmillan ? 
 I was hoping you would write a letter of recommendation . I want to enter a Master ’ s program in marketing . It ’ s all on weekends and evenings .

 I see.After all , he's boss's son . 
 Well , it ’ s really too late . I have to go now . 
 Sorry , I can ’ t.My mother doesn ’ t want me to be late . I really have to go . 
 Thank you for your delicious meal . 
 Uh well ... would you like the bad news first or the really bad news ? 
 Well sir , our sales have dropped , no plunged , fifty percent in the past month alone . We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits refalling fast . The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory , or getting rid of our staff . If we consider redundancies , it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages . It ’ s a real mess . 
 Um ... how can I put this ? Let ’ s just say that at this pace , we will be filing for Chapter eleven in less than three months . 
 Oh , that ’ s the really bad news . Our supplier suffered QC problems and , well , half of our production is faulty . We ’ re going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter . And the worst part ? We ’ re going to have to shoulder this cost . 
 We tried that , sir . The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country . 
 There is some really good news though ! 
 I got offered a new job ! 
 Please forgive me just being frankly , madam . You don't need whitening products because you look pretty white . But you have freckles on your face . 
 I recommend Nisei products . This brand has a face cream which is effective on fading freckles . 
 419 yuan . 
 I'm afraid there isn't . 
 The early bird catches the worm .

 Here's ten pounds . Keep the change . 
 You're welcome , Goodbye ! 
 OK . I am hungry , too . I like their milkshake . They're very creamy and tasty . 
 Yup . But , this also means we have to wait to order our food . 
 Well , sounds very attractive . I just tried their vanilla milkshake last time , and it was really delicious . 
 OK , I think I know what to order for my lunch now . But , eating too much fried food really makes me fat . 
 That's true . You can hear my tummy grumbling . I am really hungry ! 
 Ok !

 Thanks ! 
 I can help you . What location are you looking for ? 
 Have you thought about what your needs are in terms of size ? 
 Is living in a particular school district important to you ? 
 Are you interested in purchasing on the lake , or would you like a home with a view ? 
 Now that I have an idea of what you want , I can begin my search . 
 I think is looks great . I really like the light colors you have chosen . The pictures are nice too . Did you bought any new furniture ? 
 new furniture makes a room seem so fresh . I see that you also bought a new lamp for your bedside table . 
 that wardrobe looks quite big . Is it full of clothes ? 
 I like to get rid of clothes that I don ’ t wear rather than keeping them in a wardrobe . They take up too much space . There are several charity shops that you can give old clothes to . They will be 
 I need to buy some new clothes for the summer too . Perhaps we can go together one day . 
 Did you go to see Michael last night ? 
 Did he let you ride it ? 
 Weren ’ t you frightened ? 
 Would you like to buy a motorcycle yourself ? 
 But why ? Since you like it so much . 
 What is this ? I didn't order that . 
 I've ordered savory pork and coleslaw . 
 Hey ! What is this ? 
 Oh , Is that what this is ? 
 No , don't replace it . Give a refund . 
 Oh , really ? Give me a clam soup . 
 Thank you . 
 Hi Brittany . What are you doing with all of your clothes on your bed ? 
 Oh , A . Mom didn't tell you ? 
 This Bs ' school you're going to is going to make your life easy . 
 Uniforms , sis , no more worrying about appearances ! 
 Why do you want to be a teacher ? 
 Do you know about our school ? 
 ... I knew it . I always knew you were a lesbian ! 
 Haha . Still got that great sense of humor , I see . Here's my card . I sell used cars . A car from us is a car you can trust ! 
 Sweet little lassie . Yep , broke her heart when the D-man told her he couldn't be a one-woman guy . 
 Jimmy , I ’ d like to wear this robe for tonight cocktail party . What do you think of it ? 
 What ? But it is my favorite piece of clothing . 
 What am I going to do ? 
 Hi . I can't get going on my computer until I get a broadband hookup . 
 That would be okay if I had an Ethernet port . Unfortunately , my laptop uses wireless only . 
 Anything to get me up and running . 
 Fantastic ! What do I have to pay per hour ? 
 That's fine . Now tell me about the other alternatives . 
 Great ! I like that suggestion , but what if I need to print something there ? 
 Mr.Wang , we haven't discussed the mode of payment . 
 Do you mean you prefer a deferred payment ? 
 When do you start the payment then ? 
 We can accept that but you have to pay the interest . 
 Shall we sign the agreement now ? 
 Would you show me some table-cloths ? 
 How much is it ? 
 That ’ s reasonable . 
 Really ? I ’ ll take it then . 
 Pardon , where to , sir ? 
 All right . Hop in , please . 
 It usually takes about half an hour . 
 Yes . Moreover , since the street is heavy with traffic this time of day . I'm not sure we can make it . By the way , are you pressed for the time ? 
 OK . 
 Thank you . 
 No . It versa according to the distance , you can read from the meter . 
 I need to pay the fine on my ticket . 
 Yes , I have my ticket with me . 
 I forgot to bring that with me . 
 Why can't I just give you the money for the fine ? 
 Okay , I think I understand . 
 So once I pay this off , my record will be cleared ? 
 What are the requirements that you need to do the job ? 
 I can handle that . I can operate word - processor , fax machine , photostat , and other office equipments . 
 I have a master's degree and I meet all the needs you want , so I am confident of doing this job well . 
 Why ? They are fine . 
 Indeed there are bad games . But many of them are good .

 Bye . 
 What for ? 
 Why , you look pretty all right . 
 What ? What did you buy ? 
 What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? 
 And ? 
 And it's a brick ? 
 I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? 
 So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . 
 But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? 
 Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! 
 That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . 
 I think that ’ s settled . 
 How dare you speak to me like this . 
 I've got to go to bed . Have to work tomorrow . 
 Good night . See you tomorrow . 
 Good afternoon . What can I do for you ? 
 About half an hour ago I fell on the ground and hurt my leg . It bled a lot . 
 First , I'll clean up the wound and then dress it . 
 Take it easy . It's not serious . You should keep the wound very clean . 
 Thank you very much , doctor . 
 Excuse me , where are the canned goods ? 
 Thank you.And where can I buy some delicatessen ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 No . These terms need to be amplified . 
 Then the shipping documents have to be attached . That way , both parties confirm the documents that will accompany the draft and constitute evidence of shipment in compliance with the contract terms . 
 Yes , that's very important . 
 Are they coming to Chicago again ? 
 Oh , good ! We can all get together again . 
 And Margaret and I can take the dog and go jogging in the park . 
 Oh , yes . We all sat on the grass , and Margaret played the guitar and sang Greek songs . 
 How do your spend your time after work or in vacation ? 
 But traveling is an expensive hobby , isn't it ? 
 Good morning . May I help you ? 
 He's not in , I'm afraid . 
 I am sorry , I don't know . 
 Certainly . 
 You ’ re kidding . We ’ ll never make it across in one piece ! Let ’ s cross at the light . 
 If you want to cross here , be my guest . I don ’ t feel like dodging cars and scooters ! 
 I think it is easy . I could work in your class with no problem . 
 Oh , without a doubt . When is the next class ? 
 No problem . 
 Of course , easy . No sweat . 
 Are you kidding me ? It's going to be up a piece of cake . 
 Yeah , what't the bet ? 
 I heard you want to apply for the position as a foreign bank staff member , is it true ? 
 What about the foreign bank ? 
 What are the requirements ? 
 Would you be using English every day in this job ? 
 The pay must be good . 
 I have to find a living room set . 
 I don't know . 
 Where did you go to find yours ? 
 Does the furniture from IKEA cost a lot ? 
 How good of quality is the furniture ? 
 I don't mind paying for quality workmanship . 
 I don't think the manager will get mad at you for being late . 
 Is Betty Sue in her office ? 
 I see . 
 Yes , please tell her I stopped by . 
 Ted . Oh , and could you give her this document for me ? 
 I like double-breasted garment with no belt.Could you show me some ? 
 Medium.May I try it on ? 
 Can I help you ? 
 May I have your name please ? 
 Alright ... And did you have some specific questions about your application ? 
 Oh , that's no problem . Just give me a moment , and I can check.Judy Liao . Let's see ... Yes , here it is . Judy Liao . We have received your resume . 
 Is there anything else I can help you with ? 
 No , that is all we need . If we have those things included , that is sufficient . 
 I'm not really sure about that . But I know we are still receiving resumes.Maybe after a week or two they will start calling applicants . 
 If you have any further questions , you can call any time . 
 Thank you . Goodbye . 
 I hope that I can finally find free time too . I ’ Ve been so busy at work recently . 
 I hope to do a little gardening . I find it very relaxing . 
 I heard that the weather should be good . There ’ s a possibility of a shower , but it ’ s not very likely . 
 Of course , something could come up and stop that wish coming true . 
 My , it looks too queer ! 
 Great ! Will you please tell me how to take it ? 
 That sounds very interesting ! 
 Thank you very much . 
 Oh , don't be so sad . You can ask for a salary raise . 
 So you suppose you deserve a salary raise . 
 You ought to point out how valuable you are , and tell her those people who have the same situation also get the salary raise . 
 Remember it is the boss who hires you and tell her how much you have improved the office efficiency . 
 Forget it . Good luck . I hope you can make it . 
 Yeah . This is supply . What can I do for you ? 
 All right . No problem . What ’ s your extension ? 
 No , not yet . Why ? 
 Oh . I am not his fan . 
 Listen , Nancy . If I don't work hard , I will be laid off . 
 Come on , Nancy . Play it cool . I go with you and burn the middle night oil tonight . 
 I appreciate that . 
 I ’ m looking at my horoscope for this month ! My outlook is very positive . It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic , and that I will have a passionate summer fling ! 
 It ’ s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ’ m an Aries . When were you born ? 
 Let ’ s see . . . you ’ re a Capricorn . It says that you will be feeling stress at work , but you could see new , exciting developments in your love life . Looks like we ’ ll both have interesting summers ! 
 No , it ’ s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . See ? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize . 
 A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical . She likes to do things in conventional ways . That sounds just like you ! 
 I have time to speak with you . Where would you like to purchase your house ? 
 How many bedrooms and bathrooms do you need ? 
 Do you need to be located in a particular school district ? 
 Is a view important to you , or would you rather be located on a lakeshore lot ? 
 Thank you for all of the information . I will help you find the perfect house for you . 
 Who ’ s calling ? 
 Hold on , I ’ ll get her . 
 Actually , you can take advantage of our " New Millennium Woman " promotion .

 OK . Just think for a bit . I'll go help another customer . I'll be right back . 
 I did , Mom . 
 This is just for you . Cheers ! Bottoms up . 
 I want to redo this poster , but John and Mary think it's good enough as it is . 
 Do you have a copy of our service contract with Telecoms ? I'm not happy with their response time and I'd like to check the terms and conditions of the contract . 
 Is this the first time you've come to our city , Mr . Ross ? 
 I am so honored to hear that . Well , after staying here for several days , you must have some ideas about our company . We have been in the clothes field for many years , and yours brand is also well-known in the country . How about our cooperation ? 
 We intend to establish business relationship with your company on the basis of equality and mutual benefit . 
 Here you are , officer . 
 Yes , a camera bag , a travel bag and a suitcase . 
 No . I have only personal effects . 
 I guess there is some kind of virus seeking into my computer , I can ’ t send out this e-mail . Do you have the number of the text port ? 
 Of course not , I appreciate that . 
 I see . What can I do now ? 
 Good morning . This is Dr . Mustn ’ s Office . Can I help you ? 
 Is it urgent ( an emergency ) ? 
 How about this afternoon at 2:00 ? 
 Don ’ t forget to bring your health card with you . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 No , not very much . He's too ambitious and dishonest . 
 Yes . They are completely different . Paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother . 
 I think I'm polite , careful , relaxed and shy . 
 Well . Yes , but those people always start talking to me . I never talk to them first.Perhaps I'm not as shy as I think . Anyway , you're certainly not shy ! 
 So , you'll be at my birthday party on Friday ? 
 Are you sure Lucy has it bad for you ? If she does , she will certainly bend over backwards for you . But if she doesn't , it would be a job to change her . 
 And do you really love her ? 
 I have to miss school next week . 
 Unfortunately , this is what I have to do . 
 I've got it all covered . 
 Don't worry , this will be the last class I miss . 
 I'll remember . 
 I'm phoning about the factory visit next Friday . What should I do when I arrive ? 
 OK , thanks . Look forward to seeing you on Friday , then . 
 My name is Sam . 
 I'm fine . Thank you . 
 I'm from England . 
 I'm a bank manager . 
 I wouldn't call myself outgoing . I used to be very shy when I was little , and it seems that I get a little more relaxed a-round people year after year , and have more fun in groups . 
 I don't try to get in front of people and lead them , particularly . I'd rather cooperate with everybody else , and get the job done by working together . 
 Not to put off till tomorrow what you can do today . I've found out that time and money get away very easily — you think you have them , and they're gone ! Putting things off just makes it worse later , so even if it's hard at the time , I try to get things done that day and not let them go . 
 Honey , what's up ? 
 Oh , really ? I know that telephone signal must have been shielded in the elevator shaft , so what did you do then ? 
 Did you panic at the time ? 
 Was there anyone else with you ? 
 So you mean that you were the only brave one there ? 
 For what ? Complaining about what happened in the elevator ? 
 That was just an accident . you are worried too much about it . I think the property management will check the elevator and improve their service from now on . 
 I ’ m so surprised to meet you in this remote village . Long time no see . 
 Has the chief accepted our plan ? 
 Let ’ s have a try . 
 Really ? When did that happen ? 
 Have they set a date for the wedding ? 
 The weather is terrible . 
 I have been watching a lot of videos at home because of the constant rain . 
 I saw the weather report , and it's going to rain for the next eight days . 
 I'm getting pretty bored . We should do something despite the rain . 
 I haven't been to the Mall in a long time . Let's go there . 
 Great . I'll stop by your place now . 
 Could you come and help me mend the computer , Neel ? 
 I can't log on the internet again . 
 No , never . 
 I don't have this kind of software . 
 Don ’ t be worried . Please sit down and take it easy . 
 But you should avoid finger-pointing when you haven ’ t got the real facts . 
 OK.sir . Your room is done . Is there anything else I can do for you ? 
 OK.sir . 
 All the laundry will be ready by 5 
 Rob lost his bike . 
 What would you like to order ? 
 Did you want it with cheese ? 
 Did you want anything to drink ? 
 What kind of soda can I get you ? 
 What else would you like ? 
 Anything else ? 
 Can I help you ? 
 What's wrong with them ? 
 The front brake ? 
 What kind of car is it ? 
 Write down your name and address , give me the key , and I will check it out . 
 No . 
 About half an hour . 
 I heard a rumor this morning ... It seems Trusten Tools is going out of business.Another competitor is going bankrupt.That could be good news for us . 
 What ? We are merging with Trusten ? I never thought that would happen.Will we be getting new owners ? Will it affect our jobs ? 
 Wow , with such a big change.We won't have the same name ? 
 Good morning , Kate . Long time no see . 
 Kate , I know you ’ Ve been a stewardess for more than one year . And I ’ ll have an interview on stewardess tomorrow . Can you tell me some etiquette about the interview ? 
 Is there anything else I should pay attention to ? 
 Thank you , I've learned so much from you . 
 I'm glad we live in a small town . 
 Because the houses look so nice at Christmas time . 
 Yes , we have a big tree this year . I bought the decorations at the five-and-tencent store yesterday . Do you want to come and see it ? 
 When can you come ? 
 Hello . I am Bili and I made an appointment with you to see the house . 
 The house is a little too old . 
 Yes . That's why I like the house . 
 Congratulations , Bob ! That ’ s great news , what ’ s her name ? 
 That ’ s a pretty name . Give your wife my best ! 
 Wow , that's great ! 
 I've never really thought about it before . I guess it doesn't bother me . 
 I guess so . I usually buy name-brand clothing , shoes , and electronic goods . How about you ? 
 I know that advertisers are experts at persuading people to spend their money , I think brilliant items are usually higher quality than ~ grounds . 
 Do you have a brand preference for anything ? 
 What do you think about the " impossible is nothing " billboard on the high street ? 
 I think it's a brilliant advert ! It really grabs my attention ! 
 This apartment is wonderful . 
 How much would I have to pay for rent ? 
 That ’ s way too much money . 
 How about if I pay $ 850 ? 
 I can ’ t go any higher than $ 850 . 
 You can ’ t go any lower than that ? 
 Excuse me , sir , Is this the road to the peace Store ? 
 Where's Wort Street , please ? 
 How far is it from the Wort Street ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Sure , I'm looking forward to it . 
 I'll get used to not seeing my parents . 
 I think something must be done . 
 I would like to open a checking account at this branch . 
 I do , at a different location , I have a savings account and a CD . 
 Here is my driver's license . Will that work ? 
 Business please . And I want the most simple one you have . 
 Hey , what are you doing here ? 
 What are you shopping for ? 
 Same here . 
 I found a few pairs of pants . 
 I found them at Pennies . 
 Do you want me to show you where I found them ? 
 Hi , Jack , we are having a party tonight , wanna coming enjoy us ? You can bring your girlfriend , Tina . 
 Oh , that's right . Well , there are going to be many beautiful girls at the party tonight , anyway . 
 Why is that ? 
 I agree , a man needs good career.But that doesn't mean he should have a little fun , too . 
 Good evening . May I help you ? 
 Oh , no , never . What's the exact time you'd like us to call you tomorrow morning ? 
 It won't take long . 20 minutes is enough . Is that OK if I call you at 6:30 a . m . ? 
 It's a pleasure . Good night . Have a good sleep . 
 Is there a problem ? 
 What are you talking about ? 
 I can show you how to use it . 
 You need to push your card into the machine . 
 Enter your PIN . 
 Every option you can choose will appear on the screen . That ’ s about it . 
 It'll take us all some time to get used to the change . 
 Today is my wife's birthday , so I want to buy a bouquet for her . 
 I have no idea . 
 But rose is too common . 
 It looks good . Pack me a bouquet of violet , please . 
 I'm just trying to complete today's crossword puzzle . Whenever I get the time , I like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper . 
 I guess you could say that . What kind of games do you like ? 
 doesn't everyone ? Which games are those ? 
 did you play a lot of games when you were little ? 
 do you still like playing those games ? 
 everyone in my family really enjoys playing card games . 
 no , I prefer to play with people I know . 
 it's a popular game with some people , but I've never played it . 
 I hate to disappoint you , but unlike what most people think , we aren't all exactly the same ! 
 When was your reservation ? 
 Would you mind telling me the reason ? 
 Oh , I see . Would you like me to reschedule you for another time ? 
 But you have to pay the fee for refund . 
 Good afternoon , ABC Incorporated . How many I direct your call ? 
 I am sorry , sir . He isn't in right now . Would you like to leave a message ? 
 And your company name , please . 
 Is there a telephone number where you can be reached ? 
 Thank you , sir . I'll tell him you called . 
 Taxi ! 
 Wangfujing , please ! 
 Oh , I like the music on your radio . It's nice . 
 I like Winner's English very mush . You know the Beijing Olympic Games is right around the corner . We should learn English Well . It's on FM 96.6 , China Business Radio . You can get it on your radio too . 
 That's OK . The program is especially for the beginners like us . 
 It begins at 6:40 every morning , and it goes for 20 minutes . 
 The radio has brought us lots of convenience . 
 With the development of the society and technology , radio is nearly everywhere . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Sure . When do you want to get it back ? 
 Yes , but we charge 50 % more and it only takes 3 hours . 
 30 yuan . 
 Yes . This gap can be filled by export market research before exporting . 
 That's right . They do not appreciate its value and consider it to be a luxury . 
 Exactly ! 
 That's right . And his wife is a baby doll , too . She used to have many followers . 
 Nothing of the sort . I can't hold a candle to her . 
 Yes , the wine list is at the end of the menu . 
 Sorry , sir , but I recommend you Bacardi White . It's quite delitous . 
 Are you ready ? 
 Betty , would you please read this letter of application I've just written ? I'd like to have your opinion . 
 Good ! I'm interested in your advice . 
 Good idea , Betty . What would you think about the second part ? 
 You're right , I'll change it . How about the last part ? 
 I agree . I appreciate your helping me . 
 I am sorry to hear that . You have to fill out a claim form . 
 Here you are . 
 They must have practiced a lot . The perseverance has made them they are today . 
 Let me have a look . Well , it lists some shows that will be on next week . 
 Hmm ... Oh , this one , ' The Drunken Beauty ' . This is a real classic . 
 Of course not . She was said to be the most beautiful woman in her time and that made her become the queen . They play was famous for its singing and dancing . 
 She is an opera star in China . Her teacher's teacher is Mei Landfang . 
 You are such an expert on it . I don't know that . 
 So , want me to book the tickets again ? 
 We can do that if you like . Maybe next weekend . 
 Have you ever been to any other country ? 
 That's also my dream . 
 Why not ? 
 I've got a headache and a cough . 
 What should I do , doctor ? 
 Yes . 
 Thank you . 
 What a miser ! He cycles to school every day . 
 I can't understand him anyway . 
 He's been out of work for a couple of days . 
 He has a bad cold . 
 Thanks . I'll tell him . 
 Oh , yes . I love playing badminton , table tennis and computer games . And playing the games has become my favorite . 
 I'm no better than them . They say it's mindless to sit in front of a machine all the time , but I think it's stimulating . 
 Once in a while . 
 I hope I can practice self-control again . 
 The science field trip is next Monday at 8 o'clock in the morning . Do you want to make note of that on your calendar ? 
 Next Monday is December 2nd . The buses will leave at 8 , but we must begin loading at 7 
 You might want to tell whoever is picking you up that you will return on December 8th . Do you have a ride ? 
 To get back to campus by 8 
 All of the extra information that you need is on the bulletin board in the hallway . See you on Monday ! 
 Stop it . Teacher doesn't treat me any different than she does everyone else . 
 Hey , I worked hard on that report and I deserve the grade I got . 
 You're just jealous because you didn't do as well as you thought you did . Admit it . 
 If you think that she is not fair with your work then you should talk to her in person instead of stewing over it . 
 It doesn ’ t matter to me . 
 Either way . I don ’ t care . 
 I couldn ’ t careless . 
 Whatever you say . 
 I don ’ t mind if you want to . 
 All right . Let me have a check . Can you tell me how can you inspect your exported goods ? 
 That is good . And here I give you a piece of advice . You should have used stronger cardboard boxes for such a heavy item . Besides , it's better to secure the cartons with metal straps . What's more , the order number wasn't anywhere on some of the boxes . 
 Thank you . Can I open the packages to check the color and style ? 
 The color and style are consistent with the sample . Great ! 
 Yes , that's for sure . There is nothing wrong with the quality . I think you'd better pack them first in plastic bags , than in cartons . 
 My father ’ s angry face always makes my blood run cold . 
 Not often . Just when I make mistakes . 
 I finished them in no time . 
 Mum , when will we have them again ? 
 Yes and no . I can ' t wait to go to Europe , but at the same time I am terrified . 
 Well , I have acrophobia . I have a chronic fear of flying . 
 You ' re scared of spiders ? I actually have two more phobias . Acrophobia and glossophobia . 
 Are you kidding ? When I get on stage , my palms start to sweat , I get really nervous and I can hardly speak . 
 We are such weirdos right ? 
 Oh , I'd love to . But we're going to clean our dormitory . I can't be absent . 
 In fact , our dormitory is much worse than they can be described . 
 You'll get used to it gradually . 
 Yes , we do . That's why we have a cleaning every three months . 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Yes , sir . Is there anything wrong ? 
 No problem , sir . We will arrange you a table for 5 . 
 Doctor , what are some things I can do to stay as healthy as I can be ? 
 Sometimes I don ’ t know what the best foods are . 
 What things should I avoid ? 
 Beyond diet , what else can I do to be healthy ? 
 How about having a beer on the weekend ? 
 I want to buy a rain coat . Could you please show me one ? 
 I like yellow best . How much does it cost ? 
 It's nice , but that's very steep for a rain coat . Could you give me a 20 percent discount ? 
 In that case , I don't think I'll buy one here . 
 Fine with me , but no more chafing dish . 
 I'd love to try some snacks . 
 Kebabs and roast squid . 
 Help yourself . 
 You look happy . 
 Wow ! Is it a good car ? 
 Was it expensive ? 
 What colour is it ? 
 I really love this meal . 
 Where did you learn to cook these amazing dishes ? 
 The chicken is out of this world ! 
 I was wondering if there was shrimp in the soup . 
 It worked out well that the wine that I brought to share seems to blend well with this meal . 
 Madam , is everything set up for your trip ? 
 You will be busier , right ? 
 That will be gorgeous ! 
 Yes , Madam . 
 How about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym . 
 Me , too . What did you have in mind ? 
 I agree . They're very lovely , especially Huanhuan 
 The five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive . 
 I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now . 
 There are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts . 
 I usually get a lot of information on the computer and use E-mail to send messages to my friends . 
 Don't you think it ' s a sheer waste of both time and money ? 
 Catherine , have you ever seen the movie Fast Food Nation ? 
 It's very thought-provoking , isn't it ? 
 So what do you think of the American fast food culture ? 
 And everyone knows that Americans ' favorite food is the hamburger , isn't it ? 
 But I think some healthy menu options are also served at fast food restaurants .. 
 Such as fat-free milk , whole-wheat rolls and fish sandwich . 
 But I'm not sure if they're well-rcceived . 
 Well , Americans may need to find a way to make the most of their fast foods . 
 Okay , I want to change 22,000 . 
 Okay , here you are . ( She hands the completed form and the money to the clerk . ) 
 Thank you very much . 
 Oh , there is something wrong with my car . 
 I want to change a new car . I like Honda best , especially the red one . But it is too expensive . 
 Yeah . Maybe I can find my favorite car in addition to Honda . 
 Jane , we are going to have a board meeting next Friday . Will you please arrange it for me ? 
 Sure . Actually it's a routine board meeting . The things to be discussed are all written here . 
 Go ahead . It's for your reference . While you are at it , make me a special agenda and don't forget to have enough room at the side for notes . 
 Exactly . As I am supposed to the chair of the meeting , I don't want it to get out of control . 
 The conference room on the second floor , is that ok ? 
 Good , and please get some water , glasses and ash tray ready as well . 
 Definitely . The minutes have to be taken accurately . 
 Oh , that's easy . I will write you a list of their names . You can make a seating plan with the names and give each one a number . 
 You don ’ t look like enjoying this workout . 
 You don ’ t like this sort of exercise ? 
 Yes , that ’ s funny . I thought you liked it . 
 Never mind . It ’ ll be over in 10 minutes . 
 I am trying to decide what school to apply to ? 
 I am not sure . What's the difference between them ? 
 Which is better ? 
 I hear you have to wear uniforms at private school . 
 Why weren't you at school yesterday ? 
 What was wrong with you ? 
 Do you feel better now ? 
 Do you want anything to make you feel better ? 
 I hope you feel better . 
 Is that pesky lady coming to the office again ? 
 If there's one thing that bugs me , it's her critical attitude . 
 I had a look yesterday . I found some exhibits are fine in quality and beautiful in design . The exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles . I have gone over the catalogue and the pamphlets enclosed in your last letter . I have got some idea of your exports . I am interested in your silk blouses . 
 Some of them are of the latest style . Now I have a feeling that we can do a lot of trade in this line . We wish to establish business relationship with you . 
 Concerning our financial position , credit standing and trade reputation , you may refer to our bank.or to our local chamber of commerce or inquiry agencies . 
 That sounds interesting ! I'll send a fax . As soon as I receive the definite answer , I'll give you a special answer . 
 So do I . 
 That is what I want to say . 
 Thank you ! 
 Yeah . 
 China . 
 China beat Brazil three to zero . 
 OK , so now the last point on our agenda . Jill , let's go over the profit and loss statement . 
 Let ’ s see ... These numbers are off the charts ! What's going on here ! 
 OK , thank you . I ’ ll look into it . 
 Thank you.that will be all . I ’ ll take care of it . 
 OK , I get it ! ! Thank you for your very thorough analysis ! 
 You have any idea why ? 
 I heard her boyfriend is married . 
 Then what about you ? How are you getting on with your boyfriend ? 
 hey , Jimmy , you've been sitting in front of the TV all day . Anything interesting on TV ? 
 why don't you turn off the TV and get outside ? You need to get some fresh air . 
 Really ? What's the series about ? 
 it sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth . 
 really ? that's interesting ! 
 OK , I'll give it a go . 
 Thank you . Do I have to pay in advance ? 
 Here you are . 
 Are you asking me ? 
 Well , you know me . I can always eat pizza or Spagetti . 
 I know , don ’ t remind me . I ’ m starting a new diet the day after tomorrow . 
 My battery's flat in my mobile . 
 And I couldn't find another phone . 
 Have you every belonged to a political party ? 
 Really ? I know you are very concerned about the environment . You were a member of the pressure group Greenpeace , weren ’ t you ? 
 The green party have no chance of winning an election . The other parties are too big and popular . 
 Most people are not very politically aware . They often don ’ t understand the issues fully . 
 Let's eat out . 
 Yeah . You don't need to rub it in . 
 Fifteen ? And Zina pushed them up to seventy-five ? 
 Anyway , I'm still happy I left . I'm working as a freelancer now . 
 Have you ever shopped at Whole Foods market ? 
 It's very good , and it's fresh too . 
 I shopped there before too , but the food is better at Whole Foods . 
 Their range of organic foods is very limited . 
 Yeah , the food there is very healthy . 
 The food there is a great step up from Sons . 
 Do you carry black ink ? 
 I've looked for , but I didn't see any black ink . 
 Well , I'll settle for blue-black . I'll also take a dozen airmail envelopes . 
 Give me a package of twenty , then . And where do I find shoelaces ? 
 Thank you . I never can find my way around this store . 
 Good evening , may I help you ? 
 I am sorry , madam . All the tables are booked now . 
 Would you please bring us the check ? 
 Does that include the service charge ? 
 Here you are . Keep the change . 
 Yes . Table tennis is probably the most popular . 
 Most anyway . 
 Yes , I like . But I can't play it well . 
 Basketball and swimming are very popular . 
 We can play together if you are free . 
 It is time to butter him up . 
 I don ’ t know . Let me see . 
 Wow . She can be really nasty , can't she ? 
 Well , I guess Zina figured you couldn't blow it if you were in the hotel room . 
 Well , at least we have Stars.com . That'll be great publicity . 
 OK . Here you are . 
 About three weeks . 
 Sightseeing . 
 At the Friendship Hotel in Beijing . 
 Yes , I have some fresh apples in my suitcase . 
 Oh , that's too bad . 
 I'm surfing the Net . 
 Yes . Here you are . 
 By the way , please have these suits pressed . 
 You really do a good job . 
 I know . I think it may rain . 
 That would be weird . 
 I know , it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside . 
 I really wish it wasn't so hot every day . 
 I like winter too , but sometimes it gets too cold . 
 Me too . 
 Thank you . 
 Your company has an impressive reputation . My uncle worked for your company for many years . 
 Yes , but he retired 5 years ago . 
 I ’ m a senior broker in a large company . I deal with clients on a daily basis , handling all aspects of their accounts personally . 
 Yes , I do think I am the right candidate for this position . 
 Well , I have a lot of experience in this area . I have all the qualifications you need . I enjoy working with people . In my current job , I ’ m in charge of a team of eight people . 
 Yes , if I were hired , when would you like me to start ? 
 And how many accounts would I handle ? 
 What kind of benefit package do you offer ? 
 No , not at the moment . 
 Thanks . It was very nice to meet you . 
 You know them ? 
 How are you doing today ? 
 What can I do for you ? 
 How much would you like to take out ? 
 Which account would you like to take the money from ? 
 Okay , here you go . 
 Can I do anything else for you ? 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Yes.we have herb medicine and ready-made medicine . 
 Sorry , sir . The angelica is out of stock now . 
 You have so many antiques and Chinese paintings here . May I have a look first ? 
 Are they genuine ? 
 Well , I guess that ’ s about it . Everything ’ s packed and ready to go . 
 Have fun ! I plan to spend some more time with my grandkids , and I might even go back to school . 
 Like to come over to our fancy dress party ? 
 Well , then join us some other time . 
 Have we sold out all the newspapers for today ? 
 Why are so many extra gifts left here ? 
 How about giving them to that old man ? 
 By the way , do you think it's a good idea to give free gifts to attract customers ? 
 I think it should be more useful to hand out some fliers which is also cheaper . 
 That's true . 
 Okay . How tiring the job is ! 
 I'd like to hire a bike . I think it would be a good idea to do some cycling on Sunday . 
 I am sure it will be . It's been good so far this weekend . 
 Thanks . That would be really helpful . 
 Excuse me , can you help me ? I would like to change rooms if possible , I couldn ’ t sleep at all last night , because the people in the room next to mine were making a lot of noise , also if at all possible , I ’ d like a room that doesn ’ t overlook the street , between the noisy neighbors and the highway outside , I didn ’ t sleep a wink . 
 I ’ m on the 6th floor , room 698 , I ’ v had many problems with that room , just this morning , I called someone up to fix the light fixture in the bathroom , it didn ’ t work , and it still doesn ’ t work . 
 Ok , that would be very nice ! What do I need to do to transfer ? 
 Mmm , I don ’ t think the charges are right , can you explain them please ? 
 Are you homesick ? 
 Don't worry about the bill . Just call . 
 Of course . First dial the code 011 to get an international line . Then you dial Taiwan's country code 
 Now you should know the rest . Don't forget to dial Taipei's city code . 
 I'm not sure if that would be wise . 
 Well , maybe we'll go to ask Mr . Johnson . He has the final say . 
 Next Wednesday . 
 Yes , I have . 
 Ten days ago . 
 Yes , he will . 
 Excuse me , sir . I am coming to apply for the position of accountant . 
 I graduated from Tianjin College of Commerce . 
 My major was accounting . 
 Sure . I took such courses as accounting principles , commercial accounting , cost accounting , industrial accounting , electronic data processing accounting , and accounting involved in foreign capital enterprises . 
 I'm engaged in accounting . 
 My work involves various routine bookkeeping and basic accounting tasks including journal entries , verifying data and reconciling discrepancies , preparing detailed reports from raw data , and checking accounting documents for completeness , mathematical accuracy and consistency . 
 I think so . 
 Of course . This balance sheet contains three major sections , that is , assets , liabilities and owner's equity . So , you see , the total current liabilities of your company are $ 3,372 , 000 , and the owner's equity is $ 5,400 , 000 . That means that the total assets , which is equal to the sum of the creditor's and the owner's equities , are $ 8,772 , 000 . 
 The creditor's equity is the same as liabilities . 
 I always meet people like him . 
 It looks like it was made just for you . 
 How would you like to pay for it ? 
 Now , if you'll just sign here . 
 So long . Have a nice weekend . 
 Would you please fill some gas for me ? 
 Unleaded , please . 
 The Johnson are on their way back . You remember them , don't you ? 
 We met them in Bermuda last May . 
 The couple with the dogs-think back . 
 Well , I've invited them for brunch . 
 What are your terms of sale ? 
 My understanding is that CIF means the seller is responsible for prepaying shipping costs and arranging for the insurance policy . 
 Is it possible to consider FOB ? That way , we will handle the insurance through our broker . 
 Good morning . Madam . How can I help ? 
 Certainly . We can transfer the money straight into your bank account here and then you can withdraw it right away . Could I have your Passbook for Bank-Securities Account Transfer ? 
 Your balance today is 120,376 RIB . 
 OK . Please fill in this form and input you code here ... and again , please . I'll just check and see if the money has been transferred . Yes , transaction successful . 
 Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long 
 Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . Half an hour , tops . 
 True , I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on , even when you show up to class in sweatpants . Tell me , how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ? 
 May I help you ? 
 How about this one ? It smells like green tea and is our best seller . Try it . 
 It goes for $ 40 . 
 What's wrong ? You don't like ancient Egypt ? 
 The Pyramids are amazing ! Millions of gigantic stones ... each one perfect ... 
 You sound like the TV ! You're not going to tell me that aliens built the Pyramids , are you ? 
 Yes , I ordered a camera and some personal care stuff online yesterday . They will be delivered in two weeks . 
 Sometimes you can save money and you can find things that you had difficulty finding in a store . sometimes it's just convenient , like doing it late at night and sometimes it's just fun . 
 How is the project going ? 
 Do you have any problem during the process ? You should speed things up . 
 Have you ever helped others when they are in trouble ? Most will give a hand to someone who has helped him . 
 And you should have good co-operation with other colleagues , you know a scientific schedule brings efficiency to the work . 
 Cheer up and pay more attention to your colleagues and the things will be much better . I am speaking from my experience . 
 And you should read as much as possible to enrich the knowledge . 
 We're approaching the critical point for success or failure of this project . you'd better speed up and catch up with books . 
 If you have any problem in your work , let me know . 
 How may I help you ? 
 Do you have your library card with you ? 
 You ’ re going to have to wait for a computer . 
 Please put your name on this list . 
 When there is a computer available , I will call you . 
 Just type in the number on the back of your library card . 
 how do you feel about wearing name logos or slogans on your clothing ? 
 do you think advertising has an influence on the choices you make when you're shopping ? 
 I actually try to avoid name-brand items . I can't stand it when big companies advertise their products all over the place ! 
 Sure . 
 I don't mind helping . 
 So that's four plates , four forks , four knives , and four spoons ? 
 Don't be silly ! I know how to use knives and forks . 
 Does the class start again , Mam ? 
 Oh , breaktime flies . 
 Mam , another minute , could I ? 
 You're so witty ... 
 This watch is supposed to be worn on your left hand . 
 It's better for right-handed people like me . See , I don't even have to move my arm to see the time . 
 Bingo ! 
 Come in please . 
 Yes . Put them on there please . 
 Thank you . By the way , what shall we do with the plates when we finish our meal ? 
 I see . Thanks a lot . 
 Well ... this one costs more , but it has a much better sound.This part of it is made of wood , not plastic . And there's a tone control , too . 
 Hmm ... well , the other one is good for the money . It's much cheaper . We sell clot of them and all our customers are satisfied with them . 
 Certainly . 
 OK , OK , this is good . Keep talking . What about cappuccino and all those other drinks ? 
 Froth ? 
 Thanks , Hugh . I owe you one . 
 And it's all coming down to the next three weeks . 
 Yeah , she is some kind of Superwoman , isn't she ? 
 You've got a beautiful singing voice ! 
 Come on , You hit the high notes perfectly ! 
 You're too modest . Pass me the catalogue ! I'd like to see which song to choose.Wow , this place has a large selection of songs . I dont know which to choose ! 
 Funny.Oh , i like this song . It's by one of my favorite singers . 
 1021.It ' s a duet ! Come on , Pick the mic and sing along ! 
 I'm so nervous about this oral test . 
 I just want to get it over with . 
 What is it ? 
 There must be something wrong with her . 
 Would you show me your notice ? 
 Please endorse it first . Do you have identification ? 
 Hello . I'm Jason . 
 Nice to meet you , Dolma . 
 Sorry , Mary , I can't make it in time for dinner . 
 Maybe I will be around later . 
 Why did your parents make you stay at home ? 
 Didn't you mind doing it ? 
 Didn't you even want to go to the cinema ? 
 What was on television last night ? 
 Oh . I enjoy watching boxing on television , too.What a pity I missed it last night ! 
 I went to a boxing match in the sports stadium . 
 Thank you for your coming . 
 So long ! 
 Yeah , I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet . 
 Sounds good . I don ’ t want it to be too expensive , maybe something mid-range . 
 What about Wi-fi ? 
 One last thing . Is it waterproof ? 
 Yeah , I cherish it . Because I have been working like a dog for two months to buy it . 
 I'm colin . It's nice to meet you . What do you do ? 
 I'm in between jobs at the moment . 
 I'd like to find a job with flexible hours in the IT field . 
 no . Is it difficult to find such a job ? 
 yes . I'm pretty out-going and friendly . 
 I have some . I worked in the IT department at a language school for four years in Spain . 
 yes , but not fluently . 
 I've sent my CV to dozens of companies but nobody has got back to me . 
 no , because I didn't know what I wanted to do . 
 thanks , I will . I'll see you tomorrow then ! 
 The bride's parents ' seating arrangement is on the left side of the aisle and the groom's parents is on the right side . 
 They usually do . 
 What's wrong with it ? 
 How long have you been having this problem ? 
 Does the internet come up at all ? 
 Well , the internet isn't down , so there must be something wrong with your connection . 
 I'll send somebody over right away to fix it . 
 They should be there in the next hour . 
 150 pounds . 
 I can't bear eating less . 
 Our terms are net 30 . 
 You would have to order in excess of 10,000 units to be eligible . 
 An option we can offer is two separate shipments.We will house the inventory until you are ready for us to ship it to you . 
 Thank you . 
 They're over there next to the door . Those three with green tags on them . 
 Sure , here it is . 
 Honey , please forgive me . There is lots of work to do . So , I forget your birthday . 
 Look , Dad , many people are doing morning exercises here . 
 Really ? You were so happy then . 
 Daddy , don't mention it . 
 Dad , I'd like to take a picture with the status . 
 Daddy , we can't have a photo of the whole family . We can take one here . 
 Good luck on your test tomorrow . We'll be crossing our fingers for you ! 
 There will be another sandstorm here tomorrow . 
 Yes . We should plant more trees and grass to stop the sand from spreading . 
 But we need the wood . 
 Hello , this is Catharine from Thomson Company . Can I speak to Mr . Wang ? 
 Yes . Please tell him that he is expected to have an interview with the CEO of ABC company tomorrow morning at 10:00 . 
 OK , I will repeat what I said loudly . 
 Yes , ma'am . Here we are . 
 30 dollars , ma'am . 
 Yes , but we need some extra charge and some tip , too . 
 OK , ma'am . Calm down , 15 dollars will do . 
 Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall . 
 She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she ' s around . 
 Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her . 
 It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids . 
 You are an outgoing person , quite easy to talk with . 
 Do you have many friends ? 
 What do you usually do with them ? 
 Which pair of jeans do you like best ? 
 But they aren't very fashionable . What about these ? 
 That's the style ! You just wear boxers . 
 You're so old fashioned ! Nobody is going to pull down your pants ! 
 May I please speak to Robert ? 
 Is this 2517758 ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry . 
 Bruno Bistro , how may I help you ? 
 Certainly sir , For which day and time please ? 
 I'm sorry sir , but we are fully booked tonight until eight . 
 Very well , and how many people will attend tonight ? 
 Lastly , may I please know what name I should make the reservation under ? 
 Waiter ! 
 Where shall I pay the bill ? 
 OK . How much is it all together ? 
 Is the service charge included ? 
 OK , here you are . 
 What kind of jobs are becoming popular in your country ? 
 There ’ s been a growth in that field in my country too . A lot of people want to learn practical and professional skills . 
 I noticed that too . What are the people learning ? 
 I think that jobs in the leisure industry will become more popular in the future . 
 Those in traditional fields , such as agriculture and heavy industry . Younger people are not interested in doing those jobs and other countries have industries that can produce things much cheaper . 
 They are well known for high quality , that ’ s why . 
 Played poker with my work friends . 
 Of course . 
 It ’ s exactly twelve minutes past seven . 
 Begin at 9 o ’ clock sharp . 
 You have gone against the traffic rules . 
 Do you know this is a Onaway street ? 
 You have to pay a fine . 
 Thank you . I try to keep in shape . 
 Yes , as long as I can find the time . I like swimming best . 
 I like the back best . I am good at freestyle stroke , but I usually use breast stroke as it keeps me from getting tired . 
 I agree . I'm not good at it , either . Can you swim ? How about going for a swim this Saturday ? 
 What's wrong with you ? 
 Do you feel tired ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . I'll have to examine you . 
 Open your mouth and show me your tongue . Say ah ... You have a bad cold . So you must stay in bed for a week . 
 No , thanks . I'm on a diet . 
 Guess what ? He has just got the sack . 
 Exactly . 
 Sure . The exhibits on display were really fascinating . 
 Good idea . Let's ask the officer for help . 
 sure . What do you need ? 
 really ? Why ? 
 but surely they won't fire you ! You're one of the most experienced managers here ! 
 well that's great news ! Congratulations ! Where will you be located ? 
 it'll be sad to see you go , but it sounds like you're found yourself a great opportunity . 
 I'm sorry to bring this up , but would it be possible for you to write me a letter of recommendation before you go ? 
 thanks . I appreciate that . 
 OK , it so happened I want to buy one . 
 I think it ’ s good , and it suits me , because I'm not good at cooking . Is it expensive ? 
 Wedding rings ! 
 Aren't they cool ? I like the settings . 
 No . I just like looking at wedding rings , OK ? 
 These are specially designed for the year 2000 ! 
 I don't know . What do you want to do ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 Yeah , I guess you're right . It's easy to get bogged down in the day to day , and forget to change things up once in a while . Let's break out and do something completely different tonight . 
 An hour ? That's a bit of a bummer . Let me take a peek and see what else there is . How about going dancing ? We haven't done that in a while . There's a club in Silver Lake that's supposed to be hopping on Friday nights . Eddie from work told me that they have a really good DJ and a big dance floor , and the cover charge isn't bad . 
 Yeah , I was hoping you'd say that . It's nice to have the option to go out but I'd rather stay in . Maybe we can go out tomorrow night . 
 Can you tell me if there is a flight to New York ? 
 So many stops ! Don't you have any direct flights ? 
 What sort of shopping is nearby , Mr . Taylor ? 
 What about things other than food ? 
 Are there small shops near here as well ? 
 Well , that sounds just wonderful . 
 We are just going round the corner for a drink . Won't you join us ? 
 Oh , come on ! Just a quick one ! 
 Happy New Year , Rose . 
 Thank you , I will . What are you up to today ? 
 Sure , why not . Sounds like fun . Why are you going to church ? 
 What for ? 
 May I have a menu , please ? 
 Could you tell me how this thing is cooked ? 
 Is it good ? 
 I think I will try some lobster , and give me some green salad together . 
 Why not ? China is a wonderful country . 
 No , I'm afraid not now . I'm too busy . 
 No , who won ? 
 What ? You can ’ t be serious ! 
 Why would anyone vote for McCain ? 
 That ’ s horrible . 
 More bad news ? 
 Are you serious this time ? That ’ s wonderful news . 
 It's nice to meet you , Mr . Cooper . 
 Yes , it was quite a long flight . I'm glad to finally be here . 
 How much is a round-trip ticket to London ? 
 In the second week of September . 
 In that case , I'll go after the 15th . How much are the off-season fares ? 
 Okay , I'll take it . ( to be continued ) 
 I need some help catching up . Are you good at typing or could you help me xerox ? 
 Thank you ! There are papers on the table to start with . 
 I really appreciate the help . How many years have you been with the company ? 
 I have a special assignment coming up . Would you be interested in helping me on it ? 
 I'll make sure that management keeps you in mind for special projects in the future . Thanks for the help ! 
 About my boyfriend . 
 You are really a wet blanket . 
 Could I purchase Euro with RIB here ? I have to stay here for months . 
 Yes , I have known of it . 
 20,000 RIB . 
 It doesn't matter , but leave me some small changes , that will be convenient in daily life . 
 Well , could you change them too ? The dollars , I want to change them into Swiss francs . 
 It doesn't matter . 
 Thanks a lot . Good-bye . 
 Well , there does have one . Walk along the road and turn left when you come to a bystreet . It will lead you to the back gate of the park . 
 I don't think so . 
 Yes , she does . She works at home . 
 Oh , no . Most of the time I do these things . She is a writer . 
 How's your business ? 
 Things are tough all over . You should never give up ! 
 I think you should make a thorough market investigation now . 
 I always consider you are such a guy who never gives up . 
 Yeah , you can make it . 
 I am quite alive and energetic . I am a curious person , and I like to learn new things . 
 I am quite outgoing , I think . 
 I try to adapt myself . 
 Pardon me ? 
 Oh , I see . I'll have beer , please . 
 Thank you.How much is it ? 
 Are you sure ? Then , I will have more beer , please . 
 How long are you staying ? 
 May I ask what brought you here ? 
 What line of business are you in ? 
 I was told that your company had been in the furniture industry for many years . What kinds of products do you generally handle ? 
 You know , we want to totally furnish our new office building . This is a list of what we need . Could you give me a ballpark figure for everything on this list ? 
 If the furniture is pleasantly designed and high-quality stuff , we intend to buy several thousand sets . 
 I hope you will make us your best offer , CIF New York . 
 My dissertation . I put it somewhere last night and I can't find it now . 
 Yes , I kept on typing it until midnight , but it is lost . 
 Yes , but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk . 
 I've searched everywhere . Where on earth did I put it ? 
 I have been working on it for a whole month and it's too late to write another . Just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . How could I do such a thing ? 
 Let me see . Yes , that's it . Where did you find it ? 
 My poor memory . Thank you very much . 
 Are you kidding ? I ’ m terrible ! But I love to watch sports . I go to football or baseball games a lot . And I read sports magazines every week . 
 Do you like sports , Janice ? 
 Oh , I see . You know , we spend time doing different sports . How much time do you spend exercising ? 
 That ’ s great ! I ’ Ve heard people say that before . 
 Oh , I ’ m too lazy to play sports , and I ’ m not good at anything either . It hardly excites me . 
 What for ? 
 All right.Here ' s the money . I suppose I'll have to drive you there . 
 Sure . It's very close actually.You go straight down this road . Then you turn left , at the next junction . 
 Bluemingdails is on the corner of that block . You see it as you turn left.Seriously , You can't miss it.It ' s enormous . 
 What are you going to do with that vase , Penny ? 
 Don ’ t do that . Give it to me . 
 I ’ m going to put it here , in front of the window . 
 There we are ! It ’ s a lovely vase . 
 Are you finished ? 
 Oh , sure . I'll be back in a minute.Thank you for waiting . Here it is.Did you enjoy your meal ? 
 Is that so ? I'm glad you enjoyed it . 
 Toilets are in the rear . I'm afraid all the toilets are fully occupied at the moment . 
 DM210 is equivalent to 400 RIB . 
 Are you afraid of losing money due to exchange rate fluctuations ? 
 Mary , today is a great day for you . 
 Oh , here's a little token of my affection . 
 Hey Eve , how are you ? 
 I ’ m ok . I ’ m so busy ! 
 Yes . Don ’ t you ? 
 Which class are you working on right now ? 
 Are you in Mrs . Green ’ s class ? 
 Yes . We must have the same exam tomorrow ! 
 Sure . This library is too quiet though . 
 That sounds good . 
 Millions of amateur investors like you , have to rely on a dizzying array of financial newspapers , magazines and commentators to get investment information . 
 It's like information overload , not to mention the reliability of these papers and magazines . 
 Well , for example , The Wall Street Journal is very , very good . Even though it's used on occasion ( as all news organizations are ) by Ces or bankers who leak their mergers in advance in order to get a positive spin . 
 Good . Fortune is usually ahead of the curve.And Business Week is very solid , too . 
 A good broadcast company usually does far more than press releases.Their people go out and do real reporting , talking to people at the stock exchange , fund managers , analysts , etc . 
 You are right about that . 
 OK . Are you sure it's funny , though ? 
 OK . 
 I see . 
 Oh , that's funny ! 
 Oh , sorry . 
 A car door ? You mean just one car door ? 
 Well ... 
 Of course I have . I'd like to marry a handsome man and have two children if possible . 
 I don't believe you can make it when you meet your Mrs . Right . 
 He has extensive experience , although the guy ’ s really deep , sometimes , it scares me . 
 I know , and that's why I'm always respectful and I keep my distance . It's safer that way . 
 It's in the eyes . They're the type that seems to look into your soul , making one really uneasy . 
 Yes , I agree with you . 
 Bite your tongue ! I ’ m already at the end of my rope . Some nights I don ’ t sleep at all . John manages to sleep like a log even when the babies are screaming at the top of their lungs . 
 I wouldn ’ t say that I had the time of my life but at least everything went without a hitch . 
 What's going on here ? 
 Why are you climbing through the window and not leaving by the front door ? 
 Just a minute you two . I don't think you're telling me the truth . This isn't poorhouse , is it ? 
 Is he at home ? 
 Billy , you don ’ t look too well . Maybe you should take the day off school . 
 You ’ Ve god a fever and playing football isn ’ t a good idea for a boy with a fever . What ’ s that on your arm ? 
 It ’ s a rash . I ’ d better take you to see the doctor . How did you get that bruise on your leg ? 
 Does it hurt ? 
 Here . Put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down . I ’ ll take you to the doctor ’ s after breakfast . 
 If you are better , but I doubt you will be . 
 Can you believe I'm going to America ? 
 Yes , I'm really excited . 
 I need to report a missing Bank Card and Book . 
 Well , the account's in my name . Patrick Dean , that's D-E-A-N . The account number is 15273478841 . There was about 20,000 RIB inside . 
 OK , it's 672910 . 
 Yes , I think so too . 
 Let me think ... I want to know if the company can provide free accommodation for a new employee . 
 I really hope that your company could provide living places ; otherwise I have to rent a house to live . 
 That would work too . 
 Some companies will pay part of the phone bills for the employees . Will this company do so ? 
 I understand . Will the company provide training ? 
 That's great . Thank you very much . 
 It's one of the top papers in America . 
 I want to change rooms . In fact , I want a refund for tonight ! 
 Cockroaches have taken over my room ! 
 Thank you . I want to continue to be able to recommend this hotel to others . 
 Is there a lot of snow in this region at this time of the year ? 
 Well , I think I like it . I appreciate the snow very much . 
 By the way , where can I go ski ? 
 The restaurant across the street hired a new Chinese chef , so I ordered some Chinese food there for this evening . 
 Something hot and spicy . They look very inviting on the menu . You are going to love them . 
 I'm not sure . I don't enjoy cooking that much . As long as we can order it from a restaurant , we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves . 
 Hey . Why did you take that money ? You are such a cheater ! I should send you to jail ! 
 Well you can ’ t just take the money . You have to ask the bank for money . And I ’ m the banker . 
 Yes ... 
 Sure . Here you are , $ 200 , Thank you , please come again ! Now it ’ s my turn to roll the dice . 
 Hi . I ’ m Tom Peterson . I ’ m looking for a one-bedroom apartment . 
 That ’ s fine . 
 Well , between $ 350-400 a month . 
 I ’ d like to live somewhere near the university , or at least on a bus line . 
 As soon as possible . 
 Fine . 
 I would like to have a dishwasher and central air conditioning . 
 Thank you . This one looks nice . Is it near the university ? 
 That ’ s good . I ’ d like to see it . 
 What do you feel like having ? 
 I had pizza for lunch yesterday . 
 Do you want to get a burger ? 
 Think of something . 
 Let's do that then . 
 They sell pizza and burgers at the cafeteria . 
 It is free on weekend . 
 Here is a guiding plan . 
 What day did you have it scheduled for ? 
 What time was it scheduled for ? 
 I see your appointment . What day would you like to switch to ? 
 What time would you like ? 
 Fine , I will pencil that in right now . We will see you then . 
 Well , we just got in some mangoes . 
 Well , it's a fruit with a big nut in it . 
 No , you peel off the skin and throw out the nut . 
 Well , the sale price is $ 1 each . 
 They're like a citrus fruit . 
 You can buy them hard . Wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel . 
 Most of them in this store are from Mexico . 
 What ? 
 Is it ? 
 Let me see your form . You mentioned that you want five days to go back home for New Year , right ? 
 Do you still remember we already have a New Year celebration on January 1st ? 
 Well , I understand that . Your request is approved . Remember to give my best regards to your parents . 
 Good news ! And congratulations ! 
 Thank you . I'll certainly be there . 
 I didn't hear that . But I can deduce the reason . 
 Tom is a kind guy , but addicted to gambling . He spends all his time gambling in the casino . And his wife can't put up with his incessant gambling any longer , so she divorced him . Is that right ? 
 Yeah ! Gambling is often a curse . By gambling we lose time and treasure , two things most precious to a man . 
 In a word , gambling is a vice . We should be away from it . 
 En , I am looking for a porter , do you know where I can find one ? 
 What's the charge ? 
 Thank you . 
 Just a moment , sir . Let me check the reservation list . Sorry , I'm afraid we're fully booked tonight . Would you like to make a reservation some other time ? 
 Yes , the same service and food as in the evening . 
 OK . Your name , please ? 
 Good . Thank you very much . 
 I'd like to buy a watch . 
 Well , I'm not sure . Let's see . How much is this one ? 
 Oh . I don't think I can afford that . How about this one ? 
 Wow . That's too much for me . Don't you have anything cheaper ? 
 Sure it is . I am up to my ears as time expressed . 
 If we were in the same conference room , I would not work late these days . That conference room has been booked out . This time our boss wants to hold the meeting in our company . So everything has to be rearranged and checked , like tables , chairs , mean tacks , podium , audio and visual equipments and even the lunch menu . 
 Marquet , do you think I should enroll in the science course ? 
 Right , I figure since you are doing premedical , you know about the very courses . 
 Yes , I'm really weak in maps , I did poorly in high school . 
 When will the ceremony begin ? 
 No idea . 
 Doesn't she have any friends ? 
 Such friends are even worse than enemies . 
 Can you tell me where the supply shop is ? 
 Great ! Thanks a lot ! 
 You stay beside me ; I'll fry the meat in the oil first . 
 Er , I am gonna go with salt and sauce ! 
 Is there anything wrong ? 
 Hello , Mary . 
 Yes , it is ! 
 The same to you ! 
 We're having some friends over.What are you doing ? 
 I saw a vacancy board outside for assistant . Has the vacancy been filled ? 
 Yes . I have a lot of experience in that . I have worked for the sales company as an assistant since finishing my university . 
 You don ’ t look so good . 
 Did you eat something strange ? 
 Maybe you have food poisoning . 
 Are you under a lot of stress ? 
 Maybe you have a touch of the flu . 
 You are friend of Janet , right ? I am Andrew , Andrew Smith . 
 I'm sorry , I didn't quite catch that . 
 This is the end , Jane . I don't want a girlfriend who goes out with other guys all the time . 
 No way . I've given you too many chances already . 
 Why not ? See . 
 Oh , great ! It's delicious . You see , I am already putting on weight . There is one thing I don't like however , MSG . 
 According to some studies it may cause cancer . 
 I just happen to have a question for you guys . Why do the Chinese cook the vegetables ? You see what I mean is that most vitamin are destroyed when heated . 
 How much does it cost to rent a mid-size car ? 
 Fine . I'd like to reserve one for next Tuesday . 
 Yes . It's right here . 
 Speaking of classical music , we should never forget about the New Year's Concert of the Vienna Philharmonic . 
 Sure . It's one of the biggest classical music events . Have you ever been to the live show ? 
 Wow , you're so lucky . I saw it on TV . But it must be so different to be there in the concert hall . 
 Can you loan me fifty dollars until pay day ? 
 Thank you just the same . 
 I'd like to withdraw some money . 
 All right . And here's my bankbook . Is that all ? 
 Oh , yes . Here it is . 
 Four in hundred , one in ten , please . 
 By the way , I'd like to change some U . S . dollars to pounds and I want to know today's exchange rate . 
 I want 100 pounds . And here are 189 U . S . dollars . 
 Thank you . And goodbye . 
 Hey Joanne . What are you up to ? 
 I'm so bored . I don't know what I'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning . 
 I don't think we are boring . It's just that we don't have any hobbies . 
 That all depends on what you like to do . For example , I like to doodle on the notepad , so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings . 
 Yeah . That can be a good hobby . 
 That's a great idea . I'm going to do the same . 
 Five and a half years . We moved here on the first of November . 
 Yes . I love living here . 
 Yes . It ’ s a lovely view . 
 Good morning , I have an appointment with Mr . Johnson at 10:00 
 Yes . That ’ s right . 
 Well , I ’ ll wait . 
 Thank you . Coffee , please . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Dear , don ’ t worry . The police can help you . 
 Just a moment , please , while I check . That's correct.You have a double room on the fifth floor . 
 What would you like to have ? 
 In that case , what about having some noodles ? 
 All right . I'll cook for you . 
 Is that OK ? 
 Well , I think we'd better go now . We have to follow the guide . 
 do you have internet in your room ? 
 really ? What do you usually do online ? 
 I never chatted online before . What's it like . 
 really ? Who do you chat with ? 
 that's amazing . I will install an online messenger program when I get home . 
 don't worry . 
 Where did you find this apartment ? 
 Really ? I can ’ t believe you actually found an apartment in the ads . 
 I want to hear more about this apartment . 
 How much will you have to pay for rent ? 
 For where we live , that is really inexpensive . 
 I ’ m glad to hear that you finally found an apartment . 
 I know , I ’ m really sorry that I missed the deadline . But really , it wasn ’ t my fault . You see , we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute , and that I couldn ’ t get into the database and extract the kind of information that I needed for the data analysis . You know , if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the ARM stable , then I wouldn ’ t have missed my deadline . 
 No , I ’ m not trying to pass the buck here ; I know that it was me who is ultimately responsible for getting this done . But the thing is , I could have finished on time if the system hadn ’ t gone down . And you know , with everything I ’ Ve got going on now , I can ’ t afford to waste time dealing with technical problems . I ’ Ve got a lot on my plate and there are only twenty-four hours in a day ... 
 Is the new computerised stock system in operation ? 
 Have all the operators been trained on it ? 
 Where's Tom this evening ? 
 Really ! What's the matter with him ? 
 Tell him I was asking about him . 
 But this place doesn't feel like a forty-ping apartment . 
 Oh ! The view is great ! Mountains , fresh air ! Stars ? 
 And we could get a dog ! 
 Well , fish it will be then . 
 Sorry , I can't . I have to work late at the laboratory . 
 My boss wants me to finish this project tonight . 
 Chinese , maths , English , chemistry , physics , biology and so on . 
 To be honest , I like most of them , except for my Chinese teacher . She is quite young , but her class is too boring ! 
 Yes , my oral English teacher is an American . He is from a small town in California . 
 He is great . He always tells us not to study for exams , and to pay more attention to communication rather than just memorizing . 
 Not everything , but nearly . He speaks very clearly . 
 Absolutely ! If you come to our class , I am sure you will like him . 
 I'll be back late tonight . 
 I have a meeting with my General Manager . 
 Here you are . 
 Sightseeing . 
 Nine days . 
 Mrs . Montgomery ? I ’ Ve been trying to figure out when we should have the New Year ’ s party . Could you take a book at these dates ? 
 Well , why don ’ t we make it the thirtieth ? We can set it up from three to five . That way , everybody can just go home afterwards . 
 Julia and Anne have both taken dance lessons.They want to be famous dancer , I think . 
 I don't see much difference , anyway . 
 Okay . I'll just be a minute . 
 I didn't sleep much last night . 
 You know Miao Li-my roommate , he bought a computer last month . He has turned his computer into an electronic playground . He plays football , rides horses , drives racing cars , and does a whole bunch of other games . Every night he keeps me up . 
 I usually get a lot of information on the computer and use E-mail to send messages to my friends . 
 Don't you think it's a sheer waste of both time and money ? 
 Yes . 
 I ’ m returning a book . 
 I also need to check out this video . 
 Just the video . 
 I have it right here . 
 I will . 
 I get it . Thank you . 
 Yes . I have just got lost with my firiend.Can you page my friend for me ? 
 Here is his passport.Thank you very much . 
 Oh no . I broke your vase accidentally . 
 I bumped it by accident , but I didn't mean to do it . 
 I feel miserable . Can I give you money for it ? 
 First I was late for school this morning , and now I broke your vase . This isn't my day ! 
 I'm afraid I have lost my ticket . Can I buy one again ? 
 I'm going to Nanchang . 
 At Huangshan . 
 And by the way , what time shall we get to Nanchang ? 
 Thanks . 
 Of course . It's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . Don't you like watching it ? 
 That's true . For various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics . You know , the low temperature may cause many problems . 
 When the Olympic Games started in modern times , only summer events were included . When it grew popular , there came the Winter Olympic Games , which includes a variety of winter sports . 
 Figure skating . In my eye , nothing beats it . 
 Oh , I didn't expect you to know them . But yes , I love them not only because of many medals they've won , but also because of many medals they've won , but also because of their spirits . 
 Good morning . 
 I ’ m sorry She isn ’ t in at the momment.She will come back at half past nineCan I take a message for her ? 
 OK.Goodbye . 
 How have you been feeling lately ? 
 Has your blood pressure been high before ? 
 Usually people with high blood pressure have no symptoms , so we call it the silent killer . 
 I am going to put a cuff on you to get a reading . 
 I get an idea of the pressure in your arteries when your heart is pumping blood versus at rest . 
 What a surprise meeting you here , Landy . 
 It ’ s a small world , isn ’ t it ? 
 Tell me , what do you enjoy doing in your spare time ? 
 You know how to draw and paint ? 
 When did you learn how to do that ? 
 Oh , so you took an art class ? 
 I see that you're pretty talented . 
 I wish I had a talent like that . 
 I just won the lottery . 
 Can I ask you a question ? 
 How do you get along with the American students in your classes ? 
 Really ? Why not ? Don ’ t you go up and talk to them ? 
 You won ’ t get anywhere that way . You ’ re the one who needs to practice English , so you should make the first move . Besides , most American students are really friendly and outgoing . They will be glad to talk to you . 
 I think my car can run much faster than yours . 
 That's true . 
 I'm in a really good mood , actually . How about you ? 
 what's wrong ? 
 that's too bad . I'm sure there's a logical explanation for it . Don't be too upset about it . 
 I see how that can get a bit annoying . 
 so what are you going to do about it ? 
 what do you think would make you happier ? 
 relationships can be confusing sometimes . 
 I'd call him and dump him now ! You deserve better than him ! 
 We are playing against Hainan . 
 Sure they are . 
 We are , 27 to 26 . 
 How can it be ? We are a tough team as well . 
 My name is Zhang Ming.Nice to meet you , Susan . 
 I come from China.Are you American ? 
 Business management 
 I wonder who that man is . 
 The one smoking a cigar . 
 I ’ d like to be fitted for a suit please . 
 Well , I thought that I would choose either this one or that one . I really want a dark blue suit . Which do you recommend . 
 Yes . I can feel the difference in material . There ’ s not much difference in price . Ok , I ’ ll take the more expensive one . 
 That ’ s fine . I would also like a few shirts and a jacket . I don ’ t need them specially made . Those shirts over there look very nice . Are they made of cotton ? 
 I ’ ll take three light blue ones , please . 
 Just a casual one - a sport jacket . This one looks nice . I ’ ll just try it on ... yes , that ’ s fine . I ’ ll take it . Here ’ s my credit card . 
 Thank you very much . I ’ ll see you the day after tomorrow . 
 What's the criteria for staff to attend ? Are we only including our management team in this affair ? Or will we be extending invitations to lower level employees to attend ? 
 Actually , I was wondering what we should do if either one of us would like to terminate the contract ? 
 I got it , but nevertheless . what I was saying just now was that how to terminate the contract before its term's up ? 
 That sounds perfect for us . 
 Yes , where's it to , madam ? 
 You want to send it airmail , madam ? 
 I hear you are expecting your family . 
 I didn't know you had a brother . 
 Oh , nice . Is he coming on his own or with the family ? 
 Does your brother have just one son ? 
 I'm sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson . 
 So when are they all coming ? 
 Your dog is so much fun . He ’ s so playful . I wish our cat enjoyed being around people as much as your dog does . 
 She ’ s eight years old . She ’ s getting quite old . Your dog ’ s six , isn ’ t he ? 
 I ’ m sure he would . We usually have to drag him home . 
 She spends less time outdoors and she used to . we have no idea where she goes . She ’ s very secretive . Occasionally , she brings back a dead mouse . 
 The kids want a rabbit . I don ’ t think it would be a good idea to get a mouse or a fish ! That might be too tempting for our cat ! 
 Yup . I have English at 9 in the morning . 
 Not really . What about you ? 
 Sure . I need to return some books . They are due today . Besides , I can also read some weekly publications , magazines and newspapers . 
 That sounds like a good idea . We can chill out a little in such a hot summer . Are you good at swimming ? 
 Oh , it's almost 9 . I need to hurry . I am running late now . See you after class in front of the library then . Bye ! 
 Can I help you ? 
 Ok , would you like a phone with camera and MP3 player ? 
 Good afternoon . What service do you require ? 
 For what purpose exactly , if you don't mind me asking ? I must ask because I need to know the size , you see . 
 What a lovely gift . Yes , I can understand why you wouldn't be comfortable keeping something so valuable at home . I think one of our small ones will be perfect . Do you have some ID with you ? 
 Certainly , just fill in this form , please . 
 How did you get that ? No need to show you my hand , I lose.This is not as much fun as the music concert we just saw . 
 They're quite popular now . Wasn't her voice good ? 
 Janet Jackson is more pop music.Shania sings country music . Celine just seems to hit all the right notes . 
 Yes , l have two of her Cds , l'II lend them to you if you like . 
 I hope you have a good stereo . 
 Because you have to hear it really loud to get the full concert effect . 
 Coffee , please . 
 Coke is fine.Thank you . 
 I would like to check out these books . 
 Yes . Here you go . 
 I do ? 
 Exactly how much do I owe ? 
 I won ’ t be able to pay that right now . 
 I will pay it . Don ’ t worry . 
 Very well . We started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done . The only thing that isn ’ t ready yet is my wedding dress . 
 The dressmakers said that is would be ready in two weeks . 
 Yes . We ’ Ve taken care of all of that . We decided not to get married in a church though . Neither of us is very religious . 
 The palace hotel they ’ re taking care of the catering , including the wedding cake . I ’ m sure they ’ ll do a good job . 
 Yes . It will be expensive , but we think it will be worth it . It gives us great peace of mind to know that our reception is in the hands of experienced people . 
 Hello , Pam . 
 It looks like there are a lot of people inside . 
 Should I take my shoes off ? 
 Where are your parents ? 
 That's great ! 
 Out of the frying pan and into the fire . 
 She's going to kill you . 
 Eight to twelve in the morning , two to six in the afternoon . 
 What are your hours ? 
 Which is your preference , tea or coffee ? 
 When did you form this hobby ? 
 I'd like to see that pen , please . 
 No , the other one in the brown case . 
 May I try it ? 
 It's very smooth . I'll take it . 
 Charge , please . 
 Have you just started getting a lot of headaches ? 
 Have you had any unusually stressful situations in your life lately ? 
 I ’ m sorry . How about sleep ? Are you getting enough rest ? 
 Have you bumped your head or fallen lately ? 
 I am going to send you to a neurologist for a few tests . 
 You don't really believe in all that hocus pocus mumbo jumbo , do you ? 
 Of course it does ! They tell you general and obvious things like that you will be successful or have a big house . I think most of the times they are just scam artists . 
 All superstitious nonsense ! I would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say , just for kicks . 
 Indeed , it is . 
 It's really a surprise . 
 Let's change the subject . 
 I'd like to see some coats . Would you recommend me some of them ? 
 Which models do you sell the most ? 
 I like this style , but I don't like its color . Do you have this coat in yellow ? 
 It looks nice . 
 Daniel , what are you doing here ? Aren't you supposed to be at school now ? 
 Well , we shall make it a secret between us . 
 She is the cheer-leader . They are required to put on a performance . Look ! Here they come . 
 I want to be like her . 
 Hey , young man ! I'm your sis . Don't talk to me like that . 
 Boy , you've got such a crush on her , haven't you ? 
 Are you out of your mind ? 
 Go ahead , have a try and be a joke . 
 They're my family 
 Yes , I'm the third child . 
 I got rid of that clunker . This is my new one . 
 Jump in , I'll give you a ride . 
 Yeah , it costed a bundle alright . 
 Yeah , this sucker is the fastest thing I've ever owned . 
 We are on the high way . I'm the * * . 
 It's a great feeling . 
 Thanks , Daisy . 
 Oh it was really good . Do you know , he ’ s the nicest boss I ’ Ve had here . 
 What ’ s more , he said I was the hardest working person in the office ! 
 I hope so . Then I ’ ll be the happiest person in our office too ! 
 Yes , I just bought new car , I drive to work everyday ! 
 Sure , I see safety is most important thing ! Accident is awful ! I will take your advice ! 
 Yes , definitely ! You can't drive freely ! 
 Compare with speaking , yes ! But things are not good as you expecting ! 
 Can you see that road side help ? 
 That's right . We have to slow down again . If we haven't meet the passing tree , we have to stop a car away . 
 There are a plenty of signs such as Watch for children ! 
 Did Mr . Lin put you in charge of marketing ? 
 Where will it be ? 
 Is it because of trade negotiations that we can start selling in the U . S . ? 
 Great . 
 You seem excited about it . 
 Do you honestly think we can compete though ? All the computer giants are there . 
 The company will have to choose a good advertising firm.And then there's the problem of quality.How do we convince American buyers that our quality is good ? 
 Well , I hope it all works out , John . I think if you're part of the team , things will go well.But you know we'd all miss you here . So I won't say I'm happy to think that you're leaving . 
 Me ? No way . I'm dedicated to the company , but I'm not going to leave Taiwan . I'm happy here . 
 How to adjust ? 
 Ah , some products are successful at home , but not be popular overseas . 
 Yes , sometimes the differences are great . 
 We have to ensure that the product should be attractive to guarantee sales . 
 Hi . 
 I'm good . How are you ? 
 A little . Are you American ? 
 Where are you from ? 
 Nice to meet you . 
 I feel I work harder when I am under pressure . 
 What can I do for you , Miss ? 
 Well , here is a perfume kind for women . 
 How about this Isawell's flowery perfume ? 
 Do you have green tea perfume ? 
 May I have a look at this ? 
 I like this fragrance . 
 150 yuan . 
 I'm so hungry ! I haven't late eaten all day ! 
 They're all so thin ! Her cheekbones are great . 
 The mag says she's 165 centimeters tall and 38 kilos . If only we could be that thin then ... 
 Oh , bathroom blues . 
 I went to try it on yesterday , but it only came in extra small . 
 ( Weigh herself ) Hey , I lost a kilo in a week with my all-fruit diet . If I keep going , I can wear that dress next month . 
 Dieting . It's the price we pay to make men notice us . 
 They're also way younger than us . 
 You never worked out ? 
 I'm going to the bank . 
 I need to withdraw some money . 
 I'll just use the ATM . 
 It's the Automatic Teller Machine . 
 I just insert my debit card into the machine . 
 Well , it gives me money , but it's my own money . 
 Hello . Gail Willows speaking . 
 Hello , Daniel . What can I do for you ? 
 Oh , really ? Do you know which company it's from ? 
 Ah , great ! I'll send someone over to pick it up . Thanks for calling . 
 Sure . Where are you ? 
 What kind of car ? 
 Where are you going to ? 
 You are within 50 kilometers , so it's a 50 - dollar flat rate . 
 About 20 to 30 minutes . 
 Hello , I am Richard from the Brooks Head-hunter company . Can I have a private talk with you ? 
 Sure . Hi , Monica , Richard again . Have you ever heard about our company ? It is an international one with good reputation . We have a lot of successful cases . If you ’ re trying advance your career , I would love to help you . XYZ Company is one of our clients . They ’ re in need of the talent like you . Would you be interested in taking part in an interview ? It is scheduled some time within this week . 
 Ok , I see . Good luck to you . You have my number . Call me when you change your mind . I can send you more detailed information about company and jobs you might be interested in if you give me your private e-mail address . 
 You ’ re welcome . Bye . 
 It ’ s too loud . 
 Well , you know , those styles or colors don ’ t suit me . 
 I want to buy a V-neck checked sweater , and it should be tight . 
 Quiet color . 
 Really ? Let ’ s go there . 
 Oh , very beautiful . Thank you , Steven , I like it very much . 
 My birthday present ? I can't help telling you that I am a happy woman , darling . I will come back soon . ( Go to her bedroom and wear the new dress , then show it to Steven . ) 
 It displays your slender figure , darling . 
 Because you are my dear wife . 
 Oh , hey ... 
 Actually , my office is right around the corner . 
 Yeah , yeah , it was really interesting . You know , I'm in a bit of a hurry , but here ’ s my card . We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion . 
 You know what , this is really embarrassing , but your name has just slipped my mind . Can you remind me ? 
 Hello , Sir . We haven't seen you for quite a while . So , what is it today that we can do for you ? 
 I see , yes , I can do that now . I'm sure you know , as I may have told you before , you should pay an extra 20 RIB handling fee for this service . 
 I can just take it from your account , you don't need to give me cash . 
 Anything else you'll be needing today , Sir ? 
 Good morning . 
 Yes , we do . How can I help ? I can give you a simple introduction , if you'd like ? 
 We usually recommend our clients buy US Dollar Traveller's Cheques , as they can be exchanged for local currency all over the world . They are certainly the most versatile . 
 As soon as you purchase your Traveller's Cheques from us , you are covered . No matter if you lose them or they are stolen , we will replace them promptly . All we ask is for you to write down the reference number of each cheque and keep it in a safe place away from the actual cheques . We will need that number if you need to make a claim . 
 Hi , Daisy ! 
 I hope you are Settling in at school ! 
 Good ! Me too ! By the way . you didn't tell me what you are studying here . 
 Really ? That's great . You hope to join a company after graduating ? 
 What about your friend Zoe 
 Accountancy ? Really ? She must be very good at figures . 
 I'm studying law . 
 Sure , welcome anytime 
 Yes . I love it , too . 
 I'm not sure , but I think it must be directed by Zhang You . That's typical of him . 
 What a great idea ! 
 I like the mountain idea , but I am not so sure about the month of January . 
 April might be nice . It is far enough away to make the necessary arrangements . 
 We could ask everyone what would be the best time for them . 
 I'll put the survey online this afternoon . 
 I've told you a thousand times . I don't want to go in the Haunted House.It ' s too scary ! 
 Go alone if you want . I will wait at that cafe and have a soda . 
 I know . But if you don't go in the Haunted House , you won't be happy.So I will wait for you . It's no problem . 
 How was it ? 
 Don't worry about it . But how was it ? 
 Everything is great , Tad . How are you ? 
 Tad , I'm pretty hungry right now . Want to walk over and check out the food table ? 
 That is Mary . I heard that she's just moved in with Lee . 
 Oh , that relationship is history . Malia hooked up with a guy she met on holiday . 
 Actually , he was OK with it . They hadn't been getting along too well . 
 He never came . 
 I wouldn ’ t exactly characterize it in that way . I think something happened . Something terrible and unexpected that made it impossible for him to ... what if he showed up , took one look at me and left ? 
 Maybe , there was a subway accident . 
 A train got trapped underground with him inside . 
 And you know , how those express trains create suction . 
 Just take it easy . If he starts to bother you , let me know and I'll call security . 
 Don't get all worked up over him . He's probably harmless . 
 You never know . Maybe he's just an innocent , lonely guy ... 
 OK ! I'll call security . 
 Yes . You could use five or six units.But five or six wouldn't be very efficient . I recommend seven . 
 Let me calculate the price for you . I can give you a 15 % discount if you buy the seven units.Let ' s see here . Your total would be 5929 dollars . 
 As I said , it is possible , but it would be much more expensive . I think it would be at least 12000 dollars to do a complete system . 
 It's more practical , and the new units really are very quiet.Your customers won't even notice them . 
 Yes , that's for the units.Installation would probably be another 700 to 1000 dollars.But it depends on the time spent , of course . 
 No , Ma'am . Installation isn't included.The price I quoted was just for the units . 
 I know that , Ma'am . But they would just raise the price of the units to cover their costs.Here in L . A . , installation is charged separately . 
 I understand , Ma'am . 
 It's a question of quality , Ma'am . At that price , you would not get good equipment . I've been in this business for almost twenty years . I know what happens.If you don't get quality air conditioning now , you will just have to replace the system after two years . 
 Well . 
 Well , we don't usually do it , but ... I believe we can accommodate you on this.We will do the installation for free . Because we appreciate your business . 
 Oh , it's getting late . I've got to run . It was nice talking to you , karren . 
 I guess we'll see just around . 
 You too . 
 Oh , Henry , I haven't seen you for ages . Come in . Let me take your coat . How are you getting along ? 
 Please take a seat . Everything would be ready in a minute . 
 Here you are . Here you go . We have cocktail and salad , fried chicken , French fries and icecream for dessert . Eating chicken while it's hot . it tastes better . 
 Here you are . Taste the French fries . 
 Would you like some more ? 
 Here is to our friendship and health ! 
 Song , I hate to say goodbye , but I have to . 
 Let's keep in touch . 
 Mr . Simpson , if you are free , how about a lunch ? 
 How about Thursday ? 
 I know of a place you'll like and you have got to be there . 
 OK , see you then . 
 Now let me tell you your definite duties in this office and this is your desk . Please sit down . 
 B , your main duty is to answer phone calls and transfer files to the person who wants them . Is that difficult ? 
 Well . I have nearly forgotten . Mr Green from ABC Company had an appointment with me , but I will be very busy at that time . If he calls , you can tell him the appointment will be changed to next week . 
 Laura told me today that she has a friend with a car for sale . 
 Yes , it's used , but she said it was in very good shape . It's a small foreign car . 
 She thinks it has about twenty-five or thirty thousand miles . 
 Three thousand dollars . 
 He lives in the city and you know how expensive it is to keep a car in the city . 
 No , but she gave me her friend's telephone number . I can call him and make an appointment . 
 I don't think drinking requires any special purposes . For us people in the West , the purpose is generally quite simple-to savor the wine . 
 And to make matters worse , you're urged to drink " one more cup time and again.There is too much etiquette to observe . You'II be set free at a Western banquet It seems we are keen to make it convenient as possible to savor the wine , its color , its aroma and its delicate taste . 
 Yes . For me , who can't hold much liquor , it's particularly agreeable . If only I had thechance to enjoy Chinese Matai at a leisured pace while sitting at a Western banquet ! 
 If the goods are to be transshipped from one means of transportation to another during the course of the entire voyage , it's called ' combined transportation ' . 
 It's simpler and cheaper to arrange multi-model combined transportation . 
 I major in Chemistry . 
 Organic Chemistry is my specialty . 
 I got my father ’ s goat last night . 
 When I asked him to treat me like he does to my sisters , he jumped down my throat . So I took it out on him by telling him what I thought . 
 I think so , too . Our only request is that the quality is in conformity with the contract stipulations . 
 But what will you do if the goods we receive are not standard ? 
 That's great . 
 What can I do for you , Kim ? 
 Sure , anytime . 
 There are three , my parents and I . 
 No , I live alone in a flat near my work place . 
 Yes , almost once a week . 
 How nice ! Are you going to convert some RIB to US dollars ? 
 How can you cash them when you arrive in the United States ? 
 It sounds quite simple . Next time when I travel abroad , I will apply for this kind of check too . 
 So ? 
 You mean finally Henry bought the broken car himself . 
 I ’ m sure it will be wet when we arrive . 
 It will be Sunday so I expected everything will be closed . 
 But the bank should be closed so we shouldn't to be able to get some money . 
 Do you think we ’ ll need our overcoats ? 
 Why not ? 
 Is that very likely in England ? 
 The trouble is not that . It is that he may suddenly remember something I promised him a couple of weeks ago , out of a clear blue sky . Then he complains that I have gone back on my words . 
 He never does , and in fact , he seldom communicates with him . 
 Yes , I did . He only takes side with him . He seldom asks what Dick is doing . 
 I want to have a haircut . 
 How much is a regular haircut without shampoo ? 
 And how much for haircut with shampoo ? 
 Since it is , I need a haircut with shampoo . 
 SEEK , please . 
 What hairstyle do you feel will look best on me ? 
 I have the same idea as you . 
 That's over on Callaway Street , isn't it ? 
 Walk that way for about four blocks . The hotel's about two blocks north of there . 
 Not at all . 
 I got it a while ago , but I haven't worn it much . You really like it ? 
 It's white gold . 
 My boyfriend took me to the Shane Co . and he let me pick it out . 
 That's the best part . It wasn't for anything special . He just wanted to buy me something . 
 My birthday is coming up . We'll find out pretty soon . 
 I wouldn't mind a necklace . I was at the jewelry shop looking around , and they have a couple of beautiful necklaces I want . 
 I don't think I'm ready for a ring from him yet . 
 Akha . 
 What time are you going ? 
 Well , good-bye and have a good trip ! 
 Where can I get my baggage ? 
 An international one from Seattle . 
 Oh yes , I see the sign , thank you . 
 Do you want to send it by airmail or by surface mail ? 
 About five weeks . 
 Just a moment . I'll weigh it . 
 There are many famous resorts in Egypt . You can have a good time here . 
 I'm afraid two days isn't enough for you to see all the places of interest . 
 If I were you , the pyramid would be my first choice . It's so magnificent . 
 You needn't worry about it . There are many stores at the scenic spots . I'm sure you can get what you want . 
 I got a ninety-five on my test . 
 Excuse me ! What time is it ? My watch stopped . 
 Is your watch right ? 
 By the way , can you tell me what the date it is today , and what day it is , please ? 
 so , how should we go to the theatre ? 
 I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you . 
 it wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus . 
 train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too . 
 we're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi . 
 fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives . 
 don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you . 
 see , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip ! 
 You mean the network connection ? 
 I have the same question . I can ’ t send out mails . We ’ d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately . 
 May I help you ? 
 How do you want to send it ? 
 Is there anything valuable ? 
 They are fragile articles . They must be packed in a proper strong box . Your light cardboard box won't do . 
 Yes . 
 Yes . Now fill in two customs declarations and one despatch note in English . You'll have to take your parcel to the next window for examination when you have completed the forms . 
 Have you written down your return address ? 
 It's almost midnight ! We are about to start a brand new year ! 
 Do you have a New Year's resolution ? 
 Yeah I know what you mean . That's why this year I am keeping things more simple . Maybe like getting together with friends I haven't seen in a long time , or doing some volunteering work . 
 Sure , as long as you don't try to kiss me at midnight ! 
 Good morning . Sanyu Restaurant . May I help you ? 
 We open at 6:30 , sir . 
 Yes , sir . What time would you like your table , sir ? 
 Fine ! I'll reserve a table for two at 8 pm , sir . May I have your name , please ? 
 Thank you , Mr . Davis . 
 I see . We have already received many bookings and though I can't guarantee anything , please be assured that we'll try our best , Mr . Davis . I hope you'll understand . 
 We'll try our best . 
 Is there a doctor here ? 
 Can you call an Ambulance ? 
 Here comes the last course ! Shall I help you to the dish ? 
 But I can't resist a good dinner . 
 much better than it did yesterday . 
 I not only passed my test , but I aced it ! I'm so happy ! 
 thanks for helping me with it . If you hadn't encouraged me to do my best , I wouldn't have ever been able to pass . 
 did you always do well at school ? 
 really ? 
 I'll get my finals in two months . 
 most students just cram the night forehead . 
 no , I think I should study a little bit at a time , starting a few weeks before the exam . 
 I'll go and talk to my professor or a learning support assistant . 
 Excuse me.Could you please tell me where the train station is ? 
 Mark is parade his knowledge again . 
 A well-learned person never does that . 
 Yes . I'll have a room free next week . 
 12,000 yuan a year , but you can't have visitors live in it . 
 Could you come back later ? We're right in the middle of dinner . 
 Yes , of course.When ? 
 Now let me check my schedule ... OK , you could to my office then . 
 Yes , I'd like to have a roast chicken leg . 
 No . 
 No , enough . 
 Waiter , come back . 
 It's not too salty . 
 Waiter , come back again . 
 Not too rare . 
 Why do you come back again ? 
 What's that ? 
 Thanks , thanks a lot and thanks a million . 
 I can't forget about this when next time . 
 Excited ? What's there to be excited about ? It's just another company dinner , right ? 
 Really ? What kind of prizes ? 
 A new car ! You're kidding ! 
 Wear red underwear ? ! Does that really work ? Are you going to try it ? 
 Gee , I don't think I own any red underwear , but I can buy some ! 
 Yeah.He never stops asking questions . 
 By the way , where's Jim ? 
 This bus goes all the way to Santa Anita mall , right ? 
 Are you positive ? 
 How long is this bus ride ? 
 Where do we get off at ? 
 There's a stop right next to the mall ? 
 That's cool . 
 I am not convinced by your explanation . Could you explain it ? 
 I can't accept your excuse . It's five o'clock . 
 Ok , sounds good . But I think it's your trick . 
 It's us . 
 Well , you always say you're busy . 
 And you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself . 
 Oh I remember , I cut terrible calls , and you didn't say anything about it . 
 Totally not . Perhaps it's about our marriage . 
 Sure . Just leave it to me . I'll finish it . 
 I like it . It makes the city feel alive . I like all the different colors and I like the billboards with eye-catching pictures and slogans . 
 I see your point , but if companies didn ’ t spend money on advertising , no one would hear about their products . I agree that some form of advertising can be annoying . I don ’ t like it when people try to give you leaflets with information about products you have no intention of buying . 
 Yes , that annoys me too . With billboards , you can look away , but with broadcasts , you can ’ t avoid them . I like the way that advertising agencies use comedy in their campaign . 
 That kind of advertising seems to be very common with brand name products . They are always trying to maintain brand loyalty . 
 I want a pair of locus . 
 I need size 41 . 
 Christmas Day is coming . I want to buy several postcards to send to my family and friends . Can you recommend me some ? 
 These postcards are great . I want to buy a dozen with different pictures . 
 How much is a postcard ? 
 OK . Here is the money . Thank you very much . 
 Honey , do you know what color the carrot is ? 
 Wow , my son is so clever . 
 Really ? 
 Oh , my son looks like a grown-up . 
 No kidding . So tell me what's your favorite color ? 
 Why ? 
 OK , superman . Put on your cape , we are going to fly home . 
 I'm sorry , but I don't think so . 
 Well , there's a department store on Grant Street . There are restrooms in the basement . 
 Between Second and Third Streets . The store is across from the hotel . 
 You're welcome . 
 Do you want to bet ? 
 No , I don't think we have . 
 How do you do ? Mr . Brown . I am Susan Heywood . 
 Really ? I am glad to meet you . 
 I think it might be a good idea to work as a guide . 
 Three Gorges of the Yangtze River . 
 What's wrong with you ? 
 I really recommend you go for a run in the morning . 
 On the contrary ! It really refreshes you and gets you ready to attack the day . 
 Yes , I often feel like a million dollars after work , like I can take on anything . 
 Did you read this ? It says that the number one new years resolution make is to spend more time with friends and family . 
 Well , think about it . We are a society that is always on the go , not because we have to , but because we want to . 
 We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary . 
 What ’ s the point ? We always make a new year ’ s resolution and by February we will have forgotten about it . It ’ s pointless . 
 What about you ? Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in . 
 Yeah , yeah , whatever . 
 I come from England . 
 It's mild , but it's not always pleasant.The weather's often cold in the North and windy in the East . It's often wet in the West and sometimes warm in the South . 
 I like spring and summer . The days are long and the nights are short . The sun rises early and sets late . I don't like autumn and winter . The days are short and the nights are long . The sun rises late 
 How do you do ? My name is John White . 
 The pleasure is all mine . 
 I'm just browsing , thanks . 
 Well , how about fifty percent discount ? If so , I'll buy that fur coat . 
 So won ’ t you come down any more ? 
 I would love to rent this apartment . 
 How much are you asking for every month ? 
 That is quite a lot of money for just one month . 
 What do you say to $ 850 a month ? 
 It ’ s either $ 850 or nothing at all . 
 Could you please go lower ? 
 I've come to say goodbye . 
 I'm catching the eleven o'clock train . 
 Goodbye . Hope to see you again next year . 
 What is your favorite color , miss ? 
 Here you are.It ' s very attractive . 
 Go ahead . 
 Right over there . 
 Yes , you look very nice . 
 We're having a clearance sale . $ 4 plus tax . 
 I want to buy some cloth to make a curtain . Which one is better ? 
 What about the cotton one ? 
 This is the good life ! We have it good don ’ t you think ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 For example ? 
 I see . Yeah now that I think of it , I wouldn ’ t have gotten married if I hadn ’ t moved to this town and met Sally . 
 Well , I have no regrets ! 
 Have you heard about the robbery ? 
 For real ? 
 What went down ? 
 Are you serious ? 
 Tell me what else happened . 
 Did the cops get him ? 
 Mr.Sellers ? It's Steven speaking , your tenant . We've just suffered a power failure.What should I do now ? 
 Yes , I do . 
 How do I know if it's blown out ? 
 Then what shall I do ? 
 OK , I'll try . I'll call you again if that doesn't work . 
 That movie's just a lot of noise , same as Simon . 
 I had to go by myself , he couldn't make it . 
 Kitty's ? He sure gets around , doesn't he ? 
 His excuse was familiar . He said his car died again . 
 I know . Last week he gave me a lie about being too busy . 
 Well , I think it's the time to pull the plug . 
 Thanks anyway , but I'll do it , Rebecca . Let's get the class . 
 Your price is rather out of line , much higher than we expected . We can't buy with your offer . 
 When we say your prices are much too high , we don't mean the are higher only by 2 or 3 percent . If we are to place an order with you . I think a discount of about 15 % would be sufficient . 
 There's no point in making a counter offer because the gap is too great . 
 Ok . I can settle for that . 
 everything's great . I've just returned from my office . 
 sure I am . I work for myself , but I've rented a virtual office at an office building in the downtown area . 
 yeah , an office that runs efficiently by using nothing other than online communication technologies . I pay the rent and share office services with others in the same building . 
 a separated office , internet access , phone services , fax services , mail & courier services , and almost everything you have in a conventional office . 
 I get a business address at an expensive location , and I can share the receptionist and secretary with other offices in the same floor . 
 you bet it ! 
 we need lots of things . I ’ ll make a list . We need a bag of sugar , a loaf of bread and a crate of beer . 
 just joking . I would like to get a few bottles of beer though . We also need a liter of cooking oil . 
 I ’ d like to get a jar of strawberry jam and a bottle of tomato ketchup . Do we need any meat ? 
 ok . Let ’ s not forget fruit and vegetables . We need a bunch of bananas , a kilo of tomatoes and a bag of potatoes . 
 ok . We should get a few tins of tuna . Anything else ? 
 let ’ s get a chunk of cheese too . Is that everything . 
 Ouch ! The water's too hot ! 
 I'm not hungry , Mom . 
 Oh ... I'm sweating already . It's so hot . I can feel it boiling ! Can I get out yet ? 
 I want to say ... 
 That I can't go on any longer without you . 
 Nancy , I made up my mind you were the only woman for me at the first sight . 
 Forgive me for startling you with the impetuosity of my sentiments . 
 I really love you . 
 And I hope so . This is what you were meant for . Say you love me , say yes , say yes . 
 Can you get me a taxi ? 
 Thanks , but no thanks . A taxi will do just fine . 
 No , I hate limousines . They're gas guzzlers . 
 My destination is Rockefeller Center . 
 As soon as possible . 
 Okay , I'm coming downstairs now . 
 He dresses in plain clothes and drives an old car . Who would know he is the richest man in town ? 
 Doctor , I have the worst toothache ! 
 For about a week or so , but it ’ s gotten really bad in the last couple of days . 
 You know , I was eating jawbreakers in the movies the other day , and I accidentally bit down really hard on one . 
 I just use a regular hard bristle toothbrush . 
 Yes , it definitely bothers me more when I do that . 
 Yes , I am expecting some money wired to my account from Taiwan . Would you please check if the money available yet ? 
 There's someone coming . 
 Yes , it's fast . But four minutes is enough to do fifty thousand dollars damage . 
 I wonder if anyone can call the Ridleys about this . Do you know them well ? 
 Do you know where they're vacationing ? 
 Yes , but at least this way no one gets hurt.It ' s better to have a fire in your house when you're not home . Don't you think ? 
 Oh , no . It seems that I've lost my train ticket . 
 It was in my pocket , but now I can't find it . 
 No , it is not here . Damn it ! I'm going to have to buy another ticket . 
 OK . 
 Yeah . I think so.You have to be patient and careful . 
 You must be joking ! 
 That's because he's getting nervous . Anyway , this is the first time he's directed a play . 
 Yes , you're right . Maybe there's any other reason . 
 Yes . I graduated from shanghai University and later obtained a master's degree from Oxford . 
 My graduation thesis is on International Trade . 
 Sorry , he has just gone out now . Can I take a message for you ? 
 OK , I got it . 
 Problems are what we're here for , sir . Please tell me your problem . 
 Were you wearing your glasses when you noticed them , sir ? 
 Sir , sometimes a fast elevator ride makes our guests see spots . 
 I'm very sorry , sir . Will you please hold while I transfer you to my supervisor ? 
 Not back home for dinner again ? That's the third time this week ! 
 You don't have to explain . Suit yourself . 
 We'll see . 
 Hey Jackie . What are you doing ? 
 I was thinking about heading to the mall . Do you want to go ? 
 Yeah . Both Bon and Nordstrom's is having there annual sale . It's a great time to buy some clothes you've been holding out on . 
 I'll meet you in front of Nordstrom's in 30 minutes . 
 What do you think about these shoes ? 
 No . Not really . 
 I bet it's expensive . 
 For 80 bucks it looks great . Go try it on . 
 I'm due to check out tomorrow , but I'd like to extend my stay by two days . 
 Tom Black in Room 207 . 
 What can be done then ? 
 That's quite all right . Thank you . 
 I'm looking for a string of pearls for my wife . 
 I'm not sure . I don't know very much about the price of pearls . 
 Is there a price reduction ? 
 How much is that one ? 
 OK . I'll take it . Thank you . 
 Oh . I am sorry , here you are . May I suggest our lunch special ? 
 Of course . I will be here minutes later . 
 OK . I don't mind going bar hopping with an expert like you . 
 I think I'll have a glass of wine . Let's see ... they have red wine , white wine and port . They even have sangria ! It's the happy hour special . 
 Good choice ! But , what's your favorite kind of hard liquor ? 
 Mark ! I was wondering if you finished that presentation you were working on last week ? 
 Mr . Rodriguez was asking me about it yesterday . 
 I heard that Ann had divorced . 
 Poor Ann . She did not love her husband at all . 
 What a wonderful dinner ! 
 Where did you get your fantastic recipes ? 
 I especially like the wonderful chicken dish . 
 Is that shrimp in the soup ? 
 I am happy that the wine I brought for you works well with this meal . 
 The ATM machine outside won't give me back my card . 
 Yes , here it is . 
 How did you know ? 
 Oh . But can I have my card back now ? 
 I must be going now . 
 No , I really must go now.My family are expecting me home soon . 
 See you ! 
 Of course I remember , actually , I am very surprised you remembered , I thought for sure you would forget . 
 They are so beautiful . I love them , and I love you too . 
 I don't know how , but I love you more than the day we gotta married . 
 I know of the past years we have faced and shared troubles , but we survived and here we are . 
 Yes we did . 
 I love you , happy anniversary . 
 Actually , I had a perfect plan for this afternoon , but it is totally ruined by the sand storm . I woke up this morning and found it was sunny . So I called Lucy and asked her to go shopping with me . We were going to look for a new purse . Now it turned out to be like this . Neither of us wants to go to outside anymore . 
 What ’ s wrong with climate ? Anyway , I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before . Can ’ t people do something to stop it ? 
 My new plan is to wait for the end of the sand storm and clean my apartment . 
 All right . Wukesong stop is quite a few stops from here . 
 The train is coming . There are a lot of people waiting here . let's stand in a better position to get on the train 
 No , but it will be soon . Look , there're two empty seats over there . Let's get them . 
 Yes , it is . I'm Jennifer . Nice to meet you . 
 Are you American ? 
 I come from America . Are you a freshman ? 
 Me , too . 
 Yeah . Anytime . 
 hello ! I was exhausted form studying , so I decided to read the newspaper to relax . Unfortunately , the news is so depressing . There has been another murder in the city center . I ’ m shocked that the pole 
 you mean if they catch the murderer . I ’ m scared stiff about going into the city center at night . 
 well , there was one good piece of news . You remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ? 
 well , they ’ Ve got the money and she ’ s going tomorrow for treatment . 
 I ’ m sure they are . Oh , and a local man won the lottery . I ’ m so jealous ! I wish it were me ! I buy a lottery ticket every week and I ’ m amazed that I haven ’ t even won a small prize yet . It ’ s so unfair ! 
 Come on in.Let me show you the house.Isn ' t it something ? Spacious , bright and clean.And the walls were newly painted.Have you ever seen such a nice house ? 
 This is the kitchen.Every - thing's new . 
 How do you like this waltz ? 
 Well , then , may I invite you for the first dance ? 
 Me ? Oh , no . In fact , I took up dancing quite recently . 
 I'm glad you say so , you dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got a partner . 
 Yes . And what dances do you do best ? 
 Oh , well , the music has stopped . Thank you for the dance . 
 Fine . 
 Yeah , I went over the figures this morning . We're finally started making money again ! 
 not only our annual sales brake a record , but our month by month earnings exceeded our forecast as well . After a two-year slump , we finally back in the black . 
 I think our success is partly because of Wallace's contribution , and partly because of our new marketing strategy . Because of the new advertising campaign , we have become the top sellers in the field . 
 Let's hope it is ! 
 Then it wasn't meant to be . Some people have put up a hard fight for some items I bid on . But I was the sole bidder for this bag and got it dirt-cheap . 
 Sure . I've even e-mailed some people who had bought from the person who sold this bag . 
 They said he was an honest and professional businessman . But that's the exciting part . It's kind of like gambling ... 
 I love it . All my life I wanted to learn to ski . Finally I took lessons last year . 
 No , quite the opposite . I thought I'd never stop falling down . Then all of a sudden I started skiing much better . 
 Every chance I get . On weekends I ski all day long . Sometimes I even ski at night . 
 Oh , yes . The ski slopes are well lit . It's really nice to ski at night . Why don't you learn to ski ? 
 Don't be so frightened . It's just a skill . 
 Great . Are you a qualified teacher ? 
 What kind of teaching certificate do you have ? 
 How many years of experience do you have ? 
 When did you get your TEFL certificate ? 
 Why do you want to teach at our school ? 
 That ’ s great . Can you speak Chinese ? 
 Can you come in for an interview tomorrow at 10:00 ? 
 Great . See you then . 
 Certainly , Sir . You do have a Current Account with us right ? 
 Yes , Sir . In order to get a credit card with us , you'll need to open a Current Account here . Could you please fill out this form with your relevant details ? 
 Yes , a passport will be fine . 
 That's fine , Sir . We'll see you again a little later . 
 I am worrying about my husband . 
 You know , he is a taxi driver . He has to have his eyes peeled all the time when he drives , especially during the rush hour . 
 You need to get a special application form . 
 You can go to the Employment Development Office and pick it up . 
 They will need a record showing who you worked for and when you worked for them . 
 Be prepared to show a written notice of your termination as proof . 
 You will receive a notice for a phone interview , which will continue the process . 
 Your desire coincides with ours . 
 Thank you for your information . As you know , our corporation is a state-operated one . We always trade with foreign countries on the basis of equality and mu - dual benefit . Establishing business relations between us will be to our mutual benefit . I have no doubt that it will bring about closer ties between us . 
 We ’ ll then make an offer as soon as possible . I hope a lot of business will be conducted between us . 
 Ladies and gentlemen , we are heading towards the first spot of our trip-the Louvre . 
 Yes . There are so many famous paintings on show . I am sure it will be an unforgettable trip .

 All right . Here are our F . O . B . price lists . All the prices are subject to our final confirmation . 
 We usually offer on a net basis only . Many of our clients have been doing very well on this quoted price . 
 The quantity you ordered is much smaller than those of others . If you can manage to boost it a bit , we ’ ll consider giving you a better discount . 
 Well , as this is the first deal between us , we agree to give you an one-percent discount as a special encouragement . 
 I ’ m afraid we have really made a great concession , and could not go any further . 
 All right . See you tomorrow . 
 It's $ 160 . 
 Sorry , sir , we are having a sale now . 
 Oh , yes , Mrs.Saxton . Please take a seat here . 
 Would you like a shampoo first ? 
 Yeah . A lot of my customers love it . ( after shampooing ) Do you want a permanent wave or a cold wave ? 
 Sure . We just got some . They're upto-date . 
 No problem . 
 Please fill out the form first . 
 By hand in cold water . Got it . 
 Channel 24.It shows some cable networks and no commercial interruptions . 
 It was very good . I followed it right to the end . 
 Yes , we do .

 Thank you , please fill out this form for us . 
 Yes , please.we need a record of you education and your work experiences . 
 That ’ s right , we bought it the same day we came on the market . 
 It ’ s a wonderful Spanish style . 
 And it ’ s a bargaining . A house like this in river side costs double the price . 
 No , it has three bedrooms and three beds , and has a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling . There ’ s a two-car garage . 
 Yeas , when will you buy a house ? 
 Right , congratulations . 
 We're interested in your Drawn Works . What about the supply position ? 
 Here's our inquiry list . You'll find the required items , specifications and quantities all there . 
 I don't need to remind you that the market has become very competitive . 
 That's fine . By the way , do you quote FOB or CIF ? 
 Then would you please make your prices CIF including five percent ? 
 Daddy , are you going to the park with us this weekend ? 
 So you can't go with us , right ? 
 Daddy , you always arrange your schedule so tight on weekdays . You should have a rest on weekends . 
 Daniel wants to go to the aquarium . While Mom wants to visit the Summer Palace . 
 Yeah . I don't agree with them , but I don't have a better choice . 
 Right , ah . It is so close to our home . How come we've never thought of that ? 
 Very well , Go ahead . 
 It's an excellent one . I like it very much . 
 It includes a lot of useful words and phrases . 
 I need help in ordering my office supplies . 
 I need ink cartridges , staples , and Post-its . 
 Some of these can wait but there are a few things that I need right away . 
 We have plenty of money for office supplies . 
 I want to pick them up . 
 You too ! 
 It's almost ready . Can you set the table ? 
 Want to taste this dish ? 
 Really ? 
 If you like to help me do the dishes , I'll be more dreadful . 
 Would you please take a seat over there , madam ? I ’ ll let Mr . Emory know that you ’ re here . 
 Well , it may take some time . Mr . Emory ’ s at a meeting at the moment . It would probably be more comfortable over there . 
 John , could you come to my office ? I need to talk to you . 
 No . Come here right now . 
 What's the matter ? 
 Why ? I work very hard . 
 Well , some of those other guys are not the same kind I'd like to communicate with , but if that's important to you . I'll try to get along with them . 
 It's unfair . 
 OK . I need to think about that for a while . 
 Would you please recommend a diamond for me ? 
 I prefer a diamond mounted in a ring . 
 Do you guarantee its quality ? 
 Chinese tea is famous all over the world . I want to buy several boxes . 
 Well , I do not know Chinese tea at all . 
 Sounds interesting . What about this ? 
 What's this ? It smells fragrant . 
 I will take the jasmine tea . Could you pack it with the wrapping paper and ribbon ? It is a gift for my friend . 
 Welcome to NO Bank . It's Mr Zu , isn't it ? 
 How's Mrs Zu doing these days ? 
 Can I give you some advice on a loan , or ... 
 Are you absolutely sure , Mr Zu ? You know , you will lose interest if you do . 
 Let me run through a couple of other options with you . That way , you can make a more informed decision . 
 Yes . Do you accept traveler's checks ? 
 Very good . 
 Yes , I have my driver's license . 
 Mrs . Miller , you are an old friend of ours . In order to encourage future business and as a gesture of friendship , we are prepared to cut our price by 5 % . Will that satisfy you ? 
 Now I repeat , 5,000 transistor sets , specifications as shown in our catalogue at $ 20 each C . I . F . Los Angeles . 
 As to packaging , we'll pack them two dozens to one carton , gross weight about 25 kilos a carton . 
 Yes , corrugated cardboard boxes . 
 Why use wooden cases ? 
 Cartons are comparatively light , and there fore easy to handle . They'll not be stowed away with the heavy cargo . Besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with metal straps . 
 You needn't worry about that . Cartons are extensively used in our shipments to foreign countries and there have never been complaints from our clients . Now , as regards payment , we have agreed to use dollars , am I right ? 
 Please open the letter of credit 15 to 30 days before the date of delivery so that we'll have enough time to make all the necessary arrangements . Another thing , the L / C should be valid until the 15th day after shipment . 
 Right . We'll ship the goods according to the agreed time schedule . Last , but not least , the inspection is to be carried out by Houston Commodities Inspection Bureau , which is final and binding on both parties . 
 Thank you . You can rest assured that we'll do everything possible to prevent de festive commodities from going abroad . However , if there should be any disputes , we wish to have them settled through friendly discussions . 
 Well , it seems we have covered everything . We'll have the contract ready in a couple of days . 
 Let me see . If we can't get the contract ready by then , we'll send it to you by airmail for your signature . 
 What would you like to order , sir ? 
 We serve different styles of Chinese food here . But I'm not sure which one do you prefer . 
 Well . Cantonese food is rather light , Beijing food is heavy , and Sichuan food is usually hot and spicy . 
 If so , I suggest you have a taste for Sichuan food . Most Sichuan dishes are spicy and hot , but they have different tastes . 
 Yes . Roasted Crispy Chicken and Spicy Beef are our specialties . 
 Front Desk . What can I do for you ? 
 What time do you want us to wake you up ? 
 OK . I've set it up for you . 
 What do you know about Julia Roberts ? 
 I mean her personality . 
 OK , Mr . Wang . Thank you very much for coming to the airport to see us off . Your great country and your hospitality have left a very deep impression on all of us and your working attitude and your way of doing business have changed my opinions about Chinese people . 
 That's true . And this trip has been a very productive one for us . 
 Believe me , Mr . Wang . I'll do my best to promote the transaction . 
 It ’ s very kind of you to say so . 
 I think we will have opportunities to meet each other in the future . 
 Fine . Thank you very much . Bye-bye . 
 Excuse me . May I see Mrs . Smith ? 
 Nice to meet you , Mrs . Smith . I'm coming here for an interview by appointment . 
 Yes , I am . 
 Not really , I am familiar with this area . 
 Sure . And if you rent it , maybe I can help you find a roommate too . 
 Yes , my friend Steve . I'll introduce you . 
 I ’ m afraid I ’ m already booked up for next Sunday . But thank you just the same . 
 Welcome , young man . No offence , but I haven't seen you here before . 
 Okay then . You are the younger customer here ever . 
 It's the marketing's fault , I suppose.What do you want to do ? 
 That's a long way to go , I'm afraid . First of all , you gotta grow up . 
 Sure . Then what about trying the treadmill or the skipping rope . 
 Please change your clothes first ! 
 Sorry , but no jeans here . 
 How are the children doing in your class , Jane ? 
 Which child is this ? 
 What a large child ! 
 And which child is this ? 
 What an agile child ! 
 Now which child is this ? 
 Mm . All my children hope to go to college . Right ? 
 The People's Park is located on Nanjing Road , near Limbo road , just on the opposite side of the International Hotel . 
 Only about twenty minutes . 
 No , you aren't . Just go ahead , please . 
 You can take the No . 22 trolley bus to get there . 
 Hi , Monica , how is everything going ? 
 Why ? You ’ re not satisfied anymore ? 
 That is important . Doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application . 
 Ok , good luck to you . 
 Well . I can't find my key now . I think I have lost it . 
 I don't think so . I took it with me when I went out this morning . 
 Are you being served , Sir ? 
 Would you sit here , please ? How would you like it cut ? 
 What , your short already , sir . 
 Should I just trim it ? 
 Oh , I see . You like Chinese style , don ’ t you ? 
 Would you like to have some shampoo , sir ? 
 How about oil or spray ? 
 There , how ’ s that ? 
 Welcome back , soccer fans . My name is Rick Fields and , as always , I am joined by my commentating wingman , Bob Copeland . 
 The ref calls the players for the kick off , and here we go ! Ecuador quickly passes the ball to the midfield , but , oath , it ’ s out of bounds . 
 No question about it . He was offside by a mile ! We have a goal kick for Ecuador . Edison Mendez heads it to Valencia , he shoots ! Deflected by the defender and we have a corner kick . 
 This is the perfect opportunity for Ecuador to get ahead in this match and become World Champions ! He gets ready for the kick . He shoots ! and he ... 
 Sure , but you have to pay $ 3 for it . 
 Well , ou can't hear music until takeoff . 
 Miss , would you like to try this free sample of our new suntan cream ? 
 This is a new product of company this year . It's oil-free . 
 It gives your skin a very natural healthy look . 
 I would like to place an order . 
 I have your catalog here . Do you want me to tell you the item numbers , or the names ? 
 Alright . I want to order the satin sheets on page 28 . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 I need one full set of sheets in King-size . 
 Ivory , please 
 Yes , I think so . Can I ask you something ? 
 I'm a foreigner here . My English isn't perfect . Can you tell me what satin is ? 
 I see . That's what I thought . 
 No , I just need the sheets . 
 Yes . 
 Visa .

 July , 2006 . 
 Thank you . 
 No problem . I can deal with it well . 
 All is best now , isn ’ t it ? 
 But he has the sex scandal . 
 I agree . He is also an excellent speaker . 
 yeah , it ’ s fair to say so . 
 You bet ! 
 Ryan says he wants to stay . I think he's in love with some girl who designs fruit platters ... 
 Yeah , especially since Jack didn't take care of the plane reservations . 
 Not until the 31st . So can you change the church reservations ? 
 Then where will we have the ceremony ? At home ? 
 I'm sorry , Mom . 
 Merry Christmas , Mom . I love you . 
 I know . Goodnight . 
 What exactly do you want ? 
 What did you want to get ? 
 What kind do you want to get ? 
 I can tell you what kind I like . 
 Apple pie is my favorite . 
 See , I helped you out . 
 Yes , I am . I have life insurance and my home and its contents are also insured . 
 That ’ a good idea . You are a fireman and it can be dangerous job . 
 I can terminate my life insurance policy when I retire and use the money as a pension . 
 Did you have to take a medical before you could take out the police ? 
 Do you have any idea for this vacation ? 
 Oh , yeah , let's try to find some jobs . 
 Do you remember Tina , my good friend ? 
 She just broke up with her boyfriend . 
 But the problem is she and her ex-boyfriend are working in the same department . It is somehow embarrassing for them to see each other everyday . 
 Well , Tina says she would be able to handle it and concentrate on her own work , easier set them done . But working harder and concentrating only on the job might well helped to overcome the initial stress of the breakup . 
 That's more like it . 
 They might actually win the game . 
 Yes . 
 I learned in college . 
 Thank you . 
 3 weeks . 
 Yes , she just got here yesterday . 
 No . I've never been there . 
 Yes . I went there once on a business trip . 
 Jake just broke up with me . 
 Yesterday . I didn't even know it was coming . He just told me he found someone else . 
 But it still hurts . I thought I loved him . 
 Better or worse , it doesn't matter . I had a lot of feelings for him . I really liked him 
 I know . I'll get over him . My first break up was painful because I was naive . 
 Maybe tomorrow . I don't feel like it tonight . 
 Sure . 
 Yes . This is room 804 . I can't find my coat . I was wondering if it's in the lost and found . 
 It's a light blue coat . It's got a hood and a big silver zipper . 
 Last night . I think I may have left it in the lobby bar . 
 Thanks . I appreciate that . 
 I think I'd rather have tea this morning . 
 Just an English muffin . What are you going to have ? 
 Betty was in hospital . 
 She suffers from cancer . 
 Freeze ! 
 Do you understand any other foreign languages besides English ? 
 What band did you pass in Japanese Language Proficiency Test ? 
 I'll be checking out of the hotel in about 30 minutes . 
 Great ! As you know , however , the day in New York has hardly begun . 
 What can I do with my baggage while I visit a few more tourist spots ? 
 Isn't my baggage enough of a deposit ? 
 It's always something , isn't it ? Let me think about this for a second . 
 Julia , what's the weather forecast for tomorrow ? 
 Oh ! I hate rainy days ! 
 Yes . I have to drive to Washington D . C . 
 Yeah ! But you know sometimes the weather forecast is not correct . Maybe tomorrow is a clear day . Who knows ? 
 How's Jerry's new school ? 
 He's a team player . 
 Can I take your order now or do you still want to look at the menu ? 
 Certainly . How about spaghetti with clams and shrimps . 
 Ann , it's terrible ! 
 Look , this is a pimple ! 
 How come ? 
 I have no bad habit . I sleep eight hours a day , never eat spicy food , clean the face twice a day and so on . I have done a lot . 
 I wasn't aware of that ! 
 Look at what you have done . All thumbs . 
 Gordon , you're ever so late . 
 But there's a bus every ten minutes , and you are over 1 hour late . 
 How on earth can you miss several buses ? 
 Oh , come on , Gordon , it's the afternoon now . Why were you late really ? 
 Have you got it now ? 
 When ? 
 I am not convinced by your explanation . 
 Well , I love it . The room is special and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . There are plants along the corridor . Especially , I got my own desk with computer and telephone . Such a great place ! 
 What was so bad about it ? 
 Sounds bad ! Lucky you ! You didn ’ t take that job . I think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently . 
 OK . I'll take your bet , as long as the winner gets to pick the movie . What about you , Nick ? 
 Why not ! I rolled a five . The category is Best Pictures . 
 I know that , it's The English Patient . It was one of the only good American movies of the 90s . 
 I'd like to order room service to room 202 , please , 
 I'd like two sandwiches and one green fruit salad , please . 
 No . Could you also get some extra towels and soup too ? We went to the pool today and used up our two clean towels . 
 Just put in on with the rest of my hotel bill . 
 Hey , Tom , what to go for a run ? 
 I try to do that , but I can ’ t get up early enough . 
 It ’ s so hot at lunchtime ; I ’ d rather run in the morning . 
 I could try , but I can ’ t say for sure if I ’ ll get up in time . What time do you want to go ? 
 O . K . , maybe if I have someone to go with , I ’ ll be able to get up in time for a jog . 
 See you . 
 That's no problem . Let me see ... You still have ten days annual leave left , is that right ? 
 That's long leave . How's your project coming along ? 
 Well , all right . But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave . 
 Great ! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed . 
 I'm afraid it's bad news for you . You haven't got the position . 
 I'm afraid so . I'm terribly sorry . 
 He's the only one of the several to decide this . 
 I don't think the thing can be that serious . You should face the result . Besides , I don't think the position is the best for you . 
 Keep working hard , and then you will get another chance of promotion someday . 
 Well , I think Clinton deserves high marks for doing his job generally , but he may get low marks for his honesty and personal image . 
 I don't find this surprising . The poll data sound quite right . He is a good president . 
 Are there any interesting articles in today ’ s newspapers ? 
 Is there anything of interest to us in the business sections ? 
 Are the reports favorable ? 
 That ’ s interesting . They must be thinking of moving into that market . Are there any interesting editorials ? 
 I ’ m not surprised . That article certainly added fuel to the debate . Ok . Thanks . Can you leave two articles and the advertisements with me ? I ’ d like to read them . 
 Good morning , Sue . 
 I'm fine , thanks , how about yourself ? 
 I am heading for the library . I've got a research project to do.How about you ? 
 See you later , alligator . 
 Try it on in front of the mirror . 
 We have darker ones . Do you like the style ? 
 lt's made of silk and you had better wash it by hand in cold water . 
 Not at all . Go ahead . 
 Not really , so long as you follow all the regulations . 
 No . Everyone has a chance to correct his or her mistakes . The most important thing is to be responsible for your work . 
 Yes . That's true . We are always busy . The company attaches great importance to high efficiency . Sometimes we have to work overtime , but not always . And we have extra pay for extra work . 
 Good morning . What's the matter with you ? 
 All right , young man . Tell me how it got started . 
 Don't worry , young man . Lat me give you an examination . First let me take a look at your throat . Open your mouth and say'ah ' . 
 Your throat is inflamed . And your tongue is heavily coated . You have all the symptoms of influenza . 
 A good rest is all you need , and drink more water . I'll write you a prescription . 
 Excuse me . I need some storybooks in easy English . Do you have anything likethat ? 
 I'll go take a look . Thanks for your help . 
 Hey , son , are you insured ? 
 I took out a life insurance policy and made your mother the beneficiary . 
 I am a fireman and it is a dangerous job . I have to consider your mother's life . 
 You have children now . What if something , God forbid , happens to you ? 
 A $ 100 000 policy shouldn't be too expensive . Here , call my agent . He'll give you a good deal . 
 Is this the right counter for gloves ? 
 Well , let me see some of each . 
 Six and a quarter , I believe , but you'd better measure my hand to make sure . 
 Very well , I'll take these two . 
 What flight are you taking ? 
 And what's your name ? 
 Everything is in order . Please check in at the airport an hour before flight time . 
 What seems to be the problem ? 
 Where does it hurt the most ? 
 How long has it felt like this ? 
 Do you have a history of stomach pain ? 
 Well , I think that we are going to have to get you to an emergency room right away . 
 So it is hard to be a black student on campus ? 
 Stereotypes ? Like what ? 
 I do know you like rap music , but the other two are definitely false . I ’ Ve seen you play basketball . 
 You mean that people look down upon you because they think you're in school because of a quota ? That's not true at all , you're really a smart guy . 
 Teachers ? I didn't think that they would be racist at all . 
 I see . It looks like there are still a lot of issues we need to work on in the US . 
 Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer , and you'll be online in a heartbeat . 
 No problem . I'll tell you about our alternatives . 
 Our state-of-the-art computer lab is on the first floor . 
 Sir , the computers are free to guests , but you do have to pay a nominal printing fee . 
 Just use your computer here in the lobby . It's set up for wireless . 
 We might have a printer here next month . But for now , you'll have to go to the lab . 
 No , but I have to type my paper tonight . 
 You got it ! 
 Yeah , the people in the next room are a little loud . Could you do something about it ? 
 I'm in Room 215 . 
 I don't know the number , but it's definitely the room that's next to the stairs . 
 OK , thanks . I really appreciate it . 
 Yes ! Thank goodness you ’ re here.These bugs are driving us crazy ! 
 We just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything . We have termites in the wood , cockroaches all over the place , and last night I saw a huge rat out in the backyard ! 
 No problem , just get rid of the bugs ! 
 not very well . I haven ’ t found anything within my price range yet . 
 I can only afford about 300 pounds a month . 
 really ? That ’ s a lot of money to pay for one room . 
 do you know of anyone who needs a roommate ? 
 I ’ d prefer non-smoking roommates , but I guess I ’ ll have to take what I can get ! 
 I can sign a contract up to a year . I don ’ t know where I ’ ll be after that . 
 I don ’ t have any furniture , so it ’ d be great if it were furnished . 
 no , I thought that would be included in the rent . 
 I don't think I can afford that . 
 that's a good idea . I ’ ll look into finding something like that . 
 What's that ? 
 Great ! Who's the bridegroom ? 
 The guy always hands the girls in a line . When did he propose ? 
 My gosh ! How romantic ! When's the big day ? 
 Will it be a church wedding or a civil ceremony ? 
 Who is the best man ? 
 Nobody is OK , but you ! 
 Did you promise him ? 
 Sally , do you really need to go ? 
 But don't forget to give me a ring . 
 Where's the nearest tailor's ? 
 The jacket is tight in the shoulders and long in the sleeve . What about the price there ? 
 Is there a better tailor's around here ? 
 Someone ’ s told me behind closed door that he is very hot-tempered . 
 Really ? I hope to meet him soon . 
 Yes , please . 
 I would like vegetable soup , please 
 Shrimp salad . And what kind of pie do you have ? 
 Then a piece of apple pie , please . 
 Icecream , please . 
 orange 
 Mr Brown ! How nice to see you , can I help ? 
 I see . You are one of my favourite customers , Mr Brown . I'm more than happy to help . For Comprehensive Credit Granting , IBA will grant a promised quota for you , that is , if you qualify . Of course , your credit record , within you field of trade needs to be up to scratch . 
 We will consider the first part of the year , in your particular field , and your credit rating can be no less than class A , during that period . 
 The academy is an important part of the education system . 
 It ’ s nice meeting you . 
 I am happy to be speaking to a presidential candidate . 
 What do you feel about gay marriage ? 
 Would you legalize gay marriage ? 
 Many people won ’ t like that . 
 I really like you . 
 Hello , come in , I've been waiting for you . 
 No , no , no , not at all.It ' s just that I've been looking forward to meeting you . 
 Ha , ha , ha ! Yes , I guess I deserved that . Let me explain , okay ? 
 Well , as you probably know I buy from a selected group of suppliers and don't , as a rule , deal with new people . 
 I'm very old-fashioned . I believe in loyalty.Once I start a sales relationship with someone , I stay with him or her , and we so most of our business on the phone . I expect their absolute best price possible and don't haggle.But if I find out they screwed me over , then I find another supplier . 
 Well , those are my terms . As long as you honor them , we do business.If you break faith and try to take advantage , I'll find someone else to work with . Can you live with that ? 
 Well , Randy , I'd say you've got a bad case of the flu . The main thing to do is get plenty of rest and drink lots of liquids . I'll prescribe something for that throat . 
 Some aspirin or Panadol should help . You can pick some up at the pharmacy when you go to fill your prescription . 
 Goodbye , Randy . Take care . 
 Hum ... Why not go shopping the day after tomorrow ? Tomorrow is Saturday . I hate all the hustle and bustle of Saturday shopping . 
 Hum.Maybe it will be better . The most important thing is that I can have a day to relax after a week's work . 
 By the way , what kind of stores do we need to go ? 
 Let ’ s also go to the jewelry store to buy a crystal necklace . I want to buy one for you as your birthday present . 
 This place is great . I'm surprised there are so many things here . 
 What's the difference between an outlet and a regular store ? 
 Faulty products ? 
 Oh , that's easy for me . I think it's really a good deal . 
 That's great for me . Look , children's clothes ! I'd like to buy some winter clothes for my son and daughter . 
 Yes , I'll take it . Are there any jeans ? Xiaohui's jeans are always dirty . I also need four pairs of slippers . 
 I ought to make the most of it while I'm here , don't you think ? 
 Ladies and gentlemen , here is the Westminster Abbey . It's one of the oldest buildings in London . 
 Of course . Take your time and enjoy your trip . 
 We will meet at 5:00 right here . 
 I'm better now . Want to play again ? 
 Let's get all the balls out of the pockets . 
 You are crazy . Gambling is against my principles . 
 The core values are credibilities , team work , diligence and devotion . 
 Yes , we are a foreign-invested company . 
 You shouldn't be so negative.You ' ll always have some co-workers that are harder to work with than others.But if you are negative and start name-calling in the office , it will make a bad working environment for everybody . 
 Everybody has their strengths and weaknesses.Even Larry.He might be a pain to be around , but he's also very good at staying in budget on projects.Mary , on the other hand , spends our project money like there's no tomorrow.Also , she's never willing to stay a little later at the office.She always leaves at 5pm sharp . 
 You're right.He ' s a hard worker , easy to get along with , honest , and he never steals the credit on projects.The only thing he's lacking in is experience . 
 When you need an apartment , where do you look for one ? 
 Can I share an apartment with someone ? 
 Are apartments expensive in this city ? 
 I want a two-bedroom apartment . 
 Would you have time to go look at apartments with me ? 
 Could you give me an expense report ? I would like to attach the invoices for my phone bill this season . 
 That is very kind of you . I ’ m just running out of glue . 
 I heard Betty lost her tennis match this morning , so she's out of the tournament . 
 Me , too . I'm sure she'll do better in the next tournament . 
 Yes , actually I ’ m looking to buy a camera . 
 Actually I ’ m buying a camera for my husband . 
 Yeah ? Can I take a look at the Sirs you carry ? 
 The Canon Eos . Yeah it ’ s ok , but I ’ m looking for something that performs better in low light , has a better display panel , and longer battery life . 
 Yeah , but what kit lens does this camera come with ? I don ’ t want some bulky telephoto lens . 
 Looks to me like an 18-55 mm lens . pretty standard , that will do . Not like my husband will be stalking celebrities or anything ! 
 Accessories ? Do you carry polarizing filters ? 
 No you ’ re not ! There are some right here ! 
 Thanks for your help , Ralph !

 You're Mary , right ? 
 Cindy told me about you in our gym class . 
 My house is next door to yours . 
 Just call me Alex . Alex and Alexander are the same thing . 
 I didn't have any big plans . 
 That sounds like fun . Where will it be ? 
 Oh good ! Can I bring anything ? 
 I am assuming that the dress is casual . 
 Wonderful . Just e-mail me the time and date and I'll be there . 
 If we hurry , can we get there in time ? 
 Peter , enough with your computer games . Go do your homework now . 
 No ! Stop playing computer games ! 
 Peter , if you don't turn off your computer , then I won't allow you to play it again starting next week . 
 Yes , I'd like to change these dollars , please ? 
 In fifty yuan bills , please ?

 Daddy , may I take your compass ? I feel so cool with it in my hand . 
 It doesn't matter . I can go with you to the supermarket to pick up a new pair . 
 Can you book me a double room for February 22 ? 
 I guess so . 
 It ’ s still touch and go . We don ’ t see how she can make it . 
 Would you mind telling me the purpose of your visit to the U . K . ? 
 May I see your passport ?

 Do you have anything to declare ?

 No , the gym is free to guests . Take your room key , however , so you can get in . 
 The gym is open seven days a week , twenty-four hours a day . 
 Unfortunately , no . If you want a trainer , you'll have to use another gym . 
 what's that ? 
 have you read it yet ? 
 go on , read it out loud . 
 when did you send her a letter ? 
 I didn't know anyone did that any more . Ok , go on . 
 that's fine with me .

 What's the best time to call you , then ? 
 Thank you for coming , Miss Yang . 
 Hi . What can I get for you ? 
 Good choice ! Our ground beef is extra lean , if you know what I mean . 
 No , no no no chicken breasts at the moment , but we have some nice chicken thighs . 
 Okay , is there anything else ? 
 Yes ! It ’ s very fine meat ! Made it myself ...

 Okay . That will be thirty-four dollars and fifty cents . 
 On which day ? 
 Well , let me check for you . Yes , you are booked already . It's a single room with a bath , facing the south . 
 Well , that's why you'r here.My source for big TV sets overcharged me on the last shipment , so I need someone new . I wanted to meet you to see if we can work together . I think 
 Fine , but before you agree , don't you need to know what you're agreeing to ? 
 Ha , ha , ha ! That's fair.How did I do ? 
 Good , well , here's what I need from you . Are you ready ? 
 Well , I know you work for someone else , but as your client , please , we have to get this straight between us . I'm your client , not your company.As your client , I expect you to be square with me at all times . Can you do that ? 
 Good ! Do you have any questions ? 
 How does she cook the shrimp ? 
 I don't like that . I like fried food , fried potatoes , fried chicken , fried sausage ... I can't see why fried food is not healthy . 
 It's all right ! I often fry sausages when my mom is not at home . 
 Come to my house this Sunday . My mom will not be at home then . We can cook some wonderful fried food by ourselves ! 
 Look , all you do is press that button and it ’ s ready to use . 
 Just make sure you never touch the wire .

 You're positive that these are the only classes left ? 
 The class on Monday and Wednesday will be fine .

 Come on baby , stop trying to pretend like a man . If you go there , you are sure to like them . 
 I said you are sure to like them . There is the Grand Parade Of Ants Carnival in a few minutes in the square . You will experience a dream of fantasy . 
 All kinds of insects dress themselves up . They drive straight their own Flower Cars along the Parade Avenue of Ants Kingdom . 
 I thought you had grown out of such child practices . 
 Gross !

 All right . Here it is . 
 Here you are . Thanks . 
 Bye-bye . 
 Good . How about you ? 
 But your company is huge . Can't they afford to pay the staff decent wages . 
 That's shortsighted . By the time the workers are experienced and contributing . They are likely to go . 
 But you have already worked there for five years . 
 Well . The management doesn't seem to think that way . Anyways , you have to think twice before you act . 
 What's your name please ?

 How long has your daughter been in the States ? 
 What's her job ?

 Is this all right ? 
 Where will you be going ? 
 Is that it ?

 Why can't I just stay up until I fall asleep ?

 Do you have to leave soon ? 
 Oh , that ’ s better . So you don ’ t have to rush . 
 What ? 
 He knows you very well . 
 I ’ m sure you have chances everywhere . You ’ re handsome , talkative , and got a sense of humor . You must be very popular . 
 What have you been up to , Johnny ? 
 Wow , your grandma's really having a field day with you , huh ? 
 You have all the fun , don't you ? 
 Sure thing , Johnny . Watch out for dishpan hands there , kid ! 
 A lorry overturned on the road and blocked it , so all the traffic was held up . 
 Yeah , traffic was brought to a standstill by the accident . If we had gone early we would miss the traffic . 
 Don ’ t worry . The traffic jam is said to be over soon . 
 It ’ s my pleasure . 
 yes , I heard it's supposed to come out in June . Are you thinking about getting one ? 
 if I had enough money , I'd buy one , but I don't even have enough to buy one of their shuffle spods . 
 the first generation iPod shuffle is about the size of a park of gum and the second generation iPod shuffle is about half the size of the first . 
 I think it's either one or two gigs . I can't remember . 
 not much at all . I think it's about 100 dollars . 
 do you have an iPod ? 
 why didn't you just buy another battery for it so you could use it ? 
 What ? I don't get it ... 
 Well , I'm glad I made everyone happy . 
 I'm glad you guys all have such a good sense of humor . Ha-ha ... 
 What is your technical title ? 
 Why do you choose this field as your career ? 
 Hello , I hope to get a room for the night . 
 Sorry , I don't . 
 I only need a single room . 
 Smoking if possible . 
 I am very grateful . How much will it be ? 
 Oh dear . I don't have it with me . Do you take debit cards or should I pay with cash ? 
 Yesterday I read hamlet.such a fantastic book ! 
 I do agree with you . 
 I am going to a movie theater . You know there is a new action film produced by Hollywood . A thriller , really . 
 I don't really like seeing bloody frames , but I appreciate the lifelike frames simulated with the highly skillful special effects . 
 I want to see a dentist . 
 OK , thank you . 
 It is because of the quality . 
 I told you that we want first-class goods . So the quality , specification and price are clarified in our contract . Do you remember those details ? 
 The re-examination results indicate that one-third of the goods are not up to standard . 
 I told you the truth . According to the contract , if you fail to honor the contract , we are entitled to cancel it . 
 How many different varieties of products do you import from China ? 
 Do you import any food items ? 
 Excuse me , but could you tell me the way to the railway station ? 
 How long will it take me to get there ? 
 That's very clear . I think I can find my way now.Thank you . 
 Anna , Would you like to dance ? 
 Don ’ t worry about it . I ’ ll show you how . It ’ s a piece of cake . 
 What kind of job have you ever had ? 
 How did you like your job ? 
 How do you like your overcoat , sir ? 
 OK , no problem . Let me take your measurement . 
 Fine . 
 I thought it was in a quiet neighborhood , but it isn't . 
 One of my neighbors has a dog . 
 It barks all night long . 
 What do you need ? 
 What building is it in ? 
 Oh , I know exactly where that is . 
 Sure , what room number is it ? 
 I have a class around there right now . 
 No problem , come on . 
 You have a very good taste , sir . Would you like to try it on ? 
 Here you are 
 It's just around the comer . 
 Yes . One moment , please . 
 No problem . May I see your receipt , please ? 
 That's right . Now try on this one . It's size 41 . 
 Mmm ... to be honest , I ’ d rather go for a pizza . 
 Ok , shall we go to Pizza Hut or Pizza Italia ? 
 I think you ’ re absolutely right . Ok , that ’ s decided then ! 
 I am really excited ! 
 I just got done voting . 
 I just turned 18 last month . 
 Why ? 
 I didn ’ t think of it that way . 
 Seriously , but I ’ m excited that I did . 
 Let's sell our stocks now . 
 I have a feeling they're about to go down in a few days . 
 ( while shaking hands ) I am Zhang Wei , nice to meet you , sir . 
 Thank you . Have you received my resume ? 
 Of course , here you are , sir . 
 Certainly , it would be my pleasure , Mr . Smith . 
 What ’ s the rush ? You ’ re not leaving for another week . 
 Okay . I ’ ll bring them in tomorrow for sure . 
 I'm so tired . Let me sleep for five more minutes . 
 I know , but just five more minutes . 
 I promise I'll wake up , in five minutes . 
 I realize that , and I can do all that when I wake up in five minutes . 
 I'm not going to be late today . 
 Thank you . 
 Do I have to get up now ? 
 What're you talking about ? My alarm even hasn't gone off yet . 
 I must have slept right through it . 
 Just let me sleep five more minutes . 
 I know , I know . But I don't want any worms . 
 Crossed cousin marriage is not allowed in China . 
 You know why ? 
 What is today ? 
 So the weekend is coming ! How about seeing a film ! 
 Good coming , sir . 
 Would you mind moving to the middle of the bus ? 
 Where are you going ? 
 Don't worry . I'll let you know when we get there . 
 are you a blogger ? 
 oh , it seems that I'm the only one who never blogs . When did you get started ? 
 what do you usually write about ? 
 that's interesting . How often do you write a blog ? 
 got it . Are you still updating your blog ? 
 good for you . I know many people just leave their blogs alone after the first few months . 
 Just a moment , please.Yes , I can let you have Room 560 with a view of the sea . 
 How much for these autographed Elvis records ? 
 Uh , I'm not sure . Are these all in good condition ? 
 I don't really need five . 
 Oh , why not ? I'll take ' em . 
 Please Show your ticket and passport . 
 Which flight do you want to change ? 
 Is this taxi taken ? 
 Please take me to this address . 
 Hey , did you hear the news ? 
 Miss Yang is dating the manager who's married . 
 No joke ! That's why she hasn't married yet . 
 That ’ s really a good phenomenon to see . 
 Excuse me , Miss . 
 I've just heard an announcement that my flight has been delayed . 
 Flight CA216 to Chengdu . 
 Could you please tell me why ? 
 How long will the delay be ? Do you have any further information about it ? 
 We have to wait . Well , is it possible for the rain to stop before noon ? 
 Yes , I will . Thanks a lot . Bye ! 
 What's wrong with you ? 
 It's just around the comer.Would you need some pills ? 
 Do you have any special interests besides your job ? 
 What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ? 
 There is a reason in what you say . 
 I'd like to buy a pair of leather shoes . 
 Size 38 or 39 . 
 But they are a little tight , They Pinch . 
 I know.But can you show me a little larger size ? 
 This pair fits me perfectly . I feel comfortable . 
 I like board games . I like chinese chess and draughts . 
 It ’ s about as complicated as chess . The basic rule and moves are simple enough , but there are many strategies that players need to learn . 
 I ’ m terrible at cards and so I never play games which involve gambling , like poker . If I did , I ’ d lose all my money . 
 Yes , I do . It ’ s hard to find four players though , so I don ’ t play very often . Do you know anyone who plays ? If so , we could set up a game . 
 Sure , I have a friend who play fairly well . We should find out when our friends are free and arrange a game . 
 What are you doing ? 
 Mumm . no . 
 What ? 
 I have no idea what you ’ re talking about . The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl . 
 Sounds interesting , but soccer doesn ’ t really appeal to me . 
 All I know about soccer is that you can ’ t use your hands and that players are always falling down , trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . It seems like a sissy sport to me ! 
 Hey , Blake ! Are you still listening to Mozart ? 
 It's great . and I ' Ve heard that listening to Mozart can make you more intelligent . 
 Is classical music your favorite ? 
 I Like pop music best . Classical music is a bit too heavy for me . I can't get fully relaxed in it . 
 Yeah , that's why I can enjoy myself in it . 
 I think so , since I was in primary school . How long have you been interested in classical music . 
 oh , I didn't know you can play the violin . Do you still play . 
 Ben always appears rude to the people around him . 
 That's true . We can not judge people by appearance . 
 You do ? 
 But I find Japanese ones better . 
 It's nothing to get upset about . 
 No . It's out of the question . 
 I'll have to look . What do you want it for ? 
 I can give you quarters , if that'll help . 
 Certainly , please have a seat and roll up your left sleeve . 
 Well , today your doctor wants us to check your white blood cell count . 
 Well , if it is elevated , you might have an infection . 
 It is only a little pin stick . I am going to put a tourniquet on your arm to puff your veins up . 
 There we go ! I got the blood that I needed . 
 Good morning . You are speaking to the property manager . 
 Was it leaking in the bedroom ? 
 Can you tell me which floor you are on ? 
 I would like to look at the leak . Will you be home this morning ? 
 Just in case you have to leave , we will just use the master key . 
 Certainly.Go ahead . 
 Here is the coffee , toast and bacon . Do you like fried eggs or poached ones ? 
 Of course . They will be ready in a few minutes . 
 You're welcome . 
 En , I am looking for the shop . Can you tell me where it is ? 
 Thank you . Do I have to pay duty if I want to buy something ? 
 Thank you so much . 
 I'm just taking a break between washing the windows and cleaning the toilet . 
 I'm doing my best , Grandma ... 
 Uh-oh , here we go ... 
 Sounds good . What should we see ? 
 You mean the one starring John Travolta ? 
 Sounds like an interesting film . Let's meet at five o'clock on Saturday . 
 This is exciting ! Thank you so much ! 
 Boy oh , boy ! This is so cool . Let's rock and roll ! 
 Which one of these is the gas pedal ? 
 The toner has run out and there's none in the stationery cupboard . 
 Hi , Ann . I was wondering if you are free tomorrow night ? 
 I've just gotten a pair of pre-sale Star Wars movie tickets from a friend and was thinking of inviting you along for the opening premiere . Are you interested ? 
 My pleasure . 
 A friend of mine works at the corporate headquarters of Pepsi , which is a major sponsor of the movie . He was able to get the tickets for free , and then he sold two more for me for 50 dollars a piece . 
 Not really . Considering the fact that other people were willing to pay as much as 200 dollars each on the black market . Besides , I knew you were really looking forward to watching Star Wars on the opening day . 
 Well , let's see . The movie stars at 10 . We should be there at least 1 hour earlier , because there is a big line . I could pick you up at your house at 8 , if that's ok with you . 
 Okay . 
 Yeah , that's great . I'll see you tomorrow night . 
 Bye , Ann ! 
 Thank you . Good evening , Mr.Dean . 
 I'm Helen Baker . 
 Glad to meet you , too . 
 I'm from New Zealand . 
 I'm a teacher . 
 I ’ m sure that the boy will become nobody when he grows up . 
 Eat humble pie ? Impossible , I ’ Ve never been wrong in judging boys like him . 
 Don't mention it . It's been my pleasure . 
 OK . I will . 
 Honey , the house is such a mess ! I need you to help me tidy up a bit . My boss and her husband are coming over for dinner and the house needs to be spotless ! 
 This can ’ t wait ! I need your help now ! 
 Ok , here ’ s a list of chores we need to get done . I'll do the dishes and get all the groceries for tonight.You can sweep and mop the floors . Oh , and the furniture needs to be dusted . 
 Sure that ’ s fine . Here is the list of all the things you need to get . Don't forget anything ! And can you pick up a bottle of wine on your way home ? 
 Great ! Can you set the table ? 
 Wait ! Don ’ t turn it on ... 
 What are you thinking ? 
 Well , what kind of dessert do you want ? 
 Do you know what kind you want ? 
 Did you want to know my favorite kind of pie ? 
 My absolutely favorite kind of pie is apple . 
 I'm happy to help . 
 Let's go in to wait for them . 
 It's quit a big cafeteria , isn't it ? 
 Let's line up . The steak is very inviting . I'll have it . 
 Banana pie . 
 How about there ? 
 Actually , the one-bedroom is the only vacant apartment right now . 
 No , not for a few months . 
 Hi , Martin . What can I do for you ? 
 That ’ s all right . Bring me over what you ’ Ve got . 
 This is the result of women ’ s liberation . 
 I have no idea . 
 Hi . I bought one of your vacuums from spend-wart . It ’ s broken now . 
 I think so . I bought it four months ago . 
 Okay . The model number is 6594 - c . 
 906 Ottawa street . My name is David Yang . My phone number is 713-786-0234 . 
 Could you tell me where the office is located ? 
 Oh , I know that place . It ’ s only two minutes drive . 
 All right . Thank you very much for your help . 
 Taylor , you're sweating up a storm ! 
 Yeah , you look a little shaky . And pale . You seriously need some time in the sun . 
 We're just worried about you , Taylor . 
 Do you think I should ask Bob to help ? Will he come ? 
 That ’ s right . But I have bothered him several times . 
 We must set 1000 dollars aside each month . 
 We are going to buy our own house . 
 Would you allow me to drive your car ? 
 Surely I will . 
 Oh , no . We ’ re going to be late for the meeting . 
 Oh , good . 
 Well , cabs are more expensive than the bus or the subway . It ’ ll probably cost around six dollars . 
 I can ’ t find the business card . Do you know the address ? 
 Right . 
 Is that you , Bob ? 
 Oh I ’ m sorry . I think I ’ ll call later . Thank you . 
 Here's ten . Keep the change . 
 A magic love potion ? 
 It can't be true . 
 So what am I going to do ? 
 That sounds like a blue rose ! My sitting by his bed ? 
 Hi , have you got the exact number of people who are going take part in this activity ? 
 They always push the time . How many of them are over fifty ? 
 OK , I see . As far as you think , how many buses should we get for them ? 
 I'll call the bus charter later . And have you announced the itinerary of this journey to all of them ? 
 That's possible . At that time , they can choose any activity they like . 
 Let me think ! Pills for carsick , traditional medicine for cold , some painkillers and something like that . 
 One more thing , have you got all people's phone numbers ? 
 DO you have any plan for your future ? 
 Many people are striving for going abroad nowadays.It seems to be a trend . 
 Tom set the whole country by the ears with his discovery . 
 He was very clever when he was a boy . 
 I need to buy a new refrigerator today . 
 I like that Kenmore refrigerator . 
 Tell me about it . 
 What are the appliances . 
 I'd like to see it for myself . 
 I like what I see . 
 Again ? 
 Your clock never works . Perhaps you should buy a new one . 
 Is Water Shrinking Festival official ? 
 Don't you think these festivals are more interesting ! 
 We are doing Secret Santa at the office again this year . 
 I got Jacob . Any ideas what to get him ? 
 Yeah , you ’ re right . Can ’ t go wrong with that . 
 Hi , I'm looking into your loans and I'm a little confused about the interest rates . Could you give me some advice ? 
 I understand . I'm interested in the Petty Consumer Loan . 
 So , the rate could fluctuate a little , depending on the amount given by the PBC ? 
 I'm going to have to do some more research into this . Thanks for your help , bye for now . 
 You want to make sure it's good solid habit before anything else takes its place , like work ? 
 And where are we going to go ? 
 Are we going all out or just starting with a mini family vacation ? 
 Well , I was looking in this magazine the other day and cruises are not very expensive at all . Take a look at this ! 
 I would like to fight my ticket . 
 Yes , the officer is here today . 
 I was pulled over for running a red light , but I never did . 
 There was a camera on the signal . So , he was obviously lying . 
 A picture of my license plate was never taken . 
 Thank you . I'm glad that you believe me . 
 Three bags and a suitcase . This is my luggage to check . 
 No . 
 How much is the excess baggage part charge ? 
 Here you are . 
 Thank you ! 
 Is it really necessary to wear all this protective gear ? 
 How long will the tour take ? 
 Okay ... 
 Now that we know what kind of music we will play , we have to decide what each of us will do . 
 Oh yeah ! I'm a great rapper . And I know all the Vanilla Ice lyrics by heart . 
 Personal Finance Department , Lucie speaking , how may I help ? 
 That's no problem . What exactly would you like to know ? 
 We have a wonderful new service which provides a wide range of banking services , 24/7 , wherever you are . 
 And the cover is great ! The colors are brilliant ! 
 OK , you got me . So , do you have a subscription ? 
 So what do you do with all the out-dated issues ? 
 I can't believe how hot it is . 
 That means it will get hotter . 
 Turn on the air conditioner . 
 What happened ? 
 Did you call the repairman ? 
 When is he coming ? 
 What do you want to do in this company after five years ? 
 Why do you think so ? 
 What are you looking for in your next job ? 
 What is your career objective ? 
 What do you consider important when looking for a job ? 
 What sport do you like the most ? 
 Me too . Did you play when you were a kid ? 
 What position did you play ? 
 I hate third base . It's scary when the ball is coming at you so fast . 
 I played outfield . I hated the infield because I never figured out all the bounces . 
 I'm on a softball league . It's not fast pitch , but it's still fun . You wanna join our group ? 
 We play either Tuesdays or Thursdays . 
 Can you speak French ? 
 Can you understand your Spanish teacher ? 
 About 40 percent , if he speaks slowly.When he speaks fast , I can only catch a word here and there . But Mr . Wang is an excellent Chinese teacher.With his help , my Chinese is getting better and better e 
 I don't know what to have . If you don't mind , I'll just leave the choice to you . 
 OK . Anything to drink ? 
 I'll try the soya-bean milk this time . 
 That's right . 
 I would like to have a continental breakfast . 
 Well , could I have coffee instead of orange juice ? 
 I've never been to a restaurant like this before . 
 That's a good word to describe it . 
 I am hungry . I think I could eat a large by myself . 
 I'm in the mood for a Californian . 
 I had a terrible journey back from Bangkok last week . 
 Well , first of all , the taxi that was taking me from the client's office to the airport broke down on the freeway . 
 Yes , and the driver didn't speak any English or Chinese and he didn't have a phone on him-can you believe it ? - and his radio didn't work . So there was no way he could get in touch with the office to get them to send another taxi . 
 Well , I actually thumbed a lift . 
 Yes , I stood on the side of the freeway and stuck my thumb out , and a passing truck stopped and took me to the airport . 
 Yes , except he drove really slowly , and I missed my flight . 
 Yes , so I had to wait three hours for the next one . I didn't get home till four in the morning , and when I got home I realized I'd left my house keys in my hotel in Bangkok . 
 Seems like it . 
 It is beautiful . 
 Actually , there is a problem . 
 There are some stains that were left in the carpet . 
 Oh , is that right ? 
 That was the only problem that I saw . 
 I honestly love it . 
 Oh , great . Where was it ? 
 What was it doing there ? 
 You mean Johnny threw out all the dinnerware ? 
 What do you think of doctor Thomson ? 
 How can you be so sure ? 
 Never believe his words . 
 Not at all . I ’ m an agnostic . do you ? 
 I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one . 
 I ’ m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong . 
 Religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics . 
 Do you have any questions before you commit yourself to this ? 
 The subscription fee is charged at a rate of 1.2 % . But for redeeming , a rate of a usual 0.5 % , we shall charge you 1.6 % if you apply to buy it after the fund-raising period . 
 I'm afraid so , yes . There is always some risk on the buyer's part . 
 I've got a really bad headache and my stomach hurts . 
 Honey , could you help me operate the VD player ? It can't play . 
 I think so . 
 I'm too careless . 
 No . 
 It's a new disk . 
 Here you are . 
 What's your favorite season ? 
 Yeah , and all those fun summer sports and activities . 
 Oh , me too ! All the family getting together ... 
 I like the feeling then that school is almost over ! 
 Hey Julie , you want to go grab something to eat ? 
 I really feel like having a big juicy steak ! 
 I didn't know you were a vegetarian ! 
 A what ? 
 Wow ! That's interesting ! It must be tough ! 
 What's up ? 
 Next Saturday , I'm going to have a party . 
 You are coming ? 
 Why is that ? 
 Why not ? 
 I understand , I guess . 
 We have mild wines and strong liquors . Which kind do you prefer ? 
 It's my pleasure . Actually , it's really hard to say as individual tastes are different . As for myself , I'd like to recommend gin and tonic . 
 Hi Barbara . Have you lost weight ? 
 Wow . You look great . 
 What type of diet were you on ? 
 That's amazing . What tips did your trainer give you ? 
 That doesn't make sense . If you eat more , than how do you lose weight ? 
 That makes sense . I'm going to try that . 
 I have a little gut I have been trying to get rid of . 
 Thanks for the advice . 
 How often does the bus run ? 
 Oh , here comes a bus ! 
 What do you think are the main causes of war today ? 
 It seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country . 
 How do you think they could be ended ? 
 So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a programme to make the country richer . If the problem is resources , share them . 
 Yes . It is . One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive . 
 Wow ! What happened to you ? You look sad . 
 That's unbelievable . Why did this happen ? 
 I cant't believe it . You've worked here for years . 
 There's a 20 percent service charge in this hotel . 
 That's for the hotel restaurant . You had five meals here . 
 Ann ! Don ’ t you see the children are making so much noise here ? Why don ’ t you keep them occupied and out their mother ’ s hair ? 
 Good idea ! Well , Joan , I have something important to tell you . 
 I want to enrich my knowledge in management . The United States is an ideal place for me . 
 Before I work in the office , I was a teacher . So if possible , I'd like to come back to some school to pass on my new knowledge to more people . 
 Yes . You know , English is my present working language . Besides , I scored very high in TOEFL . 
 I will support myself . In recent years , I have saved enough money for my study in the U . S . 
 I will be there for three years . 
 What ’ s wrong ? That was a great goal . 
 Looks like you ’ re going to lose out on this game then . 
 What were the odds ? 
 Too bad . 
 That's Susan . 
 She's a lawyer . 
 No , but she speaks English fluently . 
 Yes , I know her . We're friends . 
 Which man ? 
 Oh , that's Matt . 
 Yeah . 
 I don't know him , but I think my sister does . 
 Yes , he's married . 
 Do you mind if I ask you a question ? 
 What do you do in order to improve your English ? 
 It ’ s a good idea to have a radio , isn ’ t it ? 
 It takes a long time to learn a language , doesn ’ t it ? 
 Hello . What can I do for you ? 
 I see . Do you have your Current All-in-one Passbook with you ? I'll need your password for this transaction . 
 And how much of your salary would you like ? 
 Help me sort out my problem , will you ? 
 I know it ’ s so costly , but ... 
 Excuse me , I wonder if you can help me . 
 I'm completely lost . I'm looking for the Empire State Building . 
 Great . Thanks a lot . 
 I know ! I hate it ! But I ’ m taking this crash course in math . 
 I have to take my exams for getting into the university , so I need to prepare . 
 It has to ! I ’ Ve been studying every day , eight hours a day ! I don ’ t know , but the school has a great success record . 
 I ’ ll pick up an application form for you at school tomorrow . 
 I'm looking for books on WTO.Could you show me where they are ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Sally , you look so corporate ! What interview do you have today ? 
 Yeah , I guess so . I've never actually heard of this one , but ... 
 You didn't read their brochure or anything , did you ? 
 Well , they are progressive and humanistic-maybe they don't care about nail polish ... uh ... even blue nail polish . Just keep your confidence up and you'll do great . 
 Not quite the only one . I really wanted that job at the magazine , but I still haven't heard from them . 
 This is Professor Clark speaking . 
 Yes , what can I do for you ? 
 My goodness ! Are you OK ? 
 How long will you be out of class ? 
 Fine . Well , thanks for calling and letting me know you will be absent . I hope you feel better soon . 
 What's it like ? 
 Who are the bad guys ? 
 Wow ! Where's the treasure ? 
 How do you find it ? 
 Great ! 
 I'm not sure , what about you ? 
 Sure sounds good to me . 
 You ! 
 You told Martha that I was on a date ? What was that all about ? 
 She started feeling suspicious after you said that . 
 Martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that Sara was just a friend . Now , I have to explain to Sara that I can't hang around her because of you . 
 Don't bother . 
 What's your address , sir ? 
 Ok , someone will be there by 12:15 . 
 It's 2 dollars initially and 35 cents for each quarter mile . 
 No , I'll send a larger vehicle to pick you up . 
 For sure ! I didn ’ t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the US . 
 Well , they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401K ? 
 That ’ s interesting and logical I guess . In my country , we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund , but most people don ’ t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that . 
 Yeah , but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions , so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank . 
 Who are those guys ? 
 Oh . 
 All right ! 
 Wow , Michael Jordan ’ s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch . 
 Which team do you think will win ? 
 Hey , Mike . You've been surfing the Net for quite a while . What on earth are you searching for ? 
 Well , roughly speaking , a hacker is a computer buff . 
 You can say that . 
 They must have mixed hackers with crackers . 
 There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers , but they aren't . They break into computers and break the phone system . Real hackers call these people crackers , and want nothing to do with them . 
 Well , the real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy , irresponsible and not very bright , and feel that being able to break security does make you a hacker any more than being able to start cars without keys makes you an automotive engineer . Unfortunately , many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word hacker to describe crackers . This irritates real hackers to no end . 
 You got it . 
 You are welcome . 
 Thanks . 
 Lamb and beef . It will get even tastier when we add the veggies ! 
 So ? 
 You'll be OK . It's just a little bit ... 
 I ’ m sorry she is not in at the moment . Can I take a message ? 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Did you send in your Continued Claim Form for the last period ? 
 You need to be very careful to send that form in every two weeks if you want to get paid . 
 You should look at your claim form and see if it has been more than fourteen days since it was due . If it hasn ’ t been , we will still accept it . 
 Actually , you cannot mail it in early , as it needs to reflect all of the information up to the due date . 
 Your check will arrive a little late . 
 I think the gears have seized up 
 I am sorry to trouble you again , Mr.Stone . 
 Where should I go after I arrived at the university ? 
 Why ? 
 What kind of role do foreign student advisers play ? 
 Can we get any more help at the International Center ? 
 I see . It must be worth going to . 
 Wonderful . It is a home for foreign students . 
 Thank you for organizing this great baby shower for me ! I ’ Ve always been to baby showers but never actually had one held for me ! Let ’ s get started ! 
 Oh look ! What a great little bib for the baby ! This will definitely come in handy ! Oh wow , you also got me a stroller ! That ’ s so great ! Thank you ! 
 A highchair and car seat ! Wow Betty , thank you so much ! I really appreciate it ! 
 A playpen and crib ! Thanks Carla ! This is just what I needed ! 
 Umm . I think my water just broke ! Get me to a hospital ! 
 Hi , I'd like to order some flowers . 
 They're for my Wife . Her name is Samantha . 
 I don't know . I don't know too much about flowers . Can you recommend something ? 
 Today's her birthday and she told me she wants me to buy her flowers . 
 I'm not sure . I know I should know that , but I can't remember right now . 
 Roses will be fine . 
 I think red would be nice . 
 Can you deliver them , please ? 
 241 Main street . 
 Sorry , sir , in order to protect these paintings , taking photos are strictly forbidden here . 
 I am really sorry for that . 
 She'd better drink plenty of hot water and lie in bed . 
 Don't worry . She will be all right . 
 It's a man-made wonder . I've seen it many times in textbooks and it's part of my dream to visit it . 
 That's true . 
 Yes , I think so . I have just checked out . But I left my book in the room . Can I get it back ? 
 Yes , thank you very much . 
 Hi ! Do you want a fill-up ? 
 Which type of gas do you want ? Regular , Super , or Premium Unleaded ? 
 Regular is $ 1.15 , Super is $ 1.25 and Premium is $ 1.39 . 
 Do you want me to check the tires and the fluids ? 
 Would you mind waiting a while ? 
 I'm not sure . But I'll get a table ready as fast as I can . 
 Okay , here are the graphs and figures for this month's sales . Let's review them all together . 
 I think you are looking at the wrong line . The rapid drop in sales wasn't our hair products . You are correct , the hair product sales decreased slightly , but not dramatically . The one that didn't do so hot this month was the cleaning products . I think there was a problem in the marketing plan . Some people were offended by our advertisements for the cleaning products , but it was already too late to mitigate the damage , so our mistake shows up in the sales . 
 That is our one major success . If you look at the other graphs , you can see that most of the other product lines remained steady with little increase . 
 Did you see the woman that just left my office ? 
 She's another applicant , and a leading contender , but I didn ’ t want to hire her . She ’ s qualified , but she doesn ’ t quite fit the profile . We ’ re looking for an accountant , and part of the job requires interacting with clients . Well , our clients want conservative people to handle their money . And green hair with ripped jeans doesn ’ t exactly fill them with trust . 
 I realize that , but our business is serving clients and giving them what they want . 
 Well , they don ’ t want to deal with people who look like that . They want people who look more like yourself . 
 Well , they ’ re older , and they don ’ t understand today's fashions . When they see someone dressed like that , warning bells go off . They don ’ t like that style at all , and they don ’ t like dealing with people who dress like that at work . 
 We used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good , very good . But , the clients reacted very negatively when they saw her . Some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively . 
 Well , she was a very good employee and we wanted to keep her , so her supervisor called her in for a chat and laid it on the line for her . She got the idea and now she saves the trendy styles for evenings and weekends . 
 Good afternoon . 
 Yes , we have a reservation for three nights.Mona White . I called last week . 
 Yes , that was for two single rooms , wasn't it ? 
 Are they quiet rooms ? 
 but there's a lovely view . 
 Of course 
 I know , sweetie . Just open wide . Don't talk . 
 Oh , you've got a fever . One-oh-one ... time to break out the children's Tylenol . 
 We're not turning on the heater in May ! You need to take a bath . We'll heat you up and see if you can sweat this thing out . 
 Well , well , Mike.Fancy meeting you here . 
 Yes , I haven't seen you for four years.How time flies ! 
 I got stuck in traffic again . There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection . 
 I don't think it can be avoided , to be honest . 
 I think it's something that I'll have to consider . The public transport system is pretty good . 
 I know . I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city . 
 the only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car . 
 that's true . I could certainly use the exercise ! 
 yes , it's not good for me or for the environment . 
 Hey Matt . I'm going to ask Martha to marry me ? 
 I always knew she was the one , but I decided to pop the big question about 2 weeks ago . I'm just debating on how to do it . 
 So how did you propose ? 
 What do you think I should do ? 
 I never thought about that . 
 Asking her father in front of her . How do you think she will react ? 
 I think that's the idea I was looking for . Thanks , man . 
 Excuse me , sir , but you have to put your bags here before entering the market . 
 Yes , it's on the third floor . 
 He's the poor kid's father . 
 Yes , very . 
 Yes , we are almost ready to order . 
 Oh , that all sounds so good ! Can we get the sauce on the side ? 
 I was wondering if you have any vegetarian choices . 
 I think that I would like to order the broccoli noodles , please . 
 Please bring our salads to us now . We are hungry ! 
 Well , since you have order the roast chicken . I suggest you to order the red wine to go with the main course . It can help you digest the food . 
 I think whiskey will be a good choice . 
 At the drop of a hat . 
 Yes , speaking . Can I help you ? 
 I am happy to hear that and I'll accept that . 
 No , I am single . 
 I met him through a computer bulletin board . 
 It was one I used down at the local coffee house called the San Francisco Net . It's been around since around 1991 . 
 You ought to . One dollar buys you 15 minutes of computer time . A Chat session links you with cappuccino sippers in other cafes and also to home computers on the network . 
 That's the whole point . All your inhibitions disappear because you can ’ t see the other person . This network allows you to talk to people whom you normally wouldn ’ t talk to . 
 You can do that . A private session lets two people talk alone . This techno-chat program lets you talk about anything with everybody , without prejudice because you can ’ t see them . 
 That's fine with me , but we'll have to get there early . Because after 8 pm , there is always a long line . 
 It sure is . 
 Certainly . It's right over there . 
 I'd like to open a one-year time deposit account and a checking account . 
 Okay , here are the forms . Can I use traveler's checks to open the account ? 
 Okay , here you are . 
 You should wear a tie to go with your suit . 
 It doesn't matter . Just do your best to sell yourself . 
 Yeah , about . 
 Oh , definitely . I remember , when I first arrived in Guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone . 
 I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation . 
 I am not exaggerating at all . I ’ m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time . 
 Yes , absolutely true . 
 Yet in writing , George has nothing on Frank . 
 It's Mrs Bardot , isn't it ? 
 I'm Greg Wu , Head of Consultancy . I see that you'd like a credit check done for your company . Is that right ? 
 I see . So , it's not for your company , it's for the prospective partner ? 
 I couldn't agree more . If you have the company details with you I can get on with that right away . Is there anything else that you need from us today ? 
 We do indeed . Such as making trade investments , financial consultancy , and of course the service you requested . 
 I don ’ t think I can take another semester of this dorm food . 
 Sure , like taste , variety , nutritional value , what I should do is move into an apartment off campus where I can cook for myself . 
 You know how hard it is to find a decent place at this time of year ? 
 I got a car , so the distance wouldn ’ t really be a problem . 
 You bet ! 
 Yes . I'd like to swap some of my peanuts for your chips . 
 Do you have any ketchup ? 
 hello , do you remember me ? I bought some vases from you yesterday . 
 that's right . I thought I'd come back to buy some more souvenirs . 
 well , first , I'd like to buy a few postcards . My sister used to always send a postcard to herself whenever she went anywhere . I want to do that , too . 
 posters are difficult to travel with . I think I'll just buy the postcards . I heard that you might also have some of the masks that are made in Venice . 
 how much do they cost ? 
 yes , I think I'd like the green mask in the middle . 
 I'll take it , I'd also like to buy some chocolate . 
 yes , it's my girlfriend's birthday today and she loves chocolate . 
 they look delicious . I think she'll be pleased . 
 What do you mean by cautious ? 
 Thats a clever way to escape responsibility . 
 Eight altogether . 
 Six are compulsory , two optional . 
 I would like to go but I have to finish a very important presentation . Our boss needs it for tomorrow ’ s morning meeting and I was given the complete information only late this afternoon . 
 Oh , that will be great . Thank you so much . Please help me to double-check the name list . I have to make sure they are all correct . 
 Not for me . It is already late . I can not fall asleep after drinking coffee this late . 
 By all means . (= Of course . ) 
 Yes . I would like to place a collect call . 
 Terry and his number is 4562325 8 . 
 Hi there . Do you need any help ? 
 First of all , you should open a Fund Account with us , just fill in this form . We'll need to see some ID and your Cash Card .

 Yes , we'll need to fill in this form , for fund trading and this one , for subscribing for and / or applying for purchasing fund units . The minimum is 500 RIB . 
 I love stir fry crispy bitesize vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce . Wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts . Throw in some onion and garlic and ginger ! Mmm ! Mmm ! It ’ s almost lunchtime . I would die for a plate of stir fry right now ! 
 What ? You call that a stir fry ? More meat than vegetables ? That ’ s the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir fry . What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in ! What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap ! 
 Impossible ! Well , I'm not giving up yet . It's not over till the fat lady sings ! 
 Hmm . Let's see ... there was Good Morning , Vietnam , Dead Poet's Society , The Fisher King ... Three , right ? 
 You have a nice apartment . 
 She must have done a lot of work on it . 
 Well , I ’ d like to have my coat to order.Will you take my measurements ? 
 Make it after the present fashion , please.What if it does not fit ? 
 When can I expect to have it ? 
 Ok then . See you next weekend . 
 Of course , Mr . Kramer . How are things going these days ? 
 Congratulations ! I ’ m really glad to hear it ! That should make balancing the books a lot easier ! 
 Does it have to be this afternoon , Mr . Fairbanks ? I ’ Ve already made plans . 
 I ’ d appreciate that , sir . How long do you think you ’ ll need me to stay ? 
 Really ! I've never seen so much work . 
 I don't know . I have no idea . 
 I'm not good at sports , I have never played tennis , and I know I would be terrible . 
 OK , but don't say I didn't warn you . 
 Thanks.This is fun ! 
 No one has ever tried to show me how to play a sport before.Maybe I should learn to do something . 
 Do you really think I can be a good player ? 
 Yes . This has been fun . 
 Which John ? Mr.Turnbow ’ s son ? 
 And he ’ s bright and intelligent . I ’ m sure he can pass the university entrance exam . 
 How ’ s your boy , Jack ? 
 Poor boys ! They work harder at school nowadays , don ’ t they ? 
 Have you heard of the Love Bug ? 
 Yes . It is one of the most harmful computer viruses in the world . People say it will break out again om Valentines ' Day this year . 
 Hackers are smart , and they want people to know about it . 
 Very good . Now , I have a couple of final questions . 
 Well , why should we hire you ? 
 Impressive ! So , what would you consider to be your greatest weakness ? 
 Great ... Well , let me tell you that I am very pleased with this interview . We are short-listing our candidates this week , and next week we will inform our short listed candidates of the day and time for a second interview with our CEO . 
 When ’ re you getting married ? 
 Why so late ? Didn ’ t she want to get married this October ? 
 That ’ s really a shame . By the way , who will be the bridesmaid ? 
 Wow ! I ’ m very excited about your ceremony . 
 Well , that depends . Tell me where you want to go ? 
 That's interesting to travel by boat to see the whole city that is between the sea and sky . But personally I like Greek better . 
 Get changed ! 
 Repair service , how may I help you ? 
 How old is your phone ? 
 The wire in your phone might have gotten rusty . Could you bring your phone into our office ? We'll clean it for you . 
 We're located at 132 West Street . 
 From 9A . M . to 5 P . M . 
 No problem . See you this afternoon . 
 Really ? Well , thanks for saying so . 
 Sure . Why not ? 
 OK . 
 I'm free . What's up ? 
 Oh , I just remembered I've got a report to write . 
 Here you are . 
 Sure . I think filet steak will be a good choice . It's the best local food . 
 Who is responsible for the accident ? Is it Tony ’ s fault ? 
 You mean Tony is the victim ? No , I don ’ t think so . He ’ s equally responsible because he tried to overtake you . 
 I think I'll get some new goggles . 
 We also need some sunscreen . What about beach towels ? 
 I think I'll get a hat , too . 
 Okay , I guess that's it . Let's go pay for this stuff . 
 Of course . I fed them today . 
 Sure , I'll give them a bath . 
 I remember . What time do they need to be there ? 
 All right . I'll make sure and remember . 
 I'm afraid so . 
 I'm easy to approach and friendly to everyone . 
 I'm quite outgoing , I think . 
 I don't agree with someone else's opinion if I think he's wrong , but when I understand his thinking and see he has some good ideas , then I'm very happy to go along with him . 
 I said it's a lovely day . Why don't we go for a walk ? 
 Come on ! A little labor , much health . 
 Don't take too long . It would be a shame not to take advantage of such lovely weather . 
 Believe I will . Look for me near the lake . 
 It was a piece of cake . 
 I almost did ! Actually , I don't know that much about coffee , even though I sell it . 
 Thanks . Maybe if things slow down later I'll stop by your table . 
 Rita . Nice to meet you . 
 Of course I won't chill out . Opportunity knocks only once . 
 You're right . I will have a talk to her about that . 
 I've just had some money sent from Germany , in Euros . 
 I have my passport right here , and here are the account details . The name , number ... 
 That was quick ! I didn't expect it to come through so quickly . Yes , that is good news . The full amount should be 20,000 Euros , is that right ? I'd like to withdraw 5,000 Euros worth of local currency , if that's possible . 
 I like small towns . 
 Not always , and there're also few cars ! 
 May I help you ? 
 Do you have a reservation ? 
 I'm sorry , Ma'am . I can't find anything under that name.Do you have your confirmation number ? 
 Well , let me look again . How do you spell your first name , Ma'am ? 
 I don't find a Carol in the computer for today . I have a Carol Larson here . But that reservation is for next Monday . 
 Are you sure he used your name , Ma'am ? Maybe he reserved under his name . 
 I'm sorry . I have nothing here . 
 Would you like to come to our factory for a visit ? 
 You can look around our new workshops and the automatic machines . 
 Who is this on the water buffalo ? 
 Oh yes , that was the best job in most farm families . That's where many of them learned to play the flute . 
 That's interesting . Go on ! 
 So he became a self-taught man ? 
 In what field ? 
 Is he still in that that type of work . 
 Would you want to be a senator ? 
 Excuse me . I think I have got lost in the Art Gallery . Can you tell me the way to the exit . 
 Thank you very much . I have been wondering here for almost half an hour . 
 Do you know anything about health food ? 
 Can you give me some examples ? 
 Really ? Why we must have warm and fresh water ? 
 Anything else ? 
 I really want to take a nap . I feel very sleepy today . 
 I fell asleep very late . It was almost two o ’ clock in the morning when I finally fell asleep . 
 You know how it is when you ’ re in a strange country . Everything is new , and you get tired and nervous sometimes . Then you worry about your family , about conditions back home , about your courses , about your money , about everything . I tried to fall asleep but I just had too much on my mind . 
 Anything is worth a try . But right now I really just want to find a quiet place to take a nap . 
 Hi , Alex ! 
 I just got back from London . 
 It was OK . There was a lot of turbulence , though . 
 It was 10 hours . 
 Yes , in paris , France . 
 Yes . I bought two boxed of chocolate ? one for me and one for you ! 
 It was nothing . 
 This is he . 
 All right . 
 You're telling me ! There are thousands of people here . 
 This is almost like a Taiwanese night market ! I can't believe it ! 
 Oh , yeah . OK . I'll just buy smallthings ! 
 All right . 
 Thank you . 
 Really ? 
 It is a new park , isn't it ? 
 I guessed it . 
 Oh , how wonderful ! 
 Be brave , sir . It won't be long . I will fill out the form for you . What is your name ? 
 Alright Steve . Your social security number ? 
 Do you have medical insurance ? 
 Do you have your insurance card with you ? 
 Well , you can call it in later . You can phone us . 
 First I need to get your address . Try to move your arm as little as possible . 
 Good evening , Mr . Smith . 
 No . I haven ’ t had the pleasure . 
 How do you do , Mr . Wu ? Welcome . 
 Have a glass of wine , Mr . Wu ? And let me introduce you to some of my guests . 
 My fault . I didn't realize what time it was . 
 Not really . I'm telling the truth . 
 This is true , but it must've slipped my mind . 
 I know . I should've called . 
 You want to throw me out over this ? 
 That's fine , because if I leave , then your rules won't matter . 
 I've always got room for something sweet ! 
 I've never tried traditional Greek yogurt , so I want to try that first . 
 I believe they add locally produced honey to it . 
 do you want to try some of my yogurt . It's a favorite everyday dessert in Greece . 
 what do you think ? How does it taste ? 
 sure . I'll just have a bite . 
 it's absolutely delicious ! That is the best tiramisu I've ever had ! 
 ok . I've had one of those before . They're really sweet and crunchy . 
 I believe they are a local delicacy in the South . 
 yeah , why not ? We've already pigged out as it is ! 
 Can I make a reservation ? 
 7 o'clock tonight and there will be 5 persons . 
 Do you have a VIP room ? 
 May I help you ? 
 Is there a problem ? 
 You should look it up on our computer . 
 What came up ? 
 I can try to get the book from a different library . 
 I will call you when I find it . 
 From the looks of this house from the outside , I don ’ t really think that I want to go inside . 
 I am not impressed by the interior of this house . 
 With so few windows , how can you even see what the problems are ? 
 Where are you supposed to store things without any cabinet space ? 
 Is there a dead animal somewhere in here ? 
 I am calling to apply to work in your agency of entry . 
 Yes . I know many ambassadors in Chinese Embassy and British Embassy in China . 
 Excuse me , where can I find a guide ? 
 Thanks a lot . Have a nice day . 
 Why are you cut up recently , Nancy ? 
 Oh , cheer up . A boyfriend is not everything . 
 It looks like our company trip will have to be canceled because of the typhoon . 
 How often do you have English lessons ? 
 How do you practice ? 
 Do you ever speak to native speakers of English ? 
 Hello , what can I do for you ? 
 Don't worry . I will help you soon . Please fill in this form first . And write down your name , your account number and the amount in your card please . 
 OK . May I see your ID card ? ( B passed his ID card . ) Please wait for a moment . Let me go and check the account . ( A few minutes later . ) We have locked your card . You can come here to renew the account and get a new card a week later . Your money will not be lost . 
 Please pay 10 yuan , the handling charge . 
 See you ! 
 Can you believe this ? I locked my keys in the car , and I have to go to the airport to pick up my aunt . 
 I don't know ... Hey , do you think I could borrow your car for a few hours ? 
 Well , could you drive me home ? I have spare keys there . 
 Oh , and Andy ? Do you have a quarter for the phone ? My wallet's in the car . 
 No , that's it . Thanks . I really appreciate it . 
 I ’ m a sales manager in a publishing company . 
 Oh , mostly fiction , lots of romance , science fiction , biography , stuff like that . 
 About two years now . 
 Yes , I'd like to have a share of steak . 
 I like it well-done , please . 
 One Whisky . 
 I want to rent skis and boots . 
 Thank you . I am a learner so can you tell me where I can find a ski instructor ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 You ’ re welcome . Can I ask you what brings you to China ? 
 Oh , very nice . How long will you be in Beijing ? 
 Oh , I see . Well , I ’ ll give you my phone number and if you need a guide , please call me . 
 I wish to make it clear at the outset that this matter of labels is entirely our problem . 
 The Federal Food and Drug Administration , or the FDA as we call it for short , imposes a whole set of regulations on the import of food products to the United States . Over the years , they have become so rigid and complicated that they are now quite a head - ache for us importers . 
 Ah , there's something in what you're saying . According to the present FDA regulations , the Ma Ling Labels then cannot be used if the lichee is to be offered for import into the United States . 
 I'd be quite willing to if I could , but we must comply with the label requirements according to our law , or we can't clear the consignment of lichee through the Customs . 
 Would you consider quoting us for the order with neutral cans on a C . I . F . basis for delivery in Hong Kong ? Our associated company there will have the labels printed to comply with the FDA regulations . 
 You get your bus pass ? 
 You're not ? 
 It actually costs less if you have a bus pass . 
 You can use it however many times you need to . 
 Yup , and you can keep the money in your pocket . 
 You should go get yours . 
 How many people are there in your family ? 
 I have a large family . I have three older sisters , my twin sister , a younger brother , and my parents . 
 We're identical . I mean , we look exactly the same , but we complete opposites when it comes to everything else ! 
 We used to be really close , but that all changed once she moved to Shanghai . How about your family ? You didn't mention to your biological father . 
 What about your step-brother's mother ? Does he keep in touch with her ? 
 Sounds like it was ment to be . 
 It was a real red letter day for you . 
 How's your brother doing ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . What's the matter ? 
 I'll tell him . Thanks for asking about him . 
 I'd like to withdraw 35,000 RIB from my Corporate Account . 
 Yes , my name is Ms Jane Reeve , R-E-E-V-E . 
 Here you go . 
 Oh , how silly of me . Can we correct it here ? 
 Have you been served , sir ? 
 It's on the fourth floor . 
 What a nice photo you ’ Ve taken ! 
 You have a real talent , Ellen ! 
 Good afternoon , madam . Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Don't worry . I will try to get a taxi for you . You can take it to the bus station . 
 Don't mention it . It is my duty . 
 Are you looking forward to seeing that big concert next week ? 
 Oh , hey , Keri ! You cook , right ! You're a pretty good cook . 
 OK . I want to make an omelet , so actually this is really silly , I've never made one before . How do you make an omelet ? 
 OK . Yeah ! Yeah ! 
 Oh , OK . Wow ! 
 Wow . That sounds really good . 
 Wow . What fillings do you recommend ? 
 I have to talk to you ! 
 I know , Blake . But you ’ Ve been avoiding me all morning , and we have got to talk about this deal with the Mc Kinsey Food Company . 
 are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night ? 
 yes , I was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place . 
 that's what I thought you would do . Listen , I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . It's just down the street from all the bars . You probably don't want to be walking around after dark . 
 I wish it wasn't , but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here . 
 do me a favor , and take a taxi . It'd make me feel a lot better . 
 when I first moved in , I walked everywhere . But within a week , I had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station ! Now , I always take public transportation . 
 nothing else has happened to me , but I have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close . 
 Amy , could you help me with this work ? 
 Okay . 
 We could try it for the first few weeks and see if she likes it . 
 You have a good point . She hasn't really ever been away from home for longer than a few hours . 
 Yes , they seemed to click at the meeting the other day . 
 No , but I did notice that she was very interested in the art supplies ! 
 Of course . I will show you the fitting room . 
 Thank you for saying that . 
 You , too . 
 Yes . Do you have any flight to Paris on 15th ? I want one leaving in the afternoon . 
 Is it a direct flight ? 
 Well , I don't think I want it . 
 I stayed with my friends . 
 I'm sorry , Mum . 
 I think lifelong learning is the concept that it's never too soon or too late for learning 
 I don't think so . I think it's about your attitude towards learning . One should be open to new ideas , decisions , skills or behaviors . 
 You're right . Lifelong learning is about finding learning opportunities at all ages and in numerous contexts 
 Me too . To keep up with the changing world , one must be involved in lifelong learning and be ready to accept new things . 
 Really ? That's great ! I know that your company has a lot of clients in France . 
 I've been so stressed these days . 
 I don't know where to go for college , and what to major in . 
 And I also want to get scholarships to help me pay for the tuition . I want to get the burden off my family . 
 OK , OK . I'm so sorry . By the way , for you , is it more important to make money or to enjoy your work ? 
 OK , honey , stop dreaming . You should face the reality . 
 En , first you should be concentrated on what the teacher said in class . Second , I suggest you to take an additional course in some training center . 
 I think so . Because I've taken one to improve my oral English during summer vacation . 
 No , you do not have to . The handbag can be taken with you . There is the cart at the entrance . 
 Well , how old is your baby ? 
 The milk powder on the second level of the shelf is for the kids from 2 ages to 4 ages . I advice that you should buy the Wyeth brand , the source of milk is imported from New Zealand . 
 You can be assured of it . There are various nutritions which are beneficial for the growth of babies ' bone and cerebrum . 
 It is feeding-bottle as the free gift . 
 Are you free next thursday ? 
 A bunch of us in the office are planning a retiring party for Bob , he's been with the office for ages , so everyone was really surprised to hear he took early retirement . 
 Retirement age is still 65 , but I think more and more people are retiring earlier , I think Bob's in upper fifties already , he just looks pretty young . 
 Well , I think you prepare it well and capture good savings , retiring early can give you a lot more time for travel and other activities , you should get out and enjoy the life you still can't , don't you think ? 
 Hi Chris . I am glad to see you . Can you help me with my new computer ? 
 I bought it yesterday afternoon and they delivered it this morning at 10:45 . 
 I am not sure . I just can't connect to the net . 
 Of course , come in . 
 It was only 345 pounds . 
 I am on my way to the doctor now , but I should be back in about 45 minutes . Can I come back at around 3:15 ? 
 Hello . Do you like this jewelry ? I made most of these items myself . 
 My mother taught me some tricks of the trade . I've always loved jewelry . 
 I've been making these designs for over ten years . You can have a bracelet for ten dollars . 
 It's a deal ! 
 What's that ? 
 Don't worry about it . It's not new , it already has a few scratches . Did you get hurt ? 
 That's the most important thing . 
 Forget about it . 
 Maybe , but really I have fallen a couple of times and it's been hit once or twice as well . 
 Welcome to Flash Foot , sir.How can I help you ? 
 Do you have your negatives ? 
 What size do you want the prints ? 
 Okay , they ’ ll be ready for you in an hour . 
 Are you sure ? How do you know ? 
 Well , I heard that if you drink enough beer , you can speak foreign languages better ... 
 No , I'm used to having tea first . 
 No sugar , please . 
 It is just too much . Don ’ t you feel it is an exaggerating style to decorate offices in that way ? 
 Well , I doubt that . 
 Oh , yes . I reviewed your estimate . But it seems like the project blueprint you sent with the estimate is not quite what we had in mind . Did you get a copy of the specs for this project ? 
 No . Later we decided to opt for the prior outline , version 7 . 
 Hi Kevin , how was your year at college ? 
 It was good . Do you have a girlfriend at school ? 
 I do want to meet with you and take a look at your catalogue . We ’ re redecorating and are going to add some things . 
 Let ’ s put it down for 1:15 on Thursday . We ’ ll definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit . 
 Hello , can I help you ? 
 Sure . We have one on the second floor . 
 This is the first floor . The second floor is one level up . 
 That's just over there . On the right . 
 Yes , I'd like to get some gas . 
 Unleaded . My car is new . 
 Fill it up . I will have a tour tomorrow . 
 Yes , please . 
 Give me a quart of light oil . 
 Check the mirror . How do you like it ? 
 I think this one fits you . It's the new fashion style . 
 If you are staying here for a few days , we ’ d be delighted to see you at our factory . 
 Let us know when you are free . We ’ ll arrange the tour for you . 
 That ’ s for sure . You ’ ll know our products better after the visit . 
 Well , we can proceed with the order until after the Christmas holidays . Our factories will be closed for another week . 
 No problem . Once we get your purchase order , we will begin the execution of the order right away . 
 That will be fine . And I can promise you that you'll get the goods about two weeks after we get your purchase order . 
 Sure , I ’ d be glad to . What time frame did he have in mind ? 
 Mm , yeah , that ’ ll be great . Tell him I ’ ll see him then . 
 Yes , I have been always learning the Economics on my own . My dream is to get a master's degree in Economics . 
 Really ? It is amazing . I will apply for a position in your company . 
 No . 
 Of course not.There are so many people here today . 
 Oh , my God . I can't take it any more . 
 I am tired of doing that boring work . I just repeat doing counting everyday . It's so terrible . 
 You know I work with my professional knowledge not passion . Sometimes I don't know what the meaning of working is ? 
 Yes , that's in the past . Maybe I need to go to my psychologist for help . 
 I was full of ambitions before . But now I have no aim for my career . 
 That sounds interesting . But I don't know how to do that . 
 A training course ? That must be costly . 
 OK , let's have a try . 
 oh , Sam ! Is this your dog ? 
 Cindy , you're so cute . 
 I have a little white cat . 
 yes , cats are always gentle . and they don't need a lot of space since they're small . 
 not at all . They're quiet most of the time.But they can be every bit as affectionate as dogs . 
 absolutely . Believe it or not , I found my cat by a garbage can around my neighborhood two years ago . 
 yes . It was starving and looking for something to eat when I saw it . 
 now we get along very well . It makes me feel that I'm someone special . 
 No , but I'll be able to tomorrow . 
 Why don't you ask Bill if he can help ? 
 What can I do for you ? 
 They're in Aisle Two . 
 No , I can't . I'm sorry . I have to help my mother . We're going to move tomorrow . 
 No , it's not far . It's near our old house . 
 Sure . Thanks . 
 So I heard . 
 She went over the edge after her son was killed in an accident . 
 The process of actually making the offer is something that I will take care of for you . What price were you considering offering ? 
 Let ’ s leave some room on this offer . I think that three hundred and twenty thousand dollars is a fair offer in this housing market . 
 It is common practice to offer and then have a counter-offer . 
 The sellers are usually fairly quick to respond . They want to get things moving . 
 There really isn ’ t anything else to do right now except wait . You are already pre-qualified for your loan . 
 But Grandpa will be working . 
 I almost forget . 
 Yes , it's to my liking , too . 
 It's my dream . 
 Um , yes , please , I could really use some help . I'm going over to my boss'house for dinner tonight and don't know what kind of wine I should bring . 
 Well , his wife is Japanese . He said she makes really good sushi . 
 Why ? Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi ? 
 I see . So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay ? That's a white wine , right ? 
 Sauvignon Blanc ? What's that ? 
 Let's see . The label says it's got " attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp , mineral flavors and a bonedry finish . Serve chilled . " Oh , no , how long will it take to chill the wine ? I'm on my way to the dinner now . 
 All right . What varietal is that ? 
 And you think this is a good wine ? 
 Perfect ! I'll take it ! 
 What a surprise ! This is the best present I've ever received . 
 I love you , too . 
 Actually , I prefer to eat at home , and then we'll have more time to have a chat . 
 Ahahah ! What is that thing on your couch ! It just moved ! 
 You have a pet lizard ? Somehow I never would have imagined that . 
 Does it bite or scratch ? 
 Wow . He's heavy ! And his skin feels really cool . 
 You're spending a very long time on my hair . 
 I needed you to be done and finished an hour ago . 
 Are you sure you're finished ? 
 You did a horrible job on my hair . 
 I don't like anything about it . 
 That's fine , but I'm not paying for it . 
 Where are you going ? 
 I didn ’ t know you were taking any kind of class . Tell me about it . 
 What for ? 
 I really admire you for that . How is it going ? 
 Are you really dating with Frank ? 
 Then why not keep away from him ? 
 That ’ s stupid . 
 There are different ways of conducting a job search . Do you know what you want to do ? 
 Can you work part-time or full-time ? 
 The binders have current local jobs listings and the computer jobs lists are good too . Understand ? 
 Schedule an appointment with a counselor and you can get more information . Would that work for you ? 
 Everything that you need for a successful job search is here . Happy job searching ! 
 I found the ideal position . I ’ m working for a plumbing company . 
 Plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge , and creativity . I love this job . 
 I didn ’ t , but I applied for an apprenticeship , and since I studied math , AND I have a good attitude 4 , my application was accepted . 
 Excuse me , could you please turn on the air-conditioner , it's so hot here . 
 Aha , it's cool now . Can I keep the robot ? 
 So can we play PlayStation later ? 
 All my games are so lame , Mom . When can I get a new one ? 
 Right on . I'm gonna get a new game ! 
 I knew there would be a catch ! 
 Except housework , that is . 
 If they steal the entire package , that would be theft . So they don't do that . Generally , thieves open the case and take part of the contents out . Then fill the case so that the gross weight will be the same . 
 The insurance policy protects us . 
 It's absolutely true in the United States that losses from pilferage have been limited to high valued goods . We must study more about packing . 
 Oh I didn ’ t go . I stayed at home with my family . 
 We watched lots of television and films . 
 Yes , we ate a delicious meal and drank some very good wine . 
 Do you like the room ? 
 $ 300 per month . 
 At the beginning of the month . Besides , you should pay me $ 1000 as deposit . 
 Yeah . 
 Yes . I bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted . 
 Partly , and he's also a hard working man . 
 I ’ m on my way to work . 
 I work at the polling place . 
 I do this every year . 
 I applied online . 
 I enjoy working there every year . 
 They pay just enough . 
 Good coming . I would like to open a new account . I want to deposit 500 dollars . 
 Could you tell me how many kinds there are in your bank ? 
 Oh , I think I'd like to take the monthly savings account then . 
 OK . Here you are . 
 Thank you . Goodbye . 
 Good afternoon , sir , is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Well , it's our fault.We are sorry for that.Would you please fill out the form ? We will pay for you . 
 Could you give some information on your European tours ? 
 I would be interested in a ten-day trip around Christmas time . 
 What is the cost ? 
 That sounds reasonable . Let me think it over . And I'll call your back to make reservation . 
 It's almost Christmas . What are you doing this weekend ? 
 Well , I still haven't finished my Christmas shopping . Do you want to go shopping with me this weekend ? 
 Friday's not good . I think the stores will be very crowded and I have to work . 
 Yeah , that's fine . 
 233-331-8828 . Let me give you my email address too . It's Tom861@gmail.com 
 OK . 
 I'm afraid not . He has a meeting tomorrow morning . 
 No , that's not good either . But give me your phone number and I'll call you if somebody cancels . 
 Has the game started yet ? 
 Who's winning ? 
 What ! That wasn't a foul ! C ’ mon , ref ! 
 You were right ! He didn ’ t make the shot ! 
 Did you see that ? He traveled and the ref didn ’ t call it ! 
 Okay ... end of the first quarter ... Alright , I ’ m gonna make a beer run . 
 Can I speak to Miss Cooper please ? 
 Engaged.Oh , dear ! Could you tell her it's a long-distance call ? 
 How long do you think she'll be ? 
 Can I leave a message , please ? 
 Can you tell her I'm waiting to speak to her ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Here ’ s an ad . about a big sale of washing machine . Do you want to see it ? 
 This cake is excellent . Where did you buy it ? 
 What ’ s wrong with you ? Why are you scratching so much ? 
 Let me have a look . Whoa ! Get away from me ! 
 I think you have chicken pox ! You are contagious ! Get away ! Don ’ t breathe on me ! 
 Well in the meantime you are a biohazard ! I didn ’ t get it when I was a kid and I ’ Ve heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult ! 
 Would you like to go to the theater with me tomorrow ? 
 That's coincidence , someone's just returned two tickets and I picked them . 
 Evening . 
 Stalls . 
 Kim , have you made contact with Mr . Lee ? 
 What seems to be the problem ? 
 Maybe his phone is out of order . Anyway , keep working on it . I really need an answer about the contract I sent him . 
 I don't know . I think you might be over the hill . 
 Mountain biking is an Olympic sport ? 
 I'd like to speak to Robert . 
 Hello , Robert . This is Frank . I'm coming to Guangzhou on the the 7th and I'd like to call in to discuss the project plan . 
 Well , my flight leaves at 8 a . m . , and I'll arrive at 10 a . m . Shall we say 11 o'clock ? 
 Oh , yes . That's fine with me . Maybe we can have lunch together . 
 Why is the car before us stopping ? 
 Look . Two cars are standing right in the middle of the road and the drivers are shouting rude words to each other . That's why that car stops . 
 Yes . This is what is called road rage . 
 I'd like a beef-burger , a French fries and a milk shake , please . 
 I'm not quite sure . What do you have ? 
 Very well , I'll try the banana flavor . 
 No , thanks . That will be all . 
 It's no problem . I have time today , and I think it's important that you find a good place . 
 So what do you see in there ? 
 Can you afford that much ? 
 Yes , an efficiency is a small apartment.Usually one large room and a small bathroom.There is often a small kitchen too . So it's good for one person . 
 That means the apartment has furniture in it . 
 Sometimes it's good , sometimes it's bad . You have to like the furniture . 
 It's still pretty expensive . 
 Alright . What's the phone number ? 
 Got it . What else do you see ? 
 No . It probably means they have a large apartment.Probably a living room , kitchen and three bedrooms.They need someone for the empty bedroom . 
 Yes , it might be an advantage for you . You are a foreigner , after all.If they're alright roommates , you could learn a lot from them . 
 Got it.Let ' s call these two and see if we can make appointments to see the apartments . 
 Don't mention it , Larry . What are friends for anyway ? 
 No , we don't . 
 Just two people . 
 We prefer non-smoking section . 
 How long a wait do you think there ’ ll be ? 
 Ok , we'll wait a while . 
 Thank you . 
 Well , I think I'd like to have a tomato sausage soup first . And the same for him , please . 
 One goblet of red wine and one bottle of beer please . 
 What special kind of desserts do you have ? 
 Well , I think we will order after we finish the main course . 
 Waiter ! May I see you for while ? 
 This is not what I asked for , I'm afraid . 
 Roast beef . 
 Roast beef , of course . That's what I ordered . 
 Hello , Jenny . What's the matter ? 
 No problem , Jenny . Are you sure five hundred is enough ? 
 Show me your passport and declaration please . 
 Do you have anything to declare ? 
 Let me have a look at the receipt . 
 What are the movies that are playing ? 
 I've never seen a movie I don't like that had Harrison Ford in it . 
 Yes . What time does it start and do you want to meet me there ? 
 Great ! I have a coupon for free popcorn at that theater ! 
 What's the problem ? 
 Really ? That's something unexpected . You see , all our exports were strictly inspected before shipment . The goods were in perfect condition when they left . 
 That could have happened in the course of transit or unloading , due to rough handling . 
 But there is nothing wrong with our packing . Our cartons are standard export ones and we also enforced them with straps . 
 I don't think the stevedores could have handled them with great care . 
 I would if I could . 
 Because I have other obligations . 
 Depending on what you consider a lot . 
 Couple times a week . How about you ? 
 How much can you drink ? 
 You're a light weight . 
 I'm usually drinking all night long . At least 10 drinks . 
 No . We usually go to places that have specials . Dante's over on the Ave has $ 5.00 pitchers on Mondays . So for ten , fifteen bucks , I can get a lot of drinks . 
 If you don't like beer , have you tried mixed drinks ? Some of them are pretty good . 
 You just have to build up a tolerance . I used to be like that . But your body gets used to it . 
 Hey let's go out tomorrow night . The Ram Bar and Grill is having a special on pitchers . 
 By the way , how many books am I allowed to check out ? 
 How long can I keep the books ? 
 Peter , which club do you want to join ? 
 I am a member of the basketball club . Do you want to join us ? 
 It's OK . Don't worry about it . Our school coach will train us to play basketball . 
 How can I help you ? 
 Let me take your temperature with a thermometer . 
 I think you have a small fever . 
 You should've called in sick ! Next time , have either of your parents call the school office . 
 That's a great idea . It's the best season for tourists in Florida . You can also get a good sun-tan there . 
 You can put on your shades . And remember don't make your skin look like a tomato . Or else after that your skin will begin to flake off . You may even wind up with skin cancer . 
 You said it . 
 For example ? 
 As I said , I am diligent and industrious . On the other hand , I am too hard-working and I put myself under much pressure to make things perfect . 
 I am too introverted to let others become my friends . 
 Yeah , she has a lot of homework . 
 Right . So in some way we are happier . 
 Are you getting overtime ? 
 Have you thought about another job ? 
 Both of the two young ladies are the candidates for the position 
 Right.The choice is yours , the tall one or the short one ? 
 Are we here yet ? 
 How far away is it ? 
 How many miles to go ? 
 Will we be there soon ? 
 Where's the hotel ? 
 I see that . That was a nice ride . 
 Happy Birthday , this is for you , Brian . 
 Brian , may I have a pleasure to have a dance with you ? 
 This is really wonderful party . 
 Thanks , that's very kind of you to say . I hope my necklace goes with my dress , and they both make me look good I feel . 
 Thanks , this is a fine party . We should have a drink together to celebrate your birthday 
 Again ? The area around the park is too dark at night . There should be more lights there . 
 Your feelings might be right . You should never walk alone there at night . It is too dangerous . 
 Hello . Is Bob there , please ? 
 Oh . This is Paul . When will he be back ? 
 Can I leave a message please ? 
 Please tell him I'll call him at the office tomorrow afternoon . 
 Thank you very much . 
 So fast ! Thank you . 
 Yes , you'd print out the address and telephone number of those guests from your computer , and then send those materials to each business worker . 
 By the way , to tell them try to persuade those new guests to cooperate with us . Because I found a biggest opponent from this post-trip . 
 OK , it's no anything . Do what you should do . 
 Yes , that is me . Nice to meet you , Monica . Welcome on board ! 
 Well , we have nicer things than that in this company . You will find out soon . 
 Well , I bet you will love them too . If you need help , just ask me any time . I am in the next door . You can also reach me through the extension 508 . 
 How may I help you ? 
 What happened to this one ? 
 You ’ re going to need to pay for the damage . 
 It ’ s going to be $ 5 . 
 It really isn ’ t . 
 Thank you very much . 
 How was your interview ? 
 What did you say ? 
 Did he want to know the reasons ? 
 That ’ s sex discrimination . When will you get the reply ? 
 Wish you good luck ! 
 Oh , you are out of breath ! What ’ s happened ? 
 That it easy.They get caught before they come here . 
 You say your products are aimed at the green consumer . In what ways are they environmentally-friendly ? 
 What about the packaging ? 
 Excuse me . I bought the CD here two days ago . It's scratched , and doesn't play properly . 
 The thing is I've replaced once already . I think it's just a faulty batch . 
 Well . To be honest , that's not much use to me . I'll leave the country tomorrow . I'd really prefer a refund . 
 I went to Super Junior's concert last night . It was fantastic . 
 Yes , their new album just came out last week . It is number one on the billboard . 
 The lyrics of the new song are beautiful , too . Can you sing ? 
 Let's go buy their new album . Want to come with me ? 
 Mr . Smith , I'm wondering whether you have found a way of considering my offer ? 
 You see . I made what I consider to be a reasonable offerbased upon the rise in production costs and the continued fall in the exchange rate of Australian Dollar to U . S . Dollar . 
 I understand . 
 I think the best way I can do is to reduce our price by 2 % and I should think we could conclude a deal at $ 98 . 
 Your legal department is very good at these things . We can trust them with the drafting of the agreement . 
 Very agreeable , Mr . Smith . It will only take me a minute to sign it and send it back to you . 
 I'm sorry , but I can't find the book you lent me . I guess I have lost it . 
 I really feel bad about it . Let me buy you a new one . 
 I ’ d like to send this parcel to Australia . 
 Sure . It ’ s not very heavy . 
 I see . What are the options ? I suppose airmail is faster and more expensive than surface mail . 
 How long will it take to get there ? 
 It that case , I ’ ll send it by airmail . I ’ d like to send it as a registered parcel . 
 Thanks very much . There ’ s thirteen dollars . 
 Would you like your bags to be taken to your room ? 
 OK . I'll get the bellman to taka them up . Which bags are yours ? 
 OK . 
 I'll let the bellboy know . Don't worry , he's very strong . 
 Of course . 
 I think it ’ s a distance of 180 kilometers from here to London , so it should be a two-hour drive on the motorway . 
 you ’ re right . We will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey , because we will be in built-up areas . 
 ok . You haven ’ t seen my company car , have you ? 
 I think it ’ s over five meters long . I can ’ t remember exactly . It has a maximum speed of over 200 kilometers an hour . 
 we can ’ t . if we went that fast , we would break the speed limit . 
 Are you crazy ? Tomorrow's Saturday . 
 Americans also don't go to work on Saturdays . 
 Right . What are you going to do tonight ? 
 On a Friday night ? 
 I'm going to the shops in a minute . What do we need ? 
 No problem . We also need bread , so I'll go to the baker's . I'll get some vol au vents for Victor's birthday bash on Friday . We'll need balloons for that too . 
 Okay . The library's beside the baker's . I'd better take back the videos we borrowed last week . They're overdue . 
 Bye ! I'll be back before seven . 
 Could you tell me what Ants on the Tree is please ? 
 Sounds nice . I'll have that please . 
 How do you do ? 
 I'm Mary Smith.Nice to meet you , too . 
 I've noticed you've been working overtime a lot . 
 Operator , I want to make a correct oversea phone call to Beijing . 
 Rachel Jason . 
 The code is 880 , the area code is 010 , and the local number is 8824578 4 
 Manicole Tan . 
 Ok , thank you . 
 I'm tired of this job . 
 Bang ? ! Bang ! Bang ! What are the Kings doing at seven o ’ clock on Sunday morning ? 
 Yes , but what ’ s the banging noise ? 
 And what ’ s Mrs . King doing ? 
 What ’ s happening ? 
 What ’ s Mr . King doing ? 
 And is she helping him ? 
 Well , I ’ m not going to answer it . I ’ m sleeping . 
 No , I had no interest in the activities in college and I spent most of my spare time reading in the library . 
 None , I guess . My only passion is on reading . 
 Have you tried university part-time jobs ? 
 I mean in the library , or in some information center.Often the university hires foreign students for part-time positions . 
 Well , since you're a foreign student , it's hard.That ' s because it's actually illegal for you to work in America . 
 Anyway , there must be some solution.You know there are many people working illegally in New York . 
 I have an idea . 
 Since you're Chinese , maybe you can find part-time work in Chinatown . 
 Well , why don't you go and look down there ? 
 It may be part-time work as a waitress or something.It would be illegal , but sometimes waitresses make a good salary . 
 I will ask my friends for you.Maybe someone knows a company that needs part-time people.That ' s another thing you should do . Ask all your friends to ask around for you.You might find something . 
 Would you make me a dust coat out of this serge ? 
 What's the charge ? 
 OK.thank you . 
 Sure , but let's get a pitcher this time We should be able to down it before they close . 
 It's all the way to the back . See that yellow door ? 
 You're back already . That sure was quick . 
 Well , the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer . Anyway . He said it was too close to closing time . 
 Okay , let's go ! 
 Yes , there must be about a hundred . Do you have a favorite ? 
 I know , fresh fruit flavored is the best ever . 
 I don't like peppermint ice cream . 
 One time , I tried garlic ice cream . 
 That doesn't sound like a good choice for today though . Let's order ! 
 Oh , darling , we must stand shoulder to shoulder and face the music . I know you can pull yourself together . 
 Cheer up . You have got me at least . 
 Come in please . 
 Well , since you have come , do it now please ? 
 Thank you.Please get some soap for us . 
 What is your name , please ? 
 How old are you ? 
 May I ask your birth date ? 
 Where do you live now ? 
 Then tell me your birthplace . 
 Ok , I know you are not a resident of Beijing . Where is your domicile place then ? 
 OK , I'm sorry it took so long . 
 The phone has been ringing off the hook today . 
 What did you do at the office today ? 
 What kind of things did you need to check ? 
 I see . Did anything else happen ? 
 It must be difficult to remember the details for each individual client . 
 I hate dealing with complaints . Was it a legitimate complaint ? 
 You certainly had a busy day . 
 Excuse me , could you spare me a few minutes ? 
 Do you know if train 10 is on time to be here ? 
 Do you mind if I read your newspaper for a while ? 
 Thanks a lot 
 Is this the Customer Service Desk ? 
 I bought a sweater from your store a week ago . It says size 12 . But actually , it is a size 10 . Can I exchange it ? 
 Yes , I do . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Thanks for your help . 
 I have some great news ! I was able to switch to the night shift ! 
 I got to meet the night Anger today too . We got along right from the start . 
 Not yet , I pick it up tomorrow . 
 Yes , I'll be managing the guys on the dock . 
 Do you have perfume ? 
 I would like some light smell . 
 Can I smell it ? 
 It's going to strike 12 o'clock . Let's get the firecrackers ready , Rose . 
 Well yes , but they are not allowed only in downtown areas . It's OK here . It would be difficult to ban customs that have thousands of years of tradition . The habit does bring kids joy and excitement so long as precautions are taken . Let's go out and set off firecrackers out there . 
 What other activities will you have tomorrow ? 
 Do you bring some gifts along ? 
 Is it the same practice for all families ? 
 I really appreciate the way you Chinese people exchange feelings . The holiday's long enough for you to relax . 
 Hi ! Does this hotel have an exercise facility ? 
 Good . Now exactly where is it ? 
 Is this going to cost me anything ? 
 When does the gym open and close ? 
 Very good . Now , is there a trainer down there ? 
 Hi , Jim ! When did you get back ? 
 I ’ m really jealous ! I won ’ t be able to get any time off for at least another three or four months . 
 Welcome aboard . 
 Let me have a look at your boarding pass . It's E - 6 , the sixth seat by the aisle . 
 This is Manager Liang's office , what can I do for you ? 
 OK ! I'll tell him . 
 Ok ! Thanks for calling . 
 Bye ! 
 I ’ m great . Thanks . 
 I need your help . 
 I need to find this newspaper article . 
 I forgot about that section . 
 Could you do that ? 
 Thank you for all your help . 
 I ’ m so happy about that . 
 I sure did . How about you ? 
 I have complete confidence in our new President . 
 I know he will help change America . 
 I feel like things are already changing , because he was elected . 
 I ’ m not worried about our country now that it ’ s in his hands . 
 Good morning , Mrs Smith . 
 Yes , thank you . 
 In the first academic year we learned Principles of Accounting , and in the following years we learned Cost Accounting , Commercial Accounting , Industrial Accounting , and Management Accounting . 
 No , we haven't taken such a course , but we have taken a more specialized course for decision making , by the name of Forecasting and Decision-Making . 
 I forgot to include my experience as an accountant in my resume . In fact , I took a part-time job as an accountant at the Atlantic Trading Company during my second and third school year . I worked three evenings a week there and I did quite well . Here is the recommendation . 
 No problem . The professional English course is just English for Accounting . Moreover , as you know , the Atlantic Trading Company is a Sino-Australian joint venture . When I served part-time there , I became well acquainted with accounting operated in English . 
 I have a relative working as a manager in your manufacturing department . Her name is Lilling . She told me a lot about your company and I became quite interested . I believe I can have a promising career with the development of this company . 
 No , can you tell me about it ? 
 I have passed the five courses required by the Chinese CPA Association , but the certificate won't come to hand until next month . How about that ? 
 Thank you , Mrs Smith . It is really a pleasure talking with you . 
 Thank you . Good-bye . 
 OK , please . 
 I would recommend the mall , it's about 20 minutes , drive to the south in a taxi . It has a wide range of shops and restaurants . 
 How old are your children ? 
 I would recommend a day at the zoo . It's fun for all the family . There is also a water park just outside the city if you would like a day trip . 
 Don't worry , your baby is in my home . 
 I wonder how Sarah and Mat are . 
 I'm not surprised . She's a plain Jane . 
 There are so many eating utensils on the table . Which ones do I use first ? 
 I see . A set for appetizers and another for the main course . 
 Oh yeah . The big napkin goes on my lap . 
 Cindy , help me order because I'm still not very familiar with American cooking . 
 I have just received your note which informs me that you have offered the accountant position to another candidate . May I ask why I was defeated ? 
 Experience is important , but don't you think capability is more valuable than that ? 
 Maybe you can hire me on trial . If I'm not qualified for the job , you can let me go . 
 Excuse me , sir , since my train leaves at 16:00 . Have you a 3 - hour tour ? 
 Well , I have just missed the place . How long does the tour take ? 
 I hope so . 
 Yeah . I like it , Dad . 
 Really ? 
 I want to buy one to match my shirt.Can you give me some advice ? 
 Yes , they seem to be my size and go with my shirt quite well . I will take it . 
 Yes , of course.Would you like to walk there or take a bus ? 
 It's just about ten minutes ' walk . Go along this street , on the third cross you'll find it on your left . 
 Not at all . 
 Oh , thank you . Your skirt looks beautiful , too . 
 Someone ought to clean it today . 
 No , he cleaned it last time . It's your turn . 
 Oh dear , is it really my turn ? In that case , I'll clean tomorrow . 
 Then I'll clean it the day after tomorrow . 
 Francis , you have done an outstanding work in the past six months . In view of your achievement , I trust you ’ re now indispensable part of our company and you deserve an officer director title . 
 This title does not only give you a raising pay-check , but also increase responsibilities . Congratulations , and hope the best for you .

 Let me take a look . This is for a 486 computer with modem . Who ’ s it going to ? 
 Get her on the phone , please . I need to clarify this . 
 Well , I wouldn't call them rules , but there are some things that I expect my daughter to do . 
 Setting the table and doing the dishes . 
 I also expect Cindy to tidy up her own room . 
 Yeah . She's a very responsible person . 
 Well , It ’ s not as crowded as we excepted , is it ? 
 Yes , Let ’ s . 
 That ’ s a good idea . 
 What ? Won't you have more drinks ? 
 Oh ! I'm sorry , but I wish you could stay . 
 Don't mention it . You can come whenever You are free . 
 I ’ m afraid you ’ re going in the opposite direction . 
 I think a cab is better . 
 Sure . What do you fancy ? 
 Sir , the filet mignon was so popular tonight that we ran out . May I suggest the porterhouse ? 
 Perhaps you would like chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ? 
 Okay . This will be charged to your amenities account , okay ? 
 Your food will be brought to you momentarily . I hope you enjoy it . 
 Why do you say that ? I think you're making a lot of progress . 
 Learning any language takes a lot of effort . But don't give up . Why don't we practise those dialogues together ? 
 The operation in the lab is radioactive and dangerous , so work with care . Have you got ear muffs and gloves ? 
 Yes , you have to . It is a safety rule of the company . You could not only lose your job but your hearing if you don't . 
 You want to go with him ? 
 Then you must be off your head . He is a real bastard . 
 It should be 3 
 That's right . Welcome to Great Britain . 
 John , I am just not in the mood for this . 
 I lost the table tennis game yesterday . 
 I just don ’ t want to play table tennis any more . 
 My opponent bowled me with the very first ball . I was wondering if it's appropriate for me to play table tennis . 
 Perhaps you are right . But I still need some time to recover from the failure . 
 What musical instrument do you play ? 
 Then we can have one more program at our party ? 
 Good morning , can I help you ? 
 Yes . of course . May I have your name and your room number , please ?

 Running a farm would be totally different to you current job . 
 You ’ d need a lot of training before becoming a farmer . It ’ s not something you can just walk into . 
 Well , I ‘ d certainly come and visit you . It would be great to take a working holiday on a farm . I ’ d love to get away from hustle and bustle of the city for a while .
