 You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness . 
 Do you really think so ? I don't . It will just make us fat and act silly . Remember last time ? 
 I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends . 
 Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us.That is excellent exercise and fun , too . 
 All right . 
 Of course I can . It's a piece of cake ! Believe it or not , I can do 30 push-ups a minute . 
 You mean 30 push-ups ? 
 It's easy . If you do exercise everyday , you can make it , too . 
 No , I listen to background music . 
 The radio has too many comerials . 
 Are you all right ? 
 Don't worry.He is an acrobat 。 
 Hey John , nice skates . Are they new ? 
 What position do you play ? 
 Yeah , you ’ re a pretty big guy . I play goalie , myself . 
 The Rockets . 
 All right , see you later . 
 I ’ m looking at my horoscope for this month ! My outlook is very positive . It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic , and that I will have a passionate summer fling ! 
 It ’ s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ’ m an Aries . When were you born ? 
 Let ’ s see . . . you ’ re a Capricorn . It says that you will be feeling stress at work , but you could see new , exciting developments in your love life . Looks like we ’ ll both have interesting summers ! 
 No , it ’ s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . See ? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize . 
 A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical . She likes to do things in conventional ways . That sounds just like you ! 
 Is he really ? 
 Who is he marring ? 
 Have they set a date for the wedding ? 
 I hear you bought a new house in the northern suburbs . 
 What kind of house is it ? 
 Oh , I love the roof tiles on Spanish style houses . 
 Great , is it a two bedroom house ? 
 That ’ s a nice area too . It ’ ll be a good investment for you . 
 Not untill the end of this year , you know , just before my wedding . 
 Thank you . 
 Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall . 
 She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she's around . 
 Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her . 
 It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids . 
 You said she used to ? How did you stop her ? 
 That sounds like a good idea . I'll have to try that . 
 I hate to admit it , but they're good . And fast . The Filipino kid is a genius . 
 It'll be close , but we'll make it . 
 And if we don't need them , we won't need Zina , either . 
 Yes . I like cooking very much . I got this hobby when I was 12 years sold . 
 I have no idea . I like cooking by myself . I like to taste delicious food . 
 And I love trying new recipes , which I usually test with my friends . You can come , too . 
 Certainly . 
 I'm in the kitchen ... let yourself in ! 
 I know . I've even worked up a sweat . 
 You look so tan and healthy ! 
 How was it ? 
 Like what ? 
 I ’ m so jealous . 
 Diana , do you like the perfume I gave you ? 
 I ’ m sorry . I didn ’ t know that . 
 Ah , ah , ah ... 
 Jog ? 
 Walk ? 
 Oh no . 
 Oh , dear . 
 Oh no . 
 Dance class ! I don't know how . 
 Oh ... 
 Oh where was that ? 
 Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy.She is always making us kids eat the proper foods . 
 She will be 86 next month . 
 I would like to register for a class today . 
 I would very much enjoy taking a Psychology class.Because I'm crazy . 
 Which days are these classes on ? 
 What about the other class ? 
 Are you sure there are no more open classes ? 
 Sign me up for Monday and Wednesday . 
 Dad , why are you taping the windows ? 
 Really ? Wow , I don't have to go to school tomorrow . 
 OK . Dad ! I'm coming . 
 Nice to meet you , Lean . My name is Alike . I'm from Japan . 
 A second language is always difficult . 
 A crazy language ? Why do you say that ? 
 No wonder you say English is a crazy language . 
 I hope so . I'm looking for some material for a paper I'm writing , and I'm not quite sure where to look . 
 My paper is on the influence of television on children . 
 Thank you for you help . 
 Yeah , Cal Ripen just hit a home run . 
 Well it was 3 to 4 , but Ripen ’ s home run made it 5 to 4 since another player was on first base . 
 Right . 
 Yeah , there isn ’ t a bad seat in the place . 
 It was a great idea to spend a day watching a game . 
 How do you like the pizza here ? 
 Do you have a light ? 
 I was scared stiff of giving my first performance . 
 Thank you for your kindly words . 
 Sure . Which button do I press to shoot ? 
 Do I have to focus it ? 
 All right . Say cheese ! 
 Yeah , we don ’ t live in the vacuum . We have traditional values and long but different history . 
 But there is always somebody who wants to turn his back on the true history . 
 Do you like traveling , Kathy ? 
 Or getting stuck in traffic jams when you ’ re driving . 
 Your house is too small . Why not buy a big one . 
 You can get a loan from the bank . You know LPF program provides low cost loans for participants home purchases . 
 How do you do , Prof.Smith . 
 Thank you . I begin to like English even when I was a child . 
 At school , in China.This is my first time to be out of my own country . 
 Do you want black or white coffee ? 
 Look ! there's a Folk concert tomorrow evening . Do you Want to go ? 
 What kind of music do you like ? 
 Not very much . Classical music sends me to sleep 
 It ’ s true . 
 So are you ! How about another coffee ? 
 I like playing chess . 
 I'm afraid not . 
 Oh , yes . I like playing basketball . 
 Because I like the feeling of cooperating with others . 
 Haven't you heard that he is in prison ? 
 John is in prison now . He was copped outstealing . 
 Can I help you ? 
 I'll certainly try to help you.What topic is your paper on ? 
 There are several possible sources you might use for that topic . I suggest you use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television . 
 Hey , Ted . What are you up to this Friday ? 
 That ’ s great ! Do you have any plans ? 
 Sounds nice . 
 Can I stop by ? 
 You honestly believe the world ’ s improving every year ? 
 I don ’ t think you ’ re right there . 
 I don ’ t believe that . 
 I agree with you in the sense . But we ’ re all more miserable than ever , aren ’ t we ? 
 That ’ s your opinion not mine . 
 I want to have a picnic with my friends , Mum . 
 OK , Mum . I'll invite my friends home . 
 I would like to return this book . 
 I also want to check out this video . 
 That ’ s all I need . 
 Here it is . 
 That won ’ t be a problem . 
 I won ’ t damage it . 
 It's us . 
 Well , you always say you're busy . 
 And you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself . 
 Oh I remember , I cut terrible calls , and you didn't say anything about it . 
 Totally not . Perhaps it's about our marriage . 
 I think I've caught a cold . Now I'm aching all over . 
 Thank you . I suppose I should go to see a doctor . 
 Great idea ! Peter , I could use the drink . 
 Sounds good . The food there is fantastic , too . 
 excellent ! That sounds like a plan . 
 Well . My watch says five past two . But it ’ s no use rely on it because it has been gaining and losing these last a few days . 
 Yes . I will . 
 sure . My mom has been working on our family tree for years . She ’ s always updating it . 
 I can show it to you now , if you like . I think it goes back about 8 generations so far . 
 I ’ Ve got 30 cousins on my mom ’ s side and 10 cousins on my dad ’ s side . 
 the ones that are my age are close relatives . Now that I ’ m older , I don ’ t spend as much time with them as I used to , so I don ’ t know my younger cousins as well as the older ones . 
 it ’ s definitely my mother . And , her mother is definitely the matriarch of the bigger family . 
 at first , she was quite critical of her , but now that they ’ Ve been married for a few years , she ’ s starting to accept the fact that my father divorced my mother . 
 Hi , Mr . Wang . Do you feel like going boating with me ? 
 How about tomorrow afternoon ? 
 At the gate of the park . 
 See you then . 
 I hear that you've been to the Saikei Ski Resort for the weekend . Did you enjoy it ? 
 Isn't there any coach to teach you how to ski ? 
 Could you move smoothly ? 
 What happened afterwards ? 
 Poor girl ! 
 Yeah . I have got much pressure in the company . I have tobe wrapped upon my work . 
 Thank you . I will . 
 About David ? No , I didn ’ t hear anything . 
 Sorry , I don ’ t quite follow you . 
 Oh , that is a shame . He is really hard working . 
 I usually ride my bike . Which form of transport do you prefer to use ? 
 I think we should discourage people from using their private cars . They produce too much pollution ! 
 cars might be convenient , but they're so bad for the environment . 
 no . I used to have one though . Once I started using my bicycle to get around , I found that I didn't really need it . 
 you could try . It would save you a lot of money . 
 if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving , you will get lots of exercise , too ! 
 let's go to a car dealership . I'll help you try to sell your car for a good price . 
 What's wrong with him ? 
 What are you going to do for one year abroad , Tom ? 
 You are going to take courses ? 
 Sounds hard . 
 Won ’ t you get lonely ? 
 Isn't this lovely weather ? Will you help me water the flowers , Jack ? 
 I do.We haven't watered them for quite a few days . 
 Good.So we don't have to work.How nice ! 
 Why ? 
 Oh , I'm afraid all the flowers will die in the rain . 
 Yeah , this one closes at ten . We could drive to the 24 - hour store on sixth . 
 I wish the store close to us was open 24 - house a day . 
 Yeah , and the prices there are very high . 
 Do you think they two will get married ? 
 I think so.Yes , they get along so well . 
 You're right . He sure is . 
 First we will go to the city centre and stop for something to drink . Then we will visit the University Museum . 
 There is a coffee shop round the corner . Can you see that big building at the end of the road ? 
 That is a bank . The coffee shop is opposite the bank . 
 A stop ! Wait for the lights to turn green . 
 Sorry . How far is the museum ? 
 Here we are . You find us a table and I'll get the drinks . 
 That's great . What's on tonight ? 
 Romantic ? I am afraid I like thrillers better . 
 On the contrary , very exciting . 
 Are you sick ? 
 He ’ ll finish writing in a minute . 
 Really ? Are you sure ? 
 Yeah but , it is something that you will have forever ! They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . On top of all that , I have heard it hurts a lot ! 
 Of course ! They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink . 
 I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . Also , find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles , and that the place is hygienic . 
 Excuse me , what's the screen near your steering wheel for ? 
 Oh , that's new to me . So what's on everyday ? 
 Is there anything interesting ? 
 I agree . Are there any commercials on the TV ? 
 That makes a lot of sense . Does the TV work well ? 
 I got it . Do you pay for the programs ? 
 Oh , no ! 
 Look at the view from the window . 
 It ’ s awful , isn ’ t it ? 
 It can ’ t be helped . 
 Well , I like playing the violin . 
 About ten years so far . I started learning when I was in middle school . 
 Sure . So what about you ? Do you have any hobbies ? 
 Of course it does . Everybody has his own hobby . 
 Don't worry , you'll find a way . 
 How can you live without job in the future ? 
 What sports do you like to play ? 
 How about football ? 
 It's a very popular game in America . 
 For me , it's one of those games that are fun to both watch and play . 
 No , I just for fun with my friends . We play two hand touch or flag football . We're too old to play tackle football . 
 Instead of tackling somebody , you just have to touch them with two hands , or if it is flag football , grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing . 
 Exactly . We play every Saturdays on the field by the tennis courts . If you want to learn and play a little , you're welcome to join us . 
 Ok . I'll call you Saturday morning . 
 What upsets you ? 
 It is not your mother finding one for you ? 
 Perhaps you can try the three minutes date , the latest type . 
 No , there is an updated virgin , three minutes video date . I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes . 
 I think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone , so-called love at first sight . 
 Don ’ t worry . There are many other options using the internet as dating methods . Some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications . Of course , for these sites , you have to pay a membership fee . But all in all , it is more serious and professional . The chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher . 
 Are you going to the party on Saturday ? 
 Yeah , I heard it's going to be a lot of fun . 
 It starts at 8 
 Everyone from school . 
 This party is going to have a DJ , food , and drinks . 
 So am I going to see you at the party ? 
 Could you talk to me for a few minutes about my grades ? 
 Am I failing ? 
 I am pretty sure that I am in trouble . 
 I missed a few classes ; I need to make sure I come to school on a regular basis . 
 I'll try ; it's hard ! 
 Good luck on your test tomorrow . We'll be crossing our fingers for you ! 
 I'll never ever work together with him ! 
 Will you take my materials back from him for me ? Please ! 
 Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! 
 It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! 
 There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . 
 So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . 
 Yes . 
 I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . 
 Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . 
 He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . 
 C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . 
 You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? 
 I'm afraid it gains a little . 
 Two . 
 Just so so . Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time , so we decided to meet again tonight . 
 Well , I didn't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found him extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! And we have so much in common . We like the same team , music , and most amazingly , we both love Chinese food ! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends . 
 There's nothing definite I think . I don't have a list or anything , but when I first meet somebody , I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . It seems I have radar helping me spot new friends . 
 I agree . You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need . 
 What ’ s up ? You don ’ t look too good . 
 I liked physics . It ’ s all math , really . arcs , curves , velocity , cool stuff . 
 A physics class about the creation of the universe ? That ’ s some pretty unscientific language there . Sounds more religious to me . 
 Turtles ? Whatever ... Look , all that ’ s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles . At least , that ’ s what the math says . 
 There is evidence ! You know Edwin Hubble ? He ’ s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . What would it be expanding from ? Well , the Big Bang ... DUH ! 
 Dude , don ’ t equivocate . A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing . You slept through class , didn ’ t you ? 
 I think lifelong learning is the concept that it's never too soon or too late for learning 
 I don't think so . I think it's about your attitude towards learning . One should be open to new ideas , decisions , skills or behaviors . 
 You're right . Lifelong learning is about finding learning opportunities at all ages and in numerous contexts 
 Me too . To keep up with the changing world , one must be involved in lifelong learning and be ready to accept new things . 
 Really ? That's great ! I know that your company has a lot of clients in France . 
 How old are you ? 
 I'm older than you ! I'll be ten on April 14th . 
 Maybe . I'll have to ask my mother . 
 Hi honey ! What ’ s wrong ? Why do you have that look on your face ? 
 No ! I said I was going to cut down which is very different . You can ’ t just expect me to go cold turkey overnight ! 
 I know , I know . I am trying but , I don ’ t have the willpower to just quit . I can ’ t fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch ! Please understand ? 
 Why are you shivering ? 
 It seems that you get antsy when you hear I praise another guy . 
 How come you think of him that way ? 
 I have no reason to distrust him . He's never caused any harm . 
 Nothing smells a rat . I told you that he's an all-right guy . 
 Cheese ! It tastes like cardboard . 
 Have you signed up to join the company ’ s Christmas party ? 
 I will . You know , as a newcomer , I think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere . 
 I hope that it is not a formal one when the boss is there . 
 Don ’ t worry , I can handle that . And I know if the boss is there , even it is an informal evening , it does not make a good impression to get totally drunk in front of him . 
 I hope not . Then we'd have to reschedule our baseball game . 
 The tall one ? Sure , that's Drive , he works with Lily . 
 I'm not sure , he is a manager I think . 
 Well , he has already taken you know , that's his wife right there . 
 I'm sorry to have made you disappointed . 
 Was I ? Sorry , I didn ’ t mean to be . I do apologize . 
 Forgive me darling . I'm very tired . 
 Yes , I did . But I feel tired today . 
 Well , on Saturday I cleaned the house and played tennis . Then on Sunday I hiked in the country . 
 Yeah . I studied on Sunday evening . What about you ? 
 That sounds like fun , but did you exercise ? 
 There will be a parade to celebrate National Day this weekend . 
 From Zhongshan Circus to City Bank . 
 Excuse me . I'm afraid you're in my seat . You've moved my books . 
 You must have realized somebody was here . 
 What ’ s the life expectancy in your country ? 
 About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It ’ s a problem that will soon affect most of the world . 
 Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday . 
 How ’ s your son these days ? 
 He ’ ll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you mine it is a good age to have a child ? 
 Yes , I think you ’ re right . I ’ m thinking about having a child , but not just yet . 
 Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life . Parents usually try to discourage them , but they don ’ t often succeed . 
 It ’ s almost impossible to get the right balance . If you are too strict , kids might ignore you . If you are too lenient , they might go wild . 
 Have you ever been to America ? 
 You'd like it . 
 Julie ! It's good to see you again . How have you been ? 
 Really ? How was it ? 
 I hear the beaches in Thailand are beautiful . 
 I do like Thai food . Did you see much of Bangkok ? 
 I know what you mean . I could use a vacation myself . 
 Yeah , it sure would . 
 Yes , I ’ m the manager here . What can I do for you , Madam ? 
 Which room are you in ? 
 I ’ m awfully sorry to hear that . I ’ ll turn to it right away . 
 Isn't it just great ! I just knew I'd win ! 
 Not only that ! 
 OK , OK . I'll whisper it to you , but you have to promise not to tell anyone ! 
 We are going to the concert this evening . Will you join us . 
 Why not ? 
 You'v been work here for nearly a month , how do you feel about the job ? 
 I had the same feeling when I first came to work here . but after a period of time , I feel better , I am sure you ' ll get used to this busy job . 
 You know the phrase , the survival the fittest . We have no choices . 
 The music is on.May I have the pleasure to dance with you ? 
 Certainly . 
 No , please feel free . 
 Do you work in Shanghai ? 
 No , I'm a tourist . This place is amazing ! It's much bigger than I imagined , and much more exciting ! There's so much to see here . 
 Um , well let's see ... I'm from Kansas originally . A much quieter and more peaceful place than here , that's for sure ! 
 Look at this headline , Soo Mi . 
 Is it the same in Korea ? 
 Do people get married young ? 
 Hmm . Do women usually work after they get married ? 
 Boy ! What a beauty ! I fall in love with her at the first sight . 
 Of course.No girl is more charming . 
 Excuse me.Where do I register ? 
 Is that the large , white building ? 
 Thanks . 
 I'm going to graduate this summer . 
 I'm planning to return to China after graduation . 
 Well , I think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment . 
 Do you have any particular hobbies , Tom ? 
 I hear many teenagers will spend hours and hours sitting at computers . And they don't care about their own health at all . How about you ? 
 You won't play online games full of violence , will you ? 
 It's no good . And I think spending several hours each day playing computer games is a waste of time . You might as well do something healthy and meaningful . 
 What ’ s the plot of your new movie ? 
 Did you enjoy making the movie ? We heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director . 
 Critics are not very happy with the movies that you ’ Ve made recently . Does that bother you ? 
 Did you do you own stunts in the movie ? 
 Thank you very much for doing this interview . 
 Yes . I have . I liked it very much . Like you , I was very impressed with Rachel ’ s performance in the movie . She ’ s going to be a star . 
 She's my grandma . 
 92 . 
 Hold on . We will be successful right away . 
 I love stir fry crispy bitesize vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce . Wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts . Throw in some onion and garlic and ginger ! Mmm ! Mmm ! It ’ s almost lunchtime . I would die for a plate of stir fry right now ! 
 What ? You call that a stir fry ? More meat than vegetables ? That ’ s the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir fry . What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in ! What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap ! 
 I said it's a lovely day . Why don't we go for a walk ? 
 Come on ! A little labor , much health . 
 Don't take too long . It would be a shame not to take advantage of such lovely weather . 
 I Believe I will . Look for me near the lake . 
 Don ’ t worry about it , I ’ ll call my friend and have him take care of it . I can ’ t believe he was stalking you all these years . What a nut job ! 
 Don ’ t apologize ! From the moment I met you , not a day has gone by when I haven ’ t thought of you.And now that I ’ m with you again , I ’ m ... I ’ m just scared , Veronica . The closer I get to you , the worse it gets . The thought of not being with you , I mean , I just can ’ t handle it ! We were made for each other , Veronica . You are my everything , my soul mate . What can I do ? 
 I ’ m so happy to hear that ! I knew we belong together . I love you so much . 
 As long as it doesn't take too long . 
 Was he upset when you told him you had to leave this weekend ? 
 So what's the problem ? 
 it's ok . It seems we have a lot in common . 
 he is tall and slim , fair-haired . 
 he is a nice guy and very considerate . I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor . 
 he didn't say , but he said he would call me . 
 oh , steve . Stop it ! I am a bit nervous ! What if he doesn't call ? 
 thank you , Steve . You're always so encouraging . 
 Hi , Francis , how was your business trip ? 
 What ’ s up ? 
 Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ? 
 This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ? 
 Take it easy , all sufferings have their reward . 
 Yes , The SARS epidemic is not under effective control yet . So I'd better not risk it . 
 You are right . Maybe we should work out a fitness plan and start to do more exercise . Sitting around in the office all day is no way of keeping fit . 
 Which pair of jeans do you like best ? 
 But they aren't very fashionable . What about these ? 
 That's the style ! You just wear boxers . 
 You're so old fashioned ! Nobody is going to pull down your pants ! 
 Hi , Charles . What's the matter ? 
 Do you have a ride home ? 
 That's good . Do you live near here ? 
 I live downtown , with my parents . 
 I don't need a car . I walk to work . 
 Happy anniversary , sweetheart ! 
 I'll drink to that . Thanks for making this a night worth remembering . 
 That's good to know . Oh , listen ! The band's playing our song . 
 Always . 
 I want to have a picnic with my friends , Mum . 
 OK , Mum . I'll invite my friends home . 
 No.thanks . I'm full . 
 I'd love to . 
 That's OK with me . 
 Oh , uh ... Thanks . Henry , do you have a light ? 
 Thanks . Lovely day . Pity I ’ m on duty . 
 Oh , no . I couldn ’ t possibly . 
 Hi Jack , I'm working on these documents . The manager wants them for half an hour . 
 Is there something any need ? 
 Yes , I have nothing to do . 
 I beg your pardon ? 
 Really ? well , ok , you're welcome . 
 Hmm , how about seven ? I can treat you to dinner . 
 OK . Then I'll be expecting you . 
 How do you shoot pool ? 
 And ? 
 How do you know whether you should hit the solid or the striped one ? 
 Can I get the black ball in ? 
 Let's go and try now ! 
 I'd enjoy that . 
 OK . I'll see you then . 
 Me , too , I can ’ t stop scratching . They are everywhere ! Sneaky little jerks . 
 No , I forgot to buy some . 
 We can cover ourselves with beer ! That way if they bite us , they ’ ll get drunk and fall asleep . 
 Run ! They are thirsty for more ! 
 I've tried , but I can't stand the bald man talking so loudly in the program . 
 Don't be so irritable . I just don't understand the program , that's all . 
 Ok . I will wait until you have had your fun , if that's what you want . 
 Okay , can I ask you something direct ? 
 Fair enough . Give it to me straight . Did she bully you into this ? 
 I tell ya , when I got the invite , it really threw me for a loop . You've done a complete 180 . 
 I guess so . 
 It seems quite normal to me . It is pretty much what I want to do . 
 It is different now . The world is becoming colorful . Some of my friends don't feel the same pressure to marry . We all want to wait for the right moment . 
 Let the universe find us instead of forcing love . We prefer natural love . The most important thing is to be happy . Love will find us later . That is what we say . 
 Yes , of course.It was nice to see you . 
 Excuse me . Is this seat taken ? 
 What do you think of the coming match ? 
 You are bragging again . 
 Well , the state will benefit a lot , I suppose . 
 Ah , it ’ s hard to say . 
 of course . Is the dinner still on ? 
 we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice . 
 it can't be that bad . 
 really ? I never would have guessed . The criminals must only come out in the evenings , because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime . 
 ok , we will . How do you get around in the evenings ? 
 has anything else happened to you ? 
 well , we'll be careful . Thanks for letting me know . 
 Why doesn't he ask her ? 
 He's a chicken guy . 
 Yeah . Li Na's mother has been building a fire under her since her neighbour's daughter got married with a Canadian . She's almost driving Li Na crazy . 
 She is as meek as a lamb . She never goes against anyone or anything . She's as good as gold , you know ? 
 Haven't you heard that he is in prison ? 
 John is in prison now.He was copped outstealing . 
 What do you need ? 
 You have your library card , right ? 
 There is a wait right now to use the computers . 
 Would you please write your name on this list ? 
 I will call you when a computer is free . 
 Use the number on the back of your library card . 
 What a nice tie you are wearing ! 
 Certainly.It matches your suit perfectly . 
 Yes.You look very smart today . 
 What do you make of the case ? 
 What do you mean by saying so ? 
 Oh , yeah ? 
 Happy Mother's Day , Mom ! 
 Of course I should have ! You certainly deserve them ! You put up with all of us . 
 I have a real problem when I meet people . 
 I never know when to shake hands and when not to . Can you tell me something about it ? 
 Oh yes . Men , women , and children shake hands all the time . 
 But some women do shake hands . And now a lot of children have such good manners , they shake hands too . 
 That sounds easy enough . 
 Sam , I am so sorry . It was your birthday yesterday and I completely forgot about it . 
 Margaret really told me off when she found out that I had forgotten all about it . We did try to phone you , but you and Jane must have gone out . 
 Oh , yes , I know the one . How was the food ? 
 Oh , no . 
 I would think this was the least they could do . 
 Great . I have also been thinking of getting one . Do you think you could ask Jane to have a quiet word with Margaret ? My birthday is not that far away . 
 Here's the restaurant we're meeting the Smiths at . 
 After you . 
 I usually go in my free time on the weekends . How about you ? 
 That's true . And sometimes the tickets are cheaper during the week as well . 
 I will be hanged if I lying . 
 My car run out of petrol . 
 He had a lot of nerve telling us our ads sucked . 
 When did you start worrying about your weight ? 
 No , Jess , chill out ! 
 We can ’ t break into the line . Don ’ t be so impatient . We ’ ll be at the front of the line soon . 
 Oh no , Ari . I didn ’ t mean for you to pay for me when I invited you to go tonight . Let ’ s go Dutch . I ’ ll pay my own way . I insist . 
 Me , too . It will be great to see something light and funny for a change . I ’ m tired of heavy drama . 
 They ’ re fine , but I can ’ t watch a movie without popcorn . 
 I buy a computer magazine every month . It keeps me up-to date with all the latest developments . 
 Sometimes it takes too long to find the exact information you are looking for . Besides , I like to read a magazine in a coffee bar sometimes . 
 Yes , they do . But you can only access all the articles if you have a subscription . 
 Yes , I do . The magazine arrives by post at the beginning of each month . Do you every buy magazines ? 
 Mumm . Those burgers smell great . It's perfect day for a barbecue . 
 Oh , hi ! I'm Barbara Johnson . Nice to meet you . 
 Barbara . But please , just call me Barb . 
 I'm studying medicine . 
 At Harvard . What about you ? 
 Oh , are you ? That sounds interesting . 
 Good . I'm starving . 
 What are you so excited about ? 
 What's the big deal ? It's just a picture of some woman . 
 There are tons of other paintings that I think are better . 
 No , how much is it worth ? 
 Whoa . 
 part-timer ? Is that a new buzzword ? 
 sure , I have a part-time job as a bartender . 
 yeah , but I ’ m not there for fun . I have to remain professional and if I get distracted , the manager would be pretty upset . 
 of course . There ’ s always much to learn . I got to know more about the real world . 
 not just working experience . I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life . 
 sometimes it is . But after working for a few weeks , it ’ s easy to figure out . 
 maybe you can come to the bar one day and I ’ ll show you around . 
 Have you seen that house ? 
 You're right . I love it very much . 
 At least more than 100 years old . 
 I can't open the door . 
 Let me ask the old woman in that reception office . 
 She must be deaf . 
 Frightened ? You must be joking . 
 Yes . I'm fond of playing the chess and I'm very keen on playing cards . 
 Both , but the rules of playing cards vary in different places . 
 I went to the beach with my friends and had a barbecue there . 
 Sure . I think it ’ s a fantastic place to go . 
 It sure is . 
 You'd better prepare for the examination . 
 You should change your attitude , or you will not pass the course . 
 It is high time you have a talk with him . That may help clear the mists . 
 If I were you , I would put the whole matter on the table . 
 What is the correct time , please ? 
 When will the lecture begin ? 
 Should I ask Sara to the party ? 
 If he promised to help you , I'm sure he will help . He's a man of his word . 
 Last year he helped me out of trouble , too . 
 What is a sixties party ? 
 That sounds like fun . But where can I get clothes that old ? 
 Good idea . Can I bring some music from that period too ? 
 Don't tell me you have a record player ! 
 Oh , come on . You know it's a long process , you have to be patient . 
 A , whatever you do , the most important is perseverance . So you have to hang on there , the longer , the better . Then some day , you will find you've already made a lot of progress . 
 Yeah ! Where there is a will , there is a way . 
 My first grandchild . 
 Do you think so ? Well , I guess . He does look a lot like me . Oh , he ’ s got Richard ’ s eyes though . 
 Well , children usually resemble their parents . 
 You often like comparing children with their parents . 
 The music has started . 
 It's very nice . 
 Certainly . 
 Thanks . I'm glad you say so . Oh , the music has stopped . 
 Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English . 
 Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said . 
 Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss Parker says that my pronunciation is very good . 
 Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them . 
 What is it ? What happened ? 
 No , it can't be . Really ? Who ? 
 What did you do ? 
 Did he leave when you left ? 
 What did you do ? 
 That's about five blocks . And around corners too.So he was definitely following you . 
 Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . 
 Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything . 
 Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police.But for now , just try not to worry . 
 Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ? 
 I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays . 
 Come on , Han Maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion . 
 Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world . 
 That ’ s a little complicated . You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion . 
 Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England . 
 Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans . 
 That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries . 
 Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College . 
 Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well . 
 Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name . 
 In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman . 
 Therefore , it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard . 
 Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S . 
 Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related . 
 You can ask me any question at any time . 
 Sorry , I really can't do that . There's little time left for us . 
 But I have an appointment with Ann . 
 What do you do in summer ? 
 I don ’ t often go for walks , but I either play sports outside-you know , tennis or badminton-or just sit in the sunshine and read a good book . 
 Well , I play sports indoors quite often . If I ’ m feeling lazy , I just watch a film at home . I prefer summer to winter . 
 Yes . I like wearing shorts in summer . My legs would freeze ! 
 Thanks to global warming , it could be hotter than ever ! 
 I think you ’ ll lay it to rest with the time flying . 
 But I think time can change everything . 
 Pardon ? 
 University ? Why ? You asked me last year . 
 I went to Harvard University . 
 God save me ! Is there anything wrong with you ? Didn't I tell you ? 
 I did a B . A . in economics.Remember ? 
 I've been chosen to plan the next family reunion . 
 Yep . And I should start planning now . 
 Just about . There are at least a few hundred in our immediate family alone . 
 Usually it's at least five days and four nights . 
 Hi , my name is Lean , and I'm from Russia . 
 To me English is a difficult language . 
 True , but English is harder than most.It ' s a crazy language . 
 One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings . 
 What did you think of the film ? 
 Yes , I liked it , too . Did you like the acting ? 
 Not really . I thought it was disappointing . 
 Do you think so ? I don't like it very much . I found it rather uncomfortable . 
 Yeah , my head hurts , that ’ s all . I ’ Ve been in physics class all day . It ’ s killer ! 
 Yeah , yeah , but today ’ s lesson was all about the creation of the universe . 
 It ’ s all religion . Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion ? That ’ s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff . 
 Math , sheath . What ’ s the evidence ? 
 Anyway , it ’ s just a theory . Why do people go around touting theories ? Where ’ s the scientific rigor in that ? 
 Which film shall we see ? 
 Yes , I'd love to.Here is a good one , Mozart and Beethoven.It ' s on the Festival Hall.Shall we go there ? 
 No , I'm not hungry . 
 Everyone wants to be financial lose kill . You must invest your savings if you planed to retire rich . I ’ m thinking about buying stocks . It can be a good investment if I can manage well . What do you say ? 
 Wow , you sound very professional . 
 Can I borrow your suit ? 
 Bill , how can you hear so happy today ? 
 Really ? What was the matter ? 
 Brain Locker ? No , I don't think so . What does he look like ? 
 Mm . I've seen him a couple of times , I think . 
 I'm from Guangzhou . 
 It's in the South of China . 
 In that case , I won ’ t keep you any longer . Drop in anytime . 
 See you later . 
 Mine was ok , except that no one in my class speaks English . I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester . 
 That ’ s quite the array of nationalities . Everyone in my class is from Asia , except me . There are a few South Koreans , several Japanese , Malaysian , Thai , Singaporean , Filipino , Kazakhstan , and o 
 I guess so , but I think it ’ s going to be hard to relate to my classmates , especially with the language barrier . I think I might change classes . 
 I highly doubt it . Your girlfriend is Chinese . 
 Hey , I'm hungry . How about you ? 
 That's a great idea . Let's go to a Chinese restaurant . 
 Good morning , Miss Li . 
 I ’ m sorry that I was absent yesterday . 
 I feel much better now . 
 I ’ Ve already got it . Thanks . 
 I will . 
 Of course , I like . 
 Forsythia . It's also called winter jasmine which is the symbol of the spring's arrival . 
 Yes . How about you ? 
 You have a perfect taste ! 
 But it used to be ignored by many people . 
 Well , it's snowing . Let's enjoy the plum blossoms when snowing . 
 It stops snowing , but there's a bit wind . 
 I missed today's weather for cast in the radio 
 The ice is soon be thick for skating . I'm so fine to want a sport 
 What kind of music do you like listening to ? 
 Yes , I do . I find it very relaxing . I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work . 
 Classical music is supposed to be good for you brain . Research suggest that it makes your brain more active . Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better . 
 Yes . That ’ s why I listen to it in the evenings . I usually play it as background music while I ’ m cooking or doing other housework . 
 You can find plenty of recording on the internet too . You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them . 
 That ’ s true . There ’ s clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people . Music can influence a person ’ s feeling and character . 
 I hope that they have a good menu . Most coffee shops only have coffee and Danish . 
 No , so it's usually boring to join my friends in the afternoon at a regular coffee shop . 
 Maybe a fruit salad and a few different hot sandwiches at least . 
 Let's try it ! 
 Really ? I thought his wife couldn ’ t have a baby . 
 Oh , what a coincidence ! I bet Bobby must be very happy about it . He likes children and always wants a child of his own . 
 Oh , right . Now I know why they would want to see our boy . It ’ s hard to imagine the wonder ! Are they expecting a boy or a girl ? 
 Oh ! You mean she doesn ’ t have to work now ? It ’ s hard for young parents not to overreact , isn ’ t it ? 
 Do you have to pay to join ? 
 Wow , that much ? Don't they have any public courses ? 
 How was your game today ? 
 Congratulations ! What's your normal handicap ? 
 My drives were terrible today . I kept slicing the ball into the roughs and sand traps . 
 The concert was really great . 
 The singing group used to be very popular . 
 I have tickets to The Phantom of the Opera on Friday night . Would you like to go ? 
 It's at 8: 00 . 
 Uh , I'd like to , but I have to work late . 
 That sounds fine . 
 No , it's the Japanese team . 
 Well , their team work is well worth learning . 
 Of course , but we aren't going out , we're just friends . 
 Do you want me to put in a good word for you ? 
 I know only too well what that's like . 
 I was very sad when I was laid off last year . 
 Hi , Jenny . It's David here . 
 Not much . My girlfriend just dumped me . 
 Well , she told me things just weren ’ t working out and we weren ’ t right together . But I thought things were just great . Why did she say this ? It's completely out of the blue . 
 What ? She was cheating on me with that ugly guy . Oh , no , I feel like such a loser . 
 But she lied to me . 
 Ok , then . 
 What face ? 
 Yeah , I know . You are right . 
 A lot . I probably got to moonlight for the rest of my life , but so what , it ’ s worth it . Come on , get in . Let ’ s take a drive . 
 Check out what happens when I put on the brakes suddenly . It can stop quickly . 
 Yes , I know it . I went through my last set of tires fast . I even had three flat tires in two weeks . 
 Cut out , would you ? 
 It's just around the corner . 
 Yeah , I'm very worried about his health . 
 He's working too hard . 
 I am Mormon , so I go to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints . 
 Mormons believe that , after the death of Christ and the death of the Apostles 10 , their church Christ founded became corrupt and the authority of Christ on earth was lost to men . In 1830 , a prophet named Joseph Smith was brought up by God to restore the church . 
 That means that they all have parts of the original gospel , but not all . 
 Yes . 
 We gather together to encourage each other , because we have common beliefs . We come together and call it church . 
 That's okay . Better late than never . 
 Hello ! I was exhausted some studying , so I decided to read the newspaper to relax . Unfortunately , the news is so depressing . There has been another murder in the city center . I ’ m shocked that the police haven ’ t caught the killer yet . 
 You mean “ if ” they catch the murderer . I ’ m scared stiff about going into the city center at night . 
 Well , there was one good piece of news . You remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ? 
 Well , they ’ Ve got the money and she ’ s going tomorrow for treatment . 
 I ’ m sure they are . Oh , and a local man won the lottery . I ’ m so jealous ! I wish it were me ! I buy a lottery ticket every week and I ’ m amazed that I haven ’ t even won a small prize yet . It ’ s so unfair ! 
 Hi ! Tom . Want to go to play bowling tonight ? 
 Let me see . How about 6:30 at the gate of the club ? 
 Are there many idioms in English ? 
 Can you give us an example ? 
 What about the expression goodbye ? Is that an idiom ? 
 This is interesting , Ms.Parker . 
 Because Myra was cheating on exams , and she spoke back rudely . 
 Do you know where I can park ? 
 I want a space on campus . 
 Where can I find it ? 
 Is it full ? 
 When was that ? 
 Would it be full now ? 
 Have you heard of the Love Bug ? 
 Yes . It is one of the most harmful computer viruses in the world . People say it will break out again om Valentines ' Day this year . 
 Hackers are smart , and they want people to know about it . 
 I am confused by what he said . 
 I don ’ t know what he wants to do . Does he want help me or just scold me ? 
 Where are you going ? 
 What ’ s the matter ? 
 That ’ s too bad . How are things now ? 
 Want to meet for lunch this Saturday ? 
 What are you doing ? 
 What kind of volunteer work ? 
 Oh , yeah ? 
 Are the children all grown up now , Rose ? 
 Oh , very interesting . And what about Rita ? She was such a bright child — always reading . 
 Really ? And Chris ? She was a very pretty little girl . 
 Oh , how interesting . And what about Larry and Rocky ? 
 Really ? Where does he live now ? 
 And does Rocky drive a truck , too ? 
 Really ? Where does he fly ? Does he fly to other countries ? 
 Merry Christmas , Linda ! 
 Linda , thank you for this wonderful Christmas dinner . I really enjoyed it . 
 Where's your better half ? 
 Look , there are some words on the fish . 
 For God's sake ! It's too bloody . How can people be so cruel ? 
 You can't prick the fish to please the sick tastes of some bloody people . 
 Just an animal ? But it has life too . If you want a tattoo , get one . It's your choice because you want it . But has anyone asked the fish if it wanted one ? 
 Who's singing in your home , Jim ? 
 Who's Ellie ? 
 Oh , I see.how old is she ? 
 I suppose they're playing games . 
 Today . 
 Yes . 
 Eighteen.Some friends are having a birthday party for me tonight.Do you want to come ? 
 About 6:00 . 
 Well , it was nice meeting you . 
 Sure , I'll give you a call . 
 I saw an interesting program on TV last night . It was about elderly people . 
 It said that people with a positive attitude 7 tend to live longer and happier . 
 And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress . 
 Did you see the information on sales for last year ? The sales review was made at our last board meeting . There's a great news for our shareholders . 
 We've never sold this much before , our growth this year has been phenomenal . We have captured 8 % of the market , up from last year by 120 % . Our strategy is working ! 
 The company's performance has improved since Wallace became president . He's made our little business into a real lucrative operation . Products are selling like hotcakes . 
 Let's hope this stroke of good luck lasts . I hope we are over our financial difficulties for good . 
 What a letdown . I wanted to experience some Mafia culture firsthand . 
 Such a thing exists ? 
 Am I ? Um ... my face gets red when I walk too fast . 
 Did you get any rewards or honors in college ? 
 Did you join the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) ? 
 Your brand new car is so excellent . I like it very much . 
 Are you watching the soccer match tonight ? It must be the most exciting one in this season . 
 Manchester United . What about you ? 
 I have confidence in them . 
 And it's a long one . I have Monday off . It's Memorial Day or something like that . 
 Sounds good . What do we need to bring ? 
 I'll dig out the Frisbee and my kite from Taiwan . 
 What ’ s up ? 
 America ? Did you get admit to MIT ? 
 Congratulations ! Susan . I ’ m so happy for you . 
 Really going to miss you . 
 Ok . Take care . Have a nice journey . 
 Look after yourself . Bye . 
 You know , Taylor's been in the hospital for a couple of days . 
 But you're not to blame for them keeping him there . 
 I'm not sure , but we can find out . I bought some crosswords to keep him busy . 
 Did you see Ally Mabel last night ? 
 Yes , wasn't it funny ? 
 Ha , yes , brilliant ! 
 Oh , would you please turn off the fire ? My hands are sticky with the dough . 
 Thanks . 
 Yes , but why does she have such a long face ? 
 I thought she'd be happy . 
 I don't know . Maybe it ’ s some kind of personal problem . 
 You've got to be joking ! It's the teacher's right to say anything wants , and if she saw Myra cheating , she certainly had the right to say so . 
 You're right . If I were the teacher , I wouldn't have done that . 
 Am I late for the party ? Looks everyone is already here . Hope I didn ’ t miss something interesting . 
 Great , here are some flowers for you . I hope you like them . I was not sure if the color will suit your new apartment . 
 Don ’ t bother . I will help myself . 
 It is such a nice place . 
 Steven , would you like to go dance with us tonight ? 
 You look so upset . What's going on ? 
 Oh , what a pity ! 
 Is it that bad ? It ’ s nothing more than a game . 
 Oh , come on ! Failure is the mother of success . Don ’ t lose heart . I'm sure you'll succeed . 
 I understand . 
 It's very nice . I haven't heard live music in a while . This is fun . 
 Of course . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer ... 
 You're dancing so well . 
 When did you learn to dance ? 
 It's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz . 
 Oh , I like it . It's such a beautiful dance , but I can't do it well . What about you ? 
 Thank you for the dance . 
 OK . 
 Yes , I agree . The air here is much more polluted than in my country . Of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry . 
 The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don't believe that any single country can do anything about it . 
 I just had a terrible week . 
 I fell down and hurt my arm . 
 Then my son drove into a tree . 
 The dog bit the delivery boy . 
 And a storm blew our roof away . 
 I ’ m so excited , mother . Oh , a new baby ! 
 And my first nephew . He looks a lot like you , mum . He does . 
 Yes , he does have Richard ’ s eyes . The baby even looks like you than Richard does . 
 It ’ s true . Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways . And she is shy with new people just like he is . 
 You ’ re right . 
 I go to bed at ten and get up at six . 
 Sure . 
 When I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ? 
 That's right . Why do you ask ? 
 When are getting married ? 
 Congratulations ! I had no idea . 
 Do you like amusement parks ? 
 If you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you'll have a good time . 
 Even those . It'll be very romantic , I think . You'll have loads of fun . 
 I'm sure he'll love the idea . Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it ! 
 Yes , I can , but not very well . 
 More or less . How well do you understand Mr . Wang , your Chinese teacher ? 
 you look better today . How did your test go ? 
 did you pass ? 
 you should be . You worked really hard last night preparing for it . 
 you don't have to thank me . It's just a part of my job as your counsellor . 
 no , in fact , I was terrible at taking exams . 
 sure , but my teachers always encouraged me to do the best that I could and that helped me a lot . When are your final exams ? 
 when do you plan on studying for those exams ? 
 do you think that's a good idea ? 
 that sounds like a good idea . What are you going to do if you have any questions while you're studying ? 
 it sounds like you've learned something useful this year ! 
 Oh , you don't ask much , do you ? 
 I'll tell you what . Your class can rent them from me for the night and buy back any damaged ones . 
 Not as fun though . A live band is way more exciting ! 
 Let me know with your next dance . I know a band that may give you a break for the publicity . 
 Sure , which beach are we going to ? 
 I like Santa Monica . 
 I just like the pier they have at Santa Monica . 
 Is Malibu beach nice ? 
 So you want to go to Malibu ? 
 Sure , let's go to Malibu . 
 I hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan for action , but I doubt it ’ ll happen before it ’ s too late . 
 Everyone is looking at the issue in the short term , rather than the long term . It ’ s the same with the destruction of the rainforests . Countries and companies just want the wood . They ’ re not thinking about the long-term damage to the forests . We should also remember that the forests are an important natural habitat for thousands of species of animal and plant life . 
 It also means that people sometimes fight over the famp 3land that remains . Damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people . 
 I think I ’ d like to do that . I could take the things I learn here back to my country when I have finished my studies . 
 I just opened my own restaurant . I'm also head chef . 
 Well , I used to hate cooking , but now I love it . 
 After I tried French food . Before that , I used to cook really boring things for my family . 
 Yeah . I went to California to study . 
 I was there between 88 and 90 . 
 Then I came back here . I worked for about three years to get some experience . 
 A house warming party ? 
 Congratulations ! That ’ s wonderful . I bet both of you are quite happy . 
 I understand . That ’ s why Christopher and I want to find a place in a small town , far from the city . 
 I agree . That ’ s why Christopher is already looking for a job in Maine , or Wisconsin . 
 I am trying to find this book . 
 It doesn ’ t seem like this library has it . 
 I have already . 
 It says the book is on the shelf , but I didn ’ t find it there . 
 You can do that ? 
 That ’ s fantastic . Thank you . 
 I would like to rent a car . What kind of car do you have ? 
 What is the rate ? 
 How about mileage and gas ? 
 OK . I'll try a Pinto . I want to rent a car for one week . 
 Here you are . 
 Sure , I'd love to . 
 There is nothing good at the moment.Let ' s do something different.Would you like to go to a concert ? 
 Fine ! Do you want anything to eat now ? 
 Well , let's go and have something to drink instead . I know a good place . It's a little expensive , but it's fun . 
 Yes , that's true . 
 It depends.But usually it's about 15 days . 
 Yes , dumpling is a must.There is also other food.For example , people eat chicken for good luck . 
 Yes , it's really wonderful ! 
 I'm sure you'll have a good time . 
 Yeah.Especially when you have something urgent to do . 
 That's true . 
 do you have any other symptoms ? 
 just a little . Has your toothache gone now ? 
 how about your tongue ? Does it still hurt ? 
 how did you get that burn again ? 
 you haven't had much luck lately , have you ? 
 when's the last time you took your tablets ? 
 I think it's time you took another does of each . What would you like to drink with them ? 
 sure , I'll just go and get it now . what would you like to eat ? Some soup ? 
 soup always makes me feel better when I'm sick . I hope it makes you feel better , too . 
 Why don't you find someone who is in the know . 
 Did you ask his former secretary , Lora ? She knows a lot about him . 
 What are you two doing in here ? 
 I was sitting there giving out nametags and all of a sudden , there she was . 
 All these memories of prom night came back to me . I had to be alone . You remember that night ? 
 You're not looking happy.What ' s the matter ? 
 With the job ? 
 A good suggestion for you.You need a holiday . 
 What do you mean ? 
 You need a holiday.That ' s what's the matter . 
 Oh dear , Miss , you are soaked ! Wow , it's really raining heavily outside . 
 Well please , why don't you go ahead of me in line ? I'm in no hurry . 
 My pleasure Miss . Actually , could you recommend what to eat here ? I've never been here before . 
 Well , thanks for the suggestions . 
 Dad , what's the date ? 
 In seven days it will be Christmas Day . 
 So , can I buy some new shoes as a Christmas present ? 
 What happen , John ? 
 Why do you look unhappy ? 
 Oh , cheer up . He ’ ll understand you . 
 Yeah , how do you like him ? 
 Can you give me a touch of his character ? 
 Do you think I should buy this now and bring it with us ? 
 Brooke , are you still mad ? Is your mom mad ? 
 It will be . And today is , too . I just talked to the airlines ... 
 No , they're giving us discount tickets on a honeymoon package in ... 
 You got it ! We'll fly there directly from Texas . 
 The world changes , the family changes too . 
 People now like a small family composed of two parents and one child . 
 I don't like such a family . 
 I like a family composed of many people . It includes grandparents , parents , aunts and uncles , and children . 
 We can live well , I think . 
 We had a difference of opinion . 
 She'll be fine . 
 You bet ! 
 Really ? That's a straws in the wind . 
 Yeah . They suit each other . A perfect match between a man and a girl . 
 I was told my friend Joe was speaking ill of me . That's a real let-down . 
 Maybe I should go and ask him whether it's true . 
 Good morning , Mr . Smith . 
 Well , thank you , Mr . Smith . But I was just doing my job . 
 It's nice of you to say so . 
 I ’ Ve been to most of the countries in Europe , several countries in asia-china , Japan , korea , and Thailand-and to the united states and Canada . 
 No , but I ’ m planning on visiting Australia and new Zealand soon . I ’ Ve heard that they are beautiful countries . Which is the most beautiful country you ’ Ve been to ? 
 Isn ’ t it really cold there ? 
 I ’ Ve been to other Scandinavian countries , but not to Norway . Perhaps I should go and do some winter sports there . 
 No thanks . I have had enough . 
 To tell you the truth , I am on the diet . 
 Well , I am gaining weight these days , and I have to watch my calories . 
 Thanks for inviting me . Here is the gift for you . Happy birthday , Francis ! Many more happy and healthy years for you ! 
 Yes , please do . 
 Yeah , I was really struggling whether I should give you this nice little car . It was the last one they had and I really like it so much myself . 
 Did you read the news that ' China's property prices rose at the fastest pace in 18 months in December , ending the year with rising fears of bubbles in the property market ' ? 
 Yes . It says the hike was a result of purchase rush in the fourth quarter on expectations of tightening politics . 
 Right . The climbing property prices has become a headache for Chinese residents . 
 I think they must have horrible lives . All the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . They must get sick of it . 
 I think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . They only want it for their films . 
 Show biz stars have plenty of expenses . That ’ s why they need so much money . They need million of dollars to buy big , seclude houses and wonderful dresses . I bet most show biz stars would prefer to wear jeans and a t-shirt , but they can ’ t because their managers force them to wear clothes they don ’ t like . 
 I think you should give them some credit . They ’ re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves . 
 Hi , it is a pleasant surprise ! 
 Couldn ’ t be better . And you ? 
 Hey , Mary , can you cut that out ? 
 The tapping of your pen on your desk . It ’ s driving me crazy . 
 I don ’ t slurp my coffee . And plus , how can you hear it when you ’ re shouting into your phone all the time ? 
 Look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it ’ s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . But , it ’ s probably not a good idea to keep it up I ’ m willing to forgive and forget and if you are . 
 Yeah , I ’ ll try to do the same . So , I was wondering you wanna go out to dinner Friday night ? 
 Autumn is the best season in Beijing , you know . 
 What is the weather like in Washington at this time of this year ? 
 Is it very cold in winter there ? 
 Does it rain a lot in summer there ? 
 There's a lot of rain in summer , but it seldom rains in autumn . 
 That's true . Many people from the south don't like the weather here . 
 No , I'm from the north . I was born in Beijing , actually . 
 Mike , come and look at this painting of shrimp ! It is so simple yet so vivid ! 
 Yes , it is . How do you know that ? 
 Cool ! What kind of Chinese painting do you prefer , free sketch or claborate-style painting ? 
 That's true . Chinese art stresses the harmony between man and nature , which is an important part of China's traditional culture . 
 So do I . Let ’ s go to other areas to see what they have got , shall we ? 
 Lousy weather , isn't it ? 
 Look at the ice there hanging from the eaves . 
 Do you know what the temperature is today ? 
 It feels like ten degrees below zero at least . I don't mind the cold weather but I do hate it when it gets slippery . 
 That's great . Let's go skating together tomorrow . 
 You're welcome . Did you have a good time on this vacation ? 
 Me too . Please write to me as soon as you get Boston . 
 OK , they begin to register . 
 Have a nice journey ! Do give my regards to your parents . 
 Eight to twelve in the morning , two to six in the afternoon . 
 What are your hours ? 
 Would it be all right if I went home next weekend ? 
 Well , I want to surprise my brother showing up for his birthday . 
 Could you tell me what university you went to , Mr . Smith ? 
 Did you ? And what did you study ? 
 Would you mind telling me how old you are ? 
 And could you tell me what other jobs you have had ? 
 And what was your salary at the bank ? 
 Hi , Jane . How are you doing this morning ? 
 Late night ? 
 I am going to celebrate my birthday with you all in a night club this year , what do you say ? 
 How did that happen ? 
 Sounds cool ! But that is not what a lady should do . People are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk . 
 I ’ m a doctor . 
 Yes , I do . It ’ s very interesting . What ’ s your job ? 
 Oh , do you enjoy it ? 
 what a nice garden ! Look at these tulips ! 
 all right . Would you please stand closer to the flower bed ? Good . Smile . Say " cheese " . OK , got you . That's terrific . 
 no problem . 
 do you know how to set the timer ? 
 OK , let's have a try . 
 did it come out ? 
 never mind . Let's go to the falls and try again . 
 Did you watch television last night , Charles ? 
 It was a good game , wasn't it ? 
 What a pity . It was quite exciting . Both teams played very well . 
 It finished in a draw . What was the film like ? 
 Did your wife enjoy it ? 
 Hey , Vernassa . why be angry look ? 
 I've never seen you so worked up . what did she do to you ? 
 Are you sure she was trying to put you down ? 
 You shall go easy on her . she is new here . 
 You shall just take it in surprise . 
 Try to pull it together , Vernassa . I am sure things will turn note , ok ? 
 Well . if you think I can help , let me know . 
 I ’ m forming a music band . 
 Uh ... Yeah ! I ’ Ve told you a thousand times that I ’ m learning to play the drums . Now that I know how to play well , I would like to form a rock band . 
 We have a guy who plays guitar , and another who plays bass.Although we still haven ’ t found anyone to be our singer . You told me that you had some musical talent , right ? 
 Perfect . So you can audition this weekend here at my house . 
 I've heard you're going to America tomorrow . I want to see you off at the airport . 
 What time are you leaving ? 
 What airline and what flight ? 
 I'll see you at the airport at 12 thirty P . m . 
 I ’ m sorry , dad . But you can ’ t do that . It ’ s for me to decide . 
 I didn ’ t say I ’ d already decided , dad . I said it was for me to decide . There is a difference . 
 I didn ’ t say that either . I was hoping we could discuss the matter together . I want your advice but I don ’ t want you to tell me what to do . I ’ Ve got to make decisions for myself , dad . 
 I'd like to book a table tonight . 
 Eight . 
 Eight o'clock tonight , would you please set us in a private room ? 
 Maybe not , thank you all the same then . 
 Yeah , I'm going to be making phone calls all day . What a blast . 
 Save it , Vince . After I put my first million in the bank , I'll say you're welcome . 
 That is the most beautiful sunset ! 
 Here is a good place . Let's get out . 
 Mother Nature is quite an artist . 
 Amazing . The sun is almost gone and yet there is still color everywhere ! 
 What a nice day ! Why don't we go for an outing ? 
 How about going to the suburbs ? 
 Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? 
 But you should have told me you were in love with her . 
 You know you didn't . 
 Yes , but you might have told me before . 
 You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ? 
 Oh , you men ! You're all the same . 
 Hi , Jim . 
 He ’ s been sick since he came back from Italy . 
 Yes , Doctor William said that he could come back to work ASAP . 
 He's a little sick under the weather . 
 He has the flu . 
 I will . 
 No , it's no use . 
 I know . She won't change my grade . 
 the end of all the hard work for my master's . what a nice feeling to get my degree ! 
 certainly . After years of hard work , I wouldn't miss it . By the way , where can I find cap and gown ? 
 oh , I think they're provided by the school for that special day . 
 what do most of the students do ? 
 then , I might as well have them made . 
 hold it a second . I want to fix my hairpin . 
 here's Lisa . May I take a picture with her ? 
 Do you mind if I ask you a question ? 
 What do you do in order to improve your English ? 
 It ’ s a good idea to have a radio , isn ’ t it ? 
 It takes a long time to learn a language , doesn ’ t it ? 
 Good morning , Sue . 
 I'm fine , thanks , how about yourself ? 
 I am heading for the library . I've got a research project to do.How about you ? 
 See you later , alligator . 
 Is the environment a big issues in your country ? It is in mine . 
 What methods do you use to conserve water ? 
 I see . I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution . 
 We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced . 
 I think you ’ re right . There needs to be an international response to this problem . 
 I see . I have run as fast as I can . 
 Well I had several tests and an oral presentation this week so I didn ’ t get a chance to memorize the second page , but I think I mastered the tricky section . 
 Charles ? Before I start I was wondering if it was ok if I put a small crescendo in here and then decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here ? 
 It was horrible ! I played play it much better at home ! 
 Is that better ? 
 Sorry ! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make . 
 Can you tell me the time ? 
 Is your watch right ? 
 I heard that you're going on your first date Friday night . 
 Angry ? Why would I be ? 
 Come on . Dating is a part of young people's social life . Besides , you're sixteen already . 
 Do you want to borrow my coat ? I have a black coat that would look smashing on you . 
 Hi , Mary , long time no see . 
 Yes , next March . 
 Jim and you are bosom friends , aren't you ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 is everything alright ? 
 what took so long ? I thought your flight was supposed to arrive 3 hours ago ! 
 I didn't hear anything about a delay . I thought everything was running on time . What happened ? 
 then what ? Your plane was three hours late ! 
 turbulence is pretty normal , isn't it ? 
 so where did you land ? 
 that sounds like a nightmare ! 
 have you had anything to eat ? 
 I had a few coffees while I was waiting . Let's get out of here ! 
 What's that ? 
 Don't worry about it . It's not new , it already has a few scratches . Did you get hurt ? 
 That's the most important thing . 
 Forget about it . 
 Maybe , but really I have fallen a couple of times and it's been hit once or twice as well . 
 What date is it today ? 
 Oh , the day after tomorrow is Christmas . 
 Hello ! I'm Penny , I moved here just now . 
 Nice to meet you , too . I thought I should come and say hello to you . I haven't known anybody . 
 Yes . Would you like to come here later to have a coffee ? Bring all your family . 
 About 4 . 
 No , just come here . 
 Bye . 
 Oh , how dreadful ! I ’ m ever so sorry . 
 Thank God ! 
 That's a great idea . It's the best season for tourists in Florida . You can also get a good sun-tan there . 
 You can put on your shades . And remember don't make your skin look like a tomato . Or else after that your skin will begin to flake off . You may even wind up with skin cancer . 
 You said it . 
 What does it say ? 
 Thank you . But I don't think I'll bother . 
 I don't think I'll have any trouble with getting old . But perhaps you can keep the article for a while , I may read it later . 
 I'm so honored that you thought to ask me . 
 You're going to do great . And you're going to look great . 
 I still like the olive one best . There's a tailor here who can take up the sleeves for you . 
 These guys are professional . I think they can have it done tomorrow . Let's ask . 
 Not particularly . I like fat girls . 
 I can ’ t say I do . What I like a girl with good manners . 
 Yes . But I like a girl with a nice personality . 
 Not particularly . I like a girl to be good . 
 We're waiting in line to get one of Master Li's Chinese couplets . I got one last year and I had good luck all year ! 
 He's Taipei's most famous calligraphy master ! Quick ! Get in line ! 
 I suppose you like cinematography and costumes and that sort of stuff ? 
 I think sound is even more important ! Guns , bombs , sirens--that's what makes a movie exciting ! 
 In my book , all a good movie needs is a chase scene and lots of things that blow up . 
 What day is today ? 
 Tomorrow is Friday . It's going to be the weekend . 
 We'll meet again in a few days . 
 Try to keep cool . It's not an easy take . 
 Then you will be in line for a doom . 
 It's Friday . 
 Yes , I ’ m new . 
 I transferred from another school . 
 I was at PCC before . 
 I was going to go here first , but my grades weren ’ t good enough . 
 PCC is an incredible school . 
 I ’ m sure I ’ ll like it here . 
 What's the trouble ? 
 What about your friend ? Did she fall for him ? 
 Now you don't have the butterflies in your stomach , do you ? 
 Sure , what do you need to do there ? 
 I have to exchange some money . 
 I also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . There was a problem last week . 
 Their interest rates are usually quite high . It ’ s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest . 
 would you like to live in the country ? I ’ m not sure I ’ d like it . 
 What do you mean ? 
 I see what you mean . I love being far away from a city , but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities . 
 I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . They ’ re so much better to look at than concrete , rows of parked cars and tall buildings . 
 The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . There ’ s so sign of pollution . The village looks so peaceful . 
 You ’ re right . I would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . I would hate living in the country ! 
 Nothing much . What are you up to ? 
 He took the civil service exam and failed . 
 Yeah . He's been sitting in his room everyday for the last 4 days . 
 That's a great idea . Why don't you call him . I already talked to him a couple of times and it might be good for him to hear from somebody else . 
 Sounds good . 
 Are you sure ? He is quite young , isn't he ? 
 Really ? He looks so young . 
 Thank you . 
 We're happy together now . We both think that we're a well-matched couple . 
 The situation differs in person . 
 Take it easy . I have to cut my losses . 
 I know , but I don't have a choice , my boss has complete control over our work schedules . I haven't made it out of the office before 9 PM a single day this week . 
 No , not exactly , I'm working for minimum wage.And they don't give extra pay for overtime . Overtime is our own time . 
 They do give bonuses at the end of the year for the employees with highest productivity numbers , but frankly , it's not much of an incentive . They give us a bonus of ten dollars . 
 I would , but I'm afraid I would't be able to find another job . I don't have very many job marketable skills , there aren't so many jobs that I'm qualified for . 
 The tranquility of the night , the chirping of some insects , everything is so natural ! 
 And I was overwhelmed by this scene , too . 
 Let me check . Hold on , please ... Yes , that's fine . Smoking or nonsmoking area ? 
 All right . May I have your name ? 
 How do you spell it , sir ? 
 Does the class start again , Mam ? 
 Oh , breaktime flies . 
 Mam , another minute , could I ? 
 why are you so upset today , Maria ? Cheer up ! 
 it ’ s a great opportunity . You should be happy with the offer . 
 why ? It ’ s unfair . You can learn a lot from it . 
 that may be true . But I ’ m sure you ’ re able to find a balance between them . Why not try it ? 
 I agree with you but I think you really need to talk to your mother and tell her what's on your mind . 
 just let her know that the experience will be both amazing and rewarding . And more importantly , you can manage both your study and the job . 
 sure . Every cloud has its silver lining . Just try . 
 sure . Good luck , Maria ! 
 I went to play tennis in the public park . 
 Twice a week . How about you ? 
 What is very difficult to gather team player together . 
 Do you like watching football matches ? 
 Why are you all dressed up ? 
 I ’ m sick of my job , I always have to work late at night , and the company keeps me working in the office . 
 What do you suggest ? I can ’ t afford to quit my job until I get a new one . 
 I saw an interesting program on TV last night . It was about elderly people . 
 It said that people with a positive attitude tend to live longer and happier . 
 And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress . 
 Saying you want to kill yourself , you terrified me out of my wits . 
 That ’ s too much . 
 Where are you going this weekend ? 
 Oh really ? It ’ ll be nice and warm there . Have you been there before ? 
 I see . What ’ s it like there ? 
 Well , have a great time ! 
 All right , Sis ! 
 I really wish Mom and Dad were here with us . 
 Me ? Er , I like hot weather , just like today . 
 I like to watch Barbie sticking her tongue out . 
 By the way , what's your favorite weather ? 
 Look , is that Tom ? 
 Well , that's life . 
 Yeah , he did . But he only won it by a hair's breadth . 
 Yeah . To win is the most important thing . 
 It's my geography , sir.The Map of Africa you set us . 
 Yes , I know , sir . I'm sorry . 
 My mother's been ill and I had to stay at home . 
 It's true , sir . 
 Are you new here ? I come to this coffeehouse often . But I didn't see you here before . 
 Do you mind if I ask you why you've taken the part-time job here ? 
 Oh , are you an English student ? Or you just study English for interest's sake ? 
 Very nice . Thank you for your time . 
 OK then . I don't want to put you in trouble . 
 OK . But I'd like some cookies . 
 I surely know that . Don't forget that I am a regular customer here . 
 It's OK . Thank you . 
 I don't think so . It changes so quickly this time . 
 I think you can go to visit the museum . It's worth seeing . You can go to the square some other time . 
 Let's go in . 
 Could you tell me what university you want to go to , John ? 
 What university would you enter ? 
 Oh , I forget . Sorry . 
 Did you ? And what course did you take there ? 
 I've not known . Perhaps , I've got a bad memory . 
 Terrific ! B . A . , again and again-B . A . 
 Did you see his last dive ? 
 He's diving for the gold . 
 Yes . I have been here for three years . 
 Well . I ’ m rather disappointed with it . 
 It ’ s too old . And it isn ’ t as specious as I expected . 
 I ’ ll just have to put up with it . 
 Don ’ t be too humble . Few young men could be equal to Mark . And in some respects Joe and Mark are neck and neck . 
 Hi Mark . 
 What are you planning to do today ? 
 Would you like to have lunch with me ? 
 Is 11:30 AM OK ? 
 I said , 11:30 AM . 
 OK , how about 12:30 PM ? 
 How about Bill's Seafood Restaurant ? 
 It's on 7th Street . 
 How have you been ? 
 Hi , Monica , congratulations ! Your presentation at the meeting was very successful and everyone was impressed by your speech . And it was so persuasive and I bet our clients will be convinced to invest their money in this project . You really made a big contribution to our company . 
 You must have been prepared for a long time . Some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find , right ? 
 Now , the effort pays off . You have accomplished something . 
 I hate to say goodbye , but it's late . 
 I wish I could.But I'm afraid I can't . I've got some serious studying to do . I have to go . 
 See you on Moday.Have a great weekend . 
 Are you really dating with Frank ? 
 Then why not keep away from him ? 
 That ’ s stupid . 
 I'm fine . I've been out of town . I just got back . 
 I was in New York for a wedding . 
 I like it a lot . It has a very funny beginning , I think . It attracts your attention the moment you begin reading it . 
 I like the plot . It's so full of twists and turns . I also like the main character . She is so humorous and smart . 
 The ending is a bit weak . It's so abrupt , like those of most other detective stories . 
 Really ? Generally they will turn out to be a good thing . 
 You ’ ll exert all your energy and get out of it . 
 Yes , it's my new business phone . Do you like it ? 
 Yes , it's got wireless Internet access . 
 Yes , but I don't really use it often . Have you ever used it ? 
 Yes , I guess I should try to use it . 
 Good morning , John ! 
 I'd be delighted to , John . Saturday did you say ? 
 I'm pretty sure I'll be all right . In fact , I'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you . What time are you planning to start ? 
 That sounds fine . I'll be there around seven . 
 I didn't realize it was so difficult though I know I'm always too nervous in such competition . 
 I don't think I performed well . 
 Can you tell me how to improve myself ? 
 Thank you for your encouragement . 
 I just dropped in to say goodbye . 
 I'll leave at 10 o'clock . 
 Thank you , I will . Hope to see you again next year . 
 May , just let him go . 
 I know . 
 He lives nearby and he would just glance at the newspaper headlines , read the political sections and return them later . 
 He used to be a hero during the war time and everyone respect him . 
 Yes , he has no children and his wife passed away when he was in the battle . 
 I bet . But he is always busy telling the children stories . 
 How may I help you ? 
 Do you have your library card with you ? 
 You ’ re going to have to wait for a computer . 
 Please put your name on this list . 
 When there is a computer available , I will call you . 
 Just type in the number on the back of your library card . 
 Are you coming to the bridal shower for Jane ? 
 Aug 8 . 
 Mrs . White . 
 Maybe her uncle will . 
 Right . Red Rochester will officiate at the wedding . 
 Yes , Jane says they will go to China . 
 No problem . I can deal with it well . 
 All is best now , isn ’ t it ? 
 Don't build a fire under me . I know the importance of time . 
 Don't you see I'm trying my best ? 
 Oh no , I won't . But we will have an accident if you don't stop shouting . 
 Oh , shut up , will you ? It was all your fault.If you'd kept quite this would never have happened . 
 Steve , you look pale . What happened ? 
 Did you have something on your mind ? You look so concerned . Maybe I can help you . 
 Is there anything I can do to help you ? 
 Lodge , You must come around sometime , You have to check out my mew stereo . 
 Can you make it on Tuesday ? 
 Anytime after six will be fine . 
 My friend Jean is very beautiful . 
 Perfect , and I like her charming eyes too . 
 Dark blue . 
 I ’ m not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ? 
 I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly . 
 Did she ? That ’ s great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the enviroment . 
 Oh , he ’ s fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays . 
 I had mine when I was 24 . that ’ s a little young . I ’ d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career . 
 Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ? 
 Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom . 
 Hey Mike . I forgot about registration . I'm a day late , so all the classes are mostly full . What do you think I should do ? 
 Do you think going to the registration building will help at all ? 
 Did you register yet ? 
 What classes do you think are still open ? 
 That's helpful . Thanks . But what do you think about philosophy . I wanted to take that class this semester . 
 He does that ? 
 That makes sense . I think I'll do that . Thanks for all the help . 
 Thanks for helping me move into my new house . 
 I've been so stressed these days . 
 I don't know where to go for college , and what to major in . 
 And I also want to get scholarships to help me pay for the tuition . I want to get the burden off my family . 
 OK , OK . I'm so sorry . By the way , for you , is it more important to make money or to enjoy your work ? 
 OK , honey , stop dreaming . You should face the reality . 
 En , first you should be concentrated on what the teacher said in class . Second , I suggest you to take an additional course in some training center . 
 I think so . Because I've taken one to improve my oral English during summer vacation . 
 Why ? 
 Yes , they do . Do you have a Christmas tree this year ? 
 I can't now because I have to buy a present for my mother . 
 I don't know when I can come . I'll let you know later . 
 Yes , you're right . 
 I've tried to give up smoking several times , but it's no good . Smoking relaxes me . 
 Yes , maybe I should have another try . 
 Awful . It was a complete waste of time . 
 It was about a married couple . They had to live with the wife's mother , because they didn't have enough money to buy a house of their own . 
 Yes . but the husband had to work overtime three times a week , so he was always tired . 
 Yes , it does , doesn't it ? But this man was always over-tired , and he couldn't sleep.So he used to take two sleeping pill every night . 
 Yes , but not two every night . Anyway , the strain was too much for him . He had nervous breakdown and had to go to hospital . 
 Not really . His wife was able to find a good job as an interpreter , because she could speak French and German fluently . After a few months ' work , she had a better job than her husband . So in the end , 
 Would you like to stretch your legs ? 
 Let's get a soft drink . 
 It's a fifteen-minute intermission . 
 It's a new concert hall and the acoustics are great . 
 Is this your first time to come to a symphony concert ? 
 Do you have large concert halls in your city ? 
 That's great . Well , we'd better get back to our seats . It's about to start . 
 What time will the library be closing ? 
 Does it always close at six ? 
 Will the library be open on Saturday ? 
 What are your hours on Saturday ? 
 All right . Thank you . 
 That ’ s it . Thank you . 
 That of the old man . 
 Some of the scenes moved me into tears . 
 Pardon ? 
 Zina , I hope you're not scheming to make Elvin look bad . 
 Dave then ? Dave is a spy for WebTracker ? You can't be serious . 
 Hello , Zhang lin ! Fancy meeting you here ! 
 How's life going , Zhang Lin ? 
 Pretty good , thanks . I'm going to see my uncle . 
 Good bye . 
 Yeah , he has a good commend of computer skills . But ... 
 But he is always talking big . 
 My feelings exactly . 
 I couldn't agree with you more . 
 You are absolutely right . 
 That's exactly the way I feel . 
 Are you kidding ? Don't you know I can't swim ? 
 Hey , don't shout . Come here ! Sit closer . Now , Jim , we ’ Ve had a lovely day . Don't spoil it now . 
 Everybody who walks past me sees it . Besides , it's a good sunbathing suit . 
 Jim ! 
 Can you get me a beach umbrella and a deck chair ? I am really tired of lying in thousand . 
 Are you serious ? That will be wonderful ! 
 I'm sorry , but you were the only one who had access to it . 
 I wonder if the municipal government will take some preventive measures . 
 Adam , could you show me around the school ? 
 What's the tallest building ? 
 Yes . 
 What's the building to the south of the library ? 
 Is there a swimming pool in your school ? 
 I do envy you . And I hope I can enter your school one day . 
 Television is undoubtedly a great invention , but one of the main criticisms of it is that people just aren't selective enough . Lesley , got a television . how do you pick out the sorts ofprogrammes you want to watch ? 
 Do you think of television though as a great time-waster ? 
 Aha , but how do you prevent it coming into your life and taking oversour evenings and at the same time perhaps get . . . get out of thetelevision some of the sort of best things ... best programmes that ... that undoubtedly are on television ? 
 Do you think though that ... that in . . . in a sense television skilled people's own er ... sort of , creativity or their ability entertain themselves because if they're bored all they do is justturn on the television ? 
 Don't be shy . Have some more chicken . 
 I feel pity for the old man . 
 It must be dreadful to grow old . 
 I'm going to see the doctor this weekend . 
 I think I need a thorough check-up . 
 Professor , I am going to need to leave class early today . 
 I need to go to the airport to pick up a relative . 
 Yes , I've got that part covered . 
 I don't need to leave until the very end of class . 
 Thanks , Professor . See you later ! 
 I'm going to try sky diving this weekend . 
 It's sounds like fun . 
 I want to try something exciting . 
 I'll tell you all about it next Monday . 
 Does he know that he has already at his wits ' end ? 
 He might be driven up a wall . You should not handle your relation with him with kid gloves . 
 I visited the famous variety show host , Dennis . 
 Oh , he's a very serious person . 
 Hi ! My name is Mike . 
 Nice to meet you , too . 
 I'm from Shanghai . And you ? 
 Why do you go fishing so often ? 
 Hi , Cindy . I thought I ’ d missed you . 
 It ’ s all right . 
 I was in a comfortable place , so really , it ’ s no problem . I am happy to see you . Did the rain hold you up long ? 
 I totally understand . 
 Good morning , Emma ! A lovely day , isn't it ? 
 It is the best season for a picnic right now . Have you decided the place for your picnic ? 
 What did the whetherman say ? 
 Well , I will think it over . 
 Professor Donald , are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester ? 
 I wonder if I could enroll in it . I know it is a graduate course and I ' m a junior , but ... 
 I know , but the geology of the American west is my major interest and I have done a large reading in the field . 
 Oh , thanks , professor Donald . This is really very nice of you . 
 Isn't that a good thing ? Having fewer bosses means having less stress , don't you think ? 
 You're right , we do need leadership . But what we don't need is too many people to lead us . You know what they say about too many chiefs and not enough Indians ... 
 How do you like your job here , Linda ? 
 Why ? 
 I'm happy to hear that , but publishing is more than just talking to writers . it involves a lot of work , patience and responsibility . Most of the work is boring . 
 Do you have any complaints ? 
 Yes , you have many opportunities to grow in this company as long as you do well . 
 I don't think we've met . 
 My name is Dick Brown . 
 Mr . Smith often talked about you . 
 I'm honored to know you . 
 I don ’ t want to . 
 Certainly not . 
 Turn on the radio ? What for ? 
 Listen to some music ? And who ’ ll cook dinner ? Will you ? 
 To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate pop . 
 I am not in the mood . 
 I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . It's a real letdown . 
 But she did and it made me disappointed . 
 But she means a lot to me . 
 Oh , I just can't forget it . 
 What happened ? 
 Let's buy some flowers , and pay her a visit 
 OK . Let's go 
 Well , I know you are interested in architecture , so you should't miss the Temple of Heaven , and the Great wall is a must too . 
 Hi , Andy . I'm Judy . It's nice meeting you . 
 Come over and visit when you have time . 
 What do you do when you are angry ? 
 That ’ s smart . What do you usually do to relieve your anger ? 
 Oh , what kind of music do you listen to ? 
 I think that might work for me as well . 
 Like what ? 
 I'm sorry , but I can't come to your party . 
 Taylor , you're sweating up a storm ! 
 Yeah , you look a little shaky . And pale . You seriously need some time in the sun . 
 We're just worried about you , Taylor . 
 She is so stupid . 
 So what ? 
 Mrs.Smith , time has stood still with you ! 
 I'm not flattering you.You ' re full of energy every day . 
 What a police officer ! 
 It ’ s really unimaginable . The police officer screamed at the driver and used bad language , but the driver took it on the chin . 
 The bride's parents ' seating arrangement is on the left side of the aisle and the groom's parents is on the right side . 
 They usually do . 
 He isn't a punctual person . We may have to wait for a little while . 
 Make it three cups . Here comes Harry . 
 Because Myra was cheating on exams.and she spoke back rudely . 
 Is your city a historical place ? 
 How did it grow into such a large place ? 
 As the city grew , it must have absorbed many village nearby . 
 I see . Are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ? 
 Really ? So your city does have some old history after all . 
 My brother did it . 
 I laughed up my sleeves at him . He ’ s seen his girlfriend off at the airport and had lipstick on his face and did not know it . 
 Very nice . He gets along with his classmates very well . 
 Yes , indeed . 
 Five.My father , mother , brother , sister-in-law and me . 
 He is five years older than me , He got married last Sunday.My brother and my sister-in-law are the same age . 
 I failed my oral test . 
 I'm not practicing enough . 
 When I talk to Chinese , I always want to speak Chinese . 
 It ’ s dangerous . I don ’ t dare to go . 
 Did you get the car you wanted ? 
 What about the car over there ? 
 How may I help you ? 
 Is that all you need ? 
 You ’ re not allowed to do that . 
 It ’ s our policy . 
 Only books or videos . 
 You will have to read it here . 
 Have you heard the news ? 
 Such bad luck , 200 yuan was stolen by a thief on the bus today . 
 Well , you can just comfort yourself like that . 
 Well , we have the Thompsons , the Greens , and the Anderson , about twelve people total . 
 But that makes thirteen people ! We can't have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! 
 It's an old superstition . If we have thirteen people at the table , then it means bad luck . Can Andy bring a date ? 
 But we can't have thirteen for dinner ! 
 Absolutely not ! I refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! 
 That's better . 
 Hi , this is Maria . Is that Shirley ? 
 Shirley , do you know today's homework from our economic law class ? I have written it on a piece of paper but I can't find it now . 
 OK . 
 Explain the economic law ? An essay question again ? 
 Are there any clear answers in the book to this question ? 
 OK , thank you , Shirley . You are very helpful . I have another question . When does the Economic Law of China come into effect ? 
 There isn't such a code ? 
 Got it . Thank you , Shirley . 
 What time are you leaving ? 
 Take care , and give my best to your parents . 
 The performance is amazing . I'm curious about how they did it . I mean the way they sing . 
 So cool . Someone gave me this flier at the exit . What's it about ? 
 Oh , tell me about it . Anything interesting ? 
 ' The Drunken Beauty ' ? It's funny that we have ' Sleeping Beauty ' in my country . Anyway , what's it about ? Is the beauty a drunkard ? 
 Sure , people do that when they are drunk . What about the actress ? 
 Oh , I've heard about him before . He even created a special dance of sleeve shaking . 
 You know , interest is the best teacher . 
 Please do that . I can't wait to come back again . The performance must be really amazing . 
 That will be great . 
 The sea water treatments are supposed to be really good for you . 
 But the water has to be kept at 34 degrees so that the minerals can be absorbed by your body . 
 You got a letter in the mail . 
 What is it ? 
 What does it say ? 
 You can ’ t be serious ! 
 Are you all right ? 
 I ’ m sorry that you didn ’ t get in . 
 What are you going to do for one year abroad , Tom ? 
 You are going to take courses ? 
 Sounds hard . 
 Won't you get lonely ? 
 I went shopping without my umbrella yesterday morning . 
 So did i . that's why i didn't take my umbrella . i got cold in the rain in the afternoon.it was raining cats and dogs . 
 We really have some miserable weather sometime . i wish i would live somewhere which were sunning all year round . 
 I guess you are right . maybe i just wish the weather could be a little more predictable . 
 Those guys work at the same company and go to the same bars . They do everything together . 
 What ’ s your new job like ? 
 Um . 
 Very nice . 
 Well , that ’ s life , isn ’ t it ? 
 I ’ m here as a tourist . 
 Yes , it ’ s a small world . We never know where we ’ ll meet someone we know . 
 That's right 
 Last night 
 Yes , I enjoyed it very much . 
 Let me see . Ah , yes , I've been to England , France , Germany , Italy and now I've been in Spain 
 Two weeks 
 That's right 
 It's easy to get loose bowels in summer . 
 You ’ Ve got to be careful on the food you eat . 
 Hi Mary , how's it going ? 
 Terrible . It must be something serious . You two are such close friends . 
 Really ? What happened ? 
 That's pretty harsh . 
 You know she probably feels just as bad . 
 Well , in that case I guess maybe you can be more understanding . You shouldn't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . After all you can go to the beach anytime you want . 
 I can't bear you anymore . I am sick of your drinking . I am divorcing you . 
 How many chances should I give you ? I've given up on you ! 
 Finally the class is over . Be quick . Ben must have been waiting for long . 
 That's normal . You have been sitting for three hours , with your attention highly concentrated . 
 No . You are just burning yourself out these days . Have a good rest and you will feel energetic again . 
 How could he make such a silly mistake ? 
 He lost a very good chance to go to college , didn't he ? 
 That's a very good lesson . We must familiarize ourselves with the exam from now on . 
 I went a global warming rally . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment . 
 It might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening . 
 Well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start . 
 If you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy . 
 Yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center . 
 I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone . 
 To be honest , in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place , we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment . 
 Merry Christmas . Steven ! 
 I'll have supper with my girlfriend and go shopping . What about you ? 
 I'd love to . But I am going to meet my girlfriend right now . See you later . 
 So Emily , what do you like to do for fun ? 
 I also like going to the movies . 
 Who broke the glass , Peter ? 
 I was not born yesterday . It must be either you or Adam . 
 Can you read what this says ? 
 Don't dis my hair ! I like it like this . 
 Hey , that's enough about my hair . 
 I don't go to hairdressers because they're cute . 
 Hello , Tony . Fancy meeting you here . How are things going with you ? 
 Pretty good ! How are your parents these days ? 
 Oh , good . That's nice to hear . Well , I am going to a football match . I need to go . 
 Thanks , I will , byebye ! 
 Why don't you sit in the back with me ? 
 By the way , what's your last name ? I forgot what it is . 
 R-I-N ? 
 I got it . Mary Lin . 
 You ’ re ready , right ? 
 Are you ready to transfer tomorrow ? 
 You ’ re not nervous ? 
 What are you most nervous about ? 
 You shouldn ’ t be nervous about that . 
 Meeting new people is a good thing . 
 What do you think of this one ? 
 And this one ? Too flashy ? 
 Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ? Isn ’ t it hideous ? 
 Are you even listening ? I ’ m trying to have a conversation with you . 
 Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon ! 
 Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals ! 
 I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game ! 
 Merry Christmas ! 
 How could I feel easy ? I ’ m really pissed . 
 Ok . I ’ ll try my best to calm down first . 
 It's something relative hackers . I often hear people talking about them , but I don't know much about them . 
 You mean a guy using enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the computer ? 
 But why are people always having such a negative attitude towards them ? 
 What is crackers then ? 
 So they are two totally different concepts . 
 I see . Then the basic different is , hackers build things , crackers break them . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 I don't have my homework today . 
 I was really sick . 
 Yes , I probably could . 
 Next class meeting . 
 That would work for me . 
 What are you reading about in that science magazine ? 
 I ’ m not sure I like the idea of that . I don ’ t want people copying me or other people . It could be very confusing . 
 In the future , that could be possible . 
 Really ? What else have you discovered ? 
 That ’ s great , because it uses natural materials rather than ones that scientists make themselves . I prefer natural remedies to man-made ones . 
 Are you OK ? I didn't mean to put you in danger . 
 That takes talent ... 
 He said you obviously prefer Greek comedies to Greek tragedies . 
 Did you enjoy it ? 
 Why ! what happened ? 
 So how long did you stay ? 
 What is the most unexpected thing you experienced in space ? 
 When viewing the Earth from space , do you feel detached from humanity or more a part of the totality of humankind ? 
 There're a lot of suspicions that the International Space Station is never going to become reality . Is it going to be some future project that never happens ? 
 There were a lot of talks during the Bush administration about a not too distant future Mars mission . It seemed to fizzle out . Do you think that this Shuttle mission will reignite the public's passion for space and get us to Mars sooner ? 
 You had gone to the moon twice , orbited space around the Earth lots of times , and of course you have had the most amazing views that a human being can have . How long do we ordinary beings have to wait to feel the weightlessness ? I just can't wait . 
 Where did you go yesterday ? 
 How often do you play tennis ? 
 I seldom play tennis . I prefer football and basketball . 
 I usually play with my schoolmates . 
 Yes , I went to the Than He Sports Center for a football match last Sunday . 
 Where is your native place ? 
 So are you a local ? 
 What ’ re you doing now ? 
 You ’ re supposed to clean your teeth before you go to bed . 
 And don ’ t ever forget it . 
 Well , I came to talk to you because I want to apply for a scholarship . 
 Thanks . I really appreciate it.In fact , I do need a letter of recommendation for this scholarship . 
 It's an undergraduate scholarship offered by the American Minority Students Scholarship Association . I'm eligible for it because I'm Asian American . 
 I'm a junior now , and my GPA is 3.92 . 
 Well , I hope so . The competition is probably pretty heavy.And they want a writing sample too . 
 No , they want a special essay . I must write an essay on a particular question they pose . 
 They give applicants a topic.The topic is , The Place of Ethnic Minorities in a Democratic Society.My essay must be three pages typed and double-spaced . 
 Yes , but I need to write it by next week . 
 I came here today to talk to you because ... Well , I need to ask two favors . 
 First , I need a letter of recommendation . 
 And second ... Well , I'm not sure if it's normal . 
 Yes , if you could . I mean , if you could read it to make sure there are no mistakes.Or maybe you'd have some suggestions . 
 I will . I want to write the first draft tonight.So I could bring it tomorrow morning . 
 That would really help me a lot . I'm very grateful . 
 Did you hear how cold it got last night ? 
 It was so cold this morning . I could hardly start my car . 
 Don't you have a garage ? 
 How much antifreeze did you put in your new car then ? You must have to keep it well below zero . 
 Does it ever get that cold on here ? 
 Speaking of cold , how about going for a cup of coffee to warm up . 
 I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me . 
 I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done . 
 What's the matter with you , Paul ? 
 Looks like it.You need to drink a lot of water and take a good rest . 
 You look pale today . 
 You should do sports to keep young . 
 Steven , have you any friend in London ? 
 Are you close ? 
 I'm going to London on business next week . But I know nothing about it . 
 Yes , Steven . You always know what I want . 
 Thank you ! 
 I'm quite out of thoughts recently . 
 I'm worrying about my exam . 
 Excuse me , you look familiar . Did you use to live in New York ? 
 Did you use to work at NYU ? 
 Oh , did you know Hugh Young ? He was a music student . 
 Yes . And he used to play the piano with a jazz group at the university . 
 Yes , he ’ s a millionaire in Houston now . 
 Oh , no . He ’ s an executive for a large computer company . I saw an interview with him on TV yesterday . They were asking his opinion about future uses for computers . 
 You look so happy , Anna . Any good news ? 
 Really ? Congratulations ! 
 By the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? Tomorrow is my birthday . 
 Not so soon . It ’ s not my birthday today . Well , you ’ ll come , won ’ t you ? 
 My pleasure . 
 Hello sir . Good to meet you , too . 
 Ok , Jason . So how was the flight ? 
 Really ? But you were in first class ! Nobody woke that guy up ? 
 That's terrible ! So you didn't get any sleep ? 
 So , aside from visiting our factory and offices , are there any other things you want to accomplish while you're in China ? 
 That's not a problem . We can have a company car take you there . It's only about a two hour drive . 
 I'm going to stay in the city . 
 I'm going to work with my father at the store . In the evening , I'll read books.On weekends , I'll go to the beach with my family . 
 No , but I can learn . What are you going to do this summer ? 
 I've never gone to camp . What do you do there ? 
 That sounds wonderful . 
 I think he's going to the mountains with his parents . 
 You too , Peter . Give my regards to John . I'll see you in September . 
 It's love all . 
 Can you tell which team seems to win ? 
 Yes.Our guest team is really tough . 
 Maybe you'll get another chance at the statue . 
 And let them ruin my life ? Forget it ! 
 It's not worth it . Besides , I have to save up to pay for some bills . 
 Yeah . Well , I'll see you this weekend . 
 Of course . I often go to the movies . 
 I heard it ’ s a very good movie . 
 Let ’ s look at the newspaper . 
 Wonderful . I ’ m so excited . 
 Most of them are not so practical . It will be very bad for your health if you skip lunches or supers as the recommended . I think making an exercise plan can be more effective . 
 You don ’ t need to lose weight , you are not fat . 
 I visited the Polar Aquarium today . 
 Almost . There are a lot of polar animals sea birds , such as seals , whales and penguins , People don't get much chance of seeing them . 
 Absolutely . To be frank , I learned quite a lot about those animals and polar areas . I'm thinking of my kids there one of these days . 
 How time flies ! 
 I can still remember our first date . 
 Yeah , oh my god ! It's still there . We have our first date right on there . 
 You were dull at that time . 
 I can't believe this for it's been 20 years since we got married . 
 And then what ? 
 That sounds boring to me . 
 Yes , I think I will do something new . I ’ Ve always wanted to be a teacher . 
 Let's get together this weekend , is that all right ? 
 When is it convenient for you ? 
 Could you and your wife be ready at nine o'clock ? 
 Never mind . I'll be waiting for you . 
 OK . Bye ! 
 Ask me a question ? What do you want to know ? 
 Just what ? Stop beating around the bush . Tell me what you want to know . 
 Lend you a few bucks ? No way ! Still remember the money you borrowed me last time ? 
 Hey , Mary , nice to see you again . I heard you're going back home to the U . S . 
 You're so thoughtful . Wish you a good trip home . And we'll miss you . 
 Lovely day , isn't it ? 
 You are not English , are you ? 
 Good afternoon , would you mind if I sat here ? 
 I ’ m Jack . What ’ s your name ? 
 Do you like this place ? 
 How often ? 
 Who ’ s that ? 
 Do you like swimming ? 
 What ’ s the area of your country ? 
 That sounds quite big ! How many people live there ? 
 What ’ s the average income ? 
 So your country is fairly rich . 
 Unemployment in my country is a fraction of that . 
 I ’ Ve often wondered the same thing . I also wonder who reads them . Then I realize that I ’ m standing here reading them myself . 
 I think we picked the right line . This one seems to be moving more quickly than the others . 
 I ’ m glad . We have only about twenty things here , and I ’ m in a hurry to get home . 
 I really want to take him over my knee . 
 If you say so ! 
 Hi , Mary , Hi , Ken I hate to bring this up , but that new stereo , system you got ... 
 You were playing it very late last night . 
 It kept me awake . 
 It kept me awake a couple of hours . 
 It was that loud , and it was pretty late , and check with Mary if you don't believe me . 
 I'm very sorry . I didn't realize it . I promise I'll keep it down in the future . 
 I am glad we've straightened everything out . 
 What do you mean by that ? 
 Mothers like that . 
 I'm at home painting . 
 I enjoy oil painting . I learned it in one of my extra classes in college . 
 Hobbies are never too late to learn . They offer a variety of classes at the local community college . You should look into it . 
 What does your friend Jim do ? 
 He can repair cares ? I cannot believe it . 
 Hey Jane . How are you doing these days ? 
 Are you enjoying married life ? 
 You're so lucky . I hope to get married to a guy like that . 
 Do you guys do anything special ? 
 Sound like everything is great . 
 I am not in the mood . 
 I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . It's a real letdown . 
 But she did and it made me disappointed . 
 But she means a lot to me . 
 Oh , I just can't forget it . 
 Oh , what does he look like ? Is he tall ? 
 I can tell it from your build . 
 Really ? It was on in 1994 for the first time . And it is really a classic . 
 I am also impressed with the lines in the movie . 
 That's my favorite . 
 It deserves . That film can give us a lot of inspiration . 
 All in all , it will never lose its appeal . 
 Sure . Now you are talking . 
 When I was a kid , there was a weather who said there is no such thing as bad weather . 
 He said there are only all kinds of good weather . 
 Well , for one , we have an excuse to stay home . 
 I know that there is hot chocolate in the kitchen and some new Cds just waiting for us . 
 It's Monday , October 27 . Speaking of dates , when are you leaving ? 
 Isn't it a Sunday ? 
 So you are leaving two weeks from now ? 
 What are you reading ? 
 I thought he usually wrote horror books . 
 We ’ re going to the bookshop . Would you like to join us ? 
 Me too . I need something to read on the flight to new york . I can never sleep on planes . Sarah wants to pick up some children ’ s books for her daughter . 
 This is sure to be a worthwhile read . 
 Sure . 
 BBS means Bulletin Board Service . 
 A lot of things ! 
 Okay . BBS , an online service , offers a wide variety of online games , files , one-on-one chat , message areas , private mail , and participate forums . 
 Why not ? 
 Not really , do you ? 
 Take it easy . It is all over now . How was it going , anyway ? 
 That's strange . But probably , it is the new interview technique they call it ' Getting to know you more personally ' . What about your answers ? 
 How may I help you ? 
 What happened to this one ? 
 You ’ re going to need to pay for the damage . 
 It ’ s going to be $ 5 . 
 It really isn ’ t . 
 Thank you very much . 
 When it comes to select a fund , you will always read “ Past performance is not an indication of future results ” , can you believe that ? 
 But I still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance . For me , his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy . I really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns . 
 I will think about it . 
 He appeals to the fans thanks to two things 
 Certainly not . What really counts is to play as a team , passing the ball amongst each other , dodging defenders . Free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts.However , a few free kicks often make everything different , especially scoring one such goal in the nick of time . 
 Yes , his face looks are manly , with a straight nose and infinite eyes . As a man of medium height in the West , he keeps a powerful but elegant figure , looking neither lanky nor stout . 
 Can you tell which team seems to win ? 
 Yes . Our guest team is really tough . 
 May I have a word with you ? 
 When will you be free ? 
 Shall I say around ten o'clock ? 
 Office software like Windows might be one of the best inventions in this information age . It saves us from so much work and makes the communication even around the world much easier . 
 Yes , this machine is even smaller than those before . 
 You know our boss always trying to save the last penny . We have to use up the equipment first . 
 Thank you . I am very excited . 
 I am very happy , too . It was a big game and I won . 
 It was really an exciting moment . 
 That may be so , but reading them is an important way to expand your knowledge . 
 I'm fine , Katherine . I just stayed up late last night working on my Chinese . 
 You did ? Do tell me . I've spent all these months trying to learn something new about it , but I've made little progress ! 
 So you're learning Chinese songs ? 
 That's a real achievement . How did you do that ? 
 It makes sense . 
 Can Join you , Katherine ? I do want to have a try . 
 Great . Do you think we need a Chinese dictionary ? 
 Ok . I will bring it with me . 
 Hi ! Crenshaw and Hawthorne , at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner . 
 From China . 
 It ’ s fine . I am actually from Mexico . I was in China on a business trip , visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products . 
 Don ’ t you know it ’ s rude to ask a lady her age ? 
 Well thank you ! In that case , I am 26 years old , and what about yourself ? 
 Really ? That ’ s great ! Do you speak some Spanish ? 
 Que bien ! Sentences poems habeas en espanol ! 
 That ’ s all right . I understand . 
 That ’ s ok . Don ’ t be sorry . We ’ ll talk later . 
 We ’ Ve thought about it , but my husband and I can ’ t afford it right now . The only thing we could afford would be living in the slums , which is something I don ’ t want to do . 
 Like what ? 
 That ’ s a good idea . Do you know anyone who has done that before ? 
 Is the house pretty run-down . 
 Was it a very old house ? 
 Is it in a good location ? 
 Do Mona and Jim need a new house ? 
 Does Jim make a lot of money ? 
 Does Jim need to make more money ? 
 What do they need all that money for ? 
 Do they have any children ? 
 What does Jim like to do ? 
 What does Mona like to do ? 
 Wow ... She sounds like a high maintenance wife . 
 Politics can be an expensive hobby . 
 Politics is a hard game to play . 
 Are you alright , child ? 
 What did the nurse say ? 
 In that case , you should go home and get plenty of rest . 
 Then I'll phone our family physician and make an appointment for you . 
 That would have to be Miss Baymler , my fourth grade teacher . 
 She was patient , kind , fun , smart , caring , and yet strict , too . I really learned a lot from her . 
 She taught us that you can do anything that you want to do . 
 If you really want to do something and you work hard at it , I believe you can do it . 
 She had some rules that helped us to feel comfortable . For example , the students had to treat each other with respect , or they would be disciplined . 
 Yes . She treated us all fairly . She don ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets . 
 Well . To be honest , I usually sucked up to teachers because I wanted them to give me good grades . However , Miss Baymler didn ’ t treat me any differently . She really didn ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets . 
 As a matter of fact , I do . After she taught our class , she got married and moved to another city . Then , she started writing children ’ s book . 
 Of course ! Both children and adults enjoy her books . 
 ok ! I ’ ll bring one to you next time . 
 Oh , flowers ! What for , my dear ? 
 Oh , thank you.You are so sweet ! 
 Not particularly . I was rather disappointed . 
 I ’ d expected it to be much more exciting . 
 To some extent , he is . And what do you think we move to a better place ? I can't see him clearly from here . 
 Oh , thank you for pointing that out . By the way , have you been following NBA for this season ? 
 Who plays who ? 
 It's amazing . And when did he begin to play in the NBA ? 
 I can't consider you as a little kid any more . I know he is very tall . 
 I also heard if a player has committed 5 fouls then he must be out of the game . 
 That's really terrible . Oh , God , we forgot to cheer for Daddy . 
 You are always so naughty . 
 I do not know what I could imagine , but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers . 
 Is that Mr . Green ? 
 I am calling to inform you that we're happy to have you with us . Welcome aboard , I'm sure your friend would have given you a lot of information of our school and its motto , ways of teaching , etc . 
 I'm so nervous about this oral test . 
 I just want to get it over with . 
 Oh , I ’ m not . I ’ Ve never had a music class before . 
 You ’ re having me on again . 
 What ’ s the date today ? 
 Right . What present should we give him this time ? By the way , how old is he ? 
 How time flies ! He ’ s a big boy now . 
 OK . Let ’ s invite all their little friends to come and celebrate . 
 Are you serious ? 
 I did , too.Come and visit us again , will you ? 
 Do you know Sally ? 
 Why is she still single ? She must have a face that would stop a clock . 
 Do you hear what happened to Sally ? 
 She had to go to the hospital . 
 She passed out in class . Seems she hadn't eaten anything in days . 
 Yeah , but that's what she did . 
 Well , it's not just the girl ’ s fault . It's also society's fault - magazines and ads that show - thin models all saying , It's in to be thin . It's hard for them not to listen . 
 Have you ever thought about Tom ’ s attitude ? 
 Love me , love my dog . He ’ s a sensible kind man . 
 Have you found another job yet , Sally ? 
 What kind of job are you looking for ? 
 You haven't had any experience in either of those fields . 
 Hi . Are you new in this class ? 
 My name is Steven . What's your name ? 
 Very well . And my favorite subject is Chinese . 
 I guess English has fewer characters . 
 Robert , this is my friend , Mrs . Smith . 
 Nice to meet you too . 
 I'm a doctor . 
 New York University hospital in New York City . What do you do ? 
 What do you teach ? 
 Where ? 
 That's nice . How old are you ? 
 Hah ! For three hours while you threw up . And Femi dumped me for that . I really loved her . 
 She probably wouldn't even recognize me . She's probably married . 
 Was she really ? So you're telling me there's a chance ? 
 Oh , Ralph , I heard it is very dangerous traveling in space . Disasters have happened before . If the spaceship were out of order . . . 
 But is it possible that travelers could be hit by meteors ? 
 What do you think is the real danger man faced in space ? 
 Hi , Mark , did you catch the game last night ? 
 You didn ’ t hear ? Spain won , two to zero . 
 Yeah . The final is next week . You have to watch it . 
 Cool down , man . Everyone is fed up with the rush-hour traffic . But life isn't really all that . You should take the initiative and make some changes first . 
 I recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus . It may offer you many benefits . First , it's good for your health . I'm afraid it's not necessary for me to further elaborate . While lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising , a bike ride to work not only builds you up , but also makes full use of time . You might as well sleep out for a longer hour . 
 Well , such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like Beijing . I think a still more desirable benefit is psychological . Bicycling home after work can help release your stress . Life in the offices is miserable . You just sit there in a daze , gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents . Why don't you give a full play to your energy after work ? Enjoy the speed on the road . Just think , you are flashing past the poles with your own energy . How great ! 
 Five . Besides my parents and me , there are my brother and sister . 
 Eighteen . 
 She ’ s not quite twenty-five . 
 Yes . 
 No . But I often send e-mail to them . And make a call to my parents regularly . 
 Once a week . 
 Calm down ! 
 Actually , I don't like history . Lately , these shows are always about the Pyramids . 
 And nobody knows who built them , right ? It's a total mystery ! 
 What's the problem , Nada ? You look down in the dumps . 
 Come on , nothing can be that bad . 
 Ok , I promise . So what's troubling you so much ? 
 Really ? Is he married ? 
 Then what's your problem ? 
 Oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip . 
 Office romance is very tricky . 
 Cheer up , Nada . You'll be fine . 
 I want to return this video . 
 I also need to check these books out . 
 That ’ s everything . 
 I have it . Here you go . 
 That ’ s everything . 
 Thank you . Good night . 
 I did . Let me go get it for you . Here you go . 
 I like the way that the gifts I get increasingly more lavish . 
 So what does it say you should give your wife this first anniversary ? 
 I can think of two things made of paper — stationery and money . 
 But you promised to play chess with me this afternoon . 
 So what ? 
 I don't care about baseball.You know I need to practice for the chess championship and you promised to help with me if I washed the dishes for you last Sunday , and I did . 
 When ? 
 And then , it'll be dinner time , then homework , and then your Show is on.You are going to break your promise . 
 Well , I'd rather do it the way we set up.But if you promise to give me your best game , it's ok with me . 
 What stresses you out the most ? 
 How so ? 
 You have to deal with a lot of pressure from your parents . 
 Ever since I brought home some bad grades in elementary school , they never expected much . 
 What do you do to deal with the stress ? 
 That sucks . You wanna go grab a beer ? 
 Tony looks very handsome in the suit . 
 Judge from his look , he's a very serious person . 
 Lily thinks that the job takes a back seat to the family after she is married . 
 Not necessarily . This is only what she says , not what she does . 
 What's the weather like ? 
 Why don't you look outside ? 
 Why do you say that ? 
 Is it raining right now ? 
 How do you know ? 
 I have to go shopping today . 
 Hey there , you look a little lost . Are you new here ? 
 You can always spot the newbies . I can give you a few pointers if you want . Were you trying to use this machine here ? 
 It ’ s ok , I know how it is . This machine here will work out your upper body , mainly your triceps and biceps . Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition ? 
 In that case you want to work with less weight . You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . Five kilo weights should be enough . Now it ’ s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle . 
 It ’ s not that much . Just watch ... I ’ m ok ... 
 He's out of John's hands . Nothing he can do about such a black sheep . 
 Do you like ice skating ? 
 Then you've got to try it . Let's go to the skating rink on Thursday . 
 Friday then . How about it ? 
 It's settled then . 
 Yes , I am sorry . I missed the bus . 
 Well , I missed several buses . 
 I , ah ... , I got have late . 
 Well , I ... I lost my wallet , and I ... 
 Yes , I found it again . 
 This morning . I mean ... 
 Let's have seafood tonight and then go see the new movie at Mall Cinema.Betsy told me it's a beautiful love story and I shouldn't miss it . 
 No , we didn't . Last week we went to see that movie about a man's struggle against mental illness . 
 Oh , yeah , and I did promise to see it with you if we went to that movie last week.But you liked that movie , didn't you ? 
 It wasn't that bad , and you're the one that insisted on skipping dinner.We went to an excellent restaurant . 
 And I don't like meat that much.The only meat I eat is chicken . 
 Well , I suppose that , to be fair , you should get to pick the movie and we can go to a restaurant that serves meat . 
 How's your new job going ? 
 How are you finding your new boss ? 
 Would you rather have her or your old boss back ? 
 How about your new co-workers ? 
 Do you miss your old co-workers ? 
 Do people in different departments get along with each other ? 
 Do you like working in teams with people from different departments ? 
 Do you like working in teams ? 
 Linda , John and I are going to get married next week . 
 Thank you , Linda . We would love you to come to our wedding . 
 It's May 1st . 
 It's Saturday . Could you make the time ? 
 At nine sharp . 
 Thanks . 
 Sure , I ’ ll catch the train . If I can ’ t catch the train , I ’ ll get a taxi . 
 If he doesn ’ t understand me , I ’ ll show him the office address on my business card . 
 I ’ ll call you if I ’ m delayed . 
 Yes . 
 Yes , I'm used to being on my own . 
 He prefers suits to jackets . 
 As a matter of fact , he is . 
 Nice to meet you , Andrew . I am Noirin , Noirin O'Neil . 
 Noirin , N-O-I-R-I-N , it's an Irish name . 
 The train station is indeed crowded . I think it ’ s hard for us to get on the train . 
 yes . I bought a scarf yesterday . It's really nice and warm . Have a look . 
 yes , I adore simple fashions . How does it look on me ? 
 how about this blue sweater ? 
 yes , but I bought it when it was on sale , 50 % off the original price . OK , what do you think ? 
 I've got a pair of pearl earrings . Here it is . 
 you have good fashion sense , Karen . 
 yes , but with our sense we'll always look good . 
 Well , I ’ Ve got some papers due . 
 Not too good yet . Better than I was though . 
 Hello , Brian . 
 Hello , Bob . 
 Depends . 
 Wow ! Besides The Cosby Show , I've never seen a black sitcom . What's this program ? 
 This show is like a black Friends . 
 That's cool . I've heard LA has an all-Asian channel on cable . 
 He isn't a man of good taste for clothes , is he ? 
 It must be hard being a father . 
 Maybe you'll only feel that way on Father's Day . 
 Yes , I should get there just in time for the women ’ s 400m relay . 
 Yes , I ’ m also going to watch the triple jump and the high jump . 
 Ok , I ’ ll try my best . 
 I went to play tennis in the public park . 
 Twice a week . How about you ? 
 But it is very difficult to gather a team of players together . 
 Do you like watching football matches ? 
 ... And now , let ’ s go to Kenny Williams for today ’ s weather forecast . 
 What ’ s the weather looking like today , Kenny ? 
 It ’ s a chilly day folks , so don ’ t forget your coats ! What about tomorrow Kenny ? Do you have good news for us ? 
 You heard it folks ! It ’ s gonna be a cold one ! 
 He's been compared to Rimbaud , you know . 
 No , you idiot . I mean the poet , Arthur Rimbaud - R , I , M , B , A , U , D . 
 What's wrong , Julia ? 
 Don't give up so soon . 
 Mistakes are just a lessons to learn from . 
 Do you know Abraham Lincoln ? 
 He grew up poor in Kentucky and barely had a year of schooling , but he went on to become the President of United States . 
 He is known as American's greatest president . Do you know why ? Because he fought against slavery and secession at a time in history where others were too afraid to do anything . He succeeded because of his ambition and generous spirit . 
 That's the spirit . Never give up on your dream . 
 I ’ m afraid that ’ s not my cup of tea . I just find skin-diving attracting . 
 Hello ! 
 Please allow me to introduce myself . My name is Tom . 
 Yes , I did . Have you lived here long ? 
 No , not really . When I left Vietnam , I came to America and I lived with a cousin in Dallas for two years . Where do you work , Alice ? 
 I am an accountant at a company . 
 It's nice meeting you too , Alice . 
 Goodbye , Alice . 
 Sure , let me give you an application . You can fill it out right here at the counter . 
 Let me take a look at this for you . May I have your driver's license , please ? 
 You seem to have filled the form out all right . Are you familiar with our rules and fines ? 
 The hours and limitations are printed on the card and this handout . 
 Thank you for joining the library ; we look forward to serving you . 
 Yeah , Judy . I will be working for the Post Office . It ’ s not a bad job . 
 That ’ s right . I report to work at 5am everyday , and I only get 45 minutes for lunch . 
 Well , the government offers its employees excellent health insurance benefits . 
 Yeah , that ’ s the best part . All of my children can get free medical care . 
 Now you know why I wanted to work for the Post Office ! 
 Oh , thank God . We all felt frightened by the bad new about him . 
 Right . Unless , who know what will happen . 
 Harry , do you like the opera ? 
 Why is that ? It is called real art . 
 Yeah , that makes sense . 
 Really ? That's really wonderful . I'm so happy for her . 
 Honey , cheer up . 
 I'm sure you'll do fine if you try your best . 
 Be confident , and never give up . 
 Keep your chin up . Remember ? Nothing is impossible to a willing heart . 
 how did you do on your BELTS exam ? 
 that's excellent ! Have you received your conditional offers yet ? 
 do you know where the visa office is ? 
 it's just near the Dong Si Shi Tiao subway stop . 
 have you ever gone abroad before ? 
 have you ever been denied a visa before ? 
 that's good . Are you planning on immigrating to another country ? 
 that's exactly what the visa officers want to hear . Do you have enough money for tuition and room and board ? 
 I think you have a very good chance of getting a visa . I can help you prepare for the visa interview if you want . 
 Hi there , I'm Steve Saunders.What ' s your name ? 
 Yes it is , better than I expected it would be.The presenters have been first rate.Is this the first conference you've been to ? 
 I'm from Long Island , New York.What about yourself ? 
 Wow . I really like California ... the weather there is much better than the East Coast . 
 Just once.Quite a few years ago we took the kids to Disneyland on our vacation.They had a blast . 
 Two , a boy and a girl.They ’ re already grown now . 
 I dislike Susan . She is always above herself . 
 What of it ? 
 Does it bother you that your husband goes away on long business trips ? 
 What can I do for you ? 
 Let me have them . 
 These books are two weeks late . 
 You ’ re going to have to pay late fees . 
 25 cents a day . 
 That means 25 cents for each late book . 
 I hear you're entering the speech contest , Mike . 
 Well , I wish you good luck ! 
 How about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym . 
 Me , too . What did you have in mind ? 
 I agree . They're very lovely , especially Huanhuan 
 The five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive . 
 I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now . 
 There are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts . 
 It is time to butter him up . 
 I don ’ t know . Let me see . 
 Cindy , I heard you got into that university . Congratulations ! 
 Hello ? 
 Are you there yet ? 
 I just got off the subway . I'm almost there . Sorry I'm late . 
 Where are you ? 
 Should I come to the second floor or do you want to come to the first floor ? 
 What ? 
 Oh , OK . What are you doing there ? 
 Do you want to get something to eat later ? 
 What do you want to do ? 
 OK , see you soon . 
 Who's that old lady trimming the trees ? 
 She looks very healthy.How old is she ? 
 What do you think are the main causes of war today ? 
 It seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country . 
 How do you think they could be ended ? 
 So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer . If the problem is resources , share them . 
 Yes . It is . One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive . 
 Are you feeling better today , Bill ? 
 You'd better give up smoking . It's bad for your health . 
 But you should make up your mind first . 
 Why don't you go to bed and get up early ? You'll have the same time for work . 
 Well , I must be off now . I have an appointment at six . 
 Ok . Goodbye . 
 Hello , Julia , I know a party that will begin at midnight . Would you love to go ? 
 What a pity ! The party is very interesting . 
 Don ’ t complain about it . She is concerned about your safety . 
 Steven , why are you so depressed ? 
 What's the news ? 
 It's horrible . 
 Yes . How about donating some money ? 
 Just find the answer through Internet . 
 I don ’ t know how to deal with Jack . He is indeed a trouble maker . He has louse up my business several times . 
 Yeah . 
 Who's that over here ? 
 What do you think of the teacher ? 
 What does she teach ? 
 Is she your teacher ? 
 Can she speak Chinese to her students ? 
 It's a good thing you can speak English ! 
 Haven ’ t you heard ? Richard was fired by our manager . 
 Believe it or not . Everybody is talking about it in the company . 
 Me too . 
 We are not seeing each other any more . 
 Yeah . I got sick and tired of her nagging all the time . 
 I don't know . There ’ s plenty of fish out there in the sea ! 
 They're very good friends , aren't they ? 
 Oh , it's unbelievable ! 
 I didn't know about it . What did you do ? 
 You were really lucky . 
 I hope I can go to your party . 
 After going through an episode like that I'm not surprised . How's her headspace ? 
 I'm proud of you for standing by her . I think you've helped make a big difference in her life . 
 No , why ? 
 She doesn't need to do that , I didn't do anything . 
 Hey , Tom , what to go for a run ? 
 I try to do that , but I can ’ t get up early enough . 
 It ’ s so hot at lunchtime ; I ’ d rather run in the morning . 
 I could try , but I can ’ t say for sure if I ’ ll get up in time . What time do you want to go ? 
 O . K . , maybe if I have someone to go with , I ’ ll be able to get up in time for a jog . 
 See you . 
 It's cloudy . 
 I doubt it . 
 Well , the way you drive , Jen ... I still don't think that's a good idea . 
 I know . It's a mix of all the latest songs . 
 No . I recorded these from your Cds . 
 I knew I shouldn't have shown you my new toy ... 
 Well , Mary types faster than Jones . But I think Jones types more carefully . 
 Jones can certainly take down letter more quickly , but Mary ’ s short hand is the best in her class . 
 Both of them speak excellent French . But I think Mary speaks German more fluently than Jones does . 
 My friend George has been to Switzerland twice . 
 Yes , he likes the people and the quietness there . 
 Hello , Ann ! Is that you ? 
 It's been a long time ! What's new ? 
 Not bad I guess . I just got back from Hawaii . 
 I had a good time . You seem to be in a hurry . Don't let me hold you up . 
 Ok , I won't keep you then . 
 Yes , stay in touch . Bye ! 
 Sure ! It's txyb@gmail.com . 
 Carrie , are you ok ? You seem a bit down . 
 Maybe it ’ s just that he is stressed out from work or something . He does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know . 
 Men are like that you know.They can feel nervous , anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness . 
 Talk to him , try to cheer him up when he is down and if that doesn ’ t work , I say get rid of him and get a new one ! 
 Hi , my name ’ s Karl . My wife and I are moving in next door . 
 I ’ m happy to meet you . It seems everyone in town is so friendly . 
 Well , I ’ m from Chicago . There few people take the time to get to know their neighbors . 
 We wanted to live in a more peaceful community and have more space . Another reason is , we can afford to buy a home here , but we can ’ t in Chicago ! 
 So what ? 
 Not really . I couldn ’ t careless about the Olympic Games . 
 The question is easy for everybody.Don ' t you think so ? 
 Why do you say so ? 
 I can ’ t believe it ! 
 Yes , but I bet $ 200 dollars on the Cougars ! 
 I can ’ t believe it ! I thought the Cougars were going to win for sure . 
 20 to 1 , in favour of the Cougars ! 
 Jenny , I was wondering ... if you .. eh are you busy this Friday ? 
 Oh , what about Saturday ? Are you free then ? 
 What about tonight ? Do you have plans tonight ? 
 Yes , yes , I want to take you to dinner . 
 Excuse me ? Is this where I register ? I ’ d like to sign up for my courses for next semester . 
 Here you are . 
 Yes . I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology . 
 Yeah . Here ’ s my list . I ’ m not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them though . 
 Oh yeah ! Almost forgot ! I need to take fundamental linguistics , consumer psychology and neuroanatomy . 
 Is your city a historical place ? 
 How did it grow into such a large place ? 
 As the city grew , it must have absorbed many village nearby . 
 I see . Are there any building more than 200 years old in your city ? 
 Really ? So your city does have some old history after all . 
 Two . French and Spanish . 
 Well , French was my best subject at school . I can read and write it pretty well . 
 Well , it's not as good as my French . I can speak it reasonably well , but my written Spanish isn't very good . 
 In that case , I'm fit for the position I think . 
 Yes , of course . And I'm amazed the those karate and judo boys were so helpless before the wrestlers . 
 Do you mind if I get a lift in your car , please ? 
 Oh you ’ re so kind ! 
 Fred , can you tell me how I can open my QQ Zone ? 
 Well , I have to provide some of my information , right ? 
 All information is filled in and now I can design my zone . 
 Now everything is OK . I can write my blog , right ? 
 ( Half an hour , Janice begins shouting excitedly . ) What's the matter with you ? 
 Do you remember Tina , my good friend ? 
 She just broke up with her boyfriend . 
 But the problem is she and her ex-boyfriend are working in the same department . It is somehow embarrassing for them to see each other everyday . 
 Well , Tina says she would be able to handle it and concentrate on her own work , easier set them done . But working harder and concentrating only on the job might well helped to overcome the initial stress of the breakup . 
 Oh where was that ? 
 Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy . She is always making us kids eat the proper foods . 
 She will be 86 next month . 
 What time shall I pick you up ? 
 That'll be fine . See you soon . 
 You know what , I've just got a new job with a computer company . 
 Hi , Linda . I haven't seen you for ages . 
 So do I . 
 Yes . I graduated last year and got a job in a press . 
 No , I ‘ Ve been waiting for ages . 
 Yes , me too . I think I ’ Ve lost some important clients recently because of this train ! 
 Oh look ! Here it comes now ! 
 What's that ? 
 Don't worry about it . It's not new , it already has a few scratches . Did you get hurt ? 
 That's the most important thing . 
 Forget about it . 
 Maybe , but really I have fallen a couple of times and it's been hit once or twice as well . 
 Jenny is going to marry another man next month . 
 But , how can you be so calm . You loved her so much . 
 What's your favorite sport ? 
 Hello , Jane . What do you do in your spare time ? 
 Don't you have any hobbies , like stamp collecting or things like that ? 
 I like collecting antiques . It's expensive , but it's a lot of fun . 
 So far I have more than 500 collections . 
 A set of ancient china . It is really invaluable . 
 Yes . Speaking of digital wares , I bought a digital camera last week . 
 A Sony . It's only one third the size of my old camera and looks rather smart . 
 Superb ! It's a 4 megapixel one and the photos it takes are very vivid and clear . 
 Can you stay a little longer ? 
 Can I see your parents some time tomorrow ? 
 How about this weekend ? 
 Happy Thanksgiving ! 
 Let's have pumpkin pie . 
 Are you going anywhere for your vacation ? 
 That'll be lovely . Where are you going ? 
 Well , you've got to prepare a lot of food and enough sleeping bags then . 
 It sounds good . You can do a lot of sightseeing , too . 
 So , you're going to have a really nice vacation . 
 Would you like to book a table , sir ? 
 Sure , when ? 
 For how many guests , please ? 
 How much would you like to spend ? 
 OK . 
 Eight . 
 Sure . The main courses are roast Beijing duck and fried eel slices . 
 Did you watch TV last night , Rose ? 
 What was it about ? 
 If so , we may live there someday . 
 Sure . I heard about this on the TV . On January 3rd , 2004 , Explorer Spirit landed near the so-called Guser Crater . And three weeks later , Spirit's twin explorer , Opportunity , landed on Meridian Planum named by scientists . 
 How is your job search going , Janet ? 
 Are you serious ? You studied mathematics at college for four years , and now you have a job working with your hands ! 
 I can see that . But I didn ’ t know you had experience in that line of work . 
 Congratulations ! You do have the right attitude . 
 I'm very sorry I can't . 
 I've been snowed under with work since my boss was away on business . 
 Stop it . Teacher doesn't treat me any different than she does everyone else . 
 Hey , I worked hard on that report and I deserve the grade I got . 
 You're just jealous because you didn't do as well as you thought you did . Admit it . 
 If you think that she is not fair with your work then you should talk to her in person instead of stewing over it . 
 I don't know . I'm too excited to say a word . 
 Yes , too good to be true . 
 Yes , I see . What did you need to see me about ? 
 What's the problem ? 
 Well , I can see that's a problem . 
 Yes , I can . Would you still like to have both of these classes ? 
 Well , let me find you one of these classes on a different day . 
 I went bungee jumping yesterday . 
 Hello , Tom , are you free next Sunday ? 
 I'm going to have my first baby , so I plan to hold a baby shower next Sunday . 
 It's the tradition . But baby showers as we know them today were not common until after World Warri . 
 So you will come , won't you ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 What am I doing ? What am I doing ? Don ’ t you know what day it is ? 
 It ’ s only the day when the world ’ s biggest sporting event is kicking off . 
 The World Cup ! The first match is today ! It ’ s Mexico vs . South Africa ! It ’ s going to be a really good match ! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . I think that South Africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country , and all . 
 This is bigger than the Super Bowl , man ! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . They first start in a group stage with bigger groups , each group having 4 teams . The top 2 teams pass on to an elimination stage before going on to the quarter final sand semifinals . 
 Are you kidding ? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup ! It ’ s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! Each nation is cheering on their team , hoping they will become the next champion . So far Brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt ; they ’ re really good ! 
 Whatever dude , I ’ m going to go watch the opening match . 
 That's absolutely ridiculous ! 
 Ask John . He is sure to know about it . 
 He has a finger in the pie . 
 I just took a shot in the dark . 
 Let me see it . 
 It ’ s a letter from NYU . 
 I didn ’ t get in . 
 I ’ m not lying . 
 I had high hopes for NYU . 
 Hopefully , I ’ ll get accepted to UCLA . 
 Sure . I've reviewed all the lessons I have learned this academic year . 
 I am 100 % certain . 
 I am sure I can get a 95 this time . 
 I'm sorry . I forget all about it . 
 It's leap my mind . I really feel terrible about it . 
 I'm really sorry I let you down . I'll make it up to you somehow . 
 No , what ? 
 Oh , no . What kind of trouble ? 
 Did you hear ? The state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city ! Soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business ! 
 What are you talking about ? How does it exploit people ? 
 Geez ! Now that I think about it , maybe legalizing gambling isn ’ t such a good idea ! Although , I have been to Las Vegas , and I didn ’ t become addicted or anything like that . 
 I'm tired of you always wearing my clothing ! 
 I ’ m sure it will be wet when we arrive . 
 It will be Sunday so I expected everything will be closed . 
 But the bank should be closed so we shouldn't to be able to get any money . 
 Do you think we ’ ll need our overcoats ? 
 Why not ? 
 Is that very likely in England ? 
 Let's do something really nice for our family this Christmas . 
 I don't know yet . 
 I know what you mean . 
 Or do something that shows we have spent time thinking about them . 
 Uh ... that's Greek to me . 
 Well , mine are baggy . They're the kind of pants you can lounge around in . 
 So maybe we shouldn't go out after all . 
 Thanks . Sometimes talking with a friend is a great way to get over something . Do you mind if I vent a little bit ? 
 Great , because I am really mad at William . I mean , what kind of an idiot wouldn't be able to appreciate a smart , beautiful woman like me ? Anybody who would be friends with that guy has to be really dumb . 
 Oh right ... present company excluded , of course ! 
 What do you mean ? 
 She is really something . 
 Hi David , this is Marge . Can you meet me after work for a few minutes ? 
 That will work . 
 That will be fine . What I have to show you will only take a few minutes of your time . 
 Yes . I just need to double check a few details with you . 
 Great idea ! Peter , I could use the drink . 
 Sounds good . The food there is fantastic too . 
 Excellent ! That sounds like a plan . 
 What is it ? 
 You big scrooge ! 
 But you may have some trouble convincing the kids . 
 Now we know that they realize the real meaning of Christmas . 
 Yes . Are you in his class ? 
 He really knew his stuff , but he graded hard . Would that be OK ? 
 I didn't find it overwhelming to earn a good grade if you work at it . Can you do that ? 
 Man , this guy was so funny when he was teaching . I like that , don't you ? 
 Did you know that he is a fairly new teacher and very current in his field ? 
 We all are looking for different things in an instructor . I hope I've helped you . 
 Uh ... what game ? 
 Um ... and what sport are we talking about here ? 
 Oh ... football . Football is cool . I usually try to catch the World Cup finals . 
 Oh , I understand . I can't say I'm a big fan . I'm from China , and football doesn't have a really big following over there . 
 Yes , I think so . But to be perfectly honest , I'm not really a sports nut.When I was in high school I played on the school volleyball team . Are you a diehard football fan ? 
 It seems Americans are very passionate about sports . Is this just a part of your culture ? 
 Julia , what's the weather forecast for tomorrow ? 
 Oh ! I hate rainy days ! 
 Yes . I have to drive to Washington D . C . 
 Yeah ! But you know sometimes the weather forecast is not correct . Maybe tomorrow is a clear day . Who knows ? 
 Where would you like to have your dinner ? 
 You don't like Western food ? 
 Thanks for offering to give me a lift . I'm looking forward to this party , but I didn't want to go alone . 
 No , this is my first . Last week I went to a cookout 5 for new professors at Dean Barksdale's home . I took a taxi because I didn't want to be late . But I was the first one there . 
 You're right . The invitation said two to seven . I was there at two o'clock , but most people didn't arrive until three or four . They didn't start cooking until five o ’ clock . 
 Thanks for telling me this . 
 Why are you in such a hurry ? They said , Dinner at eight , and it's only seven-fifteen . I don't want to be the first one there again . 
 That ’ s really a let-down . 
 But that should not be the reason for you to lose heart . 
 Some people are always closing their handsets , so it's difficult to inform them . 
 Can short messages reach them ? 
 Why haven't I thought of this skill ? 
 I am informed that many people used short messages to pay a New Year call , and only on the Spring Festival it amounted to 1 billion this year , didn't it ? 
 Hey , sorry to be late . 
 My mother was ill . I had to look after her . 
 Hi ! How are you going ? 
 Not bad . How about you ? Haven't seen you for a long time . 
 Did you enjoy yourself ? 
 Thanks , I like looking at photographs . How nice ! Oh , I'm afraid I must be going now . I've got an appointment . Have a good day . 
 Goodbye . 
 Oh , don't worry . I just killed a pigeon . 
 It spoiled my painting ! 
 What's the matter ? 
 Maybe there's something wrong with the program . 
 That ’ s open secret . 
 How did you know that ? 
 Who did the stupid thing ? 
 No , I don't think you're right.Kate never does things like that.It must be a naughty boy who did it . 
 Hi Tina , It's Joe . 
 How's the weather there today ? 
 What's the temperature ? 
 Have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow ? 
 I really don't like the winter . I wish it were summer . 
 It's not too bad , but it's pretty cold here too . It was about 45 today and it rained this afternoon . I heard it's going to be a little warmer tomorrow . 
 Mike ? How can you trust him to help us ? 
 He is too unpredictable . He says anything that pops into his head . And then he forgets it all . 
 Yes , it is . Hi , Tom ! It's a real surprise to see you here . 
 Nothing much . What about you ? Is everything going well ? 
 How was it ? 
 Sorry , I've got a meeting in half an hour . 
 Great ! It's good to see you . Goodbye ! 
 Give me your email , would you ? 
 Tom , I've got good news for you . 
 Haven't you heard that your novel has won The Nobel Prize ? 
 You did a good job . I'm extremely proud of you . 
 You certainly deserve it . Let's celebrate ! 
 I don ’ t know . I didn ’ t really feel like going out . I guess I ’ m feeling a little homesick . 
 I was . It ’ s just that the holidays are coming up and I won ’ t be able to home because I can ’ t afford the airfare . I ’ m just longing for some of the comforts of home , like my mom ’ s cooking and being around my family . 
 I see what you mean , but I ’ m still bummed out . 
 You know , I could really go for that . You don ’ t mind being my wingman for tonight ? 
 Great ! I must warn you though , whatever happens , don ’ t let me go on a drinking binge . Trust me , it ’ s not a pretty picture ! 
 Which flight ? 
 How about the passengers ? 
 There are some things I miss . But I love Chinese food.And I think the people in Taiwan are really hospitable.Besides , I grew up in Los Angeles , so I'm used to living in crowded places.Why are you going to America ? 
 Why ? 
 Don't worry about it.Your sister lives there . She probably knows the places in town you shouldn't go.It ' s true there are some dangerous places in big American cities.But if your sister lives there , she must know the city pretty well already . 
 Don't believe what you see on TV . You will have a good time in New York.What things do you want to see ? 
 The museums are excellent . And the shopping ! Well ! I'm sure you'll spend a lot of money there . 
 I'm thirsty . Pull over to that store , I'll buy some drinks . 
 Oh , that's too bad , Where can you park around here ? 
 Is a shop there ? 
 Do you think I should ask Bob to help ? Will he come ? 
 That ’ s right . But I have bothered him several times . 
 Could you tell me what university you want to go to , John ? 
 What university would you enter ? 
 Oh , I forget.Sorry . 
 Did you ? And what course did you take there ? 
 I've not known.Perhaps , I've got a bad memory . 
 Terrific ! B . A . , again and again-B . A . 
 Well I wanted to go for a picnic but it rained too much . 
 I washed my car instead . 
 No I didn ’ t . I worked in the morning then I played tennis with my husband . 
 I don't know . Maybe a pair of new shoes . 
 That's a dandy idea . Thank you for reminding me . 
 Willing to help , maybe , but not as helpful as you think . 
 Last night he told the children acliff-hangerstory and both of them were scared out of sleep . 
 If she has , they must be fair-weather friends . 
 She'd better keep away from them . 
 Yeah , sure , you didn't come to class that day ? 
 Why not ? 
 Here they are . 
 Oh , no , this is the rest . 
 It's no problem at all . 
 I don't entirely agree with you . 
 Well , that's a thing . 
 He must be an experienced accountant . 
 Great minds think alike . 
 No , I didn't . 
 I'm really curious . What is it like doing housework all day for a living ? 
 I still think that it is a bitstrange that you like to do that kind of thing . Most women would rather hire a maid . 
 How Ay clients do you have already ? 
 Wow . Too bad I don't have a clue about housework . 
 Hey , check out this new game I bought today . 
 I know you love the Oscars . This game has some great questions about all types of movies . 
 Yes . In fact , one of the categories is on foreign language films . 
 The bank closes in 30 minutes and I need to cash a check . 
 Thanks . But it ’ s necessary for me to buy a TV set . 
 You can take me to the bank if you want to . 
 I am so sorry that I must be off now . My girlfriend told me I must arrive at her home in ten minutes or she will break up with me . 
 I ’ m sure that the boy will become nobody when he grows up . 
 Eat humble pie ? Impossible , I ’ Ve never been wrong in judging boys like him . 
 Yes , it's most irritating . 
 We're going to do something about it . 
 We can't put up with it any more . 
 I don't think so . 
 Why don't we call them ? 
 Jim , I heard you ’ Ve bought a new computer . 
 Your office looks different with a computer . By the way , is it difficult to use a computer ? 
 A piece of cake ? 
 When I was at school , I was quite good at track and field events . I was on the school team for the long jump , 100 and 200 meter sprints and the javelin . 
 I wish that I were good at the discus , but I could rarely throw it in the right direction ! I was awful . With the hurdles , I could never jump over them ! 
 No , I was good at the long jump . I liked the sprints best . 
 I was regional champion for the 100 and 200 meters . I usually did well in the dong jump competitions , but I couldn ’ t compete with kids from other schools in the javelin . How about you ? 
 Yes , I did , but I didn ’ t do very well . I made the final in both events , but came last . At least I made the final . I was very pleased with that . 
 Very sorry , I am occupied tonight . What about tomorrow night ? 
 7:00 in my staying hotel . 
 Do you think people still have faith in the government ? 
 Why is that ? 
 So it is no wonder people cannot keep faith with it . 
 How old is your friend and why doesn't he know how to read ? 
 Does he even know how to speak English ? 
 That was very thoughtful of you to volunteer me . 
 Oh , all right . Have him come over here for dinner . But you get to make dinner ! 
 Really , who started the argument ? 
 Did you know it takes two to tango ? 
 Yes , I'm teaching math at Lincoln High School . 
 Well , the salary is a little low , but the students are nice . How are things with you ? 
 Now that's an exciting job ! ! ! 
 Tom and Helen got married at last . 
 I was invited to attend their wedding . 
 How moving love is . 
 I'll let you break the balls this time . 
 OK . How much do you want to bet on this game ? 
 Give me a call tomorrow . 
 I really need a new pair of trousers . 
 Yes , I do . This one is very old now . 
 They ’ re not all right . They ’ re uncomfortable and they look terrible . 
 Would you mind if I ask you whether you are married or not ? 
 Do you mean you got a divorce ? 
 what did you do over the weekend ? 
 do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ? 
 like what ? 
 what else can we do to protect the environment ? 
 how about recycling ? Does that actually help ? 
 what do you think is the biggest worry for our future ? 
 I had no idea you were such as environmentalist before ! 
 What a bother having to climb storeys home every day . 
 I don't care ! 
 What do people usually do on Saint Valentine's Day ? 
 What will the girls do ? 
 Excuse me , are you Dr . Smith ? 
 I'm David , Joanna's husband . She has to be at work late today . So she asked me to pick you up here . 
 My pleasure . 
 Sure , here you go . 
 Of course . There you are . 
 Please excuse me , but I really have to be going . 
 It was nice to see you , too . And please give my regards to Mrs.Robbins . 
 Just watching some TV . 
 Not really . Just watching the sports highlight on ESPN . 
 Just killing time until I find something to do . What are you going to do ? 
 You wanna shoot some hoops ? 
 Where's your girlfriend ? I thought you were going out with her today . 
 Let's go to Starbucks and think of something to do then . 
 I only have a couple left . Why don't you pick some up on the way . 
 Aright . See you there . 
 Why tell me ? She has nothing to do with me ! 
 No , I couldn't care less ! 
 oh , don't mention it . It was terrible . 
 the food station was as crowded as usual . I waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich , and when I finally got it the chicken was underdone . 
 yes , I know . Fast food is so popular in this district . 
 anyway , how was your such , Catherine ? 
 you did ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America . 
 i guess you're right . More often than not , people go there only for convenience . The foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat . 
 you bet . Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America . 
 seriously ? 
 What's your favorite TV Program ? 
 I also like variety shows , but sometimes the host lacks a sense of humor . 
 What's up ? You look low . 
 How come ? 
 I understand that . But I think maybe it's not a date . You are taking the matter too much to heart . 
 Did you hear about car accident on Spring Road yesterday ? 
 Yes . I heard he had a few broken bones too , but that the doctors have set the fractures without any problems . 
 Yes . He was released from hospital yesterday evening . The other man could be there for weeks . 
 The hospital announced this morning that his condition is poor but stable . What does that mean ? 
 His family will be pleased to hear that . They must have been so worried . 
 Happy New Year , Steven . 
 My whole family are going to Hainan for visiting . What about you ? 
 Are you sure Lucy has it bad for you ? If she does , she will certainly bend over backwards for you . But if she doesn't , it would be a job to change her . 
 And do you really love her ? 
 A friend of mine is now in the big house . He was caught red-handed for selling cocaine . 
 He must be regretting about having done the business . 
 I met Mark yesterday . He looked blue . 
 It belongs to the past . He lost his job the other day , and he ’ s up a tree now . 
 Look , the aliens are sending a message to Mulder . This rocks ! 
 You have a pager ? ! That's a little high-tech for you , Stu . Are you sure you know how to use it ? 
 No , you don't ! It's still beeping ! Come on , hand it over and I'll turn it off for you . 
 Well , actually , I'm not free today . Do you have anything urgent ? 
 How about tomorrow instead . 
 All right . See you then . 
 Here . Are you all right ? 
 I don't have an aspirin . Perhaps you should go to a doctor . 
 Really , John . I still think you should go to a doctor . You've been sneezing ever since you entered the office this morning . Why don't you take this afternoon off ? If you don't want to see a doctor , at least you can go home and have a good rest . 
 You didn't do anything but sneeze this morning , and you can't do anything this afternoon like this . Gee ! You've got a fever . 
 Listen to me . You go home now . I will call my doctor and have him go over . Ok ? 
 I'll handle him . Now go home . I'll call you after work . 
 How about a movie on Sunday , Mum ? 
 We could find a classical one . 
 You are in love with Mary , right ? 
 I am not blind . Anyone can see that with half an eye . 
 No kidding ? 
 You can't beat that . 
 We've a country house . 
 Join us , will you ? 
 How's your work ? 
 Not bad . But we have lost a few of staff lately . 
 Because of the low salaries . 
 I don't know why . 
 May be I can have a try . But I'm on vacation now . 
 Pretty bad . I ’ Ve had a bad cold for three days and still can ’ t get rid of it . 
 No , thanks . 
 Thank you for your concern . 
 I'm not really into racecar driving . 
 Yeah , well , times change . Look at you-you're a father now . You can't say that you haven't changed . 
 I mean , I know spring training's over , but I'm just not into all that . 
 How do you feel ? 
 I can't believe it ! I lost . 
 That's not fair , you got all the easy questions . 
 I want a rematch . Let's play again . 
 do you need a hand ? 
 are you sure you don't need any help ? 
 I swear , the overhead compartments on these planes just keep getting smaller and smaller ! 
 yes . What about you ? 
 oh , I guess I'll let you through then . 
 that's alright . I notice you have a few newspapers there . Would you mind lending me one ? 
 I prefer the British paper , but I'll read whatever one you aren't going to read right away . 
 thanks a lot . That's really nice of you . Would you like a piece of gum ? 
 Are you listening to me , Dan ? 
 What did I just say ? 
 Just what I thought ! 
 Whoa , whoa , take it easy , relax . Geez , you ’ re sweating like a pig ! What ’ s going on ? 
 What are you talking about ? It wasn ’ t more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family ! 
 Let ’ s think this through . First of all , you cannot leave Amy at the altar . Not only will she be humiliated and kill you , but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams ! Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this ? Second of all , you are just getting cold feet . You know deep down inside that you want to marry her , so cut the crap and do it ! 
 Great ! Phew ! That was a close one ! You had me going there for a minute I thought I was gonna have to slap some sense into you . 
 I had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday . 
 It is a long story . Basically , she thought I had laughed at her while I didn't . 
 Yeah . It's so nice of you to comfort me . 
 That's the new teacher . 
 She's very nice . 
 English , of course . 
 Yes . She teaches our class three times a week . 
 Not very much . 
 The teacher just canceled the test . 
 Hello ? 
 Oh , hi . I was just watching TV . 
 I know . I was watching a re-run . I have nothing to do and I was bored . 
 I'd like to , but I have to meet my parents in an hour for dinner . How about tomorrow ? 
 Did you hear the weather forecast for tomorrow ? 
 That's great . We can do something outdoors then . 
 Yeah . I think there's a live outdoor concert by the river tomorrow . 
 Do you know what time it starts ? 
 Let's meet for lunch at eleven thirty and afterwards , we can head over there . 
 Would you go to the bookstore with me ? 
 Do you know Jeffery has published his second detective novel ? 
 So what are you interested in ? 
 I know that magazine . It ’ s very popular . 
 Thank you . But I ’ m not interested . 
 Not tonight . I promised to go to a concert with my sister . 
 That sounds fine . 
 I'll be there . You're still a fabulous cook , aren't you ? 
 I'm ready . I'll look forward to it all Friday ! 
 Really ? Do I look happy all the time ? 
 Oh , do you know why ? Actually , it ’ s easy . Because I always exercise . My exercise , I think , is very hard . I often feel very good after conquering these difficulties . I feel alive ! 
 Yeah , they are doing it for fun . Seldom would people like my exercise . It ’ s difficult and boring . 
 But I think Chinese students need to exercise more . Besides exercise will help them learn new things better . Don ’ t students want to have a good memory ? 
 Well , do what you like to do . It can be anything . Jogging , doing aerobics , going bicycling , and playing ping-pong . Absolutely anything . Doing three or more workouts a week is good for you . But remember to do some stretches first . 
 Which kind of sport do you like to watch ? 
 So you must like NBA game . 
 What kind of sport do you like to participate in ? 
 I prefer the indoor sports , such as bowling , badminton and squash . 
 How about playing tennis with me ? 
 Good morning , Jerry.How ' s everything ? 
 Doing anything for lunch ? 
 Excuse me . Can you tell me how to get started using these machines ? 
 Yes . 
 Nice to meet you . 
 No , I don't . So I need some help . 
 Yes , I know that.Derek just led me through the warm up in the aerobics room.So I'm ready , I think . I can start using the machines . 
 What do you mean--a membership card ? I already have one . 
 I'm ready . 
 I see . So this card helps me to keep track of my progress . 
 Alright . Great . 
 Great . Why don't we start on the machines ? 
 I'm sorry . I know there are still seven machines . But I'm exhausted . 
 What can I do though ? I don't know the proper settings for the rest of the machines . 
 Yes . I suppose it's best to stop . 
 Okay . 
 I'm just trying to complete today's crossword puzzle . Whenever I get the time , I like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper . 
 I guess you could say that . What kind of games do you like ? 
 Doesn't everyone ? Which games are those ? 
 Did you play a lot of games when you were little ? 
 Do you still like playing those games ? 
 Everyone in my family really enjoys playing card games . 
 No , I prefer to play with people I know . 
 It's a popular game with some people , but I've never played it . 
 I hate to disappoint you , but unlike what most people think , we aren't all exactly the same ! 
 Maybe he is trying to find a job . When he finds one , everything will be settled . 
 They got a divorce at last . 
 You said it . Love but on the sand will soon be on the rocks . 
 Do you like traveling , Kathy ? 
 Or getting stuck in traffic jams when you ’ re driving . 
 Can you believe that Susan got married ? 
 No . That ’ s what is surprising me . 
 He ’ s a postman . 
 What sort of things do you grow in your garden ? 
 When is your garden at its best ? 
 Good afternoon ! 
 I'm very well , thank you.How are you ? 
 Yes , it's beautiful , but it's also very hot . 
 What's the weather like in your country ? 
 Where do you live ? 
 Here.Near this school . 
 Can I give you a hand ? 
 Sure thing . I've got time . 
 My feelings exactly . 
 I couldn't agree with you more . 
 You are absolutely right . 
 That's exactly the way I feel . 
 I'm not sure.Let me have a look ... It could be a coffee grinder . 
 Yes , it must be used for grinding coffee beans . 
 We've got a new manager in our department . 
 Yes , I did . 
 Someone called Drexler . Carl Drexler . He's been with the company onlytwo years . I've been here longer . And I know more about the job , too 
 Because I'm the wrong sex , of course ! 
 Yes , that was probably it ! It isn't fair . 
 A dark suit . White shirt . A tie . Why ? 
 You mean you think I didn't get the job because I come to work in jeansand a sweater ? 
 Do you really think I should wear different clothes ? 
 Why should I wear a skirt ? Or a dress ? 
 Why should I do that ? I'm good at my job ! That's the only important thing ! 
 It's a sunny day , isn't it ? 
 My name is David . Nice to meet you , too . 
 No , I'm a Britisher . Where do you come from ? 
 Yes . What about you ? 
 Great . Maybe we can study and play games together . I think we can be good friends . 
 You keep bowling spares but no strike . 
 I don't think it was the problem with your hands , you did several excellent spares . You have no problem with your hands . 
 The problem is you are too nervous . You want to have a strike so much , so you deliver the ball too hard . And when it comes to the I second roll , there's no pressure . That's why you could bowl all those spares . 
 Nice to see you , Patrick . 
 Yeah . All of us tried our best . 
 Thanks . 
 No I'm afraid not . I'm meeting Ruth then . How about the fourteenth in the morning ? 
 What about the next day ? 
 Yes , I think I am . Let's meet for lunch at mouth restaurant . 
 That's fine . See you there ! 
 Oh , it's really a drag . 
 Hell with it ! Nobody will give it an Academy award ! 
 It's nothing . I'm just a little stressed out . 
 School . Since I was working part time , I had a difficult time keeping up with class . Now that we have exams coming up , I'm totally freaking out . 
 I hope so . I guess I won't be sleeping for the next 3 days . That's what it'll take . 
 That will be great . 
 Why do you think the new page is so much better than the old page ? I thought the old page wasn't half bad ... 
 What changes were made from the old page to the new page ? 
 Great ! 
 Are you sure ? How do you know ? 
 Well , I heard that if you drink enough beer , you can speak foreign languages better ... 
 Sure , here you are . 
 Yeah , I think the food is alright , it's not too spicy though it's a little salty for me . But you are Chinese , you should have known better . 
 Oh , I see how this food can be really hard for you . I can sympathize with that . I stayed in Sichuan for a year . The food was difficult at the beginning . Every dish was so spicy . After a while though , I got used to the taste , and now I won't consider anything a real dish if it isn't spicy . 
 I completely understand . I didn't intend on liking spicy food at first either , but when you have no other choices , you've got to adapt . 
 Exactly . 
 Thank you . And a merry Christmas to you ! 
 How long would you like to keep it ? 
 Yes , that'd be all right . 
 Yes , at first I felt very awkward . After Bill was demoted and then resigned , it was kind of like somebody died ! I mean the atmosphere in the office was like a funeral parlor or something . And then I was afraid people would look at me as a traitor for filling in his spot when the management asked me to ... 
 Thankful , no . I guess everyone understands the opportunity I had to step into a leadership role is so great for my career . I'm really moving up the ladder now that I'm considered a supervisor . After a couple weeks , it was like nothing happened . 
 Yeah , and they also take the blame , that's what happened to my old boss ... 
 Okay . Loser has to take out the trash for a month . 
 See you in the court . 
 Well , it's hard to say . I cough a lot in the evening . 
 You're right , but you know , it's hard to give up an old habit . 
 You know , I often have to work till late at night . I need something to keep me awake . 
 Thank you for your advice ! I'll try it . 
 Awesome , we went to Australia and New Zealand . 
 Well , we went bungee jumping when we were in Australia . 
 A little , but the rush was worth it . 
 We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us . 
 Yeah , It was scary , but exhilarating . 
 He asked me to beef up in the work . 
 Nothing , thanks . I am just not in the mood these days . 
 Hi , Joe . 
 It's really cold . It snowed all day and the school closed early . 
 It's 20 degrees below zero now . It was even colder this morning . 
 I was watching the news a little earlier . They said it's probably going to snow tomorrow . 
 Me too . How's the weather where you are ? 
 Mom , I just finished my paper . Can you proofread it before I hand it in ? 
 Thanks . 
 I really did ! I started thinking about what I wanted to say three weeks ago . 
 Let ’ s just hope my teacher agrees . 
 What're you going to buy ? 
 OK . 
 Huh ? 
 It is ? Oh , that's nice . 
 Actually , I'd forgotten about it . 
 Because I'm not Christian , I'm Jewish . 
 It's all right . There are so many Christians in America that everybody takes it for granted that I'm Christian . 
 Well , I'll celebrate Hanukah soon , but that's not as important to us as Christmas is to you . Mainly I'll just enjoy the holiday break . 
 Not at all . A party is a party . I'll be happy to come . 
 Don't worry . Everything will be fine . 
 Happy Halloween ! What creature are you going to dress up as ? 
 May I have a look at your costume ? 
 I like your black clothes and your fangs are cool . 
 Haha . Wish you good luck . 
 I'm tired of your cut-and-dried opinions . Who do you think you are ! 
 Why not ? 
 Yeah ? I guess so . I spent the weekend at beach . 
 Some friends of my parents live out there , and they invited me there . 
 I jogged up and down the beach and played volleyball . You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand . I couldn ’ t get through a whole game before I had to sit down . 
 I wanted to , but the water is too cold , and I just wetted in up to my knees . 
 It looks like you could use it . Don ’ t tell me you spent the weekend in the library again . 
 The brain ! 
 The heart ! 
 The stomach and intestines ! 
 Yeah ! Our kidneys , liver and bladder ! 
 So what do these organs do , teacher ? 
 It's not good for business recently . 
 Too risky anyway.It ' s necessary to look before you leap . 
 It's easy . All you have to do is to use your pieces to surround the opponent's pieces and then take over all of his territory . 
 It's easier said than done . When you actually play , it can be very frustrating . 
 Hi George ! It's good to see you ! 
 I just opened up my own business not long ago . 
 I'm a professional party planner here in the city . I do catering and all that . 
 Well , I don't know about the profit part yet . But I am really having fun ! 
 Yes . I needed a large one . Before , I had a separate refrigerator and freezer , but this has both combined into one . 
 Yes . You know I ’ Ve been cooking more kind of food recently and I needed some extra space for spices and ingredients . 
 No , I didn ’ t . I gave them a really good clean , so they just look new . The worktop was in poor condition , so I had a new one added . 
 Yes , I have . I need them to help me with these new dished I ’ m trying to make . I need a little more practice before I invite guests over . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve always likes Indian and thai food , so I ’ Ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . I ’ m pretty good at making curries now , but I still need practice at making thai food . 
 I hope you can stay for dinner . I need a guinea pig ! 
 I love it . All my life I wanted to learn to ski . Finally I took lessons last year . 
 No , quite the opposite . I thought I'd never stop falling down . Then all of a sudden I started skiing much better . 
 Every chance I get . On weekends I ski all day long . Sometimes I even ski at night . 
 Oh , yes . The ski slopes are well lit . It's really nice to ski at night . Why don't you learn to ski ? 
 Don't be so frightened . It's just a skill . 
 Zina ? Zina the Snake ? 
 Yeah ? Which one was that ? 
 Right . That one . Did it work ? 
 Yes , what can I do for you ? 
 I see . Would you like me to reschedule you for another night ? 
 Certainly . 
 That's all right . I hope we can help you at some other time . Good-bye . 
 Can I use your laptop for a while ? 
 Oh , isn't your computer Wi-Fi capable ? 
 Oh my , no internet access is killing me . 
 No , I'm not feeling myself . I just want to check my emails , visit my favorite websites and chat with my friends . 
 What does that mean ? there's nothing wrong with me . 
 That's alright . I just can't bear losing track of all the latest information . It almost drives me crazy . 
 Sally , I ’ m tired of this Western food . I really miss my mother ’ s Sichuan cooking . 
 I have tried . But Americans like butter , bread , sugar , and cream too much . 
 It ’ s interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs , do not take naps during the day , and yet they can be so heavy . 
 Tell me something about your Valentine's Day . 
 So romantic . Young people must have lot of fun . 
 What will happen to the children if you break up ? 
 Why don't you make up with John . 
 Have you ever been to Japan ? I'm going in the fall . 
 Really ? Tell me about it . What's it like ? 
 Where did you go ? 
 What did you think of Tokyo ? 
 Yeah . I've seen pictures of the crowds ! 
 And how about Kyoto ? 
 How was the weather ? 
 Sounds perfect . I can't wait ! 
 I live in Haitian District where there are lot of universities . 
 I live at No . 50 Xingu Street . 
 Maybe it was Dick . 
 Then it must be a naughty boy who did it . 
 Yes . I'd like to borrow these books . 
 Thanks . 
 What happens if I'm not finished with them in a month ? 
 OK.Thank you very much for your trouble . 
 Hi Sam , would you like to come for a curry with us next Friday ? 
 Jane , Susan , Pete and two colleagues of mine from work . 
 Susan suggested the one on Main Street . She says it is very good . 
 You know , the one just on the corner with Oxford Street . There is a large pharmacy next door . 
 Okay then . I think we will all meet outside ? 
 At 8 o'clock . I will make the reservation . 
 Did you have a part-time job when you were still in school ? 
 Yeah , I worked about twenty hours a week in a pizza restaurant . 
 It was always very busy there . 
 I stood behind the register and took pizza orders . 
 Yeah , I got to eat as much pizza as I could for free . 
 Not really . It's a dull one , and the production isn't satisfactory , either . 
 To be fair , though , both the costumes and scenery are marvelous . 
 There's many books here.What about these ? 
 Sure.But you can only keep them for a week . 
 I don ’ t know why I married him . 
 He never see eye to eye with me . 
 Why is the long face ? 
 Did you just get your review or something ? 
 That sucks . 
 Look on the bright side . At least you have a job . 
 Exactly . Instead , we should have some drinks tonight . 
 Now you're talking . 
 So why is the face tilted to the right ? 
 So it's not as convenient for left-handed people ? 
 I'm left-handed . You bought that watch so that I won't borrow it ... 
 Is there any ticket left for tonight's concert ? 
 What a shame . Will there be the same performance tomorrow evening ? 
 That's fine . I want 2 tickets . 
 Yes , he does . He of ten has had one to many . But I advised him not to drink too much , he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table . 
 Do you offer a course in business management ? 
 How many nights a week is it ? 
 And how long does the course last ? 
 When does it start ? 
 What time is the class ? 
 How much does it cost ? 
 Yes , that's all right . I want to enroll in the course . 
 Do you want me to fill it out now ? 
 How many passengers are there aboard the ship ? 
 What ’ s your schedule like this year ? 
 What ’ s your major ? 
 Oh , don ’ t you have to take that class on 18th century poetry ? It ’ s really difficult . I hear the students in that class have to write a paper 100 pages long . 
 When is it due ? 
 Remind me never to sign up for that course ! 
 Duh ! I would say yes ! Eric is the most popular kid in school ! Okay , my turn . What would you do if you won the lottery ? 
 If you buy me a ticket I will go with you for sure ! 
 Alright this is a good one . What would your mom say if you told her you are going to get married ? 
 Something wrong ? 
 What's wrong ? 
 Do you want me to take a look ? 
 Well , if you change your mind , let me know . 
 No problem . 
 Sure . I have all kinds of tools . Just ask . I ’ ll be happy to get them for you . 
 Anything for you . Seriously , I don ’ t mind helping . 
 I've been standing here since half past seven . Where on earth have you been ? 
 It's really very easy saying you're sorry . 
 Dalian is a beautiful city . Do you agree ? 
 The climate here is pleasant . 
 This city is really comfortable to living . 
 No other city can match it . It's heaven . 
 Maybe . 
 Do you know that Mary an Ben have already separated ? 
 I didn ’ t know it until yesterday . I put my foot into it , and was even stupid enough to ask when they would get married . 
 I know . He doesn ’ t like to ask anyone for help . My dad insists on paying his own bills and taking care of himself ! 
 It seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own . 
 Sometimes they are too independent . 
 I'm doing fine.Don ' t mind me.It ' s a wonderful birthday party.Everyone is enjoying himself . 
 Don't mention it . 
 Thank you . 
 What a lovely dog ! How did you know I love this ? 
 Maybe you don't believe it , but it was made by my grandmother . 
 Thank you . Please have a cup of tea . 
 How about some fish ? 
 OK , let me make a wish ... Do you want a big piece of cake ? 
 It is very kind of you . I'm so moved by you . 
 I met Amanda through a friend . 
 We started dating right away . 
 There are some seats in the rear mezzanine . 
 No , the show is almost sold out . 
 He's not doing too well . 
 About a year ago , he started feeling weak all the time . 
 Maybe a little of both . The doctor's can't point out anything specifically . I think it is because he didn't take care of himself during his youth . 
 That's what my father tells me almost everyday . 
 Thanks . I'll let him know . 
 Oh , no ... 
 Jen , is there someone you're not telling me about ? 
 Women are such dreamers . 
 Hurry up , get in . 
 OK , make a left here . . . no wait , I meant make a right . Come on , speed up ! 
 Don ’ t worry about it , just drive . Oh , no , the light is about to change . . . step on it ! 
 Whatever . Just turn right here . . . . The freeway will be packed at this hour . . . . let ’ s take a side street.Go on ! Get out of our way ! Move , move ! 
 Here , I know a short cut ... just go down here , and we ’ ll cut though Ashburn Heights . Let ’ s go , let ’ s go ! Watch out for that lady ! 
 Yes ! We made it . 5:58 , just before the library closes . 
 I've heard so much about Japan . Is it a beautiful country ? 
 Yes , I do feel the same way about France . The swift rivers , the fertile valleys , the large cities-its scenery is beautiful . Will you describe the geography of Japan ? 
 Oh , no , France isn't an island . It is located in the western part of the European continent . But France does have many fine harbors and port cities on its southern and western coasts . Does Japan have good harbors ? 
 No , France isn't very mountainous . But it does contain the Pyrenees , a large mountain range with high peaks and deep canyons . What kind of Climate does Japan have ? 
 Yes , the climate of France rarely has severe winters . In southern France , one can live in comfort the whole year . Is Japan good for farming ? 
 No , rice isn't grown in France . But farming , fishing and industry are also very important in France . I'd like to go to Japan some day . Would you like to visit France ? 
 I don't know why Mark often comes to me and asks me for advice . I smell some rat in it . 
 Nonsense ! There's no indication that he's in love with me . 
 Hi , why do you look so depressed today , Mike ? 
 How come ? 
 I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood . But why not take it easy ? 
 Maybe we'd better go now . 
 Gosh , it's already 10.Stay here if you like . 
 OK.Hurry up . 
 My condolences . 
 Why are you asking me the strange question , Jerry ? 
 Well . I think IQ matters more . But it won't work without EQ . 
 Because an intellectual mind can only be a beneficial thing in life . 
 That's why people's achievement varies greatly . 
 Yes , Jerry , can you share your understanding of EQ ? 
 Quite right . Have you noticed that a high IQ is not a must for one's success ? 
 Yes , his IQ is high enough for him to embrace the success as long as he can manage his EQ . 
 Come on ! It's time to go ! 
 Well , I've got to stop and get gas in the car , first . 
 Well , it won't if there no line at the pump . 
 I'll give you five more minutes , then I'm going on without you ! 
 Oh , yes , I would ! 
 So so . 
 Well you should have picked , in the end you always complain about everything . 
 I ’ m thinking of taking you back home . I thought we could have a nice evening , but you ’ re always so negative . 
 You see , that ’ s what I ’ m talking about , I can ’ t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore 
 Well he ’ s more of a man than you are ; at least he appreciates love stories . 
 Don ’ t criticize Mario or else I ’ ll start on those fat , drunk friends of yours ; they ’ re no saints . 
 You ’ re unbearable ; you can walk home , I ’ m leaving . 
 Well , I studied French at school , but I ’ Ve forgotten most of it . I learnt some Russian while I was studying there and now I study Spanish in evening classes . Do you speak Japanese at home with your parents ? 
 How do you find studying a language on the internet ? 
 I bet you find the character difficult to write ! 
 So , you can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers , right ? 
 In a way , it ’ s similar to your experience of learning Chinese . Some Spanish words are very similar to English ones . But I need to practise listening to native speakers and saying the words myself . 
 Sorry , I thought you knew . 
 Didn't I ? 
 Well , I am telling you now . 
 I didn't think you would be interested . 
 Sorry , I didn't think it mattered . 
 So , did you go out with Richard ? 
 Did you like it ? 
 Yeah . So did you do anything else ? 
 Did you have fun there ? 
 Would you like to go to work or continue your studies after graduation ? 
 So you will continue to study for a master's degree ? 
 How can you finance your education abroad ? It is very expensive to study abroad . 
 It could be pretty tough studying abroad . Being so far away from home ... 
 Did you get any ? 
 How much is the ticket ? 
 What a great weekend that was ! 
 I really enjoy the beach in the summer . 
 We should come here more often . 
 I'd like to come back next weekend . 
 Yeah , I think so . Oh , by the way , I need to ask you something . 
 Could I get back the sweater you borrowed ? 
 My boots ? Er ... Sure , ok . 
 I spent the morning at the cemetery . I put flowers on the graves of my old war buddies . 
 They should . This holiday is about remembering our war dead . But people these days think it's just a holiday for summer sales and cookouts ! 
 I went to Super Junior's concert last night . It was fantastic . 
 Yes , their new album just came out last week . It is number one on the billboard . 
 The lyrics of the new song are beautiful , too . Can you sing ? 
 Let's go buy their new album . Want to come with me ? 
 I am a little nervous about my presentation on Friday . 
 Wouldn't that take you away from your project ? 
 Is there a good time for you to help me ? 
 How about meeting in my office ? 
 Sounds like you'll be able to help me a lot . 
 If you can choose , will you marry a foreigner or a Chinese ? 
 Not yet . But I wonder if I can get my parents ’ consent . 
 You are right . It is giving me a real headache . I feel like I ’ m between a rock and a hard place . 
 Oh , how did you deal with it ? 
 Oh , it ’ s a pity . What was the matter ? 
 Like what ? 
 Oh , I see . In their culture women should put family first . 
 So that's why it ’ s hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner . 
 Where is Tom ? 
 What ? It ’ s only 9p . m . Now . Why today he went to bed so early ? 
 Oh , I see . 
 Hi . You look excited . What's happening ? 
 And you're planning to enter ? 
 Is there a prize ? 
 Do you think you have a chance ? 
 But you haven't practised all that much . 
 Don't be too sure . You're still going to need some help . 
 I've got to go to bed . Have to work tomorrow . 
 Good night . See you tomorrow . 
 That is a good idea , I love it . What time do you think is convenient ? 
 Ok , I will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . It has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . I am sure they don ’ t want to miss it . 
 What day is today ? 
 What's the date today ? 
 Oh , today's International Labour Day . Is it our working day ? 
 Can you take part in our picnic this Saturday ? 
 We plan to go to a forest in the suburb . There is a beautiful river there . We can do some fishing . 
 And don't forget your fishing tackle . 
 Daniel , what are you doing here ? Aren't you supposed to be at school now ? 
 Well , we shall make it a secret between us . 
 She is the cheer-leader . They are required to put on a performance . Look ! Here they come . 
 I want to be like her . 
 Hey , young man ! I'm your sis . Don't talk to me like that . 
 Boy , you've got such a crush on her , haven't you ? 
 Are you out of your mind ? 
 Go ahead , have a try and be a joke . 
 Which John ? Mr.Turnbow ’ s son ? 
 And he ’ s bright and intelligent . I ’ m sure he can pass the university entrance exam . 
 How ’ s your boy , Jack ? 
 Poor boys ! They work harder at school nowadays , don ’ t they ? 
 You have made a poor meal . Let me get you some more fish . 
 What about some drink ? 
 Good morning . I want to apply for a library card . 
 But I hear that the card is free . 
 There will be a refund when I return the card , right ? 
 OK , here you are . 
 Me too . No one has expected he can really get somewhere with his business . 
 What do you think of the plan for the new airport near here ? 
 I think they will . 
 To tell you the truth , I don't think much of them . 
 A lot of people feel the same way . 
 With pleasure . 
 Me , what brought that on ? 
 What does it say ? 
 Like disco ? 
 And disco a kind of nightclub . 
 So ... disco is what the music is called and a disco is a place where people go to dance to it.And breakdancing is a different sort of thing altogether . 
 Could we borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend ? 
 It is in the hotel ballroom down the street . 
 We will need it for both days . 
 The van will be driven by Mary and me . 
 Oh yeah , no problem . Would you mind if we borrowed a few of the chairs from the lunchroom . 
 Guess who I saw yesterday ? 
 Avril Lavigen ! 
 yeah , I worked as temporary staff in her concert . Look , her poster , a CD ... 
 not really . But I like some of her songs . She's actually very talented . She's a song writer and fashion and fashion designer , too . 
 yes , though I don't think her acting skills are that great . 
 she looked sweeter than her pictures . 
 no , there were too many people . When she got out of the car , her fans were all screaming , trying to give her flowers and ger her autographs . 
 Can you lend me fifty bucks ? 
 I guess I don't earn enough . 
 That's my business , not yours . 
 So how do you survive from pay day to pay day ? 
 I'm not disciplined enough I guess . 
 How do you think the transport system in our city could be improved ? 
 I think we just need to build more roads . Then there would be more space for cars to drive and we ’ d have fewer traffic jams . 
 How would you do that ? 
 I don ’ t know . I think it ’ s unfair to make drivers pay more money . They already pay a lot of tax-petrol tax , for example . 
 The air would certainly be cleaner if there were fewer cars being used in the city . The problem is that people will see it as reducing their freedom . It well be unpopular . 
 What day is today ? 
 Oh , The day after tomorrow is Christmas . 
 You ’ re new here , right ? 
 Will this be your first year ? 
 What school did you come from ? 
 Why ’ d you transfer here ? 
 Is PCC a good school ? 
 I hope you enjoy it here . 
 The bridegroom looks a bit nervous . 
 Oh , they are playing the wedding March . Here they come . 
 I am so happy for them . 
 Yes , I always cry at weddings . 
 Yes , they are . 
 In fact , we are beginning to make preparations . 
 No , no , for the engagement . 
 Jessica is going back to Holland next week . I've been thinking a lot about what to give her as a parting gift , but I still have no clue . 
 yeah , that's her . We had a lot of wonderful times together . She is really a special friend , and I want to get her something meaningful . 
 I don't think so . That way it would lose all the charm . I want it to be a surprise . I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last . 
 hmm , I think I've got an idea . Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home . 
 I hope so . I'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase . I hope it won't cause her trouble at the border . 
 Have you got your invitation yet ? 
 The house warming party . 
 Tom and Bill Smith . They are both working now you know ? And they've bought a new house . 
 It's out in the suburbs . 
 Yes , I have . I went out with them last weekend . 
 Yes , it is . There are three bedrooms , a living room , a dining room , and a big kitchen . There's also a garden . 
 They are moving today . Tom's taken the day off . He's rented a truck , and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight . 
 Next Saturday night . You should get your invitation today or tomorrow . 
 Have you ever been to Xi ’ an ? 
 I ’ Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring . I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day . Of course I won ’ t miss the local food either . You know , the sites interests a food in scenery , food is a key factor when visiting a place . 
 Sure it is . Is it convenient to get there by plane ? 
 Tomorrow is Sunday . Let's go out and get some fresh air . 
 why not ? I love animals and I love nature . 
 sounds very interesting . I can't wait to go there . 
 That is true . Some people go camping , some people pick fresh fruit , some people go boating and some people go grass skiing . 
 Well , now you know . Let's go to the lake over there . Some people are fishing over there . I haven't had a chance to fish in a lake , I really want to try . 
 Yes . we can get what we need at the stands right by the lake . Who do you think will catch a big fish first ? 
 Wait and see . I want to try horseback riding after fishing . It looks very exciting and fun . 
 No problem . It is always worth trying something new once in your life time . 
 I'm ok . I wish I could say the same for my friend . 
 he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving . 
 unfortunately not . He was charged with a DUI when he was in university . 
 not much ; it was a minor offence back then . He got away with a fine of $ 500 . 
 no , they were really easy on him . The problem is that that was a long time ago . They are much tougher on crime now . 
 well , he'll definitely lose his license , pay a fine , and maybe even spend some time in jail . 
 not yet . If we can't find a lawyer for him , then the state will appoint him with one . 
 that'd be great ! I know he'd appreciate your help . 
 Is that so ? I didn't know it.Can I possible borrow a jacket and a tie ? 
 Then we return to the hotel and come back.Will you change the appointment ? 
 At seven , please . 
 A party of three . 
 You know Ernie , it seems we both like the same artists . 
 But if we're going to start a band , we have to be able to sing and dance . Can you do that ? 
 Great ! I'll sing , and you can dance in our band . 
 it's easy ! Just go and get a card . 
 Not yet . 
 Yes , he married my sister ten years ago . 
 Yes , my sister loves his personality . 
 I am swapped with work after 10 - day holiday . 
 I went to Paris . 
 That's more like it . 
 They might actually win the game . 
 Sorry , I can ’ t . I ’ m busy . 
 I always do volunteer work on the first Saturday of every month . 
 I help out at the children ’ s hospital . I help plan activities . 
 Yeah . It ’ s exciting . This month we ’ re doing crossword puzzles . 
 Can you take he away from me ? 
 She kept on bothering me . 
 But I am her brother , not her servant . 
 Calm down . Madam . 
 I am very sorry to hear that you ’ Ve been having so many problems . 
 I understand why you ’ re angry , Mrs . Wilson , and believe me , we are doing everything in our power to work this out . 
 If you could just give us a few more days , we should be able to get this straightened out . 
 What exactly ? 
 In your first letter , that is , when you apply for admission , you should also tell them you need their financial aid . 
 If the aid is available , they will give you two or more application forms , One is for admission , the others are for the aid . 
 They will tell you the aid is impossible . 
 Oh I didn ’ t go . I stayed at home with my family . 
 We watched lots of television and films . 
 Yes , we ate a delicious meal and drank some very good wine . 
 What's the temperature today ? 
 What's the weather forecast for tomorrow ? 
 Are you used to the climate here ? 
 What is the average temperature of Beijing ? 
 Which season do you like best ? 
 I simply couldn ’ t help giving him the fish-eye when I knew all that . 
 However , he disappointed us very much this time . 
 Kelly , the guys and I think you should run for senior class president . 
 We talked to our older brothers and sisters last night and got the scoop on what that job is all about . 
 Yes . Did you know that the senior class president works for the class for life ? The job doesn't stop when we graduate . 
 Every class reunion is organized by the president and council and anything our class does for the school in later years is headed by the president . 
 Wow ! You look like a drowned rat ! Didn't you know there is a thunder-storm today ? 
 Well . You'd better take a hot shower right now , or you will catch a cold . 
 Why are those people crying ? 
 Tomb Sweeping Day ? What is it ? 
 What do they do ? 
 Er ... Alison ? 
 I just wanted to congratulate you ! I mean , it was a good race and you deserve to win . 
 It was that final sprint ! You were great ! Really ! 
 Why aren't you at work ? 
 How is the college search going ? 
 But don't you want to study music ? Shouldn't it be easy ? 
 I know . You have to decide if you want to attend a school in a city or in the country , a big school or a small school , a public or private school ... 
 I see . Well , don't forget to talk to the college counselor at the school . He usually gives good advice and can help point you in the right direction.He gave me some information , and next week I'm going to take a look at some of the colleges he recommended . 
 I ’ m trying to decide what school to apply for . 
 I ’ m not sure . What ’ s the difference between them ? 
 Which is better ? 
 I hear you have to wear uniforms at private schools . 
 Excuse me , Professor . I am going to miss next week's class . 
 No , I have to do this ; it's important ! 
 I've made arrangements with a friend to help me . 
 Yes , I know . 
 OK , I can do that . 
 It seems so strange to be here , burying you , but it's not you . 
 This has been the worst and best day of my life , Taylor . They kept you in the hospital , and ... 
 But you're OK ? It was nothing serious , was it ? 
 The air quality in this city is horrendous . The pollution levels are so high that we are not supposed to go outside with a face mask again ! 
 On top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city . 
 I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse effect . 
 It's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature . 
 They're related to one another , yes . 
 People joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well . 
 I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place . 
 I'm not sure . 
 OK , let's go to the cinema to see what's on . 
 It is impossible . You cheated on me . 
 Shut up ! 
 But you have had lily already ? You should have told me about her , but you didn't . 
 Leave me ! Go away ! 
 I would if I could . 
 Yes , With pleasure . 
 On the contrary , I think he's very serious . 
 So they're easy to remember . 
 He's an old antique , very serious . 
 Hey ! How about your history teacher ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . 
 Sounds good . What should we see ? 
 You mean the one starring John Travolta ? 
 Sounds like an interesting film . Let's meet at five o'clock on Saturday . 
 Could you do me a favor ? 
 Could you possibly give me a lift home ? 
 Are you sure ? I don't want to inconvenience you . 
 Thanks . I really appreciate it . Thanks so much . 
 What can I help you with ? 
 What is it ? 
 I can understand the problem with that . 
 No problem , do you want those classes still ? 
 Let me see if I can find one of these classes on another day . 
 It's said that the government will clamp down on the new policy . 
 I am not certain about that . 
 Did you hear that Mary ’ s marriage is on the rocks ? 
 Yesterday I met Mary , and she told me her husband often made pass at his secretary . 
 Are there any interesting articles in today ’ s newspapers ? 
 Is there anything of interest to us in the business sections ? 
 Are the reports favorable ? 
 That ’ s interesting . They must be thinking of moving into that market . Are there any interesting editorials ? 
 I ’ m not surprised . That article certainly added fuel to the debate . Ok . Thanks . Can you leave two articles and the advertisements with me ? I ’ d like to read them . 
 Can you imagine a boat letting in the river ? 
 Sure thing . I have an experience like that . 
 I was in such a panic at that time . Fortunately another boat came along and I was saved from drowning . 
 Well , I have been in a host home before . During my first year in the us , I stayed with a family . They are nice . 
 Well , that depends . If you stay for a long time . They will offer a discount . 
 That's about five blocks . And around corners too.So he was definitely following you . 
 Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . 
 Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything . 
 Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police.But for now , just try not to worry . 
 What's your favorite book ? 
 Why do you like it best ? 
 Well . I like the Thorn Birds best . 
 Sure . I like the writer's language , too . 
 Would you like to go to the bookshop with me ? 
 May I help you ? 
 May I see your library card , please ? 
 Apparently , you have unpaid late fees . 
 You owe some money . 
 You owe $ 24.50 . 
 Until you pay it , you can ’ t check out books . 
 How did you choose courses when you were abroad ? 
 Wait a minute . There are some new terms for me . I can hardly follow you . 
 Everything is so new to me . I think I'll have to experience a very difficult period when I get there . 
 I am very grateful for your advice . 
 So it is hard to be a black student on campus ? 
 Stereotypes ? Like what ? 
 I do know you like rap music , but the other two are definitely false . I ’ Ve seen you play basketball . 
 You mean that people look down upon you because they think you're in school because of a quota ? That's not true at all , you're really a smart guy . 
 Teachers ? I didn't think that they would be racist at all . 
 I see . It looks like there are still a lot of issues we need to work on in the US . 
 What do you need ? 
 What building is it in ? 
 Oh , I know exactly where that is . 
 Sure , what room number is it ? 
 I have a class around there right now . 
 No problem , come on . 
 Yes , I watched once . 
 Well , honestly speaking , I went to watch it out of curiosity . I'd say it's really a special art form . 
 Really ? Good for you . 
 OK ! How about Scrabble ? 
 OK ! 
 Our cousin Pete ! My turn ! She has a pointy nose , sunken eyes and a mole on her chin ! 
 Your future husband ! 
 Hi Julie , how are things going ? 
 I'm doing really well . 
 Julie , do you know who that woman is over there by the window ? 
 I thought that he was with Malia . 
 I bet that Lee wasn't too happy with that ! 
 You can take this car into consideration . It works well and its price is reasonable . 
 So , Emily , how was your day ? 
 It can't have been that bad . Go on and tell me about it . 
 Why ? What happened ? 
 That's not very fair . What did you do ? 
 Does he treat everyone in your department like this ? 
 Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ? 
 Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at you company ? 
 That's very sensible . It sounds like you have a good head on you shoulders . 
 That's so true . When you have a taste for success , you can't let dishonest people like your manager get in the way . 
 Yes I can . I speak it very well . 
 I lived in England when I was a child . 
 Well , I know a little Italian . 
 About David , No , I didn ’ t hear anything . 
 Sorry , I don ’ t quite follow you . 
 Oh , that is a shame . He is really hard working . 
 We have a fairly good working relationship , but there was also a rough spot . 
 Well , he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations . 
 She is now in a private school . 
 It's idea of my husband . He is always banging the drum for better schools . 
 I am very interested in a new apartment near the Taxing Plaza , but the price is very high , I really can't afford it . 
 It's 7500 yuan per square meter , and I really like the one with three bedrooms and a large living room . Its total area is about 80 square meters . 
 Do you think I am rich enough to make it ? I am thinking about buying the apartment by installments . The real estate agency says if I pay a 25 % down payment , I can move in at once . 
 I really like the record you lent me the other day . 
 And thank you very much for letting me keep it so long . 
 I'm most grateful . Everyone in our class enjoyed it . 
 Would you mind my keeping it for another week ? 
 Yes , of course , please follow me . 
 This is our courtyard . 
 Yes , about 46 square metres . 
 Yes . 
 They don't have enough time to peel it after they harvested them , so they hung them in the tree . Then in winter , they can peel corn ears in their leisure time . 
 So , where are you going to spend your winter vacation ? 
 You have a girlfriend in Thailand ? Interesting . How come I have never heard of that ? 
 You mean you haven ’ t seen her before ? Then , how could she be your girlfriend ? Maybe you don ’ t even know her . 
 Congratulations ! It ’ s good to follow your heart . But I just didn ’ t expect to be so fast . 
 Probably you ’ re right . 
 I've been really busy . How is everything ? 
 Yeah , why not ? I've got a little free time on my hands . Where do you want to eat ? 
 It does seem like the perfect day ! I ’ m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! This looks like the perfect spot ! Ok kids , put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up camp . Here , Mary , help me lay down these beach towels . 
 Ok kids , here ’ sa beach ball and a Frisbee , a pail and a shovel . I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave . Don ’ t stray too far . Wait ! Leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes . 
 You ’ re back already ? The water was too cold , huh ? I ’ ll tell you a secret . Do you see that small pool of water over there ? It ’ ll be warmer in there . Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some minnows . 
 Ah ! Not on me ! Ow ! 
 Hi Angela , it's Dan . 
 Good . 
 Yes , I was taking a shower when you called . I saw that you called and I tried to call you back , but I think your phone was off . 
 Oh , is that next week ? 
 No , of course not . I already bought them a present . 
 Sure . Does she know your friend ? 
 Are we all going to drive together ? 
 Hey , look at the offer I got in my e-mail . It says that I can get rich quickly while working at home ! 
 What do you mean ? 
 But it seems like a good idea . All I have to do is first send some money to the person who sent me the letter . After that he'll tell me how to earn much more money . 
 Pyramid scheme ? What is that ? 
 Sounds good to me . The guy at the top gets money and so do the people below him . 
 What happens then ? 
 I see . I guess I should be more careful about what I read , especially on the Internet where you have no idea who anybody is . 
 Now that you mention it , I'm getting a little bumed-out from studying nonstop , too . Listening to some music for a while would suit me just fine . 
 You sure have a lot of discs here . 
 To tell you the truth , I'm strictly into classical music . You don't happen to have any Bach or Mozart , do you ? 
 Well , speaking of history , let's get back to the books.We ' Ve got an exam tomorrow , remember ? 
 Next Saturday ? I ’ m sorry . I ’ Ve promised to go to a Chinese Opera with my daughter . 
 Yes , Sunday sounds fine . What time ? 
 It suits us fine . We ’ ll see you then . 
 I was thinking of holding the company retreat in the mountains . 
 I was thinking it could take place sometime in January . 
 Yes , you are right . 
 Yes , that would work out better . 
 Good idea ! We'll have to get right on it . 
 How may I help you ? 
 Do you have your library card ? 
 It appears that you have late fees . 
 Yes , really . 
 You owe $ 24.50 in late fees . 
 I ’ m sorry , but until you pay it , you won ’ t be able to check out any more books . 
 Merry Christmas ! 
 I said Merry Christmas ! Don ’ t you know that Christmas is almost here ? 
 Huh ? Didn ’ t you know ? Aren ’ t you excited ? 
 Forgotten about it ? How could you ? 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry . I didn ’ t know . 
 I guess so . So what do you do around this time of year ? 
 Well , would you be horribly offended if I invited you to a Christmas party at my house ? 
 Do you want to go shopping with me ? 
 How about Saturday morning ? 
 Welcome , young man . No offence , but I haven't seen you here before . 
 Okay then . You are the younger customer here ever . 
 It's the marketing's fault , I suppose.What do you want to do ? 
 That's a long way to go , I'm afraid . First of all , you gotta grow up . 
 Sure . Then what about trying the treadmill or the skipping rope . 
 Please change your clothes first ! 
 Sorry , but no jeans here . 
 I hear that the Students ' Union is going to take new members . 
 Of course you can if you like it . 
 There will be an information session about the Students ' Union this Tuesday . You can apply for it then . 
 Is that girl your girlfriend ? 
 She doesn't look like our classmate . 
 Really , she's so pretty . 
 I love going out into the countryside for walks or bike ride . I love being out in the fresh summer air . How about you ? 
 What do you do in winter ? 
 I think most people do . I like wearing nice , colorful clothes in summer , you know , a nice dress or skirt . It ’ s too cold for those kinds of clothes in winter . 
 Do you think we ’ ll have a nice summer this year ? 
 Happy new year ! 
 Have you got any plans ? 
 My roommate ’ s having a party . 
 Yes , we do . 
 It's 3 nights a week , Monday , Tuesday and Thursday . 
 It lasts for 9 months . 
 The next beginning class starts on October 25th . 
 From 7 to 9 o'clock . 
 It costs 125 dollars a month . 
 Thank you , please fill out this form for us . 
 Yes , please . we need a record of you education and your work experiences . 
 I think housing is a big problem . There are thousands of homeless people on the streets . 
 I have a good idea to solve it . The government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes . 
 I think the government can afford it . Besides , there are many advantages . Homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . They would learn some useful skill for finding jobs i 
 If we are to invest more money to education , we will need to raise taxes . That wouldn ’ t be popular with voters . 
 The government should show that it is using money efficiently . Sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project . 
 Do you keep any pets , such as cats , dogs ? 
 Oh , but why ? 
 Would you like to see our new shirts ? 
 Well , they are very nice you know . 
 And not expensive either . 
 Everybody is buying them . 
 Yes , they are very fashionable , you see . 
 I see . 
 Sorry I couldn't help you . 
 Hi , Gary , what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater . Why didn ’ t you meet me there ? 
 Don ’ t you know our movie starts at seven ? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . Then it doesn ’ t make sense to meet at the apartment . 
 Why don ’ t you try to be clearer about your intentions ? 
 It ’ s okay . I don ’ t want to go now . We ’ Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . I don ’ t want to see a movie without watching the beginning . 
 I hate school ! 
 I messed up my mid-term exam so badly today ! 
 yes , but it's so humiliating ! I don't want my friends to know I failed ! 
 I don't know . I sat down in my seat , looked at my paper , and then my mind just went totally blank . 
 no ... 
 I watched TV . 
 no , not really . 
 tomorrow . 
 I haven't met the Smiths for a long time . 
 Why ? 
 Did you hear about Joe ? She hasn't eaten for days . 
 Love sick . You know who she's in love with ? 
 Someone you're living with . 
 Come on , Mary , it's your brother , Jack . 
 The problem with Joe is that she's too shy to tell him . 
 Well , if you want to help your friend , you should do something about it . 
 Yes , but I doubt if I get it . I've never got it . 
 How do you like the food sold in this sidewalk snack booth ? 
 Any time . But I don't mind eating boxed lunch . The food sanitation is really good too . 
 Hey , it's not that bad . The food is nutritious and it's really convenient . I don't want to spend too much time on eating stuff . 
 Well , will you just go back to work after lunch ? 
 But you didn't eat anything today . 
 All right . I'm going to the McDonald's . 
 No , I never did . It's for my son . He loves it , and I made an agreement with him that he can eat it once a week . 
 Me , either . But , it's for sure that the children market is a really big one . 
 What can I do for you today ? 
 Can I do anything else for you ? 
 Is that all ? 
 May I see your library card , please ? 
 Will that be all for today ? 
 These are due back in two weeks . 
 Which sports are popular in your country ? 
 Do many people like tennis ? 
 In my country , many people enjoy golf , but it is too expensive for some people . A few people like extreme sports , but I think the vast majority of people are afraid to try them . 
 I know loads of people who play it regularly . There are plenty of golf courses around the country . In the past , only a tiny number of people played . 
 There are plenty of rugby fans in my country too . 
 Oh , you're welcome . 
 Sarah and I could see eye to eye with each other . 
 No , I encourage her to go her own way , but she's now having a change of heart . 
 When do you leave ? 
 Take care of yourself and don't forget to keep in touch . 
 The weather is terrible . 
 I'm wearing my heavy jacket . 
 Will it snow today ? 
 Yes , when it snows , every where is white . It's very beautiful . 
 Good idea . 
 I agree . We need to recycle our trash and use public transportation more often . 
 Have you heard of motor coaching ? It's one of the fastest-growing segments for the travel industry . 
 It's almost like going on an ocean cruise except that you go by land . Everything is planned for you from the moment you step on board a luxury coach . 
 Oh . no . The motor coach is air-conditioned , there is a galley for food preparation , movies or music are available for your entertainment and attendants are there to take care of your every need . 
 Who's your favorite film star ? 
 What films feature him ? 
 My Chinese friends told me that the Spring Festival is coming soon . Can you tell me something about it ? 
 What happens on the holiday ? 
 Do people cook a lot of special dishes for the holiday ? 
 Rachel has decided to quit smoking . 
 You never guess she is going to have a baby . 
 Yes , yes . She said she is going to stop drinking coffee too and quit all the unhealthy habits just for the baby . 
 Do you know who ’ s just got married ? Old McDonald . 
 He ’ s nearly 90 . 
 I am . What ’ s more , his wife is 84 . 
 Yes , she is . And guess what , he is her sixth husband . 
 It's almost midnight ! We are about to start a brand new year ! 
 Do you have a New Year's resolution ? 
 Yeah I know what you mean . That's why this year I am keeping things more simple . Maybe like getting together with friends I haven't seen in a long time , or doing some volunteering work . 
 Sure , as long as you don't try to kiss me at midnight ! 
 Excuse me , are you Sara Wilson ? 
 Nice to meet you too.Let me help you with your bags . 
 Wow , you're not kidding.Hold on a second.Hello , could you give us a hand , please ? 
 I'm a student . 
 Tsinghua University . 
 Have you any definite idea ? 
 I think you'd better try an active job . 
 Hey , Pat ! Yeah , I haven ’ t seen you in ages ! How is going ? 
 Yeah ? How ’ s he doing ? 
 Oh yeah ? 
 Ha ha , really ? 
 Hey , Jack , where's your car ? 
 Is that right ? It sure beats the old one ? 
 Ok . Boy , this looks expensive . 
 Wow , this's sinking a hole . 
 I believe it . Hoo , this car corners like it's on rails . 
 Wow , this car can really burn rubber . 
 You made a perfect choice , Jack . 
 What's your email address ? 
 Bulldog 123 . Are you sure that's all ? 
 No . That's incomplete . 
 What's your mailing address ? 
 That's correct . 
 Bulldog 123 is just the street . You have to give me the city , state , and ZIP code . 
 I'm here for my appointment . 
 I have an issue with my schedule . 
 I have two classes on here that are at the same time . 
 Can you change that for me ? 
 Yes , I would like to keep both classes . 
 I would greatly appreciate that . 
 It would be very hard work . Are you sure ? 
 Running a farm would be totally different to you current job . 
 You ’ d need a lot of training before becoming a farmer . It ’ s not something you can just walk into . 
 Well , I ‘ d certainly come and visit you . It would be great to take a working holiday on a farm . I ’ d love to get away from hustle and bustle of the city for a while . 
 no idea . We've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights . What else is there to see ? 
 you mean visit a factory ? 
 good idea ! I've always been interested in that . How much is the entrance fee ? 
 really ? What do the companies do that for ? 
 oh , i see . So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors . 
 do we need an appointment beforehand ? 
 Look , here're two coins named Kai Yuan Tong Bao — the sort of coin made in memory of the founding of a new dynasty . These two coins were made in different periods of the Tang Dynasty . 
 The one made in the early Tang period is bigger and has more characters on it , while the one with smaller and elegant characters was made in late Tang period . Look carefully , and tell me if you see the difference now . 
 Various methods were used in history to produce fake coins . We usually send the coin to an authorized unit to have it tested by experts with special machines . We can judge it with naked eyes . 
 Certainly , they did . Liao Coins and Song Coins , for example , coexisted in circulation during the Southern Song and Yuan period some 800 -1000 years ago . The Liao Coins look plain and bold in style , just like the characteristics of the Mongolian tribe . Let me look for one and show you . 
 There will be another sandstorm here tomorrow . 
 Yes . We should plant more trees and grass to stop the sand from spreading . 
 But we need the wood . 
 What are you guys doing ? 
 What ’ s wrong with you , Mr . Polly ? 
 Then , buy a bottle of soft drink . 
 It ’ s a problem , because my boss is in that shop now . 
 Sorry , Mr . Polly . 
 Have a try . 
 How about coming with me to meet my American friends ? 
 Okay , I'll pick you up at eight o'clock . 
 I look at myself in the mirror . Sometimes , it ’ s not a pleasant sight , especially if I have been out late the late before . 
 I usually don ’ t have time for a bath in the mornings , so I just take a shower . Sometimes I need a cold shower to wake me up and sometimes I need a hot one , especially if it ’ s winter and I need to warm up . 
 I shave every workday , but I only shave at weekends if I ’ m going out somewhere . If I ’ m staying at home , I don ’ t shave . 
 Yes . I brush my teeth in the morning , just before I go to work . It ’ s actually the last thing I do before leaving . Then I brush again before bed . 
 Miss Wang , would you mind my asking you a personal question ? 
 Are you married ? 
 Frankly yes.We like to employ married people.By the way , do you have any children ? 
 I'm not satisfied with it . 
 Sometimes it goes fast . And sometimes it goes slow . And the alarm doesn'twork , either . 
 No . Can I have my money back ? 
 A receipt ? 
 Oh , I'm not certain , but I think I've lost it . 
 Hi , Mary . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve got a meeting in a minute . 
 Right . I ’ ll see you later . 
 Would you mind if I ask you whether you are married or not ? 
 Do you mean you got a divorce ? 
 Let me clear away the broken glass . 
 It's very careless of me to have broken your glass . 
 Have you followed the value of dollar lately ? 
 It's really frustrating , isn't it ? I have the same problem . I would feel a lot better if the currency was a little more stable . With the way the dollar plummeting lately , my securities have gone up in smoke . 
 What we really should be making investment in is the Euro . I've followed the Euro's progress over the last quarter , I think it's about time to buy in . 
 Are you kidding ? The Yen is in worse shape than the Dollar ! 
 Great idea . Unlike you , I just want to enjoy watching the sea and playing with the sand . I do not want to get a tan because I look good in pale skin . 
 While the pale color symbolizes beauty and elegance in most Asia countries . 
 I will bring a big hat and apply a lot of sunscreen before setting off the beach . 
 ( At the beach ) My bag is so heavy . Let's put the stuff under the tree . 
 I can't wait to play in the water . My feet are burning when I stand on the sand . 
 Just a minute . It ’ s ten to nine by my watch . 
 What ’ s the hurry ? 
 It ’ s plenty of time yet . The railway station is very close . It won ’ t take your twenty minutes to get there . 
 Yes , I packed it myself . 
 It's my health-conscious lunch , good for my health and beauty . 
 Can you name some festivals of religious nature ? 
 What about historic festivals ? 
 I wonder how Sarah and Mat are . 
 I'm not surprised . She's a plain Jane . 
 Where's Bob ? 
 Can you give him a call on his mobile ? 
 excuse me ; is this seat taken ? 
 thank you very much . My name is Ashlan . It's nice to meet you . 
 the weather is so warm for December , don't you think ? 
 global warming is wreaking havoc everywhere . 
 no . I'm new here . I just moved here a few months ago . 
 I'm from China . What about you ? 
 did you enjoy it ? 
 it's very different from Chinese food , but I am getting used to it . 
 yes , have you read it ? 
 well , to be honest , I've only gotten though 10 pages of it . So far , though , it's interesting . 
 likewise . Bye ! 
 Yes . That would be good . 
 What's the matter ? 
 You shouldn't have used the machine . Did you lose your money ? 
 You ought to complain . These machine are always out of order . 
 Yes , what a wonderful day ! The sky has cleared up in the end . 
 How about taking a walk in the park ? 
 ( After they entering the park ) Great , it's so quiet here . We have the park to ourselves , only you and me . 
 Oh , I see them . Beautiful weather should be shared by all the people . 
 How was the party last night ? Did you enjoy it ? 
 Why ? What happened ? 
 What about the party ? 
 So how long did you stay ? 
 Do you think my briefcase is big enough to put in all these stuff ? 
 I guess I need all of them . 
 I know . But it is my lucky charm . I carry it all the time . 
 Why do all girls appear feminine after sophomore year ? 
 I feel they all talk and behave in a different way . 
 Some even do make-up slightly . Are you aware that previous ' small potato ' Ma Xiaoxiao becomes a piece of cheese cake recently ? 
 Stop preaching your dream love Marilyn Monroe to me . I know those sexy women are your tastes . 
 I appreciate the saying ' Love consists in this , that two solitude protect , border and salute each other . ' 
 So do I . The sun ... the sand ... the ocean ! 
 Oh , Tom ! They sound fantastic . I really like all those things . 
 Well , except fishing . To be honest , I hate fishing , but I love all the others . 
 You know . I really don't those big hotels . 
 May , look , what's that in the cage ? 
 Of course I know . I just can't see it very well . 
 Of course , Bamboo ! 
 I also know they are given to other countries as gifts for friendship . 
 Not really , panda is my favorite animal . 
 Any way , in a word , panda is our friend . 
 Yeah , let me think , the kangaroo and koala bear from Australia are very famous . 
 You look fresh recently.How do you make it ? 
 Aren't you tired ? 
 John , did you have a dream when you was a little boy ? 
 I had the same experience with you . When I was a little boy I dreamed to be a great scientist . But now you see , I'm just a common office clerk . 
 I do . And now I'm working hard to learn English , and I want to be an interpreter some day . 
 Thanks , I will . 
 Emm ... yes . But I wasn't too impressed . I found her a little stuck up . 
 Tom ... you are her boss , you down . Of course , she's helpful to you . 
 I don't think so actually . She never even says " hello " to me . 
 I don't know . Well , my contract here is for one year , and I don't know what I should do after that . Maybe going around for a while . 
 Actually , I am learning that now . But it's too hard for me . You know the four tones and the stuff . It really freaks me out . 
 You hit the nail right on the head . 
 What is it ? 
 Awesome . I've been giving this a lot of thought . When can we do this ? 
 Ok , cool . 
 No problem . 
 Great party , isn ’ t it ? 
 By the way , my name is Liu Wei . 
 What do you do , Susan ? 
 I work for the Bank of China , in the International Section . 
 Thanks.Miss Zhang . 
 Really ? I've already opened this one.Say , this is sweater , and it's just what I need to go with my new suit.Thank you ever so much . 
 I haven ’ t decided yet . But I may go out . 
 I want to go to Shanghai , but I also want to visit Hainan . 
 I don ’ t know . How about you ? are you staying here or somewhere . 
 By train or by plane ? 
 What a pin-up she is ! 
 That's incredible ! She has such a sharp figure . 
 Do you have spare time tonight ? 
 There will be a live show of football tonight . 
 AC Milan versus Real Madrid . 
 Absolutely . 
 Great idea ! Here we go ! 
 Goofed off ? Maybe , but I'm not a clock-watcher . I finished doing what I should do and then knock off an hour earlier . 
 I'm sure of what I'm doing . 
 You can say that again . Susan ’ brother dropped in from out of town , so I offered to put him up for a few days . But he ’ s driving me up a wall . This guy is bottomless pit . 
 He doesn ’ t lift a finger ! I bend over backwards cleaning up all day and he sleeps in until noon . 
 You think he might stay even longer ? ! 
 That wouldn ’ t be a lie ! 
 How ? Do you want to play strip-trivia or something ? 
 Why don't we just make it a friendly game ? 
 What ’ s wrong with it ? 
 It sounds too bad . What will you do ? 
 That ’ s what I want to say . 
 I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me . 
 I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done . 
 I like your new skirt . 
 Yes . It looks terrific ! 
 You were lucky to find it . 
 Yes , but I don't know much about it . 
 My favourite is Jasmine tea . I like its aroma . 
 David , why didn ’ t you clean the room ? 
 Why are you feeling depressed ? 
 I don ’ t think she will do such a thing . 
 Oh , cheer up . A girlfriend is not everything . 
 Then forgive her mistake . 
 What's the cause ? 
 I see why it lags behind other towns . 
 I ’ m very fond of you . 
 why ? You mean a lot to me . 
 what question ? 
 you know that I care for you . I---I ’ m proud of you . 
 I---I don ’ t feel like saying it . 
 Is it stimulating ? 
 I hope I still have chances . 
 Hi . I ’ m calling about your continuing education program . 
 I want to become certified in computer programming . Do you offer any part-time courses for adult further education ? 
 How do I sign up ? 
 Great ! 
 It's been a long time , hasn't it ? How have you been ? 
 I've never been better , thanks . 
 Yes , I think so . If you want to graduated this year , you've got to take a science course . 
 Well , I have to take biology , chemistry , maps and physics . What you need is a good introductory course for non-science majors . 
 That's a problem . 
 Is that right ? I hear all these horror stories of internet business crashing because there is not enough of a customer base yet . How can you be sure your idea will cash in ? 
 That's marketing research ... But what about getting started once you have an idea ? 
 Sounds like a lot of work ! 
 You went out on a date last night , didn't you ? 
 How come ? 
 Why don't you phone her for a date again ? 
 Don't jump to conclusions . Look at the bright side , try to make another date again . 
 Happy birthday , Aims ! 
 Here is a present for you . I hope you like it . 
 I'm very glad to hear that . 
 Bill , do you know when did the Chinese begin to celebrate Teachers ' Day ? 
 So , it is the 27th Teachers ' Day . 
 I am going to send Mr . Li some flowers . What about you ? 
 I hear scientists in the US have discovered a new AIDS vaccine . 
 I don ’ t know . The report says it is better than the old vaccines . 
 Right . That ’ s why doctor say AIDS prevention means cleanness . 
 That's because he's getting nervous . Anyway , this is the first time he's directed a play . 
 Yes , you're right . Maybe there's any other reason . 
 I got the short end of the stick . 
 Oh , no ! Why ? I was looking forward to seeing you at my new place . 
 No problem . Call me when you get back . 
 That's good for me , but do you think you'll be back by then ? I'd really like to see you . 
 Great ! That's settled then . 
 Hi , my name is Lean , and I'm from Russia . 
 To me English is a difficult language . 
 True , but English is harder than most.It ' s a crazy language . 
 One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings . 
 May , is this the Hall of Ancient China ? 
 Why are they all in glass boxes ? 
 So there isn't air in the glass boxes ? 
 I wonder how old these things are . Thousands of years ? 
 Hey , look at the tripod . I've seen it on TV . 
 Honey come on ! We are going to be late ! Honestly , you take longer getting ready than I do ! 
 What is it ? Why are all these clothes on the bed ? 
 Are you joking ? What am I going to do with you ? We are going to a dinner party not the beach ! Wear the shirt with the silk tie I bought you and these corduroy pants . It ’ s chilly outside so you can wear this coat . 
 How may I help you ? 
 Give them here . 
 It appears these books are two weeks late . 
 You do realize you are going to have to pay late fees , right ? 
 The late fee is 25 cents a day . 
 It ’ s 25 cents for each book . 
 So what kind of music turns you on ? 
 You mean the kind of stuff like Nirvana ? 
 Hi , Robert . What happened to your face ? It looks swollen . 
 Did it hurt ? 
 How long were you in the chair ? 
 Well , I guess you've learned a good lesson , huh . You have to take good care of your teeth . 
 Don't you have a dental insurance ? 
 Merry Christmas ! 
 Are you doing anything special ? 
 Oh . I'm just going to take it easy . 
 Why ? Are they good ? 
 I'm ready ! Whoa , what a hard throw ! I can't get that ! 
 Ummmph ! 
 I ’ m just looking at this map of the world . I ’ m preparing for a geography class . 
 No , there aren ’ t . this map just show the geographical features . Look at the Himalayan plateau with the highest peaks in the world . 
 I find it incredible how millions of years of volcanic activity have created mountains thousands of metres tall . 
 The oceans and landscapes all influence our climate . 
 What are you up to tonight , Steve ? 
 That sounds like fun . Have a good time . 
 John , they are old-fashioned people from the Chinese countryside . That ’ s their custom . 
 Don ’ t your relatives visit other relatives ? 
 I think that maybe Chinese families are closer than your families . 
 What is today ? 
 So the weekend is coming ! How about seeing a film ! 
 Oh , George , what a beautiful day it is today ! The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there ! What a perfect day to be at the beach ! The kids are going to have so much fun ! A 
 There we go . Can you help me with the umbrella ? Perfect . 
 And stay in the shallow area . I don ’ t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! It ’ s too deep out there and we didn ’ t bring your floatier . 
 What is that ? A jellyfish ? Jeremy , put that down right now ! It could sting you ! 
 What do you think about studying in the U . S . ? 
 Do you have any advice ? 
 Anything else ? 
 I will think over your advice . 
 I really appreciate your help . 
 It's Clive of course . Where did you come from ? Every girl knows Clive ! 
 He is everybody's type . 
 Shooting guard . The same as Michael Jordan ! 
 Used to . But now he is too old to play in a fierce game like this . But Kobe is the upcoming superstar now . 
 That is not true . They are just jealous of him ! 
 You know what , he is also an outstanding football player . He is surely to be a star of tomorrow . 
 You are so not here ! His girlfriend is one of the cheer leaders . 
 Here are the leads from last week's exhibit as a trade show . There are about forty or so that are hot . You should contact them immediately , in the next twenty-four hours if you can . The rest are categorized according to potential and interest.You can see we've got our hot stack , our warm stack , our lukewarm , and our cold but not dead stack . 
 Don't worry , most of the leads on mildly interested , if not strongly interested . We've just got to make sure the Hot ones are contacted right away . And even the contacts that for what ever reason aren't prepared to make an order now , they might be interested in the future . Please be conscanciouss about getting a hold of everyone of these leads . We've spent a big chunk of marketing budget to find these people . I don't want our investment to go down the drain . 
 Where's your hometown ? 
 I just got laid off . The awful business , you know . 
 Yeah , I ’ m better after talking to you . 
 What will you do now ? Propose to her . 
 You should strike while the iron is hot . 
 How do you usually get to school ? 
 I feel that I can see more when I pedal a bicycle , but when I feel lazy , I drive my car . 
 I agree , but I would find it difficult to stop using my car . It's just so convenient . 
 Do you have a car ? 
 Maybe if I sold my car now , I wouldn't be so tempted to use it . 
 That's true . Every month , I spend hundreds of dollars on gas , insurance , and repairs . 
 I could stand to lose a few pounds . Having a car has made me lazy . I never end up walking anywhere ! 
 Sounds good ! Let's go ! 
 That's why he's very popular among girls . 
 You are ! 
 A tough job . They even offer in-service training every Wednesday afternoon . 
 I don't like it . I am not used to this kind of 9 to 5 work hours . Above all , I hate talking to those poker faces everyday . 
 I guess so . I am badly off and I need this job . 
 When does the library close ? 
 Does it close at that time every day ? 
 Is the library open on Saturdays ? 
 What time do you open and close on Saturday ? 
 Okay . Thank you very much . 
 No , that ’ s all . Thanks . 
 It can't be that bad . 
 At least the subway is better than the bus . It's faster for one thing . And usually less crowded . But the drawback is that the subway is more expensive than the bus . It adds up over time , if you take it every day . 
 I ride my bike . I don't live too far away , so it's pretty convenient . it's only about a ten minute bike ride from my house to the office . 
 Yes , not only a good way to keep in shape , but a good way to relieve stress as well . While you're stressed out by your commute , I'm releasing all the stress of the day with mine . 
 I didn't like her butting in where I didn't want her . She's a chatter box . 
 I know . But I just can't stand her butting in when I was trying to emphasize a point . 
 What did he say ? 
 Why ? 
 It is stupid to say so . 
 Well , they ’ re completely different . Reading is passive , and writing is active . 
 In reading you need to recognize language by seeing the words on the page and knowing what they are . In writing you have to produce language , you have to create your own words on a blank page . 
 A reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from a writing knowledge . Don ’ t you think so ? 
 Exactly . 
 They ’ re both harder than reading or writing . 
 Because they are direct communication with another person , and there ’ s a time limit . This time limit is the most serious problem for foreigners , even for those who know lots of English . 
 I ’ m not trying to discourage you . I ’ m trying to help you . You have to live with these difficulties . Isn ’ t it better to know about them ? The more you know about what you have to face , the better you ’ ll do . I promise ! 
 I am happy . I just bought a new car . 
 It ’ s a great car . It ’ s very comfortable and it goes really fast . 
 Put it this way – it wasn ’ t cheap . 
 It ’ s red and black . 
 Fine , I'll take a taxi . 
 Never thought about it , I sure you are right . It's quite a short walk . 
 Professor , do you have a few moments when I could meet with you ? 
 Three would be a good time . 
 I'm not sure . 
 OK , I'll find it . 
 See you then . 
 The boy threw up . 
 Bill . Bill ! You gotta help me ! 
 Tomorrow is Christmas and I haven ’ t bought my mom anything ! I ’ m such a bad son ! 
 That ’ s just it ! I don ’ t know what to get her ! Last year I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small ! I suck at getting presents for people . 
 Yeah , you ’ re right . When it comes down to it , I can be pretty tacky . 
 Now that ’ s a great idea ! 
 Oh , thank you ! It's very kind of you . Ah , it is a porcelain vase . 
 Yes , it is lovely . I have been expecting something like this for a long time . Thanks ever so much . 
 Cheer ! 
 So what time tomorrow ? 
 Where to meet ? 
 OK . Bottoms up . 
 It's on me . 
 Wow , Is winter always this cold in Taiwan ? 
 No , I am from south California . This is my first real winter . 
 What's the temperature today anyway ? 
 Good evening , Mr.Brown . 
 It's nice of you to invite us . 
 it's Beethoven . Do you like it ? 
 I don't know about that , but I do think that it helps people relax . 
 actually , I mostly just listen classical music . What about you ? 
 what kind of music do you prefer then ? 
 not really . I don't think pop music has much depth . 
 how long have you been in to pop music , then ? 
 not really . When I was little , we didn't really listen to music at all . 
 well , when I was about 10 years old , I started playing the piano . I think that's how it all started . 
 yes , it's one of my hobbies . 
 Fine with me , but no more chafing dish . 
 I'd love to try some snacks . 
 Kebabs and roast squid . 
 Help yourself . 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 I'm sorry , sir . But this is the self-service pump . 
 Yes . You must fill up the car yourself . 
 Yes . Are you traveling here ? 
 In America , most gas stations are like this . 
 Well , since this is your first time , I will do it for you.But next time , if you want a full-service gas station , you should look at the sign . 
 Under the sign for the gas station , there will be a smaller sign that says Self-Serve or Full-Service.And some gas stations have both.But if they have both , some pumps will be self-serve and some will be full-serve.You have to look at the signs . 
 Oh , no . It looks like my computer really has caught a virus . 
 Yes , something called “ George W . Bush . ” An hour later , all I see are pictures of George W . Bush in women's clothes . 
 I preferred the forward with pictures of him side-by-side with monkeys . 
 John seems to be in high cotton . He may well become a big shot . 
 What is your idea ? 
 Millions of amateur investors like you , have to rely on a dizzying array of financial newspapers , magazines and commentators to get investment information . 
 It's like information overload , not to mention the reliability of these papers and magazines . 
 Well , for example , The Wall Street Journal is very , very good . Even though it's used on occasion ( as all news organizations are ) by Ces or bankers who leak their mergers in advance in order to get a positive spin . 
 Good . Fortune is usually ahead of the curve.And Business Week is very solid , too . 
 A good broadcast company usually does far more than press releases.Their people go out and do real reporting , talking to people at the stock exchange , fund managers , analysts , etc . 
 You are right about that . 
 There will be a parents ' meeting in our class this Saturday and I am worried about it . 
 I didn't do well in last exams . If my father knows it , he will beat me up . 
 You know that my father is irritable . 
 Good idea . 
 Yes , we're hopping on the bandwagon and signing up for the union . Mostly people are pretty happy about it ... I guess it depends on if you are in management or in the labor force . 
 Sure ... but it's probably better for the workers , because the union's whole purpose is to look out for the little guys . The only way that the little guys can take on the big bosses is if they unite . Labor unions are all about getting a voice for the underdog . 
 That all depends on how the visiting team shapes . 
 But two players of the team have been booked and one is out . 
 Wow that ’ s great news ! They ’ re a great couple ! 
 You aren ’ t going to a strip club , are you ? I don ’ t want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it ’ s your friends party . 
 Well , I don ’ t know . 
 Good , because my friend Wendy is getting married and I ’ m organizing her party ! 
 I just don ’ t find it very interesting . 
 I think that for a lot of people , it ’ s just a way to try and show their country is better than other countries . 
 I ’ m not sure about that . We still have many wars in the world . I think that the idea behind the Olympics is a good one , but the reality is that during the Olympics countries compete . There ’ s no real spirit of cooperation and people are usually not very friendly to each other . 
 Well . I think that the most amazing performances are by athletes who participate in the Paralympics . 
 You have a lovely house , Jack . 
 That's too bad . What problems are you having . 
 I ’ Ve studied home decoration as a hobby . Could I make some suggestions ? 
 Well , I think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room , and maybe some new drapes for the windows . Also , a grandfather clock would look great in the den . Perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room 
 You are welcome , Jack . Glad to be of help . 
 It's a camera . 
 Not even funny , Billy . This is my new snapshot sticker camera . 
 Well , there are adhesive strips on the backs . You can stick them anywhere . 
 I'll meet you at the Gate round about seven . 
 At the Gate . 
 Round about seven . 
 Peter.Peter Brown , you know.Don ' t forget to bring the letter . 
 I told you not to forget to bring the letter . 
 I broke my sister's mirror . I'm sure it'll get her back up . I really don't know how I can escape the punishment . 
 My accountant thinks she can save me lots of money on my taxes this year . 
 How's it going ? 
 To be honest , I'm a bit fed up . 
 There's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around . 
 Sure , but how ? 
 But for what reasons ? She doesn't even know who I am . 
 Easier said than done . 
 But I always get tongue-tied when I see her . 
 I see . I'll try . 
 Excuse me . May I come in ? 
 i saw lily for the first time . and fell like i'v been struck by lightening.she is a girl of my dreams . i have a date with her on Friday , but i really can't decide what to do . 
 not bad , any other ideas ? 
 good idea . that ' s why i think i have culture . you have any other suggestions ? 
 They are good , but i still need a few more . 
 Cool , but what if the weather is not ideal ? 
 they are all good . 
 Hey , Andrew . How's everything with work ? 
 Really ? What's he been doing ? 
 Are you ? What are you busy with ? 
 Hey , Karen . Look like you got some sun this weekend . 
 That ’ s great . Where did you stay ? 
 So , what did you do out there ? I mean besides bask in the sun , obviously . 
 Not to mention cooler . Did you go swimming ? 
 It all sounds so relaxing . I wish I could get away to the beach like that . 
 Jenny , are you having fun here ? 
 I ’ m glad you ’ re enjoying it . 
 It ’ s my pleasure . Would you like another glass of champagne ? 
 Excuse me , do you know where the visa office is ? 
 Thanks . 
 I want to study abroad . 
 I hope to study English Literature . 
 Not yet . I have an interview with a visa official today . 
 No , I ’ Ve already been here for 3 interviews . 
 Yes , there is a lake in the park . It is very beautiful . 
 It ’ s a good idea . But I am afraid it ’ s too cold . It is very windy on the lake . 
 It is difficult for old people to do away with old ideas . 
 The government is making efforts to change situation . 
 The sun is up ! Time for all the campers to rise . Time to get paddling . 
 Do not worry . Today will be easier . 
 Today is Saturday . 
 Today is July 4th . 
 Call her on my cell phone . Wish her “ Happy Birthday ! ” Tell her you are out exploring the great American wilderness . Tell her I said she is lucky to be born on Independence Day . 
 It is December 25th . 
 Yes , I am lucky . I was born on Christ ’ s birthday . Maybe that is why I usually go to church on Sundays . When is your birthday ? 
 That is true ! Here , have some Granola for breakfast . 
 After eating , we will take down our tent . Then we will pack everything into the canoe , We can shove off by 6 
 How about going for swim around 10 
 Happy Independence Day ! 
 Very good ! Chinese food rules ! I expect the next time . 
 it's very nice . I haven't heard live music in a while . This is fun . 
 of course . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer ... 
 you're dancing so well . 
 when did you learn to dance ? 
 it's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz . 
 oh , I like it . It's such a beautiful dance , but I can't do it well . What about you ? 
 thank you for the dance . 
 ok . 
 Well , Mr . King is singing . 
 He ’ s standing on a ladder and banging some nails into the wall with a hammer . Now he ’ s hanging some strong strings on the nails . 
 She ’ s bringing something pink for Mr . King to drink . Now she ’ s putting it ... OK . 
 The ladder ’ s falling ? 
 He ’ s hanging from the string . He ’ s holding onto the string with his fingers and shouting to Mrs . King . 
 No , she ’ s running toward our house . That ’ s her ringing the bell . 
 Mr . Wilson , here's a present for you . 
 I hope you will like it . 
 Would you like to go to the theater with me tomorrow ? 
 That's coincidence , someone's just returned two tickets and I picked them . 
 Evening . 
 Stalls . 
 I need to find somewhere to park . 
 I need to find a space on campus . 
 Where is the parking structure at ? 
 Do you know if the parking structure is full or not ? 
 How long ago was that ? 
 Do you think it'll be full now ? 
 Shall we go to cinema this evening ? The new blockbuster starring mel gibson is showing . It ’ s supposed to be really good . 
 It ’ s a thriller . It has Julia Roberts playing the female lead . 
 What did the critic say ? 
 The movie starts at eight o ’ clock , so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready . 
 I won ’ t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . There were a few surprises . 
 are you serious ? 
 but why ? Did I do anything wrong ? 
 hey , come on . It ’ s too early to say that . We can fix things . 
 but I still love you . 
 I knew this would happen some day ... 
 well . It ’ s not all my fault , Anna ... 
 I would like that Anna , but I think I ’ ll need a little space for a bit . 
 shall we keep Our friendship ? 
 Our company's wei-ya is tomorrow night ! It's your first Chinese New Year in Taiwan--you must be excited ! 
 You have no idea ! There's a banquet with prizes , performances ... you name it ! 
 Well , I heard that last year Vivian from accounting won a new car ! 
 No , really ! And she told me the secret to winning , wear red underwear ! 
 Of course ! I'm not only going to wear red underwear , but I'm going to wear red socks and a red shirt , too ! 
 Have you ever witnessed any crimes or accidents ? 
 I was taking a walk in the park early this morning when suddenly I heard someone calling " help " . I rushed over and saw a man beating a woman . 
 I guess I was stunned for a moment , then I quickly ran away to get help . 
 Yes . Fortunately , I had my cell with me this morning . I called the police as I was running to get people to come to help . 
 It was terrific.The concert was really a hit.The symphony orchestra was so good that I was completely absorbed in their performance . 
 Oh , speaking of the conductor , he is indeed a genius.He did a perfect job.His name is Menuhin , a descendent of Russian American immigrants . 
 Absolutely right.He gave a performance of Felix Mendelssohn's violin concerto.That caused a sensation.The audience were stunned by his pure tone . 
 Yes , I did . 
 No , have they had another fight ? 
 You must be joking . Those two ? 
 So when did this all happen ? 
 Well , I believe it now , and when are they are getting married ? 
 I can hardly believe it . 
 Oh , come on.You ' Ve just started . 
 Yuck . The carrots taste awful and salty . Hi sis , how do you like them ? 
 Well , you can have all my carrots . 
 Nothing . Just that I don't care for these carrots.Hi , sis . , I saw you buy some chocolate cakes . I am done with the main course . It's about time for some dessert . 
 No , no , I'm just thinking of some dessert . And I have had enough carrots . 
 I know , but chocolate cake is even better . 
 Well , actually , I don't mind eating carrots , but chocolate cakes are much better . You know I was born with a sweet tooth . 
 Oh ! I heard that he loves to boss people around . 
 How did you know that I love red roses ? 
 ( at the dance ) That band is playing good music . Shall we dance ? 
 Foxtrot . Oh . you're a good dancer . 
 I prefer the old style of dance because I enjoy holding a pretty girl like you closely . 
 Good . 
 Do you mean this Saturday ? 
 Thanks for inviting me , Jack , but I ’ Ve already made plans for this weekend . I won ’ t be able to come , I ’ m afraid . 
 Yeah , that ’ s too bad . 
 Hey . I'm a visitor from China . I love your music . It's the best I've ever heard . Will you please spare a little bit of time for me ? 
 Oh , you wrote them all by yourself . That's amazing ! Are you a regular singer here ? 
 Cool . Your guitar skills are very impressive . How did you learn to play like that ? 
 Wow , that's unbelievable ! You play so well , but you've never been to a real teacher . You will definitely be famous in the near future . 
 Oh , I'm afraid I can't . I've had a date already . 
 Maybe some other time . 
 Oh , hello . I'm Bias Chettri . 
 Pleased to meet you too , Ms Jenson . 
 Thank you . Wow , your school has so many honors . Congratulations ! 
 Excuse me . I wonder see Dean Mr . Lee first . I was wondering if could you tell me where his office is ? 
 Excuse me ? 
 Thank you very much . It ’ s very kind of you . 
 This is it ? 
 Finding an excuse is obviously down your alley . And trying to avoid taking care of the children is what you are good at . 
 You are passing the buck . I'll be hanged if I ask you to go to the park with us . 
 Hi , Mr . Zhang . What ’ s wrong ? You don ’ t look so happy . How was your date ? 
 Me ? I ’ m even less experienced than you are . 
 Believe it or not , I guess American women like a man in good shape , which Chinese women may not care about so much . That ’ s my honest opinion . I know you have been trying very hard . 
 No , that ’ s not true . I ’ Ve met two American women who were married to Chinese . But those Chinese look very strong and healthy . So if you exercise more often , I bet it will surely be easier for you to date American girls . How old is Jacky Chan ? He ’ s small and short . But I bet he can have any American woman he wants . 
 Why don ’ t you try then ? Even if it doesn ’ t help you find an American girl , you could still have a stronger and healthier body . You won ’ t lose anything by doing that . 
 Why do you listen to rap ? 
 Heavy metal music is a lot different from rap music.You can dance to heavy metal . 
 I can't dance to it . And I know you can't either . Because I've seen you try . 
 Katherine ? Well , she's good at languages . 
 She knows how to speak Spanish and Japanese . 
 And she's good at sports , too . She knows how to play tennis and basketball . 
 But there's one thing she's not good at . 
 She's not good at remembering things . We have a date , and she's an hour late ! ! 
 Yes . I gotta review all of them for the final exam . It is just around the corner . 
 That depends . Some semesters have many , some don't . And some courses don't have exams but only ask for papers . That's easy . 
 Honestly speaking , most students prepare it one month before the exam . 
 Of course , it's useful . And it's very crucial to have the copies of teacher's notes , because most questions in the exam are based on them . 
 But the exam is not as simple as you may imagine . We have to stay up late . 
 Yes , some people even pack up his bed quilt and sleep there . That's a little bit crazy . 
 It's January . 
 I was born in Beijing , but I spent most of my childhood in London . 
 I had a pretty strict upbringing , and my parents taught at universities so they have extremely high expectations for me . 
 My parents wanted me to stay in Beijing , but I decided to go back to England . I graduated from University of Newcastle upon Tyne with a degree in Cross Culture Communication . 
 I am a journalist . I write for China Daily . 
 No , I didn ’ t . I started working at a university in London but as time went by , I found I did not really like my job . I decided to explore other fields . Journalism is great fit for me as well as a challenge . 
 Yes , I came to Beijing two years ago looking for new opportunities . I was lucky because my friend introduced me to my current company . 
 No , thank you . I've given up , you know . 
 Well , all tight . But you know , smoking does do harm to your health . 
 Why don't you try and give it up ? 
 Hey , Jordan , is that you ? Long time no see ! 
 Yeah , I think so ! I pledged Phi Iota Alpha , so I'm living at the frat house now . 
 Yeah , yeah , I know , it's totally cliche , but really , I think it's been a good decision . I've got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys . What about you ? What have you been up to ? 
 That sounds smart ... but kind of boring . 
 That's cool . Hey , so have you decided on your major yet ? 
 I still have no clue ... but we don't have to declare a major till our sophomore year , so I've got time ! Oops , I'm late for class . Gotta run ! 
 Yeah , you too ! 
 You are right . We shouldn't do anything under the table . 
 How did you get into hip hop ? 
 Who is your favorite hip hop artist ? 
 It ’ s over . 
 Our relationship . I mean my friend and I ... 
 The cause is another boy . 
 How did you do on your BELTS exam ? 
 That's excellent ! Have you received your conditional offers yet ? 
 Do you know where the visa office is ? 
 It's just near the Dong Si Shi Tiao subway stop . 
 Horowitz , I beg to differ . Even in your most recent study , the investigative approach was flawed ! You know as well as I do that the collection of data was not systematic , and there is a large margin of error . To draw a definitive conclusion based on that data would be misleading 
 You are trying to single-handedly solve one of the world ’ s greatest mysteries , and yet you are oblivious to the fact that you are wrong ! 
 No ! The egg came first ! 
 Maybe you two should go see a marriage counselor . 
 Not yet , Grandma , What's the matter ? 
 I'll finish soon . 
 All except the back door . I left that open for Tim . He took the dog for a walk . 
 Ok , I ’ m going to stay up awhile . I ’ Ve got to go over the household budget , We ‘ re a little over-spend this month . 
 Ok , Good night , see you at breakfast . 
 Not really , but I know it is very popular a traditional Chinese gambling game . 
 Typical Francis , whether you are at work , or engaged in leisure time activities , you always show the same eagerness and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself . 
 My German teacher thought it would be a good idea to have German pen friends to write to in German . 
 The only thing is that my pen friend will be writing in English . 
 That's right . And it's a B that I'll be writing too . Her name is Olga . 
 That's a great idea ! Why didn't I think of that ? 
 I just had a terrible week . 
 I fell down and hurt my arm . 
 Then my son drove into a tree 
 The dog bit the delivery boy . 
 And a storm blew our roof away . 
 Hi , Jenny . You look like you are in a hurry to somewhere . Where are you going ? 
 That's great . We can go to the bank together . 
 I will go to Japan on business for 5 days next Tuesday . I want to exchange some Japanese yen . 
 Not really . I plan to bring some cash and withdraw money at the ATM in Japan . 
 Nope . You can use the credit card to withdraw the money in foreign countries . 
 No . It is free of charge . 
 I think we are running out of time . The bank is going to close soon . 
 No . It's all Greek to me . 
 I know that . I mean I couldn't understand her at all . 
 I wish you the best of luck . 
 I ’ m very fond of you . 
 Why ? You mean a lot to me . 
 What question ? 
 You know that I care for you . I---I ’ m proud of you . 
 I---I don ’ t feel like saying it 
 I have many hobbies . I like almost all kinds of sports and I also like to listen to classical music . 
 I like playing basketball . Basketball is a very exciting game because it keeps you alert and I also enjoy the team spirit of basketball . 
 I like the novels of Dickens very much . I've read almost all of them in Chinese translation . 
 Yes , I like listening to Beethoven's works . 
 I like all kinds as long as they are exciting . 
 I am interested in watching TV or other relaxing games . 
 I usually read or entertain myself . 
 My favorite books are those about detectives . 
 When it comes to the entertainment , I think I enjoy dancing . There is nothing I like more than modern dance . 
 That ’ s an exception . But I am fed up with those who keep a straight face in front of me . 
 That means you don ’ t like them . If you hit it off with them , you will like to see their smiles . 
 Yeah.The autumn is marvelous here . 
 That's a hard time.The air is cold and damp , and the road is often icy . 
 Sure . 
 Plenty.We never worry about lack of rainwater in our area . 
 That's right . 
 Well , I ’ m favor of the Red Sox . They ’ Ve had a good season . 
 That ’ s not a very good pick . I ’ m against the Yankees . 
 Yeah , I ’ m with you on that . 
 What do the Romans do ? 
 In other words , the Romans do what everyone else does . 
 What do you mean ? 
 I envy them the sun . 
 I certainly do . 
 They always eat spaghetti and drink wine , don't they ? 
 Really ? How much does it cost to fly to Rome ? 
 What does your mother do , may I ask ? 
 Is she busy ? 
 Please fill out the form . 
 It's August the thirteenth . 
 Yes . 
 No problem . What should I bring ? 
 So , are you enjoying the performance so far ? 
 I think you're being a little critical . The actor in the lead role is fantastic . I suppose the chorus could be a bit better , though . 
 Actually , the woman playing Ophelia is a past classmate of mine . 
 That's only part of it . I absolutely adore this director . Every play he works on turns out great . 
 Quite a few actually . By the way , after the play , there's always a big party for the cast and their friends . My friend has invited us . Do you want to go ? 
 I've never had a part in a play before , but I used to be a part of the stage crew in high school . 
 I helped build the sets and find props for the plays . What about you ? 
 Why not ? 
 That sounds kind of boring . Oh , look . They're dimming the lights . I think we should get back to our seats for the second half of the play . 
 That ’ s very kind of you , but it ’ s nothing special . 
 Well , actually it ’ s just about luck . 
 Hey , guys . Ready for a pick-up game of touch football ? 
 C'mon , Yi-jun . It's lots of fun . You've seen football played on TV . 
 There's barely any contact in touch football . People just tag you to stop the play . 
 Hi , Cindy . I thought I ’ d missed you . 
 It ’ s all right . 
 I was in a comfortable place , so really , it ’ s no problem . I am happy to see you . Did the rain hold you up long ? 
 I totally understand . 
 Don't mention it . The thesis due date is coming , but my thesis isn't even close to being done . 
 Don't worry . Anyway , you are better than me . 
 Are you thinking about a public school or a private one ? 
 Public schools are usually state funded , whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere . 
 One isn ’ t necessarily better than the other . It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers . 
 Yes , sometimes . 
 I'm planning to go to graduate school , but I also want to find a job . Otherwise , I'll have nowhere to go if I fail the entrance exam . 
 career path ? I'm not sure . 
 I want to become a professor , a lawyer , an editor , a civil servant ... 
 I don't know . Do you have any advice for me ? 
 I think perhaps I need to buy a few years while I figure out about my career . 
 thank you so much for your advice . I'll think it over . 
 Well , they look lovely , but they ’ re not very practical . I mean , would you wear that dress to the office or walking down the street ? 
 Maybe . I ’ m not sure why they have fashion shows like this . Hardly anyone will buy those clothes . The clothes you see are nothing like the ones that ordinary people wear . It seems like a waste of money . 
 You meant it ’ s an expression of their fantasies ? 
 Very philosophical . I think they design these clothes more for publicity . They try to see who can be the most extreme and outrageous , but still stylish . 
 David , I ’ m going to China . 
 You know . I took part in the Chinese contest . I was the best and they gave me this reward . I don ’ t have to pay for my trip . 
 Thank you . I ’ m leaving tomorrow morning . 
 I ’ m sure I will . 
 Thank you , David . 
 Sure . I am free tomorrow . It sounds interesting to me . Can we buy the ticket online ? 
 I guess that is the thing we can do with we really want to visit the museum . 
 Yeah . We are lucky . Let's go buy the tickets first . We can have breakfast later . I am so hungry . 
 ( After the breakfast ) Which floor is the art exhibition we are going to ? 
 Sure , take your time . We have a whole day . 
 Look at the museum guide.It says there are also some sculptures and potteries in this area . Let's rent an audio guide . 
 Good afternoon ! Sit down , please.How are you ? 
 Very well too , thank you very much.Isn ' t it a lovely day ? 
 Yes . 
 Mm ... It's quite warm now . 
 In London.Where do you live ? 
 I've been looking forward to the new semester . 
 Hope so . 
 Really ? I hope we will do much better under her guidance . 
 Post office offer lots of services nowadays , don ’ t they ? Years age , you only really used the post office to send mail , save money , and send or collect money . 
 I save money in a post office saving account . There used to be just one kind of account , but now there are several . They each have different conditions and interest rates . 
 Post offices are still the place to go to collect welfare benefits , like unemployment benefit and child support benefit . The queue are very long on the days when people collect those payment . 
 Do you think that the service at post offices has improved ? 
 I like being able to buy newspapers and magazines at the post office . It means that I don ’ t need to go to two places 
 Well , it's just that she put a lot of makeup on her face . Actually , natural beauty comes from within . 
 She has nothing that deserves my jealousy . I don't have to put things on my face and I still look pretty . Don't you think so ? 
 They are cucumbers . They are natural skin soothers , natural healers of the skin.Haven ' t you heard them say on TV that ... eh ... they soften the skin , wipe out the roughness , counter irritation and build strength and resilience ? 
 That's right . You have learned a lot , haven't you ? 
 He is an all-right guy . I have no bone to pick with him . 
 But he is not a fine wether friend who could sell you down the river . 
 Depends on with whom . He may be doing things on the sly , but he is honest with me . I trust him . 
 Welcome ! Welcome to Little Italy . We're the most Italian family here ! 
 If I hadn't married an Italian man , I probably wouldn't be pregnant so often . And maybe I could raise pigs instead of bambinos ! 
 It is nice , but it would be nicer if my macho husband would get off his tush and help me . Ha-ha ... Have this . It's from Italy ! 
 It was the pilot putting the wheels down.We must be coming into land.Are you frightened ? 
 Two people were robbed last night near the park . 
 I am afraid of the dark . I don ’ t feel safe in the dark . I feel someone is hiding in the dark to attack me . 
 I Know . And you should be more careful , too . 
 It's certainly a tight schedule . 
 At what time ? 
 Do you know how far you will be from the airport at 5 ? 
 So you are not sure how long it will take to get there ? 
 Don't forget it's Friday nighty . If Frankfurt's anything like London , everybody will be leaving for the weekend . It will be a rush hour and traffic might be moving very slowly . 
 I am a realist . 
 What vehicle do you usually bring to school ? Is it an automobile or a motorbike ? 
 OK . That means you can park in the student lot or on the street . Have you seen the handicapped spots ? 
 Look for the blue signs and blue marked spaces . Do you usually park in the daytime or the evening ? 
 Be careful about the time limits on the streets . Have you seen the signs for time limits ? 
 As long as you are careful reading the signs , you will always know how long you can park and what days are OK to park there . Are you aware of the curb colors ? 
 If you can remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means that you can only load and unload , you are going to be OK . 
 I would like to . but I'm not good at it . 
 That's great ! When will we go ? 
 All right . What should I take ? 
 Thanks . I will wait you at my home . 
 Hi , Mike , what gives ? 
 Hey , great set of wheels . 
 Who wouldn't ? Wow , that's out of this world . 
 Yeah , too cool . How much did they sold you for ? 
 I can imagine . 
 I'd love to . 
 Would you like to go to the natural history museum with me ? 
 Yes , lots of time . I was quite impressed by the wide variety of exhibitions they have . 
 Oh , my god ! My wallet is lost . What should I do ? It drives me bonkers . 
 Good morning , Mr.Jones ! 
 Nice to see you again . 
 How is everything ? 
 Quite well , thank you . 
 No , I was driven by my husband . 
 Yes , thanks . 
 No , the meeting will be held on the fourth floor . 
 Yes , the snow is often falling thick and fast here . 
 Yes , It's really so beautiful with all the things covered by snow . 
 There are so many places around . Take a look at the advertisement . 
 Great ! I went hiking in the mountains on Saturday . 
 Really good ! you should try it sometime . 
 Uh , nothing much , just went to bed early . I was still tired from Saturday . 
 I heard about that . It was successful . 
 I should say , it stunned me . I can't imagine what they will think of next . 
 Oh , I know . She is a famous woman and a focus of the newspaper now because of this thing . 
 Yes . Do you know its name . 
 Oh , I think she wants to do this thing in memory of her father . 
 I'm planing to go bolling tonight.Tomorrow I was hoping to see a movie.What about you ? 
 Why not ? 
 OK , Mr . Wu . You may come in . I'm Anne Smith and on my right , my colleague , Anna Duncan , and on my left , Angela Lamb . Do please sit down . 
 Your English is fluent . 
 How do you think of the weather today ? 
 Hello , Betty , how are you ? 
 Just fine , thank you.How ' s your father today ? 
 I'm glad to hear that.Bye . 
 I am so happy to know that the promotion campaign for our new product is very successful . We just made a record sale this season . 
 It is not an easy job . How do you like the advertisement for the new product ? 
 Certainly . 
 But , Bob , we were so good together . 
 I don't understand . We were getting along so well . 
 No , I don't like it very much . Do you ? 
 Oh , does he play the piano ? 
 I like rock a lot . 
 The Cranberries . I love their music . How about you ? Do you like them ? 
 Ugh . Another advertisement . They ’ Ve added two hours of advertisements to a two hours movie . 
 Why are we watching it anyway ? 
 True . True . 
 Really ? Did Coke pay him for that ? 
 You want something to drink ? 
 Sure . 
 Good morning ! 
 I slept like a baby . I fell asleep right away last night , didn't wake up once , and didn't have any nightmares ! 
 I feel much better , but I'm still worried about something . 
 Well , I have to drive to school for a meeting this morning , and I'm going to end up getting stuck in rush-hour traffic . 
 For me , traffic jams are quite stressful , because I'm pretty impatient . How can I prevent myself from getting stressed if I get stuck in a traffic jam ? 
 Ok , I'll try that . 
 Just one more thing . A school called me this morning to see if I could teach a few classes this weekend and I don't know what to do . 
 I'm supposed to work on a paper that'd due on Monday . 
 You're right . I probably should just work on my paper . Thanks ! 
 Of course not . People all over the world watch it on TV , or listen to it on the radio . 
 Yes , I went to the New Year ’ s Concert in 2010 . 
 That's for sure . You know , I had the greatest time ever . 
 We actually met at a dance party . He fell for me . 
 He said that I put all other girls in the shade . 
 Well , he indeed likes me . 
 No , he is the sort of man who likes to hide his candle under a bushel . 
 I heard it has been finally settled under the rose . 
 Yeah , fortunately it did not cause a disaster . 
 is this line for non-residents ? 
 Ok . Here's my passport . 
 I think it's soon , maybe in a few months . It was renewed in Beijing , so the new expiry date is on the last page . 
 I won't . 
 no , I don't have anything to declare . 
 I'll be here for about a year . 
 I'll be studying . I'm doing an MBA at Nottingham University . 
 I have a housing contract with the university . I'll be in a dorm room on campus . 
 my father has already paid for that in advance . Here are the receipts . 
 thank you very much . 
 Well , you'll see . With this new watch , I can go anywhere , do anything . 
 No , really . Look . It's got a double time zone setting . 
 Yep . I just can't decide what two cities to choose ... 
 Going to the cafeteria ? 
 That ’ s fine with me . I don ’ t hate vegetables and I don ’ t eat much during lunch . 
 I am going to give you an end-of-the-unit test this Friday . Please be prepared for it . 
 Review all the lessons in this unit and see if you can understand the main idea of each lesson . 
 Phrases and sentence patterns are also very important . You should know how to use them . 
 Certainly . 
 Well . When you review your lessons , mark the places which you don't understand , then I will give you some coaching . 
 How about tomorrow ? 
 What do you think of smoking ? 
 What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ? 
 But that'll affect the national economy . 
 How about printing a warning on each cigarette packet ? 
 Are you ready ? 
 Who can tell us something about the author's life ? Volunteer ? 
 Very good . Sit down , please . Susan , what's the general idea of the text ? 
 No , you can't . This is an English class , and you have to express yourself in English . 
 Excellent . Class is over . Let's have a break . 
 yes , my brothe and I are going . We just finished making our itinerary . 
 great minds think alike . My brother and I have been thinking about going to Tibet for quite a long time . Do you have anything on your schedule ? 
 why don't you join us ? We are leaving next week ; you'll still have a week to prepare . 
 come on ! We're traveling on our own . It won't cost too much . 
 the youth hotels are comfortable and cheap . 
 I'll take care of it . 
 no problem . 
 Certainly.Here ’ s an application form.Do you have proof of residence ? 
 A driver ’ s license or something showing that you live in this city . 
 Do you have a current electricity or gas bill in your name ? 
 That ’ ll do.Bring the most recent one in with your completed application , and we ’ ll issue you a temporary library card right away . 
 It ’ ll be mailed to you within two weeks , but you can borrow books on the temporary card . 
 See you later , alligator . 
 How did you meet your boyfriend , Cindy ? 
 Who made the first move ? 
 Wow ! 
 What do your parents think of your dating a boy ? 
 They're glad ? ! 
 Hello , Karl . I ’ m Chuck Jones . We ’ re going to be neighbors . 
 This is a small town , and we like to be neighborly . We know everyone who lives around here . 
 So , tell me , Karl , hyoid you come all the way to Minnesota to live ? 
 I hear that you are in love with Mike . 
 Don't you hit it off ? 
 Are you going to tell me about the stamp , or not ? 
 I'm just asking . It's not like I'd actually make a bid . 
 Don't worry . I won't . 
 Have fun getting ripped off ! 
 Yeah , he came back from America last week . 
 He must have a good ear . 
 Well , I am certainly going to take chemistry and physics , but I haven't decided on the other subjects yet . I ’ d like to take English . 
 Because I want to study English literature . But I think chemistry is better for getting a job . 
 I am going to be a , well , I hope to be a research chemist . 
 Yes , she does . She works at home . 
 Oh , no . Most of the time I do these things . She is a writer . 
 What kind of movies do you like , Sue ? 
 Just like my wife . So , what ’ s your favorite movie ? 
 Yeah , my wife likes that one , too . Personally , I prefer action movies . 
 About my boyfriend . 
 You are really a wet blanket . 
 Actually , a friend of a friend . 
 Alecia . 
 Thanks . They look delicious . 
 That would be great . I would love some . 
 Well . I like them a little heavier . I don't have as much control , usually bowling straight , but the extra momentum compensates for that . 
 Well done . You got them all . You get 10 points and your next two bowls are added to this frame's score . I'II dry my ball off and try to knock them all down as well . 
 I certainly can try ... No ! It went straight through the wickets . 
 That is a part of chinese culture , if they think you are a lovely child , they touch your head and say , how cute you are . 
 Well , you get used to it , different countries have different manners . 
 They are just been in friendly , when you are in Roman , do as the Romans do , that means you need to adapt to your enviroment . 
 Then you might need to pretend to be a little crazy . 
 Do you think it is a ~ got give your brain , use it if you really cannot accept it people touch your head , keep distance from them , why not just wear your big flyby hat and ~ is anyone get close to you . 
 can I use your laptop for a while ? 
 oh , isn't your computer Wi-Fi capable ? 
 oh my , no internet access is killing me . 
 no , I'm not feeling myself . I just want to check my emails , visit my favorite websites and chat with my friends . 
 what does that mean ? there's nothing wrong with me . 
 that's alright . I just can't bear losing track of all the latest information . It almost drives me crazy . 
 so , how's your course going ? Do you like it ? 
 what are you specializing in ? 
 that sounds really interesting . Can you speak Swahili ? 
 really ? How did you do that ? 
 that's amazing . Are you doing well in your classes ? 
 when did you take your exams ? 
 how do you think you did ? 
 I'm sure you'll do well . Did you study hard ? 
 don't worry . If you don't do well , no one can ! 
 Ah ! No ! Damn it ! 
 So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work . 
 No , I didn't save this time.Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too . 
 I hate computers . Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth . 
 I don't know . I feel like going out . 
 It doesn't matter . I still can go out and buy a beer . 
 Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework.This is a bad time for this to happen . 
 Mr . Brown , are your children always kicking up a row like this ? I cannot concentrate on my paper . 
 I ’ m afraid if the noise goes on , I shall have no alternative but to leave . 
 You mustn't touch the wet paint , Bill . 
 Try to be more careful in future . 
 The workmen oughtn't to leave it without a no tice . 
 Then why isn't there a notice ? 
 But look at them ! They've forgotten about the wet cement and they're walking across it to put up the notice ! 
 I couldn't do that . I have an important meeting to go to today . 
 not really . After a 12 - hour flight , I've got jetlag , and on top of that , I think I've also got the flu . 
 could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever ? 
 ok . I'll stay home this morning and rest , but if I feel better in the afternoon , I'm going to the meeting . 
 I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing . 
 just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks . 
 shouldn't we make an appointment first ? 
 whatever you say . I just want to get to my meeting ! 
 I'm still a student . 
 Boston University . 
 I'm studying English , math , and history . My major is English . 
 More than six years . 
 Yeah , I started to learn English when I was in high school . 
 Actually , it's not that good . I can read but I can't speak very well . I haven't had a lot of chance to practice . 
 Yes , but I still don't have many friends here yet . 
 Oh thanks for inviting me . I'd love to come . 
 Is it a horror movie ? 
 No way . I will be scared out of my wits . 
 Hey , how would you like to taste my fist ? 
 Um , let me see , romance , comedy . documentary , action , science fiction , animated and so on . 
 Yeah . It seems like we don't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned . 
 The Notebook is this type of movie . 
 Well then , this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together . I bet you'd love it . 
 Wow , there are so many lanterns to appreciate . Now , I can see why it's called the Lantern Festival . It deserves its name . 
 What are they doing over there ? People keep on gathering there . 
 Sure . But you know that I can't read any Chinese characters . What do they say ? 
 Very interesting . But I'm afraid we'd better do something else . Hey , look ! There is a huge lantern there . Let's get close to it . 
 Really ? Then I'm really lucky . Oh , it's spewing fireworks from its huge mouth . 
 There are many Chinese characters on its body , too . What are they about ? Puzzles ? 
 He is so kind . I couldn ’ t believe he murdered his wife . 
 I don ’ t understand . 
 You always stick to your PC recently . Are you still fascinated by chatting on line ? 
 What the hell are you doing now ? 
 What's new with you ? 
 Of course , he was our monitor in college . How is him now ? 
 Let me see . What a moving poem ! 
 Sure , I'm looking forward to it . 
 I'll get used to not seeing my parents . 
 Good . How about you ? 
 But your company is huge . Can't they afford to pay the staff decent wages . 
 That's shortsighted . By the time the workers are experienced and contributing . They are likely to go . 
 But you have already worked there for five years . 
 Well . The management doesn't seem to think that way . Anyways , you have to think twice before you act . 
 I ’ m so excited , mother . Oh , a new baby ! 
 And my first nephew . He looks a lot like you , mum . He does . 
 Yes , he does have Richard ’ s eyes . The baby even looks like you than Richard does . 
 It ’ s true . Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways . And she is shy with new people just like he is . 
 You ’ re right . 
 Hello.May I speak to Mark , please ? 
 Hello , this is Mark speaking . 
 Oh , we had a birthday party for David last night . As a matter of fact I woke up with a terrible hangover . 
 Anything new at the office ? 
 That's wonderful ! We've got to celebrate ! 
 Sure . I ought to be ready for some more drinks by then.Thank you for calling . 
 what kind of music do you like listening to ? 
 yes , I do . I find it very relaxing . I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work . 
 classical music is supposed to be good for you brain . Research suggest that it makes your brain more active . Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better . 
 yes . That ’ s why I listen to it in the evenings . I usually play it as background music while I ’ m cooking or doing other housework . 
 you can find plenty of recording on the internet too . You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them . 
 that ’ s true . There ’ s clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people . Music can influence a person ’ s feeling and character . 
 Oh ! What a beautiful dress ! It fits you so well.You look so charming in the dress . 
 Where did you buy it ? 
 How much is it ? 
 It's so cheap . I'll buy one , too . 
 Yeah , I ’ Ve just moved here , and I ’ d like to activate my cell phone , and I ’ m not sure if I should go with a prepaid plan , or a monthly rate plan . 
 What ? Really ? I don ’ t really want to have to buy a new phone . 
 Really ? What ’ s the catch ? 
 So what does this plan include ? 
 Wow , all this for forty dollars per month ? 
 Excuse me , Professor , I have a problem and need to leave class early . 
 I am not feeling well . 
 Yes , it's all taken care of . 
 I can stay a few more minutes . 
 Thanks , Professor . I've got it covered ! 
 When he told me I had to work overtime , that was it . 
 Yes , he's really pushed me too far . 
 Paul sends you his regards . 
 Do you think I still fashionable in this dress ? 
 This style came out last year , though . I like the dress , but I ’ m not sure whether last year ’ s fashions will be same this year . 
 Yes . Only the top designer try to tell people to change fashion every year , but only rich people can do it . 
 I wish I could be one of those people , but my budget simply doesn ’ t stretch that far . I have to limit the amount of money I spend on clothes otherwise I would go on a shopping frenzy . 
 He has a girlfriend already . 
 His new girlfriend is a far cry from Ann . She is like a breath of fresh air . 
 Why , Tom ? It's five to six already and you are still writing here . 
 Yes , have you forgotten ? We have arranged to go to Mary's to watch some videos tonight . 
 What's the matter with you ? You are the one that persuaded all of us to go there . 
 Oh ... I am really worried about the exam . I have no idea what will be on it . 
 Yes , but my notes are all nonsense . I can't figure out what is important . 
 Yes . 
 What do you mean ? You think I don't write enough . 
 I know , but I listened . 
 I suppose you're right . But what can I do ? I don't know what to write down . 
 That would really help me , Sue . I appreciate it . All this makes me feel like an idiot . 
 Alright . University and high school seem very different to me . I suppose I just need to learn how to manage lecture classes . Then I will do better . 
 Stephany said she would go out with me . 
 That ’ s in one month , and besides , this is a group date with all of our friends . 
 We ’ re going fishing . 
 These girls are different , they are not wimpy . 
 What's her last name ? 
 What color are her eyes ? 
 What color is her hair ? 
 How old is she ? 
 Are you ok ? You seem a bit anxious . 
 So you mean you feel ecstatic one minute and then blue the next ? 
 Well , maybe your mood will swing positively and you will feel confident , brave and hopeful ! 
 Look ! This picture of Mom in her cap and gown . 
 Yes , we are very proud of her . 
 Surely , I'll have one made for you . You want a print ? 
 I'd like to see that myself . 
 Certainly . 
 I Couldn't care less . 
 Study English . 
 It gives me great satisfaction . 
 I don't mind the work . I think it's worthwhile . 
 No , I'm full . 
 Yes , I'd like some coffee . 
 That's OK . I'll have a glass of water . 
 Small please . 
 Thanks . 
 How long have you been in this company ? 
 You must have found much difference between working in company and studying in college . 
 Well , you ’ Ve adapted yourself very well . Everyone in our office thinks you ’ Ve made a great progress in the past two years . What is your secret ? 
 Are you there , Mary ? 
 How much is my stamp ? 
 Don't get ahead of yourself . Fat boy isn't yours yet . 
 What did you say ? 
 Then he become angry with you ? 
 Professor Wang looks so handsome today . He is wearing a light brown suit and a pink tie . 
 He ’ s quite particular about what he wears , especially about his ties . He gets different tie each day . 
 The tie is necessary for man . It makes you look so attractive in a super tie . 
 My father dose not know how to tie a tie , for he often wears a cravat . 
 You mother is not only a patient mother but also a gentle wife . 
 What is a tornado warning ? 
 Really ? In New Berlin ? 
 I understand . They think a tornado might come . 
 And the second stage is called a " tornado warning " . 
 It's scary . 
 What do you mean " a loud train " ? 
 But if you hear them coming , isn't it already too late ? 
 Have you seen a lot of them ? 
 Did it hit their house ? 
 What were they doing when you called ? 
 That's terrible . Do many people die in tornadoes ? 
 Actually the general manager is regarded as a baby doll . He has much sympathy . 
 Were you one of them ? 
 You know that this afternoon's meeting is cancelled , right ? 
 I sent out a notice . You've stopped checking your e-mail ? 
 How obnoxious ! I heard he was sending you dirty jokes . 
 Stop running around in front of the TV , will you ? Why don ’ t you just sit and watch ? 
 Then stay away . Nobody's keeping you from doing that . 
 All right , I will explain it to you later on . Now scram . 
 That's exactly what I want , thank you . 
 Pretty well . I don't know if I'll get the promotion or not , but I feel good about it . 
 If I get the promotion , I will be a senior engineer instead of an assistant engineer . 
 Whenever you are given added responsibilities , you should get a promotion . 
 My boss . 
 She asked me about my ability to work in a team and what I thought a good boss should be . 
 I told her that I'm an excellent team player and that a good boss should treat male and female employees equally . 
 She told me that even when I become a senior engineer , I'll have to work with the assistant engineers as a team . 
 She's pretty easy to get along with . She listens to her employees and treats everyone equally . 
 That's true . She's highly esteemed among everyone at my company . 
 I will do . 
 It's my geography , sir . The Map of Africa you set us . 
 Yes , I know , sir . I'm sorry . 
 My mother's been ill and I had to stay at home . 
 It's true , sir . 
 I would need to check on that . Where is the fundraiser ? 
 What day will you need it for ? 
 Maybe that could work . I need to know who will be driving it . 
 If I give you the keys to the garage , could you bring it back on Sunday evening ? 
 OK , but make sure that everything is back by Sunday night at the latest . 
 Oh , it ’ s Death on the Nile . Have you read it ? 
 Sure . I didn ’ t know you liked mysteries . 
 Who are those guys ? 
 Oh . 
 All right ! 
 Wow , Michael Jordan ’ s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch . 
 Which team do you think will win ? 
 How are your parents these days ? 
 Oh , good . That's nice to hear . Please give my best regards to them when you're home . 
 Those are the headlines for today , and now for the international weather report with Mike Sanderson . 
 Not a great week for the world ! Any good news ? 
 Happy Anniversary , honey . 
 After the trouble I got into last year , no way . 
 I am fed up with Jack . He is so weak in dealing with other people and always eats dirt . 
 How do you know that I didn ’ t try ? I just couldn ’ t manage it . 
 What's her figure ? 
 What's the color of her eyes ? 
 how old is she ? 
 Excuse me . Is anyone in that seat next to you ? 
 Do you mind if I put my jacket there ? 
 Yes . And you ? 
 Well , there are many Chinese Americans , you know.And your English is very good . You sound like an American . 
 No , really . I can only hear a little accent . 
 Well , yes . Actually , I'm going back to visit . 
 No , I'm going back to America to visit . I'm from America , but I don't live there now . I live in Taichung . 
 Yes . Why not ? 
 Sure . I teach history in a university . Have you heard of Dong-Hai University ? 
 I have lived in Taichung for two years now.So this is the second time I am going back to states . I go back once a year to visit my family . 
 No , it isn't strange at all.Many people from Taiwan move to America too , you know.Do you think it is strange for them ? 
 Are you new here ? 
 Are you a freshman in college ? 
 What school did you transfer from ? 
 What made you transfer ? 
 Did you like PCC ? 
 Good luck here . 
 The band is pretty good . How do you like the music ? 
 Well , then , may I invite you for the next dance ? 
 Don't worry . I'm not much of a dancer myself . 
 You dance beautifully too . 
 In college . But I don't dance very often . What's your favourite dance ? 
 Li Lei , can you tell me what the origin of Easter is ? 
 Oh , then when do you celebrate Easter ? 
 How do you celebrate it ? 
 That sounds interesting . 
 Morning , Jenny . Haven't seen you for ages ! 
 You did give me a surprise . How have you been ? 
 Not so well . I've come down with the flu . 
 It's really great to see you again . How about a drink tonight ? 
 How about seven ? 
 I'll pick you up . 
 My son came home from three years in the navy . 
 Yeah . We rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home . 
 Sports . 
 Basketball and swimming . 
 yeah , and most excitingly , I met the girl living under me today . She's really nice . 
 yeah , and most importantly , she's single ! Man , I could tell from the moment I saw her , she's the girl of my dreams ! 
 I don't know . I am not really worried about that . I don't wanna lose before even starting . Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her . 
 not yet . But I am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime . I know some good restaurants nearby . 
 you bet . Now that you mentioned it , I think I'll call her now and see if she is available tonight . 
 thanks ! 
 Hello , Hong Lei . My name's Ricky . 
 Yes , I had my first lesson this morning . Are you a new student too ? 
 Six months . That's a long time . 
 Intermediate Three . And what about you ? 
 I can't remember her name , but she's got curly red hair . 
 Yes , I think so . 
 Yes that's right . Do you know her ? Is she your teacher too ? 
 Only a week . 
 Well , I'm staying at the YMCA at the moment . I'm looking for somewhere more permanent . Do you know of any good places ? 
 That would be great ! Thanks for your help . Can I buy you coffee ? 
 What is it ? 
 Yes . 
 Really ? That's fantastic ! Will you get a chance to do any writing ? 
 Wow ! That's really great news . How often does the magazine come out ? 
 Are you looking forward to doing more editing work ? 
 Do you have any order forms here so that I can get a subscription to the magazine ? 
 I'm really looking forward to reading your column . 
 Sure , where would you like to go ? 
 I don't think the teacher had a right to say that.The teacher was wrong to have accused her in front of the whole class . 
 I agree she had the right to say something , but I feel she should have done it privately . 
 Welcome ! Sophia told us you were coming ! 
 Thank you ! Your cheeks are as red as a tomato ! Are you shy ? 
 Some of my grappa will cure your shyness . 
 It's a clear spirit we drink any time of the day . You will love it ! 
 Who wants to go first ? Allen ? 
 OK . Put on something by the Backstreet Boys ! 
 I'd better not . Brooke hates the Backstreet Boys ! 
 Yes , I am . What's wrong ? 
 OK . No problem . 
 But it's said that you dance wonderfully well . 
 No . Just occasionally . 
 I love rumba and waltz . 
 To tell the truth , I don't like it . It's too fast . 
 OK . See you then . 
 I would like to watch the Oscars on Tv tonight . How about you ? 
 I like watching it for the fashion . I like to see what the ladies are wearing . Of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo . 
 I'm really not sure . Usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders . 
 You might think this strange , but I like the category for “ best foreign language film " . 
 You won ’ t believe who ’ s been elected to do overtime on the Baker account ! Me ! I ’ Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime ! 
 They were supposed to , but so far nobody ’ s turned up , and I ’ m left on my own to do the work . This is the first break I ’ Ve had all day .

 Jimmy , I ’ d like to wear this robe for tonight cocktail party . What do you think of it ? 
 What ? But it is my favorite piece of clothing . 
 What am I going to do ? 
 Would you like to come out with me tonight ? 
 Tomorrow night , then ? 
 I was wondering if you like to go to the theatre then . 
 Ok . How about give me a ring , then ? 
 Why not ? 
 I don't know what to do , if I can't find the money . 
 It's a large sum of money . I can't afford to lose it . 
 Why ? Are you planning to stir-fry my face ? 
 You've gone bonkers , Jen . 
 OK . Let's see . Give me a sheet . 
 Not because I ’ m keeping an eye on the baby . 
 She is at the supermarket downstairs . She said she would be back in about half an hour . 
 What a good idea ! 
 OK . 
 But the ref didn't whistle . 
 Anyway , the host team seems to fight for the gold . 
 There were some bad misses in his defence , so he lost it . 
 I suppose he's not in top form . 
 You ’ re leaving so soon . When are you off ? 
 How about I come and see you off ? 
 Ok . I ’ ll miss you . I hope we can see each other again soon . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Ok . Take care . I hope you have a good journey . 
 Of course . I will . 
 How ’ s your father ? 
 He can spend more time with his grandchildren . 
 So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea ! 
 In the same way , probably . 
 Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired . 
 With everything , with everybody , with all this ! 
 It wasn't always like this , you know . 
 Well , I mean.We always do the same thing.There ' s no variety in our lives . 
 Certainly , perhaps . 
 Yes . I did . 
 Let's take a coffee break . 
 The Canada Day is on the 1st of July . 
 The national anthem of Canada is ' O Canada ' . 
 Yes , I could sing it when I was very young . 
 Yes , it's not like what the radio said at all . 
 As long as it doesn't snow ! 
 In just three weeks , and I am excited . But there are still a few things I need to do before I go . 
 Like renewing my passport , going to the travel agency to buy my plane ticket and figuring out what to do with my apartment while I'm gone . 
 No way . I'll never find another apartment around here . But I don't like the idea of paying three months ' rent on an empty apartment , either . 
 Yes , but whom to ? 
 That's exactly when I'll be away . It sounds ideal , as long as the landlord agrees . 
 Well , thanks , Bill . Let me know what happens . That extra money will really come in handy . 
 Perfect . Couldn't be better . 
 Of course you can . ( Lead Carl to his garage . ) 
 My car is simply a daisy . It drives smoothly . 
 I am glad to hear that . I'm really pleased with it . 
 Could you tell me the right time , please ? 
 You'll have to get it fixed . 
 How's your business ? 
 Things are tough all over . You should never give up ! 
 I think you should make a thorough market investigation now . 
 I always consider you are such a guy who never gives up . 
 Yeah , you can make it . 
 Pretty good . I ’ Ve just had my new poems published . 
 Thank you . 
 He is fine . 
 Yes . He ’ s already got the passport and visa . 
 Thank you . He ’ s very lucky indeed . 
 I advise you to take an additional course in some Chinese schools . 
 This kind of school is good at helping people to improve their Chinese . 
 Sure . You can review the lessons you have learned at school and learn something new there . 
 It's raining outside , Catherine , it's too bad.What ' s the weather like in your hometown ? 
 Do you like the weather in Seattle ? 
 Why ? 
 What about the weather in Boston ? 
 Is it very cold in winter ? 
 God , I didn ’ t realize . I didn ’ t , I didn ’ t know ... 
 Excuse me ? 
 You were spying on me , weren ’ t you ? You probably rented those children . 
 Because I am your competition which you know perfectly well , or you would not put up that sign just around the corner . 
 What is that ? What are you doing ? You ’ re taking all the caviar ! That caviar is a garnish ? 
 Hi , do you know what ’ s for dinner ? I ’ m starving . 
 Out ? What do you mean out ? 
 Dad and mom ? 
 You mean this is going to be a regular thing ? 
 Have you been in America long , Hellen ? 
 Where are you going to study ? 
 What are you going to major in ? 
 For nearly four years . 
 That's right . And I'm going to be Vice President of Marketing . 
 You can say that again ! 
 They work for Zina now . 
 They're in awe of her . After they saw how she crushed WebTracker ... but I guess you know all about that . 
 I'd love to . 
 That's OK with me . 
 Yes . The videographer has already started filming my parents trying to speak English with the flight attendants . 
 It'll be the year 2000 ! The flight attendants are coming over here . They're carrying bottles of champagne ! 
 Time for what ? 
 You mean get married now ? On the plane ? 
 I don't know what to say , Jack ! 
 May I help you ? 
 May I do anything else for you ? 
 Will that be all ? 
 Do you have your library card ? 
 Will that be all for today ? 
 These books are due back in two weeks . 
 Suit wrote me a letter . 
 She got a master degree , and now she is going for her doctor . 
 It's not a surprise , is it ? She has always been a hard working student . 
 I am sorry . I ’ Ve left my disk at home . 
 Let ’ s go to the seashore on Saturday . 
 It ’ s expensive , too . Let ’ s just sit in the sun and go swimming instead . 
 Dou you think I should join a basketball team , Mary ? 
 But I'm afraid it will take too much of my time . 
 Em , you ’ re right . 
 But I see things rather differently.The heroin is not attractive and her acting is just so-so . 
 Congratulations ! You've just won a car ! 
 How are your wedding plans going ? 
 When will your wedding take place ? 
 It will be a large church one . Is your wedding dress ready ? 
 You will be very beautiful on your wedding day . 
 Which hotel will the reception be held at ? 
 It's excellent . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . 
 I think you made the right decision . 
 Hi . Steven . I just drop in and want to have a chat with you . 
 OK . ( Sit on the sofa ) Wow ! Your house was decorated so beautiful . 
 She must have done a lot of work on it . 
 Hey ! What's up ? 
 Yeah , I've been out of town . 
 Great ! Work is really busy now , but it's fun . 
 Why ? 
 Really ? Congratulations . 
 I needed some money , so I hocked it last week . 
 I had just enough money to make ends meet until payday . Then last Wednesday I received a phone bill to the tune of $ 195.00 . I hit the ceiling when I saw that . 
 I'd forgotten that my brother had used my phone earlier this month to call his girlfriend . He forgot to mention that she happened to be in New York at the time 3000 miles away . 
 Thanks , but tomorrow's payday I can make until then . Thanks any-way . 
 Not much really . It's more of an American tradition , so back home we don't really celebrate it . In fact , I am not even sure of what exactly is being celebrated ! 
 Yeah but , how did this holiday come to be ? 
 And then what did happen ? 
 Interesting ! I am amazed how big and delicious thanksgiving dinners are ! 
 Count me in ! 
 It's so quiet . I'm not really used to it . 
 It's a little eerie . I'm sure the silence will begin to grow on me . 
 That is a relief . It's a good thing we moved . 
 No . That's not why I raised my hand . I need to go to the ladies ' room . 
 What's a hall pass ? 
 I see . 
 Or else I'll get into trouble . 
 What do you think of the speech the man delivered just now ? 
 We cannot expect politics to be true anyway . 
 So , you friend ’ s getting married on Saturday . What have you bought her as a wedding gift . I find is so hard to choose the right gift . 
 That ’ s clever ! Then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there ’ s no chance of two people buying the same gift . What things were in the notebook ? 
 So , what did you get them ? 
 What ’ s wrong with it ? 
 Household appliance don ’ t seem to last for a long time nowadays . 
 hey , Jimmy , you've been sitting in front of the TV all day . Anything interesting on TV ? 
 why don't you turn off the TV and get outside ? You need to get some fresh air . 
 Really ? What's the series about ? 
 it sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth . 
 really ? that's interesting ! 
 OK , I'll give it a go . 
 So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ? 
 Have you ever written up a business plan before ? 
 You couldn ’ t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc . 
 Wait , there ’ s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ’ ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea . 
 Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment ! 
 Are you a blogger ? 
 Oh , it seems that I'm the only one who never blogs . When did you get started ? 
 What do you usually write about ? 
 That's interesting . How often do you write a blog ? 
 Got it . Are you still updating your blog ? 
 Good for you . I know many people just leave their blogs alone after the first few months . 
 Not much . 
 That sounds good . 
 Candlelight in the Window 
 I'd rather not . I don't like horror movies . 
 No . I heard that's really boring . 
 Great idea ! 
 Hello , Candy . My name is Jim White . Nice to meet you . 
 I'm from New Orleans . What about you ? 
 Really ? This is a beautiful town . 
 OK . Can I have your phone number ? 
 I will . Bye . 
 Yes , the weather sure is nice today . 
 That sounds like a good idea.The sky is clear , the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot . 
 Hey , this spot in the shade looks really comfortable . 
 I don't think so . I say the weather report last night , and it said the weather should be fine all day . 
 I hear that you have been promoted . Congratulations on your promotion ! 
 When are you going ? 
 I need your help , Bob . 
 I'm really confused by these annoying abbreviations . 
 A / S / L , IGP , H & K , and ZZZ . What the hell do they mean ? 
 Interesting . Then what does H & K refer to ? The city of Hong Kong ? 
 Really ? What kind ? A girl left this word to me , and I thought she was in Hong Kong . 
 Hug and kiss ? ! How is it possible ? Oh , it's really bad to Miun - Verstand her meaning . 
 why are you in such a good mood today ? 
 I didn't know you were scared of heights ! Was it really bad ? 
 so what did you do about it yesterday ? 
 you're kidding me ! that sounds really scary ! 
 weren't you scared ? 
 so have you cured your fear of heights ? 
 I'm impressed . 
 well , sometimes I get scared when I'm in my apartment all by myself . 
 I always worry that the door is unlocked or that a window is open and that a stranger will come in and steal my things . 
 Look out ! 
 You must have rolled over something just now . 
 Mr . Green , I ’ d like to introduce you to Mr . Brown . 
 My pleasure , Mr . Green . I look forward to an excellent relationship with your company . 
 Okay , let ’ s make a toast . 
 Um ... Actually I am guessing you didn't get the MEMO . Your boss was selected to fill the vacancy in the CEO slot . He actually is the CEO now , or will be , as soon as the official press releases and hoopla is done with . 
 No kidding ! When the last CEO left , we were worried about the future of the company . 
 He is responsible to the board of directors for everything that happens in the company . He or she must give leadership to all company officers , as CEO is also responsible for providing the guidance of philosophy of the company , and acting as official representative , or face of the company . 
 Okay , can I ask you something direct ? 
 Fair enough . Give it to me straight . Did she bully you into this ? 
 I tell ya , when I got the invite , it really threw me for a loop . You've done a complete 180 . 
 I guess so . 
 Yes , I experienced one when I was in Tokyo once . The tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over . 
 I don't remember , but it wasn't very serious . Have you ever been in an earthquake ? 
 Where are you from ? 
 Did your house ever get damaged from the winds ? 
 Wow , that must have really been scary . 
 Have you ever experiences a flood ? 
 That sure didn't last long ! 
 What is a tornado warning ? 
 Really ? In New Berlin ? 
 I understand . They think a tornado might come . 
 And the second stage is called a tornado warning . 
 It's scary . 
 What do you mean a loud train ? 
 But if you hear them coming , isn't it already too late ? 
 Have you seen a lot of them ? 
 Did it hit their house ? 
 What were they doing when you called ? 
 That's terrible . Do many people die in tornadoes ? 
 Is this your brother-in-law ? 
 From his looks , I'd say he's a man of character . 
 What about you , Ernie ? How did you get into pop music ? 
 Yeah , if something is on the radio it must be really good . 
 Hello , Mary . Why are you standing here in the cold wind ? 
 Going for a walk in such a cold weather ? 
 I see . 
 How can I ? They're as alike as two peas in a pod . 
 You really have keen eyes . 
 What's the problem ? 
 Is there a problem ? 
 I apologize for their tardiness . 
 Again , I do apologize for the inconvenience . 
 Seeing as they were late , that won't be a problem . 
 I'm going to refund your money right now . 
 Hi Pete , how do you know my name ? 
 Oh Andrea , the Spanish girl ? 
 I met her last week at a party . Anyway , you must be from the United States ? 
 Oh , I am from London as well . 
 In Wimbledon - quite close to the tennis courts actually . Which is very nice because I love tennis . 
 That would be lovely . But now let's go and get a drink . 
 Do you really think so ? 
 Think , in some way it is an act of God , but in another way , it just is caused by us . 
 We didn't pay attention to the environment , cut down trees and polluted the air . 
 John got a heart attack last night . 
 Not so good , though his nephew took him to hospital in time . 
 Watch out ! You're too close to the fire place . 
 Really ? That's wonderful ! 
 Not at all . 
 You talked like the Terminator for two months ? Wow , I think you liked that movie even more than I liked ' Titanic . ' Why did you like ' Terminator ' so much ? 
 Isn't ' Terminator ' really violent ? I usually don't like gory movies because they gross me out . 
 Hmm ... I don't know . Even though it may not be gory , I think it would still totally freak me out . 
 Palmistry ? What is that ? 
 Oh , you mean palm reading 5 . I've seen that before , but I don't believe in it . 
 Really ? You've read books about it ? Ok , then . But only if you want to . 
 What else do you see ? Will I be successful ? Will I make a lot of money ? 
 What ? What is it ? What's the matter ? 
 Hey ! 
 How did you get wind of the rumor ? 
 Let ’ s stop gossiping and get back to work . 
 Thanks , Frank . I ’ d love to come . When is it ? 
 Sounds like fun . You can count me in ! Just give me directions to the restaurant . 
 Good morning , Pete . 
 Ah , this is my daughter's birthday present . Her birthday is next week . 
 That is not for a while . His birthday is only in August . 
 And when is your birthday ? 
 My birthday is in June , when we are always on holiday . So my family often forgets my birthday too . 
 And I must thank you again for your generous help . 
 I promise I will take the first chance to call on you . Please send your wife with my best regards . 
 Of course . You see , almost everyone has some kind of hobby 
 I like taking photos out of door . 
 Yes , I usually develop and print all my own photos . 
 Yes , simple as it is . t does work . 
 Yes , can I return this article , please ? 
 You see , I bought it for my husband , but he doesn't like it . 
 Last Saturday . 
 Yes , here you are . 
 hey , Lily , what are you doing ? 
 you mean the boy you met on MSN ? 
 you must be joking . You can't fall in love with someone you've never met ! 
 I think it's just a crush . You can't be serious . 
 did you tell him ? 
 you shouldn't take it too seriously . It might be a lie . 
 I think you should enlarge your circle of real life friends , and then the right person will come along . 
 great . My family came to visit me . 
 my immediate family is very large . It's my mother , my father , my two older brothers , my younger sister and me . 
 I thought you were the only child in the family . Didn't China practice the only-child policy in the early 1980s ? 
 interesting . What do you think about families with only one child ? 
 do you get along well with each other ? 
 you are very lucky to have such a nice family . 
 Is there a city where it's always warm ? 
 Are there any other cities where it's always hot ? 
 But why do so many people live there ? 
 Are there any cities where it rains a lot ? 
 Tell us about some cold cities . 
 Is it always cold in Chicago and Boston ? 
 Did you read this ? It says that the number one new years resolution make is to spend more time with friends and family . 
 Well , think about it . We are a society that is always on the go , not because we have to , but because we want to . 
 We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary . 
 What ’ s the point ? We always make a new year ’ s resolution and by February we will have forgotten about it . It ’ s pointless . 
 What about you ? Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in . 
 Yeah , yeah , whatever . 
 I ’ m not crazy about it at all . 
 I ’ m not interested in it . Are you keen on it ? 
 I hate it . 
 It ’ s the worst thing I ’ Ve ever tried . 
 You too . 
 I think you'd better apologize . 
 Maybe not , but I advice you to say it was your fault . 
 I am reading . 
 No , not yet . But I like to see what is available . 
 Of course , have a seat . 
 Yes , nice . But I prefer this wooden house with a garden fence and a sloping roof . 
 Well , you can't compare a small balcony to this large veranda . This is perfect for having a barbecue in summer . 
 Yes , next Saturday . I hope you can make it . 
 Sure . Have you checked the weather report ? 
 I'd like some toast and chicken wings . 
 Done . Oh , don't forget to take napkins , disposable plates , cups and picnic blanket . 
 Cool , we can take shuttlecock and badminton racket . 
 How ’ s your trip going ? 
 Isn ’ t London hot in the summer ? 
 I see . What about transport ? How does Shanghai compare to London ? 
 And what about the number of people on the streets ? 
 Mom , can you talk about the philosophy of life with me ? 
 Do you like the Harry potter books and movies ? 
 Why not ? They are very fun and exiting . 
 No , that ’ s not true . Many adults like the Harry potter books too . 
 Hi , Anna . I haven ’ t seen you for ages . Where have you been ? 
 No wonder I haven ’ t seen you recently . Where did you spend your holidays ? 
 You must have a wonderful time . 
 No , my wife doesn ’ t like traveling . We haven ’ t been traveling for more than ten years . The first time we traveled together was in 1978 when we just got married . We spent our honeymoon in the Alps . 
 Hey , the pool's open now ! 
 So it's time for the kids to get outdoors ... 
 Not this Taiwanese girl . We don't like to get suntans . 
 Donna , you really shocked everyone at the party last night ! 
 Yes ! We have all assumed that you were the quiet , shy type . 
 Where did you learn to sing like that ? 
 You ? Wow . And why don't you ever dress like that at work ? 
 Would you like to join the drama club ? 
 Why do you want to join it ? 
 Hey man ! How ’ s it hanging ? 
 Did you go to the roller rink on Saturday ? I heard it was far out , man ! 
 Right on , right on ! Well , Jim went to the rink with Sherry and he said it was dy-no-mite ! He was low on bread , but Sherry paid for everything . 
 Yeah man , I ’ m starving ! 
 I didn't want to go out last weekend , so I decided to stay at home and watch a movie . 
 I was very tired after working all week . Sometimes on the weekend I don't have enough energy to go out to a movie theater . 
 I downloaded it so that I didn't have to remember to return it . 
 You're too humble . 
 There ’ s some , but I don ’ t think it ’ s a big problem . A lot of it is petty crime , burglary and car theft . There ’ s very little major crime . 
 That happens in many places . In my city , there is a very good drug rehabilitation program . The police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes , but I don ’ t know if that ’ s the reason for our relatively low crime rate . 
 I think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . If most people have similar amounts of money , they will not think of stealing from others . 
 I really should be on my way . 
 No , thank you . I can ’ t . 
 Thank you very much . I had a really good time . 
 That would be great ! Actually , can I get your phone number , Ella ? That ’ s assuming you don ’ t mind if I call you sometime . 
 ok , got it . I ’ ll call you sometime next week . 
 It ’ s time to go and I hope we can get together again soon . 
 He said he will get married by the end of this month . 
 Who knows . After all , he is handsome and rich . 
 You can twist his arm in order to have a control of him . 
 I got a raise . 
 I would love to be famous and have thousands of adoring fans . 
 I love being photographed ! If I were famous , I ’ d do interviews for all the top magazines , like cosmo and elle . 
 no-one really believes gossip columnists . 
 I think you ’ re right about that . I ’ d need a good manager to be my spokesperson . I could do a lot of charity work , which would help a lot of people . 
 I love children , as you know , so probably a children ’ s charity . 
 Thanks , but actually I was hoping I could ask you to write my biography . 
 I ’ Ve cut it upland come to the conclusion that hi is actually sick of Jenny ’ s brother . But he likes Jenny . She is a big apple in his eye . 
 That ’ s why many people look up to him . 
 I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me . 
 I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done . 
 do you mind if I sit here ? 
 don't I know you ? 
 you're right ! How are you ? It's been a long time ! 
 I went straight to university afterwards . What about you ? 
 that sounds exciting . Where did you go ? 
 I went to a small school in Connecticut . It has a very good reputation for its languages department . 
 yes , I got a grant to study Chinese . 
 it is , but it's very rewarding . 
 I can , but not as well as I'd like to . I'll be studying Chinese until the day I die ! 
 Hi , Mary , I didn't see you at work this morning . Are you all right ? 
 Oh , I'm so sorry to hear that . Have you seen a doctor or taken any medicines ? 
 Are you feeling better ? 
 Do you need anything , grocery ? 
 Sure , I'll get it for you.Books or magazines ? 
 Sally , I ’ m tired of this Western food . I really miss my mother ’ s Sichuan cooking . 
 I have tried . But Americans like butter , bread , sugar , and cream too much . 
 It ’ s interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs , do not take naps during the day , and yet they can be so heavy . 
 I was thinking about applying for the new position . 
 It seems like a good idea but I am not really sure . 
 Well , it would give me a chance to grow , but I am wondering if I would like the job . 
 I am also thinking about the pay . 
 Yes , it might be worth it . I am not certain . 
 The murderer was sentenced to life imprisonment . 
 Yeah , because he just killed a man in cold blood . 
 David , what have you been up to lately ? 
 Really ? Where did you go ? 
 What cities did you go to ? 
 Did you go to Berlin ? 
 I think this summer is a good time to visit Berlin . It's a beautiful place and the people there are very nice . 
 I went there last year . If you want , I can give you some information I have about the city . 
 Look at this survey conducted by a website . A quarter of the employees will spend an average of 10 minutes everyday online doing personal things . Hi , Francis , what about you ? 
 Though our company doesn ’ t have a return policy , limiting the personal use of internet , I don ’ t think the boss will like us to do that . 
 But it is lucky for us . The company computers don ’ t have software keeping tracks of websites we visit . I have shopped too often online these days . 
 Have you started your report yet ? 
 It's easy . You only have to search the internet in order to get the information you're looking for . 
 The principal just announced that Dr . Smith is going to take over as dean of our department . 
 Why are you so calm ? Are you not surprised to hear this ? 
 Do you think he can do well ? 
 Where are you from , Laura ? 
 Oh , so you're from South America . 
 Oh , right . My geography isn't very good ! 
 Oh , How annoying ! 
 It ’ s infuriating . I have to be in Rome by five . 
 No , after you . Ladies first . 
 Hi , Tina , I've got good news . I have successfully passed the first two rounds of interview with ABC Company . They informed me to go to the final round next Monday . It looks very promising . 
 Thanks . Let's go for a celebration this evening . Are you free ? 
 No problem . See you ! 
 Are you going to leave school at the end of the term ? 
 What are you going to do ? 
 What does a clerk do ? 
 I want to be a vet . 
 A vet-a veterinary surgeon . 
 A vet's a man who takes care of sick animals . He's an animal doctor . 
 Hello Michael . 
 We're going to talk about Australia . Or your going to talk about Australia . So first of all how any people live in Australia ? 
 OK . What are the biggest cities ? 
 OK . Um , if you had to live in one place where would you live ? 
 Oh , nice . Actually , what is the capital city of Australia ? 
 Jim was late again . 
 Can you tell me what the date and time of our field trip is ? 
 Yes , I can write that on my calendar . 
 Yes , I understand . 
 No , I don't have a ride yet . 
 How much will the trip cost ? 
 I've just been a little depressed lately . 
 Nothing really . 
 You know , Mary , I feel we meet somewhere before . Where were you born ? 
 What was your childhood like ? 
 Where did you go to university ? 
 What is your current occupation ? 
 Hi Amy , you look very happy . 
 Wow . You must be very excited . 
 Shall we go to a restaurant to celebrate ? 
 Me too . I feel very thirsty as well . 
 I don't think the lecture is very interesting . 
 I feel he's like a talking machine . 
 Steven , I need badly your help . 
 My wife has found that I have an affair with my secretary , and now she is going to divorce me . 
 Yes , I know I'm wrong . But I swear that the affair lasts only for two months . And I still love my wife . I couldn't live without her . 
 Yes , I swear . 
 I know what love it . When I was young , I felt the same way . 
 You are , why not ask for a date ? 
 yes . It was so crowded . I'm worn-out . Let's find our seats . 
 let me see ... yes , one window seat and one aisle seat . 
 that's fine . I'd like to be on the aisle anyway . It's easier to get in and out . 
 I think the smaller carry-on bag can go in the overhead compartment , and the others can go under the seat . 
 don't forget to keep the seat belt on . 
 yes ! 
 oh , you have too wild of an imagination . 
 You mean you want to stay at home ? 
 I thought maybe you were interested in an outing . 
 Do you ? 
 Do you watch it or do you still play it ? 
 hi , my name's Abby . What's your name ? 
 I'm a freelance English teacher . How about you ? 
 what kind of job are you looking for ? 
 have you ever thought about becoming a freelance IT consultant ? 
 not if you are good at net-working . Do you like to meet new people ? 
 do you have experience in the IT field ? 
 do you speak Spanish ? 
 that's OK . Have you sent your CV out to anyone yet ? 
 did you write a clear objective in your resume ? 
 I think you need to update your CV . Bring it over to my office tomorrow and I'll help you with it . 
 Who's that over here ? 
 What do you think of the teacher ? 
 What does she teach ? 
 Is she your teacher ? 
 Can she speak Chinese to her students ? 
 It's a good thing you can speak English ! 
 They're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 . 
 No way , if it still has 21 . 
 Yes . And you're Paul , right ? Paul Hill ? 
 I'm fine . After ten years , you still look great ! 
 Not bad . Let's find a table and sit down . We have a lot to talk about . 
 Marquet , do you think I should enroll in the science course ? 
 Right , I figure since you are doing premedical , you know about the very courses . 
 Yes , I really weak in maps , I did poorly in high school . 
 Do you like traveling ? 
 Where did you visit ? 
 How did you like it ? 
 Where did you go there . 
 And do you have friend there ? 
 You must enjoy yourself . 
 Hello , Chandler ! How are you ? 
 Just so so . I am too tired . My company has been holding too many training sessions lately . 
 Good ? ! For them but not to me . 
 We have to participate in training after a busy day and during the weekend . You know , after work all you want to do is throw yourself onto your bed . And during the Weekend , you just want to stay at home and enjoy a family dinner . 
 Yes , I agree with you on the point but couldn't the training be held during the working day instead of weekend ? 
 The company is selecting three employees to attend the marketing seminar next month . Did you put your name in for it ? 
 It's not just about the things that you learn , you know ... seminars are a really great opportunity to mingle and network with professionals in our industry from all over the nation . You can learn a few things , but more importantly , you rub shoulders with the business leaders and make contacts that could lead to potential sales or partnerships in the future . The social mixers are always more important than the seminars anyway . 
 Well , what if I told you the seminar is going to be held in Hawaii ? Does that perk your interest ? 
 I think I'll write a book . 
 All of the time tested healthy habits from around the world . 
 The interesting thing is to see what really works and what's just hype . 
 That's right . I think we all have much we can learn from each other . 
 I heard that you went to the concert the day before ? How did you like it ? 
 Who was the conductor ? 
 Oh , I learned that he is also a legendary violinist . 
 Obviously you did enjoy the concert . 
 Hi , Daniel , how are you holding up ? I am greatly sorry for your loss . 
 How ’ s that going ? 
 Have you bought a burial plot and a casket ? 
 I see , that sounds like something she would have really liked . I am sure the memorial service will be tasteful . You are doing a great job . 
 Hey , guys ! 
 How's business ? 
 Wow ! I'm impressed ! 
 I quit my job as a food critic . 
 You can't beat me at tennis . 
 Song , I hate to say goodbye , but I have to . 
 Let's keep in touch . 
 Shakespeare was born in 1867 . 
 Are you sure ? Can you make it more exact ? 
 How is he ? 
 Did he see the doctor ? 
 Why ? 
 When will our party be held ? 
 Have you sent out invitations by our party ? 
 When ? 
 Could Dr.Cole like to attend the party ? 
 That's fine . 
 The Ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half . 
 It doesn't seem to be so easy . 
 I want to buy a new camcorder for my trip this summer . 
 not really . I thought I'd just have a look today . 
 sure . I'd like to see the smallest camcorder that you have first . 
 it's very light . That would be good . How is the battery life ? 
 can you also take still photos with this ? 
 how about night vision ? Can you use it in the dark ? 
 that's not bad at all . How's the microphone ? Does it pick up much sound ? 
 how does that compare with other models ? 
 I guess you can't have everything , can you ? 
 You could have tried to explain to him about the new programmers . 
 You might be right . He does think pretty highly of himself . 
 I heard . But did you have to tear out his nose ring ? 
 It ’ s getting worse . Now he ’ s eating me out of house and home . I ’ Ve tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out the other . He makes himself at home , which is fine . But what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and I had company over ! That was the last straw . 
 You ’ re right . Everything is probably going to come to a head tonight . I ’ ll keep you informed . 
 I'd love to . 
 Any day except Tuesday . 
 Yes , Thursday would be fine . What time shall I come ? 
 Yes , of course . Thank you very much . 
 Bob , I'm really upset with you . 
 You forgot it last year as well . 
 Belinda , I ’ m going to a party tonight . What shall I wear ? 
 I guess it ’ s formal . 
 That ’ s right . 
 You are smart . 
 You are right . What kind of shoes should I wear ? 
 Good idea . Oh , by the way , would you please pick me up after the party , honey ? 
 OK . 
 He used to be a policeman . 
 Yeah . He's a private eye now . 
 I don ' t think that ' s a good idea . I am just not good with approaching someone and starting up a conversation . 
 Pick-up lines don ' t work ! 
 What ? Come on ! That ’ s just lame ! No girl would fall for that ! 
 That ' s a good one ! I think that ' s pretty funny . 
 Ok , how does this sound , “ I was so enchanted by your beauty that I ran into that wall over there . So I am going to need your name and number for insurance purposes . ” 
 At their last meeting , the stockholders voted unanimously to block the merger of our company with Blycore . All the executive committee was in favor of the merger ... I don't understand how the stockholders could have so much power to throw a wrench in the plans ... 
 Is it really that simple ? It doesn't seem very efficient to run things that way ... 
 I guess I'd buy that ... 
 No , I didn't . And you ? Was it good ? 
 How much was the ticket ? 
 Great ! I landed on Classic Movies . 
 I love them , especially the all-time greats like Gone With the Wind . 
 Sometimes I think Oscars are only awarded to movies that make a lot of money . 
 Well , Brad from school asked me out just today . 
 But I don't know what to do . 
 My mom says no boyfriend until I'm in college . 
 Actually , that's what a lot of parents in Taiwan say to their kids . 
 Yeah ? You finally decided to wipe the slate clean ? 
 So what are you going to do ? Take up an art class or something ? 
 I ’ m with you on that one . Anything else you ’ re planning on doing ? 
 It ’ s about time ! 
 I should finish it as soon as possible . 
 Why can I learn it ? 
 I feel I really stupid . 
 Wow , what a great burd ! 
 She's a real turn-on , alright ? 
 Yeah , I noticed . She must be really loaded . 
 Lucky her . Anyway , I think that is just as beautiful . 
 Well , that's my opinion . 
 Oh , there is no comparison . Now we are talking but ugly . 
 Do you like swimming ? 
 Me too . Swimming is a very good exercise for health . It combines water , bath , sunbath , and air bath together . It promotes the growth and haleness of muscles , bone , viscera and nerve systems . 
 Have you ever swum in a river or a lake ? 
 You should have seen the T . V . show that was on last night , the topic it covered was really interesting , animal rights . 
 Yes , but we can ’ t deny that animals are vulnerable , defenseless , and are completely at the mercy of human beings . 
 You can ’ t compare apples and oranges . I believe that both topics are important and that we can ’ t ignore them , the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance . I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching . 
 At least you ’ re doing your part . My contribution is to have a pet in the house that I treat like a member of the family . 
 So it looks like we start selling in the U . S . next year . 
 He's still not sure whether he wants to put me in charge , or whether he wants to hire an American.But even if he hires an American , I'll probably be transferred to our American office . 
 We aren't sure yet . Maybe L . A . I think L . A . would be the best idea . 
 Yes , the recent agreements between the two governments have changed everything.Now we have the right to sell in America at a much lower tariff.It ' s going to be good . We can compete more directly with them . 
 Our computers have a high level of quality now.We can demonstrate it . And our prices will be good.So I think it will really be worthwhile . 
 Well , you know I studied marketing in America.So maybe the thought of going back there to promote our brand is kind of exciting to me . I'd love to be part of the team . 
 Yes , I do . I think we can compete . I think we can make a name for ourselves.It will be hard at first . But if we develop a good advertising campaign , I think we can break into the market . 
 It takes some time.Because even if the quality is high , people won't accept a high tech product unless they recognize the name.Name recognition is crucial . 
 That's very nice of you to say.But if we set up an office there in the States , maybe you could try to become part of it . 
 How are the children doing at sport ? 
 He ’ s not very good at the long jump though , is he ? 
 Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ? 
 How are they at swimming ? 
 Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters . 
 I think that these kinds haven ’ t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher . 
 How many people are there in your family ? 
 That is a big family . How old is your sister ? 
 What about your brother ? 
 Do you miss your family ? 
 Do you often go home ? 
 How often do you write to them ? 
 Wow , American football is more exciting than I thought . 
 Oh , right . So , I can ’ t quite follow what ’ s going on ... who ’ s winning ? 
 Wow ! What a hit ! 
 Is he ok ? 
 I guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team . 
 Yeah . 
 What happened ? Why did everyone get so quiet ? 
 Who stands out in your mind as a man or woman of sound character ? 
 He's the US president , who walked five miles just to give a lady her change , isn't he ? 
 That's right . He ran for office quite a few times before he was finally elected . 
 He had great vision , didn't he ? 
 What ’ s your working day like ? 
 Do you get paid onetime ? 
 Do you have any breaks ? 
 My boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . I suppose your job involves a lot paperwork , doesn ’ t it ? 
 Yes , I do . I don ’ t like it very much . 
 Freeze ! 
 You know that ? Dan got a divorce . 
 Yeah . But his relation with Sallycome to a sticky end and was found by his wife . 
 Hello , is Jack there ? 
 Jack ! It ’ s Rose here . 
 Fine , thanks . I ’ m having several friends over for dinner this Saturday . And I was wondering if you have the time to join us . 
 Is six o ’ clock okay ? 
 Fine with me . I just want to get this over with . It ’ s important we make a clean break . I should have signed a pre-nup . 
 Nothing ! Anyway , you ’ re right , there ’ s no reason this has to be nasty . My lawyer tells me you ’ Ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property , as well as the custody agreement-I keep the cat and you get the dog . So that ’ s done ... finally . 
 Fine , but I ’ m keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me . 
 He ’ s my grandfather , and he never really liked you anyway ! 
 How typical , when are you ever going to use a silver tea set ? Fine ! I don ’ t want to drag this out any longer than necessary . What ’ s next ? What about these old photographs ? 
 Our trip to Italy ! I remember that day . We were going to visit the Trev fountain , and we got caught in the rain ... 
 Oh , we really did have fun back then , didn ’ t we ? 
 Oh Jeff ! I love you too ! I ’ m so glad we didn ’ t have to decide who keeps the motorcycle . 
 What's the time now ? 
 You've simply forgotten to wind it up , have you ? When do you usually wind it up ? 
 You got up so late today . You have , I think . Turn on the TV and set your watch by it . 
 All right . It's just four o'clock . 
 You are welcome . 
 Yes , Sally . I want to do some sit-ups and perhaps get in a game of singsong . 
 I'd love it.Working out is more fun with a friend . 
 Good.If you happen to see Jim and Bob on the way see if they would like a game of singsong . 
 That of the old man . 
 Some of the scenes moved me into tears . 
 Okay . But what is a tailgate party ? 
 How fun ! Can I bring something ? 
 I make a mean potato salad ! 
 Then I'll see you in the parking lot at five ! Thank you ! 
 I need to get a passport . 
 When will I be able to do that ? 
 That ’ s fine . 
 Then what do I do ? 
 How long will it take for my passport to be ready ? 
 That ’ s perfect . 
 Are you nuts ? What would my friends think if they see me in a hired car ? 
 Oh this is hard ! Well , I ’ ll see what I can do . 
 You do ? OK , fine with me . 
 But I also want ya to do me a favor . 
 You gotta have some better deodorant . 
 I really hate to say this , but don't go away mad , just go away . 
 Then , why didn't you try to prevent it in the beginning ? 
 I don't want to argue anymore . Please get out of my life ! 
 No way ! Please don't follow me around . 
 Yes , I do . Leave me alone ! 
 Yes , it is.It ' s wonderful after the downpour . 
 I hope it stays nice like this for a long period of time . 
 You're right.We don't know what is going to be like tomorrow . 
 The weatherman predicts a fine day today . 
 When can we expect you and your daughter for dinner ? Next Saturday ? 
 How about Sunday then ? 
 Does 6 thirty suit you ? 
 Thanks , goodbye . 
 Isn ’ t that Michael Johnson ? I think he set a world record in this race . 
 Are you sure ? What about Carl Lewis ? He won four golds , didn ’ t he ? 
 I like the way Carl runs . He looks more graceful . 
 Saturday ? Oh , I have a previous engagement . 
 I've already got plans , too . 
 How about Friday ? Only in that day can I arrange it . 
 That's settled then . I'll contact you later . 
 Em , it's delicious ! 
 You're lucky . 
 What ? 
 That sounds like fun . 
 No , and I have no way of getting ahold of him ! There's no phone where he's at ! 
 My older sister Judy will be here soon to help . She already has a boy and a girl of her own ... 
 B , what's in your hand ? 
 Why do you read them ? 
 I got your meaning . Reading is your own solution to solve pressure from busy tasks . 
 I often go to the bar near our dorm when I am overtired . I am crazy for drinking wines with special taste . 
 Shall we have a drink someday ? 
 What a lovely day , isn't it ? 
 I hope it stays like this . 
 Is the weather usually like this here ? 
 What's the weather like in winter ? 
 I wonder what it ’ s going to be like tomorrow . 
 Neither too cold , nor too hot . 
 Yes , especially in spring . 
 Once , when I was a child . 
 Now and then . 
 Are you travelling in America ? 
 What do you do ? 
 I know all the tricks of the trade . It is quite tiring and difficult to be promoted . 
 I am a reporter at a TV station . 
 Yes , I have good working conditions and I would require a salary at least 15 , 000 $ a year . 
 I report the social news which means I always interview the citizens of various professions and trades . 
 Sometimes . News happened out of expectation . Sometimes I have to get up in the early morning while I can't sleep for editing and interviewing . 
 That's right . I am still wet behind the ears . 
 I'm glad you like it.The bell is on the bedside.Just ring if you want anything.The room attendant speaks a little English.So I don't think you'll have any trouble . 
 I think so.Here it is.It ' s by the basin . 
 Yes , it is . 
 You're my hero . 
 That's brilliant ! We can name the grades of motor oil by where they come from . 
 I think the Saudi Arabian will hit the spot today . 
 A match made in heaven . 
 It ’ s quite an interesting place to live . The best thing to do in my city is go shopping . There are several indoor and outdoor markets , department stores and shopping malls . 
 Not really . Cars are not permitted in several parts of city centre , especially in the main shopping areas . The public transport system is pretty good . 
 There are restaurants with food from all over the world . We have a small china-town near the city centre . There are many Indian , thai , and Italian restaurants all over the city centre . There are many s 
 There are several good clubs near the city centre . Many people in my city prefer something more cultural , so we several theatres and venues for classical music concerts and operas . 
 It is . I hope you ’ ll have time to come for a visit soon . You really should come during the summer , when the weather is better and there ’ s more happening outdoors . 
 I had a drop too much last night . I attended a banquet given by a Chinese colleague of mine . And it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a Chinese table . 
 I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me . But if I keep gulping down one cup after another , I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick . 
 a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood . 
 I got you . Next time . I'll preface a toast with a statement like ' I can't drink any more ' and then drink anyway . 
 We planned our wedding for next May . 
 Yeah , I did . But my fiancee has an important project . 
 Julie ’ s friend , Mary . And John will be the best man . 
 Good afternoon , Mrs . Brown . I've come to see Mr . Brown . 
 Is he in ? 
 Oh ! I just drop in on him for a chat . 
 No , thank you . Please tell him to phone me when he comes back . 
 Who wrote it ? 
 Who're the producer , the director , the stars , heroine and the hero ? 
 Going to the gym tonight , Mary ? 
 That sounds like fun . Would you mind some company ? 
 I'll get my things and meet you there . 
 You didn't show up to my performance last night ! Some kind of friend you are ! 
 Sure . You look like you're all black and blue . 
 You're serious ? 
 I guess I misjudged you . I hope you can forgive me . 
 The whether in Beijing is just beautiful . 
 Yes . I can see . The summer heat is over . And the winter cold is still far away . 
 Autumn is also very nice In Washington . 
 No . it isn ’ t . But sometimes it slows a lot in winter . 
 Oh . Yes . Sometimes it rains very heavily 
 There ’ s a lot of rain in summer . But it seldom rains in autumn 
 That ’ s true . many people from the south don ’ t like the whether here . 
 No . I ’ m from the north . I was born in Beijing actually . 
 Tom set the whole country by the ears with his discovery . 
 He was very clever when he was a boy . 
 What's her figure ? 
 What's the color of her eyes ? 
 how old is she ? 
 Nice day , isn't it ? 
 Good idea ! 
 I've never seen anything like it . 
 I'm fine . How about yourself ? 
 No problem . So how have you been ? 
 I've been good . I'm in school right now . 
 I go to PCC . 
 It's okay . It's a really big campus . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Oh , what does he look like ? Is he tall ? 
 I can tell it from your build . 
 Yeah . I get sick of her . She always bends my ear about what she thinks . 
 But I don ’ t like anyone who would drive me crazy by telling me what to do . 
 I have lots of friends . 
 I don't know , maybe one hundred . 
 Of course . I have lots of best friends . 
 I think about twenty-five . 
 I feel sorry for you . 
 You must be lonely . I will share my friends with you . 
 I have talked a lot about your restaurant business and your friends with my friends . One of my friends seems to be on good terms with Sue . 
 She is indeed well . But she would not give anyone a tumble , you bet . 
 I'm not . 
 I trust you . 
 I'm fling , Jack . ( singing ) Come , Josephine , in my flying machine . Up she goes , and up she goes ... 
 My condolences . 
 Yeah , the government really takes a bit , doesn't it ? 
 Yeah , I don't mind it either . We ’ ll both end up rich slobs and not need it , but what if we do , you know ? 
 Yeah , my grandmother gets by on social security and the money my grandfather invested when he was alive . 
 Really ? No , they couldn't . None of them would have jobs if they did . 
 Oh , hey ... 
 Actually , my office is right around the corner . 
 Yeah , yeah , it was really interesting . You know , I'm in a bit of a hurry , but here ’ s my card . We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion . 
 You know what , this is really embarrassing , but your name has just slipped my mind . Can you remind me ? 
 Can I borrow one of your pens , Amy ? 
 Hey , Sandy , what's new ? Interested in a movie tonight ? 
 Soup kitchen ? Is that a new restaurant or something ? 
 How did you get involved in something like that ? 
 So what do you do there ? 
 Yeah , it sounds easy . How long does it take ? 
 I don't know . I mean , I like helping the community and all that , but I don't know if I have the time ... 
 Wang , I'd like you to meet my friend . Dou , this is Wang . 
 Pleased meet you , too , Mr . Dou . 
 And we got a 50 thousand dollar ticket for construction workers peeing off the roof . 
 See , I just told you he hit a deer . Man , I knew you weren ’ t listening to me . 
 Nothing ? 
 You and Patricia got engaged , didn ’ t you ? You can tell me . 
 Come on . 
 What ? I thought you liked Patricia . 
 Promise ? 
 Yes , I have a very special one . I will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . A friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer keepers . I was very interested . So I asked him to get me the application form . Lucky , my application was approved by the manager very soon . 
 I will help to prepare food , feed animals and clean up . I ’ m very excited about it now . 
 Ok , I will bring you photos as many as possible . 
 Uh , just for fun . Happy Easter , Mom . We got you these Easter lilies . 
 Of course I'm pale . It's just now the beginning of spring . I don't have my summer tan yet . 
 I'm fine , Mom . Remember Holly ? This is her roommate , Yi-jun .. 
 Yes . I ’ Ve finished making the birthday cake and I ’ Ve put all the things on the table . Did you find the party hats ? 
 Thanks . Do you think we have enough for the kids to eat and drink ? 
 That birthday cake looks wonderful , but you haven ’ t put any candles on it yet . 
 I ’ Ve brought a tape with lots of children ’ s songs on it . 
 Are you doing anything tonight ? 
 Do you like western music ? 
 There ’ s a concert tonight . Would you like to go and listen to it ? 
 Mum , can I finish my homework later ? 
 But I want to watch TV now . 
 Please . 
 Not even for an hour ? 
 Table-tennis is our national game . 
 I can't , either . I like watching . 
 Is she really ? I can ’ t believe it ! 
 Good gracious . That ’ s incredible ! 
 You ’ re kidding . 
 Really ? I ’ m surprised . 
 Me too . 
 Of course , but I'll have to go now . 
 I'd like reading books best . 
 Literature and economy . 
 That's OK . 
 I like to play golf , play badminton or crack jokes . 
 That's a bad habit . 
 Yes , he is running for class president . 
 Take my word for it . 
 What kind of food will they be serving ? 
 It sounds like this is going to be authentic Mexican food . 
 Do you know the day they plan to open ? 
 Maybe we can make reservations ahead of time ? 
 That would be great . I am really in the mood for a spicy hotpot . Any special reason for the invitation ? 
 It was my pleasure . How about this evening ? I feel very hungry now . 
 Ok with me . You are the boss . I will meet you downstairs after work . 
 No , I don ’ t want to eat anything . 
 I ’ m down in spirits . 
 My manager jumped on me for my mistake today . 
 I think I'm too clumsy . I can do nothing well . 
 But I doubt myself . 
 I'm afraid I can't go to the pictures with you tomorrow . 
 Not really . I'm expected to attend a meeting . 
 Mum , I have something for you today . 
 Don't you remember ? Today is March 8th . It's Women's Day . 
 Now , close your eyes . ( Mum closes her eyes and Steven puts the present in her hand . ) 
 Happy Women's Day . I love you forever , Mum . 
 He's very strict with us . 
 Indeed.He ' s strict with himself , too.We can see every lecture of his is well-prepared . 
 How is everything going on ? 
 You look prettier than before . 
 You must be annoyed about your boyfriend ’ s leaving you , huh ? 
 It ’ s a sad thing . I ’ m ever so sorry ... 
 Hello , Rebecca , fancy meeting you here ! 
 How have you been ? 
 Pretty good . What brings you here ? 
 What courses are you going to take next year ? 
 Why are you going to take english with chemistry and physics ? 
 Of course it depends on what you are going to do when you leave college . Have you beside what you are going to do when you graduated ? 
 Hi , chary , are you busy this evening ? 
 what are you doing ? 
 how old is he today ? 
 well , wish him a happy birthday for me . 
 I was just thinking of going to a movie tonight . 
 sorry , I've got people coming over tomorrow night . 
 sounds that way . Maybe some other time then ? 
 yeah , me , too . It's about time I made a move . 
 likewise . See you later . 
 Good afternoon ! 
 Fine , thanks . I am Wang Lin . 
 Is this your first time in Beijing ? 
 Here is my phone number . If you need anyone to show you around , call me . 
 Hey Michelle , jump in quick . It's pouring out there ! 
 Yes , he told me . We need to pick him up at his hotel and then go to the conference . 
 Ah thank you ! I'm very excited . We were going to get married next year , but then we decided to get married on holiday instead . It was wonderful . 
 I know what you mean . I think Shanghai is getting more and more expensive , don't you ? 
 Definitely . Oh , there's Mr . Campbell . Driver , can you stop here please ? 
 Nope ! It's the latest generation of PAD ! You won't believe what it can do . 
 It has a built-in camera unit that takes digital color stills . It also plays MP3 files , which I can save on media cards and then transfer to the hard drive of my computer . 
 This one comes with its own folding keyboard . It has a pre-installed handwriting recognition program . I can use the stylus to write on the screen . 
 Just plug in a peripheral CD or floppy drive and you're ready to go ! 
 Oh , nothing . 
 ( Laugh ) All right . You caught me in the act . I finally worked up the nerve to ask Diana out . I was just writing a note to put on her desk . 
 I admit it . I'm a wuss . I just can't do it in person . 
 That's different . When I'm working , I'm in a different frame of mind . But , when I even think about asking her out , I get tongue-tied . At least in a note , I can get the words out without turning beet red . 
 Well , for one thing , she's gorgeous . She's so upbeat and sweet . Who doesn't like her ? Oh , I don't know . All I do know is that I think we have great chemistry together . But , what if I'm wrong . Maybe she's just been nice to me out of courtesy and doesn't think of me that way . Oh ... forget it . This was a bad idea . 
 What note ? 
 You're kidding ! I can't believe you've been standing this entire time and didn't say anything . 
 Yeah , I want the note . 
 Thanks . I plan on it . 
 He never came . 
 I wouldn ’ t exactly characterize it in that way . I think something happened . Something terrible and unexpected that made it impossible for him to ... what if he showed up , took one look at me and left ? 
 Maybe , there was a subway accident . 
 A train got trapped underground with him inside . 
 And you know , how those express trains create suction . 
 It's OK . It seems we have a lot in common . 
 He is tall and slim , fair-haired . 
 He is a nice guy and very considerate . I am impressed with how smart he is and he has a great sense of humor . 
 He didn't say , but he said he would call me . 
 Oh , David . Stop it ! I am a bit nervous ! What should I do if he doesn't call me ? 
 Thank you , David . You're always so encouraging . 
 I feel terrible , but I've just broken your ashtray . 
 I don't know what to say . I'd like to replace it . 
 I'm so angry at Bob for buying a new bike . 
 The hotel is full tonight . we will need to find a new place to stay . 
 Do you know much about computers ? 
 I've just been reading an article about them.they ' ll be used for all sorts of things now . 
 Yes , but they are used for other things , too.Do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to Paris . 
 The man asked where we want to go , then he type out the information on the form and waited for a reply . A few moment later , he gave us two tickets . 
 That's right . 
 Thank you ! 
 Yeah . I'm lucky to be his wife . 
 So he will make a perfect husband . Make sure you will be here next Monday . 
 Many happy returns of the day , darling ? 
 And here is your birthday present . 
 Do you like it ? 
 I didn't expect to see you at this hour . You must have goofed off again . 
 You'll be sorry if the boss finds it out . He may probably give you the bag . 
 Hi Jane , you look great . 
 Yes , I took off 4 kilos . I am glad you notice it . 
 No no , I just changed my eating habits . I eat a balance meal . and I eat less than before . 
 On balance , dress designing appeals to me most . 
 Say , how would you like to be a dress designer ? 
 Hi , Sue . What's up ? 
 Ok , I guess . My boss has been on my back recently . 
 You know , just giving me lots to do . I'm really busy right now . 
 Oh , lots of things . Mostly training new people . 
 What happened ? 
 What ? Why ? Can ’ t you renew it ? 
 Well , I can help you pack . We should start looking for a new place for you ASAP . 
 Well , let me know if there ’ s anything I can do to help out . 
 Hehe .. sure 
 I think housing is a big problem . There are thousands of homeless people on the streets . 
 I have a good idea to solve it . The government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes . 
 I think the government can afford it . Besides , there are many advantages . Homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . They would learn some useful skill for finding jobs in the construction industry or home improvement . 
 If we are to invest more money to education , we will need to raise taxes . That wouldn ’ t be popular with voters . 
 The government should show that it is using money efficiently . Sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project . 
 The sun is shining . 
 That's the sign of wind . 
 Hello , Joanna . You are looking very charming in the new dress . 
 Yes , it suits you very well . It certainly is unique . I don ’ t think I ’ Ve seen anything like it before . 
 And the necklace , it matches your dress marvelously . 
 Thank you for saying so . 
 It was fantastic , but I'm glad to be back ! Being a tourist is really tiring ! 
 Because it's off-season , we got a really good package deal to Paris , so we went there . 
 That was the first thing we did . I have a few pictures . Do you want to see them ? 
 Oh , that's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city . 
 No , by that time , I was sick of sightseeing . I had had enough of art galleries , cathedrals , fountains , statues , and palaces ! 
 We spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . We had a few coffees , watched a movie , and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel . 
 Of course ! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery ! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though . 
 Your ring is very beautiful . 
 Oh , it is precious . 
 Our major is from a bigger city . 
 He brings with him some talented people from his former city . 
 Hey , where's Cindy ? 
 You're Mary , right ? 
 Cindy told me about you in our gym class . 
 My house is next door to yours . 
 Just call me Alex . Alex and Alexander are the same thing . 
 The Ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half . 
 It doesn't seem to be so easy . 
 Yes . It is also called Dragon Boat Festival . 
 We celebrate it to commemorate a great patriotic poet of China — Qu Yuan . 
 We'll have rice dumplings . What's more , there are also dragon boat matches in some places of southern China . 
 Hey , there's Leo . I wonder why he's walking arm in arm with that young woman . 
 You're pulling my leg ! She must be thirty years younger than Leo . Talk about robbing the cradle ! 
 It must have been love at first sight because I know he didn't have a girlfriend last week . 
 How many credits are you taking this semester ? 
 What's the matter , are the classes you want full ? 
 If you were to take on a double major , what would be your first choice ? 
 Have you even thought that far ahead ? I mean what country would you like to do business with ? 
 What part did you get in the play this time ? 
 I wish I had a character part . Those are my favorite . 
 I know , but I've done that so Ay times . It's getting old . The leading guy is always the same macho A . 
 Next time . You are going to love your part . I've seen the script . 
 Are you free on Friday evening because we were wondering if you would like to come round for dinner ? 
 That ’ s a pity ! Then when would it be a good time for you ? 
 Okay , that ’ s fine . 
 I like spring best . It is neither too cold nor too hot . Freezing days make me lazy and stuffy days make me lazier . How about you ? 
 How do you get through the stuffy daytime ? 
 Great party , isn't it ? 
 This is my first , I only met jane last week . she and I teach at the same school . 
 Yeah , history , what about you ? 
 Salesman ? 
 Oh , I see , by the way , my name's Mary . 
 Remember that old man who used to beg for money on the street across from our house ? 
 He got a job and now he owns a small grocery in town . 
 Sorry . I've got to run . 
 Hello , this is the International Student Office . My name is Leah . How may I help you ? 
 Ok . Can I ask who is calling , please ? 
 And what is your call regarding ? 
 Ok , I'll try and put you through . Please hold . 
 ... Sorry , her line is busy at the moment . Can I take a message ? 
 Ok . What's your number ? 
 Let me repeat that back to you . That's zero , double seven , eight , seven , three , six , seven , double six , double eight . 
 I got it . When should I have her call you back ? 
 Ok , Nathaniel . I'll have Ms . Collins call you back sometime tonight before 6 pm . 
 Bye ! 
 Dan , Dan , dude . You have to come over to my house right now ! 
 Just get over here ! 
 So , since when is your house a bank ? 
 I mean , what ’ s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows . 
 What ’ s the matter with you ? Why are you acting all paranoid ? 
 OK , well , what did you want to see me about ? 
 You didn't ring me last night.You said you would . 
 That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch . 
 And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ? 
 Hey ! What's up ? 
 Yeah , I've been out of town . 
 Great ! Work is really busy now , but it's fun . 
 That's a good idea . I haven't been in a while and I need to get a new backpack . The old one is hanging on by a thread ! 
 Reciting texts really bores me to death . 
 Yes , the teacher says recitation is real good . 
 Yes ? 
 Sure he is . Winter swimming does good to health , I hear . 
 It doesn't matter to me . 
 Either way . I don't care . 
 I couldn't careless . 
 Whatever you say . 
 I don't mind if you want to . 
 No , it is the original one . 
 I have changed a case for it . 
 Of course . That's why I bought this type . I can change its case frequently , so it is novel to use it . 
 There are two more , one is orange and the other is pink . I have bought them all . 
 Would you mind going to dinner with me tonight ? 
 OK . 
 Why ? 
 I see . 
 It's very cold tonight ! 
 0h , that would be nice of you . 
 Yes , please do that . 
 Absolutely ! Everything that ’ s thrilling turns me on . 
 What is it ? 
 I do not like the play with complicated plot . What's on today ? 
 I know that . I have seen the film as the same title . Andrews gives a performance to be remembered for a lifetime from Maria to a cheerful governess . 
 Of course , it is a nice song that can make audience calm and pleasant . 
 I hope the opera will be more stupendous than the movie . Have you bought the tickets ? 
 Let's go . We'd better buy the tickets earlier and have dinner in restaurant . 
 Sorry , I can ’ t . 
 I ’ d like to . But I ’ m afraid I can ’ t . 
 That ’ s sounds great . 
 No . I ’ d better not . 
 Because I don ’ t think my husband would like it . Thank you for inviting me anyway . 
 I'm not surprised . 
 My brother in-law just dropped in from the states . 
 I decided to put him up while he's here , big mistake ! 
 He's lazy . I tried being a good host , but if you give him an inch , he'll take a mile . 
 You can say that again . 
 Two weeks . If he thinks I'll put up with his attitude that long he's got another thing coming . 
 Hi , Mrs . Henderson . 
 Of course I have plenty of time . What's new ? 
 No . The Hills ? Who filed for divorce first ? 
 Oh , maybe not . It's just your guess . Do not give currency to idle gossip . 
 What's up , buddy ? You look so upset . 
 I'm sorry to hear that . What's your conflict ? 
 Did you think about talking to her again ? Maybe she is waiting for your call . 
 Come on , guy . Maybe she isn't your right person . 
 Thank you for saying that . It's a present from my girlfriend . 
 Mr . : There are two things that you'll need to know . 
 Mr . : The school has three lunch periods , and the kids are divided into three groups to go to lunch . 
 Mr . : Furthermore , when you are dismissed in the afternoon , you will be divided into two waves . 
 Mr . : The school parking lot is not big enough for all the school buses to come in at one time . So only half the buses come in first to pick up the first wave's students . 
 Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! 
 It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! 
 There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . 
 So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . 
 Yes . 
 I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . 
 Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . 
 He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . 
 C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . 
 You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? 
 You're supposed to stand here quietly until the flag - raising ceremony is over . 
 When everything is over . 
 Not yet . You should stand still for another few minutes . Late-comers must be recorded . 
 Are you looking forward to seeing that big concert next week ? 
 Hey Joanne . What are you up to ? 
 I'm so bored . I don't know what I'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning . 
 I don't think we are boring . It's just that we don't have any hobbies . 
 That all depends on what you like to do . For example , I like to doodle on the notepad , so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings . 
 Yeah . That can be a good hobby . 
 That's a great idea . I'm going to do the same . 
 Yes , but it was many years ago . 
 I was a naughty boy and I played hooky . So the school gave me a punishment to clear the classroom for a week . 
 It's cool . 
 Would you ? I wouldn't . 
 Oh , I don't know . I'd buy a big house with a garden for my wife and kids , I suppose . But it's difficult to imagine having a lot of money . 
 Wouldn't you ? What would you do with all that spare time ? 
 What would you do after that ? 
 It doesn't sound very exciting . 
 I'd be happy if I got a rise . 
 Well , I'm not likely to get a rise and you haven't the money for a mink coat , so let's come down to earth and have another drink . 
 I'll have a pint of the best . 
 All right . Make it a double , will you ? 
 so do i . I don ’ t like cats . 
 I can ’ t bear being near cats . They don ’ t seem to like me either . 
 I ’ m fond of snakes . I think they ’ re great . I agree with you about spiders though . I think spiders are horrible . I think it ’ s because they have so many legs . 
 I agree . I ’ m carry about mice . I think they ’ re so cute ! 
 I hear your sister has had an accident , is it true ? 
 That's a crying shame . It really is ! 
 Good evening , I'm so happy you could come . 
 What would you like to drink ? 
 My son is alway complaining that I dump on him . He was very rude and told me to mind my own business . I cannot put up with that . 
 John is a peacemaker.He simply doesn ’ t bother.He says he should give him a free hand . 
 I only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . I don ’ t think that tv is bad for kids . I think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes . 
 If you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch , remember to have something else for them to do . If you don ’ t , they ’ ll get bored and misbehave . 
 Sure . You could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time . 
 That ’ s a good idea . Remember that if the parents watch too much Tv , the kids will probably follow suit . 
 Did they finally fill that post , how come I haven't seen her ? She must have not been inducted yet . 
 Is she just working temporarily ? What are they going to do when Maggie comes back from leave . 
 what's up ? 
 what's wrong ? 
 Are you using dial-up or broadband ? 
 In that case , you need to turn on your airport . 
 do you like ever chat online ? 
 Oh , no . You can register for free . Just go to the yahoo website and it will tell you how to do it . 
 well , you can always block them . When I don't feel like talking to certain people online , that's what I do . 
 it's aubreyinchina@yahoo.com . 
 don't mention it . 
 What a bone head ! Be careful next time . 
 Yeah , about . 
 Oh , definitely . I remember , when I first arrived in Guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone . 
 I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation . 
 I am not exaggerating at all . I ’ m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time . 
 Yes , absolutely true . 
 Yeah.He never stops asking questions . 
 Do you like our new history teacher ? 
 You can't say that ! He's a very knowledgeable person . 
 Have you seen Harry ? 
 Yes , but he was supposed to be back by now . 
 You spoken English is pretty good . Please tell me your experience in learning English . 
 What's your method of learning ? 
 What if there is no chance ? I mean what if you don't have a partner , what will you do ? 
 That's a good idea . You are really creative . 
 Perfect.Couldn ' t be better ! 
 It's just what I wanted . 
 I'm really pleased with it.Thanks . 
 It's super . 
 Yeah . 
 Well , if that's the case , I don't mind breaking the image that they might have or the standards that they have . I can only do what I know , and live how I've lived all my life , because I'm a fairly stubborn person . 
 I don't go to parties . The parties I go to are the barbecues I have in my house . Being seen in the right places is something that I don't believe in . I don't believe in going to events just for the sake I of being seen . 
 Yes . I have a very low-key life ; I have a great life . I love what I do and I love how I spend my time , which isn't in a public place . 
 I've never had one person that I'd idolized . The comparisons to Jul-ia Roberts are incredibly flattering . I don't really know who I would compare myself to . I'd like to be a combination of a lot of people . A little bit of everything , really . I haven't quite figured out where my strengths are yet , and I've definitely found my weaknesses . 
 Normally at six . Before that , they spend several years in the kindergarten or pre-school education center . 
 Right . In the countryside , things are more complicated . 
 It depends . In some poor , underdeveloped areas , children's education is a problem . Many kids cannot afford to go to school . 
 Leave him alone , he ’ ll soon stop . 
 OK . Nothing serious . He just wants us to be with him . 
 Thank you . My husband gave it to me . 
 Yes I am . I got married five years ago . 
 No , we met at university . 
 Yes , it is . Thanks . I ’ m just surfing on the internet . 
 This cafe offers a wireless internet connection . That means I can get on the net for free while I ’ m here . Of course , I have to buy a cup of coffee ! 
 No . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city . 
 I ’ Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs . 
 It ’ s wonderful , isn ’ t it ? Would you like to see some photos that I look recently ? 
 Oh , it ’ s lovely . Think of the nasty weather we had last week . 
 Fine , thank you . And you ? 
 What's happening in your life ? 
 That sounds great . 
 My wife is really a chatter box . It ’ s so boring . 
 What is it ? 
 You ’ re a wonderful person , Kathleen . 
 And I ’ m so honored that you would want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasn ’ t truly worthy . 
 Don ’ t , don ’ t , don ’ t , don ’ t say that . That , that makes it worse . 
 You don ’ t love me ? 
 But we ’ re so right for each other . 
 My elder aunt feels like vomiting , she is pregnant . 
 But she feels like having no appetite at all if she stays at home all day . 
 Is this your umbrella , miss ? 
 You look a bit familiar to me . I wonder if I have seen you somewhere before . 
 May I ask where you live ? 
 That ’ s it . I live there , too . I live on the sixth floor . 
 It ’ s a small world ! May I know your name , miss ? 
 How do you do , Miss Chen ? I ’ m Song Mei . 
 Are you going to your office now , Miss Chen ? 
 It's very thoughtful of you to invite me to your wedding . 
 My best wishes to you and the bride ! 
 I have a sweet tooth . I can not help but think about having something sweet between meals . 
 That sounds really attractive . Let's go to that candy shop now . 
 why not ? I would like to buy some candies . Since there are so many people , I think they must have delicious candy . 
 They have lollypops , chocolate drops , fruit candy , mints , pearbrittles and toffee . They are in different colors and flavors . 
 Me too . I finally understand why a small shop like this can always befilmed with dozens of people . 
 You are a candy terminator . Be careful or you'll get a lot of cavities . 
 You really can't live without candy . 
 I really can't say . Both teams this year seem really good . 
 That sounds great ! 
 Good morning Mr . Li 
 Oh . It ’ s a nice day indeed 
 Really . For me too . 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry . 
 Yes , they do . It's great for them to tie the knot and get married . 
 Nothing seems to be happier for them . 
 I ’ d say , think twice about it . Well , you are not going to quit school , are you ? 
 What did you get ? 
 That's not bad . 
 Listen , John . I understand that you are such an excellent student and I know you must have lots of stress , but you really want to give up ? 
 I know . Don't worry . Do you know what you should do ? 
 You need to blow off some steam . The world is not on your shoulder . 
 Forget about school and exams . Come over to my house and have fun . I have some really good DVDs . 
 Then go to bed and have a good sleep . 
 Of course I am . Well , pleasant dreams ! 
 You are too picky . 
 Which guy ? 
 I can't see him . Where ? 
 Oh , I see him now . Wait ! That's ... 
 Oh , wow ! It's really him ! Who is that woman he's with ? 
 I can't do that . 
 Do you have a family tradition at Christmas time ? 
 What is it ? 
 That's it ? That's the tradition ? 
 I guess the spirit of it is what really makes any tradition fun . 
 Karen , do you have a minute ? I'd like to ask you about something . 
 I think you can give me some advice.You have worked here longer , and I just want to know what you think . 
 I am worried about the meeting this morning . 
 Really ? 
 I'm afraid I was too rude . 
 Well , I maybe talked to Mr . Drummond too directly . I thought I maybe said too much . I don't want him to be angry . 
 Really ? 
 But I am new here , and I'm not sure he is used to that . 
 Yes . And he is the president of the company . 
 I am very happy to hear that , Karen.It ' s good to know I'm working in such a company . 
 Good . Thank you for telling me this . 
 I really admire you , Diana . 
 you are really happy and able to achieve high scores at school . 
 isn't there anything else ? 
 you must have a high IQ score . 
 go ahead . 
 seriously ? But you are such a genius . 
 well , perhaps you're right . Sometimes EQ matters more than IQ . 
 oh , thank you . I'm going to the library , are you coming ? 
 Hey Sarah . Why are you limping ? 
 Was it your first time ? 
 I remember the first time I went . My back was sore , I couldn't sit down because it hurt my butt , and my legs would cramp if I walked too fast . 
 It's only like that the first couple of times . 
 You gotta give it a chance . It's fun after awhile . 
 Hi Mark . 
 How was your summer vacation ? 
 I took summer school . I withdrew from two of my classes last year so I wanted to make them up . 
 Yeah . And I have 5 credits to spare . I only needed to take 10 credits over the summer , but I took 15 because the price was the same . 
 She dropped out of school completely . 
 She worked at a startup company as an intern and since the business did well , they asked her if she wanted to work full time . 
 It sounds good now , but I'm traditional . I want the degree , so I wouldn't have accepted the offer . 
 I don't know . But I bet it must have been a good offer , or she wouldn't have accepted it . 
 Look at the dishes ! I have told you three times to put away these dishes . But now ... 
 I have told you that I don ’ t need them any more . The thing that really annoys me is that you played dumb with me . 
 Yes , I ’ m afraid I am . My husband is a smoker too . 
 No . But my husband smokes 20 or more a day . 
 I had my first cigarette when I was 17 . 
 Yes . Twice . 
 Just so-so . Where did you get it ? 
 I'd much rather buy expensive but good quality clothing , because it is not only nice but lasts a long time . 
 Don't brother me ! 
 Sorry , Sally , it's not your fault . 
 I drew a blank on the algebra test . 
 Yeah , but nothing was clear during the test . 
 I'm thinking of dropping out . 
 I'm dead serious about this , Sally . 
 Lisa , I'm home . 
 Pretty good . I've made a few friends already . 
 Well , Pam Franklin lives next door to us . By the way , can I go to her house this Saturday ? 
 That's what Pam said . 
 It's nice and bright today , isn't it ? 
 How about winter ? 
 It's boring , right ? 
 Do you get much rain during the summer ? 
 So you should bring an umbrella often . 
 Thank you for coming to see me off . 
 If have time , I'll come again . 
 Thank you for your hospitality . I hope I didn't cause you too much trouble during my stay . 
 I'm afraid I have to go now . The plane will take off soon . 
 May I invite you to dance with me ? 
 Never mind , I can teach you . 
 No , it is easy . 
 You just follow me . 
 Yup , because dance can relax myself . 
 Hmm , what should I wear today ? 
 Well , haven't you ever heard people say that there is always one piece of clothes missing from a woman's wardrobe ? 
 Loving to look beautiful is women's nature . In fact , I am thinking about going to my favorite clothing shop today . 
 Well , I need to change the shoes I bought from Nasi . They are too small . I want to ask them whether they come in a larger size . 
 I'm feeling hungry . 
 Yes , let's get something to eat . 
 What do you think of the way people use and treat animals ? 
 Perhaps people should stop eating animals . We could grow more crops . 
 We could provide them with better conditions anyway . We should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos . We should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible . 
 I agree . I ’ m an adult and I love going to the zoo . I don ’ t like animals experiments though . I believe that we can do tests in other ways . 
 That ’ s good news . The good thing is that most people treat their pets well . 
 Have you every given money to any of the charities that take care of animals . 
 I'll be seeing you around . 
 Did Bean send these dirty jokes to you , too ? Look ! 
 No wonder he asked for my address first-he just wants to harass me ! 
 Do you object to drinking black tea , Mr.Zhang ? 
 Do you drink green tea , then ? 
 But if the tea is good and well prepared , it will do much good . 
 Not only can it appease one's thirst , but it can also refresh one when tired . 
 Why is it so ? 
 I just heard your boy had taken the first place in the history test . He is super cool . 
 Jennifer , would you like to have dinner with me ? 
 Is today OK ? 
 How about tomorrow night ? 
 Is 9:00 PM all right ? 
 Is 6:00 PM OK ? 
 The Italian restaurant on 5th street . 
 How about the Korean restaurant next to it ? 
 Hi , long time no see . How have you been ? 
 Tell me all about it . 
 Oh , I see . What makes you think that ? 
 Really ? What happened ? 
 I see what you mean . I understand why you're concerned . Have you tried talking to your son about it ? 
 You may be right , but it doesn't hurt to find out more about what's going on in his life . 
 I don't know about that , but my door is always open . Stop by anytime . 
 Nothing special . 
 That's great . I would love to . And when ? 
 No problem . However , maybe I should come early to help you prepare the dinner . 
 All right , see you tonight . 
 Hello Mei , How about going for a meal this evening ? 
 Ok that sounds good . Where shall I meet you ? 
 Ok great , I ’ ll see you at six . 
 I'd like to meet you again sometime . 
 Anytime . You can reach me at 5558929 . 
 Fine . 
 Bye , Jason . 
 Fine . I miss you so much , uncle Benjamin . 
 It's been 3 years now . 
 How is aunty Shirley ? 
 How has May been ? 
 When she told me that she would marry no man but Dick , my heart was almost in my mouth . 
 I could not and can ’ t make out the reason why she would set her heart on a man like Dick . He plays the field with many girls . 
 Excuse me . May I take a picture of you and your little boy ? 
 It ’ s for a book . 
 Thank you . I appreciate your help . 
 Why , thank you . I wasn't sure if it looked okay or not . I can't believe all the words the salesgirl said . 
 I'm glad that you think so . I thought it might be a bit too revealing . 
 I got it on sale down at the department store . 
 I was just there a couple of days ago . You know , you should go down there too . They have a lot of stylish clothes on sale . 
 Anything you want . They have both casual and formal styles . 
 That's a good idea . Some of your ties are pretty outdated . 
 Anyways , are you going to the party tonight ? 
 I don't think so . It is a little too formal . I'm probably going to wear something more laid back . 
 I guess that you will really be dressing down . 
 Good point . I suppose that we all have our own individual styles . 
 I'm fine , thanks . And you ? 
 Oh , nothing much really . And how is everything with you ? 
 What have you been doing ? 
 Really ? Good luck for them . 
 They're both very well , thanks . 
 I'm going to do some shopping.Why don't you come with me ? 
 It's been nice talking to you . 
 Mom , look , that cake looks delicious . My mouth is watering . 
 What a pin-up she is ! 
 That's incredible ! She has such a sharp figure . 
 What's the date today Mr.Brown ? I don't have a calendar . 
 25th Sep ? Oh , I have an appointment tonight . 
 It is at 8 o'clock . 
 I don't know what time it is . 
 I have to go now . I don't want to be late . 
 Hi , Michelle . Do you need to use the photocopier ? 
 Oh , I'm fine , thanks . I'm super busy with work actually . Did you hear about the Lawson contract ? 
 Well , I was discussing the contract with Bill and he said that they met the head of Lawsons last week . 
 And hopefully they are going to confirm the deal on Wednesday , fingers crossed . 
 I will , Michelle . Speak to you soon . 
 I like almost all kinds of music . But I like country music best . 
 I wish I had been there ! 
 You have good taste in music . 
 I am returning these books . 
 I accidentally ripped the cover . 
 How much do I need to pay ? 
 That ’ s not too expensive . 
 Here ’ s the $ 5.00 . 
 No problem . Have a good one . 
 Hi , Randy . What are you going to do this weekend ? 
 How about going hunting with me ? 
 Okay . I ’ ll pick you up around 6 
 How is your business on the Internet , Steven ? 
 I am sorry to hear that . It shows that you should buy companies , not ideas . 
 Yes , I agree with you . I am going to find a good company and invest in it soon . 
 Yes , I will . I should learn more from you . After all I am green hand on it . 
 OK . My wife sent me a message and asked me to go home just now . I am leaving . 
 Bye . 
 To New York . 
 Tomorrow morning . 
 Three days . 
 On Friday . 
 Oh , what ’ s he like ? 
 Yes . 
 Um , that ’ s good . 
 Now I understand . But I don't smoke or drink.So what am I supposed to buy in here ? 
 No , I'm sorry . I don't think it is nice to have butterflies mounted in boxes.It is kind of disgusting . 
 Yes . I think they should just let them fly free , and not try to sell them to foreigners . It is a kind of destruction of nature . 
 Who knows ? Hey , I like these jade bears here . 
 This one is 2300 dollars.Maybe I should buy it for my mother . What do you think ? 
 Yes , but she would like this a lot . She likes to collect little things like this . 
 Maybe I could buy some Cognac for my brother . He always drinks it . 
 What's new ? 
 Hi , Monica , I got big news . 
 Not really , just take a wild guess . 
 Well , it is not going to happen so soon , I guess . 
 Ok , I lost 5 pounds . 
 What's the problem ? 
 Let me take a look . Maybe I can figure it out . 
 You ’ re a big fan of Andy Lau , aren ’ t you ? 
 How come you don ’ t have all of his films on DVD ? 
 I see . I ’ m sure you ’ ll find them one day . I see you also have several poster of him . 
 Are you a member of his fan club ? 
 Did you see the interview with Andy Lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ? 
 Two copies ? One to keep and one to cut the pictures out of , right ? 
 Bread . 
 Orange juice . 
 I think mutton is best . 
 I like champagne . 
 Banana of course . 
 I always have meals outside , because I ’ m not good at cooking . 
 Really ? I thought the exhibition showed that he had real talent . What did you think of it ? 
 I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever read a good review of an exhibition by that critic . He doesn ’ t seem to like anything . Which kinds of paintings do you prefer ? 
 Yes , I do . I like painters who use will rather than watercolors . The colors appear richer . What do you think ? 
 Yes . Good artwork is very expensive nowadays . When I was in china , I bought some calligraphy by famous artists . You should come and see it sometime . 
 I know what the characters on the paintings mean . I think Chinese characters look very artistic . It ’ s said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist ’ s character . 
 Jenny , are you having fun here ? 
 I ’ m glad you ’ re enjoying it . 
 It ’ s my pleasure . Would you like another glass of champagne ? 
 What do you think of the play showed last night ? 
 Yes , I turned it off when the fight got heated in it . 
 Hey , Tom , I want to learn how to play golf . 
 I want to do everything I can . 
 No . Can I rent clubs ? 
 What kinds of clubs ? 
 I'll buy a set . But you have to teach me . 
 You are married to a foreigner , aren't you ? So what's it like ? 
 Yeah , I know what you mean . The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples , not to mention two people from different cultures . 
 Oh , so he's half Chinese and half American . That's unusual . What languages does he speak , then ? 
 What does he look like ? Can people tell ? 
 What do you mean his grandmothers are already dead ? Wait a minute , you don't think he's avoiding me , do you ? 
 Oh man , I hate rejection . It really makes you feel terrible , especially when you really liked the person . 
 How do you do , Mr.Smith ? This is Lili . I'm calling to thank you for the wonderful dinner we had yesterday . I enjoyed it very much . 
 Thank you , Mr.Smith . I'm returning to China today . 
 Yes . I appreciate all help and in particular , all the time that you've spent on my account during my stay here . 
 If there's anything that I can help you in the future , please let me know . 
 Do you buy that newspaper every day ? 
 Is there a Sunday edition of that newspaper ? 
 What section does it have ? 
 What ’ s in that section ? 
 I buy a national newspaper sometimes , buy I nearly always buy a local evening newspaper . I find the local news more interesting than national or international news . 
 Ha , I am flattered . Actually , when it comes to negotiate , you don ’ t need to like it . You just need to understand how it works . 
 Well , generally speaking , if you want to change someone ’ s mind or understand his position , you have to put yourself in his shoes . Understand his need and the cost for his need . And then you work together to find a solution . 
 Ok , as John after Kennedy put it , let us never negotiate out of fear , but let us never fear to negotiate . 
 I've said you will enjoy your life here ! 
 Oh , I've forgotten to tell you . The party is held every other week . And every family gives their own performance each time . 
 That's good ! 
 Oh , my God ! That's my husband , Benjamin . 
 He likes American Idol very much , and he always imitates the contestant at home . I can't believe he got on the stage himself . 
 OK , just ignore him . I've noticed there are lots of exercise facilities in our community . After dinner you can go there for a walk with your family ! 
 Yes , there is one behind our building . And you can play tennis there . But if you want to play tennis there , they will change you 30 Yuan per hour . 
 You are welcome ! We are neighbors ! 
 Yeah . You said it . 
 I ’ Ve done that . The doctor advised me to cut out smoking and drinking . 
 He's out of the hospital and up and about again at last . 
 You said you like classical music very much . Then who is your favorite opera star ? 
 Oh , you mean Pavarotti , Domingo and Carreras . Have you been to their live shows ? 
 I've heard of that one . It was also his swan song . 
 Of course not . People all over the world watch it on TV , or listen to it on the radio . 
 Yes , I went to the New Year's Concert in 2005 . 
 That's for sure . You know , it's really amazing to be in the best concert hall , listening to the performance by the best orchestra . I had the greatest time ever . 
 Lorin Maazel . He did an amazing job . Moreover , he just celebrated his 75th birthday . 
 The right opportunity for you would come along soon . You know , music is transnational . 
 I really need to find a parking spot . 
 Do you know any spaces on campus ? 
 Where is it located ? 
 Do you have any idea if the parking structure has any spaces left ? 
 What time was it when you went up there ? 
 It wouldn't be full right now , would it ? 
 Ok . Let ’ s look at our short presentation on China . What do we need to include ? 
 Ok . China is about the same size as Canada and the united states and it has a population of about 1.3 billion , making it the latest country in the world by population . 
 We need to say something about the geography and climate of china . Is there any way to divide the country into sections ? 
 That sounds very general . 
 One from each part ? Lhasa , Urumqi , Harbin , shanghai , and hongkong . The capital city is Beijing , right ? 
 We should take a large map and highlight those cities . What is each of them famous for ? 
 A really dreadful accident and many people were killed . 
 Yeah , well , I fill you in one the details later . 
 Who is responsible for the accident ? Is it Tony ’ s fault ? 
 You mean Tony is the victim ? No , I don ’ t think so . He ’ s equally responsible because he tried to overtake you . 
 Did you hear who won the English speech contest ? 
 It's George . 
 He's honest , hardworking and responsible . I simply can't find any shortcoming of his as an employee . 
 Don't be so jealous . He never speaks ill of you before me . 
 But Grandpa will be working . 
 I almost forget . 
 Really ? Are you sure ? 
 Yeah but , it is something that you will have forever ! They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . On top of all that , I have heard it hurts a lot ! 
 Of course ! They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink . 
 I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . Also , find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles , and that the place is hygienic . 
 our company is going to do some cutbacks soon . 
 I met with the supervisor just this morning . I don't know , but I am a little worried . Who do you think will get sacked ? 
 no , it's not going to be George . I don't think it's Andy either . He is involved with the boss's sister in-law . And you know how whipped our boss is . 
 Lisa ? No way . I've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . You know rumors can't come out from nowhere . 
 no , that would be crazy . But then who will it be ? Oh dear , it must be me . I should have known it ! Why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . What should I do ? I've got a family t 
 Do you often surf the Internet ? 
 Is it very interesting ? 
 Oh , I'll have a try . 
 Say it ! What is it ? 
 You know you shouldn't say that at a time like this . 
 Too sudden ! I'm not ready for it . 
 Stop it . No more of that talk . 
 No , I shall faint . 
 Yes . 
 No , I think Harry will get it . 
 OK , loser buys pizza tomorrow night . 
 Oh , it's nothing to speak of . 
 Thank you . I appreciate the compliment . 
 Oh , it's nothing to speak of . 
 Thank you . I appreciate the compliment . 
 You mean the one with the yellow bricks ? But last time I saw it , it wasn ’ t really in business yet . I saw some people inside furnishing the rooms . Is it open now ? 
 Great , I like the idea of trying some new food . 
 Also some traditional Chinese food , like noodles and dumpling are marketed in modern ways with improved food quality . I heard this year , the government has imposed very stringent inspection on the hygiene conditions restaurants and suppliers of food are also under tighter control . 
 You were right . It's raining again . 
 Hi . What's up ? 
 Not too much . I've been pretty busy . 
 Gotta go . Call me tonight . 
 What's all this noise about ? 
 Why ? 
 How many people are there in your family ? 
 I have a large family . I have three older sisters , my twin sister , a younger brother , and parents . 
 We ’ re identical . I mean , we look exactly the same , but we are complete opposites when it comes to everything else . 
 We used to be really close , but that all changed once she moved to Shanghai . How about your family ? You didn ’ t mention to your biological father . 
 What about your step-brother ’ s mother ? Does he keep in touch with her ? 
 Sounds like it was meant to be . 
 Yeah . There's nobody in sight . 
 I think you're right . Let's go . 
 Really ? He is so great . 
 Surely I want . It's quite popular nowadays . 
 Where are you going ? 
 What are you going to do there ? 
 What's he doing ? 
 Are you going to the movie theater with me tonight ? 
 Titanic is playing tonight . It's a blockbuster . 
 OK , let's meet at the movie theater entrance tonight . Don ’ t be late . 
 ( After watching the movie . ) Are you crying ? 
 Tragic movie ? I think it's a love story . 
 Ah , you're just too emotional . 
 Many people play sports in China , don't they ? 
 I expect all Chinese can play table tennis . 
 Do you like playing table tennis ? 
 Are indoor sports popular ? 
 Really ? I like playing basketball , too . 
 That's great . 
 You are pretending ! 
 It's wrong because---it isn't true . 
 Well , no-that is , I've heard Linda say they do , but ... Thank you . But please don't speak to me again . 
 Both our countries are quite small . How would you describe the landscape in your country ? 
 Is it really completely flat ? 
 Yes , there are . They are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries . 
 That doesn ’ t sound too bad . Great for sunbathing ! The coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . There are cliffs , then sandy beaches . Then rocks . There are lots of caves in the cliffs . There are also many small islands off the coast , but few people lives on them . 
 We also have waterfalls in the mountains . They make the landscapes look very scenic . The landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion , especially by water . 
 Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English . 
 Not always.Sometimes we don't understand her.Then she has to repeat what she said . 
 Mario and I are the best students in the class.Miss.Parker says that my pronunciation is very good . 
 Sometimes it's difficult.Some words look different from the way one pronounces them . 
 Have fun . 
 What happened that you didn't get it done ? 
 Well , you had more than one day ; couldn't you have fit it in on another day ? 
 Either way , I only allow one missed assignment per semester . When will you be turning the make-up in ? 
 Fine , but it cannot happen again if you want an “ A ” in the class . 
 Remember that you are in college now , not high school . 
 Give me a little while longer . 
 There you go . How do you like it ? 
 You think it looks nice ? 
 Thanks . I'm glad that I did a good job . 
 Just give me $ 55 . 
 No problem , girl friend . I'll see you next time . 
 My dissertation . I put it somewhere last night and I can't find it now . 
 Yes , I kept on typing it until midnight , but it is lost . 
 Yes , but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk . 
 I've searched everywhere . Where on earth did I put it ? 
 I have been working on it for a whole month and it's too late to write another . Just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . How could I do such a thing ? 
 Let me see . Yes , that's it . Where did you find it ? 
 My poor memory . Thank you very much . 
 I've been having a hard time sleeping lately . 
 well , I'm really worried about my grades . I didn't think this course would be so stressful . 
 you're probably right . I just wish it were that simple . How can I stop feeling so anxious all the time ? 
 I don't really have time to learn anything new . I need to spend my time studying ! 
 you ’ re right . I usually end up starting at my computer or checking my email instead of doing my work for class . 
 that ’ s fantastic . I ’ m going to go try that out in my room now . good night ! 
 Before we begin eating , I'd like to present everyone with a gift from Taiwan . 
 It's a Taiwanese puppet doll . 
 Yeah . They're usually this big . 
 All the parts work . 
 Don't mention it . 
 The balcony is still available . 
 No , I'm afraid that's it . 
 Yeah . 
 I have found myself a date mate . 
 A barrel of fun , of course . He often says that I'm a date bait . 
 Yes , thank you . 
 Thanks . 
 OK , OK , this is good . Keep talking . What about cappuccino and all those other drinks ? 
 Froth ? 
 Thanks , Hugh . I owe you one . 
 Don't believe him.He ' s a liar . 
 Another weekend is coming ! 
 Yes.What will you do this weekend ? 
 Hello , Tom . How do you find the dinner of yesterday ? 
 It's nice of you to say so . 
 Don't mention it . You know , we ’ re old friends . 
 Yes . Why ? 
 That ’ s great . I'd love to . 
 Is your waist any better ? 
 I ’ m glad you are getting better . 
 Then when will you be back again ? 
 I hope to see you at that time again . Bye . 
 When I was a little boy , I had a dream of becoming a lawyer . 
 Yes , I knew I would make it . 
 This is my uncle , Charles . 
 He's a captain . 
 Exactly ! 
 As a matter of fact , he hasn't been feeling too well . 
 Tell him I hope he's better soon . 
 Are you a soccer fan ? 
 Which team is your favorite ? 
 I like the Brazilians . They are the real champions . 
 I can't sleep ... 
 Exactly . I'm too excited for Christmas morning . Also , I thought I heard Santa . 
 Well , I heard that naughty boys and girls get coal in their stockings , so I thought I'd be nice and make Santa cookies . I even left out some milk . I heard someone in the kitchen eating the cookies , so I came downstairs ! 
 Really ? 
 O-K ... 
 Hey Eve , how are you ? 
 I ’ m ok . I ’ m so busy ! 
 Yes . Don ’ t you ? 
 Which class are you working on right now ? 
 Are you in Mrs Green ’ s class ? 
 Yes . We must have the same exam tomorrow ! 
 Sure . This library is too quiet though . 
 That sounds good . 
 Are you ready to go the concert ? 
 Actually , why don't we go there by bike ? We could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in rush hour . 
 Is your helmet comfortable ? 
 Maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better . 
 Is that your new bicycle ? 
 It's the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike . These are really expensive ! 
 I can fix those for you . Is there anything else wrong with it ? 
 That's easy . It's important to have the saddle high enough so that your legs can extend fully when you are on your bicycle . 
 It's possible . Give me a minute and I can fix these for you and then we can go . 
 But you just got here . Can ’ t you stay a little longer and have some tea ? 
 That ’ s too bad . 
 Thanks for coming . 
 Great idea . I ’ m looking forward to it . See you then . 
 Good night then . 
 I'm going for a walk , Yi-jun . I need some time to myself . 
 I just can't right now . Everyone will be talking about Taylor and ... 
 I need to come to grips with his death first . And I also need to prepare a eulogy in case I'm asked to speak tomorrow . 
 You're going to get into a lot of trouble if you do that . 
 I don't see anything wrong with what we're doing ! That's just the problem . In these kind of things , the trouble doesn't always appear at first . 
 Everything has gone as smooth as clockwork . Just like we planned ! That may be true , but if you were to do it , you would have trouble on the horizon . You always say that . 
 Okay . Have it your way , but don't say I didn't warn you . 
 But I don ’ t have a pen with me . May I use a pencil ? 
 this party rocks ! 
 I'm with you on that . Check out that one over there . I think I'm in love ! 
 oh , that's Janice . She's just new in town . You have a thing for blonds , eh ? 
 I bet . Why not go over and talk to her ? She's really nice . 
 come on ! Man up ! You'll never know until you try . 
 all right . But I think you ought to move soon . 
 I can see five other guys eying her up . 
 good luck ! 
 Not really . I could take it or leave it . 
 How can you do that ? 
 Why are you so pessimistic ? 
 Only for this reason ? 
 Don't worry about it . Practice makes perfect . I will lend you some listening materials , so that you can practise more before the exam . I believe you can pass the exam with good preparation . 
 Hello ! So you are leaving today . 
 It is my pleasure to see you off . 
 I hope so , too . 
 You're welcome . Have a nice trip ! 
 He was really influenced by the way they do things on the west coast . I guess the working atmosphere is a lot more relaxed and casual in California . It comes from the information technology industry .. there isn't such a large division between home and office , so people want to work in the clothes they feel more relaxed in . 
 It's not as bad as that ... We are allowed to wear more casual jackets and trousers . Besides , didn't you hear what Brian found on his desk this morning ? 
 Management decided to give him four brand new white shirts . That's their way of telling him that his new style of dressing down is not quite acceptable . 
 What for ? 
 Why , you look pretty all right . 
 Why ? What's wrong ? 
 I guess you'll have to wing it . 
 yes , I did . I won a prize for best local history book at the annual book awards . 
 actually , I was happy just to get the book published . Winning the prize was an added bonus . 
 I won $ 200 to spend on any books of my choice . 
 I shared a prize with some friends last week . We won a bottle of whisky at a pub quiz . 
 To be frank , I find philosophy rather boring . 
 How could you manage to pass the exam ? 
 What date is it today ? 
 Look at the girls in the street . They all have a bunch of flowers.Is it Valentine's Day ? 
 Did you have a fight with Jack ? 
 Come on , dear ! You forgot it , too . 
 Is that your phone ? 
 Wow ! Good timing . 
 Come on ! Three's a crowd ! 
 Just go ! It's Valentine's Day ! 
 That ’ s a matter of opinion . 
 I worked with him for two years . That was the worst time in my career . 
 Hey ! I learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns ! 
 Whatever ... Smell ! Perfume samples ! 
 You mean , you like the pictures of the beautiful models ... Hello ? 
 We have two cleaning ladies . But both of them have received little education . 
 But I actually dislike another lady . She is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . But the trouble is she Isa backseat driver with some of us . She would tell you what to do and where to put things . 
 Yes . He carries a lot of weight . Everyone here is willing to follow his orders . 
 It's Gone With the Wind . 
 I enjoy the various characters and the plot . 
 Is it very interesting ? 
 If I have a chance , I'll enjoy the book . 
 That's a good idea.Let ' s go ! 
 Thank you , Rick . We ’ Ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams , Brazil and China , face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round . Without a doubt , both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match . 
 Xu spikes it ! Wow , what a great hit ! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in ! 
 Brazil calls for a time out and we ’ ll be right back , after a short commercial break . 
 I am going to attend an interview . 
 My major is English . Of course I'll apply for an English teacher . 
 Why ? You said my skirt was beautiful just now . 
 Then what should I do ? 
 I don't know how John can put up with his son , who fools around without working . 
 If I were him , I would give him a good talking-to . I would insist on his stopping fooling around like that . 
 I ’ m looking forward to seeing Westminster abbey , where many historical figures are buried , like Isaac Newton , the great mathematician and Winston Churchill , the great wartime leader . 
 Women have often played an important role in British history . Queen Elizabeth I built a navy strong enough to fight off the Spanish armada in 1588 . more recently , Margaret thatcher transformed british society in the 1980 ’ s . 
 There ’ s a lot to see there . Perhaps we should go tomorrow . 
 I ’ Ve seen them before . They ’ re quite incredible . If you want to see historical figures in London , there ’ s one place you have to go . 
 There you can see british leaders , entertainers , criminals , and royalty . 
 so , how should we go to the theatre ? 
 I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you . 
 it wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus . 
 train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too . 
 we're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi . 
 fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives . 
 don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you . 
 see , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip ! 
 It's the mailman , Mother . Here's a letter from Uncle George . 
 When's he coming ? 
 Let me look at the calendar . Good ! The twenty-fourth is a Saturday . Is he coming alone ? 
 Mother , I don't remember the girls . How old are they ? 
 Are they going to stay here with us ? 
 Mother , may we have a party ? 
 Prepare the list , Mother . I can go shopping . I can go to the small stores.Everyone knows me there . 
 Oh , I am terribly sorry . But I was so captivated with the singer at the subway exit . So I forgot the time . 
 Oh , no , the guy was a musician who just sang . He played the guitar and sang so many cool pop songs . Many people were drawn to his music and there was no hat on the floor . He sang for appreciation , but not for money . 
 Oh , no , it was a kind of pop art . I like it but I couldn't do it that well . 
 No , but tell me some . I am interested . 
 Are there many people there ? Do you think people actually like them ? 
 But I still prefer the pop music in the subway . 
 Dad , you talk well , but can you appreciate that kind of art ? 
 It's wonderful to be in the mountains after a hustle bustle week . 
 Can we stop here for a while ? My backpack is very heavy . 
 Let me see . It's not an eagle . I think it's a vulture . 
 I don't think so . Let's walk by the stream . I am sure we can find the waterfall on the map . 
 I also brought a bottle of water and some provisions . If you are hungry , you can let me know . 
 Well , it is a birch tree.It is not as old as you think . 
 Because its trunk is not thick enough to be like a thousand-year-old tree . 
 Sure , honey , we ’ re talking now , aren ’ t we ? 
 Yeah . I know . 
 You know , I think you ’ re awesome . 
 Honey ... 
 Baby , I love you so much . 
 I love you . And I think you ’ re awesome . 
 Come on . Put the gun down . 
 Would you like to come over for dinner tonight ? 
 When did you decide to become a vegetarian ? 
 That's great . Do you find that you eat a lot more fruit and vegetables now ? 
 You've really turned into a health nut , haven't you ? 
 How do you get enough protein in your diet ? 
 Well , don't worry about dinner . I'll only make vegetarian dishes for you . Do you like sushi ? 
 How about a spicy tofu and vegetable stir-fry ? 
 Dinner will be ready at about 7:30 pm , so you can come over at 7 p . m . 
 How old is Keith ? 
 He ’ s a year older than Keith , but he looks younger . 
 He ’ s fine . He retired last week . It ’ s turning going in his life . Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement . 
 Oh , I don ’ t think he wants to . He wants to travel to several different countries around the world . 
 How do you want to spend your old age ? 
 Is this seat taken ? 
 Thanks . 
 Yes , on a business trip . How about Yuu ? 
 Yes , I Went there once last summer . 
 I think it is amazing . You can enjoy both the traditional Chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city . The only thing I didn't enjoy was the subway . 
 Yes.These were always so many people.After taking the subway during the rush hour , you'll envy sardines in their cans . 
 That's a good idea . Wish you a great vacation ! 
 I love ice cream . 
 I like both strawberry and coffee ice cream . 
 Would you like to go skiing with me ? I heard the new ski area is great . They have safe tracks , especially for the beginners and provide free training . I think it suits you best . 
 Well , Then you can go to the three-day-long training camp first . There ’ re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise . 
 Come on ! It is really a fun game . 
 Of course . It's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . Don't you like watching it ? 
 That's true . For various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics . You know , the low temperature may cause many problems . 
 When the Olympic Games started in modern times , only summer events were included . When it grew popular , there came the Winter Olympic Games , which includes a variety of winter sports . 
 Figure skating . In my eye , nothing beats it . 
 Oh , I didn't expect you to know them . But yes , I love them not only because of many medals they've won , but also because of their spirits . 
 Sure . What about you ? What do you like about the Olympics ? 
 Hey , young man , you are so deep today . 
 It is difficult for old people to do away with old ideas . 
 Government is making efforts to change situation . 
 Does she make any sense to you ? 
 She's speaking French , not Greek . 
 Me neither . All I have to do is study French hard . 
 How are you going all these days ? 
 But you look depressed . 
 Is it serious ? 
 How about your family ? 
 So what do you feel like doing this evening ? How about going to the cinema ? 
 That's good ! I've also heard there will be a party held by the Students ' Union tomorrow evening . Would you like to go with me tomorrow night ? 
 Why ? Do you have to prepare for your examination ? Oh , come on , girl , relaxation is also very important . 
 Oh , God , I've forgotten it . 
 Oh , no , I don't want to know any more geeks like you . 
 Really ? Is there a foreign teacher for every class ? 
 So you just talk all the time ? 
 That sounds interesting . I'll go with you tomorrow evening . 
 You ’ re going to set up your own law office , aren ’ t you ? 
 If you need help , don ’ t hesitate to ask me . 
 I ’ d like to wish you every success in your new venture . 
 Good luck to you . 
 Yes , do you like it ? 
 Yt looks good on the outside , but the inside is a different story . It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again . 
 Well , first of all , it needs a new engine , which is extremely expensive . 
 It must have been a few years ago now . 
 They do . Once my son was born , there was no reason to drive this car anymore . It's only a two-seater , you know ! 
 The heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer ! 
 The brakes don't really work that well anymore either . 
 It costs more than you think to run a car---especially when there are so many things wrong with it ! 
 Can you play baseball with me today ? 
 Where's the new house ? Is it far from here ? 
 Can I help you pack ? 
 I think I need a new notebook . 
 You bet there is . Feast your eyes on this puppy ! 
 Believe it ! 
 Dalian is a beautiful city . Do you agree ? 
 The climate here is pleasant . 
 This city is really comfortable to live in . 
 No other city can match it . It's heaven . 
 Maybe . 
 Ah , Michelle , hi . I was hoping to see you . How have you been ? How's the family ? 
 I'm fine thanks . I got your report this morning . Thank's for that . Are you joining the conference today ? 
 Good , well we can discuss this more then , but I think the figures are looking very good for this quarter . 
 I'm planning to discuss the advertising budget at the conference . I don't think we should continue with the TV advertising . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Don't tell me you actually believe all that ? Don't be so gullible , they are just urban legends . They are just stories people make up to scare you . 
 You really think an artist or song writer is going to go through the trouble of putting subliminal or satanic messages in a song ? Don't be so naive ! 
 Sounds a bit too far fetched to be true , don't you think ? 
 I am very pleased to meet you . 
 That sounds an interesting job , Bob . 
 What are you so excited about ? 
 What ’ s the big deal ? It ’ s just a picture of some woman . 
 There are tons of other paintings that I think are better . 
 No , how much is it worth ? 
 Whoa . 
 A man stepped on my feet when I was waiting for the taxi . 
 On 20th May 1963 . 
 27th day of the fourth month . 
 It will begin at 5 thirty . 
 You can see it tomorrow . 
 See you . 
 Did you see the 2005 Grammy Awards on TV last night . 
 He seems to win awards everywhere . 
 I heard one observer even said ' It was a song sung in Spanish for international football , and he made it so popular that even the Americans loved it . ' 
 Ben cancelled his trip . 
 Because General , his dog , got sick . 
 Hi Jane , you look great . 
 Yes , I took off 4 kilos . I am glad you notice it . 
 No no , I just changed my eating habits . I eat a balance meal . and I eat less than before . 
 It may comfort you to know that many people attended his viewing . 
 In times of loss , it is often hard to pick up the phone . But his whole family was here . 
 And he was so young , with so much life to look forward to . 
 This sheet tells the visiting hours and funeral time and location . 
 Uh , I can see a red double decker bus . It's the kind of bus you'll see very often in London . In fact I know this bus is from London because I can see the names , Chelsea , Sloan Square , Victoria , Herring Cross . These are all areas in London . Um , so obviously the bus is in London . 
 Yeah , yeah , yeah . many times . Many times . When I was younger , you used to get double-decker all over England but now you only tend to see them in the big cities . 
 Well , it depends on the journey . It's .. I guess it's not too expensive , but the minimum price you would pay is , for a short journey , is about a pound . 
 Hmm , yeah , well this girl here at the back , that's leaning on the door , um , she looks really bored , actually . Maybe she is going to work or something and she doesn't want to go ! 
 Uh , well , no , not really , because I haven't worked in England for a long time , so I haven't taken a bus for a long time . 
 Um , yes , sometimes . Sometimes . 
 Don ’ t worry , you did a good job and it should be fine . 
 That ’ s the way to go . 
 It ’ s great . 
 May I renew them if I haven't finished reading them ? 
 Bob , you look pale . What happened ? 
 Did you have something on your mind ? You look so concerned ! Maybe I can help you . 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 I know your feeling . Take it easy . 
 The Spur . 
 They managed a 99:80 victory . 
 Cheer up ! It's not the only chance in life to do well on a test . There'll be many more . 
 Don't worry about it . All in all , you've done very well in school . 
 She is going to get married . 
 I don ’ t know . 
 But he has the sex scandal . 
 I agree . He is also an excellent speaker . 
 yeah , it ’ s fair to say so . 
 I've had enough of it while working under the sun in the day . I don't need any more sun-tan . 
 It might be good to you . But please keep in mind that too much tanning damages the skin rather than does any good to you . You might end up with skin cancer . 
 Why not ? 
 Do we have enough time ? 
 The performance is excellent . 
 I couldn't agree more . 
 Yes , it is . 
 Yes , but it's much smaller . 
 OK . 
 Yeah , clearly blue sky.But it is a bit too hot for me . I don't like heat and humidity . 
 That's a thought . It's still early , and the beach isn't crowded at this time of the day . If we don't stay too long , we won't get sunburned . 
 There won't be anyone there to appreciate how cute you are . 
 If you are going to husband hunting in a bikini , then I want to wear one , too . 
 Thanks , how about the green and black one ? 
 It's a beautiful day , isn't it ? 
 Do you now the temperature today ? 
 How nice . I hope the weather will stay like this for the whole week . I'm going on the canoe trip this weekend . 
 What a nuisance ! Every time I plan to go canoeing or camping , a storm comes along . The sky gets dark , the wind starts to howl and the temperature drops.Well , I'd better stay home . 
 That's smart . I'm going to start doing the same thing . 
 yes . Should we go there by bus so we aren't late ? 
 that's true . Cycling is good for our environment , too . Let me just get my helmet then . 
 not really , but I liked the design , so I got it . 
 I'll think about it . 
 yes , my father gave it to me for my birthday . Do you like it ? 
 nothing but the best from my dad . I like everything about it except for the brakes . They are a bit sticky . 
 well , my saddle is too low for me . Do you know how to change the height ? 
 is that why my knees have felt sore after every time I've ridden my bike ? 
 Next please ! Hello sir , may I see your passport please ? 
 Will you be checking any bags today . 
 I ’ m sorry , sir . Airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage , at twenty kilograms each , plus one piece of carry-on luggage . I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase . 
 I am sorry , sir , there ’ s nothing I can do . You cannot board the flight with that large bag either.Carry - on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat . That bag is clearly too big . 
 Let ’ s see ... six hundred and twenty-five US dollars . 
 Do you feel like going to see a movie tonight ? 
 How does 7:30 sound ? 
 How are you ? 
 I haven ’ t seen you for several days . 
 What ’ s he doing ? 
 He must be happy . 
 Fine too . 
 Rock ' n'Roll , I guess . 
 Not really . That ’ s pretty heavy metal . 
 But yesterday you said you would rent it . 
 Why is that ? 
 Maybe you ’ re right . 
 Fine , thank you.How are you doing this morning ? 
 Yes . I've been to New York . I got back only yesterday . 
 Very much.New York is such a nice place.Shall I show you some photographs ? 
 You too . I hope to see you soon.Goodbye . 
 You ready ? 
 Are you ready to transfer to a new school tomorrow ? 
 You ’ re not nervous , are you ? 
 Why are you nervous ? 
 That ’ s not a problem . 
 It ’ s fun meeting new people . 
 Did you see Victor on Wednesday , Wendy ? 
 Wasn ’ t it cold on Wednesday ? 
 It ’ s so nice and quiet in the woods . 
 It sounds wonderful . Did you take lunch with you ? 
 Wow ! That ’ s a pretty dress , but it ’ s too expensive . 
 It ’ s because of good quality and the fine design . 
 Anyhow , this dress is really elegant . 
 Business couldn't be better . 
 Welcome . I could use the help . 
 It doesn't matter . I just feel a little dizzy . 
 I don't know . 
 Oh , through a lot of hard work , of course . 
 Surely it was , especially when you only knew few people and little English . 
 Right . I only knew a few English sentences . 
 First , I worked as a servant . 
 I'd like to , but I must run to a meeting . 
 We've been able to survey and track some of the information of our website users through some cookie technology , and it's surprising to see the results . 
 From the numbers , it seems nearly half of the visitors who stumble onto our page pick up the link not from network browsers or search engines , but from our circular insert . That means our consumers are purposefully and actively seeking information about our products and services through the web format . Based on these findings , I am completely convinced the internet is the marketing power of the future ! 
 Well , these mediums are still important ... they aren't a thing of the past ... But I think they might be less important now than in the past . The technology age has arrived ! 
 Her acting is OK . 
 I'm afraid I know less than you do.Tell me more about her , will you ? 
 Sure , no problem . What are you trying to get ? 
 OK . This machine needs you to use that change machine first to get correct change . 
 First you put your money in the dollar slot or the coin slot . The dollars have to be smooth . 
 Just know that sometimes the money doesn't go in perfectly the first time and you have to try again . 
 Choose what you want and push the button . Sometimes it takes a couple of tries . 
 Hope that works for you ! 
 Oh , my god , are you OK ? 
 Come on , sit down , and let me have a look . 
 I told you to wear running shoes . But you don't listen . 
 Hold on , don't move , I will take care of that . 
 I will get some ice , and put it on your ankle.How does that feel ? 
 Be brave . Don't worry . You will be able to walk soon . 
 Nine total . Seven children and my parents . 
 Well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . My father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it . 
 It can be hard , and there are certain sacrifices you have to make . 
 That's one . Another is the lack of personal property . Everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . Especially clothes . Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs . 
 Same problem here . There's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family . The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college . 
 They do , but it doesn't help too much . Having seven children means that the money situation in my home is always pretty tight . 
 Yes , dad , it was . 
 It was long , too . 
 But it went by fast . It was interesting . 
 I'll give you a speech like that , too . 
 Of course . 
 You have lots of friends . They will be there , too ! 
 Hi , Randy . What are you doing right now ? 
 I ’ Ve got two tickets for a newly released film . Would you like to see it with me ? 
 The film will start at 2 
 In my parking lot , at 2pm . 
 How do you think TaiWan's economy is doing ? 
 Do you know why that is ? 
 Does your child still believe in Santa Claus ? 
 How sweet . 
 When are you going to tell her that Santa Claus doesn't exist ? 
 I am kind of nervous . 
 I don't know . I never went to a church before . I was not raised as a Christian , so I don't know what to do . 
 Maybe . I know I agreed to go with you , but now I don't feel right about it . 
 Really ? 
 Alright . But will we sing ? 
 I don't know the words . 
 And will I go up to the front to have the bread and wine ? 
 Eu-char-ist ? What is that ? 
 It doesn't sound like an English word . 
 Alright . Well , I feel more comfortable now.Now I understand I am welcome as a visitor . 
 Hey Jack . How were your classes this semester ? 
 Would you consider it your favorite class ? 
 What class was your favorite then ? 
 I never took that yet . If that was your favorite , I think I will check it out . 
 It ’ s an article about language . It talks about the idea of having a single global language . 
 Actually , it suggest English . The main argument is that English is already being studied as a second language in most countries-china , India , mexico , Nigeria , Pakistan , and japan . So beginning again with a language like Esperanto would be wasteful . The second argument is that English is used in modern technology far more that any other language . Most emails are sent in English and the vast majority of website use English . 
 The article points out that many languages have been lost and will be lost , but others will continue to be used for generation , even if English continues to be the dominant language . 
 Exactly . The article suggests that those languages will be used , but that they will only rarely be used in international communication between non-native speakers . 
 Are you have a hand in locking into the case ? 
 How do you feel about it ? 
 Ahh ... What a fine day ! I do feel like an outdoor exercise . 
 OK.It ' s delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh . 
 Don't you see many people over there ? Just on your left . 
 A growing keep-fit fever is sweeping over China . 
 Thanks , I'm enough . 
 I'll have it if you insist . 
 Yes , it looks interesting . 
 It must be old . 
 Let's enter it ! 
 It must be locked . 
 She can't answer you . 
 It must be a haunted house.Are you frightened ? 
 Good morning . Phyllis Seymour speaking . 
 Thank you very much , Mr . Parker . But , that is my job . 
 It's raining outside , Catherine , it's too bad.What ' s the weather like in your hometown ? 
 Do you like the weather in Seattle ? 
 Why ? 
 What about the weather in Boston ? 
 Is it very cold in winter ? 
 Wei , you look really tired . 
 9:00 ! 
 Why ’ s that ? 
 I've heard you're going to America tomorrow . I want to see you off at the airport . 
 What time are you leaving ? 
 What airline and what flight ? 
 I'll see you at the airport at 12:30 P . m . 
 He was hauled up last week for the second time . 
 Of course , he is a man with a history . 
 Hello . Can I sit here ? 
 By the way , I'm Robin . 
 Nice to meet you . 
 I'm from Kathmandu . What about you ? 
 Bye . See you . 
 You haven't ? If you've never tried it I can show you how . 
 Downloading music is really fast and convenient , and you can preview all the songs before you buy them . 
 Good , thanks . How about you ? 
 In No . 4 Dorm . I like dorm life . You will meet a lot of people and you don't have to cook . What about you ? 
 I hope you will find a place . Listen , I'd better go . I am going to be late for class . 
 Take care . 
 I think so too . It's just pointless . 
 I don't know.Maybe they are really crazy . 
 I heard you are going to move . 
 What are you worried about ? 
 You can call a mover . 
 Around 200 RIB for a truck . 
 But think about it , you just need to pack your stuff and leave everything for the movers , how much trouble you will save . 
 I know a mover which has a very good reputation for their service . I ’ ll leave you their phone number . 
 It ’ s 8357688 8 . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Yeah , I come here every now and then . 
 What kind of girl is she ? 
 Is her fiance Taiwanese ? 
 How old is he ? 
 How have you been ? 
 And how's everyone in your family ? 
 I'd love to , but I'm afraid I can't . 
 Do you think so ? I don ’ t like girls who look like that . I like girls who aren ’ t too slim . If you like her , go and talk to her . 
 He ’ s huge ! He must go to the gym to have a well-built body like that . 
 I don ’ t mind , but I like girls with long hair . 
 Have you ever dated a girl taller than you ? 
 Yes , I have . Perhaps I should go to the gym , like that girl ’ s boyfriend . 
 Good morning , Linda . How have you been ? 
 I ’ m sorry to hear that . Is there anything else I can do ? 
 Well , I hope you ’ ll feel better soon . 
 Do you have a copy of our service contract with Telecoms ? I'm not happy with their response time and I'd like to check the terms and conditions of the contract . 
 Um , which of them is the better typist ? 
 Is there any difference in their short hand ? 
 How about languages ? 
 Um . That doesn ’ t really matter . Because we have more French visitors than German . 
 Thank you for coming . We will have dinner outside . Eat up ! 
 No , nobody . 
 Well , to be frank , yes , I do . 
 Actually it is . Perhaps you haven ’ t noticed the sign . 
 There , on the window . 
 That ’ s all right . 
 You can trust him . He always tells the truth . 
 I said you can trust him . You just have to believe it . 
 I feel the same way . 
 It sure is.He has no one to turn to , very miserable indeed . 
 Uh , yes . 
 Yes . I commute five days a week by train . 
 It ’ s really very good . 
 Well , trains are frequent and come on time . 
 I usually take the five thirty home . 
 No , I usually have to stand . 
 Yes , it ’ s reasonably fast but it certainly isn ’ t cheap . Fares have gone up 25 present . 
 Well , there's this clock I was ... MY vintage clock ! How do you have my clock ? ? 
 Sixty-five ? What the ... ? How did you bargain him down , Wei ? You've never even been to a flea market before ! 
 Never underestimate a woman when it comes to bargaining ! 
 Yes . I have been here for three years . 
 Well . I ’ m rather disappointed with it . 
 It ’ s too old . And it isn ’ t as specious as I expected . 
 I ’ ll just have to put up with it . 
 I'd rather you didn't . 
 Oh , to be frank , I think it's sheer waste of time to watch it . 
 But I don't think much of it . 
 Yes . I'd like to swap some of my peanuts for your chips . 
 Do you have any ketchup ? 
 Harry is a hen-pecked husband . 
 Then why does he let himself be lead by the nose ? 
 Have you ever found yourself in a situation when you have to lie to people who trust you ? 
 Yes . Is it wrong to lie to them even if it is for their good ? 
 But sometimes it is so hard to tell the truth . 
 Hi , Julie . I was in your neighborhood and I'd like to drop by . 
 That sounds refreshing . Thanks ! 
 Surely not . Life in the university is fun . Why did you ask ? 
 Studying in the university is not easy , but it's not as arduous as you think . 
 Of course I know . I once attended Lisa's class , sitting quietly at the back of the classroom . 
 Of course not . You are allowed to attend any lecture , only if there are empty seats for you and you don't disturb the class . In universities , you study in a free and creative environment . 
 This question has really been bothering me . I like Chinese literature , you know . But economics is really hot now , and it has a very good career prospect . 
 Though I like Chinese literature very much , I'm also interested in economics . It's a tough choice to make . 
 Right . I have lots of time to think carefully before I make my final decision . 
 Kobe Bryant , of course . 
 He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers , but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand . 
 Indeed , no man can be perfect . He is just so-so in crashing the boards . Usually he plays shooting guard . Rebounding might not be his strong suit . 
 Who wouldn't ! My friend Lee went so far as to get an autograph from him . 
 Well , nothing more than a jumble of photographs . 
 I would like to find this book . 
 I don ’ t think you guys have it . 
 I did that . 
 It should be on the shelf , but I didn ’ t see it . 
 I didn ’ t know you could do that . 
 I appreciate your help . 
 It was just a misunderstanding . 
 That's a great relief . I was worried about him . 
 His parents must feel very happy . 
 This is just what I have in mind.Where are you planning to go ? 
 Good idea ! 
 Yes , I did . 
 I don't think much of the film . 
 Oh , I'm not sure I agree with you . It was not a good one , but it was not the worst one . Actually , it wasn't too bad . 
 What's more , some scenes were good , much fit for the children . 
 Thanks for offering to give me a lift . I ’ m looking forward to this party , but I didn ’ t want to go alone . 
 No , this is my first.Last week I went to a cookout for new professors at Dean Barksdale ’ s home . I took a taxi because I didn ’ t want to be late.But I was the first one 
 Thanks for telling me this . 
 Why are you in such a hurry ? They said , Dinner at eight , and it ’ s only seven-fifteen . I don ’ t want to be the first one there again . 
 How did you do in the last quiz ? 
 Don't be so worried , You know Professor Robert is not too strict . 
 I hope you'll do better in the final . 
 I am so bored all day . 
 Jack borrowed a large sum of money from me and didn ’ t pay me back . 
 Mike has changed much after marriage . 
 It ’ s unbelievable . He used to be such a rough guy . 
 Oh , sorry , I can't . I'm going to work late tonight . I have to finish this report . 
 No , I'm not . What are you planning to do ? 
 Sure , I'd love to ! But let me pay for the tickets this time . It's my turn . 
 Sorry , I overslept . My alarm clock didn't go off this morning . 
 That's right , even though I did set the alarm last night . 
 Well . If it breaks down again tomorrow , I'll definitely buy a new one . 
 What do you mean too late ? 
 Do you often go to watch sports games ? 
 Can you recall the games ? 
 How do you like your work ? 
 What do you do ? 
 Mine isn't hard , but it's not interesting . 
 I'm a clerk in a shop . 
 I can ’ t find the book I want . 
 I checked it already . 
 It wasn ’ t there . 
 Will you be getting another copy ? 
 Could you reserve a copy for me ? 
 That ’ s great . Thanks a lot . 
 Yes , I would be happy to help . What do you want to buy ? 
 OK . So this machine will make change if you need it . Do you have your dollars ready ? 
 Next , you feed your dollars into the machine in the slot . Make sure they are smooth . 
 I'm sure you know that if the dollar gets stuck , you might have to re-feed it . 
 Now you just make your selection and pray . If nothing comes out , try again or call the number on the side of the machine . 
 Well , good luck ! 
 My husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . But then we had three parties to celebrate . 
 Well , since my husband and I are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . It wasn't actually that expensive . 
 I would have liked them to be there , but they couldn ’ t afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them , so they understood . 
 My husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed that the wedding party should be less about money and more about family . 
 We waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa . 
 Not at all , but we don ’ t have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly ! 
 Why would that be funny ? 
 Why ? 
 I don ’ t agree , but anyways , I think you should start thinking of a new year ’ s resolution yourself . 
 Well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives . 
 Well , I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me everyday ! 
 How did your vacation go ? 
 What about the trip ? Do you enjoy yourself ? 
 Did your boat float down the river ? 
 Sounds dangerous . 
 What a thrilling trip ! 
 He's a sad dog . He came to the wedding in jeans ! 
 They promised us a sea view . 
 Isn't it awful ? I can't bear to look at it . I don't think I can stand this place for two weeks . 
 Hello , Mike , long time no see . How's everything going ? 
 He caught a cold yesterday , but he feels much better now . 
 I sure will . Thanks . 
 Not too well ! I ’ m just to the doctor . I haven ’ t been feeling too well over the last few days . 
 That ’ s the funny thing . I don ’ t what ’ s wrong with me . I just feel exhausted . 
 Maybe . I haven ’ t been able to keep my food down either . That ’ s unusual . 
 Yes , he is . I ’ Ve make an appointment for 10 o ’ clock , so I ’ d better move along . 
 If you go out recently you will find some people riding scooters in high streets and back lanes . 
 Looking at the ' five sense organs ' of a scooter , it can be said as delicate and agile . To pull the T-shaped pole and make it vertical with the flat board and then pull it vertically , adjust its height suitable to you and you may use it . 
 Your two hands hold the pole , stand on the board , the other foot steps back against the ground and controls well the balance of the body , then you can ride in the air . It has a feeling of surfing . You need not let other people teach you . Your fear will disappear quickly . 
 I don ’ t know . 
 Oh , I see . 
 It ’ s Saturday , a great weekend . 
 Don ’ t be angry with me . I have a bad memory . 
 What day is it on earth ? 
 Hi , dear , do you know what the important day is today ? 
 Please think it over . 
 Come on , dear . I know you mustn ’ t forget it . 
 Ur , you really let me down . 
 No , you haven ’ t . You just don ’ t care about me . You ’ re an indifferent husband . 
 It ’ s the anniversary of our weeding . 
 It ’ s nice to go home earlier once in a while . But it ’ s the evening rush . 
 Sure it is . I really hate to get caught in a traffic jam . 
 We had a fantastic time . 
 No , but we went to the Kennedy Center . 
 Fine , they are colorful and tasty . 
 Yes , I did . I have never tasted anything like this . 
 No , thanks . I'm full . 
 No , thanks . I'm on diet . 
 Ice cream , please . 
 It was a foreign film called ' Gone with the wind ' . 
 How did you like the movie ? 
 I can't say I agree . 
 I guess I expected too much from the movie , so I was a bit disappointed . 
 Tom , aren ’ t you a little too old to be trick-or - treating ? 
 Of course , I did , but when I was ten ! Trick - or-treating is for kids , plus , I ’ m sure people will think you ’ re a kidnapper or something , running around with kids NCP at night . 
 I hear Yolanda has been studying every night this week for the exam . 
 Hello . I'm Jason . 
 Nice to meet you , Dolma . 
 When and where were you born ? 
 You look so young . 
 How about the hiking ? It was freezing yesterday , are you all ok ? 
 You had been walking for 6 hours , isn ’ t that boring ? 
 Well . You know I hate walking , but I can ’ t wait to see your guys ’ video . 
 I used to be an atheist . But in recent months , I couldn't but form a more favorable opinion of horoscope . 
 Not exactly , except that I find horoscope predictions increasingly accurate . I came upon a website which sends me an up-dated message by e-mail each day forecasting my experience in detail . It is amazing to find these forecasts largely in line with my daily life . 
 For example , the message for the day before yesterday notified me that I , as a Leo guy , was to have some " unusual experience in food and drink . And as it turned out , the reality matched this prediction well . Lasi night , I was treated to a dinner party by Mr . Lee . 
 Oh , no . You can never tell whether such-and-such is science or sheer fraud.If horoscope is really something deceptive , how come quite a size of proportion of young people think highly of it . 
 Don't have some relation with him . You know , he is not a kind man . 
 If you attack him , be sure you ’ ll get a Roland for an Oliver . 
 It's nice and bright today , isn't it ? 
 How about winter ? 
 It's boring , right ? 
 Do you get much rain during the summer ? 
 So you should bring an umbrella often . 
 You don ’ t look like enjoying this workout . 
 You don ’ t like this sort of exercise ? 
 Yes , that ’ s funny . I thought you liked it . 
 Never mind . It ’ ll be over in 10 minutes . 
 Hi , Jenny . Are you going to school now ? 
 Got any plans after the class ? 
 We will have our midterm exams next month . I plan to look for some important books and study at the library . Do you want to join me ? 
 Great . We can go to the swimming pool in the gymnasium after that . 
 Well , that's a good question . I haven't swum for almost two years . I think I need more practice . 
 See you then . 
 No , don't try to tempt me . I'm becoming chubby , and I have to slender down . 
 I don't think so . I know I've put on weight this winter . 
 Yes , to tell you the truth . I am on the diet . 
 No . Why ? 
 No way ! 
 ... I knew it . I always knew you were a lesbian ! 
 Haha . Still got that great sense of humor , I see . Here's my card . I sell used cars . A car from us is a car you can trust ! 
 Sweet little lassie . Yep , broke her heart when the D-man told her he couldn't be a one-woman guy . 
 Which team do you think will emerge with the last laugh in this World Cup ? 
 No , they aren't . They had a hard time in the group stage and only sealed a sit in the eighth-finals with Wallack ' s header in the final three minutes . Just think , group A consists of Austria , China , and Saudi Arabia , all of which are minnows . 
 Well , at least the Germans have demonstrated a very good ability to control the midfield . They recorded a total of 62 tackles in the match against Austria . And they to be endowed with perfect positional sense . I think that will give rise to scoring chances sooner or later . 
 That's why I still have very high hopes for the team . Now that the tournament has proceeded into the knock-out stage , the Germans will probably make it through to the finals . 
 The woman was beaten again . Why didn ’ t she call the police . 
 It is incredible . 
 Are you feeling better today , Bill ? 
 You'd better give up smoking . It's bad for your health . 
 But you should make up your mind first . 
 Why don't you go to bed and get up early ? You'll have the same time for work . 
 I don't know why people are just mad about David Peckham . Is there really anything so fascinating with him ? 
 you mean he plays well ? Yeah , he often scores by free kicks in crucial games . But a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks . 
 In the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . After all , the majority of his fans are girls . 
 and he is English ! He makes a model gentleman when he puts on a black suit and speaks with a typical British accent . 
 This book is so good . I just can't put it down ! It's called ' The Power of One ' . 
 Me either . From the very first page , this author just pulled me right in ! 
 Yes . I'm in the last chapter now and it is just gripping . 
 Okay . But be prepared for an all-nighter ! I doubt you will want to put it down either . 
 No . I was way too busy studying all the time . How about you ? 
 What was that like ? 
 What did you do ? 
 Did you get any perks on the job ? 
 May I introduce myself ? I am steven smith . 
 Don ’ t be worried . Please sit down and take it easy . 
 But you should avoid finger-pointing when you haven ’ t got the real facts . 
 That looks like an interesting book . 
 There are the pyramids . It ’ s easy to see how they got that name ! they don ’ t have smooth sides though . 
 Look at that cylindrical office building . I ’ Ve never been seen one that shape before . 
 TV towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top . They ’ re not perfectly cylindrical . 
 What sports do they play there ? 
 Is that building a perfect cube ? 
 Is says here that it ’ s a war memorial . Now , there ’ s a distinctive structure-the stomium in Brussels . See ? It consists of several connected by cylinders . I believe you can go up and down inside it . 
 Just taking a smoke break . 
 Sure . Here you go . 
 I didn't know you smoked . 
 Oh . You're new to smoking still . I've been smoking for 7 years . 
 Many times . I'm really addicted . It's harder to stop than you think . 
 I highly recommend you quit soon . The longer you smoke , the harder it becomes to quit . 
 No problem . I'll talk to you later . 
 Never ! He ’ s over 80 , isn ’ t he ? 
 Good gracious ! Are you sure ? 
 Is she really ? 
 Really ? Quite a woman , isn ’ t she ? 
 I just stayed at home and watched TV . 
 Yes , it was a very evenly matched game . 
 It ended in a tie . 
 It was three all . 
 If Barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won . 
 Their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal , but he kept on playing anyway . 
 How many more games are left this season ? 
 When do the playoffs start ? 
 Of course ! I really love watching football games on TV . 
 Sure , that would be great . 
 The acting of this film is marvelous.In spite of the thin plot , the acting , the music and the scene have won the Academy Award of this year . 
 Don't be too critical.We can't expect it to be perfect . 
 Oh yeah , that sounds pretty cool , I guess ... 
 Oh really ... well you must be very popular on the Internet . But it's true that it's nice to do some things in the comfort of your own home . 
 I'm glad that you can make it . 
 Yeah . I've invited a lot of friends besides you . 
 We all keep our shoes on indoors . 
 They've gone out so that we could have the house to ourselves . 
 Will you go with us this Sunday ? 
 Let's go and play volleyball . 
 I think it's about time that we had to go . 
 I'd love to , but I have to get up early tomorrow and get to the office on time . 
 Thank you for a very enjoyable evening and your hospitality . 
 Wow , Is winter always this cold in Taiwan ? 
 No , I am from south California . This is my first real winter . 
 What's the temperature today anyway ? 
 When is your birthday ? 
 Do you usually have a birthday party ? 
 What would you do at the party ? 
 Do you know when people began to sing the song " Happy Birthday " ? 
 Let me tell you the story.In 1892 , Patty Smith Hill and Mildred Hill wrote a song called " Good Morning to you " . But later someone added the words " Happy Birthday " to their tune . 
 Yes , actually , the song has been sung since its publication in 1932.People all over the world have sung it in many different languages . 
 He's very strict with us . 
 Indeed . He's strict with himself , too . We can see every lecture of his is well-prepared . 
 Oh , what ’ s he like ? 
 Yes . 
 Um , that ’ s good . 
 I'm very grateful for what you have done to my son , doctor . 
 I know he has brought great trouble to you . A million thanks . 
 I will . It's most thoughtful of you . 
 Oh , that sounds great ! 
 Yes , that would be perfect . 
 Yes . Thank you for inviting me . 
 Certainly . Let me see . Oh , it's on that self . 
 Of course . Here you are . 
 Thank you so much . I can't take this . 
 What did she mean just now about raising pigs ? 
 Ha-ha . I get it . That's funny . Your cousin's a real sarcastic lady . 
 I ’ m hungry , let ’ s grab a bite to eat . 
 Nah ! Let ’ s go get a burger and fries . 
 What are you talking about ? I have salads some times . 
 Fine ! I ’ ll start drinking and having home cooked meals that are low in fat . Are you happy now ? 
 I hear you and James are engaged at last . 
 When are you getting married ? 
 Oh , lovely . Where's the wedding going to be ? 
 Oh , yes , your parents live there , don't they ? 
 Where are you going to live after you're married ? 
 Are you going to give up your job ? 
 Daddy , I want to buy a ten-speed-sportsman . 
 No , I'm not asking for money . I'm asking for your advice . 
 I feel pity for the old man . 
 It must be dreadful to grow old . 
 What a nice photo you ’ Ve taken ! 
 You have a real talent , Ellen ! 
 I don ’ t dare to look after the children now . 
 The children always make themselves in danger . I always have my heart in my mouth with them . 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Well , I think you should go for our manger . I will call him here . 
 Why did Tom quit the job ? 
 If he doesn't change his attitude toward his work , I don't think a new job can make any difference . 
 Sure . Is it your father's birthday ? 
 Oh ! How could I forget such an important holiday ? 
 Yes , let's go . 
 You must be joking . The job is nice and she is well paid . 
 How long have you been in China ? 
 How do you think of living here ? 
 Let's go see pandas ! The news said that two pandas arrived at the zoo last week . 
 How can we get there ? 
 OK ! Let's go . 
 Yes , you can find hundreds of various animals here . It is the biggest zoo in Taiwan . 
 Where can find the pandas ? I think we are here to see the pandas . 
 It should take at least 20 minutes to get there . Are there any shuttle buses running place to place around the whole zoo ? 
 Listen , Nancy . If I don't work hard , I will be laid off . 
 Come on , Nancy . Play it cool . I go with you and burn the middle night oil tonight . 
 Why do you say that ? 
 Many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . Government service can be a rewarding and secure career . 
 Well , many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries . 
 Sometimes that's true , but not usually . Most feds are honest , hard-working professionals . It ’ s hard to keep highly trained people , so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive . 
 I'm a GS - 15 . That's high on the scale of workers , but even a GS - 1 is paid a living wage . 
 You asked for it . 
 Hi , Kathy . Have you had lunch ? 
 I ’ m starving , too . There is a new Chinese restaurant close by . Do you want to go there for lunch ? 
 It ’ s my treat this time . 
 Would you like to see our new shirts ? 
 But they ’ re very nice , you know . 
 And not expensive either . 
 Everybody is buying them . 
 Yes , they ’ re very fashionable , you see . 
 I see . 
 Sorry , I couldn ’ t help you . 
 Nothing much . What's new with you ? 
 Me too . Seems like all I do is eat and sleep . 
 Okay . Check you later . 
 Gatorade . It ’ s rich in Vitamin and it gives us energy and vitality . 
 What should we do , now with Jack out of the game ? 
 That ’ s right . Spraining the ankle and breaking the leg are the common things during the match . 
 That ’ s for sure . During the back court , we should change the position we played . 
 I agree with you . I think we ’ ll play much better than before . 
 Yeah , look how passionate they are ! Are they professional ? 
 Oops ! I almost forget about it . Do you see the girl in the middle of the first line ? 
 Don ’ t you think she looks like your daughter ? 
 Welcome to my birthday party , I am so happy you can come . 
 Thank you , shall I open it now ? 
 Wow , a remote car model and my favorite brand . I really like it . That is so nice of you . 
 Typical you , always wanting to keep the best things for yourself . The more I appreciate the gift now . 
 Hi , Alex ! 
 I just got back from London . 
 It was OK . There was a lot of turbulence , though . 
 It was 10 hours . 
 Yes , in Paris , France . 
 Yes . I bought two boxed of chocolate – one for me and one for you ! 
 It was nothing . 
 Have you ever considered that perhaps we have a morale problem among our employees ? If everyone is discontent with their work , of course they won't stick arround . 
 Inbreeding is a big drawback from snitching most of their employers from one or two companies . 
 Our human resource department is working on it , it's not easy to recruit new employees every few month , it's hard to find qualified people . 
 Do you have a bf ? 
 Why you say bf before ? 
 Have you got a new one ? 
 I am single , I have no real of , only an E-gf , that is you . 
 I like you . Do you agree to be my of ? 
 Wow ! Blablablabla . . . 
 I am flying like a bird . 
 I am so happy . I want to drink a cup of champagne . 
 It's OK , so I send you this . 
 It's my heart ; it's made of what you like . 
 Are you sleepy ? 
 Yes , I do not want to see ur sleeping in the office . 
 C U here , honey . 
 Oh , hi , Lee . You look great . 
 What's the weather forecast for today ? 
 Any rain ? 
 I wouldn't either . It's been looking like rain for several days . 
 I like orange better . 
 Because orange is much more to my taste . 
 So ? 
 no . what's it like ? 
 would you want to live there ? 
 what's your dreamhole like then ? 
 would you want to buy an old cottage or build a new one yourself ? 
 it that why you wear second-hand cloths as well ? Because they've got character ? 
 I see . If you lived in an old house , would it be decorated in a modern way ? 
 When I quarrel with my husband . He didn't even try to cool me out . 
 I was so angry that I could not keep cool . What I need is just an apology . 
 Yes , I finished last Friday . 
 Well , yes . I don't mind admitting that I am . I enjoyed school , but I did object to having to go in every day once we've done all our exams . 
 Yes , I intend to go to university.That ' ll be in September.But it all depends on my A level results . 
 Oh , yes . 
 I'm glad you liked it . Are you ready for dessert ? 
 I made strawberry shortcake . 
 Great . Would you like coffee or tea with that ? 
 Do you take cream or sugar with your tea ? 
 Definitely . Would you like skim or whole milk ? 
 What happened ? 
 I'll go with you . Where is she ? 
 Is she alright ? 
 Don't worry . Family comes first . Come on , let's go . 
 Ok . Just call me if you need anything then . 
 You look upset , is there anything wrong ? 
 What is it ? 
 Oh , that's too bad ! I am sorry to hear that ! 
 Diana , do you like the perfume I gave you ? 
 I ’ m sorry . I didn ’ t know that . 
 Are there any interesting stories in the newspaper today ? 
 Was it caused accidentally or naturally ? Sometimes it gets so hot that fires begin naturally in Australia and Africa . 
 What is the international community doing to help ? 
 How many countries have been affected ? 
 I saw on the tv yesterday that there has been another earthquake in Iran . 
 Does the newspaper say anything about casualties ? 
 Where are you going for your trip ? 
 But I heard the north of China are experiencing severe sandstorms ! 
 Yes , it's said that Hebes was experiencing six degree strong winds . 
 The report said the number of people with respiratory tract infections tended to rise after sandstorms . The sand gets into people's noses and throats and creates irritation . 
 You are quite right . 
 everything's great . And you ? 
 no , I haven't had a chance to . But I've been watching a Chinese TV series called Chinese-Style Divorce . 
 yeah . I found it is so close to our life . 
 you said it . You know , the divorce rate has been on the rise in recent years . 
 I know a couple who divorced a week after getting married . 
 that's true . It's said the short-lived marriage is typical of the post - 80s generation . 
 definitely . They don't take relationships and marriages very seriously . 
 I think , as the saying goes as the saying goes haste makes waste , it is the same thing with marriage . 
 Yeah . He's known as a sly dog . He's done many people in . 
 And he may cash in on people whenever chances are provided . 
 I don't think so . I think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking . 
 No.You can't suddenly make smoking illegal . But the government could prohibit smoking in public places like cinemas and theaters . 
 I listen to a lot of hip hop . What about you ? 
 Yes , me too . I mostly listen to hip hop , but there are many genres of music I like . 
 Yes.Let ' s hold a birthday party for him , shall we ? 
 I know I'm a blabbermouth , but what do you think she should do , John ? 
 I know ! But it's really important to her ! Her whole life could be ruined by this man ! 
 Are you serious , John ? 
 Don ’ t you think it would be an idea to name the ship Dolphin ? 
 So you ’ Ve got something on your mind , I guess . 
 Have you decided what you are going to take next semester ? 
 Good . I think it's a good idea . Our department should require meetings like this . 
 Yes , that happens . 
 Alright . Good . I see you've already taken six credits of your breadth requirements.You have one botany class and one chemistry class . And political science.So that's nine credits . Did you take English Composition 201 ? 
 Excellent . I see you have the 18th century poetry class for next semester.And the modern novel class . You haven't taken a Shakespeare class yet . 
 Actually , I recommend you take Shakespeare sooner rather than later . 
 Let me look at the timetable.Shakespeare meets Monday , Wednesday and Friday at 11 
 Good . I recommend it . Shakespeare is of course enormously important.We want our students to take the class as soon as they can.And Professor Friedman is an excellent teacher . 
 Tell me , Lisa , what made you decide to be an English major ? 
 Really ? That's great to know . 
 hey , Lucas , how was your trip to Paris ? 
 did you go to the top of the Eiffel Tower ? 
 what else did you see ? 
 you must have had a great time . 
 yes , you need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroad . Sometimes new food might disagree with you . 
 that is great . Everyone says French food is wonderful . 
 Excuse me . 
 I ordered my dish about a half an hour ago , but it hasn't arrived yet . 
 Thank you . 
 It doesn't matter . 
 It's very nice , I like it very much . 
 My pleasure . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer , and I suppose you dance often . 
 Oh , really ? But you're doing the waltz wonderfully well . 
 Thank you for your compliments.It ' s just that you are a good leader . Do you like the fox-trot and tango ? 
 Disco is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances because it can release one's pent-up feelings , and is a healthy exercise . But I don't do the rock and roll and the break dance . 
 My pleasure . Let's go and have a drink . 
 What's the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ? 
 How hard is the climb ? 
 What did you do last week ? 
 Wow . That sounds like a lot of fun . I am sorry I missed it . 
 Yeah , I will . See you then ! 
 How many people are there in your family ? 
 What did you say ? How many ? 
 Wow . That is a very big family . Do you all live together ? 
 But you don't live at home anymore . 
 My goodness ! Your family must live in a huge house . 
 Wow ! you grew up in a school ! No wonder your English is excellent ! 
 You are so lucky ! 
 That's what i did in America . I was reading all the time . I was never a big TV watcher . TV wastes time . 
 800 books ? I'm impressed ! 
 ... Now that we have been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter , Ed ! Give us some good news . How are things looking for us in terms sales this month ? 
 What ? Ed , don ’ t tell me you only have bad news ! 
 For crying out loud ... How fast are we losing money ? 
 What ! Geez ! How could this have happened ? So what ’ s the bad news ? 
 Are you joking ? Get the supplier on the line now ! They have to assume the costs of this mess ! 
 We ’ re doomed ! 
 Really ? What ! 
 So Vicky , how long have you held your present position ? 
 And how do you like working for IBM ? 
 What ’ s strength do you bring to the job ? 
 That ’ s good . We always need team players here . 
 I think it is easy . I could work in your class with no problem . 
 Oh , without a doubt . When is the next class ? 
 No problem . 
 Of course , easy . No sweat . 
 Are you kidding me ? It's going to be up a piece of cake . 
 Yeah , what't the bet ? 
 Johnny , you did badly on the test . I think you haven't been studying enough . Am I right ? 
 Well , you'd better start studying harder if you want to pass this class . 
 Canada is north of here . 
 Sure . Look here . Canada is north of the United States . 
 Mexico is south of the United States . 
 Connecticut is east of New York . 
 Ohio . 
 Los Angeles is in California . It's southeast of San Francisco . 
 Boston is in the northeast part of the country . 
 Las Vegas is in the southwest . 
 I like reading novels about early America . 
 Which one do you like best ? 
 Yup . Though the words he used are simple , but the spirit he has conveyed is great . 
 Doesn't she have any friends ? 
 Such friends are even worse than enemies . 
 Is that true ? 
 Wow . She looks good for having had that many kids . She's pregnant and wearing Prada ! 
 She's glowing . It must be the pregnancy . 
 Hi , Jenny . Are still working ? 
 So , you are leaving , aren't you ? 
 How nice ! I can see you are busying packing . I'm sorry to interrupt you . 
 Yes , could you please go over this for me ? And see if there is any mistake in it ? 
 Excuse me for taking your time . 
 Why do you look so gloomy ? What are you looking for ? 
 Did you finish typing it yesterday ? 
 Don't worry about it . It must be somewhere in your room . Let's see where you put it . Have you searched your drawers and the desk ? 
 How about the shelf ? 
 Don't get upset over it . At least you have another week to go . 
 Cheer up ! What I meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . There is no need to write a new one . Oh , what's this ? Is this your dissertation ? 
 You ’ Ve put it among these journals . 
 Crazy ! He locked himself in the room . 
 But you can see the key in his hand through the window ! 
 Where's Bill ? The ambassador is already here . The meeting is set to start at 9 am . 
 Even though the traffic is bumper-to-bumper out there , I don't think it's heavy traffic that makes Bill late . He takes the train , remember ? 
 Well , to be fare , since he's coming all the way from Lancaster , he's got to get up much earlier than the rest of us . He must get start on his commute about six thirty , no telling what time he actually gets up . 
 Why doesn't he just drive to work ? 
 What can I do ? 
 Well , the books are in the box . What can I do now ? 
 All right . 
 These magazines are interesting . May I borrow one ? 
 Thanks , John . 
 It's the most fun I've had in years . 
 Yes , we should . 
 He's a sad dog . He came to the wedding in jeans ! 
 Have we sold out all the newspapers for today ? 
 Why are so many extra gifts left here ? 
 How about giving them to that old man ? 
 By the way , do you think it's a good idea to give free gifts to attract customers ? 
 I think it should be more useful to hand out some fliers which is also cheaper . 
 That's true . 
 Okay . How tiring the job is ! 
 Don't worry . I'll drive you back . 
 What's your number ? 
 Five . 
 You think it's funny . I'm terrified . 
 But I've never jumped off anything in my life . The highest thing I've jumped off is my bed . I'm scared . 
 I guess I'm adventuresome , but then I'm scared too . 
 I think modern painting means nothing . 
 Then why are so many guys so crazy about it ? 
 Maybe . 
 Playground . We're having sports for today's outside class activities . All my classmates have already got there . 
 Some of us will play basketball and some volleyball . 
 Yesterday I had a deal with a vice manager . He acts like the point man . 
 Wow , the view from the peak is so grand ! 
 Did you ever see this kind of beautiful scene ? 
 But my father did not . He didn't have much time . 
 Really ? It's a deal . Have you ever been there ? 
 It really gets me interested . Is it higher than Kiang Shan ? 
 Can I see the rainbow ? 
 Tom has grown six inches within a year . 
 Yeah , do you see his Adam's apple ? It becomes bigger . 
 For our lunch meeting with the investors , do we have to make a reservation at the restaurant or do we just show up ? 
 I've arranged to meet them at the restaurant at twelve . Can you make the reservation a little earlier ? If we start earlier , it will give us more time for a longer lunch . 
 Yes , we'll start with appetizers , follow with a soup and salad course , then main dishes of prime rib or cordon bleu chicken , and finish up with a delicious rich dessert of some sort . 
 As along as we stay away from anything alcoholic , we should be okay . 
 We can make some special arrangement if we need to . After all , it's the company who is footing the bill . 
 But it was her that makes us so embarrassed . 
 I don't care . 
 Certainly , where will you be coming from ? 
 Ok . Take the Underground ( the Circle line ) to High Street Kensington . Make sure you take the High Street Kensington exit . 
 Ok - when you leave the Underground , cross the road and you should see Horntown Street . Was up that street to the crossroads . As you was you should see a fast food place on your right . 
 No , you need to turn left into Philimore Was and take the next right . 
 That's fine . You will not miss it because it's just next to the Kensington centra Library . 
 Ok , we live in the third building on your left . Will we see you around 7 pm ? 
 Guess what came in the mail today ? 
 My acceptance letter to Yale ! 
 Freshman orientation is the last week of august , but I want to go two weeks before that to get settled in . 
 Yes . I ’ ll be very busy ! I have to get a visa , buy a plane ticket , and pack my things . But first , I want to register for classes . 
 Well , they sent me their prospectus , so I can start looking now . do you want to help me decide which classed to take ? 
 Well , I have to take all the fundamental course , plus a few from my major . 
 I hope to major in English literature , but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year , so we ’ ll see . 
 In order to graduate , every student must take a certain amount of classes in history , math , English , philosophy , science and art . 
 Yes , it is . It ’ s also very different from the British education system . 
 oh , sure . In British , students don ’ t have to take the foundation course . 
 maybe because they think they know everything already ! ha ha . 
 Yeah , I just got them . I started playing ice hockey in a community league . So , I finally got myself new skates . 
 I ’ m a defender . It ’ s a lot of fun . You don ’ t have to be able to skate as fast on defense . 
 Oh , yeah ? Which team ? 
 Really ? I think we play you guys next week . Well , I have to go to practice . See you later . 
 Do you offer a course in business management ? 
 How many nights a week is it ? 
 And how long does the course last ? 
 When does it start ? 
 What time is the class ? 
 How much does it cost ? 
 Yes , that's all right . I want to enroll in the course . 
 Do you want me to fill it out now ? 
 Would you like to drink some coffee ? 
 Would you like to try some watermelon juice ? It tastes good . 
 Excuse me . Is there any body here ? 
 I've finished up all my water . I would kill for a sip of water . 
 Thank you very much . Are you here alone ? 
 I'm a back-packer from America . 
 It means a hiker who loves traveling around the world . 
 Yes , actually almost half of all the countries over the world . I love traveling places . 
 You can do it . But do work hard on your English to make it easier . 
 OK , Dead Man . If this doesn't start your engine , nothing will . 
 No , I don't . 
 Uh , are you sure about that ? I thought espresso was an Italian word . 
 Oh , hi ! 
 Pleased to meet you . My name is Alice . Did you just move in next door ? 
 Me ? I guess so . I've lived here for about six years now . Have you lived in America very long ? 
 I teach mathematics at a college . What do you do ? 
 Well , Tom . It's good to meet you . I have to go now . I am teaching a class this evening , and I need to get to the college . 
 See you around ! 
 Good morning , Mei ! How are you ? 
 Not bad thanks . 
 Bye ! 
 Yeah , I think it's the best way to relax . 
 Really it depends on my mood . When I am sad or depressed , I like comedies . If I'm feeling good , I'll watch almost anything . 
 Yeah , unfortunately , nowadays directors are often more interested in making money than making a good film . 
 Yeah , many of my all-time-favorites were made in the forties . They've already stood the test of time and will stay with us for a long time . 
 What a washing machine ! It ’ s getting worse today . Look ! Now it doesn ’ t work at all . I think I need a new one . 
 Of course ! Let ’ s have a look . Great ! In my frame of mind , I ’ d like to buy one today . 
 You think ? 
 But I still get stuck on the different tones.It drives me crazy . 
 I can ’ t wait to retire . 
 And then I ’ m moving to Florida where I can play golf all day , every day ! 
 What do you plan on doing after you retire ? 
 I admire your energy , Ruth . You are young at heart . 
 Oh , blonde , she's very blonde ... quite short hair ... 
 No , not at all . Very straight . Her hair comes down like this ... just over the ears . 
 No ... no . I think you're thinking of someone else . 
 Er ... what else can I tell you ? Er ... she's got ... er a ... round face , a very round face , and a very big mouth , sort of wide mouth , when she laughs , her face is all mouth . 
 Charles , do you have any children ? 
 How many children do you have ? 
 What are their names ? 
 How old are they ? 
 Are they in school ? 
 What does Stephanie study ? 
 Is she here now ? 
 I can't believe the weather is so gorgeous for your wedding . 
 And all of the flowers are in bloom . 
 I was looking at my test score and think that it should be higher . 
 I think an answer got marked wrong that should have been marked right . 
 That would be great ! 
 This one right here should be right . 
 Yeah , let's do the math . 
 Looks pretty good . 
 Susan , I haven't seen you in the pub for a long time . 
 That explains it . 
 You'll never guess what happened today ! I went to the doctor after work and the doctor told me ... 
 No ... He told me I'm pregnant ! 
 And so I bought all these books on having kids and ... 
 How did you know ! They say listening to classical music can make your baby smarter ! 
 What's that ? 
 That's easy . Everyone knows that there are nine . 
 Nice try . I wasn't born yesterday , you know . 
 That sounds crazy . But they can't just change their mind about things like that . 
 I suppose you're right . They also used to think that they were so important that the sun revolved around them , not the other way around . 
 Do you think that we'll one day be able to travel to another planet for a vacation ? 
 Do you think we'll ever get to meet an alien from outer space ? 
 You're so old-fashioned . That's what people used to think about people from another country ! 
 You're just left school , haven't you , Emily ? 
 You sound relieved . 
 Well , what are you going to do now ? Have you made any plans ? 
 You mean getting into university actually depends on your passing your A level subjects ? 
 I noticed your absence in class this morning . 
 Hello , Jack here . 
 I am working . I often work late on Thursdays . I am busy this week . 
 Tomorrow ? No , I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to . I'm going out of the town on business . 
 Sorry , I never go out on Saturday evening . I always watch football on Saturday evening . 
 Next Tuesday ? Just a moment ! It will be the 21st of May . Oh , dear . Arm ... I promised my aunt I would be at her birthday party . 
 Let me see . Yes , Mary . Let's make it next Wednesday . 
 Bye . 
 Oh , how could it be ? 
 OK . Wait a minute . 
 Yes . It's really snowing . 
 But don't you think it's a little too cold ? 
 You are so interesting . 
 I have a lesson once a week but I try to practice every day . 
 I usually look at English language websites every day and go to my local English Corner twice a week . 
 Sadly , I hardly ever speak to English people . I usually practice with my Chinese friends . 
 Oh Jackie ? We broke up last week . 
 It was actually a long two months . She was a psycho . 
 She would be laughing one moment , and if I said something insensitive , she would start crying . I didn't want to deal with that . 
 She was a psycho , man . One time we were suppose to get together . I was waiting for her call , and when she finally called , she was screaming why I wasn't at her place . 
 I thought she was going to call when she was done shopping . It was a misunderstanding . She was literally screaming on the phone over this . 
 I'm just glad it's over . 
 Where have you been , Alice , you're over an hour late . 
 why ere you getting off work so late ? The office close at six , doesn ’ t it ? 
 Didn ’ t you tell him you have an appointment ? 
 Well . You ’ re here . 
 I didn't really like it . 
 I found it very disappointing . 
 I wasn't happy with it . 
 I'm busy year in and year out , but now I've done nothing . 
 I may have done a lot , but none is to my satisfaction . 
 Perhaps . I'm dead tired . 
 I'd like to . But I'm not myself today . 
 It's the end of the world for me . 
 Today , I'm told I failed three courses . 
 B :: I'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste time to me . 
 I hope so . 
 He has a glib tongue . Few people can argue him down . 
 We cannot expect a man like him to speak the truth . 
 everything's great . I've just returned from my office . 
 sure I am . I work for myself , but I've rented a virtual office at an office building in the downtown area . 
 yeah , an office that runs efficiently by using nothing other than online communication technologies . I pay the rent and share office services with others in the same building . 
 a separated office , internet access , phone services , fax services , mail & courier services , and almost everything you have in a conventional office . 
 I get a business address at an expensive location , and I can share the receptionist and secretary with other offices in the same floor . 
 you bet it ! 
 Thanks . 
 My sister did it . When did you get yours cut ? 
 Well , it looks very nice . 
 That was a great party . Thanks for staying behind to help me clear up . 
 I expected that something might get broken . That doesn ’ t bother me . That spilled drink won ’ t leave a stain , will it ? 
 I ’ m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag . 
 Yes , he ’ s very good .. isn ’ t he ? He told some funny stories too . 
 I think that she had a litter too much of the punch . 
 That ’ s my little secret . Did you like the snacks that I prepared ? 
 That cake tasted so good ! It disappeared within minutes , so I think everyone liked it a lot . How ’ s that stain ? 
 Mom , this is your third bowl of rice ! 
 Why ? I never saw you eat so much before . 
 So your stomach is the one that actually gets a lot of work-out . 
 This way you'll probably put on more weight . Will you give up ? 
 Then how are you gonna deal with the problem of getting extra weight ? 
 Oh , I've got an idea . Why don't you ask Dad to go with you ? He badly needs some exercise . 
 He can just say , I'm Benjamin . I'm new and shy . 
 Who knows ! 
 Let me see it , can I ? This is a good photograph . Who are these people ? 
 What a beautiful ship ! Who ’ s this ? 
 Ah yes . The one who offered you a job in Australia . 
 Who ’ s this ? 
 It ’ s not you , is it ? 
 Why did you shave it off ? 
 Hey , Jack ! Is Jenny coming with us ? 
 Nothing . I am just asking . 
 Who has a crush ? 
 Well , I don't have the guts to ask her out . 
 I ’ d totally die if she turned me down . 
 I don't know .. Well , maybe you are right , but how am I gonna tell her ? 
 How terrible ! This is quite unexpected ! 
 What happened ? 
 Shall I punch out for you , Ross ? I am leaving now . 
 But today is Friday . You are not going to work overtime on Friday evening , are you ? 
 No . We ’ ll meet at my house . He invited my family to spend the weekend with his family at their villa . 
 It's not his villa , but his father's . I think it's somewhere in Florida . I am not sure myself . 
 Come on . You just haven ’ t met the right person and I think that you work too much . You should learn how to entertain yourself and enjoy life . 
 Well , suit yourself . I've got to run now . 
 You too . Oh , I forgot to tell you one thing . A girl called this afternoon . She said she was your ex-girlfriend . She wanted you to call her back . 
 No , nothing else . See you Monday . 
 Are we going to have gym class tomorrow ? 
 Sometimes I forget that we don't have school on Saturdays . 
 So there are only five working days in a week ? 
 I'm going to study . 
 Well , I need to polish up my English . 
 Don't mention it . 
 That depends . What does she look like ? 
 How tall is she ? 
 Is she chubby ? 
 It sounds like she's pretty good-looking . Does she wear glasses ? 
 How's her skin ? 
 Does she have any piercings or tattoos ? 
 What's the tattoo on her foot like ? 
 Even her mother ? 
 What's her personality like ? 
 So there is something wrong with her ! It was beginning to sound like she was too good to be true ! 
 Pretty well , thanks . Still feeling the effects of jet lag a bit , but last night I got at lease six hours of rest . 
 Yep . Let's do it . I'm pretty excited ! 
 Live chicken ? Thanks , but no thanks . So ... tell me about bargaining . How can I do it like a local ? 
 Cool ! Teach me ! 
 Someone told me to go to a convenience store and see how much a soft drink or a tube of toothpaste costs . The idea is that by comparing the prices of those items , you can figure out the relative prices of everything else . 
 I ’ m so relieved that your ankle wasn ’ t broken ! I feel just awful about this whole thing . I wanna make it up to you . Let me take you out to dinner tonight . My treat . 
 Perfect ! 
 Me too.You look so beautiful tonight ! I wish this night would never end.There ’ s something I have to tell you ... 
 I woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day , but I was wrong . A twist of fate brought us together . I crashed into your life and you into mine , and this may sound crazy , but I ’ m falling in love with you , Veronica . 
 Well ... I told them not to come . I made a reservation just for the two of us . I thought we could have an quiet evening all to ourselves . 
 Jennifer , there ’ s something I wanna ask you . 
 Hmm ... okay , here ’ s the thing . I ’ Ve always seen you as more than just a friend , and I can ’ t take it any more . I know you better than anyone , I know the pros and cons of your personality , I even know what side of the bed is yours ! I think we would be great together , don ’ t you ? 
 I know ! I never had the guts to tell you ... until today . So , what do you say ? Are you willing to give me a shot ? 
 How do you usually spend your time , now that you ’ Ve retired ? 
 What do you have for breakfast ? 
 that sounds nice . How do you spend your mornings ? 
 How do you spend your afternoons ? 
 What do you think of being a secretary ? 
 How come ? 
 Hey . Steven . You have a large chunk of money , but why do you still live in the old flat , instead of buying a new villa ? 
 But I found you always hate to part with your money . Look at the car you drive ; it's such a junker ! 
 But ... But ... 
 Maybe you are right . 
 Oh , yeah . The total amount is no less than 13,000 RIB , according to our itinerary . 
 Sit down . I'll show you the list of our financial budget . First of all , it is nearly 4,000 RIB that we should spend in transportation . 
 Then we must pay a large amount of money for the hotel . But if we want to save money , we can choose a hotel which is not so good . 
 In that case , we can choose the Youth Hotel . It's a good choice , clean and economic . 
 Network is omnipresent nowadays . It's quite convenient for people . You see , we can download music and information from the Internet ; I can study from it , too . And the most of all , we can compose , send , and receive e-mails . 
 What do you mean ? 
 I agree . But I think although it has some negative effects , on the whole Internet does more good to us than harm . 
 I'm tired . 
 Yeah , I need to take a break . 
 I'll accompany my wife to the hospital . 
 She is expecting . 
 Thank you . 
 My name is Zhang Ming.Nice to meet you , Susan . 
 I come from China.Are you American ? 
 Business management 
 Hi , Alex . How are you doing ? 
 I know the feeling . I ’ m calling to let you know about this new Italian place I found . It ’ s right around the corner . 
 Have you figured out where you want to transfer to ? 
 Where would you like to go to school ? 
 You can ’ t think of anything ? 
 So , why don ’ t you just stay here ? 
 It ’ s a perfectly good school . 
 Do you know what you ’ re going to do now ? 
 Those guys thought they would never lose . But we finally beat them . And look at them crying now . 
 I can ’ t believe the cost of apartments in New York City . 
 Of course I had heard about that , but now I know how expensive it is to rent a place here . 
 Why ? You pay so much for such a tiny space to live . 
 You see that chick over there ? 
 Yeah . Isn't she hot ? 
 Just alright ? ! ? She's hot ! 
 You think she's out of my league ? 
 C'mon . I get nervous when I talk to girls . 
 What do I talk about ? 
 I don't know ... 
 No . Stay away from her . 
 Ok already . I'll try . 
 It doesn ’ t matter to me . 
 Either way . I don ’ t care . 
 I couldn ’ t careless . 
 Whatever you say . 
 I don ’ t mind if you want to . 
 Not really , but I know it is very popular a traditional Chinese gambling game . 
 Typical Francis , whether you are at work , or engaged in leisure time activities , you always show the same eagerness and curiosity to learn something new and improve yourself . 
 Thank you for showing me your offices , Mr . Becker . I can see why Washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs . 
 The city is beautiful , the off ... , the offices are modern and comfortable , and the work is so interesting . 
 Do you mean financially rewarding ? 
 I ’ Ve always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy . 
 How much do you make ? 
 Do you have any idea for this vacation ? 
 Oh , yeah , let's try to find some jobs . 
 Is this Mr.Smith ' s residence ? 
 My name is Paul.Is Mr.Smith in ? 
 Mary , how was your date with John ? 
 Oh , really ? That is great news . What does he look like ? 
 Sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ? 
 Oh , it ’ s love at first sight . 
 Er ... Hum ... Got it . 
 Right ! 
 I see what you mean . That was pretty easy after all . 
 I'm looking for it , but you see , the market shard for jobs , too . 
 I immigrated here last year . 
 I am an engineer in a mechanized farm . 
 Oh , not yet . At least have one for the road . 
 Well , I am sorry you have to leave so early . 
 Well . Thank you for coming . 
 Bye . 
 Thank you . 
 She has been admitted to Yale with a scholarship . 
 Thank you . 
 Nothing much . I'm just relaxing today . Why ? What's going on ? 
 Are they having a sale ? 
 That sounds great . Where should we meet ? 
 Sounds good . See you there . 
 They're cute . But do you think you'll wear them much ? 
 This sweater is so pretty . I love the low neck design . 
 It's on sale for $ 80 . What do you think ? Should I try it on ? 
 It ’ s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . The air is so fresh and clean . 
 I can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . The problem is that , for me , each advantage has its own disadvantage . 
 Well , I hate the noise in the city , but I love being around lost of people . The problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . The tow just don ’ t go together . 
 People can ’ t have it both ways . If you live in the country , it is often less convenient . If you live in a city , it is noisy , buy there ’ s more to do . 
 I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . When the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes . 
 Just remember that in that village there ’ s nothing to do . There ’ s not even a pub or restaurant . There ’ s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods . 
 I want to leave the motorbike outdoors . 
 Why not ? 
 You want to go with him ? 
 Then you must be off your head . He is a real bastard . 
 I'm in a really good mood , actually . How about you ? 
 what's wrong ? 
 that's too bad . I'm sure there's a logical explanation for it . Don't be too upset about it . 
 I see how that can get a bit annoying . 
 so what are you going to do about it ? 
 what do you think would make you happier ? 
 relationships can be confusing sometimes . 
 I'd call him and dump him now ! You deserve better than him ! 
 I usually have the wrong notion that he's very serious . 
 No wonder when I pass your room , I always hear your laughter . 
 What ? 
 What ’ s wrong with you , Ted ? 
 What ’ s wrong with speaking English ? 
 What are you doing that for ? 
 Good for you . 
 You know-sweeping , scrubbing , washing , drying , waxing , polishing ... 
 You got that right ... and my mom's still mad about what we did with the dishes . 
 Listen , I'd better get back to the grindstone . 
 I'm scared that she might not come back . 
 But she took her luggage away with her . 
 What time do you have ? 
 I must be off now . I'm pressed for time . 
 I really enjoyed tonight's party . Thank you , Sarah . 
 Nice meeting you , too . 
 Perhaps because of the dirty air . 
 Some poisonous gas . 
 Yes . I think I won't come here again next time . 
 We waste a vacation . 
 Who did the stupid thing ? 
 I don't think so . Dick has been on the ball and he never does things like that . 
 Rose , the weekend is coming . Let's discuss what we will do . 
 Sounds good . But on Saturday there's a football final . 
 Let me see . We can visit the country . We haven't done that for such a long time . 
 OK . 
 He has been keeping bach after divorce . 
 Once bitten , twice shy . He said he would rather keep bach than to live in disgust . 
 Is that different from this kind of zoo ? 
 So tell me about it ! 
 Special rules ? 
 Details ? 
 Why not ? 
 That makes sense . But that sounds interesting . Is there one in Beijing too ? 
 I prefer to go there next time . 
 What subject do you like best ? 
 No wonder your English is so good . 
 Has the chief accepted our plan ? 
 Let ’ s have a try . 
 I'm moblogging ! 
 Oh , moblogging is a combination of the word ' mobile ' and ' blogging ' . It's another form of blogging . Users can publish blog entries to the web from a mobile phone or other mobile devices . 
 Yes , you're right . I can blog wherever and whenever I'm on the move . It's especially good when I'm on a business trip and my laptop happens to be away from me . 
 Well , if I simply want to write a few words , I'll send it by email or edit it all from the cell phone browser . 
 Then I'll shoot some pictures , re-size the images and upload them with text descriptions to my blog . 
 You bet it ! 
 Yes . We had a big talk with him , and he has really turned over a new leaf . 
 But I think it wasn't too bad . 
 It's exaggerated . Actually this sort of thing happens to everyone . 
 Yes , they are all on the shelf . 
 Yes . Here you are . 
 Well , I like to play the piano . 
 About 18 years , I started learning when I was a kid . 
 Sure , so , what about you ? Do you have any hobbies ? 
 Why are you laughing ? 
 Well , how was your honeymoon ? 
 Peak periods always entail hours of queuing . At least you got a nice tan though ! 
 My friends and I just got back from Bali . 
 Yes , we were lucky . My friend's father owns a resort on one of the islands , so we were able to stay for free . 
 I took a few diving classes , but I didn't really like it , so I did snorkeling instead ! 
 I've got quite a few pictures of all different kinds of fish . I'll show them to you next time I see you . 
 We're planning on going skiing in Switzerland . Do you ski ? 
 Would you like to go skiing with us for christmas ? 
 It is Europe's spotless land of lakes and mountains ! Let me know as soon as you can so we can get a discount . 
 I've got to be going now too . 
 See you later . 
 Yes , I am . I have life insurance and my home and its contents are also insured . 
 That ’ s a good idea . You are a fireman and it can be a dangerous job . 
 I can terminate my life insurance policy when I retire and use the money as a pension . 
 Did you have to take a medical before you could take out the policy ? 
 You look pale , Paul.What ' s wrong ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that.Anything I can do for you ? 
 I can't decide whether to go to university or to get a job . 
 But I don't even know what to study . 
 That's what my parents want me to do . 
 But my friends will have jobs and lots of fun , while I spend all my time doing reading and writing . 
 Hm , what you say makes sense . But you know , I still have to ask my parents for pocket money , and I hate to do so at this age . 
 You're right . Thank you for the advice . 
 How many credits for each course ? 
 Thank you , sir , I'm sure I will . 
 Yep . And it breathes , see ! 
 Yes , it is . Look at the little light ! It blinks off and on . 
 I would look so cool carrying this around ! 
 Really ? I thought the exhibition showed that he had real talent . What did you think of it ? 
 I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever read a good review of an exhibition by that critic . He doesn ’ t seem to like anything . Which kinds of paintings do you prefer ? 
 Yes , I do . I like painters who use rather than watercolors . The colors appear richer . What do you think ? 
 Yes . Good artwork is very expensive nowadays . When I was in china , I bought some calligraphy by famous artists . You should come and see it sometime . 
 I know what the characters on the paintings mean . I think Chinese characters look very artistic . It ’ s said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist ’ s character . 
 What do you like to do in your spare time ? 
 Really ? 
 They are beautiful . You did a good job . 
 As a matter of fact , you are really a terrific photographer . 
 Yeah . It's already December , you know . 
 How did you know ? 
 Does it happen often ? 
 Paul failed again . 
 How can we help him ? 
 Hi , Elvin . How are the new programmers I got for you ? 
 Are you still mad about your nose ? How is it ? 
 That won't be necessary , Elvin . Look , I want to apologize for your nose . I'm sorry . 
 I'm afraid I've got to go . I have another appointment at five . 
 No problem . 
 I will . 
 Yes , I'm afraid I am . My husband is a smoker too . 
 No , but my husband smokes twenty or more a day . 
 I had my first cigarette when I was seventeen . 
 Yes , twice . 
 Hey man ! Everything is just groovy baby ! 
 I wanted to , but I ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block ! I was chatting her up a bit and then we mellowed out at her place . 
 Gravy ! Jim is such a jive turkey man . He is always hitting me up for cash . Anyway , you wanna book and go grab some grub ? 
 Are you a newcomer ? 
 You speak good English , though . 
 But let me tell you , you're doing just fine . I couldn't do half as well as you do when I was learning German.By the way , how long have you been learning English ? 
 That's a very nice pair of glasses . 
 Yes , and I like the color too . It matches your eyes . 
 That's incredible ! 
 What does she like to do ? 
 Hmm . Sounds like she has pretty pricey tastes . 
 Have you thought about going Dutch ? 
 Not where , what . Dutch means you both pay your own way . 
 Do you know his sister ? 
 That's right . 
 Um ... let me see now , is it 18 or 19 , I can never remember ... 18 ... 19 next birthday . Tthat's it . 
 Well ... 
 Yes ... quite pretty . 
 Yeah , what's up ? 
 I like to stay here . 
 People are very kind down your way . You ’ re lucky . 
 Never . 
 Yeah . People down our way hardly speak to each other . 
 Yes . I have been here for three years . 
 Well . I ’ m rather disappointed with it . 
 It ’ s too old . And it isn ’ t as specious as I expected . 
 I ’ ll just have to put up with it . 
 He makes me sick . 
 I just lost my job . My boss just told me . 
 I don't understand of myself . It seems they have to save money . 
 How can I lose weight , doctor ? I seem to get fatter even when I just look at food ? 
 I never eat breakfast though . 
 I never thought about it that way . 
 Oh doctor , I feel so foolish . 
 I know doctor , thank you so much . 
 Yes , I agree . The air here is much more polluted than in my country . 
 Yeah , you are right . 
 The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don't believe that any single country can do anything about it . 
 Excuse me , can you tell me where I can take a taxi ? This is the first time I have been in England , so I don't know where I can do at all . 
 Thank you very much , by the way , is it quite expensive to take a taxi ? 
 All right . I only hope to get a skillful driver , and drive me to my stop safe way . 
 Thanks a lot , bye bye . 
 Whose handset sounds so beautiful 
 Are you able to compose music ? 
 Who composed it for your ? 
 Can I get on line to search one , too ? 
 What about my SIEMENS ? 
 I don't know what to do about the people who live in the flat above me ! 
 They're incredibly selfish . They ' re always up until the wee hours of the night playing their music so loudly that I have to wear earplugs in order to fall asleep ! 
 I tried to introduce myself to them when they moved in , but they were so arrogant that I didin't want to ever talk to them again ! 
 They both just talk about how great they are all the time . 
 They are ! Besides being loud and arrogant , they're also terrible gossips . They're always talking about everybody else in the apartment . 
 I don't , but they talk so loudly that I can hear what they're talking about from my bedroom - and it's not very nice . 
 Most of my other neighbours are scared of them . 
 I can't afford to move right now . 
 I think you're being a bit optimistic . If you met them , you'd understand . 
 It's nice and bright today , isn't it ? 
 Tomorrow will be fine too , I think . 
 Susan , I am inviting you and Frank to our house warming party this weekend . 
 Yes , Deborah and I are going to buy a new home in Woodlawn . 
 Well , we have always dreamed of owning our own home , but real estate in this area is extremely expensive . 
 That ’ s a good idea if you can find employment nearby . 
 Tell me something about your Valentine's Day . 
 So romantic.young people must have lot of fun . 
 How are you doing , Andrew ? 
 But you have so many friends ! How could you be lonely ? 
 What about me ? I ’ m your friend . 
 I know what you mean . I find it difficult to make new friends , too . It ’ s not as easy as it was when we were young , is it ? 
 I ’ Ve made a lot of new friends since I started learning English . Maybe you could join a club or take a class to make some new friends . 
 What kind of qualities do you look for in a friend ? 
 People who play ultimate Frisbee have a positive attitude ; maybe you should join the ultimate Frisbee club . 
 He dresses in plain clothes and drives an old car . Who would know he is the richest man in town ? 
 Oh , I must have been sitting in the same position too long . My legs have fallen asleep . 
 And I need to stretch my legs now . 
 Coming as ? 
 Um ... I have to confess , I haven't given it much thought . I'm from China and Halloween really isn't celebrated there . 
 Oh ... Sure . We have an entire month ! In traditional Chinese culture , Ghost Month is a period when the door between this world and beyond opens up and ghosts come back to earth for a visit . 
 Well , people sometimes set off firecrackers , some people burn paper money as an offering and many people go to a temple to burn incense.Mainly though , you need to feed the ghosts because they're hungry . 
 Yeah ... we set up tables with food , fruit and drinks and offer that to the hungry ghosts . 
 Yes ! How did you guess that ? 
 Good Point ! 
 No ! So ... is Halloween essentially the same thing as ghost month ? 
 Oh , that's my great , great , great , great , great , great , great grandfather . 
 Peter Madsen . A great A if I do say so myself . 
 He loved his family and his countrymen and his freedom . 
 He was . He was friendly toward and showed concern for everyone he met . 
 Yes , he does . He often has had one to many . But I advised him not to drink too much , he just boasted that he had hollow legs and nobody had ever drunk him under the table . 
 Did you hear ? The state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city ! Soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business ! 
 What are you talking about ? How does it exploit people ? 
 Geez ! Now that I think about it , maybe legalizing gambling isn ’ t such a good idea ! Although , I have been to Las Vegas , and I didn ’ t become addicted or anything like that . 
 Mr . Rogers ? 
 I'm not feeling too well . 
 Yes , I would . 
 I can manage on my own . Thanks . 
 Can you give me a ride back home ? 
 Come on in . I am so glad you are here . We have been expecting you . 
 No , you are just on time . We haven ’ t really started yet . 
 Thank you , they ’ re beautiful . You can hang your coat over there . Try this new couch , it is so comfortable . You will love it . Want something to drink , tea , coffee , juice or Cola ? 
 Make yourself at home . 
 Well , I don ’ t mean to boast but all the designs are done by myself and some colleagues are already trying to copy some of them for their new apartments . Look , they are making photos now of my designed kitchen . 
 Yes , I have a very special one . I will be doing volunteer work in a zoo for two weeks . A friend of mine working there told me the other day that they were in need of some volunteer keepers . I was very interested . So I asked him to get me the application form . Lucky , my application was approved by the manager very soon . 
 I will help to prepare food , feed animals and clean up . I ’ m very excited about it now . 
 Ok , I will bring you photos as many as possible . 
 Yeah . But whatever the planes are , he always has an eye to money . 
 Happy birthday , Alice , here is a little something for you . 
 Mike , did you win the lottery or something ? Why the big smile ? 
 You did ? That's great ! You must be very happy now ? 
 Did you tell your parents yet ? 
 They're probably going to be so happy . 
 Where should I park ? 
 I drive a scooter 
 No , I haven't seen those spots . 
 I park in the daytime . 
 No , I have not seen the signs . 
 No , I don't know what the curb colors mean . 
 As we know , mobile phones bring people great convenience and shorten the distance among friends and relatives . 
 Is it ? I've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone . 
 That's true . Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones . 
 We'll miss you while you're studying in the United States . 
 The dinner was really good . It knocked my socks off . 
 Great . Sweet wines are my favorite . They always make a great finish to a decisions meal . 
 Port , please . 
 The port is quite exquisite . It must have spent years aging in barrels . Am I right ? 
 Next time we are about to dinner we should try some Canadian ice wine . 
 It's made from naturally frozen grapes . 
 OK , here's to your health . 
 Cheers . 
 My mother is ill in the hospital . 
 The disease fails to respond to drugs . 
 Bourbon , please . 
 With iced water , please . 
 Thank you . Now how much do I owe you ? 
 That is OK . Here is 20 dollars and you can keep the change . 
 Jack's been looking unhappy lately . 
 No wonder ! I'd be unhappy , too . 
 Oh , no ! I can't have failed . surely ? 
 Whatever am i going to tell me parents . 
 What am I to do ? 
 Three other people started to bid . One called himself Buddhabuyer , so I knew he meant business . I raised my bid twice , but it kept going up . 
 I don't know . I dropped out at $ 250 . 
 No . It wasn't the super bargain I thought it was . 
 that's true . But I have a low opinion of those women who go out with foreigners . 
 I think some Chinese wone marry foreigners for money while others just want to live abroad . There is no true love between them . 
 well , then why aren't there many East-West couples where the man is a Chinese and the woman is a Westerner ? 
 or because they are less attractive to to Chinese men . 
 you know , usually the woman is in her thirties and she is a left girl . 
 they're called that because they're left behind on the shelf . They're also known by their three H's---high diploma , high salary , and high degree . and they're also known as the three S's — single , 
 that ' for sure but very few . 
 On the contrary , I think he's very serious . 
 So they're easy to remember . 
 He's an old antique , very serious . 
 Hey ! How about your history teacher ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . 
 How about the languages . 
 That's more convenient . 
 Thank you , Peter . Come into the dining room . We are going to cut the cake soon . 
 That's Cathy . She is pretty , isn't she ? She likes dancing . Ask her to dance . 
 Don't be afraid . She isn't going to bite you . 
 How about having a cup of tea with us ? 
 Would you like to go to the cinema with me ? 
 Excuse me , could you tell me where you have got that music book ? 
 It's too high . I can't reach it.Could you help me ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Let me guess . You want to watch the History Channel again ! 
 Well , I guess I could tape The X-files and watch it later ... 
 Mysteries of the Pyramids . Didn't we watch this program last week ? 
 I'd like that very much . 
 Fine . See you later . 
 You are so old-fashioned . I have already watched it last week in cinema . 
 Its 3D animation is attractive and its colorful scenes are also unforgettable . 
 Well , its theme is moving and profound , so from the academic aspect , this is its advantage to win the award . 
 Yes . I love it , too . 
 I'm not sure , but I think it must be directed by Zhang You . That's typical of him . 
 I am . I just went to the travel agent ’ s and picked up these brochures . 
 I fancy going to Tibet for a few days . Have you ever been there ? 
 would you recommend going there for a few days ? 
 you ’ re probably right . What do you think about Yangshao ? 
 I ’ d like to get away from the big city life . 
 I guess if I only have a few days , I should probably think about going somewhere that isn ’ t far away . 
 thanks ; I ’ ll give them a call later . 
 I am worrying about my husband . 
 You know , he is a taxi driver . He has to have his eyes peeled all the time when he drives , especially during the rush hour . 
 Who ? 
 Not for a couple of years . What happened to her ? 
 Oh , she is . 
 Not surprising . I bet she's very tall and slim . 
 I'd like to talk with you again about what happened . 
 What type of movies do you like ? 
 That's an interesting combination . How about western movies ? 
 Why don't you like horror ? They're entertaining . 
 Ha ha . I know what you mean . But it's just a movie . They need for the characters to do that . 
 You can't help learning when you're using it all day . You'll see . A few weeks'study in the school will have a similar effect on you . 
 Oh , she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use English throughout the class . She doesn't mind your making mistakes , though . 
 Hey , your Chinese is coming along ! 
 Yeah . It ’ s a lot better than mine . 
 Hang in there . It ’ ll all come together one of these days . 
 Sure . What's the matter with you ? 
 Don't be so nervous ! Relax ! First , sleep early at night . Second , study two hours a day after school . Third , don't tire yourself out , but don't be lazy . Will that help ? 
 Alison , would you like to have some more ? 
 Actually you haven't had much . 
 That sounds ridiculous . Why ? 
 I feel that Bob ’ s father-in-law is a hard nut to crack . 
 But his daughter is a very nice girl . 
 You are right , look at the crowd . Do you think we will be able to get tickets ? 
 No way . I'd rather go to another movie house . 
 All right . Let's see when the next movie is playing ? 
 Shall we take a chance ? 
 It's moving so slow . 
 I don't think anyone will . 
 Don't cover up your sadness . Let it go . 
 It isn't your fault . No one will blame you . 
 I've been told that you are a very successful businessman abroad . I wonder how you managed to achieve such success ? 
 I suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first , wasn't it ? 
 You mean you didn't know much English then ? 
 That's incredible . Could you tell me what you did to make a start ? 
 Really ? I wish you could tell me more about your experience . 
 Hey , Mike . Can I ask you something ? 
 I'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . Who do you think will win ? 
 My husband is betting on France . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Good afternoon , sir . You are really a regular customer here . May I ask you why you come here so often ? 
 I see . But isn't it a bit too noisy ? 
 I can see that . Then what is your favorite coffee ? 
 All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ? 
 I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . Though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient . 
 Which country makes the best coffee in the world ? 
 I agree . I heard in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ? 
 No , we don't , especially the old people . But more and more young people fall for coffee . 
 Why are there still so many people overweight despite the current fitness craze ? 
 What are they ? 
 Why ? 
 That makes sense . Probably less time to make dinner and the junk food is cheaper . 
 What's that ? 
 Wow ! No wonder people are so fat . Say , Carl , looks like you could be doing a bit more exercising . 
 You should consider eating healthier food and getting some more exercise . 
 So what happened ? 
 You should have kept trying . 
 The same to you , Joey . 
 It's very thoughtful of you . Wow , it is so beautiful . Could you tell me how American people celebrate Christmas ? 
 Hey , Cindy , I'm so sorry about yesterday . I shouldn't have yelled at you in front of everyone . 
 I don't know what happened to me . I just lost it . 
 Yeah , you're right . Good night . 
 it ’ s so sad . They had been together for only two months . Do you know what the matter was ? 
 really ? I ’ m very surprised . He doesn ’ t look like a guy who ’ d ever do that sort of thing , right ? 
 maybe it is for the best . They are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people . 
 he is an extrovert while she is an introvert . He likes parties while she hates them . 
 anyway , she was right to end things and she deserves better . 
 no , I don ’ t think so . I know Mary . Once she makes a decision , she won ’ t change her mind . 
 so do I . 
 Mine are wet , too . 
 She wished good luck to you . 
 Yes . 
 No , what happened ? 
 Really , what's going to happen now ? 
 Oh , hey ... 
 Actually , my office is right around the corner . 
 Yeah , yeah , it was really interesting . You know , I'm in a bit of a hurry , but here ’ s my card . We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion . 
 You know what , this is really embarrassing , but your name has just slipped my mind . Can you remind me ? 
 Hello everyone ! I ’ m Rick Fields , and here with me is Bob Copeland . 
 That ’ s right , and it looks like we ’ re just about ready to start the match . The ref is calling the players for the face-off ... and here we go ! The Russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! Federal gets checked hard into the boards ! 
 Alright , the puck is back in play now . Pavel Bure is on a breakaway ! He is flying down the ice ! The defenders can ’ t keep up ! Slap shot ! He scores 
 What's the matter , Lisa ? You don't look too good . 
 You mean Mark ? He seems like such an honest guy . 
 Two months ? How did you find out ? 
 So you asked him about the girl who called ? 
 What'd he do ? 
 What channel did you watch last night ? 
 You did ? How do you like the fashion show ? 
 Sorry to interrupt . Can I have a word with you ? 
 What are you doing ? 
 Would you travel around the world if you had the money ? 
 Hello baseball fans , and welcome back to today ’ s game ! My name is Rick Fields and of course , I am here , once again , with the man that seals the deal , Bob Copeland . 
 Well , the national anthem has just been sung , and the umpire has started the game . It ’ s time to play ball ! 
 A very nice curve ball by the pitcher . The catcher gives him the sign , he winds up and Vargas gets a line drive ! 
 Great play ! 
 Home run by Okapi ! That puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at Richie Stadium ! 
 You know , all I was trying to do was tell the truth but they obviously didn ’ t take it that way . 
 Yeah , I ’ m dealing with it . Anyway . Thank you , Mike . 
 I know she is quite an article , but I was not sure of her ability to cope with a boss . 
 But most bosses are fools for woman . 
 I am sorry too . I know we've been talking about this beach trip for a while . I should have told Bob I was busy this weekend . 
 thanks for understanding . 
 hey , what if the three of us go to the beach together ? Besides , you and Bob haven't seen each other for a while . I don't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers . 
 I know Bob won't mind . You can bring a date , like that guy from the bar you keep talking about . 
 Hello , Jill . 
 Fine , only a little tired . 
 Thank you very much for looking after my house in my absence . 
 Yes , Please.It ' s very kind of you . 
 The rooms are very tidy and the flowers grew very well.You are very helpful . I want to thank you for everything you've done for me . 
 I bought you some books on literature , I don't know if you would like them . 
 Not at all . 
 It ’ s so sad . They had been together for only two months . Do you know what the matter was ? 
 Really ? I ’ m very surprised . He doesn ’ t look like a guy who ’ d ever do that sort of thing , right ? 
 Maybe it is for the best . They are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people . 
 He is an extrovert while she is an introvert . He likes parties while she hates them . 
 Anyway , she was right to end things and she deserves better . 
 No , I don ’ t think so . I know Mary . Once she makes a decision , she won ’ t change her mind . 
 So do I . 
 Sorry . Were you trying to sleep ? 
 I'm sorry . You're right . I should have asked . 
 Well , I like to play the piano . 
 About 18 years , I started learning when I was a kid . 
 Sure , so , what about you ? Do you have any hobbies ? 
 What do you do in your spare time ? 
 Do you mind if I come along sometime ? 
 Hi , Craig ! How are you ? 
 Really ? That's too bad ! You should be at home in bed . It's really important to get a lot of rest . 
 And have you taken anything for it ? 
 Well , it's helpful to chop up some garlic and cook it in chicken stock . Then drink a cup every half hour . It really works ! 
 She is , like , mega-intense , isn't she ? 
 What's it like to work with her ? 
 Tell me about it . 
 Vince wants us to have everything debugged and ready to go by the end of the month . 
 A ETV ? Are you serious ? ETV ? 
 I don't know . I never went to one . 
 Many Americans have never gone to a ETV . It ’ s not an American thing to do . 
 OK , let's go . 
 Where did you say ? 
 Right . 
 Is she really ? I can ’ t believe it ! 
 Good gracious . That ’ s incredible ! 
 You ’ re kidding . 
 Really ? I ’ m surprised . 
 Are you thinking about a public school or a private one ? 
 Public schools are usually state funded , whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere . 
 One isn't necessarily better than the other . It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers . 
 Yes , sometimes . 
 How many credits for each course ? 
 Thank you , sir , I'm sure I will . 
 That's okay . I can explain a little . 
 Don't worry . You can't lose all your money.because you won't gamble all your money . 
 Of course I'm right . I already told you the rule for Las Vegas . Remember ? 
 That's right . That's the best way to have control over yourself.You say to yourself . Tonight I will gamble fifty dollars . Only fifty dollars . No more.If you follow the rule , you can't lose more than fifty dollars . 
 But I won't let you do that . I will watch you . 
 So how much do you want to gamble ? 
 500 dollars ! That's too much ! You just said you are afraid to lose your money.If you're afraid , why do you want to gamble 500 dollars ? 
 That is a bad attitude to have , Karen ! If you think that way , Las Vegas will be really dangerous for you . 
 Cheer up ! Let bygones be bygones . 
 It seems you have to take time . 
 I ’ m so sorry I ’ m late . But Henry ’ s car broke down . 
 I don ’ t like your Rose . And I do love Henry . And I ’ m going to marry him . 
 Your Rose is a fool . 
 Why don ’ t you marry Rose , then ? 
 I'm sorry that I'm late . I couldn't find the room . 
 What are we doing ? 
 May I have a book ? 
 Hi , Bob ! How are you doing ? 
 I'm fine too , thank you . 
 With the greatest pleasure.Where is the concert this evening ? 
 What's on the program ? 
 I couldn't wait to meet you in person . 
 Same here . 
 John , have you ever watched Beijing Opera ? 
 What do you think of it ? 
 I couldn ’ t agree more . Actually , I ’ m a Beijing Opera fan . 
 Hello , I need to register for a class . 
 I want to take a Psychology class . 
 Can you tell me what days the classes are on ? 
 And the other class ? 
 Are you sure these are the only open classes ? 
 Okay , sign me up for the class on Monday and Wednesday . 
 Hi , Martin . I ’ Ve been looking for you all morning . 
 I want to say goodbye . I ’ m leaving for America tomorrow . 
 Yes . 
 Thank you . 
 Me too . I ’ ll write to you once I get settled . But I have so much to do . You might have to wait a while . But I really will write to you . I love to write letters . I think it ’ s more meaning than the emails even than the phone call . 
 Thank you . 
 Bye . 
 I am always on the look out for such girls . 
 Mark is one of them . He has trouble with a girl who turned out to be a dead beat . 
 Yes . I dare say it will be . 
 No . I don ’ t think that ’ s possible . Some places are sure to be open . 
 Mmm , you may be right . 
 No . We couldn ’ t possibly . 
 It will be summer . So it will be hot . 
 Yes . It could happen . 
 Cool ! Each contact comes in its own saline solution ? 
 Wow ! How high-class ... a new pair for each day ... 
 Cool . So are you near-sighted or far-sighted ? 
 hey , Mary , what's up ? 
 oh , that's exciting . What's this guy like ? Is he hot ? 
 it seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ? 
 well , that's something I've never heard of . But if you as me what I value most in a friend , I would have to say honesty . 
 yeah , I know . A friend in need is a friend indeed . I don't need fair-weather friends either . 
 Yes , I am studying in Eastern Asian language department . 
 I major in Japanese . 
 It's very helpful.the course has let me into a world of literature . i read so many great literatures . 
 It's going to rain . 
 you haven't spent much time with Sophia lately . Are you speaking to each other at the moment ? 
 but you two used to do everything together . I thought you really enjoyed each other's company . 
 can't you hang out with them , too ? 
 maybe you should invite her over for dinner , so it's just the two of you . 
 it can't be that bad . She was always a really good friend to you . 
 she's probably just excited about her new job . You should give her some time . It would be a shame to lose such a good friend . 
 I still think you two should try to patch things up . 
 Do you like flowers ? 
 What's your favorite flower ? 
 Peach blossom is really beautiful . 
 I like lotus . 
 But there aren't any lotus now . 
 That's not bad . Let's go . 
 I'm from Canada . 
 What are the movies that are playing ? 
 I've never seen a movie I don't like that had Harrison Ford in it . 
 Yes . What time does it start and do you want to meet me there ? 
 Great ! I have a coupon for free popcorn at that theater ! 
 Wow , sounds chaotic ... two thousand people in the streets carrying picket signs and shouting slogans . What gave them the motivation to finally organize and call management on the substandard working conditions ? 
 So what kind of demands do they have ? What are they asking for specifically ? 
 Hi , Peter . I ’ m afraid I can ’ t make it to dinner tomorrow night . 
 It ’ s just I ’ m not feeling well . I think I ’ m coming down with a cold or something . 
 Thanks . I will . 
 I think a mountain village is splendid ! 
 It has fresh air , and it is nicer than a big town . 
 But I like the small mountain village . The big town is noisy . How charming it is when walking along the hill ! 
 It's getting late , and I have to go now . 
 Please excuse me , won't you ? 
 what's your opinion about childless couples ? Will you choose to have no kids ? 
 why ? Do you have to make a choice now ? 
 what's the puzzle ? 
 oh , I see . I think the older generation tend to think in a different way . 
 oh , really ? Maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren . 
 definitely . 
 don't worry . I think in most cases , children are the glue that keeps a family together . 
 sure . You can fully enjoy your time together . 
 Why , this is the most interesting film ! 
 But it's only a film . 
 Eighty-five dollars . If my bid is the highest after three more days , I win ! It's fun ! 
 But they won't ! I checked the seller's history , and he got good reviews from other buyers . 
 You are so paranoid ! Not everybody is a crook , you know . 
 Give me a minute . 
 There you go . 
 What's wrong ? 
 What's so bad about it ? 
 Sorry about that . 
 Well , let me talk to my manager , okay ? 
 Sorry , madam . You have to wait your turn . The parking lot is full . 
 Madam , patience is a virtue . 
 I'm sure a spot will open up soon . 
 What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck ! 
 I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling ! 
 I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go . 
 I don't know . 
 What do you mean ? 
 I have plenty of gas . 
 So what can we do ? 
 Alright . That's a good idea . 
 Days ? 
 Oh , my God ! It's good we have food . 
 Okay , I'll follow your advice . 
 I don't really feel like a walk . 
 All right.That sounds more interesting . 
 I have had enough gin fizz and bloody mary . But I have no idea about Chinese cocktails . 
 That ’ s good . 
 Thank you . Oh , it tastes excellent . 
 The news goes so fast . Ah , yes , I haven't decided yet . 
 Maybe you are right . But the major is not fit for me . I like architecture more than computers . 
 Well , I know . So I am thinking now . 
 Thank you for your kindness . I will think about it carefully . 
 My mom phoned me this morning , and asked me to go back home to have housework chores . 
 God knows . Speaking of chores , I would rather do some washing than cooking . 
 I really hope that I could sleep like a log all through two nights . But ... Some one said that weekends are a bit like rainbows ; they look good from a distance but disappear before we get up close to them . 
 Hurry up . We're going to be late . 
 What are you doing ? 
 So , did I tell you about my New Year ’ s resolution ? I ’ Ve decided to go on a diet . 
 Exactly ! I ’ m going to cut out all that junk I eat . no more chips , no more soda , no more fried food . 
 But this time I ’ m going to stick to it . I really mean it ! Trust me , Carol , I ’ m going to be a new man in one year ’ s time ! 
 Thanks , honey , that was a great meal . I ’ m stuffed . Do we have any chips left ? 
 Which one will you be going to ? 
 Sure , I've been meaning to visit that place myself . 
 OK , can I bring a date with me ? 
 Yes . that is a very good idea . It would be a shame if we could not find a place to sit . 
 I'll be there . Oh , is there a cover charge at the bar ? 
 I want to make sure I bring enough money for my date and I . 
 One last question.Is there a dress code there ? 
 Perfect . I wanted to have a casual evening tonight . 
 Okay . See you then . 
 Table tennis . 
 Not really , but I like watching . 
 Not at all , Sam . 
 It's snowing heavily . 
 The snow is so beautiful . 
 What brand ? 
 Soda or water ? 
 All right . Please wait for a minute . 
 No . what's it like ? 
 Would you want to live there ? 
 What's your dreamhole like then ? 
 Would you want to buy an old cottage or build a new one yourself ? 
 Is that why you wear second-hand clothes as well ? Because they've got character ? 
 I see . If you lived in an old house , would it be decorated in a modern way ? 
 Rachel , do you like music ? 
 What kind of music do you like best ? 
 Really ? I can't believe this . I am also keen on classic music . And do you know there is a concert of classic music tomorrow evening ? 
 I got two . We can go there together . 
 Look at what you have done . All thumbs . 
 What is your hobby ? 
 What kind of reading materials do you like best ? 
 You look great ! 
 So you are happy that you made the decision to join us . 
 What's that ? 
 It's not good to start with too much work-out at the beginning . What about trying something else ? 
 More and more people are warm up to Yoga these days . Do you want to have a try ? 
 Absolutely . But it takes great perseverance to master . 
 Here is a free class going on right over there . Go and join them . 
 Everything was okay when it started , but the music made me drowsy . So I think I may have dozed off for a minute over there . 
 No . Actually I can stay longer . Dave called to say that there is a beautiful Chinese girl who ’ s going to pick me up at the school gate tonight at ten thirty instead of eight thirty . 
 Yeah . You know what Dave just said ? 
 He said I should put on something very nice , because this girl will be my next target . 
 He always makes fun of me . He always says things like that . You know the new coming teacher , a Chinese Canadian . He said she would really be my chance . 
 No , you ’ re kidding . I ’ m not taking it seriously . 
 What's the cause ? 
 I see why it lags behind other towns . 
 Yes , she is . 
 No , she is an English teacher . 
 You mean the man wearing jeans ? He ’ s her little brother . 
 I ’ Ve been to most of the countries in Europe , several countries in asia , china , Japan , korea , and Thailand , and to the united states and Canada . 
 no , but I ’ m planning on visiting Australia and New Zealand soon . I ’ Ve heard that they are beautiful countries . Which is the most beautiful country you ’ Ve been to ? 
 isn ’ t it really cold there ? 
 I ’ Ve been to other Scandinavian countries , but not to Norway . Perhaps I should go and do some winter sports there . 
 Nothing . He's just got a chip on the shoulder . 
 A friend and I are planing to go out , why ? what's up ? 
 I am afraid I can't I am going to be out all day . 
 I wish I could , but it's my mums birthday . 
 Much as I ' d like to , I am afraid i wont be free next week , I have a lot of work . 
 I am really sorry too , maybe I can give you a call sometime . 
 Fine , thanks . How's your boy , Jack ? 
 Poor boy . They work hard at school nowadays , don't they ? Does he like it ? 
 Yes , it does . Does he go to school by bus ? 
 What does he do when it rains ? 
 Are you an American ? 
 Why don't you speak English ? 
 Oh , do you like Chinese ? 
 I want to study German . Can we exchange lessons ? 
 When will we begin ? 
 That's all right . 
 Thank you.That ' s the result of exercise.By the way , do you work out ? 
 Fine . 
 Thank you . I just consider working as part of my life . 
 What's he like ? 
 You must feel very uneasy at his home . 
 Lizzy who ? 
 Of course I do . 
 You mean Mary ? 
 Sure . I know her elder sister Sue and younger sister Mary . 
 Yes , certainly . I know her mother and father , and brother and sisters , too . 
 Why do you ask me these questions ? 
 This place serves good breakfasts , don't you think ? 
 What are you planning to do today ? 
 Have you done windsurfing before ? 
 Can you take a little advice from a friend ? 
 Don't waste your money . Windsurfing is very hard . And it will be windy today.They will charge you fifty dollars for a half-hour , and you won't be able to windsurf.You will fall and fall and fall . 
 Yes , but it takes a long time to learn.You would spend a thousand dollars to learn it on a rental windsurfer . 
 I don ’ t know what I ’ m going to do ! It ’ s going to be impossible to make ends meet if I lose my job ! 
 It was a rather big mistake . When you work as an investment adviser , one small mistake can cost the company millions . 
 That ’ s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . There ’ s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . I ’ m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ’ s nothing I can do about that . My boss won ’ t believe me if I tell him the truth . 
 I have enough to live off of for about 3 months . But I really don't want to spend my life savings on just living ! I ’ d rather invest my money somehow . 
 Next month . So I can either move out then or renew my contract for another year . 
 That ’ s very generous of you . I guess that would work . 
 I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy . Maybe losing my job would be a good thing ! 
 Sure , what's up ? 
 Tell me which building it's in . 
 I know where the C building is . 
 Of course , which room number is it ? 
 I actually have a class right around there . 
 I can do that . 
 Snipers ? 
 So you're afraid someone is going to snipe your Buddha ? 
 Count me out . I can do without shills and snipers and turbo-bidders . 
 Well , I ’ Ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown . 
 I ’ m planning on living with my parents . Won ’ t you ? 
 You mean they ’ re kicking you out ? 
 Well , it ’ s not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . They said that it ’ s ok if I move back home to begin with , but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so . 
 I know I need to learn that myself , but I just don ’ t have the money for it at the moment . Living at home allows me to save up some money before I started finding a place . 
 I ’ d love to , but you know I ’ Ve got another appointment . I ’ m really sorry . 
 I ’ m afraid not , George . You gotta know something , I ’ m not available any more . but I know Becky has a crush on ya . 
 Ok , so who are we going to invite to our dinner party ? 
 Don't forget my friend Andy from the office . He has nothing to do on Friday , so I invited him over . 
 Why can't we ? 
 I'm not sure . He just broke up with his girlfriend recently , and I don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon . 
 I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill . It's only a superstition . It really doesn't mean anything . 
 Ok , ok . I'll ask my sister to come . That way we'll have fourteen for dinner . 
 I can't believe it , I had faith in Bob and he let me down . 
 Really ? 
 Hello , Alice . Would you like to go to the temple fair with me ? 
 Yes . The ancient custom of holding temple fairs is to offer sacrifices to the god of the earth , and they have developed into a festival filled with food , performances and games now . 
 Absolutely , I love temple fairs . Beijing has several temple fairs recently . They are different from each other to some extent , but also have a lot in common . 
 What about Tianqiao Temple Fair ? A variety of opera performances , acrobatics shows , and food will dazzle you . 
 Of course . 
 Excuse me , Supen . 
 Please forgive me , but I have to leave . I feel terrible . but ... 
 My daughter isn't feeling well . 
 I don't know . Will you forgive me ? 
 Thank you . It's our first date . I hope it's not too offensive . 
 Hello . Can I help you ? 
 I'm sorry , but that class is already full.And also , students are supposed to register through the touch-tone registration system . 
 That's because it's full . 
 Well , I could put you on a waiting list.But that doesn't guarantee you will get into the class . What is your name ? 
 Alright . And what is your major ? 
 Wait a minute . You're a Comp Lit major ? 
 Why didn't you tell me ? I didn't know you were one of our students . 
 The university computer system saves extra places , in class 287 for comp lit students . I can give you a special code.When you register by phone , you can use the code to get into the class . 
 That's right . 
 Sure . Here is the code number , with information on how to use it . 
 Sure . Just call the touch-tone registration system again.Then , follow the directions on the sheet . You will get in no problem . 
 Next time you come in here , I will recognize you . 
 Where ? Oh , that's Henry . 
 He's very nice , actually , but rather eccentric . 
 Yes , but he may be too eccentric even for you . 
 Well , haven't you heard ? 
 Well , apparently , he's been having an affair with his secretary . 
 According to Mary , he's divorcing his wife and there's a big fight going on about the children . I thought everyone knew . 
 Oh . Thanks . Look , I must just go and say hello to someone . I'll be right back . 
 That is a heavy raining afternoon . I was standing under the eaves of a shop to evade the heavy rain . It's getting dark . 
 I was trembling in the wind when he ran to me with an umbrella in his hand and asked , ' Where is your home ? ' 
 Yeah . 
 He joked later that I was so poor that he had a kind of impulse to protect an ant . 
 Where are you from ? 
 So you speak German , don't you ? 
 Oh , I see . What other languages can you speak ? 
 Good . 
 Gee ! You scared me ! 
 Yes , Ma'am . No magazines during the office hours . I'm sorry . 
 It is about sports for white-collar workers , people like you and me . 
 Aerobic sports , for example , jogging , yoga , skating ... 
 Stretching exercise after sitting a long time . 
 Can I have my magazine back now ? 
 I like NBA very much . 
 No , I didn't . 
 Do you like NBA ? 
 Who do you like best of the NBA players ? 
 So do I . 
 That's fine . 
 Sure ! What kind of food would you like ? 
 I know the perfect place ! 
 It's right past that last building on the left . Do you want me to go with you ? 
 Glad you asked me to join you . This will be fun ! 
 Oh , what does it say ? Does it say water could still exist under the surface of Mars ? 
 Then could the soil on Mars somehow be fertile enough to Groh simple plants ? 
 Actually , we are doing a project in school that involves landing a ship and staying on Mars for an extended period of time . Does NASA have any type of portable habitats that could be used to stay on the planet ? 
 One of the most exciting things about Mars is that there could have bean life on it . What are your personal opinions on the life on Mars theory ? 
 But maybe there is a chance of gradually improving the surface and atmosphere of Mars so it may be inhabitable by humans . 
 I'd still like to hope that some day we could set up a human colony there . 
 Would you like to go sightseeing tomorrow ? 
 What would you like to see in Beijing ? 
 I ’ ll pick you up here tomorrow . 
 Our science field trip is next Monday at 8 a . m . in the morning . Can you mark that on your calendar ? 
 That will be Monday , December 2nd . We need to start loading the buses half an hour early , so plan to arrive at 7 . 
 We will return 6 days later on December 8th . Will someone be picking you up ? 
 The return bus will leave the campground at 5 p . m . and return to campus 3 hours later at 8 p . m . 
 I am going to post all of that information on the geology club web page . Check it out when you get a chance . See you Monday ! 
 Hi . 
 OK . 
 It's huge ! 
 There must be about 50 computers in here . 
 Do I have to take gym ? 
 Oh , my ! It's really hot . I've never seen such scorching weather in my life . 
 Oh , look at the thermometer ! The temperature has hit 98 . 
 But it's already awfully close . 
 I guess you can ’ t do anything until after dark then . 
 In the discus throw , you scored 30 meters at the final throw . How did you make it ? 
 Is this your best score ? 
 Hi , where have you been ? 
 Oh , how was it ? 
 do you want to go out for dinner tonight ? 
 I'm starving , so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions . 
 I'm not really in the mood for Italian , actually . I was thinking of something a bit spicy . 
 I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy . 
 the Taj ? They're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food . 
 shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ? 
 that's right . It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway . 
 are you sure ? We could go Dutch . 
 I won't argue with that ! Let's go ! 
 Bob and I plan to play hockey in the morning . 
 Well , in the afternoon , after a long nap , we ’ ll go yachting with Nora . 
 How about you ? What are you going to do tomorrow ? 
 So do you think I can take it ? 
 I know , but things are getting a bit out of hand and I just can ’ t do nothing . 
 You ’ re right . 
 Joe ? I don't know what you mean . 
 Oh , I took a shine to him when we met for the first time . But it comes and goes . 
 Watch out , Patrick ! 
 Well , humans could never make something like that . 
 Be a little more open-minded , Stu ! Don't believe everything you read in your history books ! 
 Speaking of The X-files , it's on right now ! 
 Yes . I moved here last week . 
 I'm Charlie . Nice to meet you . 
 Since we live in the same neighbourhood , maybe we can help each other from now on . 
 Thank you . I will . 
 From mid-November , snow started to pile up in Ottawa . 
 Although the weather here is very cold , the people are warm . 
 The summers are so great here ! Not hot at all . I love the cooling breezes , the clear air , all the greenery . 
 Let's do both ! Are we in a rush or anything 
 Sounds fine to me . Whatever , let's enjoy this pond first . 
 I see them ! Wow ! How do you know they're wild ? 
 They're neat . Now Let's take that path into the woods and see what we can see ... 
 No . She was right . I was too nervous . I kept thinking , What if we blow it ? 
 She even stayed at a different hotel . She said I might be contagious . 
 Hi , Bob , this is Mary . 
 I work for an Internet company . 
 Hey Jack . What's going on ? 
 Really ? When did you decide this ? 
 That's exciting , man . 
 You shouldn't use my example . It wasn't special . I kind of wish I made it more special but it's too late now . 
 There are a lot of options . You can surprise her over dinner , or ask her in a public area , or if you have the balls , ask her father in front of her . 
 Thought about what ? 
 I don't know . You should know how she's going to react . She is your girlfriend . 
 Don't mention it . Good luck . You're going to need it . 
 On this occasion , most people do . 
 She is a beautiful bride . 
 Are you crying ? 
 Harris and Anne are perfect for each other . 
 You and Tom also make a great couple . 
 For the wedding ? 
 Try to catch this bouquet then . 
 I'm not sure.Let me have a look ... It could be a coffee grinder . 
 Yes , it must be used for grinding coffee beans . 
 Hi , Jack . Long time no see ! 
 Not bad . At least I am still alive . 
 Where did you get that idea ? 
 You are right . I am not boasting , but she is really as beautiful as she is intelligent . 
 Here's your drink , sir . 
 Oh , I'm terribly sorry , sir . I'll go and get you cola right away . 
 Yes , sir . I'll bring your drink right away . 
 Is there , sir ? I'm very sorry . I'll change it straight away . 
 I'm really sorry . 
 I suppose I do . 
 You said it . 
 It sure is . 
 Well , If you live in other as long enough you love them just as much . 
 Well , I ’ d better get back to work . I ’ Ve got a ton of stuff on my desk ! 
 Yeah , definitely . I was hoping to catch a ride with you . 
 Where will you go in your vacation ? 
 You're so industrious . 
 thanks . This is my power suit . I have a dinner date tonight . 
 she's a friend of Amy . We met at Amy's birthday party . 
 yes . I hope it pans out . Cross your fingers , Lily . 
 oh ... so you buried the hatchet with Steven ? 
 then who will you meet tonight ? 
 really ? Are you sure this is a good idea ? 
 I know , but remember to meet in a public place and don't give out your personal information . 
 Yeah well it ’ s about time ! He ’ s been living with his parents for 40 years ! 
 Who are those kids walking down the aisle ? 
 I just hope the priest makes it quick . I ’ m starving . I hope the food ’ s good at the reception . 
 Oh great ! Does this mean that the reception is canceled ? 
 Oh , no ! I can't have failed . surely ? 
 Whatever am i going to tell me parents . 
 What am I to do ? 
 hi , Meally , do you know that guy over there ? 
 He is cute . What dose he do ? 
 Really ? Are you going to introduce us ? 
 Hello , I'm Lance . 
 Nice to meet you , too . 
 Yeah , some places are very short of water . 
 You see , . This time I traveled to the West . When I looked out of the windows of the rain , all the lands that I could see are as dry as a bone . 
 These things are always oooo boring . Heard any gossip ? Anybody making the big bucks ? 
 That's no news . Those two were high school sweethearts anyway . 
 Uh , I can see that . And Erica Falls has lost a lot of weight . 
 How are your Chinese lessons going ? 
 Well I guess you have fewer characters but I think Chinese grammar is easier . 
 Yes , I guess basic speaking in the English is easier . 
 Let me hold the door for you , miss . 
 Can we talk ? 
 You know what I mean . 
 I want to know where this relationship is going . I ’ m in love with you and I need to know ... 
 I ’ m awesome . Well , I guess that ’ s my answer , isn ’ t it . 
 Look , if you don ’ t love me , it ’ s not a thing , alright , we ’ Ve had our laughs , but I don ’ t appreciate ... maybe it ’ s just time we ... 
 You do ? 
 Oh , I love you too ! 
 Oh baby , I ’ m so sorry . 
 How do you do ? Mr . Barker . 
 Oh , Parker with a P ? 
 Er ... I ’ m Barker . 
 Yes , with a B . 
 Thank you , Mr . Parker . 
 Better take the subway . It ’ s faster and more convenient . 
 We have a rather comprehensive subway system here . we can get almost anywhere rather quickly on the subway . Especially at this time of a day when the traffic is heavy . 
 Just give the man standing there three yuan and he'll give you a token . Then you slip it into slot at the turnstile and push the turnstile to get in . 
 Where can I get the subway Madam ? 
 Do I have to pay additional fare to change train ? 
 I've heard The Hitchhiker would be on next week . I want to see it . 
 Yeah , I love horror movies the most . Would you like to go with me next weekend ? 
 Well , What kind of movies do you like ? 
 In a word , you like all the movies except for the horror movies . 
 Not quite . I also like romance and comedy movies very much . 
 So we can relax now . 
 Excuse me , sir . Could you spare a minute ? 
 Do you go to work by train every day ? 
 And would you mind telling us what you think of the rail service ? 
 Why do you say that ? 
 Which train do you catch in the evening ? 
 And can you get a seat ? 
 Would you agree that the service is fast ? 
 Hi , Kate . 
 Yeah , I saw someone walking like you , but I wasn ’ t sure . We haven ’ t seen each other for how long ? Almost three months ? But you look quite different now . 
 Oh , you look quite slender and more vivacious . What have you been taking ? Are you on a diet ? 
 Wow ! That ’ s great . I sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals , but it ’ s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . Also you know , old habits are hard to break . 
 Dance ? You only go dancing ? That ’ s not hard . I can do that . 
 How do you usually sell your products now ? 
 Oh , really ? Is it a good way ? 
 What advantages does it have ? 
 Yes , if we do business through other ways , it will cost a lot of time . 
 Yes , going abroad to join the exhibition will cost much . But does it have any disadvantages ? 
 You mean there may be credit problems ? 
 Will you give some suggestion ? 
 Thanks . Maybe I will do business through Internet in the future . 
 Cinct de mayo ? 
 Do we get a day off from school then ? 
 Www , man ! 
 Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ? 
 And then what happened ? 
 Did your wife give birth yet ? 
 Congratulations . How is your wife doing ? 
 That's good to hear . 
 If your wife and baby are both happy , what more can you ask for ? 
 That's normal for anyone with a newborn . 
 You'll get used to it . After everything stabilizes , you can regain your health . 
 Irene ! I heard you were on a date last night ! So , how how did it go ? I want all the juicy details ! 
 Okay , now you really have to fill me in . What ’ s he like ? 
 He sounds hot ! What does he do for a living ? 
 Hold on a sec , his name is David ? 
 That ’ s my brother ! 
 I have no idea yet . Do you have any suggestions ? 
 I'd like to . 
 OK , will do ! 
 I don't know . 
 Yes . 
 It is not true . 
 Well , I confess . I did it , because I urgently need money to buy some medicine for my mother for she is badly ill . I'm ashamed that I did that . 
 I will . 
 I don ’ t know ! This stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . Luckily , I managed to start it up and drive it here . What do you think it is ? 
 What do you mean ? My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . It ’ s brand new ! 
 Ugh ... So how long is this going to take ? An hour ? 
 What ! How am I supposed to get to school or go shopping ? This is not happening ! 
 Yes , a little breeze and a lovely moon . 
 Me , too . 
 That is a deadly risky business . He should have it coming on him . 
 I bet he is . He domed his own life . 
 Yes , I like it very much . 
 Where is it ? 
 Have you visited it before ? 
 Like what ? 
 Sounds marvelous . 
 Great . I will prepare some clothes and food for the climbing . 
 Frank has gone out with Lucy again . 
 Lucy is known as a social butterfly . She has taken many rich men for a ride , you know . 
 To tell you the truth , it's the most tedious course I'ever had . 
 It is still a mystery to me . 
 Of course . I always keep what I catch . 
 If it's within the legal limit , I prefer to keep it . 
 Thanks , June . But I think I need to be certified as a mechanic before I ’ m allowed to repair cars for a living . 
 I guess I never thought of that before . 
 Wow , you ’ Ve inspired me to do something ! 
 Well , I have the day off from work . 
 Well , I ’ Ve been working so hard lately , so I ’ ll probably just take it easy . 
 Yeah , I ’ ll probably just stay in and relax . Maybe watch a few movies . 
 Sure . Any time . 
 Haven ’ t you heard ? Richard was fired by our manager . 
 Believe it or not . Everybody is talking about it in the company . 
 Me too . 
 It's very nice , I like it very much . 
 My pleasure . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer . 
 Oh , really ? But you're doing the tango wonderfully well . 
 Thank you for your compliments . It's just that you are a good leader . Do you like the samba and waltz ? 
 Waltz is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances . 
 My pleasure . Let's go and have a drink . 
 What can I do for you today ? 
 Can I do anything else for you ? 
 We don ’ t allow people to check out magazines . 
 It ’ s just a policy of ours . 
 You may check out books or videos . 
 You will have to just read it in the library . 
 Happy Valentine's Day ! 
 Could I treat you to dinner tonight ? 
 Wow ! Look at the time . lt's about 11 0 ' clock . 
 I've got to catch the last bus . See you later . 
 I have no idea . Maybe I will sleep for the whole day . 
 Sounds interesting . Who are the other people ? 
 Gorgeous ! What should I bring on that day ? 
 You mean , we can do many other things after the picnic , right ? 
 What are we waiting for ? Come on ! 
 so ... what kind of things do you do in your free time ? 
 I like to do just about anything outdoors . Do you enjoy camping ? 
 have you ever been camping in the Boundary Waters ? 
 it's fantastic . My family and I are very fond of the place . 
 sure , would you like to see them ? 
 I have a Canon SLR . 
 I'd call it one of my hobbies . Do you know much about photography ? 
 have you heard about the photography exhibit that's going on at the art gallery this weekend ? 
 yes.In fact , maybe we could go together . 
 how about at 11:00 ? 
 So Janet , do you do any sports ? 
 Yeah , how often do you go ? 
 Not bad ! Do you do any other sports ? 
 Guess what ? I won the speech contest at my school . 
 Oh , hi Pam . When did you get back from Canada ? How was it ? 
 Which city did you like better ? 
 And what's Montreal like ? What did you think of it ? 
 Which one has better nightlife ? 
 Well , I've always wanted to see Vancouver . I've heard it has the most beautiful views . 
 You can't help learning when you're using it all day . You'll see . A few weeks ' study in the school will have a similar effect on you . 
 Oh , she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use English throughout the class . She doesn't mind your making mistakes , though . 
 What happened to my cup ? 
 Don't worry about it . I've got another one I can use . 
 I'll be right back . I just need to mail this package . 
 Well , I studied French at school , but I ’ Ve forgotten most of it . I learnt some Russian while I was studying there and now I study Spanish in evening classes . Do you speak Japanese at home with your pa 
 How do you find studying a language on the internet ? 
 I bet you find the character difficult to write ! 
 So , you can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers , right ? 
 In a way , it ’ s similar to your experience of learning Chinese . Some Spanish words are very similar to English ones . But I need to practise listening to native speakers and saying the words myself . 
 He quit 
 Is this absolutely necessary ? 
 Will you be able to make up the work you missed ? 
 Remember that I will only let you miss one class meeting per semester . 
 Could you e-mail me this week as a reminder ? 
 Make good use of that day off ; you'll only have one this semester ! 
 The system of public schools is fairly uniform everywhere throughout the United States . 
 Most public schools in the United States are very good , and the majority of students attend the public schools . 
 Children needing special instruction . Children whose parents can afford to send them to private schools , and children whose parents want them to receive a religious education . 
 No , public schools can be very different . Even in the same city . 
 The public schools in the United States are free to everyone and there is no cost to the student . In most states , even the textbooks are free . There are no restrictions as to color , race , or religion.Any student wishing to attend the public schools may do so . 
 I ’ m afraid I ’ m already booked up for next Sunday . But thank you just the same . 
 Have you seen this ? 
 They killed another hostage . 
 I agree completely . I just don't understand what's wrong with them . Don't they have any humanity ? 
 Yes , but that doesn't make them right , does it ? Just because they think so ? 
 Come on , you can't be serious ! We should never give in to terrorist's demands , otherwise where would we be ? 
 Really ? What happened ? 
 Oh , sure . 
 Fine , thank you . 
 Very well , thank you . I ’ m meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at 12 , would you care to join us ? 
 Where did you get your mobile ? It's really cute . 
 Thanks . Gee , it's really light ! 
 I've got an old Ericsson . Here . Take a look . 
 Yes , I like collecting antiques . 
 I don't know . I like this one , and I don't have any need for all the bells and whistles you get on the new ones . 
 Well , I just need to make and receive calls , and it's quite reliable . I find that the more fancy stuff they put into these things , the more likely they are to break bown or go wrong , you know ? I mean , this camera function , for instance-how often do you use it ? 
 Well , that's nice I guess . So how many kids do you have ? 
 I ’ m sorry , but I can ’ t find the book that you lend me . 
 I must apologize . I ’ ll buy you a new one tomorrow . 
 How did Jim get the money ? 
 He must be mad ! Nick is a loan shark . 
 Are your ready to go to the supermarket ? 
 I've got my money and my keys , so I'm ready . 
 It wasn't cold out this morning . 
 Have a look outside for me . Does that look like hail to you ? 
 That's a good idea . But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it . 
 How long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ? 
 Maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse . 
 Good idea . That will help us to warm up . 
 Alright . I'll have a cup of tea waiting for you . 
 Almost . I ’ Ve put up the decorations , and we ’ Ve decorated the Christmas tree with plenty of tinsel and baubles . 
 I ’ Ve prepared most of it already and we ’ Ve got plenty of snack foods-you know , crisps , biscuits , and things . Are you going to make the punch ? 
 I think everyone will be coming . Dave don ’ t come because he has to go to his parent ’ s home and they live in Scotland . 
 Yes , we do . I hope we have enough for everyone . Did you send out all your Christmas cards in time ? 
 I did the same . I spent hours yesterday evening wrapping presents . I hope I didn ’ t forget to buy anyone something ! 
 Today is the old couple ’ s golden wedding . 
 Yeah . They promised to stick together forever when they were young . 
 I don ’ t know . 
 I'm sorry . Am I keeping you awake ? 
 I'm sorry . I thought you wouldn't mind . 
 Pretty good . Where are you going ? 
 Wait . We have to return to our homeroom and wait to be dismissed . 
 Our homeroom teacher has to take attendance again to make sure that we're all here . 
 Yeah . I'm going to my locker to get my jacket . Catch you later . 
 What ? You have been in love for six years , haven ’ t you ? 
 What a pity . 
 Oh , it's really a drag . 
 Hell with it ! Nobody will give it an Academy award ! 
 Sure . Speaking of photos , what type of film will be the best ? You know , I'm planning a tour to Jiuzhaigou Valley . 
 Thank you so much . You're an expert . 
 Well , I was born in Ohio , but I grew up in Texas . 
 In 1978 . I went to college here . 
 Drama . I was an actor for five years after college . 
 Because I needed the money . And because I was good at it . Look ! What do you think ? 
 Very well . We ’ Ve got everything taken care of already . 
 Neither of us is very religious , so we decided not to get married there . 
 Yes . The Palace Hotel . You have to be there . 
 Look ! The girl is so beautiful and she is smiling at me . She is lovely . 
 What makes you think so ? 
 What's the matter with you ? You don't look well . 
 Really ? I like rainy days . The moisture in the air is good for my skin . 
 Me , too . At this time of the year , I often miss my home in the warm south . 
 Thanks , Denise . Actually , I was really surprised . I mean , there were a lot of qualified people out there . 
 Thanks a lot . I expect to see your name nominated pretty soon , too . You ’ Ve been doing some great work ! 
 There ’ s so much I want to do . I ’ Ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . I just ran a search for music to download . 
 Thanks . That would be very helpful . I ’ Ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . There ’ s too much information on the net . 
 Yes , I did . There ’ s an anti-virus program with my email account that scans all attachments , so I ’ m sure I haven ’ t sent anything nasty to anyone . 
 That ’ s good advice . I should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself , such as my password and credit car number . 
 How do I do that ? 
 That ’ s useful to know . Thanks . I ’ ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee . 
 Come off it . 
 Why not ? 
 Hum , I think there's enough for one more , yes . 
 Nice to meet you , George . I'm Irene . 
 I'm in computing . I work for Macrohard . 
 What do you do ? 
 Are you still busy today ? 
 Fine , honey . Rome couldn't be built with in one day . 
 Take care , honey . I am always expecting you . 
 You know , if I can keep up my workouts , I think I have a chance in 2004 . 
 In gymnastics . I'm pretty flexible . Look ! I can even touch my toes ! 
 I do back flips at the pool all the time . 
 When are you off ? 
 Well , good-bye . See you soon . 
 Have you ever noticed that serious pollution in modern cities goes from bad to worse ? 
 I think it ’ s time for the government to take strong action . And people should try to protect environment . 
 When will you be able to come here ? 
 Okay , I'll have everything prepared for you when you get here . 
 Who's that tall guy over there ? 
 What's he like normally ? 
 Really ? What kind of problems ? 
 Really ? Well , I hate to say this , but I'm not surprised . 
 Well , he doesn't look very honest . 
 Oh , don't talk to me about laptops . Mine crashed on Friday and I lost everything . I hate them . 
 Look , I need another drink . Do you want one ? 
 Vodka martini ? 
 I'll be back in a sec . 
 John passed away . 
 Yesterday . He suffered from a serious disease . When he saw the red light , it was too late . 
 Peter is a bag lady now . 
 He was so rich in the past . Maybe he ’ s regretting his past mistakes now . 
 Hello . Is this Ann ? 
 Yes , it's me . 
 No . Worse than that . I have a flu . I'm in bed with a fever . 
 I'd like to do it , of course . But I just can't . I'm afraid I'd fall down in the middle of it . 
 Why not just tell him I'm sick ? I'll ring him myself this afternoon . 
 Not yet . I feel too lousy to go out.Anyway , I have a flu . I know what it is . I don't need a doctor to tell me that . 
 I'm not sure yet.Maybe this will all be gone in a day.So it's probably better if you don't call off my appointments . I will call you later this afternoon and tell you what I think . 
 Yes , that's what I plan to do . Except I won't make the chicken soup.Right now I don't think I could swallow more than a spoonful of it . 
 Yeah , I'm very nauseous.It ' s mostly nausea and a fever . 
 Thanks , Ann . Talk to you this afternoon . 
 Susan , good evening . Why are you so dressed up ? 
 You look great . Your make-up is perfect . 
 No , the one you have on looks fabulous , especially with your hair like that . 
 With that dress I'd say your white diamond necklace would look perfect . 
 Not much , just a house party with some friends . 
 Yeah , most of the people are from our office . 
 I ’ m sure you ’ ll have fun no matter where you go . Remember to take your bag . 
 I'm not an expert , but that's the impression I have . 
 Needless to say , as a Westerner , it's bread . 
 Study English . 
 It gives me great satisfaction . 
 I don't mind the work . I think it's worthwhile . 
 Just okay . 
 Good idea . 
 No , I can ’ t accept it . Business is business . 
 It is , isn't it ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 She is a grow-up . She can make her own decision . 
 How wonderful it is to be in love ! It's love at first sight ! Oh . he's my Romeo ! 
 Oh , Mary . You've surprised me ! 
 Um — I was just thinking aloud . 
 Come off it , Mary . 
 You certainly do like teasing me , Mary . Well I'm in love with someone . The question is , how do I get his attention ? 
 I guess I asked the wrong person . 
 Steve , I was born ready ! I ’ m going to blow you guys off the treadmill today . 
 Let ’ s hit the whirlpool for a bit . It ’ ll help me loosen up . 
 John's very late.Do you think he's coming ? 
 I suppose you're right.He can't have remembered . 
 Don ’ t think any more about it . 
 It ’ s really not necessary . I know your intention was good . 
 You are saying he will be promoted to the general manager ? 
 Are you sure ? 
 Just because he gets on well with everybody ? 
 Would you like to come by and play bridge ? 
 Well , to tell the truth , I don't really feel like it tonight . I had a pretty hard day and I'm sort of tired . 
 Oh , we always go to the movies.Can ' t we do something different ? 
 Let's see.How do you feel about playing bridge ? 
 Well , shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over , and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff . 
 Hello , Janet.It ' s me ... Oh , fine.Just fine.Say , Janet , I was wondering if you and Tom were doing anything tonight ... No ? Well.would you like to come by our place and play a few hands of bridge ? 
 I'm glad too . Steven , I want to tell you that I'm going to divorce my wife . 
 We don't get along well with each other and fight a lot . 
 That isn't true . Actually , we have been separated for six months . 
 Thank you , Steven . I accept your advice . 
 I'm glad too . Steven , I want to tell you that I'm going to divorce my wife . 
 We don't get along well with each other and fight a lot . 
 That isn't true . Actually , we have been separated for six months . 
 Thank you , Steven . I accept your advice . 
 That's a good idea . You'd better hurry up before they've filled all classes . Many people are learning how to drive now . 
 I am not sure . You can search for them on the Internet . 
 Let me see . teetee Training School , summer program , 3,000 Yuan , learn how to drive within one month , and get driver's license within three months . 
 I think so . Let's see the next one , 3,500 Yuan , summer program . Forget it . 
 Search on the Internet then , see if we can find something more about it . 
 Don't worry . Let's check out some other schools . 
 Yes , reading is my hobby . 
 Many kinds of books . When I was a child in elementary school , I enjoyed reading fables and science fiction . When I became to a teenager at middle school , I was interested in detective mystery stories . Now I like reading romance stories . 
 Why ? 
 Well , maybe . 
 What does she like to do ? 
 Sounds like she has pretty pricy tastes . 
 Have you thought about going in Dutch ? 
 Not where , what . Dutch means you both pay your own way . 
 Hi Rose , what are you busy with right now ? 
 Well , Rose , 
 Are your free this weekend ? 
 Great , Is it convenient if i visit you this weekend ? 
 I'd like to call on you this weekend . I just want to a drop in for a chat . 
 Is 5 PM . a good time for you ? 
 Sure , that would be great . I'll bring the wine . 
 I'll be there on time . 
 nothing really . I think I've had a few too many coffees . 
 it's the only perk of this job ! How's your day going ? 
 why is that ? 
 your boss is a real salve-driver , isn't he ? 
 that's not just your boss . No one is allowed to send personal emails from the office . 
 maybe your boss isn't so horrible after all ! 
 try not to let it bother you too much . 
 ok , I'll see you in a bit . 
 Hi , Mr . James , what's the rush ? 
 I can lend you some money . 
 Can I help in anyway ? 
 Sure . Let ’ s go . 
 That was the straw that broke the camel's back . 
 We've heard about that festival before . It would be quite helpful if you could give us some highlights of the festival . 
 What do you think we can see during the festival ? 
 I'd like to take the one that goes to the Wild Animal Park . 
 Wow , must be interesting to watch dragon boats compete a-gainst one another on the city river . 
 You're right . We're not really into used stuff . 
 There aren't many places that sell used things in Taiwan , besides auction websites . 
 Great ! I can teach you men a thing or two about shopping ! 
 They aren't evenly matched . 
 Yet the Argentine attacker is worth a bet . 
 Yes , but I ’ m afraid it ’ s still a mess . I haven ’ t put anything away yet . 
 Don ’ t say that . It looks like a dump now . I can ’ t stand it . 
 Unfortunately , yes . 
 I took a long walk through the neighborhood this morning on my way to the train station . It took me 20 minutes . 
 I thought paying a lower rent would be better , but now I ’ m not sure . 
 Yes , if you consider 7-11 is a supermarket . 
 That ’ s right , or I ’ m going to spend a lot of time walking . 
 Are you a full-time student or do you attend part-time in the evenings ? 
 Will you be riding a motorcycle or do you drive a car ? 
 That permit will run twenty-five dollars ; will that be cash or credit card ? 
 Do you need a second permit for a car ? 
 Fine , here it is and have a great semester ! 
 Aah ! Close your eyes . You aren't supposed to see this . 
 You can't peek ! This is a surprise . 
 Here's one little hint . If you don't go out right now , this won't be under the tree . 
 And please shut the door and lock it behind you ! 
 Keep it . I'm buying tonight . 
 Sure I can , my treat . 
 I think I'm making good progress . 
 At first it was , but now I've got the basics.It ' s fun . 
 Thank you . But I ’ m sorry I ’ m in a bad mood at the moment . 
 That movie's just a lot of noise , same as Simon . 
 I had to go by myself , he couldn't make it . 
 Kitty's ? He sure gets around , doesn't he ? 
 His excuse was familiar . He said his car died again . 
 I know . Last week he gave me a lie about being too busy . 
 Well , I think it's the time to pull the plug . 
 Thanks anyway , but I'll do it , Rebecca . Let's get to class . 
 As a matter of fact , I have . I ran into him just the other day . 
 Not too well . He had to have four teeth pulled last week . 
 I think so , too . 
 I'll be sure to do that . 
 What ! 
 Chill out . It's just Kenny from South Park . 
 South Park is a popular cartoon . You're so out of it , Jen 
 Wait for me 。 
 Can you believe the headlines ? 
 I'm reading about Michael Milliken , the Bond King . 
 He got arrested all right . 
 Yup , that's him . He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless . 
 That's the kind of thing in America that gets me mad . Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail . 
 Yup , you got it . Criminals in America do a lot better if they're white-collar thieves . 
 He's giving lectures on business at colleges . 
 How did he make a fortune ? 
 I didn't see you at Mr . Johnson's class today . 
 Why ? 
 Why don't we Chinese have our own Valentine's Day ? 
 Oh ? Why is that day ? 
 The idea about Friday the Thirteenth is totally ridiculous . I don't believe it at all . 
 Why not ? The whole idea is superstitious . 
 I know that . But that has nothing to do with being unlucky . Those who created the virus are deliberately making fun of people . 
 Well , going to a cinema , visiting the galleries , exhibitions and museums , finding and meeting old friends , exercising in the health club or mountain biking . There are so many good choices . 
 Why not start with the most interesting one ? 
 Toss a coin to decide then . 
 Yes , it's really a surprise . How are you ? 
 Oh , he is all right . But busy as usual . Well , why don't we have a good chat at a bar ? It's been long time since we met each other last time . 
 Jenny , are you having a good time ? 
 I ’ m glad you are enjoying yourself . 
 It ’ s my pleasure . Can I get you another glass of champagne ? 
 It ’ s my pleasure having you here . 
 Sure , I think that would be possible . Where is the fundraiser ? 
 Would you need it for both Saturday and Sunday ? 
 I think that would be OK . Who will be driving it ? 
 Could you drop it off on Sunday night ? 
 Yes , that would be fine . Just make sure that everything is returned by Sunday night . 
 Morning , Lee . How are you ? 
 I ’ d like to take this opportunity to thank you for everything you did for me . 
 I wouldn ’ t be able to make it without your help . 
 Hi , dear , do you know what the important day is today ? 
 Please think it over . 
 Come on , dear . I know you mustn ’ t forget it . 
 Ur , you really let me down . 
 No , you haven ’ t . You just don ’ t care about me . You ’ re an indifferent husband . 
 It ’ s an anniversary of our weeding . 
 Would you recommend some materials on the World War Two ? 
 Yes , but I don't think they are enough for me . 
 That's a good idea . Thanks a lot . 
 Some people pile on their agonise and try to seek other ’ s sympathy by telling them how miserable they are . 
 I was fooled once . A lady told me she needed some money to keep the pot boiling . So I gave her some money and bailed her out of the situation . But later I learned that she had lied to me . 
 Nothing rang a bell . 
 It was terrific . I really enjoyed it . 
 I was there for about three weeks . 
 Yes , most of the time . But it snowed a lot in Chicago . 
 Oh , that's difficult to say . But I guess I liked Nashville the best . 
 Thank you . I have been working on it for several years . 
 It also helps that I have strong team members , such as yourself . You really know your stuff ! 
 welcome back ! How was your vacation ? 
 where did you end up going ? 
 I've always wanted to go to Paris . The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! Did you go to the top ? 
 sure . What's this one a picture of ? 
 you don't look very happy in that picture . 
 so what did you do ? 
 my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . Did you go to the Louvre ? 
 that's what everyone says ! I can't wait to see it for myself some day . 
 She works as a teller in a bank . 
 Yes . She goes three times a week . 
 She wants to be a manager . 
 She takes classes in accounting and business . 
 Oh , never mind about that . 
 No , I won't hear of it . 
 Well . I am breaking up with Cathy . 
 No . She is really a very nice girl ... 
 Well , you are right . But sometimes she is too caring . Well , no ... she ’ s just possessive and I kind of want a break ... you know ... for some room for myself . 
 I've tried , but it didn't work . 
 Maybe tonight . I don't know . I don't know how to tell her . 
 I know ... 
 It was a good thing I had enough on me . 
 Jenny , what's wrong with you ? Why do you keep weeping like that ? 
 Honey , cross my heart , I'v never looked at another woman since the first day I set my eyes on you ! Believe me , that's the truth . 
 This is the specialty of our restaurant , sir . 
 Thank you for appreciating it . 
 What ? How happy you life is ! I do envy you . 
 Maybe you are right . 
 No , of course not . Just in case . Nothing to worry about . Don't you also do this in China ? 
 Oh , then it's my honor to be here with you . I can see now why you've been so curious about the bar . You like this place ? 
 Yeah . Other than that , the real feature is the excellent drinks . Can I have your ticket ? 
 Well , with the ticket , you can get a free drink . What would you like ? Orange juice ? 
 I'll show you how . The bar tenders know whose turn it is . And also , I can snap my fingers to catch his attention . 
 Oh , fresh juice , I love it . Well , I heard American people love hanging out in bars . Is that true ? 
 Interesting . Hey , look over there . The dance floor is already packed with people . Oh , the girl in red dances great . 
 Maybe later . I wanna take some photos first . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes . I'm leaving tomorrow . I came here just because I want to say good-bye to you . 
 I'll miss you too , my friends . 
 Really ? I thought he loved his wife very much . 
 He deserved it . 
 It's an excellent one . I like it very much . 
 It includes a lot of useful words and phrases . 
 Come and sit down . Would you like a drink ? 
 Do you like olives ? Or would you prefer crisps ? 
 Do you like it ? It's Irish music . 
 Arm - I think it was in the CD shop in the Mall . Have you been there ? 
 Yes . Hey , I've got some photos of our holiday in Ireland . Would you like to see them ? 
 Anita , I ’ Ve been here only three days and you ’ re leaving already . 
 Gambling ? Where ? 
 If you gamble all night , you ’ ll run out of money in a few days . 
 We are going to climb a cliff on the Colorado River . 
 It is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet . 
 We rappelled down the side of 300 - foot cliff . It was very exciting . 
 Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb . 
 O . K . See you . 
 I guess the first thing is the price , the second is the size , and of course the color will play a role too . But I have to be honest . It is our today ’ s responsibility to take care about our environment . Therefore , I will also pay attention to the fuel consumption of the car . You know , the rise in gasoline prices is huge . So I would rather to consider a smaller car with smaller engine . For which I can also save some tax . Last of the list , I also consider the safety . 
 Well , I do prefer the lower emission cars as long as it doesn ’ t cost much . Some environmentally-friendly cars are really expensive . 
 I don ’ t think I can take another semester of this dorm food . 
 Sure , like taste , variety , nutritional value , what I should do is move into an apartment off campus where I can cook for myself . 
 You know how hard it is to find a decent place at this time of year ? 
 I got a car , so the distance wouldn ’ t really be a problem . 
 You bet ! 
 I'm sick . I think I've got the flu . 
 Thanks for everything . 
 You look pale , you must have poor health . 
 Why not go to see the doctor ? 
 William , do you like studying English ? 
 It's not that bad . If you talk to your American friends every day , you'll learn quickly . 
 Sure , what do you want to know ? 
 Laptop . 
 A laptop is a type of computer that you can carry with you . Do you understand ? 
 Laptop . 
 Yes , that's right . That's very good . 
 That word is pronounced kitchen . 
 Thanks . 
 Yes , I find jogging does good to me , so I keep on doing it . 
 I think so , too . 
 Believe what ? 
 You don ’ t believe that ? Everyone interprets the Bible in a different way . To some people , the Gospel 5 is a source of much comfort . 
 To tell you the truth , I don ’ t know if I ’ m a Christian or not . Christians don ’ t often share the same belief . But I believe that we all possess , by the grace of God , the potential to create fantastic changes on this earth . 
 No , all religions are essentially based on the same ideals , so no one is really better . 
 When I ’ m home in the States , I go , but not in China . 
 What has caused you to make such a decision ? Didn ’ t you used to go with Helen ? 
 Oh . That ’ s really annoying when seeing a film . 
 Hello everyone ! I ’ m Rick Fields , and here with me is Bob Copeland . 
 That ’ s right , and it looks like we ’ re just about ready to start the match . The ref is calling the players for the face-off ... and here we go ! The Russians win possession and immediately set up their attack ! Federal gets checked hard into the boards ! 
 Alright , the puck is back in play now . Pavel Bure is on a breakaway ! He is flying down the ice ! The defenders can ’ t keep up ! Slap shot ! He scores . 
 Well , Mike , nowadays there's much talk about nanometer . But what on earth is it ? 
 Hmm ... it's hard to figure out the exact size , I'm afraid . 
 I see.Thank you . 
 All my relatives are getting together at my house . 
 Who can't make it in your family ? 
 That's too bad . So , what did you ask for Christmas this year ? 
 I want some computer games also . I gave my parents a really long Christmas list . 
 So what does your family do on Christmas Day ? 
 Our family is a little different . We go to church on Christmas Eve instead . 
 Steve ! Haven't seen you in ages ! How long's it been ? 
 how have you been ? 
 yeah , I remember the neighborhood . Have you found a place yet ? 
 well , maybe I can help . Remember my neighbor ? 
 yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look . 
 I'll ask Mrs . Thou when she's available to show the apartment and let you know . Has your number changed ? 
 Not good . I lost my wallet . 
 No , I think it came out of my pocket when I was in the taxi . 
 Can I borrow some money ? 
 About 50 dollars . 
 Thanks . I'll pay you back on Friday . 
 What are you going to do now ? 
 If you wait a minute I can go with you . 
 Well , Jeff , that was a very productive meeting , I thought . You had some really great ideas in there ! 
 No , I mean it . Look , are you hungry ? Shall we go get something to eat ? 
 OK , well , let me just get my coat and we'll go to the diner around the corner . 
 Sometimes you look like brains , and sometimes you are simple a Barbie Doll . 
 Maybe I am a Barbie Doll , but I won ’ t do Barbie Doll things . 
 I heard you were on a date last night ! So , how did it go ? I want all the juicy details ! 
 Okay , now you really have to fill me in . What ’ s he like ? 
 He sounds hot ! What does he do for a living ? 
 Hold on a sec , his name is David ? 
 That ’ s my brother ! 
 I love swimming and cycling . On Saturday morning I usually ride my bike around the city or the country road for almost two hours . 
 Sure , they do . 
 Because it is convenient and good for environmental protection . 
 That ’ s what I can do . 
 Sure , I've picked up a few things from travelling around for work . Why ? 
 Did you bow back ? 
 Well , Japanese businessmen and women typically bow to greet each other in Japan . She might have been offended by your strong handshake . 
 Things are different in Japan . You know , in some countries , making eye contact with others is considered rude . 
 I think it's highly possible , yes . 
 That's a good idea . When you don ’ t know much about other cultures , the simplest thing can offend someone . 
 It's raining . 
 How was your trip to Brazil ? Did you learn anything ? 
 Tell me about it . 
 Really ? 
 Are you serious ? 
 What courses did you major in ? 
 What courses did you minor in ? 
 Do you know what E-commerce is ? 
 That's right 
 Sure , but you must have access to the Internet . 
 If I were on as many steroids as he was , I think I ’ d be powerful , too . 
 Those drug tests don ’ t mean anything ! He probably took some other drugs to mask the steroids . 
 OK , OK . I ’ m feeling a little dehydrated . Let ’ s get something to drink . 
 I think I ’ ll stay in on Saturday and rest . 
 Ah , I ’ m going to the pub to watch the football . 
 Sure , you ’ re more than welcome . I ’ m meeting everyone at three o ’ clock . 
 Will we drive to the seaside ? 
 Let me help pay for gas . 
 What other expenses will we have ? 
 Who's singing in your home , Jim ? 
 Who's Ellie ? 
 Oh , I see.how old is she ? 
 I suppose they're playing games . 
 Today . 
 Yes . 
 Eighteen.Some friends are having a birthday party for me tonight.Do you want to come ? 
 About 6 . 
 You say he was around average height . 
 Weight ? 
 Any marks on his face ? 
 Glasses ? 
 What about his hair ? 
 Long or short ? Straight ? Curly ? 
 Boy , this sure doesn't help us much . It could be anybody . How about his cloth ? What was he wearing ? 
 Are you crazy ? The papers make everybody listless . I don't think you are the exception 
 I'd better exercise my body too.My limbs are rusty now . 
 Oh my gosh , how exciting ! 
 Sure , I will . How can I miss that ? 
 Oh , don't . I'm sure you'll be the loveliest bride ever ! 
 Yes , I did , I thought it was a failure . 
 Well , maybe so . But I still think everyone has their rights of their own opinion . 
 Do you surf online regularly , Joe ? 
 Are you crazy ? What are you doing four hours online ? 
 Online chat ? Aren't you afraid of meeting bad people who pretend to be what they are not ? 
 It sounds interesting . 
 I wish I could , but I can't . 
 Well , I am up to my neck in work . I've got to finish this report . Sarah needs it by noon . I don't want to be scolded if I can ’ t finish my work by the deadline . 
 Are there many idioms in English ? 
 Can you give us an example ? 
 What about the expression Goodbye ? Is that an idiom ? 
 This is interesting , Ms.Parker . 
 No , it might be dangerous there . 
 I'd like to , but I'm tied up with my paper . 
 No.Why ? 
 Oh , really ? I go to the rye every day . 
 The same to you ! 
 We're having some friends over.What are you doing ? 
 So Kim , have you ever had anything stolen ? 
 My uncle just had his motorcycle stolen a few nights ago . I was just thinking about how clever criminals are these days . 
 I don't know . The ones who stole my uncle's motorcycle were pretty good . 
 He did . It was one of the best ones available . But that didn't stop them from disabling 11 it . And on a crowded street too . 
 You would think that people would be smart enough to stop something like that . No one knew his motorcycle was being stolen . The thieves came in a truck and convinced everybody that my uncle was parked illegally and they were there to tow it away . 
 That's not the end . They were so good that they convinced a bystander to help them lift the motorcycle and put it in the truck . 
 He does , he started five years ago and now ends up the richest among us . 
 It seemed to be useless to study well when we were young if we examine his case . 
 Not yet , Grandma , What's the matter ? 
 I'll finish soon . 
 But it's so thin . There's no way that it comes with a CD-ROM . 
 What other features are listed ? 
 Totally cool colors ! 
 Actually I have a passion for Chinese literature . 
 Yeah , those classics from the great writers . 
 How is grandpa doing recently ? 
 Maybe I would talk with him someday . 
 How is everything going with your girlfriend ? 
 Oh , I am sorry to hear that . I did ’ t know that you had split up . What happened ? 
 Really ! Did she tell you why she didn ’ t show up ? 
 What was she thinking ? Did you confront her about it when you saw her ? 
 I can ’ t believe she would do that to you . It ’ s so dishonest---and rude ! 
 I bet you she regrets what she ’ s done . You were such a good catch ! She really lost out , didn ’ t she ? 
 I know . It ’ s always nice to have some closure , but I don ’ t think you ’ ll have a problem finding another girlfriend . 
 I don't know . Well , my contract here is for one year , and I don't know what I should do after that . Maybe going around for a while . 
 Actually , I am learning that now . But it's too hard for me . You know the four tones and the stuff . It really freaks me out . 
 You hit the nail right on the head . 
 What is it ? 
 Awesome . I've been giving this a lot of thought . When can we do this ? 
 Ok , cool . 
 No problem . 
 Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do ! 
 I think someone is stalking me . 
 I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . 
 I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too . 
 Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me . 
 He followed me all the way home ! 
 Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ? 
 Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me ! 
 I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is . 
 Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile . 
 Hi , Ben . Come in . Diane's not ready yet , so you'll have to wait a few minutes . 
 Hi.It ' s a wonderful wedding , isn't it ? 
 Mary's father is a rich man , isn't he ? 
 Will Mary and her husband be ready to leave for their honeymoon ? 
 Oh , I'll try to catch it . 
 French dressing , please . 
 Oh , French dressing . 
 We still prefer French dressing . 
 Who's your manager ? Tell me ! Would you ? 
 Yes ? Anything I can do for you ? 
 Ok . 
 My house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture . 
 Yes , I have . But I have to wait . 
 Well , I'm leaving Japan and I'm going back to London , tomorrow . 
 Yeah . 
 Well , I do feel quite down because I am going to miss Japan after being here for 9 months , in Japan . I am going to miss it so much , cause I've had a great time here . 
 Oh , I am going to miss the people , the food , the night life . Especially the nightlife . 
 Well , I really like dancing . And I enjoy going out to night clubs and to restaurants and eating Japanese food also and I'm really going to miss that because it's very different to London . 
 Well , here there are many different clubs you can get into , for free , you don't have to pay , some of them . In London it's really expensive for drinks and an entry fee . 
 How about taking a walk in the park ? 
 Oh , it's so quiet here . We have the park to ourselves , only you and me ! 
 Oh , I see them . Some are doing Taijiquan , some are performing swordplay , some are practising the Chinese Wushu . 
 You are late again , Maria . The teacher is about to come . 
 Oh , Ben has been cooking for us since I started attending this evening class . The good thing is , he has made great progress in cooking . 
 How about your one-year-old baby ? 
 How sweet of them ! I have to work in the day time , study at night , and do housework during my spare time . I really hope I have eight arms and legs , like an octopus . 
 When is your Adult College Entrance Exam ? 
 Oh , my Adult College Entrance Exam is also around then . I don't know if I can pass it . 
 I just want to study in a college , majoring in economics . I've had this dream for a long time . 
 Next week . 
 what's the matter with you ? You look so upset and tired . 
 Oh , that's really tough . 
 I can understand . By the way , is there anyway I can help ? 
 Oh , that's so great , bless you ! if you need me , I'll always be there . 
 How did you two meet ? 
 Have we met ? 
 Hello , Michael . My name's Shirley . Pleased to meet you . 
 I work in marketing . I'm a regional marketing manager for an IT company . Normally , I work out of Beijing , but I'm here on business . My friend Judy over there , she lives here and she invited me to this party . And you ? How about you ? 
 Well , what a nice day ! 
 But it was not at all so fine yesterday . 
 Did it ? 
 I was fast asleep , and didn't hear a thing . 
 Maybe . I see some dark clouds moving in . 
 It'll be dusty , too , I guess . 
 Why is that ? 
 I see . The fall in Beijing is really beautiful . 
 Then what about spring ? 
 It must be cold in the winter , though . 
 Thanks for reminding me . 
 I hear you're being sent to Madrid for the annual conference . Is that right ? 
 Are you serious ? You haven't even been anywhere on vacation ? 
 Well , being able to go to the conference sounds like such a great opportunity . Have you applied at the embassy for a visa yet ? 
 You leave next Tuesday , right ? What time is your flight ? 
 If your flight is leaving so early , I can take you to the airport and see you off . I'll still be able to make it into the office by 9 . 
 I've been thinking of taking I've been thinking of taking a Crazy English course.Do you think it's a good idea 
 Really ? Do you think English is that important ? 
 Great ! It's always better to do things with a friend . 
 No , I left it at home.Sorry ! 
 So , do you want to go somewhere for dinner and practice our English together tonight ? 
 No problem . I just got paid.It ' s my treat . 
 Forget it ! That's what friends are for ! Besides , I have a VIP card for a discount . 
 I think so too.Let ' s go ! 
 Probably nothing . 
 Romantic ? I can't remember what that word means . 
 Ha , ha ! Those days are long gone . 
 Yeah , everyday . And there ’ s only one choice.All the other buses are going the other direction . 
 Oh , yeah , it ’ s terrible . I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China . It ’ s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt . 
 What happened ? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus ? 
 Hmm . Good exercise , uh ? 
 And it ’ s so much fun . One day , the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl ’ s behind was pressed against my front . I was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her . 
 What do you think ? I ’ m a good boy . 
 Of course . I can eat a horse now . 
 Where shall we go now ? A Chinese restaurant or a local one ? 
 Are you busy with your work ? 
 Yes , I'm very busy , too . Sometimes I work overtime . 
 Just so so . But we can travel twice every year . 
 Yes , we won't travel again until October . 
 What a beautiful sweater ! 
 Yes , and it goes beautifully with your pants . 
 I wish I could find one just like it . 
 Nothing doing . 
 I go jogging , how about you ? 
 Oh , that's fantastic ! 
 Neither can I . 
 You ’ Ve been using it for two weeks without paying . 
 Hey Jack . How's it going ? 
 What ! With who ? 
 Did you guys go on a date already ? 
 Does she have a boyfriend ? 
 Dude , you're a stalker man . Just ask her on a date . 
 So why do you think you're in love ? 
 That's called blind love . Well , I gotta run . Tell me how it goes next week . 
 Your husband is very helpful , isn't he ? 
 Really ? 
 Henry married Rose only after her father's money , didn't he ? 
 But he seems to be very happy with Rose . 
 Hey , David . Where did you get the sofa ? It's so beautiful . Look at the color , I really love this yellow , so bright ! It must be very expensive . 
 Are you kidding ? $ 100 for this big leather sofa ? 
 Is it a used one ? 
 Oh , I don't think I will buy a used sofa even it looks so attractive . 
 What ? How happy you life is ! I do envy you . 
 Maybe you are right . 
 I'd love to go out with you , but I'm sorry I'm busy tonight , but I'd like a rain check . 
 Ikebana , it's an art of flowers and it's quite different from Western style flower arrangement because in Ikebana's theory you can decorate one flower , only with one flower . 
 Japanese art ? Mm , Ikebana ! Tea Ceremony ! 
 Tea Ceremony ! It's , there's a certain way you have to make tea , not only make tea , there's a certain way to for example wipe a bowl . 
 Yes , with one piece of cloth , and you need to learn how to fold the cloth so that you you use each part of the cloth only once to wipe the bowl 
 There's some professionals for both flower arrangement and tea ceremony . So you need to go to a school , yes , and learn from your teacher and their hierarchy and the organization and you need to pass each test to go , climb up the ladder in the hierarchy . 
 Thanks . Now , I have to find a job . 
 I ’ d like to conduct some scientific research into genes . It would be wonderful to make a medical breakthrough . 
 Many companies and universities investing resources in genetics , because there are so many possibilities . Few people know where next discoveries will be made . 
 What newspaper are you reading ? 
 Why don't you read the local newspaper ? 
 New York Times is better ? 
 Don't be too sad . If you really think that you have no feeling with him , then , in my opinion , getting divorced maybe is the best way to solve the problem . 
 Yeah , child is the matter . Don't tell Jenny the truth , only tell her the white lie . When she grows up , you find the suitable opportunity to tell her . 
 Mark . Where have you been ? I ’ Ve been calling you all morning . 
 What ? So you blew me off yesterday and today over a stupid video game ? What game is so important that you have no time for me anymore ? What are you playing ? 
 You ’ Ve been wasting your time on this ? I can ’ t believe it ! It doesn ’ t even look fun or challenging ! 
 Fine ! 
 Can you bring me something ? I am totally hooked on this game ! 
 Oh you ’ re exaggerating . I ’ m never really good at making hairdo . 
 Thanks for saying so , but my husband thinks otherwise . 
 Hey , Lily ! You won't believe what happened in class today ! 
 A man sent Miss Smith flowers , and Bryan got kicked out of class ! 
 Me , too . I miss you . Are you any better ? 
 Does your wife work ? 
 Oh , I understand . She cooks , cleans and takes care of children . Is that right ? 
 You are really a hen-pecked husband . 
 I like current affairs programs and documentaries , especially wildlife ones . How about you ? 
 I agree . People often criticize Tv for showing too much sex and violence . 
 Right . You can ’ t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programs . They need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programs . 
 That ’ s great idea . But don ’ t the Tv station lose a lot of money because of that ? 
 Not as far as I know . We have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! That ’ s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable Tv , where you pay a fixed amount each month . 
 Well , there ’ s a wildlife documentary on Tv in a few minutes . Shall we ? 
 Well , George . I guess I am . Why do you ask ? 
 Yeah , definitely ! Thanks for inviting me . 
 I really wanted to watch the Star Wars on the opening day , but the pre-sale tickets were sold out . How did you manage to get hold of them ? 
 You paid 50 dollars for each ticket ? That's a huge premium over the regular price . 
 Wow ! I am really honored you went through all this trouble just for my sake . I really appreciate that . So , what time are we going ? 
 8 pm , that's fine with me . 
 So I'll see you tomorrow then at 8 . 
 Ok , George . Bye ! 
 Hurry up ! Mom , I can't wait any more . 
 OK , Mom . Can I swim now ? I want to learn butterfly stroke . 
 Mom , it's so terrible . Water went down into my throat and I almost got drowned . 
 Oh , Mom , I think I'm not the right person for swimming . 
 Right , I'll make up my mind . Please correct me if any of my movements go wrong . 
 Really ? I can't believe it . Everything is possible to a willing heart . 
 Yes , like a dolphin . Am I on the right track ? 
 Hi.Ed , what's up ? 
 Doesn't look like it to me . 
 Woo , easy . 
 What are you so ticked off about ? 
 Maybe I could help . 
 You've got be joking . 
 Well , don't get bend on a ship about it . 
 Certainly . 
 Several years ago . 
 Yeah . 
 Nice to meet you guys . 
 Who's that guy who's handing out beer to everyone ? 
 He sure is ! 
 Don ’ t you think that ’ s good idea to hold a party outside ? 
 How about going to a concert ? 
 Hello , Jack here . 
 I ’ m working . I often work late on Thursday . I ’ m busy this week . 
 Tomorrow ? No , I am afraid I won ’ t be able to . I ’ m going on business to Birmingham . 
 Sorry , I never go out on Saturday evening . I always watch football on Saturday evening . 
 Next Tuesday ? Just a moment . It will be the twenty-first of May ? Oh , dear . Hum , I promised my aunt I ’ ll be at her birthday party . 
 Let me see . Yes , Mary . Let ’ s make it next Wednesday . 
 Bye . 
 Easy come , easy go . 
 Yes , I found a very good job down there . 
 I'm going to miss you folks , too . 
 OK . I'll drop you a line as soon as I get there . 
 Don't ask me . 
 I'm not sure . I have to check my schedule . Where are you going ? 
 Jack ? 
 I will never go out with him anymore . 
 last time when we had dinner at the Smith's , it was a horrible experience . He had no manners at all ! 
 he made a lot of noises while eating . He talked with his mouth full and sipped loudly . 
 it is true . Everyone kept looking at him . It was so embarrassing as I was sitting right next to him . 
 I have no idea . He seemed to enjoy the dinner very much . 
 oh , he really should . 
 Congratulations . That's great ! 
 When do you start ? 
 You're going to have to put in a lot of hours you know . 
 I bet . You must be stoked . 
 Sure . It's on you right ? 
 I don't know . He's a little depressed . He's having a hard time finding a job right now . 
 That sounds like a good idea . 
 And you ’ re going to completely transform your eating habits , right ? 
 I ’ Ve heard this one before . 
 Well , I guess we ’ ll just have to wait and see . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Do you have your syllabus with you ? May I see it ? 
 Let me see . Oh yes . Your professor has placed this book on reserve . That means you cannot find it on the shelves in its usual place . You need to go to a special room called the reserve room . It's down the hall and to the right . 
 You see , your professor wants every one in the class to read the chapter . If one student removes the book from the library , it is likely that none of the other students will have the opportunity to read it . So , your professor has insured that all students have the opportunity to read it by placing it on reserve . 
 Yes , when a book is on reserve , a student can go to the reserve room and ask the reserve librarian for the book . The student can have the book for a few hours , and he or she MUST read it in the library during that time . That way , the book stays in the library , and all students have a chance to read it . 
 Will there be anything else ? 
 The government has to face a lot of social problems now . 
 But it is very difficult for any government to handle it efficiently . 
 How time flies ! 
 I can still remember our first date . 
 Yeah , oh my god ! It ’ s still there . We have our first date right on there . 
 You seemed to be dull at that time . 
 ( Smile ) I can ’ t believe this for it ’ s been 20 years since we got married . 
 I couldn ’ t have been any happier ! 
 Good morning Mike ! 
 I am having an exam at 9 o'clock , It's already 8 thirty . 
 Thank you very much ! 
 Very well , thanks , I will probably finish next week , but this is still a lot of work , I have been worked on in for six months , and i ' m so closed to end . I can fill in . 
 Yes , It's only 8 forty . Thanks so much ! 
 Have a nice day , bye ! 
 Thanks , Mr . White . That's very kind of you . 
 I am sure it will . It'll be of great help in carrying on the work I have done so far . 
 Excuse me , could you tell me how much is the ticket ? 
 That's great ! 
 I would back him up to the hilt anyway . 
 He's my brother . 
 Thanks for your belief . 
 I need a passport . 
 When can I do that ? 
 That would be great . 
 What else do I have to do ? 
 How long will it take ? 
 Thank you . That ’ s perfect timing . 
 I wouldn't say that . It looks fine to me . 
 Oh , come on , as long as it looks good on her . 
 You ’ re darn right . I am out of style . So what What's the point of keeping yourself in style 
 Hey , Sandy . Do you want to go to the ETV with us ? 
 What date is today ? 
 Didn't you notice the roses everywhere ? 
 Oh , God . I just forgot it . I should have brought roses for my girlfriend . 
 What's your favorite sport ? 
 Is the entrance charge expensive ? 
 Haha , jogging ? Perhaps it might be a bit too boring ? 
 You are really a man who knows how to enjoy being alone . 
 Do you attend school during the day or only at night ? 
 Do you drive a motorcycle or an automobile ? 
 Great , the price for that permit is thirty dollars ; cash , check , or credit card ? 
 Do you need to buy a duplicate permit for a second vehicle ? 
 OK , here is your permit ; enjoy the next semester . 
 It's OK . 
 Don't be silly . 
 All right . Next time you will treat . 
 Guess , what I ’ Ve bought for you . 
 I hope you like it . 
 that ’ s all right . 
 I'm sick of it , too . 
 It's no use complaining.If we had got enough money , we wouldn't put up with it ! 
 Let's just sit in the back . We can still hear the service from here . 
 They're probably up front . The preacher's about to speak . Let's listen . 
 Oh , how I wish this all wasn't happening ! 
 Can you say it again slowly ? 
 Oh , I see . I'll have to sink about it . 
 Oops . I meant , " think " 
 I know . 
 ... The rings please . May this ring be blessed so he who gives it and she who wears it may abide in peace , and continue in love until life ’ s end . 
 Honey , that ’ s my pinkie . The ring goes on the ring finger ! 
 That ’ s my index finger ! 
 Umm ... that ’ s the thumb , Nick . 
 That ’ s my middle finger , Nick . This is my ring finger ! 
 Is he living in the new housing estate in Killington ? 
 Do you mean the one near the health centre on Old Slate Road ? 
 His house must be worth millions ! That is one of the most beautiful areas in Oxford . The surrounding area is really peaceful , and getting into the city centre from there is very convenient . How can he afford that place ? 
 Did he know that his grandfather was so wealthy ? 
 What a lucky man . 
 What's that ? 
 The poor thing . It must be difficult being him . 
 It's said that the government will clamp down on the new policy . 
 I am not certain about that . 
 I couldn ’ t believe you should crack such a joke to them . 
 You carried it too far . You obviously offended someone . 
 I know , I know . But someone took offence . 
 I'm off to Barcelona for a week . 
 yes , here you go . I don't need a visa to go to Spain , do I ? 
 that's good advice . 
 are there any seats available by the emergency exits ? 
 ok . I'll take that one then . 
 I like to travel light so I just have this one . 
 yes , please . That's a fantastic idea . Which gate do I need to go to ? 
 I think it's important that all people have the ability to read . 
 Hey , Cindy , I ’ m so sorry about yesterday . I shouldn ’ t have yelled at you in front of everyone . 
 I don ’ t know what happened to me . I just lost it . 
 Yes , you ’ re right . Good night . 
 I'm terribly sorry to be so late . I had an article ... 
 I can't afford to . 
 Yes , thanks.Before I start , I'd like to thank Professor Smith for all his help in giving me unlimited access to his research materials . 
 Sorry , I'll try to speak louder . 
 Nothing important . I've been working overtime lately . 
 12 hours , including 5 hours overtime . 
 I don't care . I need money . 
 Yes , I think so . When I work overtime I'm paid time and a half . 
 But jobs with a lot of overtime are quite limited . Employers usually don't like to pay for overtime if they can manage . 
 Which sports are popular in your country ? 
 Do many people like tennis ? 
 In my country , many people enjoy golf , but it is too expensive for some people . A few people like extreme sports , but I think the vast majority of people are afraid to try them . 
 I know loads of people who play it regularly . There are plenty of golf courses around the country . In the past , only a tiny number of people played . 
 There are plenty of rugby fans in my country too . 
 Yes ! Yes ! And yes ! Jared , of course I ’ ll marry you ! 
 Oh , Jared ! I can ’ t wait for our wedding ! I hope you don ’ t mind , but I ’ Ve already chosen a date ! Six months from now in the summer ! Melissa saw you buying the ring last month so I ’ Ve had plenty of time to start planning ! 
 Oh don ’ t worry , sweetie , I didn ’ t know when you were going to propose . It was still a nice surprise ! As I was saying , I ’ Ve got it all planned out . There ’ s almost nothing left to do ! I wrote up our guest list and we will have roughly four hundred guests attending . 
 No need to sweat it . My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding , which is going to be low-budget anyway . So roughly four hundred people , which means that the hall at Northwoods Heights will be our reception venue . I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents ’ church and my uncle of course would be officiating . We ’ ll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling . The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer . My step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that . My cousin will be the official photographer . I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo . Did you know that she ’ s going to be a professional opera singer ? 
 And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we ’ ll get the Youth Group to serve us . I was thinking that your friend ’ s band could be our entertainment for the night . though they might have to tone it down a bit . Or we could hire a DJ . Your sister ’ s husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings . what ’ s their name again ? I was thinking that we could have an island paradise-themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine . And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we ’ ll make our toasts ! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors ? Who else am I missing ? Oh , your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake ! 
 See ? It ’ s going to be wonderful ! Oh this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of . 
 No . 164 in lane 3 achieved 11 ' 16 in the 100 meter dash . Isn't that something ? 
 He won the first place ! 
 When is your vacation going to start ? 
 Oh , that's only a few days from now ! How many weeks are you going to be taking ? 
 Where are you going now . 
 Have you made your hotel reservation yet ? 
 You're lucky . It's hard to find a place to stay at the beach in August 
 What a hot day ! 
 Where are you going this summer vacation ? 
 Do you want to go to the beach there ? 
 The same to you . 
 I don't think I'm getting better . 
 I'm still not sure whether I can recover from it . 
 What happened ? 
 That's great . I thought you said you didn't get the job . 
 I bet . That's great news . I'm very happy for you . 
 Sounds good . 
 Coffee , please . 
 Yes , of course . I can't go through a day without coffee in the morning . 
 I totally disagree . The other day I read in a book that a number of recent studies suggest that it can be a highly beneficial drink . Researchers have found strong evidence that coffee reduces the risk of several serious aimed 3 ' including diabetes , heart disease and cirrhosis of the liver . 
 I don't think so . Coffee helps me wake up , keep alert , and improve my short term memory . 
 Maybe you are right to some extent . 
 Maybe I could have a try . 
 OK . What time ? 
 It's 60 yuan , please . 
 Sure . That'll be 40 yuan , please . 
 Whoa . Now I'm awake ! Zina has a secret admirer . 
 I know what you mean . I can't stand computer geeks . 
 Who do you think it is ? 
 No , I am the only child in my family . 
 Do they live with you and your parents ? 
 I don't know how to deal with Jack . He is indeed a trouble maker . He has loused up my business several times . 
 Yeah . 
 Mike , what are you doing tonight ? 
 I don't feel like drinking tonight . I'm gonna hang out at YY's . 
 Yeah , but it's expensive . Nah , I'm going to YY's . 
 They ' Ve just renovated the place . You may be surprised . 
 Quite a difference , huh ? 
 Ah hah.Thought you were't drinking . 
 Hey , Rose , how are you feeling ? 
 Oh , Look at the baby.It ' s so beautiful.Is it a boy or a girl ? 
 Can I hold it for a moment ? 
 Oh , how adorable ! She's got your eyes . 
 When are you returning home ? 
 You can use some time off.You ' Ve been working too hard anyway . 
 Cookies ? You just ate an hour ago . 
 Well , why don't you have some fruit instead ? 
 Are you cold ? 
 I wonder if we can change the temperature . 
 There must be buttons . How do they turn it on and off ? 
 Well , they have it too cold in here . I want to be warmer . I won't be able to sleep . 
 What did they say about the air conditioning ? 
 That's stupid . How can I sleep in this ? 
 hello ! How are you today ? 
 it ’ s not use worrying about it now . you ’ Ve done test and you can ’ t change any of your answers . 
 let ’ s go and get a coffee together . That will help you to wake up again ! 
 oh , you know me . I ’ m always happy ! If I think I ’ m getting into a bad mood , I call some friends and socialize or have a chat . 
 I hate spending too much time at home . I get bored of it really quickly . I ’ m always excited about going out to party or other social event and meeting people . 
 Hey , Lily , what are you doing ? 
 You mean the boy you met on MSN ? 
 You must be joking . You can't fall in love with someone you've never met ! 
 I think it's just a crush . You can't be serious . 
 Did you tell him ? 
 You shouldn't take it too seriously . It might be a lie . 
 I think you should enlarge your circle of real life friends , and then the right person will come along . 
 I know what you mean , Carol . I ’ Ve had nothing but trouble with it . They say it ’ s supposed to be easy ! 
 Sure . Why don ’ t you sit down for a minute ? You haven ’ t taken a rest all morning . 
 No , I first came here 1995 . 
 Well , I am from Canada . Actually . 
 That ' ok . That's happens all the time . 
 How do you know that ? 
 Oh , I see . But I think you are making a fuss . They will make it up . Bet it . 
 Well , if you want to look professional , serious and more conservative , a blue dress , white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice . But sometimes , very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . It depends on the company ’ s dress code . 
 Whatever you choose , make sure they are neat and clean . 
 They're my family 
 Yes , I'm the third child . 
 Yes , I'm going to the cinema , dad . 
 Oh , I won't be back so early . The film will be over at nine . Can I have the key to the bicycle ? 
 Oh , dad , I'm not a child . I'm 17 already . I'll come back as soon as the film is over . 
 I will . Thank you , dad . 
 Speaking . 
 Of course . How're you ? 
 I'm sorry , Karen , but I can't . I have to work late this Thursday . 
 Yeah . I really like Lesley . 
 Well , I can't make it on Friday either , but I'm free on Saturday night . What time does it start ? 
 That sounds perfect.And let's go out for coffee after the show . 
 See you at seven fifteen , Saturday . 
 Sure . Do you want to go first , Sally ? 
 OK , here's your question What movie won the 1996 Oscar for Best Picture ? 
 Well , along with Jurassic Park ! Nice going , you got the right answer . 
 Really ? 
 Sounds great . 
 How nice . 
 Good . 
 Oh yeah , it was great ! He took me to an Italian restaurant and we had an amazing conversation . I told him about how many kids I want , and how my parents will be so excited to meet him . 
 Yeah ! I called him after I got home to arrange our next date , but unfortunately his grandma is sick so he has been busy every night visiting her in the hospital . 
 Yeah , I think so . Oh , by the way , I need to ask you something . 
 Could I get back the sweater you borrowed ? 
 My boots ? Er ... Sure , ok . 
 Not if you pay for it . For example , if you download from iTunes and pay with your credit card , it's legal . 
 Awesome . You'll see that they are really catchy . 
 Not at all . I ’ m an agnostic . Do you ? 
 I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one . 
 I ’ m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong . 
 Religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics . 
 Cindy , I have this room to myself ? 
 It's twice as big as my room in Taiwan ! 
 I think I'm going to like it here . 
 Wow , I have my own bathroom ! 
 We share the same bathroom , in other words . 
 Pretty good . Mary , I was wondering if you would like to come to a party on Friday night ? 
 Fine . It will be at my house . Do you know how to get there ? 
 I can do that . Do you have anyone that you would like to bring with you to the party ? 
 Oh yeah , I remember Jake . That would be fine . 
 Just bring along whatever it is that you and Jake would like to drink . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Elvin Dixon . Who are you ? 
 Easy stuff . But thanks . And the admiration is mutual . 
 You're selling invoking subscriptions like nobody's business . And we don't even have a working demo yet . 
 I wish you would not be so selfish . 
 But you should at least consider your son's future . 
 We ’ re going to the movies . Will you join us ? 
 Why not ? 
 Then would you like to have lunch with us ? 
 Would you like me to give you a lift ? 
 Come on . It ’ s no trouble at all . 
 Way to go ! It seems beautiful and very delicious . 
 Is this the A housing office ? 
 I was hoping to get into something on campus , but my friend told me that everything is full . 
 Please . And in the mean time , can I look at apartments available in the area from this office ? 
 Who do I talk to if I want I to see some of them ? 
 Hello , let me introduce myself . I'm your neighbor . My name is Shirley . 
 Nice to meet you , too . 
 Here is a little gift for your family . It's a calendar with all the community events on it . I hope it can be helpful . 
 Since we are neighbors , if you need any help or anything , please come to me . 
 Oh , don't worry about that here . There are security guards on duty 24 hours a day and they patrol all over the neighborhood . You know , they are all very strong . 
 Of course . There is a Carrefour near the neighborhood . I'll show you there if you want to . 
 By the way , a party will be held for new neighbors the day after tomorrow . I hope I can see you there . 
 Dave , wake up . 
 It's seven-thirty . I want to know who left this note on my desk . 
 It's a little green post-it note , stuck right in the middle of my computer screen . 
 It says , Zina , I like how you rhumba . An admirer . 
 Don ’ t worry . Everyone knows you ’ re getting your feet wet . I ’ ll show you how . I bet you ’ ll be proficient at this in five minutes . 
 Relax . I can hold my own . Now , point your skis toward the bottom of the hill . Easy does it ! 
 Here . I ’ ll just give you a little push ... 
 There . Now , wasn ’ t that fun ? As soon as you get a second burst of energy , we ’ ll ... 
 Are you busy next Saturday ? 
 I need to get a costume for a fancy dress party , and I reply don't know what to get . Will you come shopping with me ? 
 One of the girls in my office . 
 There is no specie occasion . She just likes to organize parties from time to time . This time it is a country theme . 
 Well where am I going to get that sort of costume ? 
 Oh good . 
 What do you think of when you're praying ? 
 Does that help you faith ? 
 Tom ! How are you ? We missed you at the party last night . Are you OK ? 
 Come on.We ’ Ve been through this already ! Look , I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here , but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it . 
 Yeah , it can get pretty lonely over the holidays . When I first got here , I ’ d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home . I almost let it get to me , but then I started going out , keeping myself busy and before I knew it , I was used to to it . 
 OK . how does this sound . let ’ s get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight . I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there ! 
 Not at all ! It be fun ! It will be like a boys ’ night out ... well kinda ... 
 Excuse me ? Is this where I register ? I ’ d like to sign up for my courses for next semester . 
 Here you are . 
 Yes . I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology . 
 Yeah . Here ’ s my list . I ’ m not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them though . 
 Oh yeah ! Almost forgot ! I need to take fundamental linguistics , consumer psychology and neuroanatomy . 
 I used to be down on the sales people until I saw her in action . 
 Most salespeople seem like half-brains . Zina's definitely an exception . 
 Yeah , I'm not too worried about Vince , but I'd hate to face Zina if we don't deliver ... 
 Well , that's life . 
 Sorry , I was delayed by something and stuck in traffic . 
 Nope . I guess something might have come up . 
 I don't know . I hope it's nothing serious . 
 Oh ? What happened ? 
 Is she fine now ? 
 Oh , poor Alan ! His sister is the only one he has left since his parents died last year . 
 Actually , my mother made it from scratch . 
 Sure . Take a seat , please . What would you like to know ? 
 A Bachelor is awarded to a student who successfully completes over 120 units , including general and specific requirements , for his or her undergraduate major and elective courses . 
 Normally it can be completed in four years . 
 Don ’ t say things like this . Please be confident . I think you still have the chance to win her love , unless you don ’ t love her anymore . 
 In some way , she is more modern . 
 If you really think so , in my opinion you should give up this feeling completely . 
 My watch says half past five . 
 Oh yeah . It loses only a few seconds in the whole month . 
 Thanks for the loan . 
 I haven't danced for a long time . 
 We must go to a dance soon , or we'll forget how to dance . 
 I've been studying hard for my examinations . And you ? 
 Why have you been learning Japanese ? Why not English ? 
 Well , we'll both have to start learning all the new dances . 
 A good idea . They can teach elephants to dance nowadays perhaps there's hope for us ! 
 I saw a lot of teenagers when Alan and I were there yesterday . 
 Speaking of that trip , Alan bought a shirt at a department store , but the sleeves are too long . Do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ? 
 Isn ’ t that complicated ? 
 We ? Do you want to go with me ? 
 What do you do there ... hang around , like the kids ? 
 Well , he's very tall and handsome . 
 He has big blue eyes and long blonde hair . 
 Down to his shoulders . It's beautiful , like gold . 
 He's a very creative painter . His paintings sell well . 
 He's quite a patient teacher , too . 
 You're going to like him . Everybody says he's a nice guy . 
 Wow ! I'm so happy for you . 
 Whoa , whoa , take it easy , relax . Geez , you ’ re sweating like a pig ! What ’ s going on ? 
 What are you talking about ? It wasn ’ t more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family ! 
 Let ’ s think this through . First of all , you cannot leave Amy at the altar . Not only will she be humiliated and kill you , but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams ! Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this ? Second of all , you are just getting cold feet . You know deep down inside that you want to marry her , so cut the crap and do it ! 
 Great ! Phew ! That was a close one ! You had me going there for a minute I thought I was gonna have to slap some sense into you . 
 Was it quite special ? 
 Did you hurry back to the bedroom ? 
 Oh , your classmates took you in . 
 You look great today . And so beautiful . I love your elegant haircut . 
 Hey Jack . Are you excited about starting work ? 
 What was more exciting , starting college or starting work ? 
 For me , I think starting school was more exciting . 
 It's different for everyone , but because I knew school was going to be so much fun , I really got excited about it . 
 That's a great attitude to have . I don't think you'll have any problems in the workforce . 
 So did you get in touch with your brother ? 
 Well , it'd be foolish to call the police . He probably just went away overnight . 
 Hi , Mark , did you catch the game last night ? 
 You didn ’ t hear ? Spain won , two to zero . 
 Yeah . The final is next week . You have to watch it . 
 Good ! They have expanded and are doing better than they were last quarter . It's nice to see some improvement for a change . 
 Yes , especially with so many of our executives going back and forth from here to Japan . The only problem is , they may have trouble when they go to open up business here . 
 They aren't too familiar with doing business outside of Japan . There are a lot of cultural differences to account for . 
 Have you ever been to Japan ? 
 Morning . 
 Fine , thank you . 
 Yeah . It ’ s pretty cold , alright . 
 No , I didn ’ t hear about that . 
 No , I don ’ t like football . 
 She ’ s my wife ! Oh , here ’ s my floor ! Nice talking to you . Goodbye . 
 That ’ s okay , I ’ ll take the stairs ! 
 Yes . We just had a basketball match with Class Two . 
 They did . 
 Seventy to sixty-seven . 
 Oh , I thought I did a good job . 
 Anyway , I have to face the music this time . 
 I ’ m returning a book . 
 I also need to check out this video . 
 Just the video . 
 I have it right here . 
 I will . 
 I get it . Thank you . 
 Everything's great . And you ? 
 No , I haven't had a chance to . But I have been watching a Chinese TV scries called " Chinese-Style Divorce " . 
 Yeah . I found it is so close to our life . 
 You said it . You know , the divorce rate has been on the rise in recent year . 
 I know a couple who divorced a week after getting married . 
 That's true . It's said the short-lived marriage is typical of the post - 80s ' generation . 
 Definitely.They don't take relationships and marriages very seriously . 
 I think , as the saying goes haste makes waste , it is the same with marriage . 
 My choice would always be tea . 
 Last year when I visited China . 
 Not cash . But if our launch goes well , my stock options will pay off , big time . 
 I don't have to worry about rent . I live right here . 
 Right here . Me and my PC . Home sweet home . 
 Sorry , I'll bring them to you right away . 
 We are short of staff today . 
 What's wrong ? 
 They were delivered this morning . 
 I've been looking forward to the new semester . 
 Hope so . 
 Really ? I hope we will do much better under her guidance . 
 I am considering going for the new job that was posted yesterday . 
 It may not be the best choice for me , but I am considering it . 
 I believe that this job would allow me to move up but might be a little boring for me . 
 Also , the matter of pay is also a consideration . 
 Yes , sometimes giving up a little to move forward is the best choice . 
 What do you do ? 
 How much do you make a month ? 
 I wish I could unsay the sharp words to him . He must hate me very much . 
 Really ? Oh , thank Goodness ! 
 Well , if not gymnastics , then mountain biking . 
 Since 1996 it has been . And I bet I'd be pretty good at it . I ride my mountain bike to work almost every day . 
 It ’ s quite an interesting place to live . The best thing to do in my city is go shopping . There are several indoor and outdoor markets , department stores and shopping malls . 
 Not really . Cars are not permitted in several parts of city centre , especially in the main shopping areas . The public transport system is pretty good . 
 There are restaurants with food from all over the world . We have a small china-town near the city centre . There are many Indian , Thai , and Italian restaurants all over the city centre . There are many sports events in my city . We have several sports venues for football , rugby , and cricket-even ice-skating and ice hockey . 
 There are several good clubs near the city centre . Many people in my city prefer something more ’ cultural ” , so we several theatres and venues for classical music concerts and operas . 
 It is . I hope you ’ ll have time to come for a visit soon . You really should come during the summer , when the weather is better and there ’ s more happening outdoors . 
 On the fourth Thursday of November . 
 People cook turkeys for Thanksgiving dinner . 
 Besides the turkeys , we'll also have other delicious food . Such as pumpkin pies , puddings , mashed potatoes , bread , a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables . 
 Great party , isn ’ t it ? 
 By the way , my name is Liu Wei . 
 What do you do , Susan ? 
 I work for the Bank of China , in the International Section . 
 Oh , please ! Don't be so old-fashioned ! It's totally safe . 
 All I did so far was make a bid on the Buddha . It was easy ! 
 Oh , come on ! I just gave them my e-mail , my address and my phone number . And my name , of course . 
 I'm tired of your cut-and-dried opinions . Who do you think you are ! 
 Why not ? 
 Where are you going ? 
 Again ? You just went last week ! You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! Honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ? 
 Why ? I don ’ t want to have nail polish or anything like that ! 
 Yeah , sounds like something I should definitely do . 
 Well ... alright . I guess I have a minute . 
 I've heard about it , but I don't really know about it . 
 What about beer ? 
 That's pretty cool . How much of a discount ? 
 And all these other things , pizza and movies for instance--how much of a discount do I get on that stuff ? 
 Alright , alright . Let me look at that pamphlet.Hmm . Alessio's Pizza Parlor . That's cool . I go there all the time.And Cosmo's Club . And 4 - D records . Alright . How much does it cost ? 
 Whoa ! That's expensive ! It should be cheaper . 
 Yeah , maybe . Alright . Give me an application form . 
 I'm just responding to Sue's letter . Do you want to help ? 
 that's kind of boring . Don't you want to tell them anything else ? 
 you've been promoted ? when did that happen ? 
 congratulations ! That's really exciting ! Let's get out a bottle of wine to celebrate ! 
 ah . That can wait . Your promotion is the best news I've heard in a long time ! 
 ok , you're right . I'll just tell them how round I am of you for getting a promotion and then I'll thank Sue for her kind letter . 
 that's thoughtful of you . 
 that's right ! I almost forgot about that . 
 we do balance each other out well . I guess we were really made for each other ! 
 I would like to return these books . 
 I dropped it , and the cover tore off . 
 How much ? 
 That ’ s not too bad . 
 Here ’ s the money for the book . 
 You are very welcome . 
 Why do you say so ? 
 Maybe all of us are the same . 
 I didn't sleep much last night . 
 You know Miao Li-my roommate , he bought a computer last month . He has turned his computer into an electronic playground . He plays football , rides horses , drives racing cars , and does a whole bunch of other games . Every night he keeps me up . 
 I usually get a lot of information on the computer and use E-mail to send messages to my friends . 
 Don't you think it's a sheer waste of both time and money ? 
 Yes . 
 In the summer it gets very hot.the temperature is often between 37 and 40 centigrade.when it is hot we often get rains.the winters are drier . 
 What are the temperatures in winter ? in my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees . 
 Yeah , we do . in the middle of summer there can be thunderstorms every day usually in the afternoon . i heard your city has a lot of fog , is that true ? 
 Yes , they are . like i said we have thunderstorms.but each one usually only last a few hours.then the skys are clear again . 
 My grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child.but my parents and i only see it outside of our city . 
 As you know , my city is on the coast.the water is also not clean.but people still go swimming all year around . i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot in sunny . 
 You did ? 
 What do you think now ? 
 But I still say Americans spend a lot more money on useless things than we Chinese do . 
 I am exhausted . I need some sleep . 
 I twisted and turned all night , and couldn ’ t sleep . I was worried about my mother ’ s health . 
 Fairly warm this morning , isn't it ? 
 Say , how about a walk along the river ? 
 How do you like other films starring Charlie Chaplin ? 
 You don't like the performance , do you ? 
 Lots of elderly people want peace and quiet in their old age , but young people want an unconstrained life . 
 What if old people are in poor health and need to be looked after ? 
 When I ’ m old , I ’ ll also be like that . 
 I know that's what I must do . 
 It is just too much . Don ’ t you feel it is an exaggerating style to decorate offices in that way ? 
 Wow , I doubt that . 
 Oh yes I am . I have always wanted to go to the States . I love meeting new people and making new friends . 
 Well , there is one thing . 
 I am a little worried about my host family . You know , in the agreement , I have to do some cooking for them . 
 Well , I am just afraid they won't like my Chinese way of cooking . 
 Oh , let's hope so . 
 Well , I think this Star Wars episode is an excellent piece of work , but not as good as the previous ones . 
 Why do you think so ? 
 You are right . The special effects were amazing . And I like the fact that they created so many fantastic settings and otherworldly costumes , weapons and creatures . 
 Yeah ! It reminds me of the previous Star Wars scenes . 
 I thought the overall plot of the movie was very interesting , but I don't think the character development was that strong . 
 No , the casting is great and the actors were excellent . They just didn ’ t have a lot of funny or meaningful dialogues . The writing was also a little weak . 
 I liked him too . He is so cute ! You know , even though I was slightly disappointed , I can't wait for the next episode . I wonder when they ’ re going to start making it and when it ’ s scheduled for release ? 
 I hope so , too . 
 Okay , let's go ! 
 Well , it ’ s not like that . We just e-mail , it ’ s really nothing . On top of which I am definitely thinking about stopping because it ’ s getting ... 
 Confusing . But not , because it ’ s nothing . 
 Oh , listen , I can ’ t even remember . Ok , on my birthday , I wandered into over 30 rooms , for a joke , sort of and he was there , and we started chatting ... 
 Oh , books , and music , how much we both love New York . Harmless , harmless , meaningless . Bouquets of sharpened pencils . Oh . 
 Forget it . We don ’ t talk about anything personal , so I don ’ t know his name or what he does or where he lives exactly . So it ’ ll be really easy for me to stop seeing him , because I ’ m not ... 
 Why ? 
 It's July 7th . Chinese Valentine's Day ! 
 I thought you had trouble with Clive ! 
 Poor guy ! It's not fair . You forgot it too . 
 Wow ! Good timing . 
 Come on . Two is company . 
 It's Valentine's Day . Come on . Just go . 
 Yes , certainly . How can I recognize him ? 
 Is there anything else ? 
 How old is he ? 
 Well . I shouldn ’ t have any trouble recognizing him . What time does his flight arrive ? 
 Hi , Tony . You look unhappy . What's wrong ? 
 What happened ? 
 What on earth are you talking about ? 
 What were you thinking ? 
 But what you should do is study hard . 
 So long as you learn from your mistakes . 
 I'm fine , thanks . And you ? 
 Oh , nothing much really . And how is everything with you ? 
 What have you been doing ? 
 Really ? Good luck for them . 
 They're both very well , thanks . 
 I'm going to do some shopping . Why don't you come with me ? 
 It's been nice talking to you . 
 Good evening . Welcome to our program . 
 Would you tell us your name , please ? 
 Glad to meet you , Ms.Baker . 
 Where are you from , Ms.Baker ? 
 What do you do for a living ? 
 Thank you for coming , Ms.baker . 
 What ? You ’ re tired ? But we just started about twenty minutes ago . 
 What ’ s the matter ? Didn ’ t you sleep well last night ? 
 Then when did you go to sleep ? 
 When ? 
 Oh , Susie . Didn ’ t I tell you over and over again that you wouldn ’ t be able to climb the mountain unless you got enough sleep ? 
 This is a one-day trip . We ’ ll have to keep going and try to reach the top by noon or give up right now and go home . Which one do you choose ? 
 So , make up your mind quickly . Whether to keep going or give up . 
 Man , that sunset is beautiful . I ’ Ve never seen one so red . 
 Really ? 
 I never knew that . 
 Well , we ’ Ve already done our part . 
 Don ’ t worry . I ’ m getting more sleep these days . The baby ’ s finally growing up a little more . 
 Happy New Year , Jim ! 
 Yeah , I'm going to the Temple Fair with my family . 
 Henry , don ’ t get out of doing housework . 
 You mean that is my business . 
 I ’ m your wife , not a housewife . I have my own work . 
 Darling , I have news for you . Bobby and his wife , Evelyn , are going to have a baby soon . 
 Actually they ’ re expecting the baby to come on my birthday . 
 In fact , they ’ re both very excited about the coming baby . Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like , since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese . 
 It ’ s still a mystery . Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant . But she begins to take her maternity leave now . 
 I want to know how to buy something from this machine . 
 I want to buy one of those snack things . 
 I'm clear so far . 
 It won't go in ! 
 Yes , next step . 
 They're totally unreliable . 
 Hello , Lily . 
 When I come late , there ’ s usually nothing left . 
 I ’ ll have the leg of lamb . 
 How may I help you ? 
 Have you checked the database ? 
 Was it on the shelf ? 
 Maybe someone took it . 
 I ’ m sure we will . 
 I sure will . 
 do you have internet in your room ? 
 really ? What do you usually do online ? 
 I never chatted online before . What's it like . 
 really ? Who do you chat with ? 
 that's amazing . I will install an online messenger program when I get home . 
 don't worry . 
 I am reading a book about money management . 
 Everyone wants to earn a lot of money . Don't you think so ? What's more , I am interested in money management . 
 Oh , I see . But a proverb says " Money makes the mare go . " I think it will be better if you have more money . 
 Thank you for your caring . I will . 
 It's the 17th week now , isn't it ? 
 Oh , the final exam is coming soon . I feel a little bit nervous . 
 No , I haven't began my preparations . 
 Great . You can help me a lot with English . 
 No problem . 
 Pity I haven't . If I can afford it , I'll certainly take a trip abroad . 
 How about going to italy next summer vacation ? 
 You are blue in the face , arn't you ? 
 But supposing your son killed like the fish , what do you think then ? 
 So beat the cat , but don't kill it . 
 Oh , thank you so much . 
 I really appreciated it . 
 It was so kind of you . 
 You ’ re a real friend in need . 
 Sounds good . 
 Just a minute . It's ten to nine by my watch . 
 What's the hurry ? 
 You've plenty of time yet . The railway station is very close . It won't take more than twenty minutes to get there . 
 Yes , I'm still working there . But I really find my job boring . I'd like to change my job . 
 I think I'm quite fit for a driver . 
 I don't care . 
 I haven't told them . Maybe I'll make them know after the vacation . 
 no . please sit down . 
 are you also going to Beijing ? 
 I'm taking a vacation to visit a friend there . Have you ever been there before ? 
 really ? What did you think ? 
 was it that crowded ? 
 oh , maybe I can take the bus or even rent a car . 
 thank you very much ! 
 Yes I do , usually . 
 I don't like spending time on commercials.There ' re too many commercials on TV . 
 But the semester just started ? Why the rush ? 
 How often do you meet ? 
 What days , do you know ? 
 Okay , count me in . 
 His girlfriend dumped him , and he is tearing his heart out over her . 
 Love is blind , you know . 
 Nothing ' doing . 
 I haven't decided yet . What about you , Andy ? 
 But I don't know how to play basketball . 
 You ’ re all set now ? 
 Really , it was nothing . 
 I was happy to help . 
 Don ’ t mention it . 
 Hi , Jason ! 
 With the greatest pleasure ! Where is the concert held this evening ? 
 What is on the program ? 
 Hah ! OK . Let ’ s go together ! 
 See you then . 
 So am I . 
 Of course not . 
 Laura . 
 I don ’ t think it ’ s very nice . And my father doesn ’ t like it . But my mother likes it very much . So we often come here . 
 Well , we come here almost every month . 
 It ’ s my mother . She ’ s fond of swimming . And the man beside her is my father . 
 No , I hate swimming . I prefer playing tennis . 
 Oh , you may call him Uncle , or Henry . 
 He's checking bags.He ' s an official in the customs . 
 We went to Malaysia and Thailand . 
 Well . We went bungee jumping when we were in Malaysia . 
 A little , but the rush was worth it . 
 We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us . 
 Yeah , It was scary but exhilarating . 
 Yes , the weather sure is nice today . 
 That sounds like a good idea.The sky is clear , the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot . 
 Hey , this spot in the shade looks really comfortable . 
 I don't think so . I say the weather report last night , and it said the weather should be fine all day . 
 Did you go to the movie yesterday ? 
 What did you think of it ? 
 I think it is the worst one I have ever seen . 
 I can't think the same . 
 I couldn't agree with you . 
 Really ? Who did you hear that from ? 
 Do you have the notes from last week's class ? 
 I couldn't make it . 
 I was sick . 
 Are these all of them ? 
 Thanks a bunch . 
 Excuse me , Professor . I think there might be an error in my test score . 
 I think that the percentage is incorrect . 
 Sure , let's do it . 
 I don't see any mistakes . 
 Yes , let's total it . 
 Yes , you're right . 
 A new film is on.Have you ever seen it ? 
 It's a feature film . 
 Mary , I heard you moved again . 
 You mean noise ? How could it be ? 
 What do you think of your teacher ? 
 And I hear he gives very good lectures . 
 What do you want to do tomorrow night ? 
 It's Friday . We should go party . 
 Okay . Stay home Sunday . But Friday we should go out dancing . 
 Yes ? Why not ? 
 They aren't alcoholic ! 
 So where should we go ? 
 You always want to go to the Latin Club . I don't know those dance steps . I'd rather go to the New Bar . 
 It's not all techno music . It's not a special techno night . 
 It's fine with me if we go to the Latin Club . I like Latin Music.The only thing I never want to do again is listen to country rock.What was that bar called ? 
 No . It was that friend of yours , Melissa.Her and all her lousy country music Cds . Yecch ! 
 Yes . You have to teach me the samba , and the tango , and whatever else they do . 
 Maybe . 
 Definitely . I need to have enough time to have a rest on this weekend . We worked like bees in the whole working days . 
 Let me think . Oh , awful ! I still have not finished the chart which was assigned by Mr . Wharton on Friday . So that task will make my busy . 
 So what ? 
 20/350 . 
 Oh , yes , it is . 
 You'll find out when we're in the woods and you have to go to the bathroom ... 
 Let's just say I'll have it easy ... 
 Oh , yes ? 
 Mmm . 
 Really ? 
 Oh , yeah , that's embarrassing when that happens . 
 You look tired . Did you sleep well last night ? 
 Go easy . Overwork is bad for your health . 
 Terrible . 
 I ’ Ve got a fever and really a bad headache . 
 I ’ Ve already tried some but it didn ’ t help . 
 Yeah , I guess I should . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Did you hear the news ? Two of our major suppliers , Murphy Music and U-Tunes are merging ! If they are conglomerated into one company into one company , it would have some serious affects on our market strategy . 
 I read it myself on the financial page.They ' re really going to join together . U-Tunes was bought out by Murphy's , they will take over the company as of next month . 
 I guess they must have figured it would be easier to merge than to keep up the cutthroat competition.If you can't beat'em , join'em . 
 Of course , I'd like to . 
 What is in it ? 
 Do you get along with your roommates ? 
 Which floor are you on ? 
 Oh , you can climb the stairs as a workout . 
 Wow , your roommates are cleaning the room . 
 I like hitchhiking.will you go with me ? 
 It's a pity.Say , how about a place near enough ? 
 New England . 
 Excuse me . Nature calls . 
 Julia , will you be my wife ? 
 Please , Julia , I have made proposal to you five times . I really want to share the rest of my life with you . 
 Julia , I really love you . I hope I can stay with you no matter you are happy or sad in future . 
 So , will you marry me ? 
 Yeah , it's really cute . But why a monkey suit ? Is Hello Kitty having an identity complex ? 
 You were born in the year of the monkey ? 
 Not at all ! That explains everything ! 
 Let me see . It's five minutes to eleven . 
 I think so . I see it by the radio this morning . 
 It ’ s hard to say . Language isn ’ t like other studies . 
 I ’ m not kidding . Learning a language is a question of forming language habits and that takes time . 
 No . You just have to stay here long enough to get some orientation . Then you go on practicing and learning outside . A lot of learning depends on your personal motivation . 
 You said it . 
 You can say that again . The sunny shining and there ’ s pleasant raise . it ’ s so lovely 
 That ’ s correct . we have four seasons of spring 
 What makes you say that ? 
 But everything has been so easy . 
 Yeah , you never look at the positive side of things . 
 Excuse me , is this seat taken ? 
 You work upstair , right ? I think I have seen you before . I'm Karren , Karren Brown . 
 Happy to know you , Tim . 
 How can you be so sure ? You haven ’ t been together with her , have you ? 
 Then try it yourself . 
 I'd be glad to tell you what I think . 
 If I were you , I would change the beginning . You should write about your education first because we like to judge a man by his abilities . 
 I think it's too short . You'd better say something about your work experience . 
 Very good . But you should talk about your family , too . 
 I see you have bought the latest copy of beauty and fashion . Are there any interesting articles in it ? 
 I like to take the tests that they print in this magazine . 
 You know . Tests like how jealous are you ? and are you a fashion victim ? 
 Of course not , but sometimes the results make you think about yourself and what you do . According to the jealousy test , I ’ m quite a jealous type of person . Perhaps I need to control my jealousy . 
 If I can improve my vertical jump a few more inches , I think beach volleyball might be my ticket . 
 It's a beautiful sport , isn't it ? 
 OK , OK . Enough already . We'd better hustle . The contest starts in five minutes . 
 I'm sorry , but I have an appointment this evening.How about tomorrow evening ? 
 How is night life in Beijing ? 
 What do you suggest then ? 
 That's a great idea . Let's go ... Oh , the dance hall looks very nice and the music is wonderful . 
 That's great ! I love to dance to fast music . 
 Yes , disco dancing is my favorite.It ' s great fun and good exercise as well . 
 Now the band is playing a slow dance . 
 Sorry , I think I'Il sit out the next dance . 
 Just remember . The main thing right now is to make sure Stars.com is happy . 
 Elvin , please . Can I count on you to keep your cool for a week , or not ? 
 By the way , how's the nose ? Boy , that must have hurt . 
 I would like to check out a book . 
 I don ’ t have a library card . 
 Sure . That would be great . 
 Okay . Here you go . 
 Here you go . 
 Thanks . Now I ’ d like to check out this book . 
 Why not ! It ’ s a classic ; in fact , it ’ s one of my favorite novels . 
 Don ’ t judge a book by its cover . Do you Kwon what it ’ s about ? 
 First of all , it ’ s a romance novel , set in the early 19th century . 
 It ’ s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls . 
 Since he doesn ’ t have a son , he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . That way , all of his daughters will be cared for . 
 No , that ’ s the problem . Though they are well-off , once he dies , his house will go to his cousin . So , when he dies , the girls will have nothing . 
 So , are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ? 
 That ’ s probably because she wants you to read the book first . 
 How about this . When you finish the book . I ’ ll get the movie and watch it with you . 
 What is the matter with him ? 
 I feel he is as cold as charity to me . 
 Are there many idioms in English ? 
 Can you give us an example ? 
 What about the expression " goodbye " ? Is that an idiom ? 
 This is interesting , Ms.Parker . 
 Good morning , Miss White . You are half an hour early . 
 Come on over . This is your desk , and this is your time card . Be sure to clock in and out before and after you work . 
 One more thing , keep your desk neat . It's the rule . There is no exception , even the art designers have to keep their desks neat . 
 Not belong . You can use them as long as you work here . When you quit , you ’ ll have to return them to the company . 
 The operator will put all your calls through . You don't have to worry about that . 
 Of course you can . Every one has his personal matters to deal with more or less , but don't chat over the phone . What's more , don't let it hinder your work and the company's business . 
 When you settle down , I'll show you around and introduce you to the department managers . 
 Please come in , Mr.Jackson . 
 When in Rome , do as the Romans do , they say . 
 Roman is living in Rome , of course . And go to work by car , or bus , or on foot . 
 Certainly . 
 Not always . But they like good meal . 
 How can I go there to have a taste ? 
 it seems the department still has some money left in the budget . Do you have any suggestions how to use it before the budget is renewed ? 
 but we've done that many times . We want something fresh this time . 
 sounds like a good idea , but a band sounds too expensive . 
 I don ' t think so . I don't think people are going to like it if they have to pay to come . But we certainly can cut costs in other ways , such as make the party BYOB . 
 bring your own beverage . We can provide food , but people have to bring their own drinks . 
 maybe you have a point . How about having a party on a Friday afternoon ? We'll stop early , order some pizza , and serve drinks . There'll be music but no band . Having the party in the office will make 
 just don't understand why we have to take the subway . Look at this place . It's modern enough . But it's far from lively . 
 This isn't network , Frida . We are in San Francisco . 
 We haven't come here in business but for pleasure . We should go out exciting . What can you see in the subway ? Nothing ! 
 I can see people who are walking on the sidewalk . I can see cars driving on the streets . I can see the sun shining and beautiful flowers dancing in the wind . I can even smell the scent of flowers and the freshness of the air . 
 You miss the point ! We are not in a hurry to go anywhere . 
 I'm so glad you can finally see things in my way . Can we leave this dull place now ? 
 Just throw them away ! 
 What news ? 
 You know what we will get ? 
 What docking station ? 
 Another big step forward in saving on our office equipment , I don ’ t need a desktop anymore . A laptop is enough . 
 Go ahead . 
 Come on . Don ’ t hesitate . 
 I'd like to talk to you about my grades . 
 I am worried that I messed up on a test . 
 I think I am doing great , except for that one test ! 
 I think that I could study a little harder for tests . 
 Yes , I know . 
 Sandra is actually blue chipper . I don't think she could realize that she has married a fool for women . 
 I feel sorry for her . 
 good morning ! 
 I slept like a baby . I fell asleep right away last night , didn't wake up once , and didn't have nay nightmares ! 
 I feel much better , but I'm still worried about something . 
 well , I have to drive to school for a meeting this morning , and I'm going to end up getting stuck in rush-hour traffic . 
 for me , traffic jams are quite stressful , because I'm pretty impatient . How can I prevent myself from getting stressed if I get stuck in a traffic jam ? 
 Ok , I'll try that . 
 just one more thing . A school called me this morning to see if I could teach a few classes this weekend and I don't know what to do . 
 I'm supposed to work on a paper that'd due on Monday . 
 you're right . I probably should just work on my paper . Thanks ! 
 OK . Are you sure it's funny , though ? 
 OK . 
 I see . 
 Oh , that's funny ! 
 Oh , sorry . 
 A car door ? You mean just one car door ? 
 Well ... 
 I am always on the look out for such girls . 
 Mark is one of them . He has trouble with a girl who turned out to be a dead beat . 
 How about going to the theatre ? 
 Well , what do you like doing ? 
 I like painting , sailing , watching football and talking to you . 
 Do you want to go to an Exhibition ? There ’ s one of xinghai exhibitions hall tomorrow . 
 I find Beijing Opera is quite a bore . 
 It's just like listening to a language which you know nothing at all . 
 You are married to a foreigner , huh ? So what ’ s it like ? 
 Yeah , I know what you mean . The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples , not to mention two people from different cultures . 
 Oh , so he ’ s half Chinese and half American . That ’ s unusual . What languages does he speak , then ? 
 What does he look like ? Can people tell ? 
 Congratulations ! I heard that you are going to take a two-week training course in the headquarter . 
 Sure it is . This is a changing world . Does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? They are very useful for us . 
 Well , good for you . I hope you can get what you want from the training . 
 Hi ! Tom . Fancy seeing you here It's a nice party isn't it ? 
 Quite well . I got my MA degree two weeks ago . 
 When will the ceremony begin ? 
 No idea . 
 Hi , Francis . 
 Not bad . It seems you are super yogurt lover . You have so many in your cart . 
 Oh , I haven ’ t noticed that before . Maybe I will try next time . 
 Thank you . In fact , I am in a hurry . My wife is waiting for me at the parking lot . 
 Me too . Have a great day . 
 We export some coal to European countries , but our biggest exports is copper , which we export to Europe , north America , and China . 
 We import a little oil from Venezuela , but we are fairly self-sufficient . We import some iron and a lot of aluminium from neighbouring countries . 
 Yes , that ’ s right . So far , only small deposits have been found . Engineers in my country are focusing on drilling for oil . The government is keen to exploit our natural resources to get money to improve our country . 
 Yes . We need to put the money into long-term projects rather than wasting it on short-term ones . 
 It's ages since I went to see a film . 
 But now I would stay at home watching TV . 
 Dinner ? Where ? 
 What kind of food do they serve ? 
 Oh really ! That sounds lovely . 
 We'd better have a heart-to-heart talk with him . 
 Of course not . Let's talk to him in a very friendly way . 
 I didn't really like it . 
 I found it very disappointing . 
 I wasn't happy with it . 
 What's the matter with you then ? You look miserable . 
 What do you mean by us ? 
 That's right . 
 I ... I ... I miss my parents , also they miss me . 
 You mean I am groaned a few words ? 
 Everybody , I'd like to propose a toast to Mary Johnson , Teacher of the Year . She worked hard all year . She really deserved the honor . 
 Here's to you , Mary ! 
 He thought he could take Jimmy in , but you know , Jimmy is no fool . 
 So Jimmy just took him in instead and it cost him an arm and a leg . 
 Exactly . Herry is almost broken now . 
 Not really . I wasn thinking of maybe going to a movie . Do you want to go with me ? 
 Have you heard of Hot Fuzz ? 
 That's the one . It's an actioncomedy . What do you think ? 
 What do you have in mind ? 
 Isn't that the chick flick with Kate Hudson and Owen Wilson ? 
 Not really . Do you like biographical / drama films ? 
 Anne Hathaway is in a new movie called Becoming Jane which is based on a true story about Jane Austen . 
 It's on at 8 pm at the Phoenix Theatres . I have a membership there , so I can book the tickets ahead of time . 
 Sounds good . I'll see you then ! 
 He has no sense . 
 But Joe won't you . 
 Not much . Joann . Do you want to hang out ? 
 Me , too . What would you like to do ? 
 I have , actually . How about the movie , Million Dollar Baby with Clint Eastwood ? 
 We could , but it looks like it ’ s going to rain soon . 
 I ’ d really rather not . I ’ ll be too tempted to buy something that I can ’ t afford ! 
 I don ’ t know . Do you want to go bowling at the new bowling alley on 1st street ? 
 Let ’ s see . Do you want to go to a bar and sing some karaoke ? 
 Doesn ’ t sound like that ’ s be fun , then . Do you want to come here ? 
 Goodness , we ’ re not having much luck here , are we ? 
 No , but I could take the bus . 
 That sounds great ! Have you eaten ? 
 Perfect . Are you prepared to give me all your money ? 
 Oh , right . I suppose so . As long as you promise to lose ! 
 See you soon . 
 Is this your new teacher ? 
 Is she short ? 
 What color are her eyes ? 
 What color is her hair ? 
 And how old is she ? 
 What's the matter with you ? You look so upset and tired . 
 Oh , that's really tough . 
 I can understand . By the way , is there anyway I can help ? 
 Oh , that's so great , bless you ! if you need me , I'll always be there . 
 I hear your daughter graduated from high school as the valedictorian . 
 Where is she going to college ? 
 Really ? That's the icing on the cake . Congratulation again ! 
 Where are you going for your holidays , Charles ? 
 Good gracious ! You certainly are lucky . How are you going there ? 
 I once went to Singapore by air . It was very exciting-but never again . 
 For a short time . One of the engines caught fire . 
 He put it out and flew back to the airport . Then he asked the people at the airport where the emergency runway was . 
 Yes , we did . But I shall never fly again . 
 Yes . To be frank , I really love him to death . 
 Why do you say that ? 
 You really think so ? 
 I sure hope so . 
 I think you must have heard wrong.The truth is we are going to be taken over by Trusten.We are being bought out , and our company will be merging with our largest competitor.It ' s not good news at all ... 
 Probably.The new owners will be coming to start alignment meetings nextweek.One of the big question is what to call the new conglomerate company . 
 It's not only the name of our company that will change ... I expect that after this acquisition , there'll be a ton of things up in the air . 
 I'd like to , but I've got to write a term paper . It will be due by this Thursday . 
 I know it is no good for my health if I am staying in the classroom all day . But how about my paper ? 
 I'm terribly sorry I can't go with you . Shall we find some other time ? 
 Yes , all of us have naps . 
 No , not at all . 
 Pretty good . How's your business going , Kevin ? 
 What do you think of this suit ? Do I look good or what ? 
 Didn't they say we're going to the Ritz ? 
 In that case , let me make a quick change into my street clothes . 
 Ta da ! Let's go to the Ritz ! 
 One family skeleton of my family was that my younger brother has an axe to grind . 
 He began to be interested in finance because he thought he would be able to inherit the family ’ s fortune . 
 Did you hear peter just retired ? 
 He is not young as he looks . I think he's almost sixty . 
 You really look familiar . 
 My name is Phillip Hammer . I think we are related . Who is your dad ? 
 That's my uncle . You're my cousin ! Hi cousin ! 
 It really is . Do you have time to eat dinner and catch up ? 
 I plan to buy a car this year . 
 I'm going to work in holidays and pay by installments . 
 It's very dark in here.Will you turn on the light ? 
 Then , turn on the lamp , please . 
 It's there by the window . 
 I ’ m looking forward to seeing Westminster abbey , where many historic figures are buried , like Isaac Newton , the great mathematician and Winston Churchill , the great wartime leader . 
 Women have often played an important role in british history . Queen Elizabeth I built a navy strong enough to fight off the Spanish armada in 1588 . more recently , Margaret thatcher transformed british 
 There ’ s a lot to see there . Perhaps we should go tomorrow . 
 I ’ Ve seen them before . They ’ re quite incredible . If you want to see historical figures in London , there ’ s one place you have to go . 
 There you can see british leaders , entertainers , criminals , and royalty . 
 Where is my contract ? 
 I hear Jean married a business tycoon . 
 But I don't think she really loves him . 
 If I were her , I wouldn't marry a man I don't really love . 
 There's a concert in Capital Theatre this Sunday . 
 Look , I have two tickets.Will you go with me ? 
 Have you heard about Anlesen David ? 
 No , they got engaged . 
 Well , my dear . I didn't believe either.But got it straight form the horse's mouth.Davi called me this morning . 
 Last weekend , while they were on the Sik trip . 
 Next june . 
 Ted is so scared by dogs that he shakes in his shoes whenever he sees one . 
 No wonder . 
 That's right . They always talk about a need for new , progressive tactics , but they haven't done anything to stimulate new jobs . 
 The worst part is that the inflation hurts the poor more than the rich . It also leads to more unemployment in the long run . I don't know what a good solution would be to make the economy more vibrant again ... 
 You have a nice apartment . 
 She must have done a lot of work on it . 
 I tried to ask the bank teller why it changed , but she didn't speak English well enough.So I decided to go to the magazine shop . The one around the corner.And I bought an American newspaper . 
 It seems that yesterday the Mexican government declared wouldn't pay back the loans it got from the World Bank.The government declared a default on the loans . 
 I know . The economy here is having serious problems.But because the government declared a default , the currency value went way down . 
 Yes , it's an amazing drop . 
 Yes , it's very good . We suddenly have twice as much money to spend here.Our hotel is now half as expensive as when we got here ! Isn't that strange ? 
 What ? 
 Why not ? We should do it . Because now we can afford it . 
 Yeah . I like it , Dad . 
 Really ? 
 Why don't you ask your husband to help you with it ? 
 I ’ m itching for moving ! 
 It ’ s so wet and dark , I ’ m just fed up . 
 That's right . But feeling sorry for someone is one thing , and sticking to our principles is another . We must make a clear cut between them . 
 I ’ m so excited about Chinese New Year ! When do I get to visit Grandma ? Grandma makes the best dumplings in the world ! 
 Of course I miss Grandma , too . I bet she ’ s gonna teach me how to play Mahjong ! Hey , Dad , are you going to buy me firecrackers this year ? We ’ re going to have the best fireworks ! I ’ m really looking forward to lighting them ! 
 No , fireworks are awesome ! 
 I was scared because ... because I saw a bug . That ’ s all . 
 Oh , and I can ’ t wait to watch the dragon dance ! Dad , can I sit on your shoulders this time ? 
 Well , I ... anyways , I was just thinking of the red envelopes . I wanna make a list of all the things I ’ m gonna buy with my red envelope money ! I can ’ t wait ! I ’ m gonna have so much money ! Mom , can I get a pen and a piece of paper ? I want a new transformer , no , two transformers ... the Optimums Prime , and ... maybe the wheeljack ? I ’ ll get a PSP game , ahahah , and I ’ ll buy the entire class lunch at MacDonald ’ s ... 
 Well , I have them in my bag . I'Il put them on right away ! 
 Thanks ! 
 No , I haven't . I've tried hard to remember and I'm quite sure I've memorized the rhythm correctly . 
 What a brilliant smile ! 
 He must be very easy-going . 
 My goodness.She is thirty seconds faster than the world records in five thousand meters race . 
 A chinese girl have broken the world record in the Olympic Games 
 You have to . It's sure . 
 What's the matter ? You don't look well . 
 What about ? 
 Oh , is that all ? 
 Don't worry about it . Try to look on the bright sight of things . 
 I think most people treat animals well , but we are often cruel to animals . When we raise animals for food , the conditions they live in are often poor . 
 What would you do with all the animals ? You couldn ’ t just let them go . Besides , some people would still hunt them . Meat has become an integral part of our diet . 
 That ’ s true . I think zoo are a good idea , because they allow people to get close to animals . I think it ’ s good for kids to see wild animals . 
 I read that the number of animals being used in experiments is falling dramatically as new techniques are being introduced . 
 Sometimes you read about people who have been cruel to pets or other animals , but those stories are rare . 
 Yes , I have . They do an excellent job . 
 Yes , I've been thinking about visiting you . I hope to get some advice from you . 
 My field is electronic engineering . Which country do you think I should go ? 
 Which university should I apply to ? 
 Oh , I see . Thank you very much . 
 Great ! 
 We go way back.We ' Ve known each other since we were toddlers . 
 Yeah , We're buddy-buddy still . 
 Well , he is , but he can be conniving at times . 
 Well , I know that he would never stab me in the back.But I've seen him double cross other people . 
 Don't get me wrong , I'm not saying he's like that all the time . 
 Well , I think you should decide for yourself . 
 Okay , Okay.You can trust him . I was just trying to give you a hard time . 
 Actually , he's the most dependable person I know , and he would never turn on anyone . 
 Oh , it seems there is nothing that evening . 
 I'd like to , where ? 
 When ? 
 I'll go in time , thank you . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Just a second . I'll see if I can find them for you . 
 Here you are . You must return them within a month . 
 You can come in and renew them unless someone else has reserved them . 
 No trouble at all . So long . 
 Yeah , I've been working so much overtime lately . 
 My boss gave me a big project . I had to have it finished by this morning . It was so difficult . 
 I know , but hard work pays off . You know . 
 Maybe now I'll get that promotion I was hoping for . 
 I like it . It's a beautiful country . 
 The best island of Korea-Jizhou island . 
 Attractive scenery , pleasant climate , these make it charming . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Yes , you are right . 
 Dress casually . 
 I am just casting pearls before swine . 
 Yes , I saw one . Believe me . 
 I haven't met the Smiths for a long time . 
 Why ? 
 Did you go camping last Saturday ? 
 How many members were in your party in all ? 
 Did you get caught in the bad storm ? 
 Thanks for the advice , Mr . Macmillan . I'll keep it in mind . I had better head off though . I ’ m meeting my husband for dinner . 
 Thanks , sir . You too . Drive safely , I hear there ’ s a lot ice on the roads . 
 Tomorrow I'll take you to some places that I'm sure you will have interest in . 
 They are the Folk Antique Handicrafts and Collectibles Exhibition Halls . 
 Well . there're actually over 200 kinds of folk collections in this city . That's half the collections of antique objects in China . There's one exhibition half for multiple collection , and several individual display rooms for private collectors . 
 No hurry ! I'II tell you now , The collections include ancient cases and caskets , tea sets , abacuses , precious sea shells and conches , drama costumes , agates , ancient coins , fans , mini-musical instruments , root-carving , rare stones and rocks , model ships , model cars ... 
 The show will be starting in a few minutes . We'd better go in and find our seats . 
 That's right . This entrance is for even numbers . That entrance over there is for odd numbers . Let's go over there . 
 Maybe you are right . 
 Well , how did you like the show ? 
 Now , you are to board the plane.We ' re sorry that we haven't done much to help you when you stayed in China . 
 We are ready to help you . 
 I'd like to . I'm sure your visit will help to promote the friendship and understanding between both of us.Welcome to China again . 
 Thank you . I will if I have chance.Goodbye and happy landing ! 
 Is the lake very polluted ? 
 Are local factories allowed to discharge waste water into the lake ? 
 Isn ’ t this great ? I always wanted to own a farm , live out in the country , grow my own food ! 
 That ’ s fine ! Don ’ t worry about it ! 
 Relax , it was just a goat ! 
 It ’ s just the cows that are grazing over there . We can milk them later . 
 Honey , seriously , It ’ s just a sheep . Relax ! Relax , that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable . 
 Well , thank you.Mr.Parry , for all your information.Just one more question . 
 Do you play any sports or games ? 
 And what athletics did you play ? Can you remember ? 
 And now ? 
 Well , thank you again for coming to see us.But just remember that we like people who join the company to play in the company sports teams . 
 Hey , that's a really nice outfit you have on . 
 Oh , you look stunning . Your dress really goes well with your shoes . 
 No , not at all . It looks really classy on you . Where did you pick that up ? 
 When did you go there ? 
 I might just do that . What style of clothes do they have ? 
 I was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection . 
 The poor girl is up to the eyes in study all the day . 
 Today's children have not the chance to play , to make fun of them . 
 Yeah , at least when we are children , we have not so much homework to do . 
 What are you doing ? Is anything wrong ? 
 Oh , yes , of course . I'm sorry-I wasn't thinking ... 
 That's unavoidable , but think , How would you keep up to date without television ? 
 Look , you can still learn a lot from watching television , you just need to be smart when you're watching . Filter the information and decide if you believe what you are hearing or not . 
 Really ? Why ? 
 Again , you need to think carefully . If you don't trust others online , have nothing to do with them . 
 I beg your pardon ? 
 What did he say ? 
 Oh dear ! What did he tell you to do ? 
 Ten days ? Would you please repeat it again ? 
 How nice it is here . 
 I've heard the weather here is ideal , just like spring most of the year . 
 What did you think of the teambuiding session this morning ? Do you think it did much good ? 
 I think that's an important part of it all ... we've got to be able to see another side of our co-workers and boss ... We can see what they're like as real human beings , working together on some project , for fun . I really think it helped our team jell together better . 
 The trust game was your favorite , huh ? My favorite part was the personality tests . I think to know more about what kind of personality type you are will tell you a lot about how you can fit into a team.Also , when you know the personality strengths of your colleagues , it helps you understand them better . 
 Yes , it is . Are you here on business ? 
 I ’ m going there for a tour , too . Is this your first trip to China ? 
 Why don ’ t we go together ? I can show you around . I think you ’ ll have a better time . 
 Great , let ’ s go ! 
 I think that , as more people use the Internet for both work and pleasure , it makes more sense as a tool to connect with people , and the stigma of meeting someone online is reduced . 
 I would say do not make the e-mail exchange too long . A lot of times a connection via e-mail creates almost a false sense of intimacy . Quickly make sure there is a connection in the physical world . 
 I'd suggest you not give out too much personal information , like your home address , until after several dates . Just keep up the same guards you would keep up if you were meeting any stranger . 
 Well , for a site like ecrush.com , since their debut in Valentine's Day in 1999 , of the 1.5 million people who have joined ecrush.com , 300000 have actually matched . 
 Yes , the couple that I highlighted at today's show met on Match.com and they're getting married this summer . 
 Well , you don't seem to be interested in getting a real job , either . 
 Yeah , and every high school student in town is banging on your door , right ? 
 You're such a dreamer ! You think that you can spread the word of jazz in an underpass ? 
 Was it ? 
 Thank you.It was really a challenge to speak before such a large audience , you know . 
 Smith is always careless , it is his Achilles ’ s heel . 
 He will burn his fingers . 
 Here's some dancing . See those guys stomping , clapping and shouting ? They're practicing step-dancing . 
 They basically turn their bodies into drums . There's a national step competition every year . 
 Wen ! That's only a stereotype . Like all Asians are supposed to be math geniuses . I'm not a great dancer , and you said you failed calculus . 
 This is the end , Jane . I don't want a girlfriend who goes out with other guys all the time . 
 No way . I've given you too many chances already . 
 Well , it's OK , I suppose . We get about the equivalent of six months ' salary . 
 Maybe . But you'd be amazed at how little's left after the credit companies have deducted their share from my account . 
 Well , you're lucky that you're still able to make your payments . I missed a credit payment last month . Now my bank account's overdrawn , and the company is threatening to take back my purchases . 
 A new home health monitor . 
 You're kidding ! 
 That's something else ! Maybe I'll return it to them . 
 I really liked living in Australia . I was an international student and I studied education at the university of Sydney . And living in Sydney was fantasticbecuase I could go to the beach anytime I wanted and there was a great nightlife in Sydney . There are lots of great clubs . And people were very , very friendly and easy-going and I met a lot of international people in living Sydney . 
 I was there for almost a year . 
 And I travelled a little bit in Australia . I went up the east coast . Up to Frasier Island . Which is a world heritage site . And I saw dingo running along the beach and sharks in the water . We climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the ... , which is a but north . And the further north you go in Australia , the hotter it gets . So we were able to go swimming in the ocean and I went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause I didn't have a diving license , so I went on an introductory dive and I saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that I was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly . 
 Almost . 
 Exactly . 
 I'd like to go and live there for at least another year . Probably I'll go back to Sydney or maybe I'll go down to Melbourne because it's a really interesting cultural city . They have lot of museums and parks . 
 For example ? 
 You have done excellent work . 
 Really ? How did you get the chance ? 
 My warmest congratulations on your entering the Oxford University . 
 Happy birthday ! This is for you , Kate . 
 You know in China we usually don't open presents until the guests leave . 
 Guess who I saw yesterday ? 
 Avril Lavigen ! 
 Yeah , I worked as temporary staff in her concert . Look , her poster , a CD ... 
 Not really . But I like some of her songs . She's actually very talented . She's a song writer and fashion designer , too . 
 Yeah , though I don't think her acting skills are that great . 
 She looked sweeter than her pictures . 
 No , there were too many people . When she got out of the car , her fans were all screaming , trying to give her flowers and to get her autographs . 
 I have to go home now , Jenny . Thanks for inviting me to your party . 
 I had a wonderful time . 
 Grades are based on many things 
 Actually I look at all of it and let's not forget class participation . 
 Homework , attendance , and quizzes are sixty percent ; the mid-term and final are worth twenty percent each . 
 I will allow one unexcused absence ; after that you need to contact me ahead of time . 
 You will be able to track your progress during the year . 
 How did you get that ? No need to show you my hand , I lose.This is not as much fun as the music concert we just saw . 
 They're quite popular now . Wasn't her voice good ? 
 Janet Jackson is more pop music.Shania sings country music . Celine just seems to hit all the right notes . 
 Yes , l have two of her Cds , l'II lend them to you if you like . 
 I hope you have a good stereo . 
 Because you have to hear it really loud to get the full concert effect . 
 My grandmother just passed away . 
 A couple of days ago . I just go back from the funeral . 
 No ... not really . The sad thing is that I wasn't there when she died . I really wanted to be there one last time . 
 Yeah . She died in her sleep . 
 At least she didn't suffer . 
 I know . But I miss her . 
 Yeah ? That's what I was thinking too . Thanks . 
 You're right ... I should eat something . Let's go . 
 It's hard to say , I like interesting and significant ones . I don't care whether they're blockbusters or not . 
 Very good , What's on ? 
 Let's go eat . 
 I can't seem to progress up the career ladder no matter how hard I try and I have been here for 2 years already ! 
 An MBA , hey . . . well my degree wasn't in business , the business schools won't be interested in me . 
 GMAT ? What does that stand for and what will the test contain ? 
 Okay , this sounds a little tough , how am I supposed to practice for this ? 
 No matter what I do , I'm going to ace this test and go on to become a corporate fat cat ! 
 hello , Kate ! How are you doing ? 
 fine . How are your term papers ? 
 how could it be ? They are due two weeks later . 
 Kate , you know , I am thinking of getting a part-time job next year because I really need more money and I don't want to ask my parents for any more . But I'm so busy ! How am I going to work and study 
 my advisor ? 
 Yeah of course ! Although , don ’ t you ever wonder what could have been ? 
 Well , sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently . 
 Like for example , if I hadn ’ t studied architecture , I would have become an artist like I wanted to . 
 You see ! Everything happens for a reason ! We wouldn ’ t even have met if I hadn ’ t been in that car accident ten years ago ! 
 I ’ ll drink to that ! 
 Well , I just saw a horror movie last night . It almost frightened me to death . 
 I don't care for a detective film . It also makes me nervous . 
 No , I don't think comedies today are natural or cheerful . 
 No , romance is boring . 
 Let's go to see a war movie , shall we ? 
 Certainly . Is there anything wrong ? 
 Hi . Bob ! We've been working hard at our lessons for a fortnight . So why don't we take it easy this weekend ? 
 How about seeing a play ? I hear Hamlet is on at the National Theater . 
 ( looking at a newspaper ) Oh , dear me ! There's no performance at the National theater this weekend . So we have to go to cinema instead . 
 Let me see .. um . Gone With the Wind . It is on at six cinemas on Saturday night . 
 Ah . The Royal , I think . 
 Why don't we go to the 7:30 show ? It is convenient to us , I think . 
 Do you want to go to the earlier or the later show ? 
 Then , there's a 9:30 show . 
 All right . 
 Out of the frying pan and into the fire . 
 Yes , he was 29 then . 
 Well , I've got to go . See you later . 
 Thanks , you too . 
 Are you deaf or what ? 
 Coco Lee . 
 Sure , here you go . 
 Of course . There you are . 
 Are you ready , honey ? 
 Just dress formal . 
 It is too loud , we ’ ll handle some official business first before the dinner . 
 You can put on your white shoes , it fits every occasion . 
 It's us . 
 Well , we used to talk to each other before we were married.Remember ? 
 Oh , yes , but we used to do so much together . 
 Back to live with my parents.That ' s something else I used to do before we were married.Remember ? 
 Oh , I know . When is it ? 
 What's on the test ? 
 Well . I think I'm going to fail my chemistry exam . 
 I'm not being pessimistic . I'm being realistic . My chemistry is so bad . 
 Thank you . That's very nice of you . 
 Yes , I am . 
 I actually transferred here from another school . 
 I transferred from PCC . 
 I love it here . 
 Don ’ t get me wrong . I like it here , but PCC is better . 
 Because I got my AA and now I am going towards my bachelor degree . 
 You are not the gray train , I guess . But bite the bullet and you'll soon be in the chips again . 
 But the darkest hour is the nearest dawn . I bet you'll soon turn the table . 
 Who was it ? 
 She never cares about others . 
 Her new boyfriend , right ? 
 I was also interrupted by her last week because of such a thing . 
 why ? Did tom pop the question ? 
 let me guess , your parents want you to marry a Chinese man , right ? 
 I used to have the same problem when I was with my ex . 
 I just let it go and continued dating with my Korean boyfriend . But finally we broke up . 
 simple . We had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences . 
 he hoped to live in the Korean way and asked me to give up working and stay at home to take care of the family . 
 yes , he said it would be batter for me and for the whole family . But I simply can not quit working . 
 not really . There are many successful mixed marriage around us . 
 You look a bit pale , don't you ? 
 You should get plenty of sleep . 
 If I were you , I wouldn't drink too much . 
 You better do some exercise every morning . 
 Why do you worry about your future ? You're very young , and you'll make great contribution to the world . I hope you take my advice . 
 Emm ... yes . But I wasn't too impressed . I found her a little stuck up . 
 Tom ... you are her boss , you kown.Of course , she's helpful to you . 
 I don't think so actually . She never even says " hello " to me . 
 Huh ? Me ? 
 Why should I do that ? It's only a piece of garbage . Why should you care ? 
 Listen , I really don't know why you're making this into such a big issue . It's only a small piece of garbage in a large space . It's not like there's garbage everywhere . Besides , someone will come along to clean it up at some time or another . 
 Ok , whatever . See , I'm putting it in the garbage can . 
 What are you doing this weekend ? 
 If ever you ’ re in Chicago , please do look me up . 
 No trouble at all . I think maybe you will meet some of my friends here as well . 
 How do you feel about wearing name logos or slogans on your clothing ? 
 Do you think advertising has an influence on the choices you make when you're shopping ? 
 I actually try to avoid name-brand items . I can't stand it when big companies advertise their products all over the place ! 
 I think is sensible to buy products that is high quality than others when you want to buy something that's going to last a long time , but I don't think it always makes sense . 
 I do for shower items like shower gel and shampoo , but I don't for higher-end items . 
 It's just a slogan for a famous company ; there's nothing really special about it . 
 To each their own ! 
 I sat through about half of it but they lost me after that . 
 Not really , to be honest . Some of what they call fashion looks terrible to me . 
 All the rage with whom ? I never see anyone wearing these designs on the street . 
 What , it keeps coming back ? 
 Flares ? 
 It's too complicated . I'll just stick to the plain clothes . 
 Our national economy is increasing hand over fist . 
 I hope it ’ ll continue for a long time . 
 I know that . I met her last week , and she looked as pale as death . 
 That ’ s too bad . She ’ s been so kind to us all . 
 I want to see all places of renown in Suzhou . 
 By bike , of course.You don't want to miss the beautiful scenery , do you ? 
 How terrible ! 
 I really don't want to go into the world , I feel afraid of it . 
 I know . 
 I know I'm late . I'm sorry . I tried to call you to tell you , but your phone seems to be disconnected . 
 Yes . An automatic message says your phone is not in service . 
 So I couldn't get through . I knew I'd be late because my car wouldn't start.It was too cold I had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . That's why I'm late . 
 About what ? 
 Well , the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast . 
 No . I hate cell phones.But you could go to a neighbor's house and use their phone . 
 Yes , of course I can drive you.So you don't want to get your phone fixed right away ? 
 Alright , let's go . 
 Would you like to go to a concert tonight ? 
 All right , then.There is one at the new concert hall . 
 It's the Powell orchestra . 
 They're doing a seventeenth-century program . 
 Well , I'm not sure of his name , but I know it's going to be his farewell performance . 
 I have an opening . Do you have an add sheet for me to sign ? 
 After I sign it , you must take it to the Admissions and Records Office to add the class . Do you know where that is ? 
 When you cross the quad , the office is right in front of you . Go inside and follow the signs to the correct line . 
 It should be easy to find . After you add the class , check with me in a few weeks to make sure that you are on my roll sheet . 
 Good , just make sure that you do the same thing if you ever need to drop a class . Good luck ! 
 Let's plan a surprise party for him ! 
 That's easy . Anything else ? 
 Won't he be surprised ! 
 That's O . K . Maybe his wife will spill the beans ! 
 Women in particular . They are anxious to get rid of those thick and clumsy winter suits and put on their new fashionable spring dress . 
 That's true . In summer , the first place people want to go is a spacious room with air-conditioning or a quiet river or swimming pool . 
 In autumn , almost all fruits are ripe and all crops are waiting to be harvested . 
 Well , winter is a season for relaxation , do you agree with me ? 
 Maybe you are right . 
 As a matter of fact , I am a bit upset . I just came out of a meeting and it didn't go very well . 
 No one would listen to any of my suggestions . Instead , they just kept arguing with each other . 
 Bob . 
 That's exactly what happened ! He kept interrupting everyone with his own suggestions and did not want to hear what others had to say . Then he expected everyone to agree with him . 
 We were trying to come up with ideas to streamline the office's workflow to make it more efficient . 
 Exactly . I had tons of ideas that I wanted to share , but they just wouldn't let me finish . What should I have done to get my point across ? 
 Short and sweet ? But what if I have to explain something complicated ? 
 That's a good idea , I think I will try that at the next meeting . 
 Good idea . Is there a good movie on ? 
 All right . But it'll be difficult to buy tickets I suppose . 
 What time does it begin ? 
 I'll come for you at about eight . 
 I ’ d love to have my own farm . 
 I wouldn ’ t mind getting up early morning and the physical work would make me fit and healthy . 
 That ’ s one reason I ’ d like to try it . I ’ d really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office . 
 My uncle owns a farm and I ’ Ve spent some time working with him . I love being in the countryside with farm animals and green fields . 
 Good afternoon , everyone . The experiment is to start at 3 . Have you gone through the instructions ? 
 Ok , now some points for attention . First of all , pay attention to safety ... Now , sign your names on the lab record , and after that you can start . If there is any question , just let me know . 
 Have you turned it on ? 
 Ok , I will get you another one . 
 Guess what ? Paul and Susan are engaged . 
 A week ago ? They met last summer and now just sink . They will be married soon . 
 No , not yet . But Susan says they ’ d like to get married in November or December . Then they ’ ll go to Hawaii for their honeymoon . 
 Are you trying to lose weight ? 
 You don ’ t have to starve yourself to lose weight . I think that ’ s where you ’ re going wrong . 
 Not really . You should try to not eat foods high in calories , salts or saturated fats . Stay away from oily food and artificial flavors . 
 Yes ! You can also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates and foods that are high in cholesterol . You can have steamed veggies or increase your protein intake found in chicken or fish . 
 Don ’ t count on it . 
 Which song ? 
 No , I've never heard of this song before . It's beautiful ! Who sing it ? 
 No . How about going to karaoke tonight ? 
 How are you ? 
 I haven ’ t seen you for several days . 
 What ’ s he doing ? 
 He must be happy . 
 Fine too . 
 Oh , Diane and I went for a drive in the country on Saturday . 
 We drove to the lake and had a picnic . We had a great time ! How about you ? Did you do anything special ? 
 That old thing ! Why don't you just buy a new one ? 
 I ’ d better be going . 
 I wish I could , but It ’ s already late . 
 thank you for wonderful meat . 
 Did you remember to bring back that software I lent to you ? 
 That ’ s ok . If you could just bring it in tomorrow , I would appreciate it . 
 Well , known , Jim , I'm ... I'm pretty much in favour of computers , I think computers teach kids to think , because they require logical thought . 
 What do you mean ? 
 That's not the gadgets.Creating programmes is stimulate thoughts . 
 Well , black is a better color than pink . Pink ’ s for girls . 
 Because ... oh , all right . You win . Let ’ s pay for them and go . 
 Hey , Mike . Can I ask you something ? 
 I'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . Who do you think will win ? 
 My husband is betting on France . 
 What do you mean ? 
 How do you do . I ’ m Mark Rancor . 
 May I know your name , please ? 
 Ah , yes . I remember now . Were you Mr . John ’ s dinner partner last month ? 
 I did but now I ’ m for Microsoft . How are things with you ? 
 May I know what you do ? 
 Sure . That would be great . Good luck . 
 What's the name of the series just showed ? 
 What a horrible name ! Is it full of suspense ? 
 What ’ s “ pi ” ? 
 I see . What is that ratio exactly ? 
 It ’ s 10 centimeters , so the circumference should be 31.4 centimeters . 
 According to the newspaper , the exchange rate is 1.85 dollars to the pound . 
 What ’ s the next question . 
 I can help you there . Those are numbers that cannot be created by multiplying two whole numbers , apart from the number itself and 1 , together . 
 Exactly . Anything else ? 
 You ’ ll be a mathematician one day . 
 Perfect . Couldn't be better ! 
 It's just what I wanted . 
 I'm really pleased with it . Thanks . 
 It's super . 
 Don't worry about it , Lin.That ' s no big deal.You know , Americans appreciate China's rich culinary culture . Just excuse me for a second while I check the number here and figure out how much to give the waiter.Hmm , by the way , what do you do about tipping in China ? 
 No tipping ? Now that's what I call a civilized system . 
 What about cab drivers and porters ? 
 You'd have a revolution on your hands if you tried to introduce that sort of system here . 
 Oh , I took up a new hobby . 
 No , Frank . I'm much more interested in collecting stamps now . 
 It certainly is . It's so much fun . 
 Absolutely . Through all kinds of stamps I am able to learn about the world . 
 You're right . And I also meet many new friends while collecting stamps . 
 Sometimes we even spend hours discussing our collections . 
 Yes , it's really amazing . I got to go now . I'm meeting with some other collectors . 
 See you , Frank . 
 Don't be scared.Bite the bullet and everything will be right again . 
 What a beautiful view , my sweetheart ! 
 What is that below ? 
 No , thank you.It looks a bit too dangerous for me . 
 Yes , there is this beautiful view . you may go fishing , camping and also enjoy this beautiful clean air . 
 You are so romantic , my sweetheart . 
 What ? That would be to cut off your nose to spite your face . 
 Call the police . 
 After six months , my college life will come to the end . The following trouble will be the job-hunting . That's really a headache . 
 It sounds reasonable . Maybe I should look on the bright side . 
 I am worried . 
 My exam . 
 I feel very nervous about it . 
 What's wrong , Frank ? 
 Cheer up ! It's not the end of the world . 
 Don't brother me ! 
 Sorry , Sally , it's not your fault . 
 I drew a blank on ~ about the test . 
 Yeah , but nothing was clear during the test . 
 I'm thinking of dropping out . 
 I'm dead serious about this , Sally . 
 She's pretty and meek . 
 What makes you think so ? 
 Hey , did you hear the news ? 
 Miss Yang is dating the manager who's married . 
 No joke ! That's why she hasn't married yet . 
 I ’ m not in the mood . 
 I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . That ’ s a real let-down . 
 But she did and made me disappointed . 
 But she means a lot to me . 
 Oh . I just can ’ t forget it . 
 I'd be glad to tell you what I think . 
 If I were you , I would change the beginning . You should write about your education first because we like to judge a man by his abilities . 
 I think it's too short . You'd better say something about your work experience . 
 Very good . But you should talk about your family , too . 
 Well , everything is packed and ready to go . 
 Yes . Just think the blue sky , sunshine , mouth-watering food , centuries-old castles - - 
 Yeah , we would have been lost without the help of the locals . 
 Of course . That was the best pasta I've ever had . 
 If only we could eat there once more ! 
 Hope the restaurant is still there . 
 Oh , my god ! Only two hours left before the plane takes off . We need to be at the airport now . 
 Do you live with your parents ? 
 How often do you go back to visit them ? 
 Did you watch the live telecast of the World Cup last night ? 
 What's the band called ? 
 Here comes the birthday cake . 
 Be sure to blow out all the candles in one puff . 
 Yes , but I doubt if I get it . I've never get it . 
 Lisa , I ’ Ve been thinking of something . 
 Well . I ’ Ve done a lot of business for my company . And now I feel like going into business for myself . 
 There ’ s a possibility . What do you say ? 
 What are the seasons like in your city ? 
 Does it ever rain in summer ? 
 What are spring and autumn like ? 
 Well , I live in the southern hemisphere , so our summertime is your wintertime , and vice versa . We get some rain in every season , but most is in winter . In winter , it sometimes gets cold , but our wine 
 No , I don ’ t . I go on a winter holiday instead . I go somewhere warm . 
 I have some good news for you . We've decided we'd like to send you to Shanghai on a business trip this weekend . 
 don't you think that it'd be a good thing for you to get out of the office for a couple of days ? 
 I thought you'd be a bit more excited about this . Everything will be paid for and I'll send my assistant with you to take care of everything for you . All you have to do it get on the train tonight a 
 oh , no . We've brought your return ticket for you . I think you'll find it comfortable . 
 oh no . the train hasn't been crowded at all recently . Besides , you're in first-class , so you'll be fine . 
 they've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9:00 tomorrow morning . That should give you enough time to have a quick shower . 
 we've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings , so you won't need to deal much with the transportation system . 
 that's not a problem . Have a nap if you can . You don't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip . 
 I'm sorry . I forget all about it . 
 It's leap my mind . I really feel terrible about it . 
 I'm really sorry I let you down . I'll make it up to you somehow . 
 You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness . 
 Do you really think so ? I don't . It will just make us fat and act silly . Remember last time ? 
 I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends . 
 Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us . That is excellent exercise and fun , too . 
 All right . 
 Well , to start with , Markweed Inc . has a reputation for being one of the best employers in the field . 
 First of all , they have an excellent benefits package for all employees , even the maintenance staff have health and dental coverage . 
 From what I hear , they are very reasonable . A lot of the prestige the company has built is because they have attacked some high profile employees with their incentives . 
 It's a great place to work . They give you fair pay and benefits , and a lot of room to grow . I think if they off you a job , you should definitely take it . 
 Fortunately , there is no person died . 
 Yeah . Earthquake is one of the most badly natural disasters in the world . 
 Well , China is located on the Eurasia plate , where earthquakes happen frequently due to the earth's plates knocking against each other . 
 Yeah , we've experienced the 8.0 magnitude earthquake in Wenchman . 
 Right . But people at that time only know two words , " save " and " assistance " , they will never don't lift a finger . Life is the most important compared with anything else . 
 Do I have to take these books here if I want to renew them ? 
 That's so convenient . 
 Don ’ t be fool . I ’ ll always side with you . 
 Did you play football yesterday ? 
 What did you do after you'd played football ? 
 Are you going swimming again this afternoon ? 
 Are you helping him all afternoon ? 
 You're , going to be very busy . 
 Welcome , Ron , come on in ! 
 We enjoy it too ! 
 About four years now . 
 Ron , have a seat and I'll get us something to drink . 
 I have lemonade , iced tea , and mango juice . 
 Is there a lot of oil and coal in your country ? 
 Yes , it is . My country is famous for having that natural resources . We also have a lot of natural gas . 
 No coal has been discovered in my country , but there may be undiscovered deposits . We don ’ t have many metal deposits . 
 When I traveled around your country , I bought some jewellery made from gold from your country . The jewellery told me that there are few gold mines in your country . The gold was found in mountain steams . 
 You have many trees in your country . That ’ s another natural resources . 
 I see . That ’ s probably a good idea . Too many forest are being destroyed . 
 We have some inspections , but it is very hard to avoid pollution when extracting oil . There has been some damage , but it is under control . 
 Why not ? 
 So what ? His father is in prison , not he . 
 just after 2 am . 
 nope , actually I was waiting for you . I have something big to tell you . 
 I have an offer to work for a company in your city today ? 
 I haven't accepted the position yet and with the upcoming holiday I think it's the perfect chance to visit the city and take a good look at the company before deciding . If you have time I think we c 
 me too . But I think I am going to bed now . my head is getting heavy . Have a nice day there ! 
 talk to you later . 
 I know . I know . I don ’ t smoke too much , though . 
 About a pack , more if I drink . 
 No , I ’ m not . My father smoked two packs a day for forty years . 
 Yeah ... you ’ re right . I really should stop smoking . 
 I didn't like her butting in where I didn't want her . She's a chatter box . 
 I know . But I just can't stand her butting in when I was trying to emphasize a point . 
 Hello ! 
 Yeah , my name is Nandu . 
 Yeah , my name is like N-A-N-J-U . 
 I'm from Madras . 
 I'm sorry . 
 Isn't there some way you could work your schedule out to be here ? 
 How are you going to catch up ? 
 If you miss this class , you will have used up your quota for the semester . 
 Make sure to remind me right before you are absent . 
 Enjoy your day off and don't forget to study ! 
 Is it formal or informal ? 
 In that case , formal suit with a nice tie will be better . 
 The brown leather shoes are OK . 
 Don ’ t mention it . 
 He's the nicest boss I've had . 
 What's more , he said I was the hardest working person in the office ! 
 I hope so . 
 Yeah . Water pollution has for a long time been a major concern among the environmental issues . 
 They could generally be divided into two categories , direct and indirect contaminant sources . 
 Yeah . They are emitted directly into urban water supplies . 
 Indirect sources include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater . 
 Sure . It's an issue asking for everyone's participation . 
 But to me it's really enjoyable . 
 Maybe so . 
 Why don ’ t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy , being outside working during the day ? 
 Maybe you have two choices . You could attend school during the day , or you could get a position that provides training . 
 What time are you leaving ? 
 Take care and give my best to your parents . 
 Don't forget to call us if you're in Tokyo . 
 How many members are there in your forum ? 
 I think we can visit West Lake . The landscapes are attractive . It is said that just as there is paradise in heaven , there are Su Thou and Hang Thou on earth . 
 What can we do next after locating the place ? 
 My mom is three years older than my dad , and they are like night and day.My mom is 5 footsweet and very nice , and very caring , and very cute , everybody tells her how young she looks , and how she resembles my sister , perhaps.My father is very much completely opposite that.He is a very bi 4 , on a good day , 5 foot 2 , I think in real life , and she is very nice . 
 I talked to them probably about two weeks ago . Yeah , everything is going well . 
 I am going to go home after the holidays and we're going to have a Christmas kind of in January or February . Yeah , depending on when my brother can come in . 
 I think I have traits of both , actually . I look more like my mother . 
 Alright , no problem . 
 Wait a minute . Cal's bar ? 
 That's a gay bar . 
 I thought he was maybe gay , but I wasn't sure.Anyhow , you don't expect me to go into a gay bar , do you ? 
 Why doesn't he meet us outside ? 
 Yeah , but who wants to go in ? I'm not gay , you know . Why should I go in a gay bar ? 
 I just wouldn't be comfortable . 
 No , never . 
 Well ... 
 No , I don't . But I never went into a gay bar before . 
 Okay . I will try it . I suppose it isn't reasonable for me to refuse to go in.After all , gay people aren't afraid to go into normal bars . 
 Fine . 
 Bite your tongue ! I ’ m already at the end of my rope . Some nights I don ’ t sleep at all . John manages to sleep like a log even when the babies are screaming at the top of their lungs . 
 I wouldn ’ t say that I had the time of my life but at least everything went without a hitch . 
 Is everything ready for the big family barbecue tomorrow ? 
 We should also cook a couple dozen hot dogs and kebabs . 
 Great ! I asked Grace to bring cups and serviettes as she is also bringing two big coolers for the beers . 
 How is Rose now ? 
 I ’ m sorry to hear about that . 
 Yes , it is.It ' s wonderful after the downpour . 
 I hope it stays nice like this for a long period of time . 
 You're right.We don't know what is going to be like tomorrow . 
 The weatherman predicts a fine day today . 
 Good morning . Mrs.Smith . 
 Well , what kind of books does she like ? 
 I see . Has she read any detective stories ? 
 Do you know if she's read this one ? 
 Ah ! She has a bad memory . How old is she ? 
 I suggest you take this book . It's very exciting . 
 Do I have to write the invitation cards ? 
 Oh , well . If I must , I must . 
 As you know , China has a single-child policy . Therefore , there ’ s just my husband , my daughter and I . What about in your family ? 
 Not anymore . They live with my brother now . and yours ? 
 No , I have two older brothers and one younger sister . What about you ? 
 How long have you been married ? 
 I've been married for about five years . What do you think about divorce ? 
 If my husband cheated on me or treated me badly , I would get a divorce . 
 ( ha ha ) I ’ ll keep that in mind , but don ’ t tell my husband . 
 I hear that you are going to participate in the dinner party tonight.Seen from what you are dressing , you really look like a fox . 
 I was just watching a documentary on tv about people use dogs for various purpose . It was very interesting . 
 The documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow . 
 Don ’ t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts . 
 Yes , I can . I don ’ t ride regularly though . How about you ? 
 What a good idea ! 
 I'm in a good mood today , actually . How about you ? 
 What's wrong ? 
 I see ! Do you want to ask her out ? 
 You can ask her out for drink after work . 
 Then you've got a lot of homework to do . You need to get her notice first . 
 You can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying hello to her . 
 That's something you need to overcome . Men should make the first move as most of girls prefer being chased . 
 Good luck . 
 We'd better go out for a walk . 
 Spring . 
 I dislike it most . 
 Because the hottest season is summer in a year . 
 Where did you go yesterday ? 
 Did you go shopping ? 
 Oh , did you get a job ? 
 Fantastic . 
 Don't you know that he has been carrying a torch for Mary for years ? 
 Of course not . 
 Mom , you know that Andrea and I sometimes worry about you . 
 You ’ re almost 70 years old , Mom ! Don ’ t you think it would be better for you if you moved in with us ? 
 Do you ever get lonely living alone ? 
 Tom , you look thoughtful and unhappy recently . What's wrong with you ? 
 Why ? I mean , why did she part company with you after seven years together ? 
 Do you believe her excuse ? 
 Come on , buddy , cheer up . Why not do some sports with me ? Violent exercise might help to shake you out of your disappointment in love . 
 Do you like singing ? 
 Let's go to a ETV tonight . 
 It doesn't matter . No one will laugh at you . 
 What about six ? 
 OK . Let's make it . 
 I'll have us ready for Stars.com by the end of next week . After that , I don't know . 
 Let's just say there could be some big changes around here . 
 You'll see . Oh , yeah , you'll see . 
 It ’ s really terrible ! 
 Don ’ t you see many parents are forcing there children ’ s hands to learn something they think important to their children . But the children are not interested in it at all . 
 Hello , this is Helen speaking . 
 Fine , thank you . And you ? 
 Oh , how wonderful . I ’ ll be glad to . 
 Hum , don ’ t say that . Maybe you can do something useful for me . 
 I ’ ll tell you at the party . 
 Don't you think we ' d leave for the concert now ? 
 In about 25 minutes . 
 This is my admission card , and these are the books . 
 By the way , can I renew the borrowing ? 
 Sense and Sensibility , English version . 
 Can I just do it here ? 
 OK , thanks . 
 I was thinking of buying this from the bookstore when my father got this from the library ... anyway , how much should I pay ? 
 Here you are . Thanks . 
 Hi , Mary , it ’ s been a long time 
 Well , I ’ m doing okay . And how about yourself ? 
 Oh . I ’ m sorry to hear that . What happened ? 
 sure , thanks . I brought you a bottle of wine as well . 
 should I take my shoes off ? 
 this is a very nice place . How long have you been living here now ? 
 sure , what do you have ? 
 I'll have a glass of red wine please . 
 so how many people are coming for the dinner tonight ? 
 oh , I thought there were going to be eight . who isn't coming ? 
 that's too bad.They ' re such good company . 
 excuse me while I go and get that . 
 No , but I have to type my paper tonight . 
 You got it ! 
 Certainly . I prefer the winter and I love plum blossoms much more . 
 Seeking plum blossoms with stepping on the snow ? That's a good idea . Let's go ! 
 Take care ! Don't slip down to the ground . 
 Yes . Very wonderful . 
 Yes . It should be the fragrance of plum blossoms . 
 I hate working on Christmas Eve ! Whoa ! Get a load of this guy ! Come in central , I think we ’ Ve got ourselves a situation here . 
 I had one or two glasses of eggnog , but nothing else . 
 Just a few Christmas gifts , ’ tis the season , after all ! 
 Umm ... no ... I make these in my workshop in the North Pole ! 
 You can ’ t take me to jail ! What about my sleigh ? It ’ s Christmas Eve ! I have presents to deliver ! Rudolph ! Prancer ! Dancer ! Get help ! 
 That's correct . 
 What would you reckon the taxing increases ? 
 But what do most people think about it ? 
 How's your father been ? 
 What's wrong with him ? 
 Well , tell him to take it easy and that I hope he feels better . 
 Can you help me buy my textbooks ? 
 No , I don't have that . 
 I am not sure where the bookstore is . 
 Yes , I knew I could do that . Exactly how do I go about selling them ? 
 I think maybe I could be there . 
 Maybe that would work . 
 Hey , John . Nice car . 
 What is this , the new Ford ? 
 True . How much did you pay ? 
 Does that mean you ’ re not going to take the train to work anymore ? 
 Yeah , sure . 
 What are your plans for this weekend ? 
 If the weather's fine . 
 I know a good place to hire bikes if you want . 
 But remember , be careful when you ride a bike . The traffic in Beijing can be dangerous . 
 Yeah . It's boring . I'd rather read something more exciting . 
 Is he ? He ’ s never been healthy . 
 I ’ m afraid he won ’ t make old bones . 
 I ’ m afraid what you were told is not quite right , if you could meet him in person , and you ’ ll know he ’ s very agreeable and capable . 
 Do you like playing tennis ? 
 Maybe you haven't found the magic . 
 How old are you ? 
 I'm older than you ! I'll be ten on April 14th . 
 Maybe . I'll have to ask my mother . 
 Professor Donald , are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester ? 
 I wonder if I could enroll in it . I know it is a graduate course and I ' m a junior , but ... 
 I know , but geology of the American west is my major interest and I have done a large reading in the field . 
 Oh , thanks , professor Donald.this is very nice of you . 
 Good evening , Mary . 
 I'm doing fine , thanks.What ' s new with you ? 
 I'm wondering whether you could come over for a pizza sometime next week ? 
 I'll call you . 
 Have a great day , take care , bye . 
 I'm not sure . I promised to help my sister move Saturday . 
 I might be able to do that . But I don't think I can do it well . 
 OK . I'll talk to you later . 
 No , that ’ s not all your fault . 
 There ’ s no need to apologize.Forget about it . 
 I am not surprised , you eat too much . 
 No , I wouldn't think so . 
 Well , why don't you go on the diet ? 
 Perhaps you should excercise more . Why don't you go to an exercise class . 
 Hi , Larry , how was your weekend ? 
 Great . I hung out with Jo all day shopping , and the went out for dinner together . 
 Yeah , I never thought we could be good friends either . We have our differences . She's more outgoing and active while I am more quiet and reversed , but we still get along extremely well . We can talk for hours about anything . 
 When Jo and I are together , we argue a lot , but that's also part of the fun . Besides , I know she will always be there for me when I need her , and she knows I'll be there for her . 
 Exactly . Having Jo as my friend is one of the best things that's ever happened to me . 
 Thanks , I think so too . 
 I had a bad day yesterday . 
 I went to the library and lost my bag . 
 I went back for it . But it was already gone . 
 Are you free this evening , Li ? 
 What a pity . I wanted to go for a drink with you . 
 No , I haven ’ t got any plans . 
 Why not ? Sounds good to me . 
 I prefer a package tour , and we don't have to worry about accommodation , meals or that sort of trivial demanding things . 
 Here , Let me get the door for you . 
 Do you need a hand with that ? 
 Don't worry about it . 
 There ’ s a possibility . 
 I mean if you don ’ t sell your shares now , it ’ s quite likely that you ’ ll end up losing your shirt . 
 Absolutely . Take my word for it . 
 No , I ’ m not sure I ’ m going to . 
 No , thanks . I am okay . 
 Well , actually , I am thinking about living off campus . 
 I know it would be more expensive . I think I could handle it though . It ’ s that this dorm is so noisy that I can ’ t get anything done . 
 I ’ Ve got to think it over some more . 
 What a wonderful party ! I had a good time . How about you ? 
 Shall I give you a ride home ? 
 It's no trouble at all because your house is on the way to my place . 
 Hello , my name is Xu Hua . I'm from Beijing . 
 Welcome to China , Paula . 
 Have you heard that Mel Gibson was arrested by the police last week ? 
 For suspicion of driving under influence . 
 You've met her before , haven't you ? 
 Excuse me , Sir , do you know what time it is ? 
 Thank you . 
 Yeah . I was in a hurry and I forgot my umbrella today . 
 Oh , that ’ s very kind of you . I am going to the Garden Hotel . 
 Sure . 
 This Friday evening ? 
 Thank you for the invitation . I'll be very happy to go . 
 What time should I arrive ? 
 Fine . See you then . 
 Well , do you think I have to ? 
 Please look at the sky.Don ' t you see the dark clouds ? It's going to rain soon . 
 But I don't think it's so nice . 
 The weather report says it's going to rain for a whole week . 
 Can you speak English ? 
 Where did you learn it ? 
 What else can you speak ? 
 What ’ s the difference between football and rugby ? 
 In rugby , players pass the ball by throwing it to team mates , don ’ t they ? 
 I know how goals are scored in football , but how about in rugby ? 
 There ’ s a lot more physical contact in rugby , isn ’ t there ? 
 The ball is a different shape in rugby , isn ’ t it ? 
 Ok . 
 Yeah , why not ? We haven't been out for dinner for quite a long time . A new French restaurant has just opened in our neighborhood . We can go there . 
 No need for that . It's not usually busy on weekdays . 
 Why not now ? I'm hungry . 
 Well , I like others very much , but I really don't think much of this one . 
 Yes , but I don't like the story . 
 Hm ? Oh , that's Alice . She's totally mad . Don't get yourself in a room alone with her . 
 Yes , I know , but she's dangerous . 
 Well , I'm not one to gossip , as you know , but rumor has it that she sued her former boss for sexual harassment . 
 Well , this is just between ourselves , of course , but he was her lover and he wanted to leave her , so she got revenge . I heard him say she was a dangerous woman . 
 Oh , while we're on the subject , what happened to you and your secretary ? 
 Oh , come on . Everybody knows . 
 Oh , sure . 
 It is a new film , ' Transformer ' . 
 I expected too high from that movie , but I was a bit disappointed about it . 
 Box office can't explain everything . I do not think it is cheerful or well-made . The plot is old and the female character is not pretty . 
 What's it about ? 
 I prefer the tragedy . It is moving and makes me ponder about my life . 
 We can buy the popcorn before entering the cinema . 
 Fine ! How about you ? 
 I cannot ignore her suggestion . In fact I always value her suggestion . 
 Well , it takes two to to make a happy marriage . 
 Who ’ s that ? 
 Oh , please come in . nice to see you . 
 Yeah , I ’ m trying to decorate my house . 
 But actually it ’ s not done yet . I ’ m going to get a special pendent lamp . 
 It ’ s just a simple decorating . I just want to add my personality to my living space . 
 Well , it depends . 
 No , I think the music is too fast . 
 It sounds nice . 
 Yes , I think so . It's very emotional . 
 Full of energy and hope . 
 Certainly it is . It's worth an Academy Award . 
 Thanks for inviting me . Actually , I've never been anywhere with so many black people before . It's different . 
 Great ! Is your , too ? 
 That's a black fraternity , right ? So we should see some dancing ! 
 Sure . We love each other and take care of each other . 
 My grandpa . He has the final word about almost everything . My grandpa is “ President , ” and Grandma is “ Vice-President . ” My parents , uncles and aunts try to arrive at a consensus on important questions . 
 No . Not anymore.Mine is highly educated but traditional family . Most South Korea families today are a lot smaller . In traditional families , the old people are well respected and taken good care of . Ho 
 Of course there'll be a room for you ! 
 Yours is a modern family . I'm sure your dad loves you and would want you to stay for the summer . You just need to try your best to get along with your new stepmother and her boys . 
 It will be a new experience , and you might as well learn to adjust to changes . 
 It is good to have goals in life . If California doesn't work out , come and visit me in Korea , OK ? 
 We could share a room ! It would be fun . And we could do some traveling around Korea . You could see for yourself what life in a big family is like ! 
 Hello , Kate . 
 I was almost on line the whole night . 
 No , I listened to the music , too . 
 I'm tired . I need a rest . 
 Oh , I'm afraid I'll be busy tomorrow evening . 
 OK.Thanks for asking me . 
 I'm glad I was able to help . 
 Don't mention it . It was the least I could do . 
 Thank you . 
 It was a pleasure . 
 I'm just in the mood to act goofy . 
 I guess I'm glad exams are over . 
 Cut what out I ’ m not doing anything . 
 Fine ! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup ! 
 You ’ Ve got to be kidding me ! You ’ re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ? 
 Fine . Let's call a truce . I'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down . 
 what do you think about all the different diets people go on ? 
 but what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ? 
 so you think it's ok for people who are dieting to eat chocolate ? 
 how about drinking soda ? 
 that's good advice . Have you ever tried taking vitamins ? 
 how do you know so much about food and dieting ? 
 Bill , I have received the admission letter from Cambridge University ! 
 How about you ? Have you got any news from university ? 
 I am glad you can study something you really like ! 
 I don't mind at all . 
 To tell you the truth , I'm not married . I'm still single . 
 I don't know . It's still up in the air . 
 No foot gives out scent . 
 Never mind , the odour of my feet will quicken their eating speed . 
 Don ’ t pretend you are a good God . 
 I've never experienced such a kind of feeling . 
 What are you doing over the weekend , Sara ? 
 I want to go camping , you know , just get a way for the weekend . I'm not sure I'll be able to , though . 
 Well , I have a lot of work . I'll see how it goes . 
 She wears her heart on her sleeve . 
 Good afternoon , Mary . How's business ? 
 hey Ayden , I was wondering if you could do me a favor . 
 it's kind of a big favor . I'm absolutely flat broke , and I owe my landlady $ 200 . she's given me until Friday to give it to her , but I don't get paid until next Monday . Do you think you could loans 
 if you can't give me the full amount , a fraction of it would still help . I'll pay you back on Monday . I promise . 
 thanks a lot Ayden . Every little bit will help . Tell you what , if you aren't doing anything tonight , why don't you come over and have dinner at my place . 
 how about at 6 pm ? 
 You don't have to play that record so loud , do you ? 
 Yes . And please ask me the next time you want to use something . 
 I'm going over to the gym . I want to do some running . 
 Are you kidding ? Do you know how cold it is today ? 
 No , it's not . Not at all . I'd probably freeze my lungs . 
 You ? 
 I didn't know you could exercise . 
 Yeah , I know . But you ? I always thought you were only good at lifting beer bottles to your mouth . 
 You're going to lift weights ? Hah ! 
 I'm sorry . I just can't imagine you lifting weights . 
 It's true . If a person doesn't exercise , they get sluggish.That ' s why I keep running . Even in the winter . 
 But lifting weights isn't the best thing.You should do some kind of aerobic exercise . 
 It sounds like a good plan to me . I'm still ... I mean ... 
 I'm still just surprised you really want to do it.It doesn't seem to go with your character . 
 Who cares ? 
 I'm looking forward to going to America . 
 Next week . 
 There certainly are a lot . Can you choose a favorite ? 
 Is there anything as good as a hot fudge sundae ? 
 I don't like ice cream with too many different flavors in it . 
 I saw garlic ice cream on the menu once . 
 I think I'll stick with a more traditional choice today ! 
 it will be a rock and roll band probably . He ’ s a very good guitarist . 
 I can play drums , but I haven ’ t played for a while . I ’ m not sure I ’ d be good enough to play in a band . 
 nowadays , you can be a DJ . You can mix dance music . You don ’ t need to be able to play musical instrument or sing . 
 you know , you could probably get a computer program that would help you . You already have a computer , so you could use that to help you mix some music . 
 Hey , Frank , there is that Janet Check . 
 She sure knows how to strut her stuff . 
 And look out she's dressed . 
 No way . Her old man is rich . He buys her anything she wants . 
 I think you've lost it . 
 I admit that she is much prettier than Kate . 
 At least we agree on that . Let's go and get a drink . 
 Any idea when you'll leave ? 
 Let me know when you find out . 
 Cindy ’ s husband is Ron . 
 They have two children-one son and one daughter-as well as one daughter-in-law and one son-in-law . 
 Yes , they have three grandchildren-one girl and two boys . 
 Yes , she gets along with them quite well . 
 Their family is very similar to Cindy and Ron ’ s family . 
 I feel confident of his ability to cure my daughter's disease . 
 I can tell from the way he spoke to us . 
 Where do you live , Kim ? 
 Oh , that's convenient , but ... how much crime is there ? 
 . I have a house in the suburbs . 
 No , not much . In fact , nothing ever really happens . That's the trouble . 
 OK . Great idea ! 
 Really ? Can ’ t you stay a little longer ? 
 Be seeing you then . 
 Good morning , Jerry . How's everything ? 
 Doing anything for lunch ? 
 It's awfully hot . 
 It seems a glorious day today . 
 It's beginning to spot . 
 I don't think I'm getting better . 
 I'm still not sure whether I can recover from it . 
 I certainly did . Do you want to come in and give me some feedback about your weekend ? 
 how did the business trip go ? 
 I understand . The last time I went on a business trip with the boss , I didn't even have enough to eat ! 
 our company is quite conscious of the environmental problems that frequent flying causes . 
 I can ask the boss about giving you the day off today . 
 no problem . Did you bring any gifts back for your department ? 
 Hello ! 
 Yes . 
 Just a minute please . Oh , I'm sorry , all the tickets for tonight have been sold out . 
 Oh , you're lucky , there are just two tickets left . Do you want to take them ? 
 OK , your name and telephone number please . 
 Yes , of course . 
 I really like the book you lent me the other day . 
 And thank you very much for letting me keep it so long . 
 Everyone in our class enjoyed it too.It ' s very interesting . 
 Would you mind me keeping it for another three days ? 
 I've got to go home and study . 
 The test tomorrow . 
 How did you first meet ? 
 Was it love at first sight ? Did you fall in love with her the first time you met her ? 
 What is the correct time , please ? 
 When will you lecture begin ? 
 You ’ re a wonderful person , Kathleen . 
 And I ’ m so honored that you would want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasn ’ t truly worthy . 
 Don ’ t , don ’ t , don ’ t , don ’ t say that . That , that makes it worse . 
 You don ’ t love me ? 
 But we ’ re so right for each other . 
 Mary , can you help me set the table ? 
 This is usually my chore . 
 We need to set the table for four . 
 That's right . Mom didn't know where to buy chopsticks for you . 
 Excuse me . would you lend me some wreckers 
 Until Monday or Tuesday next week . 
 Shall we go to cinema this evening ? The new blockbuster starring mel gibson is showing . It ’ s supposed to be really good . 
 It ’ s a thriller . It has Julia Roberts playing the female lead . 
 What did the critic say ? 
 The movie starts at eight o ’ clock , so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready . 
 I won ’ t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . There were a few surprises . 
 Oh I forgot ! I'll run home real quickly and bring you the money . 
 I'd hate for you to think I was lazy in returning your money . 
 I like collecting stamps . 
 Yes , you're right . What do you like to do in your spare time ? 
 Do you play basketball well ? 
 Shall we have a game together some day ? 
 Are you satisfied with the dishes ? 
 I like it , too . I like the fish especially . It's so fresh , and the flavoury is kind of like for a fresh water fish . 
 If you like , I'll take you to a new restaurant next time , I just heard about it from my friend , and he was just raving about it . It's such a great Sichuan cuisine . Would you like to try that ? 
 Great , I love hot food too . 
 You said it . 
 Oh hi Jim . No I just got back . I thought you were on vacation now . 
 Oh wonderful ! Have you been there before or was it your first time ? 
 I'm so jealous of you . I've never been anywhere in Europe . I've always dreamed of traveling around and seeing the sights . 
 That looks like an interesting book . 
 There are the pymeids . It ’ s easy to see how they got that name ! they don ’ t have smooth sides though . 
 Look at that cylindrical office building . I ’ Ve never been seen one that shape before . 
 Tv towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top . They ’ re not perfectly cylindrical . 
 What sports do they play there ? 
 Is that building a perfect cube ? 
 Is says here that it ’ s a war memorial . Now , there ’ s a distinctive structure-the stomium in Brussels . See ? It consists of several connected by cylinders . I believe you can go up and down inside it . 
 I hate to complain , but this soup is too salty . 
 Are the galaxies in the universe moving through space ? 
 But I heard that our Milky way galaxy may one day collide with a neighboring galaxy . If galaxies are moving apart from each other , how can they collide ? 
 Wow , you're really informative . Thanks a lot . 
 Isn ’ t he the best instructor ? I think * he ’ s so hot . Wow ! I really feel energized , don ’ t you ? 
 What ’ s wrong ? Didn ’ t you think it was fun ? ! 
 Oh , no , get off it . It wasn ’ t such a killer class . You just have to get into it . Like they say , no pain , no gain . 
 Look , next time get yourself some comfy shoes . You ’ re gonna come back again with me , aren ’ t you ? 
 Come on . You ’ ll feel better after we hit the showers . 
 But I like its color . 
 I'll take one , too . 
 Yes . I like gardening . 
 Yes , follow me . Here it is . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , I do . 
 I don't . I like the work . 
 Yeah . I just can't find it anywhere . 
 Let's get it back . 
 Morning . Can I help you ? 
 All you need is your student identification card to check out books . 
 Yes . I have three sons . Actually I also have a grandson . 
 I understand . I was in your position before . At that time I couldn ’ t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me . My husband seldom stayed at home . 
 Yes , she did a little . But you see , Americans are different from Chinese . You can ’ t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter . She could baby-sit only once or twice a week . That ’ s it . I had to care for them most of the time . 
 Don ’ t worry . You can take night classes . I did that when I had kids . And soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten . Then you could find a job and work . 
 No . You see , I went back to school to get my Master ’ s Degree when I was in my thirties . You won ’ t be older than that . 
 Hey , Daddy , today I had really a fantastic history class . 
 We've learnt the story of Zheg He Sailing to West Ocean . He is a real great navigator . 
 Yeah , he , with his fleet , came across the Indian Ocean , and arrived at the east coast of Africa . 
 Of course , that is from 1405 to 1433 , which is in Ming dynasty . 
 Not yet , you know I have a lot of homework to do . 
 OK , great Daddy , after supper , I'll embark on it . 
 Is it about Captain Jack Sparrow , who wants to find the treasure on the sea ? 
 I won't tell you , unless you promise to let me watch it with you . 
 Two . French and Spanish . 
 Well , French was my best subject at school . I can read and write it pretty well . 
 Well , it's not as good as my French . I can speak it reasonably well , but my written Spanish isn't very good . 
 In that case , I'm fit for the position I think . 
 So he always sits above the salt when there is a seminar about it . 
 You got it . 
 And he ’ s always busy with his pictures and roses . 
 But as for his business in the city ... 
 He sounds more like an artist than a businessman . 
 Morning , Mike . 
 I ’ Ve already got your certificate for sick-leave . How do you feel today ? 
 Have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ? 
 I will explain it in detail in the next class . Could you preview it ? 
 We'd better leave now . 
 Where are we headed now ? 
 Awesome . Was someone killed there ? 
 Cool ! Is it safe for us to eat there though ? 
 How is everything going with your girlfriend ? 
 Oh , I am sorry to hear that . I did't know that you had split up . What happened ? 
 Really ! Did she tell you why she didn't show up ? 
 What was she thinking ? Did you confront her about it when you saw her ? 
 I can't believe she would do that to you . It's so dishonest-and rude ! 
 I bet you that she regrets what she's done . You are such a good catch ! She really lost out , didn't she ? 
 So I don't think you'll have a problem finding another girlfriend . There are plenty of fish in the sea ! 
 Of course . You see , almost everyone has some kind of hobby . 
 I like taking photos out of doors . 
 Yes , I usually develop and print all my own photos . 
 Yes , simple as it is . It does work . 
 Yes . So what else to do now ? 
 I see . How do you like the game ? 
 Who do you think do better ? 
 Exactly . He is unbelievable . 
 They were really tough . 
 I can't agree more . Okay , time is up . Let's do the last thing . 
 Would you like orchestra seats ? 
 Not unless you want the matinee . 
 Like how ? 
 What did you have in mind ? 
 Do you know how short you want your hair to be ? 
 That's pretty short . Are you sure about this ? 
 I'm going to do it , but you have to be sure you really want me to . 
 Fine then . Let's get started . 
 As far as I'm concerned , staying at home is more comfortable than going to the movies . 
 I am thinking about resigning from my current job . 
 Yes , I have been thinking about it for quite a while . Now I finally make up my mind to leave . I have given my resignation letter to our boss last Friday . 
 Yes , I will move on to XYZ Company . 
 Thanks . I had learned so much from you and our colleagues . 
 Oh , Mike . How are you doing ? 
 Well , I prefer yogurt to all the other drinks . Have you ever tried a kind of yogurt with old milk in it ? It tastes great and very healthy too . 
 Why don ’ t you go ahead of me ? I have more items than you . 
 You ’ re welcome . It was good seeing you again . 
 Hi ! What are you watching ? 
 Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ? 
 Why do they go there ? 
 When muslims pray , they face towards mecca . 
 I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone . 
 Pilgrimages are common in many faiths . 
 Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ? 
 Do you think that there is something magical about that place ? 
 Why do you want to go to the U . S . ? 
 What will you do when you come home ? 
 Do you feel your English is good enough for the course ? 
 Who will be your supporter during your stay in the States ? 
 How long do you expect to stay there ? 
 I don't know what to say . This can't be happening . Here's the obituary . 
 But it explains why Taylor isn't answering and Femi took time off from work . 
 This says the viewing is at Myers Funeral Home today until five . 
 Dear Anna . I really love you . 
 I want to take care of you forever . Will you marry me ? 
 Am I too abrupt ? Did I scare you ? Or you don't want ... 
 Oh , I'm so happy . I will try my best to love you and protect you . I promise . 
 Let me wear you this diamond ring . 
 Balista , pull me a ristretto . 
 It's basically a very strong espresso . Half the water pulled through the same amount of beans . Pure coffee essence . 
 You fiend . It's about the flavor , not the fix . Why don't you just crush some caffeine pills and start doing lines ? 
 Can you tell me something about the Spring Festival ? 
 Christmas is also a special time for us to have the family reunion and to express our best wishes to those we love and those who love us in the coming new year . 
 What are the children doing ? 
 I heard one of the purposes to do it is to frighten the devils so they will not come to do any harm to people in the next year . 
 Who will get the money ? 
 We ’ re going to the movies . Will you join us ? 
 Why not ? 
 Then would you like to have lunch with us ? 
 Would you like me to give you a lift ? 
 Come on . It ’ s no trouble at all . 
 Bob refused all his classmates ' invitation . 
 He is surely a hard nut , nobody likes approaching him . 
 Are your ready to go to the supermarket ? 
 I've got my money and my keys , so I'm ready . 
 It wasn't cold out this morning . 
 Well , I guess we'd better grab our umbrellas then , as well . 
 It does , actually . Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping . 
 Ok . I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . It's a bit chilly in here . 
 I don't know . The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night . 
 I don't think we have anything to worry about . Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ? 
 If I'm not back in ten minutes , come and find me . 
 At the Beijing Olympics , all four table tennis events were all-Chinese finals . A clean sweep again ! 
 Do you know any secrets to China's success ? 
 So , the national ping-pong team must be a highly competitive membership . 
 For example ? 
 Oh , dear ! It's an encroachment on individual rights ! 
 I can ’ t believe my English teacher is making me read pride and prejudice ! 
 But it ’ s so old . 
 No , not at all . 
 I didn ’ t realize it was a romance novel . What ’ s the main storyline ? 
 Why does he want to do that ? 
 Won ’ t they get his inheritance ? 
 I see . This sounds interesting ! Maybe my teacher isn ’ t so horrible after all . 
 There ’ s movie ? My teacher didn ’ t tell me that ! 
 It would take a lot less time ... 
 Ok . That sounds like a deal . 
 Hi , Jenny ! Jason here . It's great to hear your voice again . 
 It's pretty nice , but I'm going to start looking for an apartment soon . Hotel living is not for me . 
 How about you ? When are you leaving for Berkeley ? 
 So soon ! Well , I'd really like to see you again before you leave . Would you like to go out with me on Friday ? I'd like to take you to dinner and maybe a movie or something afterwards . 
 Saturday is fine . I'll make dinner reservations for 7 o ’ clock . Is that ok ? 
 Great . I'll pick you up at six thirty . 
 When do you want to have the open house party ? 
 Friday sounds good . 
 I like that . Then the adults will be more free to mingle and relax . 
 I'm so excited . Finally , a yard of my own . 
 Dad , I'm scared . 
 But , dad , it's stormy outside . 
 Ar ! Dad , the power went out . 
 me . too i like the festival best of all . 
 And special TV programs , fire crackers and the games to play . 
 Such as ... 
 Why ? to welcome the new year of course . 
 Really ? 
 Oh , that's why my parents never scold me that day . they always try to avoid tears and quarrels . 
 What ? No kidding ! 
 I can't believe it ! 
 Yes , she's been like this for two weeks . 
 So am I.The doctor says she'll get over in a month . 
 what's that ? 
 have you read it yet ? 
 go on , read it out loud . 
 when did you send her a letter ? 
 I didn't know anyone did that any more . Ok , go on . 
 that's fine with me . 
 well , skip over all of that and read me the rest . 
 are we going to see them in June or are they coming to see us ? 
 oh , I guess I missed that . 
 Jack , what do you think about the election ? 
 How many people have flung their hats into the ring ? 
 Who do you think will be elected ? 
 I think Mr . White would be elected , you know he has spent millions in this campaign and he blasted the opposition in his campaign speech . 
 May doesn't get along very well with her mother-in-law . 
 Poor John ! He is bettering bother sides of this bread . 
 Can you tell me the time ? I've got an appointment at 8: 30 . 
 Gee ! There's only thirty minutes to go . 
 Me , too . I overheard someone say Taylor has a brain tumor . 
 That could explain all his stomachaches . He's trying to hide it from us . 
 No , but someone said he was in the men's room puking . Follow me ! 
 Hi , Don . What a surprise ! 
 Have you noticed what has changed ? 
 Yes . I ’ m on a diet , but I ’ Ve not taken anything . I just eat less and exercise more . And it really worked in the past three months . I ’ Ve lost twelve pounds . 
 What kind of exercise do you think I do ? I just go to dance everyday after work . I ’ m taking an amateur dance class . I dance two hours everyday . 
 Sure . Join my class next week . 
 I feel like something good to eat . 
 Hey , that sounds a good idea . 
 The pleasure is mine.Happy birthday and many happy returns of the day ! 
 Don't be silly . 
 I'm looking for it , but you see , the market is hard up for jobs , too . 
 I'm sorry , but I can't find the book you lent me . I guess I have lost it . 
 I really feel bad about it . Let me buy you a new one . 
 What's your favorite magazine ? 
 What kind of magazine is it ? 
 Really ? It is a weekly , isn't it ? 
 Does it enjoy popularity among the young generation ? 
 Oh , I think I should try to read one . 
 How are you ? I haven't heard from you in ages . 
 Pretty busy.So are you back for good ? 
 Well , I'm not working on the weekend , so we could grab some beer , ice and our fishing rods , and head out to the river . 
 Same here . 
 Well , some people use a standard set of words , but many couples today write their own wedding vows . 
 It wasn't . It was birdseed . We don't throw rice anymore because someone discovered that birds come along and eat the rice and have trouble digesting it . 
 Wait until you see what happens next ! The bride is getting ready to throw her bouquet . Let's go over and watch . 
 She ’ s my friend ’ s ten-year-old niece . I guess there won ’ t be another wedding in this family for a long time . 
 Whose name did you pick ? 
 Booze ! 
 So , Monica , what do you feel like doing this afternoon ? 
 That ’ s too bad . I hate sand storms too . It can be worse than any kind of bad weather . 
 It is not an easy job . The government is working on it . Lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital . Also , methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought . But of course , it will not work overnight . So , have you come out with a new plan for today ? 
 Hey ! What's up ? 
 Yeah , I've been out of town . 
 Great ! Work is really busy now , but it's fun . 
 I really couldn't understand him . 
 We'd better also leave him alone . 
 It's difficult to explain . 
 Well , I had a terrible day of work , I'm thinking of quiting my job . 
 I don't know , I can't stand my job these days . 
 I give up ! I simply can't learn French ! 
 No , I'm not . I try and try and I still can't speak it very well . 
 Good idea . That might help . 
 That sounds like a good idea . 
 That's fine . I'm looking forward to it . 
 Yes I am . Nice to meet you , Jack . 
 No , I am German . I live in Munich . 
 And did you like it ? 
 And where are you from , Jack ? 
 What are you studying ? 
 Oh , excellent . Why don't we talk in German for a while then ? 
 hi , bob . I ’ m reading a biography ? 
 it ’ s about bob Dylan . 
 he ’ s a famous American musician . 
 it was written by Howard sounds . 
 it ’ s great ! I ’ Ve learned a lot form reading it . 
 sure , bob ! I ’ m on chapter 12 now , so I ’ m almost finished . 
 there are 15 chapters in total . 
 I should be done by Friday . I ’ ll give it to you in class then . 
 no problem . Bob . 
 Take it easy , Jim . Your mother didn't mean it ! Need any help ? 
 Where are you planning on transferring to ? 
 Where do you want to go ? 
 You haven ’ t thought about it ? 
 Why don ’ t you just continue going to PCC ? 
 It ’ s a great school . 
 So , have you made your decision yet ? 
 Any plans tonight ? 
 Well , I am wondering if we took a hang-out for a drink or something . You know , I just came back from a really tough interview . I was quite nervous during the interview . I really want to have the job . Right now , I am still a little on the edge . I am not sure if I could convince them during the interview . 
 I don ’ t know . I think I did well in the paper exams . I was prepared to answer a lot of questions , but they didn ’ t ask those as I expected . To my surprise , the manager tried to talk about the Chinese poesy with me . 
 Just did my best . 
 It's ok . It seems we have a lot in common . 
 He is tall and slim , fair-haired . 
 He is a nice guy and very considerate . I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor . 
 He didn't say , but he said he would call me . 
 Oh , steve . Stop it ! I am a bit nervous ! What if he doesn't call ? 
 Thank you , Steve . You're always so encouraging . 
 In my opinions , someone else has caused the fire of this house . 
 I ’ m not sure now . In any case , let ’ s first make some careful investigations . 
 Yeah . 
 Coffee ? I don ’ t honestly like that kind of stuff . 
 What ’ s wrong with that ? Cigarette is the thing I go crazy for . 
 Thank you for your hospitality , Leon . I had a wonderful time ! 
 David , why didn ’ t you clean the room ? 
 Why are you feeling depressed ? 
 I don ’ t think she will do such a thing . 
 Oh , cheer up . A girlfriend is not everything . 
 Then forgive her mistake . 
 Which university did you graduate from ? 
 When did you graduate ? 
 You are friend of Janet , right ? I am Andrew , Andrew Smith . 
 I'm sorry , I didn't quite catch that . 
 Would you like a cigarette ? 
 Really ? Why ? 
 I see . You mean you don't enjoy smoking any more ? 
 Stop talking like my mother . That's what she keeps saying . 
 What do you mean ? What are you talking about ? 
 Who ? Me ? Could't give up smoking ? Nonsense ! Of course I could ! I know I could ! 
 Because I've already proved it . Smoking's the easiest thing in the world to give up . I've done it hundreds of times ! 
 Just between you and me , I think he's lazy . 
 No , I haven't . 
 It ’ s harmful not only for yourself but for others . 
 Stop producing cigarettes . 
 That ’ s right . But I don ’ t think there are better ways . 
 Maybe it can take effect . 
 Many thanks for your presence . 
 I went to a movie with my boyfriend . 
 It was great . The director took a lot of care while framing . They say be has good chance at winning the Oscar for best director . Also I like the actors , some really great new young actors . 
 Well , it's the classic love story between two people from conflicting backgrounds . But besides a beautiful story , the cinematography is great . There is some really dramatic footage . It's really quite a visual feast . And the soundtrack is moving . 
 The ending is a bit of a surprise . I don't want to ruin it for you . 
 It would be a really good choice . The movie is very suitable for lovers to see together . I'm sure you won't regret it . 
 Sorry , I can ’ t . 
 I ’ d like to . But I ’ m afraid I can ’ t . 
 That ’ s sounds great . 
 No . I ’ d better not . 
 Because I don ’ t think my husband would like it . Thank you for inviting me anyway . 
 No . I ’ m serious . I ’ m going to quit my job . 
 It ’ s true . But I can ’ t show my abilities . 
 Your present job is something better . Why do you change ? 
 All of my friends are going out to the lake tonight and I'm going too ! 
 Hello , Anna speaking ! 
 Jason , where have you been hiding lately ? You know it's been a long time since your last call . Have you been good ? 
 I am fine . What have you been doing ? 
 That's great , congratulations ! 
 That's good . So I guess I'll have to make an appointment to see you . 
 How long have you been working there ? 
 How do you like your new boss ? 
 Much better than the last one , huh ? 
 Forget about him . Come over to my house tonight . Let's get drunk . 
 8 it is . See you then . 
 Shall we go to a movie tonight ? 
 Gone with the Wind . 
 Sorry , I've no idea . 
 What do you mean ? It's because it's much cheaper to buy liquor duty-free . 
 Well , it's because in most countries liquor has a higher tax on it . 
 Yes , of course . Didn't you know that ? 
 Well , it is different in different countries.But it's because of the high tax that buying liquor duty-free is such a good deal . 
 Liquor is considered a luxury item.And also , it is considered as something that isn't very healthy.So if people want to buy it , the government thinks it has the right to tax it . 
 Of course . Cigarettes are also taxed very heavily . 
 Nothing special . 
 Oh , I'd rather not . 
 You know , I am poor at English , especially spoken English . 
 Why are you walking to and fro in the room ? 
 Don ’ t worry . They are grown-ups . 
 Mary , why don't you come to my house this Saturday ? 
 Come on , Mary . This is America . You make your own decisions here . 
 Of course . 
 It's 555-4321 . 
 They must be your parents , what do they do ? 
 Do they often take you out ? 
 I went to the doctor yesterday . 
 I said I had been to the doctor the day before . 
 He said I ' d got the flu . 
 He told me to stay in bed for ten days . 
 Yes , ten days . 
 Same to you . 
 It's such a nice change . 
 Let's just hope it doesn't get cold again . 
 What's its name ? 
 What is it about ? 
 Sounds interesting . 
 Yes , do you have tickets ? 
 Let's go to the theater and buy two tickets now , shall we ? 
 OK . Let's go . 
 I just lost my job . My boss just told me . 
 I don't understand of myself . It seems they have to save money . 
 Your father looks much younger in the picture . 
 How old is he now ? 
 Hello ! Let me introduce myself . My name is Nancy . 
 No , I just started working here at IBM , I am in the sale department . 
 I main market reasearch , and you ? 
 Really ? I don't believe I would met him , is he here now ? 
 Thanks , that's would be lovely.You ' r right , he is kind and nice looking . 
 I register this Friday . 
 I really want to take the communication class , but I don't know if it will be available . 
 Yeah . I tried to get in last semester , but it was full by the time I registered . 
 I still need to take English 201 , but I really don't like writing . 
 Oh really ? Who was the instructor ? There are like 4 different instructors to choose from . 
 Is he an easy grader ? 
 Do you mind if I ask you what you got ? 
 Well , what did you get in English 101 last year ? 
 Well , I can't compare to you . I got a 3.1 in English 101 . That means if you got a lower grade in English 201 , it must be harder . 
 Oh . That helps . Thanks . 
 What is it ? 
 Don't you like to know anything about stocks ? 
 Hello , Green here . 
 Oh , yes . 
 I'll be please to if I can . What can I do for you ? 
 Yes , I think I can help you . Why not you come around and see me ? Do you know my office ? 
 Good , where are you now ? 
 oh , well , that's just a few minutes walk to my office , come around and see me now . 
 Not at all . 
 Oh shame ! I have a class tomorrow . 
 Yeah . Thanks . And have fun ! 
 Nothing special . 
 I'd like to . See you then . 
 Oh , this is over my head . It ’ s too professional . 
 What's your favorite course , Daniel ? 
 Science ? That's a surprise . 
 I thought you would like PE . 
 Are you interested in science ? I can't believe it . 
 Your parents would be happy if they knew that . Because you are always a naughty boy . 
 Hope so . 
 OK , I ’ Ve been looking for a job for days , and I haven ’ t found one yet . It's so hard finding work these days . Have you had any luck ? 
 Are you well paid ? 
 Not bad . 
 That ’ s great ! I ’ ll go there right now and speak with the boss . 
 That was nice of you , Susan . Thanks a lot . 
 Could you tell me a bit more about the work there ? I mean , those dos and don'ts . I am a green hand , you know . 
 Be a yes-man , you mean ? 
 I hope not . 
 Yeah , I didn't get the job in the end . 
 It's ok , that's life . 
 I think we would be able to make it.What time shall we come ? 
 Shall we bring any thing ? Some wine ? 
 Tom , I married Julia last month . Have you already known it ? 
 Indeed , we got married too soon . 
 Yes . However , I believe that marriage comes by destiny . I knew I would marry Julia when I met her at the first time . 
 We're happy together now . 
 Thank you ! 
 Yeah , I really got a lot of the session . The workshop topic was resolving personal problems . It was led by a professional human resources director . The teacher had a lot of experience , and I think we were all given a really good base to start with . 
 It depends on the topic , the teacher , and the way the course is set up . Yesterday , even though we only had a short time to discuss the issues , the workshop got us all thinking . We learned some very basic , but very useful methods of dealing with personnel issues . 
 I did ... I just hope I can implement all these great ideas that we shared . 
 They say he can sum up like winking . 
 Maybe he's gifted in that . 
 What ? 
 What ! ? It'll be a miracle if we're ready by the end of the month ! Is she crazy ? 
 Crazy is too kind . Insane is more like it . Nuts ! Wacko ! Psycho ! 
 Sure.thanks . 
 I ’ m terribly sorry to cause you so much trouble . 
 Do you know where Helen is ? 
 That reminds me . My wedding anniversary is tomorrow . 
 I like baseball the best . 
 Yeah . I played until I graduated from high school . 
 I think I tried every position , but the last few years , I played third base . 
 It was scary at first , but after awhile , I got used to it . If you have fast reflexes , then it's not really a problem . What position did you play ? 
 I wish I could play again , but there isn't much opportunities around here . 
 When do you guys play ? 
 Sounds pretty fun . I'll come out and join you next time . 
 That is just wishful thinking . The cost of higher education has increased in recent years , faster than the cost of living . So she wants Jane's brother to go on studying and earn his doctorate by means of it . 
 I'm back . 
 Going shopping . It tires me too much . 
 Can I ? 
 OK . What does it sell ? 
 That's great . 
 Not much , just heading over to the shooting range . You wanna come ? 
 Yeah , it will be fun ! I have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . I also have a revolver that ’ s really fun too ! They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve you 
 Whoa , take it easy there Rambo . Don ’ t get carried away . These weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be 
 The reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! So are you ready ? 
 I went out with Leo last night . It was really exciting . 
 Yes , I know . He's really on the A-list . 
 It's picture association of the concept that the professor taught today . 
 I don't really know for sure yet . I'll tell you after the test on Friday . 
 I was told once that the more time you spend writing , the less you are paying attention and so you miss stuff . 
 One time I tried just listening , no notes , no pictures . I think I really learned more that day . 
 It will be a rock and roll band probably . He ’ s a very good guitarist . 
 I can play drums , but I haven ’ t played for a while . I ’ m not sure I ’ d be good enough to play in a band . 
 Nowadays , you can be a DJ . You can mix dance music . You don't need to be able to play music instrument or thing . 
 You know , you could probably get a computer program that would help you . You already have a computer , so you could use that to help you mix some music . 
 It's one of the highlights of the match . 
 The wonderful passing Melaena did . 
 Susan has been down recently . I saw her this morning , she looked terrible ! 
 She broke up with her boyfriend . 
 She still loves him . That's why she feels upset . Her love is always hard and confusing ... 
 He sometimes really drives me crazy . 
 Yes , it's a family tradition dating back to my childhood . We use the same lights and ornaments , but of course we have a new tree each year.The children made some of these decorations . Here , you can hang this on one of those high branches . 
 Oh , yes . The kids are too excited to wait . After we clean up the mess all the empty boxes and the wrapping paper we have a big breakfast . Then the kids have the whole day to play with their new toys . 
 Has your family lived here for long ? 
 You have a fantastic view . 
 Look ! You can see the village way down in the valley . 
 Hi , Mary . I haven't seen you in ages ! I heard that you and Daniel are getting married on August 8th , the opening day of the 2008 Olympic Games . Is it true ? 
 good for you ! It sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time . 
 is everything ready now ? 
 have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job . 
 it's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . 
 I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available . 
 my pleasure . 
 You moved to a new place ? 
 Thank you for inviting me . Sounds lovely ! I would like to come . Where is your new apartment ? 
 Who else will come ? 
 Ok , I will be there around 6 . Is that ok for you ? 
 What are you doing over the weekend , Sara ? 
 I want to go camping , you know , just get a way for the weekend . I'm not sure I'll be able to , though . 
 Well , I have a lot of work . I'll see how to goes . 
 I'm here on business . 
 Yes . He is an old man with a great sense of humour . Not only can he play the piano , he also draws pictures very well . 
 Yeah , he has no children , so he sometimes feel s very lonely . I often go to his house to play and talk with him . That makes him feel very happy . 
 Thank you . Same to you . 
 I've been invited over to a friend's , and you ? 
 I can't wait to go skiing tomorrow . 
 I always get excited the day before . 
 I only go skiing twice a year , so it's a real treat for me . 
 What things make you excited ? 
 Oh ... that makes me excited too ! 
 I heard you are busy with your new house now ? 
 Let meet this right — — do you want to buy the house ? 
 But it is far from downtown . Living here is very inconvenient . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 Did you check our database to see if it was on the shelf ? 
 Is it on the shelf ? 
 Apparently somebody took that book out of the library . 
 We will definitely be getting another . 
 That won ’ t be a problem . 
 When can we expect you and your daughter for dinner ? Next Saturday ? 
 How about Sunday then ? 
 Does six thirty suit you ? 
 Thanks , goodbye . 
 What can I help you with ? 
 Do you know what building that it's in ? 
 Well , that's not far away . 
 Do you know what the room number is ? 
 My next class is around there . 
 Sure , let's go . 
 What do you think is wrong , the math or the way your answer was scored ? 
 I am willing to take a second look because teachers make mistakes , too . Will that work for you ? 
 Check your answers against the ones on the answer sheet and let me know where you see the mistake . 
 Yes , I agree ; let's move on to the calculating of the score . Would that be OK ? 
 We add all of these up and divide by this and that gives us this percentage . 
 Anytime you have a question , please feel free to ask ! 
 Get a hold of yourself , Bruce . You'll get over her eventually . 
 Are you sure ? He is quite young , isn't he ? 
 Really ? He looks so young . 
 Sure , When is good time for you ? 
 What time do you want me there ? 
 All right , It's a date . 
 Oh , about two years now . 
 They still live in Shanghai where I was born . 
 Yes , I try to keep in touch with them . 
 You've got no guts ! 
 My name is Jessica . What's yours ? 
 You speak English very well . 
 Do you know what time it is ? 
 What did you say ? 
 Thanks . 
 Japanese is easy to learn . 
 I don't think so.There ' re so many familiar characters and they sound just like Chinese . 
 Today people are hearing about information superhighways and the intermet . 
 Yes , I think so . My friend once used it mostly to play chess , but now he has learnt how to do other things on the Internet . 
 That's true . I can imagine companies sending advertisements directly to customers over the net . Customers , in turn , can examine and compare whatever goods they want to buy and tell their computers to find them at the best price offered . 
 What ’ s the problem ? Things are getting out of hand . You keep sticking your nose where it doesn ’ t belong . 
 Now , I am responsible for training new staff , but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods . I know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove . But I don ’ t like your way . 
 It was so fantastic I didn ’ t really want to come home . 
 How did you know ? 
 His name is Tony and we met my first night in Pathos . He works with my sister who lives there . 
 Not really . I wasn ’ t looking for a holiday romance , but my sister told me that she had promised him that she ’ d set him up on blind date with me . I didn ’ t think I ’ d have anything to lose , so I went . 
 Let ’ s just say that by the third date , we both realized that we had fallen in love . 
 Luckily , his company has a position available here , so he ’ s going to see if he can get relocated . 
 Well , I ’ m not really a spring chicken anymore . We don ’ t know what will happen . 
 Yes , I ’ m afraid I am . My husband is a smoker too . 
 No . But my husband smokes 20 or more a day . 
 I had my first cigarette when I was 17 . 
 Yes . Twice . 
 I ’ d like to go into management . I ’ Ve applied for several jobs already and I ’ m hopeful that I ’ ll get some job offers . How about you ? 
 we both have to overcome several obstacles if we are to achieve our ambitions . 
 unfortunately , it ’ s inevitable that some people are going to work hard yet not succeed . 
 as long as you plan carefully , most thing are possible . It ’ s always good to have a backup plan in case things go wrong . 
 my father wanted me to become a doctor , but I knew it would be impossible for me to be successful in that field . 
 Hey , Susie , what health club do you belong to ? 
 Well , I ’ Ve been going to Athletic Express , but I don ’ t like it there . 
 The people don ’ t really work out there . They just stand around and talk all the time . 
 Yeah , is your club different ? 
 Do they have a lot of equipment ? 
 Sounds nice . What about classes ? 
 Wow , that sounds great . 
 Really ? Thanks . I ’ ll stop by when I get off work . 
 O . K . , see you . 
 Yes , I've just come back from Scotland . 
 I only had time to visit Edinburgh . 
 It's fantastic . 
 I went there on business . 
 Yes , a lot of friends . 
 Yes , and I look many pictures . 
 No , I only know four great beauties of China . 
 Yeah ? Were they famous because of the ugliness ? 
 Then who were they ? 
 It seems that the inner beauty is also important . 
 I wonder how Sarah and Mat are . 
 I'm not surprised . She's a plain Jane . 
 What's up ? You look depressed . 
 Would you rather I taught him a lesson for you ? 
 Nowadays , ships and boats are no longer so important in transportation as they used to be . 
 I read in the newspapers that the passenger liners from Shanghai to Ningpo and Dalian have been out of business ; and the liners up and down the Yangtze River have been reduced by 70 % . 
 But the most of the transoceanic cargo transportation is still carried by boat . 
 Don't be that negative . 
 I find it there is no meaning in living this world . 
 Really , life is so boring . 
 I booked a table yesterday . 
 Smith . 
 I'm so glad that the Spring Festival is near at hand . 
 Think of the big face down the eve , hmm . 
 Hey , do you know any mystery belief serve the festival ? 
 You know why fire crackers are set off in festival . 
 And also to frighten away evil spirits . 
 And my parents say the whole year will be as good or as bad as new year day itself and bad or rude words on the day will bring a bad year . 
 Mom , did you feel the earthquake this afternoon ? 
 The breaking news just reported some houses were destroyed by the earthquake . 
 Do you think we can donate some clothes and food for the victims ? 
 It's really late but I'm starving . 
 Maybe they have some good pie . 
 There was a coffee shop by my house when I was a kid that served cinnamon hot chocolate . 
 Good stuff ... Oh , no . The door is locked . 
 How have you been ? 
 And how ’ s everyone in your family ? 
 I ’ d love to but I ’ m afraid I can ’ t . I ’ Ve already got a lunch engagement . 
 It was all right . She , tall and attractive , has stable job and source of income . 
 But , well ... what I want to say is ... 
 Her standard for selecting life partner is a little higher . I can not accept that . 
 She said she want a man with large house , luxurious car and healthy parents . 
 I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat . ( looking around for him ) oh , there he is . 
 Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true . 
 what a bummer ! You set me up ? 
 how dare you ! 
 why did you lie to me in the email ? 
 I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me . 
 How beautiful the flower is ! 
 You like it . Well , I'll gather in for you . 
 Where it is ? 
 I love that vase . 
 Yes , it looks perfect . 
 That's amazing ! 
 Five days a week , too ? 
 Gosh ! 
 Where are you going now ? 
 When do you start school ? 
 That's good . 
 Well , flying kites is more fun to me . 
 Let's go and buy one . 
 I suspect it's unavoidable . 
 Yeah . She married him at her mother's bidding . 
 well , I nearly always get up at dawn . I don ’ t like sleeping in late . The days are longer in summer that in winter , so I get up in summer . I usually do some exercise when I get up . 
 I usually have cereal , but sometimes I cook a traditional English breakfast . 
 I usually do housework in mornings . I go shopping occasionally . I like to do all my shopping in one bag trip to the supermarket . I always drive to the big supermarket in the city center . It takes about 
 I usually meet some friends and we play sports together or I might spend some time alone on my hobbies . I spend winter evening watching tv , but I spend summer evening at cultural events if I have time 
 What ? 
 Huh ? Oh , my name is Laura . 
 Huh ? I can ’ t hear you , the music ’ s too loud . 
 Hold on , my ears are still ringing from the music ... what was it you asked me ? 
 Sometimes , usually once every few weeks . Do you ? 
 I usually come with a group of friends . We dance a little , have a few drinks , and just have a good time . 
 That ’ s good . It ’ s good to hit the books , but you need to get out once in a while . 
 People are funny . 
 Did you hear about the pilot ? 
 Yes , he stole a plane in Canada and flew into the U . S . 
 Yes . After two U . S . fighter jets followed him for an hour , he landed on a highway . 
 No , he just landed the plane and walked to a restaurant . 
 His life sucked . He was hoping a fighter jet would shoot him down . 
 When he told me I had to work overtime , that was it . 
 Yes , he's really pushed me too far . 
 You're going to Shanghai tomorrow , are you ? 
 It might be . You'd better take a heavy sweater with you.The nights are usually quite cold at this time of year . 
 Not for now , I think , But I believe there'll be rain , so take your raincoat with you . 
 Yes , I watched United play Chelsea . What a fierce battle ! allay were engaged in intensive pressing and tackling in midfield . Well , it was not like a normal English League match . 
 Haha . That's probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common , and offsides more frequent in English League matches than those on the Continent . And the ball is often kept flying overhead , drawing beautiful curves in the sky . Such games are quite pleasing to the eye . 
 I'm a firm United supporter . I like their playing style . The Reds always have several excellent wing-backs , Like Riggs , Peckham and Gary Neville . They often make wonderful crosses when they assist in attacking . 
 I'd like to purchase a parking permit for next semester . 
 I am a daytime student . 
 I will be driving my car . 
 I'll pay for it with a check . 
 No , thanks ; I'm fine . 
 What's your major in college ? 
 What research are you dealing with now ? 
 Would you like to go to a concert with me ? 
 Good morning , Miss Li . 
 I'm sorry that I was absent yesterday . 
 I feel much better now . 
 I've already got it . Thanks . 
 I will . 
 Well , you can just see the sea . Between the factory chimneys . 
 Well , it can't be helped . We'll just have to put up with it . 
 Yeah . 
 Yes . I bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted . 
 Partly , and he's also a hard working man . 
 It ’ s big and exciting but noisy . 
 You can see the Forbidden City . 
 It ’ s beautiful but crowded . 
 Yes . Have you ever been in one of his classes ? 
 He was a very easy teacher . Are you thinking of taking a class with him ? 
 Grades are important , but don't you think that gaining the knowledge is important , too ? 
 He made everything so interesting that the time just flew by . Do you know what I mean ? 
 Did you know that he came here last year after 10 years in the military ? 
 I think you know that you have to make the best decision for you . Enjoy your year ! 
 Not bad at all . 
 Just one moment . I'll check with the cancer ward desk . 
 Ma'am , I'm sorry . The cancer ward said Mr . Smith passed away two days ago . 
 Yes , ma'am . He died from complications of stomach cancer . I'm very sorry . 
 I have something really cool to tell you about ! Do you know anything about online auctions ? 
 They're awesome ! I was browsing through the eBay auction today , and I found the cutest fat little copper Buddha ! It's over a hundred years old . 
 Why not ? 
 Excuse me . May I ask you some questions ? 
 Could you please tell me how many credits would be required for a bachelor's degree ? 
 OK . And how long does it take to get a bachelor's degree ? 
 I see . Thank you very much . 
 I have failed in my final examination . What can I do now ? 
 Would you like to go to a concert tonight ? 
 All right , then.There is one at the new concert hall . 
 It's the Powell orchestra . 
 They're doing a seventeenth-century program . 
 Well , I'm not sure of his name , but I know it's going to be his farewell performance . 
 I need to be motivated , Vince.Multi - motivated . As in multi-million . 
 Ever hear of WebTracker ? 
 I might make nothing even if I stay . For that kind of risk , I want to get rich . 
 Shall I get you another cup of coffee ? 
 Shall I make more sandwiches ? 
 We're in big trouble , Jason . Nick is beating us by a long shot . 
 OK , comeback kid . Here's you last question.How many times did Robin Williams win the Oscar for Best Actor ? 
 Nope , sorry ! Actually , Robin Williams has never won an Oscar for Best Actor--only for Best Supporting Actor ! 
 You're not the only one with a lot to do . We are all in the same boat . 
 I may have something on that day , but thanks for inviting me . 
 I will , do you want me to bring anything ? 
 Please help yourself to whatever you like , don't be shy . 
 This dish tastes terrific . Would you like to try a little ? It is a little hot , but very good . 
 Would you like another beer ? 
 Come on , it's the weekend . Let's taste and enjoy this meal . Cheers ! 
 Hi , Bob , everything okay ? 
 oh ? What's that ? 
 what gift ? 
 you refused the gift ? That's terrible . 
 perhaps . He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade . 
 It is so quiet here . I like the place . 
 I can't stand the loud noise in the city . 
 I hope I can stay here longer . 
 The day after tomorrow . 
 Yes , you are right . 
 I have no idea . To be honest , I couldn't care less . 
 Just the two of you ? 
 Where did you go ? 
 True ? The food is terrible . 
 Really ? 
 Almost . I have to get dressed . It's a formal party and I have special party make up ! 
 Great ! Uh , remember that there's a gift exchange , too . We all have to bring a gift . 
 ( At the Party ) It's Christmas Eve ! Time to open presents ! 
 Wow ! It's just what I wanted ! 
 Hi , Mike , what gives ? 
 Hey , great set of wheels . 
 Who wouldn't ? Wow , that's out of this world . 
 Yeah , too cool . How much did they sold you for ? 
 I can imagine . 
 I'd love to . 
 Good afternoon . 
 Thank you . 
 It ’ s half past twelve . 
 From one to two . 
 We usually go to the cafeteria . 
 let ’ s go together . 
 Not at all . 
 You are welcome at any time . 
 You are most welcome . 
 Call us as soon as you got home . 
 I've no idea . I'd like to listen to your suggestion . 
 Well , I'll try gin and tonic . 
 Don't count on it . 
 Actually , I was watching your auction all along . I saw you drop out at $ 250 . 
 I watched Buddha buyer go up to $ 315 . I waited until the very last minute and then I jumped in at $ 325 ! I sniped him ! 
 Do you mind if I borrow the notes from last week ? 
 I was unable to make it . 
 I was sick that day , and couldn't make it . 
 Are there any more ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Do you have any habits such as smoking ? 
 What kind of winter sport do you like best ? 
 What do you like doing in your spare time ? 
 Do you have any hobbies ? 
 I wonder if it is possible that we organize a dinner party for all the colleagues in our departments . They are working very hard these days . Maybe it is time for everybody to relax a little . 
 Well , what about this Thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ? 
 I hope so . Let me know how many will come . Then I will book the restaurant . 
 As a matter of fact , I am . 
 No . I transferred here from a different school . 
 I transferred here from PCC . 
 I really like it here so far . 
 I like PCC better . 
 I graduated and I'am working towards my next degree . 
 I haven't decided yet . 
 Ok , count me in . 
 Yes , I'm sure I've been here before . 
 Yes , there's that bar we passed an hour ago . 
 That would be great . I am really in the mood for a spicy hotpot . Any special reason for the invitation ? 
 It was my pleasure . How about this evening ? I feel very hungry now . 
 Ok with me . You are the boss . I will meet you downstairs after work . 
 70 hours ? I would be dead if I worked hard like that . 
 It is really gorgeous out today . I remembered the weatherman said it is supposed to rain . 
 Really ? That's unusual for October , isn't it ? 
 Yes , that's true . Still , it's hard to believe . Yesterday our high was only 50 degrees Fahrenheit . 
 Maybe you can pick Mary ’ s brains now . She knows a lot about stocks . 
 Hello , is it necessary to do warm-up exercise ? I can't wait to dive into the water . 
 Yeah , I see . You are just doing your job . But I wanna know what the advantages it has . 
 As far as I know , people will be weak if they swim too long . 
 Is it very dangerous ? I'm a little scared . Do you offer the lifebuoy for us ? 
 Do you have the workers to save me if anything should happen ? 
 Do you feel better ? 
 Don ’ t be sad . Everything will be fine . 
 Do you have the time ? 
 It's a perfect day for swimming . 
 Great ! I love swimming . Besides , I need a tan for Hill ’ s party .. 
 No . Thanks for reminding me . 
 Why do I need to do that ? 
 Oh , my goodness . Who do I need to talk to ? 
 Absolutely . I think I still have the boarding passes from our flight here somewhere . 
 Since 911 I think every airline requires that the passengers show ID to board . 
 Neither.The game ended in two all . 
 But the Brazilian is tougher . 
 I love to dance the fast music . 
 Yes , it's my favorite . 
 You're a good dancer . 
 Sorry . I feel like sitting out the next dance . 
 Good idea . 
 Yeah . I bet you did forget everything . What's the date today , do you know ? 
 I heard that Kevin got divorced . Is that true ? 
 What ? 
 Poor Kevin , we should do something for him . He is a nice guy and does his job well . 
 Good morning , Miss Wu ! Can I ask you something ? 
 Tomorrow is my wife's birthday . We both love spicy Chinese dishes . I am wondering if you could recommend a good local restaurant where I can find some good spicy dishes . 
 How far is it from here ? 
 Great . We'll go and have a try . Thank you very much . 
 Thank you . The same to you . 
 No . Have a seat . 
 That sounds good but I don ’ t know what ’ s on . 
 Ok , that ’ s a good idea . Where shall we meet ? 
 That sounds good . I ’ ll call you once I arrive . 
 We'll first go to Mount Tai , then we'll go to Sichuan by air , after that we'll be leaving for Tibet . 
 At least 20 days . 
 What are you talking about ? Where is your Halloween spirit ? Didn ’ t you ever dress up in a costume and go around the neighborhood trick-or-treating with your friends ? 
 Whatever , I ’ m going next door I heard Mrs . Robinson is giving out big bags of M & Ms ! 
 What were you thinking ? 
 What would you like me to do ? 
 How short ? 
 Do you really want it that short ? 
 If you really want me to , then I'll do it . 
 Let's do it . 
 Yes , we are . 
 In the spring . 
 Well .. we're not sure yet , probably in St.Albans . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 We're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in South London . 
 Yes , probably but I may look for another one when we're settled in . 
 Thank you , Peter . 
 Happy birthday , Peter , and many happy returns of the day . Here's a present for you . 
 What wish do you make ? 
 Which service offered by your bank do you use most ? 
 Do you ever ask you bank for traveller ’ s cheques ? They are much safer than carrying lots of cash around . 
 Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills ? I use direct debit . 
 That ’ s good idea . You don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . I suppose you have a mortgage too . 
 I have a deposit account with my bank . There are some restrictions on withdrawing money , but the interest rate is much higher . 
 That ’ s great . But I prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain . 
 Well , going to a cinema , visiting the galleries , exhibitions and museums , finding and meeting old friends , exercising in the health club or mountain biking . There are so many good choices . 
 Why not start with the most interesting one ? 
 Toss a coin to decide then . 
 Which John ? Mr.Turnbow ’ s son ? 
 And he ’ s bright and intelligent . I ’ m sure he can pass the university entrance exam . 
 How ’ s your boy , Jack ? 
 Poor boys ! They work harder at school nowadays , don ’ t they ? 
 You're from New York , aren't you ? 
 What do you suggest I should see in New York ? 
 No , I don't like museums.They ' re boring . 
 Ah ! That sounds interesting . 
 No , not really . Why do you ask ? 
 You saw a ghost ? When ? 
 So that's where you saw the ghost ? In your house ? What did it look like ? Was it hideous ? 
 So what did you do ? 
 Until what ? What happened ? Did you see it clearly ? Did it attack you ? 
 Are you getting overtime ? 
 Have you thought about another job ? 
 I bought it . I got a watch , too . The company that sells this car has a car club . 
 Yeah , and meet other drivers of the same car ! 
 I know girls love this kind of car . Look , it's got a sunroof ! Imagine ... a cool , starry night ... 
 No . I borrowed it to go shopping . 
 Yeah . It is not easy for them to find another job . 
 It is strange that some people are quitting their jobs in order to find a better one . What do you think ? Do you want to quit your job ? 
 Hello , Ms . Barkley . How are you ? 
 Good to see you again , too . How ’ s you family ? 
 Mike's really angry . 
 Oh my god ! It's 10:00 pm . I have to go . 
 I am afraid not . 
 Thank you . Well , if you ever pass my home , please drop in . 
 Yes , sure . Have a sweet dream ! 
 But I think it's fantastic and charming . Well , you have your opinion and I have mine . 
 Come on . I don't see any point in arguing about this . Everyone has a right to his own opinion . 
 Thank you . I have roses , tulips , and daffodils . Do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers ? 
 Yes , they are . This afternoon , I ’ m going to prune the hedge . 
 Thank you ! That would be very kind of you . I have a saw in the garden shed . 
 Tomorrow , I ’ ll cut the grass . Then the garden will look perfect . 
 Listen to this . Mary got married . 
 Yes . Yesterday . 
 She married Jerrod . 
 She ’ s going to live in Paris . 
 I've been accepted by the university , and they've offered me a position on the basketball team ! 
 Do you feel all right ? You look Pale . 
 Have you taken your temperature ? 
 How long have you been feeling this way ? 
 Oh , probably you've been working too hard . 
 What a terrible house ! 
 The door bell doesn't work , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart . 
 Sure . 
 As in many countries , there ’ s been a big growth in anything related to computers . Young people are attracted to that field in particular . There ’ s also been a big growth in education . 
 The interesting thing is that many of the teachers are not actually trained teachers . They are usually professionals who are taking a break from their jobs to pass on skills to others . 
 In my country , they are usually studying something business-related , such as marketing , management techniques , and human resource management . 
 That trend has already begun in my country . In particular , there ’ s a big demand for people to work in fitness centers . Which kinds of jobs are less in demand ? 
 Yes . My country is certainly expanding in the service and hi-tech sectors , but contracting in the heavy industry and primary industry sectors . However , our car and aircraft manufacturers are doing very well . 
 Hi , Ben . Here are the top ten of this week's top chart . 
 Which is your favorite in this ten ? 
 You mean Sweet Heart . 
 What do you think about Cold Wind ? 
 So No . 4 is your favorite . Which one don't you like ? 
 Why ? 
 Really ? But it's my favorite . 
 not really . Sometimes , I even let other people make key decision for me . 
 there are basic decisions like which restaurant to go to . I can never seem to choose . I let my parents make big decisions for me . They chose my university and my course . I ended up studying something 
 that ’ s a good idea . You ’ re very decisive , I ’ Ve noticed . So , which bar are we going to this evening ? 
 ok , i choose luckies . 
 Old Dyson looks as if he maybe kick the bucket any day . 
 I ’ Ve ever seen a living being looked so thin . 
 Maybe you are right . 
 Sure , it's easy . First of all , the secret to a successful oral presentation is to keep things simple . People are listening and they usually don't have a long attention spans . Stick to about three or four points , give an overview of the points , then present them one by one , and then summarize at the end . Be straightforward and organized and you're sure to be remembered . 
 You should consider the size and interests of your audience . In other words , who is listening , and what do they want to hear ... you can put together a PPT with some graphics and animations that will catch people's attention , but be careful not to go overboard . 
 You know , stage fright is very normal , most people get nervous before they have to speak in front of large groups . Just prepare well , rehearse beforehand , and trust that you will be great ... and you will be ! 
 Wow ! Sure ! 
 Oh ... that's OK ... as long as you're buying ! 
 I'd love to help if I can . 
 Wow ! Just the idea of going back to school fills my head with pain . 
 Yeah , I'd have to say it has . But I'm still paying for it , you know . 
 Well , getting a Doctorate degree would mean close to a decade of school . Can you afford that ? Can you survive that ? 
 I think you need to separate the dream of having a PhD from the reality of years of more schooling . It's not as romantic as you might think . 
 Uh huh , that's for sure . You might find that your only career choice is teaching other graduate students . 
 Of course not , we'd be happy if you could come.What time will you be able to come ? 
 Fine.We ' ll be expecting you . 
 Oh , I'm a little busy these days . 
 Don ’ t you know Christmas is coming ? I have a lot of things to get ready . 
 Yeah , so I have to buy presents for everyone before I leave . 
 Americans don ’ t like giving money , they prefer presents you buy for them . So I have to figure out what to buy for all of my family and friends . 
 I will . Merry Christmas . 
 I have exactly the same feeling . This afternoon he explained the ins and outs of the stock market to me . He knows a lot about investments . 
 My family is not big , there are only 3 of us-my parents and I . 
 My father supports the family , and he is the sole breadwinner . My mother is a housewife . 
 Yes , we live a happy life together . 
 Yeah of course ! Although , don ’ t you ever wonder what “ could have been ” ? 
 Well , sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently . 
 Like for example , if I hadn ’ t studied architecture , I would have become an artist like I wanted to . 
 You see ! Everything happens for a reason ! We wouldn ’ t even have met if I hadn ’ t been in that car accident ten years ago ! 
 I ’ ll drink to that ! 
 I asked you if you wanted some help . 
 Certainly . What's your topic ? 
 All right . You can use the computer over there , enter ' tropical fish'under subject . If you know the title of the book , enter it under ' title ' 
 You are welcome . 
 At least you haven't landed in the water yet . I've done that on the last two holes . 
 Here you go . I'll wait for you to get on the green before I putt . 
 No way , Mary . I'm going to let you go first . I don't want the pressure of putting first . 
 oh , it is really far from here . You ’ re going in the wrong direction actually . 
 it doesn ’ t matter . Go back the way you came . After about five kilometers , you ’ ll see a hotel on the side of the road . It ’ s a big one . You can ’ t miss it . 
 take the next right . Drive about one click further , and you ’ ll see the entrance of the highway to the Great Wall . 
 you ’ re welcome . 
 without traffic , it takes about an hour . 
 yes , I think so . It doesn ’ t close until 5 o ’ clock . You still have plenty of time . 
 my pleasure , and have a good time ! 
 Can't complain . What about you ? 
 I've heard . She looks quite depressed . 
 I heard they were just married for 5 months . 
 Yeah . Mixed marriage is tempting but crisis-ridden . 
 Maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married . 
 Definitely . That's why many cross-cultural marriages end in divorce . 
 That's true.Just hope Wendy can recover from the pain of divorce soon . 
 hi , Andy , how are you finding your new job ? 
 that's nice . What do they have you doing over there ? 
 that ' s really good . It's very important to feel like you are part of the team at work . 
 that's great , that's good for a positive work environment and helps motivate employees . I wish my boss was like that . 
 well , now you don't have to worry about that . This new place sounds really good . 
 I heard you're getting married , James . Congratulations ! 
 I'm looking forward to it . 
 It's so pleasant after the bad weather we've been having . 
 All right.Let ' s go . 
 No , I'm scared of cats . 
 I feel they're dirty . 
 Really ? I ’ m not sure that I would like all the attention . There have been numerous cases of paparazzi interfering with star ’ s private live in recent years . 
 I wouldn ’ t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice , but it would get tedious after a while . Imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you . 
 I think you ’ ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . You ’ d also have to be very careful about every word you said . If you appeared on a chat show and said something silly , it 
 That ’ s a great idea . Which charities would you support ? 
 You ’ d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity , so you ’ d really need to be very careful . Anyway , I ’ d be the first to buy your posters and I ’ d attend your first book - 
 It's terrible how things have changed.You remember there used to be trees on all these hills . 
 No , they've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away . 
 Yes , I can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds.But nowadays you just don't see the birds that you used to see around here . 
 No , I'm not clear . 
 Don't make a fuss.The price is rising 
 I live in the southern part of this city . I rent a house . 
 No , I don't . 
 Oh , I forgot to tell you this . The show is to collect money for children in need . And all the money from ticket selling will go to the Red Cross . 
 Good idea . 
 A lot of stars , including Andy , Justin , Mendy ... 
 Me too . She is so young and talented . She is not only a singer but also a great composer herself . 
 She is a real star . Not a onetime thing . 
 Well , I suppose people have different tastes on music . Moreover , here stuff is really strong and creative . It takes time for people to accept new things . 
 Sure . That makes a good fan . Do you know what songs she is gonna sing tonight ? 
 OK . 
 Photograph . 
 Olympus . 
 No , usually I get my films developed at a photo studio , but I make my own enlargements . 
 Because I can make many different kinds of pictures from one negative . That's more , but that saves money . 
 Thanks , June . But I think I need to be certified as a mechanic 5 before I ’ m allowed to repair cars for a living . 
 I guess I never thought of that before . 
 Wow , you ’ Ve inspired me to do something ! 
 It's a huge headache . I have no idea what I want to do . 
 It should be , but there are too many options . My grades are good enough that I have a lot of choices , but after that ... 
 Yup , you understand . And my parents are trying to pressure me into going to a Catholic college . They both attended one and think that it combines a good education with good discipline . And the tuition is usually pretty low . 
 Thanks for the information . And good luck in your college search . 
 Why do you say that ? 
 Oh , I see . She told me that she had learned very quickly how to pour oil on troubled waters , but not to pour oil on the flame . 
 I haven't met you at the gym for a long time . 
 why ? You have a decent salary , lots of promotion opportunities and a regular life of going to the office at 9 o ' clock and coming back home at 5 in the evening . 
 then SOHO is your ideal work style . 
 and you don't have to work under that much pressure and control . 
 sounds great . Are there many business opportunity ? 
 it's good to have business around . But you should also do some exercise to keep fit . 
 What did you say when she told you the news ? 
 But I put my foot down and insisted on her forgetting that . 
 Can I borrow some money from you ? 
 How do your spend your time after work or in vacation ? 
 But traveling is an expensive hobby , isn't it ? 
 I really have a good time here.Thank you very much . 
 I promise . 
 Is she coming ? 
 They are announcing your flight . You'd better board the plane . 
 I am just reminding you about the time . You don't want to miss the plane , do you ? 
 Name it and I'll do it for you . 
 I've got it . 
 I am just doing what I think I should do . 
 This isn't like you ... Well , I hope you will have a nice flight and a successful start in business . 
 What's the weather today ? 
 What was the weather like yesterday ? 
 What will the weather be like tomorrow ? 
 Tom's new business will do well . 
 Hi , Charlie ! What are you reading ? 
 Who ’ s it about ? 
 Who is he ? 
 Who ’ s the author ? 
 What do you think about it ? 
 Can I read it when you ’ re done ? 
 How many chapters does the book have ? 
 When do you think you ’ ll have finished reading it ? 
 Thanks . Charlie ! 
 How are you getting along with your wife now ? 
 What are you going to do then ? 
 How are your work now ? 
 I've been thinking about getting my hair cut . 
 I said that , didn't I ? But I just don't know what to do with it . 
 Yes , it's not short enough to be wash-and-go and not long enough to do anything fancy . 
 Everywhere I go ? 
 Didn't you say you were planning a trip to China ? I heard the northwest and north of China are experiencing severe sandstorms ! 
 Definitely . I heard Beijing was experiencing seven degree strong winds ! That is nearly a record high ! 
 Absolutely ! I don't think any planes are going anywhere . The sand being blown around has cut visibility in Beijing to less than 100 meters . But inseems Gansu Province is being hit the hardest . 
 Well , this storm originated in the plateaus in northwest China . At the moment , that area is calmer . 
 I don't know . You know what they say about office romances . 
 They say you shouldn't mix love and work . 
 You ’ Ve got a point . Once I dated one of my supervisors and all of my co-workers accused him of favoritism . Then when the relationship went bad , he fired me . 
 That may be true , but I don't want an inter-office relationship to affect my productivity . 
 You are sounding like we are already married . 
 Well , I don't feel right about it . 
 Most starts with dinner , but then it gets out of hand . Besides , haven't you asked out every woman in the entire office ? 
 Company ? I heard about you from Linda . She said you were an octopus ! 
 Well , I hope you can find something else to be passionate about . 
 In your dreams . Now if you don't mind , I've got some work to do . 
 I ’ m looking forward to relaxing this coming weekend . 
 How might you spend the weekend . 
 I might do that too . I hope the weather is nice . I could go and play some golf . 
 Hopefully , we ’ ll both have relaxing weekends . 
 Unfortunately , there ’ s always the possibility of some urgent work requiring our attention . 
 Not every day , but occasionally . 
 I don't believe ads.What ' s more , I'm already in perfect health . 
 Five days a week , too ? 
 Gosh ! 
 Where are you going now ? 
 When do you start school ? 
 That's good . 
 Well , thanks all the same , Denise . But no I don't think.Sorry , I'm sure you would enjoy it . I'd like to Denise , but I'm busy on friday this week and next week too . 
 Thursday ? Oh , sorry . I meant thursday too . I mean I busy then too . 
 Yes . some other time perhaps.Thanks again . 
 nine twenty pm , I couldn't say . I cann't remember . 
 I've absolutely certain . 
 I'm not quite positive . I think I went out at about half pass nine . 
 No , I didn't . 
 Quite sure . 
 A boss likes him a lot . He says Jim is a good team player . 
 Maybe we all should learn something from him . 
 John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ? 
 It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day . 
 Happy birthday ! Many happy returns ( of the day ) . 
 Hey , Joe ! Where have you been these past few days ? 
 Cool ! I ’ Ve always wanted to do something like that ! Have you learned anything useful ? 
 Have you treated any real emergencies ? 
 I can imagine ! I tend to faint when I see blood , so I think I won ’ t be taking up a course like that anytime soon ! 
 Good morning , Nathaniel . This is Leah calling from the International Student Office . 
 The reason I'm calling is because Ms . Collins will not be able to call you back until next week . 
 She's terribly sorry about that . She had to leave the office suddenly and won't be able to return until next week . She hopes you understand . 
 She asked me to call you to book an appointment with someone else today . When are you free today ? 
 Mr . Liu is available at 2:15 today . Will that work for you ? 
 I'm afraid she isn't available this afternoon . She has an opening at 11:30 this morning . Will that work for you ? 
 Ok , we'll be expecting you at 11:30 then . See you then . 
 That is just an excuse . You can always find some time to exercise . 
 Bill , you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . And skipping meals will not help you lose weight . In fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals . 
 How about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ? 
 I know , I know . Have you got a portable radio ? You can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time . 
 I'll always remember my college days . 
 It was one of the best times in my life . It was tough , but I made it . I became a college graduate . 
 It was a round day for me . My family attend the graduation ceremony . I was so nervous . I couldn't find my cap and gown , but all worked out in the end . 
 I was planning to attend gradate school , but then I was offered a good job doing marketing , so I changed my mind . 
 I sure am . So what about you ? How did you feel when you graduated ? 
 How could it be ? 
 You didn't have an offer ? 
 I think you lack in the power of decision . Once you make your decision , don't be overtaken by misgivings and fear . Just go full steam ahead ! 
 Married whom ? 
 Come on . Tell me what happened . 
 Is that true ? But anyhow , it's none of our business , isn't it ? 
 Thanks.You too ! 
 Well , my family's away and I can't afford to do much.What about you ? 
 How many languages can you speak ? 
 How well can you speak them ? 
 Can you help me to translate these sentences into German now ? 
 There are so many record players here.That is hard to choose . 
 I'd rather get one with separated speakers.They give a clear sound . 
 That's right.Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony . 
 Can ’ t you remember the days when you had the hots for me ? 
 By the way , are you going to the concert tomorrow ? 
 I think that show biz stars have a really easy life . They have lots of money , so they can buy almost anything they want . They ’ re famous , so everyone loves them . 
 I bet they love it really . Sure , they complain about it , but that just gets them more publicity , doesn ’ t it ? 
 No way ! They want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! They have such an easy life . They don ’ t even pay for Drin 
 I don ’ t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . They ’ re overpaid , over-ambitious , and over-adored . 
 Come on ! They only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves . 
 I just found out that my husband is cheating on me . 
 That's what I thought . It seems that he's been seeing someone else for about two months . 
 I asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . I picked it up and a girl asked to talk to Mark . She then asked if I was his sister , and I said no , I was his wife . She hung up immediately . 
 Yeah , he first said it was someone from work . He gave me a lame excuse , and so I pressed him on it . 
 He kept trying to make stupid excuses , and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion . 
 I told him I would divorce him if he wouldn ’ t tell me the truth or end the relationship with her . 
 So do you believe in palmistry ? 
 It's when someone takes a look at another person's palm to tell the future . 
 Are you sure ? I've read a lot about palmistry and I've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . Do you want me to take a look at your hand ? 
 Ok , let's see , well , you've got a long life line , which is good , and the love line is strong ... 
 Hmm , hard to say , wait , yes , it looks like you will do well in business , and your ambition will help you a lot , but ... 
 You seem to have a large gullibility line . You believe everything that you're told . 
 Thank you Dick . Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King . Tell me Dave , what is your impression of this film ? 
 I think otherwise . Even though the animation was technically strong , and as you say , the score and songs performed by Elton John were great , the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart . And I would dare to say , it was too predictable . 
 Well , that ’ s just it . It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes For example when Mufasal dies , or the dark , grim portrayal of Scar . Even so , the film is linear . Mufasal dies , Simba runs away thinking it ’ s his fault . Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his . It ’ s just too cliche . 
 You have always been so soft , Dave ! 
 Anyway ... That ’ s all for today folks ! Join us next time as we talk about & quot , How to lose a guy in 10 days & quot , I ’ m sure you ’ ll love that one Dave ! 
 Hi , Sterling ! 
 Professor Wood ? I think he's a brilliant scientist . 
 I guess so . 
 Miss ! 
 My name is Jane Brown ! 
 I stayed online chatting with friends all night . It was great fun . 
 It is better I don't know them . So I can say anything I want . 
 Who cares ? It's just online . It's not real . Do you want to join me tonight ? 
 We scored six goals . 
 And I score three of them . 
 We had extra time of course . 
 This is tough to say , Jordan , but I think we should break up . 
 Yes , I mean it . 
 No , we are just too different . This isn ’ t working . 
 I have thought about it for a while . I think it ’ s time to move on for both of us . 
 I ’ m sorry . 
 Then why didn ’ t you talk to me ? 
 I don't want to argue with you anymore . This is going to be tough , but Let ’ s try and be friends . 
 I think we ’ ll be better off if we are apart . 
 Sure , let ’ s just be friends . 
 Saint Jude-he's the saint of lost causes . Like my cousin , Anna , who can't stop getting pregnant . She's a lost cause . 
 Yep . She's always got a bun in the oven . She was pregnant before marriage-a real sin in the Catholic Church . 
 Ha-ha . Birth control and abortion are four-letter words in my family . 
 Hi , Lander . What's wrong ? 
 Same here . I have't brought any new clothes for three months . 
 True . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities . 
 You look a bit dull today . What's up ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . Well , I heard that registered urban unemployment rate reached 4 percent this year , with more than half being women . 
 Yeah , it's true . What is she going to do ? 
 That's not bad . It could be a short-term alternative . Your mum can look for another one when the market improves . Things will work out eventually . 
 You don't look too well . What's going on ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . Have you been looking for another job ? 
 That's tough . What does your wife think about this ? 
 I have some friends who might be able to help you find a job . I'll see what they can do . 
 No problem . In the meantime , don't try to worry so much . You'll get through this . 
 OK , go ahead--what is the excuse THIS time ? 
 Could you have gotten it done at another time ? 
 You have never missed an assignment before--when will you be making this one up ? 
 That would work , but don't let it happen again . 
 That will solve it then . Let's work hard to not let it happen again . 
 Certainly I do . 
 I'd be happy to do something new . 
 Isn ’ t it wonderful here ? The kids are enjoying themselves in the swimming pool . I hope it ’ s safe . 
 The kids said that they wanted to go to a party at the hotel . There ’ s a special one just for kids . 
 That ’ s a great idea . We can really enjoy ourselves without worrying about the kids . 
 Hi , Nancy.How are you doing ? 
 Not right now . I've got to get another car and my old one is blown up . 
 You mean used car ? 
 Well , yeah , but I'd be getting somebody else's problem . 
 It's the same kind of deal though , you know , you never know what you're going to get . 
 Let's look at them all.Have you got a paper there ? 
 You look lost . Can I help you ? 
 Yeah . I'm Brad . 
 What room is it ? 
 It's on the first floor by the nurse's office . 
 I heard that Ann had divorced . 
 Poor Ann . She did not love her husband at all . 
 Awful ! My cell phone is out of service again . Fred , can you lend me some money ? 
 200yuan . I bought a computer online , so I have to pay the mortgage . 
 It's so nice of you . You really make my day . 
 What you said is absolutely right . I will pay you back as soon as I get back on my feet . 
 How do Mark and Jones compare , in your opinion ? 
 May I venture to ask if you've decided to employ Mark ? 
 Mary , today is a great day for you . 
 Oh , here's a little token of my affection . 
 I am sorry , but I can't stay until the end of class . 
 I have an appointment . 
 No , but I'll make sure someone helps me out this week with my missed work . 
 I am leaving right now . 
 Thanks , Professor . I'll make sure everything gets taken care of . 
 An interesting meeting , isn't it ? 
 Let me introduce myself , by the way . My name's Thomas Bradley . 
 Sorry , what was your last name again ? 
 Ok , I'm Tom . 
 And what do you do , Ted ? 
 Salesman ? 
 I work for American Airlines . 
 I'm in the Personnel Department . 
 Really ? There aren't many left now . 
 Were there any animals in the forest ? 
 My son is alway complaining that I dump on him . He was very rude and told me to mind my own business . I cannot put up with that . 
 John is a peacemaker . He simply doesn ’ t bother . He says he should give him a free hand . 
 Well , the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulty getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts . 
 And now we have a two-year-old boy . We ’ re very happy that he ’ s healthy and smart . 
 Right now he speaks mostly Chinese , and he can say a few English words . But he will learn . 
 Yes , people surely can . He ’ s whiter than the Chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though . 
 I'd like to very much . 
 Who's playing ? 
 Do you know what they are playing ? 
 And who is directing ? 
 Here ’ s your hot dog and beer . What happened ? Did I miss anything ? 
 What ’ s the score ? 
 So Baltimore is winning ? 
 This is a really great place to watch a baseball game . 
 The fans are great here , too . Not like in Philadelphia . 
 Yeah , it reminds you why they say baseball is America ’ s favorite pastime . 
 Could you stay a little longer ? 
 In that case , I won ’ t keep you.Remember to give me a call . 
 Tell me why you saw the movie twice . 
 You bet it . 
 Sure did . It's a beauty . Where do you want it ? 
 Let's go to work . We want to have the tree ready to light up by evening . 
 Hand me some globes and paper flowers , I'll put them on these top branches . 
 Let's switch the lights on . 
 Well , I guess we're all set for another merry Christmas . 
 Sure , great effect.My weight has dropped from 150 pounds to 120 . 
 Our house is too small . We had better have a big one . 
 Shut up . You should think how to make fortunes , not look for a squabble . 
 Ok , you name the day . 
 What day is that ? 
 Good . Where shall we meet ? 
 What is wrong with you ? 
 You can talk with him . 
 She works as a teller in a bank . 
 Yes . She goes three times a week . 
 She wants to be a manager . 
 She takes classes in accounting and business . 
 Nice to meet you , Mr . Wilson . 
 Thank you . 
 Well , I think I'm ready for new challenges . 
 I started to date someone recently , but it didn't work out . 
 Well ... that's a long story . 
 Come on , just a little piece . 
 I have no idea . 
 That's amazing . 
 Come on , you are making too big deal out of this . 
 OK , dear sister , I see . This kind of thing will not happen again . 
 Yeah , I just need to make the final touches . 
 I'm finished . What do you think ? 
 Do you really ? 
 Well , thank you very much . 
 You owe me $ 55 . 
 You are very welcome . Come back again . 
 I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ? 
 I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ? 
 You need a babysitter . 
 I could have Suzy stay at my place . 
 Why not ? 
 I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston.She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely . 
 I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible . 
 I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself . 
 Did you hear what happened in the Scott case ? Some of the sensitive material were leaked to the press . Now every newspapers is all over it . 
 I'm sure they have their suspicions ; there were only a few of the senior level layers who were privy to the case details . 
 I'm sure there'll be canned ! And there also might be some legal consequences . 
 Because whoever let the cat out of the bag was breaking client confidentiality . 
 I'm sure management is on top of it . 
 That's because you cheated . 
 Yes , you do . 
 Oh , hi Lucas , come on in . I'm Barbara . Nice to meet you . 
 Would you like something to drink ? I've got tea and some grape juice . 
 Oh , there is a supermarket not far from here . But there is also a tea house around the corner , where you can get tea , taste tea and get a tea set as well . 
 You are right about that . It's quiet and very convenient . You can get to the bus and the subway stations within ten minutes ' walk . There's a grocery store , a book store , a gym , and many restaurants along the street . 
 Well , if you want we can go together sometime . Actually I was thinking of going this afternoon , if you like , you can join me and I can show you the neighborhood along the way . 
 What ’ s your favourite ball sport ? 
 Who ’ s your favourite player ? 
 Do they have a good team ? 
 I can ’ t keep up with the game . The players play so quickly that I can hardly see what they are doing . 
 You play for an amateur team , don ’ t you ? 
 How many more games are there this season ? 
 I'm sorry , but I can't go . 
 I have to see my daughter . 
 I have an appointment at one fifteen . 
 How old is he ? 
 Time flies ! 
 How are you , Kim ? I haven ’ t seen you around for a few days . 
 I ’ m sorry to hear about that . Why don ’ t you join me for a hot cup of tea ? It ’ ll be good for you ! 
 Hello , Mr . Brown , long time no see . Where have you been ? 
 Great . What do you think of it ? 
 Did you go to the Summer Mountain Resort ? 
 It sounds great , and is it really cool there ? 
 What is the special local product ? 
 I hope to go there someday . 
 Yeah , it's must for me . 
 I won't , mom . 
 I will . Bye , mom . 
 John got a heart attack last night . 
 Not so good , though his nephew took him to hospital in time . 
 Why are you always staring at Melissa ? Do you like her or something ? 
 Have you heard about the new iPhone ? 
 I'd like to . It's a cell phone , camera , PAD and mp3 player all in one . 
 how big is a shuffle iPod ? 
 how many gigs of music can it hold ? 
 how much do they cost ? 
 you're right , that's not bad at all . 
 I got one for my birthday when they first came out , but after the battery died out , I never brought another one . 
 that's one of the problems with having an iPod . Though an iPod might have an above average battery life , once the battery is dead , so is your iPod . 
 I can't deny that . She is so beautiful that I fell in love with her at the first sight . I wish I knew more about her . 
 I can not belive that . It must be cooked up by someone . 
 I ’ m looking for this book . 
 I don ’ t see it on the shelf . 
 I already looked . 
 It said that the book is on the shelf , but it isn ’ t . 
 Could you do that ? 
 That ’ s great . Thank you so much . 
 Bob and Mary are back together . 
 Me too , they're such a nice couple . 
 I didn't have any big plans . 
 That sounds like fun . Where will it be ? 
 Oh good ! Can I bring anything ? 
 I am assuming that the dress is casual . 
 Wonderful . Just e-mail me the time and date and I'll be there . 
 Is that the girl you spent almost every weekend with ? 
 I am not good at picking gifts . Maybe you can ask if there's anything she needs to make it easier ? 
 Yeah , that's nice . 
 A plant ? That's creative . I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you . But there is a problem . Do you think it'll be able to get through the customs ? 
 I don't know . I think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer . You don't want to get her in trouble . 
 Yes , I like collecting things . 
 Several things , for example , Various coins , stamps , stones and so on . 
 Yes , stones . 
 We're going dancing tonight . 
 Good morning Mike ! 
 I am having an exam at nine , It's already eight thirty . 
 Thank you very much ! 
 Very well , thanks , I will probably finish next week , but this is still a lot of work , I have been worked on in for six months , and i ' m so closed to end . I can feel it . 
 Yes , It's only eight forty . Thanks so much ! 
 Have a nice day , bye ! 
 Happy birthday , George . Many happy returns of the day . Here's a present for you . 
 I hope you like it . Oh , have the other guys arrived ? 
 Let's go . 
 You only need to tell me that once . 
 Because I ’ m not in the mood , that ’ s why . 
 Help you in the kitchen , I don ’ t feel like it . 
 Really ? Do I have to do it ? 
 Well , isn ’ t there anything you want ? 
 No , why should I ? I don ’ t feel like it . Besides , I ’ m in such a bad mood . 
 Thank you . 
 I will try my best . 
 These are my roses . The roses have been in flower for a week . 
 Yes , you are right . I love flowers and hence have taken to growing them . I take care of my flowers every day as if they are my good friends . 
 Oh , I see . People who don't understand the nature of flowers won't be able to grow them well . I can help you learn more if you want to plant flowers one day . In this way you need not be afraid of your own sweet flower-garden's being neglected . 
 Julia , why have you prepared a candlelight dinner ? Anything special to celebrate ? Did you get a promotion ? 
 Oh , my dear , how can I forget such an important day ? I was just kidding . Look at this box . 
 Have a guess . 
 No . 
 Open it now . 
 You're welcome , honey . I hope we will celebrate our golden wedding anniversary in future . 
 Forget it ! If you think I ’ d ever set foot that inferior restaurant again , you gotta be nuts . Last time I ate that food , almost vomited . The service in there is terrible . It was the first time I ever stiffed a waiter 
 Oh , give me a break ! That place is too lavish for us . 
 In that case , I ’ m right behind you . 
 I went a global warming rally in London . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment . 
 it might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening . 
 well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start . 
 if you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy . 
 yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center . 
 I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone . 
 to be honest , in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place , we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment . 
 Because I like him . 
 Hi , Mikel . What's with you ? You look angry . 
 True , you are getting a really pot belly , aren't you ? 
 Just kidding , Mikel . Why don't you come work out with me ? 
 It works if you keep at it . Come on , let's go ! 
 This feels great . I'm all reed up . I can keep going all night . 
 Exercise has no benefit unless you sweat like a pig . 
 Thanks for coming , it was a real blessed . 
 You'll get used to it , Mikel , trust me . 
 Thank you . I'm wearing make-up . 
 It's me . I have studied make-up at a beauty shop . 
 Of course . First , use eye shadow to heighten your eyes . 
 I think pink eye shadow is popular among Chinese girls . 
 I suggest you use lipstick , which also accentuates your lips . 
 You have to pay attention to trimming them from time to time . 
 Stop fussing ! It is said that the training is important for our newcomers . And my company also informs me to attend the training next week . 
 I disagree with you . Companies usually make a workable and reasonable plan for the trainings , so as to improve new comers ' understanding of the company and its rules in short time . Through the training , we get to know many things , such as the corporate culture and spirit . Our newcomers can really grasp the essence of the company 
 I am . 
 I think I'm in love . 
 Her name is Jenny . 
 We are in the same math class . Our teacher sat us next to each other . 
 She's very funny . She makes me laugh all the time . 
 Whatever brought us together , I'm happy . 
 I have no idea , any suggestions ? 
 It must be fun . But you know , I am not good at chess . I never won since I've learnt to play chess . 
 OK , settled then . 
 See you ! 
 Cinct de mayo ? 
 Do we get a day off from school then ? 
 Www , man ! 
 Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ? 
 And then what happened ? 
 What's that book you have under your arm ? 
 How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn . 
 Is it really worth paying for ? 
 If it's any good , I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition . 
 It was wonderful , but I was so tired . 
 Yes , that was the first thing we did . We went all the way to the top . There were visitorsfrom all over the world taking photos there . 
 Art galleries , cathedrals , statues , fountains , palaces , bistros , there's really too much to say . 
 Yes , at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . However , on the third day of travelling in the city , I felt sick I think I had something bad to eat but it passed by the evening . 
 On the fourth day , we went to taste the French cuisine . That was really fantastic . And no stomach problems . 
 You'll have to try for yourself some day . 
 Thank you very much . I will devote all my efforts to my work . 
 No , I wasn't . I came here in 1992 . 
 I was seventeen . 
 No , because my English wasn't very good . I studied English for two years first . 
 Thanks . Your English is pretty good , too . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Sure . There is a folk concert tonight . 
 Sorry . There are only some seats in the back . 
 It begins at 7 p . m .. 
 How many tickets do you want ? 
 OK . Fifty yuan for each . 
 We have a live show of a football match this Friday night . 
 Brazilian against AC Millan . 
 How time flies ! Why I always feel haven't enough time to work and study ? 
 Maybe we should make a plan and list what we should do next , and follow it . 
 You are right . Let ’ s stop idling around and do something . 
 Hi dude , you look upset , what's up ? 
 what's the problem ? 
 well , you can simply tell them you want to sleep , or make an arrangement for a time when the room should quiet down . 
 I understand . I used to live in a dorm with four people . I was great in some aspects . We always went out and and had fun together . But on the other hand , when I wanted some quiet time , and people kept 
 I'd better be going . 
 I wish I could , but it's already late . 
 Thank you for a wonderful meal . 
 Are you an American ? 
 Why don't you speak English ? 
 Oh , do you like Chinese ? 
 I want to study German . Can we exchange lessons ? 
 When will we begin ? 
 That's all right . 
 I went bankrupt and I'm flat broke now . 
 Thank you . 
 Oh , thank you so much . 
 I really appreciated it . 
 It was so kind of you . 
 You ’ re a real friend in need . 
 I've been away on a vacation . 
 Yeah , beautiful sunshine , pleasant scenery and many new friends 
 I hear you have just shown your hand first to Lin Ping . 
 If I were in your position , I wouldn't give up an inch . 
 Have any plans for the weekend , Tom ? 
 Oh , do you go hiking often ? 
 It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ? 
 Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a lion on my last hike . 
 Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest . 
 Thanks . I will ask him . 
 Yeah , about 5 minutes ago . 
 The Bulls , of course ! 
 Don ’ t worry , Shan always screws up free throws . 
 That was a great shot ! A three pointer , yeah ! 
 This ref needs glasses . Hey ref , open your eyes ! I can ’ t believe he didn ’ t see that ! 
 I heard that Kevin got divorced . Is that true ? 
 What ? 
 Poor Kevin , we should do something for him . He is a nice guy and does his job well . 
 Honey , do you know what color the carrot is ? 
 Wow , my son is so clever . 
 Really ? 
 Oh , my son looks like a grown-up . 
 No kidding . So tell me what's your favorite color ? 
 Why ? 
 OK , superman . Put on your cape , we are going to fly home . 
 Don't mention it , let's go in . 
 She sure can . Are you jealous , Leslie ? 
 You can ! With a little practice . 
 I think he's hot too . 
 Exercised over and over . Exercise is a key . 
 Good for you , Leslie ! 
 yes , do you like it ? 
 it looks good on the outside , but the inside is a different story . It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again . 
 well , first of all , it needs a new engine , which is extremely expensive . 
 it must have been a few years ago now . 
 they do . Once my son was born , there was no reason to drive this car anymore . It's only a two-seater , you know ! 
 the heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer ! 
 the brakes don't really work that well anymore either . 
 it costs more than you think to run a car , especially when there are so many things wrong with it ! 
 Hello , Kith , can you and Alice come around this evening ? We prefer your coming . 
 About 7 o'clock . 
 No , not really . Just bring yourselves . We would like to your presence . 
 Speaking . Who's calling , please ? 
 Oh , hi , Tom . How've you been ? 
 Let me see . Uh-huh ... no , I guess I'll be free . 
 Sounds like a good idea . 
 Thank you for inviting me . See you then . Bye , Tom . 
 I ’ m afraid that ’ s not my cup of tea . I just find skin-diving attracting . 
 There are so many flavors of ice cream to choose from ! 
 I love fruit flavored ices the best . 
 What is your least favorite ice cream ? 
 Yeah , I know what you mean . 
 That could be interesting . 
 I don't want to do the damn dishes . 
 Good morning , Paul ! 
 Yes , traffic wasn't much today , so I made it to the office earlier . 
 Well , about an hour or so . 
 No . I take public transportation . It's safer . 
 Well , both have advantages and disadvantages . 
 Me too.Recently , I'm fascinated with net-chat . I've made many friends on the net.Every day I talk to them and share many interesting things with them . I really enjoy it . 
 I'm afraid not . Every coin has two sides . I think using internet has a great deal to do with human interaction . 
 Sure . A UFO is just a space vehicle from another planet . If you think about it , our space shuttles are UFOs . 
 I've seen photos of UFOs in America before , but they've all looked doctored up . 
 I think there must be . 
 I don't't think it would make sense if we were the only beings in this whole world . The world is just far too big for that . 
 No , but we're trying to contact them . 
 I think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet , humankind will not become extinct . 
 There's a lot of evidence that suggest it will , but I don't think it's going to happen any time soon . 
 I don't mind shopping for food and other daily needs . 
 It's fun walking around them , but their displays are so good I'm tempted to buy things I don't really need . 
 Oh , it ’ s lovely . Think of the nasty weather we had last week . 
 Fine , thank you . And you ? 
 Martha . What's wrong ? Why are you crying ? 
 I'm sorry . When did this happen ? 
 What a jerk . He doesn't deserve you . 
 He didn't treat you that well either . Maybe you don't want to hear this , but I think you can do better . 
 It must be really painful . I remember when Josh and I broke up . I was crying for a week . 
 Exactly . You'll find someone again . You should get your mind off of this . Let's go shopping . 
 How about coffee down the street ? 
 I got a ninety-five on my test . 
 How can you keep in touch with your aunt in America ? 
 It's very expensive , right ? 
 Why not send E-mail through the Internet ? 
 Sure . You can send E-mail to each other every day through the internet . In addition , you can make a phone call through the internet , too . 
 No problem . I'll tell you . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Are you a professor ? 
 Yes , I am kidding.But don't you know only professors and students with disabilitiescan apply for parking permits ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry . I didn't know . 
 Here is the application form . I also need to see your student ID and your permission letter from the university . 
 Yes , the letter that certifies you have a disability.And it must certify your disability entitles you to a parking place . 
 Yes . Or you can bring it yourself . 
 Let me look in the file then . Maybe we received it . 
 Yes , here it is.Alright . Then I just need your completed application form , and I will be able to process your request . 
 The form has a map on the back . You may specify your top four choices.We will give a spot in the lot that has an opening . 
 You're very welcome . 
 We'd better go out for a walk . 
 Spring . 
 I dislike it most . 
 Because the hottest season is summer in a year . 
 Will you be at the family reunion next year ? 
 I watched a very interesting documentary about plants yesterday evening . It was called “ unusual plants ” and looked at several species of plants from around the world which have unusual features . 
 Well . There was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them . 
 No , it isn ’ t . it ’ s a pity , because I ’ d like to see it in action . 
 They showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee . The insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar . Other insects cannot get it . Of course , when the insect collects the nectar , it also takes some pollen from one flower to another . 
 That ’ s right . That ’ s one reason why it ’ s so important to protect every species . 
 According to the documentary , they have an incredible ability to find water supplies , however small , and then store them without losing much through evaporation . 
 I have some good news for you . 
 Jenny is getting married . 
 Tom , that lucky guy . 
 Last week , It said that he fell in love with Jenny at Mrs.Whit ' s party last Monday as soon as he saw her . 
 July 4 , the National Holiday . 
 Jenny plans to hold it in church . 
 Guess ! 
 You know , Tom is my best friend and he asked me to be his best man . 
 Yes , I did . 
 Well , I would say that I ’ m just drifting - - here , in the pool . 
 Well , it ’ s very comfortable just to drift here . 
 No . 
 You got me . 
 Peter , have you finished your English composition ? 
 Class starts in twenty minutes . You have to turn it in at the beginning of class today . 
 Do you think you can finish it on time ? 
 You ’ d better hurry ! 
 Sorry ! 
 We still have to do about ten more . 
 I know . Maybe we can finish it tomorrow . 
 All right . Let's call it quits and go home . 
 Tom , did you see the film last night ? 
 Do you really think so ? I don't think so . It wasn't that bad film at all . Didn't you hear the applause of the audience ? 
 Well , I don't see the point of arguing this . 
 Yeah . Why not ? 
 Oh , you went to the wedding ? 
 I'm OK . I promise . Maybe you don't know that I have done with him for a long time . 
 You should go to the library to find some information about American universities , and write to the Admission Office . Then the Admission Office will send you application forms and other related materials . From experience , many applicants write to several universities instead of just one . 
 That is true . I'll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities . First of all , you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work , three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence , and the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It's usually 550 ) . Then you need a financial guarantee , and an application fee of 25 dollars . 
 If they agree to enroll you , they will send you a TAP - 66 Form . With TAP - 66 , you can apply for a passport from our government , and then apply for a visa from the US Embassy in Beijing . 
 From 3 to 6 months if everything goes well . 
 You are welcome . Please feel free to ask if you have any more questions . 
 What do you mean ? 
 You were ? 
 Really ? Why would you worry about me ? I ’ m just fine . 
 No way ! I like my apartment , and I like to be independent . 
 Not at all . I see you and your family twice a week , and I enjoy seeing my own friends . I ’ m too busy to feel lonely ! 
 You mean Armistice Day . 
 Wow , I didn ’ t know ! Probably because I flunked history in school . 
 Yes , he is running for class president . 
 Take my word for it . 
 Don't worry . He'll cross that bridge when he comes to it . My son reads a lot on his computer and uses e-mail to send messages to his friends almost every day . He's really absorbed by the discussions . 
 I guess using a computer has a great deal to do with human interaction . Getting in touch with each other must be more fun to your wife and my son than the coolest computer games or the hottest information . 
 Sure . What do you know about the Olympic Games on the past ? For example , do you know where and when the first Olympic Games were held in the ancient times ? 
 Haven't the Olympics been stopped for a long time ? 
 I see . Look , do you know what that emblem means ? I've seen it so many times , but I don't know what it stands for . 
 I see . I believe there will be lots of foreigners coming to Beijing to watch the Games . 
 I plan to buy a car this year . 
 I'm going to work in holidays and pay by installments . 
 What's your favorite season ? 
 Yeah , and all those fun summer sports and activities . 
 Oh , me too ! All the family getting together ... 
 I like the feeling then that school is almost over ! 
 One of my students told me she was very depressed today . 
 Her father is dying . 
 Yeah , she ’ s broken up about it , poor kid . 
 I talked to her for a while , but she ’ s really depressed . So , I made an appointment with the school counselor for her . 
 Yeah , that ’ s what I told her . I ’ m glad she ’ s reaching out for help , instead of trying to deal with this on her own . 
 It ’ s rather cold . Isn ’ t it 
 Shall I light the stove ? 
 Well . What ’ s the climate like in your country ? 
 Which season do you like best ? 
 Good afternoon , Sam . 
 What are you going to do tomorrow ? 
 I would like to go skating . Feel like going with me ? 
 I think so . Fresh air , white snow . It's so comfortable . 
 It doesn't matter , I can teach you . 
 Can you play tennis ? 
 It is interesting , isn't it ? 
 Can you teach me ? 
 Let me try . Oh , I missed ! 
 High ? 
 Oh ! I hit it . 
 Thank you . I think I like playing it . 
 Not bad at all , thanks . There were one or two interesting people there.Why couldn't you come ? 
 What a shame . Why didn't you take a sleeping pill ? 
 How many did you use to take ? 
 Good heavens . Why did you take so many ? 
 I'm sure you did . 
 He was quite right . 
 What a beautiful view . 
 What is that below ? 
 No . Thank you . It looks a bit too dangerous for me . 
 Yes , there is beautiful view . You can go fishing , camping and also enjoy this beautiful clean air . 
 That's true . 
 Yeuks ! Do they know anything about me ? 
 I'm a little nervous ! 
 How Ay people will be there at dinner ? 
 That's good , I'm usually more comfortable in bigger families . 
 Yes , I'm studying in the Foreign Languages Department . 
 I'm majoring in English . 
 Yes.The language is hard to learn , but it's interesting . 
 I'm reading a lot of books about the two countries . I like the culture . 
 You're right . 
 Thanks . It's a lot better than mine , and it's new . 
 We're going to visit my sister in the city . 
 About a year ago . She lives in an apartment on 3rd street , across from the public library . 
 Oh , we're not driving . We're going to take the subway . The subway only takes about 20 minutes . 
 I take the subway to work everyday , so I'm used to it now . 
 Yes , she's lived there for about ten years . 
 I know what you mean . It's hard to find anything that's reasonable now . 
 See you later . 
 So soon . It seems as if you just got here . 
 It certainly has been a pleasure seeing you again and renewing old memories . 
 It was fun for me , too . It gave me a chance to get away from my routine . 
 Oh , yes . I should be there some time next spring . 
 I don't think the lecture is very interesting . 
 I feel he's like a talking machine . 
 And lightweight , too . It'll play for 20 hours on two AA batteries ! 
 And they're really safe . They'll protect your ear from sound damage . 
 I know . And you can also hear outside noises while you listen to music . 
 You're spending a very long time on my hair . 
 I needed you to be done and finished an hour ago . 
 Are you sure you're finished ? 
 You did a horrible job on my hair . 
 I don't like anything about it . 
 That's fine , but I'm not paying for it . 
 Excuse me . Have you got the time ? 
 Does your watch keep good time ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 From my own experience as a career woman , I would have to say that while things are getting better now than they used to be , it is still a widespread problem . Society is changing , but there is still a glass ceiling for women in many career tracks . 
 I think it's a very complicated issue . A part of the difficulties women have advancing in the work force are due to few opportunities and many male managers . Don't underestimate the good ole ' boy system . Men have power , so it's easier for them to stay in power . 
 Affirmative action has given us management quotas and bans sexual discrimination , but it's still a man's world . 
 What do you mean , Mr . Smith ? You said to make it brief . 
 Would you like some more rice ? 
 He has to deliver letters every day . 
 Oh , no , he likes the job . 
 Good morning golf aficionados ! My name is Rick Fields , and you guessed it , I am here with my main man , Bob Copeland . 
 Whoa , that ’ s a lot of cash ! Let ’ s go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing . 
 Tiger Woods is about to tee off , and let ’ s see if he has the same luck as Jack . Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and , he seems to be very nervous . 
 It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees . He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it . 
 I haven't seen Bill lately . How is he ? 
 That's too bad . What does he have ? 
 Let me know if there's anything I can do . 
 Professor , I'm concerned about my grades . Do you have a minute ? 
 I want to know if I am doing OK . 
 I am afraid that I might not be doing all that well . 
 I think I could take better notes and read a little more . 
 I'm working on it ! 
 Lisa , I am told you did very well in your exam . 
 Congratulations on your success . 
 Good morning , madam . I'd like to apply for a library card . Can you help me ? 
 OK . Here you are . 
 OK . Here is the money . And If I return the card , can I get the refund ? 
 OK . I see . Thank you . 
 Mr . Clinton , it's nice to see you again . 
 Very well . How's Mrs . Clinton ? 
 how did your interview go ? 
 if you get the promotion , what will your new title be ? 
 will you get a pay-raise , too ? 
 that makes sense . Who interviewed you ? 
 what kinds of questions did she ask you ? 
 the second one sounds rather difficult to answer . What did you tell her ? 
 those are good answers . How did she react ? 
 what do you think about her as a boss ? 
 you're lucky . Not everyone has such a great boss ! 
 when you find out you get the promotion or not , let me know . 
 Has the game started yet ? 
 Who's winning ? 
 What ! That wasn't a foul ! C ’ mon , ref ! 
 You were right ! He didn ’ t make the shot ! 
 Did you see that ? He traveled and the ref didn ’ t call it ! 
 Okay ... end of the first quarter ... Alright , I ’ m gonna make a beer run . 
 Not yet . I'm not finished with my research yet . 
 Reading my fashion magazines ! How do you think I know so much about all the latest trends ? 
 Duh ... That's the point . The people in the ads are wearing what's in . Plus , there are articles on new trends ... 
 Out of sight , out of mind . 
 Don ’ t you know they have had little affection for each other ? 
 I can't remember . 
 Hi , Bill . Are you going to the commencement ? 
 OK . ( Several minutes later . ) Let's go into the school auditorium . 
 Yes . I find my heart is now rising and falling like waves , all sorts of feelings welling up in my heart . 
 How time flies . Look , the president of the college has come onto the stage . 
 Hi , I'm Benjamin . Nice to meet you here . You look great . 
 No , this is the second time . But I also feel bad because of the lower pressure and the jet lag . 
 Oh , that's too bad . Do you get a good knowledge of China ? 
 All of the Chinese are proud of the Great Wall . And it was built before the In dynasty near Shan Haiguan-the First Pass in the World . 
 No , before the In dynasty . 
 Both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . And I usually refresh myself with a cup of tea . 
 Yes , I have . 
 Medicine . In my country , that certainly has great prestige . 
 Oh.history . 
 Well , doctors are such an important job . I mean your health is the most imponent thing you've got , isn't it ? I want to be important and help people . 
 Hello , Mr . Black , I'm calling to say goodbye . 
 I wish I could stay a little longer , but a lot of things to do back home . 
 Yes , I did . 
 At 11:00 o'clock . 
 No , I'll go by myself , thanks . 
 Mark is parade his knowledge again . 
 A well-learned person never does that . 
 Where are they from ? 
 What are they doing in Beijing ? 
 Which hotel are they staying at ? 
 Do you need a ticket ? 
 Yes , it is . 
 You can be assured of it . 
 Hi ! Crenshaw and Hawthorne , at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner . 
 From China . 
 It ’ s fine . I am actually from Mexico . I was in China on a business trip , visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products . 
 Don ’ t you know it ’ s rude to ask a lady her age ? 
 Well thank you ! In that case , I am 26 years old , and what about yourself ? 
 Really ? That ’ s great ! Do you speak some Spanish ? 
 Did you see that ? 
 How could you miss that ? 
 Hello , Is this EYE computers ? 
 Actually , I'm calling to complain about your service . The computer I bought last week is faulty . 
 Well , easily , It doesn't work . It doesn't even start probably . 
 Look what you've done ! 
 Yes , and hurry up ! 
 No , I'll do it myself . 
 I should think so , too ! 
 Yes , and please be more careful in the future ! 
 That's OK . 
 I am so sorry about that . It was just a slip of the tongue . 
 Just tell the truth . I won ’ t take it personally . 
 Sometimes it's wise to be direct with people . Come on , just tell me . Don't beat around the bush , please ! 
 Alright . What is that you want to tell me ? 
 What ? Are you serious ? Oh , my gosh ! There will be guys everywhere . 
 Why ? Do you have a robot girlfriend ? 
 So you can download MP3 music from the Net and record it onto the MP3 chip ? 
 Let me see it ! It's so small ! 
 Why would I do that ? 
 Some men do , but not me . 
 I'm an open book . Watch me all you want . 
 You won't catch me , because I love you . I'm not a cheater . 
 I don't want any other woman . 
 Honey , please . You're the only woman for me , forever . I swear it . 
 Hum , me too . This winter holiday was especially long . What have you done ? 
 You know , I like traveling . I made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself . 
 I don't really like sci-fi movies because they're always really weird . 
 Hmm ... you're right . Well , I guess ' Terminator ' is an exception to the rule . 
 I like it . It makes the city feel alive . I like all the different colors and I like the billboards with eye-catching pictures and slogans . 
 I see your point , but if companies didn ’ t spend money on advertising , no one would hear about their products . I agree that some form of advertising can be annoying . I don ’ t like it when people try to give you leaflets with information about products you have no intention of buying . 
 Yes , that annoys me too . With billboards , you can look away , but with broadcasts , you can ’ t avoid them . I like the way that advertising agencies use comedy in their campaign . 
 That kind of advertising seems to be very common with brand name products . They are always trying to maintain brand loyalty . 
 I don't think so . Why ? 
 sure . Would it be alright if I brought a few friends ? 
 will there be a lot of people there ? 
 who else is going to be there ? 
 I know your sister . She's very nice . 
 what time is it going to start ? 
 should I bring anything ? 
 I could also bring some music if you want . I've got loads of songs on my new iPod . 
 So , Jack , do you believe in ghosts ? 
 Because I want to tell you about the time that I saw a ghost . 
 It was many years ago , when I was a little child . It was the middle of the night , and I went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . I walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs , when ... 
 It was a big , green thing that looked like a person . It was in the kitchen , and it slowly moved towards the stairs ... 
 I hid so that it couldn't see me . Slowly it got closer and closer , until ... 
 It moved slowly up the stairs , step by step , and I could hear its approaching footsteps . When it finally got to the top of the stairs , I realized that it was my father in his green pajamas . He had gone to get a late night snack . 
 He said that I have been eating too much . 
 Yes , he asked me to clean up my diet by cutting red meat . 
 I don't know about you , but I am famished . Are you interested in getting a bite to eat ? 
 I'd love something spicy . Maybe we could get some Sichuan hotpot . 
 Sure . If I could , I would eat hot pot every day ! 
 Well , let's stop dragging our feet and find a Sichuan hot pot restaurant for dinner ! 
 Well ... ? Have you thought of it yet ? 
 Never mind . There's an authentic tasting hot pot restaurant not far from the China World Trade Towers on Chang An Street . Have you been there ? 
 You really have a big head , don't you . 
 Q-Duck ? Do you mean the famous roast-duck store ? 
 They have moved to some other places long time ago . 
 Yeah , a lot of changes have happened here . 
 Yeah , they are my wife's heaven , but not mine . I always get lost in the supermarket . 
 Is that better now ? 
 You ’ re new here , right ? 
 Is this your first semester ? 
 What school did you transfer from ? 
 Do you like it here so far ? 
 Which is better , here or PCC ? 
 Why didn ’ t you just stay at PCC ? 
 My hair stood on end when I saw the bloody scene . 
 A kitten being run over by a truck . 
 But where have you been , Alice ? You're over an hour late . 
 But why were you getting off work so late ? The office close at six , doesn't it ? 
 But didn't you tell him you had an appointment ? 
 Well , you're here . And that's the main thing . 
 Great ! This calls for a celebration . 
 Yes , and I know a few things I'd spend the money on . 
 A new car for a start . 
 I suppose I should choose one from the ' Best Career List ' , to be a public officer , what do you think ? 
 It beats me ! I never thought about it before and maybe I thought finding a career is a simple thing . 
 The mosquitos are biting me ! 
 Do you have any bug spray ? 
 Then we ’ ll have to put up with it . 
 That ’ s without a doubt , the best idea you ’ Ve had ! Let ’ s do it ! 
 How come you're still up ? Shouldn't you be asleep by now ? 
 As far as I know , insomnia is usually caused by stress . Are you stressed at all ? 
 You're a good student . I'm sure you can do well . What you need to do is to relax . 
 Taking a yoga class or learning some relaxation techniques can help you cope with your stress . 
 You need to take some breaks throughout the day . Studying all day isn ’ t very usually effective . 
 Besides , it ’ s not difficult to learn yoga . In fact , I can teach you a move that ’ s supposed to help you fall asleep ! You just have to sit down like this , bend over and breath in deeply . 
 Good night , sleep tight ; don ’ t let the bed bugs bite ! 
 Actually , i popped in them last night . 
 Well , they're really beautiful people . 
 Yeah , she is a neck-off for sure . 
 He is a professional football player . 
 Anyway , that is not what I meant by beautiful . 
 I meant that they're very simple , easy to talk to . 
 Yeah . I think things are worked out just fine . 
 Yeah . My whole GPA is screwed up now . 
 Well , I bombed my econ final and ended up with a 1.7 . 
 Well , it's my fault because I didn't study as much as I should have . 
 That's what I plan on doing unless I keep screwing up . How did you do this semester ? 
 My GPA is pretty similar to yours . I have a 3.1 now because of the stupid econ class . 
 I was sitting happy with a 3.4 . 
 Let's just say I screwed up more than my econ class . 
 I started playing starcraft and ended up wasting a lot of time . 
 You're right . I'm not going to play games during school anymore . 
 Well , what do you want to see ? I don't think there are many good movies out right now . 
 Now that's a great plan . It's a date ! 
 It could be . There are floods in this country almost every year , but in recent years they have been more widespread and more frequent . 
 The summers are hotter . The last three summers have been the hottest for the past 200 years . There have also been stronger winds . 
 I think you ’ re right . Climate change naturally over time , but I think that human activities are speeding up the change . I wish that government would join together and try to resolve the problem . 
 Are you almost finished with my hair ? 
 How much longer is it going to be ? 
 I absolutely love it . 
 Yes , I truly do . 
 How much do I owe you ? 
 Here you go , thanks for everything . 
 Oh , hi , Lily . When did you get back from Canada ? 
 How was it ? 
 Well , tell me . What are they like ? 
 And lots of Dear Abby sob stories ... 
 No wonder you're such a wacko ... 
 Nice . Hey , I like the layout of this page ... 
 I'd be a basket case if you think of me that way . I need your understanding . 
 Can ’ t you be more considerate ? I need your encouragement . 
 Driving during the rush hours can be a bit of a bind . 
 So I'd rather walk or run to work . 
 What do you think of smoking ? 
 What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ? 
 But that ’ ll affect the national economy . 
 How about painting a warning on each cigarette packet ? 
 Hey Rachael , what's up ? How is your day ? 
 Oh , yea . I forgot.So how did it go ? 
 Great , so what happens now ? 
 Hello , Bobby , It seems that I can't arrive at your home by 12 o'clock . 
 I'm so sorry , I've been held up by the damn traffic jam for half an hour . I'd have arrived but for that . 
 Thirty meters ahead is the Waterloo Bridge . 
 I've thought of that , but what can I do with my car ? If only I had taken a taxi ! 
 I'm so terribly sorry to keep you waiting . 
 Bye . 
 I'd like to introduce myself first . 
 My name is Gavin White . I was born and raised in London . After high school , I went to Edinburgh University . I worked for one year to pay for my tuition and then got my Bachelor ’ s degree there . Now I've come here to get my Master ’ s degree . I am glad to meet all of you and I hope we will become good friends . 
 The usual time . Half past two in the afternoon . 
 The usual place . In front of the treasure house . 
 Your usual shirt and shoes . 
 Nothing unusual , I ’ m afraid . 
 Good . That ’ s something unusual . 
 I didn't like it . Not a bit . I couldn't stand the music . Besides the story was so boring that it put me to sleep . 
 I know . However , Jazz always annoys me . I really don't enjoy music in a movie . 
 Anything with a lot of action , I like thrillers and chillers . 
 Well , I enjoy the popcorn and being with you.You ' re more important than the movie . 
 Any time . 
 We've missed you too . The office just isn't the same without you . How is your new job ? 
 What happened ? 
 Wow , so you'll be out thirty dollars on your first week at work ! 
 Well , every department is different . You wouldn't want your new co-workers to think you're a Grinch , right ? 
 A Grinch is a person who spoils the mood at a happy occasion by being selfish or unenthusiastic . You know - a party proper . 
 Then I must go-you have said it yourself . 
 I tell you I must go ! 
 I have spoken my mind , and can go anywhere now . 
 I'll never again come to your side ; I am turn away now and can't return . 
 Merry Christmas ! Mr Bean . 
 Well , I would be glad to , but I have promised Tom to see his Christmas tree , and play the piano for his song tonight . 
 Fine , thanks . How are you ? 
 Oh my lord . I haven't really started them . 
 I know but I was busy with my part-time job the last few days . 
 To be honest with you , Jason , I don't think I'm doing a very good job of balancing my schoolwork with my job . I'm always two steps behind . I've got to get back to the dorm and continue writing that paper . Say ! Why don ’ t you talk to your advisor ? And let me know ! 
 Jack , I hear you got promoted.Is that true ? 
 Oh , Jack , you deserve it.You ' Ve been working so hard . 
 Why did she do that ? 
 Hurry up ! Time is money ! 
 But you are too slow to follow them . 
 Why is little Billy crying ? 
 I'm going to work in a multi-national enterprise after graduation . 
 I'll do it someday . But it's not the right time now . I have to learn a lot by working as an employee . 
 you could say so . I'll work hard in that company and try to understand as much as possible about how to run an enterprise . 
 yeah , the success stories of that company might be useful for me . And their customers may become the potential ones for my own company . 
 well , I'll come up with a detailed business plan to attract the investors . 
 Rob lost his bike . 
 I heard Betty lost her tennis match this morning , so she's out of the tournament . 
 Me , too . I'm sure she'll do better in the next tournament . 
 What are you reading ? 
 Didn ’ t he sell worthless stocks to people or something ? He got arrested for that , didn ’ t he ? 
 If I remember , he got off with a light sentence . Something like three years in a minimum-security prison . 
 I think the government fined him a small amount , and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . He ’ s still a millionaire . 
 I know . And some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes $ 500 at most and ends up in jail for five to ten years . 
 sure . A UFO is just a space vehicle from another planet . If you think about it , our space shuttles are UFOs . 
 I've seen photos of UFOs in America before , but they've all looked doctored up . 
 I think there must be . 
 I don't't think it would make sense if we were the only beings in this whole world . The world is just far too big for that . 
 no , but we're trying to contact them . 
 I think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet , humankind will not become extinct . 
 there's a lot of evidence that suggest it will , but I don't think it's going to happen any time soon . 
 Yes , I've been thinking about visiting you . I hope to get some advice from you . 
 My field is electronic engineering . Which country do you think I should go ? 
 Which university should I apply to ? 
 Oh , I see . Thank you very much . 
 You gossip ! What's the basis of your opinion ? 
 I don't believe it . Jean is such a kind lady . How could she do this ? 
 Maybe ! 
 Yes , but do you have a prescription with you ? 
 I'm afraid you can't buy any medicine without a prescription from a doctor . 
 Then you can buy Aspirin . 
 Yes , here this is . 
 Thank you and take care . 
 Oh , yes , it is . 
 That's a good idea . 
 It's mild , but it's not always pleasant . 
 I like spring . The days are long and the night are short . The flowers are in bloom.We go on picnics . 
 I work for Thomas Cook Travel . 
 I'm a guide . I take people on tours to countries in South America , like Peru . 
 Yes , it's a great job . I love it . And what do you do ? 
 Oh ? Where do you work ? 
 Which restaurant ? 
 Yeah . Just pull on this strip . Then peel off the back . 
 If they don't think this is fun , they're not meant to be our friends . 
 Yeah . But it's fun . Look at those two ugly old ladies ... or are they men ? 
 I knew you'd come around ... 
 We planned our wedding for next May . 
 Yeah , I did . But my fiancee has an important project . 
 Julie ’ s friend , Mary . And John will be the best man . 
 Hey ! Fred , you are five minutes earlier than me today . Usually , you don't . 
 What's your meaning ? 
 You are a thief ? 
 You mean it is a still virtual game . Your friends steal your vegetables time and time again , and you take theirs as well , right ? 
 Don't be addicted to the game . It's not good for your job . 
 I'll pay attention to my handwriting next time . 
 Yes , I'm serious this time . 
 On the contrary , I think he's very serious . 
 So they're easy to remember . 
 He's an old antique , very serious . 
 Hey ! How about your history teacher ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . 
 Oh yeah and decorating the house too was colored paper and pictures . they will put a Christmas tree just inside the front door , pained toys and colored electric lights along the branches and plays all the gift packages under it . 
 Sure our thing . 
 Thanks . 
 What's on tonight ? 
 Who is in this movie ? 
 How long have you been in Taiwan ? 
 So , where did you grow up ? 
 I am not sure , where exactly is it ? 
 No , I was born in Gaoxiong , I only moved to Taipei after I graduated . 
 Don't be scared . Bite the bullet and everything will be right again . 
 What's your schedule like this year ? 
 What's your major ? 
 Oh , don't you have to take that class on 18th century poetry ? It's really difficult . I hear the students in that class have to write a paper a hundred pages long . 
 When is it due ? 
 Remind me never to sign up for that course . 
 I sure did . You're in luck ! It's supposed to snow all week in the mountains ! 
 It is kind of strange though , to have snow in April , and so much of it . 
 When you put it that way , I guess the skies can't hold out on us forever . 
 It will be the best as long as the weatherman is right . 
 It depends on the weather . 
 That'll be great . 
 Yes , I am studying in Eastern Asian language department . 
 I major in Japanese . 
 Its very helpful . The course has let me into a world of literature . I read so many great literatures . 
 Yes , nobody was with her . 
 In Thailand . 
 Yes . yes , I am sure . 
 Quite sure . I mean that hair of hers and the voice of hers . 
 It takes two to make a quarrel and it takes two to mend fences . 
 Is that you , Dave ? Oh , my gosh ! The backstabber who left us to work for the evil WebTracker ! 
 I'm filthy rich ! Haven't you heard about the MicroPower deal ? 
 That's right . For seventy-five million . So how are you ? 
 The summer vacation is coming . Have you any plans ? 
 I am going on a hiking trip . It's good exercise as well as fun . 
 So why not come and join us ? Lee will come as well . 
 It seems that something is praying heavy on you.What ’ s the matter ? 
 What did you do to get his goat ? 
 We need to elect club officials before the summer starts . 
 Let's make it the first item of business in our next meeting . 
 Can you take care of sending out a bulletin by e-mail to all the club members ? 
 Let's schedule the actual election times the week after the nominations . Doesn't that seem logical ? 
 How's business ? 
 are you looking for a course ? 
 what kind of program are you looking for ? Full-time or part-time ? 
 what kind of course are you looking for ? 
 do you want a one-to-one private tutor or a group class ? 
 have you ever considered taking one of our online courses ? 
 that's fine . If you want , you can sign up for a pre-sessional interview . 
 one of our qualified teachers will interview you so that they can find a class that suits you best . 
 sure . Here's a brochure about out English classes that meet in the evenings . 
 Hi , Mr . Zhang . What ’ s wrong ? You don ’ t look so happy . How was your date ? 
 Me ? I ’ m even less experienced than you are . 
 Believe it or not , I guess American women like a man in good shape , which Chinese women may not care about so much . That ’ s my honest opinion . I know you have been trying very hard . 
 No , that ’ s not true . I ’ Ve met two American women who were married to Chinese . But those Chinese look very strong and healthy . So if you exercise more often , I bet it will surely be easier for you to date American girls . How old is Jacky Chan ? He ’ s small and short . But I bet he can have any American woman he wants . 
 Why don ’ t you try then ? Even if it doesn ’ t help you find an American girl , you could still have a stronger and healthier body . You won ’ t lose anything by doing that . 
 Open the door . It's me . I can't find the key . 
 Oh , thank you . I am exhausted . Will you bring me a cup of tea ? 
 So let's eat out . 
 Noodles . How about you ? 
 Recently , there prevails ' Net Love ' ! 
 Two people chat on the Net and step by step fall into love ! It's Net Love . 
 Maybe yesterday you've received a man's woos . He's called ' Beast ' ? 
 I watched the screen display ! 
 It's typical Net Love , and a typical lesbians ' homosex ! HA ! 
 What shall we do tonight ? 
 That's a good idea.We haven't been there for ages . 
 Oh , I don't know.It depends . 
 I'm tired of Mexican food . Besides , you picked the restaurant last week . 
 Tom's dating your sister . 
 It's almost 6:00 . I'd better be going . 
 It's really nice of you . Thanks ! 
 Sorry to hear that . 
 Fine , we'll be expecting you then . 
 Yes , I do . I think that science is making us wiser . What do you think ? 
 I believe industry is making us wealthier . 
 And in my opinion , medicine is making us healthier . 
 I don ’ t agree with you . I maintain that we ’ re healthier , wealthier and wiser than we were a hundred years ago . 
 How was your date recently ? 
 I guess so . Going to watch a movie and having dinner at a restaurant are usual . 
 Yes , now many girls want to be independent , so it is a little popular , especially among white collars . 
 Forget about it ! 
 It will be a long story . We have many differences , for example , she usually puts all her clothes into washing machine . That is the sort of thing I can not bear . 
 Yes . After so many years of hard work , I ’ d rather I had an office of my own . 
 I ’ ll be very glad if you would help . 
 Thank you . I wish I would . 
 Do you know who Ammo Hung is ? 
 You know only one aspect of him . Do you know what he would do in the kitchen ? 
 In the kitchen , with his wife by his side he still puts on quite a dinner time show . 
 Imagine a chef chopping vegetables on fast forward . Picture a man making a stir-fry , tossing the mixture up in the air , and then catching it , every last bit , in his work . And his culinary motto is ' Enjoy the moment . ' If you want to know hey theycook , visit www.StudioClassroom.com.tw for the recipe . 
 I would say it was a typical run-of-the-mill Hollywood thriller . 
 Special effects ? Baloney ! That movie was made on a shoestring budget . They've been using trick photography like that for years 
 You should read the book . The original story is much better and has a different twist at the end . 
 Read it yourself and find out ! 
 Yes . It is Everest , also called Zhumulangma in China . It is 8,844 . 43 meters above the sea level . 
 Actually , it is impossible because the mountain is covered with snow all year around . And is has heavy fog for most of the time . 
 Yes , it has been conquered by many people in history . 
 I'm most upset to hear that.Are you better now ? 
 I'm feeling down . 
 Alice , I never knew you had such a lovely voice . You really can sing , can't you ? 
 No wonder you can control your voice so well . You are a professional singer . 
 Well , a good teacher makes good students . 
 Mr.Keller , may I call at your home sometime the week ? 
 Well , when will it be convenient for you ? 
 I Don't know how they do it ! Our competitors have undercut us by 10 % percent on the price of our latest model . There is no way will be able to compete against that . We're barely breaking even with the present prices . 
 Profits are almost nonexistent now , we can't beat their price . How do they keep their price so low ? 
 You really think we can make it ? I don't have much faith in our ability to lower the price again . We're no match for them , the competition will beat us hands down . 
 Are you sure ? He doesn't look that old . 
 The city has got a traffic problem . 
 You said it . 
 Well , you seem to enjoy speaking English . 
 I hope so.You see , at the moment I find it difficult to get used to the teacher's speed and accent . I'm awfully worried , I can't reply as quickly as she seems to expect . 
 You know , speaking in class is a very good chance to put your English to practical use . 
 Yes . Can I ? 
 Yes . Is it OK with you ? 
 Yes . Do you mind ? 
 Yes . Will you let me ? 
 What sort of things do you grow in your garden ? 
 When is your garden at its best ? 
 Hi Kevin , how was your year at college ? 
 It was good . Do you have a girlfriend at school ? 
 Your tie is handsome . 
 Did you say that Ted was at your mercy ? 
 But he is not someone who can be led by the nose . 
 I failed the exam because I didn't study . 
 Good morning . Sanyu Restaurant . May I help you ? 
 We open at 6:30 , sir . 
 Yes , sir . What time would you like your table , sir ? 
 Fine ! I'll reserve a table for two at 8 pm , sir . May I have your name , please ? 
 Thank you , Mr . Davis . 
 I see . We have already received many bookings and though I can't guarantee anything , please be assured that we'll try our best , Mr . Davis . I hope you'll understand . 
 We'll try our best . 
 Wow , this is drop-dead gorgeous . 
 Don't remind me of that . This would be the last time I cut any classes for a basketball game . 
 I just can't help it . Oh , look at Clive , he is really a big hit . They are definitely gonna win . 
 Come on , 18 points already , they are never gonna catch up . 
 Thay are coming back to narrow the gap . 
 A secret weapon . They'd better set up the defense now . 
 Oh , man ! I can't believe it . A slam dunk ! 
 Look at that pretty girl . 
 What are the seasons like in your city ? 
 Does it ever rain in summer ? 
 What are spring and autumn like ? 
 Well , I live in the southern hemisphere , so our summertime is your wintertime , and vice versa . We get some rain in every season , but most is in winter . In winter , it sometimes gets cold , but our winters are usually quite mild . Summers are warm , but not hot . Spring and autumn are both very short-sometimes just a few weeks each . The weather is very changeable then-just like spring in your city . 
 No , I don ’ t . I go on a winter holiday instead . I go somewhere warm . 
 How do you think people get their personalities ? 
 Don ’ t you think people get their personalities from their parents ? 
 So why do you think many kids have personalities that are so different from their parents . 
 You might be right . I guess most parents want their kids to be like them , but kids today grow up in a different environment . You know , they know much more about the world from the internet , newspapers , and tv . 
 Maybe some of it . I think a lot of people blame TV and movies when the real problem is that the parents aren ’ t bringing their child up correctly . 
 Yes , that ’ s true . Your son is doing well at school , isn ’ t he ? 
 So , he ’ s not a bookworm ? It ’ s good that he has an outgoing personality . Some kids are very quiet and introverted . You wonder they ’ ll survive in the real world without their parents to support them . 
 Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ’ t you ? 
 I never understand the meaning of those painting . They are too abstract for me . I didn ’ t pay much attention in art class at school . 
 I like sculpture , especially that form ancient rome or Greece . What time are you thinking of going ? I ’ d love to go with you . 
 That sounds fine . What time shall we meet at the bus stop ? 
 your daughter will be back soon . I'm going to start making dinner . You can just watch some TV in TV room if you like . We just bought a new TV with a LCD screen . The remote control is on the coffee ta 
 this is supposed to be your vacation ; we'd like you to just relax . 
 ok , well , we're going to make a pan of lasagne , a salad , and some garlic bread . Here's the recipe . Do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ? 
 that's a good idea . Can you set the oven to 200 degrees Celsius ? 
 fine . I'll just get out the casserole dish , the saucepan , the salad bowl , and the baking sheet . 
 I don't think it's broken . 
 fine . I'll go vacuum . Let me know if you need any other help . 
 My pleasure.What a pity you have to leave so soon ! 
 You're welcome . Maybe next time we'll come to see you . 
 I promise the next holiday I have we're coming to visit . Oh , what's your flight number ? 
 They just announced the boarding call . 
 OK . Bon voyage and a safe landing . 
 Bye . 
 One of many abundant resources , I'd like to point out . 
 I think you'd better apologize . 
 Maybe not , but I advice you to say it was your fault . 
 My father failed in business . 
 Maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced . 
 No , not now . I have found a part-time job.So perhaps I can help my family to come over the difficulties . 
 Thank you . 
 It's nice to be here . 
 Just a club soda for me , please . 
 I want to check out these books . 
 I have it right here . 
 Are you sure ? 
 How much ? 
 I don ’ t have that right now . 
 I ’ ll do that soon . 
 Fine , how are you doing ? 
 What do you want to do ? 
 Where do you want to go ? 
 What kind of Italian food do you like ? 
 No , I don't , but I like pizza . 
 Let's change the subject . 
 Johnson ? I can't place them . 
 They've completely slipped my mind . 
 No , I don't recall a thing about them . 
 Hmm , I must be getting absent-minded . 
 Thank you . Here's a present for you . 
 I have never experienced a roller coaster . I want you to sit beside me . 
 You try to put on a brave face . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , goodbye and keep in touch . 
 Study study study ! I want to learn a lot . 
 Yes , I ’ m going to take some university courses there . 
 Yes , but I think it ’ s probably for the best . 
 Hey , I ’ m a pretty cool guy ; I ’ ll make friends . And I ’ ll have a lot of extra-curricular activities too . You know , like fencing or theater or something . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 Well , how about the Museum of Modern Art ? 
 Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building ? 
 I ’ ll sing you a song . 
 Most of my songs are sad , sorry . 
 OK , I ’ ll sing San Francisco then . 
 Yes.Oh , it's you , Linda . I haven't seen you for a long time.Well , come in and sit down.How about something to drink ? 
 Would you like tea or coffee ? 
 Here you are . 
 That sounds good . How are you doing , Linda ? 
 No . I'm just killing time . 
 Yes . I haven't been in his house for several weeks.When shall we start ? 
 All right . See you tomorrow . 
 Fantastic ! I enjoy clubbing , especially those clubs with live bands . The only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad , full of smoke , and the music is too loud , so conversations are not really possible . Once I nearly got burnt by a cigarette . 
 A wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . If I had drunk enough and I would have had the bold to punch him in the face . 
 How's your mother doing ? 
 That's too bad . I wish your mother can recover soon . 
 The trouble is not that . It is that he may suddenly remember something I promised him a couple of weeks ago , out of a clear blue sky . Then he complains that I have gone back on my words . 
 He never does , and in fact , he seldom communicates with him . 
 Yes , I did . He only takes side with him . He seldom asks what Dick is doing . 
 I don ’ t have the slightest clue . 
 I ’ m not sure . 
 PCC is perfectly fine for me . 
 That ’ s not a bad idea . 
 You have a point . 
 I ’ m just going to keep going to PCC . 
 Hi , Sterling ! 
 Professor Wood ? I think he's a brilliant scientist . 
 I guess so . 
 I know , we've met . 
 Yes , we met last year at a conference . 
 No . I'm tired and I've got to work tomorrow . 
 Yeah . I need to . 
 What happened with that guy at the cafe ? 
 But you ’ re crazy about him ? 
 Why don ’ t you run off with him ? What are you waiting for ? 
 Really ? 
 Oh , let me guess . Through the internet ? 
 Hmm . You ’ Ve got mail . 
 I like him very much . He ’ s a gay dog . 
 I am all set . He can come anytime . 
 I used to work as a teacher . 
 Oh , if I hadn't moved here I would never thought of changing it . 
 Thanks to your help.To our friendship . 
 Dancing . The boys from the Campus Band have promised to play music for us . 
 I'll surely make introductions for them . 
 Yes . I like it very much . 
 It's excellent . 
 It's delicious . 
 I like beefsteak very much . Have you tried Chinese dishes ? 
 Well , it's getting late . I have to get up early tomorrow . So I must say good night . 
 To be a revolutionary needs great courage ! 
 Galileo is one of them . 
 I think Andy's party will be fun . 
 What's that ? 
 Sure . Oh , that reminds me . Could I borrow your black leather boots ? 
 Hot in here , isn't it ? 
 Is it Ok if I sit here ? 
 Thanks . My name's Bill Peters , by the way . 
 Nice to meet you . And what do you do , Susan ? 
 Oh , are you ? And what are you studying ? 
 Really ? 
 I'm an engineer , I work for Boeing . Say , would you like a drink ? 
 So , Fred , what are your plans for after graduation ? 
 That's cool . Have you already found an apartment to live in ? 
 I couldn't even if I wanted to . My parents told me that if I went home , then I'd have to find my own place . 
 Not really , they just don't want me living at home . My older sister did that , and she lived at home for seven years . Once she started living at home , it got harder and harder for her to move out . 
 My parents just didn't handle my older sister very well , and because of that , they want me to be more independent . They think that it's important that I should learn how to live on my own . 
 I'd love to continue this conversation , but I really need to go now . I have to get back to the office . 
 Okay . Would you like to have lunch some day next week ? 
 Hmm . I'm afraid I can't make it on Monday . I've got to fly to Chicago on business . 
 Wednesday ? Let me see . Hmm . Somehow I think I've already got something scheduled for Wednesday . Oh , yes ! I've got an appointment with my dentist to have my teeth cleaned , and it's essential that I keep it . 
 So that leaves Friday . I don't have any obligations or commitments on Friday.How about you ? 
 You know , I really must be going now or I'll be very late . Can you give me a call tomorrow an we'll decide ? 
 It ’ s Tuesday today . I always go to my class on Tuesday night . 
 Well , I ’ m learning how to use math in the business environment . 
 The job market is so competitive nowadays . I want to develop some useful skills . 
 It ’ s going all right . I ’ m learning some things for the first time , but I ’ m also brushing up on some things that I already know . 
 Which one ? 
 She is Miao Li . She's come here to see her brother . 
 OK . She's a costume designer and works in a garment mill . 
 She looks very beautiful . She is a nice girl . 
 No , she hasn't . 
 How may I help you ? 
 You need to apply for a passport . 
 You can apply right now . 
 Fill this out , please . 
 I will need to take your passport picture . 
 It will take about three weeks . 
 What are you thinking about ? 
 Again ! 
 Mr . : For tomorrow , read pages 12 to 20 . Then do exercises one through ten on page 21 . 
 Mr . : No . You only do that when you write reports . 
 Mr . : For those of you who don't have a calculator , get one . 
 Mr . : Yes . By the way , review today's notes this evening . We may have a small quiz tomorrow . 
 It is beautiful ! Look , there are so many birds around it . 
 Listen to the sound of nature ! It's like music . 
 What are those ? 
 I'm going to take more pictures today . 
 So , is L . A . all it's cracked up to be ? 
 And , is it what you found ? 
 You're right . Life isn't always like the movies . 
 Morning . Can I help you ? 
 All you need is your student identification card to check out books . 
 That's all you need . 
 You can check out two books at a time . But you can't check out newspapers , magazines and periodicals , they have to be read within library . 
 For two weeks . After that you must renew the book if you wish to keep them longer . 
 Yes , over there to your left . 
 Yes , the weather is wonderful , the game is wonderful and the players are wonderful . 
 He certainly is . He is the Peckham in our collage . 
 Thank you for organizing this great baby shower for me ! I ’ Ve always been to baby showers but never actually had one held for me ! Let ’ s get started ! 
 Oh look ! What a great little bib for the baby ! This will definitely come in handy ! Oh wow , you also got me a stroller ! That ’ s so great ! Thank you ! 
 A highchair and car seat ! Wow Betty , thank you so much ! I really appreciate it ! 
 A playpen and crib ! Thanks Carla ! This is just what I needed ! 
 Umm . I think my water just broke ! Get me to a hospital ! 
 You can check out two books at a time . 
 For two weeks . After that you must renew the books if you wish to keep them longer . 
 Well , I ’ Ve got some papers due . 
 Not too good yet . Better than I was though . 
 You'll see the world-famous magnificent waterfall . 
 Your dream will come true . It's really breathtaking 
 That is just an excuse.You can always find some time to exercise . 
 Bill , you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing.And skipping meals will not help you lose weight.In fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals . 
 How about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ? 
 I know , I know.Have you got a portable radio ? You can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time . 
 Excuse me , how can I fill in this blank ? What does marital status mean ? 
 No , I'm still single . 
 Good morning , you look very tired . 
 Did you hold a party or something else yesterday ? 
 I don't like this program , because there are too many constant arguments between the judges . 
 Do you have much time watching TV ? 
 I don't like ads , either . But ads could bring big profits to the TV station . 
 You should draw a picture of a fancy kingdom of animals in forty minutes . 
 Just imagine , if a horse can fly , if a bird can swim ... and things like that . 
 OK . Here you are . Anybody who wants help , please come to me . 
 Mom , I've got something to tell you . 
 Aunt Jane buys a new bike for Tom . He is putting on grand airs . 
 It is great . But Tom's bike is so much better than mine . 
 Nothing of that sort ! 
 Mom , it's OK . I will buy a big car one day . It is faster than the bus . 
 Let me see.Yes . I will buy a plane for you . There is no traffic up there . 
 I'm going out this Saturday . 
 Unfortunately , we do . Let's plan for something together for Wednesday . We can go right after work . 
 We won't have much time , so let's play somewhere close to work . 
 How much does it cost over there ? 
 That's pretty good . Let's do it . 
 Make it 4 
 Sounds good . I'll see you on Wednesday then . 
 Will do . 
 Um , very nice . It's warm in spring and cool in autumn . 
 Yes , it is , but not as hot as in Beijing . 
 He is playing hob with the fact . 
 Because he stayed with me all the time that night . 
 Not now . 
 Are you kidding ? I just feel tired right now . 
 But you just got here . Can ’ t you stay a little longer and have some tea ? 
 That ’ s too bad . 
 Thanks for coming . 
 Great idea . I ’ m looking forward to it . See you then . 
 Good night then . 
 isn't it wonderful walking here ? 
 I mean look at all these magnificent tall buildings around us . 
 it's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ? 
 what other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ? 
 what's there after that ? 
 what are all they for ? 
 Hi , Daisy ! 
 I hope you are Settling in at school ! 
 Good ! Me too ! By the way . you didn't tell me what you are studying here . 
 Really ? That's great . You hope to join a company after graduating ? 
 What about your friend Zoe 
 Accountancy ? Really ? She must be very good at figures . 
 I'm studying law . 
 Sure , welcome anytime 
 More than one . I think the count is now three , if I remember correctly . 
 I don't know . I know there are advantages to joining , but I'm not much into group stuff . 
 I think I'm going to decline . I just prefer to do my own thing . 
 My dad was , but not my mom . 
 Yes , I'm studying in the Foreign Languages Department . 
 I'm majoring in English . 
 Yes . The language is hard to learn , but it's interesting . 
 I'm reading a lot of books about the two countries . I like the culture . 
 You're right . 
 I'm fine thanks . How about you ? 
 Not a lot , actually . Busy at work of course - we've got a big project coming up in Malaysia . I may have to go to KL in a few weeks . 
 Probably in a week or two . I'll let you know . 
 What do you mean by cautious ? 
 Thats a clever way to escape responsibility . 
 You are kidding ! He just broke up with Ann . 
 I hope I will meet her soon . 
 You ’ re kidding . We ’ ll never make it across in one piece ! Let ’ s cross at the light . 
 If you want to cross here , be my guest . I don ’ t feel like dodging cars and scooters ! 
 Yes , of course . This is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines . 
 Thank you for the invitation . 
 Yes , please . Thank you for everything . 
 No , but we still stay in touch . 
 We contact through email . 
 Your words sound a bit reasonable . But don ’ t forget the time difference . 
 Joanna , I will go to the outlet center . You wanna go with me ? 
 I saw Emily yesterday evening . She was wearing a CD evening gown . She told me she bought it in the outlet center and she saved $ 120 ! 
 Hello Mike ! Would you like a drink ? 
 Were you celebrating something ? 
 It ’ s a bad idea to drink a combination of alcoholic drinks . You should stick with one for the whole evening . 
 I usually only drink beer and I rarely drink more than a few pints . 
 Let me buy you a soft drink then . How about a coke ? 
 Rally ? ... barman ! ... a large coke with ice and lemon , please ... thanks . Here ’ s the money . 
 Yes . I thought it might be interesting to learn a little about wine ... 
 Yes . I ’ m looking forward to it . 
 Yes , I do . I ’ ll walk you there . 
 Are you applying to study or work abroad ? 
 What do you want to study ? 
 Have you got your visa yet ? 
 I see . Is it your first interview ? 
 What happened ? 
 Why ? 
 I see . Well , good luck ! 
 I almost want to send him a virus to shut his stupid computer down . 
 True-well , do you have any forwards for me to send him ? 
 What does your sister look like , Mike ? 
 Is she like you ? 
 Is she as clever as you ? 
 Big head ! 
 On 20th May 1963 . 
 27th day of the fourth month . 
 It will begin at five thirty . 
 You can see it tomorrow . 
 See you . 
 Honey , do you have a second ? 
 We need to talk . 
 I ’ Ve been thinking , and well , I think we need to start seeing other people . 
 That ’ s just it , I ’ m not happy anymore , Tim . It ’ s not you , it ’ s me . I know that I can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! You are the type of guythat any woman would kill for ! 
 Tim , you are too good for me . You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . Oh , I could say that I ’ ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . I know I ’ d only hurt you , I know I ’ d only make you cry . 
 I can ’ t , Tim . I hope someday you can find some way to understand I ’ m only doing this for you . I don ’ t really wanna go but , deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do . 
 Here are your keys . I ’ ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . I ’ m sorry , Tim . I wish you all the best , and I hope that one day we can meet again . I ’ ll always love you . Goodbye . 
 No . What ? 
 No . Really , what happened ? 
 Was he out with the guys from the bank ? 
 Oh , yeah , they always get really drunk . 
 Oh , really . I thought he lived with his wife . 
 Oh , really ? Do you know why ? 
 He lost his wallet and keys . 
 Oh , no . 
 So then what happened ? 
 Well , that's a bit of a tricky situation . 
 What's your opinion about childless couples ? Will you choose to have no kids ? 
 Why ? Do you have to make a choice now ? 
 What's the puzzle ? 
 Oh , I see . I think the older generation tend to think in a different way . 
 Oh , really ? Maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren . 
 Definitely . 
 Don't worry . I think in most cases , children are the glue that keeps a family together . 
 Sure . You can fully enjoy your time together . 
 We're going to that new restaurant for lunch . Would you like to join us ? 
 Yes , I ’ Ve been got all his albums and most of his films on DVD . I adore him . He ’ s my idol . 
 Some of his early films are hard to find nowadays , especially the ones where he only played a bit part . 
 Yes . These posters are new . I bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday . 
 I was , but then I discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet , so I ’ m not a member now . 
 Of course ! I bought two copies . 
 How did you enjoy your family party at “ ginger ’ s ” ? I hear that they have a lovely menu and buffet . 
 I like the buffets they have , but if often order a la carte , because I don ’ t feel extremely hungry . I like the wine list there too . 
 Some restaurants allow you to take your own wine and just charge you corkage , but the don ’ t do that at “ ginger ’ s ” . what was included in the seafood buffet ? 
 Did they have lobster ? 
 Yes , it probably is . I don ’ t like ordering oysters in restaurants . You never know whether they are fresh . 
 When you eat out , do you usually eat from the buffet ? 
 Oh , you don ’ t usually have a starter ? 
 Harry , do you like the opera ? 
 Why is that ? It is called real art . 
 Yeah , that makes sense . 
 Um , okay . Well , I just want a trim . Nothing too fancy . 
 Okay . Um ... can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top . 
 Um ... no . 
 May doesn't get along very well with her mother-in-law . 
 Poor John ! He is bothering both sides of this bread . 
 what do you think about this store ? I heard it ’ s a posh store that ’ s only got branches in big cities . 
 don ’ t worry . I ’ Ve decided that for your birthday I ’ m going to take you shopping for a new dress . 
 I do , that ’ s why you should appreciate this gift ! 
 how about this red dress ? I think it would really suit you . 
 here you go.On any other day , it would cost me a fortune , but it ’ s on special offer today . 
 let me look . Let ’ s see ... they ’ Ve got one in blue , green , pink , black ... and white . Here you are . 
 I think you look fantastic . Happy Birthday ! 
 Judy , what is everybody talking about ? 
 You ’ re kidding . It can ’ t be true . 
 Really ? I ’ m surprised . 
 Do you think that climate change is responsible for the recent floods ? 
 It seems that the climate in this country is changing . 
 I think that the changing climate is a sign that we are causing too much damage to the environment . 
 Me too . If we don ’ t do something soon , It might be too late . 
 Yes , unbelievably cheap . Carlsborg is less than $ 1 . 
 It's fashionable . 
 Mary , it's not about the blind following . What matter is I enjoy in drinking . It's like when you get off of work . You're so tired . You need to get relaxed . You can't just turn on the TV and keep watch the programs until you fall asleep . You need to make your after work time more fun . 
 Drinking is just part of it . I mean , you have a bunch of friends coming by and having fun . You drink and talk . And the more you drink , the more you talk . It makes me so relaxed . 
 It's a long time ago . When I first went to a bar to pick up girls there , I saw the most beautiful girl sitting and sipping a coke . Then I went up to her and said ' can I buy you a drink ? ' 
 Then I talked to her and got her number . You know what ? When you don't know what to say ? Just drink . 
 What is your favorite pastime ? 
 Is it ? Mine is climbing mountains on Sunday mornings . 
 hello , Deva , how are you ? 
 not bad . Have you heard Wendy divorced her husband ? 
 Yes . They used to be joined at the hip . 
 yes , she said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things . 
 you said it . You know , they fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage . 
 yeah . We Chinese have quite different lifestyles and values from foreigners . 
 we've heard so much about Chinese film stars divorcing foreigners . 
 Here's Copellini's , my cousin's store . 
 Admit it . You just think of Mussolini . 
 Ah , yes . The Italians do love the sensual forms of the human body . 
 Yeah-all from Italy . See all the saints ? They're important to Roman Catholics . 
 It's okay . 
 Don't be silly . 
 Alright . Next time , we can try some other flavors . 
 Definitely . I really like Italian food . 
 Why , Jerry ? Your words just came out of the blue . 
 I work very hard and that's it , you know , practice makes perfect . 
 I have no idea . 
 Well , Jerry , let me tell you a secret . 
 My IQ score is slightly above average . 
 Maybe I've got a higher EQ . I'm not sure . 
 You can say that again , Jerry . And I'm sure you're high in both of them . With a little more time cracking the books , you can also get high marks . 
 Let's go ! 
 I couldn't agree with you more . 
 You know all about coffee . I need your advice , so I won't look stupid when I order . 
 Come on , Hugh ! Tea is for wimps ! Please , I need your help . 
 Now you're talking . That sounds good . What is it ? 
 He was 20 years old then . 
 He's over sixty . 
 Yes . Why ? 
 Just asking ? But why is your face burning like mad ? Ah-huh , someone has a crush on Jenny , doesn't he ? 
 Come on , Ted , don't be such a chicken . If you like her , you've got to tell her . Maybe she likes you . 
 What're you so afraid of ? Just tell her what you're feeling about her . 
 But that's better than keeping everything to yourself . You've got to let her know . Come on ! You've got to take a chance ! Even though you are rejected , it's not the end of the world ! There's nothing to lose , is there ? 
 It looks like it's going to be sunny . 
 They say we're going to get some rain later . 
 Does anyone need a drink ? 
 It's still stocked , and there's plenty of ice . Here you are-cheers ! 
 No , we walked . Why , do you need us to carry some stuff home later ? 
 Thanks a million . 
 Would you honor us with a visit ? 
 When will you be convenient ? 
 Are you doing anything tomorrow ? 
 I'll pick you up at about nine o'clock , will it do ? 
 Would you mind if I use your tape-recorder ? 
 I'll give it back to you in a couple of days . 
 What are you doing this weekend ? 
 I was thinking of maybe taking a drive to the beach . 
 Would you be interested in joining me ? 
 I thought that we could leave around 8 
 That was part of my plan . 
 Congratulations on your success in the competition . That is quite something . 
 I think luck played a very small part in your victory . It is solely due to your hard work and efforts . That brings honor to you and joy to us . 
 It is real word . 
 Oh ! You're engaged ! What a beautiful engagement ring ! Who to ? 
 When's the wedding going to be ? 
 Are you having a big wedding ? 
 But what do you say about that ? 
 Perhaps I'll agree with Mike . I couldn't stand a big wedding with many relatives and friends of my parents or my wife whom I'd never met before . 
 No , it ’ s my sister . 
 She ’ s 18 . 
 Yes , she is . 
 Well , just a little thin . 
 Pretty good , thanks . And you ? 
 The United Nations should have more authority . 
 Hi , Sterling ! 
 Professor Wood ? I think he's a brilliant scientist . 
 I guess so . 
 Yeah . Li Na's mother has been building a fire under her since her neighbour's daughter got married with a Canadian . She's almost driving Li Na crazy . 
 She a as meek as a lamb . She never goes against anyone or anything . She's as good as gold , you know ? 
 I ’ m afraid we ’ re in for a rough weekend , Mary . There is a storm system moving through the East Coast . It will be drizzling all day today , and there ’ s a 60 percent chance of thunderstorms this eve 
 Unfortunately , yes . It will be clear early Saturday morning but there is a high chance of showers and thunderstorms later in the day . There is a severe thunderstorm warning for some parts of the Sout 
 It gets better on Sunday , though . The storm systems move east and the skies will clear up at night . It will still be rather cool , with highs in the low 50s . The West Coast will be experiencing some 
 I am 24 . 
 I was born on April 15 , 1986 . 
 A Korean film called Friends , starring Sang Dong-gun . 
 How did you like the movie ? 
 Really ? I can't say I agree . 
 I guess I expected too much from the movie , so I was a bit disappointed . 
 Now the coals are just right . I can start grilling . 
 Thanks . Smell the hickory chips ? They give the meat a nice , smoky flavor . 
 Sorry . This is a one-man job . I've got the grill just how I like it , and I've made up my own special sauce . 
 Jimmy , I ’ d like to wear this robe for tonight cocktail party . What do you think of it ? 
 What ? But it is my favorite piece of clothing . 
 What am I going to do ? 
 Would you mind if I make a suggestion ? 
 Maybe you should try to quit smoking . You know it is very bad for your health . 
 You have made a big progress . Quitting smoking is not an easy job . But it will be rewarding in the long run . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Swimming . What about you ? 
 The Blacks got divorced . 
 Mr . Black has been getting a little on the side . 
 No , he doesn't . Anyway , his wife found out that he has been two-timing for a long time . 
 No . The only thing I've ever done behind your back is zipping you up . 
 You are freaking me out . 
 I heard that janet has got a new job . She ’ s working for the united investment group . I hear that they pay very well . 
 now , she ’ ll be able to save up for that holiday in the united states . 
 you ’ re right . By the way , did you hear that tom inherited some money recently ? 
 they did . He inherited the money form an uncle . I hope he doesn ’ t lose a lot of it in taxed to the government . 
 he said that he would probably invest most of it . He ’ s got a well-paid job , so he doesn ’ t need the money to cover day-to day expenses . He just wants some extra money available for when he retires . 
 really ? Have you won a fortune in the lottery ? 
 It certainly was ! So , what are you going to do with your windfall ? 
 No , we're not . We've been drifting apart for a while . 
 We did , but since she started her new job , all she does is hang out with her new friends from work . 
 I could , but all they ever talk about is work , so I always end up feeling left out . 
 I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her ! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her . 
 You're right . She would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge . But she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore . 
 I've given her enough time . I'm over it now . 
 I think I just have to accept the fact that it's time for us to go our separate ways . 
 I ’ m very fond of you . 
 Why ? You mean a lot to me . 
 What question ? 
 You know that I care for you . I .. I ’ m proud of you . 
 I .. I don ’ t feel like saying it . 
 Many thanks for your present . I'm so glad you are able to come . 
 I need to make some copies . 
 Does it cost to use it ? 
 How much does it cost ? 
 How many copies am I allowed to make ? 
 Would you mind showing me how to use it ? 
 Oh , okay . Thanks . 
 My friend and I was argued with each other . For this , I ’ m very sad . Because I don ’ t want to lose this friend . 
 Thank you , but I really want to relax myself . I ’ m very sorry . 
 Hi , I haven't seen you in a while . 
 How long has it been since we last saw each other ? 
 What have you been doing for the past two years ? 
 What are you majoring in ? 
 You should easily be able to find a job with that major . 
 Here you are at last ! You're half an hour late , you know . 
 What happened ? 
 I'm sorry for spilling my drink on your rug . 
 But I ruined your rug . 
 Hey ! How was your first day of class ? I ’ m in level two and I ’ m loving my class this semester ! It ’ s great being in a class of international students ! 
 That ’ s both fortunate and unfortunate . It ’ s the United Nations in my class ! We have people from all over the world ! There are three Germans , a Pole , a Scottish , two French , an American , a Brazilian , a Chilean , a New Zealander , though he prefers to call himself a Kiwi . Who else do we have ? Oh , we also have a Moroccan , a Togolese , a Pakistani , and two Indonesians ! 
 Well , I think you ’ re pretty lucky actually . You ’ ll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture . 
 Don ’ t ! Stay the course ! Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful . I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice . 
 Well , there is that , yes . 
 What kind of business do you do ? 
 What kind of clients do you prefer ? 
 I used to work for a shipping company for six years , and I am quite familiar with some managers . Would your like to meet them ? 
 Anne ! I haven't seen you for ages . How've you been ? 
 Not bad . It really is great to see you again . W here have you been ? 
 I didn't like my brother's batting around without doing anything useful . 
 I hope so . 
 Would you please be quiet , Ladies and Gentlemen ? 
 Quiet everybody ! 
 Yes . May I help you ? 
 Yes . 
 Nice to meet you , John . 
 So , have you seen all three The Lord of the Rings movies ? 
 That's the Return of the King , right ? 
 I thought the special effects were amazing , but I got a bit confused . The plot was too complicated for me . 
 No . did you ? 
 Yes , trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me . 
 Most movies are . Another problem for me was the film was dubbed in German with English subtitles . 
 I heard that The Return of the King was nominated for 11 Oscars . 
 Jill , how do you like your new job ? 
 I just heard through the grapevine something about you landing a job with some travel agency down town . You can still fill me in on tile details . 
 Sure , I think I know the place . 
 That ’ s really great , jill . So , what do you do there exactly ? 
 Don ’ t tell me your ’ re already bucking for a promotion . 
 Well I wish you luck . 
 I got rid of that clunker . This is my new one . 
 Hop in , I'll give you a ride . 
 Yeah , it costed a bundle , alright ? 
 Yeah , this sucker is the fastest thing I've ever owned . 
 We are on the high way . Find the pound shade .. 
 It's a great feeling . 
 Thanks , Daisy . 
 What happened ? 
 Ben , we ’ re fifteen . What kind of job are you looking for ? 
 Uh-huh . 
 Hello , Ellen . 
 Oh , no ! What happened ? 
 How awful ! Was he hurt ? 
 How did it happen ? 
 How horrible ! 
 I hope he ’ ll be all right . 
 My son has really taken it out of me . He never keeps out of mischief . 
 Yeah . Anyway he is driving me mad . 
 Well , everybody wants the bottom bunk . Why don't we flip a coin for it ? 
 Yes . Here's a quarter . I flip it , you call it in the air . 
 Sorry , it's tails . You lose . 
 Your stereo is better than mine . Do you mind if we use yours ? 
 Probably we can put one on that counter . And we can put one on the floor by the bed . Over there . 
 Well , the desk by the window is nicer , of course . Don't you think ? 
 So since I got the bottom bunk , why don't you get the desk by the window ? That would be more fair . 
 I mean , we could flip a coin for it , but I would probably win again . I'm incredibly lucky you know . Especially with girls . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 Oh , certainly . Certainly . I'm always willing to help beginners.Just call me Big Brother Dave . 
 C'mon , don't take it seriously ! I'm just kidding . 
 Why don't we start unpacking these boxes ? 
 Alright . See you later . 
 But , we just finished eating lunch . 
 I'd strongly recommend that you wait for a while before going swimming . 
 I've been through a lot today . I forgot to set my alarm clock last night , so I woke up late this morning . And what is worse , I missed the school bus . 
 I think we should accept his plan . 
 Why ? 
 Not a single email until now ? it's already twelve o'clock . I can't believe it ! 
 Yeah , that's right . If no one sends me text messages , I'll go crazy . 
 Addiction ? checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction ? no way ! 
 Absolutely . 
 Yeah , it's a must . Otherwise , I may miss important phone calls and text messages . 
 Yes . MSN , QQ , Skype , Google Talk , Ali wangwang , everything , so that I'll be in touch with all friends and relatives . 
 Do you like chocolates ? 
 Do you like coffee ? 
 And do you like English food ? 
 It's getting late . 
 There must be something weighing on your mind . What is it ? 
 Don ’ t worry . I'll buy a new necklace as same as the old one . 
 Could you tell me the time ? 
 What time is it , please ? 
 Wow , that terrible movie is finally over . Next time I ’ m picking the film , because I don ’ t want to end up seeing a chick flick . 
 Not everything , just this film . Even the title is ridiculous , and it ’ s so long , those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life , so much so that I ’ m thinking about asking them to give me my money back . 
 I ’ m only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage . 
 Next time , go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings . 
 Love stories ? More like one-night-stands . 
 My friends ? Fat ? What about those whales you call friends ? 
 How about going swimming ? 
 Why don ’ t we down to the pool ? It ’ s not too far from here . 
 I want to go to china for sight-seeing.What do you think of it , Mum ? 
 Will you go with me , too ? 
 Mr . : Are you Mary Lin ? 
 Mr . : I'm Mr . Rogers , your homeroom teacher . 
 Mr . : Why don't you sit behind Brad ? 
 Mr . : He's that guy in the blue shirt . 
 Mr . : As soon as the bell rings after the morning announcement . 
 Thank you . Wow , your school has so many honors . Congratulations ! 
 Excuse me . I wonder see Dean Mr . Lee first . I was wondering if could you tell me where his office is ? 
 Excuse me ? 
 Thank you very much . It ’ s very kind of you . 
 This is it ? 
 Excuse me , miss . I'm Bob . 
 I'm very glad to meet you . May I have this dance with you ? 
 No , I don't often dance . Isn't this a wonderful party ? 
 How do you like fox-trot ? 
 You dance beautifully . 
 Thank you . 
 Sure . Let ’ s go . What are you going to have done ? 
 A foot massage sounds like a great idea . They are very relaxing . I ’ d also like to have a mudpack on my face . It ’ s supposed to help with your complexion . 
 This could become a very expensive trip to be beauty parlour ! 
 Oh , I agree . We both work hard and a little beauty treatment can relieve stress . 
 What ’ s special about a thai massage ? 
 Sounds painful ! 
 Thanks . 
 My sister did it . When did you get yours cut ? 
 Well , it looks very nice . 
 What's the matter ? 
 Is Jack still staying idle everyday ? 
 Really ? He is so competent now . 
 Sandra is actually a blue chipper . I don't think she could realize that she has married a fool for women . 
 I feel sorry for her . 
 Paul , what kind of music do you like to listen to ? 
 I have tickets to a show . Do you want to go with me ? 
 Pop . It's Maria Carey . 
 At 8P M tomorrow night . 
 Yes , that's a good idea . 
 Oh , I think I know the place you mean . We ate there last month , right ? 
 Hello , ladies . I'm firing up the grill . We can eat in an hour or so . 
 Yi-jun , we're in the States . Here it's all burgers , steaks , and dogs . 
 You can put stuff on the picnic table . Back to work . The grill is calling me ... 
 Is Water Shrinking Festival official ? 
 Don't you think these festivals are more interesting ! 
 Hey man , what do you have on tap ? 
 Cool , give me a pint of Heineken and half a pint of Bud . 
 Sure ! Let ’ s have some nachos and mozzarella sticks . 
 Wait ... What ! 
 Well , he ’ s really lucky . It seems that he could win the bet at every turn . 
 I know what you mean . I ’ m not only after bucks . There ’ s something more in life . 
 Yeah ? You finally decided to wipe the slate clean ? 
 So what are you going to do ? Take up an art class or something ? 
 I ’ m with you on that one . Anything else you ’ re planning on doing ? 
 It ’ s about time ! 
 You moved to a new place ? 
 Thank you for inviting me . Sounds lovely ! I would like to come . Where is your new apartment ? 
 Who else will come ? 
 Ok , I will be there around 6 . Is that ok for you ? 
 Did you remember to bring back that software I lent to you ? 
 That ’ s ok . If you could just bring it in tomorrow , I would appreciate it . 
 I wouldn't dare go bungee jumping . 
 Hello , could you arrange a dinner for us ? 
 Eight o'clock tomorrow evening . 
 Ten . 
 Chinese food . 
 No , not too lavish . 
 What is the usual thing here ? 
 Let's say sixty Yuan then . 
 We'd like to have typical Chinese food . 
 No snakes , please . 
 Mao Tai and Qingdao Beer . 
 Right , thanks . 
 See you then . 
 I'm sorry , but I've got an important job to do . 
 Looking at the beautiful creatures and listening to their songs are such wonderful experiences . I feel as if I'm in direct contact with nature . 
 You bet . You should try it yourself . 
 It was exciting ! 
 What do you mean ? 
 I think the Romans do what everyone else does . 
 And Roman really loves life . He knows how to enjoy himself . 
 Really ? 
 By air of course . 
 Yes , why ? 
 Just asking ? But why is your face burning like mad ? Aha , someone has a crush on Anny , doesn't he ? 
 Come on , Josh , don't be such a chicken . If you like her , you've got to tell her . Maybe she likes you . 
 You've got to let her know . Come on ! You've got to take a chance ! 
 It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months . 
 I checked it out of the rental library . It only costs five cents a day . 
 I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter . 
 Do you know anyone who ’ s had plastic surgery ? 
 Why not ? Why can't we go back to the way things were ? 
 Darned right I would ! 
 Come on , Liz . Be open-minded ! Look at my eyes , they are puffy . And my eye bags , they are dark and loose and full of lines and circles . I really hope surgery can wipe out the tired feelings . 
 I don't care what other people think . I am ready for a lift . 
 I hope so , too.Rose and her husband have been wanting a boy so much . 
 But baby girls are just as good and just as fun as baby boys . 
 I have two finals this week and one oral presentation and I'm not ready for any of them ! 
 I hate this part of school . 
 I didn't mean to . Things just kept taking up all of my time . 
 I think I'd better . I have twenty four credits this time around . That might be a bit much . 
 I went bungee jumping yesterday . It was so exciting . 
 Yes , They are great fun and very challenging , too . Some day I'll want to try deep-sea diving and rock-climbing , too . 
 Yes . I love facing danger and overcoming it . It has become part of my life . 
 I want to think about it for some time . 
 I know . But your way doesn't touch my heart . 
 I can't tell you . 
 When I am angry and want to beat someone , you stand there and let me do what I want . Would you ? 
 Don't be so happy , it is just one of my tests ! 
 So does my father . I'm already used to it . 
 How dare you say that ? What they do is just for our good . 
 What are you doing tomorrow ? 
 Let's watch a movie or something . 
 I think they're playing Lord of the Rings 
 Where should we meet ? 
 Aright . I'll meet you there at one o'clock . 
 I'd be glad to . I love picnicking . 
 Can I bring my camera with me ? 
 I sure will . 
 Carrie , are you ok ? You seem a bit down . 
 Maybe it ’ s just that he is stressed out from work or something . He does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know . 
 Men are like that you know.They can feel nervous , anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness . 
 Talk to him , try to cheer him up when he is down and if that doesn ’ t work , I say get rid of him and get a new one ! 
 Is it going to rain today ? 
 I really hate this weather . 
 Would you like something to eat ? 
 Would you like to call home ? 
 Please use the phone . 
 You didn't come to work yesterday.What happened ? 
 What's wrong with him ? 
 Is he getting better now ? 
 How are you doing , Christopher ? 
 Are you doing anything this weekend ? 
 Are you available on Sunday ? 
 Ok , well , my friends and I are planning on going to the beach on Sunday . We tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere , so you could still sleep in . Do you want to come with us ? 
 It's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city . 
 We've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you'll have to bring your own sunlounger . 
 Do you like surfing ? 
 We've got a few . I can teach you how to surf on Sunday . It'll be fun ! 
 You'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . My friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money . 
 We'll pick you up at your place at noon . Be there or be square ! 
 Positive 。 
 I'am absolutely sure I'm right . 
 This is right . There is no doubt in my mind . 
 Check and double check . 
 I would love to help you prepare for your presentation . 
 This will not interfere with my work . I promise you that . 
 I could easily give you some time tomorrow night . 
 Yes , and could you write down anything you might be having trouble with ? 
 Goodbye until then . I promise you that you'll do well after we meet . 
 Stop talking about her . She gives me goose bumps . I never wish to be in her sight . 
 Many people , many tastes . She looks pretty , but the way she speaks gives you goose bumps . I feel sick of it . 
 Oh , yes , it was very interesting . 
 Oh , I didn't actually teach in the schools . I taught after school . I taught in English institutes . 
 Yes . That's right.But children in Taiwan are very different from children in America.At least as far as studying is concerned.Many children in Taiwan go to special institutes after school . 
 That's right.After their school day is over , they go to a special institute to study math or English.They are very serious about learning over there . 
 Of course they do.You know , Eliza , before I went over there I thought the same thing . I thought that maybe kids in Taiwan study too much.But now that I've worked there , and taught them , I feel it is a good thing.Their parents are very concerned about their education . More than American parents are . And that is good . American kids don't study enough . 
 So it was interesting for me to see parents very concerned about education.They would come to me after the class and ask how their son or daughter was doing . I don't think that's a bad thing . I think it's a good thing.In America , too many parents don't pay attention . 
 As an English teacher , I tried to make the lessons as fun as possible . I tried to have a good time with my classes . The students often enjoyed it.And if the students enjoyed it , they learned more . So it was a good experience . 
 That's a stereotype we Americans have.We think that Asian kids are very obedient and quiet.But it's not true . There are plenty of naughty kids too . 
 I don't know . In Costa Rica , I taught adults.So it was a very different thing . So I really can't compare . 
 that's very kind of you to say so . Let's try some after-dinner wines . 
 do you prefer brandy or ports . 
 excellent choice . I love its smooth flavor . 
 yes . You always have a good nose for wines . 
 oh , what's that ? 
 why not ? It sounds great . 
 thanks . Cheers . 
 Hey Mike . What are you doing tonight ? 
 Work is kicking my ass . I'm so stressed . Let's go grab a drink . 
 I say we get drunk tonight . I don't want to think about all this stuff . 
 We won't stay out too late . I just need to forget about work . 
 My wife and I didn't used to spend this much money . 
 My wife has been pregnant for 7 months . 
 My wife will be going back to work soon . 
 Yes.We will need milk powder and bassinet . 
 I know . Sorry , I shouldn't have rushed you , but I just couldn't stay at home and wait . 
 Why not ? I'd love to do that . 
 Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ? 
 I surely do . They must have had advanced machines in ancient China to do that . 
 Unbelievable ! I could never do that . 
 Listen ! Some people are singing outside . Is it the opera ? 
 Yes , let's do it . 
 Of course not . We don't do that . 
 I'll teach you how to keep her . 
 After you've solved this problem for me . 
 Thanks , Carla . That's quite a compliment coming from you . You always dress so tastefully . 
 No , not much . I got it on sale at the mall - 60 % off . 
 It's a promise . 
 It was fun , I tell you . 
 Well , we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning . It was a magnificent sight ! 
 Sure , we wouldn't miss that for anything . After that , we took a short cut to the park . There was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour . 
 Yeah , we spent the whole morning under the tall trees . We had our picnic there , too . 
 We went for a swim in the sea . That was the biggest part of the day . Just look at my nice tan ! 
 Yes , you are right . And I was so tired out that I fell asleep on the way back . My muscles are still stiff from the swim yesterday . 
 First , you need to have the list of books for your class . Do you have that ? 
 Well , when you have that , you can take it over to the bookstore . Can you find it ? 
 Just pass the gym and it's the first door on your left . Were you aware that you can also turn in your old textbooks for money ? 
 Take your used textbooks with you and give them to the representative near the entrance . He will pay you for them . Are you going today ? 
 I could help you with buying your books if you meet me there at 1 
 I'll see you later then . Have a great day ! 
 But , I want to ride it , Daddy . 
 Great . Let's go . 
 I ’ m looking at my horoscope for this month ! My outlook is very positive . It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic , and that I will have a passionate summer fling ! 
 It ’ s a prediction of your month , based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in . I was born on April 15th , so I ’ m an Aries . When were you born ? 
 Let ’ s see . . . you ’ re a Capricorn . It says that you will be feeling stress at work , but you could see new , exciting developments in your love life . Looks like we ’ ll both have interesting summers ! 
 No , it ’ s not , your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality . See ? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize . 
 A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical . She likes to do things in conventional ways . That sounds just like you ! 
 Our place is spotlessly clean , compared with others . 
 In fact , I just swept the floor three days ago . 
 I bet nobody will care about it . 
 $ 120.The small gift box is complementary . 
 Thank you ! Have a nice day ! 
 You shouldn't have told her the truth.What can we do now ? 
 You are always like this . I've told you many times not to tell her . 
 It's too late to say sorry now.Oh , what am I going to do ? 
 Are you alright , Ethan ? You don't seem to be as cheerful as you normally are . 
 What happened ? 
 What did your boss say ? 
 That's horrible . Was that the first time you'd shown up late to work ? 
 Is your boss Chinese ? 
 What are you going to do ? 
 That sounds like a sensible plan . Do you want me to help you with your job search ? 
 Don't mention it . That's what friends are for ! 
 To tell the truth , I feel tired . 
 I had to visit all my relatives . 
 I didn ’ t go anywhere . I stayed at home . 
 Nothing . I just feel very lonely in this city . I miss my family . 
 Can you stay and accompany me for a while ? 
 Thank you so much . You are so sweet . 
 So you said you and Amanda met through a mutual friend . How did it happen ? 
 Did he tell you what she was like first ? 
 Sorry , sir . I came late because I had to send for the doctor for my grandfather . 
 Thank you , sir . 
 I heard many stories about your brother . 
 What does he look like ? Is he handsome ? 
 I've never met anyone like Clyde before . 
 Wow ! There are so many different people here . I expected mostly athletes and rappers . 
 Then I'll just shut up and sit down ! 
 I just bought a new atlas . I ’ m looking this map of the world . Look at Russia ! That ’ s a vast country . 
 There are several tiny countries in the world too . Countries like Monaco are smaller than many cities . 
 Britain is half the size of france , but great Britain is still one of the largest islands in the world . 
 It ’ s going to a volleyball match between the economic department and foreign language department this afternoon . Are any of you keen on volleyball ? 
 I ’ m afraid not . My favorite is boots-running . I don ’ t care about games . 
 Well , not everyone wants to drink beer . Make sure there are some soft drinks and juice . Nothing's as refreshing as iced drinks on a hot day . 
 Just buy a cask of wine . Have you bought ice yet ? 
 I think a bottle of champagne would be a good idea . It's appetizing and tasty . 
 Hi , John ! I haven ’ t seen you for ages . 
 I ’ m glad to see you , too . How ’ Ve you been ? 
 Not bad . I finally bought a house . It ’ s an old one , but built really solid . It is close to here . Do you want to come over for lunch ? 
 OK , next time you ’ re here . 
 I heard that you moved to Florida . 
 Tell me more . 
 Sounds great ! 
 I want to see Disney World , Sea World , Universal Studios , and Weeki-Watchee Springs . 
 I ’ m jealous . I ’ Ve never been to Florida . 
 That sounds great ! I ’ ll take you up on that invitation . 
 I sure will . 
 Count on it . And here ’ s my card . Don ’ t hesitate to call me anytime . 
 Well , I ’ m really glad we bumped into each other . Have a good trip . 
 I will . Good-bye . 
 I can't decide what I should do . 
 Should I date Tom or should I date Harry ? 
 I'll tell you something that's good about action movies . The special effects are great ! 
 That's just your personal prejudice . Do you know who was the director of the movie Titanic ? 
 Well , did you know he was also the director of The Terminator ? 
 Can I help you ? 
 We have some catalogues from U . S . universities . You may check in the reference stacks over there . 
 Well , generally in the U . S . each university has its own outstanding fields . But the graduate school accepts no applications after January 29th . 
 So you have to apply to begin the first semester next year . 
 Can you be serious for a moment , we've been dating for 6 months now , I really like you . I'd like to take a relationship to the next level . 
 It feels like you are not dedicate to our relationship . It seems like you treat it as a just casual dating . 
 I don't want to be like this . I think we should get step further . 
 Like what ? 
 It was only the cheek . 
 Oh , that is ridiculous . 
 Definitely not . 
 How did you get around over there ? Did you rent cars ? 
 I've heard about Enrail passes.So those Europeans really depend on trains a lot . 
 I know . Our train system is lousy.And besides , Americans love their cars too much . 
 It's too bad for the environment . So much pollution from cars . 
 Yes , I agree . I think it is a cultural characteristic.It would be very hard to get us Americans to change this.But you know what ? Probably , in the future , Americans will have to change . 
 Because the earth's environment can't tolerate cars forever . I think cars are already causing global warming.When the problem gets more serious , world governments will have to start limiting car use . 
 Wow ! I didn't notice the time.It ' s almost noon . I have to get home . 
 No , no problem . I have my car in the parking ramp around the corner . 
 See you around . 
 It's very hot , the temperature is often over 40C . 
 Not really.But I like it in spring and fall . I don't like it in winter . 
 The winter is very rainy , I don't like the rainy day . 
 I lived there for three years . I like summer but I don't like winter . 
 Yes , it is.But it's nice in spring and fall . 
 I appreciate that . 
 I bought it when I was on vacation in Nepal . 
 You ’ re leaving so soon . When are you off ? 
 how about I come and see you off ? 
 Ok . I ’ ll miss you . I hope we can see each other again soon . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Ok . Take care . I hope you have a good journey . 
 Of course . I will . 
 Herman , why are you so excited ? 
 Have you fallen in love ? 
 Can you describe the situation at that time ? 
 What's her outlook ? 
 Where is Tom ? 
 What ? It ’ s only 9 p . m . Now . Why today he went to bed so early ? 
 Oh , I see . 
 Really ? Thank you . I bought it in Spring Street yesterday . 
 Thank you.It ' s very nice of you to say so . 
 That's quite a compliment coming from you . 
 I am in Nanjing University . I am a junior . 
 Because it enjoys great reputation and it is located in my favorite city Nanjing . 
 Ii is distinguished for the strength of law and foreign languages studies .. 
 It is very dull , and the production isn't very satisfactory , either . 
 To be fair , both the costumes and scenery are marvelous . 
 Well , we'd better go to a musical comedy next time . I think the one we saw last month was very good . 
 Me , too . I hate to sit there and look at the same stage scenery one scene after another . 
 Neither . The game ended in two all . 
 But the Brazilian is tougher . 
 Oh , but I suppose he has lots of talents . 
 What are you studying all day long for ? It ’ s summer vacation ! 
 Why ? 
 Do you think it will help ? 
 Hmm ... Maybe I should sign up too . 
 Have you seen the new Hannibal Letter movie ? 
 Yes . What did you think of it ? 
 I liked it , too . It was scary , but not disgusting . I always enjoy watching Anthony Hopkins . He's brilliant . 
 Oh , yes , he is brilliant . What's the name of the young actor ? 
 Yes . He was excellent . They worked well together . 
 She didn ’ t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day ’ s hard work . 
 Hi charles , I want you know that i finally found an apartment in haitian . 
 Yeah , I am having a party this saturday night , a sort of house warming , and i want to invite you . are you busy ? 
 Around seven . 
 No , but thanks for offering , actually could you bring some fold-up chairs for people if you have any ? I am afraid not everyone's going to have a seat , do you have any ? 
 Don't worry , I will come to pick you up at about six thirty . 
 Did you watch the Oscars on Sunday night ? 
 Yes , that was surprising . I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go . 
 They're also one of the richest couples . They have so much money and they can buy almost anything they want . 
 Did either one of them win an Oscar this year ? 
 Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ? 
 I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves . 
 I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you . 
 Thank goodness we're not rich and famous ! 
 Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! 
 It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! 
 There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . 
 So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . 
 Yes . 
 I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . 
 Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . 
 He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . 
 C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . 
 You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? 
 I am a girl of many interests . I like dance , chess , collecting stamps , travelling and taking photos . 
 I like rumba and tango . 
 You can learn Chinese checkers or military chess . Both of them are much easier . 
 Yes , it is . But it is full of fun and knowledge . What about you , what do you like to do as hobby ? 
 Sounds pleasant . 
 Yes , it's one of the main air pollutants . Factories don't emit it directly into the air . It's actually formed when nitrogen oxides and VOC emissions come into contact with heat and sunlight . 
 Oh , Vous are ' volatile organic compounds ' . That's a technical term for solvents or other chemicals found in things like paint . 
 Well , it can cause smog , which can affect people's health - especially people with breathing difficulties . 
 Really ? He deserves it ! They should teach him a good lesson . 
 Then he is really lucky . 
 I don't have the day off . Our labor union is staging a nationwide strike today , all of the workers in our department are supporting the labor union by participating and not going in to work this week . 
 It happens quite often , actually.Whenever there arises a dispute between the union and the executive group , the first thing they do is to call a strike . Usually it only lasts a day or two before both sides can come to an agreement and we start work again . Anyhow , it's a nice , unanticipated holiday ... 
 I'll have to sleep on it . 
 I ’ m very sorry I can ’ t . 
 I ’ m afraid I have some business to attend to . 
 I ’ d love to but I have to help John with his math problems right now . 
 No , thanks . His home is not far and I can walk there . 
 Ok , thank you . 
 I think women excel in every sport except the ones that are taboo for us to join in , like football . 
 Why do you care ? Women and men are different all around . I don't think they can be compared . 
 Well , I know some women who love golf and I know others who love contact sports . 
 Are you suggesting that anyone can be ? 
 Well , I think you look very pretty in your polka dot purple dress with your hair piled at the rear . That makes you very graceful and mysterious . 
 Remember to match it with your glittering star-shaped necklace . Very attractive on formal occasions . 
 Sure , more elegant and taller . 
 If I were your date , I would be so charmed by you . 
 How's your new car ? 
 You made a good choice , then ? 
 No regrets . 
 I am glad you are happy . 
 Hey , let's eat out tonight . 
 No . Just want to relax a little bit . You don't have to win the lottery to relax , do you ? 
 Come on . It's on me . 
 Don't be silly . I'll take you anywhere you wanna go . 
 Dream on ! 
 No , I don't mind in the least . I want to do something of my own . What about you ? 
 who is your favorite NBA star ? 
 Kobe ? I know him , the key guy of the Lakers , a heck of a NBA player . He is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense . 
 Maybe he is not good ay rebounding ? 
 Kobe came to Beijing during this summer's Olympics . Did you go to the match between China and USA ? 
 well then , what are your spoils ? 
 Can I help you ? 
 Yes , but it's checked out . 
 It's popular you know . You want to reserve it ? 
 Fill out this form and we will send you a note when we get the book . 
 Take the card , and fill in your name and library card number . 
 What do you like to do with your free time ? 
 You mean you like to study English ? Why ? 
 Studying English wouldn't give me any satisfaction.It ' s hard work . 
 Good news ! 
 The state of economy is starting to go up in our country . 
 Mary ? Are you still there ? 
 Did your bid win ? 
 Hey ! I'm trying to be nice , and you still want to fight ! Did you get the statue or not ? 
 Sorry . I take that back . I mean the copper Buddha you wanted . 
 Of course not , help yourself . 
 I have a test tomorrow . 
 Sure . I've reviewed all the lessons I have learned this academic year . 
 I am 100 % certain . 
 I am sure I can get a 95 this time . 
 I know this characteristic of him . So I never think seriously of his words . 
 It seems that you don't like him . 
 Can we have two tickets for seven thirty ? 
 In the front , please . 
 Thank you . And what's on tomorrow ? 
 Can we get tickets now ? 
 That radio's pretty loud . Could you turn it down , please ? 
 Yes . And something else , please don't borrow my clothes without asking . 
 Does bullfight interest you much ? 
 So I ’ Ve got two tickets to the latest show but I need a little favor from you . 
 I'm afraid I spilled coffee on the tablecloth . 
 I want to apologize . Is there anything can do for you ? 
 I ’ m glad to have had the opportunity to meet you here . 
 I ’ m doing great , thank you . 
 Whoa , look at all those ice cream choices ! 
 I love anything with chocolate the best . 
 Is there any kind of ice cream you don't like ? 
 I haven't ever cared for that myself . 
 That sounds absolutely disgusting ! 
 Hi Colin . How are you feeling today ? 
 It's probably jet lag . 
 Do you want to visit any tourist spots in the city ? 
 Good idea . I ’ d be very happy to go there . 
 It ’ s a skill . What can I say ? I don ’ t know why , I just have a long routine . 
 Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , butoften times I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine . 
 Not funny . 
 No . I just went cold turkey , and I never smoked again . 
 Nice to meet you . 
 I ’ m Rose Teller . I think I ’ Ve seen you somewhere before ? 
 Yes , I was.You work for 3M , right ? 
 Good . 
 I ’ m a fashion designer.Next month , I have a fashion show . I ’ d love it if come . I can get you a couple of tickets.So you can bring a friend if you like . 
 Thank you . 
 It's not cheesy ! It's romantic . When it first came out , I saw it in the theaters five times in one week . 
 Alright , maybe it's a little bit cheesy . But come on , isn't it fun to go to a cheap flick once in a while ? 
 Haha , that's definitely a cheesy movie too . Did you watch it over and over again ? 
 I see that there are Olympic mascots in your car . 
 Me , too . I want to be a volunteer for 2008 Beijing Olympics . 
 No problem . I'm an ' Olympic expert ' . 
 The ancient Olympics originated in ancient Greece . 
 They name it after the place where it was first held . 
 This question is a piece of cake . A Frenchman named Baron de Coubertin . 
 Of course he was called ' the father of the Olympics ' . 
 He once made a speech on the ‘ Renaissance of the Olympics ' . 
 I've told you I'm an expert . 
 Oh , it's too far to walk there.We can take a bus . 
 Yeah , it's a block away down the street . 
 Oh , don ’ t go yet . Let ’ s at least have one more . 
 It ’ s too bad that you have to leave so early . 
 Thanks for coming ! We should meet again sometime soon . 
 Anytime . You can reach me 5558929 . 
 Fine . 
 I hope so , too . Bye ! Ben . 
 Sure , no problem . Asking for leave again ? You have been absent from class five times this semester . 
 I agree that Miss Li doesn't teach so well . Most students either sleep or do other things in her class . 
 Fortunately her class is just an elective course , not as important as compulsory courses . 
 But isn't it too impolite to be absent ? 
 Oh , I thought you just gave an excuse on this note . 
 Yeah , besides , your credit will be deducted . That is kind of serious . 
 You can't write with one hand and draw with the other . 
 You can count on me . 
 How regular ? 
 You are kidding me ? It is against the labor law . They should be aware of their rights . 
 That ’ s not right , somebody should do something . 
 Sorry , we have sold out the tickets . 
 ' Beautiful Mind ' will be playing again . And there's also ' Titanic ' . 
 Yes , 20 yuan for each . 
 OK . Here you are . 
 A teacher . 
 I wouldn't like to be a singer , but I'd like to become a music teacher to teach children to sing , That dream developed in my mind when I was a child . 
 I'm quite sure . I've always loved working with children . 
 He has no sense . 
 But Joe won't you . 
 Excuse me , what did you say ? 
 That's incredible . I can't believe it . 
 How amazing ! 
 But many roads are very narrow . 
 Yes , because of fewer people . 
 Steven ! What ’ s going on ! Who were those guys ? I didn ’ t know you have a gun ! What ’ s going on ! 
 Steven , I ... 
 What ? Why didn ’ t you tell me before ? What are you doing here ? 
 What does that have to do with those men shooting at us ? Most importantly , why did you lie to me ! 
 I can ’ t believe this ! Why are all these things happening to me ! I can ’ t take it anymore ! Let me out of the car ! 
 Hey , May . How about getting together for a movie tonight ? 
 Well , Let me check the newspaper . What about The Terminal ? 
 Well , birds of a feather flock together . I like her too . She was in a lot of dramas . 
 What's more , she doesn't have scandals . And she likes to take part in the charitable activities . 
 Steven Spielberg . Another superstar . 
 Can you introduce the story of The Terminal briefly ? 
 This is really exciting movie . Lets go to this one . 
 Give him a chance . 
 Thank you ! The same to you . 
 I've been invited over to a friend's . And you ? 
 What musical instrument do you play ? 
 Then we can have one more program at our party ? 
 Just make yourself at home . 
 Wouldn't you like some more chicken ? 
 Oh you look awful ! What ’ s the matter ? 
 Oh dear . Maybe you ’ Ve caught a cold . 
 Well then , you should get some rest this weekend and don ’ t go out drinking . 
 Hi , Fanny . 
 Are you feeling OK ? You sound a little tired this morning . 
 What happened ? 
 Oh , what a nightmare ! Then what happened ? 
 You have got a great mother . 
 That sounds good ! 
 Me too . But I tell myself that if they don ’ t accept me , another school will . 
 No , I'm full . My stomach isn't growling at me any more . 
 I'm all set . Thank you for the dinner , Jack . 
 Hey , Maris , are you a part-timer ? 
 Oh , it ’ s pretty popular among my classmates these days . So are you ? 
 Cool ! It must be amazing to work at a bar ! 
 That ’ s true . I ’ m wondering did you learn anything from the job ? 
 You mean you got working experience , right ? 
 It must be very demanding . 
 Really ? It sounds interesting . 
 Great . I ’ m looking forward to it . 
 What ? Why do we have to do that ? 
 I see . That ’ s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock ! 
 That ’ s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ’ s like we went back in time ! 
 What ? 
 Does your girl friend like swimming ? 
 Then you can help her with the breaststroke and sidestroke . 
 Really ? Then just ask her to follow me . 
 Yes . But I still have some difficulties it breathing . 
 To tell you the truth , I have never thought of being a swimmer . I swim just for fun . 
 He was once a poor man but now he is a man of means . 
 He didn't make any effort . His aunt died and left him a fortune . 
 I think it's a great idea . Studying abroad will offer you plenty of new opportunities . Are you planning on going abroad ? 
 which country do you want to go to ? 
 have you applied to any schools there ? 
 congratulations ! That's excellent news ? What do you have to do to get an unconditional offer ? 
 if you study hard , I don't see why you wouldn't . Have you received any other offers ? 
 if you're worried about money , the cost of living is lowest in America . However , if you go to Oxford University , you'll probably be able to get any job you want in the future . 
 if I were you , I'd apply for some scholarships and grants before you decide . Whatever you do , I know you'll succeed . 
 Thank you , but I am in a terrible mood indeed . 
 I enjoy camping . 
 I love the fresh air , the scenery the exercise , and the time to think . 
 Yes , both . Last trip I fished a little and hiked five miles . 
 Yes , but I threw them back . 
 Great ! I can't wait . 
 Yeah , it helps keep me fit and helps the environment , too . 
 Right . Since my work is near a park , it ’ s a really nice ride , too . 
 Oh , about 10 miles . It takes me about an hour . 
 You ’ re doing your part for the environment by using public transportation , too . 
 See you . 
 No , what ? 
 You're kidding ! 
 I wonder if I could possibly borrow two bikes from the shop tomorrow ? I ’ ll take actual care of them . I promise you . 
 Oh , that ’ s all right . It ’ s very kind of you . Can I come around now ? 
 Yeah . You don't need to rub it in . 
 Fifteen ? And Zina pushed them up to seventy-five ? 
 Anyway , I'm still happy I left . I'm working as a freelancer now . 
 I feel I work harder when I am under pressure . 
 You spoken English is pretty good . Please tell me your experience in learning English . 
 What's your method of learning ? 
 What if there is no chance ? I mean what if you don't have a partner , what will you do ? 
 That's a good idea . You are really creative . 
 Sorry , I really can't do that . There's little time left for us . 
 Yeah . But I have an appointment with Ann . 
 Hello , Tom ! 
 How are you doing ? 
 I'm just a little tired . 
 I have a lot of work to do in the company recently . 
 Pretty fine , thanks . 
 I am going to buy a new air conditioner for my parents . Oh , it ’ s two o ’ clock . I must go now . 
 See you . 
 Hi , Mary . Lily wanted me to buy her some things for the party . 
 It ’ s pretty bad . 
 I am glad I did not drive a car . 
 I like spring . 
 Oh , everything comes back to life in spring and the weather gets warmer . 
 Bill , how can you hear so happy today ? 
 Really ? What was the matter ? 
 Brain Locker ? No , I don't think so . What does he look like ? 
 Mm . I've seen him a couple of times , I think . 
 Good . Thanks for asking . 
 I need help with something . 
 I am looking for a newspaper article . 
 I didn ’ t even think about that . 
 That would be a lot of help . 
 Thank you so much . 
 Some routine job . Files , documents , faxes and so on . 
 It depends . Sometimes I am very busy . 
 Oh , that means I can't make sure for my own . 
 Thanks for inviting me to your friend ’ s wedding . I was surprised to hear the bride and groom talking to each other that way during the marriage ceremony . Is that common ? 
 Your tradition of throwing rice as they got into their car was interesting , but it didn't look like real rice to me . 
 Oh , I didn't think of that . Well , this reception reminds me of weddingparties back in China . Plenty of food and drink , music and dancing , and interesting traditions . 
 She ’ s got quite a crowd around her . Oh , look ! That little girl caught it ! 
 You look run down , Brian . 
 Well , you wanna take a sick leave ? All you need now is a good , long rest . 
 Good idea . 
 Sarah and I could see eye to eye with each other . 
 No , I encourage her to go her own way , but she's now having a change of heart . 
 Sure . You see all these little drawers here and all the way around the walls ? 
 These drawers contain cards describing every book in our library . Together they constitute the library's " card catalog " . You can see that each drawer runs from one part of the alphabet to another . Fox example , this drawer goes from SCA to SCM . 
 No . You'd look under ' W ' . The articles ' a ' and ' the ' don't count in our alphabetization , and cards are generally omitted for extremely common words and phrases such as ' history of ' , ' introduction to ' , ' story of ' and so forth . 
 Well , you can look under the author's name . 
 Suppose you want to find a book by your professor , William Smith . You'd look under SMITH and then WILLIAM . Since that's very common name , you may have to go through several ' William Smith ' until you come to the one who wrote book on the subject you are interested in . 
 What's up ? 
 Are you asking me for a date ? 
 I don ’ t like to go to the movies on a date . It's noisy there . 
 Let's go to the coffee shop then . It's quiet there . 
 How about seven ? 
 Hello , Catherine . Would you like to go out tomorrow ? 
 Yeah , I was thinking we could get a bite to eat and catch a movie . 
 Yes . We can do something else if you like . 
 Well . What time would you like me to pick you up ? 
 Good . I will see you then . 
 Bye . 
 It ’ s as plain as the nose on your face . They ’ re dating each other . 
 Well , you can bet this relationship ’ s going to be a flash in the pan . 
 I think you are absolutely right . Actually , my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . They got married a month later . 
 No way . I want the satisfaction of squishing this bug myself . Plus , what if it's Vince ? 
 He's just a distraction , like a mosquito buzzing in my ear . I want no distractions . 
 You didn't ring me last night . You said you would . 
 That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch . 
 And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ? 
 Hi , how is it going ? 
 That ’ s right . I ’ Ve never really liked it since I got here . 
 Would you like to go skiing with me ? I heard the new ski area is great . They have safe tracks , especially for the beginners and provide free training . I think it suits you best . 
 Then you can go to the three-day-long training camp first . There ’ re some professional teachers and they can guide you to do certain necessary exercise . 
 Come on ! It is really a fun game . 
 It's my new pendant . Do you like it ? 
 Yes , in a monkey suit . It's adorable ! 
 Yeah . Two-toned , white and yellow . 
 why ? 
 Oh , yes ! I completely forgot about it . 
 no , but now he'll be in trouble . What's a boyfriend for ? To forget about Valentine's Day ? 
 you know , it's OK for a girl to forget these " big days " , but for a guy , to do that is unforgivable . 
 oh , it's Jack . Excuse me . 
 he asked me out to a dinner tonight . How about joining us ? 
 so what ? 
 We ’ re going to the Dragon Boat Festival tomorrow . Feel like coming along ? 
 Really ? I think you ’ ll love it . 
 I must admit I'm not at all interested in math . 
 But I don't think I'll ever show my liking to math . 
 Can ’ t be better ! Bob , aren ’ t you glad the semester is over ? 
 I didn ’ t think much of it . Are you ? 
 Sounds like fun . 
 Are you broke again ? Let me treat you . 
 You know , I am a waitress at the student center . Anyway now those final exams are almost over . I ’ d love a night out . 
 can't bear it , right ? I've been there before . I'll feel comfortable if no one calls me or sends me text messages , like there is something missing . 
 actually , this is a kind of addiction called " infomania " or " information overload " . 
 yes , it is . Do you consider a frequent check of your income emails to be an integral part of your working day ? 
 do you have your cell phone with you wherever you go and check text messages and phone calls from time to time ? 
 do you open all your IM tools whenever you're using a computer ? 
 now I can tell you're definitely addicted to the overflow of information . 
 I ’ Ve been playing computer games . 
 It ’ s called Counter Strike.It ’ s a first person shooter game.It ’ s awesome.It ’ s a multi player game where you can go online and compete against players from all over the world . 
 My laptop is on my bed . If you think it ’ s so easy then get on line and try to beat me . 
 Damp it ! How are you killing me with a single shot ? It ’ s not fair ! I don ’ t want to play anymore ! Let ’ s go get something to eat . 
 Why did Tom quit his job ? 
 If he doesn't change his attitude toward work , I don't think a new job can make any difference . 
 He said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man . 
 Nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question , you know . 
 Hmm ... you look too dressed up . How about this purple top and these jeans ? 
 Be confident . Wear styles you ’ re going to be comfortable in . 
 I know . But my life seems super stressful . I really don ’ t know how to get a better grab on things . 
 Here ’ s a letter for you . 
 Who ’ s the letter from ? 
 Read it ! 
 Really ? 
 I ’ m so happy for you ! 
 I am really proud of you . 
 Do you think the weather will be good this weekend ? 
 Oh . That ’ s a pity . I thought that we might go hiking in the hills . 
 Yes that might be a better idea . 
 Ok - let ’ s do that then ! 
 Yes , it's to my liking , too . 
 It's my dream . 
 I use it almost every day , but I usually only use it to check my email . I don ’ t often surf the net . You use the internet a lot , don ’ t you ? 
 So , you ’ re online eight hours a day . 
 How useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ? 
 How do you solve the website problems when you ’ re buying something online ? 
 Today more and more families have personal computers . People have wider range of choice to communicate with the outside world . 
 One of the common uses of PC is that people can buy goods through it without going out to the physical stores . 
 If a customer is interested in some certain goods , he can ask the web company to have the specimen of the goods shown on the color screen , and then the customer can place an order online to the sales company . And then the goods you want will be delivered to your home . The service is perfect and the delivery is free of charge . 
 Hi , Bob ! How are you doing ? 
 I'm fine too , thank you . 
 With the greatest pleasure.Where is the concert this evening ? 
 What's on the program ? 
 What a good day ! 
 Right . Let's go out and enjoy the beautiful natural scenery . 
 Wow , what a beautiful lake ! The green hills and clear water really provide magnificent scenery . 
 I feel as if I'm living in a different world , honey . 
 I think we should go out more frequently . The natural scenery can do us good . 
 Right . The city life has made us tired and out of energy , while the natural world can bring us quite new feelings . 
 If you are really in love with your wife , you should be in support of her . You can ’ t have it both ways , of course . 
 Yeah . Love me , and love my dog . 
 What for ? 
 thanks ; do you like it ? 
 yes , everyone on the sales floor has to wear one . They're supposed to make us look more professional . 
 I don't mind it , actually . I don't have to worry about what I'm going to wear every day . 
 it's much better than my old one . My new boss is great . 
 I like the fact that I get to work with people . It makes the day go by much faster . 
 yeah , I've met her . She's a genius saleswoman ! 
 how do you know her ? 
 why didn't you tell me about that before ? 
 well , now that I know that , maybe we should all go out for dinner sometime . 
 Isn ’ t this great ? I always wanted to own a farm , live out in the country , grow my own food ! 
 That ’ s fine ! Don ’ t worry about it ! 
 Relax , it was just a goat ! 
 It ’ s just the cows that are grazing over there . We can milk them later . 
 Honey , seriously , It ’ s just a sheep . Relax ! 
 You know what ? I don ’ t think I can hack it here out in the countryside . I ’ m going back to the city ! 
 All of your coursework is important , including everything from attendance and homework to all of your test results for the semester . 
 All of it is important ; please just do your best at all times . 
 The final and mid-term are twenty percent each ; homework , attendance , and quizzes are the rest . 
 Make sure you contact me as I only allow one unexcused absence . 
 Your grade will not be a surprise ; you will know what you need to work on . 
 Really ? Tell me about some of the plants they showed . 
 Is that type of plant found in this country ? 
 So would i . what other unusual plants did they show ? 
 That ’ s very specialized . So , the insects and the flowers rely on each other . If one became extinct , the other would too . 
 I see . The plants that fascinate me most are cacti . I find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions . 
 That ’ s why they often have long roots to find water spines instead of leaves , to reduce water loss . 
 That's great ! Congratulations . 
 Oh , it's my pleasure . After all , you are very qualified for the position . 
 Don't mention it.You ' re always been good.What do you say we go out to celebrate ? 
 The Great Wall is a great attraction for visitors . 
 Someone claimed it was one of the two man-made wonders that could be seen on the moon . 
 I can ’ t believe it ! 
 Yes , but I bet $ 200 dollars on the Cougars ! 
 I can ’ t believe it ! I thought the Cougars were going to win for sure . 
 20 to 1 , in favour of the Cougars ! 
 Hey , let's go out and grab a couple of beers tonight ! 
 Nigel , you sure lead a dog's life , what's up with that ? 
 What do you think of your teacher ? 
 And I hear he gives very good lectures . 
 Ernie , I'm really excited about starting this band together . We're going to be the two coolest students on campus . 
 That's a good question . You know I love hip hop , so maybe we can play some Vanilla Ice songs . 
 That's OK . You can buy his songs on iTunes and listen to them . 
 Don't worry . I'm almost finished . 
 All right . I'm finished . 
 What do you mean by that ? 
 What don't you like about it ? 
 I'm sorry that you don't like it . 
 I'm sure we can work something out . 
 You don ’ t love me , Roy . 
 No , you used to be . But not now . You are in love with someone else . You are in love with my friend , Janet . You appreciate her very much . You think she is beautiful and fun to be with and you think I ’ m dumb and uninteresting . 
 I envy her and also I hate her at the same time . 
 Oh , shut up , Roy . 
 Oh , SHUT UP ! 
 I like current affairs programmes and documentaries , especially wildlife ones . How about you ? 
 I agree . People often criticize tv for showing too much sex and violence . 
 right . You can ’ t blame the tv stations for showing popular kinds of programmes . They need to make money from advertisements shown during and between programmes . 
 that ’ s great idea . But don ’ t the tv station lose a lot of money because of that ? 
 not as far as I know . We have so many advertisements . the interruptions are unbearable sometimes ! That ’ s one reason that many people prefer satellite or cable tv , where you pay a fixed amount each mo 
 well , there ’ s a wildlife documentary on tv in a few minutes . Shall we ? 
 Goodbye . 
 Sure . 
 I will . 
 I see . And I'll always be devoted to you . 
 I'll never hurt you ; I'll never lie . 
 It can't be dry , and can't die . 
 Aha , Aha ... 
 Hi , John , I am trying to find a carpenter . 
 Well , I want to build a deck in my back yard . 
 So I can have a special place to hang out with friends , and also do some barbecuing on weekends . 
 You ? Do you have a carpenter's license ? 
 Wow ! That's cool . So , let me give you some details about the deck I want . 
 I'd like my deck to be at the same level as the back door . 
 Yes , the back door is about four or five steps higher than the ground . 
 I don't like things to be fancy . 
 Hmm , that's good . Can you use cedar or redwood to build it ? 
 Well , let's take the measurements right now . 
 Not really . 
 Don't mention it . 
 Good night ! 
 I wouldn't do it if I were you . 
 It's very dangerous , you know . 
 It's an easy way to get hurt , let me tell you . 
 Well , take care of yourself , and don't say I didn't warn you . 
 What is it ? 
 There must be something wrong with her . 
 Well , I think Clinton deserves high marks for doing his job generally , but he may get low marks for his honesty and personal image . 
 I don't find this surprising . The poll data sound quite right . He is a good president . 
 What courses are you taking ? 
 What do you think about the teachers ? 
 That's too bad . Do you have any foreign teachers ? 
 What is he like ? 
 Are you able to follow him ? 
 Oh , that's good ! He sounds like a good teacher . 
 How do I apply to an American university ? 
 I was told that it took a lot of time and effort to apply . 
 What's to come next ? 
 How long will it take to go over all the procedures ? 
 Thank you . I appreciate your help . 
 Good morning . I ’ m from the new york book review . Could I ask you some question about your latest book ? 
 First , I ’ Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story . 
 How do you research your books ? 
 I really like your books . I ’ Ve just finished this one . I read it from cover to cover in a single day . Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again ! 
 Oh ! Thank you very much . I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories . What are the stories about ? 
 Thanks very much . I ’ m sure it will sell well . I can ’ t wait to read it . Here ’ s my card . Thank you for you time . 
 What's her last name ? 
 What color are her eyes ? 
 What color is her hair ? 
 How old is she ? 
 I like watching comedies , like ' Boat ' . Do you like watching comedies too ? 
 You like horror movies ? I don't like them because they're too scary ! I like comedies because I love to laugh . 
 Good morning . Is this where I can get a library card issued to me ? 
 I'm done . 
 Sure , here it is . 
 I am pretty sure how to use it , but can you remind me ? 
 I see . 
 When did you and Amanda meet each other ? 
 So you met her right after you got to school ? 
 Do you like snakes ? 
 I mean , do you like snake meat ? 
 What do you do in your spare time ? 
 That sounds interesting . 
 Do you have any hobbies ? 
 What kind of things do you paint ? 
 What kinds of sports do you like ? 
 Hi , Mary , it ’ s been a long time . 
 Well , I ’ m doing okay . And how about yourself ? 
 Oh . I ’ m sorry to hear that . What happened ? 
 I need to check out this book . 
 I don ’ t have one . 
 That ’ s fine . 
 All right . All done . 
 Okay . I ’ Ve signed it . 
 Great . Now can I check out this book ? 
 Well , pretty good . 
 Well , the cultural differences impressed me most . 
 That's right , quite different . One day one of my American friend looked pale , so I asked him whether he was sick or not . But he was reluctant to answer my question . 
 And what's more , when he told me he had caught a cold for several days , I suggested him to go to the hospital as soon as possible . 
 Sure I am . But he responded by saying'what do you mean ? ' . 
 I felt the same at first . Later he told me that I'd better not give him any suggestions when he was sick . Offering unsolicited help or advice is like showing sympathy to the weak or the poor . But back in China , helping others is always regarded being kind . 
 He has so many friends supporting him . 
 But he has to stick to it and to it long enough . 
 That's pretty advanced . 
 Is that where you park ? 
 Thank you . Where is your key ? 
 That's amazing , it even shows all the roads that are congested at the moment . 
 Pretty soon cars will be driving themselves . 
 Here it is , and here we are . 
 I have to get home , but I don't need all of this fancy technology , I think I'll just walk . 
 Yeah , I ’ m going for a hike in the southern Rocky Mountains . 
 I go as much as I can . I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature . 
 Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ? 
 Wow ! You must have been pretty far away from the city . 
 Well , bring him along too . We ’ ll have a great time this weekend . 
 Miss Wang , would you mind my asking you a personal question ? 
 Are you married ? 
 Frankly yes . We like to employ married people . By the way , do you have any children ? 
 Hello . 
 What's up ? 
 I don't know . 
 No , Lucy . Don't get me wrong . I mean school will be open on Sept . 2nd , and I will have a very tight schedule by then . 
 That will be fine . When can I see him ? 
 Make sure you come here before noon . I will be picking up my friend at the airport in the afternoon . 
 By bus , of course . 
 Great . By the way , what does your friend do ? 
 Ok , see you then . 
 He ’ s got laid off again . I do feel sorry for him . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Could you tell me something about the Mid-Autumn Festival ? I find it also very interesting . 
 So , I understand why people eat moon cakes on that day . 
 Is it official ? 
 Good morning , Miss . 
 Yes , I'd like to know how to use the library . You know , I'm a new student here . 
 Yes.Here ' s my identification . 
 Thank you very much . By the way , how many books am I allowed to check out ? 
 How long can I keep the books ? 
 I want a book on physics . Could you show me where I can find it ? 
 I think this one will do . 
 Why ? What's wrong with it ? 
 Have you heard that we will have reorganization ? 
 Yes , flexible , aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department . 
 James is going to be packed off there . 
 Mrs . Smith , you are always worried about your children . 
 That ’ s human nature . 
 Thank you , Paul . 
 Yes Anthony , come on in . Have a seat . 
 Well , Anthony , this is not going to be an easy conversation.The company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment . 
 I don ’ t want to beat around the bush so I ’ m just gonna come out with it . We are going to have to let you go . 
 I ’ m sorry but , to be honest , you are a terrible employee ! 
 Anthony , you were caught making international calls from the office phone , you called in sick in eight times this month and you smell like alcohol ! 
 No , have they have another fight ? 
 You must be joking . Those two ? 
 So when did all this happen ? 
 Well , I believe it now , and when are they are getting married ? 
 I can hardly believe it . 
 Good idea . There is a good nightclub nearby , isn't it ? 
 ( In the club ) Look at those people in the dance floor , they are so crazy . 
 I like the slow dance . I am good at rumba and waltz . 
 Let's find a quiet seat and sit down for beverage . 
 Listen , it is waltz . I like the elegant step of the old styles . 
 Sure . 
 Tom , you promised to cut the lung . You won't forget , will you ? 
 And you'll repair the television , won't you ? 
 Do you promise ? 
 And Tom , you will help Johnny with his homework , won't you ? 
 But you'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight , won't you ? 
 Tom , darling . You'll try not to be late for dinner tonight , won't you ? Please ! 
 How did Jim get the money ? 
 He must be mad ! Nick is a loan shark . 
 Too much , Harry . Don't blame her anymore . 
 I know . But there's no point in making her feel worse , isn't there ? 
 My goodness ! You ’ re kidding ! 
 That ’ s amazing ! You got a good pay here , didn ’ t you ? 
 Come on ! Don ’ t be silly ! 
 Well . How do you know ? 
 Birds of feather flock together . You must be one of these men . 
 That ’ s enough for you to worship the ground she treats on . 
 It was me . I am so sorry . 
 I had to move it , so that I can get my bike through . 
 I am awfully sorry . I didn't think you would mind so much . 
 I promise . 
 Who ? 
 Yeah , she is so charming . I like her , too . 
 What's the movie about ? 
 Isn't it silly to see a movie that you know nothing about ? 
 Yeah , she is great . I also admire her for her concern about society . 
 I wouldn't count on it . 
 Yes , but I'll bet she won't again . 
 Sure . All you need is your student ID card or admission card to check out books and read journals or magazines in the library . 
 Two books at a time . Except magazines or journals , they have to be read within library . 
 For one month . If you can ’ t return the books in time , you'll be fined . But if you renew them , you can keep them longer . 
 Yes , just over there to your right . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 It was a piece of cake . 
 Yeah.It is the very latest in digital video cameras . 
 Getting cheaper is not the only reason for their popularity.They come with a lot of inviting functions . 
 They offer clearer and sharper images . Many of them also have up to 20x optical zoom lenses , a photo mode and fast-action mode . 
 Right ! Anyway , the basic difference between a digital camcorder and its traditional counterpart is that it speaks digital . 
 This means digital camcorders can be connected with the digital equipments you have at home , like your digital TV or your computer . 
 Sure ! And without any conversion process or loss of quality ! You quickly find , cut , and record video segments and create slide shows . Some camcorders even offer editing software for adding titles and special effects . 
 Like creating a sepia tone look and some special effects such as fades and dissolves . 
 With the development of the broad band Internet , you can easily upload your video files to websites or e-mail them to relatives or business partners . 
 Hi , David ! What are you doing ? 
 Actually , I'm not good at tennis at all ... 
 Oh , come on . That's no reason to do something you're not interested in . 
 How about the Classical Music Club ? 
 Hey-how about the Cinema Club ? 
 Either we'll be millionaires , or we won't ... won't have a dime . 
 The only person who seems confident the software will be done on time is Zina . 
 Failure just isn't an option for her . I'm glad she's on our team . 
 Actually , I had a perfect plan for this afternoon , but it is totally ruined by the sand storm . I woke up this morning and found it was sunny . So I called Lucy and asked her to go shopping with me . We were going to look for a new purse . Now it turned out to be like this . Neither of us wants to go to outside anymore . 
 What ’ s wrong with climate ? Anyway , I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before . Can ’ t people do something to stop it ? 
 My new plan is to wait for the end of the sand storm and clean my apartment . 
 I would like to return this book . 
 I would also like to check out this magazine . 
 Why is that ? 
 What things am I allowed to check out ? 
 I really need to check out this magazine . 
 That ’ s stupid . 
 What ? Are you sure about that ? 
 Where is he going ? 
 What a pity ! 
 I know that . But it's pity for us to lose such a good neighbour . You know I always appreciate Tom's company . 
 Have a nice Thanksgiving ! 
 Are you going anywhere ? 
 Oh , I'll probably just stay at home . 
 You mean the one with the yellow bricks ? But last time I saw it , it wasn ’ t really in business yet . I saw some people inside furnishing the rooms . Is it open now ? 
 Great , I like the idea of trying some new food . 
 Also some traditional Chinese food , like noodles and dumpling are marketed in modern ways with improved food quality . I heard this year , the government has imposed very stringent inspection on the hi-gene conditions restaurants and suppliers of food are also under tighter control . For sure all the customers will benefit from this . 
 Yeah . What's going on ? 
 Yeah . It's been a couple of months since I saw you . 
 I just started working out . 
 I joined the Samsung Health Club last month . 
 I concentrate mostly on my legs , chest , arms and stomach . 
 It's hard work while exercising , but it is a great feeling when I get done . 
 Exercising at home is hard . The environment is not suited for exercising . 
 I have a couple of guest passes . You want to check out my health club ? 
 Great . I'll call you Saturday morning . 
 Ok . Bye . 
 We have a beautiful natural park . 
 Come on.Let ' s walk there . 
 I ’ m worried about my daughter . She can ’ t decide about college . 
 I don ’ t mind that . But she disagrees with me about everything . 
 But I just want to give her some tips . 
 Merry Christmas , Lily . 
 This is your first Christmas in the US . Here is the gift for you . 
 Ok . People decorate their houses , place a Christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a Christmas carol together . 
 You're right . Let's ask her to give us one more week . 
 Oh ! Good evening . I'm sorry , but she is not in . She's gone out to the theatre 
 Please come in 
 I was preparing my supper but I've finished now . 
 Oh ! yes 
 What ? 
 Mr . Rogers probably forgot to assign a locker to you . 
 Remind him to give you a locker tomorrow . 
 No . You have to buy your own . You'll have to go to a hardware store to pick one up . 
 I tried . You were preoccupied . 
 You got drunk , and you were hilarious . Lighten up . 
 So now you can say you had a mafia experience . Ha-ha . 
 Are you kidding ? Don had fun scaring you . He'd probably buy you dinner if we go back . 
 That's my grand-father . He was a farmer . When he was young , he had to take the water buffalo to graze in the field . 
 My grandfather did that too . He used the time to study instead . 
 My grand grandfather was a merchant who ran a small business . He couldn't afford to send my grand father to school . 
 Right . Later he was a soldier and a fireman in the village . When he was middle aged , he became a great man , quite famous . 
 As a leader of police officers in charge of the whole country . 
 No . He retired from that . He is a senator now . 
 Well , maybe when I get old . But first I'll be a lawyer . 
 Why are you considering trying for it ? 
 What is it about this job that appeals to you ? 
 Yes , you could be right . There is a lot to consider . 
 Would a slight decrease in pay be worth it for a new opportunity for growth ? 
 I think you should give it a shot . What do you have to lose ? You can always change your mind . 
 Great minds think alike . 
 Oh , no ! Why ? I was looking forward to seeing you at my new place . 
 No problem.Call me when you get back . 
 That's good for me , but do you think you'll be back by then ? I'd really like to see you . 
 Great ! That's settled then . 
 Look at this , A Brief Introduction of Hollywood . 
 What ? How much do you know Hollywood ? 
 You are full of boasts . I can examine you by question and answer . What is Hollywood ? Where is it ? What is the function of it ? 
 Not bad . What kind of film did it produce from the ready to mid 1930 ' s 
 Mm . What came after that ? 
 Pretty good . Please continue . 
 The western films about America's cowboys , Indians and early settlers . 
 Since the early 1960 ' s , there are horror movies about people who encounter frightening , unnatural situations , and serious films such as documentarist about events that actually happened , and science fiction movies about possible friture and future worlds . Some people have also enjoyed watching psycho-dramas about the everyday problems that people have . 
 Of course , no list of film would be complete without animated movies . These are especially popular among children . 
 Oh ! I forgot all about it . Of course you can have it back , John . I'm sorry about the delay . 
 Excuse me . May I use the phone first ? 
 You bet . I was supposed to call my mother an hour ago . 
 Oh , it's getting late . I've got to run.It was nice talking to you , karren . 
 I guess we'll see just around . 
 You too . 
 Are you kidding ? I ’ m terrible ! But I love to watch sports . I go to football or baseball games a lot . And I read sports magazines every week . 
 Do you like sports , Janice ? 
 Oh , I see . You know , we spend time doing different sports . How much time do you spend exercising ? 
 That ’ s great ! I ’ Ve heard people say that before . 
 Oh , I ’ m too lazy to play sports , and I ’ m not good at anything either . It hardly excites me . 
 I know . He doesn ’ t like to ask anyone for help . My dad insists on paying his own bills and taking care of himself ! 
 It seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own . 
 Sometimes they are too independent . 
 What do you do with it ? 
 Okay . 
 OK . 
 Hey ! 
 Got it . 
 No , nobody . 
 Well , to be frank , yes , I do . 
 Actually it is . Perhaps you haven ’ t noticed the sign . 
 There , on the window . 
 That ’ s all right . 
 No , not usually . Most people are married in a church , and then the wedding party and guests go to another place for the reception . Sometimes , however , they hold the reception in a big room in the church . 
 Either they go to a public place such as a hotel , a restaurant , or a club , or to the home of the brid 
 Why do you ask ? 
 Oh ! In our country the bride's family is responsible for the entire wedding-arrangement , costs , etc . So the reception is held at her home . 
 Many American furthers joke that they would rather hold the ladder for their daughter to climb down and elope than pay for a wedding . 
 Yes . When the bride and groom are ready to leave on their honeymoon all the single girls gather in one place . The bride stands with her back to them and throws her bouquet over her shoulder and they each try to catch it . The one who does will be the next one married . 
 Guess what I just heard ? 
 The boss is planning to sell the company . 
 And the cover is great ! The colors are brilliant ! 
 OK , you got me . So , do you have a subscription ? 
 So what do you do with all the out-dated issues ? 
 I've moved . 
 We're going out to dinner and then to the movies . 
 Don't worry . I've got money . It's my treat . 
 Hi , Kenji . 
 I'm OK . How are you doing ? 
 Do you mean The Bangkok ? 
 Sure , I'd love to . 
 Any time after 6 o'clock is good for me.Oh ! I'm late ! I have a class . 
 Great . Talk to you then . 
 Yes , I think we might be free . What did you have in mind ? 
 That sounds great . Is it casual ? 
 That sounds good . It will give my wife a chance to dress up . 
 That sounds wonderful . Will there be anyone there that I know ? 
 Great ! I'll look forward to it . We'll make sure and check the mail for our invitation . 
 I don ’ t know . But he must be a big shot . 
 Because everyone is trying to butter him up . 
 The cat has eaten my fish , I'll kill it . 
 I'll beat him . 
 Did you go to see Michael last night ? 
 Did he let you ride it ? 
 Weren ’ t you frightened ? 
 Would you like to buy a motorcycle yourself ? 
 But why ? Since you like it so much . 
 I passed history test . 
 And then you ’ re old man won ’ t be beaten this time . 
 Mr.Ben , What do you think of the book ? 
 Why ? 
 I agree with you . 
 Do you have your book list for your class ? 
 Fine . Once you have it , you can go to the bookstore . Do you know where that is ? 
 OK , so once you pass the gym , it's the first door on your left . Do you know you can also sell your used textbooks there ? 
 You just take them with you and trade them with the used textbook man just outside the door . Do you think you will be going there today ? 
 Well , if you decide to go , I could meet you over there at 1 
 Well , then , I'll talk to you later . Have a good day ! 
 Sorry to trouble you . But I don't think this fish is fresh . It actually tastes a bit off . 
 No , please don't do that . I'd just like to return it . 
 Ok , then please bring me the steak mediun-rare , thank you . 
 Bill . Bill ! You gotta help me ! 
 Tomorrow is Christmas and I haven ’ t bought my mom anything ! I ’ m such a bad son ! 
 That ’ s just it ! I don ’ t know what to get her ! Last year I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small ! I suck at getting presents for people . 
 Yeah , you ’ re right . When it comes down to it , I can be pretty tacky . 
 Now that ’ s a great idea ! 
 Yes . I do one set of shadow-boxing every morning after I get up . 
 Definitely . It not only keeps me fit but also helps me concentrate on my soul . 
 Yes , he once gave her seven roses . 
 No way to know . 
 How about Great Canyon ? 
 Of course ! It's the most wonderful natural works . 
 Are they coming to Chicago again ? 
 Oh , good ! We can all get together again . 
 And Margaret and I can take the dog and go jogging in the park . 
 Oh , yes . We all sat on the grass , and Margaret played the guitar and sang Greek songs . 
 Did you punch in ? 
 Really ? It took me really a while to find the color . I am happy you like it . 
 Sure , when those never ending meetings . 
 How old is he ? 
 John seems to be in high cotton . He may well become a big shot . 
 What is your idea ? 
 Hey . Owen ! Have you gone on your family vacation yet ? 
 Didn't you bring his favorite toy ? 
 Where did you go ? You've got a beautiful tan . 
 You must have had a great time . Most children love to play in the sand on the beach and go swimming . 
 His friends will be very happy to get the little souvenir . 
 This is going to surprise you , but I'm happy . I think you're making the right move . 
 Look , maybe I shouldn't tell you this , but I'v going over to WebTracker , too . 
 Actually , I'm already working for WebTracker . Vince never wanted to give me what I was worth , so I figured , what the heck . 
 It's kind of cool , isn't it ? I'm sort of like a secret agent . 
 Well , most of the time it is , I guess . 
 I think money will make me happy . 
 It will for me . Then I can do all the things I want to do . 
 Then I can find something new to do . If I don't have to worry about money , then I don't have to work . 
 You see ... money doesn't equal happiness , but it takes away a lot of responsibilities . 
 Sure , I have . Will you join ? 
 You are right . Our company ’ s Christmas party has always been an amazing occasion for everybody to relax and get to know each other better . It is also a time to make new friends and do some networking . 
 No , it will not be formal at all . It is a fun time . You will love the game show . Please dress casually . Usually there is an over abandon of drinks , so be careful with that . 
 My father ’ s angry face always makes my blood run cold . 
 Not often . Just when I make mistakes . 
 We have been on good terms . She is a very nice girl . But she got in Dutch with her boss . I don ’ t have the heart to see her pounding the pavements . 
 Well , we hit it off with each other . Nothing more , nothing much . 
 It it true of many countries . 
 Sure . If people are near in blood , they might pass on some genetic disease to the next generation . 
 Hi , An . How are you ? 
 I am afraid I can ’ t this afternoon . I take my daughter to her tennis class at the club on Wednesday afternoons . 
 Ok , I'll meet you at the club at two thirty . 
 Yes , why ? 
 So ? 
 That sounds great . But how do you know that's a crush or a real love ? 
 That's a big question . Well , if you're in love , maybe you will take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all . 
 And you think about her all the time ? 
 And maybe you suddenly have new interests . I mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid . For instance , you used to sleep in every morning , but because she jogs every morning then you begin to like jogging . 
 Oh , congratulations . Sounds like you've found your soul mate . 
 Yes , that's right . If you find this person becomes more and more important to you and you can totally trust her , then you can stay in love . 
 What book is that ? 
 Canada , China , and the USA are huge too . 
 Those small countries are microscopic compared to Russia . European countries are relatively small . France looks quite big in Europe , but compared to many countries in other continents , it ’ s not very large at all . 
 The thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . Russia and Canada have enormous areas of ice and forest . 
 Well , that's hard to say because there are so many good ones . I don't think I could pick a favorite . 
 Oh yeah , that's one of my favorite flicks . I think Jim Carry is one of the funniest comedians ever . 
 How about a movie tonight ? 
 Does 7 o'clock suit you ? 
 How about a snack after work ? 
 Would you rather stay home ? 
 Are you really interested in doing something ? 
 I'm going shopping . 
 No . I need to borrow $ 50 . 
 Do you have any siblings ? 
 How do you get along with them ? 
 What do you think of the test ? 
 It wasn't too bad . Were you nervous ? 
 Oh , I wouldn't worry about it . 
 No , I wouldn't worry about you . 
 It seems to me that you always do better than you say . 
 What a great idea ! 
 I like the mountain idea , but I am not so sure about the month of January . 
 April might be nice . It is far enough away to make the necessary arrangements . 
 We could ask everyone what would be the best time for them . 
 I'll put the survey online this afternoon . 
 Silly , you should make sure he does . 
 He ’ s buying me a handbag , and then dinner at a gorgeous restaurant . 
 You ’ ll never guess what ! My friends Julie and Alex are getting married ! 
 I know ! Anyways I just talked to Alex ’ s best man and he is organizing the bachelor party It ’ s gonna be so much fun ! All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we are going to do that night . 
 Aw come on ! It ’ s just some innocent fun ! You know how these things are ! We are gonna play drinking games , get him some gag gifts and just have a good time . Nothing too over the top . 
 Come on ! If one of your friends was getting married I wouldn ’ t mind you going to her bachelorette party ! 
 What ! 
 Oh , it ’ s Death on the Nile . Have you read it ? 
 Sure . I didn ’ t know you like mysteries . 
 Our son is gone and my heart is gone too . I don ’ t know how to spend the rest of my years . 
 I feel life is meaningless without him . 
 Hey , guys ! Did you see that sign ? 
 There's a garage sale around the corner . 
 What ? Cars ? Are you serious ? 
 It's amazing to me how international business has become . Take my store for example . On any given day , you will find imported items from more than 20 different countries on our shelves . 
 China provides the bulk of our product inventory , for sure . We import more than 40 different items from China . Most of the imports that come out of China are low-grade plastics or toys . Japan produces many electronic exports , Germany produces excellent mechanical exports . 
 Generally speaking , food items are difficult to import . Food with the short shelf life is liable to spoil in the time it takes to ship from one place to another . The only food items we import are specialty canned or preserved foods . The shelf life is longer for these products . 
 No idea . We've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights . What else is there to see ? 
 You mean visit a factory ? 
 Good idea ! I've always been interested in that . How much is the entrance fee ? 
 Really ? What do the companies do that for ? 
 Oh , ISEE . So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors . 
 Do we need an appointment beforehand ? 
 Here , Let me get the door for you . 
 Do you need a hand with that ? 
 Don't worry about it . 
 Yes . 
 It'll start on lst September . 
 what a shame ! 
 That's too bad . 
 I am sorry to hear that . 
 What a pity ! 
 Ho , no ! 
 Good evening , Mr . Smith . 
 No . I haven ’ t had the pleasure . 
 How do you do , Mr . Wu ? Welcome . 
 Have a glass of wine , Mr . Wu ? And let me introduce you to some of my guests . 
 How beautiful the detached house is ! 
 It's marvelous ! The lawn looks like a green carpet , and the garden with so many lovely flowers . 
 No wonder it smells fragrant . 
 It's fantastic ! 
 Yep . And it breathes , see ! 
 Yes , it is . Look at the little light ! It blinks off and on . 
 I would look so cool carrying this around ! 
 Are you studying here ? 
 What are you majoring in ? 
 What do you think of the literature course ? 
 Some people are easily flimflammed . 
 They are blind with bucks . Blind people are more easily conned , fo course . 
 Okay , let's begin . Hello , everyone . My name's Karl Roberts , and I'll be your teacher for this class , Intercultural Communication . 
 Uh , to begin with , please take a look at the syllabus in front of you . As you all should know by now , this class meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3:15 to 4:50 . 
 Again , as you see on your course outline , grading is determined by your performance on a midterm and a final test , periodic quizzes , and classroom participation . 
 I heard that Janet has got a new job . She ’ s working for the united investment group . I heard that they pay very well . 
 Now , she ’ ll be able to save up for that holiday in the united states . 
 You ’ re right . By the way , did you hear that Tom inherited some money recently ? 
 They did . He inherited the money from an uncle . I hope he doesn ’ t lose a lot of it in taxed to the government . 
 He said that he would probably invest most of it . He ’ s got a well-paid job , so he doesn ’ t need the money to cover day-to day expenses . He just wants some extra money available for when he retires . 
 Really ? Have you won a fortune in the lottery ? 
 It certainly was ! So , what are you going to do with your windfall ? 
 I know them . They are the two brothers living next door . 
 It's said that the father's will caused the dissension among the two brothers . 
 No , everyone keeps in mind that ' Don't intrude in a family dispute ' . 
 Why ? We just got here . 
 12 
 Yes . 
 But why is it too late ? It's Saturday night.You have nothing to do tomorrow . Why not stay out and drink with us ? 
 Yes , I was . And I like living here.People know how to party here . In Taipei , some people know how to party.But here , everyone does . 
 They're smoking pot . Don't worry about it . 
 Yes , it is . 
 Don't worry about it . It is true that pot is illegal in America.But the laws aren't as strict as in Taiwan.If people are arrested , and they have a little pot in their possession , they don't go to jail . They just have to pay a fine . 
 Yes . 
 I tried it a couple times . But I don't like it . I like alcohol better.Don ' t worry about them , though . If you don't want to smoke pot , you don't have to . 
 That's alright . But you really should have another drink.People will probably start dancing soon . 
 You had two drinks at nine o'clock . C'mon , Ann , you are in an American university now ! You have to learn how to drink . 
 It is . We study hard all week.And then , on the weekend , we party hard . That's the best way to live . 
 Hi , Michael , how's it going ? 
 I heard you got a new roommate . What's he like ? 
 Oh ? What's wrong with his girlfriend ? 
 Well , I guess it might take some time to get used to . 
 Oh come on , it's not that bad . 
 Rough . Maybe you can do the most of the talking . 
 Good luck . 
 I am not cheating . When you pass go , you collect $ 200 , Everyone knows that ! 
 Banker ? 
 Can I have my $ 200 please ? 
 Hello , is that Cathy speaking ? 
 Yes , how are you doing ? 
 Say I've got two tickets for the concert this evening.Would you like to come with me ? 
 Then I ' ll pick you up at six thirty.OK ? 
 See you . 
 It is hard to guess now . Both of the teams chose the excellent players this time . I guess the game will end in a tie . They are equally matched . 
 Which side are you on ? 
 Wow ! AC wins . It is a close shave , you know . 
 What a good goal ! 
 Yeah , so what do you think about the teachers ? 
 I think so too . I don't like him either . Well , who do you like best ? 
 Me , too . She speaks very clearly and doesn't use very complicated words so that it is easy for us to understand her . 
 Yeah , I like her way of teaching . She told us not to cram for exams , and to pay more attention to communicating than memorizing . 
 Actually , our new math teacher is a good person . He just can't find an appropriate way to teach us . 
 I'm sorry . 
 You are so thoughtful . 
 What about the Yellowstone National Park ? 
 Yes . The scenery is so breathtaking . 
 There are thousands of hot springs and fountains . The park is known for them . 
 Yes . The well-known Yellowstone Waterfall is formed when the Yellowstone Lake falls down into the Yellowstone Canyon . 
 You can take No . 2 bus . 
 What is that ? 
 Cool ! 
 What about all these other pieces ? 
 And these two ? They are husband and wife ? 
 Nah ! This is boring ! I ’ m gonna go play Killer Zombies on my PlayStation ! 
 Fine , thanks . 
 Well , Yes . There are something wrong actually . Perhaps you can give me some advice . 
 Well , Last night when I returned from thetheatre I found I lost my wallet . 
 Well , some money of course , a vise , all my identity cards and some photos . 
 Yes , I have already done that and they already look for it . I ’ ll leaving soon and I need my vise and identity cards badly . 
 Yes , quite sure . 
 But that takes too long . 
 Well , it's too bad that we like different kinds of movies . Maybe we're just different kinds of people . 
 What's that ? 
 You mean ... like on a second date ? 
 No way ! That sounds great ! 
 Thanks , Tim . Nice meeting you , too . 
 Yeah , I hope so . Well , take it easy . 
 Jared , I just heard about your father . How is he doing ? 
 I'm so sorry to hear that . But this is a good hospital . I'm sure they will do whatever they can . 
 You must feel really worried right now . But you know your dad is a fighter . 
 Where is she right now ? 
 Hey , I'll go with you . 
 It's really no problem . 
 All right . But these are black and I don ’ t like black shoes . They ’ re dull . 
 Then why are you wearing black shoes ? 
 Hey , thanks , mum . 
 Uh-oh . It'll probably cost a lot to fix it . 
 Tell me about your brother and sister , Sue . 
 Really ? Does she live here in Seattle ? 
 Wow ! ! And what does your brother do ? 
 What an interesting family ! 
 I'm out of work at the moment . 
 I was fired last week . 
 It doesn't matter . 
 After the tour I'll have a rest . And then go to find a new job . 
 Thank you . 
 I have a severe headache now . 
 Would you like to go with me ? I ’ m afraid of the hospital . 
 You're kidding ! 
 I know he really deserves this . 
 Oh I fell over on the way to work . 
 Yes and I broke my phone too so I couldn ’ t call you . 
 It was ! But the worst thing was I tore my best shirt . 
 Hey , David . Would you like some drinks ? 
 Good idea . I like hanging out in bars at night . 
 For killing time and making new friends . 
 Calm down ! My little guy ! You'll get used to that after you come here several times . 
 I'd like a gin and tonic . 
 What happened with that guy at the cafe ? 
 But you ’ re crazy about him . 
 Why don ’ t you run off with him ? What are you waiting for ? 
 Really ? 
 Oh , let me guess . Through the internet ? 
 Hmm . ' You ’ Ve got mail . ' 
 Thanks.Miss Zhang . 
 Really ? I've already opened this one.Say , this is sweet , and it's just what I need to go with my new suit.Thank you ever so much . 
 Sure , do you think you could live out here ? You know , back to nature at all ? 
 That ’ s what I was thinking . I mean can you imagine Friday night instead of going out with your friends you ’ d have to stay in your tree house and talk to birds and squirrels . 
 And where would you get a cup of cappuccino ? 
 Maybe . But I ‘ d rather be spoiled than turn into a crazy guy with a long period to talk to the birds . 
 Come on , Brenda ! Never say die . 
 Oh yes , I ’ Ve been to Britain many times . I go there on business . 
 Usually , I go to London twice a year but sometimes I go three or four times a year . 
 I ’ m afraid I never go for a holiday . It ’ s always business . 
 Have you found a suitable job ? 
 But as to me finding a good job is the most important thing . 
 Mary , would you like to get something to eat with me ? 
 At 10 o'clock . 
 No , at night . 
 OK , how about 1:30 PM ? 
 How about 5:00 PM ? 
 OK , see you then . 
 Have you been to Shanghai before ? 
 That sounds great . Have you been to the top of the Pearl Tower ? 
 So you haven ’ t done much then , in Shanghai ? 
 Are you enjoying your trip to New Orleans ? 
 Would you like to do something tonight ? 
 Let's see . Have you been to a jazz club yet ? 
 OK . What about an evening riverboat tour ? 
 So , what do you want to do ? 
 Oh , OK . I hear there's a terrific show at the Sanger Theater . 
 what sort of music do you like ? 
 so , you're into 80s music then ? 
 I like alternative music . 
 to be honest , no . I'm always in search of new music to listen to . 
 I usually go to see a live band about twice a month . What about you ? 
 there's an open mic night at the pub down the road every Thursday night where my favorite local band usually plays . You should come along next week with me . 
 that's too bad . Maybe another time . 
 I'll let you know . Did you want to watch some TV ? 
 there's a reality TV show about a group of people who are trying to lose weight . 
 I want to try something different today . 
 I want a different hair style . 
 Can you make my hair short ? 
 Make it a few inches long . 
 I've been thinking about this for a while now . 
 I honestly want my hair that short . 
 Would you please tell me something about the agriculture and industry of New Zealand ? 
 I see . 
 OK , I will . 
 Pretty good . I ’ Ve just had my new poems published . 
 Thank you . 
 He is fine . 
 Yes . He ’ s already got the passport and visa . 
 Thank you . He ’ s very lucky indeed . 
 About 3 years , so I came here 2000 . 
 Providence , Rhode Island . do you know it ? 
 Well , not so far from New York . So what about you ? Did you grow up here ? 
 What are you doing ? 
 Come on ! Stop being so vain . You look great ! You are beautiful ! 
 I don ’ t see any wrinkles or sagging skin ! You are stop beings ridiculous . Besides , I think that people who get Boto , have facelifts , or tummy tucks look weird.It doesn ’ t look natural . 
 I think you need to get brain surgery . I honestly don ’ t think you need cosmetic surgery.You look amazing . 
 You don ’ t need plastic surgery to do that . You are fine the way you are and you have guys drooling all over you ! Plus , plastic surgery hurts ! 
 Yeah ! When I got my nose job I was black and blue for a week ! 
 I'm sorry , my watch has stopped . 
 Let's ask someone else . 
 Why not fifty or one-hundred dollars ? 
 I don't know . You have to be smart , but you have to be lucky too.Some games are all luck . With some , you need to be smart . 
 I knew you would say that ! Then you should play the slot machines . 
 So what do you want to play then ? 
 Huh ? You are breaking our rule already ! And we didn't even start to play yet ! 
 Yes , and if I stay with you , we will have to walk back home to New York.Because we will lose all our money and our plane tickets too ! 
 You're kidding ! 
 Goofed off ? Maybe , but I'm not a clock-watcher . I finished doing what I should do and then knock off an hour earlier . 
 I'm sure of what I'm doing . 
 Yes . You've done a good job . But there's one thing . You should narrow down your topic . 
 Well done ! 
 Yeah , I know , but it's too hard to do . 
 Only sometimes when I think about it , I feel very sad . 
 Many people say it's a good story.But I think it's boring ! 
 How good are you at sports , Bill ? 
 Wow ! 
 Oh , yes . I like to exercise . But I don ’ t watch sports or buy sports magazines . I don ’ t have much time to do those things . 
 Well , I guess I exercise about two hours a day . I do aerobics three times a week , and the other days I play badminton with my husband . I always feel good afterward . 
 Well , why don ’ t you try to get some exercise ? It ’ s difficult , but very rewarding . 
 I had broken up with him , how painful I feel . I ’ m going to drown my sorrows . 
 My brother started investing money when he was 16 years old . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 The machine is over there . 
 Yes , you will have to pay to use it . 
 It costs ten cents a copy . 
 You can copy as much as you ’ d like . 
 The instructions for the copier are posted on it . 
 Mom , happy Mother's Day ! A necklace for you . 
 Thank you for your love and care over the years . I love you so much . 
 How about a dinner tonight ? My treat . 
 All right . Let me prepare the supper . 
 Her acting is OK . 
 I'm afraid I know less than you do.Tell me more about her , will you ? 
 It's hot . 
 Let's just hope it doesn't get hotter . 
 Yes , it's beautiful weather we're having . 
 Yes , the sun shines day after day . It's neither too hot nor too cold . 
 I hope it will stay fine tomorrow . I'm going to have a picnic with my family . 
 Yes , I do . But my characters are very bad . 
 Are you Chinese ? 
 How do you like it ? 
 I want to study Mandarin and international relations . 
 They teach regular characters . 
 You just said your English needs work , yes ? 
 Well , I am very serious about learning Chinese.But for me the hard part now is pronunciation.You have the four tones in Chinese . It is very hard . Maybe , if you have time , maybe we could do a language exchange . 
 Yes , why not ? I mean , if you come to this cafe often , maybe we could meet here and practice Chinese and English . 
 Let's see ... My schedule right now is quite busy.But I think I could spend 90 minutes a week in language exchange . 
 First , we could spend 45 minutes working on your English writing.If you want , I could help you edit your papers.Or we could do English conversation . Whatever you want.And then the next 45 minutes you would help me with my Chinese . 
 No . For me right now , the important thing is spoken Chinese . I need practice . So you could tutor me in speaking.We could use my textbook , and you could ask me questions.Then you could correct my mistakes . 
 Well , today is Monday.Actually , for me Monday at this time would be the best . I am free from now until 11 
 So if you want to meet at 10 
 And I will bring my textbook and a tape recorder . I would like to record some things so I can practice on my own . 
 Sure . I'll give you mine too . Then we can call if we have to cancel for some reason . 
 sure . 
 well , you are a very hard-worker . 
 there are trying times for everyone . What do you propose ? 
 that's quite a bit . If I give you a raise , I'm going to have to give everyone a raise . 
 that sounds reasonable . How about this , from now on , you can be responsible for scheduling . That means that if you can't find someone to cover a shift , then you'll have to do it . 
 of course . It's be against the law if we didn't . 
 you are welcome . Come in early tomorrow and I'll show you how to do the scheduling . 
 Oh , it's nothing to speak of . 
 Thank you . I appreciate the compliment . 
 Well , of course I can ’ t miss it . Which team are you for ? 
 Me too . Do you think they are going to get the championship this time ? 
 Where are you going to spend your holidays this year , Tom ? 
 Will you travel by sea or by air ? 
 I'm sure you'll enjoy yourselves . 
 Really ? How do you get the chance ? 
 Congratulations . How lucky you are ! 
 I ’ m sure you ’ ll enjoy the trip . China is such a beautiful country . 
 Have a nice journey , Lily . 
 Your search on this project has been excellent . 
 The final report is exceptionally thorough and well done . I think that you have been come up with some interesting recommendations for the client . 
 I am sure they will be pleased . 
 I think it is easy . I could work in your class with no problem . 
 Oh , without doubt.When is the next class ? 
 No problem . 
 Of course , easy.No sweat . 
 Are you kidding me ? It's going to be up a piece of cake . 
 Yeah , what't the bet ? 
 Happy Birthday , Mary ! 
 Here is a gift for you . I hope you like it . 
 I had my own ways of finding out.It ' s a secret . You look so beautiful today . Your new shirt goes well with your skirt . 
 Really ? It looks so nice . 
 All right . 
 No , thanks . I've had enough.Now , Mary , before you blow out the birthday candles , you have to make a wish.After that , you may cut the cake . 
 No , just a small one.Next Let's sing " Happy Birthday " to Mary . 
 Does anyone mind me turning on the air conditioning ? It's hot in here . 
 All right . I'm opening the window , though , is that OK ? 
 More and more women don ’ t want to stay at home and keep house now . 
 Now , many people think that women ’ s liberation is a kind of civilization , but children are getting less love from their mother because of that . What is your opinion ? 
 Thank you so much for coming tonight . Everybody really enjoyed your performance . 
 Here's the check . I included a little extra for you . 
 I know , but you deserve it . 
 Because we are partners in our science lab . Why are you so jealous ? 
 My aunt Mary just flew in from Cleveland and she laid one right on my right cheek . 
 Of course I am . I only love you , Amy . 
 Why do you always accuse me like that ? 
 Oh , Amy . I am the luckiest guy in the world . 
 Because I am loved by the most beautiful girl in the world ! 
 What are you doing this weekend ? 
 So you ’ re free on Saturday night ? 
 Would you like to have dinner with me ? 
 Perfect . I ’ ll pick you up then . 
 Hey , that was quite the presentation ! Honestly , I was completely blown away by your strategy outline . I've gotta say , Alex , you really wowed me today . 
 No , I think you deserve some recognition here ; I mean , if I look back on your previous presentations , this is a huge improvement . 
 And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies . I really appreciate you taking the time to think though my suggestions . 
 Well , I just wanted to say well done . Really you did a great job . 
 What ? 
 Jay Chou's title song in his new album . 
 Gorgeous ! There is another song combining Chinese and western music styles . I am crazy for it , so I hear it over and again . And I plan to make it as the ringbone of my mobile . 
 I suppose this song can be the No . 1 on the top chart . 
 Are you sure that this is the place to wait for our school bus ? 
 But it doesn't look like a real bus stop . 
 How much is it going to cost ? 
 Is that yellow bus it ? 
 How is Jim recently ? 
 Poor guy ! It will take him a long time to get back on his feet . 
 We all know that . Her husband always make a fuss of her . 
 Excuse me , are you American ? 
 Do you speak English ? 
 How long have you been here ? 
 What do you do for work ? 
 I'm a student too . 
 Do you have the receipt with you ? 
 Thank you . Do you want your money back ? 
 I am afraid this is the biggest size we have . 
 Maybe you would like to try this one with the willow pattern . The price is the same and it's bigger . 
 That movie's just a lot of noise , same as Simon . 
 I had to go by myself , he couldn't make it . 
 Kitty's ? He sure gets around , doesn't he ? 
 His excuse was familiar . He said his car died again . 
 I know . Last week he gave me a lie about being too busy . 
 Well , I think it's the time to pull the plug . 
 Thanks anyway , but I'll do it , Rebecca . Let's get the class . 
 Yeah , it ’ s been ages ! So how have you been ? 
 Just as usual , you know . 
 Well , Thanksgiving is family event.So on Thanksgiving , family members will get together and enjoy a big Thanksgiving dinner . Kids will have lot of fun . 
 Yes , we do . It is an exciting moment . 
 For me ? The football games of course , I love football games . 
 Just get out of my face , would you ? 
 Sorry . I'm just that I think I blew the final and now my parents are going to get all bent out of shape . I like totally drew a blank on everything ! 
 Jennifer Davies ? Give me a break ! I can't stand her . She's such a dweeb ! How could she possibly ace it when she keeps cutting class all the time ? 
 Get out of here ! 
 Oh , gag me ! She's totally gross ! 
 No , it's the Japanese team . 
 Well , their team work is well worth learning . 
 Yes . Work starts at eight and I arrive home after six . 
 I can take a break at lunch time , but it is only 30 minutes . 
 Yes , I really don't like it . 
 well , last night I had a big argument with Ann . 
 now that I look back at it , it wawsn't that big a deal . I shouldn't have lost my temper . 
 it's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while , and we decided we could both make it this weekend . Then out of nowhere she called me up , said her boyfriend had made plans and that she nee 
 I know , but I was so upset . I mean , come on ! Does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ? 
 well , I think I was being a little selfish myself . I know they don't get to see each other very often . 
 yeah , I'll call her later to patch things up . 
 Say what you want to say . 
 I am sorry . But I do not have any money to lend to you . 
 Well , thank you . 
 Well , I exercise a lot . I go running at least three times a week . But more than that I enjoy playing sports and so different sports use different muscles and all of it helps to lose that weight that you might have gained . 
 Do ya ? 
 It could be and so in that case you might want to eat something perhaps more nutritious or maybe even less of what you do eat . Maybe , I eat three meals a day and I try not to snack in between . No potato chips . No popcorn . No candy bars . 
 I don't think the manager will get mad at you for being late . 
 I hear you are moving to Dalian . 
 Well , we'll certainly miss you here . 
 Let's keep in touch . 
 Nice weather , honey ! 
 May and Daniel often like this kind of weather . 
 Honey , how about taking them to the beach this weekend ? 
 Since last time we've climbed the mountain , we haven't gone out for a long time . 
 Yes , I remember last year this time , the weather is so hot . 
 Daniel loves the beach very much ! 
 Have you met John recently ? 
 Yes , he has been like that since his accident . 
 What are you doing tonight ? 
 Don't you hate fighting the crowds on the weekends ? 
 What store do you shop at ? 
 I have been using the store across town for years . 
 They do , but they're a little expensive on certain items . 
 I will sometime . Thanks for the advice . 
 Me too . 
 Okay , I'll give you a ring next week . 
 That's a relief for me and a misery for the children . 
 It's too late . 
 My parents called . As usual , they reminded me again that I should have a plan to marry by my late 20s.Easier set than done . Who should I marry ? I have no time to go on a date . 
 I will find one myself , of course . I ’ m a modern girl . 
 You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , I hate that idea . 
 I don ’ t think it makes sense . Three minutes is such a short time . 
 Anyway , I don ’ t want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that . 
 Of course , for these sites , you have to pay a membership fee . But all in all , it is more serious and professional . The chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher . 
 Hi , dear , I've got your voice at last . 
 Are you OK today ? 
 So do I . You are a beautiful flower in my mind . 
 Did you watch the movie program on Channel 6 last night ? 
 I wonder why TV programs often show much violence . 
 They are especially harmful to teenagers . 
 I hate to see the abuse of animals . 
 Hi ! Bob , are you having problems with that ? 
 It's easy , let me help you . 
 Good morning , Mr.Jones ! 
 Nice to see you again . 
 How is everything ? 
 Quite well , thank you . 
 No , I was driven by my husband . 
 Yes , thanks . 
 No , the meeting will be held on the fourth floor . 
 Rocky six is suppose to come out this Friday . 
 The only reason I want to see it is because I have seen the previous five . 
 How about we hook up for lunch at 12:00 , and then go see the movie afterwards . 
 It's almost Christmas . What are you doing this weekend ? 
 Well , I still haven't finished my Christmas shopping . Do you want to go shopping with me this weekend ? 
 Friday's not good . I think the stores will be very crowded and I have to work . 
 Yeah , that's fine . 
 233-331-8828 . Let me give you my email address too . It's Tom861@gmail.com 
 OK . 
 Fill in the slip , then take it to the circulation desk . They will get you what you want . 
 Sorry , the stacks are closed to undergraduate students . 
 Jason , you have no taste . You think First Blood is a good movie . 
 I'm sorry , but it's a bad movie . The plot is stupid , and the script is poorly written . 
 No , I don't like action movies because I'm cultured ! 
 Are you serious ? 
 But why ? Did I do anything wrong ? 
 Hey , come on . It's too early to say that . We can fix things . 
 But I still love you . 
 I knew this would happen some day ... 
 Well . It's not all my fault , Anna ... 
 Have you made the decision yet ? 
 Then shall we keep pure friendship ? 
 Hi , charlie , are you busy this evening ? 
 What are you doing ? 
 How old is he today ? 
 Well , wish him a happy birthday for me . 
 I was just thinking of going to a movie tonight . 
 Sorry , I've got people coming over tomorrow night . 
 Sounds that way . Maybe some other time then ? 
 Yeah , me , too . It's about time I made a move . 
 Likewise . See you later . 
 I was wondering if you could help me to get a library card . 
 I'm finished . 
 OK , the form is all filled out . 
 No , I have no idea what they are . 
 Yes , right . 
 What did the boss say to you ? 
 Yeah . You look so unhappy recently . What ’ s the matter . 
 Hey Joanne . What are you up to ? 
 I'm so bored . I don't know what I'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning . 
 I don't think we are boring . It's just that we don't have any hobbies . 
 That all depends on what you like to do . For example , I like to doodle on the notepad , so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings . 
 Yeah . That can be a good hobby . 
 That's a great idea . I'm going to do the same . 
 You ! 
 You told Martha that I was on a date ? What was that all about ? 
 She started feeling suspicious after you said that . 
 Martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that Sara was just a friend . Now , I have to explain to Sara that I can't hang around her because of you . 
 Don't bother . 
 I don ’ t really mind . 
 I suppose I could . 
 All right . If you really want to . 
 It's nice of you to see my off at the airport . Thank you very much . 
 Sure . You've given a great help to me in the past days . 
 Certainly . I'll be glad to . 
 Yes , we should go . Thank you very much . Goodbye ! 
 People say that you never have a real winter in the South China , but I don't think so . 
 I did experience a winter with snow in Kunming , the Spring City . 
 Can you tell me where I can park ? 
 I drive an automobile . 
 Yes , I have seen those spots . 
 I park in the evenings . 
 Yes , I have seen those signs . 
 Yes , I know what the curb colors mean . 
 How long have you been in America ? 
 Do you think it's easy for a Chinese to get accustomed to the western culture ? 
 There are things that are actually even smaller than atoms . 
 They are the things that make up the atom , such as electrons and protons . 
 Of course there is . Things can be divided and broken down into indefinitely small parts if we can . 
 Guess what I've brought for you . 
 I hope you like it . 
 That's all right . 
 Supervisor . Open the door . 
 What are you doing here ? 
 Your neighbors complained that you were so noisy that they can't sleep . 
 Please turn down the TV . And not another shout or I'll have to report you to the school administration . 
 So Kevin , what is your type ? 
 I agree . I like guys that can make me laugh . 
 Are you free tonight ? 
 I can ’ t decide what to do today . 
 Don ’ t you think it ’ s a bit cold for that ? 
 Car trouble center . How may I help you ? 
 Hold on , before you kick your car let ’ s go through some possible problems . 
 OK , first of all , can you turn the key in the ignition ? 
 Those are possible problems , but tell me , when you turn the key , do you hear the starter motor crank ? 
 No . If you step on the accelerator pedal you can flood the carburetor and your car will never start . 
 I know this may seem like a silly question , but does your car have gasoline ? 
 I quit my job . 
 Do you have a copy of today ’ s newspaper ? I want to check the results from the world athletics championship . 
 Yes , we won the men ’ s 110 metres hurdles . I watched that on TV . What other events did we win ? 
 That ’ s great . Those athletes must train for years to get into peak physical condition . They must be terribly disappointed if they don ’ t win . 
 That ’ s amazing ! Were any other records broken ? 
 Did you see the final of the men ’ s 100 metres ? It was very exciting . One competitor made two false starts . 
 Yes , he was . I imagine he must be very angry with himself for that . 
 Thanks , Jim . I didn ’ t think guys paid attention to stuff like that . 
 Well , thanks for the compliment anyway ! 
 Sure , what's up ? 
 Good question . I have to think about it . 
 France ? Is he crazy ? 
 Well , how can I put this ? France is a terrible team . 
 My house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture . 
 Yes , I have . But I have to wait . 
 Oh , not too bad , but I've got to stay in bed . 
 Ok , I will . You have said that many times . 
 No , there ’ s no need . Thank you all the same . 
 yes , I graduated with a BA in English from Qingdao University . 
 just a few years ago . What about you ? 
 are you planning on going to university ? 
 have you applied anywhere yet ? 
 congratulations ! Which one is the cheapest ? 
 which one has the most interesting course ? 
 where would you like to be located ? 
 have you applied for grants or financial aid of some sort ? 
 I think you should do that soon . It will help you make a decision about the school you go to . 
 good luck ! 
 Yes , certainly.How can I help you ? 
 Sorry , I don ’ t know . I ’ m a passengers ’ m waiting for my train .. 
 Certainly not.Here it is . 
 Would you like a cup of coffee ? 
 Oh , no . 
 This machine is out of order . 
 I sure did . 
 You seem to like her very much , don't you ? 
 But I heard that she had a three-year-old girl . 
 There are so many environment problems in the world today . Do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world ? 
 We need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere . There ’ s lots of clean , modern technology , but companies in developed countries say it ’ s expensive . Developing countries 
 In other parts of the world , especially in Africa , there is a problem with desertification . Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert . In means that people cannot grow e 
 Have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment ? You could get involved with projects to improve the environment . 
 Going to the cafeteria ? 
 That ’ s fine with me . I don ’ t hate vegetables and I don ’ t eat much during lunch . 
 How old are you ? 
 I've brought a little dog for Alice , girls usually like looking after pets . 
 To tell you the truth , the dog isn't my real reason for coming . I want to ask Alice if she'd like to be my girlfriend . 
 hi , I'm Lucas , I just moved in next door . 
 nice to meet you too . 
 thanks . Some tea would be nice . Chinese tea is great . I really like your tea set . Where did you get it ? 
 oh yeah , I saw the tea house the other day . I think I might go and have a look sometime . It's a nice neighborhood here . 
 there's a gym nearby ? That's exciting ! I really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible . I've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight . 
 that would be wonderful . Thanks ! 
 What happened ? Did your boss say something to offend you at work ? 
 Don ’ t you think you are overreacting a little ? Calling you by nicknames shouldn ’ t be so bad ... 
 That ’ s what you get for working in a male-dominated field . I think you ’ ll find that most male bosses in your industry are already conditioned to treat females in this way . You probably won ’ t be able to change him . 
 Thomas , if I could write with the beauty in her eyes , I was born to look in them and know myself . 
 Her lips ? The early morning rose would wither on the branch if it could feel envy . 
 Deeper , softer , none of your twittering larks . I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupted her song . 
 Constantly . Without doubt , and plays the lute . She has a natural ear . 
 Sorry , I have to work overtime . 
 My boss promised to pay me double time . 
 Aren't firecrackers forbidden in the city ? 
 Fantastic ! The whole city is echoing with crackling sounds ! 
 Quite a lot . The celebration of the New Year has just started . The first day we southerners have sweet rice cakes for breakfast , and people in the North have Jiaozi . Afterward , we will make New Year calls on family relatives , husband's side on the first day and wife's side on the second . 
 That's for sure . Fruit , cream cakes , medical tonics are often for parents and aged relatives , and cash enclosed in a red envelope for the kids . All this , of course , should be well prepared beforehand . 
 Not all the same nowadays I must say . Many families , especially those of newly married couples , choose to make an overseas trip to escape the routines . Rose and I had a tour to Singapore , Malaysia , Thailand and Hong Kong last year . We stayed there for two weeks until the last day of the holiday . 
 Well , for city dwellers , the Spring Festival is a holiday of seven days . While in the country where traditions are still heavily emphasized , the festival lasts ten days . 
 I don't know why I cannot take a step forward . 
 Many things are troubling me . I don't know whether I should come and go . 
 How's your new apartment ? 
 What's wrong ? 
 Does it make a lot of noise ? 
 Dad , I ’ d like to borrow some money . 
 Come on , Dad , I need thirty thousand . I wanna get into the market . You know , I ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . I look at this as an opportunity . This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg . 
 But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity . And anyway , I ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example , they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity . 
 Fine , then ! If that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . But you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ’ m going to go hit up Mum for the cash . 
 It ’ s harmful not only for yourself but for others . 
 Stop producing cigarettes . 
 That ’ s right . But I don ’ t think there are better ways . 
 Maybe it can take effect . 
 I like playing computer games , but I'm not really into board games . 
 the Rubik's cube is so difficult to solve that I think it should be banned ! 
 how did you figure out how to slove the Rubik's cube ? 
 I had no idea there were a set of instructions . I thought everyone who could solve it were all geniuses ! 
 it's a deal . 
 yeah . That was a strange party . Can you still do any of those yo-yo tricks ? 
 I could never figure out how to use my yo-yo . 
 let's get started with this game then . 
 A beautiful center ! 
 A goal ! 
 What is it ? 
 Why ? 
 It's so that I can be put into the right math and English classes , right ? 
 This is going to take more time than I thought . 
 Okay . Let ’ s clear the air . What are you getting at ? 
 I ’ m sorry . But I don ’ t meant to get your goat . 
 The Godfather and The Godfather II , of course . They were both directed by Francis Ford Coppola . 
 Only about old movies , really ... 
 It ’ s a typical of them to do so . 
 We must keep developing our economy and unite with other developing countries to fight against it . 
 That ’ s great . What are the prizes ? 
 To encourage the staff increases . 
 What about the afternoon ? 
 How do you get along with your co-workers ? 
 Do you think management should fire someone just because they gossip ? 
 So how do you develop good relationships in the office ? 
 I think you're right , but it does seem that there are always a few co — workers that are harder to work with than others . 
 I'm glad you came . You're welcome anytime . 
 I will . See you later . 
 I met him through a computer bulletin board . 
 It was one I used down at the local coffee house called the San Francisco Net . It's been around since around 1991 . 
 You ought to . One dollar buys you 15 minutes of computer time . A Chat session links you with cappuccino sippers in other cafes and also to home computers on the network . 
 That's the whole point . All your inhibitions disappear because you can ’ t see the other person . This network allows you to talk to people whom you normally wouldn ’ t talk to . 
 You can do that . A private session lets two people talk alone . This techno-chat program lets you talk about anything with everybody , without prejudice because you can ’ t see them . 
 That's fine with me , but we'll have to get there early . Because after 8 pm , there is always a long line . 
 It sure is . 
 Yes , it looks interesting . 
 It must be old . 
 Let's enter it ! 
 It must be locked . 
 She can't answer you . 
 It must be a haunted house . Are you frightened ? 
 Have a nice weekend ! 
 Do you have any plans ? 
 Oh , I haven't decided what I'm going to do yet . 
 I major in Chemistry . 
 Organic Chemistry is my specialty . 
 I have no idea . 
 It isn't a good time because there must be many tourists in the scenic spots . What about your plans ? 
 Good morning , John . Have you finished reading the novel by Dickens borrowed from the library ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . How are you feeling now ? 
 How many days do you plan to finish reading it ? 
 OK . After three days , I will come to you for it . 
 Ouch ! 
 Yeah , I just bumped into the table . 
 Hum , me too . This winter holiday was especially long . What have you done ? 
 You know , I like traveling . I made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself . 
 Where did you get that idea ? 
 Well , I ’ m still not sure what you ’ re asking me . 
 Do you want to know something about the American character ? 
 No , this will help answer your question . In American society boys and girls are raised together . They ’ re not segregated in their activities ! Boys and girls go out together from an early age . 
 After being raised together , men and women can be business-like in each other ’ s company . It really doesn ’ t have anything to do with the way a man and woman behave toward each other when they are in love . Does that answer your question ? 
 I think Americans are pretty romantic when they are in a relationship and a lot of flirting goes on in every office . After you ’ Ve been in America for a while , you will probably see what I mean . 
 Yes , the weather sure is nice today . 
 That sounds like a good idea.The sky is clear , the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot . 
 Hey , this spot in the shade looks really comfortable . 
 I don't think so . I say the weather report last night , and it said the weather should be fine all day . 
 Are you going to the cafeteria downstairs ? 
 Could you please get me a takeaway ? I have some urgent work to finish . So I don ’ t have enough time to go out for lunch . 
 I am not picky on food . Just bring me the day menu . 
 150 pounds . 
 I can't bear eating less . 
 Yeah . Last semester . 
 It was Professor Johnson . 
 He's a terrible instructor and demands a lot , but fortunately , he's an easy grader . 
 I got an A - . Sounds good , but none of my test scores were that high , so I don't know how I got a decent grade . 
 Are you enjoying the class so far ? 
 Yes . Definitely stay in the class . You will get a better grade than your test scores . He does that deliberately to make all the students study a lot . 
 So how long have you known Mary ? 
 Only four days ! That's so short , and you seem so crazy about her . 
 Hi , happy new year ! 
 Time flies ! One year has already been a history ! 
 Yeah . Have you made any good resolutions for this new year ? 
 I want to be healthier this year , so I think I should take more exercise . 
 Maybe I should make a plan about learning my biochemistry , which is a mess ! 
 It's weekend again , I'm glad I can arrange for my personal matters . 
 Oh , that means I can do whatever I like without few interruptions . 
 Oh , really ? I just have lots of hobbies in my spare time ; such as going to the concert , painting , handwriting , reading novels and reading fashion magazines . What about yours ? 
 Oh , you can't think like that . We young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas . You like taking photos and going to photography shows , why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable ? 
 I quite agree with you . With our hobbies , our life can be more colorful and exciting . 
 Yes , it's a good habit to have a life-long hobby . Those who practise calligraphy and Qigong always live longer . 
 Umm ... I think so . What's up ? 
 Really ? Are you OK ? 
 If the injury is workplace related I'm sure it's completely covered . 
 Sure . Basically we have two insurance policies for employees ... workman's compensation and medical insurance . The company pays the premiums for workman's compensation , and for a significant part of the medical coverage , but you pay part of that premium , too . 
 Yep . Every country in the world has a different system , but here we buy insurance from a private provider . 
 That's right . The company pays for all your medical bills and there is also some financial compensation if you have to take days off to see doctors or spend time recuperating . 
 Try to keep cool . It's not an easy take . 
 Then you will be in line for a doom . 
 I ’ m great . Thanks . 
 I need your help . 
 I need to find this newspaper article . 
 I forgot about that section . 
 Could you do that ? 
 Thank you for all your help . 
 You ’ re in America now , my British friend . We just call it football . 
 The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked , but the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone . 
 Yeah , he tackled him so hard his helmet came off . 
 It looks like it , he ’ s getting up . 
 The Giants ? 
 Well , here we go again . 
 The Redskin ’ s quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . We ’ re losing again . 
 Sure . I thought people only showed off pictures of their new babies , not new pets ! 
 I see what you mean . He ’ s really cute . How old is he ? 
 Are you going to take your children along ? 
 Have a nice holiday ! 
 What kind of movie is it ? 
 Oh , I've no interest in such films . 
 I am seven . 
 Yes , I am seven . I am a big girl now . 
 Yes , come on , and we will have fun . 
 Why , this is the most interesting film ! 
 But it's only a film . 
 What is it ? 
 What ? Do you mean that you are pregnant ? Is it true ? 
 Oh , dear , I'm so happy . 
 Hi . You enjoying the party ? 
 Yes . The drinks are very good ! I'm Paul , by the way . 
 I'm in finance . You ? 
 T & D ? Oh , yes , sure . How long have you worked there ? 
 No . Actually , I'm based in Shanghai . I'm just here for the conference . So , T & D eh ... 
 Not anymore . Now I work nine hours a day , and I get a good sleep almost every night . No more burning the candle at both ends . 
 And ? 
 Poor child ! 
 Yes , I am . You must be Tom . Nice to meet you . 
 Be careful , Tom . Those are pretty heavy . 
 Would you mind taking your feet off the table , Mike ? 
 Do you put your feet on your own table ? 
 Why not ? 
 Well , will you please put them down ? 
 I forgot something on the table . 
 May I help you ? 
 Let me see your library card . 
 You can apply for one right now , if you ’ d like . 
 Could you fill out this application ? 
 Could you please sign the back of the card ? 
 That ’ s it . 
 But the auction is a blast ! And I haven't even told you the best part yet ! 
 That stamp you've been looking for is for sale . 
 Hey ! I thought you weren't interested ! Sorry , I've gotta go ! I'm going to switch over to eBay and see if my bid is still the highest . 
 I'm not sure . I guess I'll just stay at home . Maybe I'll catch up on my reading . What about you ? Any plans ? 
 Sounds great ! 
 Do you mean it ? I'd love to ! 
 Oh , my dear lady.Take it easy.You should forgive a green hand like him . 
 I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems . 
 Maybe you should communicate with him like a friend and not a boss . 
 Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper . 
 I disagree . All you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions . 
 Yes , of course . I love the picnic party . It ’ s really family fun time . 
 Right , she is so excited and simply can ’ t wait . 
 Frank , I want your advice on something . Some scientists I met at the conference 6 this afternoon have invited me to a party . Actually , they called it an informal get-together . 
 When I asked how people were going to dress , Dr . Lite said it was casual . 
 Well , last night I went out with some journalists for a casual party , but I was overdressed . I wore what I consider casual - - an outfit of skirt , blouse , scarf , and medium heels ... you know . 
 Everyone else there was wearing blue jeans . Several of the women had on running shoes . I felt out of place . So I have no idea what to wear tonight . 
 T he nineteenth of June is my birthday . I'm planning to have a small party . Could you come ? 
 Who got ripped off ? 
 Well , maybe not 100 percent . I did hear about some tricks people use . 
 There are shills . A shill is someone who bids up the price of their own sale . 
 How many courses do you have for this semester ? 
 How are they proportioned ? 
 I ’ Ve always wondered , what ’ s the difference between English for Chinese students and English for native students ? 
 I think a Chinese student concentrates on written English , and uses it as a basis for communicating . From start to finish he ’ s learning vocabulary and fundamentals of grammar . This is a very difficult way to learn . 
 They get higher level English , which is more formal than everyday spoken English . They also deal with matters of style and creativity . 
 Absolutely not ! Native speakers make a lot of grammar mistakes , especially if they come from a home where nonstandard English is spoken . 
 Actually there are more non-native speakers than you think . That ’ s why it ’ s so important to quit worrying about making mistakes . Just talk to everyone every chance you get . 
 No , I shouldn ’ t think so . But you must take your passport of course . 
 Yes , you need the traveler ’ s check but you needn ’ t get any foreign currency . You can have my US Dollars , I don ’ t need them . 
 You needn ’ t buy one . You can have mine . 
 Don ’ t be silly , John . I ’ m going with you . It ’ s necessary for me to have a holiday too . 
 yes , it's my new business phone . Do you like it ? 
 yes , it's got wireless Internet access . 
 yes , but I don't really use it that often . Have you ever used it ? 
 yes , I guess I should try to use it . 
 of course it does . Doesn't every new phone include a camera these days ? 
 sure . Here you go . 
 no , why ? 
 oh , yeah . Probably . I don't really know how to use this phone yet . 
 no , it's ok . Check your email first ; I'll check my unbox later . 
 I'm surprised you know so much about it . Where's your phone ? 
 how have you been living without a cell phone for a week ? hasn't it been driving you carry being without a phone ? 
 let's go shopping . You can't depend on public phones in this day and age ! 
 Well , it ’ s hard to say . I coughed a lot in the evening . 
 You ’ re right . But you know it ’ s so hard to give up the old habit like smoking . 
 You know I often have to work far into the night . I need smoking to keep me awake . 
 Thank you for your advice . I ’ ll try it . 
 There're many things I can do on weekends . 
 I'm keen on talking short trips to nearby scenic spots . More often than not , I go with some of my friends . By the way , what are your favorites ? 
 That's great ! I think they do you a lot of good . Where do you swim ? 
 I'm fond of dancing . 
 Why did the boss come down on Joe like a ton of bricks . 
 How did he know that he had bad mouthed him ? 
 He is then in a very difficult situation . 
 I'm sorry for spilling my drink on your rug . 
 But I ruined your rug . 
 Why are you cut up recently , Nancy ? 
 Oh , cheer up . A boyfriend is not everything . 
 We'd like a half-day package . 
 How many can we choose ? 
 We'll do the seaweed wrap , the jet bath , and the foot massage . 
 Are you going to Helen ’ s birthday party on Friday evening ? 
 If everyone turned up , it would be a squeeze , but a few people said that they couldn ’ t go , so I think it should be ok ? 
 I ’ Ve got her a birthday present and I ’ ll take a bottle fo wine too . 
 Helen gets on very well with her neighbours . I wouldn ’ t be surprised if they went to the party too . 
 Well , don ’ t be late . I ’ ll see you on Friday at Helen ’ s . 
 That ’ s understandable . Every kid likes new clothes . 
 Shall we have two tickets for for seven thirty ? 
 In the front , please . 
 I learned to drive and I got a driving license . 
 Travel . 
 No , not very much . He ’ s too ambitious and dishonest . 
 Yes . They are completely different . Paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother . 
 I think I ’ m polite , careful , relaxed and shy . 
 Well , yes , but those people always start talking to me . I never talk to them first . Perhaps I ’ m not as shy as I think . Anyway , you ’ re certainly not shy ! 
 So , you ’ ll be at my birthday party on Friday ? 
 Hello 。 this is Susan . 
 Yes , I think So . 
 What ’ s the time ? 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry I can ’ t.because I have to do some housework.You can ask Jenny to go with you . 
 Good bye ! 
 It's a boy . 
 Well , there are several things . Of course , you must do everything you can to keep costs down and revenues high . 
 No . if you do that , the workers won ’ t like their jobs . They will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . Those things will increase you costs . 
 You need to invest in some good advertising . You have to know where your potential customers are and target them . It ’ s no good trying to sell computer games to older people . The market is too small . 
 Find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . Price yourself near the low end . Don ’ t be much cheaper than everyone else , because many customers distrust very cheap things . They think that is must be poor quality if it ’ s that cheap . 
 Yes , it's great for cleaning up spills . 
 I hear that his father died . 
 He is out of luck . 
 And we ’ re on the brink of soccer history today , as Ecuador and Brazil are tied one-one as we begin the second half of the 2022 World Cup ! 
 That will be a throw in for Brazil . Adriano has the ball and makes a long pass to Robin , and the ref has called him offside . 
 Delgado takes the corner . We have a foul ! Oh no , Did , the goalkeeper , has fouled the Ecuadorian player ! He gets a yellow card and that will be a penalty kick ! 
 Hi , I'm Jake . I'm new to the choir . What's your name ? 
 Do you sing alto ? 
 Looks like we both float back and forth . I'm baritone . 
 I heard them warming up earlier . You're right . 
 How happy you are ! Next Monday is your wedding day . Congratulations ! 
 Fred is really a good guy . And he loves you so much . 
 He's after your own heart , it is important . 
 I promise ! 
 They sure are . They are practically jumping in the boat . 
 We're catching most of our fish with lures . 
 What kind of live bait are you using ? Worms or minnows ? 
 Are you having any luck with the worms ? 
 That's too bad . Why don't you try using lures instead ? 
 That's too bad . Well , where are you fishing ? 
 We went out in our boat . I have a favorite fishing hole out there . 
 Oh no , I can't tell you . It's a secret . Say , why don't you go over by the lily pads and try fishing there ? 
 Sure , I used to catch my legal limit of bass there all the time . 
 Good luck . I hope you each some fish . 
 No , I haven ’ t . This is the first time I have been to China . 
 To be honest , I have never been to an Asian country before but I have visited many countries in Europe . 
 Actually , I haven ’ t been to the states but I have been to Canada . 
 I like all kinds of stuff . I admit I love romance . 
 You mean my favorite movie of all time ? I guess I ’ d have to say “ pretty woman ” . 
 By the way , could you tell me what day it is today ? 
 And the date , please . 
 What will you do now ? Propose to her . 
 You should strike while the iron is hot . 
 Would you allow me to drive your car ? 
 Surely I will . 
 I could get along fine without all the office politics . 
 There is a position I've had my eye on for several months now and I had good reason to believe that it was mine for the asking . 
 We were awarded government funding last year and in order to keep it we have to hire so Ay new employees . 
 Someone in the main office has a nephew who he thinks can slide right into the Management position I wanted . 
 Hello , Hanson . Today I come to say goodbye to you , for I'm going back to London tomorrow . 
 Much as I wish to but I really can ’ t . I've already booked the flight . 
 Of course not . You can come to London to visit me in future . And I also will come here if I have a chance . 
 I will miss you , too . You're really a good friend . 
 It doesn't matter . 
 I will . 
 Thankyou . Goodbye ! 
 It ’ s an article about language . It talks about the idea of having a single global language . 
 Actually , it suggest English . The main argument is that English is already being studied as a second language in most countries-china , India , mexico , Nigeria , Pakistan , and japan – so beginning again 
 The article points out that many languages have been lost and will be lost , but others will continue to be used for generation , even if English continues to be the dominant language . 
 Hi , Shelley . Have you had lunch ? 
 So shall we have lunch together ? I ’ d like to take you this time . 
 How come ? 
 All right . Can we make it another time ? 
 I ’ ll call you later . Bye . 
 Our neighbour ’ s tape recorder is so loud that it annoys us to death . I ’ Ve made up my mind to cut the electricity off . 
 Then what shall we do ? 
 Welcome to our school . If you need any help , please come to me . 
 What do you think about violence in movies ? 
 But kids like watching things like that . It's just for fun , would't you say ? 
 I know you are a good dancer . What dances do you like ? 
 Why do you like old styles of dance ? 
 I think so , because most young people like modern dances , such as rock and roll . 
 OK , I will.Thank you . 
 Sure . What do you want to find ? 
 Well , can you be more specific ? There are a lot of websites about that . 
 Ok . Well , go to www.google.com , and type in Normandy Landing . 
 Here , try this one . It's a good site about Normandy Landing . 
 For detailed information , however , you should read a history book . 
 I want to redo this poster , but John and Mary think it's good enough as it is . 
 We're lucky today . 
 Where's Hyde Park ? 
 That's the place where people make speeches on Sundays , isn't it ? 
 Well , are we going there today ? I want to take shots there . 
 Of course . Everything's so striking and fascinating . 
 Awesome , we went to Australia and New Zealand . 
 Well , we went bungee jumping when we were in Australia . 
 A little , but the rush was worth it . 
 We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us . 
 Yeah , it was scary , but exhilarating . 
 It ’ s pretty good . 
 I ’ m afraid you ’ re being too particular about your food . 
 We ’ re in the same boat ! I ’ Ve eaten fast food the whole week . I hate it now . 
 Let ’ s dine out tonight for a change ! 
 I'm afraid we can't increase salary this year , money is just too title . 
 Why not ? 
 What are you talking about , we tried everything ! 
 Why should I go against her ? She always seems to have better ideas . 
 Get the goods on her ? She never allows me to go to her office . And she is a good woman . She has been faithful all these years . 
 I'm calling to say good-bye . 
 I'm catching the eleven o'clock train . 
 Goodbye . Thanks again for everything . 
 Sure.Which one ? 
 Where do you want to sit ? 
 Are these seats all right ? They're in the second rows . 
 Sorry.We ' Ve nothing further back . 
 Thirty yuan . 
 Hi , come on in . Can I take your coat ? 
 You're the first guest to arrive . I'll just put your coat away and then I'll get you something to drink . 
 Whatever you prefer . 
 Just over three weeks . Would you like a drink ? 
 I've got white wine , red wine , gin and tonics , ginger ale , lemonade , orange juice , and sprite . 
 One glass of red wine coming up ! 
 There's just going to be 6 of us tonight . 
 Marcia and Paul called to cancel at the last moment . Paul was running late and Marcia wasn't feeling well . 
 I think there's someone at the door . Excuse me while I go and get that . 
 Yes , it's so cold . 
 Yes , I think so . The rainy season will be over soon . 
 About two months . 
 I'm used to this kind of days . 
 Spring will come soon . And we will have some pleasant weather then . 
 Would you like to go skating with me this afternoon ? 
 Maybe another time . People say that boys ' dormitories are in a mess , is it true ? 
 It's hard for me to imagine . How can you stand that ? 
 Oh my God , don't you know that such living environment is not healthy ? 
 Three months ? Incredible ! 
 A month . Don't forget to return them by the due date . 
 Bring them back to the circulation desk and renew them . 
 Sure . 
 Yes and no . I can ' t wait to go to Europe , but at the same time I am terrified . 
 Well , I have acrophobia . I have a chronic fear of flying . 
 You ' re scared of spiders ? I actually have two more phobias . Acrophobia and glossophobia . 
 Are you kidding ? When I get on stage , my palms start to sweat , I get really nervous and I can hardly speak . 
 We are such weirdos right ? 
 Hi , Ross . Glad to see you , too . 
 A party ? Yes . I'd love to . Thank you for inviting me . Will Monica come ? 
 That's great ! What time will it start at ? 
 OK . I'll come . See you then . 
 How could you have done that without asking me first ? 
 Well , you should have thought . 
 Would you like to have dinner with me tonight ? 
 I ’ ll pick you up at ... say , 7,30 ? 
 See you tonight then . 
 How are you getting along with your paper ? 
 You should hand it in before next Sunday . 
 I believe you can do a good job . 
 I'd like to . But I'm not myself today . 
 It's the end of the world for me . 
 Today , I'm told I failed three courses . 
 I'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste of time to me . 
 I hope so . 
 Really ? Why ? What happened ? 
 Oh , no . 
 So what did you do ? 
 You what ? 
 Wow , good for you . 
 Oh , no ! 
 You really have bad luck , don't you ? 
 Do you have change for a hundred ? 
 Have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ? 
 Well , but for this one , don ’ t bring your cell phone to meetings , I think it is not reasonable . What if there are some important calls ? 
 I didn ’ t pay attention to that . 
 On that day , people play all kinds of tricks on others , and the one easily taken in is called April fool . 
 April the first is coming.Be careful ! 
 What's the problem ? 
 That's OK . But you'd better take an additional course in some English schools . 
 This kind of school is good at helping people to improve their English . 
 Yes , before you start your training , they will test you on your English first . 
 I've seen her on TV but not in the flesh . 
 Joseph , who is that woman ? 
 What does she do for work ? 
 Is she American ? 
 She's really tall . Do you know her ? 
 Who's that man standing next to her ? 
 That short guy on her right . What's his name ? 
 He's really good looking . 
 Do you know him ? 
 Is he married ? 
 I remember now . I met him before . 
 So glad that you think so ! 
 Oh , really ? Thanks a lot ... well , I still have a lot to learn , I guess . 
 I'll have to think about it . 
 I'm sorry I'm late . I overslept . Is the manager here today ? 
 Oh , I hope he didn't notice me . 
 You said it . It won't happen again . Do you really think he'd fire me ? 
 You are probably right . I'll go right now and apologize . I try hard not to be late but it is difficult with Beijing traffic . 
 Sam , what shall I do with my stocks ? Will I lose money ? 
 What do you mean by that ? 
 Is that so ? 
 Ann invited us to dinner this saturday afternoon . 
 How about a china vase ? 
 Which of the two do you think is better ? I mean , what's the difference between them ? 
 I only want it for the kitchen . I like to listen to the news at breakfast time . 
 Hmm ... I'd like the cheaper one , please . Can I pay hy cheque ? 
 Did you have a good weekend ? 
 Not bad . What did you do ? 
 I wasn't feeling too well , so I stayed at home . 
 I ’ m a doctor . 
 Yes , I do . It ’ s very interesting . What ’ s your job ? 
 Oh , do you enjoy it ? 
 I'm sorry , Sam . I don't want to go to the folk concert . 
 I don't like going to the theatre . 
 Travelling , swimming , going to the cinema . And you ? 
 I like talking to you , too . 
 That's a good idea . 
 Sure ! What ' s playing ? 
 Twilight ? As in the vampire movies ? No way , I am watching that , but I don ' t understand why everyone is so excited about these films about vampires . It doesn ' t make sense . 
 I don ' t buy into that . I think it ' s just a fad . Pretty soon this will pass and everyone will be into wear-wolves or zombies ! 
 I think I'm polite , careful , relaxed and shy . 
 Well . Yes , but those people always start talking to me . I never talk to them first . Perhaps I'm not as shy as I think . Anyway , you're certainly not shy ! 
 So , you'll be at my birthday party on Friday ? 
 Let's invite Bobbie and John to our party , OK ? 
 Why ? 
 You look really wiped out ? 
 Not a good day . I hate to tell you that Mr . Thomas wants to see the profit ’ s statement for new project tomorrow morning . 
 Is this a photo of your family ? 
 You look so lovely . 
 Can you speak Japanese ? 
 Where did you learn it ? 
 How long have you been learning it ? 
 Can you speak any other languages ? 
 Mary , do you remember when we met ? 
 And I came up and asked to sit by you ... 
 May , we are fools to hang out at noon . It's dying hot today . My skin is too weak to be exposed under the summer sun . 
 You know , honey , I used it all on the way over . 
 The heat is driving crazy and I hate my new hat . 
 But I bought it to get rid of the heat . Now it does nothing but burning my head . 
 Laugh all you want , whatever . We need to get out of the heat . 
 Give me a break . It's not funny . 
 Hope so ! Good thing is that autumn is just around the corner . 
 Not a great deal . 
 For accounting system and things like that , you mean ? 
 Yes ? 
 Of course , his machine must have been connected to a computer . 
 It ’ s time for me to go now . 
 I ’ d rather you stayed in the office and did these things . 
 I ’ d rather you typed it . 
 I ’ d rather you told her . 
 I like spring . 
 Oh , everything comes back to life in spring and the weather gets warmer . 
 John , my father isn't there at all . Are you kidding ? 
 It's ... OH , it's the first of April , April Fools ' Day . 
 I've booked an air ticket to Venice . 
 I'd like to stay there for a week . 
 Certainly . 
 Did it spill on your clothes ? 
 That's OK . 
 It's no big deal . 
 Don't be silly , forget about it . 
 Yes , I am . My wife and I understand each other . 
 I don't know . But they say that Mrs . Smith wears the pants in the house . 
 That's right . She is pretty , but she wants to control everything in his life . 
 Yes . In fact there are quite a large number of people who have no food to eat and no place to live in . 
 Elaine ’ s back from school . I think it might be a nice gesture if you asked her out . I suppose she ’ s not good enough for you , is that it ? 
 How do you know ? You haven ’ t seen her since high school . I guess your evenings , whatever you do with them , are just too valuable . 
 I guess I ’ ll just have to tell Mr . Robinson that you ’ re too busy every evening – doing God knows what ... God don ’ t go on like this . If you absolutely refuse to take her out ... 
 Then I will simply have to invite all the Robinson ’ s over for dinner on Thursday . 
 Hi honey ! What ’ s wrong ? Why do you have that look on your face ? 
 No ! I said I was going to cut down which is very different . You can ’ t just expect me to go cold turkey overnight ! 
 I know , I know . I am really trying , but I don ’ t have the willpower to just quit . I can ’ t fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch ! Please understand ? 
 Jack , could you check your calendar ? 
 We're planning a weekend camping trip , and we want to know which weekend is best for everyone . 
 It is reported that the temperature is going to drop dramatically tonight . 
 Yes . So you'd better dress warmly before you go out . 
 What's wrong , Dave ? You look down today . 
 Well , English is a " paper tiger " . Its natural enemy is adequate practice . 
 I suggest you read English texts aloud every day , and try to speak more . That will be beneficial to cultivate your sense of the language . 
 The answer for number 6 is C , 7 is B , 8 is A ... 
 Sure . 7 is B . Any others ? 
 Look ! That man who is baking bread is so handsome . 
 Oh , my god ! He ’ s so perfect . 
 Have you tried university part-time jobs ? 
 I mean in the library , or in some information center.Often the university hires foreign students for part-time positions . 
 Well , since you're a foreign student , it's hard.That ' s because it's actually illegal for you to work in America . 
 Anyway , there must be some solution.You know there are many people working illegally in New York . 
 I have an idea . 
 Since you're Chinese , maybe you can find part-time work in Chinatown . 
 Well , why don't you go and look down there ? 
 It may be part-time work as a waitress or something.It would be illegal , but sometimes waitresses make a good salary . 
 I will ask my friends for you.Maybe someone knows a company that needs part-time people.That ' s another thing you should do . Ask all your friends to ask around for you.You might find something . 
 I have some photos here taken by myself . Would you like to see them ? 
 I would get Fuji 200 film for taking photos of natural beauty . 
 Excuse me , Professor , is there a time when I could meet with you ? 
 I would like to come in at three o'clock . 
 Yes , I can . 
 I got it . 
 Thank you , I'll be there . 
 At what age do children start school in your country ? 
 Do boys and girls go to school together ? 
 Do you think this is a good idea ? 
 Do some children go on to university ? 
 What examinations do they take first ? 
 How long do you usually stay at university ? 
 Are you okay , man ? You don ’ t look very well . 
 Nice ! So , where did you guys go ? 
 Oh no ! Mike ’ s birthday is a drinkfest for sure ! 
 Is that why you missed work today ? 
 Www ! 
 Too bad man , tonight is Tracy ’ s going away party and she asked if you were gonna go . 
 Hey Claire , you've been really quiet these last few days . Is something wrong ? 
 Well , stress is a real thing . It's not an imaginary condition . 
 You're not weak ... you're stressed out ! Stress has been a part of the human condition for millions of years . Back when we still lived in the trees we had to watch out for predators ... and as you might imagine , that was pretty stressful . 
 But you're actually having the same reaction as our tree-dwelling ancestors ! It's called the flight or fight response . Each time you feel like something's threatening you , your body decides whether to run away or fight ... it causes all sorts of chemical reactions in the body . 
 It could . Modern humans actually have more flight or fight responses than our ancestors did . They just had a couple of close calls every day , but today , we have dozens or even hundreds ! 
 Hey , Mary , what's up ? 
 Oh , that's exciting . What's this guy like ? Is he hot ? 
 It seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ? 
 Well , that's something I've never heard of . But if you ask me what I value most in a friend , I would have to say honesty . 
 Yeah , I know . A friend in need is a friend indeed . I don't need fair-weather friends either . 
 Really ? Can't you stay a little longer ? 
 Be seeing you then ! 
 When you are in a restaurant you want the waiter to bring the bill , what do you do to attract his attention ? 
 I went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and I noticed that many people shouted for the bill . 
 That ’ s what I thought . I just thought I ’ d ask you and see what you thought of it . Anyway , what did you do yesterday evening ? 
 Did you ? How is he these days ? 
 I need to move some furniture . Could you help me to lift it ? 
 Let ’ s move the sofa . Can you get a grip on the bottom at that end ? I ’ ll lift this end . I want to move it sideways in that direction . 
 What ? 
 Look , I've already paid for the tickets , so whether you like it or not we're going to finish watching it . 
 Come on . Give it a chance . The movie just started . 
 Yes . May I help you ? 
 I'd be very glad to show you around , but I'm very busy right now . Could you come back about 3 thirty ? 
 Good . See you later . 
 Don't open any of my forwards ! I got a virus ! 
 Yes , that's exactly the bug I got . Though , I do kind of like the pictures . 
 Wait a second-are these pictures copyrighted ? 
 Say , do you go to see your grandparents often ? 
 You are very lucky . 
 No problem . Would you like some artificial carnations ? 
 How much did you want to spend ? 
 Our most elegant flower is Golden Lily . 
 Do you want to add some baby ’ s breath for that ? They are equally popular now . 
 Yes , but there is a five dollars delivery charge . 
 Julie , what's on the tube ? 
 yeah . Maybe we can change to another channel . what about the sports channel ? Let's see if there's a game on . 
 it was a good game , but not good enough to watch again . Keep surfing . 
 oh , what is it ? 
 oh , I know this kind of shows . Sometimes they really piss me off . If I wanted reality , I'd go outside . 
 I don't get it . We have more than 100 channels and there's still nothing good on ! Maybe we should just turn off the TV , get outside , and do something real . 
 That woman is a thorough drag ! 
 She keeps spitting on the ground . 
 To be a revolutionary needs great courage ! 
 Galileo is one of them . 
 Did you go to the bank to withdraw money ? 
 So you didn ’ t . Is that right ? 
 Why didn ’ t you just answer my question directly ? Why would Chinese answer questions this way ? I simply asked if you did it or not . It ’ s a very simple question . And Chinese often give the reason before they would give a direct answer . 
 You know , today I asked a student if he brought his dictionary with him . It ’ s a rule I made for the class that everyone brings a bilingual dictionary with them because sometimes they don ’ t understand me . The funniest thing is that this student gave me a lot of reasons and no direct answer . 
 Yeah , after all the explanations like , it ’ s too heavy , I was in a hurry ... whatever . 
 Where are you going ? 
 You have got a car , haven ’ t you ? 
 Betty and I will throw a dinner party this weekend , we ’ d like you to come . 
 Sure . We ’ ll be looking forward to that day . 
 I think it's going to be a nice day . 
 But it'supposed to get cloudy and windy again this afternoon . 
 David , I heard you lost your job . 
 Well , that'll teach you to control your temper . 
 The company regulates that men should wear a suit and tie in business meeting . Company policy is not negotiable . 
 Do you know Mark ? 
 Can you introduce him to me ? 
 Did you tip the bellboy ? 
 That sounds about right to me , fifty cents a bag . If they think you don ’ t know better , they ’ ll try to get more . 
 I disagree . He was polite and informative , and he drove smoothly . One should reward good service . 
 Remember last month when we were in Europe ? Maybe Californians use that same system they add the waiter or waitress into the bill , so you don ’ t have to leave anything extra . 
 Of course ! Where are the things ? 
 Right ! I'll do it straight away . 
 William told you that his grandmother is sick , huh ? What exactly did he say ? 
 It didn't sound like he was too upset , huh ? What did you tell him ? 
 Well I hate to tell you this Jen , but both of William's grandmothers passed away more than five years ago . 
 No idea . Your guess is as good as mine . 
 Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see . 
 Sometimes , if there's music playing . 
 It all depends . If it's rock music I'll do disco , and if it's romantic music I'll do ballet . 
 I'm clipping coupons . 
 It's a good way to save money . 
 How much ? Last week I save $ 10 on food . 
 Taylor ? Taylor ! Is this a joke ? Is it really you ? But ... but ... everyone said you were dead ! 
 Oh , Taylor ! I'm so ... so happy . But then ... who's that ? 
 Okay , next question . If Eric asked you out on a date , what would you say ? 
 Let ’ s see ... If I won the lottery , I would buy two tickets for a trip around the world . 
 My dad will freak out if I even mention a trip like that ! 
 If I told her that , she would faint and have me committed ! 
 Now . you can see why it's called the Lantern Festival . 
 Did you notice the characters on the lanterns ? 
 They are puzzles . It's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the Lantern Festival . 
 Do you have s second ? 
 I want to tell you I've put in my notice . 
 I've been thinking about this for several months , well before the Spring Festival holidays . 
 Yeah , after receiving my yearly bouns , I want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market . I've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and I still haven't received a pay rise . It's unfair . 
 That's exactly why I decided to quit the job and find a new one . 
 Emm ... yes . But I wasn't too impressed . I found her a little stuck up . 
 Tom ... you are her boss , you down . Of course , she's helpful to you . 
 I don't think so actually . She never even says " hello " to me . 
 The acting of the heroine is too artificial . 
 So , John , what do you do for a living ? 
 Oh , really ? That sounds interesting , what kinds of book do you publish ? 
 Oh , What a cool job ! How long have you worked there ? 
 Are you planning on studying abroad ? 
 I feel pity for the old man . 
 It must be dreadful to grow old . 
 Dad , you keep talking about family in New Zealand . Who are they ? 
 Is uncle Bill your brother ? 
 So his two daughters are my cousins ? 
 What are step-sisters ? 
 So uncle Bill's wife is Jane's mother but not Sarah's mother . Right ? 
 And when are they coming to visit us ? 
 I'm worried sick that she will leave me tomorrow . 
 Maybe I'll have to face the music . 
 What ? 
 Is it ? 
 A magic love potion ? 
 It can't be true . 
 So what am I going to do ? 
 That sounds like a blue rose ! My sitting by his bed ? 
 All right , let's see who's ruining my TV time . 
 Is your boss named Vic ? Your pager says , This is Vic . Here I come ! 
 Here , see for yourself . That's really strange ! It's almost the same as when I ... 
 I'd like to say good-bye to everyone . 
 My plane leaves at seven twenty-five . 
 Good-bye . Remember to look me up if you're ever in Washington . 
 I came to see my aunt . 
 Yes . She lives on the next block . 
 OK . 
 How about yourself ? 
 Daniel , I am not tall enough to reach the of the blackboard . 
 OK , I've finished cleaning the blackboard . 
 Oh , I forgot about it . I'll get it . 
 I will be done before they come . 
 Did you see his last dive . 
 He's diving for the gold . 
 Yeah , I just got back this morning . 
 Well , we were only there for three days , so we didn't do too much . We went shopping and went out to dinner a few times . And at night we walked around the city with some friends . 
 Yes , I have them with me . Do you want to look at them ? 
 This one is of my wife and me on the beach , and this one is our daughter Emily standing next to my wife . 
 I know , they look very similar . 
 That was taken at the train station before we left . 
 No , not this time . We went there last time . 
 Yeah , it was a lot of fun . 
 Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks . 
 I wish you had been my history teacher ! I might have got better marks ! 
 What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ? 
 I see . I think I ’ d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again . 
 Yes , beautiful weather we're having . 
 Yes , the sun shines day after day . It's neither too hot nor too cold . 
 I hope it will last fine Sorrow . I'm going to have a picnic with my family . 
 Beg your pardon ? 
 Oh , Let me see ... It's three forty-five . Er ... wait , My watch is five minutes fast . So it should be three forty 
 Today is Friday . Are you new in Beijing ? 
 Welcome to Beijing . This is my business card . I'm an engineer . If you need any help in Beijing , just give me a call . 
 Go ahead . 
 It's October the 1st , our National Day . I'd like to talk some more , but I've got to get going now . It was nice talking to you , though . 
 I really enjoyed that film ! What about you ? 
 What part of the film do you like best ? 
 I loved it , too . To tell you the truth , I even dropped tears . 
 It has got this year's Oscar Award . 
 I just got a letter from an old high school buddy . 
 He usually keeps me posted . 
 It's hard to keep up contact when people move around so much . 
 What did you think of the film ? 
 Yes , I liked it , too . Did you like the acting ? 
 Not really . I thought it was disappointing . 
 Do you think so ? I don't like it very much . I found it rather uncomfortable . 
 Well , it doesn't seem like it.He must have forgotten . 
 I don ’ t know why bucks have such a great charm that a great many people are after nothing else . 
 But many rich guys don ’ t think they are truly happy . There is always some empty feeling deep inside them . 
 We are fishing with worms . The fish seem to like them . 
 Looks like a lucky day for everyone . 
 My what ? Oh , that , right as a trivet . 
 I will , thank you . 
 Yes . But not too much . It is considered as the head of five sacred mountains in China . 
 Because in history , the Chinese emperors used to climb onto these mountains and pay tribute to their ancestors and pray for good harvest and prosperity for the whole nation . 
 Definitely . There are many wall paintings and inscriptions on the huge rocks on the mountain . 
 That is easy . You can go directly to Tai'an city and buy a ticket to Mount Tai . 
 What's a homeroom ? 
 Cindy , I'm scared . 
 Do we have the same classes today ? 
 Do you think the school can put us in the same homeroom ? 
 Helen , you must be excited at going to America to study . 
 What do your classmates think of it ? 
 How long will you study there . 
 Which university will you go to ? 
 Good luck ! 
 Look ! Someone is celebrating his birthday . 
 Why ? Do you know that guy ? 
 That's interesting . But it would be really expensive , I suppose . Just think about all the drinks . 
 Wow . That's wonderful . 
 Nowadays , it's no difference from America . But in old times , we have traditional ways to celebrate it . 
 yeah , almost . But there is one thing . 
 I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people . I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China , but ... 
 some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others . 
 yeah . we never do that in a public office . 
 i have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding . 
 just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ? 
 Oh , I'm shocked . 
 Yes . May I help you ? 
 I'd be very glad to show you around , but I'm very busy right now.Could you come back about 3,30 ? 
 Good . See you later . 
 what's your apartment like ? 
 what is it like living in on-campus housing ? 
 did you have to pay a deposit ? 
 do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent ? 
 how long is your contract for ? 
 have you started looking again yet ? 
 Good luck ! 
 Yes . I've got to cancel my traveling plan . 
 The only thing I can do now is waiting for another chance . 
 Do you really believe in that ? If they are going to focus on something , they should do it on civil rights . 
 I understand your point , but we continue to have transgressions against human rights . If so much attention weren ’ t devoted to the topic of animals , we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala . 
 Well , you are right on that point . This is the reason that I don ’ t buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products . 
 Excuse me . May I take a picture of you and your little boy ? 
 It ’ s for a book . 
 Thank you . I appreciate your help . 
 Yeah ... hearts , stars and some weird looking things . 
 So decode this for me , Madame Psycho . 
 I'm waiting ... 
 Mary , how was your date with john ? 
 oh , really . That is great news . What does he look like ? 
 sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ? 
 Did you go to the concert last weekend ? 
 Yes , I did . I enjoyed it a lot.There was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist . 
 I only paid two dollars for mine . 
 It leaves in 20 minutes . 
 Can you pick me up from the airport ? 
 OK , which car do you want me to put them in ? 
 Which one is hers ? 
 What should I take first ? 
 Don't worry , I won't drop it . Wow , it's really heavy . I don't think I can move it by myself . 
 Where are you taking all this stuff ? 
 You're moving now ? I knew you were moving , but I thought you said you were moving next month . 
 Have you received your TOWEL test results yet ? 
 Congratulations ! I knew you could do it . 
 Thank you , but it was your hard work that did it . 
 You didn't come to work yesterday.What happened ? 
 What's wrong with him ? 
 Is he getting better now ? 
 It sure is hot today . 
 how's it going ? 
 to be honest , I'm a bit fed up . 
 there's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around . 
 sure , but how ? 
 but for what reasons ? She doesn't even know who I am . 
 easier said than done . 
 but I always get tongue-tied when I see her . 
 I see . I'll try . 
 It's getting late . I'm afraid I have to leave.Thank you for a most wonderful evening . 
 OK . 
 OK . Do you think we can go buy a newspaper first ? 
 Are we going to walk or drive ? 
 The weather is good now , but I think it's suppose to rain this afternoon . 
 No , he's still sleeping . 
 Yeah , he didn't come home until 12:00 AM . 
 I hope so too . I'll give him a call when we get there . 
 It's straight down this road on the left , next to the museum . It takes about 10 minutes . 
 Thank you for saying so . I don ’ t know , probably because I like sharing my experience and knowledge with them . I think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues . 
 That is true . Some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way . For example , it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people . To show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 I'm going to graduate this summer . 
 I'm planning to return to China after graduation . 
 well , I think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment . 
 absolutely , many Chinese enterprises are going global , and they are in great need of excellent returnees to help them with their overseas business . 
 that's right . Most of the Chinese students pursuing higher education in Australia intend to return to China . 
 It's nice . But what kind of dress are you looking for ? 
 Of course . It's common too that we wear something special for our Chinese New Year . 
 Any other common customs of your New Year ? 
 What's that ? 
 By the way , where are you going on New Year's Eve ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Is that spelt M , A , C or M , C ? 
 Hey , you wanna see a movie tomorrow ? 
 How about Legally Blonde . 
 Isn't that a scary movie ? 
 Ok . I'll give it a try . 
 Ok . See you tomorrow . 
 Do you know what class you want to take ? 
 I believe there are still two Psychology classes open . 
 There is one class on Tuesday and Thursday from 2 to 4 . 
 It's from 10-12 on Monday and Wednesday . 
 These two are the only ones . 
 Very good . 
 Autumn . Autumn is the best season in Beijing . 
 How would you like your hair cut ? 
 Then , I'll just trim it . 
 Lucy , you ’ re back . How was your first day of school ? 
 What classes did you have ? 
 What do you think about the teachers ? 
 That ’ s too bad . How was your English teacher ? 
 Where is she from ? 
 Were you able to understand everything that she said ? 
 She sounds like a good teacher . Do you think you ’ ll pass her class ? 
 What does that mean ? 
 If you like the class this much already , I ’ m sure you will . 
 did she give you any homework ? 
 no wonder you like the class so much . 
 Oh , no . I forgot to turn the alarm clock on ! 
 Thank you . You save me . 
 A man is pursuing me . He was my schoolmate in college , and he has been carrying a torch for me for three years . 
 Yes , I do like him . 
 You know that I have had a series of miserable relationships . Last summer , I fell in love with John . But the romance blossomed for six or seven weeks , and then wilted . 
 Maybe you are right . 
 The same as usual . 
 How do you know ? 
 Do they know what the robber looks like ? 
 What race is he ? 
 The TV news doesn't tell us the race anymore . 
 But how can we identify someone if we don't know their race ? 
 Then they also shouldn't tell us if the robber is male or female , because that is sexist . 
 Oh , there are so many good ones ! I loved the Spice Girls . They were so cool ! 
 I was really sad too , but at least I can still listen to their Cds . 
 Janice , I found you stole my vegetables at four o'clock this morning . Is that true ? 
 It is so hard to prevent them from being stolen . I also got something this morning . 
 I stole many from Fred's farm , and from yours . I planned to have a dog on farm . 
 I could not agree with you more . For us , there are so many unhappy things and I am so bored ; however , I got lots of fun from stealing . 
 But we still need to go back to it . Don't overdo it . 
 Mm ? 
 Of course , Jim . Have I met Tom before ? 
 Oh , yes . I remember Tom . His family comes from Maine , right ? 
 Do you know who ’ s just got married ? Old Mc Donald . 
 He ’ s nearly 90 . 
 I am . Whatsmore , his wife is 84 . 
 Yes , she is . And guess what , he is her sixth husband . 
 I wanna register for this mathematics course . 
 Closed ? The clerk told me I could come back and register any time during the first week of classes . 
 Some woman in here when I tried to register three weeks ago . She said I just had to pay a late fee . 
 She said I couldn ’ t until I had my birth certificate . Here it is . 
 Serious ? Only the proof of my address . 
 But it ’ s unfair . 
 Great . 
 Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? 
 But you should have told me you were in love with her . 
 You know you didn't . 
 Yes , but you might have told me before . 
 You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ? 
 Oh , you men ! You're all the same . 
 Give them a buzz ? What can I say to them ? Say that you want a loan ? 
 And they , too , want to make sure their loan is worthwhile . 
 To the cinema . What about coming with me ? 
 What a pity . I believe it's a very good film . 
 Once a week . Most nights I sit at home and watch telly 
 No , I'm sorry I don't . I never read the papers till I get home . 
 I don't know yet . My wife's going to her mother's for a couple of weeks . She Livesay the sea , you know . 
 Yes , but I want to go to the country . 
 Yes , very much . But I need peace and quiet when I'm on holiday . What are coughing to do ? 
 Aren't you going to have a holiday abroad this year ? 
 Hi charles , I want you know that I finally found an apartment in Haitian . 
 Yeah , I am having a party this saturday night , a sort of house warming , and i want to invite you . are you busy ? 
 Around seven . 
 No , but thanks for offering , actually could you bring some fold-up chairs for people if you have any ? I am afraid not everyone's going to have a seat , do you have any ? 
 Don't worry , I will come to pick you up at about 6 thirty . 
 Hey , Dora ! What kind of books do you like to read ? 
 I hate to tell you this , but they are nothing but sob stories . 
 I'm fond of history books . 
 What ? I don't get it ... 
 Well , I'm glad I made everyone happy . 
 I'm glad you guys all have such a good sense of humor . Ha-ha ... 
 Is anybody in ? 
 I have a headache . 
 OK . 
 I thought so . I felt dizzy this morning . 
 Can you tell me a little about Paris ? 
 I want to see some of the famous places like Eiffel Tower , the Seine River ... 
 That's a good idea . I almost forget it.What else ? 
 Oh , wonderful ! How is the weather ? 
 Sounds exciting . I can't wait . 
 Don't look a gift horse in the mouth ! That was the best they had . 
 There is nothing good at the moment.Let ' s do something different.Would you like to go to a concert ? 
 Fine ! Do you want anything to eat now ? 
 Well , let's go and have something to drink instead . I know a good place . It's a little expensive , but it's fun . 
 Absolutely not ! I'm not a thief . 
 My country is well know for being very flat . There are some hills in the southeast of the country . 
 Pretty much . The land rises and falls only a few meters . The southeast , the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . There are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country . 
 The coast of your country is very varied . The coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches . 
 There are many lakes and rivers in your country too . We also have many rivers , but only a few lakes . 
 Any idea about James ? He ’ s a pain in the neck . 
 Oh , is that so ? 
 Is this your new teacher ? 
 Is she short ? 
 What color are her eyes ? 
 What color is her hair ? 
 And how old is she ? 
 Do you know that Mary ’ s marriage is on the rocks ? 
 I saw her husband have it out with her yesterday . 
 I don ’ t understand why you always look so happy , so energetic . It seems like you ’ Ve got good news everyday . 
 All I know is you look quite differently from other teachers . 
 Oh , I know . I saw you doing pull-ups one time on the campus and some students trying to imitate you . 
 It ’ s true . Many students do the exercise when they have to . We have P . E . once a week . 
 Of course . I didn ’ t know that . I only know exercise makes bodies stronger . I should take some exercise then . Do you have any suggestions ? 
 Oh , I know . Thank you . 
 Because it was her husband who beat her . 
 She said that she didn ’ t want to foul her own nest . 
 I am , sir . 
 It's me , sir . But I am sorry I have forgotten to prepare for it . 
 How was your job at the state-owned enterprise ? 
 You changed jobs again ? Why do you move so frequently ? 
 Why don't you stick with one job for a bit longer ? 
 How's your current job going ? 
 Do you have a boyfriend ? 
 Well , I came to know a girl 3 weeks ago and we have so much in common . 
 So I think I may fall in love with her . 
 Then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in love ? 
 That's what I did . 
 Yes . 
 That's it . She likes dogs so much now , and I begin to love dogs . 
 Thanks . But I know falling in love is one thing , while staying in love is another . 
 Yeah . Falling in love is so good ! 
 If you wanna keep healthy , you must give up smoking . It's extremely bad for your health , you know . 
 Well , I've got an idea , put the label cancer sticks on each pack of cigarettes , and read it before you smoke . It may give you a feeling to reduce it . 
 What happened ? 
 Let's stop and have a look . 
 I'm curious about that . 
 It ’ s very kind of you to invite me to dinner . 
 This dish is really delicious . 
 You ’ re great . Could you say it in Chinese ? 
 Wake up , Erik , time to rise and shine . 
 You and everyone else . It looks more like a camp-ground than a library . 
 Have you had any luck finding a topic for your paper ? 
 Well , why not write about the ancient civilizations of Mexico . You seem to be interested in that part of the world . 
 So they limit it to one region of Mexico . Say the Yucatan . You ’ Ve been there and you said it ’ s got lots of interesting relics . 
 I really like my debate class . 
 I've entertained the idea . But I'm I leaning more toward politics . 
 That's not like you to generalize . 
 I think I can do a lot of good for our country . 
 I dare you to talk to that girl . 
 Hey , what's the matter ? 
 Are you sure that this has nothing to do with sleep ? 
 Excuse me . My name is David Walker . Haven't we met before ? 
 Yes , I do . 
 The last thing I want to see is to lose face before my friends . 
 But you know , things cannot always go as you expect . 
 Have you ever thought about having children , Kaitlyn ? 
 Well , I ’ Ve always wanted to have lots of children . Growing up with only one brother , I always felt a bit lonely . What do you think about families with only one child ? 
 Don ’ t you think you would miss having other people around ? 
 If China didn ’ t have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ? 
 Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ? 
 I'm sorry I'm late . 
 The bus I took . 
 I took the wrong bus . 
 Hi , Anna . I haven ’ t seen you for ages . Where have you been ? 
 No wonder I haven ’ t seen you recently . Where did you spend your holidays ? 
 You must have a wonderful time . 
 No , my wife doesn ’ t like traveling . We haven ’ t been traveling for more than ten years . The first time we traveled together was in 1978 when we just got married . We spent our honeymoon in the Alps . 
 Why ? Is there some new , cool computer out on the market ? 
 That's a notebook ? 
 It looks more like a toy , or a cool briefcase ! 
 There ’ s some , but I don ’ t think it ’ s a big problem . A lot of it is petty crime , burglary and car theft . There ’ s very little major crime . 
 That happens in many places . In my city , there is a very good drug rehabilitation programme . The police and courts are also tough on people who commit crimes , but I don ’ t know if that ’ s the reason for 
 I think that the best way to reduce crime is to spread wealth more evenly . If most people have similar amounts of money , they will not think of stealing from others . 
 Why do you like this computer ? 
 What can I do for you today ? 
 Can I do anything else for you ? 
 Is that all ? 
 May I see your library card ? 
 You have to take care of this video . 
 You will be fined if you damage it . 
 Good game ? 
 Yes , I know . Kind of hard to concentrate , isn't it ? 
 Oh , just on my own . I just joined , so I don't really have any partners . 
 16 . Yours ? 
 Jane . Nice to meet you . 
 Yes , it's fine . However , I personally think the fairways between the greens are a bit too long , especially for such a hot climate . Don't they have carts ? 
 Oh , that's good . I guess the caddies were pleased . 
 Yes , but look at it this way , getting rid of the carts probably gives more work to local people , which is a good thing , right ? 
 How awful , poor guy . 
 Oh , my God , you're kidding me ! He carried him back ? 
 Can I get you something to drink ? 
 I guess I could take a break.So , how do you like Denver ? 
 About six years ... 
 I manage one of the ski lodges.It ' s a great job , I can spend a lot of my time outdoors , and I also get to ski for free all season . 
 That's okay.If it weren't for you accountants , nobody would have the money to go skiing ! 
 I ’ m just looking at this map of the world . I ’ m preparing for a geography class . 
 No , there aren ’ t . this map just show the geographical features . Look at the Himalayan plateau with the highest peaks in the world . 
 I find it incredible how millions of years of volcanic activity have created mountains thousands of metres tall . 
 The oceans and landscapes all influence our climate . 
 I'm sorry , I'm having a little trouble understanding your accent . 
 What's your favourite steps ? 
 How about rumba ? 
 Really ? You must like tango , right ? 
 Don't be so modest . I'm sure you can dance it very well . Let's dance it now . 
 Oh , you dance it so well . 
 I think I'm your lucky fellow . 
 He's a hero in our town . 
 Yes , indeed , People say he's the smartest young man . 
 For what reason . 
 He had better make a change . 
 I ’ m in pretty bad shape . I am having an allergy all the time . 
 I never trust those stupid doctors . 
 oh yeah ? 
 how did you feel when you graduated ? 
 what did you do after graduation ? 
 sounds like you're happy with your decision . 
 it was also a proud day for me , but I also felt like a kind of loss that day . 
 while seeing others going to work or continue their study , I didn't know what I would do . 
 I had one , but I didn't like the job very much . I wanted to attend graduate school , but I was afraid it would be too tough . 
 Ashley , what a great dinner party ! 
 Just water would be fine . 
 Yes , the chicken looks wonderful ! 
 Sure , I love salad ! 
 Yes , I think that rice will go perfectly with my chicken ! 
 How many days do you take off for Easter ? 
 What will you do for this Easter ? 
 Mary didn't pass the final exam in physics . 
 Her parents scolded her severely and she's very depressed now . 
 John dates her seven times a week . 
 I think so . Maybe he's fallen for her . 
 My uncle gave me this bicycle as a birthday present . Look ! 
 I love your bracelet . When did you get it ? 
 Yeah . It's beautiful . Is it white gold or silver ? 
 Where did you buy it ? 
 That's so sweet . What was the occasion ? 
 You're so lucky . If he bought you something for no special day , I wonder what he would buy you for your birthday . 
 What do you want ? 
 Why not a ring ? 
 But you're ready for everything else ? 
 Do you like traveling , Kathy ? 
 Or getting stuck in traffic jams when you ’ re driving . 
 Hello , Jane ! 
 Pretty good . Actually , I'm quite busy with work . By the way , say ' hello ' to your husband . 
 What am I doing ? What am I doing ? Don ’ t you know what day it is ? 
 It ’ s only the day when the world ’ s biggest sporting event is kicking off . 
 The World Cup ! The first match is today ! It ’ s Mexico vs . South Africa ! It ’ s going to be a really good match ! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . I think that South Africa 
 This is bigger than the Super Bowl , man ! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . They first start in a group stage with bigger groups , each g 
 Are you kidding ? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup ! It ’ s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! Each nation is cheering on their team , hoping they will bec 
 Whatever , I ’ m going to go watch the opening match . 
 Certainly . 
 I often play badminton with my parents . 
 Hey , I'm good at playing it . 
 My parents . 
 How about you , Daniel ? 
 Well , who is your favorite football player ? 
 Professor , can you help me add your class ? 
 No , I will have to get an add sheet . 
 No , I don't know where that is . 
 I think I can find it . 
 Thank you for letting me add your class . 
 Hi , Alice , what are you doing this sunday . 
 If you are free , maybe you can get having for my birthday party , it should be fun . 
 Around six pm . 
 No . thank you . I can handle it , but thanks for the offer . 
 Great . I have a good day , thanks again for the offer . 
 Not at all , I was totally in the dark . 
 Of course , what can I do for you ? 
 Oh , what exactly is problem ? 
 Oh , I'm so sorry , Sir . I'll see what I can do about that . 
 In the summer it gets very hot . The temperature is between often 37 and 40 centigrade . When it is hot we often get rains . The winters are drier . 
 What are the temperatures in winter ? In my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees . 
 Yeah , we do . In the middle of summer there can be found storms every day usually in the afternoon . I heard your city has a lot of fog , is that true ? 
 Yes , they are like I said we have thunderstorms . But each one usually last a few hours . Then the skys are clear again . 
 My grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child . But my parents and I never see it outside of my city . 
 As you know , my city is on the coast.the water is also not clean . But people still go swimming all year around . I prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning . 
 I can see the sun now . 
 Anyway , I dislike summer here.There ' s too much rainfall . 
 Nice to meet you , I'am Seven . I don't think I ' Ve seen you around before . 
 What do you do there ? 
 I ' Ve beaning worked IBM for years . I am vested personnel file system , He is the after sale survise director . he such a nice boss , I like working for him . 
 Yes , That's him over there-the taller , handsome one . Would you let me introduce you ? 
 How do you think should I handle this problem ? 
 But I'm already in a lot of trouble with my boss . 
 She's always bothering me . What should I do ? 
 But she always harps on me . 
 Yes , great ! 
 Yeah . Water pollution has for a long time been a major concern among the environmental issues . 
 They could generally be divided into two categories 
 Yeah . They are emitted directly into urban water supplies . 
 Indirect sources include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater . 
 Sure . It's an issue asking for everyone's participation . 
 Yes , she is my favorite girl . I've decided to go steady with her . 
 Sure . She is the ideal girl , the one I had dreamed of . 
 She is the mature , stable , feminine type . I hope one day I can marry her . 
 You're right--Italian ! Ha ! Ha ! I was trying to trick you , but you didn't fall for it ! 
 I could give you a few pointers if you want . I know a lot about coffee . 
 I'm Robert , at your service . 
 Do you use an anti-virus program to protect your computer ? 
 How often do you run your anti-virus program ? 
 Which anti-virus program would you recommend ? 
 That sounds very good . Which website should I visit to download it ? 
 What do you use your computer for ? 
 Computers are great , aren ’ t they ? I should download some program and learn how to use them . 
 What ? 
 Is it ? 
 I stayed up last night . 
 Will , I'm under a lot of pressure . My manager is very pushy . He assigned me two projects . Now the deadlines are near but I have finished neither of them . 
 Well , I guess no one can help me but myself . For the moment , I just need someone to talk to so that I can relieve my stress . 
 Oh , buddy , you are so kind . Thank you ! 
 You don't look very well . 
 Is it because of the bad weather ? It's been really miserable for the past tew days . 
 Not really , but I've got used to it now . 
 Not quite good . It's windy and dry . We have got continental climate there . It's dry all the year round . Usually autumn is the best season of the year In New York . 
 No , it isn't very cold at that time . You'll only need some light wool clothing with somejackets and shirts . 
 Yeah . I am on edge since she was out to the match . 
 I do have the confidence , but I still worry about her . 
 No problem , anytime . 
 Okay , thank you . 
 If they are just like us , they are not middle-aged . 
 Middle-aged means in the middle , Ethel , middle of life . People don't live to a hundred and fifty . 
 Oh , you know , we are not middle-aged . You're old , and I'm aging . 
 I can if you like . 
 We should certainly hold a big party for the professors and students . We could have a firework display . 
 If we do , too many people might attend . Perhaps we should invited all of them , but make a small charge to attend . 
 Good idea ! I think we could also have presentations by former students on how their experience here helped them in their lives . 
 I think that we could also produce some merchandise for the centenary-you know , T-shirts , mugs , plates , pens , and things like that . 
 I ’ m looking forward to reading that . We could have book signings by famous professors an alumni . 
 I ’ m sure that will be very popular .. OK , let ’ s think about how we can put these ideas into practice . 
 Oh , it's nothing to speak of . 
 Thank you . I appreciate the compliment . 
 My name is Sam . 
 I'm fine . Thank you . 
 I'm from England . 
 I'm a bank manager . 
 Yes . May I help you ? 
 Yes . 
 Nice to meet you , John . 
 Have you considered upgrading your system ? 
 You could consider adding a painting program to your software . It would allow you to make up your own flyers and banners for advertising . 
 You might also want to upgrade your hardware because it is pretty outdated now . 
 You'd probably need a faster processor , to begin with . And you also need a more powerful hard disc , more memory and a faster modem . Do you have a CD-ROM drive ? 
 Then you might want to add a CD-ROM drive too , because most new software programs are coming out on Cds . 
 Hoo , I'm getting tired , Jeanine , been a long day . 
 Yeah , I know . Shop till you drop . 
 I'm getting a little short on cash . Let's just window shop a little . 
 Hey , Jeanine , get a load of that . It's beautiful . 
 You know .. I have a weakness for long dresses . 
 Sure does . Hey , can I sponge a little cash of you ? 
 Thanks , Jeanine , you are a real pal . Let's go in . 
 Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know . Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more . 
 But don't you like this place ? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely . 
 Oh , why didn't you say so then ? But I still think we've made a good buy . 
 Well , going to a cinema , visiting the galleries , exhibitions and museums , finding and meeting old friends , exercising in the health club or mountain biking . There are so many good choices . 
 Why not start with the most interesting one ? 
 Toss a coin to decide then . 
 I'm not sure about that . How would people get to work ? 
 Well , it may not be that simple . Not everyone likes public transport . 
 Well , I don't often use them , I wouldn't really know . 
 It is very hard , you know . 
 Good luck ! 
 No comment . 
 Yes , it is . May I help you ? 
 What date , sir ? 
 Let me see . Yes , we still have some tickets left . Which performance ? 
 OK , we have tickets at 100 yuan and 50 yuan . 
 All right . May I have you name , please ? 
 When would you like to collect the tickets ? 
 We can hold them until one day before the show . 
 Just telephone us , and let us know in advance . We don't charge for cancellation . 
 You are welcome . Goodbye . 
 Is that right ? I didn't know it . 
 Will you forgive me . Could you return my camera ? 
 Oh , I see . Then , can I buy slides and picture postcards somewhere ? 
 Mary , I've some bad news for you . 
 Yes . The board was favorably impressed with your application , but the competition was very fierce . 
 I'm afraid I can't I advise you to try again next year . 
 How can I lose weight , doctor ? I seem to get fatter even when I just look at food ? 
 I never eat breakfast though . 
 I never thought about it that way . 
 Oh doctor , I feel so foolish . 
 I know doctor , thank you so much . 
 I should say , a a ' set ' of golf clubs is restricted to no more than 14 clubs . 
 In general , a set of golf clubs 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , PW ; Woods : 1 , 3 , 5 and a putter . 
 This is not to say you have to carry all of these clubs . It depends on your preferences . 
 Of course even people who don't know anything about golf know his name . 
 Yes . 
 No , what ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 Crikey . Where did this happen ? 
 Oh , right , I hear they have a lot of this kind of problem down there . 
 So what happened ? 
 That's terrible . 
 So what happened next ? 
 Well , he sure was lucky . 
 Are you a newcomer ? 
 You speak good English , though . 
 But let me tell you , you're doing just fine . I couldn't do half as well as you do when I was learning German . By the way , how long have you been learning English ? 
 Do you still see the people we went to school with ? 
 Yeah , I've lost touch with most people as well , but I still see Rose occasionally . 
 OK , I suppose , but she's had a rough time in the last few years , She got divorced . 
 Oh , of course . 
 Unbelievable ! I remember her husband is her former classmate . They fell in love with each other in college . 
 At last ! The weekend comes again ! 
 After five days ' hard work , I'm surely going to have some fun . 
 Bill , I must tell you the truth . You failed the English exam again . 
 Haha . April Fool's ! Did you forget what day it is today ? 
 Alright , now let's be serious . Actually , you get high marks in the exam . 
 Yes and no . 
 I'm doing great . 
 I saw Forrest Gump the other day . 
 The movie type is drama . 
 I hate the hot weather . I'd rather stay indoors with the air conditioner . 
 I like to play computer games , read books , go shopping , and play pool . 
 My favorite is to play computer games . 
 My favorite is Diablo . It used to be Star Craft , but it is getting a little old . 
 Although I hate to exercise , I go jogging at least twice a week . 
 I am going to go to the bookstore . 
 That sounds like fun . 
 Ok . See you later . 
 I'm glad you came . You're welcome anytime . 
 I will . See you later . 
 I ’ m glad you like them . Happy birthday ! 
 Forget it . It ’ s my pleasure . You mean a lot to me . 
 Shall we sing with a karaoke ? 
 For us , karaoke is becoming a popular entertainment . 
 I can not agree with you more . And if you are an awful one , that will be funny . 
 Is that true ? Shall we invite him to join with us ? 
 I'm afraid I can't complete my paper on time . 
 I keep on meeting with difficulties in the experiment . I can hardly go on . 
 Have you heard Jenny divorced her French husband ? 
 Yes . They used to be joined at the hip . 
 That ’ s true . She said they often argued over nickel-and-dime things . 
 You said it . You know , they fell in love at the first sight and quickly jumped into marriage . 
 Definitely . Just hope Jenny can recover from the pain of divorce soon . 
 I usually go to the supermarket , near the station . 
 I think they are quite reasonable , and the vegetables are very fresh . 
 Only 2 dollars and 25 cents . 
 I am looking for a host home . 
 Well , at least half a year . Do I have to do my own grocery shopping ? 
 That is fine . 
 Why do you say so ? 
 She has promised her mother that she would be with him through thick and thin . 
 Did you find what you were looking for ? 
 Okay , let's both look for it now . 
 I think I'm going to China this vacation.How about you ? 
 I went to France last summer . 
 Jenny , I was wondering if you , um ... are you busy this Friday ? 
 Oh . What about Saturday ? Are you free then ? 
 What about tonight ? Do you have plans tonight ? 
 Yes ! Yes ! I want to take you to dinner . 
 There's a typhoon coming . 
 That's what the weatherman said last night . 
 Sure . Have you got anywhere in mind ? 
 That Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . Do you want to go there ? 
 If you want spicy food , then I'd recommend going to a Thai , Indian or Chinese restaurant . How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road ? 
 You're right . Most of their dishes have sweet sauces . We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us . 
 The Taj it is then . 
 They'll still charge us a corkage fee . 
 Don't worry about money . I'll treat you tonight . 
 No , I'll pay . It's my turn anyway . You paid last time . 
 Hello Martin . Have you been to any events yet ? 
 Oh wow . How was it ? 
 Oh I still haven ’ t managed to get any tickets . I ’ d love to see something though . 
 What a great idea . 
 I know that . 
 Me too . I want to know more about you , eg , what's your real name and what do you look like ... 
 Look , I am playing the piano for you . 
 Sorry , I have no photo in my computer . And I have no scanner . I will show you later . 
 Ha ! She is too little . 
 I want to tell you that I like you 
 Thx . 
 Hi . 
 I'm good . How are you ? 
 A little . Are you American ? 
 Where are you from ? 
 Nice to meet you . 
 Did you hear what she said to me ? 
 What do you think I should do about it ? 
 How many persons are there in your family ? 
 Do you live together ? 
 Do you often go back to see your parents . 
 Ben always appears rude to the people around him . 
 That's true . We can not judge people by appearance . 
 I trust you ’ re keeping well ? 
 So we can get down to business . 
 Well , it's better than ' Friendship first , competition second ' . 
 I still think nobody plays for nothing . 
 Nine total . Seven children and my parents . 
 Well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . My father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it . 
 It can be hard , and there are certain sacrifices you have to make . 
 That's one . Another is the lack of personal property . Everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . Especially clothes . Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs . 
 Same problem here . There's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family . The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college . 
 I don't mind at all . 
 To tell you the truth , I'm not married . I'm still single . 
 I don't know.It ' s still up in tha air . 
 To study . I am going to the University of Tampa to do a postgraduate course for three years . 
 Yes , here it is . 
 I've got a letter from my bank here . It shows I am able to support myself during these three years of studies . 
 Yes , here it is . 
 Oh , but mine is a three-year program . 
 Okay , thank you . 
 It's beautiful . Enjoy it while it lasts . It's supposed to get cold tomorrow . 
 It's supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there's a chance of freezing rain . 
 Do you have any plans for tomorrow ? 
 You might want to change your plans . With the cold and wet weather that we're supposed to have tomorrow , the roads are going to be rather slippery . 
 I just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon . 
 If that happens , then I'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies . 
 Hey , look outside ! It's started to drizzle ! 
 Is there a city where it's always warm ? 
 Are there any other cities where it's always hot ? 
 But why do so many people live there ? 
 Are there any cities where it rains a lot ? 
 Tell us about some cold cities . 
 Is it always cold in Chicago and Boston ? 
 Mark , you are not telling me the truth . Now why ? 
 Yes , all right . So why ? Go on then . Say it . Oh , really , Mark . I promise I'm not going to be angry . Now why were you late ? 
 You forgot ? You ... 
 Long time no see ! 
 It's nice to see you again . Have you changed jobs ? 
 That's nice . Where have you been ? 
 Are you busy now ? 
 How about a coffee in that cafe ? 
 I'm really fed up with Larry ! He's the biggest airhead I've ever met.He always makes careless mistakes , and he's a pain to work with . 
 You only say that because you don't have to work with him.The people in your department seem so capable and nice to be around.Take Mary for example.She ' s smart and enthusiastic . I've never met anyone as cheery as she is . 
 Isn't there anyone in the office that is a perfect co-worker ? What about Bob ? Everybody loves Bob.Even though he's flesh out of college and still a bit green , he is a great co-worker . 
 Maybe that's why he's so nice ! 
 Yeah . I have got much pressure in the company . I have to be wrapped up in my work . 
 Thank you . I will . 
 Oh , I see.Thank you . 
 That's a great relief . I was worried about him . 
 His parents must feel very happy . 
 Yeah well it ’ s about time ! He ’ s been living with his parents for 40 years ! 
 Who are those kids walking down the aisle ? 
 I just hope the priest makes it quick . I ’ m starving . I hope the food ’ s good at the reception . 
 Oh great ! Does this mean that the reception is canceled ? 
 Cardiopulmonary resuscitation ! 
 What does that mean ? 
 Me ! Me ! 
 Wait , what are you doing ? I ’ m a married woman ! You can ’ t just try to kiss me like this ! 
 Well , OK . But no French kissing ! 
 Wait , what are you doing ! You can ’ t just kiss me then go for second base ! 
 Sure , what gives ? 
 On the level ? 
 That ’ s no laughing matter . That means she ’ ll have to take the whole course again . I can ’ t believe she ’ s going to have to start from the beginning . 
 This is my uncle , Charles . 
 He's a captain . 
 Exactly ! 
 It ’ s huge . 
 Yes , of course . 
 I really should be on my way . 
 No , thanks all the same . 
 Thank you very much . I really had a good time . 
 So see you . 
 Hi , how ’ re you doing ? 
 Oh , what ’ s the matter ? 
 Oh , that ’ s too bad . Why don ’ t you take some aspirin ? 
 Well , it ’ s necessary for you to see a doctor . 
 Well , you ’ d better get some rest . 
 Bye . 
 Darlene ! Indeed , it ’ s been a while ! How have you been ? Wow , you look amazing ! I love what you ’ Ve done with your hair ! 
 Ha ha , come on ! Well , I ’ Ve been watching what I eat , and working out three times a week . By the way , I heard your son recently graduated ! 
 He is such a handsome guy . He gets his looks from his mother of course ! 
 Oh yes . She had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel Mexico and we all attended . 
 But of course ! Well , it ’ s been great talking to you , but I have to get going . 
 That would be great ! Give me a call ! 
 I need help preparing for my presentation on Friday . 
 Are you sure you have the time ? 
 What would be the best time for you to help me ? 
 Should we just meet here ? 
 I'll see you then . 
 I'm so angry . I feel like killing someone . 
 Let me see . How much should I pay for you ? 
 No , this will not do . Let me see . 
 Good ideas . 
 Really ? Why ? 
 It's a pity that I was traveling around Europe at that time . 
 You're right ! I will call him this weekend and meet him . 
 Is she ? I thought she was a mathematician . 
 Are you ? I thought you had something to drink at her home . 
 I ’ ll buy you a drink . 
 How long will it take us to drive to London ? 
 That ’ s unless there is a traffic jam . It could take three hours . 
 So , shall we allow three hours to cover the distance ? 
 No . let me take a look ... It ’ s longer than my car . 
 Wow ! That ’ s fast ! I don ’ t think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway . 
 I ’ m Miss Sherman . What seems to be the problem ? 
 That ’ s true . For the Junior Executive Room ... three nights ... yes , your bill should be $ 1,500 
 The advertised rate is based on double occupancy . 
 Are you quite sure ? 
 I see . I had no idea our advertising was so misleading . It is here , but it ’ s in the fine print on the last page . 
 Normally I couldn ’ t do that . But under the circumstances , I ’ ll see what I can arrange.Customer satisfaction is our primary aim . 
 I wish I knew who had moved our flower pots . 
 What did you think you were doing ? 
 How dare you be so inconsiderate ? That's wrong . 
 Never do that again . 
 Is anything the matter , sir ? 
 What's wrong with it , sir ? 
 I am sorry you didn't enjoy it , sir . I will return it to the kitchen and bring you one that is well cooked . How is your steak this time , sir ? 
 I am glad you enjoy it . I will tell this to the chef . Would you like some more beer ? 
 Can I bring you some dessert ? 
 How about some coffee or tea then ? 
 Joanne , let ’ s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is , okay ? Let ’ s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly , so we can go our separate ways , alright ? 
 What was that ? 
 Let ’ s not go there , Joanne ! Ok , so let ’ s start with the record collection , I ’ ll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back . 
 I believe that was a wedding present to both of us , Joanne . And you hardly ever use it ! 
 Whatever ! Alright , I ’ ll concede the silly gramophone , if you ’ ll agree that I get the silver tea set . 
 Which ones ? Let me have a look.Wow , look at that ! That brings back memories ... That ? 
 ... and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet . I had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley , smiling and laughing in the rain ... 
 Oh , Joanne , are we making a big mistake ? I know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can ’ t reconcile and try again ? I still love you . 
 The motorcycle ? But that ’ s mine ! 
 Nothing . 
 Just get out of my face ! 
 Leave me alone ! 
 I don't want to talk about it . 
 I blew the finally exam . 
 No , I'm not . 
 Can I help you ? 
 These books over here are about ancient history . They might be helpful . 
 I ’ m sorry . It ’ s for reference only , so it must stay in the library . But you ’ re welcome to look through it . 
 All right . They ’ re due back next Wednesday . 
 Do you think you will ever work at that company again ? 
 Are there any seats left for Saturday night ? 
 I suppose there's nothing cheaper , is there ? 
 Hi , do you have any tickets for the show tonight ? 
 Well , do you have any for tomorrow ? 
 Ok . I ’ ll take it . 
 Do you have anything in the middle section ? I want a good view , but sitting too close hurts my eyes . 
 Jenny , I want to go on a picnic . Could you come too ? 
 Then , put on your casual clothes and pack some food and beverages . 
 Sure . Bring enough films , please . 
 You ’ re going to set up your own law office , aren ’ t you ? 
 If you need help , don ’ t hesitate to ask me . 
 I ’ d like to wish you every success in your new venture . 
 Good luck to you . 
 There are not so many people like you . 
 Can I help you ? 
 These books over here are about ancient history . They might be helpful . 
 I ’ m sorry . It ’ s for reference only , so it must stay in the library . But you ’ re welcome to look through it . 
 All right . They ’ re due back next Wednesday . 
 Do you have much experience with kids ? 
 To tell you the truth , sometimes I regret having a baby so early . I have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby . 
 What about your mother ? Did she help you ? 
 I see . So if my little family goes to America , I would end up taking care of my child all the time . My husband would have to make the bread for us . I just don ’ t know how I would get some education and be able to get a job some day . 
 Sounds not so easy to me . When that happens , I will be too old to learn . 
 Now I know why I split up with Mike . We found we were simply not good for each other . 
 Well , he is a typical Sagittarius guy , while I am a Cancer . We aren't really compatible 
 What's strange about that ! As a person born under the sign of Cancer , I am home-loving and wish for a peaceful family life . But according to astrology , Sagittarius guys are too adventurous and risk-taking.They seldom think of leading a settled and peaceful life . 
 But in my case , the fact matches the theory . Mike is humorous , energetic , always as fresh as a daisy , but probably too ambitious . It frightens me ! 
 Exactly . But later on , he cares more about his career than love . Work seems to be the better all , and all for him-so much that he doesn't even grudge sparing a day out with me . 
 He is a worker . 
 She is a nurse . 
 August 1st . 
 Yes , we do.My parents prepare dinner for me . 
 We sing " Happy Birthday " at the party and have birthday cakes . 
 Well , I don't know . 
 So the ' Happy Birthday ' song has been popular since then ? 
 Wow ! Look at all these books ! I bet I can find a book about anything here ! 
 Ok , I'm sorry . Are you the librarian ? Maybe you can help me , I am looking for a book . 
 I am looking for a book that has nursery rhymes . 
 Ok , I would like to check out these books . 
 No . How do I get one ? 
 Here you go . 
 Ok , thanks ! 
 Can I use my green pad again to write you admiring notes ? 
 You miss me , don't you ? 
 OK , I'm in . When do I start ? 
 Kim ! I'm here ! I brought all my old maternity clothes plus Dave and Alice's baby clothes ! 
 Believe me , the time will fly by ! Before you know it , you'll be changing diapers ! You have to start preparing ! 
 I'll be back tomorrow with my work clothes and a gallon of lavender paint ! You just sit back and relax ! 
 Give it to me . 
 It ’ s my acceptance letter from UCLA . 
 I ’ Ve been accepted ! 
 I ’ m serious . 
 NYU was my first choice , but UCLA is just fine . 
 Thanks . I ’ m proud of myself , too . 
 I'd prefer to go abroad , if possible . 
 I'm one of them . 
 How's it ? 
 I went shopping without my umbrella yesterday morning . 
 So did I . that's why I didn't take my umbrella . I got cold in the rain in the afternoon . It was raining cats and dogs . 
 We really have some movable weather sometime . I wish I would live somewhere which were sunning all year round . 
 I guess you are right . Maybe I just wish the weather could be a little more predictable . 
 Your garden is looking beautiful this summer . The flowers are really colorful . 
 Yes , I do . Those are violets , aren ’ t they ? 
 The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low . Would you like me to cut them off for you ? 
 When the lower branches are removed , you ’ ll be able to sit under the tree . 
 Just make sure children don ’ t play in the flower beds and destroy the flowers . 
 I know I'm late . I'm sorry . I tried to call you to tell you , but your phone seems to be disconnected . 
 Yes . An automatic message says your phone is not in service . 
 So I couldn't get through . I knew I'd be late because my car wouldn't start.It was too cold I had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . That's why I'm late . 
 About what ? 
 Well , the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast . 
 No . I hate cell phones.But you could go to a neighbor's house and use their phone . 
 Yes , of course I can drive you.So you don't want to get your phone fixed right away ? 
 Alright , let's go . 
 Linda , would you care for some candies or cookies ? 
 You are not really chubby . You are actually thin enough . 
 So you are watching your weight , aren't you ? 
 I've come to say goodbye . 
 I'm catching the 11:00 train . 
 Goodbye . Hope to see you again next year . 
 Why ? I'd like to see what's on that channel . 
 I prefer boxing to beef . 
 It seems that he has gone ape over the girl . 
 Yes , he ’ s been like this for two weeks . We don ’ t know what to do . 
 Yeah . But he just didn ’ t listen . 
 Oh , yes . It's a great party . There are some people I don't know , though . 
 That would be great . 
 Yes . I like it very much . 
 It's excellent . 
 It's delicious . 
 I like beefsteak very much . Have you tried Chinese dishes ? 
 Well , it's getting late . I have to get up early tomorrow . So I must say good night . 
 I am not sure how to add a class . 
 I'll bring one next time . 
 I think I know where it is . 
 Thank you for your directions . It's clear . 
 That's great . Thank you so much . 
 Is the environment a big issues in your country ? It is in mine . 
 What methods do you use to conserve water ? 
 I see . I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution . 
 We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced . 
 I think you ’ re right . There needs to be an international response to this problem . 
 Thank you . It's a pleasure to meet you . 
 Thank you , they are beautiful . 
 is it a horror movie ? 
 no way . I will be scared out of my wits . 
 Hey , how could you like to taste my fist ? 
 Um , let me see , romance , comedy . documentary , action , science fiction , animated and so on . 
 yeah . It seems like we don't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned . 
 the Notebook is this type of movie . 
 well then , this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together . I bet you'd love it . 
 Good evening.Welcome to our program . 
 Would you tell us your name , please ? 
 Glad to meet you , Ms.Baker . 
 Where are you from , Ms.Baker ? 
 What do you do for a living ? 
 Thank you for coming , Ms.baker . 
 Thanks ! We love it . 
 I'm just not looking forward to cleaning it ! 
 Joe ? I don't know what you mean . 
 Oh , I took a shine to him when we met for the first time . But it comes and goes . 
 Looks like a good party , I probably know about half the people . 
 Where ? 
 I don ’ t know . Never saw him before . Why ? 
 All the soldiers in that country are armed to the teeth . 
 The neighboring country is threatening their sovereignty with its nuclear bombs . 
 I think it ’ s my ankle . 
 One of my snow-shoes that cause on rocks . 
 I don ’ t think so . It ’ s kind of sore . 
 It ’ s that really necessary ? 
 What a brilliant smile ! 
 He must be very easy-going . 
 Which season do you like best ? 
 I prefer summer , especially the summer evenings . When the sun comes down , it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . After a rain shower , the smell of the air is refreshing . It is also a best reason for ice-cream . 
 Well , I have to hide in the air-conditioned rooms . Anyway , it is all worth , just think about the cool evening time . 
 I have no idea . 
 Really ? When did that happen ? 
 Have they set a date for the wedding ? 
 Hello , Mary . How are you ? 
 Fine . Thank you . 
 On 20th May 1963 . 
 27th day of the fourth month . 
 It will begin at 5:30 . 
 You can see it tomorrow . 
 When the rain stops , you ’ ll see how beautiful the beach is . 
 And this bedroom is too big and damp . But it ’ s better than a tent . 
 Hi , Sue . What's up ? 
 Ok , I guess . My boss has been on my back recently . 
 You know , just giving me lots to do . I'm really busy right now . 
 Oh , lots of things . Mostly training new people . 
 Stolen ? No , why ? 
 Criminals are clever ? They ’ re only successful when people are careless . 
 If your uncle had an alarm system , then it wouldn ’ t have happened . 
 Didn ’ t anyone stop them ? 
 Wow , they were good . I guess criminals aren ’ t that dumb after all . 
 Would you and your wife care to come to our place and have tea with us some afternoon ? 
 How about tomorrow afternoon ? 
 A friend of mine has been taking an online career planning course these days . He told me the other day he has learned a lot from it . He recommended me to subscribe to it . What do you say ? 
 Well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals . 
 Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . It seems that you need this course more than I do . I love my current job . If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance . 
 Would you like any toast , dear ? 
 Toast , dear ? 
 Would you like any tea , dear ? 
 Oh , you ’ re not listening to me . 
 May I help you ? 
 The copier is right over there , in the corner . 
 You have to pay to use the copier . 
 You need to pay ten cents for every copy . 
 You can make as many copies as you want . 
 There are instructions posted on the copier . 
 You seem to be very tired . 
 Why don't you join us to go out for a walk ? 
 Simon , may I introduce you to Linda ? You don ’ t know each other , do you ? 
 How do you do ? I ’ m pleased to meet you . 
 Please sit down . Help yourself just like you are at home . 
 A cup of coffee , please . 
 I'm having a great time . I love it . I'm glad we came . 
 I love the museums , too . 
 Yeah . I hate all this traffic . It's really noisy . 
 I can't stand making decisions . You choose ! 
 I have been very busy this year , working late , often taking work home and taking no vacation . I feel exhausted . 
 You are right . For the past few weeks , I had no appetite and couldn ’ t sleep well . What ’ s worse my back started aching this Monday . It is time for me to take a vacation . 
 It's a surprise ! 
 Yes . Let's go inside and you can open it up . 
 I'll give you two clues . First , it cost more than $ 250 . And second , it's not big , but fat . 
 What would you like to drink ? 
 You seem depressed these days . What's the matter ? 
 If I can do anything for you , don't hesitate to let me know . 
 Good luck . I've got class in a few minutes . 
 OK . See you later . 
 Great . My family came to visit me . 
 My immediate family is very large . It's my mother , my father , my two older brothers , my younger sister and me . 
 I thought you were the only child in the family . Didn't China practice the only-child policy in the early 1980s ? 
 Interesting . What do you think about families with only one child ? 
 Do you get along well with each other ? 
 You are very lucky to have such a nice family . 
 Don't you think it might be a good idea to hold the party outside ? 
 How about going to a concert ? 
 Every year , the South has the floods . It is an act of God . 
 Yeah , you have some other ideas ? 
 For example ? 
 Oh , I see . Fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things . 
 Good morning , John ! 
 I'd be delighted to , John . Saturday did you say ? 
 I'm pretty sure I'll be all right . In fact , I'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you.What time are you planning to start ? 
 That sounds fine . I'll be there around seven . 
 Wait , Jimmy , it ’ s cold outside . Put a hat on ! 
 No , wait , you will be too cold without mittens . 
 Hold on , with that wind , you ’ re going to catch a cold . Wear this scarf . 
 Oh ... and ear muffs ! Put these on ... here we go . 
 Yes , honey ... 
 Jane , pleases come with us . 
 Just for fun , not for showing . What do you worry about ? 
 But ... OK . 
 I don't have one single favorite , but these days I listen to a lot of Chopin . 
 Without doubt , rock is trash . 
 Yeah , and most excitingly , I met the girl living under me today . She's really nice . 
 Yeah , and most importantly , she's single ! Man , I could tell from the moment I saw her , she's the girl of my dreams ! 
 I don't know . I am not really worried about that . I don't wanna lose before even starting . Besides I think the other two American guys have also fallen for her . 
 Not yet . But I am thinking of inviting her to dinner sometime . I know some good restaurants nearby . 
 You bet . Now that you mentioned it , I think I'll call her now and see if she is available tonight . 
 Thanks ! 
 It's a chance in a million . I hear John is interested in it . 
 But anyway , I'll have a try . 
 Well , it ’ s hard to say . I coughed a lot in the evening . 
 You ’ re right . But you know it ’ s so hard to give up the old habit like smoking . 
 You know I often have to work far into the night . I need smoking to keep me awake . 
 Thank you for your advice . I ’ ll try it . 
 What fools we were ! 
 And my new car . To think that he simply drove off with everything in my car . That's what hurts me most . 
 I hardly dare call the police . They'll just laugh at us . 
 And his story didn't even hold together . I feel such an idiot . 
 David took me to it last week . I thought it was a little sick . 
 It was entertaining in some ways . But in general I didn't like it . 
 I just think the humor was too gross . There were too many disgusting things in it . I don't think a comedy has to have so much smut to be funny . 
 No , you're right . But nudity doesn't bother me . What bothered me were all the jokes about masturbation , stuff like that . It was too sick . 
 I don't think it's realistic . I thought it was sick . Why does a movie have to use that kind of humor ? 
 Do you know how to go to the Fragrant Hills in Beijing ? I heard that they are very famous in China . 
 That must be very beautiful . 
 Really ? Have you ever been there ? 
 Can you go there with me ? I'd like someone who is familiar with that area to go with me . 
 Have you heard that Tom and his wife divorced ? 
 Really ? Say it ! 
 Yeah , quite right . Gambling broke up a happy family . 
 Besides that , many people took to gambling and got in over their heads , and gradually ruined themselves . 
 Professor , could I make an appointment with you ? 
 Two o'clock would be the best time . 
 No , I'm not sure . 
 I see . 
 I'll see you then . 
 Have you gone bowling before ? 
 There are 10 frames in a bowling game . Each player is allowed to bowl two balls in each frame . 
 ' Round ' and ' frame ' are two different terms . 
 Hey , slow down . I'll tell you more while playing . 
 Yeah , it'll make a hit , I think.When will it be on , do you know ? 
 Hectic . It's always hectic . But how was your windsurfing ? 
 See ? I told you . It's very hard . 
 Fifty times ? 
 And how much did it cost to rent it ? 
 Well , that's not too bad then . 
 Yes , but you have to calculate a little.You paid fifty dollars and you fell down fifty times.So you only spent one dollar per fall . That's cheap . 
 We broke up . 
 Oh , not too bad . I'm just glad the weekend's finally here . 
 Give me a screwdriver on the rocks . 
 Thanks . 
 I apologize . This should not have to be this way . 
 Of course , I should have been more careful . I ’ m sorry . 
 Well , I just came in . I worked overtime yesterday . Some statistics and very important documents seemed to be inaccurate . So I stayed to double check them . The boss was aware of my very late work of last night . So before he left office , he told me I could come one hour later this morning . 
 It was around one thirty in the morning . I guess I didn ’ t fall asleep till 3 because those numbers were involving in my mind . I just couldn ’ t stop thinking about them . 
 Working at weekend is something I hate to do most . 
 Hi ! It's still seven o'clock . Are you crazy ? 
 Every time when you glimpse some stylish clothes , you change into another person . 
 No wonder you are named shopaholic . 
 Wait a moment . And you can check where other sales are . 
 I was wondering if you could company me to the Ball ? 
 That's great . I'll pick you up at eight . 
 You ’ d better change it . It ’ s ugly . 
 It ’ s really elegant and it fits you really well . 
 My mother is a professor and my father is a manager . 
 No , usually they're very busy . 
 Of course . 
 Things were different this time . I sat by a math genius . 
 B :: Come on ! I just took a glance . 
 I can't decide whether to go to university or to get a job . 
 But I don't even know what to study . 
 That's what my parents want me to do . 
 But if you go to university , you'll still have time for fun . 
 And if you try to find a part-time job , you'll have some money too . 
 Well , I can ’ t believe your uncle and aunt came to stay with us for a week , and they did not even call us in advance . 
 I know , but it is hard for me to get used to your relatives coming to visit us , and without warning . 
 Yes , but Americans never visit without calling in advance , and they almost never stay overnight . 
 I think you ’ re right ! 
 Sure . How do you like your seats ? 
 Ok , here are your tickets in Row 13 . 
 That's fine . But you have to pay another $ 10 . 
 No , it isn't mine . I blundered upon it under the sofa . Do you know whose watch it is ? 
 Well , here you are . Remember to put it in a proper place . 
 We are playing against Hainan . 
 Sure they are . 
 We are , 27 to 26 . 
 How can it be ? We are a tough team as well . 
 Yes , I ’ m afraid I am . My husband is a smoker too . 
 No . But my husband smokes 20 or more a day . 
 I had my first cigarette when I was 17 . 
 Yes . Twice . 
 Can ’ t be better , it was wonderful . We had a lot of fun there . There was so much joy and walk and breathe the winter air . We arrived at the park at 9 o ’ clock in the morning and didn ’ t leave till 3 o ’ clock in the afternoon . 
 Of course not ! We built a snowman , some snow dogs and one big snow fort . We went sliding on the nice hill . It was a real work out . At noon , we had the most special winter picnic outside . Fortunately , we got it all on a video tape . You must come with us next time . I bet you will love it . 
 You know them ? 
 Here we are , Ryan ! This is where we're going to celebrate ! 
 You won't need it . Stanley , my best man , is going to treat everybody ! 
 If it were up to Stanley , we'd have the wedding in the ETV ! He loves to sing . 
 Well , uh , I'll let you decide that for yourself . He'll be here a little later . Here's our room ! 
 You , too . Where did you get your new hat ? 
 Yes . It's a birthday present from my husband ! 
 He'll come out with surprises . Just wait and see . Look at that woman , with the white chiffon ! 
 Yes . I like the dress . It must be the latest fashion . Look , the hem has lowered , and the waist narrowed . 
 Yes . She dressed with an individual flair . I rather envy her . 
 I quite agree with you.See the woman there ? I dare say she hasn't got any eyes . How could she match the mauve gown with the green handbag ? And all that jewelry ! 
 So what ? It only makes her look cheap and vulgar . 
 You're quite slim . In fact , if you were one of those starlets , the movie company would say you have a fabulous figure . 
 Oh , my shoes pinch me . Let's find a seat and sit a while . 
 Hey , watch where you ’ re going ! 
 Oh ... I don ’ t know . 
 Oh , wait a second , you seem really familiar , I think I know you from somewhere . 
 Ouch ! My ankle ! I think it ’ s broken ! You can ’ t just leave me like this ! Are you calling an ambulance ? 
 Hello , james . Come in . go through to the living room . 
 I told you that I had been saving up money to buy some new furniture and do some redecorating . I finally saved enough and did everything at once . 
 Do you like my carpet ? Be honest ! Tell me what you really think . 
 Well spotted ! I actually had it cleaned twice , because it was so dirty . The rug is new . You remember my trip to china ? Well , I bought is there . 
 A gang of bastards are wildly shooting on the next street . We must leave this place the soonest . 
 Stop your nonsense ! Quick . Let ’ s leave the place ! 
 And a typical example has been the Chinese athletes at the Beijing Olympics , right ? 
 Then what are the Westerners fit for ? 
 Where do you think the edge is for black athletes ? 
 I got you . Their competitive edge lies mainly in endurance and stamina . They are creatures from the savannah , and take to running like antelopes . 
 Sure.He has already married , a father of two boys . 
 He took the picture when he was only 21 years old . 
 We seem to be lost here . 
 I suggest that we go and ask for help from the policeman . 
 It's crunch time , isn't it ? I wasn't nervous before the meeting , but now I am . 
 It would help to bring in a couple more troubleshooters . 
 Do you think we'll make it ? 
 Here is the song list . 
 Yes , here you are . 
 Let me play it for you . 
 It's very easy . Here it is . Ready ? Excellent ! You are a good singer . You sing the bass so well . 
 I'll sing a Chinese folk song Love song of Hanging , first in Chinese then in English . 
 What ’ s the plot of your new movie ? 
 Did you enjoy making the movie ? We heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director . 
 Critics are not very happy with the movies that you ’ Ve made recently . Does that bother you ? 
 Did you do you own stunts in the movie ? 
 Thank you very much for doing this interview . 
 Yes . I have . I liked it very much . Like you , I was very impressed with Rachel ’ s performance in the movie . She ’ s going to be a star . 
 That's disappointing . I was really looking forward to it . 
 That would be great . Actually , can I get your phone number , Ella ? That's assuming you don't mind if I call you sometime . 
 Ok , got it . I will call you sometime next week . 
 It's time to go . Bye , Ella . Hope to see you soon . 
 Do you mind if I ask you to practice speaking English with me ? 
 Well , I'm meeting some American friends next weekend . 
 have you ever thought about your ideal home ? 
 what would it be like ? 
 how many rooms would it have ? 
 how many bedrooms would your dream home have ? 
 how would you decorate your house ? 
 how many TVs would your dream home have ? 
 Have you ever made any plan for your future ? 
 Not me . I'd like to be a bachelor forever . 
 The Mountains would be a great place for the company retreat . 
 I have chosen January as the month for this retreat . 
 Yes , maybe another choice might be better . 
 Thank you for thinking of that . 
 That is a good idea . 
 Susan has got married . 
 Her marriage was a hole and corner affair . 
 I have no idea . Maybe she didn ’ t want to let us ... , so ... 
 Does that mean you're going to take my advice ? 
 I might be able to help ... 
 We'd like to open another restaurant ... with you as the head chef and manager ... 
 Yes . But you know him . He's just worried that you're not Italian ... 
 No . He's afraid that no one will cook as good as his mother did . 
 How's that ? 
 I just got sacked . 
 What do you do in your spare time ? 
 What kind of music do you like ? 
 Actually me , too . 
 Pretty good , Sam . Only the awful weather , you know . 
 Me either , but I ’ m dealing with it anyway . 
 I ’ m here as a tourist . 
 Yes , it ’ s a small world . We never know where we ’ ll meet someone we know . 
 No , you can't , darling . The grass is wet . 
 No , you can't . The bench is wet , too . 
 Can't you see a notice on the bench ? 
 What does the notice say ? 
 Do you have any year-end benefits ? 
 I just saw a piece of news , that a group of white color workers hold a flour war in the office because of dissatisfaction of the year-end benefits . 
 They got rice , flour and oil as presents , while the leadership got 1000 yuan shopping card . 
 It is said that the presents they got value less than 200 yuan , and it is no use for them at all , because they don't cook by themselves . 
 Now , David , can I get you a drink ? What will you have ? 
 What about you , Mary ? 
 Hey ! I have a surprise for you . 
 Open this card and read . 
 Have you heard we'll have a pay rise ? 
 It's a pity , but why ? 
 Shall we go for a drive today ? 
 Maybe you're right . 
 How do you like this waltz ? 
 Well , then , may I invite you for the first dance ? 
 Me ? Oh , no . In fact , I only took up dancing quite recently . 
 I'm glad you say so . You dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got you as a partner . 
 Yes . And what dances do you like best ? 
 Oh , well , the music has stopped . Thank you for the dance . 
 Are you sure it was him ? 
 You're a nurse at New York General Hospital ? 
 Maybe he was just visiting someone . 
 Jason , it's your turn . 
 You rolled a four . Let's see ... you landed on Foreign Films . 
 Well , too bad . So , what foreign film won an Oscar in 1993 ? 
 The answer is Belle Opaque . It's a Spanish movie , and the title means The Age of Beauty in English . 
 Take care , sonny ! 
 Bye ! 
 Over here , Betty ! 
 Haha . Don ’ t worry , Betty . So tell me , what ’ s the latest gossip ? Unless you want to keep it to yourself . 
 No kidding ! What happened to Ad ? 
 Was , talk about a double whammy . 
 Oh , right . What a load off my mind . I really don ’ t like her . 
 Thanks for the visit , Betty . 
 I think we have a while longer . 
 That's true . 
 I don't know . 
 I wasn't really paying attention . I think we missed our stop . 
 Yeah , we definitely missed our stop . 
 My bad.sorry ! 
 Oh , no ! How did this happen . Are you sure ? 
 My God ! I actually checked them one by one . How could this be ? 
 What kind of solution can I have now ? I nearly go crazy now . 
 It seems that I have nothing to do , except this . 
 Then I'll have to borrow it . 
 Why ? It's in mint condition ! 
 You're going to re-sell it on eBay Taiwan ? 
 I've created a monster ... you're a better bayer than me ! 
 Yes , of course . I am calling to apply for a job as an accountant . 
 Sure . The main courses I took included commercial accounting , cost accounting , industrial accounting , electronic accounting , and so on . 
 Certainly . 
 No.sir . If only you check out before 15:00 
 There's going to be a highway here . 
 The traffic problem will soon be eased . 
 Excuse me , sir ? 
 I'm afraid you can't smoke here . 
 Can't you see the notes here ? 
 It says ' No smoking ' . 
 Fred , have you made the plan for April 28th ? 
 You go ! 
 Is there anything after the meeting ? In that case , would you add one plan ? I want to visit our guest Mr . Ross after the meeting . Can you arrange it for me ? 
 All right , roast beef , please.And I'd like to start with soup . 
 Clear soup , please . 
 The northern line is what you want . 
 It ’ s two yuan . 
 Just go through the number eight to ticket barrier over there . A train will be in directly . 
 That ’ s all right . 
 Oh , that ’ s easy . Go to yahoo.com . Now , click on the link with the picture of an envelope .

 Do you mean the red flowers ? They are peony flowers ? 
 Yes , you like them very much . right ? 
 I can help you with it 
 Good evening , Mr . Frank . Bourbon on the rocks ? 
 What about Mao Tai , one of the most famous liquors in China ? It's good indeed . It never goes to the head . 
 Some do , some don't . Many people in the North are fond of liquors . I think it has something to do with the climate . 
 Yes , it's a very well-known kind of spirits in Mexico . People drink it with salt and lemon . 
 Yes , besides Mao Tai , we have Wu Liang Ye , Fen Jim and so on . 
 It's rice wine , a kind of still wine , somewhat like Japanese Sake . Showing is a city in China . 
 By the way , we also have some good red wine and white wine , such as Great Wall White Wine . 
 I'm always at your service . 
 I'm sorry but we are fully booked . 
 That's fine , but we have only a single room , is that OK ? 
 Hello , this is Francis from XYZ Company . I would like to discuss with you about a new project some time next week . Do you have time to meet ? 
 Ok . 
 It is ok with me . So I will be arriving at your office around two fifteen PM . 
 A woman after my own heart ... 
 Well , step two is grinding the coffee beans . I've roasted three different types of beans . 
 Yep , my own special blend ! You can tell by just smelling them ? 
 Morning , Mom . 
 No , I'm fine . I don't need to see a doctor . 
 OK . I'll go see the doctor . 
 Chicken soup again ? 
 Would you please make a skirt for me with this material please ? 
 I like miniskirt . 
 When can I get it ? 
 Thank you , see you then . 
 Hey , Jim . Wake up ! 
 You'd better get up or you'll be late . 
 Yes , It has . It went off 30 minutes ago . 
 Rise and shine , sleepyhead . 
 May I have my bill , please ? 
 Well , I am afraid you have made a mistake . Would you check it again , please ? 
 It doesn't matter . 
 Well first put your money in . 
 Then just press this button . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 We'd like to sign a year-long contract , if that's OK . 
 Yes . We've signed them before . We even brought our chops . 
 We'll sign our signatures , too . And give you our passport numbers along with our ARC numbers . 
 After probation , you'll find that our silk products feels more comfortable than others . 
 It's selling like hot cakes , and we have lots of regulars now . Would you like to place a trial order ? 
 Yes , we have the free samples for customers . And you can have a try . 
 Please wait a moment and fill out the order form . And we'll send you our sample . 
 Is this watch yours ? 
 Let me have a look . It's mine . I have been looking for it , but just cannot find it . It's present from my father . 
 What would you like for your main course ? 
 How would you like your steak ? Rare , medium-rare or well-done ? 
 Shall we have some soup first ? 
 Ok , and what about the main course ? Which would you rather have fish or meat ? 
 Don't you like fish then ? 
 Shall we have some white wine then ? 
 What would you like for dessert ? 
 Fine , and after dinner , shall we go to a disco ? 
 I'm calling to ask about your apartment you advertised . 
 That sounds fantastic ! But I am looking for something closer to downtown , as I spend most of my time at the office . 
 I'm sure they are wonderful , but I need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost . 
 Great ! I'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . Could you tell me the detailed dress ? 
 OK . Thank you . 
 You mean a murder cycle ? Did you know more cyclists die in accidents than motorists ? 
 I'll tell you what . You can get a motorcycle on one condition . 
 You spend two weeks with dad in his ambulance as an EMT trainee and volunteer at the emergency room for one month . 
 After that , we'll let you decide if you still want a murder , I mean motorcycle . 
 I'm fine , thanks . And you ? 
 Oh , nothing much really . And how is everything with you ? 
 What have you been doing ? 
 Really ? Good luck for them . 
 They're both very well , thanks . 
 I'm going to do some shopping . Why don't you come with me ? 
 It's been nice talking to you . 
 Good morning . I'd like to check out right now . 
 Room 103 . 
 Yes.Wang Bin . 
 No . 
 No , I have not . 
 All right . Can I pay with credit cards ? 
 American Express . 
 Oh , my god . I am so heavy now . I gain 10 kilos . 
 I think I should go . I really need to lose some weight . 
 0K.See you then . 
 Nope , I do not have a membership yet . 
 That is so nice of you . If I like the service and the training equipment , I think I well join the club . 
 Sure , I advise the sightseeing buses . 
 Yes of course.You can see the whole city on the bus . It's cheap as well as efficient . 
 I'm so hungry . Shall we go eat now , Rick ? 
 how about some dumplings ? I just can't get enough of them . 
 well , what do you have in mind ? 
 oh , it's too spicy for me . Don't you remember last time when I tasted the lamb ? It was so spicy my eyes teared up ! 
 sounds great . Do they serve noodles ? I am in the mood for some tasty noodles as well . 
 great . Let's go ! 
 Good morning . Could I speak to Frans Smith please ? 
 Is this Taiwan 8234342 2 , DS engineering ? 
 The accounts department , I think . 
 What do you want to do in this company after five years ? 
 Why do you think so ? 
 What are you looking for in your next job ? 
 What is your career objective ? 
 What do you consider important when looking for a job ? 
 Hey ! Ask your mom for more old pictures , OK ? 
 But we saved your parents so much money ... 
 Speaking of plane tickets , don't forget to check on the reservations ! 
 How much will it be all together ? 
 Can I pay by check ? 
 OK . How about this card then ? 
 Excuse me . My bag was stolen , will you help me ? 
 Just about half an hour ago . 
 Yes , it was just when I was walking in the park . I saw some children with a newspaper . 
 I want to get in touch with the Chinese Embassy because my passport was in the stolen bag . 
 Because the job I am doing in my present company is of no challenge , but I like challenge.Your firm is a young organisation with many innovative ideas . It has been very successful in an expanding market since its establishment 10 years ago . Working for you would be exactly the sort of challenge I am looking for . 
 I have excellent communication skills and I am familiar with the procedures for the last company I worked for . Besides , I am a team player and have great interpersonal skills . 
 Well , first of all , it ’ s much bigger . It has the same number of rooms , but each room is larger . We also have a larger garden , which our dog loves , of course ! 
 Yes . One bedroom is for my wife and I . there ’ s another for our daughter . My wife wants to use the third one as a guest room , but I ’ d like to make it into a study . Our daughter is also keen on making it a study , so that ’ s probably what will happen . 
 That ’ s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . The kitchen and dining room are together . It ’ s really large . 
 Yes , they are . That ’ s very important to us . We like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . Each room has large windows . 
 No , we don ’ t . We wish we had one . That ’ s the only thing we wanted , but don ’ t have . The area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly . 
 It ’ s a very quiet neighbourhood . There ’ s some traffic , but not much . It ’ s not very difficult to get to the city centre , but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or you ’ ll get lost . So when are you going to drop by ? 
 All right . I'm nearly ready . What time does the bus leave ? 
 Oh , we've got plenty of time . 
 All right . Let's go . 
 I'd like to remit 5000 dollars to my friend . 
 Room 20 , Suzie Building , Beijing Road , Shenzhen , China . 
 Would it be all right if I went home next weekend ? 
 Well , I want to surprise my brother showing up for his birthday . 
 Which kinds of meat are most popular in your country ? 
 Yes , we do . We also eat a lot of lamb . 
 That ’ s right . They tastes so good ! We eat them with mint sauce . Have you every tried them ? 
 I certainly can . If I can get some from the butcher ’ s , I ’ ll cook them for you . 
 Do you have any idea what time it is ? 
 Do you really think that that excuses your tardiness ? 
 Didn't I tell you to call when you're running late ? 
 It doesn't matter , you should have called and let me know . 
 If you do this again , don't even bother coming home . 
 Exactly , maybe that'll teach you to respect my rules . 
 And so , that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next year . Thank you very much for your time . 
 Aw , come on ; it was nothing . I'm just doing my job . 
 Well , Kristin did give me a hand with the slides.She ' s a real wiz on PowerPoint . 
 Yeah , well , that was some good advice . You made some really good points . 
 As you know I ’ Ve been thinking about moving my career in a new direction . I am hoping that you will be able to provide me with a reference to help me jump-start my future . 
 Thank you . I ’ Ve really enjoyed my time here . I've grown both personally and professionally with this company . 
 It will be hard to say good-bye . This office has become like a second home to me . 
 Well , Peter , you have to do better than that next time , won ’ t you ? 
 Of course , you have . You must try harder this time . 
 No , you needn ’ t do that . You ’ d better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes . 
 You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ’ t have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study . 
 Who knows ! That might come to later . 
 It's easy grandpa . Insert you card into the machine here . Then wait a moment . Ok . Now you enter your PIN . It should have four numbers . 
 You really shouldn ’ t write it down . You should memorize it . You can change it to a more convenient number if you like . 
 Yes . Choose the service you need to use . If you choose to withdraw money , the machine will ask you how much you want . 
 That's right . Give the machine a moment to process you request . Then take your money . 
 How can I lose weight , doctor ? I seem to get fatter even when I just look at food ? 
 I never eat breakfast though . 
 I never thought about it that way . 
 Oh doctor , I feel so foolish . 
 I know doctor , thank you so much . 
 Hi , this is Monica . I was wondering when we can work on this financial report . 
 Shall I see you on Friday morning ? 
 We must find some time to read report . 
 That ’ s all right . Then see you on Friday afternoon . 
 Shall I take a photo of you ? 
 You ’ re welcome . What brings you to China ? 
 I see and what do you do for a living ? 
 That sounds like a good job . 
 Ok , well enjoy the rest of your stay here . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 For whom ? 
 What symptoms does he have ? 
 I got it . Don't worry , just a common cold . 
 Patulin will do . 
 Six per day , and two after each meal . 
 My pleasure . 
 This is the right place . Please join us . 
 We are all going to have great interviews . What are some things that we need to remember in an interview ? 
 Right , and what about our friendliness and attitude ? 
 Did you know that they pay as much attention to what you ask as to what you say in an interview ? 
 Just relax , listen carefully to the questions , and be honest in your responses . 
 Yes , he has . He sold it last week . 
 No , not yet . He's still here . He's going to move tomorrow . 
 No . Tomorrow afternoon . I'll miss him . He has always been a good neighbour . 
 When will the new people move into this house ? 
 Will you see Mien today , Janey ? 
 Please give him my regards . Poor Mien ! He didn't want to leave this house . 
 Being a diabetic , you're not allowed to eat certain foods . 
 I'm afraid not . 
 Good evening , can I get you a drink ? 
 Would you like to order anything off the appetizer menu ? 
 Would you like to order anything else ? 
 No problem , call me when you're ready to place the rest of your order . 
 What did you want to order ? 
 Can I get you anything else ? 
 This skirt is too tight . I would like to return it please . Do I need to go to the customer's service desk ? 
 No , I receive this as a birthday present , but the price tag is still on the skirt though . Will that be OK ? 
 Do you have any more skirts in this style ? I would like to find a size larger . 
 No , that's all right . I'll just look for something else . 
 Isn't it a nice day ? 
 It seems that it may rain today . 
 How come ? 
 I feel the same way . It smells so good after it rains . 
 Really ? Why ? 
 I really want it to rain today . 
 Boy , come here ! 
 Bring me a cup of coffee , please . 
 I prefer strong . 
 What's the matter with it ? 
 How about the tires ? 
 I can ’ t decide what to do today . 
 Don ’ t you think it ’ s a bit cold for that ? 
 Excuse me ! Are you Bart Simpson from Western Electronics ? 
 I am Steven . I am here to meet you . 
 You must be tired after the long flight . Let me carry the bags for you . 
 Our car is in the parking lot . We've booked a room for you . I will take you to the hotel soon . Let's go . 
 Hello . May I help you ? 
 Let me find that on my screen ... yes , the L / C is right here . I'm sorry ; the documents don't seem to be here yet . 
 It should be around 5 working days , but different cases take different times . Sorry I can't be more precise . 
 You can take the subway to get there . 
 It takes only ten minutes . 
 You can take No . I bus or a taxi . 
 Please turn right at the traffic lights . 
 Excuse me , sir . Can I help you ? 
 I'm sorry . We can not regulate the air-conditioner . As soon as the plane takes off we'll be able to get better ventilation , and the temperature here will drop . Let me get a wet towel for you at the moment . 
 Your wet towel , sir . 
 Yes . We have mineral water , orange juice , coke , which do you prefer ? 
 Would you like some ice in your drink ? 
 How much would you like ? 
 Here you are , sir . 
 It's my pleasure . 
 Did you make it to school today ? 
 No , I didn't . 
 That was an odd change of subject . 
 No , not recently . 
 What's stopping you then ? 
 So , will you be at school tomorrow ? 
 You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law . You have the right to have an attorney present during questioning . If you cannot afford an attorney , one will be appointed for you.Do you understand ? 
 What's your name ? 
 What's your nationality ? 
 What's your relationship with the victim ? 
 Why did you attack the victim ? 
 How many times did you stab the victim ? 
 Did you know hat your actions might cause serous injuries or death ? 
 Was it your intention to kill the victim ? 
 OK.Give me his number and we'll contact him . 
 I don't know , Doctor . I'm ill . I have a headache and a stomachache . 
 Well , Doctor , I . . . 
 Yes , I ate some cake . 
 Well , yes , I did . I ate some ice cream . 
 Well , yes , I did . I ate some candy . 
 weki , Doctor . I went to a birthday party . 
 Three , Doctor . 
 Gosh , Doctor . I had only three plates of ice cream.John had four . 
 Sure . What is it ? 
 We call this a ' parking meter ' . 
 P-a-r-k-i-n-g m-e-t-e-r . 
 Yes ? 
 It ’ s not far . Go straight on then turn right at the end of the road . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 I have , actually ; I ’ Ve always wanted to build my dream home myself . 
 Well , it would be spacious and located next to a park , because a nice view is important to me . 
 I ’ d want it to have three bedrooms on a second floor with balconies on each , and one main bedroom on the main floor with an attached en suite . I ’ d also want a large living room and kitchen connected to each other so that there would be one large open space for people to spend time with each other . 
 I ’ d have one guest bathroom in the basement , one attached to the main bedroom , and one upstairs , so a total of three . 
 I don ’ t like a lot of clutter , so I wouldn ’ t have lots of things out . I would have a few vases on the mantel piece and some pictures of my family on the walls , but other than that , most things would be kept in closets . 
 I think TV is a great waste of time , so I would only have one small TV in the kitchen to watch the news in the morning . 
 I want to buy one to match my shirt.Can you give me some advice ? 
 Yes , they seem to be my size and go with my shirt quite well . I will take it . 
 I think it's running late . 
 It should be coming soon . 
 I can't stand riding the bus . 
 That is true . 
 Exactly.That ' s the worst part . 
 Yes , I agree . 
 Many children are learning drawing , dancing , swimming and so on in their spare time . You can follow suit . 
 Well , you should talk with your son and let him make his own decision . 
 Hi , I am sorry to say that your experience doesn't fit the job at all . 
 I have to say your education and experience are very outstanding , but it seems that you are not good at working in a team which we attach great importance to . 
 My major is Business Administration , I am especially interested in Marketing . 
 I attended Suzhou University . 
 Yes . I received my Bachelor degree in Business Administration . 
 Project Management . I was very interested in this course when I was a student . And I think it's very useful for my present work . 
 Yes , I have studied in an English training program and a computer training program since I graduated from university . I am currently studying Finance at a training school . 
 I passed college English Test Band - 4 , with good skill in listening , speaking , reading and writing . I haven't got any certificate of computer skills , because I don ’ t think certificates are necessary if what's needed is merely operating a computer . I think , to know how to use a computer is more important . And I'm quite familiar with Microsoft Office 
 That's $ 50 for a single night . 
 Yes , of course . Can I make a reservation for you ? 
 When can you get the finished product to me ? 
 Great ! That'll be ahead of schedule ! Good work . 
 I like double-breasted garment with no belt.Could you show me some ? 
 Medium.May I try it on ? 
 Hello ? 
 Can I speak to Li Hong , please ? 
 Hi , Li Hong.This is Alice . 
 Not bad.Li Hong , I am sorry that I can ’ t go to see Mrs.Brown with you tomorrow morning.My mother is ill . I must take care of her . 
 OK.Bye - bye . 
 Excuse me , is this the office of the Textile Corporation ? 
 I'm from CTC Trade Company . Here is my card . 
 I'm glad to meet you here . You're Ms . ... 
 Thank you , Ms . In . I'm here to discuss the possibility of establishing business relations with your corporation . 
 Yes , I had a look around yesterday . I wish I could have them all . Can you give me a price list with specifications ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 This one ? 
 The mirror is behind you , sir . 
 No , sir . It's a genuine bonnet . 
 Yes , sir . 
 I ’ d love to , but I ’ m a terrible dancer . I ’ m afraid I may step on your toes . 
 Thank you . I ’ ll try my best . 
 Oh , hi Mike . I ’ Ve been out of town the last few days . What did you need ? 
 Well , feel free to drop by my office any time . The door ’ s always open . 
 Sure , Mike , I ’ d love to . 
 No , that ’ s perfect . We can leave directly from here . 
 Thank you for saying so . I don ’ t know , probably because I like sharing my experience and knowledge with them . I think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues . 
 That is true . Some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way . For example , it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people . To show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 I want to have a trip to Sydney . 
 3 weeks 
 It's good . By the way , what kind of clothes do I have to bring with me ? 
 The new computer software is driving me crazy ! I really need a break ! 
 That ’ s what I ’ Ve heard . But as far as I ’ m concerned , it takes a genius to figure it out . Can you pass the sugar , please ? 
 Hi , I am afraid that the fax machine in my room won ’ t be working till tomorrow . A technician has just come and checked it . He will bring me a new one tomorrow . It seems there is a big problem with mine and it will take some days for repairing . Can I use the one in your office ? 
 Yes , I think you have the same model as I have . Does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ? 
 I'm looking for a white purse as a gift . Could you show what you have in stock ? 
 They must be popular again this season . 
 Wow . this is nice . I'll take this one . I guess if she doesn't like it she can return it , right ? 
 Do you mind if I get a lift in your car , please ? 
 Oh you ’ re so kind !

 Couldn't he wait until we're finished eating ? 
 Can you even hear what he's saying ? 
 Can you turn the lazy Susan for me ? I want some more chicken . 
 Will they send me a form telling me that I have been granted unemployment ? 
 What information will be in that letter ? 
 What other forms will I need to turn in ? 
 What will they be asking me on that form ? 
 What else will they ask me ? 
 Mr . Smith , I have been doing some industry research and was shocked to learn that the average salary for a position that is similar to mine pays on average $ 2,000 more per year than I am c 
 First and secondary research . I hope that you can address this concern immediately as i find it very disturbing . 
 I wish the same . As such , I hope you will seriously consider a pay increase . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 Let me have a look . Oh , the watch ’ s battery is worn down . 
 $ 50 . 
 About 2 years . 
 when are you going to give me those brochures ? 
 I know , but I want to make reservations this week . 
 Julia , I would like to have a word with you . Have a seat . 
 According to your performance , I decided to give you a salary increase . From next month , there will be a 2,000 yuan raise to your salary . Although your first raise might not sound considerable , the company believes that with your ability , sooner or later you'll get a better raise . 
 I think you deserved this . 
 Albert and I need a lot of things to furnish our house.But I don't know where the best place to shop is . Can you give me some advice ? 
 Well , we have most of the furniture already.We mostly need kitchen utensils , bathroom accessories , cleaning and laundry accessories--things like that.And Albert wants to set up a little off 
 Can I write that down ? 
 Thanks . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Probably good prices . You know we will only be in America for about a year . 
 What are those stores ? 
 Even silverware ? 
 I have a friend that said something about a place called Price Club.Do you know about that ? 
 What does that mean ? 
 Electronics ? 
 How much is the membership fee ? 
 I see . Thanks for these tips . We really need to buy a lot of little things . 
 it ’ s such a nice day outside . Let ’ s take a walk into town and do some window-shopping . 
 I know . But we could get some exercise in , and we could get some errands run , too . Window-shopping won ’ t cost you anything . 
 well , we could go to the newsagent ’ s to pick up the Sunday paper , go to the butcher ’ s to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner , and to the chemist ’ s to pick up your prescription from the doctor . 
 fine , we ’ ll do that on the way home , so we don ’ t have to carry it the whole time . 
 I promise . We ’ re only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven ’ t had time for . 
 do you have any money ? 
 for our errands , and maybe a little extra for something from a vendor on the street . 
 I agreed to not go into the mall , but I can still look at things in the market ! 
 Is there a daily passenger ship to Dalian ? 
 How many days does it take to Dalian ? 
 How many ports do we call at on our passage to Qingdao ? 
 The ship is going very fast . 
 The sea is calm and peaceful . A sea trip is always enjoyable in fine weather like this . 
 Dad , can I have a pet ? I did what you said and passed all of my exams . 
 I want a dog . My friend Mindy's dog just had puppies and she said I can have one . 
 I know , I know . I will do it all by myself . 
 Yes . It will cost me about $ 50 a month . And I make a little more than that already . 
 This place is great . I'm surprised there are so many things here . 
 What's the difference between an outlet and a regular store ? 
 Faulty products ? 
 Oh , that's easy for me . I think it's really a good deal . 
 That's great for me . Look , children's clothes ! I'd like to buy some winter clothes for my son and daughter . 
 Yes , I'll take it . Are there any jeans ? Xiaohui's jeans are always dirty . I also need four pairs of slippers . 
 I ought to make the most of it while I'm here , don't you think ? 
 What is your great struck ? 
 Why do you think you be a good fit or this job ? 
 Can you working under pressure ? 
 Are you more a follower or a leader ? 
 Ouch , it ’ s unbearable . 
 All right , doctor . But it really hurts . 
 Yes , I have received an Engineers Qualification Certificate and a drivers license . 
 I have two years driving experience . 
 I have experience in computer operation , proficiency in Microsoft Windows , Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel . 
 Visual C + + , C and Delphi . 
 No , but I have database programming experience and network knowledge . 
 I'm fine . How about yourself ? 
 No problem . So how have you been ? 
 I've been good . I'm in school right now . 
 I go to PCC . 
 It's okay . It's a really big campus . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Besides Chinese , I can speak English and French . 
 No , I can only carry on a simple conversation in French . 
 I can speak the language better than I read and write . 
 I think so . I used to be an interpreter . 
 The amount of English I know enables me to do general desk work . I believe what I know is sufficient to work in an American firm . 
 Sure , what ’ s up ? 
 Okay ... what makes you say that ? I thought you were pleased with his overall performance . Didn ’ t you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude ? 
 Well , I ’ m sure he had a perfectly good reason ... 
 Yeah , but come on , Geoff , as if you don ’ t check Facebook at work . Look , you hired this guy , we ’ Ve invested a lot of time and money in his training , so now it ’ s up to you to coach him . Make it work , Geoff ! 
 I ’ d like to book a room . 
 What ’ s the rate for a standard room ? 
 I ’ d like a standard room .

 Yes , I do . You can go to the Transport Department to get yourself a bus schedule and a bus route map .

 Can I also get some souvenirs there ? 
 By the way , where is the men's room ? 
 Thank you . 
 Well , that's all for the interview . Thank you for your interest in this job . 
 May I call you about our final decision ? 
 We will get in touch with you by the end of next week . 
 We'll notify you if necessary . Goodbye . 
 Would you like to go sightseeing tomorrow ? 
 What would you like to see in Beijing ? 
 OK . I'll pick you up here tomorrow . 
 Not bad . There ’ s a new English teacher . 
 She is beautiful . 
 She is quite young and her hair is blond . 
 Not really . Her eyes are blue . 
 Not much . She is very tall and slim . 
 Can I take this bus to city center ? 
 The Empire Hotel . 
 Well . I think I will wait . 
 Do you have some new perfume ? 
 Well , I wanna buy some new perfume . 
 That's all right . 
 Can I open it ? 
 It smells sweet . 
 Really ? How much is it ? 
 Ok , I will take two bottles .

 No , it's already included in your room fare . 
 Good afternoon , sir . Would you like a tea ? 
 Of course sir , would you like milk and sugar with that ? 
 Mom , I hate eating vegetables ! 
 Thanks , Mom.Can I have dessert now ? I love chocolate cake . 
 But I don ’ t like them.It ’ s not fair . 
 Ok , actually I don ’ t mind eating peas and carrots.But I hate broccoli and cauliflower . 
 Thanks , Mom ! 
 Why not ? 
 We'll have to talk this over some more . 
 Yes , please . I'd like to make a reservation from Hong Kong to Tampa with a stopover in Houston . 
 I would like to leave Hong Kong September the first and leave Houston for Tampa on September the 12th . 
 Lily Smith .

 You have gone against the traffic rules . 
 Do you know this is a Onaway street ? 
 You have to pay a fine . 
 Yes . I'd like to use a safety deposit box . 
 Let me see . I think it's OK . 
 Here you are . 
 Yes . 
 Thank you . 
 I see . Thank you . 
 I have to go to work . 
 I ’ m working at the polling place . 
 I work at the polling place every year . 
 I signed up for it online . 
 It ’ s a very cool job . 
 They pay well enough . 
 Awfully sorry , sir . There are no rooms available now . 
 Sorry , may I have your name ? 
 Pls wait a minute , let me check . Excuse me , but I can't seem to find your name on our list . Are you sure you have a reservation for tonight ? 
 I am terribly sorry . There must have been some mistakes . Let me check it again . Oh , yes , there is a name listed as Tommy Bush . It must be the fault of the clerk who registered your name . I apologize . 
 According to the records , your reservation is for a single room with shower and air conditioners for two nights . The room rate will be 110 dollars per night , including 10 % tax and 4 % service charge . Is this right ?

 Fine . I have your letter and I've made some notes . 
 We have quite a lot of import and export information and can give you figures on population , consumption , production , and foreign exchange reserves . 
 But you're also going to have to give some attention to trade restrictions . You can get much information about environment of investment . 
 Okay . Everyone else's parents let them stay out until two or three in the morning . 
 That's absurd . 
 I'll be worried if you stay out late . 
 Darling , can't you stay for a few more days ? 
 I'm really going to miss you.Take care of yourself . 
 Excuse me . Do you happen to have a gym here ? 
 So , where do I go to exercise ?

 Which bus goes there ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 What kind of food do you like ? 
 But your American ?

 And I've ordered the supplies . 
 Are you sure that this bus will take us to Santa Anita mall ? 
 You know that for a fact ? 
 Is it a very long bus ride ? 
 Do you know where we get off at ? 
 Really , there's a bus stop right by the mall ? 
 That's convenient . 
 Hi , Jone , how are you ? 
 What's wrong ? 
 Oh , no ! Did you call the police ? 
 Why not ? 
 I'm going to give you some advice , Jone.If this happens again , you should call the police immediately . You should try to remember everything . You should explain everything to the police . 
 How often do you service the vans ? 
 I see . What does the service involve ? 
 Can you carry out major repairs here ? 
 Do you know which stop we get off at ? 
 We've been on this bus for a while now . 
 Should we have gotten off the bus already ? 
 I thought you knew . 
 Really ? 
 I'm never catching the bus with you again . 
 Well , Peter , you have to do better than that next time , won't you ? 
 Of course , you have . You must try harder this time . 
 No , you needn't do that . You'd better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes . 
 You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn't have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study . 
 Who knows ! That might come to later . 
 Of course . What would you like ? 
 I'm so sorry . We ran out of filet mignon . May I suggest the porterhouse instead ? 
 May I be so bold as to suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ? 
 No strawberries . We'll charge your amenities account , if that's okay . 
 Your meal will be delivered as soon as it's all ready . Enjoy ! 
 It's all in the bag . 
 I need that to relax . I'm going to put a few drops in my bath water . 
 They all have essence of flowers in them . 
 I was wondering if this is where the Resume Writing Workshop is being held . 
 It ’ s been a long time since I ’ Ve had to look for work and put a resume together . 
 Where do we begin ? 
 Then what do we do ? 
 What about listing my interests and affiliations next ? 
 What ’ s the matter , dear ? 
 Oh , dear . Did you lose a lot of money ? 
 You must tell the embassy about it . And I think they ’ ll issue you with a new one . 
 No . But you mustn ’ t leave it too long . Did you report it the police ? 
 Well . You must report that it ’ s been stolen . And give the police description of your bag . You ’ d better go to the local police station tomorrow morning . 
 And Lisa . 
 Don't be too upset . It ’ s not the end of the world . 
 Yes , sir . We have a fine exercise facility . 
 You're actually standing above it . Just take the elevator or stairs down one level . 
 No , sir . There's no extra charge . All you need is your room key to open the door . 
 Sir , you'll be pleased to know that our gym never closes . 
 We might be getting one in the near future . But at the present time , no . 
 I need to finish my research paper . 
 Honey , I am sorry I have no time . 
 I am afraid you are right . Recently , even going upstairs makes me out of breath . 
 Terrific ! It is also a good exercise to keep me fit . 
 OK , I'll go . 
 Sure . 
 What ? Why ? 
 Like what ? I think that by doing something like that we would be isolating our children from social interaction . 
 I think neither your parents or mine would agree to such an idea . 
 Good luck with that ! 
 All this is thanks to the efforts of my superiors and colleagues . 
 I just did what I should have done . 
 Thank you for your compliments . I will try even harder to repay the company and your support . 
 Thanks for saying so . 
 He is at the warehouse this morning . 
 Sorry , I have no idea . You can call him there if you like . 
 Tom , you promised to cut the lung . You won't forget , will you ? 
 And you'll repair the television , won't you ? 
 Do you promise ? 
 And Tom , you will help Johnny with his homework , won't you ? 
 But you'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight , won't you ? 
 Tom , darling . You'll try not to be late for dinner tonight , won't you ? Please ! 
 Hi , buddy ! How do you deal with your salary ? 
 Look ! This stock is rising now . I am researching it , and planning to buy some shares . 
 No . This is my first time to buy some . You can see that its historical price data is rising now . 
 Hey ! Do you still remember our teacher of economics , Mr . Locker ? 
 I can ask for some advice from him . 
 Hi , Steven . 
 I ’ m very well , Thank you . And you ? 
 He ’ s fine , Thanks . How ’ s Emma ? 
 Nice to see you , too , Steven . Goodbye . 
 Steven , are you talking to me ? 
 I was thinking about the accident I saw in the morning . I was petrified when two cars collided . I witnessed the traffic accident . 
 A driver died instantly . The other one was badly hurt . A poor boy called Peter was killed in the accident too . 
 I think both . They drove too fast . What's worse , one of them was drunk . 
 I don ’ t understand . Maybe they feel they are okay and driving fast seems very cool . 
 Oh , how do you to Mr . White ? My name is Li Ming , here is my card . 
 We share the same desire . Have you seen the display of our products in the exhibition hall downstairs ? 
 Sure , we can . You know , we are been in the line for more than twenty years , and I think our price are competitive comparing with those in the world market . 
 Thank you for your information , we can hold more talks later on business details . 
 Miss Wang , how do you do ? I ’ m Allan James , the director of human recourse department of this company . 
 Not at all . Please sit down , then we can begin . 
 As you know , Miss Wang , we are looking for an executive secretary with business background and good English skills . We looked into your resume and thought you might be a good candidate . 
 Today ’ s interview is for us to get to know a little about you . And the interview will last a little bit longer . So , if you ’ re comfortable , I want to ask you some questions . 
 No problem , of course ! How much would you like to spend to impress the lady ? 
 Sir , the restaurant you seek is right here . This hotel has a three-star restaurant . 
 Gramercy Tavern is at least as good as our own hotel restaurant . Plus , they have live jazz . 
 Right away , sir . She will be impressed with your local knowledge . 
 Which date would that be ? 
 I'm afraid our hotel is fully booked on that night . Is it possible for you to change your reservation date ? 
 We might have cancellations . Could you call us again some other day ? 
 I'm very sorry , sir , but we are unable to do that . We would appreciate it very much if you could call us instead . 
 Good morning , Mr . Smith . Would you like to see around the factory ? 
 This is our office block . We have all the administrative department here , Sales , Accounts , Personnel , Market Research and so on . 
 I ’ m looking for a sweater for my wife . Tomorrow is her birthday . And I know she needs a woolen sweater . 
 It feels good . Are there cowl-neck pullovers with the same color ? My wife prefers a turtleneck to a V-shaped collar . 
 Size one . By the way , what if I bring home this sweater and my wife doesn ’ t like it ? 
 All right . Could I have it gift-wrapped , please ? 
 Why do you want to be a stewardess ? 
 Could you handle flying for 24 hours straight ? 
 That's good . 
 You should very qualified . 
 Rebecca Johnson speaking . 
 Just a moment ... I'm afraid there's nobody there right now . Could I take a message ? 
 Sorry , just a moment . The name is Caxton ... 
 Fine , I've got that . And your company is ... 
 Could you spell that , please ? 
 Thank you . And the message ? 
 Have you got the number there ? 
 856674 . 
 OK , I'll get someone to phone you first thing in the morning . 
 This blouse is a special offer today . You can have it at 10 % off the regular price . 
 No . 10 % is my last word . 
 Who's in charge of the construction project ? 
 I can ’ t I'm afraid . I've got another meeting scheduled for 2:30 p . m . 
 Are you kidding ? The train leaves in an hour . Where did you put it ? 
 Is it in the other pocket ? 
 Let's go to the inquiry desk first to check whether anyone has got it and turned it in . 
 Can you tell me about a nice restaurant to go to ? 
 My date is quite sophisticated . She would expect nothing less than the best . 
 That's a good idea , except I want to go out , not stay in . Something else , maybe ? 
 That sounds good ! Could you call them to see if I can get a reservation ? 
 I'll talk to you later . 
 I have to get off the phone now . 
 There are other things I need to take care of . 
 Please don't be nosey . 
 You don't need to worry about that . 
 I am very sorry , but I must go . 
 Lucy , I ’ d like to fix the light in the corridor , it keeps flashing , which drives me crazy . Would you like to help me with the ladder ? 
 I think I can handle it by myself . 
 I see . If I got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , I wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility . 
 Like this one ? 
 Yeah , thank you for telling me . 
 Will you be checking in any baggage today ? 
 If you need baggage tags , they are found in the box on your right . 
 You are allowed an additional two carry-on items . 
 I see . All carry-on items must be able to fit under the seat or in the overhead bin . 
 You will need to send the tripod as luggage because it is too long to fit in our gauge box for carry-on items . 
 No , I can't . Perhaps your stewardess will help you to find a place to store it . 
 I'm afraid I have lost my air ticket while I was shopping . 
 Yes , I checked again and again , but I can't find it . By the day after tomorrow , can I have the ticket reissued ? 
 I talked with the manager over the phone and he told me I can have it reissued because I have a copy of my lost ticket . 
 I can't finish this steak . 
 Look , the printer isn ’ t functioning well . I ’ Ve pushed the start button . It is suppose to be working now but it remains like a log . What ’ s going on ? 
 I didn ’ t pay attention to that . I will try to get the paper out . 
 Good morning , sir . Do you have a reservation ? 
 I see . We have a window table reserved for you . 
 Would you like to order now or wait for a while ? 
 Can you help me pick out a gift for my daughter ? 
 Yes , that sounds like a good idea . 
 Okay . How much ? 
 Oh , that sounds great . I'll take it . 
 Here's my VISA . 
 Everything I need is in this box ? 
 Thank you for your help . 
 Excuse me , are cameras allowed here ? 
 I see . What a pity . I have to appreciate it carefully . 
 Hi , John Phillips ? I ’ m Rose Green . I ’ Ve been asked to handle your training and introduce a little bit of the company to you . It ’ s nice to meet you . 
 After a week , you ’ ll be running around here like a pro . Let me give you this list of departments first , next to each department is its location and the name of the manager . 
 Have you bought a lot of new clothes for your vacation ? 
 What does travel light mean ? 
 I'm afraid we can't increase salary this year , money is just too tight . 
 Why not ? 
 What are you talking about , we've tried everything ! 
 Yes . I am thinking of a tour to Australia . 
 That's really cheap . What are the fees included ? 
 OK , I will take the tour . 
 I am the apartment manager . How can I help you ? 
 I haven't rented it out yet . Would you like to see it ? 
 How about today at 6 p . m . ? 
 Very good . We'll meet at 6 . Do you need directions ? 
 If you're interested , you can fill out an application form . 
 No . The only thing I need to see is your driver's license . 
 don ’ t worry . I don't think you ’ re going to lose your job over one mistake . 
 but it wasn ’ t just you who was involved , right ? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do . 
 let ’ s think realistically about what might happen . How much money do you have in your savings ? 
 well , that ’ s good . If you lose your job , you can just move in with me until you find another job . That will save you plenty of money . 
 if you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . If you live frugally , you ’ ll save plenty of money . 
 Yo baby , are you satisfied with the costume show in the street ? 
 Let's start to study how to use computers , Paubler.It ' s good to know that a computer has two major parts , the hardware and the software . 
 The hardware of computer is basically all the concrete things you can touch with your hands and see with your eyes . 
 The software of computer is all the programmes inside the computer that allow you to use the computer to do things . 
 Right you are , Paler , and since what you want to learn is how to use software , we should also learn to refer to the computer menus . 
 Hello . 
 Not really , I ’ m in a meeting . Can I call you back in ... say ... 15 minutes ? 
 Ok , I ’ ll look out for it . Sorry , I can ’ t talk now . 
 Sorry , he has just gone out now . Can I take a message for you ? 
 OK , I got it . 
 I've just had some money sent from Germany , in Euros . 
 I have my passport right here , and here are the account details . The name , number ... 
 That was quick ! I didn't expect it to come through so quickly . Yes , that is good news . The full amount should be 20,000 Euros , is that right ? I'd like to withdraw 5,000 Euros worth of local currency , if that's possible . 
 Get up , it's time for you to get ready . 
 I would , but you need to start getting ready for school . 
 If I let you go back to sleep , I know that you won't get up in five minutes . 
 You have a lot to get done this morning . 
 I want you to be on time for school today . 
 Okay , I'll let you sleep for a little while longer . 
 How many rooms are you looking for ? 
 150 a month . 
 My mascara's waterproof ! 
 No . There's makeup remover for waterproof mascara . 
 Yep . See how long and curly my lashes are ? 
 Thanks ! 
 Same here . Hey , did you know Susan is going to get married . She invited me to her wedding and she wants you to attend also . 
 Definitely . I'm calling to tell you this . 
 She tried , but the line is always busy . 
 Of course . It's 555-4653 . 
 Pretty good . I've just bought a new house . 
 In the suburb . How are you and Carol ? Still living in town ? 
 Okay . Don't forget to call Susan . 
 Are you okay ? 
 What's wrong ? 
 By who ? 
 Are you hurt ? 
 That's crazy . 
 Do you want me to take you ? 
 Repairman.May I come in ? 
 What's the matter , sir ? 
 Let me see.En .. it's right now.You can try it . 
 You are welcome . 
 ( while shaking hands ) I am Zhang Wei , nice to meet you , sir . 
 Thank you . Have you received my resume ? 
 Of course , here you are , sir . 
 Certainly , it would be my pleasure , Mr . Smith . 
 You peel the onions and wash them , then chop them . 
 Let me see . Wash the cabbage over there . 
 What is your father doing now ? 
 How about Daniel ? 
 Be careful of the peeler . Don't cut your fingers . 
 OK , we've finished . Can you get your father and brother ? 
 How do you like your work ? 
 What do you do ? 
 Mine isn't hard , but it's not interesting . 
 I'm a clerk in a shop . 
 Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer , and you'll be off and running . 
 In that case , let me tell you about some alternatives . 
 For starters , we have a computer lab . 
 The lab is completely free . But you do have to pay a dime a page for printing . 
 Just bring your laptop down here to the lobby . We're set up for wireless right here . 
 Unfortunately , you'll have to go to the computer lab for your printing needs . 
 Yeah , get off the bus . 
 I'm really not sure . 
 I don't think this is right . 
 Yeah , we did get off too early . 
 I messed up . 
 You want to wait for the next bus ? 
 Is it urgent ? Our ambulances are not enough to meet every call . 
 All right , we'll come right away . 
 He's there in the room . He's very ill . 
 Carry him into the emergency ward . Here we are . 
 ( after a while ... ) I'm his guide . What's the trouble with him , doctor 
 May I send food for him ? 
 Can I come round to see him tomorrow ? 
 Yes . Thank you . 
 OK . 
 When could I take care of him ? 
 good afternoon ! Can I help you ? 
 this way , please . Here they are . They're all handmade . 
 of course . The fitting room is right over there . 
 I'm sorry . All the back of that size are sold out . Would you like a red one ? 
 oh , that suits you very well . Besides it is believed in China that the red color brings happiness and good luck . 
 our pleasure . Please fill out this form , leaving your address and telephone number . 
 let me see ... 
 I heard that there are some beauty spots and places of historical interest in this city . 
 That's great . I trouble you so much . Thank you very much . 
 OK , let ’ s go . 
 We ’ re in the last stretch of this very exciting race , and Kimmi Rikknen is leading the pack with only four laps to go ! They are heading to turn three and Lewis Hamilton tries to pass Rikknen ! It ’ s a close one and , oh no ! Hamilton hits the wall ! 
 The cleanup crew is towing the heavily damaged car and the green flag drops ! Rikknen is still in the lead with only two laps to go ! 
 How unlucky for Rikknen , and this race is over ladies and gentlemen , Alonso takes the checkered flag ! 
 eyes , you sent them to New York , right ? 
 What did you have in mind ? 
 We have plenty of postcards to choose from here . The same designs can be found on these posters . 
 Yes , we do . They're on the wall behind you . 
 The prices are clearly marked on the back of each mask . Would you like me to get one down for you to look at ? 
 Here you go . 
 Are you looking for some homemade chocolate as a gift ? 
 We've got plenty to choose from here . 
 Good morning , Madam . Is everything OK ? Is there something I can assist you with ? 
 Welcome to the electronic age ! I can run you through it ; it's what I'm here for . 
 Just look at the screen here . It'll give you prompts , you see ? Now you need to enter your PIN number , then press ' enter ' to confirm it . 
 Not right away , you need to decide what it is you want to do . The next thing is to select the service . 
 Yes , then enter the amount you want . 
 The road ahead is blocked . There might have been an accident . 
 Not really , but they are on the rise . 
 Operator , can you give me any information on the call I just received ? 
 Can you tell me the calling number , please ? 
 Thank you . 
 Was there an accident on the freeway today ? 
 No , don't you know what happened ? 
 Are you serious ? 
 Did anyone get hurt ? 
 Are they going to be okay ? 
 Well , that's a miracle that no one was killed . 
 Steven , can you give us a summary about your work ? What do you get from your work ? 
 Why do you think so ? 
 Very good . Anything else ? 
 I must praise you for your modesty and diligence . What's your plan next ? 
 I've got to commend you ; you really did a good job . 
 Good afternoon . May I help you ? 
 What kind of car do you have in mind ? 
 I see . How long will you need it ? 
 Just a moment , please . 
 Outlets have cheap cashmere sweaters . 
 Outlets usually give you great deals . 
 You're welcome . 
 right now ? 
 i think i'll be a little afraid . 
 afraid of making a mistake . 
 all right . i'll give it a try . 
 License and registration please . Have you been drinking tonight , sir ? 
 Step out of the vehicle , please . Sir , what do you have in the back ? 
 Don ’ t take that tone with me . Do you have an invoice for these items ? 
 You are under arrest , sir . You have the right to remain silent . You better not pout , you better not cry . Anything you say can and will be used against you . You have the right to an attorney , if you cannot afford one , the state will appoint one for you . 
 What should I get Uncle Teddy ? 
 Are you kidding ? That's the stupidest gift one can buy . I don't want to get a tie . 
 Everybody gets men ties for Christmas . It's too boring . Everybody buys either ties or sweaters . I want a more unique gift . 
 That's a cool idea . At least it would be a surprise.But I'm afraid he wouldn't take care of it . 
 Yes . An iguana is too strange for a gift , and a tie is too normal.So I have to find something halfway between . 
 Well , he was very good to me.He helped me edit my essay for the scholarship contest.So I want to spend at least 75 dollars . 
 Yes . 
 What should he have then ? 
 I think that's a great idea . Men look great with that kind of bag.Where can we buy one ? 
 Alright . We can go later then . 
 Good plan . What should we get for Mom though ? 
 Alright . We can go check at Sears and see if they have them.And what about Dad ? 
 I think it would be a great joke.But I know we'd have to take the iguana back . And the pet store might not let us.So why don't we get him something else ? Some clothes maybe . 
 Oh , shut up about ties ! Forget about ties , why not ? 
 The language used in this multinational company is mainly about English ; do you think you can manage to handle that ? 
 What about your second foreign language since you were an English major ? 
 Anne , would you please come in for a while ? Please also bring along the minutes of yesterday's management meeting . 
 How long did the meeting last ? 
 Did the chairman ask for me ? 
 All right . Have you handed in my report to him ? 
 Thank you , Anne . You've done an excellent job . Did they mention the date for the next meeting ? 
 Hello , I'm sorry for calling this late . May I speak to Peter ? 
 When is he coming back ? 
 I'll call again in thirty minutes . 
 I ’ m playing with my toys , Dad . 
 so , your friend ’ s getting married on Saturday . What have you bought her as a wedding gift . I find is so hard to choose the right gift . 
 that ’ s clever ! Then everyone knows that they are buying something the couple really want and there ’ s no chance of two people buying the same gift . What things were in the notebook ? 
 so , what did you get them ? 
 what ’ s wrong with is ? 
 household appliance don ’ t seem to last for a long time nowadays . 
 Hello , are you interested in this Honda ? 
 It's a good car . 
 1999 . 
 6,000 miles , all highway mileage . 
 Highway miles are not as bad as local miles . They do not hurt car as much . 
 The owner was commuting everyday crossing the state line . 
 One month . 
 You'll check it out anyway you want . You can take it to a garage . 
 $ 5,900 . 
 Leave your phone number , and I will give you a call if the price gets reduced . 
 It's very nice of you to invite me . 
 Thank you . This is my first time to come to a Chinese restaurant . Could you tell me the different features of Chinese food ? 
 Chinese dishes are exquisitely prepared , delicious , and very palatable . They are very good in colour , flavour , and taste . 
 No more , thank you . I'm quite full . 
 It's the most delicious dinner I've had for a long time . It's such a rich dinner . 
 Thank you very much for your hospitality . 
 Why , what's the lowdown ? 
 I have no idea there was that great of deviation between the two venues ... To make our products sell , we have to take the target audience into account . 
 Excuse me , could you lend me some of your records ? 
 Until Monday or Tuesday next week . 
 May I help you ? 
 That's no problem . Which currency would you like to buy ? 
 Of course . Do you have your passport with you ? How much would you like to purchase ? 
 Please fill in this form . How would you like it ? In 100 Euro cheques ? 
 Have you always been on this site ? 
 Why did you move ? 
 I want to open an account . 
 I want to open a checking account . 
 How much is that ? 
 Really ? 
 What if I can ’ t meet that requirement ? 
 How much is the fine ? 
 I'm so hungry ! Can you buy me a burrito ? 
 Please ? I haven't eaten anything all day . 
 I'm so hungry , I could eat a whole cow ! 
 I get paid on Friday , I'll pay you back then . 
 That's pretty messed up . 
 I don't want to go all the way home just to eat . 
 Good coming . room service.What can I do for you ? 
 OK.sir . We will bring it to you as soon as possible . 
 can I get you something to drink ? 
 so how about an aperitif ? 
 stirred or shaken ? 
 here you are . 
 sure . All of our mixed drinks are excellent . You can also try a delicious non-alcoholic cocktail . 
 try a Singer . It has lime juice and grenadine over ice . 
 here we go . 
 enjoy yourself . 
 Kevin ? Hi , it ’ s Elizabeth . I have a big favor to ask you . 
 Well , I ’ Ve got a huge load of typing and Mr . Blake has insisted I get it done by tomorrow afternoon . 
 I'm checking out now . Can I have my bill , please ? 
 It's 8736 . Here is my key card . 
 Can I pay with traveler's check ? 
 Here you are . 
 Very much . The room is cozy and the service is jolly good . By the way , could you deliver my luggage to the airport in advance ? 
 Flight 17 . And my luggage should be delivered there by 4 o'clock . 
 Thank you . 
 If you want to speed up your system , you ’ Ve got to clean it up first . 
 You need to free your disk space . The simplest way is to use a Disk-Cleanup tool to remove temporary files and in store programs that you no longer use . Things should be fine next time you start . You also need to control what starts up . There is a program calls Start-up Delayer , It can help to set after how much time programs should be loaded after Windows boosts . For example , you can choose to set your Fox Mail program to load 30 seconds after Windows starts up . 
 This suit looks nice.Can I try it on ? 
 how was your day ? 
 it was really busy . I had to work straight through my lunch break . 
 my boss told me that I could either go home early or take a long lunch break another day , so I decided to wait and take a long lunch break another time . 
 let ’ s get back to you . How was your day ? 
 you look pretty upset . Are you ok ? 
 what ’ s that ? 
 you ’ re kidding ! How did that happen ? 
 how late were you ? 
 you got fired for being a few minutes late ? 
 oh well . You never really liked your boss anyway , did you ? 
 That's right . 
 I did reporting for the university newspaper in my school.And I always be very interested in journalism . 
 I study the administration.Yes.But I'm more attracted to writing articles . I want to use my knowledge of business to write financial news . 
 I know that starting reporters work many hours . I'm very willing to take on the challenge . 
 What ’ s going on ? 
 Is there any water damage ? 
 I ’ ll go to your apartment tomorrow to fix the pipe . 
 I ’ ll just do it myself . 
 You ’ re right about that . 
 That ’ s fine . 
 Drop in if you're free.Bye for now ! 
 Excuse me , I don't feel good right now . 
 Do you have any pills for airsickness ? 
 Please fetch me a glass of water . Thanks . 
 What's wrong ? 
 You should get acupuncture treatment . My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her . 
 They don't just randomly stick you , they find your pressure points . The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment , restoring the body's " chi " . 
 The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options . 
 This only signifies that the toxins have left the body . Actually , there is only discomfort during the treatment process . Once it's over you feel very comfortable . 
 This is the only way to get at the problem . Anyway , if you want to relieve the pain , you are just going to have to be tough and do it . 
 I like this shirt.How much is it ? 
 Wow , that's sheer robbery.Shall I make an offer ? 
 Good morning . Your ticket and passport , please ? 
 Do you have any baggage to check in ? 
 Would you please put it on the scale ? 
 The baggage allowance is different according to the class of your ticket . What class are you travelling ? 
 For a first-class passenger , the free baggage allowance is forty kilos . 
 Passengers holding first class tickets may carry 2 pieces within the total weight of 5 kg onto the plane . 
 If the checked baggage is over the allowance , we will charge you for the overweight . 
 You're welcome . Your boarding pass and baggage check , please . 
 Could you do me a favor ? 
 Is that room service ? 
 The maid has just delivered some laundry to my room.But it's not mine at all . 
 Tell me something about yourself and your past . 
 What was the most significant project you've worked on ? 
 What finance experience makes you qualified for this position ? 
 How would your coworkers evaluate you ? 
 What are your salary expectations ? 
 Sorry , I have to rush off and catch the 9 o'clock train to Paris . 
 Until we meet again . 
 We're redecorating our living room . 
 First , we're going to change the curtains , then we're going to paint the walls . 
 Pale yellow . 
 We're going to put in some new furniture . 
 To cancel your reservation , I need your name , phone number , and date of trip , please . 
 I see your reservation on my computer . Let me just cancel it , and you'll be all set ! 
 You're welcome . 
 Yes , of course . I'll take it . 
 I like it . 
 I really appreciate your offer , but I have to decline it , because I have already taken another job which I prefer to work in . 
 I will . Thank you . 
 I'll have a hamburger . 
 No , just tomatoes , please . And large fries . 
 A small cola . 
 Apple pie is my favorite dessert . 
 Would you please teach me how to use the computer ? 
 Do I have to turn on the computer ? 
 What should I learn first ? 
 I am ready I am going to get , let's start ! 
 Let's order something to eat . What are you in the mood for ? 
 OK . How about some fried spring rolls and squid balls , some pork skins , and some beer ! 
 Excuse me , sir , Is this the road to the peace Store ? 
 Where's Wort Street , please ? 
 How far is it from the Wort Street ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Yes . I've read it carefully . 
 No . But the contract stipulates that I will teach 22 hours a week.Will you have thatmany classes for me right away ? 
 But my salary will be 1100 dollars a month.Will you pay me that much for the first month ? Because , I mean , I won't be working so many hours . 
 Oh , so I don't sign the contract today . Is that right ? 
 I can accept that . 
 Even my health insurance ? 
 I have a few questions about the free membership . 
 Is my membership the same as paying club members ? I mean , can I get discounts at club hotels ? 
 What are bar vouchers ? 
 But according to the contract , employees get a discount in the restaurant . 
 So , for now , you want me to keep a copy of the contract.But we won't sign it yet . That right ? 
 I understand.And according to the terms on the contract , I am happy to accept this job . I look forward to it . 
 Welcome to our shop . It seems you are interested in this dress . 
 That's no problem . It is made of linen , so you won't feel hot in it . I can assure you it is of superior quality . What is more , it is very popular with young women . 
 88 Yuan . 
 Hi , I am looking for a woman named Mia . 
 That would be me ! 
 I hope that what they had to say was mostly good ! 
 Finding the beautiful woman in a red dress next to the fountain wasn't all that hard . 
 I was hoping that we could take a walk down the street to my favorite cafe . 
 Excuse me , how do I get to the Forbidden City ? 
 Is it far ? 
 Thank you . 
 Yes . I could use a cup of coffee . 
 French toast sounds good . What are you going to order ? 
 Let ’ s move out of here . This apartment is too small . 
 A house would be great . I could plant a garden . And you could use the garage for a workshop . 
 How much is the rent ? 
 When is the place available ? 
 I am very nervous about signing my escrow papers . 
 What should I have brought with me ? 
 I feel a little overwhelmed by so many papers . 
 My boyfriend is an attorney and told me that I could fax him anything if I had a question . 
 Is this the last thing that I will need to do before the house becomes mine ? 
 I want a doggy bag , waiter . 
 Quite good . It was the most wonderful dinner I have ever had . 
 Hello , IMPF Bank , how can I help you ? 
 OK Sir . Could you tell me the account holder's name , the account number , the amount in the account and your PIN number , please ? 
 OK , Sir . Almost there , I just need your PIN number . When we issue you with a new card and book we would recommend that you change your PIN number . It's a very simple procedure . 
 Excuse me , could I ask a favour ? 
 Could you tell me where the canteen is ? 
 Oh , I don't want to trouble you . 
 Do you take in students ? 
 How much is it ? 
 Do you think I could have a look at it , please . 
 Can I take your order , sir ? 
 Certainly sir , would you like some rice or noodles with that ? 
 Ok , would you like some soup as well ? 
 Thank you very much . Your food will be ready soon . 
 Yes . Could you tell me how to send some money to someone with an account with a bank in Germany ? 
 Which is the best way ? 
 $ 800 . 
 How long does it take ? 
 I don't know . Can I send it more quickly ? 
 And how long do those take ? 
 I see . How can I pay by Telegraphic Transfer ? 
 I can ’ t attend the meeting in Washington . I ’ Ve proposed you as the most able substitute . 
 It ’ s easy enough . Just make sure you keep track of all your expenses . The accounting department will reimburse you for all your meals and travel expenses . 
 Yes , but when you send in your expense report , you also have to file a report summarizing your trip . It ’ s not just a big vacation , you know . 
 I ’ Ve already paved the way . You just have to give a presentation on what our products are . I will do the follow-up and close the sale . 
 Thanks , doc . I ’ Ve got a really bad toothache ! I can ’ t eat anything , and look , my face is all swollen . I think it might be my wisdom tooth . 
 Is it gonna hurt ? 
 Ok , spit . 
 Well , let me see . Now it's 11:00 sharp . It's a long way to go.If I take the shortest route , we may come across a traffic jam.If I take a less heavy route , it will save us 10 or more minutes , but you'll have to pay more . Which do you prefer ? 
 Generally speaking , we can if we go at this speed and nothing unexpected happens . 
 Compared to the shortest route , you may pay around 5 Euro more . 
 OK ... Here we are . We'll turn left at this cross . To go straight ahead is the shortest route . 
 I've been learning to play go recently . It's an amazing game ! 
 At least you have obtained a very basic understanding of the game , haven't you ? I think it is perfect for boosting intelligence , cultivating personality and flexible learning . Every intellectual wishing to gain any insight into Chinese culture should learn to play Go . 
 Sure . It was considered desirable that a well-educated ancient Chinese scholar could be well versed in zither , weigh , calligraphy and painting . I think weigh is the most fantastic of them . It embodies ancient Chinese wisdom and cultural profoundness . 
 Yes . Playing chess is a very aggressive experience . All the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . Whenever I start a chess game , I can't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill . 
 Certainly not . The object of weigh is to surround a larger area than the opponent . In other words , each side is struggling for a greater living space by mapping out a territory on the board . Hence , chess aims to kill , while weigh is most concerned with howso survive . 
 I only wish it were this time yesterday . 
 Perhaps we ought to get dressed and have breakfast . We'd feel better . 
 Perhaps I'd better ring the police ... 
 Good evening , sir . Welcome to our restaurant . 
 Do you have a reservation ? 
 May I have your name , please ? 
 Mr . Brown . We were expecting you . This way , please . Will this table be fine ? 
 Please take a seat . 
 Here is the menu . 
 Nice to meet you , too . 
 I recently graduated from college as an English major . 
 Admittedly , I don't . But I still beg you to give me an opportunity , and I'm willing to learn with my best effort . 
 I have got a Business English Certificate and a Certificate of TEM 8 . 
 I got professional training in this field , and I believe I can fit the position well . 
 I have taken some courses in college , such as translation , business English , and so on . So I have a good mastery of both spoken and written English 
 Your approval would be my honor . 
 You know I hate shopping more than anything else in this world . 
 What kind of errands do we need to run ? 
 I'll only go if we can stop at the office-license to pick up something to drink for tonight . 
 Sounds good . You have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though . I know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms , especially if the stores have special offers . 
 Ok , let's go then ! 
 For what ? 
 You said you were only going to window shop ! 
 I should have known ... 
 Just what are you proposing ? 
 That's a big change from 25 % ! 10 % is beyond my negotiating limit . Any other ideas ? 
 Sure . I have to talk to my office anyway . I hope we can find some common ground on this . 
 I hope so , Dana . My instructions are to negotiate hard on this deal , but I'm trying very hard to reach some middle ground . 
 Dana . I can't bring those numbers back to my office , they'll turn it down flat . 
 Hello . What can I do for you ? 
 I see . Do you have your Current All-in-one Passbook with you ? I'll need your password for this transaction . 
 And how much of your salary would you like ? 
 Good morning , sir . Here is the hotel's sauna room . What can I do for you ? 
 Sure Those who have heart disease or high blood pressure are not allowed to take sauna , for their sake . 
 First , change your shoes to slippers . Then walk up to the changing room to get prepared for a shower . 
 After the shower , step into the washroom with birch switches , dip them in the warm water and briskly whisk them over your skin . 
 Yes , then enter the bathroom , There is a stove tired with wood in the room , and on the top of the stove , there is a pile of stones , which keep the heat . Throw some water on the stones , and dry steam is given off . 
 Can I have a look at your handworks ? 
 You have quite a range , haven't you ? 
 They are all produced in China , aren't they ? 
 Could you please select me one ? 
 Oh , I like it very much . How much does it cost ? 
 OK . I'll take it . 
 Yes , Mr . Emory ? 
 I thought they had already agreed to everything . That ’ s going to take weeks to rework . 
 May I make a reservation ? 
 The four of us will be there at 7:00 this evening . 
 It looks delicious . I will order it . 
 Would you please make it for a single person ? 
 Hello . I have left my key in my room . But I can't get in now . 
 I am Molopo and my room is 5022 . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Please to meet you Mrs Chen . My name is Joy . Welcome to the hotel . Here is the keys , registration slips and breakfast description . Breakfast will be served from seven tomorrow morning . Is there any change of your schedule ?

 Can I get you something , coffee , tea ? 
 What's going on ? 
 A lot , like the party I'm having on Friday . 
 Will you be able to make it ? 
 What do you have to do ? 
 Maybe you can come next time . 
 I'll look for you at my next party . 
 Do you have anything to wash ? 
 OK . They will be ready by 7:00 
 Of course , sir . We will press all the clothes when they are cleaned . 
 Excuse me , I'm a little lost . Which bus do I take to get to Shi Da ? 
 Oh ok , where do I get off ? 
 Ok , thanks ... 
 No , is it difficult ? 
 How much does it cost ? 
 Wow , I can't thank you enough . 
 Is there a bookstore near here ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Oh , yes . May I sit on the grass ? 
 Yes , I can see it.But what's on it ? 
 Well , there's a bench under the tree.We can sit there . 
 Why not ? 
 May I help you ? 
 Do you have a reservation ? 
 I'm sorry , Ma'am . I can't find anything under that name.Do you have your confirmation number ? 
 Well , let me look again . How do you spell your first name , Ma'am ? 
 I don't find a Carol in the computer for today . I have a Carol Larson here . But that reservation is for next Monday . 
 Are you sure he used your name , Ma'am ? Maybe he reserved under his name . 
 I'm sorry . I have nothing here . 
 How is your appetite today ? 
 What would you like to have ? 
 Which would you rather have , beef or chicken ? 
 How about drinks ? Coffee or tea ? 
 Do you want to take milk and sugar ? 
 So , Casey , how are things going with the photos for the press kit ? 
 You ’ Ve had over a month to get this finalized ! Why are things delayed ? 
 I ’ m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time ! 
 I ’ m not going to put this off any longer , Casey ! I want those photos ASAP ! 
 Hold on a second please . I'm sorry . He has gone out . 
 He will be back at about seven o'clock . 
 Yes , certainly . 
 All right . I'll tell him when he comes back . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Let me see , the buying rate is RIB 808 per $ 100 . How much would you like to change ? 
 Would you mind showing me your passport ? 
 Let me see . $ 200 makes RIB 1,616 . Here is the cash and exchange memo . Please check it . 
 Give me enough for a skirt , will you ? 
 Can you give me a discount ? 
 OK . 72 yuan . 
 No , Thanks.Not today . 
 What do you charge for the sports shoes ? 
 Well , that's a bit stiff . Do you have some cheaper ones ? 
 May I help you ? 
 Yes , of course . Here are all the tour routes we have to Italy . 
 2 weeks . Is that OK ? 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 How many carats would you like it to be ? 
 Is this one suitable for you ? 
 What about this ? 
 Then you can buy this one . It's very nice and latest in style . 
 Do you give me a bonus ? 
 Do you allow any commission ? 
 Hello , this is United Airlines . 
 When is your flight ? 
 One first class seat on flight YW132 , is that right ? 
 You are supposed to check in at least one hour beforehand . 
 No , are there any vacant beds for us ? 
 Just an ordinary one , six people living in a room . 
 3 days . 
 What's the minimum quantity of an order for your goods ? 
 No problem . We want a minimum of 1,000 dozen of men's shirts and a minimum of 3,000 dozen of embroidered shirts . Can you guarantee continuous production and adequate supply ? 
 And for such a big quantity , you should give us a discount . 
 That's great . 
 I'm sorry , sir . Exactly what is the problem ? 
 I'm so sorry , sir . We'll give you a new room immediately , and give you a refund also . 
 Sir , we always try to please our guests . 
 Oh ... Um ... I don't think so . you know the halogen lighting is much more expensive than your track lighting system . Plus I'm going to have to call in some guys to install it for you . That's not going to come cheap . 
 It doesn't matter because we will still have to call the electrician out , and they are union labor . It'll cost you a pretty penny ... 
 Mumm , I estimate it'll run in the neighborhood of ... $ 500 per light . 
 It is , I'll tell you why . We'll have to call in the electrician , he's going to charge overtime now because it's already 5PM , and it will probably take him an hour a light . Plus , the halogen lights take more electricity , so your electrical cost is going to be higher as well . 
 No , that's the cost , and that's what it's going to cost us . We can't go in the hole with this . I am giving you my best price , so take it , or leave it . 
 I'm glad you like it . The bell is on the bedside . Just ring if you want anything . The room attendant speaks a little English . So I don't think you'll have any trouble . 
 I think so . Here it is . It's by the basin . 
 Yes , it is . 
 I really don ’ t understand my parents . They always make light of my worries . 
 But the child has his own feeling . 
 I believe you ordered the Grand Slam breakfast . 
 Oh , I just noticed that I accidentally brought you your friend's breakfast . 
 And pancakes for you , sir . 
 I am sorry that I misheard you . 
 I will get straight back to you with your waffles . 
 Hi , Sir . What can I do for you ? 
 Right . If the cheque is coming from the US , into a local currency account it will take 7 working days to clear . 
 There is , actually . If you can get your company to apply for a cheque from a bank in Shanghai , that'll speed things up no end . 
 Yes , show me your tickets please . 
 The train is driving after ten minutes . 
 It's over there . Have a good trip . 
 Are you looking for an apartment ? 
 I think I have just a right apartment for you . 
 Yes . It has one bedroom , a large living space and 4 kitchens . 
 Yes , it ’ s brand-new . 
 It ’ s $ 8.50 a month . 
 We can take a see by there now if you like . The landlord left me a set of keys with me . 
 Good afternoon , how can I help ? 
 Of course . Your balance is 92,320 RIB in your Securities Account . How much would you like to withdraw ? 
 No problem . Please fill in this transfer form that will authorise us to send the amount from the Securities Company to your account . 
 Good morning , Miss Mandy . How are you today ? 
 Have you got a sore throat , too ? 
 Yes , I see . Go home to bed and take one of these pills every three hours . 
 Melanie , can you help me with something ? We need to finalize the account with the Mexican Embassy and , I need some advice on phrasing this letter correctly in English . 
 Okay , so ... To Whom It May Concern , I am writing . 
 Okay , more relaxed . Got it . Hey , Sally , what ' s up ? It's Tracy here , just . 
 Great , okay . " Dear Miss Cooper , I'm writing to confirm the final quotation for the full page back cover color advertisement you requested for the spring issue of Voila magazine " . 
 " The final costing , including advert design and production , comes to forty-five thousand six hundred RIB . We want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . Thanks for ... " 
 Oops , okay . You are right . Then I can just end with " All the best , Tracy " . 
 Oh , Melanie , you are a life saver , thank you ! 
 Hi , I'm calling from Nika Corporation . We would like to hold a business lunch at the restaurant . 
 There will be about 18 people . 
 Is there an extra charge to reserve the room ? 
 That's great . I'd like to go ahead and reserve the room , then , for Friday , December 2 , at around noon . This is a retirement party and we'd like to bring a cake for the guest of honor and some bottles of champagne . Will that be acceptable ? 
 Oh , that's fine . 
 Sure . I'm J McQuillin and my number is 323-555-6840 , extension 42 . 
 Sounds good . Thanks for your help . 
 Excuse me , miss.Should I check in here for taking MS121 to Florence ? 
 Here you are . Can I have a seat in the back of the plane ? 
 Have you anything to declare ? 
 Where did you buy it ? 
 Do you travel a lot ? 
 Twice a year ? How long has your sister lived in Boston ? 
 I see , that's a long time . How much was the watch ? 
 Yes , I'd like to see the receipt . Oh ! I see you bough the watch last week . 
 Yes , I'm afraid you will . Altogether on the watch and the perfume you owe me seven pounds . 
 Yes , that's fine . I hope you enjoyed your stay in Boston ? 
 Good morning and welcome . How can I help you ? 
 We have 3 different types of boxes . We usually rent for 1 year and the fee depends on the size and location of the box . 
 You can have more than 1 key if you'd like , but we must have signature cards for each box . 
 If you have your ID and are willing to pay a year in advance , we can do that for you today , there is no need to wait . 
 Rachel ? I ’ m not sure how you want to handle this account . I think there are a few things to be sorted out . 
 That ’ s true . But even beyond that , there ’ s the question of meeting the deadlines they ’ Ve set . 
 Why have you decided to change jobs ? 
 Then , why do you want to work for our bank since it's a new establishment in Shanghai ? 
 It certainly is . But the work is also hard here . You need to put a lot of hard hours on the job to succeed in this field . 
 Do you mind going on frequent business traps ? 
 Excuse me.sir . Can I have look at the timetable please ? 
 Is flight ZW203 a direct one ? 
 No . Is there any direct flight to New York ? 
 I am looking for a pan . 
 A big one would be nice . 
 Oh , yes , I like that one , but it's too heavy . 
 Oh , yes ! This is much better . But it has an aluminum handle . 
 Yes . That's perfect . I'll take it . 
 Oh , wait a minute . What about a lid for the pan ? 
 Do you rent cameras here ? 
 I want one that is easy to handle . 
 That's good . What's the fee ? 
 Just give me a second . I'll be right up . I ran a virus scan on your computer , and it turns out that you have a lot of infected files ! 
 Well , you have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly , yours wasn't up to date , that ’ s probably what was causing your problems . 
 Yeah , try not to kick or hit the computer ! 
 I really need to lose some weight . I should go on a diet . 
 Wow ! You are much skinnier since the last time I saw you . 
 How did you do it ? 
 I hate working out . 
 Good idea . Then the trainer will help me to make a fitness plan . Besides that , what's your secret ? 
 Let's see now . Cut the potatoes into small cubes . 
 On the bottom shelf in the cupboard under the sink . 
 Donna ? Well . She is about 20 . She is very lovely and I think you will like her . What about Paul ? 
 Could you get me the pepper from the cupboard ? 
 It's in the small one beside the cooker . 
 Oh , there Isn't ? Oh , no . 
 Yes , go straight along Beijing Road and turn right . 
 No , it's just a couple of minutes . 
 You're welcome . 
 Just a moment , please . I ’ ll see if she ’ s free . 
 Sorry , Becky can ’ t come to the phone right now . 
 Good afternoon , may I help you ? 
 May I have your name , please ? 
 Yes , I see . We will cancel your order . 
 Let's see . That would be ¥ 160 a day a mile . 
 Do you have a valid license ? 
 Fine . Now complete this form and sign your name at the bottom . 
 Good morning . I'd like to pay my bill . 
 In cash . How much is the total charge ? 
 Here you are . Thanks for your wonderful service . 
 Have you heard the news ? 
 Deborah had her baby last week . 
 I thought you heard . 
 She was a cute 8 pounds 6 ounces . 
 I know , you should really go and see her and the baby . 
 I just wanted to let you know what happened . 
 I'm afraid it's bad news for you . You haven't got the position . 
 I'm afraid so . I'm terribly sorry . 
 He's the only one of the several to decide this . 
 I don't think the thing can be that serious . You should face the result . Besides , I don't think the position is the best for you . 
 Keep working hard , and then you will get another chance of promotion someday . 
 One to the beach . How much is it ? 
 Sorry . I can wait a moment . 
 Thank you . 
 I think I can , Kate . It must be Karen Marsh , the actress . 
 That must be Conrad Reeves . 
 No , He must be her fourth or fifth . 
 She does , doesn ’ t she ! I read she ’ s twenty-nine , but she must be at least forty . 
 She was a famous actress when I was still a schoolgirl . 
 Not that long ago ! I ’ m not more than twenty-nine myself . 
 It really depends on you . 
 If I were you , I'd buy . 
 Hi . This is Taylor Wright calling . I ’ Ve got an appointment with Doctor Bell at 9.00 tomorrow morning . I ’ Ve got to cancel this appointment . My father-in-law passed away suddenly last night . 
 Thanks a lot . Good bye . 
 This one . It is of the best quality and excellently tailored as well . You may try it on . 
 The collar ? It is just the collar that is popular with young people in Shanghai . 
 250 Yuan . 
 But it is really worthwhile . 
 Here you are . 
 It's time for you to wake up . 
 I'm sorry , but it's time for you to get ready for school . 
 You're not going to get up in five minutes if I let you fall back asleep . 
 There's a lot that you need to do this morning . 
 I would like for you to not be late for school . 
 Go back to sleep then , but only five more minutes . 
 May I ask you how much this position pays per year ? 
 What kind of benefits does this job have ? 
 What type of vacation time do we get ? 
 Do we have a 401K ? 
 What type of professional development do you offer ? 
 Where do I sign up for my benefits package ? 
 Oh dear , my weight has gone up again . 
 And I suppose sitting at the desk all day at the office doesn't help . 
 I do wish I could lose weight . 
 I've tried diets before but they've never worked . 
 Yes , maybe I should . 
 No , I am afraid we don't . 
 No , thanks . We'll come back later . May I reserve a table for two ? 
 Bruce . By the way . Can we have a table by the window ? 
 That's fine . 
 Well , I prefer active rather than passive training . For example , I like the training offered by a financial software company from which we bought the newest updated virgin . They sent the programmers to demonstrate how to do and then ask us to practice . All employees receiving this training were in the same meeting room , so we could communicate with each other . We had a lot of fun learning together . It helps to build up the work relation among colleagues . 
 Of course , it is much better than just giving us some reading materials or information via the internet . 
 what are you watching on the telly ? 
 which one is that ? 
 I've seen the British version and loved it , but have never seen the American version . 
 what are you watching now ? 
 I can't stand American Idol ! I think it's really over-rated . 
 have you got satellite , cable , or digital TV ? 
 do you watch a lot of TV then ? 
 I don't have a TV at home , so I rarely watch anything . Is there anything worth watching after the office ? 
 why not ? I don't have anything better to do ! 
 No , thanks . I'm just looking . 
 No , thank you . I don't need any skirts . 
 No , thank you . 
 No doubt . Look , I'm just browsing . If I need your help , I'll let you know . 
 You say your products are aimed at the green consumer . In what ways are they environmentally-friendly ? 
 What about the packaging ? 
 Excuse me , Alex ? 
 I was wondering if you could get together with me to go over the payroll . 
 I don't know about you , but I'm famished . Are you interested in getting a bite to eat ? 
 I'd love something spicy . Maybe we could get some Sichuan Hotpot . 
 Sure . If I could , I would eat hotpot every day ! 
 Well , let's stop dragging our feet and find a Sichuan Hotpot restaurant for dinner ! 
 Well ... ? Have you thought of it yet ? 
 Never mind . There's an authentic tasting hotpot restaurant not far from the China World Trade Towers on Chang An Street . Have you been there ? 
 You really have a bid head , don't you ! 
 I'm sorry , that's bad luck . 
 Sure . If you want to stretch your legs , a good exercise is to lift your knee in front of your body , like this . It ’ s a very simple exercise , but very effective . 
 One good way is to do push-ups . Another way is to use weights . Make sure you grip the weights firmly . You don ’ t want to drop them on your feet ! 
 You don ’ t need to bend your elbows that much . Bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle . The most important think is to remember to keep your body straight . Many people bend their bodies at the waist , which reduces the effectiveness of the exercise . 
 One that I recommend is that you lie on your back . You should have a weight in each hand and stretch your arms out either side of your body . 
 Yes , you do . Lift the weight up , keeping your arms straight all the time . 
 May I help you ? 
 Sure.Please sign your name here ... and here . 
 Thanks.How would you like them ? 
 Room reservations . Can I help you ? 
 What kind of room do you have in mind ? 
 Hold on , please . ... I'm afraid we're fully booked.The only room available at the moment is a suite . 
 Look , who's here , Peter ! 
 Just got back.Good to see you ! 
 Are you going to the annual party ? I can give you a ride if you need one . 
 The pleasure is mine . 
 Sure . We're on a pretty tight schedule , but we should be able to finish it just on time . 
 A few of the graphic designers are a bit behind in their work because of computer problems . 
 They've agreed to work over-time until it's finished . They've even decided to come in on the weekend . 
 We agreed that the deadline was next Friday . 
 That'd be very helpful . An extra weekend is all they really need . Thanks . 
 I will . 
 You , too ! See you tomorrow . 
 Hold on please ... Yes , you are booked already . 
 I am sorry.Flight LJ88 0n that day is full . What about 22 ? 
 Good afternoon . I am Mr . Brown , the Import manager of Atlantic Industries Ltd , Sidney , Australia . This is my card . 
 Nice to see you , Mrs . Anderson . 
 Thank you . 
 I ’ d prefer coffee if you don ’ t mind . 
 No , it ’ s the fourth time . 
 Yes , a great deal . The business scope has been broadened , and there are more visitors than ever before . 
 Oh , yes . Quite a bit . But we are especially interested in your products . 
 Women ’ s dresses . They are fashionable and suit Australian women well , too . If they are of high quality and the prices are reasonable , we ’ ll purchase large quantities of them . Will you please quote us a price ? 
 Hello , there . What can we do for you today ? 
 Yes , that's right . We have just introduced the program , but it's very popular already . 
 Right again . We can provide a tailored consultation service for you , giving you the latest quotes from the Stock Exchange and help you to plan what exactly you do with your investments . 
 Certainly , Sir . Via phone or Internet , any time , any place . 
 Working . Why ? 
 I ’ m sorry , Melissa . I really can ’ t today . I ’ Ve just got too much going on . Maybe tomorrow . 
 What would you like to know , Mr . Green ? 
 In 2004 , I got a job in the sales department of a trading company near Guangzhou . I started a sales representative . A year later , I was promoted to the position of sales manager . I had that job ever since , which is just over a year now . 
 Frankly , some part of it I enjoy very much , but I prefer something more professional . It happens that I have a friend working here in this company . She told me the export department was to recruit an assistant . I felt very excited at this news . That's why I'm here . 
 Yes.what can I do for you ? 
 Fine , what time do you want to get up ? 
 Hello , I've got to get up early tomorrow , so please give me a wake-up call . 
 Actually , I need two calls , one at 7 and the other at 7 fifteen . 
 Wait a minute ! I don't like 7 fifteen , now that I think about it . Change it to 7 thirty . 
 Nothing that I can think of right now . If something comes up , though , I'll call you . 
 I just received a phone call for an interview next week . 
 thank you , but I'm nervous . I don't know what to do.Could you tell me what should I do before an interview ? 
 yeah , besides my personal introduction , what else should I prepare ? 
 then what should I do when I'm being interviewed ? 
 are there any other things I should pay attention to ? 
 Excuse me , sir . Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 All right . How much would you like to change ? 
 Pardon ? 
 I'm sorry , sir , after 7 
 I'm afraid we cannot help you , sir , because that would be violating the regulations . I owe an apology for doing nothing about it . 
 Where to , sir . 
 Star Hotel . OK . 
 About 20 minutes . 
 How much is the fare ? 
 Excuse me . We ordered too much . May we take the food home ? 
 Do I have to pay extra charge for that ? 
 Well , then , will you put this and that into doggie bags ? 
 Thanks . Would you give me another favor ? 
 Some more Chinese tea for us , please . 
 What's your ideal boss ? 
 Hello . I'm leaving . Here is my key . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Well , most of my time here was pleasant . And New York itself is fantastic . 
 Wow ! What ’ s the hold up ? 
 Really ? Then , I guess I won ’ t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ? 
 I ’ m not too worried about it . I always seem to find something . 
 It is a way to make a living , but beyond this it's a way of fulfilling one's development . It can prove your ability . 
 I left the job because of expiry of my employment contract . Besides I have accumulated a lot of experience in this sort of job . I want to seek better jobs . 
 Is it a Chinese New Year's gift or a birthday gift ? 
 Oh , I see . Let me guess ... something sexy for the new bride on her first night of marriage ? 
 Well-endowed ? Don't worry . I have some bras with bigger cup sizes in the back . 
 I'm off today . 
 It's a pleasure to meet you . My name is Lucy . 
 Yes , I'm from Salt Lake City . 
 I'm glad to hear that . I think it's the nicest city in the United States . 
 Oh , dear ! 
 It's not what I asked for . 
 It's not the right material . Or the right color . I can't possibly accept it . 
 Good morning , sir . Welcome to Flower Hotel . 
 How many pieces of baggage do you have ? 
 Surely , of course . 
 Yes , I am James Mason from Anderson and Associates Limited . I would like to see Mr . Smith . 
 Yes , he knows I'm coming . Our meeting is set for 2 o'clock . 
 Sure . 
 That would be very nice . Thank you . 
 Good day . Welcome to IBA , what can I assist you with today ? 
 That's no trouble , Sir . 
 Yes , that's just one of the services we offer in our Personal Financing Program . 
 For every transaction you make , a statement will be drawn up and can be posted to you or sent via e-mail , or if you want to be double sure we can do both . 
 There are something wrong with my computer . 
 The computer doesn't work when I push the power cotton . 
 Yes , I don't know why it doesn't work this time . 
 Yeah ! 
 OK , I'll expected you around 2 o'clock ? 
 Hello , could you tell me my test results ? 
 Are you saying that all my results were normal ? 
 How will I know what the results mean on the website ? 
 Will the numbers mean anything to me ? 
 Can I see all of my test results at once ? 
 What do you want to eat today ? 
 No need ! I know how to make dumplings . Let's do it from scratch . Can you give me a hand in the kitchen ? I don't think I can finish everything by myself . 
 Just trim vegetables for cooking . I will cut up the meat . 
 Yeah , you are my good helper , Steven . 
 What would you like to order ? 
 Did you want it with cheese ? 
 Did you want anything to drink ? 
 What kind of soda can I get you ? 
 What else would you like ? 
 Anything else ? 
 What are you working on ? 
 What budget ? 
 How much money can you spend ? 
 Why only $ 300 ? 
 For what ? 
 Your budget is a good idea . 
 Hello , Dana Okro . 
 Oh , yes . Hi , how are you ? 
 Actually , I'm really swamped right now and I'll be going into a meeting in a few minutes . Is there any literature you can send me ? 
 Let's do this . Since I'm not sure when I'll get a chance to read the material , why don't I give you a call if I have any questions . Now , I'm really sorry , but I have to get going to this meeting . 
 Sounds good . 
 No problem . Bye , bye . 
 Yes . But he is meeting a client . 
 I am afraid not , but I think I could convey your leave to him after the client goes . 
 Good morning . I'd like to buy 2 tickets . 
 I didn't know you have student tickets so I left them in my bag . 
 Here is the money . 
 I'm fine , thanks . Just trying to get adjusted . It's hard to keep track of everything around here . 
 Yeah . I just got here a couple of days ago . How about you ? 
 That's all right.We ' ll get used to it.Besides , it is quiet up there . 
 And there's no one living over us . 
 Yes , it's pretty bright in there and big enough for our children to play . 
 The stove and refrigerator are in good working order , 
 Are the plumbing all right ? 
 The toilet flushes and the shower has hot and cold water 
 The place is OK . Let's go there and have a look at it again . 
 Hey , look . My admirer has struck again . 
 It's an e-mail . It says , We need to meet . I'll give you a sweet treat . It's not what you think . 
 You know what , I think I know who my admirer is . 
 Honey , how is by you ? 
 Why aren't you doing your homework ? 
 Oh , is it ? You'll be making records next , will you ? 
 You'd better get on with your homework ! You can practice on Sunday . 
 I certainly could . You'll get exams next month . 
 Oh , don't you ? God save me ! 
 Good morning . 
 I'm phoning about the job that was in the paper last night . 
 Oh , Candida Fawcett . 
 Well , I just thought that it was right up my street you know . 
 Yes , arm , I'm 23 . I've been working abroad , I'm um ... 
 You ’ re free to leave . 
 What are you planning on doing now ? 
 What are you going to major in ? 
 I don ’ t want to see you back here . 
 I don ’ t think this place is for you . 
 I wish you luck . 
 Good morning . 
 Yes , we do . How can I help ? I can give you a simple introduction , if you'd like ? 
 We usually recommend our clients buy US Dollar Traveller's Cheques , as they can be exchanged for local currency all over the world . They are certainly the most versatile . 
 As soon as you purchase your Traveller's Cheques from us , you are covered . No matter if you lose them or they are stolen , we will replace them promptly . All we ask is for you to write down the reference number of each cheque and keep it in a safe place away from the actual cheques . We will need that number if you need to make a claim . 
 What are you and Corey doing for Valentine ’ s Day this Friday ? 
 You have to do something romantic . 
 Well , you have three kids , so you knew what it meant once upon a time ! 
 Now please tell me something about your past work achievements . 
 That is quite an achievement ! Do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ? 
 Have you received any honors ? 
 Do you have any publications ? 
 I believe that you called me ? 
 Why did you call me ? 
 Did he do something wrong ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 That's really not like him . 
 I apologize , and I'll make sure he doesn't do that again . 
 Catherine , have you ever seen the movie Fast Food Nation ? 
 It's very thought-provoking , isn't it ? 
 So what do you think of the American fast food culture ? 
 And everyone knows that Americans ' favorite food is the hamburger , isn't it ? 
 But I think some healthy menu options are also served at fast food restaurants .. 
 Such as fat-free milk , whole-wheat rolls and fish sandwich . 
 But I'm not sure if they're well-rcceived . 
 Well , Americans may need to find a way to make the most of their fast foods . 
 You ran into my car . 
 You messed up my car . 
 My rear bumper is messed up . 
 It's smashed in . 
 The same thing is wrong with your bumper . 
 I need your information too . 
 Good morning . How can I help you ? 
 OK . Please fill in these forms and take them back when you are done . 
 OK . Can I have your original ID card and tw0 2 - inch photos ? 
 That is OK . We have photo taking service here . You may pay your fee , take a photo there and take it back here . 
 Hello , I bought the pendant in your shop , just before . 
 Now I come back to the hotel and try to show it to my friend , the pendant is broken , I'm afraid . 
 Would you change it to a new one ? 
 Yes , I do . 
 Thank you so much . 
 Yes , I need some more cash for my visit in China . May I cash a traveler ’ s check here ? 
 I was going to cash it at the hotel , but one of my friends said that banks always give better exchange rates . 
 You mean there is really not that much of a difference . 
 Well , may I cash these three checks for 100 dollars each ? I think that will be enough . 
 Ok . 
 Hello , Claire . This is Mick . 
 Fine , thanks . And you ? 
 Good . Listen . I'm phoning because I want to invite you to a party . At our Newhouse . And . . 
 Yes . We've moved . That's why we're giving the party . Can you come ? 
 This Saturday evening . 
 Until two in the morning . But you don't have to stay that long.Well ? What about it ? 
 Nothing . I mean , don't bring anything . It isn't necessary . 
 Just bring yourself ! I'm looking forward to seeingyou again . It's been a long time ! 
 Come any time after eight . All right ? . 
 Bye ! See you on Saturday evening . 
 Which services offered by your band do you use most ? 
 Do you ever ask you bank for traveller's cheques ? They are much safer than carrying lots of cash around . 
 Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills ? I use direct debit . 
 That ’ s good idea . You don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . I suppose you have a mortgage too . 
 I have a deposit account with my bank . There are some restrictions on withdrawing money , but the interest rate is much higher . 
 That ’ s great . But I prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain . 
 Yes , what is up ? 
 Sure . 
 Will I be getting any help ? 
 Where are you going , Tony ? 
 Mom said you couldn't go out . 
 I would like to buy some beef . 
 I need to get ground beef . 
 I need about four pounds . 
 Extra lean . 
 I appreciate that . 
 Thanks for your help . 
 I am sorry , sir . Can you tell me your room number ? 
 Is there anything else I can do for you ? 
 OK , we will send a repairman to your room right now . 
 I'd like to have rest , but I have many things to do . 
 It's very good , and the result isn't too bad . 
 Of course . I will write a report about this post-trip , and then you'd better type it at the moment , OK ? 
 ( Afternoon ) Miss Liu . Are you typing my report ? 
 Nothing . I just tell you take care of it when you type , especially the address and telephone number of those new guests . You should make sure that it's no mistaken . 
 Ha , I know you are great secretary . 
 I'm pleased to meet you again , Mrs . King . 
 You've had a good trip , I hope . 
 It's been a full two years since we last saw each other . 
 We shall be pleased to talk the matter over with you . You've done very well in fulfilling the agreement . 
 Yes , we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos . We can see you are experienced in this particular line . 
 But I think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in Canada is rather conservative . After all , you sold around 400 pieces there last year . You can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end . 
 500 pieces . 
 All right , let's fix it at 450 pieces then . And for every additional 50 pianos sold , we'll give you 1 % higher commission . 
 We would like to make a specific mention of one more point . As our sole distributor , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own . 
 Another thing is that every six months we would like to receive from you a detailed report on current market conditions and the users comments on our products . 
 Good , that's all then . 
 I think we have had a very pleasant conversation , haven't we ? 
 Do you have any other questions ? 
 I'm sorry we can't now . 
 Maybe the company will build dormitory for the employees in the future . 
 Anything else ? 
 I'm sorry we won't do so for a new employee . We only provide this benefit to employees who have made significant contributions to the company . 
 Yes , we will , and the staff will have a chance to travel every year . 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 Do you have a reservation , sir ? 
 Sorry , sir . That table has been reserved . This way , please . How about this one , sir ? 
 Would you like some drinks ? 
 What ? What ’ s up ? 
 Fantastic ! I ’ ll be there ! 
 Operations is made up of Manufacturing , Materials , Shipping and Distribution etc . 
 Yes , it is . 
 I don't think you really want to hear about it . 
 To be honest , it was horrible ! My manager is such a pain in the neck ! 
 Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me ! 
 There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired me for sure . 
 He treats everyone pretty badly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake ! 
 I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair ! 
 Not really . I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion . 
 I try to be sensible about it , but it's not very easy . Sometimes you just have to grin and bear it . 
 I was wondering if someone in your office could help me with a question I have about my payment . 
 My paycheck seems to be smaller than the one I received last week . 
 My old employer gave us a couple days of work during that period . 
 Of course I wrote down the work that I had done on the Continued Claim Form . 
 I am not going to show any income from now on then . 
 Jane ! What an enchanting skirt you have on ! 
 Bright colors , smooth material , exquisite craftsmanship , soft lines ... Darling , it looks elegant on you ! It can't be any cheap stuff . Something around two hundred , I guess . 
 Then you got a windfall ! Was sixty-five the original price , or did you get a special discount ? 
 How much did she ask for ? 
 She must be fuming with anger at such a bid , wasn't she ? 
 Then you pretended to go without buying it ? 
 How can we avoid the jam ? 
 OK . 
 Thank you for joining us this evening at Chez Attitude . 
 Welcome , Mr . Foster , if you would have a seat in the lounge area , our hostess will be ready to seat you in just a moment . 
 She will come and let you know when your table is prepared . 
 An outside table is available right now if you would like to be seated immediately . 
 Here is your table , and now may I take your drink order while you are considering what to have for dinner ? 
 I'll put your drink order in and be right back to get your dinner order . 
 Hello , is this Professor Clark ? 
 Hello , Professor , this is Kalina , and I am in your literature class on Monday mornings . 
 I was partying hard over the weekend , fell down the stairs , and need time to recuperate . 
 I sprained my wrist , but the doctor says it will be fine . 
 The doctor said I should be good enough to return next week . 
 I need to find a new place to live . 
 Oh , it ’ s not you . I just want my own place . 
 Jeez ... I didn ’ t realize a single bedroom apartment went for so much these days . 
 Oh , here ’ s one . It ’ s looks like its in this neighborhood , $ 600 a month . That ’ s not to bad . 
 Hello . I ’ m calling about the one bedroom in Lincoln Park . Could I take a look at it ? Yes . Tonight at six is fine . Thanks . 
 Why ? He did something wrong . 
 I only wanted to help him . 
 Reservation , may I help you ? 
 For how many people ? 
 May I have your name ? 
 Can you help me ? This fitting has come loose and I need something to tighten it up . 
 Thanks for your help . 
 You must be Mr.Sellers . I'm Steven . I am here to see the apartment you advertised . 
 Could I have a look at it first ? 
 It's nice . So this is the bathroom . And that must be the bedroom . 
 Is there air conditioning ? 
 What's the house rent ? When is the rent due ? And how much security deposit do you require ? 
 I like the apartment , Mr.Sellers . You can show me the lease . 
 It's a job I've been dreaming of since I was very little . I firmly believe that teaching is one of the most honorable jobs in the world . 
 I want to work in the English Department , as I am an English major . 
 Well , there ’ s no doubt that lots of people have found employment in the help wanted section . 
 Did you get a copy of the Herald too ? 
 That ’ s true , but still the Herald lists some jobs the Globe doesn ’ t have . 
 It's only a couple of dollars more . For that much money you can afford to risk it . 
 Good idea . 
 What did he say ? 
 What kind of intermediary is it ? 
 What job did he recommend to you ? 
 Does he ask you to pay some fees ? 
 Then what do you think about it ? 
 Sure , but you must verify that first and don't easily make a promise . 
 Good luck ! 
 Did you bring your ticket ? 
 Did you bring your ID ? 
 You're going to need your ID to pay the ticket . 
 We have to know that this ticket is really yours . 
 Next time you come back , bring your ID . 
 Yes , everything will be cleared . 
 Oh , dear ! 
 It's not what I asked for . 
 It's not the right material . Or the right color . I can't possibly accept it . 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 What kind of presents do you want ? 
 OK . How about some very cool sneakers for your children ? Anyway , it won't cost you much . It's only around $ 59.95 for each pair . It might be cheaper than that in America . 
 Just a hunch , sir . 
 $ 59.95 . 
 Sorry , sir . 
 Because in this duty-free shop , your total expenditure cannot be over $ 300 and you also have one more present to buy for your wife . 
 That's good . And I can also recommend you a good one . It's the brand of DENY . 
 It's $ 60 here . 
 Of course not , sir . 
 Ouch , it ’ s unbearable . 
 All right , doctor . But it really hurts . 
 To your offer of three hundred and twenty thousand dollars , the owners have counter-offered three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars . 
 You , of course , have two ways of responding . You can say yes or come up with another offer . 
 There is always a chance that someone could outbid you , but you could try one more offer if you like . 
 After the owners get home from work tonight , I will approach them with your offer . 
 I don ’ t think that it will take as long as the response to the first offer . 
 Who was elected ? 
 That can ’ t be true ! 
 I can ’ t believe people voted for him . 
 That doesn ’ t make any sense . 
 How could the news get any worse ? 
 That ’ s great news ! 
 I will be available on Monday or Tuesday . Choose which day is best for you . 
 Good . Can you come in the morning or would afternoon be best ? 
 Great ! When I check with the others , I will send you an exact time . When you come , be prepared to do your presentation . 
 Who would you like to see there ? Just the sub-committee or should we ask the whole committee ? 
 That will probably be best . Do you need help with directions ? 
 OK . We will e-mail you all the information you need tomorrow . Have a good day ! 
 Please , where do I catch the plane for New York ? 
 That one there ? 
 Thank you . You ' Ve been very helpful . 
 Thank you . And here's your receipt , sir . 
 I hope your stay here was satisfactory , sir . 
 I'm glad that the little problem didn't ruin your visit . Please have a pleasant trip home . 
 I was sick . 
 I had a stomachache . 
 I'm still feeling under the weather . 
 I took something earlier . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 No thanks . We just need our check . Have you seen the waitress ? 
 Yes , the service hasn't been the best . Is that our waitress over there ? 
 Good idea . Just bring it back and we'll figure it out together . 
 How much do you think we should leave for a tip ? 
 I agree , but we don't really know the whole story . There may have been problems in the kitchen beyond her control . 
 I agree . We will leave $ 3.60 for the tip . 
 Hello ? Mr . Bernie . My name is Lisa . I hope I ’ m not disturbing you . I just heard about your daughter . I wanted to call you and tell you how much we ’ ll miss her . 
 What ? That ’ s odd . I ’ m so sorry if I ’ Ve bothered you . 
 Can you please give me a hand ? I can ’ t carry the heavy box . 
 I think you are flicking through it . 
 Are you introverted or extroverted ? 
 What kind of personality do you think you have ? 
 What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ? 
 What basic principles do you apply to your life ? 
 You look really wiped out ? 
 Not a good day . I hate to tell you that Mr . Thomas wants to see the profit ’ s statement for new project tomorrow morning . 
 I'm having problems with my computer . 
 For some reason it won't turn on . 
 What connections ? 
 Will the cords keep it from turning on ? 
 I didn't think of that . 
 I think that I will , thanks . 
 So , how are you feeling today ? 
 Do you have enough time to get the right amount of sleep ? 
 What time do you usually go to bed ? 
 Have you been under a lot of stress lately ? 
 Have you ever tried doing relaxation exercises before you go to bed ? 
 So how was your interview ? 
 Don't worry . You should do fine . You have the experience . 
 Remember , they want someone who works well with people . You've got to show them how easy-going and personable you are . 
 How are you doing ? 
 I'm awesome . 
 I've been on here for like , 15 minutes . 
 Not much , I have a car . 
 I sure do . 
 I'm waiting till our President gets out of office , and the gas prices go down . 
 Good afternoon.Swiss Airline.Miss Grown speaking . Can I help you ? 
 Just a moment , please . Let me check for you . ( A moment later ) Thank you for waiting . I am sorry but our flights are fully booked on that day.The next available flight leaves at 4:00 pm on 20th . Shall I reserve you a seat on it ? 
 Hello ! How do I restock my minibar ? 
 I finished it all . 
 Send me up three bottles each of Perrier and Jim Beam . 
 The apples in my room were delicious . Bring me a few more , please . 
 You know , some grape juice would be really nice , too . 
 Could I see the manager please ? I have a complaint to make . 
 Did you have the room checked before we move in ? 
 1808 . The toilet doesn ’ t work properly . The water doesn ’ t run in the shower . 
 That ’ s not bad . Thanks for your help . 
 Who's better at chess , Bill or Fred ? 
 You said it . 
 What's the specialty of the house ? 
 I like fish . Please bring me an order of that . 
 Apple pie , please . 
 Make it two . 
 Hello . I'm here today to pay in some foreign currency . Is that possible at this counter ? 
 10,000 Japanese yen . 
 Fixed . 
 For one year , that's what I usually do . Better interest , you know . 
 I certainly hope so . Can we arrange to meet on the 27th ? That should give you enough time . 
 Fine , Mr . Tan . I ’ ll see you then . 
 I suppose so , but don't rush . I've got to tell you how to do it . 
 Hello , is this housekeeper ? 
 This is room eleven-seven and we have just checked in . 
 Our room hasn't been cleaned up yet.So would you send one of your housekeepers to clean up our room ? 
 Our room number is eleven-seven and my name is Terry Chen . 
 How do you put this seat back ? I know there is a lever somewhere . 
 I'm getting dressed , what does it look like ? 
 I'm good at this . Nobody will see anything . 
 All right , pull over at that service station and I'll dress in the ladies ' room . 
 can you help me pick out some fabric for a suit ? I'm going to get one made for a friend's wedding . 
 it depends on the price , but I was thinking of getting a wool / cashmere blend . 
 I was thinking of a brown pin-striped suit . 
 haven't you heard ? Brown is the new black . 
 that may be true , but black is so boring . Anyway , I already have three black suits . I might as well get a suit that stands out from the rest . 
 I like the one on the left , but I don't like the pattern on it . It's too much . I want a pattern that's a bit subtler . 
 I think that will do . Let's go talk to the tailor about getting it made . 
 What do you think of your personality ? 
 Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ? 
 How do you get along with people whose characters are different from your own ? 
 Ok , I ’ Ve got an up-to-day map . Let ’ s check the route from here to the airport . 
 No , we turn right . Remember that we are coming from this direction . 
 How far is that ? 
 According to the map , we get off the M11 at the second junction and join the M25 . That ’ s the motorway that goes around the edge of London . 
 Then we drive west on the M25 . we must be careful to turn in the right direction ! 
 Then we take the first Heathrow Airport . What ’ s the total distance ? 
 22 miles to the M25 , 33 miles on the M25 , and 3 after that . That ’ s a total of 58 miles , isn ’ t it ? 
 We can only go fast on the motor ways if there isn ’ t much traffic . I think we should allow ourselves plenty of time to get there . Being early is much better than being late . 
 Of course . 
 Do you take dressing on your salad ? 
 How about your grades of study ? 
 Besides your major , do you know some in other fields ? 
 Have you ever been a student leader ? 
 Did it affect you much ? 
 Where did you work in the past ? 
 What's your title in the company ? 
 I am checking out . Here is the key to my room . 
 Thanks . 
 This hotel could use some insecticide , but my time in New York was thoroughly delightful . 
 do you have s second ? 
 I want to tell you I've put in my notice . 
 I've been thinking about this for several months , well before the Spring Festival holidays . 
 yeah , after receiving my yearly bouns , I want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market . I've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and I still haven't received 
 that's exactly why I decided to quit the job and find a new one . 
 that's right . I am not the only one who has done this . Job hopping is quite common in the IT industry . 
 I want to take a photograph . 
 I like one taken half length . 
 I ’ d like to have this cashed , please . 
 Yes . 
 Ten hundreds and Ten Twenties and the rest of small changes please . 
 Cathy , I'd like to introduce the new microwave stove of mine to you , because it is easy to use . 
 This microwave stove has many functions . Let me show you . For example , if you want to cook meat , you just need to put meat in it , and press the button with a picture of meat , that ’ s OK . After several minutes , you can eat the delicious meat . 
 Oh , it is not so expensive . It only costs me 280 dollars . 
 Yes , I know . The boarding time on the ticket says 17:05 , and now it's 16:15 . I guess we have plenty of time . 
 Yes.It ' s essential . 
 We can check it and hand carry the small bags . And we have to open each for inspection . 
 I think so.We certainly don't want a hijack to happen on the plane today . 
 Very well . We have some fresh red roses . 
 $ 20 per dozen . 
 Yes , they're on sale today . 
 Splendid . Will there be anything else ? 
 I'm sure your wife will love them . 
 Here are some biscuits . Why are you back so early today ? 
 Me what ? 
 It's not for us . 
 Don't be a smarty-pants . It's for Grandma Wang . 
 It's for Grandma Wang . She is sick and her only daughter went abroad weeks ago . So she needs our help . 
 Umm , let me think for a moment . We can meet her together after I finish cooking . 
 Good boy . I can only imagine how happy she will be to see you . 
 I was worried you would think it was too far to drive . 
 I think if you try some more authentic Chinese food , you might understand how we students from Taiwan suffer . 
 I mean , in Milwaukee there is no good Chinese food.So we miss the food in Taiwan too much.Sometimes we just have to drive down here to Chicago to find something better . 
 Yes , even in the winter . 
 Why not ? I've been craving good food for three weeks now . I'm too sick of hamburgers and pizza ! 
 Don't tease me ! Good food is really important to Chinese ! 
 Yes , all these dishes are different " dim sum " dishes.You can't find this kind of thing except for in a few cities in America . 
 Of course . I will try to buy some things at the Asian grocery down the block too.Then I can do a little cooking in my apartment . 
 No way ! 
 We're going up to the " new " Chinatown for dinner . I already know where we're going to go . 
 No , dim sum is usually eaten around lunch time , or sometimes closer to breakfast.We ' ll try more Taiwanese style up at the " new " Chinatown . 
 No , dim sum is more Cantonese style.But of course you can buy it in Taiwan . 
 I'm a great cook actually . You will see . 
 It's not that far . Do you see that Yellow building over there ? 
 The big one . 
 It's right next to it , on the right . 
 I don't think there's one around here . The closest one is on 3rd street , but that's probably closed now . 
 Well , you could go down to 22nd street . There are lot of stores down there that are open 24 hours a day . 
 Yes , but that'll probably take about half an hour . You should just take a cab . 
 No , from here I think it's only about 5 dollars . 
 Certainly , Mr . Robert . But can I have your plan ? 
 Very good . May I keep it ? I need it to draw up a notice of the meeting and the agenda . 
 You mean you need a more detailed agenda for yourself ? 
 I see . Ok , then where do you think we will have the meeting ? 
 Yes , I will see that the room is ready by Friday . And I will check there are enough chairs , and the lighting and air-conditioning are all right . 
 Sure , I will . What about the minutes ? Do you think I am responsible for that too ? 
 But I am not familiar with the members of the board . 
 That's a good idea . All right , I ’ ll withdraw and get down to it if you don't mind . 
 The exact time ? Let me think . You know , it happened at night . 
 Oh , I remember . It was about 10 o'clock . When I was about to go to bed , suddenly I heard help outside . 
 Yes , I worked in a fashion shop as a part time salesgirl . 
 I'm working as an export sales staff member for a trade company . 
 I work at Yangshi Trade Company Ltd . I have been working there since 1997 . 
 No problem . Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer , and you're good to go . 
 Hmm . Well , we have some alternatives , if you're interested . 
 We have a computer lab on the first floor . 
 It's absolutely free to guests . Except for printing , of course . 
 You could use your wireless right here in our lobby . 
 Well , we don't have a printer in the lobby yet . You'll have to use the lab . 
 What ’ s the matter ? Didn ’ t you get enough sleep last night ? 
 Are you worried about something ? Why couldn ’ t you sleep ? 
 Well , take it easy . Things will look better tomorrow . Maybe you should try exercising or a hot bath to help you relax . 
 Mr . Li , the report has been finished . 
 You're welcome . This is my duty . Anything else ? 
 OK , I'll do it right now . 
 Yes , I get it . 
 Dad , do you know where Mom is ? 
 She'd better not start crying like she usually does . 
 Dad , now don't you go getting mush on me . 
 That means a lot to me Dad . Thanks . 
 Well , sir . We are asking all our guests to wear a jacket and a tie in our restaurant . 
 I am sorry ; you can't borrow a jacket and a tie . 
 Certainly , what time will you come back ? 
 How many in your party ? 
 Alright , we are waiting for you at 7 . 
 How much is the fare , please ? 
 Wait . I want to ask you if this bus goes down Fifth Avenue as far as Greenwich Village . 
 I thought this bus Went down Park Avenue . 
 But I thought this was the right bus to go to Washington Square Park . 
 Would you tell me when we get there ? 
 How do you spend your free time ? 
 Are you introverted or extroverted ? 
 What kinds of sports do you like ? 
 What kind of personality do you think you have ? 
 I need to eat something . 
 I know , but I'm hungry again . 
 I think I'm going to go make myself a snack . 
 I'm not exactly sure . 
 I have no idea what kind of sandwich I want to make . 
 I'm going to do that . 
 Waiter , bring me the menu , will you ? 
 I'd like to see the menu . Would you get me one , please ? 
 Thank you . Ah ! But this is in French . Would you mind giving me the English menu ? 
 Thanks . I'll need a while to choose . Could you come back in a minute ? 
 I'm sorry , I haven't decided yet . Do you mind giving me a couple of minutes ? 
 May I help you ? 
 Yes , is there a problem ? Ma ’ am ? 
 You know we went great lengths to promote the sales of your products . Through our continuous effort , consumers tend to accept your product . So , there will be a potential market for your product in this area , and would you let us act as your agent ? 
 If that's the case , we can talk about it first . What's your concept of a big amount ? 
 I'm afraid that's too much for us . 
 All right , we accept the challenge . What about the commission ? You know , we usually get a 20 % commission of the amount on every deal . 
 You may have known that we have competitors from South Korea and other countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to have the market investigation and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in newspaper and TV programs . A 20 % commission will not leave us much . 
 Oh , that's pitiful . 
 Ok . I should have it finished by Friday afternoon . Then I can check those account over the weekend . We need to have them finished by Monday , right ? 
 Some next week on , we should be in less of a rush . 
 Don ’ t say that yet . A new project could suddenly appear . 
 Carol said that she would spend some time checking that everyone is up-to-date with their work . 
 They usually go on for ages . 
 I will . Enjoy your meeting ! 
 They asked me to go to Paris to check on the new office that was just established there . And you ? 
 Teach me Cantonese and I'll pull some strings to get a trade with you next time around . 
 You're on . 
 I'm scheduled to fly out on the tenth . 
 Tell me where you live . 
 You can catch the 264 . 
 Yes , it does . 
 You can catch it on Altadena Drive . 
 Yes , it does . 
 You're welcome . 
 Yes , I can . I have three years experience in operating computers . 
 I can skillfully use Dos , Windows . 
 Yes , I have ACRE certificate , rank 2 . 
 Yes , I have a Cambridge Business English Certificate and Lawyer ’ s Qualification Certificate . 
 I like photography very much . I used to be awarded second prize in a photography contest at our university . 
 Cardiopulmonary resuscitation ! 
 What does that mean ? 
 Me ! Me ! 
 Wait , what are you doing ? I ’ m a married woman ! You can ’ t just try to kiss me like this ! 
 Well , OK . But no French kissing ! 
 Wait , what are you doing ! You can ’ t just kiss me then go for second base ! 
 Hi , David . You are very difficult to reach . I called several times . But I kept getting a busy signal . Is your phone out of order ? 
 Ok . Let me call you later . Is that okay ? 
 Excuse me , can I have a look at the green coat ? 
 Yes , I like the style.Can I try this on ? 
 Excuse me . I need to refill this prescription . 
 Yes , I need to refill it today . 
 I was worried about that . I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not . 
 Listen . This is an emergency . I tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . So I can't see him in time . I need this medicine . It is for skin condition . I've run out.Can you just refill it once more ? 
 But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription . 
 But I have a prescription . I just need more of it . 
 Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor.It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor . 
 This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it . 
 Why don't you sit down and relax , darling ? 
 Well , come over and talk to me then . 
 May I turn on the TV then ? 
 So that we can sit down together and listen to some music . 
 I will , but let's go to the disco after dinner . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Certainly . What about moon cake ? It's typical Chinese food . 
 The moon cake is round and looks like the full moon . That's why it's called the moon cake and the moon cake symbolizes family reunion and harmony . 
 All the moon cakes are generally classified into two styles , Cantonese style and Suzhou style . 
 The skin of Cantonese style cakes is soft and puffy with heavy stuffing while the skin of Suzhou style cakes is puffy filled with fragrant nuts . 
 OK , here you are . 
 The paper editorials always stick to the quick . 
 After all , I'm somewhat conservative . 
 What's up ? Honey ! 
 Honey , it doesn't matter . The key to play volleyball is to cooperate with each other . 
 You go figure it out yourself . 
 OK , Ben and May , here we go . Be careful , Danny , the ball is coming . That is the green one . 
 Danny , back to your position . Move ! 
 What's the matter ? 
 Oh , you have to take the shuttle to Grand Central . 
 It's not on this platform . These trains are uptown and downtown , not crosstown . You have to go up these stairs over there . 
 But of course ! We have a great exercise facility . 
 It's located right under our lobby . Just take the elevator or the stairs one flight down . 
 No , sir . The gym is absolutely free . However , be sure to take your room key with you . 
 The hours couldn't be better , 24/7 . 
 I wish I could tell you yes , but no , there isn't . 
 I'd like to buy a new mobile phone please . 
 Yes please . And I ’ d like to be able to make video calls too . 
 Of course I know . 
 OK . I'll go right now . By the way , do you think I ’ ll have to stay in the hospital for long ? 
 Thank you , Doctor . I will go now . Bye-bye . 
 Sir , I am very glad to tell that we have successfully registered the trademark for our new product . It is the time to think of some effective promoting strategies . We are beginning to get more attention from overseas . 
 OK , Let me see . I suppose we must strengthen our promotion , because our brand is still new to some consumers . Maybe we should start our advertising program with our local and overseas distributors simultaneously , because they stand on a better position for selecting the best ways to advertise in market places . Besides , the advertisement fund can encourage them to spend more attention on advertising our products . 
 Yes , the mass media has wider influence . One of my classmates works in an advertisement company . I can get help and inspiration from him . And we can also try some less expensive approaches of advertising , such as on-line sales . Personally , I prefer to the on-line sales , for it is cheaper , faster and wider . 
 Sure . Wait a moment . 
 This is Ryan you are speaking with . What can I do for you ? 
 What is wrong with you ? 
 How long have you had it ? 
 How have you been treating it ? 
 That should work . I ’ ll see you tomorrow when you return to work . 
 Oh , Thank you . I'm looking for the train station . 
 Right ? OK , got it . 
 Next left then right ? OK . 
 What ’ s going on ? 
 What aren ’ t you too sure about ? 
 Your lease is for three years . 
 If you do , I will keep your deductible . 
 If you break the contract , then you will not receive your deductible . 
 All right . I ’ m glad I could clarify things for you . 
 Anything wrong with it ? 
 Oh , I'm very sorry about that . You can change it for another one if you prefer . 
 This one is the same size and color . But the design is different . 
 What ? What ’ s the good news ? 
 That ’ s wonderful ! You must be really proud of him ! 
 I'm very worried , doctor 
 I'm afraid that I'm very ill . 
 Because I feel tired all the time , even when I wake up in the morning . I find very difficult to do any work . I have no appetite . My wife cooks me delicious meals but I can only eat a little . 
 Very badly , doctor . 
 Both , doctor . I never get to sleep until two o'clock and I always wake up at five . 
 Well , yes , I am . I'm worried about my work . I've just taken a new job . I earn a lot of money but it's difficult work . I'm always afraid of making a mistake . 
 Yes , doctor . ( The doctor examines the patient ) 
 No , doctor . I never have enough time for exercise . I start work very early in the morning and finish late in the evening . Then I can't get to sleep . Can you give me some medicine to help me to sleep ? 
 But I may lose my job , doctor ! It's hard to get a job like mine . 
 You're right , doctor . It's more important to be healthy than wealthy . I'll change my job . I'm grateful for your advice . 
 Could you call Mr . Jacob for me , Sara ? I need to go over some stuff with him . 
 Sure , it ’ s 4-8- 7-2 . Don ’ t worry . You ’ re doing a fine job . 
 Well , Randy , I'd say you've got a bad case of the flu . The main thing to do is get plenty of rest and drink lots of liquids . I'll prescribe something for that throat . 
 Some aspirin or Panadol should help . You can pick some up at the pharmacy when you go to fill your prescription . 
 Goodbye , Randy . Take care . 
 Yes , what are your hours ? 
 Thanks lot . 
 Good idea . How much do I need to deposit ? 
 And how do I withdraw if I need to ? 
 I'm sorry , refresh my mind . What's different about a Type B Account ? 
 May I help you ? 
 What dose she look like ? 
 What was she wearing ? 
 When did you last see her ? 
 How long has it been ? 
 Good morning , Mr . Huang . It's a pleasure to meet you again . 
 Thank you . Can I meet my colleagues ? 
 Hi , Steven , welcome to join us ! 
 That ’ s right . Just call me if you need anything . 
 Well , as the other guys are still not in , I ’ ll introduce you to them later . 
 You are late . 
 Couldn't get connection ? 
 Really ? I didn't know . Let me check . You're right . 
 It's a serious problem . I make expecting an important call . The theater is guilty . It supposed to call me this evening , and discuss my play . What were happened if they can't reach me ? 
 What did you cook ? 
 Great idea ! As long as I don't get food poisoning ! So what is on the menu tonight ? 
 This is delicious ! The ginger and lemongrass really gives it a nice taste ! 
 This is delicious ! The combination of sour and spicy is really interesting ! I could have this everyday ! 
 Wow , this is great ! I never knew Thai food was so creative and delicious ! 
 I'm stuffed ! 
 No where special . I was just taking a walk . 
 To get a little exercise . I'm so out of shape . 
 That sounds great . Give me a call next time you guys play . 
 What's the problem ? 
 Is there a problem ? 
 I apologize for their tardiness . 
 Again , I do apologize for the inconvenience . 
 Seeing as they were late , that won't be a problem . 
 I'm going to refund your money right now . 
 Here , sir . Sit down in this wheel chair . 
 The doctor will be with you in a moment . I just need to ask you a few questions . 
 Name , age and date of birth , please ? 
 Health insurance company and policy No ? 
 What ? 
 Well , this is going to be a very expensive broken leg , Mr . Taylor . 
 I'm terrible sorry . I seem to have mislaid your MP4 . 
 Very sorry that I have caused you so much trouble . 
 Won't you let me buy a new one tomorrow ? 
 Please accept my deep apology . 
 How would you describe your relationship with our boss ? 
 What do you think his strengths are ? 
 It ’ s time to get up . 
 You shouldn ’ t stay up so late watching TV . I told you we had to get an early start . 
 Do you want to eat breakfast here ? 
 Ok by me . 
 That's right . I'm glad you're here . It hasn't been working properly for the last few days . 
 Just a couple of weeks ago . It's usually very reliable . 
 Well , it's making a strange noise when we try to change paper trays . 
 I don't know , but he gives me the creeps . 
 But what if he knows my name , where I live ... 
 Actually , he's really good-looking . Too bad he's a weirdo . 
 Now he's looking over here ! He's coming ! 
 All right , Mr . Crane , when will you be arriving in the city ? 
 Only 25 minutes or so . We ’ ll send somebody to meet you . That ’ s 11:30 a . m . Friday the 15th ? 
 Excuse me , I'm looking for your casual short-sleeved shirts . Can you tell me where those are ? 
 Medium . 
 Thank you . I think I'll take this one , and these pants as well . They're a present for a friend . 
 Yes , please . 
 Well , What seems to be the trouble , Mr . Williams ? 
 How long has this been going on ? 
 How was your appetite ? 
 You haven't lost any weight , have you ? 
 Unbutton your shirt , please . 
 You'll have to have some laboratory examinations to know for sure . 
 A blood test and during test . You can come back next week , say 4 pm to see the results . 
 The thing is , I've got all of this information here , all of these leaflets , but I can't make head nor tail of them ! 
 I'm not sure which would be better for me ; buying some insurance or putting my money in a Savings Deposit . 
 I was thinking of around 10,000 RIB . 
 And for the Savings Deposit ? 
 Wow ! A third more ? Very good . 
 My name is Han Ran , number is 050920 . 
 I ’ m from Living , Yunnan Province . 
 It's a very beautiful place in Southwest China . 
 Not very big . There are five of us — grandmother , father , mother , sister and I . 
 No . I'm still single . 
 Exactly what ? 
 What's the matter ? 
 What happened before ? 
 Oh , no . That's bad news . 
 Will you lose all your files ? 
 You're smart . 
 Did you call for a car service 
 Not at the moment . Where would you like me to take you 
 Well , it's a long way and there is roadwork near Broadway . I am not sure I can snake it in half an hour . 
 All right , I will try my best . If there aren ’ t any holdups , I think we can get there in time . 
 About $ 25 , tips not included . 
 Oh , yes , sure . Let me put it in the boot . 
 Not at all . Bang the door , please . 
 You are in luck . The traffic is not heavy today . 
 The supreme goal of ours is to be in the leadership in marketing . 
 Yes . We can make great efforts to make it become true as long as we have a clear goal . 
 I'm not sure . 
 Really ? I'm sorry . I did not know that . 
 Why can't you just let me off with a warning ? 
 How much is the fine ? 
 I have to be at court ? 
 All right . Just give me the ticket . 
 Yes ! Thank goodness you ’ re here.These bugs are driving us crazy ! 
 We just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything . We have termites in the wood , cockroaches all over the place , and last night I saw a huge rat out in the backyard ! 
 No problem , just get rid of the bugs ! 
 yes , I was in my apartment in Beijing . Where were you ? 
 really ? Did you see the hijacked planes crash into and destroy the twin towers ? 
 that must have been horrible . Did you go out at all that day to see what was going on ? 
 did you know anyone who worked in the World Trade Center ? 
 did he survive ? 
 I'm sorry . That must have really been a nightmarish day for you and your family . 
 terrorist acts are deliberate and deadly and can affect every walk of life . 
 Yes .

 In the Golden Mountain Hotel in Beijing . 
 Yes . 
 Greg . I want to speak to you for a minute . 
 I ’ m afraid there is , Greg . I don ’ t mind you taking a break . But you ’ Ve been away from your desk for twenty-five minutes already . 
 Excuse me . I'm looking for an old music box . 
 Something made in the ' 20s would be nice . 
 Are dancing figures a part of any of the boxes ? 
 Oh , these are great . I think I'll take this one . 
 Now , does this come with a warranty ? 
 That doesn't surprise me . 
 Why not go to the supermarket today , the coupon will be past due in three days . 
 Let me check . Yes , we can . 
 I've read your report , and I'm not sure I agree with you.You think you can get attendance improved by requiring salaried employees to take their all of their sick days ? 
 We give them 10 or 15 sick days per year . Surely requiring people to take them couldn't possibly help . It sounds like a counter - productive policy change to me . 
 I see . So our current policies are encouraging sick people to come to work , resulting in more sick employees . 
 Let's give it a shot ! 
 I'm sorry I've already gone through my paycheck for the week . 
 Mommy , can I stay up until eleven o'clock ? 
 Have you been served , sir ? 
 It's on the fourth floor . 
 Would you mind if I ask your health status ? 
 That is good . We hope each of our future employees will be healthy and happy . 
 This website offers very convenient air tickets booking service . It is quick and accurate . 
 So it has attracted more and more customers these days . 
 Where can I park my car ? 
 Okay . Here you are . 
 Good morning , Miss Cai . Congratulations ! You ’ Ve passed the interview . 
 Oh . Take it easy . As I ’ Ve said in the interview , once you are employed , we ’ ll give you a probation period of three months . And now we need to sign a draft agreement for the probation period . 
 Of course , here you are . And you can ask me any question . 
 Well , according to the principle of our company , employees like you have no remuneration during the probation period . 
 I am sorry , it ’ s not decided by me but by the company . 
 Okay . Can you give me a reply tomorrow ? 
 Hi , taxi.Could you take me to the financial street , please 
 I want to go to the financial stree . 
 Excuse me , how long does it take to get there ? 
 Oh , does it really a long way to go . 
 No , I'm not.you can just drive slowly and carefully . 
 You are very skillful driver . 
 By the way , is the fair the same for any distance ? 
 Oh , I see . 
 I'm really sorry , Ethan . I tried so hard , but I'm afraid I could't find a Dutch restaurant in town . The best I could do was a German one about 15 minutes from here . 
 I though you said you wanted to have Dutch food ? 
 Huh ? What were you talking about , then ? 
 oath ... that makes so much more sense ! Ha-ha . Well , great , I don't like German food anyway ! 
 I'm in the mood for some chips and salsa . 
 And they have tangy , freshly-made salsa , too . My mouth is watering already ! 
 Surprise me . 
 No where special . I was just taking a walk . 
 To get a little exercise . I'm so out of shape . 
 That sounds great . Give me a call next time you guys play . 
 Let me see . Are dimes and quarters OK ? 
 Then you'll need small change . 
 Yeas , It is . Sewen Jes speaking . How can I help ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry to hear that , sir . What exactly is problem ? 
 Oh , dear ! I'll do whatever I can . 
 What kind ? 
 You need to keep a minimum balance . 
 You need at least $ 100 in your account . 
 Yes . That ’ s the minimum . 
 You will get a fine . 
 It ’ s going to be $ 25 . 
 It's Peter's turn . 
 OK . 
 I thought he only liked to listen ! 
 He has a really good voice ! 
 Hello Mr Janus . What can we do for you today ? 
 Haha ! I actually think that many locals would disagree with you ; they are all dying to be paid in US dollars . 
 Thanks , Mr Janus . Of course I trust you , but regulations are regulations . 
 Thanks . And of course , could you fill in the exchange form ? 
 Hi , this is Monica . I was wondering when we can work on this financial report . 
 Shall I see you on Friday morning ? 
 We must find some time to read report . 
 That ’ s all right . Then see you on Friday afternoon . 
 Would you like to travel ? 
 How many languages can you speak in addition to your mother tongue ? 
 That's fine . What salary do you get at your present position ? 
 We'll start you off with a base salary of $ 20,000 a year , with bonuses that can add up to $ 40,000 . A company car , and a company pension scheme . Is that acceptable to you ? 
 Excellent . Well , thank you very much , Mr . B , and you'll be hearing from us in the next few days , either way . 
 I heard there is a big yard sale at weeks this saturday morning , i will go there to see if there is some nice clothes , do you want to go with me ? 
 How about we go to the yard sale first and then to the university flea market ? 
 Is there a train leaving for Philadelphia ? 
 May I buy a ticket here at the station ? 
 Where ? 
 Thanks . 
 What's your address , sir ? 
 Ok , someone will be there by 12:15 . 
 It's 2 dollars initially and 35 cents for each quarter mile . 
 No , I'll send a larger vehicle to pick you up . 
 What kinds do you have ? 
 Last time I tried a pin curl perm and a foam permanent . Set the wave a little looser than usual , please . 
 Of course you can . I am sure this one works very well . I just sent dozens of pages . How many pages are you sending ? Are you familiar with my fax machine ? 
 Yes , it will print immediately . 
 What do you need help with ? 
 Do you have any change ? 
 You need to put 50 cents into the washer machine and a dollar into the dryer . 
 The machines will turn on once you put the quarters into the slot . 
 That's everything . 
 I'm here if you need any more help . 
 I wish to buy a diamond ring . 
 Two carats . 
 No , it seems too old-fashioned . 
 Let me try it on , it's too small for me , haven't you got any larger ones ? 
 This fits me well , how much is it ? 
 It's reasonable . Here you are . 
 We are very glad to hear that . We are sure that there will be a bigger market for our products in this country . 
 We really appreciate your efforts . Before we go to the core of matter , can you give us some idea of them on which you would be willing to operate as our agent ? 
 I ’ m thinking about redecorating my bedroom . I bought this magazine in order to get some ideas . What do you think of this ? 
 I ’ d like to have the bed and the wardrobe . 
 Yes , it would . It ’ s very expensive though . 
 Yes . I ’ m sure I could find something similar at one . I ’ d also like to get a new carpet for my bedroom . 
 That ’ s a good idea . I ’ m really looking forward to redoing my bedroom . 
 For 3 days $ 300 , for 7 days $ 600 . 
 Okay . I'll write up the paperwork . 
 Yes , I'd like a cheeseburger and a large order of French fries . 
 Yes , a medium Coke . 
 Yes . 
 To go , please . ( The attendant hands the customer his order . ) 
 Tonight is a party night ! What drinks do you think we need ? 
 I don ’ t think we need too much in the way of soft drinks . Two super bottles of Cola should cover everyone . What about wine ? 
 No , once I fill the tub with beer , I ’ ll get the ice . The beer will be cool if you put the tub under the ice . The cooler , the better . 
 Well , if you say so . Personally speaking , I ’ d rather die of thirst than drink champagne . 
 I'm going to the movie theater with my friend . What are you going to do ? 
 How about you see a movie with me and my friend ? 
 Not sure . Is there a movie out that catches your eye ? 
 Have you decided whether or not you would like to go ? 
 For sure another day . 
 Sporting goods ? Is that bike Tim wanted on sale ? 
 Well , maybe we could get it now and hide it until his birthday . 
 Don ’ t buy him underwear again . He hates that . 
 See anything else we need there ? 
 Shoes ? You already have a closet full of shoes . 
 Oh , all right . I need some new shirts , too . Let ’ s go after breakfast . 
 Hello . Can you help me ? 
 Oh good , come in , please . 
 Don ’ t tell me ! I ’ m sure it ’ s someplace warm and sunny with great beaches ! 
 You are so lucky ! Send me a postcard ! 
 Yes . I Would like make a reservation to Huston for tomorrow . 
 Oh , that's quite convenient . Thank you . 
 Well , I love hip hop dancing , so I should probably dance . Do you know how to rap ? 
 Excellent . I'll start practicing my dance moves . 
 I ’ m great . Thank you for asking . 
 Do I owe any fees ? 
 Could you tell me how much I owe ? 
 I can ’ t believe that . 
 I ’ ll pay them off right now . 
 I will pay with cash . 
 Yes . I want to apply for the accountant in your corporation and I think it is not beyond attainment . 
 Yes , of course . In accounting , cash means all items that are acceptable for depositing in a bank . 
 Forgive me , sir , I haven't been told what the problem is . 
 My apologies , sir . We'll transfer you to a new room at once and give you a full refund . 
 Sir , we never want a guest to stay here mad or unhappy . 
 Working for your company ! As the top administrative assistant in your firm ! 
 Well , I haven't thought much about this . I think it's too early to tell . What is the most important for me now is to do the best possible job for the company and learn and develop my skills as much as possible . If the company is happy with my work , then , I think I would like to consider other positions in the company . 
 Well , a working relationship . I think a company is a place to get work done . Certainly friendly , open relationships among all company employees is important . But I think an employee should be serious about his or her work responsibilities and have a working relationship with the boss . 
 Which one do you mean ? 
 Hello , Lucy , I heard you did a good deal in interview . 
 What did you do in the interview ? 
 Are all these helpful for the interview ? 
 Anything else ? 
 what are your strong points ? 
 what kind of people do you like to work with ? 
 what ’ s your greatest strength ? 
 so , you ’ re smart . 
 what do you consider your weakness ? 
 that ’ s not a problem . It ’ s unnecessary for this position . 
 Well , you know the time of shipment means a lot to us . 
 I see.OK , that's agreed then . 
 Irish coffee is my favorite . But I'm not particular on it . 
 Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee . 
 Exactly . Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . People love it all over the world . 
 Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee . 
 I suppose so . That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffee houses in China now . 
 What are you going to get ? 
 Well , do you want burgers , Chinese food , or Mexican food ? 
 Where are you going to get it from ? 
 I usually get my Chinese food from Panda Express . 
 The food there is actually pretty good . 
 You should . I know you'll like it . 
 Why don't you try an Americano ? Espresso with water . 
 Go with a hammerhead then-espresso mixed with drip coffee . 
 Don't worry , James . We'll get this case worked out in no time . 
 In America , most children start primary school at the age of five . 
 Kindergarten students usually only go to school for about four hours every day , but after that , they spend about eight hours in school every day . 
 no , most children in America only go to school Monday through Friday . 
 In most schools , they study about nine subjects . 
 some private schools require their students to wear uniforms , but public schools don't . 
 I went to a private school for elementary school and university , but went to a public school for high school . What about you ? 
 did you have to wear uniforms ? 
 at least you didn't waste time thinking about what you were going to wear every day ! 
 ... Now , that's all I want to say about world coal reserves . So let's move on to the next topic , renewable resources . There are three things we have to consider when talking about renewable resources . First , sustainability ; second , marketability ; lastly , the reality factor . Let's talk about each point in more detail ... John , would you like to take it from here ? 
 Have you got anything for diarrhea ? 
 How should I take this medicine ? 
 I see . I'll follow your instructions . 
 Thank you . 
 Um ... Uh ... I'm just looking , thanks . 
 No , no , no . I'm just browsing . Thanks anyway . 
 Um ... well , where's the men's shoe department ? 
 I absolutely love what you're wearing today . 
 Seriously , it looks really nice on you . Where did you buy it from ? 
 I really like that outfit . 
 Thank you . I just bought these new shoes earlier today . 
 These are some Chucks . 
 I got them for forty . 
 This is a great meal ! 
 Who taught you how to cook this well ? 
 Wow , what is in this chicken dish ? 
 Is the soup a shrimp soup ? 
 I think I got lucky in choosing a wine that blends with this meal . 
 Have you any tour route to Budapest ? 
 About 2 weeks . 
 Well , will you offer me any reduction since it's a out-of-season tour ? 
 We have a holiday next week , don't we ? 
 What're you going to do ? 
 At cars ! You aren't thinking about buying a car , are you ? 
 But it will be expensive to have a car in the city , won't it ? 
 But what about parking ? You can't park on the street , can you ? 
 Ah , Oh ! Are you hurt ? 
 Maybe I'd better call an ambulance . 
 Are you sure ? 
 Hello . Holiday Inn . How can I help you ? 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry to hear that . 
 Certainly . May I have your name , please ? 
 Okay . I have canceled your reservation , Mr . Smith . 
 You ’ re welcome . I hope your wife is feeling better soon . 
 Hi , Clyde . This is my friend , Wen . She's visiting from UCLA . 
 OK ! I was just tellin ’ Wen about African-American food . 
 Hey ! That “ stuff ” is my grandma's cooking , and it's good ! 
 Well , I am looking for some winter clothes for my fiancee . 
 Really ? What's that ? 
 I think my fiancee may favor the sweater in the shop window . Would you like to help me look for any skirts that go with this sweater ? 
 I especially like this flowery skirts . My fiancee will look very elegant in this . 
 I don't think the green one fits her complexion . Do you have any skirts in light color or tan ? 
 Oh , yes . I'll take this one . Can I pay by traveler ’ s check ? 
 Good afternoon , passport and arrival card please . 
 Where are you coming from ? 
 Is this your country of birth or residence . 
 What is the purpose of your visit to the United States ? 
 How long do you plan to stay in the United States ? 
 Sir , you didn't fill out the information on your arrival card of where you will be staying . 
 You must specify an address of the place where you will spend most of your time . 
 Do you have enough means to support yourself while you are here ? 
 Very good . Do you have anything to declare ? 
 Very well sir , welcome to the United States , enjoy your visit . 
 Hello , I come to pay my water and electricity fees . 
 Here they are . 
 Do you mean that I should pay 240 yuan in total ? 
 Cash , please . Here is the money . 
 OK . Thank you . Bye-bye . 
 Can I help you , Madam ? 
 How much would you like to exchange ? 
 It's US 100 for RIB 802 today . 
 Fill out this exchange memo , please . 
 Wait a second , please ... These are 24,060 RIB and the receipt , please check them . 
 Good-bye . 
 I want to leave . We've already been here two hours . 
 I would rather buy them somewhere else . 
 I don't like shopping in malls . I like shopping on the street . There is more variety . 
 Alright . 
 The styles here are too boring for me . I told you . I like street shopping . 
 Sure I would . 
 Do they have it in LARGE . 
 Where is the fitting room ? I don't see it . 
 Okay , I will try it on . 
 I look like a nerd . 
 Well , I don't think it's the best style for me . 
 Alright . Alright . 
 Yes , maybe . But I like street shopping . There is more variety . I'm sorry . I just don't like malls . 
 Hmm . Your file shows that you watched ' Titanic ' Monday night . 
 Well , as they say , garbage in , garbage out . Let me correct this error , please . 
 When I deleted the $ 10 , the computer automatically added a $ 2 service charge . 
 Sir , if it makes you feel any better , the $ 2 service fee used to be $ 5 . 
 Unfortunately , sir , you'll have to pay the $ 2 , whether you like it or not . 
 What do you want to go to US for ? 
 Can I have a look at your letter of acceptance ? 
 That's OK . We'll contact you the moment we hear from home . 
 We'd like to take a tour to Florence . 
 We have got a 2 weeks ' vocation and we plan to leave on Thursday . 
 I have a problem with my credit card . 
 There is a charge on my card that I didn't make . 
 It's for a purse that cost $ 350 . 
 I can't even afford a purse that expensive . 
 I was at work , but the purchase was made at 3 
 OK.Do I have to pay for this charge ? 
 Could you explain the paper-making process to us - in very simple terms - please ? 
 So , is it actually paper at this stage ? 
 I need to get some business cards printed up . 
 I think I can get by with 2,000 . 
 I hope you can make the new cards just like my old cards . 
 ... Okay , I'm through . Here's the form and my old card . 
 Now that I think of it , three days is better than seven . 
 Hello , I want to make a reservation for a Qingdao cruise . 
 Next week . 
 Good ! How much does the sea view stateroom cost for per person ? 
 I see . Does that include fees for shore excursions ? 
 Thanks a lot . Give me one ticket , please . 
 Yes , I have booked a table for four . My name is Liu Fan . 
 Thanks . 
 Can we see the menu , please ? 
 Anything good for this evening ? 
 Very good , we'll take them all . 
 I'm here , hello . 
 I'm in Beijing , at the Weston Hotel . 
 I don't have it to hand , but I know the number . It's 16211469 9 . Can you do anything , like stop the card for example ? 
 But , what do I do if I need cash ? 
 Thank you so much . I'll find the nearest branch and come in tomorrow . Thanks again for all of your help . 
 I enjoyed talking to you too . 
 I think that would be nice . 
 Do you want to go out to eat ? 
 So I'll see you next time . 
 I'll talk to you later . 
 Goodbye . 
 What's your favorite dish or dishes ? 
 But a Chinese person would never order that . 
 Alex , you don't know what to order . Let's go to a Chinese restaurant together next time . 
 Get ready for the best meal of your life ! 
 Let me weigh them for you . 1.5 $ . 
 Yes . 
 You have to pay $ 0.5 more . 
 You might want to try the mangoes . 
 It's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . It has a big seed in it . 
 Maybe some animals eat the seed , but humans don't . You'd have to soak it for 10 years . 
 Today you get a 50 - percent discount . They're only $ 1 each . 
 Their flesh is soft and juicy . It has a citrus taste . It's sweet . 
 Just press into it gently with your thumb . If it feels soft , it's ready to eat . 
 These are from Guatemala , but we're going to start getting mangoes from India . 
 Uh , yes , they are . 
 What ? 
 Oh , for Pete's sake . This is cosmetic . My brows are falling out . I did this for convenience . 
 Mike , don't even think about it ! 
 OK . I just want to read the comics . 
 Office software like Windows might be one of the best inventions in this information age . It saves us from so much work and makes the communication even around the world much easier . 
 Yes , this machine is even smaller than those before . 
 You know our boss always trying to save the last penny . We have to use up the equipment first . 
 It leaves at 8: 30 . 
 Just a moment , please . Yes , you can have a seat . 
 It's 38 dollars . 
 Here's your ticket and change . 
 Go to gate number 2 , please . 
 Don't mention it . 
 Yeah , why , is there something going on Thursday ? 
 Bob is retiring , wow ... that's news to me , I had no idea Bob was that old , retirement's still sixty-five , right ? 
 Wow ... I thought he was early forty stops , why would he want to retire so soon ? 
 May I help you find something , or are you just looking ? 
 Then take your time , please . 
 How do you like the food here ? 
 There are many things I miss . You can't get the ingredients here . 
 Perhaps . i just haven't had time to find them yet . 
 There's a bookstore just across the street . 
 They are reports of our company . 
 No , they are filed according to dates . 
 No problem , here you are . 
 Yes , certainly . I'll be back in a minute . Here you are 
 Of course , not.Let me check.Oh , you seem bo be correct . 
 Only ten percent tax is included in the bill . 
 It sure does . 
 You mean , what's happening ? Well , constable , I'm trying to get out of the windowand Fred here is helping me . 
 Well , you see I can't find the key and I'm in a hurry . Come on , Fred , We're wasting time . 
 No , it's my brother's . I'm staying with him for a while . 
 I'm afraid not . He's in jail for house-breaking at the moment . 
 He's awful ! He telephoned me four times yesterday , and three times the day before yesterday . He telephoned the office yesterday morning and yesterday afternoon . My boss answered the telephone . 
 He said , Pauline is typing letters . She can't speak to you now ! " Then I arrived home at six o'clock yesterday evening . He telephoned again . But I didn ’ t answer the phone ! 
 Yes , he did . He telephoned at nine o'clock . 
 I said , This is Pauline's mother . Please don ’ t telephone my daughter again ! 
 No , he didn't ! 
 It goes all the way there . 
 I know it does . I catch this bus a lot . 
 The bus ride is only thirty minutes or so . 
 Right behind Macy's is a bus stop . 
 It's in the middle of the parking lot . 
 I know it is . 
 Where do you need to catch this bus at ? 
 I can tell you what bus to catch , but you have to walk a little bit . 
 The 267 stops at Altadena Drive and Fair Oaks . 
 Get on the bus heading west . 
 Del Mar and Hill . 
 No problem . 
 I suppose we can bring him to visit our company , as well as our display room . In this way , he can know more about our company and our potential power . In my opinion , visiting the factory will help him learn our manufacturing process very much . 
 Well , I understand . 
 Are you making what I think you're making ? 
 What a nostalgic food ! 
 No . Just the smell of bread toasting to a perfect golden brown ... 
 This is a nice place , but you need to get some furniture . 
 Do you have a bed ? 
 That's good . You can put one in this room and put the other one in that room . 
 Yeah . By the way , can I take a shower ? 
 Really ? 
 Well , do you want to go outside for dinner ? 
 OK . Let's go . 
 The exact time ? Let me think . You know , it happened at night . 
 Oh , I remember . It was about 10 o'clock . When I was about to go to bed , suddenly I heard help outside . 
 It's just around the corner 
 Don't feel like it . I'm broke . 
 Just look around ? Ah , that's boring . 
 Boris , look at this sentence . " Healthy eating is not about strict nutrition philosophies , staying unrealistically thin , or depriving yourself of foods you love . " It's interesting , isn't it ? 
 I believe they are careful calculations on proteins , vitamins and calories . 
 Healthy eating is not about depriving oneself of the foods one loves . So we are free to have whatever foods we love . It is unbelievable . 
 Seriously ? 
 Maybe nowadays people hold different opinions on healthy diet . 
 But one must have some basic ideas about nutrition and find the best way for it to work out for the body . 
 Oh ... I mostly just like to listen . You're the groom . Why don't you go first ? 
 How about As Long as You Love Me ? You can pretend you're singing it to your fiancee Brooke ! 
 John , you have done a good job . Our new series computer is appreciated by the guests . They intend to sign contracts with our company . You really did a good job . 
 Hah , as the sale department director of our team , you are the best . 
 Why not ? You've done so well for the company . She should give you a prize . 
 Come on ! What are you nervous about ? 
 But the sale number is close to the predicted amount . 
 Take it easy . Be confident . I'm sure you can do it . 
 Yes . I have just got lost with my firiend.Can you page my friend for me ? 
 Here is his passport.Thank you very much . 
 Make sure that you understand the company . Do you understand what it is that they do ? 
 When you've finished your research it will help you figure out whether your company is rigid in philosophy or kind of more relaxed . Does that make sense ? 
 So all of that information will help you to pick out what to wear . Do you have something to wear ? 
 You know I could go shopping with you sometime if you need it , but can we talk about other basics ? 
 Focus on being relaxed and open , don't forget to smile and shake hands and be genuinely interested in what their company is about . I'm sure you'll do well . 
 I'd like to buy a toy car for my son . 
 It looks nice.How much is it ? 
 Oh , I'm afraid it's too expensive.Can you show me something cheaper ? 
 OK , I'll take it.Here ' s the money . 
 Good morning . Could I speak to Frans Smith please ? 
 Is this Taiwan 8234342 2 , DS engineering ? 
 The accounts department , I think . 
 How did you get it ? 
 What a find ! So , how much does it cost ? 
 Ninety dollars is pretty steep . I'll take it for sixty bucks . 
 I'm looking for the cameras . 
 Hey , Jack , I'd better go now . 
 Right ! And I have to finish the report by 5:30 p . m . 
 Okay , no problem . Bye ! 
 I think we have everything in the contract . Shall we sign it ? 
 I believe we can solve disputes through an amicable negotiation . 
 All right . I agree with you . But where do we hold arbitration ? 
 It sounds reasonable . The clause should be like this - any disputes arising from the execution of this contract shall be settled in a friendly way . If no settlement can be reached through consul - nation and conciliation , the disputes shall be submitted for arbitration by a mutually nominated arbitrator . The arbitrator's decision on the dispute is final and binding on the both parties . 
 Here we are , Ryan ! This is where we're going to celebrate ! 
 You won't need it . Stanley , my best man , is going to treat everybody ! 
 If it were up to Stanley , we'd have the wedding in the ETV ! He loves to sing . 
 Well , uh , I'll let you decide that for yourself . He'll be here a little later . Here's our room ! 
 Yes , they are the latest designs . Would you like to try them on ? 
 The round shape pair ? 
 I think it suits you well . 
 120 yuan . 
 I am Liu Yi , from China XYZ Company . I ’ d like to see Mr . Thomas , please . 
 No , I am afraid not . I just arrive in town today . 
 Would you please ask when he will be free ? 
 Hi , Bob . 
 Passed . 
 Freeze ! Police ! Put your hands over your head ! 
 You're under arrest for concealing illegal drugs . 
 You are suspected of hiding illegal drugs . So we are taking you into custody . 
 We've found some heroin at your house . 
 That may be , but you're still under arrest . And you'd better stop talking . 
 Whatever you say . 
 Yes , we are thinking of placing an order . However we would like to know what kinds of machines are available for export and in addition your sales terms , including mode of payment , discount and possible date of delivery . 
 We have read about this in your sales literature . Could you give us some idea of your prices ? 
 Do you take special orders ? That is , do you make machines according to the specific requirements from clients ? 
 How long does it usually take you to make delivery ? 
 Good . One more thing , we'd like you to quote us on CIF basis . 
 How much is it ? 
 It s a little overpriced . Is there any discount on this laptop ? 
 I ’ d buy this if it were cheaper . How about 5 000 yuan ? 
 Is it the final price ? 
 Alright , I ’ ll buy this one . 
 Just a minute . I am as busy as a bee right now ... Ok , I am done . What can I do for you ? 
 Well , keep you chin up ! I ’ ll try to help you . Where are you going ? 
 Yes , no problem . You walk down this street . You turn left at the first intersection . Walk along that road , turn right at the corner . After that , you make a left-hand turn at the first traffic light . The Royal Hotel is on your right side . 
 Yeah , I think so . I think the hotel is right across the street from a post office . It is as plain as the hump on a camel . You can't miss it . 
 Yeah , it ’ s gonna take you a while if you go by foot . I ’ d say it's about a 30 - minute uphill walk . You have to be as strong as a lion to make it . 
 Well , you could take a bus there , but you would have to transfer buses twice . A taxi would probably be a lot quicker . 
 Not too long . It should take about ten mins by taxi . 
 You are welcome . 
 Yes . Can you show me the menu , please ? 
 Then , what's special tonight ? 
 All right . We'll have some seafood and vegetables . 
 I ’ d be glad to . Just leave them on my desk . I didn ’ t expect you to finish so soon . 
 Great . Good work . 
 But it's raining . 
 are you looking for somewhere for two people ? 
 yes , there are several place available in that price range near the university . do you have any other requirements ? 
 how many rooms do you need in the flat ? 
 ok . i've got a list of place that fit your requirements . let's just go through them . the first on the list costs 80 pounds a month , but it's on a noisy street and it's a little far from t 
 it's about two miles away . that might be a little far to walk . here's one that's about half a mile from the campus . the cost is 100 pounds a month and it's on a small street , just off a 
 of course . i'm not very busy at the moment . if you can wait for about 15 or 20 minutes . i can take you there . 
 I'm getting so paunchy that I'm afraid I have to buy a new belt to-morrow , and I think I must go on a diet . 
 You know , I'm a compulsive overeater . I got to watch what I eat . 
 You said it . 
 Unfortunately , he has left for the day . 
 I ’ ll make sure he gets the message . 
 Yeah , I went . Did you go ? 
 That's nice , have you been to the movies lately ? 
 It may have been random , but have you ? 
 I would love to catch a movie this weekend . 
 I don't want to see a movie by myself . 
 I think I might just go to the movies . 
 Sure , but let's get a pitcher this time . We should be able to down it before they close . 
 It's all the way to the back . See that yellow door ? 
 You're back already . That sure was quick . 
 Well , the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer.Anyway.He said it was too close to closing time . 
 Okay , let's go ! 
 Oh . I am sorry , here you are . May I suggest our lunch special ? 
 Of course . I will be here minutes later . 
 I ran a virus scan on your computer , and it turns out that you have a lot of infected files ! 
 Well , you have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly.yours wasn't up to date , that ’ s probably what was causing your problems . 
 Yeah , try not to kick or hit the computer ! 
 I want to reserve a VIP room at 7:00 this evening . 
 8 . Is your VIP room big enough for 8 persons ? 
 May , look at this mess ! You threw waste everywhere . 
 Do you have any experience working with a computer ? 
 What kind of software can you use ? 
 Do you have any other computer qualifications ? 
 Do you know how to use a PC to process the management information ? 
 Can you believe her ? She is not even a hundred pounds and she is going off on how she wants to go on a diet . 
 Me too . But what are we going to do ? I have been on 4 different diets and I can't seem to lose weight . 
 What do you know ? You are over weight too . 
 I know . But I don't have someone to diet with . If we help each other and motivate each other , then I think we can lose some weight . 
 C'mon . You'll feel better and look better and as a reward you can eat a little bit of ice cream here and there . 
 It's a great idea . I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier . Going on a diet with a friend to back you up is a great way to succeed . 
 Great . I'll get our plan started right away . 
 Excuse me , is this the right counter for express mail ? 
 I want to send some important documents to Canada for my postgraduate admission . 
 Yes , the deadline for applying is 1st Feb , so I hope they will arrive in 3 days . 
 Really ? But can you guarantee the safety ? 
 OK . I will send them now . 
 All right . Here you are . 
 Thank you . I have got quite clear idea of it . 
 What's the matter ? 
 Yes . 
 Dalian . 
 Really ? 
 Sorry . I'm afraid you couldn't . 
 Don ’ t worry about it . I have his pager number right here . 
 Forget it . It ’ s nothing . 
 Yes , it is almost new here . 
 It is a color TV . You know , the rich people like the digital one now . So they have no room for them . 
 OK , please be seated . May I have your name , please ? 
 OK , Woody . Why are you interested in this job ? 
 Have you worked anywhere else before ? 
 OK , your work experience is impressive , and I think you sound right for this position , but I do have 3 other people to interview , so you'll be hearing from us within a week . 
 You should save some money on parking here . 
 Really ? How long did it take you to find a spot yesterday ? 
 You get home late , don ’ t you ? 
 Ah , well . You can ’ t have everything . 
 How about this opera given by the famous musician ? 
 Foreign Currency Deposits Counter , yes . What can I do for you ? 
 OK . We offer 2 types of saving systems , Time Savings and Demand Savings . With Time Savings your money cannot be withdrawn for a certain period of time , but with Demand Savings your money is ' on demand ' , you can withdraw at any time . 
 There's quite a large difference . I mean , if you were to use demand deposit we could give you 0.13 % interest , but for a time deposit , of say , 1 year we would offer 0.82 % . 
 Thanks for inviting me over for dinner this evening . 
 It looks delicious . 
 We wish to express our desire to trade with you in leather shoes . 
 Please inform us of your decision as soon as possible . 
 Good morning . What time is it now ? 
 I'm on time today 
 Yes , quite often . 
 No , I left home at 6:30 as usual . 
 Because the traffic is not crowded . 
 I need to make a deposit . 
 I ’ m depositing a check . 
 There you go . 
 Yes , please . 
 I want $ 150 . 
 Thank you , and have a nice day . 
 This weekend . 
 Don't worry about that.We have experience . 
 Yes . 
 Well . Obviously , you won ’ t want All Risks cover . 
 Because they aren ’ t delicate goods and won ’ t likely be damaged on the voyage . FPA will be good enough . 
 That's right . On the other hand , a WA policy covers you against partial loss in all cases . 
 Oh , lots of them . For instance , War Risks , TEND and SICC . 
 Are you going to make an offer today ? 
 Ok , I'll get this rate right away . 
 Would you show me some table-cloths ? 
 How much is it ? 
 That ’ s reasonable . 
 Really ? I ’ ll take it then . 
 Would she like a laptop ? 
 A Mac is a very popular brand . 
 A 15 - inch Pro model is $ 2,100 plus tax . 
 This is a gift she'll cherish for years . How do you want to pay ? 
 We're almost through . Just sign here , please . 
 She'll be online 20 minutes after she opens the box . 
 Remember us for all your computer needs . 
 Yes . My name ’ s Mark Benson . I just started a couple of weeks ago . 
 Thanks , I appreciate that ! 
 I need to know how much money is in my account . 
 Certainly . 
 Nothing . It's just one of those days . Everyone at the office is sick and I'm getting blamed for work not being done . 
 I'm sick of doing other people's job and getting blamed for not doing it right . 
 I wish he could understand . You know what , if this goes on , I think I will get stick like everybody else . 
 A compact please . What's the daily rate for that car ? 
 Does the rate include the cost of gas ? 
 Doctor , I feel much better now . Will I be albe to go home some time this week ? 
 Do you think I can get back to work very soon ? 
 Is there anything I should do ? 
 Should I take some medicine ? 
 It's very kind of you . 
 Hello , Jason . Are you free this Saturday evening ? 
 Would you like to Come to our barbecue ? 
 OK . See you then . 
 Hey ! I didn't know that ! When did you become a vegetarian ? 
 Relly ? That's amazing . 
 Are you kidding ? I really don't think that you think less clearly on non-vegetarian diet . 
 Maybe I'll also have a try some day , but I'm afraid that it would be difficult for me to refuse meat . 
 We'll see . Anyway , I'll prepare some vegetarian food for the barbecue . See you then ! 
 Just say the word , sir . 
 I agree . The dew is still on the grass . 
 We do have a storage space for your bags . There's a small charge , plus a deposit . 
 Regrettably , no . But simply present your VISA to cover your deposit . 
 Okay , sir , but don't think too long . Your checkout is only 30 minutes away . 
 China Hotel . 
 Well , I think I'll take the bus this time just for a change . 
 Before 12 a . m . 
 May I ask whether we are allowed to wear casual clothes in the office ? 
 Thank you for telling me that . 
 What are they ? I ’ ll be careful . 
 I got it . 
 I see . 
 Good heavens ! Don't bring that frog in the house . 
 Yes , I ’ Ve nearly finished , June . I ’ m sure we will win something this week . 
 If I win a lot of money , I shall buy you a mink coat . 
 All right . If we win a lot of money , we shall travel around the world and we shall stay at the best hotels . Then we will return home and buy a big house in the country . We will have a beautiful 
 If we spend all the money , we will try and win the football pools again . 
 Waiter , bring me the menu , will you ? 
 I'd like to see the menu.Would you get me one , please ? 
 Thank you.Ah ! But this is in French.Would you mind giving me the English menu ? 
 Thanks . I'll need a while to choose.Could you come back in a minute ?

 Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 Have you made a reservation ? 
 Yes , children are half price . 
 What do you feel like eating this morning ? 
 The most important meal of the day is breakfast . 
 You can always make an easy breakfast . 
 All I make is oatmeal , toast , and some orange juice . 
 I like it , and it's a fast meal . 
 I can make it for you if you like . 
 Hi , Yang Tang . Come in ! Pretty hot out there , isn't it ? Did you have trouble finding us ? Sit ! Sit ! 
 Yang Tang , just call me Fred ! Everyone does . 
 No problem . No problem at all . Say , it says here in your resume you studied in California . Great place , isn ’ t it ? I studied in California myself . I really enjoyed it . What did you like most about California ? 
 Yeah , the people are quite relaxed ... Those were some great times I spent there . Well , thanks for stopping by . Are you from King Dao , Yang Tang ? 
 Is that right ? Wonderful , wonderful . I've been in King Dao for two years now . A great place . Nice people and great beer ! Well , I guess we ’ d better get started . 
 Hello . I'm having a problem with my air conditioner . 
 The one in the bedroom . 
 There's no cold air coming out . 
 512 . 
 I'm going out right now . But that's all right , you can come when I've gone . 
 May I help you ? 
 He's in a meeting with Phil . 
 Excuse me , Mr . Macmillan ? 
 I was hoping you would write a letter of recommendation . I want to enter a Master ’ s program in marketing . It ’ s all on weekends and evenings . 
 Welcome to Galant . How can I help you ? 
 Of course . We have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . The first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . This is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps . 
 Well , this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . I suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . That way you can play games online without any lag . This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall absolutely free ! 
 Lucky for you , this month we aren ’ t charging our normal installation fee . You are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! And we ’ ll throw in this pen drive ! 
 Mr . Crane ’ s office . Sandy speaking . May I help you ? 
 Certainly , Mr . Knight . When would you like to meet with him ? 
 Tell me about yourself and your past experience . 
 Why are you interested in this occupation ? 
 What do you think is the chief characteristic for a stewardess ? 
 Do you get angry easily ? 
 If a passenger had a accident , what would you do ? 
 If you are hired , when can you start work ? 
 What are your salary expectations ? 
 I love your little Lulu dolls.How much for a batch of 6,000 ? 
 That ’ s a little steep for our company.Do you offer any discounts ? 
 Hmmm.It wouldn ’ t be easy , but if the discount makes it worthwhile , we can consider it.How much of a discount would that give us ? 
 So , for an additional 6,000 dollars , we get twice as many dolls ? That still might be a little hard.Couldn ’ t you discount it further ? We ’ Ve been pricing other suppliers , and this discount might 
 I think we can handle that . Let me confirm with my boss and touch base with you again tomorrow . 
 That's no problem at all , but could you fill in this and I'll need to see some ID . 
 Yes , there needs to be at least 1 RIB paid in to open a new account . Also , you will need to choose a secret identity code to ensure no one else can enter your account . 
 Just 6 digits . 
 Things are going well for me , Dr . Smith . 
 Yes , I am applying for new health insurance , and I need a physical examination to qualify . 
 I ’ Ve been having a little trouble breathing . Would you look into that , please ? 
 I would appreciate it . When you give me a blood test , what are you looking for ? 
 I am expecting the tests to go well . I have been taking good care of myself . 
 Coming . What do you want today ? 
 Our fruit is very fresh today . Do you want some ? 
 Three for ten cents . 
 Anything else ? 
 Twenty eight dollars . 
 Hello , Mr . lie . I would like to discuss with you the feasibilities of establishing a joint venture with your company . 
 I suggest that we set up a board of directors for the management of the company and share rights and obligations as equal . That is very important . 
 Well , there does have one . Walk along the road and turn left when you come to a bystreet . It will lead you to the back gate of the park . 
 I don't think so . 
 Yes , of course . Do you like a jade necklace ? 
 Here are all kinds of jades . Choose whatever you like , please . 
 Yes . Natural pearls or cultured pearls ? We have both kinds . 
 Well , natural pearls are of higher value , but the cultured pearls have equal lustre and are just as beautiful . 
 I hope we could offer the most favorable terms . 
 Good . Is there any commission included ? We are commission agents . 
 Ok . How about the earliest possible shipment ? 
 Could you make an offer on FOB basis ? 
 I want to check in now . Here is my ticket . 
 No , sir . 
 I'd like an aisle seat . I feel terrible near the window . 
 I ’ d like to post this letter to Korea . 
 No thank you . I ’ d like to send it just by normal post . 
 Yes , sir . Did you call the airline ? 
 Certainly , sir . What is the flight number and when are you leaving ? 
 Oh , I see , sir . We have the airline office inside the hotel . They have an English-speaking staff . Just dial 35 , please . 
 Yes , they have been concerned about me finding a job . 
 They want to recommend some jobs to me . 
 My father wants me to work as a trainee in his company . 
 My aunt says her company is in need of an assistant now , and she wants me to give it a try . 
 One of my friends tells me that his company is hiring in a large scale and he wants me to go for an interview . 
 I know . Let me think it over . 
 I will . 
 Great . But no talking , now . Don't forget that you are on a ladder . Take care ! 
 Don't touch it with your stick . It's a bumble bees ' hive . Get down the ladder . Be quick . 
 You can get killed . No kidding . Remember , never stir up a hive . 
 It's for fun . And also , the apples here are Green Food . 
 Silly boy . Green Food means the plants grown without using any chemicals , fertilizers , and pesticides . 
 I heard they used ultraviolet lamp to kill pests . 
 May I see your airplane ticket , passport and health certificate please ? 
 Will you please put your luggage on the scale ? 
 Sir , your bags are 30 pounds over weight . You are allowed only 45 pounds of baggage . 
 That comes to H . K . $ 120 . 
 Sure he can . He can shake hands , roll over , and even play dead . 
 Yeah , but sometimes Bingo wants to play with me , but I don't have time . 
 My little brother likes to play with him . He even gives him a bath every week . 
 You know , you're right . Maybe you should get a dog . 
 Yes . Let's go Dutch . 
 You are always so hospitable . 
 Yes , what style do you prefer ? 
 OK , here you are . 
 Hi , I would like to send this package to China , and these postcards as well . 
 Great . How much is this going to cost ? 
 What ’ s the difference ? 
 I see . Well , there ’ s no rush . Please send it via priority mail . Please be extra careful , the contents of the package are fragile . 
 I am . What can I do for you ? 
 Come on in , please . 
 I don't feel so good , Mom . 
 No , Mom . I'm really sick . 
 Would you mind waiting a while ? 
 I'm not sure . But I'll get a table ready as fast as I can . 
 I'm so hungry . Shall we go eat now , Rick ? 
 How about some dumplings ? I just can't get enough of them . 
 Well , what do you have in mind ? 
 Oh , it's too spicy for me . Don't you remember last time when I tasted the lamb ? It Was so spicy my eyes teared up ! 
 Sounds great . Do they serve noodles ? I am in the mood for some tasty noodles as well . 
 Great . Let's go ! 
 What kind of films do you like best ? 
 I don't like feature films . I think sometimes it loses contact with reality . I like to see some documentary films . What kind of feature films do you like best ? 
 You are sort of romantic . 
 16 hours . Beijing is 16 hours ahead . 
 We are gaining a day . 
 That's right . 
 Sorry , I can ’ t ! I have to go to work , pick up Jake and Maddie from school , and make them an afternoon snack , then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class . 
 Oh , I don ’ t know ... it ’ s hard to find the right nanny . You have to consider her previous work experience , the responsibilities you give her , and how she interacts with the kids . I would love to have someone to help me out , though . 
 Oh , that ’ s great . Thanks Grace . Can you give me her number ? I ’ ll talk it over with Dan and give her a call tomorrow . Maybe this way I won ’ t be so tired every day , and Dan and I might even get to go on a date once in a while . 
 Yes , we are almost ready to order . 
 Oh , that all sounds so good ! Can we get the sauce on the side ? 
 I was wondering if you have any vegetarian choices . 
 I think that I would like to order the broccoli noodles , please . 
 Please bring our salads to us now . We are hungry ! 
 Yes , of course . What is it ? 
 Leave ? Why ? 
 What do you mean by something different ? 
 I'm really sorry . But I understand . 
 Hi , is that Mr . Wu ? 
 I am calling to query about some of your information . 
 I said I want to ask about some of your information . 
 Mr Edgar , hello ! How's business ? Still booming ? What can we do for you today ? 
 What we can do is to assign you a customer manager , that way you can just deal with him . You don't need to deal with anyone else . 
 I want to rent a formal suit here.Do you have a purple dress here ? 
 I am a size 6 . 
 This is just my size . How much is the rent 
 Can I help you ? 
 Come here , please . 
 I don't like the style . 
 Black is not my favorite colour . 
 It's pretty . How much is it ? 
 It's too expensive . Can you come down a little ? 
 I'll buy it if forty . 
 Can I get you any dessert ? 
 Excellent choice . ( He brings her the pie . After she finishes , the waiter comes back . ) Would you like anything else ? 
 Here you are . Thank you and have a nice evening . 
 If you like you can try it on.The fitting room is in the corner . 
 I think it fits you . It flatters your figure . 
 Here's the picture of my family . 
 OK.She ' s near-sighted , with a pair of glasses on her nose.She is the only one wearing glasses in my family . 
 I feel itchy ! I can ’ t stand it anymore ! I think I may be coming down with something . I feel lightheaded and weak . 
 What ’ s wrong ? 
 Maybe it ’ s just a rash or an allergy ! We can ’ t be sure until I see a doctor . 
 Are you serious ? You always blow things out of proportion . In any case , I think I ’ ll go take an oatmeal bath . 
 Your company has a very good reputation , and I have been planning to visit it for a long time . What's the advantage of your factory over other plastics ones ? 
 Could you tell me the cost of production per unit ? 
 Mr . Smith , how was your flight ? 
 What was the weather like in New York ? 
 What a wonderful dinner ! 
 Where did you get your fantastic recipes ? 
 I especially like the wonderful chicken dish . 
 Is that shrimp in the soup ? 
 I am happy that the wine I brought for you works well with this meal . 
 First of all , thank you for accepting this job . 
 What are your salary expectations ? 
 We ’ ll offer you a monthly salary to begin with , in addition , we offer one percent commission and all your sales . You also enjoy life insurance and health insurance . What ’ s starting salary would you expect here ? 
 That sounds reasonable . 
 Yes , you have 2 weeks paid vacation a year , and you get it additional week after 4 years , and then again , after 9 years if you decide to stay that long , we promote from within based on performance , so there is an excellent chance that you could become a sales manager or even a regional manager . 
 Good morning . Would you like to tell me something about the computer ? I've never seen this brand before . What is your superior brand ? 
 Can you tell me the specialty of your computer board ? 
 What's the memory capacity of the computer ? 
 Can you give me a wholesale list ? 
 Is the price negotiable ? 
 What's wrong with you ? 
 How long has it been like this ? 
 Do you have a sleeping problem ? 
 I think you'd better have a further exam , and before the result comes out , try to relax yourself and take the medicine before you sleep . It will help you to kill the pain and make you sleep well . 
 When the result comes out , I will tell you about it . Remember , never be afraid or be too tired . 
 A friend told me I might find a room here . 
 What do you charge ? 
 Fine.Would it be OK to look at the room ? 
 Chris , where are you going ? 
 Really ? I need to go to the store too . 
 Yeah , let's go together . 
 Now . 
 Now would be better . 
 Should we walk ? 
 Can I pay my bill here ? 
 How much is the charge ? 
 Do you receive checks ? 
 Here is my card . 
 OK , sir . We will be there right now ... sir , your table is ready . 
 Sure , here you are . 
 Not much . 
 Oh really ? I didn't know that . 
 I haven't heard anything about it . 
 What time does it start ? 
 Yeah , I think I'll go . 
 You will . 
 Still , you should not let down your guard . Some details should be paid attention to . 
 You can also ask the interviewer about your performance today . 
 And it's best to ask about the second interview if necessary . 
 You can ask questions about the position you are applying for . 
 Of course . 
 Besides , remember to make acknowledgments through an E-mail or a call . 
 From 6:00 to 9:00 . 
 Certainly , Sir . What would you like to have ? 
 Fine.Have a nice stay here . 
 No problem . But , the postage is much higher than the regular package . 
 OK . All the registered airmail packages can be received in 5 working days . 
 It's 500 dollars . 
 Sure ! Please just fill in your I . D . number and ways to contact you here . 
 You had better include that because it is easier for the mailmen to find the correct mailing address . 
 Here is your receipt . Contact us if your friend still doesn't receive the package after 5 work days . 
 I'd like some info about your Payroll Services , please . 
 I see . How is it paid ? I mean , what payment methods are possible ? 
 That sounds pretty good . Tell me , must we use the same payment method for all of our employees ? 
 That sounds just perfect . I'll talk things over with some colleagues and get back to you . Thank you very much for the information . 
 What ’ s the number you are calling , please ? 
 What ’ s the name of the person you are calling ? 
 Thanks . What ’ s your name and phone number , please ? 
 Thank you . I ’ ll put the call through for you . Hold on the line , please . 
 Would you mind if I helped out in the kitchen instead ? I do enjoy cooking . 
 Cooking makes me feel relaxed . So , what are we cooking ? 
 Sure . We should probably pre-heat the oven right away , too . 
 That's a bit high for lasagne . I'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there . 
 You know , I could do this myself . Why don't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ? 
 Well , if it's not broken , then you need to learn how to vacuum better , because it doesn't look like you've vacuumed for ages ! 
 Have you taken your temperature ? 
 Well , open your mouth and let me have a look . It is nothing serious . You haven't got a fever . But you should take the medicine and need have more rest recently . When you feel well , you could take more exercises , or play sports like basketball , running , and swimming . And eating healthy food , having more fruits and vegetable and drinking milk are good for your heath . 
 Good morning , welcome to Bank of the USA . How may I help you today ? 
 Okay , have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ? 
 It ’ s alright , I will take you through the procedure . Are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ? 
 Okay , I ’ ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank ’ s address and phone number . 
 Well . You ’ Ve come prepared.You have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . It ’ s a simple transaction , and we can process it today . 
 It ’ s my pleasure . 
 Yes , here you are . Would you care to order now , Sir ? 
 Any vegetable ? 
 OK . Can I serve you anything else ? 
 All right . 
 Thanks . Try not to work too hard while I ’ m away ! 
 Okay-bye ! Have a nice Christmas . 
 That's right . Let's go into the details . 
 Christmas doesn't come until almost the end of the year , right ? 
 Well . I am afraid it will be difficult for us to advance the time of shipment . Our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . 
 As new orders keep pouring in , the workers are working three shifts to step up production . 
 I am sorry . 
 I said by the middle of Oct . This is the best we can promise . 
 Good . Let's call it a deal . We will do our best to advance the shipment , but your L / C should be opened early Sep . 
 This way , please . We've got a nice private for you . 
 Here we are . I hope you will like it . 
 And here is the menu . I'll come back soon . 
 If we employ you , what starting salary would you expect ? 
 I think your background and experience are worth the compensation . 
 No , there are annual bonuses , one week paid vacation a year , and health insurance . 
 Shall we discuss the packing ? You know , a well-designed package helps sell the goods , so the products must not only be superior in quality , but also attractive in appearance . I'd like to see the sample of packing . 
 Quite good . The beautiful design and bright color are just the European taste . How are you gonna pack these blouses ? 
 Wonderful . 
 Sure ! You just basically gotta let the caller know who they called , and ask them for their contact information so you can call them back . 
 That's more or less the idea , but try something that sounds more friendly . 
 A little too friendly Abby . Just say this , " Hi , you have reached Abby . I am unable to answer your call right now , but if you leave me your name and phone number , I will get back to you as soon as possible . Thanks " . 
 Is that the latest issue of Reader you're reading ? 
 I know . I have been a subscriber for the past two years . 
 I'm not exactly sure , but it's not that expensive at all . 
 Why did you do that ? 
 It's the same in my family . The coffee table in my living room is covered with copies of Fashion . 
 I'm afraid you are beginning to look a little overweight . You really need to stop smoking . That's the main reason you're unhealthy . 
 Why don't you try smoking one cigarette less each day ? How many do you smoke each day now ? 
 Ok . So for one month , reduce the number you smoke by one a day . At the end of the month , you'll have quit . You should also buy a tracksuit and go jogging every morning . You don't need to jog far . 
 Be careful when you go jogging . Don't put yourself under too much stress . You're still a smoker shouldn't do too much exercises in your condition . 
 Good idea . Remember to eat healthily too . The trainers at the fitness centre will be able to advise you on your diet . 
 Great . Thanks . 
 I would like to transfer some money . 
 Take it from my savings account . 
 I want it transferred into my checking account . 
 I would like to transfer $ 200 . 
 That ’ s it for today . Thank you . 
 Just a few cookies . 
 Excuse me , I want to know the price of your CPU . 
 It's rather too high . If you can make it cheaper , we will be able to place large orders continuously . 
 Well , can you explain it to me ? 
 Can you reduce more ? 
 In that case , we have to stop ordering if a reduction can't be made . Please reconsider . 
 If you can give us a more reduction , We'd be able to give you an order on the spot . 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 What kind of grapes do you want ? 
 Ok , wait a moment please . 
 Trust me . 
 Well , I'm afraid we've had a slight delay . 
 The cement arrived late but don't worry , I'm confident we can still meet the deadline . The crew is on stand-by and as soon as the concrete has set we can get started again . 
 Yes , sir ? 
 I'm very sorry , sir . I'll ask the manager to take care of this . 
 I hope to apply my knowledge and experience on the job and make further improvement . 
 It is quite important for all of us . Without clear goals , one may lose direction and cannot pave the way for their future . 
 As a graduate , it may be more important to develop myself effectively in my future work . And whatever job I may take , I will make the best efforts . 
 I will make full use of the chance and get myself ready for the challenges all the time . 
 Salary is , admittedly , important , but I will care more about what I can learn from the job . 
 I would take it . After all , interest is not the only thing one should care about . 
 There are such shops living on selling parts . I don ’ t like their service either . All they want is your money . But in the long run , they will be losing costumers . Anyway , car service business is new in China . We all have to control what they are doing . Otherwise , they will not improve . 
 Yes , there is . Those organizations exist . You always can call a lawyer if you need legal help . 
 Glad to meet you . This way , please . 
 But it's quite convenient for you to go to any part of the city . The subway is nearby . 
 What companies are stockholders in this company , do you know ? 
 What section would you like to work in if you enter this company ? 
 What type of work will you expect to do at first ? 
 What are your plans for the future ? 
 How long does it take to get here from your home ? 
 How long do you think that we can depend on your working here ? 
 You are single now , but what will you do when you get married ? 
 Do you think you will want to continue working here even after you ’ Ve had a child ? 
 What ideas do you have if we employ you ? 
 Do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ? 
 If you are employed by us , how are you going to do your part of the work ? 
 If you fail to do your work well , what are you going to do ? 
 What do you think if you do not have much spare time on this job ? 
 What are your expectations from working on this job ? 
 If you were choosing a person for this job , what kind of individual would you select ? 
 If we do not employ you , what are you going to do ? 
 We ’ re having a department meeting at 10 o ’ clock , ok ? 
 See Julie , the receptionist . She knows where all that stuff is kept . You might like a calendar for you desk . She can give you one of those too . 
 The photocopier is near my office . Come on , I ’ ll show you where it is . 
 Yes , I do . Everyone ’ s really friendly . Sometimes , I wish I worked outdoors more , especially during the summer . 
 We usually tell each other where we are with various clients and potential clients . The boss assigns extra duties to people who she thinks can best deal with them . It ’ s also a chance to put forward su 
 I'd love to . Do you often come here to dance ? 
 You are waltzing quite wonderfully . It's great to dance with a experience and talent partner . 
 Ok , that would be great . Do you like modern dance ? I don't care for it . 
 I'm going to paint the house today . 
 Maybe not . Could you buy some while you're out ? 
 I had a job interview this morning . 
 Pretty well , I think . 
 I have just checked in this afternoon . I am wondering what shall I do if I want to have some clothes washed . 
 That's convenient.Thank you . 
 Yes , I'm looking for a job as a clerk typist in English . 
 My name is B . How are you , Miss Kelly ? 
 Thank you , Miss Kelly . 
 I can type 120 words a minute and I take shorthand at 80 words a minute . 
 Yes , I would . 
 Yes , I'd like to give it a try . 
 Hi ! This is John Li , is my car fixed yet ? 
 Excuse me , where can I find a guide ? 
 Thanks a lot . Have a nice day . 
 Bobby ! Come here , look what I got you ! 
 A chess board ! Daddy is going to teach you how to play ! 
 Ok , each player gets 16 pieces . You can be the white ones and I ’ ll play with the black pieces . Now in the front , you set up the pawns . Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . When you are about to capture another piece , it can move one space diagonally . 
 See this one that looks like a tower ? It ’ s called the rook . The one with the tall hat is called the bishop . See this little horsey ? This is called the knight , it ’ s a very important piece so it ’ s best to not let your opponent capture it . 
 That ’ s right ! That ’ s the queen and that ’ s the king . If the other player captures your king , he will say ” Check Mate ” and the game is over ! Doesn ’ t this sound fun ? 
 I came to this lab to have my blood drawn . 
 What am I being tested for ? 
 What does my white blood cell count tell him ? 
 How much will it hurt ? 
 Is that my blood going into that tube ? 
 Good afternoon . Can I help you ? 
 Of course , that's no problem at all . 
 How much would you like to change ? 
 Please fill in this exchange form , and I'll need to see your passport , and sign here . That's the money and your passport back . Of course , if you don't spend all of it , you can come back and we'd be happy to buy the local currency back from you . 
 What size pan were you thinking of ? 
 Well , this one might work for you . 
 Here , lift this aluminum pan . It's the same size . 
 Here's a similar aluminum pan . But it has a heat-resistant handle . 
 I knew we'd find the right pan sooner or later . How would you like to pay ? 
 Oh , no problem . Here's the lid that comes with the pan . 
 Don't you think it's a little early to be looking for schools ? We haven't even had the baby yet ! 
 You are going to be such an adorable father ! Tell me about this school . 
 What about inside the school ? 
 I think our child is going to love it ! 
 How would you like to send it ? 
 Sixty cents please . 
 Please write down the zip code in the mailing address . 
 OK . please give me twenty cents . 
 You're welcome . 
 Really ? Let ’ s hit the road . 
 That's right . Let's go into details of it . 
 Christmas doesn't come until the end of the year , does it ? 
 Well , I'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment . Our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . 
 They are already working three shifts a day to step up production as new orders keep pouring in . 
 I'm sorry . 
 By the middle of October . This is the best we can do . 
 Good . Let's call it a deal . And we'll do our best to advance the shipment , but your letter of credit should be opened early September . 
 Yes , sir . What'll it be for you ? 
 Is there anything else ? 
 Is this to go or to eat here ? 
 Here you are . That's eight fifty . 
 It's on the service counter over there . 
 Hello . I called earlier in the week and spoke to someone in the personal loans department about an overseas study loan . She said to come in as soon as I had the chance , as this must be done in person . I'd like to apply today . 
 Yes , yes . It's all here . There you go . I'm not sure if I need any other proof or guarantee to get this loan , do I ? 
 Yes , I read about all of these in the brochure and decided which would be more suitable for me . I'd like to go for the guarantee mode , please . 
 OK , that's perfect , 70 % is excellent , it'll be a big help . Thanks . 
 Sure . My number is 545-8897 , and I live at 908 Mulbury Street . 
 That ’ s right . 
 I ’ m sorry , Jeff . Please don ’ t interrupt me right now . I ’ m in the middle of a conversation . 
 That ’ s all right . I ’ ll be finished in a little while . 
 My stomach is bothering me . 
 I had a ham sandwich with mayonnaise for lunch . 
 It could be bad food , but I didn ’ t feel so well yesterday , either . 
 I haven ’ t been under any more stress than usual . 
 I feel like maybe I am coming down with the flu . 
 Take me to the railroad station . Can you put my baggage in the trunk ? 
 Over there . 
 They're just gifts I bought . Don't worry . They are not heavy . 
 Thanks , but I don't want to put you into any trouble . 
 What are you doing ? 
 You are shopping for a pillow online ? That ’ s absurd ! 
 I see , but how do you pay for it ? How do you know you aren ’ t going to be ripped off by the seller ? 
 Wow , that sounds pretty safe . So how do you pay ? Do you need a credit card ? 
 Do you think I can find a sweater for my dog online ? 
 Let ’ s do it ! 
 I know , sweetie . Just open wide . Don't talk . 
 Oh , you've got a fever . One-oh-one ... time to break out the children's Tylenol . 
 We're not turning on the heater in May ! You need to take a bath . We'll heat you up and see if you can sweat this thing out . 
 Alright , Ma'am . What items would you like to order today ? 
 You may tell me both , Ma'am . 
 The Merriman satin sheets ? 
 And what size would you like ? 
 Alright , Ma'am . And what color did you want ? 
 So that is product number MS2119 , Size 
 Certainly . 
 Satin is like silk , Ma'am . It feels like silk . But it's a different material . 
 Anything else today ? 
 Alright . With shipping charges , your total will be 68 dollars . Will you be paying with credit ? 
 Visa , Master Card , or American Express ? 
 Card number ? 
 Expiration date ? 
 All right , Ma'am . I will run that charge for you . And then I will get your address in a moment 
 Who will meet you at the airport ? 
 Oh , then I will arrange one of my staff to meet you at the airport . 
 Yes . We have socks made of various materials . These socks are of imported wool . 
 Yes , absolutely . 
 Here . We have black , white and transparent panty-hose here . 
 That's right , Ms . Bower . How are you ? I'm not sure if I ’ ll be able to fit you in this week , I ’ m afraid . 
 All right , then . Why don't we say next Tuesday at 11:30 a . m . ? 
 Just about . It should be done in the next couple of days . Why ? 
 I ’ ll give him a call . 
 Better now . We are just back from the hospital . We were lucky to meet a well-known doctor . 
 He said that he had a really bad cold . 
 The dispensary closed . Here is the given prescription . 
 Probably not . Some medicine we need is ethical drug which you can't buy without a prescription . 
 I'll go back home with Danny . You go to the pharmacy again . 
 What ? How come ? The third time ? 
 Be careful . 
 I'm afraid I can't . Parking is not allowed here . 
 There is a square in front of us , we can park the car there . 
 I'm not sure , you know I'm not familiar with the city , too . 
 No , that's too risky . 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Have you decided which city you want to go ? 
 That's $ 400 and we will visit 4 cities . 
 There are several types of medications that we can try for your high blood pressure . 
 For water retention , I am going to start you on Hydrochlorothiazide , which is a diuretic . 
 You need to stay hydrated on this drug , but most people experience little side effects . 
 For now I want you to take a second drug , Lisinopril , an ACE inhibitor . 
 The most you will experience will be a dry cough but you probably won ’ t experience anything negative . 
 I have no idea . I have no appetite . 
 Let's go there then . Is it a Chinese restaurant ? 
 I hope so . 
 How much is a round-trip ticket to London ? 
 In the second week of September . 
 In that case , I'll go after the 15th . How much are the off-season fares ? 
 Okay , I'll take it . ( to be continued ) 
 Do you know what kind of pass you want ? 
 There are passes for a day , month , and week , and there are student passes . 
 Let me see your student ID . 
 Thank you very much . 
 The monthly sticker is $ 24 , but the actual pass is free . 
 We appreciate your business . 
 Do you have any homework today ? 
 Go and do it now . 
 Good idea ! I've heard that the Expo is doing pretty well now , and ads are seen everywhere in the country on all means of media , newspapers , TV , street signs , etc . 
 what's interesting to see there ? 
 I visited the First International Flower Festival in the city last year , and was impressed with so many beautiful flowers ! 
 It would be a rare occasion to be able to appreciate so many fine species of Chinese and foreign flowers fully blooming in one park ! 
 Have you ever sung with a karaoke ? 
 Karaoke has become a major entertainment . I wonder why . 
 How much fun is there in singing in front of other people , especially if you don't sing well ? 
 I wouldn't do that . 
 Can I take your order please ? 
 Sure . Anything to drink with that ? 
 Eating here or to go ? 
 That's 7 dollars and 25 cents . You can get free refills with your coke . 
 Yeah.But Bob's talent can't to be named on the same day with Carl's . 
 We cannot judge a man totally by that . 
 What a good idea ! 
 We could go to more places this time , if you liked . 
 When shall we go and look ? 
 No , let's go on Saturday . 
 Where shall we go ? 
 No , I don't like that place . Why don't we try the garage Martin recommended ? 
 What's your name ? 
 A nice name , isn't it ? 
 Where do you live ? 
 Oh , It's really far from here . May I ask how old you are ? 
 You look very young . 
 Where is your birthplace ? 
 What is the matter with you ? 
 How long have you been like this ? 
 I think you've got a flu.Take this prescription to the chemist's and then go back and sleep . 
 Don't worry about your flu . You will be OK soon . 
 Do you have any questions ? 
 What fees are you referring to ? 
 We charge a small fee every time you overdraft . 
 For each time you overdraft , you have to pay $ 25 . 
 You shouldn ’ t overdraft . 
 Do you need help with anything else ? 
 Taxi ! Taxi ! 
 I ’ d like to go to the railway station please . 
 Is it a long run to the station ? 
 The streets are heavy with traffic at this time of a day , are they ? 
 Is it the rush hour now ? 
 No , I ’ m not . Would you please drive slowly and carefully ? 
 It's very kind of you to show me around . 
 I really don't know . 
 Yes , that would be lovely . 
 No , it's the first time I've been here . 
 That's wonderful ! I have heard the scene of Li River is beautiful ! 
 How would you like this order shipped ? 
 Are you going to ship this by air ? That might cost a little more . 
 I'll check the costs and call you back . 
 I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment . 
 Yes . I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on . 
 Yes , I want to get a better job . 
 I'm quitting because of the lousy salary and all the difficulties I have in getting along with my colleagues . 
 I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay . 
 Good evening . Welcome to our restaurant . 
 I'm sorry , sir . The rooms are not available now . But would you like to have your dinner in the dinning hall ? I can find a table by the window for you . 
 Can I have your name , please ? 
 I'll ask waitress to show you the way . 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Why not go to Paris ? It's famous for Arch of Triumph , Eiffel , versailles and place de la Concorde . 
 Of course , we have . 
 What did you do ? 
 You have a lot of plants . 
 That takes some time . 
 I'll bet he enjoyed his walk . 
 That's a lot of work . 
 I'll bet you were hungry ! 
 What are you doing ? 
 You are sick , young lady . Get back in bed ! I called you in sick today , so you're going to lie down and fight that flu ! 
 Then maybe you should go to school . If you're feeling so much better , you'll ace that English test , right ? 
 How are you feeling , Flora ? 
 What did you watch today ? 
 And next ? 
 I know what you mean , there wasn't old action movie next . I think you won't like it . 
 Anything important happened ? 
 Hello . Manchester 6739792 . 
 Nicholas ? Nicholas Nickleby ? No . He doesn't live here any more . He's moved to Morecambe . 
 Yes . I've got it somewhere . Let me see . Where did I put it ? Ah - I remember , it's on the memo . Here it is . Do you have a pen to write it down ? 
 His number's 4945939 . 
 Then , Mary . We need 10 more loose-leaf binders , five pounds of heavy duty white paper , and what else did I say ? 
 Right . And I ’ d like one of those new electric pencil sharpeners . 
 What type of music do you like to listen to ? 
 Like what , for instance ? 
 Why is that ? 
 That's a good reason to like something . 
 Did you vote yesterday ? 
 What candidate did you vote for ? 
 I ’ m shocked he actually won . 
 How ’ d you know ? 
 What about him being black ? 
 I think you have a point . 
 Yes , sir . We have the all-inclusive luxury cruise . Maybe you would like to look at the itinerary . 
 Yes . What about this one ?

 2244 Forest Drive . 
 It ’ s quiet and clean . I love the color scheme . 
 I really like it here . 
 I have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field . My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law , where I have been able to apply my paralegal education . I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts . I really love research and analyzing facts . My major in college was English , and as a result , my writing skills are my major strength . I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used . 
 Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input . 
 There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week . Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks , my boss and I stayed until 2 a . m . for two nights before the final wrap up . It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results . My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort . 
 I remember a case that was filled with obstacles . The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch . Through some hard work and fact digging , I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done . 
 My strengths are my caring about getting the job done . I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more . 
 I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves . I asked her if I could talk with her one day , and we had a good discussion . It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure . I took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day . 
 My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job . When I first started as a paralegal , I had a lot to learn . But through hard work , advice from some good mentors and continuing education , I have come a long way . I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner . 
 First , they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm . I really enjoy working with people . Secondly , they'll say I had great customer service skills . I put the customer first . And thirdly , they'll say that I know the law . I put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal and take it seriously . 
 Yes , I do . On a scale of one to 10 , what would you say morale was in this company ? 
 I am going to the Capital Hotel . 
 About how much it will cost ? 
 On the meter ? 
 OK.let ' s go . 
 That's right . I've only had some part-time jobs working in department stores . 
 Yes , I liked math in school . 
 Yes , I enjoy working with people . 
 Yes , I had an American tutor for two years . I had two lessons under her every week . Would I be using English every day is this job ? 
 No , I'm afraid I don't . I'd be glad to learn . 
 Would you mind doing something for me ? 
 Will you please explain the meaning of this word ? 
 What games do you like ? 
 How about a game of bridge ? 
 What about guessing games ? 
 Let's play other game . 
 OK . 
 Sure . If you get on this road and turn left at the second intersection , you'll see it on your right-hand side . 
 You are welcome . 
 Do you have to work late at the computer company again tonight ?

 What do we need for the barbecue ? 
 I can ’ t wait to start cooking ! I ’ Ve bought the grill and charcoal . Do you have enough plates and utensils ?

 I brought some cheese to make cheeseburgers and some onions for the hot dogs . We ’ ll need some tomato ketchup and some barbecue sauce . 
 How long does it take to cook meat on a barbecue ? 
 They can cook it themselves to make sure it ’ s exactly how they like it .

 How did the business trip go ? 
 I understand . The last time I went on a business trip with the boss , I didn't even have enough to eat ! 
 Our company is quite conscious of the environmental problems that frequent flying causes .

 No problem . Did you bring any gifts back for your department ?

 Hello , how are you today . Here for your six month check-up ? 
 Oh , fine . Let's take a look . 
 Okay , I'll do that , but my crown was just put on last year . Will my dental insurance cover the work ? 
 Thanks , doctor . 
 Because that company's behavior is not in accordance with international law . 
 Yes , I suppose we must . I have enjoyed all these days that you have spent with me , and I'll always remember them . I've learned a lot from you . Thank you for all your kindness . 
 I hope so , too . 
 I'm really glad to hear that 
 Good-bye , Mr White . A happy journey home , and hope to see you again soon .

 Hello Mary . I haven ’ t seen you for ages . Are you still seeing Paul ? 
 Did you break up amicably ? Sometimes couples row a lot before splitting up . 
 Yes , I am . We ’ re thinking about getting engaged . We ’ Ve been dating for over a year now . 
 I havn't seen her for a while.She stopped seeing nick because he was cheating on her.He was seeing a girl form his office.One day , she saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately . 
 Really ? They ’ Ve been together for a long time . When are they getting married ?

 Your performance so far is not quite in line with what we expect for our executives . I hope I ’ Ve made my point . 
 Not much . I started exercising . 
 Yeah , and I need to start improving my health . 
 That's about all . 
 Sleep is good too . I heard people who sleep an average of eight hours a day have less health problems . 
 True . But I think it is worth it . When you get old , you want to be healthy and active . 
 Indeed . Online banking enables you to make on-line shopping . 
 Bring your ID card and fill out a form . That will be fine . 
 I think online banking can change your money habits and it is quicker than ATM processing speed .

 We got lost coming back . I guess I don't really know this town yet . 
 No . We took a wrong turn somewhere.And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions.But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost . 
 I know I could have . But finally we asked someone where we were . 
 Guess where we ended up . 
 When we finally decided to ask someone , they told us we were in Grangerfield . 
 I don't know.The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here . 
 I know it is . I don't know how it happened . 
 What ? 
 How ? 
 Oh , that's what you think , huh ? 
 You know what , Trish ? 
 I hope so . I really hope so . 
 No , I wasn't . It's kind of hard to watch the road when Joseph is behind the wheel . 
 Teachers are just directors who give scope to the students ' initiative and creativeness , instead of taking their rights away from speaking . 
 I divided students into groups and asked them to generate their own ideas actively . It can help develop the problem-solving ability of the students . 
 They wanted to go out , and so they made me look after my baby brother . 
 No , I didn't . My brother was very good and I did quite a lot of homework . 
 Not really . I watched television for an hour . 
 Boxing . It was excellent .

 I'd like to try some Chinese food . 
 I have no idea . Could you recommend some to me ? 
 Oh , I see . I'd like to have hot food . 
 Really ? So do you have some specialties ? 
 All right . I'll have them . 
 So you knew it was me ? 
 Look , before we get into the secret admirer thing , I want to talk to you about WebTracker . 
 So you're really planning to quit invoking and switch over to WebTracker ? 
 Want to send out for some Chinese ? 
 Some Chinese food . I ’ m hungry , and there ’ s a take-out restaurant near here . We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat . 
 Okay . I could go for that . It ’ s called Al ’ s Steakhouse . They also have great fried fish , and I love their salad bar . You can go back to refill 1 your plate as often as you like .

 Here's your bill . 
 Certainly . 
 Goodbye . Hope to see you again . 
 Yes . I can't find my sweater . I have my laundry sent to you yesterday but when the washing is done . I find my swatter missing . 
 That's fine . Maybe you should be more careful . 
 You should wear a formal dress and be confident . 
 You should take several resumes and some copies of your graduate diploma . 
 I don't know exactly . I only hear it's financed by a famous film star . 
 Yes , so it really doesn't matter who offers the money.The paper itself is profitable . 
 All right.How about other guests ? 
 OK . 
 I'm afraid we have no more sole . 
 Certainly.Just a moment , sir . 
 Let me try . It has to be somewhere amazing , and far away ... Egypt ? 
 Yes . I overheard your mom and my mom talking in the grocery store . 
 I wish our family took outrageous summer vacations like yours . 
 We'll get to go fishing at the river . I hate fish . 
 No problem . What do you want me to get ? 
 Did you forget to put anything on the list ? 
 Would you like me to go anywhere else for you ? 
 Has your prescription been filled yet ? 
 Sure , I'll go get it for you . 
 Anything for you . 
 OK , sir . How many are coming ? 
 We require a jacket and tie . 
 Let me ask some questions . Do you know what people need to get entry into China ? 
 What materials do they need in order to apply the passport ? 
 Do you think we should travel by bus or by train ? 
 We could face delays if we travel by bus , thanks to traffic jams . 
 That ’ s true , but I feel that I see more when I travel by bus . 
 So , which form of transport do you prefer to use ? 
 Ok them . We ’ ll go by train . I ’ m sure we ’ ll have a good journey . Shall we go to the station and buy the tickets ? 
 We should take a packed lunch on the journey . The food they sell on the trains is always expensive .

 It is ok . You look really pale and red eyes . I suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest . 
 Did you see the woman that just left my office ? 
 She's another applicant , and a leading contender , but I didn ’ t want to hire her . She ’ s qualified , but she doesn ’ t quite fit the profile . We ’ re looking for an accountant , and part of the job requires interacting with clients . Well , our clients want conservative people to handle their money . And green hair with ripped jeans doesn ’ t exactly fill them with trust . 
 I realize that , but our business is serving clients and giving them what they want . 
 Well , they don ’ t want to deal with people who look like that . They want people who look more like yourself . 
 Well , they ’ re older , and they don ’ t understand today's fashions . When they see someone dressed like that , warning bells go off . They don ’ t like that style at all , and they don ’ t like dealing with people who dress like that at work . 
 We used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good , very good . But , the clients reacted very negatively when they saw her . Some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively . 
 Well , she was a very good employee and we wanted to keep her , so her supervisor called her in for a chat and laid it on the line for her . She got the idea and now she saves the trendy styles for evenings and weekends . 
 Excuse me ? Do you have anything for a carsickness ? 
 Oh , it's for my brother . The little boy over there . He is getting a carsickness . 
 Thank you so much . 
 Sorry to interrupt , but my brother is still sleeping . 
 Yes . It's so strange that he slept all the time after taking the pills . 
 What ? 
 I see . 
 Three . Two adults and one kid . 
 Yes . How much do you charge for it ? 
 I see . Where can I get the food ? 
 Do I need to pay extra charges for drinks like cola and juice ? 
 Could you give me a taxi to pick me up and take me to the airport before 1:00 p . m . ? 
 I live in room 1106 of the Friendship Hotel . 
 What do you think about half day kindergarten for Stacey ? 
 I just think it will be a little difficult for her to be away from home for so long right off the bat . 
 I think she is really going to like her teacher though . 
 Did you happen to notice if she was interested in any of the other kids ? 
 I need to buy a bus pass . 
 What are the different kinds ? 
 Could I get a student pass , please ? 
 Sure , here it is . 
 How much for the pass ? 
 Okay , I'll take it . 
 You are welcome . 
 Do you know what kind of salad that you want ? 
 I usually make a Caesar salad . 
 Which kind of salad are you going to make ? 
 I enjoy chicken salads . 
 I really like how that sounds . 
 I'm going to do that then . 
 I need some advice about my fixed deposits . 
 No , no problem . It's just that one of them is due and I'm not sure how to deal with it . 
 Mmmm ... well , I am happy with your service so far , so I'd like to renew it , please . 
 Yes ... 
 That's just perfect for me . I live pretty far from the centre and it can be a chore getting in . 
 No way . Do it yourself . 
 OK , I'll iron your shirt for you , but only if you make me a cup of coffee . 
 Well , I have been in the computer engineering field for 6 years now . I am familiar with both hardware and software and with hands-on experience in system development including system analysis and design . 
 I have worked on about every system that is out right now . 
 I am not as familiar with it as I am with some of the older systems . But I am a fast learner and I can master it in a short time . 
 I am knowledgeable and levelheaded . 
 Yes , Mr . Miller . We'll use the conference room on the third floor for the meeting . 
 In the dining room . It's spacious there . 
 I've arranged for an interpreter to be present . But it is said these foreigners could speak English . 
 We've prepared name cards to be put on the conference table for guests to sit by . What time would you like refreshments served , Mr . Miller ? 
 All right , I see . 
 Yes . Go down the main road . You can't miss it . 
 It's only about a five-minute walk . 
 You're welcome . 
 Do you have an appointment ? 
 Yes , we do . I can cut your hair right now if you like.Do you need a shampoo too , or just a haircut ? 
 Alright . I will have an assistant wet your hair . Then I can cut it.Please step over there.How would you like your hair cut today ? 
 I recommend you leave it a little long on top.But we should take in the back and sides a bit more . That's more fashionable now . 
 So I will cut the sides just above the ear . Is that good ? 
 And do you usually part your hair along here ? 
 Alright , I know just what to do.Your hair seems quite dry , you know . And I see some split ends . 
 The problem is the split ends . They make your hair look even more frizzy . 
 Well , there are two things you can do.First , don't blow-dry your hair for so long after you shower . Let it dry naturally.That is easier on the hair , so you won't get split ends.Second , buy a g 
 Of course . I have one I can suggest . 
 The problem is the split ends . 
 Yes , we have many kinds of pies and puddings . 
 Sure . We have lemon pies , apple pies , coffee rum pies and ice cream . 
 Can you help me pick out a gift for my niece ? 
 That sounds good . Let me see one . 
 Oh , she's nice . How much is she ? 
 Well , that's reasonable . I'll take it . 
 No , thank you . 
 Oh , cash will be fine . 
 Come in , please . 
 Good afternoon . Have a seat , please . You are Mr . Sun ? 
 I have read your resume . I know you have worked for 3 years . Why did you choose to major in mechanical engineering ? 
 What are you primarily interested in about mechanical engineering ? 
 Why did you decide to apply for this position ? 
 What do you think determines an employee's progress in a company such as ours ? 
 We have several applicants for this position . Why do you think you are the person we should choose ? 
 That sounds very good . How do you see your career development ? 
 Have you anything to ask about the job ? 
 Yes . If you undertake additional courses , provided these are approved , and you complete them successfully , you can claim back part , quite a large part , 75 % of the costs you incurred . Not just the fees , - traveling and other expenses too . 
 Anything else ? 
 Well , thank you very much , Mr . Sun . I'll let you know the result of the interview as soon as possible . Goodbye . 
 I've just got a new printer . How often do I need to replace the print heads ? 
 So if I don't print out very much , it could last a lot longer ? 
 Give these sales figures a look . It's pretty depressing . We're way in the red this year . We can't afford to keep going like this for much longer . 
 Deman is dropping . The problem is our competition . They are monopolizing the market ! 
 It's really too early to tell , but a lot is riding on the new products . If we don't do better after the product launch , we may have to go bankrupt . 
 Look at this numbers and see for yourself . Read'sm and weep . 
 Mary , set your alarm clock for seven tomorrow morning . 
 I'm going to take you to your school to register for classes . 
 You can choose classes that you like at the school office . 
 Well , there are core courses and electives . 
 Core courses are ones that you must take . Elective courses are ones that you get to choose for yourself . 
 Yes , I'm looking for a new winter coat . 
 I don't know really . What's the fashional color this year ? 
 Good . Red suits me very well . It's a cheerful color , isn't it ? 
 Well , I used to be size fourteen , but I've put on a bit of weight recently , so may be sixteen . 
 I quite like this one . How much is it ? 
 Oh , that's too expensive . Aren't there any cheaper ones ? 
 Yes , I see . I'll take it . Here's $ 200 . 
 Thank you . 
 I am sorry , but we can't advance shipment . The manufacturers are fully committed . They have no stock on hand . 
 How's this then ? We propose partial shipment . We can ship whatever is ready to meet your urgent need instead of waiting for the whole lot to get ready . 
 We propose to deliver 50 % in June and the balance in Aug . 
 How can I help you today ? 
 Have you got some ID and your cash card ? 
 How many more fund units would you like to purchase today ? 
 The usual minimum purchase is 5,000 RIB . 
 I'm afraid I have to return this sweater . 
 You see , there is a run at the neck . 
 No , thank you . 
 I know Mark is your only child . You may do it differently from what I did . Sometimes I would tap their hands when they made troubles . 
 And what does your husband do ? 
 But spoiling a child is not going to do him good either ! You ’ Ve got to have patience with him and teach him . It ’ s not easy , I know . It ’ s hard . 
 Hello , is everything alright ? Can I help ? 
 Similar to a Promissory Note , yes . I can deal with that for you right here . The difference between a Promissory Note and a Bill of Exchange is that this product is transferable and can bind one party to pay a third party that was not involved in its creation . 
 That's right . We didn't issue it to you , but technically we are buying it from you . So , we become involved . 
 As long as you have all of the documentation we require you have nothing to worry about . 
 Your doctor wants to test your urine and needs a sample . 
 We need you to urinate like you normally would , and then stop and finish into the cup . 
 Leave the cup in the cubby in the restroom . Just close the cubby door and walk away . 
 He wants to know if you have bacteria in your urine , which could signal an infection . 
 We will send your doctor the results , and he will contact you . 
 All right . Where do you live , sir ? 
 Very well . Why do you want to disconnect your phone , sir ? 
 O . K . May I have your name please ? 
 Thank you . Mr . Smith . What ’ s your telephone number ? 
 Thank you . Where should I send your final phone bill ? 
 Thank you , Mr . Smith . Your phone will be disconnected after this phone call . Have a nice day . 
 As an experienced interviewer , could you tell me what kind of behavior the interviewer hates most ? 
 And we should have good sitting posture . 
 Where should I put my overcoat and briefcase after entering the office ? 
 I think that ’ s the reason why Princess Diana ’ s hair style became so popular . 
 I ought to respect other people ’ s privacy , as most Westerners do . 
 Good day to you . How can I be of service today ? 
 I see . Well , this bank offers many different accounts of this nature . There are 7 to choose from 
 Well , you could change your Australian dollars into , say British pounds and then open an account . How does that sound ? 
 Welcome aboard . 
 Let me have a look at your boarding pass . It's E - 6 , the sixth seat by the aisle . 
 Okay , I want to change 22,000 . 
 Okay , here you are . ( She hands the completed form and the money to the clerk . ) 
 Thank you very much . 
 Miss Gray , would you please type this report for me ? 
 Can you print it out before 12 o'clock ? I need it this afternoon . 
 Please double space it and print it out on the laser printer so I can read it easily . 
 Please type it in a formal style . 
 No , thanks . 
 I lost one of my contact lenses , and I ’ m searching high and low for it . 
 Thank you very much . I think I lost it near the window . 
 Now , how would you like this check cashed , madam ? 
 Here you are . 
 Just make out a deposit slip and come here during bank hours . That's from 9 a . m . to 3 p . m .

 Don ’ t touch that thermostat ! You don ’ t pay the bills around here ! 
 Put on a sweater ! I ’ m not gonna let you run up my heating bill just because it ’ s a bit chilly . 
 When I was your age , my parents didn ’ t have central heating like you do ! We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it . We used it to cook , heat the house and even dry our clothes ! We never caught a cold . You should be grateful ! 
 Yes , we'd have your regular dinner . What courses are there , please ? 
 All right , we'll have it . 
 Do you have some chocolate cakes ? 
 OK , we will choose it . 
 Is everything ready for the big family barbecue tomorrow ? 
 We should also cook a couple dozen hot dogs and kebabs . 
 Great ! I asked Grace to bring cups and serviettes as she is also bringing two big coolers for the beers . 
 In my opinion , it may be necessary to charge for participation . 
 Then what is your opinion ? 
 Let's see if we forget anything . 
 Yes , let's go . Lock the door , please . 
 Hey , what's up ? 
 I'm throwing a party on Friday . 
 You didn't ?

 Welcome to the International Business Department . How can I help you ? 
 No problem , I can do that for you right now . Have you checked the documents ? 
 Of course , that's all part of the service . 
 Don't worry ; I'm sure it will be fine . If I do have any queries I'll call you , OK ? 
 Okay Rebecca , well I think you ’ Ve given me a clear impression of your positive qualities , but let ’ s talk a little bit about your weaknesses . 
 Definitely , but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be ? 
 So would you say if things don ’ t go your way at work it could easily get you down ? 
 Well , you know journalism is a highly competitive world , so you do need to keep pushing yourself it ’ s true . Okay , well let ’ s move on to talk about the job position here , shall we ? 
 Lisa , can I call Taiwan ? 
 I miss my parents . 
 Can you show me how to make an overseas call ? 
 That's 886 . 
 Do you have any vacancies ? 
 How much is it ? 
 OK . Dose it include breakfast ? 
 Kate Green . 
 5 days . And could you send a bellboy to pick up my luggage ? 
 Could you keep my valuables ? 
 Thomas , could you do me a favor ? 
 Could you pick up Mrs . David from Ford Company at the Capital Airport ? 
 I'm supposed to do it , but the general manager called me last night . He said he couldn ’ t come back to Beijing as scheduled , so he asked me to attend the meeting for him . 
 Thanks a lot . It ’ s very kind of you . 
 I think Applied Sociology is a practical subject that can be widely applied to research on soci-ety and man . Hence , I chose it as my major . 
 I am sorry to say I haven't , but I have taken many other courses that concerns the PR , such as Social Psychology , Public Affairs and Mass Communication . 
 Yes . I'm coming to confirm my ticket . 
 My name is Zu Ping . In fact , I have a reservation on Flight No . 125 for Zhenjiang , leaving Beijing at 2:00 p . m . tomorrow . Now I'd like to make a change of my travel schedule . Is it possible to change my booking to the day after tomorrow ? 
 Do you have a seat available on the same flight the day after tomorrow ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Excuse me . Do you know where I can find a pay phone ? 
 Can I make an international call from that pay phone ? 
 Where can I get a phone card ? 
 Oh , I see it . Thank you . 
 Could you spell that please ? 
 Cygnet . OK , I've got that . 
 Chill ! I'm just curling my eyelashes . 
 You're such a wimp ! You're afraid of an eyelash curler . 
 It just makes my eyelashes curl upwards . 
 Sandy . Do you have a minute ? 
 Not much . I just wanted to see how you were . How ’ s married life treating you ? 
 Have you bought War Craft 2 yet ? 
 How do you like it ? 
 Did it cost very much 
 Mechwarrior is such a good game . The graphics are awesome ! 
 My roommate always wants to play it . But I told her to buy her own game . 
 I've never seen such good graphics . 
 We've got very good workshop facilities here . We do all our own servicing and most repairs . We have separate areas for welding , grinding and sawing . 
 Yes . If we don't have the facilities to deal with it here , we send it out for maintenance . 
 It depends on the job . It's actually more cost-effective than buying specialist equipment that we don't use very often . 
 I'd like to look it over before I sign it . 
 I am fully satisfied with the terms of this contract . 
 OK . Where do you want me to sign ? 
 OK . ( Sign ) Once a contract is signed , it has legal effect . 
 It's my pleasure . 
 I still have no idea what to do now . 
 I could not agree with you more . But I feel worried about what to do next as soon as I begin to write my resume . 
 Sounds good . I will do it in a jiffy . OK ! Let's put our heads together . 
 Terrific ! 
 Yes , I want one with automatic transmission . 
 Full insurance , please . 
 Nurse , I am sure to die soon . They just don't tell me the truth , I know . 
 Is what you said really true ? 
 Thank you . 
 They're so much fun to eat . You can suck all the coating off first ... 
 But that way you're not savoring it . 
 Hey ! The movie hasn't even started and they're almost gone ! 
 That's right . 
 Yes , of course . Come in . 
 I have lived here for twenty years . 
 Yes , I have been here since 1976 . 
 Because I have just retired . I want to buy a small house in the country . 
 6850 pound . 
 It's worth every penny of it . 
 Women always have the last word . 
 Yes . I have been with ABC Insurance Company for four years , and before that , I worked with the Pacific surveyor company as claim officer . 
 Yes , on the shipper's side , when the cargos arrives , all relevant documents will be forwarded to the consignee.Among other things , this party has to check carefully the content of the packing list and weight list.When cargos are found to be damaged of short landed , this party has to call for a joint survey by representatives of the shipping company and the insurance agent.Based on the survey report , they will lodge a clam for compensation . 
 I think , first of all , I would ask the consignee to produce survey report on loading , if they can't produce that I would suggest them to refer the case to their shipper . Meanwhile , bad weather could be agood excuse to refuse the responsibility . 
 Yes , I used to dispatch telex to shippers and the consignee to inform them of changes of our schedule and other information . 
 When I was college , I passed Band Six of College English Test.All the foreign business men I've dealt with say my English is quite good . 
 No problem , I love it.Thank you for granting me the interview . 
 Yes , I think so too . 
 I hope that it does rain . 
 The sky looks so clean after it rains . I love it . 
 I love most how it is at night after it rains . 
 You can see the stars so much more clearly after it rains . 
 I would too . 
 Good morning . I have a Bill of Exchange against Bank Acceptance here . I'd like to discount it . Is that possible here ? 
 Yes , I've got all that here . 
 A copy or the original ? I guess you need the original , right ? OK , I'll return shortly . 
 I have a sore throat and headache . 
 Yes , my whole body feels weak . And I really feel terrible . 
 Ok , go ahead . 
 What seems to be the problem ? 
 What ? You've got to be kidding me ! 
 Of course I did . As recognition for a job well done . Once a month I invite the most productive employee to dinner . 
 I think she's misinterpreted my intentions . What happens now ? 
 I understand that . But I hope that we can get to the bottom fo this and show Miss Brown that she misunderstood my reaction . 
 Good morning . I ’ m looking for a one-bedroom apartment downtown . 
 Well , I didn ’ t want to pay more than $ 520 a month . 
 Is it furnished ? 
 No , thank you ! I want an apartment , not a prison . 
 If only we'd remember to close it . 
 I wish I'd put it in the bank . 
 I know , I am sorry I ever bought it . 
 It's a pity they didn't take the tele . We need a new one . Anyway we can claim for all this from the insurance company . 
 are you ready to go to the bank ? 
 there ’ s problem with my bank statement . There ’ s a mistake on it . I also need to withdraw some money form the ATM . 
 that ’ s right . You ’ re going away next week . 
 I have to pay my credit bill too . If I don ’ t pay it soon , the credit card company will charge me interest . 
 Taxi ! Taxi ! 
 I ’ d like to go to the railway station please . 
 Is it a long run to the station ? 
 The streets are heavy with traffic at this time of a day , are they ? 
 Is it the rush hour now ? 
 No , I ’ m not . Would you please drive slowly and carefully ? 
 You'd like coffee , wouldn't you ? 
 What else are you going to have ? 
 That sounds good . I'm going to order the same thing . 
 Certainly.here you are . 
 Very smart ! 
 Yes . 
 Oh , yes , Mr Wang , i look at your resume you emailed , very impressive , are you a P . M . ~ meet someone like you , i was thinking of calling you this afternoon , and having a telephone interview . 
 This is the last of the milk . 
 Would you get some that new cereal we saw advertise on TV . 
 You know . The one with the silly art about how advisements have jump up and down . 
 Yeah , That ’ s the one . 
 Come on in.Let me show you the house.Isn ' t it something ? Spacious , bright and clean.And the walls were newly painted.Have you ever seen such a nice house ? 
 This is the kitchen.Every - thing's new . 
 Are you an outgoing person , or more reserved ? 
 Are you more of a follower or a leader ? 
 What basic principles do you apply to your life ? 
 I need order in the court ! 
 What do you plead ? 
 All the evidence indicates that you are guilty . 
 Is that right ? 
 Who is the guilty party ? 
 I ’ d be glad to make a deal with you . 
 this bloody computer ! 
 my computer just crashed again for the third time today ! 
 i was just opening up an attachment in an email about winning the lottery . 
 oh , no ! I thought it seemed a bit strange . 
 it's a PC . doesn't everyone have a PC in this office ? 
 what's the difference ? 
 I didn't know that . 
 yes . 
 fortunately , I saved my work right before it crashed , so it should be OK . 
 that's a good idea . I'll call them now . Thanks for your help ! 
 What is it ? 
 Let ’ s see ... ' Wanted , manager for up-and-coming firm . Must have good organizational skills . Experience a plus . Please contact Betty Sue . ' Oh , I don ’ t know ... 
 What about my resume ? 
 Thanks , Mary . You ’ re a real pal . I'll call now to set up an interview . 
 We have over sixty employees . We have about forty factory workers and technical people and the rest are admin and sales staff . We started off with only ten people , so our workforce has grown a lot . 
 It was just over two million euros last year . 
 I need a packet of cigarettes please . 
 Thanks . 
 Yes . And they don ’ t give you very much either . I ’ m still hungry . 
 Don ’ t do this ! Don ’ t do that ! You mustn ’ t do this ! You can ’ t do that ! 
 And we ’ ll all help you . 
 I think it's beautiful . I want to hang it in the living room . 
 That's the beauty of it — the imperfection . 
 Your daughter . She sold it at the school auction . 
 I guess you see the value in it , too . 
 Yes , tomorrow is my friend's birthday.Could I arrange a birthday party for him through you ? 
 I want to order a large birthday cake , several kinds of cold dishes , pastries and fruits . 
 I've got whiskey and brandy but I need some beer and soda.That ' s all . 
 Thanks a lot for calling us . Could you tell me more about what you need us to do ? 
 OK , the cost depends on the floor to move to , the distance between two places and the amount of the furniture to move . 
 Oh , let me see . It fits the second standard rates . Have a look at the contract , please . 
 No , firstly we sign the contract ; you pay 50 % of what it costs , and the rest when we finish moving . 
 OK . If any of the articles was damaged during moving , you may make a claim for compensation with our department . 
 Basically I get 5,000 RIB every month . It is a well-paid job with satisfying working hours . 
 I require 6,500 RIB per month as a start . This is my bottom line , the minimum salary I can accept . 
 What's the trouble , ma'am ? 
 What did the young man look like ? 
 To which direction did he run ? 
 Good morning ! I am a rookie in our office . 
 Nice to meet you ! My name is Peter Smith . 
 This is my first day at work ! 
 I am new to the work and I will appreciate your guidance ! 
 Thank you . It is very kind of you . 
 Something wrong ? 
 What's wrong ? 
 Do you want me to take a look ? 
 Well , if you change your mind , let me know . 
 No problem . 
 Sure . I have all kinds of tools . Just ask . I ’ ll be happy to get them for you . 
 Anything for you . Seriously , I don ’ t mind helping . 
 This sucks . I hate buying lingerie . Okay , just find something and get out of here . Alright , these are fine . Oh , no , don ’ t come over here , don ’ t come over here . 
 Um , I ’ m just having a look around . It ’ s my girlfriend ’ s birthday tomorrow . I'm trying to find her something . 
 Sure that ’ s fine . 
 Well , do you want a thong , some bikini briefs , maybe this nice pair of lacy boy shorts ? 
 Here you are , sir . I ’ m sure she ’ ll enjoy them . 
 I ’ m sorry , sir . I ’ m going to have to take a look inside your bag . 
 They arrested me for nothing . 
 They weren ’ t supposed to arrest me . 
 They didn ’ t let me go until the next morning . 
 They sure did . 
 I matched the description of a robbery suspect . 
 I want to take them to court . 
 I want to have a two-day trip around the city . 
 It's interesting . I think I will take the bus tour . By the way , what about the lodging ? 
 I think it is easier to buy a car than to maintain it . What ’ s worse , I just don ’ t trust those vehicle maintenance shops . Sometimes , they overcharge or don ’ t build those parts I have been paying for . Last week , they even tried to persuade me to buy new parts which really need not to be changed . You know , my car is just half a year old and also good brand . I was just wondering about all these . 
 Is it possible to make a compliant call to some organization what it ’ s someone gets rip-off . 
 I would like to have a continental breakfast . 
 Well , could I have coffee instead of orange juice ? 
 Welcome to Lincoln Bank . Which service do you require today ? 
 We have many loans on offer . May I ask what the purpose of the loan is ? 
 I see . What you need is one of our Petty Consumer Loans . 
 Certainly . It's quite simple really . Do you hold a resident's permit ? 
 That's great . We'll also need details of your occupation . 
 I want to open a saving account , sir . What's the proper procedure ? 
 Is there any minimum for the first deposit ? 
 What is the annual interest rate ? 
 By the way , can I open a checking account too ? 
 I decided to give it a go ! 
 A DENY shirt and one of Serena Williams ' used tennis rackets ! 
 Yep . I placed a bid for the shirt . The minimum was ten so I bet fifty ! 
 Well , there was a sign that said “ Buy now for seventy . ” 
 There are thousands of magazines published in the world to meet the needs of different readers . But only a few of them are influential world-wide . 
 But I think Digest is supposed to be the top one . Its subscribers or buyers are from all social classes , perhaps , a majority of them from the educated group . It's quite strange that the readers love it after reading it . 
 Well , how was the interview ? 
 What did the woman ask you ? 
 Did she ask you any questions about your family ? 
 Did she tell you whether you would get the job ? 
 Dad , where is the Book Building ? 
 She said that when we get off the bus , the Book Building is right by the bus stop . 
 Oh , Dad , look at the sign , please ! 
 OK , Dad , it happens . 
 Come on , I'm too tired ! 
 Sure , I promise . 
 What can I do for you , Ma'am ? 
 How old is she ? 
 We have a new-fashioned cell phone especially designed for young girls . The brand name is Nokia . 
 Sure . This is the one I will not hesitate to recommend . Its color and style is so attractive and also the quality is really reliable . 
 Sure . By the way , here are some free adornments . Would you like one ? 
 Have a seat over there . I'll pack it up for you right away . 
 I don't make idle threats . 
 I hope you're not turning into a sissy on me , Dave . 
 If we let Vince and Elvin continue to run things , invoking is going to fail . 
 I'm saying this ship needs a new captain . Are you with me , or aren't you ? 
 Um , sure . What are we having for dinner ? Do I need to put out anything in particular ? 
 Ok , should I use the fancy silverware ? 
 I ’ ll also set some cups and saucers for some coffee after dinner . 
 They are in the cupboard where you keep the gravy boat and serving dishes . Just be careful because the wine glasses are also there . 
 Are you being served , sir ? 
 Artistic tapestry is the highest expression form of the rug weaving art . How about these ones ? 
 Yes , sir . 
 Ninety dollars . 
 But considering the fine craftsmanship it is worth much more . 
 Please wait a minute , sir . 
 Yes . I want to make a remittance to New Delhi . 
 I'd like a banker's draft please . It's not really urgent . 
 Just go to the end of the store . And it will be on your right . We have all the ice creams and frozen foods back there in the freezers . 
 Please notice all of our aisles are numbered and classified by signs on the ceiling . That might help you . 
 That ’ s correct . 
 Yes , I reserved a table for six people . 
 Michael donsie . 
 Good morning . I understand that you ’ Ve got a problem with your washing machine . I ’ m from the repair company . 
 When did it first break down ? 
 Is it still under warranty . If it is and I can ’ t fix it , it would be quicker and easier to exchange it for a new one . 
 Ok . I ’ ll start by looking at the motor . I ’ ll just unplug it and take a look inside the machine ... oh , yes . There ’ s the problem . It ’ s quite simple . I ’ ll sort it out in a few minutes . 
 Part of the motor is loose . I can put it back in place quite easily . 
 Let me take care of the check today . 
 You paid the last time , because I didn't have any money , remember ? 
 But you really should let me treat one time , I feel like I own you one if I didn't . 
 What's the damage ? 
 Check , please . 
 Yes , it's the correct thing to do . 
 Even so , we can't do business with him.he ' s not reliable . 
 Hello , Lucy , this is Monica . I ’ m calling for the accountant position . I saw the information about the vacancy on your company ’ s website . Is it still available ? 
 No , not yet . First , I want to check about the availability and see if you could give more information . 
 The notification period of my current job is not that long and I ’ m quite profession to English and I am happy with the traveling abroad as I ’ m good dealing with the people from other cultures . It makes the whole job even more interesting . I will send my resume to you still this week . 
 I would if I could . 
 Because I have other obligations . 
 We only accept payment by irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents . 
 I'm afraid not . We insist on a letter of credit . 
 Consult your bank and see if they will reduce the required deposit to a minimum . 
 Well , Mrs . Wang , you must be aware that an irrevocable letter of cred it gives the exporter the additional protection of the bank er's guarantee . We always require L / C for our exports . And the other way round , we pay by L / C for our imports . 
 I'm very sorry , Mrs . Wang . But I'm afraid I can't promise you even that . As I've said , we require payment by L / C . 
 It's a great honor to have you here , Mr.Brown . 
 I look forward to seeing you soon.Goodbye ! 
 Yes , my house is far away from here . May I ask for an apartment ? 
 That's great . Thank you so much . 
 I never really give them money because I don't want to contribute to their addictions . 
 I usually ask them if they want some food and then give them something to eat . I figure that if they're homeless , they're probably hungry . 
 almost always . However , sometimes they get mad at me for not giving them any cash . 
 the cost of living in London is just too high for most people . 
 did you know that few people can pay the rent on minimum wage , let alone pay for food and other living costs ? 
 added to that is the high unemployment rate right now . 
 politicians like to ignore the problems of the working class . They like to focus on making life easier for the upper class . 
 Have you been having any problems lately ? 
 Do you have a history of high blood pressure ? 
 High blood pressure is called the silent killer because it hardly ever has symptoms . 
 We are going to use this cuff here , and it will give me a reading . 
 They tell me how much your heart is working at rest and when pumping blood . 
 Can you tell me what bus to catch from Altadena to downtown LA ? 
 That bus goes all the way to LA ? 
 Is the bus ride long ? 
 That's all ? 
 Is there always a lot of people on that bus ? 
 Oh okay , thank you . 
 Steven , what are you thinking about ? 
 That's easy . A girl at her age must like beautiful ornaments . How about a hair pin ? 
 Well , what about a brooch ? 
 Maybe you should ask her what she wants for her birthday . 
 Hello . 
 This is Lamely . 
 Yes . 
 I'd like to.see you tomorrow . 
 Could I have my hair dyed ? 
 I want the latest fashion , can you make some suggestions ? 
 I don't think that was suit me very well , blond is kind of erratic . 
 Oh , no . I think it's better to be a natural chinese , with natural chinese hair.Have you got good brand of hair dye ? 
 I want the best one . 
 After this dye job , it feels I look younger . 
 Could I speak to you for a minute ? 
 I want to talk about this year ’ s election . 
 I am volunteering for the campaign . 
 I want to be a part of history . 
 Do you plan on voting ? 
 You should try and make it early to your polling place . 
 Hello , this is my claim tag . Can I get my baggage ? 
 Thank you . And where can I get a pushcart ? 
 Since China was open to the outside world , its trade forms have become much more flexible . One of these commonly used forms is co-production . Would you please do a bit explanation of it , Mr . Walker ? 
 I suppose that the assembling of these components and parts , particularly the marketing of the finished products should take place in China . 
 I think the principle of co-production is to expand export trade . It's a reciprocal business , isn't it ? 
 What are your terms of payment ? 
 What if we purchase an increased quantity ? Can you give us better terms ? 
 We do not have the space in our warehouse to store over 5,000 units . 
 Hi , I'd like to return this radio . 
 Here it is . 
 It does not work very well . 
 No . I'd just like a refund . 
 May I help you ? 
 I'm afraid you can't . 
 It's 100 % cotton . 
 It's already reduced 20 % . 
 Yes . Please come this way . 
 Yes , can I cash my traveler's check here ? 
 What's the cashing rate ? 
 Oh , I see . How much it the service charge ? 
 Well , I'd like to cash these four checks for $ 100 each . 
 OK , there you are . 
 Oh , I forgot to bring it . It is in my hotel room . 
 Well , thanks . I will come again this afternoon , then . 
 I didn ’ t see anything out of the ordinary , but I want you to log onto our website for a printout of all of the details . 
 If there were any major problems , I would always notify you by phone to come in . 
 A description of each test is given on the site . 
 The website will give you a normal range and then tell you what your results are . 
 Your entire test history is on the site . You can compare your results from other years . 
 I'm making three thousand yuan a month at my present work . I should not , of course , make a change for less . Could you provide me with a monthly salary of four thousand yuan ? 
 You know , Mr . Allen , Nowadays this starting salary is not high based on my skills and experience . 
 What are they ? 
 But I have my own car and my own house . 
 Thank you very much . 
 A table for two , please . 
 Thank you . It's fine . 
 What do you recommend ? We'd like some of your local specialities . 
 One cream of fish soup and two portions of prawns . 
 No , I think it's enough . 
 A juice and a coke . 
 There is a man-made fishing pond nearby . So , What do you think of going fishing there ? 
 Patience , boy . A watched pot never boils . We shall get out fishing stuff first and make some baits , too . 
 I don't think fish would like them . Instead , they love earth worms . 
 OK . I think that's enough for today . Let's go . 
 That's because you're talking to me all the time . Be patient , or there will be no chance to have sashimi for dinner today . 
 I suppose she did . Be quiet . There is a fish on the hook . Here it is . Look , a big one . 
 Great idea . But the fact is we have no barbecue with us . Moreover , the sashimi will be great . So why do we bother to waste time on barbecuing the fish ? 
 What a busy week ! 
 Right.How are you going to spend your weekend ? 
 Would you like to play some tennis with me before going home ? 
 You should try it.It ' s a great game . Come on , let me help you . I'm a good player , and a good teacher , too.What do you say ? 
 That was a pretty good shot , Mary . 
 Let me help you with your serve . 
 Of course , you can.All you need is a little help and a lot of practice . 
 Well , maybe not a Michael Zhang , but better than the average . Person would you like to play again Wednesday ? 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Could I take a look at it , please ? Let me just check these details ... right . 
 I've got the details here . 10,000 RIB sent by Mr CK Chen from Guangzhou . Could I see some ID ? You passport , for example ? 
 That's no problem . Could you please sign here ? Here's the 1,000 RIB in cash , your passport back , and the remaining balance has been deposited in your account . 
 It's really different , isn't it ? 
 I hope you're hungry because the pizza here is huge as well as to die for . 
 Well , let's order one for starters . 
 That happens to be my favorite . Waiter , I think we're ready to order . 
 Yes . 
 Yes . I'd like a crab cocktail . 
 Very well . 
 I want egg soup . 
 I'd like to have some meat . 
 No , thank you . 
 What is it ? 
 OK . Let me try it . 
 No , thank you 
 there ’ s branch on new street . Walk up this street until you get to the first set of traffic lights . Then turn right at the traffic lights . 
 not far . About 150 meters perhaps . 
 then keep walking until you reach the war memorial . It ’ s a big statue of a soldier . You can ’ t miss it . 
 you ’ ll see the national bank near the war memorial . It ’ s a big building and you ’ ll see a big sign on the front of the building . 
 Want to join me for a midnight snack ? I need to grab something to eat . 
 Let's go the food stall . There's a good one just around the corner . 
 ( Later ) Everything looks tempting . What do you want to have ? 
 Can I have a bite ? 
 Supper ! 
 I think a surprise party may be better . But I forget when her birthday is . 
 Sorry . What shall we get for her ? 
 Good idea . Shall we search on line to find an appropriate one or go to a phone store ? 
 Sure . Okay , here is the website . 
 Probably . People's consumptive habit is changing rapidly because of the internet . 
 The computer went frozen . 
 I need to open an account . 
 I want a checking account . 
 What is that ? 
 That ’ s it ? 
 What ’ ll happen if I don ’ t maintain that ? 
 How much will I be fined ? 
 Hello , I am Richard from the Brooks Head-hunter company . Can I have a private talk with you ? 
 Sure . Hi , Monica , Richard again . Have you ever heard about our company ? It is an international one with good reputation . We have a lot of successful cases . If you ’ re trying advance your career , I would love to help you . XYZ Company is one of our clients . They ’ re in need of the talent like you . Would you be interested in taking part in an interview ? It is scheduled some time within this week . 
 Ok , I see . Good luck to you . You have my number . Call me when you change your mind . I can send you more detailed information about company and jobs you might be interested in if you give me your private e-mail address . 
 You ’ re welcome . Bye . 
 What ! 
 It's my new radio earphone . 
 What were you screaming at me for ? 
 Yes . What do you want to buy ? 
 What size do you wear ? 
 Excuse me , do you have any English songs ? 
 Great , thanks . 
 Oh , I see . 
 It's not really all that good.The bedroom is a little small for us . 
 But there's no hot water after 10 at night.Sometimes I like to have a hot shower before bed , especially in the winter , it feels good . 
 True , and I like the kitchen.It ' s new and well equipped . 
 You are right.The view is spectacular.But that bedroom is so small.We ' d never be able to fit all of our stuff in there . 
 I haven't thought of that . 
 For sure ! I didn ’ t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the US . 
 Well , they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401K ? 
 That ’ s interesting and logical I guess . In my country , we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund , but most people don ’ t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that . 
 Yeah , but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions , so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank . 
 I don't think we come here at a right time . 
 The museum doesn't open today . 
 Where shall we go now ? 
 Wait a moment , I would like to take some snapshots here . 
 It's so beautiful here . I want to stay longer . 
 That's all right . 
 I know how to use the telex machine , the photocopier , and the word processor . By the way , I took a computer course in university . 
 I want to be a manager . 
 Nothing . I think I'll take the job . 
 I know it is not the cheapest on the market . But if you take the quality factor into consideration , you will find your company will benefit in the long term . This device is built in with the most advanced technology . Every aspect has reached the international standard . It is a worthwhile investment . 
 Well , the best I can do is to lower the price by 5 percent if you are willing to pay 90 % cash of front and 10 % on delivery . That is our best offer . 
 Sure , no problem . 
 I'm not sure I'm following you , sir . 
 Oh , now I understand ! So , you've already used up all your amenities ? 
 I'm losing you , sir . What's the problem ? 
 Okay , I got it . You're collecting souvenirs ! 
 Have you visited our souvenir shop , sir ? It's loaded with all kinds of items . 
 Sir , housekeeping will bring you a basketful of amenities momentarily . 
 Mr.Black , if I'm not mistaken . 
 Pleased to see you.too . 
 What a good idea ! 
 We could go to more places this time , if you liked . 
 When shall we go and look ? 
 No , let's go on Saturday . 
 Where shall we go ? 
 No , I don't like that place.Why don't we try the garage Martin recommended ? 
 Are you ready to order , sir ? 
 We have steamed chicken , braised pork and Beijing roast duck and so on . Here's the menu . What would you like to have ? 
 Would you like anything to drink ? 
 All right . Wait for a moment , please . 
 Yes . I'd like to make a collect call to Japan . 
 It's Helen Kent . 
 I'd like to talk to Mr . Edna Kent . 
 That's right . 
 From code 513 , 432-6748 . 
 Country code is 81 , area code 138 , and the number is 846-8972 . 
 How long would you stay , sir ? 
 Would you please fill in this registration form ? 
 Okay , I ’ ll take it . By the way , do you have delivery service ? 
 Do you charge for delivery ? 
 Very good . Could you deliver it to this address ? 
 OK . Can you tell me the delivery time ? 
 Thanks . 
 Yes , speaking . What can I do for you ? 
 I am applying for the waiter in your pub . 
 Sure . I will try my best to slow down . 
 You can print out a copy of the Order Supply Form from our company web site and turn in into me . What will you be needing ? 
 Will you need all of them right away or can some wait ? 
 You can only buy supplies that you have a budget for . Do you know what your budget is ? 
 You can pick these supplies up or they can be delivered to your building . Which would you prefer ? 
 Well , just finish the request and we will contact you when the supplies come in . Have a good day ! 
 Will I get notification that I qualify for unemployment ? 
 What is contained in that letter ? 
 Will the Award Letter tell me what I need to fill out next ? 
 When I fill out the Continued Claim Form , what will I need to tell them ? 
 What other information does the form ask for ? 
 Do you know Yahoo Greetings , Edgar ? 
 Can you tell me how to send one on it ? 
 ID ? What's that ? 
 Oh . I see . But I have done it . 
 Is that all ? 
 Oh . I see . Thanks . 
 I'm looking for a Sharp DVD Player .

 Good evening , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 Yes , of course . This way , please . 
 Okay . 
 Wow ! It ’ s really good for me , especially the living room . It is big enough to put all my stuff there . It ’ s a deal ! I ’ ll rent this one . 
 Sure ! 
 Okay . Thank you for your reminder . 
 Thank you again . 
 Who is the author ? 
 Sorry , we ' re sold out right now.Please come back next week . 
 Can you go to the store for me ? 
 Just a couple things , here's a list . 
 No , I think that's all that I need . 
 If you can , could you pick up my prescription for me ? 
 I think so . It should be . 
 Thank you so much . 
 So are you going to get a new swimsuit ? 
 Why don't you get a bikini ? 
 You aren't fat . I'll bet you'd look great in a bikini . How about this thong bikini ? 
 I guess that one-piece isn't too bad , either . ( to be continued ) 
 Oh , tell him I ’ ll leave them at his office tomorrow afternoon . 
 I ’ m afraid that I can ’ t do that . They ’ re at the printer ’ s being copied . They ’ ll be back tomorrow before 1 o ’ clock . 
 This is Kevin . 
 Yes . 
 wow ! That ’ s great . Sure , I can . Where is the Human Resources Office ? 
 Thank you very much . I ’ ll be there on time . 
 What do you expect to be doing five years from now ? What are your medium-term career goals ? 
 This is a precious opportunity for us and our company . 
 What are you eating ? 
 Why ? 
 I'd like to start by talking about prices . 
 Your products are very good , but the price you ask is much too high . 
 I know , but we want 1000 pieces . This is a very large order . So , can you give us a 25 percent discount ? 
 Really ? It almost looks brand new . And the color designs are so retro . 
 No way ! My parents used to hang out at those places . 
 How did you get it ? 
 Certainly , Sir . You do have a Current Account with us right ? 
 Yes , Sir . In order to get a credit card with us , you'll need to open a Current Account here . Could you please fill out this form with your relevant details ? 
 Yes , a passport will be fine . 
 That's fine , Sir . We'll see you again a little later . 
 I had a really busy day . I had to work a little overtime . In the morning an important client called to place a large order . I had to check some things with my colleagues before confirming the order . 
 The most important thing was to check that we had the goods in stock . If the goods are in stock , we can deliver them immediately . I also had to check the price . This customer is very important , so they get special prices . 
 I received a lot of emails from potential clients that I had to answer . Each time , I had to check files to see what we had agreed at earlier meetings . Each client has different conditions and requirements . 
 Yes . That ’ s why we have everything on computer files . We don ’ t use much paper at our office . After lunch , I had to deal with a complaint from a client . 
 Yes , it was . I managed to sort out the problem , but I was tied up with the matter for over an hour . 
 That ’ s not all ! I also had to finish writing a sales report for my boss . In the end , I finished everything . I wonder what will be waiting for me tomorrow morning . 
 Yes , I'd like to have a look at the 2 - piece suit . 
 Middle size 
 Does this suit come in other color ? 
 How much is the brown one ? 
 Then I'll take it . 
 May I take your order ? 
 OK , here you are . 
 I have no idea . First time here . 
 Oh , it's rice rolls with fried shrimp inside . 
 There are twenty rolls in a bowl . You can get another bowl for free if there aren't enough rolls . 
 OK , shrimp rolls . Do you want anything else ? 
 OK , wait a moment please . 
 I totally agree . I really like my lifestyle to be drama-free , and I don't want to argue about cleaning the apartment . My last roommate was a drama queen . Every time I forgot to take my shoes off , she got really mad and made a big deal out of it . 
 That's right . We should try to be laid back and not do lots of things to bother one another . 
 I have been a salesman . 
 Would you make me a dust coat out of this serge ? 
 What's the charge ? 
 OK.thank you . 
 Yes , it is . 
 Ok , thank you . By the way , could you please tell me how I can get there from A community ? 
 I got it . Thank you so much . 
 Excuse me , sir.You are not supposed to smoke here . 
 Your seat is in the non-smoking section.So , please refrain from smoking . 
 Then , I'll try to find a seat in the smoking section.One moment , please . Thank you for waiting . I found a seat in the smoking section for you . 
 Hi , sorry to have kept you waiting . 
 How are you ? 
 Hello , Sir , may I help you ? 
 Very well , here are the general terms of our loan policies . We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans . 
 It depends on how long you take to pay it back . If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . This of course is considering that you don ’ t default on a payment ! 
 That is a very serious problem you see , the bank must assess your personal information , past loans , assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan . 
 You have got a problem , haven't you ? 
 Eat less and exercise more . Do not eat too much sweet food . 
 We'd like to buy some furniture for our new house . 
 We like a larger wardrobe . 
 It looks great . 
 Will this be cash or charge ? 
 Just sign here , please . 
 Here's your receipt . Have a nice day . 
 The best we can do is $ 120 per case . 
 I think you are well informed about the prevailing market.Some Spanish firms are offering the same at much lower prices . 
 It's true yours are of better quality . But your price is still on the high side even if we take quality into consideration . How about meeting each other half way ? 
 Take your time , please . 
 I've had enough . 
 Of course not . Just tell me how to operate it . 
 I know . Hold your position and say cheese . 
 What's that ? 
 Oh . 
 Grandpa , this restaurant looks really old ! How long ago was it built ? 
 Oh , it's interesting . Dad told me you brought him here when he was young , too . Now , it's my turn . 
 I'd like to eat a hamburger and a bottle of coca-cola . 
 Then there is nothing particular I'd like to eat . Grandpa , what's your favorite here ? 
 Sure . Is it sweet ? 
 Great , I want it spicy . 
 I want it to be special . And you know that I always like hot food . 
 Is the girl in red your girlfriend ? 
 Who's she then ? 
 I'm looking for the produce section , please . 
 Are bananas on sale today ? 
 Here ' s my passport . I'm a visiting scholar . 
 No , these are all my personal effects . 
 Not at all . I don't know what's dutiable.Do I have to pay duty on things for my own use ? 
 Thank you . 
 No.Why ? 
 No way ! 
 May I speak to Mrs . Liu , please ? 
 Oh , good morning , Mrs . Liu . I'm calling to see if you have received my resume that I sent to you by Email . 
 My name is Steven . May I ask whether I can have an interview ? 
 When is it most convenient for me to visit you to talk about the position ? 
 Thank you very much . See you then . 
 Hello , I want to remit one thousand Yuan to Magnolia Company . 
 OK ... Do I put on Magnolia Company for the receiver ? 
 OK , I see . Here you are . Is that OK now ? 
 Here you are . What is the rate ? 
 OK , when will this remittance arrive ? 
 That's good . Is there anything else ? 
 Thanks , I will . 
 no , I haven ’ t . I can ’ t think of anything to get him . 
 I know . He bought me that beautiful sweater for my birthday . It was exactly what I wanted . And it fit me perfectly ! 
 that doesn ’ t sound like a great present . 
 let ’ s think . He loves football , doesn ’ t he ? I saw signed photographs of famous footballers in a shop near hear . Let ’ s go and have a look . You know which team he supports , don ’ t you ? 
 it ’ ll be an expensive present , but we can share the cost . 
 yes . He always get us special gift . We should repay his kindness . 
 What kind would you like ? 
 That's going to be about $ 2.48 . 
 What else can I get for you ? 
 That's going to be $ 4.05 a pound . 
 That will be $ 12.15 . 
 That's fine . Let me get your meat . 
 I'm not surprised . You eat too much . 
 Yes , I think so . 
 Well , why don't you go on a diet ? 
 Perhaps you should exercise more . Why don't you go to an exercise class ? 
 What is your policy on returns ? 
 Sounds good . 
 Charge . Here's my card . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , What can I do for you , sir ? 
 I can try to arrange that for you . 
 Can you describe for me , where you were sitting ? 
 You're in luck . We still have that little table . 
 What's the running speed of the machine ? 
 And what's the maximum output ? 
 This is 911 . 
 Slow down and tell me your address . 
 An ambulance is on its way right now . They should be there any minute . Are you close to him right now ? 
 Is he breathing ? 
 what kind of qualities do you look for in your friends ? 
 I don ’ t like to make friends with people who aren ’ t honest . Honesty is very important to me . 
 you can find out from their friends . 
 oh , I don ’ t . they don ’ t seem to take anything seriously . You never know when they are joking and when they are being serious . 
 it seems that we generally like different kinds of people . How is it that we are such good friends ? 
 Excuse me , what do you want for this bag ? 
 Would you take $ 12 ? 
 13.50 ? 
 I need to get some business cards printed up . 
 I think I can get by with 2,000 . 
 I hope you can make the new cards just like my old cards . 
 ... Okay , I'm through . Here's the form and my old card . 
 Now that I think of it , three days is better than seven . 
 I'm so hungry ! I haven't late eaten all day ! 
 They're all so thin ! Her cheekbones are great . 
 The mag says she's 165 centimeters tall and 38 kilos . If only we could be that thin then ... 
 Oh , bathroom blues . 
 I went to try it on yesterday , but it only came in extra small . 
 ( Weigh herself ) Hey , I lost a kilo in a week with my all-fruit diet . If I keep going , I can wear that dress next month . 
 Dieting . It's the price we pay to make men notice us . 
 They're also way younger than us . 
 You never worked out ? 
 Excuse me . Could you give me some directions ? 
 A gas station . My car ran out of gas two blocks back . 
 Do you know the name of the street ? 
 By the way , do you know the price of the gas now ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 How about a laptop ? 
 How about a Mac ?

 All she has to do is open the box and follow the instructions . 
 Thank you . If you have any problems , just call . 
 I want to get a package of cigarette . 
 No , this kind of cigarette is too strong for me , I desire a mild one . 
 It suits my taste , I'll take it . Do you have lighters ? 
 Show me the one made of plastic . 
 Thank you . 
 That's great ! You need to prepare for it . 
 Get your hair done at a good hair saloon . Tell them you are going for a job interview . 
 Buy an expensive suit . 
 The more expensive , the better . 
 That'll do it . The best way is to find the dressing color code of the company . 
 If you know somebody at the company , ask them . If not , dark color will be fine . 
 Yeah , fine . And dressing shoes . 
 Black is good . 
 No . Dark or skin colored . 
 Necklace , ring , and earrings are all fine . But don ’ t wear too many pieces of jewelry . 
 Not much make up . 
 Yes , some . But be aware that different people may like different scents . 
 Thank you , I just tried my best . I am very happy to know you like it . 
 Well , yes . Several colleagues from different departments helped me with that . They are very supportive . I consulted an economic expert last week . He was very kind to give valuable suggestions . 
 Come on , don ’ t flatter me anymore . I took the job because I love being challenged . But I can ’ t get this turned around without the support from you people . 
 Yes , it's still available . 
 Well , it has got low mileage.The tires are in perfect condition and it's in excellent shape . 
 Please fill out the form first .

 Well , I'm not sure . Let's see . How much is this one ? 
 Oh . I don't think I can afford that . How about this one ? 
 Wow . That's too much for me . Don't you have anything cheaper ? 
 I had a wonderful time . The rooms are not very big , but they are well furnished . The restaurant is excellent and reasonably priced . There ’ s a sauna and a Jacuzzi . 
 No , they don ’ t . they have a beauty parlor , but I didn ’ t go there . 
 It ’ s very good . Check in and check out at the reception only took a few minutes . The wait staff is very good . A waiter recommended their baked fish , which tasted wonderful . The hotel was quite full , so I ’ d suggest making a reservation if you intend to go there . The hotel offers a discount at the weekends . 
 There was a problem with the internet access , so I couldn ’ t check my email , but I didn ’ t complain about it to the management . 
 Yes , I was . Here ’ s their business card . 
 No , there wasn ’ t . There is a bar on the ground floor and of course you can buy drinks in the restaurant to go with your meal . 
 I know . At the inland hotel , they have an interesting policy . When you check out , you put some money in a special box at reception . Each evening , the money in the box is shared equally by the hotel staff . 
 What's it like ? 
 Who are the bad guys ? 
 Wow ! Where's the treasure ? 
 How do you find it ? 
 Great ! 
 Yes . I'm going to stay with the same , a beer . 
 Oh , darn . Look what I've done . ( Spill the drink ) 
 Have you ever gotten a parking ticket ? 
 How many is a few ? 
 Have you paid all your tickets off ? 
 How much is the fine ? 
 That's not cheap at all . 
 Pay it off , and they'll clear your record . 
 Do you like shopping at flea markets ? 
 The antiques market here in Paris is very famous . It's called Le marche aux puces de Saint-Ouen . 
 It's also known as Les Puces , which means ‘ The Fleas ' . 
 Well , it really depends . Because you are a tourist , it might be harder for you to get really good prices . 
 No , thanks , I'll pass . It looks very tempting though . 
 It is . I'm on a diet and strawberry cream cheese cake is not on it . 
 I went to the doctor the other day . My cholesterol is up . 
 Not too serious . But he gave me a strict diet to help bring it down . 
 Thank you . I'll go through it and tell you . 
 I will . Thank you for all . 
 OK.What do you want to know ? 
 OK . 
 Here you are . 
 Two years . 
 I'm a professor at a university . 
 I teach at Beijing Normal University , English composition and some conversational classes . 
 Good afternoon . What can I do for you today , Madam ? 
 OK , Madam . We are here to help . 
 I understand completely . There are other options , such as a Personal Pledge Loan . 
 The procedure is really simple and convenient . All you need to do is fill in this Loan Application form . 
 Of course , we'll need some documentation from you . Like your resident permit , proof of salary and your USD Deposit Certificate , to use as collateral . 
 Have you got any specific proposal about the terms of payment ? 
 I'm sorry to say the only term of payment we can accept is 100 % irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents . 
 I'm afraid not . We insist on a letter of credit , because as seller , we also have the problem of funds being tied up . 
 Consult your bank and see if they will reduce the required deposit to a minimum . 
 I am quite active and energetic . I approach things enthusiastically and I don't like leaving things half done . 
 I am quite outgoing , I think . I enjoy mixing and doing things with others . 
 I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . A person can't live alt by himself , I think . A friend in need is a friend indeed . So the more really close friends I have , the better . 
 People who are honest , dedicate to their work and have integrity . 
 Slacker and those who violate working procedures and ignoring deadlines . 
 Ah yes , I'd like to book two rooms for myself and my father . Could you tell me the cost of a single room per night ? 
 Fine . 
 From the 25th to the 28tri of September . 
 That's right . 
 Yes , we have rooms available then . You require two single rooms ? 
 Can l have your name please ? 
 And your father's name , Ms White ? 
 Could you spell the surname please ? 
 Double P for Papa ? 
 Could you please cover for me two hours this morning ? 
 I have to see the dentist . We have an appointment for this morning from 9 to 11 o ’ clock . So if there is any phone call , please pick up for me . If there is something urgent , tell them I will be back in two hours . 
 Yes , I will need it . Thanks . 
 I ’ m having a problem . 
 I apparently owe some fees , but I never got the bank statement . 
 My fees went up , but I didn ’ t even know I had fees to pay . 
 What are you going to do about it ? 
 I don ’ t have to pay any fees ? 
 That ’ s fine . I appreciate your help . 
 That's terrible . 
 No , you do not have to . The handbag can be taken with you . There is the cart at the entrance . 
 Well , how old is your baby ? 
 The milk powder on the second level of the shelf is for the kids from 2 ages to 4 ages . I advice that you should buy the Wyeth brand , the source of milk is imported from New Zealand . 
 You can be assured of it . There are various nutritions which are beneficial for the growth of babies ' bone and cerebrum . 
 It is feeding-bottle as the free gift . 
 You know that this job requires frequent business travel . Can you accept it ? 
 Mostly short business trips , but sometimes long ones are also needed . 
 The company will pay all the expenses . 
 Usually Shanghai , Qingdao , Hong Kong and so on . 
 And you need to go abroad once in a while . Can you ? 
 After the business trip , you could apply for reimbursement of all the expenses , such as passage money and accommodation charges and so on . 
 You can take a break for one or two weeks after you have a business trip every time , which depends on the circumstances . 
 We have a holiday next week , don't we ? 
 What're you going to do ? 
 At cars ! You aren't thinking about buying a car , are you ? 
 But it will be expensive to have a car in the city , won't it ? 
 But what about parking ? You can't park on the street , can you ? 
 Farmington ? Would you take a look at these catalogue ads that Roger did ? I don ’ t think we can use them . 
 I know , Mr . Farmington . But , I ’ m not sure that I should bring this up with him . I think it would be better if you spoke to him . 
 Is there anything I can dor you ? 
 Why not go the youth restaurant ? You will have a happy lunch there . 
 I need to get internet . 
 What kind can I get ? 
 Which one do you feel is best ? 
 DEL is better than dial-up ? 
 I'm not sure what that means . 
 That'll make it impossible for me to use . 
 How many people are traveling with you today , miss ? 
 And how many bags do you have ? 
 You must be going to some island to relax in the sun where all you need is a swim suit and a toothbrush . 
 Well , you have fun . 
 Thank God , it's Friday ! Time for a drink ! Let's hit the bars ! 
 Should we start with beer or wine or go straight to the hard liquor ? 
 Port's too sweet . It's a dessert wine . A dry red French wine would be nice with meat . A glass of chilled white German wine would be good with fish . But , we're not eating and it's hot out , so I think I'll have a tall glass of sangria with ice . 
 I like to stick to the clean stuff , like vodka , gin , white rum and other clear spirits . 
 I don't know . 
 What is the great trait in your personality ? 
 So you may like inventive jobs . 
 What would you be doing in U . S . A ? 
 What do you want to see particularly ? 
 I'd like to have these shirts washed and ironed . 
 Yes , heavy starch in the collar , please . 
 I also have a suit to be dry-cleaned . Can I fetch it the day after tomorrow ? It's urgent . 
 Could you please tell me when your laundry opens and closes ? 
 I see . 
 Thank you . I'd like to get my laundry . 
 Here you are . 
 Can you sew on these buttons ? 
 How much for the shirts ? 
 Here is the money , keep the change . 
 Who's the champion in this picture ? 
 He's very handsome , I think . 
 yes , come on in . how's your new job going ? 
 that's great . I knew you'd do a good job as a manager . 
 how's your assistant manager getting on ? 
 what seems to be the problem ? 
 if you gave him another 30 days , do you think he could figure it out by then ? 
 I see . Not everyone is cut out to work in management . 
 there's an opening in the creative design department . It involves working with computers . 
 Waiter , bring me the menu , will you ? 
 I'd like to see the menu.Would you get me one , please ? 
 Thank you.Ah ! But this is in French.Would you mind giving me the English menu ? 
 Thanks . I'll need a while to choose.Could you come back in a minute ? 
 I'm sorry , I haven't decided yet.Do you mind giving me a couple of minutes ? 
 Lucy , where are you going ? 
 Wait a few minutes and I'll go there with you . 
 Good idea 
 Let's check out the fruit section first . 
 Look , nice fresh cherries ! They are ripe and soft . I'll take some . 
 Let's go to the snacks section . I want some chocolate and sweets . 
 Do you want to buy something else ? 
 Please take a seat . 
 Now what can I do for you ? 
 Fine , but first I need some information about you . 
 Well , first of all , your name.What ' s your surname ? 
 And your other names ? 
 Have you got your e-mail address ? 
 How old are you ? 
 Where were you Bron ? 
 Room service.What can I do for you ? 
 Here is a shop in the hotel . It's on the 11th floor . 
 Certainly . 
 Un .. Those are 25 dollars each . 
 Well , I could offer you maybe 10 percent off . 
 This one I'd better chat with the manager . Could you give me a second ? 
 Hi . I want to check out . My room is 1005 . 
 Yes . Can I have a look at my bill ? 
 OK . I would like to have my receipt report , please . 
 Your resume mentioned that you had been the surveyor , which was a concurrent job , of a certain market survey company . What was your main work content ? 
 What had you gained mainly from this survey activity ? 
 Well , we've settled everything in connection with this transaction except the question of the mode of payment . 
 Payment by sight L / C is quite usual in international trade , and as a rule , we only accept payment by sight L / C . 
 Accepting time L / C is unusual and I've never done it before , but we could consider your request . I'll phone our company to see what they say . 
 This afternoon . 
 Yes , I'd like to buy these razors . 
 Excuse me , are you Sara Wilson ? 
 Nice to meet you too . Let me help you with your bags . 
 Wow , you're not kidding . Hold on a second . Hello , could you give us a hand , please ?

 Hello , may I speak with the property manager , please ? 
 During that horrible rainstorm last night , my roof began to leak . 
 It was in our bedroom . 
 We are on the top floor . 
 Yes , we will be in . 
 Your total comes to $ 36.78 . 
 There ’ s a problem with your card .

 Yes , occasionally . 
 I think so . 
 Is it serious ? 
 I need to pay the fine on my ticket . 
 Yes , I have my ticket with me . 
 I forgot to bring that with me . 
 Why can't I just give you the money for the fine ? 
 Okay , I think I understand . 
 So once I pay this off , my record will be cleared ? 
 Switchboard . Which extension would you like ?

 Certainty , sir .

 Oh , are the connections correct ? 
 Let me see . Look ! You confused the video frequency with the audio frequency . 
 Can it work now ? 
 So what's the problem ? Maybe there is something wrong with the disk . 
 Give it to me . 
 Uh , the movie of Tom Hanks . I know why it can't play . This is a DVD disk . 
 I bought some special local products . 
 Yes . I really wanted to do so . I love those handicrafts , especially the paper-cut . 
 Aren't animals the main content of Chinese paper-cuts ? 
 Then I will buy some tomorrow . 
 Because I want to send them to my friends . 
 Hello , Sir . We haven't seen you for quite a while . So , what is it today that we can do for you ? 
 I see , yes , I can do that now . I'm sure you know , as I may have told you before , you should pay an extra 20 RIB handling fee for this service . 
 I can just take it from your account , you don't need to give me cash . 
 Anything else you'll be needing today , Sir ? 
 Have you finished washing clothes ? 
 Well , when you do your darks , can you wash some of mine too ? 
 They need to be washed on the gentle cycle . 
 There aren't many clothes , is your load big ? 
 If it's a problem , you don't have to do it for me . 
 I greatly appreciate this .

 Hi . Can I help you ? 
 Okay . Please let me know if you need any help . 
 Let's catch the waiter's eyes . We want to have a table for 4 . 
 Well , it's too close to the door . Is that table reserved ? 
 Our current apartment is valued at RIB 700,000 . We can sell it and put that money towards buying the new apartment . 
 And we can take out a loan to pay the rest . 
 Uh huh ... but we're going to have to cut back on our shopping from now on . 
 Yes , we're interested in seeing the rooms for rent . 
 That is exactly what we're looking for . 
 That sounds all right to us . 
 How about tomorrow afternoon ? 
 See you tomorrow . 
 Yes , sir , let me show you the table . This way please . 
 Of course . 
 I work for a large multinational company called DAK Group . We have five main area of business - construction , heavy industry , shipbuilding , motor vehicles and telecommunications .

 The fare is different from the meter . 
 But I thought it was . Anyway . I am in a hurry . Here is the money . 
 Yes . I've got a small room . 
 200 yuan a week , but smoking is not allowed . 
 Would you mind waiting ? I'm on the telephone . 
 Hello , Ms Li , this is Mr Peng . 
 We'll be coming in tomorrow to make a rather large cash withdrawal , it's for payroll . 
 500,000 RIB . Do you need me to give you my account number ? 
 Thanks very much for your help , Li Lan . See you tomorrow . 
 Yes , go straight along Beijing Road and turn right . 
 No , it's just a couple of minutes . 
 You're welcome . 
 Excellent . How many would you like ? 
 You need to fill out this form , please . 
 That will be no problem , sir . 
 Very good , sir . Your order will be ready in one week . 
 No problem , sir . But it will cost you extra . 
 Yes.Do you sell stockings ? 
 Sure . Are those pantyhose made of artificial silk ? 
 It's rather an unusual case . Have you found the cause of leaking ? 
 It appears to be the only case to us , that the goods have been damaged on the way . 
 Could you offer us a certificate issued by your Health Department ? 
 Now we are prepared to settle the issue with you amicably . 
 This is he . 
 All right . 
 Thank you for hiring me . I'm very proud to be employed by your firm . 
 Yes , I will . I hope I'll enjoy working with you . 
 Take the No . 7 bus . There's a bus stop just over there . 
 Yes . No need to change . 
 Get on , PLS . Where do you wanna go ? 
 All right , Miss . I think we will get there if there are no delays on the way . 
 According to the kilometer rate , the first five kilometers are 4 dollars and every kilometer extra costs 50 cents . 
 Here we are , Miss . 
 You owe me 19 dollars . 
 Thank you ! 
 I am attending Hebes University of Technology . 
 This coming July . 
 I will receive a Bachelor's degree . 
 My major is Business Administration . 
 I have been doing quite well at college . According to the academic records I've achieved so far , I am confident that I will get my Bachelor of Business Administration this coming July . 
 I have already learned a lot in the classroom and I hope to be able to make practical use of it in your company . My specialization at the university is just in line with the areas your institute deals with . I am sure I can apply what I have learned to the work in your institute . 
 Yes , it's not very far from here . Follow this road until you get to the traffic lights . You will see a small restaurant at the corner . 
 It is on the right . But it is on the other side of the lights . 
 You go straight on at the lights , but just past the restaurant building there is a small road to your right . 
 Yes , you need to turn right and follow that road for about four minutes . You will see the Post Office on your left . 
 Yes and it is quite a big building so you won't miss it . There is also a small supermarket next to it . 
 You're welcome . 
 Yes . I'd like to buy a sweater for my husband . Which style is the latest ? 
 I like this style . But do you have any other colors ? I feel that this color doesn't suit his complexion . 
 Great ! I will take it . And could you suggest a pair of trousers to match this sweater ? 
 Let me see . Yes , they are perfectly matched ! 
 Thanks . Dad , but I can manage it myself . 
 Yes , I know . The problem is that I can't find it . Where did you put it ? 
 Oh , yes , here it is . 
 What's up ? 
 No . Dad . We have a tour guide . 
 No , I won't get sick . I promise . Ok . I've finished . Bye , Dad . See you ! 
 Dad , that's all right . I don't think it will rain . And it doesn't make any sense to take that many things on a trip . Besides I like to travel light . Bye ! 
 Walk down this road , take the fourth turn to the right.Then you'll see it . 
 No . It's only about five minutes ' walk . 
 Not at all . 
 No , thanks . My husband said , We'd like to pay now . 
 What ? Where does that five come from ? 
 But I only have 900 in cash here . Can you let it go for 900 yuan ? 
 My husband said he had a credit card . Do you accept credit card ? 
 Great . Here it is . 
 Yes , please . Thank you very much . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Yes . We have all kinds of colors for it . 
 What's your favorite color ? 
 Sometimes pink is not bad , too . 
 Thank you . Anything else ? 
 What was that ? 
 How did it happen ? 
 It was my favorite . 
 Maybe I shouldn't have put it here . Someone was bound to bump it eventually . 
 If one is rich , is the happy ? 
 Could I understand what you said as the poorest is the happiest ? 
 Good morning . Can I help you ? 
 Just a moment , please . I am sorry , sir . There is no ticket available on that day . But we have flights for Hong Kong the next day . 
 A 9:12 flight in the morning and a 14:00 flight in the afternoon . 
 At 10:20 
 All right , sir . Please reconfirm your ticket no later than 12 noon two days before the flight ; otherwise , your reservation will automatically be canceled . 
 It's 500 dollars , not including ground transportation fares between the airport and downtown . 
 Right , sir . And please do not forget to bring a valid travel document with you when you buy the tickets . 
 What kinds of meat are most popular in your country ? 
 Yes , we do . We also eat mutton . 
 That's right . Mutton chops taste so good . We eat them with sauce . Have you ever tried ? 
 Certainly I can . I'll buy some from the butcher's and cook for you next Sunday . 
 Excuse me . Is anyone sitting here ? 
 You don ’ t mind if I smoke , do you ? 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry . But this isn ’ t a no-smoker , isn ’ t it ? I mean would you mind if I smoke here ? 
 Sign ? What ’ s sign ? 
 Oh , sorry . I didn ’ t notice it . Sorry . 
 Hi . I need a wake-up call tomorrow . 
 I need two calls , one at 7 and another at 7 fifteen .

 You're welcome . 
 Yes , I didn't know Washington , DC got so cold in winter . 
 I really think we should take a tour of the White House . 
 Of course . But today I feel like seeing the White House.We should see it first , because it's the most famous historical building here . 
 Boring ? How can it be boring ? It sounds very interesting to me . 
 Yes , ma'ma . There'll be no problem with the quality . 
 You don't have to worry about it . We have a one year warranty . 
 Sure . We have a good after-sale service . Your satisfaction is guaranteed .

 Do you have it in a larger size ? 
 Hello , Mr.Green . This is Lin Tong . How are you ? 
 Oh , sorry to interrupt you . But I am calling to say goodbye to you . I am awfully sorry to tell you that I am afraid I could not see you off at the airport tomorrow , because I will have to attend a very important meeting . 
 Thanks a lot . You have been here for almost three weeks . How time flies ! 
 It is our pleasure . It has been a great pleasure to work with you . 
 Really ? Great ! We will . Well , what's your flight number ? When are you leaving tomorrow ? 
 OK , I will send someone to see you off . 
 My pleasure . Take care and have a nice trip . 
 Let's call it a deal . Hope to see you again soon . Keep in touch then . Byebye . 
 Francis , what ’ s that ? 
 Could you tell me something about it ? 
 How many departments do we have ? 
 Ok . Who should I report to ? 
 Are you being served , madam ? 
 Yes , what size is in your mind ? 
 Any particular brand ? 
 How about this one ? It ’ s the latest design , simple but elegant . 
 $ 100 . 
 How much would you say ? 
 Have you any evening bus tour ? 
 I have heard of that before . When shall we start ? 
 I booked a double room for tonight . My name is Ruth Joy . 
 Plastic bags are widely used nowadays . 
 In this aspect , I think , Pater bags have the edge on plastic bags . 
 Come in please . 
 Yes . Put them on there please . 
 Thank you . By the way , what shall we do with the plates when we finish our meal ? 
 I see . Thanks a lot . 
 Yes , I have . 
 No problem . I can do that for you . 
 I know . What time do they go ? 
 Okay , I won't forget . 
 What are you getting donations for ? 
 How much money are you looking to make ? 
 Are you doing different fundraisers ? 
 You should do something else . 
 Try a car wash and selling candy . 
 You ’ ll make more money that way . 
 Well , Mr.Li has very good taste in wine , and Galp is one of the biggest clients . I suggest you take them to a decent French restaurant . Make sure you make a very good impression . 
 Or Lapis . They are both listed this year glory magazine for have most of frantic Fetch cuisine in town . But I heard Lapis has a better wine selection . 
 Sure . 
 I'm in favor of Maggie . 
 That's right , Nigel . I think we can keep cost down . 
 Good afternoon . May I help you ? 
 Certainly , may I take your name ? I ’ ll let her know you ’ Ve arrived . 
 Ms . Stevens will be with you momentarily . Can I offer you something to drink ? 
 Here you are . Ms . Stevens is ready for you now . I ’ ll show you to her office , right this way . 
 Yes . Is this Paula ? 
 No , that ’ s all right . Paula . Why don ’ t you get something to eat , and I ’ ll see you this afternoon . 
 Yes , we've got a very tender new shipment from the mainland . It is a weekend special . 
 One pound and fifty pence a pound . 
 Here it is . Four pounds and fifty pence in all . 
 Yeah , I cherish it . Because I have been working like a dog for two months to buy it . 
 Yes , I'll have tomato soup and my friend will have mushroom soup . 
 Yes , bring us two steaks and two loads of bread , please . 
 Certainly ! How much are you planning to spend on dinner , sir ? 
 May I suggest our own hotel restaurant ? It got three stars in the latest restaurant review . 
 There's always Gramercy Tavern . They have live jazz . The food is delicious , but very expensive . 
 As you wish , sir . You'll have a wonderful time there . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Alright . I'll send someone over tomorrow . 
 Fine , I'll be up in a few minutes . 
 Can I make preservation now ? 
 9:45 , please . We want a table next to the window . 
 In that case , please help us reserve a table for 4 at 9:00 . 
 Normally , about 60 people . But it may depend . 
 About 20 % of them come from other countries and the others are employed from domestic universities and colleges . 
 Yes , I'd like to have a roast chicken leg . 
 No . 
 No , enough . 
 Waiter , come back . 
 It's not too salty . 
 Waiter , come back again . 
 Not too rare . 
 Why do you come back again ? 
 What's that ? 
 Thanks , thanks a lot and thanks a million . 
 I can't forget about this when next time . 
 Overtime work is very common in companies . I can work overtime if it's necessary , but I don ’ t think we will work overtime everyday . 
 No , I don ’ t like regular work . I am interested in different projects with new opportunities and new challenges , but I can do regular work if the company needs me to do so . 
 My familiarity to computer is great , and I use computer frequently in my daily life and work . 
 I am competent in using Word , Excel , Windows and other commonly used softwares . 
 Your major must be computer . 
 Yes , I ’ m quite satisfied with your qualifications . 
 Generally speaking , training new members is usually necessary . We offer our new employees a one-week training course . 
 Yes , of course . You will be responsible for the designing and developing new products and also be in charge of the evaluation of the software programs including complex software systems to ensure product features and operation complaints . 
 Good evening , sir , and welcome to Chez Attitude . 
 Yes , Mr . Foster , if you would please be seated over in the waiting area , our hostess will be with you in a moment . 
 Of course , I will tell her . 
 Sure , if you would like one of those tables , I could seat you right away . 
 Here are your menus and the wine menu , and would you like to order your drinks now ? 
 Sure , no problem , sir . 
 Mr . Smith , I would like to get right to the point here . First , we need to talk about how much each company will pay . 
 Let's look at that another way . The major point is the value that we add , not who has been in business longer , or is bigger . 
 We do not want to place ourselves in an inferior position . We are a good , small company---that's why you are interested . 
 If you take a 75 % position in the venture , we would take a back seat to you . 
 Yes . What about you ? 
 Really ? 
 Voting is simple . 
 That ’ s okay . They describe everything on the ballot . 
 Don ’ t worry . You ’ ll be fine . 
 Congratulations on your first voting day . 
 May I have some water , please ? 
 With my dinner , please . And can you take my order for dessert later ? 
 You are in the pink recently . How do you make it ? 
 Are you tired after class ? 
 Excuse me , can you recommend some places for us to go tonight ? 
 Good idea . My wife has a fine ear for music . I am sure she would like it . 
 May I please speak to Tom ? 
 I'll just try him again . 
 No , but what time do you expect him back ? 
 What in the world is that smell ? 
 Smells like you're baking something . What are those ? 
 Cool ! But isn't that a hot air popcorn popper ? 
 The beans will burn . I know . I've tasted burnt coffee before ... yuck ! 
 He is in his office , but you'd better choose your words carefully while talking to him . 
 Nothing . But he is in a bad mood today . 
 That's all right . 
 I can't agree more , honey . We need to get away from work from time to time . 
 We are nor alone here . So many other families ! 
 Well , let's go over there and put a blanket on the lawn . 
 Oh , so heavy ! What have you put in here ? 
 Toys ? Why do we need toys for a picnic ? 
 Sure , then . May it really be a day of enjoyment . Other than that , we can also teach him something about science . 
 I mean we can inspire him for a deeper understanding of the natural world . 
 Well , OK . you are always right . 
 Thanks , I like it too . I bought it at the nearby department store . 
 Yeah , I know that . But at those places . the prices they ask you are ridiculously high , and if you don't bargain hard , you will get ripped-off . 
 Yeah , but personally I hate bargaining . If I bargain , I might come to a lower price . But I will never know the true price of what I am buying , and I'll always have the feeling that I am over charged at those places . 
 That's why I like department stores more . Shopping at a wholesale market like the locals is one of the few things I am unable to grow accustomed to . 
 Would you mind if I ask the insurance policy of our company ? 
 I wonder whether I can enjoy the life insurance and health insurance . 
 Hello , I'm returning your phone call . 
 No problem , but what were you calling about ? 
 Is he messing up in school ? 
 What was he doing ? 
 I don't know what's gotten into him . 
 I will get right on that , and I am very sorry . 
 Are you from America ? 
 Yes . Nice to meet you ! 
 Thanks , I will appreciate it . How long have you been here ? 
 That's right . Once the contract with Stars.com is final , we'll deal with Zina . 
 Don't jump the gun . She's in the driver's seat right now . You have to be patient . 
 Settle down , Elvin . If you're not careful , you'll give our plan away . Zina's smart , you know . 
 You might want to try the mangoes . 
 It's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . It has a big seed in it . 
 Maybe some animals eat the seed , but humans don't . You'd have to soak it for 10 years . 
 Today you get a 50 - percent discount . They're only $ 1 each . 
 Their flesh is soft and juicy . It has a citrus taste . It's sweet . 
 Just press into it gently with your thumb . If it feels soft , it's ready to eat . 
 These are from Guatemala , but we're going to start getting mangoes from India . 
 Hold on , please . 
 Sorry , but she ’ s out . 
 I ’ d be glad to . 
 Yes , here is our offer , 30,000 skirts at 200 yuan per skirt , FOB New York . You will find our price comes in line with the prevailing market . 
 In fact , if it weren't for our good relations , we wouldn't consider making you a firm order at this price . 
 But you know our design is superior to any other products from other companies . In fact , there is no room to negotiate the price now . You should be aware that the production cost alone has doubled in the past year . 
 Are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night ? 
 Yes , I was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place . 
 That's what I thought you would do . Listen , I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . It's just down the street from all the bars . You probably don't want to be walking around after dark . 
 I wish it wasn't , but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here . 
 Do me a favor , and take a taxi . It'd make me feel a lot better . 
 When I first moved in , I walked everywhere . But within a week , I had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station ! Now , I always take public transportation . 
 Nothing else has happened to me , but I have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close . 
 Dad , I've finished my homework . 
 Do you want to play poker ? 
 I'll teach you . 
 Well , Betty . Since you ’ Ve done well during the probation period , we decided to employ you formally . And now we need to sign the formal agreement . 
 Of course . If you have any questions , just bring them out . 
 Well , it ’ s like this , during your first year , you will enjoy this salary level , a year later , we ’ ll increase your salary by 20 % . 
 Yes , maybe the personnel department made some mistakes in making the agreement . Do you have any other questions ? 
 Yes , welcome to our company . I hope we can cooperate happily . 
 I ’ d like to open a current account . 
 Here your are . I wonder how much interest can I earn for my current account . 
 Why is that ? 
 I see . How do I draw money from my news then . 
 Oh , yes.What do you recommend today ? 
 OK , I'll have it for change . 
 Hi , I would like to make a dinner reservation . 
 We will need the reservation for Tuesday night . 
 We would prefer 7 
 There will be 4 of us . 
 Thank you . The last name is Foster . 
 Thank you so much . I appreciate your help . 
 I have a Time Deposit here and I'd like to get the money now . 
 Yes , I know , but I need the money urgently for a family emergency , you see . I know I should apply in writing if I wish to withdraw , but I'm afraid there just isn't time . 
 Well , it can't be helped . I really must have that money . Thank you . 
 Yes , I'll have a boiled egg with toast and orange juice , please . 
 Hard-boiled , please . 
 Dark , please . 
 Later will do . 
 No , that's all . Thanks . 
 That's right . 
 Would you like to order now ? 
 Sure . I think pepper steak is quite good . Many guests like it very much . 
 Yes madam . I will give you the small one . 
 We need to redo the curtains and paint all the walls and ceilings . 
 You mean we can't just buy curtains already made ? 
 While the curtains are being made , I can start having people look at the kitchen . I can't stand that old kitchen . I won't be able to cook there . I don't want to use that electric stove . 
 I agree . The colors must be soft and pleasant . You should feel comfortable when you cook our dinners . 
 No , I don't think so . I'll be too busy having tea in our new tea room . 
 And you'll have to sell your motorcycle . And your cameras . Right ? 
 Four times might be enough . Not once or twice . 
 All right . Our insurance coverage is 110 % of the invoice value , up to the port of destination only . 
 Ok , this premium for the difference between 130 % and 110 % of the invoice value should be borne by the buyer . 
 I'm afraid I forgot to lock the door . 
 Sorry , Mum , I'll lock it right away . 
 Can I help you ? 
 What about the red one ? It's the best seller . 
 Yes , We have . 
 Sure , for how many ? 
 May I have your name ? 
 Yes . Do you have any flight to Paris on 15th ? I want one leaving in the afternoon . 
 Is it a direct flight ? 
 Well , I don't think I want it . 
 Oh , it's really popular these days . 
 Honestly speaking , I think the one next to it suits you better . 
 That's not true . Look over there ! That lady chose the same one and she is surely older than you . 
 Which color do you like ? 
 Nice choice . 
 I hope not but it will take at least three hours . 
 Could you drive me to the bank ? 
 Go down this road and then turn left . 
 Can you believe that Obama is our new President ? 
 Did you vote for him ? 
 I voted for him . 
 Is that right ? 
 I hope so , because America needs a change . 
 I agree with you completely . 
 You know , you really ought to get a new pair of jeans . Those are falling to pieces . 
 Well , you ’ d better get another pair for work at least or you ’ re sacking on the spot . 
 Where do you intend to go ? 
 That's beautiful . 
 Hello , this is Miller . I'm calling about the appointment with Mr . Zhang for this afternoon . Something's just come up , I'm afraid the appointment will have to be rescheduled , I'm very sorry about the change . 
 You're very kind to say so . Thank you . Do you think tomorrow morning would suit him ? 
 Tomorrow afternoon , Um ... you see , I've made an appointment with Mr . Comet for tomorrow afternoon . In order to meet Mr . Zhang , I have to cancel the appointment with Mr . Comet , I'm afraid . 
 I understand . When do you think I can come and see him tomorrow afternoon ? 
 Yes , that's quite all right for me . 
 Yes , please . Have you any vacancies for tonight ? 
 No , I don't think so . 
 Amy , could you help me with this work ? 
 Okay . 
 Fill it up . Super Unleaded . 
 I just checked the oil myself , but you can check the tires . 
 I'll charge it . Here's my card . 
 Hello , I'd like to reconfirm my flight . 
 My flight No . is 102 leaving Baiyun Airport at fourteen twenty . 
 I am Jason Armstrong . My first initial is J . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 Thanks ! 
 Yes , there is . There is only one ship there every day . 
 It leaves at 9:30 a . m .. 
 Yes , all the cabins are fit for two . 
 At Pier Five . 
 I think I need some iced water , too . Is there an extra charge for that ? 
 That's fine . Could you give me some more napkins , too ? 
 Yes . I would also like some sweet-and-sour sauce and pepper . 
 Do I owe you for the sauce , pepper and napkins ? 
 May I help you , sir ? 
 All right . What is your type of skin ? 
 You can use this . It has special effect for keeping your face moisturized . It has this lotion , as a gift attached . 
 How about this one ? It is well-known for the effect of removing scurf . 
 Yes , it is a new brand . 
 Anything else ? 
 Yes , here you are . 
 I'll take two value meals . 
 One Coca Cola and the other a Sprite , please . 
 Yes , I'd like that , then . 
 No , thanks . That will be it . 
 Yes . After my graduation from university , I worked as a Customer Service Coordinator in a foreign representative office , and then I transferred to a joint venture as a Market Development Manager . So I am familiar with the market in China . 
 I learned to be patient when dealing with customers complaints and try my best to solve them . In addition , I learned at my previous jobs how to cooperate with my colleagues . 
 No , I haven't discussed my leaving plans with my current employer , but I am sure he will release me . 
 Very good . 
 They would say I'm a dependable and hard worker . 
 Someone has stolen my cell phone . 
 OK . I left my cell phone in my room this morning before I want out.When I come back it was gone . I have looked every where in my room and I can't find it . 
 Open you suitcase , please . 
 Do you have anything to declare ? 
 Any cigarette , liquor ? 
 What's this white powder ? Are they drugs ? 
 May I open one of these ? Let me taste it . 
 May I be of any help ? 
 What style ? 
 Ok . Here are the ones , turtleneck pullover , crewneck pullover , V-neck pullover and cowl-neck pullover . 
 Really . What do they mean ? 
 What do you think then ? 
 How much do I have to pay ? 
 Here you are . Can you put the bread in a separate bag ? 
 How come it is slow as a snail today ? 
 Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response to any click . 
 Ok . 
 We better see if he ’ s o . k . 
 He ’ s not answering . You ’ d better check his pulse and breathing . 
 Hello ? Yes . Someone has passed out at Connecticut Ave . and 1st St . He isn ’ t breathing and does not have a pulse . Yes . My friend is performing CPR . OK . Thank you . They ’ re sending an ambulance . Here , let me help . 
 Thank you so much . I have been expecting to come to China . 
 Oh , you needn't do that . 
 I would like to make an appointment for a project meeting . 
 I would like to meet on Monday . 
 I want to come in the morning . 
 Yes , I can bring the outline when I come to the meeting . 
 I think that we should have just the sub-committee . 
 No , I need directions , please . 
 Hi , John . What brings you to town ? 
 What do you think of the traffic today ? 
 Yeah . You can say that again . It ’ s noisy too . 
 Excuse me , miss . Can I have my dinner please ? I am so hungry . 
 Then please give me a cup of coffee . 
 Atlanta Daily . 
 Here you are . 
 Yes . We ’ re having a special sale on this machine here . 
 No . It ’ s Swedish . Would you like me to demonstrate it for you ? 
 How do I use the powder ? 
 How do I use the eye-drop and ointment ? 
 Well , I see . Thanks . 
 Housekeeping , may I come in ? 
 Good coming , sir . May I do your room now ? 
 Your room will be ready in half an hour . 
 Of course , sir . Have a good day . 
 Yes , to tell you the truth , there is . 
 Well , I've lost my wallet and my ID card . 
 Forget it , there is no use crying over the spilled milk . 
 She had a sudden heart attack . 
 Don ’ t worry . She is much better now . But you are not permitted to disturb her at the moment . 
 Yes , I think so . 
 My pleasure . 
 It covers an area of 75,000 square meters . 
 In the early 70s . We ’ ll soon be celebrating the 30th anniversary . 
 Thank you . 
 500 . We ’ re running on three shifts . 
 Our associates specializing in these fields make some access - ries . Well , here we ’ re at the production shop . Shall we start with the assembly line ? 
 I ’ m sorry , dad . But you can ’ t do that . It ’ s for me to decide . 
 I didn ’ t say I ’ d already decided , dad . I said it was for me to decide . There is a difference . 
 I didn ’ t say that either . I was hoping we could discuss the matter together . I want your advice but I don ’ t want you to tell me what to do . I ’ Ve got to make decisions for myself , dad . 
 Before I answer that , I want to make sure that you know what I was looking for . Are you clear on what I was looking for ? 
 I inspect the home for problems that might not be all that apparent in a quick walk-through . 
 The owners might not be aware of everything wrong with the house . Some things are hidden , but might still be a problem for you in the future . 
 I inform you of the problems . If there are major problems , you can decline to buy the house or they may wish to fix any problems . 
 I found some fairly major problems . A major support beam in the roof is broken , and the shower floor leaked and rotted out the second-floor joist . 
 Oh , I'm sorry , Nigel . I'm rushing to a meet right now . 
 Sure , but this week is crazy for me . Can we make it next Monday ? 
 That's fine . See you then . 
 Let's just park here . 
 Oh , the policeman's coming . 
 Yes , and I am very satisfied with it . 
 Would you please tell me about fringe benefits of the company ? 
 What do they include ? 
 That sounds great . 
 The fringe benefits in your company are excellent , and it's generous of you to offer five insurances and one fund 
 I want to know if the staff can get a vacation every year . 
 That's quite good . Thank you for telling me about those . 
 Yes , Dad ? 
 Well , no . It just seemed like another bill we ’ d have to pay . 
 That's true . Well , how much do you think I should get ? 
 Do you have any special skills ? 
 What qualifications have you got ? 
 Do you get special training in office skills ? 
 Please tell me about work you have done , which qualifies you for this job . 
 Can I help you ? 
 To buy or to rent ? 
 How much do you want to pay ? 
 Well , I've got one here . It's 260 a month . 
 It's got a kitchen , a bathroom , and one bedroom . 
 Yes , I think so . There is also an interesting one.It ' s opposite the park . 
 It's 325 a month . It's the biggest we've got in this area . 
 Well , There're two bedrooms , a sitting room , a kitchen and a bathroom . 
 Of course , Sir . 
 We need to get food ? 
 What are you going to buy ? 
 Go and look in the kitchen . 
 You should just get the basics . 
 Get some eggs , milk , and bread . 
 Okay , I'll write it down for you . 
 That won't be a problem , sir . 
 You're right , sir . Your whole day is still ahead of you . 
 We have a storage place here , but you have to leave a deposit . 
 Just present your VISA card , and there won't be any problems . 
 Okay , sir , but remember how close it is to your checkout time . 
 Hello , there . I've just started using your net banking and I'm looking for some information about my Commission Fund . 
 Regarding what exactly ? 
 Good morning , is this Ryan ? 
 Ryan , this is Malia , and I need to call in sick today . 
 I went hiking and have terrible poison oak . 
 I think I got it on Saturday , but it just showed up today . 
 The doctor prescribed an ointment and gave me a shot . 
 Good morning , I am Monica . Are you Mr . White , the manager of finance department ? I am the newcomer and also working in the finance department . 
 Thank you . I am very happy to have my own office now . I ’ Ve never had one before . It is very nice . 
 Really ? What could that be ? 
 That is very kind of you . Thank you very much . 
 Pass him . 
 I need help finding a new refrigerator . 
 That Kenmore looks nice . 
 What makes is so great ? 
 What appliances are you talking about ? 
 May I take a look inside ? 
 It's very nice . I'd like to purchase this refrigerator . 
 Let me see . Yes , we still have four left . 
 How long would you stay ? 
 Are you going somewhere ? 
 Where do you work ? 
 You didn ’ t tell me you were working there this year . 
 How ’ d you get that job ? 
 That ’ s interesting . 
 How much do they pay ? 
 I was anxious to find out what the sellers had to say about my counter-offer . 
 Did they go with the proposed counter-offer ? 
 Is a home inspection very expensive ? 
 Do I get to choose who inspects the home ? 
 Can you call the owners with my acceptance right away ? 
 Julia and Anne have both taken dance lessons.They want to be famous dancer , I think . 
 I don't see much difference , anyway . 
 Sixty dollars . 
 I'm afraid I have lost my ticket . Can I buy one again ? 
 I'm going to Nanchang . 
 At Huangshan . 
 And by the way , what time shall we get to Nanchang ? 
 Thanks . 
 I've been looking forward to visiting your factory . 
 Do you have some good ideas of losing weight ? 
 Any more ? 
 Got it . 
 Well , it seems that I should do some jogging from tomorrow on . 
 I want to buy a bottle of perfume for myself . 
 I don't like strong perfumes . 
 I don't think it smells nice . 
 Yes , here you are . 
 Sure . The bittersweet perfume has a calming effect on the nerves . 
 How much is it ? 
 I'll take it . 
 Yes . He's waiting for you in his office . This way , please . 
 I ’ m Liu Yi . I ’ d like to speak to Mr . Smith . 
 I ’ d like to speak with Mr . Robert Smith . 
 Excuse me . May I see that laptop for a moment ? 
 No , the one on the left . Yes , that ′ s the one . ... Thank you . 
 That ′ s impressive ! What ′ s the sale price ? 
 I bought it . I got a watch , too . The company that sells this car has a car club . 
 Yeah , and meet other drivers of the same car ! 
 I know girls love this kind of car . Look , it's got a sunroof ! Imagine ... a cool , starry night ... 
 No . I borrowed it to go shopping . 
 I wish I could place a monthly order for a minimum of 50 cases , introducing your goods to my customers , but your price , $ 100 for a case , is too high in this highly competitive market . 
 People here desire medium-priced air freshener only . Please carefully consider my proposal , which will lead to a larger business between us . 
 Then , I am sorry to say I must regretfully decline your offer and seek quotations for the other suppliers . 
 Yes . I'll welcome other opportunities to do business with you . 
 I said it ’ s a lovely day . Why don't we go for a walk ? 
 Come on ! Rest breads rust . 
 I hope it won't be too long . It would be a shame not to take advantage of such lovely weather . 
 OK ! See you later ! 
 Yeah , I just cannot find it anywhere . 
 You are risking your neck . Don ’ t you know they have guns . 
 Hold on a second , please . I'll see if he's in . I'm sorry , Mr.Baker had just gone out . Who's calling ? 
 Yes , certainly . What's that ? 
 OK , I'll have Mr.Baker call you as soon as he comes back . 
 You're welcome . 
 Correct . I have expected to visit here for a long time . So fortunate for me , I can realize this expectation and meet you , Arden , and your kind-hearted staff in your company . 
 That is one of reasons why I am here now . I am really willing to have some cooperation with your company . 
 Good morning . I ’ m thinking about buying some new furniture for my living room . Could you help me ? 
 I came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . I think I like the black leather suite . It's on sale , isn't it . 
 I ’ ll take it . I also need to improve the lighting in my living room . Do you have any suggestions ? 
 It ’ s quite large . It ’ s about 40 square meters . 
 OK . I like the design of this lamps . I also need some cushion covers . I ’ ll just browse through those ones over there . 
 Okay . I'm going to stay up a while . I've got to go over the household budget . We've sightly overspent this month . 
 But I'm not sleepy , darling . I want to finish it today . 
 Okay . Good night . Have a good dream . 
 A friend told me I might find a room here . 
 What do you charge ? 
 OK . Would it be all right to look at the room first ? 
 What ’ s up ? You look so blue . 
 How do you like Chinese food ? 
 What other kind of food do you like ? 
 Well , we've settled the problems of price , quality and quantity . What mode of payment do you wish to employ ? 
 Could you adopt D / A or D / P ? You see I have to pay a deposit when I open a letter of credit . That will tie up my funds and add to the cost of my imports , especially for such a huge order . 
 Anyhow , there would be certain bank charges . We've done business for years and you should have some faith in our credit . It would help me greatly , if you could accept D / A or D / P . It makes no difference to you , but it does to me . 
 Hi , I ’ m Mary Smith . 
 Nice to meet you Mr . Taylor . 
 O . K . , John . Well , can I have a look at the place ? 
 Oh , it hasn ’ t been painted yet . 
 Well . It ’ s certainly nice . You ’ Ve done a great job . 
 The rent is $ 600 a month ? 
 Well , I think I ’ ll take it . Can I write you a check for the security deposit now ? $ 1200 ? 
 That would be fine . 
 See you . 
 Yes , sir . Can I help you ? 
 Medium rare , that ’ s right , sir . I remember your order . 
 If it is not to your satisfaction , I ’ ll certainly bring you another . But I ’ m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes . 
 What's this city famous for ? 
 Where can we have the famous tea ? 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , that is me . Nice to meet you , Monica . Welcome on board ! 
 Well , we have nicer things than that in this company . You will find out soon . 
 Well , I bet you will love them too . If you need help , just ask me any time . I am in the next door . You can also reach me through the extension 508 . 
 What kind of document is an invoice ? 
 How many kinds of foreign invoices are there ? 
 What does the price in different kinds of invoices include ? 
 Oh , I see . 
 We are going to have a party tonight , would you please look after our baby tonight ? 
 That's good . 
 I'd like to buy one of these refrigerators . Do I have to pay in cash ? 
 Fine . Will you work out the details , please ? 
 Thank you . 
 What kind of references do you need ? 
 I'm sure he could , but I prefer not to bother him . Would my bank do ? 
 With tomorrow being Labor Day and all , I think it would be a nice gesture to let all the members of laboring staff leave work an hour early . What do you say ? 
 Well , we all get Labour Day off as a holiday , the real purpose of the holiday is to remember all the people who do manual or other hard labor . It's to celebrate those who work doing what other people might not be willing to do . I think we ought to do something in honor of the common worker . 
 In our company , the loborial force makes up 60 % of our workers . We'd just be letting slightly over half the folks out a little early . 
 Everything's going very well . The first phase of the project was finished three days ahead of schedule . We're on target to complete phase two by the beginning of week 40 . 
 Well , we've just finished laying the cabling and we're waiting for the safety inspector to give us the go-ahead to continue . I'm just going to meet him . Do you want to come ? 
 Yes . I'd like to make a reservation to New York for 18th next month . 
 How long is that journey ? 
 Thank you . 
 Not yet . 
 A trim and perm . 
 A cold-wave , please . 
 Hello , Shelly , is it ? I'm here on behalf of my company , so I'll need the Corporate Banking Services . 
 I need to have a credit check done for my company . 
 That's no problem . Do you offer any other consulting services ? 
 Great . I'll wait right here , thanks . 
 We've brought you a little something from the place down the street , Kitty Cafe-Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee beans ! 
 ... yes , but this one has an all-new buzz . 
 What's so special about this song ? 
 Not very much . It sounds too emotional to me . 
 I'm afraid my association with Broadway musicals is rather limited . 
 I have a better idea . Let's go to a jazz concert and I'll give you an education in jazz . 
 Yes . I have reserved a table for 2 at 7:30 . My name is Bob . 
 Three of our friends will join us so can you seat 5 people at that time ? 
 Thank you . 
 I'm Jack in Room 606 . Can you change the room for me ? It's too noisy . My friend was woken up several times by the noise from upstairs . He said it was too much for him . 
 Anyway , I'd like to change our room . 
 Good afternoon.can I be of any assistance to you ? 
 Here are the suits . Which one would you like ? 
 Mary , I will have an interview tomorrow . I am so excited ! 
 I only typed several copies of my resume . 
 What are they ? 
 I see 
 Yes , I have those . 
 I will get it soon . 
 Ok , I will remember . 
 Hello , thanks for calling 123 Tech Help , I ’ m Todd . How can I help you ? 
 It ’ s okay sir , calm down . What happened ? 
 Ok , sir , it sounds like you might have a virus . 
 No , your computer might have a virus , I mean , it has a bad program on it . Maybe that ’ s why it crashed . I recommend that you run an antivirus program in order to safely remove any unwanted spyware or Trojans . 
 Recently I have been getting headache and my eyes come to see focus properly . 
 Two years ago . At that time I had no problems . Now I can ’ t even make out something ten meters away . 
 All right . 
 Well , this one is worse . 
 I can only read the first three lines . 
 Why ? 
 Oh , good . 
 I prefer TV play to football . 
 What are you going to do ? 
 Maybe we can enjoy the TV play together . It's interesting . 
 That's great ! 
 This TV is $ 2500 . 
 That's how much this t . v costs . 
 This television is of very high quality . 
 By how much ? 
 I'm sorry , but the price is final . 
 Look at me . I look so old ! I look as if I were thirty . 
 Yes , I am , but I think it ’ s time for some plastic surgery I ’ m tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin . See ? 
 Whatever , I think I ’ m gonna get liposuction and a nose job and some breast implants as well . 
 I thought you were my friend and would support me on this ! I just want to feel better about myself and feel more attractive . 
 Really ? 
 morning . Phyllis Seymour speaking . 
 Thank you very much , Mr . Parker . But , that is my job . 
 What time's your flight ? 
 I'll try one of these on . ( The customer tries one of the shoes on . ) It's too big . It slides up and down my heel when I walk around . 
 Not really . It pinches my toes . 
 I don't know ... well , I guess I'll take them , since you don't seem to have anything better . 
 I really need to go shopping . 
 I need to look for a new bedroom set . 
 I have absolutely no idea . 
 No , I'm not sure where they sell nice bedroom sets . 
 Yes , because I love yours . 
 Is IKEA affordable ? 
 Hello , could I make a reservation ? 
 6 o'dock in the evening . 
 Do you offer mutton hot pot at noon ? 
 Then we will come here for lunch tomorrow . 
 I've got all the presents I need , and my family is working together to get all the food ready . That's easy , but I have another problem to deal with . 
 No , I did that a long time ago . It's about telling my son the truth about Santa Claus . 
 Yes . He's never said anything so I never told him . But now that he's getting older ... 
 Yes , he's too old to believe in that type of things . And I'd rather tell him before the kids at school do . 
 I can understand . I was lucky with my oldest , she figured it out by herself and didn't tell my son . 
 Hello , this is 5735647 5 . 
 This is Linda . 
 Really ? What time and which restaurant ? 
 Ok , I'll wait for you at 7pm at home . Anything else ? 
 Thank you . Bye . 
 What ’ s the matter , dear ? 
 Oh , dear . Did you lose a lot of money ? 
 You must tell the embassy about it . And I think they ’ ll issue you with a new one . 
 No . But you mustn ’ t leave it too long . Did you report it the police ? 
 Yes , we're interested in seeing the rooms for rent . 
 That is exactly what we're looking for . 
 That sounds all right to us . 
 How about tomorrow afternoon ? 
 See you tomorrow . 
 Squid balls ? How about some more fruit ! 
 Yeah , it's funny . I usually don't ever eat fruit ... 
 Mon and I got in another fight , Boris . 
 it was over food . I simply wanted some fried chicken but she said no . 
 oh , she keeps saying that . She never allows me to have them . 
 But , Boris , i am not a baby any more . 
 how about your mother ? 
 poor you . It seems we are in the same boat . 
 really ? so you don't have fried food at all . 
 how do you manage it ? 
 I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking . 
 I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house . 
 Not necessary . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive . 
 Realtors always get a commission . If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him . 
 Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them . 
 Of course we need a house inspector . But we can hire an inspector on our own . As for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us . 
 It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper . Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them . 
 Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves . 
 That is because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher . He will have to pay a commission to the realtor . 
 It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time . That's why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome . 
 All right . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drugstore . 
 Well , since we're collecting gifts instead of red envelopes , I made a " for guests only " gift chat room . 
 The Taiwanese won't have time to buy gifts in America . The chat room is more convenient . 
 Or discuss what gifts they could buy together . 
 We can also put a guest book on the website for people to sign and write comments . 
 Yeah , that will be the best part . Jack hasn't seen yours yet , right ? 
 I have a taste for something sweet . 
 I want some kind of dessert . 
 I was thinking about ordering some kind of pie . 
 I honestly don't know . 
 What's your favorite kind ? 
 That sounds really good to me right now . 
 Hi , Cole . What can I do for you ? 
 sure , have a seat . 
 let me just grab your file . How long have you worked for us now ? 
 one year already ? It's amazing how time flies like that . Are you enjoying your job ? 
 I see . What job did you have in mind . 
 do you understand what duties that job would entail ? 
 that's right . Do you have any experience in management ? 
 well , I think you'd be the perfect candidate for the position . According to company policy , you'll still have to go through the formal application procedures though , so fill this application form in 
 Thanks for coming in today , did you have any trouble finding us ? Please take a seat . 
 So , let ’ s get started . tell me a bit about your educational background . 
 Interesting . And , your postgraduate studies ? 
 Very good . Now , tell me a little bit about your work experience . I see here that you previously worked at Oracle . 
 Interesting ... 
 We still have an important attraction . 
 Melbourne Zoo . 
 The place is a must-see . This zoo was built in 1862 , and it's the oldest zoo in the world , and still among the best . There are more than 3,000 species of animals here , including the popular kangaroos , wallabies , koalas , and wombats . 
 Most animals are not locked up in tiny cages . Rather , they are set in almost natural surroundings or well-tended gardens . 
 Of course , I'm sure you will like it . 
 Yes . in some sense . I should say I like mountain climbing , you know , because I'm not so professional . How about you ? 
 How did you spend the night there ? 
 I had a similar experience , but that was on the top of Tasha Mountain in my country . 
 Yes.It IS one of the Five Mountains . 
 I'd love to . 
 I had a drop too much last night . I attended a banquet given by a Chinese colleague of mine . And it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a Chinese table . 
 I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me . But if I keep gulping down one cup after another , I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick . 
 A few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood . 
 I got you . Next time . I'll preface a toast with a statement like ' I can't drink any more ' and then drink anyway . 
 Yes , I'd like some information about the trains to Beijing . 
 On July 7 , I have to be there well before twelve o ’ clock . 
 And I have to get up early , too . Are there any non-stop trains to Beijing ? 
 Next please . 
 That'll be five yuan forty , please . 
 I work at a hospital . 
 No , I'm a nurse . 
 What kind of scarf shall I show you ? We have them in all sorts and sizes . 
 At your service . Will this suit you ? 
 This is Chinese made . 
 Yes , it ’ s already fifty yuan off the original price . 
 Sorry , we can ’ t come down any more . 
 And the problem is , sir ? 
 My apologies , sir . We'll give you a new room and refund the value of your current room . 
 We always try to serve our guests in the most agreeable way possible . 
 All of the major sights are included . You'll visit the Louvre , the Eiffel Tower and all of the top museums . You'll also take a day trip out of Paris to Versailles . 
 Of course . Just give me your fax number . 
 Okay . I'll fax the itinerary to you immediately . 
 We also have to vacuum the house . 
 You'd better believe it . 
 No . You're going to do the entire house . 
 I'm going to mow the lawn . 
 Not even a single drop ? 
 I don't know . Since yesterday morning , the water pressure has dropped to a little more than a drip . 
 Yeah , I called and they said they'd send someone over . 
 It was 36 hours ago . 
 Hello , Sir . What can we do for you today ? 
 L / C stands for ' letter of credit ' . This is necessary for trade between two countries . A Letter of Credit is quite literally that — a letter addressed by the buyer's bank to the seller's bank stating that they could vouch for their good customer , the buyer , and that they would pay the seller in case of the buyer's default . Nowadays , it's sometimes used for domestic trade too . 
 Excuse me . Could you tell me how to get to the library ? 
 On Memorial Avenue ? 
 I'm afraid I don't . I'm quite new in town . 
 No , I don't . But I do know where the shopping mall is . 
 Well , thank you very much , I hope I can find it . 
 No . 
 It involves a lot of travel . 
 I ’ m not sure where to pick up my ballot . 
 How are you going to help me ? 
 Fabulous . Thanks . 
 I have it right here . 
 Now what am I supposed to do ? 
 Sounds good . Thanks . 
 Leave it to me . I'll fix it . 
 I'd like to have a shave . 
 Sure . But my beard is rough . 
 Yes , please . 
 Wonderful . How much is the cost altogether ? 
 Here you are . Thank you , bye-bye ! 
 I would like to order a suit made to my own measure . 
 Maybe I should try to lose weight . 
 How much do you expect to earn ? 
 If you are hired , you are in charge of the design of toys that can meet the needs of the American market . 
 Ok . 
 Ok , here you are . 
 No , I don't . 
 Yes , I have two cotton of cigarettes one bottle of whisky . 
 No , this is the medicine for the stomach . 
 Yes , Sir , go ahead , here you are . 
 What do you have ? 
 Can I have apple pie with ice cream ? 
 I love your home-made apple pie.It ’ s delicious.Can I have another glass of lemonade as well ? 
 Ok.Would you like a drink too ? 
 Are you having any dessert ? 
 The central Hotel , please . I have to be there by 6:00 . 
 Yes . I've never been here before . 
 No , I'm open to suggestions . 
 That's a good idea . 
 Thanks a lot . Here's ten yuan . Keep the change . 
 Oh , yes , if you like.The large one goes to Washington.The other one I will take with me . All right ? 
 Oh , thank you . Thank you very much . 
 My present pay is RIB 3 , 000 yuan each month . 
 What is important to me is the job and the people who I will be working with , so regarding salary , I leave it to you and I am sure that you will make me a fair offer . 
 Yes , it is quite satisfactory . I accept it . 
 To whom should I report ? 
 What are the benefits ? 
 I would like to know if there would be any opportunity to work abroad in the future ? 
 Thank you . Then I think it's time for us to sign a letter of intent . 
 Wow ! What a beautiful scenic spot . It's so open . And just breathe that fresh air , you can almost taste its freshness . 
 Wonderful ! I'll often come here for mountain climbing . 
 No wonder people say , Even the immortals would rather be Guiliners . 
 I didn't know you liked bird watching . 
 How about this floor lamp ? 
 We still need to find an armoire and a dresser . 
 Great ! Pick me up in about an hour because I think I ’ ll also get a bean bag and a dining set . 
 Recliner ? In my beautifully decorated living room ? I don ’ t think so ! 
 May I take your size ? 
 No problem . 
 About a week . 
 20 yuan for a skirt . 
 Yes , my name is Max Richards . May I please speak to George Nelson ? I have already called several times . It seems I always catch him out of the office . 
 I'm sorry , I didn't hear you clearly . Could you repeat that please ? 
 Can I leave a message for him please ? 
 My name is Max Richards , my phone number is 898-3423 . Could you ask him to call me back as soon as he gets back , please ? I have a rather timely matter to discuss with him . 
 Yes , please let him know I would like to discuss the Girard case with him . 
 Which tooth is it ? 
 Ah , yes . There's big cavity . 
 I'm afraid not . The tooth is too far gone . It'll have to be taken out . 
 You'd better wait . The gums are swollen . Take the medicine I prescribe and come back in three days . 
 I'm very sorry to hear that . 
 We'll take great care . 
 Promise you are not going to be angry ? 
 I forgot . 
 Ah , ah , you promised , and remember ? 
 Sure . I don ’ t mind . 
 I don ’ t see why not . 
 Go ahead . It ’ s OK with me . 
 No . 
 Here , sir , sit down in this wheelchair . 
 The doctor will be with you in a moment . I just need to ask you a few questions . 
 Name , age and date of birth , please . 
 Health insurance company and policy number ? 
 What ? 
 Well , this is going to be a very expensive broken leg , Mr . Taylor . 
 Hi Steve , it's nice to meet you . I hear that you're looking for an apartment , and I just rented a two-bedroom downtown . I'm looking for a compatible roommate . 
 Alright . So tell me , how would you describe yourself ? 
 I'm like that too . I like to invite friends over sometimes , but I don't want to have lots of crazy parties at the apartment . 
 Yes . I ’ d like to book a table for Friday evening please . 
 We ’ ll be eight or nine people . Could we book a private room ? 
 About 7 thirty . 
 My name is Jenkins . My phone number is 7539738 2 . that ’ s confirmed then . 7 thirty on Friday . 
 Oh , we ’ d like the buffet please . We ’ Ve heard it ’ s very good . 
 How do you do , Ms . Chi ? 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , we have . I ’ Ve brought with me a list of the quantity of your products we ’ d like to import for the second half of this year . Here is a copy of it . 
 I hope so , too . Now I'd like some of your sales literature and a price list for all of your export articles . 
 Thank you , Ms Chi . What are your normal export terms ? 
 What commission do you usually pay for your exports ? As you know , we import on commission basis . 
 All right . When can we meet again for more specific details , Ms Chi ? 
 I'll be expecting you , then . 
 Yeah . Complete with nice of you . 
 Mm , let me see . I think there are 2 in the bedroom , and 1 each in the living room and kitchen . 
 I call the landlord right now . 
 Yes , does the renting include utilities ? 
 How much is the cable ? 
 Also , are they allowing the apartment ? 
 I see . Do you love pets ? 
 Good afternoon , sales department.May I help you ? 
 I'll see a piece available , who should I say is calling , please ? 
 Hold the line , please.Mr Wood is in the meeting with managing director at the moment I afraid.Can I help you ? 
 I don't think the meet will go on much longer , should I ask him to call you when he is free . 
 Could I have your name again , please ? 
 And the number ? 
 Ok , you will be hearing from Mr Wood later in the afternoon then , Mr John . 
 You are welcome , goodbye . 
 I'm going to work . 
 Around 6 o'clock . 
 We are willing to work with you , but do you think it would be possible to extend your confirmation deadline ? We need to check the warehouse to make sure the products are in stock . The earliest I will be to get back to you is tomorrow morning . 
 We can do that , but it will cost ... If we have to check our inventory with all our guys on overtime , you're looking at an increased cost of , I'd say , maybe 10 % . 
 No , and let me tell you why ... If I make my guys stay over to check the inventory , I'll have to pay them at an overtime rate , which is time and a half . I estimate it will probably take 3 guys two hours to finish , that will be an increase on your labor fee by at least 10 % ... if you need the numbers that urgently , I can have them do it . Otherwise , we can wait until tomorrow morning , and I'll call you with the numbers after they're done . It's your call ... 
 Sure . Let ’ s go . What are you going to have done ? 
 A foot massage sounds like a great idea . They are very relaxing . I ’ d also like to have mudpack on my face . It ’ s supposed to help with your complexion . 
 This could become a very expensive trip to the beauty parlor ! 
 Oh , I agree . We both work hard and a little beauty treatment can relieve stress . 
 What ’ s special about a thai massage ? 
 Sounds painful ! 
 They are reports of our company . 
 No , they are filed according to dates . 
 No problem , here you are . 
 No , I don't . I don't have a family , so I don't think I need it . 
 Thank you , but I've never thought about it before . 
 Mrs . Miller , you are an old friend of ours . In order to encourage future business and as a gesture of friendship , we are prepared to cut our price by 5 % . Will that satisfy you ? 
 Now I repeat , 5,000 transistor sets , specifications as shown in our catalogue at $ 20 each C . I . F . Los Angeles . 
 As to packaging , we'll pack them two dozens to one carton , gross weight about 25 kilos a carton . 
 Yes , corrugated cardboard boxes . 
 Why use wooden cases ? 
 Cartons are comparatively light , and there fore easy to handle . They'll not be stowed away with the heavy cargo . Besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with metal straps . 
 You needn't worry about that . Cartons are extensively used in our shipments to foreign countries and there have never been complaints from our clients . Now , as regards payment , we have agreed to use dollars , am I right ? 
 Please open the letter of credit 15 to 30 days before the date of delivery so that we'll have enough time to make all the necessary arrangements . Another thing , the L / C should be valid until the 15th day after shipment . 
 Right . We'll ship the goods according to the agreed time schedule . Last , but not least , the inspection is to be carried out by Houston Commodities Inspection Bureau , which is final and binding on both parties . 
 Thank you . You can rest assured that we'll do everything possible to prevent de festive commodities from going abroad . However , if there should be any disputes , we wish to have them settled through friendly discussions . 
 Well , it seems we have covered everything . We'll have the contract ready in a couple of days . 
 Let me see . If we can't get the contract ready by then , we'll send it to you by airmail for your signature . 
 Excuse me , Is there a hotel nearby ? 
 how can I get there ? 
 Amanda , how do you like this peaked cap ? 
 But I think this one fits me Well . Why don't you try on the sombrero in black ? 
 Excuse me . Is this seat taken ? 
 Am I on right bus to Chicago ? 
 Oh , my God ! 
 I will . Thank you . 
 Oh . You took the wrong bus . You need to take Bus 151 which goes the opposite direction . 
 Don't worry . You can get off at the next stop and walk across the street and take the Bus 151 to the opposite direction . 
 About 15 stops . 
 My pleasure . 
 I see a problem . 
 I noticed that the faucet in the kitchen is leaking . 
 It ’ s going to be a problem when my water bill comes . 
 I would like you to fix the problem . 
 Well , I won ’ t be able to rent the apartment until the problem is fixed . 
 I ’ m happy that we ’ Ve come to an agreement . 
 Sorry , sir , here you are . 
 Please wait a moment , I will bring you one . 
 They look great ! Hey , are you hungry ? I know a good Ethiopian restaurant-Meskerem . 
 It's very “ in ” these days . Some of the places are really expensive . 
 No . Africans and African-Americans are different in many ways . Our food's different , too . 
 That ’ s true . I got the news yesterday . 
 Not bad . I ’ m confident . And I like challenges . 
 Thank you . 
 Is that so ? 
 Have you decided ? 
 Could you tell me why you want to quit ? 
 Oh , that sounds terrible . Would you be happier with higher pay here ? I " m sure something can be worked out . 
 OK . I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay . 
 Hello . I'm hoping to buy some Treasury Certificates today . Are they available ? 
 Ah , right . How much do I need to spend ? 
 How about Bearer Certificates ? Are they different ? 
 Could I change these pounds for dollars , please ? 
 It doesn't matter . 
 Yes , I'd like to know the exchange rate for yen . 
 I ’ m fabulous . 
 I need to make a withdrawal . 
 I need $ 300 . 
 Take it from my checking account . 
 Thank you so much . 
 That ’ s it for today . 
 Of course not . 
 I'm afraid I don't know how to use your camera . 
 I see . 
 It's time to go to bed . 
 I don't care , it's school in the morning . 
 Mum , pass me some more please ! 
 But the ads say they're most nutritious . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Well , you heard right.You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here.We have great discounts for students . 
 Well , first let's consider your computer.Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend--the Power Macintosh G3.It comes with 64 megabytes of total memory . 
 Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have.What department are you in ? 
 Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing.We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your 
 Yes . 
 Yes . It's an excellent system . 
 Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Macintosh and Apple are the same thing . 
 I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment . 
 Yes . 
 That's not true.Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh.They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . Ma 
 Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular.But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used . 
 There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh.Chinese is no problem for Apple . 
 No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends.But believe me , most of the students here in the university--Asian students included--most of them use Apple . 
 You're very welcome . Here is my card , if you need any help . 
 I hope so . I'm not actually a customer here , but I saw an advertisement in yesterday's newspaper about your new bank card . 
 Yes , please . But I suppose I'll have to open an account with you first , right ? 
 Could I open an account with you today ? 
 Yes , here you go . And sign here ? 
 So quick and easy ! Thanks very much . 
 Hello . I'm here to talk about my credit card . You see , I'm a corporate card holder and a personal card holder . I've had my personal credit card for ages , but my corporate one is new to me . 
 Is there anything else ? 
 And I suppose I can do that anywhere ? I do have to travel a lot for my job and it's such a hassle using cash and collecting all the separate receipts . 
 In just one document ? That will definitely be a time saver . 
 Yes . When is the next train to New York City ? 
 Aren't there any trains before 10 thirty ? 
 Then one to New York at 10 thirty . 
 One way . 
 How much is a soft ? 
 Then one hard seat , please . 
 IBA Bank , Business Banking Department . Ling Ming speaking . How may I help you ? 
 Hello , Mr Gwent . What can I do for you today ? 
 Of course . Do you know which bank it was sent through and the amount and currency ? 
 Yes , here it is . That's received and cleared , so it's available for withdrawal . 
 It costs $ 65 to buy a monthly pass . 
 There are student passes . 
 It doesn't cost anything for the pass . 
 The monthly sticker costs you . 
 Each month it'll cost $ 24 for a new sticker . 
 Let me go get it for you . 
 I can recommend the spare ribs . They are very tasty here . 
 Ok why don ’ t you order the braised fish then ? 
 Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll help you eat it . 
 I'm doing well . How about you ? 
 So how have you been lately ? 
 I'm actually in school right now . 
 I'm attending PCC right now . 
 It's not bad . There are a lot of people there . 
 Thanks . 
 Yes , I am . That's why I make plans before I do anything . 
 I want to make more contact with extra clients and use my organizational skills in the future . 
 Oh , yes . 
 Yes . Thank you . 
 And ? 
 All right . 
 Thank you for your reminding . 
 I can't wait to see it . 
 I want to buy some records . 
 Are there the records of Michael Jackson ? 
 Oh . it's too late . Maybe I should go to other video stores to have a look . 
 That sounds like fun . What's the weather going to be like ? 
 Is it going to be perfect beach weather ? 
 Good . I hope it doesn't cool off this weekend . 
 But you know that California weather is really unpredictable . 
 I really wish the weather would just stay the same . 
 Yeah , that would make things a lot easier . 
 I said , " Is there anything I can do ? " 
 It's no trouble at all . I'll carry this suitcase for you . 
 I'm considering buying a new car , the old one hasn't been running too well recently , and was wondering what kind of credit you can offer me . 
 That's great . I'm looking to borrow quite a large sum , though . 
 That's good news . The car I'm interested in is priced at 120,000 RIB , but I think I can get a bit of discount on that . I can afford to put up around 40,000 RIB myself . 
 The funds are all ready to go in my personal account , so let's transfer it . 
 Would you please fill out this registration 1 form ? 
 Did I ? Let me see that ... Oh , sorry ... here you are . 
 Come in please . 
 Sure.How much is it ? 
 Well , here is the money . 
 Fine . 
 Of course . I spent the whole week to know the general process for these plans . And since I was employed , I have been working on them . Madam , how am I doing ? Are you satisfied with my job ? 
 I suppose so . I tried my best to be familiar with all these appliances and office process . Certainly without my colleagues ' help , I could not do these things in such a short period . 
 Thanks for your praise , Madam . 
 Hmm . That's not too bad . Does it have a stopwatch ? 
 Oh . I see . Where are your digital watches ? 
 I don't like this kind as much . Never mind the stopwatch then . I'll take that other one . Do you take checks ? 
 Here you are . 
 Housekeeping . May I help you ? 
 Of course . What room are you in , sir ? 
 And do you know which room the noise is coming from ? 
 Thank you . We'll take care of it . Please let us know if there's anything else we can do to make your stay more comfortable . 
 How do you usually part your hair ? 
 ( The hair stylist cuts the customer's hair . ) Almost done . I just have to even things up a bit . ( She shows the customer the results . ) Will that do ? 
 Would you like a shave ? 
 Okay , let me brush you off . Thank you very much for coming .

 No , I can't . I've really got important business . 
 OK . 
 Sure , what ’ s up ? 
 Okay ... what makes you say that ? I thought you were pleased with his overall performance . Didn ’ t you just tell me last week how impressed you were with his attitude ? 
 Well , I ’ m sure he had a perfectly good reason ... 
 Yeah , but come on , Geoff , as if you don ’ t check Facebook at work . Look , you hired this guy , we ’ Ve invested a lot of time and money in his training , so now it ’ s up to you to coach him . Make it work , Geoff ! 
 Golden Taxi cabs , how may I help you ? 
 Sure , where are you ? 
 Tom , hi , this is Mary with Gold Star Mortgage . 
 We'd like you to come to work for us . 
 I see . 
 Please call us if you change your mind . 
 May , my grandpa is ill . I will go to look after him . Catch you later ! 
 Your request for compensation makes me surprised . What happened ? 
 Could you tell me the particulars ? 
 Yes , I do . 
 Really ? We began to load the goods after we made sure they were qualified . 
 Is this the foreign exchange department ? 
 I need some US Dollars . 
 RIB . By the way , what is the exchange rate today ? 
 And I want to change 4000 Yuan . 
 OK , thank you . 
 I want to take them to court for arresting me . 
 There was no reason for them to arrest me . 
 They released me the next morning . 
 That ’ s exactly what they did . 
 They said I matched the description of a robber . 
 I ’ m definitely taking them to court . 
 Yes , I want to restate one more time the importance of reinventing our company's image to appeal to different customer bases . I want to end with a true story that has to do exactly with what we've been talking about today ... 
 I enjoy drawing and painting . 
 Yes , I do . 
 I learned back in high school . 
 Yeah , I loved that art class . 
 Thank you very much . 
 I'm sure you have a talent . It's just hidden . 
 Actually , I don't think I can eat another bite ! 
 Actually , I think we want to pay our bill . 
 Good morning , madam . What can I do for you ? ! 
 Certainly , madam . What kind of coffee would you like ? 
 Well , we have espresso , cappuccino , latte , skinny latte and Americano . 
 Here you are . You'll find the sugar just over there . 
 Hello , this is the Corporate Department of Lincoln Bank calling . We are calling to let you know that some documents have arrived for you at our bank . 
 They're from Schnitt's of Rudesheim , Germany . Would you like us to check them ? 
 It's 150 RIB for the service .

 I thought I did . 
 Thank you very much . 
 That can ’ t be right ! 
 All right . Thank you very much . 
 Yes , I want to have a photo . 
 Yes . I am ready . 
 Not very well . I haven ’ t found anything within my price range yet . 
 I can only afford about 300 pounds a month . 
 Really ? That ’ s a lot of money to pay for one room . 
 Do you know of anyone who needs a roommate ? 
 I ’ d prefer non-smoking roommates , but I guess I ’ ll have to take what I can get ! 
 I can sign a contract up to a year . I don ’ t know where I ’ ll be after that . 
 I don ’ t have any furniture , so it ’ d be great if it were furnished . 
 No , I thought that would be included in the rent . 
 I don't think I can afford that . 
 That ’ s a good idea . I ’ ll look into finding something like that . 
 Well , I think you'll like the mangoes . 
 It's a fruit . It has a big stone in it . 
 No . You would break all your teeth on it . 
 The sale price today is $ 1 each . 
 They usually taste sweet , but they remind me of an orange . 
 Don't cut into them until you can feel that they're soft on the outside . 
 They come from tropical countries . 
 Take me to the center station , please 
 Do you think you can get me there seven thirty ? 
 Hope we have good luck . 
 Thank you very much . Here's 10 $ , keep the change , please . 
 Hello . I want to buy some RIB , is it OK to use US dollars ? 
 I think 250 dollars should be sufficient . 
 Oh , right , of course . Here you go . 
 It's correct . Is there any way I can change it back before I leave the country ? 
 That's wonderful news , thanks for all your help . 
 Yes ? 
 Sure . There ’ s a lot here in this pamphlet . 
 Take the subway . It ’ s $ 1.50 per ride . You can buy a metro card at the station . 
 My pleasure . 
 No , I don't want to . 
 Sam , I never like Haunted Houses.When I was a kid , I didn't like them . when I was in high school , I didn't like them.when I was in college , I didn't like them . So why should I like them now ? 
 Why don't we go to the Epcot Center instead ? They have displays from many cultures around the world . 
 Yes . That is something I will enjoy . 
 We still have most of the tickets we bought.We can go on a lot of different rides if you like . 
 Let's start walking to the Epcot Center then.According to this map , it is up this pathway here . 
 I am past my stop . Would you please let me get off ? 
 Well , that's OK . 
 OK . 
 Is she coming ? 
 They are announcing your flight . You'd better board the plane . 
 I am just reminding you about the time . You don't want to miss the plane , do you ? 
 Name it and I'll do it for you . 
 I've got it . 
 I am just doing what I think I should do . 
 This isn't like you ... Well , I hope you will have a nice flight and a successful start in business

 How long does the tour take ?

 I know . Thank you very much . 
 Thank you . 
 Are there pets allowed in this apartment ? 
 What about a boa constrictor ? 
 If I had one , could I rent this apartment ? 
 What about a Gila monster ? 
 John , could you come to my office ? I need to talk to you . 
 No.Come here right now . 
 What's the matter ? 
 Why ? I work very hard . 
 Well , some of those other guys are not the same kind I'd like to communicate with , but if that's important to you . I'll try to get along with them . 
 It's unfair . 
 OK . I need to think about that for a while . 
 Excuse me , ma ’ am ?

 New York Airport.May I help you ? 
 Hold on a moment please ... Sorry , the flight from London has been delayed . It departed two hours later than scheduled.The whether in London was really bad .

 Where are we going to visit today ? 
 Really ? I have heard there are many famous national park in the US , which one exactly ? 
 That's wonderful . I will see the Old Faithful for myself . 
 Yeah , the government really takes a bite , doesn ’ t it ? 
 Yeah , I don ’ t mind it either . We ’ ll both end up rich slobs and not need it , but what if we do , you know ? 
 Yeah . My grandmother gets by on social security and the money my grandfather invested when he was alive . 
 Really ? No , they couldn ’ t . None of them would have jobs if they did . 
 I don ’ t understand . Why do you want a cat ? 
 No , cats are too dirty . They are lazy and cunning . I don ’ t like them at all . 
 You can keep the cat , but you should keep it away from me . 
 Yes , could you tell me if there is a laundry in this hotel ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 I am sorry to say this , but I seem to have lost the key to the safe . 
 Yes , I believe so.How should I compensate for this ? 
 What ! One hundred U . S . dollars.Is it covered by the insurance ? 
 I'm tired . 
 Hello , George ! Haven't seen you for some time.Where have you been ? 
 Very well.Thank you.Did you have a good time there ? 
 Did you see the letter I got from Bradford Films ? They sent it in response to your phone call last week . 
 I guess they must not have your contact information , so they sent it addressed in care of your department head . Anyhow , they wrote to confirm in writing what you discussed about the Milton contract . 
 Sure , here it is ... 
 Did they ask you to send the files beforehand ? 
 I don't think so , why do you ask ? 
 Maybe they forgot to attach it to the letter . You should give them another call . 
 What size pan were you thinking of ? 
 Well , this one might work for you . 
 Here , lift this aluminum pan . It's the same size . 
 Here's a similar aluminum pan . But it has a heat-resistant handle . 
 I knew we'd find the right pan sooner or later . How would you like to pay ? 
 Oh , no problem . Here's the lid that comes with the pan . 
 No.My brother is playing football there . 
 Thank you for your compliments . 
 Have you thought about it seriously ? 
 Ok , did you find a new company ? 
 Good for you , but your leaving will be a great loss to us . It is so nice to work with you . 
 Who finances the magazine ? 
 Does it have a large circulation ? 
 Paul , can I set up a time with you to go over the training manual ? 
 Tuesday morning is good for me . How about 10:30 in my office ? 
 Look , all you do is press that button and it ’ s ready to use . 
 Just make sure you never touch the wire . 
 May I take your order ? 
 Oh , I'm so sorry . I thought you had one . Here you are . 
 I'm afraid we don't . But I'm sure you'll enjoy our lunch special . 
 I got a perfect look at the suspect . 
 That'll be easy . 
 Okay . 
 I see him . 
 The suspect is number four . 
 I'm happy to be of assistance . 
 Well , as I mentioned before , I think I am easy-going . I enjoy working and talking with people and I'm a responsible person . 
 No . Not at all . I'm quite easy-going . 
 Oh , I'm very responsible , I can make fast decisions , and I do not need much supervision . I enjoy completing challenging tasks . 
 Probably routine , dull work . Oh , I am much more enthusiastic if I'm given a challenge and responsibility . 
 A friendly one . I think an open , friendly , honest relationship should exist . An employee should feel she ( he ) can go to her ( his ) boss anytime with any kind of question . 
 Well , there's a lot of stress in a Chinese company also , although much of it is below the surface . I have confidence in my ability to handle conflict . If I have a problem with a co-worker , I do everything I can to work it out directly with that person . If I am unable to work it out , then I ask a supervisor to help out . If my boss shouts at me , I try not to take it personally . I try my best to understand the stress he is under . It's kind of like being in a family . Often family members say things in the heat of the moment , but don't mean what they say . A company is like a family , it has good times and bad times . 
 That's no problem . I know that every company has busy periods . When this happens , I'm ready to put in as much time as necessary to get the job done . 
 I want to feel that I am making a real contribution to the company , so I would like my boss to trust me with important work . 
 I'm quite outspoken . I enjoy calling a spade a spade and hate talking in a roundabout way . So I'd call myself outgoing . 
 Seldom . But I hate someone's frequently being late or lazy . 
 Hmm . as I mentioned , I can work well under pressure and I enjoy work that challenges me . I think that my English ability is also a strong point . 
 I think I sometimes try to be over-organized . So I am learning how to let some things go and concentrate on the most important part of my job . 
 It costs money , dear . What ’ s wrong with the regular television stations ? 
 Well , you already watch too much TV instead of doing your homework , anyway . 
 Well , that ’ s true , but you ’ d probably only watch cartoons and action movies . 
 Well , if everybody jumped off a bridge , would you jump too ? 
 Get new friends . 
 Because you ’ d end up spoiled rotten if I wasn ’ t . 
 Let ’ s see how your grades are this semester , and maybe I ’ ll talk to your father about it . 
 Hi , good to see you . What can we assist you with today ? Going away on business again ? 
 We do always recommend people take Traveller's Cheques when travelling overseas . The world is a dangerous place nowadays , you never know . 
 My god , it's such a lovely lake ! The lake has a water surface of 56 square kilometers . 
 We are now walking on what is in fact an island . Here we get one of the 10 sceneries of the West Lake , Autumn Moon over the Calm Lake . 
 It's so named because in the pavilion over there the great poet Bai Buyi of the Tang Dynasty would take a rest after drinking a little too much , and watch the moon over the lake . 
 Now let's board the boat and have a ride on the lake . 
 Wang , what's that building over there ? It looks like some sort of a huge pavilion . 
 Can I have this roll of film developed here ? 
 Here you are . 
 Regular will be fine . How long will it take ? 
 Good . I'll come back in the evening . 
 No problem . May I see your receipt , please ? 
 That's right . Now try on this one . It's size 41 . 
 Thank you for your entertaining me . 
 Excuse me , what business are you looking after in Germany ? 
 What arts and crafts are you interested in this time ? 
 Sure , I'll certainly help you do it . 
 I wasn't kidding before , OK , I'm fine now . 
 Yes . 
 What are you saying ? You are acting weird today . 
 Haha , very funny , but it doesn't make any sense to me . 
 Seriously , if we will adopt any animals , we'd gotta to talk to Daniel . 
 Hope so . 
 This is Jane , I'd like to speak to Mr.Wang , please . 
 When do you expect him back ? 
 Yes , thank you . When he gets back , please just let him know that jane called . And i need him to call me back . 
 Yes , he does . But i give it to you again . 5264453 6 
 Yes , thank you very much . 
 Good coming . 
 Never mind , come right in . I've almost finished . You always keep the room neat and tidy , I must say . It saves me a lot of work , but you should let me do it . 
 It's very considerate of you to do so . Do you have any laundry today ? 
 Let me have it , please . I'm taking some laundry downstairs anyway . 
 One second , please . ( a few seconds later , the receiver comes back and says ) Hello ? 
 I ’ m sorry . David is out to lunch right now . 
 Sure . Does he know where to call you ? 
 Ok , I will . 
 No problem . 
 Well , if I were you , I'd go on studying . 
 If I had chance again , I'd major in English . You're good at language . 
 You should take their advice . They know what's best for you . 
 But if you go to university , you'll still have time for fun . 
 And if you try to find a part-time job , you'll have some money too . 
 David , I am going for an interview tomorrow . It's an American company . Can you give me an idea of what the interviewer will ask ? 
 But they can see my resume . It's all in there . 
 Ok . What else ? 
 I see . What about the salary ? 
 Ok , thanks , David . You ’ Ve helped me a lot . 
 Do you enjoy going on dates ? 
 What's so fun about them ? 
 So you always have fun on dates ? 
 Why not ? 
 So then why would you ask them out in the first place ? 
 Sounds like a huge waste of time to me . 
 Hello , I would like to buy some business cards . 
 Two thousand would be fine . 
 All I want is the same thing on this card . 
 OK , I'm finished . Here's your form and my old card . 
 Do you think you could finish it in three days ? 
 Excuse me . 
 I've never used this place before.Can you give me some idea what I need to do ? 
 Yes , but ... well ... 
 How do I use the machines ? 
 I see . Do the machines have soap in them ? 
 No . I don't have soap . 
 Thanks.Okay . I have my soap . 
 I don't know . I want my clothes to be clean . 
 Oh . I guess I didn't know . I have never washed clothes before . 
 Yes . 
 No . Never . 
 I'm nineteen . 
 My mother always did it . 
 I know about this fact.American children are more independent . They do more for themselves.But I am from Taiwan . In Taiwan , children must study very hard.So the mother does everything for the kids.The mother wants her kids to get very good grades at school.So I've never washed clothes before . You shouldn't laugh at me for it . 
 What ? 
 I don't know . It's hard . But I have to learn . 
 Thanks . My name's Nick . 
 Thanks , Mom . Thanks . 
 Well done ! 
 Thank you . That way , PLS . 
 An attendant will pass them around after we take off . 
 No problem . Here are your headphones . Do you want something to drink ? 
 May I come in ? 
 I'm sorry to trouble you , but I'd like to ask when I will get a raise . 
 You said the same thing three months ago . 
 You mean that I won't get a raise until the recession ends ? 
 I got the message . I'm quiting . 
 I've been here for 3 years , and I haven't had a raise in all that time.If you like my work , it should be reflected in my pay , and I feel it isn't . 
 Very well , consider me gone . 
 I'm afraid Thera isn't any direct light before Friday . What about a non-direct one ? You have to make a change in Detroit . 
 Would you like to pay in cash or by card ? 
 How are you doing ? 
 What can I do for you today ? 
 Unfortunately , you will not be able to view it today . 
 You ’ ll need to make an appointment to view the apartment . 
 How does this Friday sound ? 
 That will be fine . 
 Hi , is you , John ? 
 Sorry , John . I suddenly got a severe stomachache last night , and stayed in hospital the whole day . 
 I know , I left it at home . 
 It's OK now . Don't worry , John . 
 No problem . How many are you thinking about ? 
 If you'll just fill out this form , please . 
 We can do that very easily . 
 Great . Your order will take only one week . 
 We can do that . It'll just cost you extra . 
 Yeah , I ’ m going to be running the Walker Avenue Branch . 
 Thanks . I appreciate it . 
 Yes . This is Janet Smith . I ’ d like to make an appointment with Dr . Mustn as soon as possible . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve got an infected wound . 
 That ’ s fine . 
 I ’ ll bring the card . Thank you very much . 
 We will have a vacation next month . Why not have a tour ? 
 What about going to Xi'an ? 
 So what's your plan ? 
 So we'll compromise . We'll hit the Huangshan in Anti . 
 Would you like some cake ? I made it myself . 
 Thanks . Would you like to have one more slice ? 
 Hi , United Airlines ? This is Elizabeth parks calling . I have a reservation on the 2:30 p . m . flight to Shanghai this afternoon . 
 Well , I ’ d like to reschedule my flight for the tomorrow morning one at 9:05 . Is that possible ? 
 Hello , Sir , may I help you ? 
 Very well , here are the general terms of our loan policies . We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans . 
 It depends on how long you take to pay it back . If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months , you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate . This of course is considering that you don ’ t default on a payment ! 
 That is a very serious problem you see , the bank must assess your personal information , past loans , assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan . 
 Excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the school clinic ? I've lost my way . 
 Straight ahead to the traffic lights , left and then right . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Good morning . I have a reservation for a single room with a bath here . 
 John Bradley . 
 Yes , can I borrow your pen for a minute please ? 
 What should I fill in under the room number ? 
 Here you are . I think I have filled out everything correctly . 
 Oct 24th . 
 Ok , I will take good care of it . 
 Yes , I am ready . Thank you . 
 I will try . 
 We are faced with the problem that part of the consignment is unacceptable . We assume that damage occurred during the consignment was in your care . 
 Why not ? 
 Would you ring these up for me here ? 
 Yes , I did , thanks . 
 No , I'll pay for it in cash . 
 An exporter needs to know the social characteristics of people he is dealing with . 
 What do they like or dislike . What languages do they speak , what religions do they follow . 
 Especially he needs to know their behavior , their habits , their way of life and the things they are used to . 
 You know who won the election , right ? 
 I couldn ’ t believe it , either . 
 I hope you voted for him . 
 I made sure to vote for him . 
 I know how you feel . 
 I know that he will . 
 Would you find any other available flight to Tokyo ? 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , of course . I think our travel agent would have made the reservation for us . 
 Are you sure ? We can't really take it ? I reconfirmed with Miss Peterson the other day . 
 Mrcrabby , I ’ m pleased to see you . 
 Oh , yes , I worked there for two years , just graduated from college . 
 It was a good company to work for , I enjoyed my time with them . 
 Yes , I like it very much , the work was not very demanding , and the people I work with were friendly . 
 Because it is an age of challenges , I must accept the new challenge in my life . 
 Yes , could you put me in the non-smoking section ? 
 If one's available , please . But not over the wing . 
 I really missed you a lot . 
 I don't understand why you haven't come to visit me . 
 Tell me what you've been up to . 
 I've been pretty busy myself . 
 I've just been working a lot . 
 I'm glad I did too . 
 I ’ m fine , thank you . 
 If I could , I would like to view the apartment sometime today . 
 Why is that ? 
 I would like to make one right now if I can . 
 Can we do it at 6 o ’ clock ? 
 All right . I ’ ll see you on Friday . 
 Yesterday . I was really sorry to see it end . The skiing was terrific ! 
 Sorry to hear that ! But I would definitely recommend this place ! 
 nothing special . how about you ? Are you used to the life here in the States ? 
 great ! 
 sounds interesting . Where did you get the idea ? 
 absolutely . that's because both of us have distinctive cultural features . 
 yes . this must be a huge difference . 
 sure . We tend to think that the slower on eats , the more polite one seems . 
 and we never sip or slurp the soup loudly . we quietly like little mouthfuls . 
 don't worry . i'm sure our etiquette will become a natural part of your behavior as time goes by . 
 You just ran a red light . 
 If you are staying here for a few days , we ’ d be delighted to see you at our factory . 
 Let us know when you are free . We ’ ll arrange the tour for you . 
 That ’ s for sure . You ’ ll know our products better after the visit . 
 How can I help you ? 
 Will that be all , sir ? 
 I'll have someone bring that up right away . How would you like to pay for the dinner ? 
 All right , sir . You should receive your dinner in about ten minutes . 
 This one is . I have another one that's furnished , but I'm not sure you'll like the furniture . 
 This building is only four years old . It was built with central air . 
 And I recently bought an American-style washer and dryer . Come and see . 
 It was great . I made some friends . 
 But the lessons this semester are a little bit hard . 
 S :: Welcome to Flash Foto.What can I do for you , ma ’ am ? 
 S :: What size prints would you like ? 
 S :: All right , ma ’ am , they ’ ll be ready for you in an hour . 
 No , I shouldn't think so . But you must take your passport of course . 
 Yes , you need the traveler's check but you needn't get any foreign currency . You can have my US Dollars , I don't need them . 
 You needn't buy one . You can have mine . 
 Don't be silly , John . I'm going with you . It's necessary for me to have a holiday too . 
 You will visit the Hyde Park , Poet's Corner , Tower of London , Fleet Street and Tower Bridge . 
 I think you will enjoy your journey . 
 I'll see what I have got . What's it for ? 
 I can let you have some silvers if that is good . 
 Welcome to the company . We are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company . 
 Yes , flextime has definitely been a good change for us . How do you feel about the pay ? 
 But there is a big bonus for employees at the end of the probation period . 
 One thing you can be sure of your manager will be quite fair . If your job performance is up to par , you shouldn't be afraid of a performance review , 
 Excuse me . Can I deposit valuables here ? 
 OK . 
 Till next Monday when we check out . 
 Do you have your own circle of friends ? 
 What you said was right , but we need to work as a team , how could you make adjustment to that ? 
 OK , I got it . 
 Sure . It's the third office down this hall . Are you looking for Bob ? 
 I'm sorry , but he's not in the office now . Do you have an appointment ? 
 Yes . What time did he expect you ? 
 I see . He's usually here on Tuesday mornings ... 
 I know . He's usually here , but today he went out to a site on the east side . 
 Why don't you make an appointment for later in the week ? 
 He's here on Tuesdays , Wednesdays and Fridays . What day did you want to see him ? 
 Morning or afternoon ? 
 I can put you down for ten o'clock . Is that alright ? 
 Alright . I have you down for ten AM this Friday . 
 You are welcome . 
 Come on , John . This is my favorite show . 
 I'm sorry , I'm engaged at 2 p . m . 
 Sorry , the whole afternoon is filled up here.Will tomorrow do ? 
 We should know by next month whom to hire . If your application is successful , we'll notify you by mail . 
 We'll give you our decision in 7 days . 
 Please send the next candidate in on your way out . 
 Right Rebecca . Now I see that after graduating from University your first job was ... 
 Certainly . And after your internship ? 
 Yes I see . But you decided to leave them in 2006 , right ? 
 The London Weekly right ? 
 morning , Mr . Winthrop . This is Sally Parker , Mr . Emory ’ s secretary . Mr . Emory has asked me to set up a meeting with you . 
 I understand . Would you like me to call you back ? 
 Can I ask for leave this afternoon ? 
 I had a headache this morning . I didn ’ t pay attention to it . I thought probably it is because I didn ’ t sleep well . But now it is getting worse and worse . I feel quite dizzy now and my eyes are somehow very light-sensitive . Maybe it is the migrated . 
 Thank you very much . I am sure good rest will do indeed . I don ’ t have this too often . 
 Sure . Where should I put this cup ? 
 The red one . 
 How about this fruit ? 
 And those pencils ? What should I do with them ? 
 How about this pen ? 
 What do you want me to do with that paper over there ? 
 The trash is full . 
 OK . Now what ? 
 Sure . 
 Good morning . I ’ d like to book a room for Friday night and Saturday night . 
 A single room please . I hope you ’ re not fully booked . 
 Jones . According to your website , the nightly rate is $ 50 , including breakfast . 
 Thank you very much . I look forward to seeing you on Friday . 
 That ’ s fine . My credit card number is ... 
 By all means . (= Of course . ) 
 Which subway should I take to get to the East Side ? 
 Which train is that ? Which platform does it leave from ? 
 I have to use the ATM . 
 I don ’ t know how to use it . 
 I have never used an ATM before . 
 How do I use it ? 
 What ’ s next ? 
 What else do I have to do ? 
 Mr . Emory ? I think it ’ s time to get a new computer . 
 For the amount of work we do on the computer these days , the one we ’ re using is just too weak . We really need a higher model . 
 What do you think ? 
 I would like to purchase it . 
 Here , take my credit card . 
 Sure . Here you go . 
 What are you doing , karen ? 
 What do we need ? 
 What about vegetables ? 
 Have we got any beer and wine ? 
 I hope that you've got some money . 
 Well , I haven't got much either ! 
 I'm not exactly sure if it's your department , but I'd like to ask some questions about qualifying for Comprehensive Credit Granting . 
 How long a period will you look at to determine this ? 
 That sounds simple enough . It's Friday today , I'll be back on Monday morning , first thing , with all of the relevant data . See you then , and enjoy your weekend . 
 How should I get their contact info . 
 Where should I put them up ? 
 The clients like the Shangri-La Hotel more . 
 What else would I prepare , Sir ? 
 Certainly . 
 Of course . I'm on it 
 Checking out time is twelve . Guests will avoid an additional days room charge by checking out on time . 
 We won't charge any extra if you'd vacate the room by two o'clock . 
 Yes . We can put it in our storage room . 
 There will be no charge on baggage left by guests who have checked out . 
 I want to buy a wallet . 
 May I pick it up ? 
 Do you have one of better quality ? 
 There is no problem about the price . How much is it ? 
 OK , I'll take it . 
 Thank you . I was operated on for gastric ulcer . 
 Yes . I hope so . 
 This is Denise , Mr . Bruce ’ s Secretary . I was calling to confirm his meeting tomorrow with Mr . Dome at 4 o ’ clock . 
 Is your address still 1150 Lake Road ? 
 Ok . Thank you . 
 To be honest , I was just dumped . 
 No , thanks . I'm not in the mood for traveling . 
 I was planning on doing a lot of wallowing . 
 Where is that ? 
 What's there to see ? 
 Oh , sounds nice . 
 Ok . Then I can make up my mind . 
 I would like to return an item . 
 I want to return this cellphone . 
 It's broken . 
 The phone turns off by itself . 
 Yes , here it is . 
 Thank you so much . 
 We're going over to Mrs . Smith's place to help her with her yard work . 
 It will be fun . And besides , you'll be in the best company . 
 You could get the rakes and some shovels together and I'll put them in the car . 
 Yes and maybe a jacket in case it gets cool . 
 I know , Mr . Douglas . But I am really sick . 
 I understand , sir . I ’ ll bring a doctor ’ s note in tomorrow . I am sorry , Mr . Douglas . 
 I'm so sorry . Kindly tell me what the problem is , sir . 
 Perhaps you could look again , sir , to double-check . 
 Mr . Sandals , I've worked here five years without seeing one cockroach . 
 You're right , sir . Please let me transfer you to my supervisor 
 Thanks . 
 My sister did it . When did you get yours cut ? 
 Well , it looks very nice . 
 How did you get the piano here ? 
 You never did it on your own . 
 Would you mind helping us take a picture ? 
 Just focus on us and press the button . 
 Where shall we go on vacation this summer ? 
 Venice . I have great interests in the boats . 
 I like the country too . It's quite famous for its culture . 
 Needless to say , it must be Indian Yoga . 
 Tracing back , Yoga has a very long history . It was originated before India had approved Yoga and these documents were arranged and written according to the contents passed by mouth to mouth . In other words , Yoga is passed down from ancient times , which cannot be recalled . 
 Let me see ... I am sorry the tables you want are booked . 
 No problem , sir . Let me help you . 
 I know , I should wash them right away . 
 Sure . Show me your receipt , please . 
 Wait a moment . Here is $ 10 you paid for duties . 
 I'd like to buy some perfume for my girlfriend . 
 She usually doesn't wear anything but a few drops of Chanel No . 5 . But I'd like to buy her a new Fragrance . 
 Which one would you recommend ? 
 That smells great . I'll take one bottle , please . 
 It's OK . She normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder , and I don't know what shade to buy . 
 She doesn't usually wear lipstick . She thinks it makes her nose look too big . 
 No , thank you . She has big enough eyes as it is . 
 No thanks . Western women usually try to make their skin darker , not lighter . 
 That will be all . You've been very helpful , thanks . 
 Getting worse . Now he ’ s eating me out of house and home . I ’ Ve tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out the other . He makes himself at home , which is fine . But what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and I had company over ! That was the last straw . 
 You ’ re right . Everything is probably going to come to a head tonight . I ’ ll keep you informed . 
 Yes . The light in this room is too dim . Please get me a brighter one . 
 Oh , no . Go ahead . 
 It's much better now . Thank you . 
 Ah , yes , the room is too cold for me . I feel rather cold when I sleep . Can you turn off the air-conditioning ? 
 Maybe I'm getting a cold . 
 OK . And would you please get me some hot water , too ? I think I need to take some medicine . 
 No , thanks . 
 May I help you ? 
 Alright . Do you have your receipt ? 
 And why are you returning them ? 
 I see . Oh , wait . Ma'am , I'm sorry . These slacks were on sale . 
 I'm sorry , but we don't allow returns on sale items . 
 I'm sorry , but we usually don't do it . It is our policy . 
 Well . Let me talk to the manager for a moment.Ma ' am , the manager says I can do it this time . 
 Please show me your receipt again . 
 I will have to give you store credit , Ma'am . If you find something else you like in the store , you can use the credit . 
 We appreciate your business , Ma'am . 
 it certainly was a great party . It ’ s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here . 
 I doubt it , I ‘ ll deal with it right away . Luckily it wasn ’ t a glass of red wine , I ’ ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth . 
 afterwards , we can do the washing up together . Everything will be finished within an hour . Your friend Keith is really funny . I liked his magic tricks . 
 Amanda told some very funny jokes . At the beginning of the party , she was being ver serious . 
 what did you put in that punch ? It tasted great , but was quite strong . 
 very much . The birthday cake was delicious , wasn ’ t it ? Emily told me that she and karen made it themselves . 
 all cleaned up . Are you ready to start on the washing up . 
 Well , I got $ 3,000 per month . 
 Yes , I think so . That would be more than I have wished . 
 What about early next week ? 
 Yes , sir . 
 We work in teams . There are about four to six people in each team . I'm training to be a team leader . Each team member is responsible for the quality of the goods we produce . We are multi-skilled so we can rotate jobs . I like that . It stops the work getting boring . 
 Well . I am afraid you have made a mistake . It's not the dish I ordered . 
 It doesn't matter . 
 Well , it's a bit overweight . You must pay extra for it . 
 We demand a surcharge of 80 cents for it . 
 You haven't told me anything yet . 
 Is that right ? 
 Congratulations on your promotion . 
 I am really excited for you . 
 I'm serious . You deserved this promotion . 
 Yes , I do . 
 Have you got anything cheaper ? 
 May I try it on ? 
 All right . I think I'll take it . 
 Yes , you are supposed to meet the president at ten fifteen this morning . Then , you have a lunch appointment with Mr . Clark . And this afternoon at three you are scheduled to speak before a group of seminar participants . 
 Certainly . 
 Sure . 
 You mean the seventy seventh ? It's not far from here . You can walk there . 
 Bus No . 12 . 
 Where to , madam ? 
 I think you'll make it if we don't get stuck in a traffic jam . 
 Thank you . How much is the fare ? 
 Here you are . Keep the change . 
 May I see your passport please ? 
 Are you travelling for business or pleasure ? 
 Do you have anything to declare ? Jewellery or cash ? 
 Did you bring any fruits , vegetables , fresh meats or plants into this country ? 
 Why weren't you at school yesterday ? 
 What was wrong with you ? 
 Do you feel better now ? 
 Do you want anything to make you feel better ? 
 I hope you feel better . 
 You're going to have coffee , aren't you ? 
 Are you going to have anything to eat ? 
 I'll have that too . 
 Yes , sir . How may I be of service ? 
 Certainly . The customer is always right , we are here to serve you . Is there a reason that you would like to return it ? Did you have problems with our product or services ? 
 Would you be interested in an exchange as opposed to a refund ? I think I can help you to find the appropriate size . 
 Sure , no problem . Do you happen to have the receipt ? 
 Ok , just a moment , please . Here you are , I need you to sign here , please . And here is your refund . Is there anything else I can help you with ? 
 You're welcome . Have a nice day ! 
 Of course . We both experienced a good cooperation . 
 I would like to return this pair of shoes . 
 Here it is . 
 Oh , but this pair of shoes are a bit too tight . Could I change them for something bigger ? 
 Out of every movie that you've seen , which one is your favorite ? 
 You think so , how come ? 
 You're not lying , I found that movie absolutely hilarious . 
 I made sure to be in line to see it the first day it came out . 
 I was laughing hysterically the whole time ; my stomach muscles hurt afterwards . 
 I got the movie when it came out on DVD , do you want to come over ? 
 Good evening , sir . 
 Certainly . Oh , you have a message here . 
 No , there isn't at the moment . 
 Our reservation is under the name of Foster at 7:00 for four people . 
 We would like to begin with a cocktail while we are waiting . Would you tell the hostess to please come and let us know when our table is ready ? 
 The patio tables look really nice . Could we be seated there , please ? 
 Thanks ! We'll sit out there then . We will just order our drinks out there . 
 Yes , why don't you bring us a bottle of the house Chablis with four glasses to start with ? 
 We appreciate your help . 
 I don't think that will do . How about the one at your back ? 
 No , the other one ... yes . 
 It do look beautiful . Well . I think I'll take it.Now do you have any racket covers ? 
 How much does it come up to ? 
 Do you accept credit cards ? 
 Which way is the dining car ? 
 What time will breakfast be served ? 
 It's a lot of work running a campaign , isn't it ! 
 Hang in there . The hardest part is just about over . 
 About 15 . I've seen him work hard for a lot of good changes . 
 Did you know we're trying to talk him into considering a presidential campaign ? 
 Hi , this is Quipu Corp . Is that Miss Zhang ? 
 I am calling to tell you the items you are supposed to bring for the interview the day after tomorrow . 
 You'd better bring the diploma , identification card and several copies of your resume . 
 I'll give you the boxes . You can then go to our gift-wrapping department . 
 It's on the first floor , to the right of the main entrance . 
 Have a nice holiday ! 
 I learned of the railway accident only this morning . 
 Is that true ? 
 Thanks . 
 Yes , will you keep our bags until 6 p . m . ? 
 Yes , we checked out just now . 
 Is this all right ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 I want my hair cut . 
 I'm not sure . What do you suggest ? 
 I don't like it . It's outdated . 
 It seems a little too wild . 
 I want a haircut just like that kind . 
 How do you like you dishes today ? 
 I am sorry for that . We will improve the dishes next time . 
 Sure . We've helped more than ten thousand people buy and sell houses . We're the No . 1 realtor in this community . I recommend this house ( He points at a picture ) . 
 On a hill to the east of the Tarsus river . You have a good view of the beautiful sunrise and sunset . You can't find a better home to live in . 
 Eight rooms , a roomy kitchen , two modem bathrooms , a lovely dining room , a gorgeous living room and three sweet bedrooms . All are built with first-rate materials .

 At 10:30 . 
 Yes , it is . 
 Single or return ? 
 10 pounds . 
 It's platform 5 . 
 You are welcome . 
 That's great . You need to prepare for it . 
 Buy an expensive suit . 
 Yeah , fine . And dressing leather shoes . 
 That means they have tapered legs . 
 Mine are , too . 
 Yeah . Let's just lounge around ! 
 Good morning . This is Dan . Could I speak to Nova ? 
 Really ? When will she come back ? 
 Well , the reason why I am calling is to tell her that our appointment in next month will have to be postponed . And the exact time for this meeting will be discussed after she comes back . 
 The file for the meeting needs to be retyped and please send it to us as soon as possible . 
 Excuse me , I wonder if you can help me . 
 I'm completely lost . I'm looking for the Empire State Building . 
 Great . Thanks a lot . 
 I don't care . 
 Yes , I'm calling from Tenga Company . I'd like to know if you have rooms available for the nights from October 8 to October 12 . We are going to have a business conference . 
 20 persons . 
 Double rooms with twin beds . 
 Thank you . Is there a special rate for a group reservation ? 
 That is fine . 
 Are you aware that you ran through that stop sign ? 
 How could you not notice it ? 
 You know.You ' re right . The bushes are covering the sign . 
 Now that I think about it , I can see how you missed it . 
 I'll let you off with a warning . 
 Don't worry about it . I need to have something done about those bushes . 
 I need to know about the fees . 
 I ’ m asking about overdraft fees . 
 What ’ s the fee ? 
 How is that a small fee ? 
 I ’ ll say . 
 I don ’ t need to know anything else . Thank you . 
 Yes , but now we are fresh out of staff quarters . 
 The company will assign you housing subsidies at 400 yuan a month . 
 Yes , please . I'm looking for a sofa . 
 May it be used as a sofa in the day and a bed during the night ? 
 I would like to book a table for 2 . 
 7:00 tonight and we'd like a smoking table . 
 We need to do a group report tomorrow . I need to go to the stationer to buy something for the posters . 
 absolutely . Every time when we do the reports , we love making some beautiful posters to emphasize our theme ideas . 
 No problem . I need some markers , some color pencils , a pair of scissors , some highlighter , rulers .. 
 Don't worry.In fact , it is very easy to find what you want . Can you see the sign on top of every shelf . It clearly tells you what things are displayed on every shelf . 
 I also need some thumbtacks , whiteout and paper clips . Which shelf are they on ? I can't find the number . 
 Oh , you can rest assured that they'll be no problem . 
 Your upstairs neighbors live in Canada and rarely come back to Taiwan . When they do , they're never home . 
 Two flight attendants that are also in and out of town . When they're here , they're usually sleeping . And next door to you is me . I'm a quiet neighbor . 
 Susan , can you tell me in a nutshell what the retail market is like in China ? 
 Retail is going upscale here ? China is certainly growing more quickly than I had imagined . 
 Do you think the trend will continue ? 
 Everything I've seen so far is very impressive , very impressive indeed . 
 I usee I would say that would be moving out of my parents ’ house for the first time . 
 Till I moved out of my parents ’ home , I became a lot more independent . 
 That would definitely be getting a divorce . 
 We just weren't right for each other . 
 The marriage only lasted about a year . 
 Yes , I got married to a man that I met shortly after I divorced my first husband . 
 Oh I hope not , my first marriage was a mistake , but this one isn ’ t . 
 About 15 years now . 
 I think so , hopefully we ’ ll have a long and a happy life together . 
 Would you please bring us the check ? 
 Does that include the service charge ? 
 Here you are . Keep the change . 
 Everything about them was different , even the theaters . 
 Well , where I grew up , we saw movies at a drive-in theater in our car with the whole family . 
 We did . On hot days , we'd take a blanket and lay in the back of dad's old pickup to watch the movie . 
 Well , the weather might have some influence , during bad weather the theater didn't make a whole lot . 
 Do you have any blue shirts ? 
 I'm not familiar with American size . 
 It's pretty . May I try it on ? 
 Thank you . 
 Yes . One more is needed . 
 But do you have any experience like that ? 
 OK.Then I want to ask you some questions about the tourist guide.If there wasn accident , for example a tourist falls ill , what would you do ? 
 If one of them forgot a camera in a restaurant , would you let the tourist bus go back ? 
 Well , it seems that you have all the practical experience to handle these cases . I am very glad to welcome you into our company . 
 Are you going to vote ? 
 Do you know who you ’ re going to vote for ? 
 What ’ s so great about him ? 
 Oh , really ? 
 That ’ s good to hear . 
 I hope so . 
 Can you give me a hand ? 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 This one is the latest . How do you like it ? 
 Sure . 
 I'd like to make an appointment with manager Mr.Wu . Would 10:00 a . m . tomorrow be all right ? 
 Could I possibly make it early in the afternoon ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Let me see . Roll up your sleeve , please . Um ... it's swollen and red here . I'm afraid we'll need to take an X-ray to see if it's broken . 
 Then we'll put you in a cast . 
 Well , we apply tape and plaster to from a solid enclosure to protect the bones from moving . In this way they will heal properly . Take it easy . It won't hurt you . Let me see . The X-ray picture indicates that your humerus is broken in two places . And you'll have to wear the cast for three weeks . You'll need to come back in two weeks , so I can have another look . 
 Thank you . I ’ Ve worked pretty hard to be able to list those accomplishments . 
 To be honest , I don ’ t plan in that much detail . My goals tend to be general ; I define success according to the job at hand . I see myself advancing as I succeed , but I don ’ t necessarily dwell on 
 That depends a bit on the problem at hand . There are certain situations in which a manager can give a general directive , and expect his employees to know how to take the initiative on the detail 
 I see myself as an encourager . Of course , sales can be quite competitive and sometimes people in this field have a secret desire for others to fail . In my last job , each representative handled 
 What's holding us back on the plant expansion project ? We were supposed to see the specs on that ages ago.Why haven't I heard anything about it ? Did the whole project just vanish into thin air ? 
 You're joking , right ? No wonder we've been tied up with this project . I know the environmental impact statement will take forever to get approval if they've found anything endangered on the site . Are they positive there is evidence of endangered species actually living there ? 
 Could I meet with you to discuss the project ? 
 Tuesday would be good for me . 
 I think the afternoon would be best . 
 Yes , I will bring my plans with me to the meeting . 
 I feel that the whole committee needs to be there . 
 Yes , I know how to get there on my own . 
 How many parking tickets have you gotten before ? 
 How many ? 
 Have you paid off your parking tickets ? 
 How much do you have to pay for the ticket ? 
 That's a lot of money . 
 Well , you better make sure you pay it off . 
 Good afternoon.Welcome to China.May I see your passport , customs and health declaration form ? 
 Thank you.What ' s your occupation , Mr . Smith ? 
 You are here on business , aren't you ? 
 I see.Do you have anything to declare ? 
 Would you please fill out this currency declaration form ? It's a record of the foreign currency you have brough in . 
 Good evening . 
 Let me see . Yes , we have one room left . You're lucky . It's the last one . 
 This room has two double beds . It's number 56 at the rear of the motel . It's quite a comfortable room . 
 It's forty-five dollars a night for two . Is anyone else traveling with you ? 
 Would you like to pay for the room in cash or with a credit card ? 
 Please fill out this registration card . Here is your key . You can park your car in front of our room.Check - out time is noon . 
 Thank you , sir . Enjoy your stay with us . 
 I want a chemise . 
 Could I try it on ? 
 Well . It's not my taste . Would you please bring me a short sleeve ? 
 Yes , May I help you ? 
 we are very sorry to cause you a lot of inconvenience . 
 We're rather busy right now . It will take another 15minutes 
 I'm afraid it will take 15 minutes at most . 
 I want some envelopes please . 
 The large size please . Do Have you any writing-paper ? 
 Yes , please . And I want some glue . 
 And I want a large box of chalk , too . 
 No , thank you . 
 That's all , thank you . 
 I want my change . 
 Do you remember when and where you last saw it ? 
 Could you please tell me your passport number ? 
 And what is the expiration date on your passport ? 
 I see . Please fill out this form . And you need to contact your embassy or consulate to report it as soon as possible . 
 I'm very delighted too . I'm sure that we'll have a wider range of cooperation . So , let's drink to the signing of our contract . 
 Cheers . 
 Better take the subway . It's far quicker and more convenient . 
 We have a rather comprehensive subway system here . You can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway , especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy . 
 Just give the man sitting there three yuan and he'll give you a ticket . 
 No , you don't have to . Here comes the train . Be careful ! Subway doors open and close automatically . 
 I'd like to choose one game for myself and one for my younger sister . 
 Big games of course . 
 Type ? I don't know , what do you have ? 
 Well , I am a beginner . I ... 
 I like first person shooting and action more than other types of games . 
 Oh , thanks a lot . Then , I will take the two . 
 I will have the latest editions . 
 No , thanks . I've really got to go now . 
 You , too . 
 Let me see . Yes , we still have four left . 
 How long would you stay ? 
 May I take your order now ? 
 Certainly . I would recommend ' Songshuguiyu ' . 
 Well , it is sweet and sour fried Mandarin fish . 
 Then , how about this one ? 
 Very good . Could I serve you anything else ? 
 My pleasure . Just a little while , your order will be ready very soon . Please enjoy your lunch . 
 Front desk , can I help you ? 
 Sure . Your room number , PLS ? 
 Room 1019 , tomorrow at seven thirty . Ok , we will give you a call in the morning . 
 If I hear " Love Me Tender " one more time , I think I'm going to go crazy ! 
 Can we adjust the pitch a little ? Maybe he'll sound better in a higher key . 
 Hey ! Where are you going ... ? 
 Fine . How many people are there in your party ? 
 $ 200 for double . 
 I am afraid not . Right now it's the tour season . 
 Can you repair my shoes ? 
 Really ? Look at the toe of this shoe . It is worn out . 
 Can you do it ? 
 What are you calling about today ? 
 Is there a problem ? 
 That shouldn't be a problem . 
 So , you want it delivered the day after tomorrow ? 
 What time would you like us to deliver it ? 
 Your delivery has been confirmed . 
 Hi , I'm here to look at the one-bedroom apartment you have for rent . 
 ( They walk over to the apartment . ) As you can see , it's large and completely furnished . 
 You have to pay the electricity bill yourself , but water is paid . 
 I'm sorry to interrupt you . Please take care not to make a mess while you are selecting goods . If you don't want it , please replace it . 
 What's the brand ? 
 Oh , it's out of stock at the moment . Why don't you choose another brand instead ? 
 You can have a try . Maybe you will like it . 
 Did your eye doctor prescribe you contact lenses ? 
 Oh , I see . We have both hard and soft contact lenses . They are very popular , but a little more expensive than ordinary glasses . 
 We have many kinds of glasses here . Which frames do you like best ? 
 What about this pair ? They are the ' in ' things now in optical wear . Try them on . 
 Please go to receive optometry first over there . 
 Go to gate 18 . The plane is now boarding . You must hurry . 
 Instead of walking , you can take this shuttle to get you there faster . 
 No , I ’ ll call the attendants at the gate . I will tell them you ’ re on your way . 
 You are welcome . Have a safe trip . 
 I will . Will you be voting ? 
 You don ’ t know that ? 
 It ’ s this Tuesday . 
 Why would I joke ? 
 You should ’ Ve known already . 
 As long as you go vote , that ’ s all that matters . 
 Hello , I would like to make a reservation for four nights next week , from Tuesday to Friday . 
 Single room with a bath room , please . I would like a room with a view of the whole city . 
 What's the rate , please ? 
 Does that include breakfast ? Can I make calls on outside line ? 
 OK , that's fine . Could you hold it for me ? 
 Good morning . I ’ d like to ask some questions about your insurance policies . 
 I bought a house recently and would like to insure it and its content . 
 I understand . I live in the Oakfield area and paid $ 100,000 for my home . 
 In this pamphlet it says that the minimum amount for deductibles is $ 2000 . what does that mean exactly ? 
 Oh , I see . That ’ s fine . What is the advantage of having higher deductibles ? 
 It seems that I should do some calculations before deciding . I presume that the insurance period can be for as long as we agree . 
 If I have a claim , how long does it take to make a settlement ? I ’ Ve heard that with some insurance companies , it can take months . 
 Come on , Jenny , we are heading our way to the Opera House . 
 Oh , I am sorry , I thought you were not . 
 Fine . Actually I am a little tired too . Want some water ? 
 She ’ s not at her desk at the moment . Is there any message I can give her ? 
 Ok . I ’ ll let her know as soon as possible . 
 Hey , John ! What do you think are the main causes of war today ? 
 Yeah , several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end . 
 I don't think that there is any easy way . 
 Yeah , you are right ! 
 Yes , but it's quite a ways . 
 This bus doesn't take you directly there . You'd have to change buses twice . I suggest you walk . It'll take you less than 20 minutes . 
 Go straight ahead through the intersection . 
 Keep walking till you pass the square , then turn right . Walk past two lights and turn left at the third . 
 Keep walking and look for a tall building . 
 The right side . ICCC should be on the first floor . 
 You're welcome . 
 I go to the personnel market every day , and put a lot of energy into it . 
 On the Internet ? I have never tried that way . 
 So how to apply for a job on the Internet ? 
 But how can I know which employer is hiring ? 
 Will the employers see my information ? 
 Is it safe to job hunt on the Internet ? 
 I will give it a try at once . 
 I can't help it . 
 It's a bit of a problem situation , actually ... you see , our company has a Corporate Account with you , but unfortunately , we've been experiencing cash flow problems recently . 
 We are going to need a loan . I'm not sure what loan is suitable for us , though . 
 That seems like a good idea , it's for wages , you see . 
 Sure . Kind acknowledgments can show one's good attainment . 
 Actually , that's not true . Acknowledgments can help you leave a good impression on others , especially in the public places . 
 In the beginning of the interview , it is best that you make acknowledgments for the opportunity of the interview . 
 Make acknowledgments as well when the interviewer thinks highly of your dressing , experience , or words . 
 Acknowledgments can also help the job-hunters to show their good attainment . 
 Smiles and kind attitudes are the basics of acknowledgments . 
 Would you have my baggage sent up , please ? 
 Thank you very much . This is for your help . 
 Have you taken your driving test yet ? 
 Okay , first I'm going to need you to fill out the paperwork . 
 You'll have to make an appointment for that . 
 How does Friday sound ? 
 What time would you like to take the test ? 
 Eleven o'clock on Friday morning . See you then . 
 Yes , can I see a few T-shirts , Please ? 
 I'm not very particular about the design.But I want something of good quality . 
 What's the weather forecast for today ? 
 Any rain ? 
 I wouldn't either . It's been looking like rain for several days . 
 I thought you were supposed to put them in some kind of burner with a candle ... 
 So what's your illness ... shopping fever , sale-itis ? 
 What's tomorrow ? 
 Mom , Happy mother's Day ! Here's my card . 
 Thank you for your love and care over the years , I appreciate it , mom . 
 Mom , what can I do for you today ? 
 How about dinner tonight ? My treat . 
 I'm sorry I haven't dropped in that much these past few years.Business kept me too busy , I apologize . 
 Thank you , mom . I love you so much ! 
 Hello , yes , I ’ d like to open a bank account . 
 What features do they offer ? 
 I see , well , I think I ’ m more interested in a chequing account . I like to have easy access to my money . 
 No , that won ’ t be necessary . 
 Yes , I ’ d like to deposit one billion dollars . 
 Mike , this is Leo in Sales . I was just calling to confirm our meeting tomorrow.Are we still on ? 
 OK . See you at your office at 2:30 . 
 Help ! I'm about to drop these books . 
 Thanks ! 
 Ok , every one asks their parents let them stay out until 2 or 3 in the morning . 
 That ’ s absurd . I know some junior high kids who can stay out later than that . 
 Ok , how about midnight curfew . and I'll let you know where I am . 
 My daughter . She is missing . I don ’ t know where she is . 
 She has blond hair and blue eyes . 
 She has a yellow dress on and red sneakers . 
 I just saw her down the street . I don ’ t know where she is . I don ’ t know ... 
 Oh , it ’ s been uh ... fifteen minutes . 
 Are you working fewer hours than you used to work ? 
 You usually qualify if you got laid off or are working a lot fewer hours . 
 Most jobs provide unemployment , but some don ’ t . 
 You can call your unemployment office , and they can check for you . 
 There is a formula to determine the amount based on how much you earned . They will let you know when you file your claim . 
 Oh , very beautiful . Thank you , Steven , I like it very much . 
 My birthday present ? I can't help telling you that I am a happy woman , darling . I will come back soon . ( Go to her bedroom and wear the new dress , then show it to Steven . ) 
 It displays your slender figure , darling . 
 Because you are my dear wife . 
 I am studying at Beijing University . I major in Civil Law . 
 Because Beijing University is the best university in China and I'm sure I am one of the best students . 
 I have learned many courses , such as Civil Law , Economic Law , Commercial Law and Administration Law . 
 Civil Law . Because it is broad and profound , and furthermore , it best reflects the spirits of fairness and equality . 
 Psychology . 
 Why ? 
 I'm very sorry for that , but I sent you several messages to explain , my mom was seriously ill , and I had to look afer her . 
 That girl was my cousin . 
 I didn't take my cellphone with me at that time . 
 I know you don't hear me right know , please calm down . Anyway , I don't wanna part . I'll drop by tomorrow . 
 Welcome to IBA . What can we assist you with today ? 
 This scheme has just started and you will be one of our first 100 customers , so if your application is accepted , you will receive some rather nice perks .

 Don ’ t you think it needs about a little taken off and talk to . 
 About like this ? 
 Shave also , Sir . 
 How do you want to your mustache trimmed ? 
 You're right . I think it's going to rain later . 
 That wouldn't seem right . 
 Exactly , it wouldn't be nice if it started raining . It's too hot . 
 I wish it would cool off one day . 
 I enjoy the winter , but it gets really cold sometimes . 
 That's exactly how I feel . 
 I thought that I already told you that I am going with Mark to Alaska . 
 You know what ? You and I had no plans , so I made plans with Mark . What's the problem ? 
 I don't think that I ever heard of that rule before . Any more rules that you would like to tell me about ? 
 I am really looking forward to getting away from you . Far away from you ! 
 Well ... I'm pretty busy . but ... all right . come in . What can I do for you ? 
 Not at all . Take a seat . Now , what can I do for you ? 
 Yes , but why should you want to do that ? 
 Not at all . Go ahead . 
 Yes . I'd delighted if you did . 
 SW113 leaves at 13:25 . Would you want one ?

 Do you mind if I open the window ? 
 Oh , that's too bad . Should I call a doctor ? 
 OK . 
 No . 
 Of course not.There are so many people here today . 
 Does this bus go to Fisherman's Wharf ? 
 Oh , good . Transfer , please .

 As a matter of fact , I'm from Taiwan . 
 I will . Thanks . 
 Please forgive me just being frankly , madam . You don't need whitening products because you look pretty white . But you have freckles on your face .

 The price varies somewhat according to the size of your order . Would you tell us the quantity you want so that we can work out an offer ? 
 It's our pleasure to do business with you . We'll let you have the offer next Wednesday at the latest . 
 That looks like a bad accident . 
 No , there ’ s a police car behind us . He ’ ll stop . 
 Yeah . It ’ s pretty bad , that car looks like a coke can . 
 Yeah , it looks like we ’ re in for a long drive . 
 All right . 
 Oh , is it ? Let me check . 
 I'm sorry to say that this room service charge is yours .

 Yes , well Miss Childs did give mean overview of the position over the phone , but there were some details I ’ d like to clarify . 
 Could I first ask about the remuneration package ? 
 I understand . And are there other bonuses included ? 
 Well , Mr . Parsons , I am flexible when it comes to salary . The opportunity to work in Hong Kong for you is the most important thing for me . 
 Small world , isn't it ? 
 I never imagined meeting you here . 
 How are things with you ? 
 How may I help you ? 
 Will you be depositing cash or a check ? 
 How much would you like to deposit ? 
 What account would you like to deposit that into ? 
 Can I do anything else for you today ? 
 Ladies and gentlemen , our flight will be delayed for one hour due to the congestion of the airport .

 Consumer Credit Department . How may I help you ? 
 Certainly . Do you currently bank with us ? 
 That's excellent . Well , for our Personal Automobile Consumer Loan we offer some really competitive rates . The maximum repayment period for this type of loan is 5 years . 
 Of course , the interest rates depend on what is announced at the time , but at the moment , the interest for a 2 - year loan is 5.29 % 
 We usually set up a direct debit system taking installments directly from your bank account on a monthly basis . And since you are already a valued customer , there should be no trouble in processing you application for this loan . 
 Hey , Ken ... I need to talk to you . 
 Can we step into the conference room ? This is a more private conversation . 
 Ok ... I'm just going to lay it all out on the table , What do you think of Vincent's management style ? 
 I don't want to put you on the spot . Here's what I'm getting at , I don't think Vincent is the man for the job . 
 As I see it , he lacks the proper vision . His style is more about survival , and he's not taking the company anywhere.He ' s treading water instead of swimming . 
 I've been with this firm for 26 years and I'd hate to see it go down the drain due to poor leadership skills . 
 Yes and no ... We can't ask for a show of hands on who thinks he should be fired , but we can introduce a vote of no confidence at the next board meeting . 
 I come to try my new suit . Here's the receipt . 
 Aren't the trousers a little too long ? 
 Very well . Thank you . 
 Good coming , sir . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 You've come to the right place.We ' Ve got the best shoes in town . 
 I changed my diet recently , and I eat a lot healthier now . 
 My diet consists mainly of fruits , veggies , and chicken . 
 Just about . 
 You know that fruits and vegetables are very healthy foods ? 
 I bake chicken because it's a healthy way to eat it . 
 You should try it . You won't be disappointed . 
 You need to fill out a special form to apply for unemployment benefits . 
 You can call the Employment Development Office and request a form . 
 Be prepared to provide your employer ’ s name and address and what dates you worked . 
 You need to be prepared to show that your unemployment is not your fault . If you have a termination notice , that would be great . 
 The Employment Development Office will call you for an interview . 
 I'm going to check out tomorrow but will be back in a week's time . Can I leave my luggage here ? 
 About nine-thirty in the morning . 
 Sure . 
 1218 .

 Hi . I ’ m here for flight 513 to New York but I thought I heard the paging system announce that it is canceled . Is that true ? 
 No way ! I worked very hard so that I could leave on today ’ s flight . Are there seats on another airline ?

 Have you got any certificate of technical qualification ? 
 How long did it take you to get your driver's license ?

 Well , the first thing on my list is a new blender . I decided to also get a juicer and a new coffee maker . 
 Yeah I know . I also decided to throw away the old toaster and get a new one . I am also getting a rice cooker and steamer to make some nice steamed fish or veggies . 
 That ’ s a good idea ! The kitchen will look amazing ! 
 I would like you to be my lawyer .

 How much will the roses be ? 
 Now , that's a price that I like .

 I broke Mom's vase . 
 How are you ? 
 What can I help you with ? 
 Cash or check ? 
 How much do you want to deposit ? 
 What account will you be depositing this money into ? 
 What else can I do for you today ? 
 Is that the Japanese Restaurant ? 
 What kind of food do you serve ? 
 I see . That sounds fine . Until what time are you open ? 
 Fine . Well be there before then . 
 I'd like to check in . 
 Here you are . I'd like a window seat . 
 All right . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Sorry to hear that . Could you tell me what were in your purse ?

 Yes , it is . It was just painted and it has all the modern conveniences . 
 Hey , Anna , this is Jason . 
 Yes . How are you , Anna ? 
 Working . I've been really busy these days . I got a promotion . 
 Thanks . I am feeling pretty good about myself too . You know , bigger office , a raise and even an assistant . 
 You are kidding . 
 A bit over two years . This is a fast-moving company , and seniority isn ’ t the only factor in deciding promotions . 
 She is very nice and open-minded . 
 Yeah . He was a real slave driver . He probably would have loved it if we were robots . 
 Good . Tonight 8 o'clock . 
 Bye .

 Yes , could you use plastic bags ? 
 Could you charge it to my credit card ?

 I took care of commercial and residential coolers and heaters . I fixed many kinds of power failure problems . Some co-workers and I even rewired part of a building . 
 the best job ? What do you mean ? 
 I think my favorite job so far was when I worked for Linaria . It was hard work but the people on my job crew were great to work with . We really worked as a team . I enjoy working with those people . 
 I fixed a big problem with a machine and saved a lot of money for the factory . I got bonus for it . 
 Go ahead , please . 
 wow , this question is hard to answer . I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever had a job that I really disliked . But I dislike work that is monotonous , always the same from day to day . I like to move around and do different things . 
 no . I can ’ t think of any right now . 
 thank you very much . I ’ m looking forward to hearing from you about this job . 
 You don't know what you are asking ! 
 Remember what happened last time ? 
 Yes . That was a bit terrifying for both of us . 
 Oh , in that case , sure ! Uh ... what are these long sock-looking things ? 
 Why are you so excited ? 
 This was your first time voting , wasn ’ t it ? 
 That is so lucky of you . 
 You turned 18 a month before the election . 
 Are you serious ? 
 Congratulations on being a part of history . 
 Welcome and nice to meet you . I heard you were coming today . Is today your first day here in the company ? 
 First day is often exciting , isn't it ? Here , let me show you to your desk . You can have this computer and telephone and share the copy machine with us in the office . How do you like it ? 
 You are welcome . And , please call me Betty . 
 I'm paid on a salary . 
 At present I get 1,800 yuan per month . 
 That's not the problem I care about . You can decide on my capacity and experience . 
 Thank you , Mr . Brown . I really appreciate your assistance . 
 I'm sick of it , too . 
 There's no hot water , and the building is falling apart ! 
 What's on Channel 12 at 8: 00 ? 
 Do you want to watch it ? 
 Would you like any toast , dear ? 
 Toast , dear ? 
 Would you like any tea , dear ? 
 Oh , you ’ re not listening to me . 
 My name is Helen Levin . I'm the HR director of our company . 
 Nice to meet you , too . 
 I don't know ! Can I park my car now ? 
 Fine ! I'll be back by nine then . Don't worry . 
 Finally ! 
 Have the owners come up with a counter-offer to my offer to buy their home yet ? 
 Should I accept their offer ? 
 What if I make another offer , and they don ’ t accept it ? 
 I think that I would like to offer three hundred and thirty thousand dollars as a counter-offer . 
 How long before I find out what their decision is ? 
 Room service.What can I do for you ? 
 I am sorry.sir . Someone will there in a moment . 
 Yes , sir . I assure you it would never happen again . 
 Mr . Sandals , may I see your ID , please ? 
 Now , sir , do you have a credit card ? 
 I'm sorry , Mr . Sandals , but we accept only MasterCard or VISA . 
 Okay . You're in room 507 . It's a single queen-size bed , spacious , and nonsmoking . Is that suitable ? 
 Here's your key , sir . If you need anything , just dial 0 on your room phone . 
 Are you having a problem with it ? 
 Can you tell me how long your internet has been messing up ? 
 Will the internet even pop up ? 
 Since the internet isn't broken , your connection must be messed up . 
 If you'd like , I can send someone to fix it right now . 
 It should be no longer than an hour . 
 I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour . 
 I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ? 
 Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ? 
 I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy . 
 We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm . 
 Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze . 
 Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible . 
 I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days . 
 Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days . 
 Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again . 
 I haven't seen this machine before . What's it used for ? 
 Here we are on the train . 
 I hear many people have cars . 
 Why don't they drive ? Isn't a car more convenient than the subway ? 
 I see . 
 I ’ m sorry , Janet . I left it at home . I ’ ll bring it back in the morning . 
 I know , Janet . I just walked out and forgot it completely . I ’ ll go home and get it at noon , all right ? 
 I feel horrible . I think I picked up a bug . 
 A lot of people in my dorm are sick . Perhaps I picked it up there . 
 I ’ Ve been taking vitamin C and zinc and trying to get some rest . 
 My grandmother swears by hot chicken soup for a cold . 
 Yes , if I get worse , I will definitely look for extra help with this . 
 Are you looking for anything else ? 
 That was a thirtieth birthday present . You can have it if you want . 
 And these old Dutch candle holders would go nicely with the tea set . Have them . 
 As an existing banker , that will speed up the process . You said you had the documents with you ? 
 Before I verify those , I need you to fill in some forms . Then , as I said , I need to see valid credentials , your occupation and income details ... 
 You are authorized to borrow up to 20,000 RIB , with a repayment period of up to 1 year . 
 We can also look at your current credit status and adjust the interest accordingly . 
 If you sort out all of the paperwork today , you could have your loan by the end of the week . 
 Have you found a new job yet ? 
 What kind of work ? 
 What do you do there ? 
 How long is the assignment ? 
 Linda , do you know Mr.Green ? 
 Please meet him now . 
 Let ’ s move out of here . This apartment is too small . 
 A house would be great . I could plant a garden . And you could use the garage for a workshop . 
 How much is the rent ? 
 When is the place available ? 
 Is there something I can help you with ? 
 Ok . 
 Could you drop me off at the airport ? 
 Do I need to pay any extra charge for my suitcases ? 
 All right . 
 Which function do you use more , making calls or sending short messages ? 
 Then I recommend this package to you . You can receive all the calls free by paying just 10 yuan a month . 
 Sending a message ' KTCTWY ' to 10086 will do . 
 You're welcome . 
 What size do you take ? 
 I'll measure you . . . You take size 6 . What colour hat would you like ? 
 Here are some nice brown hats.Try this hat on.It ' s a very good one . 
 It's $ 9.95 . Do you want me to put it in a box ? 
 Sure . Wait a moment . 
 OK . 
 For color prints ? 
 About three days . 
 Here's your receipt . 
 I want an American breakfast with fried eggs , sunny side up . 
 Grapefruit juice and please make my coffee very strong . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 No , that's all . 
 Just put it on the table , please . 
 No , thanks . Ah , yes ! Can I have some more juice for the minibar ? 
 Tomato , orange and apple juice , please . 
 Were you around when the robbery happened ? 
 Could you explain what you saw ? 
 What did you see ? 
 Did you see his face ? 
 Did he come in with anyone else ? 
 Would you come down to the station for further questioning ? 
 Good morning . Elly company . 
 Hold on , please . 
 Please send this memo out to all the managerial staff ... there will be training for all the department heads next week . Attendance for managerial staff is mandatory , except for the financial department . Financial officers may participate if their schedules allow . 
 Managerial staff is anyone who is in a position of authority or responsibility , or who has anyone working under them . It includes all supervisors and department heads . 
 No , they are in a position of leadership and have more experience than normal account managers , but they do not directly supervise others . They are not members of the managerial staff and will not be included in our training . 
 Yes . This is Vanessa . 
 Yes . Is the position available now ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 I ’ ll see you then . Good bye . 
 You're telling me ! There are thousands of people here . 
 This is almost like a Taiwanese night market ! I can't believe it ! 
 Oh , yeah . OK . I'll just buy smallthings ! 
 Yes , I am . I have life insurance and my home and its contents are also insured . 
 That ’ a good idea . You are a fireman and it can be dangerous job . 
 I can terminate my life insurance policy when I retire and use the money as a pension . 
 Did you have to take a medical before you could take out the police ? 
 Miss Liu , have we received the fax from MS Company yet ? 
 Excellent . I have been expecting it . 
 You bet it is . It's about the new contract . 
 Look out ! A small boy is rushing out blindly . 
 You stopped just in time . Good for you ! 
 I'd like to make a reservation to Rome . 
 I'm supposed to be in Rome on the morning of the fourteenth , but I'd rather get there on the evening of the thirteenth . 
 Late in the afternoon , after work . 
 That's too early . I don't get out of work until five . Do you have a later flight ? 
 I'd better take the six thirty . It takes quite a while to get to the airport . 
 Oh , good . What time does the flight get to Rome ? 
 Hi Isabel ! You wanted to see me ? 
 Is everything okay ? You seem a bit preoccupied . 
 Okay ... 
 What ? Why ? I mean ... just like that ? I ’ m fired ? 
 What ! I resent that ! 
 Passport and Embarkation card please . 
 Where are you from ? 
 Did you have anything to declare ? 
 Would you open this suitcase , please ? 
 Let me take a look at this bag . Can you open it ? 
 Is this camera a gift for someone ? 
 You have to pay tax for this camera . 
 You have a lot of gifts , so you have to pay for the camera . 
 Which job do you prefer , an accountant or a secretary ? 
 Then how about a salesman ? 
 Welcome home , Peter ! 
 So , how was your trip to Thailand ? 
 I want to find a book called Gone with the Wind . But I can't find it . 
 Margaret Mitchell . 
 Thank you very much . I have been looking for it for a long time . Is this the latest edition ? 
 How about the price of the hardcover ? 
 A little bit expensive , but I will buy one . This is $ 25 , here you are . 
 I'm Lui , I'd like to Speak to Mr . Smiths . 
 I'd like to speak to Mr Robert Smith . 
 What do you need me to do ? 
 Sure . How many copies do you need ? 
 Hello , Mr.Benson , welcome to Beijing ! Is this your first time to visit china ? 
 Yes , Beijing has been grown over the last few years , there are a lot of improvements and changes being made for the Olympics . What would you like to see changing be made for Olympic , what would you like to see when are you here ? 
 I can pretty sure it can be arranged , the wall is a short distance from the city , but we could make arrangements for driver to take us out to visit the great wall during when our afternoon breaks , I also recommend you to visit Tian'an Men Square and city while you add it ! 
 Don't worry , I would be able to go along with you , over the next few days , if you have any questions or problems , I will be right here to help you out , I can be a translator and tour guide . 
 My pleasure , I hope your visit to Beijing is very enjoyable ! 
 No problem . I ’ Ve got a really light week . Anytime ’ s fine by me . 
 All right , I ’ ll put you in my book . 
 I am sorry . I can ’ t hear your very clearly . Could you say that again , please ? 
 Mark Wyatt ? I am sorry . The line is terrible.Could you spell that for me , please ? 
 W-Y-A-T-T , Got it . I haven ’ t heard of the name.Could you hold on the line when I check . 
 Would you please mail these letters , Lucy ? 
 These two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail . Others are ordinary letters . 
 It ’ s sent to Mr . Charles . I believe he is in London . 
 Office address , please . He might be at work when they arrive . 
 Yes , it ’ s right . 
 What's the problem ? 
 What charge was made ? 
 You didn't make this purchase ? 
 Sorry . When was this purse purchased ? 
 We'll do an investigation and get to the bottom of this . 
 No . We'll take care of everything . 
 I don't know . I only started looking for a job a few days ago . 
 I've only found a few openings in my field . 
 I'm trying to find a job in sound engineering . 
 unfortunately not . If I can't find anything in the field , then I could also work in the tourism field . 
 yes . 
 really ? what is it ? 
 that's interesting . Do you think they'd hire me ? 
 that's true . I might as well call them up and see if I can get an interview . Do you have the details ? 
 Help me organize these coins . 
 Yeah , I'm gonna go to the bank and change it for bills , but first I have to separate them into little piles . 
 Great , then we can add everything up and take it to the bank . 
 Oh yeah , those are from my trip to London . I have a couple of different pence , but in all it won't add up to one pound . 
 Hopefully ! 
 What's happened ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . May we meet the day after tomorrow ? 
 We'll discuss the contract in detail . 
 Not at all . See you . 
 Yup , I think so . The car ’ s packed.we have munchies and music , and the map ’ s in the car . 
 Got it ! Did you fill up the tank ? 
 You ’ re sure we ’ re not forgetting anything ? 
 Well.let ’ s get going then ! I love road trips ! 
 But we ’ Ve only been on the road for ten minutes . 
 Mary , my friend recommend me for a job to work in a company , and I feel it's great . 
 He has introduced the company details to me . 
 The company deals in selling electronics . 
 It was founded in 2002 , has been in business for 10 years . 
 More than 2000 now . 
 The company deals in selling electronics . 
 It was founded in 2002 , has been in business for 10 years . 
 More than 2000 now . 
 More than half of the employees have bachelors ' degree . 
 Three times every year . 
 Have you heard about the robbery ? 
 For real ? 
 What went down ? 
 Are you serious ? 
 Tell me what else happened . 
 Did the cops get him ? 
 What's in the box ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 How sweet ! Maybe he was just a shy guy who had a crush on you ! 
 Wow ! Call him tonight ! You guys will really have an interesting love story to tell everyone ! 
 Here you are . 
 Take your time . When you need anything , just call me . 
 Yes , I have the Tour Guide Certificate . 
 Because your travel agency has a good fame in this market ; what's more , all the staff here are working very hard . I like doing some challenging job . 
 Sure , company rules are not very strict at this point . 
 But remind you , there are some forbidden activities . 
 Don ’ t use office phones for personal matters . 
 Never ever come to work drunk , also smoking in the office is not allowed . 
 Does tea-serving follow any special etiquette in China ? Each time I dropped in at my Chinese friends ' homes , their parents would offer me a cup of hot , strong tea , though they never inquired of me about whether I want it . 
 So the guest is presumed to be thirsty and in need of some drink after the trip . In that case , I guess , in return , the guest doesn't have to drink it if he wouldn't like it . 
 So next time , I'd better take a few sips , to ' save face ' at least , right ? 
 What does that imply , then ? 
 Hello , Mr . Jones . 
 Long time no see . How is everything at home ? 
 OK , thanks . Anything I can do for you ? 
 Yes , sir . Would you like to remit it by M / T or by T / T ? 
 Very well , Mr . Jones . 
 I see , we have an explanation left on the table . If you follow the direction , it ’ s quite simple . 
 Oh , certainly . 
 Hello . I'd like to change my reservation for March 19 . My name is Mary Chang . 
 Well , I'd like to change the date to March 20 , and make that for two singles , not one . 
 To get around your difficulty , Mr Smith . I'd suggest that you reduce your order by half . You can send in an additional order later . 
 A month before the time you want the goods to be delivered . 
 Getting the goods ready , making out the documents and booking the shipping space , all this takes time you know . You cannot expect us to make delivery in less than a month . 
 When will that be ? 
 You can rest assured of that . 
 I strongly recommend it . As an international enterprise , it produces high quality household appliances . 
 Yes , all their products have warranties . 
 The fridges is covered by a one-year warranty . 
 This one . How do you like it ? 
 Sure , this way please . 
 Seven dollars ! ! ! Incredible ! But I saw that the seller has kind of a bad rating . 
 I read that someone called him a cheat and a liar ! And I noticed that he won't ship abroad . 
 OK . Wish me luck ! 
 To visit our supplier ? 
 Well , I guess you will meet many people in this field . So don ’ t forget to pack enough business cards in your suitcase . 
 By the way , do you know that our company just made some changes in the business trip policy ? 
 Ok , there is no cash advance anymore for short trips . You have to pay out of your own pocket , so save all the receipts from your business trip . And then attach them to your expense account . When you get back , our company will reimburse everything . 
 I am not sure . You can check with the finance department . 
 You ’ re welcome . Have a nice trip . 
 No , I don't think so . I think the Internet would be better . 
 well , there is no doubt that many people have found jobs through the want ads in the newspaper . 
 No . It doesn ’ t . There ’ s no through bus to the national history museum Madam .. 
 You can transfer at Cuchan Men . 
 Well , it ’ s only three stops from here . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 I chose the Institute of Foreign Language . 
 There were a number of them , such as Department of Literation , Department of Journalism and Communication , Department of Art Design , etc . 
 I should be most delighted . 
 Delighted I was able to help . 
 Good morning . I need a new identification card . 
 My ID card is lost . 
 I only have my household register . 
 Here you are , sir . What do I do next ? 
 Benjamin . 
 I've brought with me some of old ones . 
 OK , what's next then ? 
 May I see your passport please ? 
 What is the purpose of your visit to the United States ? 
 This visa is good for two weeks . Do you intend to stay longer than that ? 
 And you will do some traveling while you are here ? 
 What do you have in the bag , Mr . Lee ? 
 You're not carrying any food with you today ? 
 Okay , Mr . Lee . This is just a routine check . Would you mind opening the bag for me ? 
 I ’ m looking for a budget hotel in Orlando . Have you ever stayed at the Comfort Hotel ? 
 Why not ? 
 Oh . I guess you get what you pay for . How long did you stay there ? 
 Hmm , I ’ ll pass . Hopefully I can find a decent place that won ’ t cost a fortune . 
 Sure , what would you like ? 
 Why don ’ t you have a water or juice instead , so you don ’ t get dehydrated ? 
 So , what's on the menu for dinner tonight ? 
 You're not going to make anything to eat ? 
 I think you're a better cook than I am . 
 So you're telling me that you want me to make dinner ? 
 I'll cook dinner , don't worry . 
 I'll come wake you when it's ready , okay ? 
 Be careful.The floor is slippery . 
 Turn on the shower . 
 Ok . I'll check the heater . Dry yourself with the towel first . 
 It's nice , but it doesn't match the color of our room . 
 Oh no , this type gets dirty very easily and it's difficult to clean . 
 Look , this one matches our room and it's inexpensive . 
 I have never bought a house before and don ’ t know how to make an offer . 
 I love this house and would be willing to pay the full asking price of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars . 
 We could try that , but I really want this house ! 
 How long will it take to find out if they are going to accept the offer ? 
 Should I tell my bank that I have made an offer ? 
 Hello , how are you ? I am Jack . 
 What brings you here ? 
 Yes , it is really a good deal . $ 1,000 discount . I've never seen a sale as good as this one . 
 Sure . It has 1.8 liter engine . This one comes with all power options , air condition , CD player , full size spare tire , automatic transmission and ABC . The window price is $ 17,000 , and I can give You for $ 16.000 . 
 You must be kidding ! You cannot get that price anywhere . 
 Can you put down a $ 2,000 deposit , and I'll talk to my manager , see what we can do . 
 Okay , I'll be right back ... Congratulations ! The manager approved the final price $ 15,000 . 
 You are really tough . You got a deal . 
 Good afternoon ! Where to ? 
 You are going to Tian'anmen Square . No problem . 
 Around 20 minutes , but it all depends on the traffic . 
 By this time , it's better . The rush hour is over . 
 Sure thing . Here we are . 
 Eight yuan twenty cents . 
 Thank you . Have a nice day . 
 Do you have any hats ? 
 I like both of the two hats . Can you give me a discount if I buy both of them 
 I like this colour and it is very bright . 
 Yes , I think so . How much are they ? 
 What is that plastic cup for ? 
 Am I supposed to pee into the cup ? 
 Then what do I do with the cup ? 
 What is this test for ? 
 When will I know the results ? 
 I'd like to get my laundry . 
 Here you are . 
 Can you sew on these buttons ? 
 How much for the shirts ? 
 Here's the money , keep the change . 
 Our productivity has been down for more than six months now . I'm seriously considering pulling in an outside consultant to diagnose the cause of our problematic areas . I think we'd all benefit from an outsider's perspective . Sometimes we're just too closed to the problems to see the forest for the trees . 
 Do you have his card ? What's in his portfolio ? Which firm has he worked for in the past ? 
 Besides salary what kind of allowance can I expect ? 
 Can you elaborate it more concretely ? 
 Thank for your help . I owe you . 
 Thank you . I'm very glad to be here . As Ms . Tina said , the purpose of my presentation today is to familiarize you with the new EBB . As you probably know , EBB stands for Electronic Book Player . Our company put the original EBB on the market a year ago , but we have since all developed an improved model which we believe will be a big seller in both China and the U . S . 
 Certainly . First of all , the old model had a rather small screen , so not much information could appear at one time . So on the new model , we have made the screen much bigger and ... 
 Oh , there are many uses and I'll explain them in detail a little later . First , I'd like to ... 
 You were right , Mr . Tim . Your colleagues do want know all about it . 
 What time ? I ’ d like to go , but my calendar is really full today . 
 I ’ ll try to make it . I should be able to fit some time in around 3 o ’ clock . 
 That ’ s fine ... I need to pick up some stationary-you know , a stapler , scissors , files , who should I see about that ? 
 Thanks . I need to make a few photocopies . 
 Do you enjoy working in this office ? 
 What ’ s usually discussed at the department meetings ? 
 What's the special today ? 
 I don't like to . 
 Yes , I'm very fond of seafood . 
 I'd like to have red cooked sea cucumber . 
 Bring me an assorted cold dish , please . 
 No , thanks . I'm fine . 
 A bottle of champagne . 
 I want to find a book called Gone with the Wind.But I can't find it . 
 Margaret Mitchell . 
 Thank you very much . I have been looking for it for a long time.Is this the latest edition ? 
 How about the price of the hardcover ? 
 A little bit expensive , but I will buy one.This is $ 25 , here you are . 
 Please to meet you , Miss Chen . My name is Joey.Welcome to the hotel . Here are the keys , registration slips and breakfast vouchers . Break-fast will be served from seven tomorrow morning . Is there any change in your schedule ? 
 Then we will arrange a morning call at 7:30 . Will that be fine ? 
 Please put your luggage outside your room by eight . The bellboy will pick them up . 
 Thank you very much . Hope you enjoy your stay . 
 Here are our passports and tickets . 
 Yes , we did . Just this morning . 
 No , sir . We left directly from the hostel . 
 Yes . Oh ! And these two carry-ons . 
 Right . Thanks . 
 Thanks . 
 Good morning . What can I do for you ? 
 Of course . How about these postcards ? They are specially designed for Christmas . 
 No problem . You can choose what you like . 
 A postcard costs you five yuan . A dozen postcards cost you 60 yuan . 
 You are welcome . 
 You have a warrant . 
 Apparently , you have a bench warrant . 
 You missed a court appearance . 
 I don't know what to tell you . 
 Life isn't fair . 
 You have the right to remain silent . 
 Look , we need to have the Stars.com account , right ? 
 And to get it , we have to beat WebTracker to the punch . 
 That's why I promised that invoking would be up and running by the end of next week . 
 Yes , I can help you with that . Pick up the receiver and hit one of the buttons . Do you hear a tone ? 
 Next you dial 9 on the keypad . You should hear the tone change . Did you hear it change ? 
 OK . Well , after you get the line to change you have an outside line . Who are you trying to call ? 
 To call a number on the outside you now just dial the number . For inside calls , punch in the extension number . Has someone given you an extension list ? 
 All of the extensions are listed on the wall chart over there if you ever need help . 
 Yes , Madam . It is at the entrance . 
 Okay . Follow me please . 
 In aisle 3 . 
 Almost . Let me get my bag . 
 Thank you for your compliment . But you are exaggerating . I think you are destined to be a singer . You have the best voice ! 
 Yes , I'd like to . It's my honor . Let's pick a song . 
 Sorry , I can't sing the song . 
 OK . But I'm not familiar . I don't know the beginning part . 
 OK . 
 Ginseng comes in 6 different grades . It runs from 5,000 to 30,000 NT a jin . 
 You can get a liang if you want . A liang is one-sixteenth of a jin . That would be 330NT . 
 I'll have my brother cut some for you . 
 That's a lucky fruit called hong zat ! People say that if you eat them , you will have your first son very soon ! 
 Gui yuan are lucky , too ! If you eat them , you'll have a very sweet life ! 
 Oh , that's deer horn . That helps you ... umm , how should I put it ? 
 Better take the subway . It ’ s faster , and more convenient . 
 Just go to the ticket office in the subway . 
 No , you don ’ t have to . Here comes the train . Be careful ! Subway doors open and close automatically . 
 I want to send some money to Hangzhou . Today , if possible . 
 I think account to individual would be best . But which is the quickest way ? 
 Right , that's fine . I'd like it to get there as quickly as possible . 
 I know . They ’ Ve already sent back two approvals I sent them . Where do I sign ? 
 Oh , right . I remember . There you are . Hope you don ’ t have as many problems as I had ! 
 I only allow my child to watch up to an hour a day . I don ’ t think that tv is bad for kids . I think that kids should be active and not become couch potatoes . 
 If you decide to put a limit on the amount of tv they can watch , remember to have something else for them to do . If you don ’ t , they ’ ll get bored and misbehave . 
 Sure . You could talk to other parents in your neighbourhood and plan it so that all the kids are free at the same time . 
 That ’ s a good idea . Remember that if the parents watch too much tv , the kids will probably follow suit . 
 Have you been having these headaches for a long time ? 
 Have you been under a lot of stress lately ? 
 Have you been getting enough sleep lately ? 
 Have you had any head injuries lately ? 
 I am going to send you for a CT scan , and I will see you again when we see the results . 
 My name is Zhuang Lingy . How are you , Miss Kelly ? 
 Thank you . Miss Kelly . 
 I can type 120 words a minute and I take shorthand at 80 words a minute . 
 Yes , I would . ( After testing ) 
 Yes , I'd like to give it a try . 
 Happy birthday , John . Many happy returns of the day ! 
 Well , making good wishes . 
 Sure . We hope your wish will come true . 
 Here you are . 
 Ok.But is there anything wrong ? 
 I've got 6 packets of cigarettes and 2 bottles of champagne.Besides , I have two cameras , one is for my own use , and the other is a gift . 
 Ok . Where shall I pay duty for it ? 
 I've paid for it . Here's the receipt . 
 Thank you . 
 I would try to land a job in Beijing . I just want to go to one of the big cities . 
 many say more development opportunities can be found there . 
 and there're higher salaries there . 
 I've considered that . I'll share an apartment with others to save the rent , and the cost of living won't be too much for only one person . 
 oh , we had to break up because she didn't want to float around in Beijing . She insisted on working in her hometown and having a stable life . 
 sure have . I want to offer my parents a better life ; so , I'll have to work very hard . 
 Are you ready to order ? May I suggest a veal ? 
 The chicken is also nice . 
 Our special tonight is lobster . 
 Perhaps you'd enjoy the lamb . 
 Whatever you say . 
 That's a good idea . Let's bring our trunks and towels . 
 I'd prefer the pool . 
 What style do you use ? 
 Shouldn't you already be in bed ? 
 You need to get some rest , as you have to get up early in the morning . 
 Just close your eyes , and try not to think . 
 It doesn't matter , you need to get some sleep . 
 Then you're not going to go to sleep . 
 I want you in bed , right now , so sweet dreams . 
 Would you mind telling me your grades in high school ? 
 Very good . What was your favorite subject in middle school ? 
 How were your scores in university ? 
 What's the matter here ? 
 When did you find out ? 
 Apparently forced entry . The lock is battered to pieces . 
 He is so unskillful . I have never seen such an awkward burglar . 
 Probably . Let's check the inside then . 
 Yes , the house was in a terrible mess . It was almost turned upside down by the burglar . 
 You mean it is not created by the burglar ? 
 Would you mail a letter for me ? My hands are full . 
 That ’ s fine . We ’ re going to drop in and see Jimmy tonight . Don ’ t forget it . 
 Thanks . See you . 
 May I help you ? 
 Let me key in your information into my computer . I will pull up our records for you . Do you have an order number ? What name is the order listed under ? 
 Yes , Mr . Smith . I have an order for three cases of cartridges , it that what you would like to refill ? 
 Is there the correct billing address ? 
 I will send you an invoice in the next few days . Your order should be delivered before the end of the day on Monday . 
 What in the world is that smell ? 
 Smells like you're baking something . What are those ? 
 Cool ! But isn't that a hot air popcorn popper ? 
 The beans will burn . I know . I've tasted burnt coffee before ... yuck ! 
 Good morning ! Do you have any rooms available at the moment ? 
 I'd like a suite for four nights . 
 That's all right . How much do they cost ? 
 How much in total ? 
 Is breakfast included ? 
 That's fine . I'll get it . 
 I would like to pay by cash . Do I need to pay a deposit ? 
 Fine . Here you are . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Bye-bye ! 
 There are many interesting places you should be sure to see . One problem is transportation , however . Because the city is very old , the roads are narrow and congested . If you only have three or four days to visit , you don't want to spend them waiting in traffic in a cab . I suggest you take the subway . 
 No worries , there's a subway station at the conference center itself , and a shuttle from your hotel to the conference center that takes only 5 minutes . When you do your personal sightseeing , you can first take the shuttle to the conference center , then hop on the metro . 
 You can get a daily pass that will allow you to travel unlimited for the whole day for about 6 dollars . Otherwise , you can pay by trip , which is about 50 cents to 2 dollars each trip , depending on how far you go . 
 No , no ... . it's very hard to get lost . There are two lines , one that goes in a circle , the other that is straight . If you get lost , there are always subway attendants that can help you find your way . 
 I have been employed as a secretary at a trading company . 
 I find it interesting . 
 I go to the office by bus every day . 
 My main responsibility is trouble-shooting between top management and the general employees . 
 No , often my boss requires overtime work . 
 5,000 yuan a month . 
 I would like to have a job that is more lively than my present one . Besides , I would like to practise my English in my work . As my present employer deals with China trade towards China only , there isn ’ t much chance to speak English . 
 Yes , we can handle that here . How can I help you ? 
 Did you work at all during the last pay period ? 
 Did you report it on your Continued Claim Form ? 
 Well , we deducted a portion of the income that you made from this week ’ s check . 
 That is cheating and , if you get caught , you will be fined and disqualified from collecting unemployment . 
 Sure , I have to go anyway . But the first place you need to go is immigration office . They ’ ll check your ticket , passport , visa and immunization record book . After that we can go to the baggage claim area . 
 This is my luggage , but it's too heavy . I can't move it . Could you help me get it out of the conveyer belt ? 
 Where shall we go next ? 
 Ok . 
 No , I don't . 
 Sure . 
 Chocolates . 
 No , they are peppermint chocolates . 
 About a 100 and I have had them declared . 
 A visitor . 
 Kate , will you please make ten copies of this report ? 
 Then use the xerox machine . 
 Oh , forget it then . Hey , I told you to put the files on the in tray , not on my desk . 
 Very funny . What's wrong with you today ? You are my secretary and you are not supposed to talk to me in that tone of voice . Do you know that ? 
 Keep your voice down , Kate . I know you've had a hard day today , but you should at least show some respect for me . If you really don't feel well , go home . There isn't much work today anyway . 
 I ’ m not sure what you expect me to do , Michelle . You ’ Ve not been very clear about any of this . 
 Yeah . I think that would be a good idea . I ’ m really in the dark on everything . 
 I want to join in the bus tour . 
 Will the bus pick up the tourists from hotels ? 
 Woo , that's quite convenient . 
 That's a very popular way to pay nowadays , totally hassle free ! 
 Please fill in this application and sign your name down here , at the bottom . 
 I just need to see some ID , like a passport for example . 
 We usually ask for 100 RIB , Sir . 
 So , that's everything done for you . Here's your new cheque book , the cheque guarantee will follow in the post in a couple of days . 
 It ’ s my pleasure . 
 Would you please tell me about your pay skill first ? 
 They sum my skills and experience . I ’ d like to start it with 4000 yuan a month . 
 Do I have paid vacation ? 
 why are there still so many people overweight despite the current fitness craze ? 
 what are they ? 
 why ? 
 that makes sense . Probably less time to make dinner and the junk food is cheaper . 
 what's that ? 
 wow ! No wonder people are so fat . Say , Carl , looks like you could be doing a bit more exercising . 
 you should consider eating healthier food and getting some more exercise . 
 so what happened ? 
 you should have kept trying . 
 I would like to have my room cleaned . Would you please send a maid here right now ? 
 Thank you . 
 I'm not sure . What does it look like ? 
 There's a large wooden crate in the corner which I haven't unpacked yet . It might be in there . 
 Oh , I thought I could make a right turn on red here . 
 Oh , I guess I didn't see it . 
 Here they are . 
 Thank you , Ma ’ am . 
 Well , Vince dropped off some sales reports for you.Said you signed a big deal with HomeSupplies.com . 
 You're right . All the entertainment web sites follow Stars.com . 
 Elvin stopped by to see me .

 Certainly . Which flight would you like ? 
 Could I have your name , please ?

 What do you want to eat for breakfast ? 
 You know that breakfast is the most important meal of the day ? 
 That's not a good excuse . 
 I just eat some oatmeal , toast , and orange juice . 
 It's good , and it's easy to make . 
 So , are you still going to have cereal ? 
 Did you sign up for the picnic party ? 
 This time you can bring your daughter with you . 
 There are times of games planned , should have a grand time . 
 I'd love to . I heard about Halloween when I was in Beijing . It's kind of a children's day . Small kids get dressed up , then walk around with paper bags or baskets , knocking on the neighbor's 
 That's kind of cool . But what's the trick mean ? 
 That sounds kind of fun , maybe I can get tighter with my friends that night . 
 That does sound a lot of fun . 
 OK . 
 I am sorry . There is a speed limit . 
 Are you OK there ? 
 Can I help ? 
 Year ! They are unreliable sometimes . 
 Good day . I ’ m looking for a one-bedroom apartment today . 
 Well , I didn ’ t want to pay more than $ 900 a month . 
 Is it furnished ? 
 No , thank you ! I want to take an apartment , not a prison . 
 Hello . What can we do for you ? 
 Certainly . That shouldn't be a problem . Tell me , do you have a Basic Account with us ? 
 Oh , that's good . We will come to our final decision based on your credit rating , the payment capability ... 
 Could you tell me where the cereal is ? 
 What aisle is that ? 
 I know where that is at . 
 Could you point me toward the dishwashing detergent ? 
 I didn't even think about that . 
 Thank you so much for helping me . 
 How time flies ! We have been lovers for nearly a year . We hit it off instantly . 
 Is Tom here ? 
 Hello , I need to come in and see the doctor . 
 I have really itchy skin and think I may have to have it looked at . 
 No , but I have a low fever . 
 I want to come in on Wednesday . 
 I would prefer Dr . Smith . 
 Good morning , Star Airline . What can I do for you ? 
 I see . You are leaving for Berlin on July 23rd with Mr . Smith , right ? 
 Isn't your family name Lin ? 
 I am sonry.So you are loaving on Duty 21st and your seat is in the business section . 
 May I help you , sir ? 
 Well , we have many models to choose from here.Do you have a particular brand you want ? 
 I see . And does your son have a VCR now ? 
 Does he watch a lot of movies ? 
 I would like to make a suggestion then , sir . 
 If your son wants to study film , probably he will start to collect movies himself . 
 May I suggest you consider buying him a DVD player instead ? 
 It is very similar . The technology is the same . 
 For one thing , sir , the quality of the image is usually better.That ' s because it's digital . 
 It is a little more expensive , sir.But there is one important advantage which your son might appreciate . 
 If your son starts to buy video tapes , he can't keep them very long . 
 Video tape breaks down after fifteen years.So if he collects a lot of tapes , after fifteen years they will all start to rot . 
 Yes , it is , sir . 
 This is the excellent thing about DVDs.If your son starts to collect DVDs , they will last forever . They will never rot . 
 So let me show you some of our DVD players.In my opinion , DVD is the wave of the future . 
 Your family must be busy shopping for Christmas , now . 
 Woo , your home will beautiful on Christmas . 
 I do wish your christmas and happy new year . 
 Do you have the same style in white ? 
 What a pity . Are you likely to be getting more in ? 
 Excuse me , are these deck chairs free ? 
 Could I have a fresh towel ? 
 It's very kind of you . By the way , when does the pool close ? 
 We have successfully fulfilled our work plan . In fact , we are No . 1 in terms of market share . 
 I hope we can continue to get support from the departments concerned . 
 Is this the right counter to check in for this flight ? 
 Here you are . I have just come from downtown . 
 Really ? What can I do now ? I can't miss the important meeting . 
 May I sit here ? 
 I'm afraid I've a complaint to make , which is about the goods we ordered last week . 
 I will explain the problem briefly . We found in the examination that 35 % of the goods have damaged . 
 Here's the survey report issued by the China Commodity Inspection Bureau . According to the report , the damage was caused by poor packing . Our surveyors also discovered some cracks on the surface of a number of other cases . 
 Please look into the matter and solve the problem immediately . 
 Can you help me pick out a gift for my niece ? 
 That sounds good . Let me see one . 
 Oh , she's nice . How much is she ? 
 Well , that's reasonable . I'll take it . 
 No , thank you . 
 Oh , cash will be fine . 
 Good afternoon , Mr.Chen . How are you ? 
 How much do you want , Mr.Chen ? 
 The rate is still high for other foreign currencies . The exchange rate for Hong Kong dollars into Renminbi is 1.053 Renminbi yuan to one dollar . 
 Certainly , sir . How do you want it ? 
 Yes , Mr.Chen . Here you are . 
 Good morning , madam . Can I help you ? 
 Your complexion is on the oily side . I suggest you use cleansing gel . 
 How do you prefer this one ? It cleans thoroughly without striping your natural protective oil . The gentle formula keeps skin soft and healthy . 
 We've also got a fragrance-free one , specially designed for sensitive skin . I'm sure you'll like it . 
 Yes , sure . This line of products is fragrance-free . We have a facial mask , moisturizing lotion , eye cream and tonic . 
 Thank you very much , madam . Here are some samples of our products . Do try them out . 
 I didn't know you did Yoga . 
 What have you learned ? 
 As opposed to short and shallow ? 
 I read something like that once . I think it was , ' Life is in the breath . ' 
 Sure . Where would you like to stand ? 
 OK . 
 Are you ready ? Here we go . Say Cheese ! 
 Is it the battery ? 
 Do you have an extra battery ? 
 If you don't mind , you can use my camera and leave your address with me so I can send you the photos later . 
 You're welcome . Now smile ... 
 What is it , Mrs . Wang ? 
 Is that so ? So far we haven't had any complaint of this kind . Our mushrooms have enjoyed a good reputation for their superior quality for years . We are really at a loss to understand why your lot was found moldy and wormeaten . Have you any evidence ? 
 Though everything may be as you say , there are many factors involved . What's more , your surveyors have not mentioned any cause for the damage . 
 As you know , before shipment , the Commodity InspectionBureau inspected the goods in question . They concluded that the goods were well dehydrated from fresh and choice material and up to standard for export . 
 The inspection certificate , which is based on a random selection of 20 % of the consignment as we've agreed on beforehand , is considered final and binding upon both parties . We do not accept any claims for compensation for loss incurred in transit , because you bought the goods F . O . B . Houston and on shipping quality , not on landed quality . Your claim , in our opinion , should be referred to the insurance company , as the mishap occurred after shipment . 
 That's a matter over which we could exercise no control , then . I'm afraid I have to insist that you approach the insurance company for settlement , that is , if you have covered this risk in your coverage . 
 Otherwise the insurance company would no doubt have entertained your case . 
 Lucy , I ’ d like to fix the light in the corridor , it keeps flashing , which drives me crazy . Would you like to help me with the ladder ? 
 I think I can handle it by myself . 
 I see . If I got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , I wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility . 
 Like this one ? 
 Yeah , thank you for telling me . 
 George , is your chicken OK ? 
 My fish is very dry . 
 That's exactly what I was thinking had happened . 
 The vegetables are kind of mushy . 
 The food here is usually good , so I think that we should tell the waiter that there is a problem . 
 Order ! 
 What ’ s your plea ? 
 But all the evidence points to you . 
 What are you saying ? 
 Who is ? 
 We can work something out . 
 Where can I find information on this subject ? 
 Will you give some advice on this experiment ? 
 What's his suggestion for this work ? 
 The way I see it is that they'd join us . 
 Hi , Alex . How are you doing ? 
 I know the feeling . I ’ m calling to let you know about this new Italian place I found . It ’ s right around the corner . 
 We have made some adjustment on the prices , and this is renewed price list . 
 This is our rock-bottom price and we can't make any further reduction . 
 Then , what's your countr-offer ? 
 We are sincere to make business with you , but the difference between your counter-offer and our price is too great . 
 How about meeting each other half-way in order to conclude the business ? 
 Can I take your order ? 
 What kind of drink do you want with those ? 
 You can super-size your meal for only 39 cents extra . 
 How about anything for dessert like an apple pie or ice cream ? 
 Hello sir , how may I help you ? 
 I see , may I ask what the occasion is ? 
 Very well.This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness . 
 Mmm , well this is our “ I ’ m sorry I cheated on you ” package . Two dozen red roses lined with tulips , carnations and lilies . The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you . 
 I ’ m sorry sir but , what exactly did you do ? 
 Get out of my store , you jerk ! 
 Do you think so ? I don ’ t like girls who look like that . I like girls who are not too slim . If you like her , go and talk to her . 
 He ’ s huge ! He must go to the gym to have a well-built body like that . 
 I don ’ t mind , but I like girls with long hair . 
 Have you ever dated a girl taller than you ? 
 Yes , I have . Perhaps I should go to the gym , like that girl ’ s boyfriend . 
 Excuse me , I ’ d like to buy a guitar.Could you recommend one ? 
 An acoustic one . 
 What ’ s the difference ? 
 I ’ m mainly interested in learning to play rhythm guitar . 
 This one ’ s a little too expensive for me . I ’ d prefer something cheaper for now.When I ’ Ve learned to play , I might get a better one . 
 Hmm.All right , I ’ ll take it , and this book on how to play the guitar as well . 
 Oh , right.Thanks for your help . 
 Is Mr . Thomas there , please ? 
 I said , is Mr . Thomas there ? 
 Would you like to make a donation ? 
 It ’ s for the campaigns . 
 It doesn ’ t matter how much .

 How far away is it ? 
 How many miles to go ? 
 Will we be there soon ?

 I can't . I am really behind of my work .

 Sure . This is Claire .

 Can you tell him that it ’ s urgent ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Bye .

 Oh , I was just thinking about getting a bite to eat . Have you had lunch yet ? 
 No , really ? 
 Who will be there ? 
 That is good . He can leave you alone this time . 
 We are going to Jingshan Park . Originally it was an imperial garden while it is now a public park . 
 It is at the north of Forbidden City , on the central axis of Beijing . 
 Jingshan consists of five individual peaks , and there lies an elaborate pavilion on the top of each peak . These pavilions were used for gathering and leisure time . These five peaks also draw the approximate historical axis of central Beijing . 
 According to the dictates of Eng Shut , it is favorable to site a residence to the south of a nearby hill . When the capital was moved to Beijing , no hill existed at this location , so one was constructed . It is called " Coal Hill " . The last emper-or of Ming Dynasty , Chongzhen , committed suicide by hanging himself here in 1644 . 
 Jingshan Park is especially a popular place for old people socializing and gathering . People can often find elder folks dancing , singing opera and other cultural activities at Jingshan Park . 
 The crab soup is quite delicious.It ' s always a favorite with our customers . 
 Well , why not try Spaghetti Bolognese ? 
 Miss Sun , could you please type this report for me ? 
 Could you please double space it so I can make corrections ?

 Oh , then it's my honor to be here with you . I can see now why you've been so curious about the bar stuff . You like this place ? 
 Yeah . Other than that , the real feature are the excellent drinks . Can I have your ticket ? 
 Well , with the ticket , you can get a free drink . What would you like ? Orange juice ? 
 I'll show you how . The bar tenders know whose turn it is . And also , I can snap my fingers to catch his attention . 
 Hello , Sir . Are you still there ? 
 Did you check with reception at your hotel ? 
 OK , that's fine , Sir . We just need to ask you some questions for security purposes . 
 Could I have your name , please ? And do you know your card number ? 
 That should be fine , Mr Kowalski . And your PIN number ? 
 That's completely natural . Most of our customers do the same thing . Could you just hold for a moment please ? Thank you . 
 Well , all right . There are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents , information and other things . 
 They are , keep the documents in chronological order , remove all the chips and pins , punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder . 
 You should always remember that one customer on file is the rule . 
 Yes . How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ? 
 Hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world . 
 Yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies ! 
 Are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short voice ? 
 Yeah , I think so . 
 Wonderful ! I'll start packing our suitcases .

 she's far better than my old boss . He didn't know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down . 
 they are all pretty easy-going . It's a very friendly place to work . 
 of course . I spent so much time at my old workplace that I got to know them all very well . They were like family to me . 
 sure . Since we work together in teams , we have to get along with each other .

 I prefer it to working independently . I think most people do . 
 Sorry , I'm afraid the hotel is full on those dates.Shall I contact another hotel for you ? 
 Dam it , I'm running out of money again , I really need to balance my budget and handle my money better .

 No , it's not necessary since the stone is not big . 
 Yes , you're lucky . But you should go to the Ultrasonic Department to disperse the stone . Meanwhile , I'll give you some herbal medicine . 
 Just whose fault is this damage ? 
 It certainly didn't arrive here that way . 
 How about taking the damaged portion at a lower price ? 
 I was thinking of 30 % off . 
 I ’ m glad to have the opportunity of visiting your corporation . I hope to conclude some substantial business with you . 
 I ’ m interested in your hardware . I ’ Ve seen the exhibits and studied your catalogues . I think some of the items will find a ready market in Canada . Here is a list of my requirements , for which I ’ d like to have your lowest quotations , C . I . F . Vancouver . 
 I ’ ll do that . Meanwhile , could you give me an indication of price ? 
 What about the commission ? From European suppliers I usually get a 3 to 5 percent commission for my imports . It ’ s the general practice . 
 You see , but I do business on a commission basis . A commission on your prices would make it easier for me to promote sales . Even two or three percent would help . 
 What's the cost of the trousers ? 
 Is there a price reduction ? 
 I have a question about my payment and need someone to help me . 
 I can ’ t figure out why my paycheck this week is smaller than last week ’ s . 
 I made a little bit of money , but not much . 
 I claimed the work I did on the last Continued Claim Form . 
 That being the case , I don ’ t think that I am going to show the income next time . 
 Hello ! We ’ Ve been waiting for our lunch order for over an hour . Did you forget our order ? 
 The name ’ s Stanley Morris and the order was for two chef ’ s salads . 
 Excuse me , is this the parcel post counter ? 
 ( At counter 1 . ) Do you take parcels here ? 
 I want to send this package to Los Angeles , please . 
 I'd like to send it by regular mail . 
 Here is 200 . 
 Thank you . 
 Just a second and I'll check the schedule . 
 American Airlines has a flight leaving at 9:25 a . m . 
 You have to be there two hours before departure time . 
 Sure , just send me through internal mail . 
 No problem at all . Welcome . 
 So soon ? 
 OK ! Hurry , then ! Here's my cup . I can't wait for step four ! 
 Yes , there is , drinking your coffee ! 
 How long is it altogether ? 
 That sounds OK . So , we start here at the car park and walk along the path to the waterfall . 
 Then we will follow this path down the hill to the old church . 
 This path leads to the cave . Can we look inside the cave ? 
 Then we turn south and come back to the car park along this path . 
 How long do you think it will take us to complete the walk ? 
 That ’ s fine . Are there signposts along the way , in case we get lost ? 
 Bob returned from Japan last week . You know that ? 
 I think so , too . 
 The fare is $ 1.25 . 
 I haven't been driving for long — only for a few months . 
 Not in the least bit . 
 I never dreamed of doing this either . The only thing I like about it is the money . 
 It was really nice talking to you too . 
 I'll have a good day once this day is over . 
 What ? 
 Did you open it before we left ? 
 I don't know . Wait . Is this yours ? 
 It looks that way . That's probably why the door wasn't locked when we came in . 
 Yes , but the robber broke in.Then , when he left , he left through the door . So it wasn't locked . 
 Look around . 
 And your stereo too . So what did he steal ? We have to go look upstairs . 
 I don't think there will be . He left through the door , remember ? 
 Yes . My only recreation is skateboarding . 
 Maybe . But it emphasizes participation and a spirit of courage , and can give one the extreme sense of cheerfulness and success . I'm getting to like the game more and more . 
 You ’ re welcome . I enjoyed helping you . 
 So do I . 
 I swear I never drink again . Just give me another chance , please . 
 You know how hard I try to quit , I've lost without you . I am mot let you go . 
 I have to make money to support the family , so I have little time left to share with you . 
 I told you I happened to be more important meeting at that time . 
 Room Reservations . May I help you ? 
 In whose name was the reservation made ? 
 What was the date of the reservation ? 
 Excuse me , but is the reservation for yourself or for another party ? 
 May I have your name and phone number , please ? 
 Thank you , sir . I will cancel Mr . White's reservation from November 21st for 4 nights . We look forward to another chance to serve you . 
 Yes . Do you have any specials today ? 
 I have never tasted that . I would like to have a try today . 
 Fantastic ! I got the promotion ! 
 After the new year . 
 Yes , Mr . Li . 
 I also have done it . 
 Yes . They have been laid by their name cards on the meeting table for each attendant . 
 Hello , Miss Wu , This is Dan Robson calling from OTC limited . I'd like to check my last order . When exactly was it sent out ? 
 Sure . No problem . 
 Sure . Do you have my number ? 
 No problem . I'll wait for your call . 
 The post office.Sorry . I ’ m not sure . 
 Crown Hotel . Reservation Desk . Can I help you ? 
 What kind of room would you like , sir ? We have single rooms , double rooms , suites and deluxe suites in our hotel . 
 All right . 
 The current rate is $ 100 per night . 
 For $ 100 you'll have a radio , a color television , a telephone and a major international newspaper delivered to your room every day . 
 Excuse me , sir . But please call an ambulance . My friend suddenly got a sharp pain in the stomach . 
 Oh , is there ? Will you find someone to take us to the hospital then ? 
 Yes , he is . 
 Welcome to Al ’ s Garage . What seems to be the problem ? 
 Very wise decision . When was the last time you had a tune up ? 
 We usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers . 
 First of all , we change the motor oil and oil filter . If you don ’ t do this , it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves . 
 We also check your spark plugs , fuel filter , and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones . 
 Trust me , regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs . 
 Aisle A is where you'll find all the produce . 
 I don't know , but I'm sure the produce person can tell you . 
 My family really needs a car , we live quite far out of the town centre , but unfortunately we cannot afford to pay out such a large sum of money in one go . 
 Great , I just hope I qualify ! Could you tell me some more ? Can I use the money to buy the car from anywhere ? 
 Then I can go to this appointed dealer , see what they've got and then make a decision ? 
 What do you require ? 
 That sounds fine . If you could give me the name and address of the dealer I'll go over there now and see what they've got . 
 Do I have to wear ear muffs and gloves ? I am not used to working with them on . 
 OK . I'll go and get a pair of them . 
 How much is it ? Eight films and a bar of chocolate . 
 Can you accept a check ? 
 Here's two twenties.Keep the change . 
 Liz , do you have a minute ? 
 I need you to help me set up for my presentation Thursday morning . 
 Well , it isn't at this office . It's over at the Dayton Street office.Have you been there before ? 
 Good . So you will have no trouble finding it . 
 I will talk about developing sales through our website.All the branch heads will be there , and most of the staff . 
 Well , I need the display monitor.But Tom can set that up for me on Wednesday . I will need you to help with everything else . 
 I've got some great news for you ! 
 yes , I'll be promoted to department manager . 
 thank you . Actually , I could not believe it at first . You know , there're so many outstanding people in our company . Many of them are qualified to fill that position . 
 thank you very much . 
 I appreciate it very much . You've been doing great . I expect to see you be promoted pretty soon . 
 next week . 
 absolutely . 
 You want to make sure it's good solid habit before anything else takes its place , like work ? 
 And where are we going to go ? 
 Are we going all out or just starting with a mini family vacation ? 
 Well , I was looking in this magazine the other day and cruises are not very expensive at all . Take a look at this ! 
 You did a fabulous job . 
 That's what I'm telling you . 
 You did mess up a little on one thing . 
 You had a little trouble on your parallel parking . 
 That's something that you really need to work on . 
 You're still going to get it . 
 First , I'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . He or she will know all the local laws and regulations . 
 I think that we should send one of our HR people to do that . I don ’ t think we should use an agency , because they won ’ t be familiar with the type of people we employ . Have we decide on the location of the branch office ? 
 Why didn ’ t we choose an office in the CBD ? 
 Yes . We ’ Ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries . We hope to sign another three this month . 
 Hopefully next month . Everything is a little rushed . We should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly . 
 Yes , it has . We ’ re going to target the business community through business magazine . 
 May I help you ? 
 Do you have an account with us ? 
 Do you want large or small bills ? 
 What denomination ? 
 Do you want the whole amount in traveler's check ? 
 I will take part in the finals soon . 
 Jim , what do you think of that first interviewee ? 
 Okay , what about the first woman ? 
 All right , and what about the older gentle ? 
 Ohhhh . I hate this part of my job . 
 Could I trouble you for a minute , Mr . Graham ? 
 I would like to leave a few minutes early today . Would that be all right ? 
 Maintenance Department . May I come in ? 
 Did you call us ? 
 What's the problem ? 
 Let me have a look . I think the batteries should be changed . Let me replace them with new ones . Now , it's working . 
 Is there anything else I can do for you ? 
 If you have any problems , just call us . 
 Melissa ? I ’ d like to invite you to my wife ’ s birthday party . 
 Her birthday is on the 9th . We ’ re going to have dinner at a Mexican restaurant , and then maybe go out dancing . 
 Let's go to Burger Queen for lunch . They have good cheese burgers . 
 Look at the long line , there are always a lot of people waiting in lines just for the cheese burger . It must be very delicious . 
 Come on . It is worth waiting . Their cheese burgers are really popular . Once you have it , you will love it . 
 Yup , they have good French fries as well . Not very thick , but crispy enough . You should try them with some mayonnaise sauce . That is the Belgium style . You will love it . 
 Come on . You just have it once in a while , not every day . It will not harm you . 
 Be patient . Good food never comes fast . 
 May I help you ? 
 You will need to wait a few minutes for fries . They're still in the fryer . 
 Your total comes to 7 dollars . 
 Thank you . Your cash back is 13 dollars . Pull into a parking states , and we'll bring you your fries in two minutes . 
 have you read the feature article about Oprah Winfrey in this magazine ? 
 apparently , she's being given an award for donating so much money to charity . 
 I heard that she's one of the wealthiest women in the world . 
 you know ; I heard that she was opening a school for underprivileged girls in Africa . 
 yes , she's not only building the school , but is also using her own money for the upkeep of the school and to pay the teachers a fair salary . 
 I agree . So many celebrities waste their money on sports cars , expensive clothing , and luxurious hotels . 
 what a waste . It's good to see some stars that are more concerned with charity than status symbols . 
 I worked as a personnel manager in a state-owned company , and then I transferred to a joint venture as a sales manager . So I am familiar with the exile market in China . 
 They treated me very well . We cooperated harmoniously and respected each other . 
 I have learned some skills about how to deal with clients and how to behave myself as a personnel manager . 
 I prefered working with other colleagues when I worked in my previous company . I think teamwork and cooperation are very important . No matter how competent he or she is in a company , he can't do without them . 
 Two rows up on the right . We have various kinds of chocolates . 
 $ 10 a kilo . 
 Yes . 
 Thank you for calling me . I will be there on time . 
 Bye . 
 Hi , Sean . It ’ s Mary in Mr . Emory ’ s office . I placed an order for 1,000 bound copies of a staff manual last week . 
 Well , I was hoping you would do me a big favor . That was supposed to be a rush order , I forgot to tell you . I ’ m getting a lot of flak from my boss . 
 Good morning . 
 I'm running a high fever and feeling terribly bad . 
 Since last night . 
 Fine . But can you tell me how to get to the Medical Department , please ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Johnny , have you tidied up your room yet ? 
 Do I have to remind you that your grandma is arriving tonight ? 
 Yes , so this place had better be clean . You know Grandma ... 
 And Steve is going to look after you until we come back . 
 Good morning . I'd like to reserve some rooms for a tourist party . 
 You see , we are tourists whose requests are different , so please tell me more about it , will you ? 
 That's great . I'd like to book four single rooms , five double rooms and three suites . 
 From tomorrow till January 8th . That's five days in all . 
 Here you are . Is everything OK ? 
 OK . Here you are . 
 Thank you . By the way , is there any preferential rate for the party ? 
 That's wonderful . Thank you . 
 Good afternoon , sir , is there anything I can help you with today ? 
 Well , I would be happy to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for her . Is there anything particular that you have in mind ? 
 Well , you can give her a set of pearl earrings , or this beautiful heart-shaped pendant . What is her favorite gemstone ? 
 Don ’ t worry , we specialize in providing our customers a relaxed , pressure-free shopping environment . That stone is an amethyst . We have a range of beautiful amethyst pieces . Take a look at this bracelet . It ’ s 18K rose-gold , studded with amethyst and blue topaz . It ’ s a great statement piece . 
 We have this beautiful platinum pendant , or you could also get her a locket . You could also get her a timepiece — it ’ s both glamorous yet functional.If you tell me a little more about your girlfriend , maybe I can help you find something for her . 
 Perhaps you could give her a ring ? 
 Well sir , I believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose ! 
 Fabulous ! We should look at engagement rings then ! Now that ’ s a whole other section . 
 Hello , could I speak to Mr . Wang , please ? 
 This is Mr . Smith of XYZ Company . When will he be back ? 
 Yes , Please tell him I called and ask him to return my call as soon as possible . It's about the PPT contract . 
 Hi , are you busy ? 
 Okay , I'm putting together a report on the Allied Marketing Co . failure , and I seem to have run into a stone wall . Can you help me out ? 
 You were there when the problem started . I was hoping you could fill me in on the details . 
 Name it . 
 All right , I can do that , and as soon as we finish this , we can both work on my problem . 
 Give me the study . I'll start as soon as I get back to my office . 
 Good morning , I ’ d like to book a flight from Beijing to Shanghai , please . 
 I ’ d like to fly next Friday . 
 One-way , please . I ’ m flying back to London from Shanghai . 
 How long is the flight ? 
 Why did the boss come down on Joe like a ton of bricks . 
 How did he know that he had bad mouthed him ? 
 He is then in a very difficult situation . 
 What are you working on ? 
 What budget ? 
 How much money can you spend ? 
 Why only $ 300 ? 
 For what ? 
 Your budget is a good idea . 
 Could I speak to Mr . Wu , please ? 
 This is Kevin . 
 Hello , excuse me ! 
 Yes . I wanna know where I can get on the bus going downtown . 
 Ok , I see . Thank you ! 
 Evan , are you busy right now ? 
 Well , I need a hand with the fax machine . My fax is not going through . 
 Ah , thanks . 
 Hello , Miao Ping . Yes , it has . I've been in Saudi Arabia for the last 6 weeks on business . I did have a little time to relax in Dubai , though . 
 I need to effect a payment under my L / C . Not the old one , the new one my Assistant came in and dealt with last week . 
 It's DG193445782100 . Can you find it ? 
 What are you waiting for ? Get on that bus quickly . 
 On the bus . The driver collects the fares . You'll have to take your luggage on board . 
 I need somebody to come over and fix my internet . 
 For some reason it's just not connecting . 
 It hasn't been working the past few days . 
 It does , but it won't connect to anything . 
 Could you send someone to fix it today ? 
 When will they be here ? 
 What happens if we make a deal and thirty to sixty days after delivery the price goes down and you didn't get the best possible price ? How do I handle that ? 
 Right ! So how do I do that ? What will make you happy ? 
 Excuse me ? 
 What kind of change , just in prices ? 
 You mean on product availability , reliability and price ? 
 So it's like you want me to be your eyes and ears into the industry . I can do that , provided the company I'm working for isn't hurt . 
 Let's eat out . 
 Welcome to Bill ’ s Fabric World . What can I do for you today ? 
 Sure we do ! We have the best tailors in the country ! What is it that you need exactly ? 
 Excellent ! We have the finest cashmeres at affordable prices.How about we get you measured ? Let ’ s start off by measuring the width of your shoulders . Now , let ’ s measure the length of your arms and this bit around your neck here . 
 No problem ! Now for your pants , let me just measure your waist and the inseam . 
 OK.Now you can pick your fabric and pattern design . Please follow me . 
 Just fill out this form , will you ? 
 How would you like it ? 
 Here you are . Thank you . 
 I was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ? 
 Well , I ’ m looking to get a custom-made suit . 
 Can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? My neck gets easily irritated . 
 You might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . I tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays . 
 Sorry , I need a trip to the bog . 
 Good afternoon , Ma ’ am , My name is Mike and I am selling subscriptions to all sorts of periodicals . 
 Please ma ’ am , if you could spare five minutes of your time , I am sure we could find something that interests you ! 
 We have a great variety of magazines all about cooking ! This one for example , is a bi monthly publication with recipes from all over the world ! 
 Sure do ! This one is a quarterly publication , but each issue has over 200 color pages of recipes and also many home decorating ideas ! 
 You mentioned you have a dog , most pet owners sign up for this weekly newsletter that has information on dog care , pet shops and even pet sitters ! 
 Well , I also have ... 
 Here you are . 
 Sure . I think filet steak will be a good choice . It's the best local food . 
 Why are you in court today ? 
 Is the officer that pulled you over here today ? 
 Tell me what happened . 
 The officer wouldn't lie about that . 
 There was no picture taken of your license plate ? 
 I'm just going to let you go . 
 Is that a no-smoking sign ? 
 What does that sign mean ? 
 How much is the admission fee for a student ? 
 Here you are . Where is the museum guide ? 
 Is it free ? 
 To start with , may I know why you are interested in working for our company ? 
 What was your chief responsibility in your past work ? 
 OK . Here's the final drawing ! It's for the trip ! 
 Our red underwear didn't do any good at all ! 
 So , what did you win ? 
 A bar of soap ! 
 Why don't you go talk to her and find out what her secret was this year . 
 I'd like to speak to the Ms . Collins , please . 
 this is Nathaniel Brown . 
 I'd like to talk to her about my accommodation situation . 
 ok . 
 sure . Can you have her call me back on my cell phone number ? 
 it's 0-7- 7-8- 7-3- 6-7- 6-8- 8 . 
 no , there's no double six at the of the number . It's just zero , double seven , eight , seven , three , six , seven , six , double eight . 
 anytime before 6 pm tonight . 
 thank you ! 
 bye ! 
 Mr . Smith is not in his office . I am afraid he will not be back before 3 pm . Would you care to speak to Mr . Brown who takes all the calls in his absence ? 
 OK , I'll tell him that you called . 
 Hello , I called earlier regarding interest rates on loans . Sorry , I just have a couple more questions . 
 What if I require a loan for a short period of time ? 
 Say , 6 months ? Or less in fact . I want to repay the loan ASAP ; I don't like debt hanging over my head . 
 What if I repay it early . Any perks ? 
 So , the quicker I pay it back , the more I can save in interest ? That's excellent . Thanks so much for your information . I'll come in shortly to take the relevant steps for the loan . 
 Can I reserve a hotel room ? 
 My name's John Sandals . 
 If my plans don't change , I'll need a room April 14 till April 17 . 
 Tell me how much it will be , and I can tell you if it's okay . 
 $ 308 a night ? That's a fair price . 
 Nonsmoking , please . 
 I have absolutely no problem with that . 
 Not a problem . The number is 626-555-1739 . 
 Hi , Mary , can I have a minute ? 
 Well , actually I want to tell you that I've put in notice . 
 Many reasons . I've been here for too long . Next year will be my five-year anniversary . I want a change of setting . Besides , our company is downsizing . I don't want to stay on just to be let go . 
 Maybe . But that's not kept the new boss from breathing down my neck . To be honest , I've got a better offer from another company . 
 Senior director of market research . In addition to a nice pay rise it has some nice perks , like a company car , one month paid vacation , and an apartment downtown . And it's an international company so I'll have lots of chances to travel and meet new people . I'm really looking forward to it . 
 Indeed . But let's stay in touch . I'll let you know how things go . 
 Hey ! A real cook gets down and dirty . Besides , I think I look good covered in baking mix ... 
 Well , your making cinnamon toast inspired me to go out and buy a waffle maker . 
 I know . You just add milk , eggs and a little oil to the baking mix and stir ... 
 Allow me to introduce my self.My name is Jack Black , manager of the company . 
 Pleasure is mine.Here ' s my card . 
 The May holiday is coming up soon . Are you planning on going on vacation ? 
 Where are you planning on going ? 
 I went a long time ago , before they built the new train that can take you there . 
 Personally , I think it ’ d be better to go when you have more time . A few days isn ’ t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital . 
 It ’ s a beautiful city , but I think it ’ s become too touristy . How about going to a cosmopolitan city like Shanghai or Hong Kong ? 
 Maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of Beijing . I heard they are very relaxing . 
 Since the May holiday is the high season , you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . Here ’ s the phone number . 
 Do you want to practice your driving right now ? 
 Are you buckled up ? 
 Start the car . 
 Take a left . 
 I'll tell you when to stop . 
 We're back now , so why don't you try parking ? 
 Jack , do say good-bye for me to the host . I've got to run . 
 My old man does not allow me to go back later than 11 p . m . Bye ! 
 Oh , hey , Keri ! You cook , right ! You're a pretty good cook . 
 OK . I want to make an omelet , so actually this is really silly , I've never made one before . How do you make an omelet ? 
 OK . Yeah ! Yeah ! 
 Oh , OK . Wow ! 
 Wow . That sounds really good . 
 Wow . What fillings do you recommend ? 
 Hi there ! I am looking for a new car . I have this old Ford Pinto that I would like to trade in . 
 Perfect ! I like this one . 
 Sounds like a good car ! How many miles to the gallon ? 
 That is really convenient . Especially now that fuel prices are so high ! What ’ s under the hood ? 
 Now for the most difficult question . What is the price tag for this lovely vehicle ? 
 Great ! Let ’ s do it ! 
 Yes , there are 62 in totals , and 2 of them still can't be sure . 
 6 . So we should give them special attention . Some of them don't have a good health . 
 2 should be enough , for each one has at least 30 seats . There will be some seats to spare . 
 Yes , most of them think it's good . But , some people have different opinions . They consider we should arrange some challenging activities . 
 That's good . I'll tell them later . And what kind of medicine we should be prepared ? 
 OK , we should get them ready this afternoon . 
 Oh , God . I've almost forgotten . I'll get it done right away . 
 I'd be glad to . 
 What do we have for the dinner now ? 
 Do you feed rabbits ? 
 Where is my favorite white bread ? Is it in refrigerator ? 
 Do you prepare some dessert for me ? 
 Are you trying to change our eating patterns ? 
 Let me check . It has a paper jam . 
 Be careful , the cartridge can be very hot . 
 A haircut and a shave , please . 
 Short on both sides . Not so much off at the back . 
 Yes , please . 
 Well . I would like my hair cut shorter on the temples . 
 Yes , thanks . 
 No , thanks . But I'd like a facial massage . 
 Now where should I pay the money ? 
 How are you doing today ? How many in your book today ? 
 Smoking or non ? 
 Right , this way , please . Something to drink first ? 
 Wold you like to see menu first or wait for your friends ? 
 Certainly , sir . If you need anything else , please let me know , and I'll be happy to get it for you right away . 
 I've looked at your units , and am very happy with them . Your goods are all far above standard quality . 
 Well , we're really interested in placing an order under negotiation . We can start the negotiations as soon as you want . 
 Fine . As well , would you mind if I asked to see the Loyd's surveyor report of your products ? I may have a few more questions about your quality analysis . 
 What ’ s the problem , Ms . Murphy ? 
 I ’ m sorry . Ms . Murphy . I ’ ll re-work it . Can I give it back to you this afternoon ? 
 I've got a Remittance Advice and I'd like to cash it . 
 Here you are . I'm here on business and this is from my boss , it's for my expenses so I need cash . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 Here's my passport . Is that OK ? 
 Is it really necessary to wear all this protective gear ? 
 How long will the tour take ? 
 Okay ... 
 I can drink ten cups in fifteen minutes . I ’ m sure . 
 Did you promise me to get the bread ? 
 But you forgot to get the bread . 
 Well , I certainly did . 
 You are free . You can go now . 
 I'll do with the cake . 
 Can we talk about the working overtime issue ? What ’ s on your mind ? 
 Glad to hear that . Generally , it is 2 to 3 hours more than your working hours . 
 Hello , can I speak to Mr.Green ? 
 This is Steven speaking . I'd like to buy a stock . 
 I'd like to buy 1 000 shares of Duson . 
 Let me see . The offering price is near or at $ 88 . 
 Do you mean that I have to buy it at current price ? 
 I heard that this stock would go up . Hum , I will take it at current price . 
 Yes , please . 
 I'd like to apply for a credit card with you . 
 Oh , I'm not sure . What's the difference ? 
 Why such a big difference ? 
 My salary is pretty high and I've never had a problem with my credit rating in the past . Are there any perks of the platinum card ? 
 That's great ; my health club membership is about to expire . 
 Is This where I pay the airport tax ? 
 I'm sorry , but I've never done this before . How many what ? 
 My wife and me . The two of us . 
 Oh , OK . Here's 200 yuan . 
 Thanks . What shall I do then ? 
 Oh , I guess I'm a little confused . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 I think so . 
 Yes , yes . I've got all of that here . 
 Check , check and check . 
 Yes , that's one of the main things we are interested in . When do you think I can get hold of this report ? 
 No problem , I'll settle that now . You can take it from my Business Account . 
 Can I take a look at one of those ? 
 Can I take a picture of you ? Seeing is believing . 
 I think I can figure this out . Let's see if this works as advertised . Say ' cheese ! ' 
 I think the quality of the photos will speak for themselves . 
 Let me see . I am sorry we just have sold it out . 
 I think so . Could I have you name , telephone number ? If we get one , I will call you . 
 Mom , I'm ready for school . 
 I don't have a fever , and I'm ready for my test . 
 I'm fine , Mom . I feel so much better . I want to go to school . I'm missing out on all the fun . 
 Let me go to school , please ! I'm sick of medicine , sick of soup , and sick of being sick ! 
 Take the No . 7 bus . There's a bus stop just over there . 
 Yes . No need to change . 
 I'd like to see some coats . Would you recommend me some of them ? 
 Which models do you sell the most ? 
 I like this style , but I don't like its color . Do you have this coat in yellow ? 
 It looks nice . 
 good afternoon , madam . How can I help you ? 
 first of all , we'll tailor a work-out plan according to your physical conditions and your personal needs . 
 well , we give each of our customers a qualified personal trainer . The trainer will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work-out plan . 
 since everyone is different , your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level . Then you'llbe taught all the necessary techniques to us 
 that depends . We offer membership for one month , half a year and one year . 
 wise decision . that is 400 yuan . You'll find it's totally worth it . 
 Excuse me , sir , since my train leaves at 16:00 . Have you a 3 - hour tour ? 
 Well , I have just missed the place . How long does the tour take ? 
 I hope so . 
 What's the difference ? 
 You must have bought many things in the mall ? 
 It's wise to do it . The Americans have the habit of selling their junk when they are moving to another place , so they usually display all the things they want to sell in their gardens at the weekend . And many things they are selling still look quite new and they are also very useful . 
 You must have got many useful things for your new apartment . 
 Oh , okay . I can get it back when I move out , right ? 
 All right . Here's the lease and the check for the deposit . 
 May I see that ivory horse ? 
 It's genuine , I bet . 
 I'll take it . 
 Thank you . I am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . You know information and knowledge in this field update very fast . 
 Yes , according to the agenda , there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course . 
 I will do my best . 
 Sorry , darling , I forgot . 
 I promise you'll have it tomorrow . 
 I want to get my car washed . 
 I don't know what you mean . 
 Do you wash windows ? 
 What about the interior ? 
 Sounds good , regular car wash package will be OK . 
 Have you been taken care of ? 
 Is there any special brand you'd like ? 
 The franchised store is on the second floor . 
 Do you want some dessert ? 
 Oh , here comes our waitress with our check . 
 Yes , the service was quite good . 
 How much do you think we should leave for a tip ? 
 I agree that 20 % would be just about right . 
 Yes , what a nice dinner that was ! 
 Taxi ! Taxi ! Could you help me load these luggage in the trunk ? 
 Over there . 
 I'm going to the hospital to see Susan . 
 Must I catch a number 7 bus to get there ? 
 Number 13 buses run much more frequently , don't they ? 
 Thank you , Henry . I'll get a number 13 . 
 Excuse me , Don ? I hate to bother you , but I need your help on something . Do you have time to brief me on the Martin account today ? 
 I hate to make you work through your lunch break with how busy you are ... 
 How about this ... We can make it a working lunch this afternoon , and I'll order some Chinese food for delivery . It'll be my treat . 
 I insist . I really appreciate you taking time to work with me in . What is your favorite fast food ? I'll cater to your taste . 
 Great . I'll bring the food . 
 Yes , sir . For what time ? 
 OK , sir . Five persons at 7:00 . 
 Sorry , sir . We have only tables in the main dinning room left . 
 Yes , the pain comes more intense when the weather is bad . And the pain comes intense when I walk too much . 
 Yes , I have . 
 Yes , ti does . Just like a needle prick . Besides , the place that hurts often feels cold , too . 
 Yes , I do . 
 By the way , does acupuncture hurt ? 
 Yes . Let's start today . 
 Yes . 
 Thank you for calling me . I will be there on time . 
 Bye . 
 Yes . I would like to go to New York for my Christmas vacation . 
 1 week . Would you recommend me scenic spots to see there ? 
 That's fantastic . 
 I think you'd better take the No . 16 bus . It can take you right there . 
 Every fifteen minutes . 
 The No . 2 bus also goes to the railway station . You may take it . 
 The bus stop is not far from here . Go straight on and you can easily find it . 
 You are welcome . 
 OK , may I have your key ? 
 Was everything satisfactory ? 
 You have stayed here for 3 nights , that's $ 230 . 
 No , it hasn't . It's very dirty . 
 Mark should clean it . It's his turn . 
 No , it isn't . You always clean it after Mark . 
 Clean it now . Only lazy people say they'll work tomorrow . 
 You are lazy . You ought to be ashamed ? You should enjoy working . 
 Yes , please . 
 Actually , I'd like a booth by the window if that's possible . 
 This will be fine , thanks . 
 Thank you . 
 I agree . And it's very convenient . 
 Really ? That's great ! I'm going to try that next time . 
 Can you tell me what happened here ? 
 Did you see the car before it hit you ? 
 Which lane were you in ? 
 What was your speed then ? 
 Which direction were you coming from ? And which direction were you going ? 
 OK , please move your vehicle off to the side of the road . We will check on it . Do you feel like you need an ambulance , Miss ? 
 No problem , Miss . 
 Yes . 
 I am afraid I can't attend the press conference due to an urgent conference with the Board of Directors at half past four . 
 Yes , thank you very much . In addition , do you have the marketing proposal ready ? 
 This shirt is really nice . 
 OK . I'll try on a medium size . 
 Where is the fitting room ? 
 It's too big tor me . Do you have a smaller one ? 
 Can I help you ? 
 Well , you heard right . You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here . We have great discounts for students . 
 Well , first let's consider your computer . Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend-the Power Macintosh G3 . it comes with 64 megabytes of total memory . 
 Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have . What department are you in ? 
 Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing . We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your hardware first . We have a special deal on right now . I should tell you about it , as it only goes until next Tuesday . If you buy one of these fifteen-inch color monitors with a Power Macintosh G3 , you can actually get 30 percent off the usual sale price . 
 Yes . 
 Yes . It's an excellent system . 
 Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Mcintosh and Apple are the same thing . 
 I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment . 
 Yes . 
 That's not true . Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh . They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . May I ask where you're from ? 
 Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular . But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used . 
 There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh . Chinese is no problem for Apple . 
 No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends . But believe me , most of the students here in the university-Asian students included-most of them use Apple . 
 You're very welcome . Here is my card , if you need any help . 
 Yes , I did . By the way , in case there is a flaw in this CD player , can I return it ? 
 Is there a charge for that . I know other stores have a restocking fee . 
 Thank you . 
 Thanks . I'll put it in a safe place . 
 How many pieces of baggage have you lost ? 
 Can you tell me the features of your baggage ? 
 Don't worry . We will look it for you right now . 
 What kind of jobs have you had ? 
 How did your previous employers treat you ? 
 What have you learned from the jobs your have had ? 
 When you worked in your previous company , which did you prefer , working with other people or by yourself ? 
 My name is Steven Smith and I'm calling to cancel my plane ticket . 
 It ’ s 7 p . m . today . 
 I need to continue to deal with my business . I haven ’ t finished it yet . 
 No . Thank you . 
 OK . I will pay it by my bank card . 
 Sure.It will depart 2 hours later . 
 That's $ 150 . 
 Of course.Right now it is the slack season , we will give you ten percent off . 
 I am sorry , there is no difference . 
 I ’ m looking for a job . Are you hiring ? 
 Superintendent . 
 Do you have any other positions available ? 
 What is it ? 
 Can I apply for it right now ? 
 Did you hear about that accident on the 5 ? There was a sixty-two-car pile up . 
 Early this morning . 
 Yeah . And a semi jack-knifed trying to miss a stalled car in the fast lane . You can imagine what happened after that . 
 The count is up to seven right now and several are in critical condition . 
 Are you OK there ? 
 Can I help ? 
 Year ! They are unreliable sometimes . 
 What part hurts ? 
 Well , maybe you broke it . But what I'm worried about is this cut . 
 C'mon . Just don't move . 
 We don't have a decent First Aid Kit , do we ? 
 There's some tape , iodine , and cloth bandages . I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . What we need is a tourniquet . 
 Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut . 
 Alright , alright . How did you cut this so bad ? 
 We'll have to get you to a hospital . I can ride you on the back of my bike . 
 Yes , I almost slid too.Alright . This tourniquet is tight . How does it feel ? 
 Alright , I'm twisting it around . You tell me when to stop . 
 Excuse me sir.May I come in ? 
 I'm sorry , but my sister was ill , so I 
 But it's true . 
 That's coincidence 。 
 I promise I will . 
 What's combined transportation ? 
 Why is it necessary ? 
 So , tell me , what makes you think we should give you a raise ? 
 Salaries are confidential , how do you know how much money these " other people " make ? 
 Those are company cars provided to the sales staff for their business trips . Also , some employees receive sales commissions . So good salesmen will naturally earn more . 
 I see your point . However , it might be hard to get a raise approved . Profits were down last quarter , and the whole company is tightening its belt , so anything that affects the annual budget 
 Waiter , can you come here for a moment ? 
 I'm afraid you've made a mistake . This isn't what I ordered . 
 And also this soup is cold . 
 I have been looking at this online catalog for over an hour and I still haven ’ t finished getting all the kitchen appliances that we need ! 
 Well , the first thing on my list is a new blender . I decided to also get a juicer and a new coffee maker . 
 Yeah I know . I also decided to throw away the old toaster and get a new one . I am also getting a rice cooker and steamer to make some nice steamed fish or veggies . 
 That ’ s a good idea ! The kitchen will look amazing ! 
 I need some help catching up . Are you good at typing or could you help me xerox ? 
 Thank you ! There are papers on the table to start with . 
 I really appreciate the help . How many years have you been with the company ? 
 I have a special assignment coming up . Would you be interested in helping me on it ? 
 I'll make sure that management keeps you in mind for special projects in the future . Thanks for the help ! 
 I'm going to be studying overseas next year and I'd like some info about suitable loans . To be honest , I'm not even sure if I can get a loan . 
 Would I have to get my parents to guarantor the loan ? 
 I see . What about age limitations ? 
 Got it ! I fit into that category very nicely . That's great ! I'll have a chat with my parents and come back . Thanks very much . 
 Are you sure ? How do you know ? 
 Well , I heard that if you drink enough beer , you can speak foreign languages better ... 
 Maybe ... 
 Hello there . I need to buy some foreign currency for a business trip . How much can I exchange ? 
 OK , well , I'm going to Europe . I guess 1,000 USD will be sufficient for now . 
 What ’ s wrong ? 
 Oh no ! That ’ s terrible ! 
 What happened ? 
 What are you going to do ? 
 Hello . miss . I am wondering if there is a meal served on this flight . 
 Well , I would like a glass of warm water . 
 Not at all . I was born in Madrid , but I came to the States when I was a teenager . 
 No , I haven ’ t been back for more than ten years . 
 Well , I'd like to buy a watch . 
 Yeah . But I think I'd prefer ... 
 Mm , yes , but I think I like that one better . It's made of gold , isn't it ? 
 How much is it ? 
 I wonder if it keeps good time . 
 How do I set it ? 
 All right . this suits my taste best . I'II take It . 
 We should be there by 5 this afternoon . 
 Well , it all depends on traffic from other arriving aircraft . 
 I taught English in a primary school in Beijing . 
 I am equipped with much experience in teaching for more than 30 years and I also edit teaching materials by myself . 
 Yes.You can use the computer to seta tima.Dial 10 and then time.For example.if you want to get up at 7:15 , you can dial 100715 . 
 Or we can call you tomorrow coming . 
 No problem . Good night . 
 Yes . But you have to transfer to Bus No . 28 . 
 At Tinge Depot . 
 I will remind you to get off . 
 My pleasure . 
 Yes , I'd like to move to another room . 
 Yes . The air-conditioner in this room doesn't work . 
 Wang Wei . Room 1212 . 
 All right . 
 Yes . No problem . 
 Yes , I have found three companies . 
 Yes , but the results are not so satisfying . 
 I asked the first company about the vacancy , but they had already hired someone . 
 The second one told me that the job information was released half a year ago , and had been overdue . 
 The last company is still hiring , but not recent graduates . 
 I feel terrible now . 
 Thanks for your support and care . 
 Please , call my John . Well , there ’ s a subway stop and bus station just around the corner . Do you have children ? 
 Well , in that case , the schools in this area are very good . 
 Oh , well . As far as other conveniences in the neighborhood , there ’ s a grocery store just up the block , and there ’ s lots of little shops nearby . 
 Here ’ s my card , just give me a call if you ’ re interested . 
 It depends where you live , sir . 
 Yes , we deliver there . But it costs two pounds fifty . 
 Morning or afternoon ? 
 Wow , this is the famous Empire State Building . 
 Would you like to go to the top ? 
 The view is breathtaking . 
 No , my company makes cameras.Well , I'm also a photographer , but two of these are for our display . 
 Egg tarts . 
 I thought you meant vegetables and meat when you asked me . Things like that . I don't have any vegetables . 
 Confiscate ? 
 It's too bad . They are very delicious . 
 Oh , well . Not by me . 
 Thank you . 
 What ! 
 Don't you dare tell me that ... 
 Well , they should have called you ! 
 And you didn't think to leave them my cell phone ? 
 It's the holidays ! Everybody knows how hard it is to get tickets ! 
 Trust you ! You can't even handle simple plane reservations ! 
 That way they look longer . 
 Putting on mascara . 
 I won't . 
 Are you ready to go shopping ? 
 Good idea . Have you written down tea , eggs and potatoes ? 
 Let's just get both . Do you bring enough money ? 
 Hi , Jane . How are you doing this morning ? 
 Late night ? 
 My car has broken down . Could someone come right away and check it ? 
 I am on Route 80 , a few miles east of the University of Utah . 
 It is a red Audi . 
 Didn't you just eat ? 
 We ate everything from dinner . 
 What are you going to make ? 
 Go make a sandwich . 
 Why don't you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ? 
 Maybe you should . 
 Yes , madam . I graduated from Tianjin College of Finance and Trade three years ago . 
 I took Accounting as my major . 
 I was in charge of cost price and sales revenue . 
 There are two reasons for me to do it . First , I'm sure that there will be more opportunities for advancement If I enter your enterprise . Secondly , I'd like to acquaint myself with American culture if possible . 
 Yes , madam . I know that I'll be expected , first of all , to work hard if I'm hired . 
 Yes , please . 
 I would like vegetable soup , please 
 Shrimp salad . And what kind of pie do you have ? 
 Then a piece of apple pie , please . 
 Icecream , please . 
 orange 
 Waiter , the meat is overdone . 
 Is it ? 
 Welcome to our bar ! 
 Here is the wine list . 
 What would you like ? 
 What about cocktail ? 
 I recommend Mao Tai , it's the best liquor in China . 
 Here you are , sir . 
 Johnny , are you just sitting around again ? 
 I'd say all you've done is moved the dirt from the windows on to your face and hands . Disgraceful ! 
 Your best isn't good enough . Back in my day , I'd clean a whole hospital with a toothbrush and spit , and it'd be twice as clean as this sty ! 
 Have you been feeling OK lately ? 
 Has anyone ever told you that you had high blood pressure ? 
 People with high blood pressure seldom know they have it , which is why we call it the silent killer . 
 We will pump air into this cuff to get a reading . 
 It tells me how hard your heart pumps blood and how much your arteries relax at rest . 
 Hello , sir . Can I help you ? 
 What size are you looking for ? 
 How about this one ? 
 What color do you like ? 
 How about that one ? 
 Sure . There is a changing room behind you . 
 There isn't much rice , is there ? 
 Are there any potatoes ? 
 I'm very hungry , Donald . What can I eat ? 
 But I want some rice and some meat . 
 Good . By the way , who's going to cook the meat ? 
 Have you read the new rules about using cell phone at work ? 
 Well , but for this one , don ’ t bring your cell phone to meetings , I think it is not reasonable . What if there are some important calls ? 
 I didn ’ t pay attention to that . 
 No , thank you . I don't need any . You see , I'm on a diet . 
 Yes , coffee , please . 
 Have you just started getting a lot of headaches ? 
 Have you had any unusually stressful situations in your life lately ? 
 I ’ m sorry . How about sleep ? Are you getting enough rest ? 
 Have you bumped your head or fallen lately ? 
 I am going to send you to a neurologist for a few tests . 
 I will , mom . Don ’ t worry . 
 Sure ! I can help you . Do you know where the timesheets are kept ? 
 Well , once you get one off the shelf over there , you first put your name on it . OK ? 
 Now you have to fill in the hours in the blanks and total the hours for the week . Do you know how to use military time ? 
 OK , so we just start counting hours at midnight and record it . Show all minutes as a dot and then write how many minutes . OK ? 
 After you total your hours , make sure you sign it and turn it in to your supervisor . 
 Good luck and let me know if you need any help later on . 
 Fill it up with regular , please . 
 No , thanks . I'm in a hurry . 
 Good ! How much is it ? 
 That is expensive . 
 OK darling , I got some pizzas , potato chips , hot dogs and lots of cheese ! 
 Humph ! Right , so what did you get ? 
 Organic ? What ’ s organic ? Do we need organic carrots ... ? 
 Oh , so organic vegetables are the ‘ green ’ option , right ? 
 Wait a minute , what's that ? ... Doughnuts ? They organic doughnuts , Kelly ? 
 Have you packed our passports ? 
 Of course . Otherwise I cannot go abroad . 
 Not at all . But we do need to keep it with us all the time . 
 Good morning , sir . Have a seat please . 
 Sure , here is my business card . I'm James Wilson . Let me explain to you how things are . In recent months , the demand for residential properties has become extremely high . The price of residential properly has risen almost twenty percent . 
 Don't worry , sir . I think it's a seller's market right now . Let me get down some information about your apartment first . what is your property's address ? 
 What is the square footage of your property ? How many bedrooms and living rooms ? 
 What is the orientation and view ? 
 The market price for Tong House is around five thousand Hong Kong dollars per square foot , but it also depends on the internal layout and condition of the house . 
 May I have your name and contact number , Sir ? 
 Thank you , Mr . Johnson . May I ask you one more question ? When will your property become available ? 
 Also , Mr . Johnson , I would like to remind you my company will charge a commission equivalent to one percent of the transaction price in the event of a successful selling of the property through our introduction . 
 Thank you very much . I will introduce your property to our clients . When they want to see your property , I will give you a call . 
 Which movie is your favorite to watch ? 
 Is that right ? Why ? 
 You're right . That movie is hilarious . 
 I went to see it the day it came out . 
 I couldn't help laughing , either . 
 I bought the movie . Would you like to come to my house and watch it ? 
 Have you been taken of , miss ? 
 We have quite a variety of shirts here . 
 Silk . You have a good taste . It's excellent for its handiness , elegance and beauty . 
 Good morning . I want to apply for a job in A your company as an assistant . Could you tell me the company address , please ? 
 Yes , please . 
 Are you being served , Sir ? 
 Would you sit here , please ? How would you like it cut ? 
 What , your short already , sir . 
 Should I just trim it ? 
 Oh , I see . You like Chinese style , don ’ t you ? 
 Would you like to have some shampoo , sir ? 
 How about oil or spray ? 
 There , how ’ s that ? 
 Are there any interesting articles in today ’ s newspapers ? 
 Is there anything of interest to us in the business sections ? 
 Are the reports favorable ? 
 That ’ s interesting . They must be thinking of moving into that market . Are there any interesting editorials ? 
 I ’ m not surprised . That article certainly added fuel to the debate . Ok . Thanks . Can you leave two articles and the advertisements with me ? I ’ d like to read them . 
 I want to get some cable . 
 What packages do you have ? 
 What else have you got ? 
 Is there a package with basic and movie channels ? 
 Let me get that package . 
 That's everything , but can I add channels later ? 
 Would you please wait this letter to see with the postages ? 
 By ordinary airmail please . 
 A post order for four hundred dollars . 
 Will I be informed that my friend gets the letter ? 
 All right . I have a registered then . 
 Why ? it doesn't make sense . If we do the floors first , and then paint the walls , we will get paint all over our new floor . 
 Are you sure ? 
 Alright . Then maybe we can do the floor first . These wood floors under this carpet are beautiful . And me too — — I can't wait to get all this old carpet out of here . But how can we get it out ? Do we have to hire someone ? 
 Great . Then , after we remove the carpet , we need to redo all the wood floors . Right ? 
 And then , after the floors are done , we can start to move our furniture in . 
 What are we going to eat for dinner ? 
 I thought you were making dinner tonight . 
 Your food tastes so much better than mine . 
 You really want me to cook tonight ? 
 No problem . 
 Would you like me to come get you when the food is done ? 
 Jim , could you do me a favor ? 
 My car has a problem starting . Could you please take a look at it for me ? 
 Are you sure ? 
 Thanks for helping me out . I really appreciate it . 
 Personal Finance Department , Lucie speaking , how may I help ? 
 That's no problem . What exactly would you like to know ? 
 We have a wonderful new service which provides a wide range of banking services , 24/7 , wherever you are . 
 What would you like to drink ? 
 Forget about the coke . Let's drink some wine , shall we ? 
 What would you prefer ? Red wine or white ? 
 Excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the Cross Bakery building ? 
 Oh , you're kidding ! I thought I was heading east . 
 Okay , let me see if I've got that . I need to go down Elm until I hit Broadway , then I make a left and the building is on my left hand side . Is that right ? 
 Thanks for the offer , but I think I've got it . Hopefully , I won't get lost again on my way there ! 
 This is Mary speaking . Who is that ? 
 Yes , I do , but today I went shopping and have only just come back . It is very nice to hear your voice , Bob . I didn ’ t know you were in New York . 
 Yes , I am going to meet a client . 
 I am sorry , Bob . If you had told me you were coming up , I would have kept tonight free . But you didn ’ t tell me . 
 I thought Henry usually did the conferences . 
 I ’ m free tomorrow but I suppose that will be too late . 
 I ’ d like to . But Bob , are you sure it will be all right ? I would hate you to make your boss angry or even lose your job . 
 Why did you stay an extra night in Boston ? What happened ? 
 See you tomorrow . 
 Do you have reservations ? 
 Very Wang sir , smoking or no smoking ? 
 Of course , this way please . 
 That cup is for a urine sample . 
 This particular test calls for you to urinate into the cup after you have urinated a little into the toilet . 
 You need to leave the cup in the cubby in the restroom , and the lab tech will get it from the other side . 
 If there are bacteria in your urine , it could mean an infection somewhere . 
 Your doctor will be contacting you with the results . 
 I ’ m going to down town . 
 My boy wants me to buy a toy , so I think I ’ d better satisfy him . 
 There is none now because he likes to destroy toys . 
 Yes , I am annoyed by this , too . 
 Yes , I think so . 
 How do you choose which companies to work with ? 
 Do you think I could use your car tomorrow ? I ’ Ve got a date with this girl , see ? And ... 
 Nine thirty ? That ’ s no good . Couldn ’ t I have it a bit longer ? Even if I fill up the tank ? 
 Welcome to Game World . What can I do for you ? 
 Sure . This one here just came out . It's got great 3D graphics and a cool story line . It's also got a multiplayer function so you can play against other people on the Internet . 
 This one is also really cool . It's a sci-fi game in which you have to stop an alien invasion . The graphics on this one are spectacular . 
 Hello , this is Peter Dixon from NEZ news radio . May I speak to Mr . Wilson please ? 
 Good morning , Mr . Wilson . I ’ m calling to confirm the date of the next interview program . 
 Excuse me , I'm looking for your 3 - liter Pepsis , the ones that are on sale this week . There don't seem to be any in the soft drink section . 
 Yes , I would , thank you . 
 Tom , this is Mary Bobbins . She ’ s just come over from sales . 
 Yes , she ’ ll be working closely with you on the marketing end of things . 
 I'd like to pick up my package . 
 Could you show me your ID , Please ? 
 A moment , please . 
 Same here , Ms . Drake . I've been looking forward to this . 
 No , no , no , not at all , you were right on time . I was early . I hope I didn ’ t rush you . I ’ m glad for the opportunity to interview with you . 
 I ’ m fine , thank you . 
 Great , that ’ s why I ’ m here . 
 ( beep ) This is Miriam Lavalle – that's spelt L , A , V , A , L , L , E . It's about an appointment I made with Simon Meredith . I'm afraid I'm going to have to change it . Can you call me ? The number is 01563 566 770 . Thank you . 
 We have a three-shift system - that's three eight-hour shifts each weekday . We're shut at weekends . This week I'm on the early shift . 
 Yes , sometimes . I don't like working nights I have problems sleeping during the day . 
 We're going to pay by check . 
 If you think it is necessary . 
 OK , no problem . 
 Yeah . Can I look at this ring ? 
 I believe I am a six . 
 Would you have any necklace that would go well with this ? 
 There's no price tag on this necklace . 
 This necklace is a little short . Do you have one that is longer ? 
 This one is much better . Can I try on the ring with this necklace ? 
 Let me think about it . 
 Thank you for all the help . 
 Do you want an IBM-compatible PC or a Macintosh ? 
 Well , what do you plan to use your computer for ? 
 Then a PC should be enough . Macintoshes are better for graphics , but they also cost a bit more . 
 I'd like to buy a pair of leather shoes . 
 Size 38 or 39 . 
 But they are a little tight , They Pinch . 
 I know.But can you show me a little larger size ? 
 This pair fits me perfectly . I feel comfortable . 
 NO ! 
 Okay , okay , what do you want ? 
 Um .. I don ’ t think so . I need the car tonight to pick up your mother . 
 Who's this Eric guy ? 
 No can do ... sorry . 
 No way ! 
 What ’ s up ? 
 Yes , . Do you mind I have a look at your computer ? 
 Well , it has nothing to do with virus . The problem is your attachment is a bit larger . It has exceeded the e-mail capacity . 
 You can send a compressed one . 
 The salmon is good toady , it's very fresh . 
 It's cooked with lemon and savored with rice . 
 You're meal also include soup and salad . 
 French onion soup , sir , what dressing would you like for your salad ? 
 Don't throw paper on the floor , Bill . 
 Put it in the waste-paper basket , please . 
 In that case , take the basket outside and empty it . 
 Where did you empty the basket , Bill ? 
 Silly boy ! The dustbin is at the back of the school . Now pick up the paperand put it in the dustbiri . 
 No , I'm not . 
 I was just robbed ! 
 Someone just robbed me . 
 He took all my things , but he didn't hurt me . 
 I need to make a statement at the police station . 
 Thanks . 
 Of course . 
 With pleasure . I think we should go to the palace first . 
 Listen , Karen , I need your help . I don't know anyone here yet . 
 My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L.A.Hank and I will be flying there tonight . 
 Doctors aren't sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her . 
 Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights . 
 I don't want to do that to you , Karen . 
 Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days . 
 I'd like to talk with her.This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight . 
 I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older . 
 Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free . 
 Er ... Hum ... Got it . 
 Right ! 
 I see what you mean . That was pretty easy after all . 
 They will be ready this afternoon . 
 Is that right ? We are very sorry 
 I ’ m afraid ... be can returned by eleven o ’ clock . 
 Yes , we ’ ll do so . 
 The Scholar ? Let me see . Oh ... yes , Of course I know . It ’ s in the Lincoln Square . 
 Oh , yes . It ’ s just a few minutes walk . Turn left at the traffic light , and you ’ ll see it . 
 Good morning , sir . Can I help you ? 
 Please fill out this deposit form , first . 
 No , that's fine . Do you bring your bankbook with you ? 
 Wait a moment , please . 
 Is there anything else I can do for you ? 
 The deposit rate is 0.8 % every month . 
 Excuse me , doc . I am not feeling well . Can you help me ? 
 No , I haven't . Where do I go for that ? 
 Yes . 
 No , I'm here all by myself . 
 But I don't know where the registration office is . 
 Do I have to come back here after getting registered ? 
 Gynecology ? 
 I really appreciate your driving me around . 
 It would be hard for just me to do it . I don't know the city at all . 
 This one sounds good.Efficiency with view of the lake.Utilities and parking included . Newly remodeled kitchen . $ 470 . 
 No , I guess not . But that's what I want , isn't it ? An efficiency . 
 How about this one ? Downtown efficiency . Furnished ... What does furnished mean ? 
 That's good . 
 Furnished . Parking included . $ 400 . 
 Yes , but it's downtown . I would like to take look at this one . 
 256-7797 . 
 This one . Two male grad students seeking roommate.Must be quiet . Comfortable downtown apartment.Does this mean I have to share a room with them ? 
 That sounds alright . 
 Here's the number , 256-4367 . 
 Sounds good to me . I really appreciate your help on this . 
 I have a sore throat and my chest hurts . 
 Two or three days now . 
 What do you think I ought to do ? 
 I'm going crazy . 
 I've got a dozen things to do and they all have to be done immediately . 
 Excuse me , Miss . I feel like vomiting . Can I bother you for some ice water , please ? 
 Fine , please . 
 Thank you very much for your kindness . 
 Come to think of it , there is one rule in this house , Mary . 
 When you go out with friends , I don't want you to stay out too late . 
 We maintain a curfew for Cindy because she's just 16 . 
 You can stay out till 10 p . m . 
 Then you call me or Tom first . 
 It's the key for the safety deposit box . 
 You're welcome , glad to be of assistance . 
 I want to buy a skirt , but I have no idea which one to buy . 
 I don't like to keep up with joneses . 
 I think this suits me . Can I try it on ? 
 Is everything OK ? 
 What exactly seems to be the matter ? 
 Do you think that you should go to the Student Health Center ? 
 Do you need someone to drive you home ? 
 Well , go home and rest up . Make sure you check the website for your assignments . 
 yes , but I didn't really like the third one at all . 
 yeah . Even though the customs were brilliant , I didn't think it was as good as the first two . What did you think ? 
 did you read the books before you watched the movies ? 
 yes , I've read them many times . I think it's much easier to follow for people who were already familiar with all the characters . 
 I also think that it was much better in the theatre than at home . 
 that happens a lot in non-English speaking countries . 
 actually , they not only had 11 nominations , but they won 11 Oscars , too ! 
 A double cheeseburger sounds good . 
 Yes , please . 
 I would love large curly fries . 
 Yes , let me have a medium Pepsi . 
 Yeah , that's it . Thank you . 
 Here you go . Thank you very much . 
 What ’ s that ? 
 Oh , sorry . I ’ ll put it out . 
 Wonderful . That's a place famous for its arts . 
 Surely it will be . By the way , when will we get there ? 
 Hi ! What are you watching ? 
 Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ? 
 Why do they go there ? 
 When muslims pray , they face towards mecca . 
 I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone . 
 Pilgrimages are common in many faiths . 
 Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ? 
 Do you think that there is something magical about that place ? 
 Very good . Now , I have a couple of final questions . 
 Well , why should we hire you ? 
 Impressive ! So , what would you consider to be your greatest weakness ? 
 Great ... Well , let me tell you that I am very pleased with this interview . We are short-listing our candidates this week , and next week we will inform our short listed candidates of the day and time for a second interview with our CEO . 
 Wow . That girl who brings the fruit is really pretty ! I wish she wouldn't have rushed off so fast ... 
 " Tie a Yellow Ribbon on the Old Oak Tree " ? ! Where did you learn that song ? 
 I'm sorry , but I can't ! That's something my grandmother would sing ! 
 It will be fine . 
 No , don't give it another thought . 
 Good . 
 Splendid . 
 That's an excellent idea . 
 Yes , you're at the right stop . 
 Are you new here ? 
 Have you got small change ? They require exact fare . 
 One yuan . When you get on the front of the bus , just drop your money into the box . 
 It runs every ten minutes . Oh , here comes the bus . 
 I am sorry , sir , it's not allowed . 
 Of course . You can get it at the entrance . 
 Welcome to our Colonial Tramcar Restaurant , ma'am . Where would you like to sit ? 
 All right . Come with me , please . Here is your seat , ma'am . Would you like to order now ? 
 What would you like for a drink ? 
 What kind ? 
 Would Chablis be all right ? 
 What would you have for a la cane ? 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 Oh , this way please.What size do you wear ? 
 How about this one ? 
 All right . I'll show you something darker.Do you like this one ? 
 Of course.Let me help you . 
 $ 280 . 
 What kind of jobs have you had ? 
 How many years have you worked as a Production Manager ? 
 Would you like to tell me something about your outstanding achievements ? 
 Wonderful . Then how many employers have you worked for ? 
 Then have you received any award at your present company ? 
 How would you evaluate the company you are with ? 
 How would your colleagues evaluate you ? 
 Can you get recommendations from your present employers ? 
 Do you have any questions ? 
 This is our best product . 
 They'll be done before the end of the week . 
 Doctor , may I ask my mother ’ s condition ? 
 Oh my god . Please save her life . 
 I see , D . But I plead you to help her . 
 How long do you expect her to live ? 
 Well , It ’ s not as crowded as we excepted , is it ? 
 Yes , Let ’ s . 
 That ’ s a good idea . 
 Yes , of course.Would you like to walk there or take a bus ? 
 It's just about ten minutes ' walk . Go along this street , on the third cross you'll find it on your left . 
 Not at all . 
 The price quoted is for CIF . 
 Yes , that is correct . We will arrange for the shipping costs and insurance policy . 
 Yes , we could also make this arrangement , , if you prefer . 
 That looks good . The room in the picture is bigger than your bedroom , so you wouldn ’ t be able to put all the furniture in your room . 
 You would fit both of them in your bedroom . Perhaps you could also get the dressing table . I think that one would look good in your bedroom . 
 Everything in this magazine seems expensive . You could probably find something similar in a discount furniture store . 
 You can get cheap carpets easily . Another idea is to buy a rug . That would cover a lot of the carpet and you wouldn ’ t have to replace the carpet . It would save you a lot of work . 
 Excuse me , can you tell me where the breakfast cereals are ? 
 Are the snack foods in that area , too ? 
 Okay , I'll go take a look . Thank you so much for your help . 
 How are you , Mr . Stone ? I m Farley .

 No probation is involved . 
 No , thank you . I don't like soup . I'd rather have some fruit juice to start with . 
 Meat , I think . 
 I do , but I want meat . 
 Yes , but I prefer red wine with meat . 
 I just want to have a coffee , I think . 
 No , thanks . I'd like to go straight home . I'm very tired . 
 Just over a year I think . Why , what's the problem ? 
 I think the guarantee's just run out . Let me check . Oh , it's OK . We took out an extended warranty , it runs until next March . 
 Can I help you ? 
 uh ... Yes . Turn right , then take the second turning on your left . 
 It ’ s about fifteen minutes ’ walk . That ’ s all . 
 Yes . It ’ s on this street . Keep walking for two blocks and it ’ s on the corner on the right . 
 You are welcome . Good luck .

 Ok , Mum . I will not fail the examination next time . 
 How nice ! Are you going to convert some RIB to US dollars ? 
 How can you cash them when you arrive in the United States ? 
 It sounds quite simple . Next time when I travel abroad , I will apply for this kind of check too . 
 I'm trying to choose a gift . 
 No , but I'd like to get something typical in this region . 
 They're quite nice . But I'm afraid they're quite a bit expensive . 
 No more than one hundred yuan . 
 Oh ! It's perfect . I think I'll take it . Would you wrap it , please ?

 Let ’ s go to Chicago . We can have lunch in Chinatown . Then we can go to a ball game at Wrigley Field !

 All right . Thank you very much for your help . 
 Dear fellows . As you know , Mr . Ross will be leaving us very soon after his short but meaningful visit to our company .

 No problem.madam.But I think the red sweater is not colorfast.Would you like to have it dry cleaned ? 
 I will bring them to your room tomorrow afternoon .

 But very much quicker.But I know we'll never agree on this subject.You prefer the car . I prefer the train .

 Now have you ever thought of going by express bus ? 
 An old book Death on the Nile.Have you read it ? 
 Sure.But you need to be patient . 
 Wait a minute . I will get him here . Sorry , he is busy doing something . Why don't you give him a ring later ? 
 You are welcome . 
 I expect to be paid according to my abilities . 
 That's a little less than I expected . But to me , the most important thing is the job and the people I will work with . Moreover , I am sure I will get a raise quickly depending on my background and experience . 
 By the way , how long is my probation ? 
 Are utilities included in the rent ? 
 Do I have to pay for electricity myself ? 
 Would you please explain for me what a business contract implies ? 
 What are the purposes of contract ? 
 When we draft a contract , which points should we pay special attention to ? 
 What can I do for you ? 
 You begin by applying for a corporate charter . And then stockholders hold a meeting to organize the corporation , an individual has limited liability and the right . 
 OK .

 Do you need anything else from me ? 
 No problem . How much ? If I don't have enough on me , I'll pop over to the ATM and draw some . 
 I think I can manage that . Let's see ... yes , here we are . 
 Not yet . I seem to move my house to that place . You don't know how tight the schedule is for this trip . 
 Correct ! I have three-day visit to Shanghai on December 10th .

 Great . What do you suggest we see ? 
 The exhibits are really special . I enjoy the paintings very much . 
 Some places aren't good to go.But I can show you the right bus to take . It will be no problem . 
 I have never done that myself . But I hear it is very interesting . You two should go . 
 Yes , but I'm very busy with work.And you know how it is , sometimes people don't visit the tourist sites in their own country . 
 May I have your order , please ? 
 OK . How do you like your steak , do you like it rare , medium or well done ? 
 Anything else ? 
 It will be ready right away . 
 Right over there . 
 I loved it . I'll take it . 
 Here you go ? 
 No I don't . 
 Not today . Thanks though . 
 Sure . 
 Yeah . I was looking at some of your pants , but they are all a bit too long . Do you have alteration services here ? 
 Great . Thanks for your help . 
 Don ’ t be angry with them . After all , they are still children . 
 If I were you , I would not put crime in their doing these thing . We should encourage our children to do what they like , so long as they are not far off track . 
 Hello , Mr . Macmillan . 
 Much better , thanks . 
 Hey , The Cosby Show is on ! 
 That's right . 
 I'm watching reruns of it . 
 That means our local TV station is showing old episodes . You can watch reruns of nearly every old sitcom . 
 Thank you for returning my call . 
 I wanted to have a talk with you about your son . 
 He was messing around last week in class . 
 Even though I asked him not to , he kept speaking out in class . 
 I need you to talk to him , if you don't mind . 
 Thank you . Hopefully I won't have to call about him again . 
 I had meetings back to back all morning . Then the printer broke in the middle of putting together the Six Soap presentation , and the phone rang off the hook from the minute I walked into the office . 
 I can ’ t believe it ! I guess I ’ ll be here until ten again tonight ! 
 I think meeting people . There are people from all over the country , all over the world , all walks of life which is the most interesting part of my job . 
 Well , I work very long hours , ten hours a day is quite normal . And if something important comes up , I ’ m often in the office until 8 or 9 in the evening . 
 I like fishing too . I usually fish near the lake . 
 What a shame . 
 The mangoes are on sale today . 
 They have yellowish red skin . It's a fruit with one big seed . 
 Maybe if you were a parrot . I wouldn't recommend it . 
 Normally , they're $ 2 each . Today , they're only $ 1 each . 
 It's hard to describe . They're sweet , but also sort of citrusy . 
 They're similar to an avocado . When the outside feels soft , they're ripe . 
 These are from Mexico . 
 What seems to be the problem ? 
 What is bothering you ? 
 Would you like someone to walk you over to the Student Health Center ? 
 Do you need a ride home ? 
 OK , then , hope you feel better soon . Check your e-mail for missed assignments . 
 I'll put them in my schedule . Are there any other messages ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 we ’ Ve got a lot of work to do now , but take your time over this project . We don ’ t want to make any mistakes . 
 that ’ s right . We ’ ll finish them just in time . The Macy project can wait for the time being . We need to spend several days on that project , but it isn ’ t due to be finished until the end of the month , s 
 I ’ m going to give everyone on the team an extra day off . Everyone deserves it . 
 that ’ s true . Right . I ’ m going back to the meeting . It ’ s been going on for hours and there ’ s no indication that it ’ ll end soon . 
 good . I have to go right now . I really hope this meeting doesn ’ t last too long . 
 I ’ ll stop by if I have time later . Make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines . 
 Hello . I need to reserve a room . 
 Of course . I'm John Sandals . 
 Right now . I plan to be there in April from the 14th to the 17th . 
 Maybe . How much is a room ? 
 That sounds fine to me . 
 I hate cigarettes ! Nonsmoking . 
 That'll be no problem . 
 Sure ! My number is 626-555-1739 . 
 Good morning , madam . 
 May I help you ? 
 This way , please . 
 You're welcome . 
 I ’ m in , let ’ s go ! 
 Geez ! What ’ s the rush ? 
 Are you nuts ! I ’ m not going to run a red light ! 
 What ’ s your problem ! Geez . Having a fit is not going to help ! 
 I ’ m going as fast as I can ! 
 You ’ re such a geek ! 
 Of course ! 
 My vote was for Barack Obama . 
 I had no doubt in my mind that he would win . 
 Nobody could compete with him . 
 Times are changing . 
 I support our new President 100 % . 
 I told you so . I kept having problems with it yesterday . I don't know what's wrong . 
 Here . Keep the change . 
 You're welcome . By the way , is there a pay phone near here ? 
 Yes , I do . Thank you . 
 Could I speak to Diana Curzon ? 
 This is John Laing from Dantons . 
 Yes , please . I'm actually returning her call . So perhaps you could tell her that I called . 
 She must have , but let me give it to you anyway . It's 01705 455623 . 
 455623 . 
 That's right . 
 Thank you . 
 I'm watching TV . 
 I will . 
 So how did your end-of-the-year review go ? 
 Did he actually say that ? 
 Are you sure you're not reading too much into what he said ? 
 Well , I think you may be overreacting . Mitch likes to give everybody constructive criticism and I think that's what he was doing . 
 Yes , I do . If you ask around , other people will tell you the same thing . 
 I'm glad to hear it . 
 Nothing really , you ? 
 Is that right ? 
 I'm sorry , I can't . 
 I don't really want to . 
 I hate going to parties . 
 Yeah , sorry . 
 As I said , I am diligent and industrious . On the other hand , I am too hard-working and I put myself under much pressure to make things perfect . 
 I am too introverted to let others become my friends . 
 I'm still not sure about these ' Visible ' Certificates . What's the real difference , except the amounts available ? 
 Right . How about the Bearer Certificates ? Can they be cashed before the maturity date ? 
 So , if I was strapped for cash , I could transfer it to get some money ? 
 OK , I think I've got it . 
 I ’ m not sure yet . I may take the train but then again I might take the bus . 
 Really ? Maybe I ’ ll do that then . 
 Ok . Thanks for that ! 
 Yes , please . I'm picking out some presents for my children and wife . 
 Actually , I don't know exactly . Do you have anything recommended ? 
 Hey , How did you know I came from America ? 
 How much again ? 
 That's really cheap for shoes like those . OK , I'll take 5 pairs . 
 Why not ? 
 Oh , my God . I've totally forgotten about that . Anyway , I think she would like a bottle of perfume . 
 DENY ? That's very expensive in America . It costs nearly $ 70 for only 50ml . 
 That's very unbelievable . Is it fake ? 
 OK , I'll take one . 
 Yes , I have worked for four years with a Canadian Company . 
 Well , Mark Smith , who was the first president , founded the company in Ottawa in 1955 . It has 1.5 billion dollars in capital.it employs 8,000 people , and it is the largest company in its field in Canada . 
 Your company's products are mostly marketed in Canada and the United States , but particularly have sold very well here in China . So I think in the future you'll find China to be a profitable market as well . 
 Because I want to change my working environment and seek new challenges . 
 Yes , I like it very much . 
 I think it is confidence in himself and his products . 
 Yes , I'd like to know something about the salary . 
 When can I get the final decision ? 
 Nice meeting you , too . Good-bye . 
 I am brushing my teeth . 
 Mom ~ the toothpaste dropped on my shorts . 
 Okay , now I ’ d like to find out more about your last job . I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly , is that right ? 
 So , what changed ? 
 Wow , a real step up ! 
 I see , so why did you decide to leave finally ? 
 Would you tell me how I should send this parcel to Shanghai , China ? It contains only books . 
 I wonder if I could have it insured here ? 
 Let me see ... I think I can have them insured for five hundred dollars . 
 Here's a check for ten dollars . 
 At 16:35 , from platform 8 . 
 No , you have to change trains at Birmingham . 
 Single or return , sir ? 
 64 pounds , please . 
 Here's your ticket and change , sir . 
 Um , yes , please , I could really use some help . I'm going over to my boss'house for dinner tonight and don't know what kind of wine I should bring . 
 Well , his wife is Japanese . He said she makes really good sushi . 
 Why ? Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi ? 
 I see . So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay ? That's a white wine , right ? 
 Sauvignon Blanc ? What's that ? 
 Let's see . The label says it's got " attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp , mineral flavors and a bonedry finish . Serve chilled . " Oh , no , how long will it take to chill the wine ? I'm on my way to the dinner now . 
 All right . What varietal is that ? 
 And you think this is a good wine ? 
 Perfect ! I'll take it ! 
 Thank you . I just got this outfit the other day . 
 I got it from Macy's . 
 Thanks again . You look nice today , too . 
 Really ? What kind of shoes are they ? 
 I really like those . How much did they cost ? 
 I think I'm going to go buy myself a pair . 
 Yes , go down the fifth street . You won't miss it . 
 It's only about 10 minutes ' walk . 
 I was really glad to hear about your promotion . Congratulations ! 
 Sure , but the work you did was really exceptional ! You definitely deserved it ! 
 You are always responsible and careful . 
 Thank you . I'll try my best . By the way , when do you take over the new position ? 
 So what are you responsible for ? 
 So you must get higher pay than before . 
 1,000 Yuan ? That's great ! So ... 
 Really ? Can I order anything I want ? 
 Good afternoon , Miss Qi . 
 How are you feeling today ? 
 That's good.Well , these are for you . I hope you will like them . 
 I've also brought some magazines for you . I hope they'll keep you from getting bored while you're in the hospital . 
 It's time for me to leave . I hope you will recover soon.See you later . 
 Where do you wish me to take you , sir ? 
 It takes about half an hour to get there . 
 How much do I owe you ? 
 Here ’ s 50 dollars . Keep the change . 
 It's your turn , sir . I'm sorry that you had to wait . Saturday is a busy day for us . 
 How do you want your hair cut ? Any particular way ? 
 Yes , sir . How about the sideburns ? 
 Can I use the clippers ? 
 Oh , all right , sir . 
 Don't you think it needs a little taken off on top , too ? 
 ( Raising a lock ) About like this ? 
 Shave also , s ir ? 
 How do you want your moustache trimmed ? 
 Yes , I do . I ’ d prefer you didn ’ t . The AC ( air-conditioning ) is also on . 
 That ’ s not a very good idea . It ’ s quite hot outside . Why don ’ t you smoke outside ? 
 Though the AC has the air-purifying function . I ’ d still rather have fresh air than smoke . Are you okay with that ? 
 Would you like to know about benefits and so forth ? 
 With this agreement we can bring over you many benefits . For example , head offices of your group companies can get really prompt integrated fund transfers and centralised allocations . This helps internal supervision and admin run smoothly . 
 Hopefully signing up for this Network Settlement Service will solve all of that . If you are sure , we can go ahead now , Sir . How does 10 am tomorrow sound , to get all of the paperwork out of the way ? 
 Is there a reason why you're trying to get off the phone so fast ? 
 I wasn't done talking to you . 
 I'm not being nosey . I'm just asking . 
 That's not nice . 
 Okay . 
 Yes , this is Julianne Horton , and I ’ m calling to arrange an appointment with Ms . McNeal . 
 How ’ s Thursday ? Does she have any time available then ? 
 Actually , I ’ Ve got something scheduled on Monday . Can she do Tuesday ? 
 Sure , Merton Financial Advisors . 
 What's the chef's specialty ? 
 Bring me one and besides , I would like to have a chicken cream soup . 
 Hello sir , welcome to Pistolera restaurant . May I take your order ? 
 I ' m sorry sir , but we ran out of chicken . May I suggest our delicious beef burritos or cheese quesadillas ? Both include a side of guacamole and jalapenos . 
 Of course sir . Our nachos come with melted cheese and chili . 
 Would you like anything to drink ? 
 Excuse me , Mr . Graham ? I have something I need to discuss with you . 
 I would really appreciate it if we could talk for a few minutes now . It ’ s about the overtime you ’ Ve asked me to put in . 
 Why are you up so early , Mary ? 
 What are you watching ? 
 At least five channels have morning cartoons on Saturdays . 
 I agree . And some cartoons are entertaining even for adults . 
 Are you kidding ? It's too early for her . 
 Hmm . That's not too bad . Does it have a stopwatch ? 
 Oh . I see . Where are your digital watches ? 
 I don't like this kind as much . Never mind the stopwatch then . I'll take that other one . Do you take checks ? 
 Here you are . 
 Dad , you've been driving for three hours . Why don't we have a switch ? 
 Trust me . I've been driving for two years . 
 Do you have any special interests besides your job ? 
 What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ? 
 There is a reason in what you say . 
 Which Sons do you want to go to ? 
 You actually need to catch two buses . 
 The first bus you need to get on is the 268 . 
 Once you get to Fair Oaks and Washington , get off . 
 You need to get on the 261 . It goes all the way to Sons . 
 That's it . 
 Problems are what we're here for , sir . Please tell me your problem . 
 Were you wearing your glasses when you noticed them , sir ? 
 Sir , sometimes a fast elevator ride makes our guests see spots . 
 I'm very sorry , sir . Will you please hold while I transfer you to my supervisor ? 
 Yes , what kind of room do you want ? 
 Sorry , right now we can only have you a room without shower . 
 Miss , which is the movie channel ? I can't find it . 
 Thanks so much . 
 Are you having problems ? This is the first I ’ Ve heard of it . 
 What kind of problems are you talking about ? 
 Maybe I could get back to you in a few weeks . I am leaving on vacation this afternoon . 
 Don ’ t tell me what to do ! I ’ ll get to it when I get around to it ! 
 I ’ ll be right over ! 
 No , not yet . I'd like to buy a teapot . 
 That colored one is very beautiful . It may suit my furniture . How much do you ask for it ? 
 Show it to me , Please . Can you get me another ? It's scratched a little bit here . 
 I do like it . Can you come down a bit ? 
 That's still too much . Can you lower the price further ? 
 If so , I'd better try another store . 
 I'd be glad to . He's really cute . 
 We have shuttle buses leaving for the airport from downtown every 20 minutes The bus stops at Holiday Inn as well . Be sure to get on the bus before 30 . 
 At 7 am . It takes about one hour to get to the airport . So it'll be right for your timing . 
 Your tickets are valid for one year.If you want to change flight , you just go to the airline's ticketing office and have it reconfirmed . But you have to fly the same airlines . 
 In that case . you can get a refund with a certain percentage of the original fare deducted as the service charge . 
 Welcome . May I help you ? 
 We have different colours of eye-shadow . May I know what colour you usually wear ? 
 Yes , I see . How do you like this one ? 
 Certainly . 
 Not from this brand , I'm afraid . 
 How about this one ? 
 OK , so this is the main factory area . We're now walking past the printing machine . It's printing in four colours at the moment . 
 They're setting up the machine for a new run . 
 About twenty minutes . 
 That's the packing line . The goods are being wrapped and loaded onto pallets ready for transportation . 
 It sounds nice , but don't forget this is a seedy , run-down neighborhood . 
 It's a bit small but looks nice.What ' s more , it's only ten minutes ' walk to the company . 
 I started washing here about three years ago . 
 I can wash my clothes for less money here . 
 What reason are you washing here today ? 
 Go and get it repaired . 
 Are you going to continue washing your clothes here for a while ? 
 Washing clothes at a Laundromat costs a lot less money . 
 When do you plan to travel ? 
 Are you aware that without two weeks advance notice prices will be very high ? 
 I understand . So that ’ s one ticket to New York , and you ’ ll be departing tonight . Will that be one-way or round trip ? 
 When would you like to return ? 
 OK . I have several seats available . Would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?

 What about the costumes ? 
 Try something new . We can find a supporting agency . 
 Doctor , what are some things I can do to stay as healthy as I can be ? 
 Sometimes I don ’ t know what the best foods are . 
 What things should I avoid ? 
 Beyond diet , what else can I do to be healthy ? 
 How about having a beer on the weekend ? 
 I feel terrible sick , miss . I wonder if I could change my seat to the front part . 
 Thank you . 
 How many people are there in your family ? 
 I have a large family . I have three older sisters , my twin sister , a younger brother , and my parents . 
 We're identical . I mean , we look exactly the same , but we complete opposites when it comes to everything else ! 
 We used to be really close , but that all changed once she moved to Shanghai . How about your family ? You didn't mention to your biological father . 
 What about your step-brother's mother ? Does he keep in touch with her ? 
 Sounds like it was ment to be .

 Well , it's a fruit with a big seed in it . 
 No . Peel the skin with a sharp knife , and throw out the seed . 
 Well , they're on sale today for only $ 1 each . 
 They usually taste sweet , but they remind me of an orange . 
 You can buy them either ripe or unripe . Unripe ones are hard . 
 The ones that are on sale are from Central America .

 I allocate different patients with their consent to different nurses . And I supervise the primary nurses and help nurses carry out their work .

 How many invitations has she given out ? 
 I really want to go , so I hope that she gives me my invite soon .

 Daddy , I am so glad you come out with us . 
 It doesn't matter . But I really haven't gone for a picnic for a long time . 
 It was boring . Just did my homework and practiced the piano .

 He's dancing with Jack ! 
 The wei-ya is the one time a year you can make fun of the boss . 
 You're right . They are spinning pretty fast . Aren't they getting dizzy ? What if they fall ...

 Okay , let's go home . 
 Here is my card . Can I have them delivered to this address ? 
 OK , thank you . 
 For you , I would recommend this one here . 
 This automobile is just right for your needs because not only is it compact for ease in city driving , but also , it has many safety features . I know that as a parent , you are concerned about safety in driving your kids to and from school . 
 This model features anti-lock brakes , airbags on both driver and passenger sides , and impact collision design . But that's not all . This car isn't only safe but it's also very economical . 
 Yes , this price is very affordable , but driving this car you'll also notice a significant annual saving in gas consumption . The main attraction for this model is the fuel economy . 
 Why don't you take it for a test drive , and think it over . 
 What would you like ? 
 I'm sorry . We're currently out of filet mignon . May I suggest the porterhouse instead ? 
 And may I suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ? 
 Okay , no strawberries . Room service will be charged to your amenities account . Is that all right ? 
 It will be up shortly . Enjoy your food , sir . 
 Yes , I'd like to see the manager.Here ' s my card .

 Well , how long will it be ? 
 That's too bad . I can't wait that long . I have another appointment at ten . 
 No , I have discussed the details about sales of our new equipment with the manager on the telephone yesterday . 
 Yes , I suppose that's the best thing I can do for now . I'll be here on Thursday morning at 10 o'clock . Is that all right ? 
 Hello . Can I help you ? 
 Yes . We ’ ll close this position posting at the end of this month . 
 Go to the Human Resource Office , please . You can get it there . 
 It ’ s on the first floor , Room 120 . 
 Good luck . 
 Hi Anna , come in . 
 I know , I didn't have time to put things away before you got here . 
 Yes . 
 Actually most of them are dirty . I haven't done laundry in a while . I usually wait until I can do it at my parent's house . 
 I know I should , but that place isn't very convenient . You have to wait for a long time . 
 No I'm not ready yet . I still have to brush my teeth and wash my face . Can you wait for a few minutes ? 
 Can I help you ? 
 Sure . Please come this way . 
 Of course . Here is the fitting room . 
 Yes , here it is . 
 You look really beautiful in it .

 Sure . Most facials start with a thorough cleaning . Then we usually use a toner to invigorate the skin , followed by exfoliation treatment-a peeling mask or scrub that removes the dead cells that make the skin lock dull . After that , we'll massage your face and neck with oil or cream to improve the circulation and relieve the tension , followed by a mask to moisturize and soften the skin . 
 We have half-hour and one-hour treatments . 
 Well , the half-hour facial costs 50 yuan and the one-hour costs 80 yuan . If you want make-up , another 20 yuan will do . 
 That's fine , madam . 
 Yes , madam . 
 Have you tried an outlet ? 
 Many of my friends shop at outlets . 
 I'm only too happy to help . 
 And this espresso looks like ... oil ! 
 These days , I can't think of anything but motor oil . Even coffee makes me think of it . 
 I ’ Ve just found a mouse in the house ! 
 I found a mouse in our house , a grown mouse running around the dinning room . 
 It ’ s under the couch . 
 Ok , I don ’ t want a mouse in our house . We have the tidiest house in the town . 
 Hello . floor service , can I help you ? 
 No problem , what would you need , Mr . Smith ? 
 OK , I will send them to you soon . 
 Anything else , Mr . Smith ? 
 morning , Mary ? It ’ s John Kramer calling . You remember you handled my tax forms for me ? 
 Better than ever ! You won ’ t have to worry about “ finding ” extra money for me anymore ! We made nearly a quarter of million in profit last year ! 
 I'm going on a guided tour in the mountain . 
 I like the sight and the sound.It worked on me like a magic when I was a child . 
 My Goodness ! What a busy line so early in the morning ! Hello . 
 Hi , Basil . 
 Yes , by all means . I was just about to leave . 
 I'll wait on the sidewalk . It's very kind of you . 
 Hi , Basil . 
 Do you mind if I take some notes while we drive ? 
 Yes , I finally have an inspiration . 
 I'm going to Bihai Park.Is this the right bus , please ? 
 How can I get it , please ? 
 Could I have a transfer please ? 
 Thank you . 
 Hello , everybody . I am Monica and this is my first day at work . I am working in the finance department . I am very happy to meet everyone and I am looking forward to working well with all of you . I am very happy to be one of the team and I will do my best to get into the working situation as soon as possible . By the way , call me Monica . Everybody calls me so . 
 Oh . Yes ? 
 Yes , there are some on Pine Street . 
 Well , I think there's one across from the shopping center . 
 By the way , there's a barber shop in the shopping center , too . 
 I'm hungry . 
 It wasn't enough , because I'm hungry again . 
 I'm going to get a snack . 
 I don't know . 
 I don't know what kind of sandwich I want . 
 I may just do that . 
 Why didn't you text me last night ? 
 I didn't get any of them . I was waiting for you to text me the address of where the party was and I never got your message . 
 Well , because I didn't have any credit on my phone . I used it all up this month . 
 I do , but if I don't have any credit in my phone , it won't let me call or send messages . 
 It's Chinese New Year ! That means it's time to eat hot pot ! 
 You mean half-and-half ? 
 Good idea . 
 All right . What would you like to drink ? 
 Regular or large ? 
 OK . Anything else ? 
 For here or to go ? 
 Well , that's why you'r here.My source for big TV sets overcharged me on the last shipment , so I need someone new . I wanted to meet you to see if we can work together . I think 
 Fine , but before you agree , don't you need to know what you're agreeing to ? 
 Ha , ha , ha ! That's fair.How did I do ? 
 Good , well , here's what I need from you . Are you ready ? 
 Well , I know you work for someone else , but as your client , please , we have to get this straight between us . I'm your client , not your company.As your client , I expect you to be square with me at all times . Can you do that ? 
 Good ! Do you have any questions ? 
 When I have time , I sometimes draw and paint . 
 Every so often , I do . 
 I was taught in high school how to draw and paint . 
 Exactly , it was my favorite class . 
 I appreciate that . 
 Everyone has a talent . They just need to find it . 
 What forms must we fill out , Miss ? 
 I see . But why do we have to fill out these forms now ? 
 Do you drink much ? 
 How frequently do you drink ? 
 Only when I go out . I'm not a big drinker . 
 I usually only have 2 beers . 
 How much can you drink ? 
 Don't you spend a lot of money then ? 
 That's true . 
 I like beer , it's just that I get a headache when I drink more than 3 . 
 It'll take awhile , but I'm working on it . 
 Alright . 
 Thanks . I was hoping that you would all enjoy this meal . 
 I got a really wonderful cookbook for my birthday and decided to try out a few of the recipes . 
 I love that dish as well . It is coconut chicken with rice . 
 Yes , that soup has a shrimp base . I also added sea vegetables and lemon grass . 
 I love this wine ! It goes very well with the chicken . 
 The chicken tastes wonderful , but it is kind of dry . Is your fish OK ? 
 It seems as if they got busy and left it sitting before it got to us . 
 Are your vegetables a little mushy ? 
 Mine aren't so good , either . 
 I think that we should let someone know . They will probably want to fix the problem . 
 Oh yeah ? What do you need to go shopping for ? 
 Do you know where you're going to find your bedroom set ? 
 There's no particular place that you want to look at ? 
 I can tell you where I got mine , if you'd like . 
 I bought mine from IKEA . 
 Not really , but you're paying for quality . 
 I want a Special King size and some chips . 
 Green salad please . 
 Cola , please . 
 ... 
 Thank you . 
 What about grapes and water melons ? 
 Sure . 
 $ 2 . 
 Yes , speaking . 
 Can you speak a little louder ? You sound very indistinct with the hissing noise . 
 Could you arrange an appointment with Mr . Smith ? 
 How about tomorrow afternoon ? 
 I want to buy a shirt . 
 A white one , please . 
 What's the size ? 
 I think a medium one will do . 
 Yes , where can I buy trousers ? 
 What mark is it ? 
 Room service . Can I help you ? 
 What would you like , sir ? 
 It will take about 20 minutes , sir . Is that all right ? 
 Of course , sir . 
 That's all right.Show me the blue pen , please . 
 I see.Thank you . 
 OK , what would you like ? 
 Sure and which one would you like ? 
 How much does it cost to rent a mid-size car ? 
 Fine . I'd like to reserve one for next Tuesday . 
 Yes . It's right here . 
 I've just taken a spanner set from the stores . 
 Sorry , what do you mean ? 
 Would you do me a favor ? 
 Excuse me . Do you mind if I ask some things about work for this company ? 
 I've heard that the company is very strict with its staff.Is that true ? 
 If you make mistakes in your job , you'll be fired . Is that right ? 
 Working here involves a busy schedule and overtime.Is that true ? 
 It seems that working in a foreign enterprise is not the same as I expected . Thank you for your help . 
 Yes , I'd like to book a table for two this evening . 
 7:30 . By tho way , I would like a table next to the window . 
 Hi , did you call for an exterminator ? 
 What sort of pest are we dealing with ? 
 Well , there ’ s nothing we can ’ t handle . I ’ ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches , but the termites will be harder to get rid of . We will have to cover the entire house and fumigate it . Unfortunately that means you will have to find a place to stay for the next three days . 
 John , it ’ s time to get up . 
 It is . Hurry up ! You ’ ll be late for school . 
 It ’ s nearly half past seven . 
 It ’ s slow . Hurry up ! The bus goes at twenty to eight . 
 Positive . I ’ ll put the radio on . 
 No , it isn ’ t . It ’ s stopped . I forgot to wind it up last night . 
 Are you sure this is the right restaurant ? 
 You don't think you could be wrong ? 
 I don't know . It looks a little wrong down . 
 You're a hundred percent sure you want to eat here ? 
 Good morning , Oriental Electric Limited . 
 That is all right . Maybe we can make another arrangement . 
 I'm afraid there is a bit of a problem . in fact , he has booked up the whole week except tomorrow afternoon . 
 Please let me check ... Tomorrow afternoon ... Yes , he'll be free from 3:00 tomorrow afternoon . Do you think it's convenient for you ? 
 All right . Let's change it . Tomorrow afternoon at three . I am going to schedule it for that time and inform Mr.Liu about the change . 
 See you . 
 We can take a bus there . 
 I think so . 
 No , it's too crowded . 
 Fine . Let's get on . Oh , no , Judy ! Get off the bus quickly ! 
 We got on the wrong bus . 
 They are actually fairly straightforward . Do you know where the blanks are kept ? 
 OK , well after you take one out of that second drawer , you put your name on the top . Do you see ? 
 Next you fill in all of your hours for each day and total them . Do you know how to show time on a 24 - hour clock ? 
 Midnight is zero and when you put the minutes in , make sure that you show them with a dot followed by the minutes . Do you understand ? 
 It's easy , just write in the hours , total it , sign it , and put it in the box . 
 Try it and if you can't do it , one of us can always help you later . 
 Thanks . Actually , I was really surprised . I mean there were a lot of qualified people out there . 
 Thanks a lot . I expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too . You ’ Ve been doing some great work . 
 I finished them in no time . 
 Mum , when will we have them again ? 
 I ’ m sorry . She ’ s in a meeting right now . 
 Can I give her a message for you ? 
 And your name , please ? 
 Certainly . 
 You're right here , bus station , we are in the center of the city . 
 You can take a No . 2 bus here . 
 At Longing Street . 
 What size do you need ? 
 They're at the back of the stores , second shelf up on the right-hand side . 
 They're in the blue cupboard . Anything else ? 
 I ’ ll need to check . Sorry , we don ’ t have any in stock . But I can order some and send through the order today . How many do you need ? 
 Fine . They should be here the day after tomorrow . 
 Bring me a cup of coffee , please . 
 I'd prefer a black one . 
 Yes . I would like a pair of black leather shoes in size 25 . 
 The tip is rather narrow . 
 Are you going home now ? 
 What are you going to do ? Are you going to work late ? 
 An apartment ? Why ? 
 Where are you living now ? 
 How are you going to find an apartment ? 
 Apartments in the city are expensive . 
 Excuse me , is there a swimming pool in your hotel ? 
 What's the fare ? 
 Thank you . 
 Return on investment ? How can you have a return on this kind of investment ? Can you really calculate the value of these training programs ? 
 Wow ! I'm impressed . So , what's in the cards for future training ? Will it be in-house or off-site ? 
 Yes , I see that here ... continuing education for the IT department , a time management course for accounting , and team building for sales . Anything planned for HR ? 
 I opened my mail , found this eviction notice , and don ’ t know what to do with it . 
 Just for being a few days late ? 
 Are you taking my apartment away ? 
 Can I keep the apartment if I pay my rent in full ? 
 I will go write a check right now . 
 How ’ s your little girl , Debbie ? 
 How old is she ? 
 What can I do for you , Miss ? 
 That's right.The bus tour is really efficient and cheap . 
 9 : OO . Don't worry , Miss , we have buses every 15 minutes . 
 Helen , why do you keep flushing the toilet ? What's wrong ? 
 You did what ? Helen , I know it's gross , but I ' Ve seen many public washrooms that are much worse . Why are you cleaning the counter top ? are you out of your mind ? 
 Helen , this is not like your own bathroom . Just leave it to the cleaners , okay ? 
 You're such a neat freak ! I'm outta here ! 
 I don't know . What do you want to do ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 Yeah , I guess you're right . It's easy to get bogged down in the day to day , and forget to change things up once in a while . Let's break out and do something completely different tonight . 
 An hour ? That's a bit of a bummer . Let me take a peek and see what else there is . How about going dancing ? We haven't done that in a while . There's a club in Silver Lake that's supposed to be hopping on Friday nights . Eddie from work told me that they have a really good DJ and a big dance floor , and the cover charge isn't bad . 
 Yeah , I was hoping you'd say that . It's nice to have the option to go out but I'd rather stay in . Maybe we can go out tomorrow night . 
 This is Action 5 News reporter Sarah O ’ Connell reporting live from Washington , D . C . where a protest has broken out . Thousands of angry citizens are protesting against the proposed bailout of the auto manufacturing industry ! Sir , sir , Sarah O ’ Connell , Action 5 news . Can you tell us what ’ s happening ? 
 Sir but what exactly is making everyone so angry ? 
 I see . But , many supporters of the bailout argue that it could help save the jobs of millions of hardworking Americans . 
 Good point . This is Sarah O ’ Connell reporting live from Washington D . C . , back to you , Tom . 
 Hey , sounds great to me , kid . What kind of job did you find ? 
 Yes , job . If you ’ re going to live on your own , you have to pay for rent and everything else . 
 When you move out , your father and I aren ’ t paying your rent , young man . Get a job . 
 Well , the newspaper is over there . Look in the want ads , but I don ’ t know what you ’ re going to find without a college degree . 
 Thank you . How long it take to get my son's hair cut ? 
 No . I'm thinking that maybe I can get my hair shampooed . 
 How come ? 
 Then I won't say no to that . 
 I feel totally refreshed . 
 This time included ? 
 Then yes . 
 Yes , we're interested in seeing the rooms for rent . 
 That is exactly what we're looking for . 
 That sounds all right to us . 
 How about tomorrow afternoon ? 
 See you tomorrow . 
 You may pick it up in twenty minutes . 
 Yes , and you can renew this prescription by phone . 
 Take it three times a day . 
 You should take this medicine with food and no alcohol . 
 You might get a little dizzy , but that is it . 
 Well , for a monthly pass , it'll cost you $ 65 . 
 If you're a student , you can get a student bus pass . 
 That actual bus pass is free . 
 The only thing you'll have to pay for is the monthly sticker . 
 It's only $ 24 a month . 
 I'll get it for you right now . 
 There are about 20 main spots and some other small spots . 
 Yes , some of the spots charges separately . 
 Yes , sir , it's $ 20 . 
 I am , as a matter of fact . Do you have any special requests ? 
 Wait . This is sounding like a major list . Why don't you just come with me ? 
 It really depends on when and how long . 
 Can I see some men's watches ? 
 What functions does this watch have ? 
 Is it waterproof ? 
 I'll take it . Please set the watch for me . 
 Where is your seat ? 
 OK , you mean the vacant one on the left ? 
 No need . I have only this small handbag with me . 
 Excuse me . Where are you going ? 
 I'm afraid you can't today . 
 Only on Saturday and Sunday from one to five p . m . 
 Yes , do you have a table for five ? 
 We'd like a non-smoking room , please . 
 Will you give me a hand , sir ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 I'll be glad when winter comes . 
 Because I love the snow . 
 Last year we made a big snowman . 
 It was seven feet tall . 
 It took us all day . 
 Of course . We gave him a big carrot for a nose . 
 I ’ d like to ask whether it is correct to partake in the firm ’ s insurance plan ? 
 But people keep talking about the benefits from the plan . 
 Yes , of course . There are various forms of travel . 
 There is no need . We have the tour everyday . 
 No . These terms need to be amplified . 
 Then the shipping documents have to be attached . That way , both parties confirm the documents that will accompany the draft and constitute evidence of shipment in compliance with the contract terms . 
 Yes , that's very important . 
 I ’ Ve been feeling a little light-headed lately . 
 If I have high blood pressure , it is news to me . 
 What do you use to check for high blood pressure ? 
 What does the reading tell you ? 
 I hope that the test results show me to be really healthy . 
 Yes , I just wondered why the price between the ninth and tenth floor is so different . 
 Oh ! I see . Can you show me the location of Block I ? 
 How many elevators are there ? 
 How about the car-park space ? 
 Any other facilities ? 
 What is the completion date ? 
 How about the price and the bank mortgage ? 
 How many payment methods are there ? 
 Thank you . I think I have to talk to the bank representatives . Thank you for your help . 
 You've got a beautiful singing voice ! 
 Come on , You hit the high notes perfectly ! 
 You're too modest . Pass me the catalogue ! I'd like to see which song to choose.Wow , this place has a large selection of songs . I dont know which to choose ! 
 Funny.Oh , i like this song . It's by one of my favorite singers . 
 1021.It ' s a duet ! Come on , Pick the mic and sing along ! 
 Mom , I don't feel well . 
 I feel dizzy . 
 Mom , I don't want to go to see a doctor . 
 Good afternoon , Mr . Yang . I'm Jill , Mr . Smith's secretary . Would you like to look around the factory first ? 
 Now this is our office block . We have all the administrative departments Sales , Accounting , Personnel , Market Research and so on . 
 That's the warehouse where the larger items of medical instruments are stored . We keep a stock of the fast-moving items so that urgent orders can be met quickly from stock . ( in the workshop ) This is one of our three workshops . This is the delivery bay here . 
 The steel sheets and bars come in , as you see , in different sizes and are unloaded onto the delivery bay here . We buy them in from a steel works in Wales . This is the new conveyor belt we installed last year . We doubled our output in this department as a result . 
 I'll take you to the assembly shop ... 
 So you have to open all the envelopes . 
 Do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ? 
 How do you use an ATM card , Billy ? 
 Oh yes . I ’ Ve got it written down here . Just a minute . 
 OK , I ’ Ve entered my PIN . There are several options on the screen . I guess I just choose which service I want , don't I ? 
 I can just enter the amount using the key , right ? 
 These machines aren ’ t very difficult to use . In fact , I quite like them . They are much faster than dealing with a band clerk . 
 I can ’ t sleep or eat . I have a really bad pain in my tooth ! 
 It bothers me off and on , but it ’ s gotten much worse these past few weeks . 
 My girlfriend told me that I grind my teeth a lot when I sleep . Maybe that is the problem . 
 I use a soft bristle toothbrush . 
 Absolutely . That set it off big time ! 
 Speaking . 
 Certainly , please have a seat and roll up your left sleeve . 
 Well , today your doctor wants us to check your white blood cell count . 
 Well , if it is elevated , you might have an infection . 
 It is only a little pin stick . I am going to put a tourniquet on your arm to puff your veins up . 
 There we go ! I got the blood that I needed . 
 Sure . Any specific reason I should know about in case people ask where you are . 
 No problem . Good luck . 
 What is your understanding of a job ? 
 Why do you want to work for us ? 
 Hi , is that Li Ling ? 
 I am glad to inform you that you are expected to come for an interview in our head office tomorrow . 
 Yes , sure . It is No . 50 in the Fifth Avenue where there is a fairground and a museum . 
 It's about 14 hours . We are supposed to land there at 19:00 . 
 Of course . We are already out of our motherland . 
 Yes ? 
 All right . But tell him I will only be here until four o'clock . 
 Yes , do you need some help ? 
 Yes , sure . You need to put your card in the slot . 
 That ’ s right . Then wait for the green light and turn the handle . 
 Anything else I can do for you ? 
 OK , here you are.Anything else ? 
 You can buy a money order and mail mature immigration . 
 Please fill out the form for the money order.You also need to pay a one dollar fee . 
 You're welcome.Have a nice day . 
 Is that you , Bob ? 
 Oh I ’ m sorry . I think I ’ ll call later . Thank you . 
 What kind of bag is it ? 
 What are your room number and your name , please ? 
 Well , let me check . We delivered four bags to room 1106 , you friend's room about an hour ago . 
 You're quite welcome . 
 What happened ? 
 That's okay . I like it better that way anyway . 
 Hello , Todd ! 
 Yes , in fact , my mom's house we have three , three pets . two dogs and a cat . My family actually raises dogs for helping blind people . 
 How do they train the dogs ? Well , I mean , it's a long process , right ... we get them when they're puppies ... and so we train them basic ... you know , sit , come ... really basic things ... then , after they're about two year old , they go a different training school . 
 Oh , just one ! We have our own dog , and then we have a dog that we have that we are training . 
 Sometimes we'll see them , they'll have like sort of conventions of reunions of the pets so , yeah , you get to see them once in awhile . 
 I guess the most important thing is companionship , right ! So there is always somebody there for you that will like you no matter what . 
 Well , I guess if you are Sigrid and Roy you can keep a tiger or lion . I guess all types of things don't they . 
 No problem . What are you looking for ? 
 Yes , your laptop is on the chair . 
 Which one ? 
 It's under the table . 
 There's a pencil in front of the lamp . 
 Oh , sorry . There is a pencil behind the cup . 
 It's in between the wall and the bed . 
 They're on the left side of the TV . 
 Sorry , I made a mistake . They're on the right side of the TV . 
 Oh , and here are your glasses . They were next to your cell phone . 
 Let's blow on it . 
 Yummy ! Yummy ! Eat more ! 
 You look a bit pale , don't you ? 
 You should get plenty of sleep . 
 If I were you , I wouldn't drink too much . 
 You better do some exercise every morning . 
 Why do you worry about your future ? You're very young , and you'll make great contribution to the world . I hope you take my advice . 
 9:25 on Platform 12 , Track B . 
 It should be there at 11:45 , but it may be a little late . 
 It's $ 32.00 . 
 Yes , I've got to work overtime . 
 Yes . What can I do for you ? 
 What ’ s your name ? 
 You have been in Peking University , hadn't you ? 
 What degree do you have now ? : 
 Do you have any experience in this field ? 
 Why are you interested in the position ? 
 All right . If we decide to hire you , we'd pay you 5,000 yuan a month at the start . How do you think about it ? 
 Hi , taxi . 
 The international airport , please . I have to be there by 8 
 Oh , that's my stop . How much do I need to pay ? 
 Thanks a lot.here . 
 We shall open an irrevocable L / C to cover our shipment from Shanghai to Hamburg . Is it at sight or after sight ? 
 Some customers demand that 80 % of the credit amount be paid at sight , and the rest be paid after the machines are proved satisfactory on trial . 
 But such terms are quite common in the machinery trade . Other suppliers are offering better terms . Some even allow payment 60days after sight . 
 That's true . I'm eager to know if you could send some fitters to ensure good operation . 
 If you send fitters along with the machines to ensure that all the machines run properly , and if you provide after-sales service , we agree to make the payment in full . 
 Hey Lisa ... want to grab lunch with me ? 
 Yeah ... actually , we haven't hung out at all recently . You seem sort of under the weather . Is there something going on ? 
 Quit this company ? Oh ... wow . 
 One of the best in the company . 
 Oh , I get it . Simply put , you're bored , huh ? 
 Taxi ! 
 Please rush me to the railway station 
 Can you speed up a bit ? 
 But I have no time to lose . 
 Can you drop me off here ? 
 I hear that you've got a chance to go to Europe for a half-year training program . Is it true ? 
 Congratulations ! How can you get such a good opportunity to be trained overseas ? 
 How nice ! But will you have to pay for the training ? 
 So awful ! I never fancy my salary is so little . 
 Bingo ! I never thought about that before . I am working so hard and my accomplishment is significant , you know . 
 I know I deserve it , but I can not find a way to talk with boss about this . 
 That sounds reasonable . 
 That's a point . It seems a little complicated . I will think about this for a while . I owe you one . After all , you give me an inspiration . 
 Welcome back , Sir . I trust the materials were helpful to you ? 
 Your credit is fine , Sir . Now , tell me , what is it that you need the loan for ? 
 I see . And what loan amount are you expecting ? 
 I'm sorry , Sir . The maximum we can lend you on this type of loan is 20,000 RIB , with no exceptions . 
 I need some documentation from you . Such as your resident permit , your occupation and salary details and I already have your credit details here . 
 How do you spend your spare time ? Are you interested in sports ? 
 Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ? 
 It is so wonderful that this transaction turned out to be the satisfaction of both parties . 
 I hope that we can continue our cooperation . 
 Hello , Miao Ping . Yes , I've been stuck in back to back meetings all day , but I really wanted to come and speak to you . 
 I'm interested in putting some of my money into investment tools , you know , something other than stocks and such like . Do you have any ideas ? 
 Yes , I've heard about that . Isn't it where many investors pool their money together ? 
 How can you help me to decide which areas to invest in ? 
 Is this the information here ? Well , let's take a look then ... 
 Well , I ’ Ve attended some conferences in this field . But the most relevant training I ’ Ve had was in computer design . I believe I could integrate that knowledge with my college degree to design 
 Well , I notice that you currently provide an on-screen TV Guide . At the moment , it just scrolls the names of the programs in a repeated loop . If you have many channels , you have to wait a long t 
 Tie it in with the pay-per-view services , and perhaps it could be a money-maker . 
 Yes , I took a break from work during that time . I had a baby , and as she was born with a handicap , I decided to suspend my career . But I have continued to keep up with the Industry through con 
 Excuse me , I ’ Ve been waiting here for fifteen minutes.Do you know why the traffic is so heavy ? 
 Oh , what a terrible situation ! This traffic is unbearable . 
 I agree with you . But now we have to wait . The sky is overcast , and it is very sultry . I fear a thunder storm is brewing . 
 Yes , I hope so . Thank you for telling me this . 
 Hello . Gail Willows speaking . 
 Hello , Daniel . What can I do for you ? 
 Oh , really ? Do you know which company it's from ? 
 Ah , great ! I'll send someone over to pick it up . Thanks for calling . 
 I want to take out a loan for school . What kind of interest rate do you offer ? 
 Yes , but I need to borrow some more money . 
 What's the interest rate ? 
 How do I go about taking it out ? 
 All right , thank you ! 
 Um , sure . What are we having for dinner ? Do I need to put out anything in particular ? 
 Ok , should I use the fancy silverware ? 
 I ’ ll also set some cups and saucers for some coffee after dinner . 
 They are in the cupboard where you keep the gravy boat and serving dishes . Just be careful because the wine glasses are also there . 
 Sorry , but I ’ m not really interested in those things . 
 Really . 
 Oh , I don ’ t care about that . 
 Are they ? 
 I ’ m afraid I ’ m not interested in fashion . 
 But thank you very much all the same . 
 Welcome to our International Business Counter . How can I help ? 
 Not a problem . Could you tell me you L / C number , please ? 
 OK , just checking for you ... yes , they have arrived . How would you like me to handle them ? 
 That's fine . I'll get on with that for you right now . 
 Yes.We ' re interested in seeing the rooms for rent . 
 A nice quiet house is exactly what we're looking for . 
 That sounds just wonderful to us . 
 How about this afternoon ? 
 Who's the woman you talked to just now ? 
 Oh , no wonder you're so respectful to her .

 Do you have any plan to buy a house in this city ? 
 Our monthly salary can not buy one square meter of the house here . 
 More and more people need to buy houses , but the market can not meet the needs , so this caused the bubble in real estate industry .

 You must know you've been scheduled to have an operation the day after 
 The operation starts at 10 0 ' clock . But you'll get an injection of anaesthesia about 30 to 45 minutes in advance . If your family comes to see you before the operation , they should come before 8: 30 . 
 It's nothing . Did your doctor explain to you about what operation you are going to have ? 
 OK . Have you signed the consent ? 
 I am sorry to say this but I seem to have lost the key to the safe . 
 Yes , I believe so . How should I compensate for this ? 
 What ? 100 US dollars ? Is it covered by the insurance ?

 That's the best price we can offer . 
 We can give you a discount if you order for immediate shipment .

 Thank you , Henry . I'll get a number 13 . 
 I think I may rent out this apartment that I found . 
 I was looking through the ads today , and I found it in there . 
 Yeah , and it ’ s affordable too . 
 First of all , it ’ s absolutely gorgeous . 
 It ’ s only $ 725 a month . 
 I know it is . 
 Good morning , sir . I am ready to check out now . 
 May I have my bill now ? 
 Cash , please . 
 Yes ? 
 About half an hour , if there's no traffic jam . 
 I doubt it . It's not rush hour . 
 Hi Benjamin . My name is Dr . Green . What seems to be the matter ? 
 What are your symptoms ? 
 It sounds like you might be a bit dehydrated . Do you feel thirsty most of the day ? 
 Have you been drinking plenty of water ? 
 Ok . Well , we'll have a nurse take some blood in a few minutes to see if you're dehydrated . First , let me feel your pulse . 
 Is anyone else sick in your home ? 
 I see . I'll have the lab techs run some tests to check for mono as well then . The nurse will come in then to take your blood , we'll run some tests , and then you can go home . You should hear from us by this afternoon . 
 What is your temperature now ? 
 How high was your temperature yesterday ? 
 Will you open your mouth ? Your throat is swollen . 
 You seem to have a cold . I'll give your an injection and let me write down your prescription . 
 Yes . I have my wallet stolen . 
 I don't know the exact time . Maybe I lost it last night when I was traveling on the bus . 
 It's a black leather one.There are my credit card and ID and some money . 
 Ideal posture is to sit straight , but not stiff , against the back of the chair . 
 Hands , when one is not actually eating , may be in the lap . Tipping one's chair is unforgivable . 
 Yes , I ’ ll have the Texas chili burger . 
 A large , with tons of ketchup . 
 I'll have a diet coke , please . 
 Take-out , please . 
 Cash . 
 Thank you . 
 The system crashed when I was surfing on the internet . 
 No , But does that matter ? 
 I see . I'd better never try . 
 Do you know what's wrong with my PC ? 
 Is anti-virus software necessary for a PC ? 
 I'm afraid yes . But what about the data I stored in the computer ? 
 Yes , please . I'll really appreciate that . 
 Oh , I have to check . Do you need anything else ? 
 That will be fourteen dollars in all . 
 You can buy the bubble wrap here , but you ’ ll have to stand in line over here to post your package . 
 It takes about 3 minutes per person , so it ’ ll probably be about an hour ’ s wait . 
 Sure . How many would you like ? 
 Are you sending them abroad ? 
 Do you have any going anywhere in the EU ? If you do , those are less expensive . 
 Ok , here you go . That will be 18 pounds and seventy two pence . 
 That ’ s another quid . 
 Good morning , Madam . Can I help you ? 
 May I have your name , please ? 
 I see . Wait for a moment please . I am sorry , Mrs . Clinton , but the remittance doesn't appear to have arrived yet . 
 If the money was sent by cable , it would have taken about one or two days . But if it was sent by airmail , it would take at least one week . 
 Or would you like us to phone you when the money arrives ? 
 Could you please tell me your phone number , so we'll give you a ring as soon as the remittance has arrived ? 
 Thank you . We'll inform you in time . Goodbye . 
 Yes , I am . I really don ’ t know anyone . 
 No . I was here last semester , but I didn ’ t find out about this class in time . So I ’ m taking it this semester . 
 How is it ? Did you learn anything here ? Why are you taking it again ? 
 That ’ s just what I need . Thanks so much . You ’ Ve been a big help already . 
 Nice to meet you ! 
 Thank you . I'd like Chinese tea very much ! 
 Yes , as a representative of IBM . I hope to conclude some business with you . 
 This is our common desire . 
 Yes , I have read about it , but I would like to know more about it . 
 Sure . 
 What , Hilary ? I ’ m really in a hurry ! 
 I ’ Ve been busy , Hilary . We can set up a meeting to talk about the deal , but I still feel the same way . I don ’ t think it ’ s worth it . 
 Sorry , we don't . But I think you can fly on Northwest Airlines to Berlin and then have a connecting flight on Canada Airline to Toronto . And it is the most economical flight , just 1,900 dollars . 
 At 8 am . By the way , it also makes a refueling stop . 
 Less than one hour . 
 Not so long , just one hour . 
 About 13 hours .

 Have you used your mini-bar since breakfast ? 
 Very good sir . Here is your bill . Please check and sign it . 
 That's for the breakfast you ordered from the service .

 Lucy , take my picture here , OK ? 
 What's the matter ? 
 Is it broken ? 
 What is it ? 
 Where can we get batteries ? 
 OK . Let's take a walk and look for a shop that does . 
 I would like to have shelled shrimps with cashew nuts . 
 Strawberry cake as dessert , please . By the way , could you serve my main course without garlic and put less ginger in it . 
 Let me help you with that . 
 You really shouldn't be lifting this by yourself . 
 Why are you reading the classifieds ? What do you need ? 
 Are you having any luck ? 
 Do you mind if I go with you ? 
 I learned to negotiate 9 from my mother . I thought I was pretty good at bargaining , but I had a problem the other day at Kimble ’ s Department Store . 
 I wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend . It was priced at forty dollars , so I started by offering the salesclerk thirty . 
 Silk market . 
 Yes , That ’ s right . 
 It's a perfect fit . 
 Cash , credit card , or debit card ? 
 Your signature here , please , and we're finished . 
 Bye-bye . Visit us again soon ! 
 Of course . When would you like the call ? 
 No problem . We'll give you both calls . 
 No problem . Anything else , sir ? 
 Let me know if you do need anything . 
 Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage . 
 It is hard to come by in life that you experience this kind of comfortable ! 
 Yes . What can I do for you ? 
 The volume is too loud . Would you kindly turn it down a little bit ? 
 Welcome . How can I help you ? 
 This way please . We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers . 
 Your T-zone gets oily easily , but your cheeks are dry in winter . Am I right ? 
 This " Cream of Olives " is our bestseller for combination skin . You can try it on your hand . 
 All right . Anything else ? 
 My pleasure . 
 It ’ s a skill . What can I say ? I don ’ t know why , I just have a long routine . 
 Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , but oftentimes I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine . 
 Not funny . 
 I think is looks great . I really like the light colors you have chosen . The pictures are nice too . Did you bought any new furniture ? 
 new furniture makes a room seem so fresh . I see that you also bought a new lamp for your bedside table . 
 that wardrobe looks quite big . Is it full of clothes ? 
 I like to get rid of clothes that I don ’ t wear rather than keeping them in a wardrobe . They take up too much space . There are several charity shops that you can give old clothes to . They will be 
 I need to buy some new clothes for the summer too . Perhaps we can go together one day . 
 George speaks Japanese better than Frank . 
 Therefore , I hope they could help each other and learn from each other . 
 I am worried about that Arden will display all my drawbacks in the performance review . That will be embarrassing . 
 I had a nightmare last night and I dreamt Arden told me that my performance fell short of his expectation . I was terrified to wake up after hearing that . 
 I know what you are talking about . The performance evaluation process starts from the day we're hired . There is no surprise during the actual review . 
 This is Mary speaking . 
 Oh , that sounds nice . I ’ d love to . 
 How long have you felt like this ? 
 It sounds as if you have a virus . 
 I'll give you something . I want you to take it easy and come back in a couple of days . 
 Good Morning , I have a bad cough , and I want to see an internist . 
 No , I don ’ t . I ' m a tourist . 
 Here you are . 
 I ’ d like to try traditional Chinese medicine . I heard it really works quite well if you know what you're doing . 
 Hi , Andy . I am going to Isabel ’ s . Are you coming ? 
 That is no problem at all . Isabel ’ s is having a clearance sale , and today is the last day . You don't want to miss such a good chance , do you ? 
 All right , but hurry up . It takes you hours to change . 
 I think so . They don't sell shoddy cloth for one thing . 
 She already bought that evening gown . 
 Yesterday . She wore that gown last night , and showed it off to everybody at Mr . Mile ’ s party . 
 Hurry up , will you ? We ’ ll have to go to the gas station first . 
 Hey there ! I ’ Ve been hoping to run into you . Are you busy tomorrow morning ? 
 I was hoping to talk to you about the sales projections for next year . I ’ m having a little trouble figuring out how to use the spreadsheet you set up for me . It has a lot of complicated form 
 Ooh . Sorry , that ’ s not good for me . I am tied up all day Friday . We ’ ll have to do it next week . I am wide open then . 
 Sure , that ’ ll be fine for me . I ’ ll come to your office so you can show how you set up these macros . 
 Sorry . I didn't know . 
 I'm going to use my ATM card . 
 Done . 
 No , thanks . 
 Pardon me ? 
 Paper , please . 
 Sure . Have you checked the weather report ? 
 No , thanks Mom . I'd like some toast and chicken wings . 
 Done . Oh , don't forget to take napkins disposable plates , cups and picnic blanket . 
 Yes , madam . 
 No , mom , I can manage it by myself . His help just causes more trouble . 
 I would like to buy two bottles of brandy . 
 Can I buy these tax free ? 
 Hi , Deny . Are still working ? 
 So , you are leaving , aren't you ? 
 How nice ! I can see you are busying packing . I'm sorry to interrupt you . 
 Yes , could you please go over this for me ? and see if there is any mistake in it ? 
 Excuse me for taking your time . 
 Could you tell me something about your previous job ? 
 Didn't you like it ? 
 Why do you choose our company ? 
 What do you know about our company ? 
 John , I was talking to the travel agent about where we might be taking our vacation this year . 
 What are you talking about ? 
 You and I have been together for a whole year , and our vacation time should be about the two of us ! 
 With that attitude , I don't really think we have much more to discuss here . 
 Which kinds of meat are most popular in your country ? 
 Yes , we do.We also eat a lot of lamb . 
 That ’ s right.They taste so good.We eat them with mint sauce.Have you ever tried them ? 
 I certainly can.If I can get some from the butchers , I ’ ll cook them for you . 
 Have you found another job yet , Sally ? 
 What kind of job are you looking for ? 
 You haven't had any experience in either of those fields . 
 Come on in . Let me show you around . Here ’ s the living room . 
 This is the kitchen . 
 Yes . We just renovated a few month ago . 
 Here ’ s the master bedroom . 
 $ 900 a month . 
 Yes . It includes electricity , water , gas and cable , but the telephone is extra . 
 The end of this month .

 That's no problem . Is it cash ? 
 Of course . If you could sign your name on the bottom line here , and write your address here . And please sign and date the back of every cheque and of course I'll need to see your passport . 
 Would you please recommend a diamond for me ? 
 I prefer a diamond mounted in a ring . 
 Do you guarantee its quality ? 
 Good morning , sir . May I help you ? 
 Do you want it for yourself or for your girlfriend ? 
 Please excuse me for what I said just now . What do you think of this one ? 
 Sorry . It is the smallest size we have . 
 Oh , yes . There is a big one at the right corner of the street . Perhaps you will get one there . 
 So people can go and root for their old school team ? 
 You don't sound too excited about going to your reunion . 
 Are you nervous about meeting up with your ex , Femi ? 
 Sorry , honey , something has cropped up again . I have to deal with it . Perhaps I will go to back home till very late . 
 Oh , come on . I will be back as early as possible . 
 Excuse me . I was wondering how to order office supplies . 
 I need paper , ink cartridges , and paper clips . 
 I need all of my supplies right away . 
 I will check to see what my budget is . 
 Please deliver them to my office . 
 Thank you ! 
 Yes . I'd like to book a double room with bath . 
 I plan to arrive on August fifth and leave on August eighth . 
 Li Gang . 
 That's right . 
 I see . When can I receive your confirmation ? 
 I'll log in to the Internet to know about you . I know your address . 
 Excuse me for being late to work . 
 My car broke down . 
 Yes , I'll work on it . 
 Great ! Fill me in . 
 I don't understand the projected revenues . 
 Hello , this is Steven . May I speak to Mr . Xu ? 
 I need to make an appointment with you today . 
 3 o'ctock this afternoon . 
 Yes . That would be better . 
 Good-bye . 
 Be brave , sir . It won't be long . I will fill out the form for you . What is your name ? 
 Alright Steve . Your social security number ? 
 Do you have medical insurance ? 
 Do you have your insurance card with you ? 
 Well , you can call it in later . You can phone us . 
 First I need to get your address . Try to move your arm as little as possible . 
 What are you thinking of making ? 
 How about making a teriyaki bowl ? 
 All it consists of is teriyaki beef and white rice . 
 All you have to do is cook some white rice . 
 Then cut up the beef and marinate it in teriyaki sauce . 
 All that's left is to cook it . 
 Actually , Miao Ping , I'm here to close my account with you . I'm going home , the company is transferring me back to London . 
 Next week , so I thought it was better to get this all sorted out as soon as possible . 
 Here you are , Miao Ping . Don't laugh at the horrible photo today , OK ? 
 Yes , I'm looking for a house . 
 Oh , to rent . 
 About 300 a month . 
 How big is it ? 
 Well , actually I prefer something a bit bigger if that's possible . 
 How much is it ? 
 What's it like ? 
 It sounds interesting . Can I go and see it ? 
 What kind of personality do you think you have ? 
 Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ? 
 Are you more of a follower or a leader ? 
 Hello ! I'm sorry to bother you . This is a complimentary fruit tray . Your food will be ready soon . 
 Actually , uh , I made it myself ... 
 Sorry , but I've gotta run . Enjoy your food , and ring the service button if you need anything else ! 
 I would like to buy a new fridge . 
 I was looking at this Kenmore refrigerator . 
 What's so great about it ? 
 What appliances ? 
 May I see the inside for myself ? 
 Wow ! You're right ! This refrigerator is great . I'll take it . 
 No , you'll have to get off at the bank , and take a No . 50 . 
 One dollar . 
 Two stops after this one . 
 Sure . 
 No , a No . 50 will take you right there . 
 What is it ? 
 Is the water causing any damage ? 
 I won ’ t be able to fix the pipe until tomorrow . 
 I ’ ll do it for you . 
 That ’ s true . 
 I ’ m all right with that . 
 I ’ m making a list of food and drinks . 
 What for ? For the party , of course . 
 We ’ re having a Valentine ’ s Day Party . 
 We ’ Ve invited all our sophomore friends from school . 
 That ’ ll be a big help . Well , here ’ s a list of some of the food you could buy . 
 Thanks . See you at five . Don ’ t forget to bring your valentine . 
 I had a really busy day . I had to work a little overtime . In the morning an important client called to place a large order . I had to check some things with my colleagues before confirming the order . 
 The most important thing was to check that we had the goods in stock . If the goods are in stock , we can deliver them immediately . I also had to check the price . This customer is very important , so the 
 I received a lot of emails from potential clients that I had to answer . Each time , I had to check files to see what we had agreed at earlier meetings . Each client has different conditions and required 
 Yes . That ’ s why we have everything on computer files . We don ’ t use much paper at our office . After lunch , I had to deal with a complaint form a client . 
 Yes , it was . I managed to sort out the problem , but I was tied up with the matter for over an hour . 
 That ’ s not all ! I also had to finish writing a sales report for my boss . In the end , I finished everything . I wonder what will be waiting for me tomorrow morning . 
 Yes , I would like to have a suit made to measure . 
 I want a single breasted suit . Here is the cloth . 
 My daughter . She is missing . I don ’ t know where she is . 
 She has blond hair and blue eyes . 
 She has a yellow dress on and red sneakers . 
 I just saw her down the street . I don ’ t know where she is . 
 Oh , it ’ s been uh ... fifteen minutes . 
 Will you be here long ? 
 There are many tourist attractions in Hong Kong . 
 Let me give you some brochures to look over . 
 I want to post this package to the United States . 
 By sea . 
 Great . Thank you . 
 I need to withdraw some money . 
 I need to withdraw $ 300 . 
 I want to take it from my checking account . 
 Thank you very much . 
 No . That ’ ll be all . 
 Oh , you didn ’ t know that apartments here are considered valuable , even if they are small and crowded ? 
 I don ’ t mind paying high rent to live in New York . 
 Yeah , but so what ! I ’ m proud to live in the world ’ s most exciting city . And , the salaries here are the highest in the nation , too . 
 Yes , please . That would be a great help . Are you sure you don ’ t mind ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 No , there ’ s no need . 
 No , don ’ t bother . It ’ s all right as it is . 
 It sure is.Can I see your ticket ? OK , fine . 
 About two hours out of Los Angeles . Give me the bags , I'll put'em on the bus . Here's your claim tag . Don't lose it.When you get off the bus , give it to me . 
 Is it all right to smoke on the bus ? 
 I see . Thank you . 
 There are different ways of conducting a job search . Do you know what you want to do ? 
 Can you work part-time or full-time ? 
 The binders have current local jobs listings and the computer jobs lists are good too . Understand ? 
 Schedule an appointment with a counselor and you can get more information . Would that work for you ? 
 Everything that you need for a successful job search is here . Happy job searching ! 
 No . I immigrated here three years ago . 
 Yes , I love my new life . 
 I haven't had a chance to see it . 
 The lights were out everywhere . 
 They what ? 
 That's crazy . 
 Were the looters found ? 
 I hope this doesn't happen again . 
 I am , sir . 
 Yes , sir . 
 You're kidding . We'll never make it across in one piece ! Let's cross at the light . 
 If you want to cross here , be my guest . I don't feel like dodging cars and scooters ! 
 No , I'm not sure . I think about 65 mph , right ? 
 No , Officer , not at all . 
 Well , I guess I just wasn't paying attention to the speedometer . 
 Um , because I was busy talking to my friend . 
 Yes , I was using a cell phone . I just bought it , so I decided to give my friend a phone call to tell him about it . While I did that I also turned on the radio and was listening to one of my favorite songs , and eating some food I had bought at a fast food restaurant , and , um ... guess I had too many distractions . 
 Paul ? I need to work out a time to get together with your people . 
 It would be best if everybody could be there . How about next week sometime ? 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 Can I have your key and room number , please ? 
 Here's your bill , sir . Could you please check it ? 
 Here you are , sir . You're all set . I hope you enjoyed your stay . And that next time you're in town , you will stay with us again . 
 The bell captain will put it in the storage room . When you're ready to leave , you can claim your luggage from him . 
 I like the Honda Accord you showed me before . I think it's more practical for my needs . 
 What does it come with standard ? 
 Cruise control ? I don't like that . 
 I think it's dangerous . What if I can't turn it off ? 
 I wish it didn't have cruise control . My wife doesn't like it either . 
 I suppose . And what about the sunroof ? Is that standard ? 
 I see . Another important question is the time I can get this car . I need a new car rather soon . 
 That's good enough , I think . What colors does the new Accord come in ? 
 My brother has last year's Accord.And his car is a kind of soft purple color mixed with silver . I really like that color . I wonder if I can get that color on my Accord . 
 Yes , I think that's it . Can I get that on the Accord ? 
 Well , I think I want to order the new Accord then.It looks like an excellent car . 
 Yes , I know . I think Honda is the most reliable car on the road . I would never change to anything else.The Honda I have now almost never has service problems . It runs smooth as silk . 
 Good morning . sir . How may I serve you today ? 
 Sure . Large or medium ? 
 Anything else to go ? 
 You've got it . 
 Sure . It's seven eighty-nine . 
 Thank you , sir . Have a nice day . 
 I have a need for help with writing and also a need for help with the computer work . Which would you prefer ? 
 That would be wonderful . Sometimes we will be working together and sometimes independently . Would that be OK ? 
 We start on Monday . Can you be there ? 
 I need your background information before the meeting . 
 I'll enjoy working with you . Have a great day ! 
 First , as far as I know , your company has had an impressive growth record . Second , I want to get into the foreign trade business . 
 I'm in charge of marketing activities in South-East Asia , for example , organizing trade conferences and arranging exhibitions . 
 Yes . Are there chances for employees to be transferred to overseas branches of the company ? 
 That would be good . 
 Oh , that hurts . 
 Hello , miss . I would like to check out . 
 Why ? I have stayed for 3 nights . 
 Excuse me , do you serve breakfast here ? 
 An American one , please . I am in a hurry . 
 What do you want , Essie ? 
 I don't want coffee . I'd like some orange juice . 
 I don't like coffee in this cafe . 
 Most people think so . 
 I bought this toy gun from your store two weeks ago . My son played with it only twice and it broke . 
 Yes , and I have the warranty , too . 
 I'd like you to replace this one without charge if you can . 
 No , thanks . I've had enough . 
 To tell you the truth , I am on a diet . 
 Well , I am gaining weight these days , and I have to watch my calories . 
 Yes . We've got plenty of tables in stock . Will you have a look at this one ? 
 How about this one ? 
 Seventy US dollars . 
 Of course . We are always at your service . 
 You are welcome . 
 She had a very impressive resume , but she seemed to lack the confidence that I think a good manager needs . 
 Did you notice the way that she avoided making eye contact with us while she talked ? 
 When she first walked into the room to greet us , she didn't shake our hands or introduce herself at all . I thought that was a bit unprofessional . 
 It sure would . Did you also notice the way she slouched in her chair during most of the interview ? She had horrible posture ! 
 On top fo all of that , she didn't seem to have any sense about people's personal space . she didn't keep enough distance between us when during the meeting . 
 Don't worry , we'll find someone eventually ! 
 All right . Should I take a look at your battery ? 
 ¥ 200 , please . 
 Do you want to go get something to drink ? 
 What did you want to drink ? 
 Do you know that soda doesn't quench your thirst ? 
 Soda is really bad for you . 
 You're supposed to drink water when you're dehydrated . 
 That's what will keep you from being thirsty . 
 Thanks . But I'm not so sure . Interviews stress me out . 
 I ’ ll do my best , but sometimes I have trouble being myself in stressful situations . 
 Yes ... ah ! I forgot to include my e-mail address . 
 I ’ ll be sure and do that . I also need to pick out the right suit , shirt , and tie for this interview . 
 Sort of . I prepared a list of all the people who can vouch for my experience and good work ethic . 
 Sorry , you ’ re not on it . I don ’ t think using my brother as a reference would be very convincing ! 
 Lindsay , of course , I will be more than happy to recommend her to you . 
 She freelanced with us for 3 years . She was always consistent and punctual with her assignments and a pleasure to work with . 
 She ’ s a consummate professional and a team-player . I have utmost confidence in her abilities . You can ’ t go wrong in hiring her . 
 Well , we have some new Barbie dolls . 
 Here's one — the new , beautiful Digital Barbie . This doll is hot ! 
 It's only $ 29.95 . 
 That's great . Anything else ? 
 The grand total is $ 32.42 . How would you like to pay ? 
 Thank you so much for shopping here . Here's your change and receipt . 
 Do you know what kind of internet you would like to get ? 
 You can either get dial-up or DEL . 
 DEL is the best choice . 
 It's a lot better because it doesn't tie up your phone line . 
 Well , with dial-up your internet is connected by your phone line . 
 That's right . You won't have that problem with DEL . 
 I'd love to help you ! What is your budget for the dinner ? 
 Well , what do you think about our very own hotel restaurant ? It is very upscale , with a three-star rating . 
 The Gramercy Tavern is highly rated . It has great food and live jazz , but it's not cheap . 
 I'm already dialing , sir . 
 That would be great . Thanks ! 
 Yes , I'd like to try the blueberry pie . 
 No , I'm stuffed . I'm ready for the check . 
 Thank you . 
 No , not very much . He's too ambitious and dishonest . 
 Yes . They are completely different . Paul is very sociable and much more honest than his brother . 
 I think I'm polite , careful , relaxed and shy . 
 Well . Yes , but those people always start talking to me . I never talk to them first.Perhaps I'm not as shy as I think . Anyway , you're certainly not shy ! 
 So , you'll be at my birthday party on Friday ? 
 Have you given the puppies anything to eat today ? 
 Great ! Could you please bathe them later ? 
 Thank you ! Remember that they go to the vet this Saturday . 
 We need to have them there at 11 
 Hi , is that Jason ? 
 I am calling to let you know that you are expected to come for an interview in our branch . 
 You can bring life photos , recommendation letters and certificates . 
 I will need you to take your clothes off from the waist up and put on the gown , leaving the opening in the back . 
 I will need you to face this glass plate right over here . 
 Your arms need to be raised to shoulder height . 
 So far , so good . 
 I am not leaving . I just need you to take a really deep breath , hold it , and then let it out . 
 You will be able to put your clothes on as soon as I have checked the film . 
 Have you settled the bill ? 
 OK , 400 Yuan please . 
 Sure , what do you need ? 
 Well . First you have to turn this switch on . 
 Now press this button . 
 Just a second . I'll go get some . 
 For what days , madam ? 
 Do you prefer an aisle or a window seat ? 
 How would like to pay ? 
 I have booked you for one window seat on American airline flight No . 409 . Have a good trip ! 
 Surely it is . 
 You can nod or ask questions at the right time to show that you have already understood or you are quite interested in his words . 
 Don't move from time to time . It is very impolite and will make you nervous . 
 The best would be you have a smile on your face in the interview to win a good impression of the interviewer . 
 Throughout the interview you should maintain patience . 
 Only in this way can you leave the interviewer a good impression and achieve success . 
 Fine , thanks . 
 Well , yes , there is something wrong actually . Perhaps you can give me some advice . 
 Well , last night when I returned from the theatre , I found that I'd lost my wallet . 
 Well , some money . of course , my visa , all my identity cards and some photos . 
 Yes , I've already done that , and they said they'd look for it . But we're leaving soon and I need my visa and identity cards badly . 
 Yes , quite sure . 
 But that takes too long . 
 Good morning . Sales Division . Alex speaking . 
 Oh yeah ? I could use some . What ’ s up ? 
 Could you give me an expense report ? I would like to attach the invoices for my phone bill this season . 
 That is very kind of you . I ’ m just running out of glue . 
 Hi , Francis , morning ! How are you doing today ? 
 Indeed , I agree that is not a good start . How about the meeting ? You missed anything important ? 
 Was he unhappy with you not attending the meeting ? 
 is that your rabbit ? 
 that's good of you . why did you decide to get a rabbit . 
 rabbits aren't usually that affectionate , are they ? 
 i didn't know that . Are rabbits difficult to take care of ? 
 that sounds pretty easy . Do rabbits make your house smell ? 
 can you train a rabbit to do things ? 
 that's amazing ! Has she bitten you yet ? 
 Excuse me , but could you tell me if this bus goes to the National History Museum ? 
 I see . Where do I have to change then ? 
 How far is it ? 
 I see . Thanks a lot . 
 Excuse me , do you go to the Central Park ? 
 Could you please tell me when I get to the Central Park ? 
 ( A few minutes later . ) Should I get off at the next stop ? 
 Is it a long ride ? 
 OK . I know . Thank you . 
 Hi Steve . What do you think of the new supplier ? 
 That's good service . Do we have to pay extra for that ? 
 Bill , where are we going to stay tonight ? 
 What's that ? 
 Well , that sounds good , I have never lived in a motel . 
 Oh , man . I had the best supper last night . My wife made a stir-fry and it was amazing ! 
 Well , you can keep the vegetables , I ’ ll take the meat . The stir fry my wife made was really hearty , with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion ... 
 What do you plan on making as a side dish for dinner ? 
 Do you know what kind ? 
 I wouldn't mind eating some corn . 
 What do you mean ? 
 You should throw some corn on the grill . 
 That sounds good . 
 Do you mind if I smoke ? 
 I wonder if you could help me ? 
 Could you take a picture of me to my friend ? 
 Where's the nearest tailor's ? 
 The jacket is tight in the shoulders and long in the sleeve . What about the price there ? 
 Is there a better tailor's around here ? 
 Where do you live ? 
 What's your permanent address ? 
 Where is your birthplace ? 
 Where is your domicile ? 
 Give me your telephone number , please . 
 I can't get into my room . I mean I left my room key inside . 
 Oh , did they ? Well , would you give us an extra key to the room ? 
 By the way , what should I do with the key when I go out ? 
 This is my favourite restaurant . 
 Yes , there might be some food you have never eaten before . 
 Oh yes . Like this , for example . Have you ever eaten jellyfish before ? 
 What about these ? Have you ever tried pig ’ s brains ? 
 Here is my boarding pass.Can you tell me where my seat is ? 
 Thank you . Can you please put my luggage in the overhead bin for me ? 
 Thanks so much . 
 I am sorry , I didn ’ t catch what you said . Could you repeat it please ? 
 Sorry , my English isn ’ t so good . Could you speak a little slower ? 
 I ’ m sure I can do it well . I ’ Ve always wanted to be the best in whatever I did . Give me a chance . 
 You ’ re questioning my ability ? I tell ya , I can make it ! I ’ ll talk to your boss . 
 You think so ? Let ’ s take a chance ! 
 Yes , just follow the porter , Mr.Wilson . 
 How about the repair fee ? 
 Great ! When can your technicians come to our factory ? 
 I've just contacted our technicians . They say they can go to your factory tomorrow afternoon . Can you tell me your factory's address , so they can find you easier ? 
 To provide the As excellent after-sales service is our motto . Please wait for our maintenance staff in your factory tomorrow afternoon . They will be there on time . 
 Can you drive ? 
 Are you willing to drive yourself if the job requires ? 
 One more thing , if you are wanted in this position , you must prepare to travel aboard frequently . 
 Would you mind relocating ? 
 It ’ s quite far away , though it's located in another part of the city . Are you planning to find a boarding house nearby ? 
 Good . Do you have any particular conditions that you want us to take into consideration ? 
 Then you'll need to know it's a hard job . You'll often have to work overtime or even on weekends . 
 Who's calling , please ? 
 What is it , John ? 
 I'm sorry , I've lost my tags and receipt . What can I do about it ? 
 It's a suitcase . Its colour is blue . 
 It's like this , it's square with a leather cover . 
 Yes , it is the right one 
 Here it is . 
 Ann ! Don ’ t you see the children are making so much noise here ? Why don ’ t you keep them occupied and out their mother ’ s hair ? 
 Good idea ! Well , Joan , I have something important to tell you . 
 What's up ? 
 Oh , I think it is . 
 I think it's because of your bad habits ! 
 I know you have done a lot , but you always sleep very late . Sleeping eight hours a day doesn't mean it is healthy . Sleeping after 12 is hurtful to our body , and I think this is your problem . 
 You should do better later . 
 I am afraid not . We usually design the label ourselves . You know we should be responsible for the brand labels of our goods . 
 What are they ? 
 That can be easily done . Is there anything else ? 
 We'll get the factory to meet your requirements . 
 I am interested in buying a house and need some information . 
 I am interested in Pasadena or Arcadia . 
 We need a medium-sized house with at least 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms . 
 Yes , we want to stay in the ABC School District . 
 I would love to have a home with a view . 
 Can you hold the end of this tape measure ? 
 I ' m taking some measurements for new curtains . 
 I thought we'll just fix up the wood floor.and use some paint for the walls . 
 Tomorrow we'll go and pick out some curtains and paint . 
 There are a few considerations . Is this a part-time or full-time job ? 
 Basically , you really don ’ t need to do much of anything . On the Continued Claim Form , you will note that you now have a new job and also note what you are earning . 
 You will not mess up your job benefits by taking work . You can always come back and notify EDD that you are once again in need of assistance . 
 But our younger sister is the apple of her eye . 
 Well , we can do nothing about it . 
 I want to open another account . 
 I would like to open a savings account . 
 I have another savings account open already . 
 I would like to do that . 
 I only want to transfer $ 100 . 
 Great . Thank you very much . 
 Sorry , but he's not in . May I take a message for you ? 
 OK , I'll tell him . 
 The 486 . 
 Yes , it does . 
 It's about forty-five minutes to an hour . 
 Yeah , it's not that long of a trip . 
 It starts getting more crowded the closer you get to LA . 
 You're very welcome . 
 Hi . I ’ m Tom Peterson . I ’ m looking for a one-bedroom apartment . 
 That ’ s fine . 
 Well , between $ 350-400 a month . 
 I ’ d like to live somewhere near the university , or at least on a bus line . 
 As soon as possible . 
 Fine . 
 I would like to have a dishwasher and central air conditioning . 
 Thank you . This one looks nice . Is it near the university ? 
 That ’ s good . I ’ d like to see it . 
 I am sure we do have . 
 If you want some changes , just tell me . 
 Look into the mirror and see if it'll do . 
 Welcome here again . 
 Ok , thank you . All you have to do is focus it . 
 Thank you very much . 
 I'm sure it will . 
 Sorry.We don't have a printed one . Is there anything else I can do for you ? 
 Sorry , we don't . I don't think you can find any airline which offers a non-stop flight to Tokyo . 
 Yes . It is really a place of interest and we have the direct flight everyday . 
 I'll try my best . 
 Please tell me where your daughter's home is . 
 Turn right at the second traffic light and you will see it on your left . 
 It's a pleasure . 
 I found the ideal position . I ’ m working for a plumbing company . 
 Plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge , and creativity . I love this job . 
 I didn ’ t , but I applied for an apprenticeship , and since I studied math , AND I have a good attitude 4 , my application was accepted . 
 Mom . I have to go school shopping . There's only one more week left . 
 I have this list of stuff that I need and I only have half the dough . 
 Do I have a choice ? Uh . That's a no . What can I do ? 
 What seems to be the problem , kid ? 
 Ah ... How long have you been like this ? 
 Do you have any stomachache ? 
 Open your mouth and say ah ... God , you are suffering from the swelling of tonsils . 
 Yes , I am sure that you got the flu . You need a shot . 
 Yes , that's for sure . But it is not that bad . It's gonna be all right . 
 Be brave , young man . Only girls cry when given an injection . 
 Would you consider an offer of $ 56,000 per year ? 
 Our standard package includes health insurance , two weeks vacation and a company car . 
 Uh ... not normally . What do you have in mind ? 
 What an interesting idea , Ms . Wilson . Would you also be willing to accept a cut in initial salary ? 
 Now tell me , what's your problem ? 
 Do you have a fever ? 
 Certainly not . Take one of these white pills three times a day . 
 After the meals . And do not forget to take two sleeping pills before going to bed . 
 You too . Have you lost some weight ? 
 Not some crazy diet fat I hope . 
 Good for you , keep it up . 
 The weather is so crazy . It rained cats and dogs last night , but cleared up in the morning . 
 Honey , wait for me . I am too tired to move a step further . 
 Attaboy , that's just what I am thinking . 
 Honey , be patient . It's better to wait than to climb with my legs broken . 
 Yeah , the scenery is beautiful . What's more , the air is fresh here ? 
 Of course not , I have to watch my American Idol . 
 I have some extra help with my project . What would you prefer to help me with , typing or xeroxing ? 
 That is very kind of you to offer to do that . Can you start with the pages on the table ? 
 I like your positive attitude . How many years have you been employed here ? 
 We have a really interesting project coming up . Would you want to join us on it ? 
 OK . I will mention how great you were about helping me today . I appreciate your help . 
 Yes . Sit down , please . How did you learn about our company ? 
 Why would you like to work with us ? 
 Oh , really ? Would you transfer to another company if it is not what you expected ? 
 That ’ s fine . Thanks for coming to see us . I hope to be able to let you know about the job within the week . 
 OK , what would you like ? 
 Sure and which one would you like ? 
 What can I do for you ? 
 We have many pairs for couples . Look at this counter . 
 You have a very good taste , this pair is the latest product . 
 Both of them are luminous with a time reminder function . They don't need battery , because they can absorb energy from the sun . 
 In addition , they are waterproof and shockproof . 
 We guarantee the quality of the product for 12 months . We also provide a worldwide warranty . 
 2,200 $ . 
 We look forward to your early reply and trust that through our mutual cooperation we shall be able to conclude this transaction with you in the near future . 
 I hope you'll see that we are really doing our utmost . 
 Yes . I would like to check in . 
 Yes . I am Belen . 
 No , what's the difference ? 
 I know why Mr . Fro didn't like our ad idea ! He doesn't know the first thing about coffee . 
 Let's take him some of Kitty's best and make the pitch again . 
 It's worth a shot . 
 Yes , I'm looking for a cap.Size 16 . 
 Yes.It ' s a bit tight.Have you got a bigger one ? 
 Yes , that's fine . I'll take it.Can I pay by check ? 
 Hello ? Is this the Maintenance Department ? 
 We ’ re having a lot of trouble with our printer . Could you come and take a look at it sometime this afternoon ? 
 I'm sorry , Julia ! I can't get home early this evening . 
 I know , darling . But I do have a lot of work to do , hope you can understand me . 
 Hello , Julia ? I can't hear you clearly . I'm afraid the line is out of order . Okay , B , listen ! How about I hang up now and call you back later ? 
 What can I help you with today ? 
 What's the problem ? 
 Is there anything else wrong with it ? 
 I can come down and fix that for you if you'd like . 
 How does this afternoon at 2:30 sound to you ? 
 Alright , so I'll see you then ? 
 Room service.May I come in ? 
 Sir , this is the coffee and bread you want.Can I put it here ? 
 $ 6 . 
 Certainly.Please sign your name here . 
 Yes , there is one at Sanyuan Bridge . It is a famous restaurant in the city . 
 I think so . I think you'd better make a phone call to see whether there is a table available . 
 Here is a tourist guidebook . You can look it up in the book . 
 It's a pleasure . 
 Yes , sir . We try to anticipate all our guests ' needs , including fitness . 
 Sir , the gym is just below the lobby . You can take the elevator or the stairs . 
 No , sir . It's gratis . Just take your room key so you can get in . 
 You'll be happy to know that it's open 24/7 . 
 I'm sorry , but no . We used to have a trainer , but then he had an unfortunate accident . 
 Not bad . But there is more room for improvement . 
 There were some gaps in your report . Please be more sorrow . 
 Excuse me . Do you know how to get to the mall ? 
 Do you know the address ? 
 Can you write it down for me please ? 
 Is it faster if I take Highland avenue ? 
 I think you're right . Thank you . 
 Yes , I'm looking for a book on Chinese history . 
 Could you tell me the advantages of it ? 
 There is something in what you said , but what is the rent ? 
 In my opinion , the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas . 
 Your intention is good , but I still can't agree with you . If no one would like to share it with you , you have to pay it all by yourself . 
 I agree with you in this way . But how often do you go to work or shopping per week ? 
 In my opinion , you have to go to the university every day , and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university . 
 You ran the stop sign . May I see your driver's licence , please ? 
 That doesn't justify your violation . May I see your licence , please ? 
 Well , sir , your insurance looks good , but I still have to write you a ticket . 
 Tell me , Mr . Han . What do you suggest if we establish long term business relations ? 
 I am all ears . 
 Sure . As for our financial situation , you can inquire about them in the national bank . They handle all our financial documents . 
 A very good question . It's very honorable for me to tell you that our business relations cover all over the world and they all have very good business reputation . 
 We deal with kid's clothing , women's clothing , and men's clothing . You name it we deal with it . 
 As for the regular customers , we have some favorable terms for them . 
 For the substantial regular customers , we offer 5 % commissions . 
 Fabulous . I will get the contract ready shortly . 
 No problem . How would like your money ? 
 Here you are . Please sign your name here . 
 Hi , I ’ m the superintendent of this building . What can I do for you ? 
 Sure . Let ’ s go . 
 $ 850 a month . 
 No . Utilities are extra . 
 It ’ s on the other side of this floor . 
 We allow one or two pets but you have to pay a $ 300 deposit . 
 If your pet ruins the apartment walls or carpet we ’ ll keep your pet deposit . If not , we ’ ll return your deposit when you move out . But be careful , we don ’ t allow pet snakes in the apartment . 
 We do . We will spray the apartments before you move in . 
 Will you tell me the situation ? 
 And then ? 
 I'm afraid you must give up the cash . Are you insured ? 
 I'll make a report for you and please claim this to the insurance company with this report . 
 All right , Steven . Do you have a flashlight ? 
 OK , now go down to the basement and find the circuit box . Open it and check if there are any fuses blown out . 
 You'll see it's black and has burnt smell . 
 Unscrew the burnt fuses and replace them with the good ones . You can find them on the rack in the basement . 
 Can I bring you anything else ? 
 Let me get this . 
 Are you sure ? 
 All right . If you insist . Next time it is on me , though . 
 I want haircut and perm . 
 Just cut a little off . 
 I'd like to have medium . 
 Can you tell me my choices ? 
 I want the chocolate one . I want to have it the big waves . 
 Turn the chair I can see myself in the mirror . 
 Beautifully done , many thanks . 
 Do you have Chinese medicine here ? 
 Can I have this prescription filled here ? 
 I want to check out today . My plane leaves at 3 p . m . 
 I am in Room 205 . My name is Bill Smith . When shall I check out ? 
 Oh , I didn't know that . 
 That's very considerate of you . May I have my bill ? 
 How much is it ? 
 I'd like it to be charged to my credit card . 
 Show me your passport and declaration please . 
 Do you have anything to declare ? 
 Let me have a look at the receipt . 
 OK . Do you have any advantages to work in our entry agency ? 
 Wonderful , I will give you a chance of interview . 
 Good morning ! Can you help me , please ? I'm looking for some books for my mother . 
 She's very fond of detective stories . 
 Yes . Can I help you ? 
 Yes , how would you like your coffee ? 
 We also serve sandwiches and cakes . 
 I feel chilly and I've got a pain in my abdomen . 
 Almost a week . 
 What should I do ? 
 Thank you . 
 Well , I wouldn't call them rules , but there are some things that I expect my daughter to do . 
 Setting the table and doing the dishes . 
 I also expect Cindy to tidy up her own room . 
 Yeah . She's a very responsible person . 
 Wangfujing Grand Hotels . How can I help you ? 
 Could you hold the line , please ? I will check out our room availability for those days ... Yes . we have a few vacancies next weekend . We have double rooms , suites and deluxe suites in Japanese , Roman . French and presidential styles , which one do you like best ? 
 OK . Could I have your name , please ? 
 OK , Ms . Monica . I've reserved a double room for you next Saturday and Sunday night . We will see you then ! 
 Calvin , how much money did you spend last weekend ? 
 Why don ’ t you help me save money ? You are always spending money . 
 I ’ m sorry . I guess I ’ m too extreme when it comes putting money in the bank . 
 What did you say ? 
 Well , I feel a little tired . 
 Then can you wait a few minutes ? I want to finish writing this letter . 
 I won't be long . No more than ten minutes . Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you in the park ? 
 Hello , China Travel Agency . Can I help you ? 
 Just a moment , please . I'm sorry but the flights are fully booked on that day . The next available flight is on May 2nd . They have two flights , one is at 9:30 a . m . and another at 2:00 p . m . Both flights have seats available . 
 One way trip or round trip ? 
 Economy fare for one way trip is 2,300 yuan . 
 Yes , I have confirmed your ticket . 
 Thank you . Here is the ticket and receipt . Have a good time . 
 Yes , are there any planes to Paris ? 
 Yes , please . And I'll need an economy class open return . 
 We can't go that way , the road is blocked for the next few days . 
 Some high speed chase scene , I think . 
 I think that they get a pretty good payoff . 
 I don't know about all of that , but think about it , their business gets free publicity ! 
 Can I help you ? 
 A single ? 
 Please fill out this form , sir . 
 Here are your keys . Check out time is noon . 
 No . 
 I ’ d like to use my Master Card , if I could . Hey , wait a minute ! This is a bit more than I expected . Why is it so high ? 
 What ’ s this here – “ house stock ” ? 
 I had no idea – and look at these charges for movies ! 
 Yes , that ’ s right . But I had no idea I would be charged for all this . Thank goodness my company will let me reimburse all this . 
 Hi , David . What a beautiful necklace ! Dude , I ’ Ve never seen anything like it . 
 I think seven hundred is enough . 
 Well , eight hundred , then ? 
 Eight hundred and fifty . Come on . I have 4 kids , 3 dogs , and 2 husbands to feed ! 
 Here you are , sucker ! 
 There's so much to do and so little time . 
 Yes . We're going to be married in my hometown church , the first minute of the new millennium ! 
 All set . And we're having a red bean cake and dim sum for the Taiwanese guests , just like your mom wanted . 
 Hi ! How are things going with you ? 
 Believe it or not , the company I worked for closed down , so I ’ m out of a job . 
 I am not being all that particular right now because I just need to keep a roof over my head . 
 I wish that I could get the opportunity to be interviewed . 
 I read about that , and the position sounded great ! 
 how are you doing ? 
 what happened to him ? 
 was it his first offence ? 
 what happened to him then ? 
 did they take his license away ? 
 what do you think will happen to him ? 
 that doesn't sound too promising . Does he have a defence lawyer ? 
 my sister is a lawyer . I can ask her if she can help him . 
 Did you get a good look at the suspect ? 
 Do you think you could pick him out of a line-up ? 
 Could you please look at the five men in this line-up ? 
 Do you recognize the suspect ? 
 What number ? 
 Thank you very much for your cooperation . 
 Hello , Green Trading Company . What can I do for you ? 
 Yes , it will be at three o ' clock this afternoon . 
 Didn't we make that appointment a long time ago ? 
 How about Friday afternoon ? 
 Did you hear the news ? 
 Our cousin went into labor and had her baby last week . 
 I would've thought that somebody would have told you . 
 Well , she did , her baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces . 
 Are you going to go and visit her and the baby ? 
 Good ! I just thought I'd let you know . 
 Didn ’ t you punch in this morning , Monica ? 
 That ’ s ok . I should have told you earlier . This is a company rule . 
 According to the company rule , we should punch in before 8 o ’ clock and punch out after 5 o ’ clock every work day . 
 From 11:30 to 1 o ’ clock . 
 Sometimes , but not quite often . 
 Our pleasure . We have several package tours you may choose , from ten days to three weeks in Europe . 
 I have one ten-day tour that is still available . It will depart from New York on December 24th . 
 The price for one person for a ten-day tour is only 1,099 US dollars , which includes round trip airfare . 
 Ok , but don't delay too long , or that trip will be all booked . 
 Yes , we are . Could we have the check , please ? 
 Do you accept checks ? 
 Well , I don't have any cash with me , so I ’ ll have to put it on credit . 
 Ok , please wait a minute . Can I have my food packaged ? 
 Thank you . 
 How about the Japanese ones ? 
 Oh , I see . I'll show you some . 
 We have lots of options , what type of job do you need ? 
 Do you want to work part-time or full-time ? 
 We have binders with local job listings or you can make use of the computers . OK ? 
 If you make an appointment with a job counselor , they can also provide you with a lot of information . Do you want to see a counselor ? 
 Well , you know that this job center is here for your use , so help yourself . Good luck ! 
 I ’ Ve got all the presents I need , and my family is working together to get all the food ready . That ’ s easy ; but I have another problem to deal with . 
 No , I did that a long time ago . It ’ s about telling my son the truth about Santa Claus . 
 Yes . He ’ s never said anything so I never told him . But now that he ’ s getting older ... 
 Yes , he ’ s too old to believe in that type of things . And I ’ d rather tell him before the kids at school do . 
 I can understand . I was lucky with my oldest ; she figured it out by herself and didn ’ t tell my son . 
 I'd like to open a one-year time deposit account and a checking account . 
 Okay , here are the forms . Can I use traveler's checks to open the account ? 
 Okay , here you are . 
 Thank you , Rick . We ’ Ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams , Brazil and China , face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round . Without a doubt , both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match . 
 Xu spikes it ! Wow , what a great hit ! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in ! Great play . 
 Brazil calls for a time out and we ’ ll be right back , after a short commercial break . 
 Take it easy . It ’ s no good worrying . You were on your last leg if you keep worrying in this way . 
 Hi , Dr Evans . Thanks for seeing me on such short notice . When I woke up this morning I had a really sore throat and a really bad cough . I think I am coming down with the flu . 
 Ahhhhhhhh 
 A little actually . My sinuses are a little blocked up as well-I really feel terrible . 
 Whoa ! So many drugs . . . I hate swallowing pills . Am I able to go to work ?

 Thanks doc , bye ! 
 Yes , she's almost equal to Celine Dion when she sings . 
 You can bet on that . 
 Fifth Avenue . 
 I should have ? 
 In 1986 , a New Zealander Hackett popularized Bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment . This sport is very challenging . It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance . Especially when descending , as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back , they sway around . The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it . Even if they jump off , they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes . No wonder people give the title ' brave ' to anyone who jumps off . 
 Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage . 
 It is hard to come by in life that you experience this kind of ' comfortable ' 
 It's about twelve hours . 
 Sure . Let me see ... at 6:15 a . m . local time tomorrow .

 Hi , I am so glad to see you . 
 You know , I'm about to graduate and I have to look for a job as soon as possible . But I haven ’ t the faintest idea of how to go about finding a job . 
 I guess first I should prepare a resume , right ? 
 Then what else should I put into my resume ? 
 I got it . Then I should mention my educating background and working experience , should I ? 
 I see . Is that all there is to it ? 
 Oh , good point . You mean here I should show off my special skills and talents to impress the boss .

Finally , a discussion about whether or not to implement this proposal . 
 I swear , I ’ m going to kill you for this . 
 Oh , yeah ! I had a blast ! I love sweating like a pig with a bunch of pot bellies who all smell bad . Sorry , I ’ m just not into this health kick . 
 I am wiped out . Thank you . 
 Never ! But thank you for inviting me .

 He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him . 
 Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out .

 And the host announced that he won it all ! 
 Yes . How much do you want ? 
 One dollar to five franc . Is that alright ? 
 Of course we can .

 do you have any plans for dinner tonight ? 
 I was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . What do you think ? 
 I could teach you how to cook something healthy . Frozen pizza are so bad for you ! 
 I recently saw a piece for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . Maybe we could try that ? 
 I bought all the ingredients this morning , so let's start ! 
 first , you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces . 
 yes . Once it gets hot , put a little oil in it , add the vegetables and stir-fry them for a few minutes . 
 that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stir-fried on its own until its cooked through . 
 I'll prepare it . Do you prefer white rice or brown rice ? 
 I'm going to need a taxi . 
 A private vehicle , huh ? No , a taxi is okay . 
 No , I wouldn't be caught dead in a limo . 
 I'm headed to Rockefeller Center . 
 Right now . 
 Good , I'm leaving my room in about one minute . 
 Good morning , I want a room tonight . 
 Single , please .

 Yeah . Let me see . Is this the one you want ? 
 Wu Mei . That ’ s my name . 
 Is this room with a bath room ? 
 Can you give me a quiet room ? 
 What ’ s the room rate ? 
 Three nights I scheduled . 
 Is that right ? 
 Your room Number is 827 . The bail-boy will take your bags and show you to your room . 
 Good morning . Ru Via Hotel , Room Reservation . Can I help you ? 
 How and in whose name has the reservation been made ? 
 Please wait a moment . I'll check it in the computer . Thanks for your waiting . You've booked 10 standard rooms for trade negotiation for March 5th , 6th and 7th , is it correct ? 
 Let me check the reservation list . Fortunately , we have just 10 standard rooms available for the three days . 
 I'll have to check . Can I help you with anything else ? 
 Here you are . 
 I just make eye contact with him and nod my head . Then I tell him when he comes over to the table . Why do you ask ? 
 That seems a little impolite in such a restaurant . 
 Well , it was a warm evening , so I stretched my legs . I walked along the canal for a couple of miles . Actually , several other people had the same idea . I saw Bill . 
 He seemed ok . We didn ’ t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . We just waved at each other . 
 Of course . What do you want to move first ? 
 Can I ask you a question ? 
 How do you get along with the American students in your classes ? 
 Really ? Why not ? Don ’ t you go up and talk to them ? 
 You won ’ t get anywhere that way . You ’ re the one who needs to practice English , so you should make the first move . Besides , most American students are really friendly and outgoing . They will be glad to talk to you . 
 Miss , please give something to drink . 
 Do you have whisky ? 
 Well , in that case please give me some free drink . 
 Hmm . Not bad . I think I look younger with shorter hair . 
 I just want a light wave . I look really silly if my hair is too curly . 
 Super . How long will I have to sit under the Hot Cap ? 
 Decent dressing and appearance , which contribute to a good first impression of the interviewer , are surely quite important . 
 Whatever you wear , it should perfectly reflect your confidence and vitality 
 Gentlemen should wear western-style suits in the interview , which will help you look handsome . 
 But those fashionable and shiny clothes should be avoided . 
 You should present the best of yourself in order to achieve success in the interview . 
 In a word , dressing and appearance are indeed important , but it should never be all . 
 There's a problem with my credit card . 
 A charge came up on my bill that I didn't make . 
 The charge was for a $ 350 purse , but I did not buy it . 
 I would know if I bought something that expensive . 
 It was bought on November 12th at 3 
 Until this investigation is finished , will I have to pay for the charge ? 
 Good evening , welcome to Rainbow Restaurant . May I take your coat , please ? 
 Have you booked already ? 
 OK , sir . I will show you your table . 
 Certainly . Have you decided which material you would like the suit to be made from ? We have a selection of materials over here . 
 This material is a little more expensive , but is of much higher quality . 
 Fine . I ’ ll measure you for the suit ... shoulder ... waist ... inside leg ... forearm ... upper arm ... thank you . I ’ ll prepare the suit for you tomorrow . Could you come again the day after tomorrow just to check that the su 
 Yes , they are . How many would you like and of which color ?

 Not yet . I feel too lousy to go out.Anyway , I have a flu . I know what it is . I don't need a doctor to tell me that . 
 I'm not sure yet.Maybe this will all be gone in a day.So it's probably better if you don't call off my appointments . I will call you later this afternoon and tell you what I think . 
 Yes , that's what I plan to do . Except I won't make the chicken soup.Right now I don't think I could swallow more than a spoonful of it .

 My height is one meter and sixty-eight centimeters . I've never had any vision problems . 
 One of my strengths is my friendliness and open-minded attitude and also I think I have a warm personality . But sometimes , I find it is hard to tell others when I don't like what they are doing .

 If you want to speed up your system , you ’ Ve got to clean it up first . 
 You need to free your disk space . The simplest way is to use a Disk-Cleanup tool to remove temporary files and in store programs that you no longer use . Things should be fine next time you start . You also need to control what starts up . There is a program calls Start-up Delayer , It can help to set after how much time programs should be loaded after Windows boosts . For example , you can choose to set your Fox Mail program to load 30 seconds after Windows starts up . 
 It's a beautiful day ! Let's play on those rides in the park . 
 Me too . I love to play on the swing as well . Swing is my favorite .

 If we want to get this internet business off the ground , we've got to do something fast . 
 We've got to put more buzz words into the page text , so it will pop up when people search about our kind of products . 
 I think one of the least costly ways to attract business is to ask some of our neighboring sites to offer links to our page inside of theirs . If they have related services , they may be willing to help us out . 
 Look at these gorgeous paintings ! 
 Why not take a picture ? 
 Doctor , I slipped and fell on my way to school . The ground is so slippery from the snow . It seems I can't move my left arm now . 
 What if it's broken ? 
 We were decorating and I ’ m going to ask some things .

 Then what ? 
 That's all ? 
 Would you be willing to meet the extra cost if we meet your additional requirements ? 
 That shouldn't be a problem , as long as we can make ends meet . 
 We never fail to meet our client's expectation . 
 Do you know that working overtime in some companies is a regular thing ? 
 An average ten hours or more a day according to a survey , the worst thing is that the employees get no pay for that . 
 But these people say nothing about that . They are worried about losing their job because there is surplus in labor force these days . 
 Did you have any publications ? 
 Have you received any honors ? 
 Excuse me , I want to know what's your price per dozen for exercise books ? 
 Oh , it's rather too high . We have another offer for a similar one at a much lower price . 
 If you can go a little lower , I'd be able to give you an order on the spot . 
 I hope you'll give a second thought to it . 
 What about if we order a large amount of exercise books ? 
 About 300 dozens . 
 OK . That's a deal . 
 Haven't you met yet ? 
 I'll be glad to do it . 
 Can't you just take it from my account ? I can't be bothered with cash dealings today .

 Right , so the deposit , if I don't draw on it will be blocked after you get the Deposit Certification ? 
 What do you like for dessert ? 
 Yes . 
 OK . I will bring it for you .

 Certainly , work always comes first . 
 Well , keep a low profile . 
 That depends . What is it ? 
 I'd love to help you out , but I'm a bit short on cash this month as well . I had to get a new engine put into my car , and that ate up my savings . 
 Let's see , I've got about $ 50 to get me through the weekend . I can only spare about $ 20 . I would give you more if I had it , I just don't have much money to my name right now . 
 That'd be great . Thanks ! What time should I come over ?

 I am calling to ask the position of HR manager . Could you tell me more about it ? 
 I have a master's degree in HR management in Peking University . And I worked as a HR manager in a European enterprise for many years . I know it is not just some clerical issues , but more social work with reason and patience . 
 OK , thanks a lot . See you then . 
 It all depends on what you want to accomplish in your life . 
 It's a hard question , but I'm sure the reexamination of China's economic policies in the past may lead us to a right answer to the question . After the establishment of new China , our government employed numerous economics policies to stimulate the growth of China's economy . These policies , however , favored our domestic enterprises and protected them from international competition and these policies have contributed a lot to the rapid growth of both China economy and our domestic enterprises . After China's entry into TO , Chinese domestic enterprises will have to compete with their foreign counterparts . This new situation entails some changes of Chinese economic policies . These changes will spur Chinese enterprises to strengthen their competitiveness in the long run . 
 Yes , it does . Domestic enterprises of different ownerships enjoy equal rights for the non-discrimination principle grants equal rights to enterprises , regardless of their nationality and ownership . I have found that although changes of China's economic policies are numerous , these changes are largely based on the most important economic principle ot TO agreement-non-discrimination principle . Such an understanding of principle of the changes may help us not only to have a good insight into the changes but also to foresee the tendency of the new changes of China's economic policies . 
 Alright . Have you been to this hospital before ? 
 I understand . It's good you came to the emergency room .

 It is . But unless you are critically injured , you still need to wait.You aren't bleeding , are you ? 
 Oh , that's terrible . Is it your right arm or your left arm ? 
 Can you fill out this form then ? 
 That's very inconvenient for you then.You ' ll probably have a cast on your left arm . 
 Yes , it is . But even in emergency rooms there is some paperwork to be done.Have you ever been in an emergency room before ? 
 Yes , I find jogging does good to me , so I keep on doing it . 
 I think so , too . 
 Yes . I'm looking for an apartment . I'd like two bedrooms . 
 My name's Donald Eakins . 
 It's E-A-K-I-N-S . 
 It's 1446 Pine Street .

 Good morning sir , I come to fetch me suit . 
 Here you are .

 I'm hungry , let's order up something to eat . 
 I was thinking of getting a hamburger , fries and a chocolate sundae . 
 Well I never seem to gain weight so I don't mind . 
 How about pizza or maybe some fried chicken ! Better yet , let's order some hot dogs ! 
 What's wrong with you ? 
 Well , maybe the net is slow now . Try it again . 
 It's beyond question . You can save it the same as a document . 
 It's the same as usual . The only difference lies in that you need to paste the book as an attachment . 
 There are limitations to the capacity of an E-mail . Commonly it's no more than 4 MB . 
 You can divide it into several documents to mail . Or you can download the mentioned software from the warning .

 Me neither ! Would you like to go in and buy her a gift together ? 
 We need to think about what she might like . What are her interests ? 
 You know , maybe we could get her some concert tickets . Who would know her favorite groups ? 
 Yeah , Malia would be able to help us choose a concert . 
 Good ! Maybe Malia would like to go in with us on this gift . 
 Wait for my instructions and then proceed accordingly .

 10 fifteen a . m . 
 Sorry . You have to buy your ticket at the next counter . 
 Guess what , Gilly ? I won both bids . 
 Yeah . It was so easy and super-fast , once I figured it out . 
 I should get the items within a week . But in the meantime I'm bidding on a digital video camera . 
 Thirty U . S . dollars ... and it's only been used for six months . 
 Here's your roast chicken , ma'am . 
 Excuse me , waiter , could you bring me some barbecue sauce ? 
 I'm fine for now , thanks . 
 Will you wake me up in the morning ? 
 At 7 am sharp . 
 Sounds good . I want to go get some coffee . 
 Do you want to buy a new bicycle ? 
 What happened to your old one ? 
 Let's go then . 
 I prefer something like this one - a touring bike , but it is more expensive . 
 The price on the tag says £ 565 but maybe you can get a discount . 
 May I see your boarding pass ? 
 48C . It's on your left hand side . 
 Please fasten your seat belt , miss . 
 Also , please place your carry-on luggage either under your seat or in the overhead compartment . 
 Allow me to give you a hand . 
 I see . Well , can I have a look at your phone ? Unfortunately , this phone can ’ t be used in the US . it ’ s not compatible with our 3G network . 
 Well , you ’ re in luck ! You see , if you sign up for our three-year plan , we ’ ll throw in a handset for free . 
 There ’ s no catch ! You just choose a plan , sign a three-year contract and , that ’ s it ! Actually , we ’ re running a special promotion right now , and we ’ regiving away a Blackberry Curve with our special Mega Value forty dollar plan .

 I would like to sit near the window . 
 Thank you . 
 Fast food restaurants are popular now . 
 I'd like to have a steak sandwich and a medium fry . 
 Coke please . Oh , no , a cup of hot chocolate will be fine . 
 It's OK . I can always get a clear picture on it . 
 You'd better have it fixed . 
 I want to have a bath . 
 Shower , please . 
 How much should I pay ? 
 Hey , Terry , have all the players got here ? 
 OK . By the way , the stadium is terrific . 
 We are lucky to play in a new stadium . 
 Look out . Catch the ball . You should dunk besides the three-point line . 
 Just calm down . It's just a turnover . Make up your mind and we can shoot well . 
 No problem , I once played a 2 - meter-high player successfully . 
 But that game he dunked over me for 13 times . 
 Oh , look , what's happened to Jack ? He sat down . 
 May I help you , sir ? 
 Certainly , here you are . 
 Of course . It fits you perfectly . 
 It's forty-five yuan . 
 Sorry , our prices are set . 
 Leftovers . 
 From last night ! I took the left over turkey , mixed it with some diced peppers and onions , added a little bit of mayonnaise and made some sandwiches ! 
 Well , I didn't leave the turkey out at room temperature for more than a an hour and I refrigerated it soon after we finished eating . Also , when reheating , I put it in the oven for fifteen minutes at one hundred degrees Celsius . 
 Don't worry about it ! Making a new meal out of leftovers is almost an art ! Not only do you save money , but you also get to be creative and have something different to eat ! 
 Sure . What's your date of delivery ? 
 What about the balance of the order ? Can they also arrive at our company quickly ? 
 Can you deliver them earlier ? 
 Possibly , subject to quality and delivery guarantees . 
 I was looking forward to something a bit more substantial . As you know , we have long-time cooperation . 
 Well , let's shake on that and draw up the details of the contract . 
 I'd like to get some details about a Personal Housing Loan , please . 
 You see , I've just got married and we are looking at getting on the property ladder with our first home . 
 Yes , just a simple apartment , nothing too big . 
 That's great , exactly what I need to know . Thanks . 
 What do you need to buy ? 
 Where are you going to go look for one ? 
 You don't know where you want to look for one ? 
 Do you want to know where I got mine from ? 
 I purchased mine from IKEA . 
 Not at all , but you get what you pay for . 
 Hi , I would like to send this package to China , and these postcards as well . 
 How much is this going to cost ? 
 What ’ s the difference ? 
 I see . Well , there ’ s no rush . Please send it via priority mail . Please be extra careful , the contents of the package are fragile . 
 One bottle of perfume and a watch . 
 In Boston . 
 Oh ... I go to see my sister twice a year or so . 
 Nearly ten years . 
 I can't remember , but I've got the receipt somewhere.Would you like to see it ? 
 Yes.Does that mean I'll have to pay duty on it ? 
 Ok.Here you are.Is that all right now ? 
 Yes , I did . I had a fine time . 
 I ’ m fine . Thanks for asking . 
 I would like to make a withdrawal . 
 I want to take out $ 300 . 
 I want it taken from my checking account . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 No . That ’ s everything . Thank you . 
 Hello . I'm a Financial Manager in a local company and we'd like to open a Foreign Currency Account with you . 
 We have recently started doing a lot of business with British companies , so we'd like to open a GAP account . How should we go about this ? 
 That's great . Let's begin as soon as possible . 
 Yes , sir ? 
 What kind of magazines would you like , fashion or sports ? 
 OK . I'll be right back with you . 
 I can ’ t believe these skirts are so cheap . 
 I ’ ll have to get a couple in different colors . 
 Buy them now though , or they might not still be here tomorrow . 
 Betty , something is burning . Can you smell it ? 
 Look ! The iron is still on . 
 Look at my nice blue shirt , there ’ s a big hole in it . 
 Never mind , dear . 
 Just a second ... Sorry , the line is engaged . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 We design and assemble a wide range of electric generators for hospitals , hotels anc small factories . We specialise in medium-sized generators but we're hoping to diversify into larger models next year . 
 We export to Eastern Europe and the Far East . The domestic market accounts for about 40 percent of our total sales . 
 Thanks . You know , I just noticed that these eggs are fried , and I ordered scrambled . 
 Not a problem . I can just trade my plate with his . 
 Pancakes ? I don't like pancakes . I ordered waffles . 
 I can eat my bacon and eggs while you are exchanging my pancakes for waffles . 
 That would take care of it , thank you . 
 I have 10 years financial industry experience , working for several companies . For the past two years , I have been working in an investment banking . In addition to my analytical mindset , I have a background of solid accounting principles . I am a team player and have great communication and interpersonal skills . I thrive on challenge and work well in high-stress environments . 
 My background and experience include working on a variety of projects and jobs in the financial industry . Most of my experience has been behind the scenes , doing the calculations . I want to work with clients and continue to grow and be challenged . 
 I'm not finding the work as challenging as I used to . I want to find a job that is stimulating , where I can grow . 
 One of my strengths is my ability to be flexible . I've seen companies go through many changes in structure and management philosophy . I've had to adjust my style to the new environment several times . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But by being aware of my tendency to overwork , I have learned to pace myself more and work less overtime . 
 She'd say I have a lot of initiative , I see the big picture and I do what has to be done . Second , I always meet deadlines . If I say I'm going to do something , I do it . Lastly , I have the ability to focus on what I'm working on I am not easily distracted . 
 I'm sure whatever you offer will be a fair amount for a person with my qualifications . Salary is not the most important factor to me . I'm looking for opportunity . 
 Yes , I do . What do you see as the future trends for the industry ? 
 I said , ' Do you need any help ? ' 
 Just tell me what you'd like me to do . 
 In a second . Have you got a torch ? 
 Here it is . Let's go . 
 Maybe that's why some young chaps often spend a whole afternoon in a coffee bar , surfing the net or just typewriting something with laptop . While they are savoring a coffee at a leisured pace , they are actually showing off ! 
 Then what about tea ? We need to bear in mind in the first place that tea , rather than coffee , has been the most popular drink for the Chinese people . 
 What a pity that the traditional teahouses , as depicted by Lao She , keep fading away so quickly in this metropolis . It is not easy to find an old-fashioned teahouse that suits the ordinary people's spending power either . Teahouses of today all feature a cozy , comfortable environment , and high-quality services , but can easily cost you a good deal — just like a coffee bar . 
 How about we taking a tour to Hawaii ? I have a 2 - weeks ' vacation . 
 Me , too . Why don't we get ready now ? 
 Good afternoon . How can I help ? 
 Yes , you can . Is that US dollars or HK dollars ? Both are available for exchange to RIB . How much would you like to exchange ? 
 Today's rate is 821.32 USD to 100 RIB , which isn't bad . 
 Dad , when will you finish your cooking ? 
 So what should I do now ? 
 Where's the bowl gone ? 
 Dad ? 
 OK , got it , but its shape is so strange . I don't like it . 
 Maybe . 
 Mommy , dinner , please ! 
 Maybe you should look around for an outlet . 
 Outlets have more reasonable prices . 
 No problem . Good luck . 
 That ’ s going to take a while to put together , Paul . 
 I ’ ll get to work on it right away . Anything else ? 
 Great . Well , the main issue here , as you can see , is that our expenses are through the roof . 
 Well , um , sir , the company expenditures on entertainment and travel are out of control . Look at these bills for example . Just this month we ’ Ve paid over twenty thousand dollars for hotel charges ! 
 The list goes on and on . Here , this is a bill for five thousand dollars for spa treatments ! 
 Look at this one sir , eight thousand dollars were spent in one night at a place calledWild Things ? ! 
 Sorry to have smoked in your room . 
 It ’ s very kind of you . 
 I know . I ’ ll try to give it up . 
 Are you asking me ? 
 Well , you know me . I can always eat pizza , or spaghetti . 
 I know . Don't remind me . I'm starting a new diet the day after tomorrow . 
 Show me the photos of the latest hair styles , will you ? 
 This one will suit me best.What do you think ? 
 No , thank you . 
 No , nothing of the kind . 
 What's the matter , Andy ? 
 Have you hurt yourself ? 
 Try and stand up . Can you stand up ? Here . Let me help you . 
 I think that the doctor had better see you . I'll telephone Dr Carter . The doctor says that he will come at once . I'm sure that you need an X-ray , Andy . 
 Do you have your ID with you ? 
 Well , I need your ID and $ 27 . 
 Please hurry . 
 Thank you very much . Please fill out this paperwork . 
 Here you go . 
 Thank you . Now turn in your application at Window B . 
 Good afternoon . Lilian . This is Tom Baker over at Beck ’ s Trading company . We need to arrange a banquet for next Wednesday afternoon . 
 Well . We ’ re expecting about twenty-five people and we ’ d like to spend no more than $ 20 a head . 
 No , I'm not . I am interested in some scarves . 
 Hm , It looks nice , but I ’ d like to have something warm for the winter . 
 I think that's what I want . How much is it ? 
 It's a little expensive . Do you think it's possible to get a discount ? 
 That's good . Could you wrap it for me ? 
 No , that should be it . Thank you ! 
 No , this taxi is free . 
 OK . Please get in . I'm glad to serve you . 
 It will take half an hour to get to the hotel . 
 OK , I promise we'll get there in twenty minutes . 
 Hello , Cindy . Congratulations ! I hear you ’ re getting married . 
 When ’ s the big day ? 
 Hello , my name is Clark . May I speak to Mr . Allen , please ? 
 Mr . Allen , I have just received your note which informs me that you have offered the accountant position to another candidate . May I ask why I was defeated ? 
 Experience is indeed very important , but don ’ t you think capability is more important than it ? 
 Maybe you could hire me on trial , if I ’ m not qualified for this position , you can let me go . 
 Would you show me this brooch ? 
 What is this made of ? 
 Yes , I will . But how much is it ? 
 It's expensive for me . 
 It is genuine , isn't it ? 
 Bill , will you be free at noon ? 
 We need a new filing cabinet in the office . Could you go downtown with me after lunch ? 
 Yes , the same as the one we have . And we also need some small articles in the office , such as pens , clips , erasers and sticky notes . 
 Susan has already given me a list of all the stationery which we need to buy . 
 Tina , you should have more nutritious food . Don't eat these crisps any more . 
 Have you ever heard the ads say anything bad about their products ? 
 Yes , I've been given so much , that I simply don't know what to do with it all . 
 What about these ? 
 I see.Thank you , doctor . 
 Yes , I know it is one of the leading industries in the petrochemical field . 
 Yes , I hope I will be a manager in 5 years . 
 Yes , this is Jin Lili . What can I do for you 
 There is too much static on the line . 
 Pardon ? I can hardly hear you . I will call you later . 
 Where ? 
 That'll be 64 cents . 
 Sure . The total comes to twelve dollars and eighty cents . 
 That depends on the weight . 
 Excuse me , would you like a drink before your meal ? 
 Would you like a drink ? 
 Ok , here you are . 
 Well , all the drinks including beer are free of charge . 
 Don't worry . It would be back again a little later . 
 Yes , may I have some more beer ? 
 I think I may rent this apartment from you . 
 Can you tell me how much I would have to pay for rent ? 
 That ’ s way too much . 
 I can afford about $ 800 a month for rent . 
 How much more are you thinking ? 
 That ’ s almost perfect . 
 Could you bring me some food , please ? 
 Can I have a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare ? 
 Oh , no filet ? Okay , porterhouse will be fine then . 
 Not tonight , but thank you for the suggestion . 
 No problem . 
 I'm worrying that she may be lost . 
 After all , she is a five-year-old kid . 
 Room service.What can I do for you ? 
 Have you turned on the air-conditioner ? 
 I am sorry , sir.We will send our staff right now . 
 Good afternoon , I want to pick up a new shaver since the old one has retired . 
 I'm still not sure . The type with top quality , I guess . Well , which one do you recommend ? 
 It doesn't matter much . If it has high quality and reasonable price , it will be OK . 
 Do you have a warranty on it ? 
 If there's something wrong with it in a week , can I come back to change it ? 
 OK . I'll take one . 
 What kind of beef would you like to get ? 
 How many pounds would you like ? 
 What kind of ground beef do you want ? 
 I can get that for you . 
 You're welcome , Let me go wrap the ground beef up for you . 
 I want to change rooms . In fact , I want a refund for tonight ! 
 Cockroaches have declared war on my room ! 
 Thank you for not asking me to collect the roaches in a jar as evidence . 
 We have some quality-control problems . Mr . Zhang . We need to go to the source to work them out . 
 The complaint rate for our new product line is very high , almost eight percent . 
 Yes . We keep finding problems when testing the sound boards . 
 The least expensive , but still fully functional . And we think that your factory needs to take measures to improve quality-control . 
 I am afraid that is not acceptable . Your contract says that you will deliver a product with a reject rate of less than six percent . 
 Why don ’ t we go for Teppanyaki tonight ? 
 Actually , I haven ’ t had a pizza for a while . Let ’ s do that then . 
 If it were up to me , I ’ d prefer to go to Pizza Hut . The toppings are much tastier . 
 See you tonight . 
 Yes , it is . Please put your luggage on this scale . 
 Yes , it is . How many pieces of hand luggage do you have ? 
 What happened ? 
 What ? Why ? Can ’ t you renew it ? 
 Well , I can help you pack . We should start looking for a new place for you ASAP . 
 Well , let me know if there ’ s anything I can do to help out . 
 Can you help me , please ? Is there a public restroom near here ? 
 Oh , no ! ! My son needs a bathroom . 
 Where on Grant Street ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 How do I know when to tell EDD that have I started a new job ? 
 So I guess I have to report that I ’ Ve found a little bit of work . 
 What about if I find a job that I know will only last for a couple of weeks ? Can I take it ? 
 I'm sorry . Is that bicycle yours ? 
 I backed into it while I was trying to get into the parking lot . 
 I'm really sorry . I'll face the music . 
 Right here . See the scratch ? 
 I ’ d like to withdraw some money from my account . 
 Sure ? 
 That ’ s right . 
 Yes , I would like to buy a pair of dress shoes . 
 Ten and a half . 
 No , I don't like black . What have you got in brown ? 
 Oh , Lord , no . Those are ugly . What else do you have ? 
 Hmm , they're not too bad . 
 I graduated from Hebes University . 
 I majored in Economics . 
 I take more than 50 courses in university , including microeconomics , macroeconomics , marketing principles , sales management , statistics , and so on . 
 I did well in university . I was one of the top students in the class . 
 I didn't minor in any subject when I was in university , but I attended English and computer courses . And I am currently studying finance in a training school . 
 Yes . I have given all the designers notice of meeting by telephone . 
 Yes , I have prepared . I have also prepared a meeting memo . 
 I have also got them ready for the lecture . 
 Sure . 
 I have prepared name cards to be put on the conference table for everyone to sit by . What time would you like to provide the refreshment ? 
 What does a housing go for in south mountain district ? 
 We ’ re looking for a three-bedroom home . 
 Under 300,000 RIB , we suppose . 
 What about a two-bedroom house ? 
 I see . 
 Okay , I will take it into consideration . 
 I know . There are too many cars on the roads these days . 
 Yes , there ’ s too much pollution too ! 
 Yes , I'd like to check out . 
 Jack Remington , room 1408 .

 Ok , could you tell me your room number and your name ? 
 And when would you want us call you this time ? 
 Ok , six thirty AM . We will call you exactly on that time . 
 Cheers ! 
 I like it , but there is one problem . 
 The faucet in the kitchen is leaking . 
 That leak is a problem for my water bill . 
 The leak must be fixed . 
 I will not rent the apartment with that leaking faucet . 
 Thanks for understanding . 
 Yes , and you must be James . It's nice to meet you at long last . 
 No , thanks . I'm fine . Did you have a nice holiday ? 
 I stayed in L . A . and it was sunny the entire weekend . We spent most of the time at home but we did go see King Kong on Christmas day . 
 It was better than I expected . But , you know , I think I would have enjoyed skiing in Tahoe even better . Do you go there often ? 
 I don't blame her . I really enjoyed it there when we went a few years ago . I'd like to go back sometime soon . 
 Did you hear something ? 
 It is a good habit to set your cell phone to vibrate . It is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices . 
 Maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done . 
 Good Morning , Mrs . Schmidt ! I see you're standing on your head again . 
 I have to finish preparing a paper for my Western Civilization class . 
 Actually , I study a lot less here than I did in Taiwan ! My classes are great , though . Sociology is the perfect major for me . 
 I just have some cereal each morning . 
 I don't always have time to make breakfast . 
 What do you have for breakfast ? 
 That's a good idea . 
 It doesn't take much time to make ? 
 Why don't you make me some oatmeal and toast ? 
 Oh , yes , that is a beautiful color . It has been very popular blush this season . I have two left . 
 Have you heard about our special promotion this month ? If you purchase at least 18 dollar 50 cents in any Elizabeth Arden products , you will receive this black poke with a sample of lipstick , mascara and two shades of white shadow . 
 I'd be glad to . Do you need anything else ? 
 That would be my pleasure . I'll wrap the perfume up in the gift box for you too . 
 And what does that entail ? 
 How can I do that ? 
 Good , morning ! Can I help you ? 
 Yes . there are trains at 7:59 , 9:18 , 10:32 and 11:55 
 At 9:36 . And the 9:18 gets to London at 9:55 , the 10:32 at 11:09 . 
 There's one at 19:00 and the next is at 19:40 . 
 Single or return ? 
 If you get on before 4 p . m . or after 6 p . m . there is saver return which is $ 9.45 , an ordinary return is $ 16.45 . 
 Check out these wheels ! 
 No , I borrowed it . 
 You guessed right . Besides , the color violet is a little girly for me ... 
 Excuse me , what time is the next train to New York ? 
 Is it a through one ? 
 Well , please give me a first class ticket . 
 Yes , luckily our office is just down the street . 
 Oh , I see . 
 Jenny , what are you going to do tomorrow morning ? 
 I'm thinking of taking you and Peter swimming . What do you think ? 
 But swimming in the winter is good for your body . Believe me . 
 Ok . I understand that we basically work form 8: 30 to 5:30 with an hour-long lunch break from 12 to 1 , right ? 
 That ’ s fine . Is it OK to have a coffee break during the working day ? 
 How often do you have meetings ? 
 I ’ Ve met some of my colleagues already . I ’ m sure we ’ ll get on well together . 
 I was told to take a look at it this afternoon and take care of all the paperwork . 
 That ’ s fine . I need to learn how you do things here first . Salaries are paid directly in to our bank account , aren ’ t they ? 
 Hello . Did you enjoy the tour of our new premises ? 
 Of course . As we provide many different services for all of our valued customers , we like to give than a special place to do their business with us . 
 There are all kinds of deposit services and also the calculations of the interest . It's specific to different accounts and different circumstances . 
 There's information on deposit or loan rates , exchange rates ... 
 Yes , it sure does . And with our new premises , we have new services . We can provide 24 - hour support for your Wealth Management . 
 Bob , look at this sentence . ' Healthy eating is not about strict nutrition philosophies , staying unrealistically thin , or depriving yourself of foods you love . ' It's interesting , isn't it ? 
 I believe they are careful calculations on proteins , vitamins and calories . 
 Healthy eating is not about depriving oneself of the foods one loves . So we are free to have whatever foods we love . It is unbelievable . 
 Seriously ? 
 Maybe nowadays people hold different opinions on healthy diet . 
 But one must have some basic ideas about nutrition and find the best way for the nutrients to work out for the body . 
 Rather difficult . How about you ? 
 Rather . I'm afraid I didn't do very well . 
 That's because you did well . 
 Why ? 
 Where to , ma'am ? 
 The Grand Hotel ? 
 No , Madam . I don't think I do . 
 Oh , yes . I know where it is . 
 Yes.If you don ’ t mind sharing room , there ’ s one available . 
 30.00 dollars a week . 
 I ’ m on my way out now.Could you come back in an hour ? 
 Sure . The color is perfect for you . 
 It's made of cotton . 
 We can offer you a 5 % discount . 
 Well , what do you suggest then ? How about 8 % ? 
 What ? You want to drive me bankrupt ! You can't expect us to make such a large reduction . 
 How about lo % ? This price is already a little tight , our profit margin is not that large . 
 This is the Pan-American Club.May I help you ? 
 Yes , of course.The guest speaker is Professor David of a University , and he'll be lecturing about The impact of the Oil Crisis on Latin America . 
 Is our destination the amusement park ? 
 What are you going to enjoy ? 
 I like neither . 
 OK , let me think . The roller coaster looks more fun . 
 It doesn't matter . We can go to the ferris wheel later . 
 Oh ! ! ! I have a horrible toothache . 
 Nothing works with my toothache now . 
 I hate dentists . 
 It always hurts . I hate going . 
 OK , OK , I ’ ll go . 
 I'm calling to ask about your apartment advertised . 
 That sounds fantastic ! But I am looking for something closer to the downtown , as I spend most of my time at the office . 
 I'm sure it is wonderful , but I need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost . 
 Great ! I'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . Could you tell me the detailed address ? 
 Ok . Thank you . 
 Well , let me see . What price range do you have in mind ? 
 How about this one ? This is just $ 20 . It's worth every penny of it . 
 Only English . 
 I have passed CET - 6 and I am proficient in reading and translating foreign materials . I have rich translating experience because I used to be an English translator . 
 I have received an oral English training and I can communicate with others fluently . 
 Yes , I did . I got 600 in TOEFL and 2 , 300 in GRE . 
 I started to learn English when I was in primary school . 
 The amount of English I know enables me to do general desk work . I believe the amount of English I know is sufficient to work in a South Korea firm . 
 Do you have anything to declare ? 
 What's in the bag ? Would you mind opening the bag ? 
 NO.You don't have to pay duty on personal belongings . 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 Well , our store offers a 90 - Day return policy and the manufacturer offers a one-year warranty on any factory defects .

 When would you like the installation to be done ? 
 The only time we can come on Friday is at 3 
 I'm sorry , but we're booked up on Friday . 
 Saturday is perfect . What time would you like ? 
 That's perfect . See you on Saturday . 
 Marry is not in right now , she went shopping with her mum . 
 That's all right . We don't go to bed early . 
 Why ? 
 It is all up to you . 
 Yes , miss . What was the problem with your purchase ? 
 Would you like to have them altered ? Or would you like a different size ? 
 I'm sorry , but this was on sale , so I can only give you store credit . 
 Of course ... here you are . I'm sorry the pajamas didn't work out for you . 
 We're glad to be able to offer our services to your business , Mrs . Wayne . 
 Almost twenty years . We were the first total PR services company of our kind in California . 
 Well , yes , but now we have six offices in California alone . 
 That's right . We are their sole PR sector business . 
 Not long actually . So I'm sure I will learn a lot from our cooperation . 
 Dad , I haven't thought about it . I'm still young . 
 I like playing the piano . 
 Can you help me ? The program is not responding and I don't know what to do . 
 No . It isn't . 
 But I can't move the cursor at all . My screen is frozen . What should I do ? 
 Yes , but nothing's happened . 
 I've never done that before . Will I lose all my files ? 
 Who is the next ? 
 All right . Over here , sir . How are you today ? 
 How do you want you hair cut ? 
 Yes , sir . I will use the scissors.Do you always part your hair on the left ? 
 That will be 3.50 dollars . 
 Thank you very much . Come back to see us . 
 We , I ’ d like to go to Australia . I know it ’ s far to go , but I think it would be something different and special . 
 There are beaches in Australia too , but I would prefer a more active holiday this year . We could visit Ayers rock and the great barrier reef . It would be so exciting . 
 Oh , come on ! A tour of Australia would be relaxing because you ’ d be doing something different and not working . 
 I think we should go for two weeks . We could spend a week in the bush and a week at the great barrier reef-including a few day on the beach for tired office workers ! 
 We could hire a car and travel around the interior of Australia for several days . If we hire a car , we can go where we like . 
 It looks like I might have convinced you to go to Australia ! 
 Yes . May I help you ? 
 Just a minute . I'll check if there is any availability . I'm sorry , sir . There isn't any table left for 7:00 , but we can give you one at 8: 00 . Would you like to make a reservation at that time ? 
 Usually , the restaurant will be quieter at that time . 
 Very good , sir . A table for 6 at 8: 00 this evening . May I have your name , please ? 
 Thank you very much . Bye . 
 Just a moment , please . I ’ ll see if she ’ s free . 
 Sorry , Becky can ’ t come to the phone right now . 
 Did you enjoy the restaurant ? 
 What do you think the problem was ? 
 How did you feel about the food ? 
 I don't think that the service was good , either . 
 Would you like to return to this restaurant ? 
 Excuse me . Miss , what does the doctor say about me ? When can I be discharged ? 
 Great , thanks . But how can I get discharged ? 
 Yes , I will . Thanks for your care . 
 Linen.It ' s ideal for summer wear . 
 Certainly.It has been specially treated . 
 Yeah , what's the matter now ? We've had so much trouble with this case already . Don't tell me there's more bad news . 
 What ? What does that mean ? Why won't there be any results ? 
 Oh , no , you can't be serious . I never expect anything like this would happened . What are we going to do ? 
 I'd like you to bring me some food . 
 Please send up a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare . 
 Sure , I love porterhouse , too . 
 I'd love to , but I'm allergic to strawberries . 
 Go right ahead . 
 That dog has white long hair . It ’ s lovely . 
 What ’ s her name ? 
 My dog has spots . He is very strong . 
 Thomas , would you be so kind as to lay the table for me ? I'm busy in the kitchen . 
 They're all here . 
 Thanks a lot . I'm most grateful . 
 Would you like me to leave the samples with you ? 
 Fine , Mr . Grant . Thanks for your time . I ’ ll talk to you next week . 
 Yes , of course . 
 Sorry , sir , you have to pay in the check-out counter . It's there . 
 When should I come for work in the morning ? 
 When does the job start in the afternoon ? 
 Have you finished ? 
 Would you like some of coffee ? 
 Yes sir , one moment please . here is the check . 
 Here is the change . 
 Thank you very much sir . 
 good morning , doctor . I feel terrible . I ’ Ve got a cold and I have a rash here on my neck . I ’ m not sleeping well either . What do you think the problem could be ? 
 yes , I bought some medicine at the chemist ’ s . I ’ Ve been taking it for three days . 
 OK . I can afford to take a fell days off work . 
 yes , I have . I had to get a project finished . It ’ s done now , so I can relax a little . 
 I have a bad headache , but ... 
 thanks doctor . I ’ ll get these immediately . Goodbye . 
 87 cents . 
 It ’ s on sale this week . 
 Here ’ s your change . 
 Have you ever climbed the mountain before ? 
 Now your dream comes true . Do you know the altitude of the mountain ? 
 I just discovered that I owe $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered . 
 That is absolutely incorrect ! I was out on the town Monday night . 
 Thank you for taking my word over the computer's word . 
 You can 
 Absolutely unbelievable ! You people should be ashamed of yourselves . 
 To get around your difficulty , Mr . Brown , I'd suggest that you reduce your order by half . You can send in an Addi trional order later . 
 A month before the time you want the goods to be delivered . 
 Getting the goods ready , making out the documents and booking the shipping space - - all this takes time , you know . You cannot expect us to make delivery in less than a month . 
 When will that be ? 
 You can rest assured of that . We'll book you order and inquire for the shipping space now , so that shipment can be effected within two or three weeks of receipt of your L / C . 
 Very good . Well , thanks to your cooperation , our discussion has been very pleasant and fruitful . I sincerely hope that the volume of trade between us will be even greater in the future . 
 Well , this is something new . A few of our friends from Europe have also suggested that we participate in joint enterprise with them dealing in some of our goods . We think there are a lot of details to go into . 
 Naturally , I appreciate your efforts in pushing the sale of Japanese arts and crafts . But I'm not in a position to discuss your proposal today . I must first talk to our director , and discuss it with you some other time . 
 We'll talk about it next time . Now that everything is settled , let's have a cup of tea , and take our minds off business for a change . 
 Thank you for your compliment . I bought this PC with my first-month salary . I am getting to know the on-line trade . 
 Yes , I often do business through internet now . 
 Yes , very gorgeous . Sometimes , I can deal with my business without stepping out of our house . 
 Firstly , it is convenient . And secondly , it has low cost , because you know you only need to pay the fee of internet service . 
 The most important is that it is very convenient . You know you can browse the website and send E-mails to your customers at any time . Even you can have e-contract with your regular customers . 
 Sure , but every coin has two sides . Doing business through the internet is not as safe as doing business through traditional ways . 
 Of course , such as Alabama , which is a famous website . 
 That'll be 12 dollars and 95 cents , please . 
 Oh , you don't have anything smaller ? 
 Oh , sure . Credit card is fine . 
 Good ! Have you got the recruitment information on marketing ? 
 Really ? That's great ! Tell me . 
 What do you think of this job ? 
 Then how about the others ? 
 I have heard about electronic commerce , and many people say it has good prospects for development . 
 Come on ! I believe you will succeed . 
 Good idea . I will think it over . 
 My fault . I didn't realize what time it was . 
 Not really . I'm telling the truth . 
 This is true , but it must've slipped my mind . 
 I know . I should've called . 
 You want to throw me out over this ? 
 That's fine , because if I leave , then your rules won't matter . 
 Yeah . I am so excited that Obama won . 
 That man just made history . 
 I sure did ! What about you ? 
 I am still in shock to know that he was elected . 
 I pray that he actually makes things better in this country . 
 I know he will , too . 
 You came to the right place . Any particular decade ? 
 We just got one in yesterday , so now we have six . 
 Yes , we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures . 
 That one truly is a beautiful piece of work , isn't it ? 
 Oh , no . Everything we sell here is ‘ as is . ' 
 If it breaks down , maybe you can find a repairman on the Internet . 
 I was doing quite well at college . I completed my MBA degree in international trade with first-class honors . 
 I selected my college because it had an excellent academic reputation . 
 My favorite recreation is cooking . I learned to cook Chinese dishes and western style dishes as well . It keeps me busy and makes me happy . 
 Yes . I'd like to look at lipstick and eye shadow . 
 Well , brown . 
 But they're purple . I prefer a brown set . 
 Well , I'm not so sure . Most of my make-up is brown . 
 Can I try it ? 
 No . 
 Not bad . Actually , it makes me look younger . I like it . 
 You're right . I'll take them all . 
 Surely of course . 
 Yes . How long would you like us to keep it ? 
 Look ! Allen has the mic ! 
 That was before he heard Stanley sing ! I guess he couldn't stand it any more , so he decided to give it a try himself ! 
 And he can move . too ! He dances like Ricky Martin ! 
 Sure Paula , shoot ! 
 Yeah , What happened ? 
 And so ... 
 Hold on , Paula . It does sound pretty serious . But I ’ m sure you can work this out . 
 Sure , I ’ d be glad to help you straighten things out . Why don ’ t I stop by at about seven thirty ? 
 It's Mrs Bardot , isn't it ? 
 I'm Greg Wu , Head of Consultancy . I see that you'd like a credit check done for your company . Is that right ? 
 I see . So , it's not for your company , it's for the prospective partner ? 
 I couldn't agree more . If you have the company details with you I can get on with that right away . Is there anything else that you need from us today ? 
 We do indeed . Such as making trade investments , financial consultancy , and of course the service you requested . 
 Hello , Steven . We're thinking of appointing an agent for our products . I want you to find one for us . 
 The agent we are looking for will help us in Britain with publicity , advertising and so on . 
 What course did you like best ? 
 Do you feel that you have received a good general training ? 
 Oh , no . We ’ re going to be late for the meeting . 
 Oh , good . 
 Well , cabs are more expensive than the bus or the subway . It ’ ll probably cost around six dollars . 
 I can ’ t find the business card . Do you know the address ? 
 Right . 
 Please show me the menu , Miss . 
 Yes . I'd like an Italian soup to start with and then some fried noodles . 
 Yes , I'd like another cup of coffee afterwards . Make it hot , please . 
 I really like what you have . But the price for this product is much higher than we expected . I am absolutely not a buyer at that price . 
 I understand that . If you can lower the price by 10 percent , we have a deal right now . 
 Err , well , I can ’ t decide right now . Do you mind if I have a small internal discussion on this first ? I will tell you our decision this afternoon . 
 I am sorry to tell you that you failed in the job interview in our company . 
 It is hard to tell . Maybe it is because you're not resourceful enough to be a manager . 
 Two burgers , please . 
 Could I have your name , please ? 
 How do you spell your last name ? 
 Right . Thank you very much ! 
 I'm so tired . Let me sleep for five more minutes . 
 I know , but just five more minutes . 
 I promise I'll wake up , in five minutes . 
 I realize that , and I can do all that when I wake up in five minutes . 
 I'm not going to be late today . 
 Thank you . 
 It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld . 
 Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ? 
 I've had that problem too many times . So I learned to save.When I'm writing something , I save every three sentences or so . I don't want to lose anything . 
 What are we going to do now ? 
 I wonder how much of the city is down . 
 Maybe . But if there's a blackout , probably the pubs are closed.And besides , I know you have a political science exam tomorrow . I thought you had a lot of reading to do . 
 I have a flashlight in my closet . If you want to use that to read , you can . 
 I like your idea of getting a beer . I think I'll go out myself . 
 No , it just won't work.If I read for your exam , you won't know the answers tomorrow . I will . 
 How many students are in the class ? 
 So it won't work , old buddy . They'll see that I'm not you . Sorry . 
 How much will our order from your factory be ? 
 I'm afraid I can't wait that long . Can your office at least provide me with a ballpark figure ? 
 Just give me an estimated figure for an order of 100 units . 
 Your estimated is seems a little high to me , we're willing to pay $ 80 per unit . 
 This is exciting ! Thank you so much ! 
 Boy oh , boy ! This is so cool . Let's rock and roll ! 
 Which one of these is the gas pedal ? 
 Yes , could you show me to your coat section ? 
 Oh , These are exactly what I ’ m looking for . 
 I'd like to try them on for size . 
 This seems to be my size . 
 Do you really think so ? 
 Alright , I'll get it . 
 Great . What about the surrounding area ? 
 That ’ s good . Is the location easily accessible ? 
 Hmm . . . well , maybe we can buy this one then . 
 It is so popular among people to preserve health now , so I read some books about health food . 
 Drinking warm and fresh water in the morning on wakening up is one of ways to keep healthy . 
 Warm water can be good for your stomach , which is empty at that moment . And freshness can keep the water active to clean your digest system . 
 Yogurt , because it has protein , vitamins and it is acidic . If you drink it everyday , your stomach will be more comfortable . 
 yes , it's a good company . But the management changed last month . We didn ’ t get along , so I quit . 
 I'm qualified for this position . And I've heard a lot of good things about your company . 
 You take care of your employees . And your company offers good salaries and benefits . 
 I've got over seven years ' experience working in this kind of position . I know I can do a good job in this position . 
 How is this one ? It's the latest , made of cashmere . 
 Sure . 
 Do you play cards ? 
 What's the English for Hongtao , Leitao , Meihua and Fangpian ? 
 Is this the Central Park to East Market bus ? 
 To the Municipal Government Hall . 
 Thank you . 
 Okay . Do you have your receipt ? 
 I am sorry , but you need a receipt for a refund . 
 Perhaps you would like to talk to customer service . 
 They're right upstairs . 
 Good luck . I hope someone can help you . 
 Yes , could you tell me if there is a laundry in this hotel ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Here is your bill . It's $ 60 . 
 It's for the drinks . 
 Sure . 
 Come in , please . 
 In 3 months or so . 
 Did I ? Well , anyway , you will get your raise when the economy starts picking up . 
 Yes . 
 Nah , don't be so fast . We like your work here , but this company is on hard times and I can't be handing out raises for anyone . 
 I hear what you're saying , and I wish there were something I could do . 
 So can you fix it ? 
 What do you mean ? I bought this computer just three years ago ! 
 OK , I know where this is going . How much will it cost me to get a new computer ? 
 I have no idea what you are talking about . I just want to know if it ’ s good and if I will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time ! 
 It's an ugly day today . 
 It's the middle of summer , it shouldn't rain today . 
 Yeah , especially since it's ninety degrees outside . 
 Yes , it would be . 
 Me too . I can't wait until winter . 
 I'd rather be cold than hot . 
 Welcome to Youth Travel Agency . Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Why not come here and have a look at the guidebook ? 
 Let me see . It's a one day tour . 
 I appreciate your remarks . And we are always happy to do more business.But , you know , if we take on a contract to produce new products , we want to be confident the product is marketable . Because , to start producing new things requires a lot of preparation.It requires a lot of investment for us . 
 I would like to offer you a good price.But I won't be able to do that if I think this is a one-shot deal.So I would like to have some confidence in your idea . 
 Yes , of course . 
 And I would say the logo is successful mainly because it comes from Japan.It is the Japanese that have made it a fad . 
 So what you are really trying to sell is a fad . 
 I understand . But why won't you show me the logo ? 
 I see . The problem , however , is that I can't be confident in giving you a good priceless I am confident your product will last . 
 Alright . I understand . Right now you just want estimates . 
 Good morning . May I help you ? 
 He's not in , I'm afraid . 
 I am sorry , I don't know . 
 Certainly . 
 I'd like to speak your export manager , please . 
 This is Mrs Wang , from Jane coper . 
 When will he come back , do you know ? 
 May I leave message ? 
 Please ask him to give me a call as soon as he return . he has my number . 
 thank you . goodbye . 
 It still feels really strange to me . 
 How does it feel to be in charge of so much money ? 
 I guess you could choose that if you wanted . 
 Dad really knew what he was doing when he chose you to take over for him when he was gone ! 
 Thank you.Just put it on the table . 
 En , would you please give me some bread please ? I am hungry now . 
 Good morning , welcome to Bank of the USA . How may I help you today ? 
 Okay , have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ? 
 It ’ s alright , I will take you through the procedure . Are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ? 
 Okay , I ’ ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank ’ s address and phone number . 
 Well . You ’ Ve come prepared . I have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . It ’ s a simple transaction , and we can process it today . 
 It ’ s my pleasure . 
 Oh , come on ! I have sixteen items ! Cut me some slack , will ya ? 
 Plastic . I also have a couple of coupons . 
 Darn ! Oh , well . I guess it ’ s just not my day . Thanks anyway . 
 Yeah I got a club card . Here you go . 
 Debit please . Also , could I get cash back ? Fifty dollars would be great . 
 can you give me a hand with some things in the kitchen ? I don ’ t think I can finish everything in time . 
 first of all , I need you to do the drying up . I ’ m almost finished the washing up . I ’ m going to clean the cooker when I finish . 
 we ’ ll have this finished in no time with two if us working on it . 
 actually , it was just some leftovers from yesterday . I made far too much food to eat alone . I am glad you could come over to help me finish it . 
 yes . Look in that drawer . I should throw the old one out . 
 Are you looking for part time or full time employment ? 
 So you are interested in being with a company for the long term ? 
 Here is an application . Please fill it out to the best of your ability . Did you bring a resume and references ? 
 Keep them until you ready to give me the application and you can turn them all in at once . 
 I ’ d like to buy these shoes . 
 The price tag says $ 99.99 . 
 Oh , of course . How silly of me to forget . 
 I think I have the cash . Let me check . Yes , here you are . 
 Thank you . 
 Why did you ask that ? Do you want to buy the used goods ? 
 You know the car I'm driving , which is still in good condition though it is second-hand . And it only cost me 300 dollars . It was so cheap . 
 It depends . So you must be careful buying second-hand goods . 
 Yes , I am expecting some money wired to my account from Taiwan . Would you please check if the money available yet ? 
 We're on the same team here , Elvin . I'm being nice because we need to get along together . 
 If we want to beat WebTracker , we're going to have to work hand in hand . 
 You'd rather lose to WebTracker than do things my way ? 
 Mom , can I have more allowance ? 
 I want to buy more books . 
 Of course not ! I'm telling the truth . 
 Steven , I am ready for breakfast . 
 It's in that pan there . Your boy Dean broke the silex yesterday , so I have to boil it in the pan . 
 That's good . You can make breakfast yourself if you don't like it . 
 I warmed a couple of snails , and your eggs are in the frying pan . 
 Don't worry . It's only ten to seven . You must have forgotten to set your watch back . 
 Yeah . Keep on eating your breakfast . You can catch the early bus . 
 Is there any way we could get a better warranty on this product ? 
 That might not be ideal because there would be some drawbacks to an annual contract situation that might make it difficult to sell to our buyers . What about free delivery ? If we make a large enough order , could you waive the deliver fee ? 
 That would be fine . We could accept a lower rebate . 
 For a local paper in York called the York Herald . Actually , I started with them as an intern in the beginning . I was really keen on getting some experience in the journalism , and this seemed like a g 
 They seemed impressed , and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . I ended up staying two years there actually . I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . I really 
 Yes , that ’ s right . My husband and I moved to London , and so I managed to find a position with a National newspaper based in London . 
 Yes , in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future . 
 Well , I felt like baking , so I made some muffins . 
 Sure , I'll take mine , sunny side up . 
 You know , my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for twenty years . It drove my mom crazy ! 
 You ’ re so picky sometimes . 
 I said sunny side up ! How many times do I have to tell you . 
 Oh , here you are . 
 Yes . And come here for tourism . 
 Twenty days . 
 Yes , here is the form . 
 Yes , only one travel bag . 
 Nothing but several personal effects . 
 What is this big box at the front door ? 
 What did you get yourself into ? 
 So , what's in the box ? A fridge ? 
 I guess you'll read the fine print next time , won't you ! 
 Take me to this address , please . 
 How much do I owe you , sir ? 
 Are you kidding ? The meter says 15 dollars , doesn't it ? 
 I don't get it . I'll go and have our doorman talk to you then . 
 Dental clinic . This is Mr . Adams . 
 All right , David . Is this for a checkup or a cleaning ? 
 What tooth is giving you pain ? 
 Let me see ... We can see you this afternoon if you can come in at four thirty . 
 Yeah , let's go Joe's Disco . 
 Okay , but you ask him . 
 Exactly how old a box do you want ? 
 We still have six left . 
 Dancing figures are quite popular . Two of the boxes have them . 
 Yes , I think you'll be very satisfied with that one . 
 No . But if something goes wrong with it , I know someone who repairs these things . 
 It's amazing that these things still work as well as they do . 
 What ’ s up ? 
 Sure , you can . 
 I sure did ! 
 I can ’ t disclose that information . 
 My vote is my own private business . 
 I voted for our next President . 
 I used to work as a mechanic and I was responsible for the maintenance of all the company vehicles . 
 I worked in Hanson Paper Company . 
 Because the company is far away from home , and I have to study after work so I can't afford to waste time on the road everyday . 
 I am not feeling all the great . I think I have that crud that is going around . 
 My boyfriend hasn ’ t been feeling so well . Maybe he passed it on to me . 
 Mostly , I feel like I need some rest and hot soup . 
 My grandmother thinks that honey and whiskey is a good cure for a cold . 
 If things don ’ t get better in a few days , I will look for some other solutions . 
 I can help you . How much money do you make per year ? 
 How long have you been on your current job ? 
 Do you have any other outside income from rental property or a trust ? 
 Do you know your credit score ? 
 By crunching the numbers and putting in your expenses , I estimate that you can afford a house of around five hundred thousand dollars . 
 All right , but tell me what ’ s happening . Give it to me straight please . 
 And now ? 
 That ’ s great news . 
 That ’ s good to hear . She is usually full of vein and vigor . 
 Thanks for helping her , doctor . 
 Thanks . I will . 
 That was quick work . Let me have a look at it . Yeah , everything looks fine now . Thank you very much . 
 How much do I owe you ? 
 Really ? You worked here for just half an hour . I consider the price very high . 
 What time did he come in last night ? 
 Who was he out with ? 
 Yes , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 I'll have that taken care of immediately . 
 No problem . We'll bring you the towels in just a minute . 
 I've been waiting here in the conference room for ten minutes already . What time does our meeting start ? Where is everyone anyway ? 
 What ? The meeting was proponed ? No one told me anything about it . 
 What memo ? There haven't been any memos this whole week . I check my unbox every day , and I haven't seen anything . 
 You know how things get piled up on my desk when I am busy — I know that sometimes I do misplace things , but I always read all the memos that go around . They go directly to my in-box . Are you sure it was sent to the whole office ? 
 I'm usually too busy to take a bunch of coffee breaks and gossip by the water cooler . Anyway , I am sure the memo never got to my in-box . I'll have to talk to our secretary about it . 
 Can you show me how to use chopsticks ? 
 Oh , it is not easy to learn ! 
 Well , I don't think I can manage with it . 
 That's good , thank you . 
 That ’ s great . 
 The rent each month is $ 1050 . 
 Did you have a better price in mind ? 
 That ’ s way too low . 
 How about $ 900 a month ? 
 Great . It was a pleasure doing business with you . 
 Yes , Madam , may I help you ? 
 Yes ? 
 Oh , yes . Madam , we'll come right away then . Your room number and your name , please ? 
 Thank you , would you hang up and wait ? 
 ok , what unusual food do you want to try ? 
 what's that ? 
 I don't know . I don't know what most of this food is ! 
 I'd like to have some vegetables first . 
 no , what is it ? 
 what do you use to eat it ? 
 that sounds great . Do you know if there are any vegetable dishes that are spicy ? 
 I'll try all of those . How do you know so much about International food ? 
 Would you like to see our new shirts ? 
 Well , they are very nice you know . 
 And not expensive either . 
 Everybody is buying them . 
 Yes , they are very fashionable , you see . 
 I see . 
 Sorry I couldn't help you . 
 Yes , Sally . I want to do some sit-ups and perhaps get in a game of singsong . 
 I'd love it.Working out is more fun with a friend . 
 Good.If you happen to see Jim and Bob on the way see if they would like a game of singsong . 
 Yes , they are the latest designs . Would you like to try them on ? 
 The oval shape one ? 
 I think it suits you well . 
 How about this ? They're the same shape . 
 Yes , very . They make the trip in about an hour . 
 No , I hope not . I want to have a deck chair and enjoy the crossing . 
 The sea seems quite calm , so there will be no fear of seasickness . Are you seasick ? 
 I'm not a very good sailor , either . My mother is a dreadfully poor sailor . In fact , she never takes a voyage unless she has to . I am better than that , and even on the Pacific . after ten days of it , I can still find my sea legs . Well , happily we shall have a smooth passage today . 
 Yeah , I am of the same opinion . 
 Could I have a look at those pens ? 
 Have you got anything a bit cheaper ? 
 No , they're not quite what I want . Sorry to trouble you . 
 Did you work in a charity organization ? 
 In what way did those social activities have impact on your mind ? 
 I need help figuring out how to use this phone . 
 Yes , I hear the tone . 
 Yes , it changed . 
 I am trying to call home . 
 Yes , I have a list of extensions . 
 Can I help you ? 
 I am sorry , sir . Your baggage is 2kg overweight.You have to pay extra money for it . 
 Sure . Now it's all right . Here is your boarding pass and label . Have a nice trip . 
 You say how high can be exciting ? 
 I know that Frenchmen installed the Bungee cord between two tall buildings . 
 Luckily there is no such kind of ' grown-up ceremony ' any more . 
 Please wait a moment ... here is the bill . Please check it . 
 For three bottles of Tsingtao beer . 
 Oh , I'm sorry . Let me go back to the cashier's to have it changed . ( a few minutes later , the waiter returns with the new bill . ) 
 That's all right . 
 How much is the fare ? 
 Could you tell me how to use it ? 
 Oh , I see . By the way , how can I get out of the platform after I get off the train ? 
 Thank you for your help . 
 We're supposed to check in at the air-china ’ s counter . Thirty minutes before take off , Joe . 
 Do we need to show our ID cards when checking in . 
 What about our luggage ? 
 Are they going to frisk all the passengers ? 
 You look kind of green . 
 Have you had anything to eat lately ? 
 Perhaps the food was bad . 
 Has anything been upsetting you lately ? 
 Do you think that maybe you are getting the flu ? 
 Hello ! nice to see you here at the finest centre again . What exercises are you going to do today ? 
 Good idea . I'd suggest you do some crunches too . Thery're great for getting in shape . Make sure you do them correctly . 
 Sure . Is today only you second visit ? 
 The treadmill is excellent for helping you to build up stamina . Each time you use it , increase this distance . don't worry about your speed at first . You can increase that later . 
 That's right . You don't want to injure yourself by exercising too much or in the wrong way . Now , this is how you make the settings for the treadmill ... 
 I know Mark is your only child . You may do it differently from what I did . Sometimes I would tap their hands when they made troubles . 
 And what does your husband do ? 
 But spoiling a child is not going to do him good either ! You ’ Ve got to have patience with him and teach him . It ’ s not easy , I know . It ’ s hard . 
 I really do like this dining set.But I just don't know . I don't know if I can do a good job with it . 
 What instructions ? 
 I see . But can I understand the instructions ? I'm a foreigner , you know . 
 Could you tell me now some of the things I need to do ? 
 Do I have to sand every inch of the table ? 
 Alright . 
 Sawdust ? 
 That makes sense . 
 And I can choose any color ? 
 And after the varnish ? 
 And then ? 
 It all sounds very complicated . 
 Well , I will look around your shop some more . I need to think about it . 
 Good afternoon , Miss Tao . Please sit down . 
 I ’ Ve read your application materials with interest . Now I want to ask you a few questions , if you don ’ t mind . 
 The first is why you choose our company ? 
 Why do you want to quit your present company ? 
 Well , when do you think you can come over to work ? 
 When you start to work , I ’ ll give you $ 3,000 a month . 
 Excuse me , what's the checking time for flight FA1187 ? 
 Yes , and I have already gone through the safety inspection . 
 Thank you . 
 You can take the subway to get there 
 It ’ s takes only about 10 minutes 
 You can take No . 1 bus or taxi 
 Pleas turn right at the traffic lights . 
 Do you like reading magazines ? 
 Why ? 
 No , you can learn a lot from them . 
 Absolutely . And it's a good way to kill time during the tour . 
 Yes , I do . 
 Sure . Here you are . 
 Yes , speaking . Can I help you ? 
 I am happy to hear that and I'll accept that . 
 No , I am single . 
 Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up . 
 Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded . 
 How long have you been in this company ? 
 You must have found much difference between working in company and studying in college . 
 Well , you ’ Ve adapted yourself very well . Everyone in our office thinks you ’ Ve made a great progress in the past two years . What is your secret ? 
 How will you ship the order ? 
 But the freight cost will be higher and that will affect the retail price . 
 I'm going to need some more info first . I was wondering about the repayments . How long would I have to pay back the loan ? 
 And how much is payable in each instalment ? 
 Well , as far as I can see , the advantages outweigh the disadvantages . You've sold me ! I'd like to go ahead . 
 I'd really like to help you out , but I am broke myself . 
 Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 OK ! How much do you want to deposit ? 
 Would you please fill in a deposit form first ? Please write down your name , your account number and the amount you want to put in . 
 Interest is paid at the rate of 1 % per annum at present . And it is added to your account every year . 
 My pleasure . 
 It is worth 100 yuan and your bill comes to 230 yuan . The difference is 130 , please . 
 Thank you , sir . Could you sign the voucher here , please ? 
 Thank you , sir . Hope to see you again soon . 
 It doesn't matter . 
 What did I do ? I haven't done anything . 
 What do you mean ? 
 I didn't do anything . 
 No , I didn't . I'm innocent . Those aren't mine . Whatever you found is someone else's stuff . You can't prove anything . I wasn't there when you went in , and you can't prove it's my stuff . 
 I don't need your help , jerk . 
 I think I'm going to go to the market today . 
 Yeah , I think so . 
 I'm not sure what we need . 
 Could you do it for me , and write out a list of things that we need ? 
 Like what ? 
 Just go and make a list for me , please . 
 Jenny , Can you come and help me ? 
 It's dusty everywhere in the house . Can you help me do the housecleaning ? 
 That's my good girl . The clothes need washing . I'll do the laundry . 
 Let me take a look . This is for a 486 computer with modem . Who ’ s it going to ? 
 Get her on the phone , please . I need to clarify this . 
 Rhaki.Do you want some ? 
 I will show you . 
 Less than 5 % . It's quite durable . 
 The kitchen god ? What does he do ? 
 Oh , no ! I did a lot of bad things this year . I hope the kitchen god isn't like Lester--he blabs my mistakes to everybody ! 
 What is it ? Tell me ! Will it work for Lester , too ? 
 Hmm . Are you sure that will work ? I already tried giving chocolate to Lester . 
 His face broke out and he said it was my fault ! 
 We could easily provide you with a private vehicle , if you'd prefer . 
 Perhaps you'd like to take a beautiful limousine . 
 No private vehicle , no limo . Got it . Where are you going ? 
 What time should the taxi be here to pick you up ? 
 I'll have a taxi for you momentarily , sir . 
 You'll enjoy our new , clean taxis , sir . 
 Yes , sir . Can I help you ? 
 Medium rare , that ’ s right , sir . I remember your order . 
 If it is not to your satisfaction , I ’ ll certainly bring you another . But I ’ m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes . 
 Judy , what do you think of the new general manager ? 
 I heard he's very clear about his likes and dislikes and he's not the type to just let things go , so don ’ t provoke him . 
 Me too , I don't know why , but every time I see the guy , I break into a cold sweat . 
 Whatever we said , we must be more careful . 
 I ’ m interested in all kinds of your products , but this time I would like to order some fireworks and mosquito coil incense . Please quote us C . I . F . Rangoon . 
 I ’ m going to place a trial order for 1,000 units of a dozen fireworks and 500 cartons of mosquito coil incense . 
 Your price is reasonable but I wonder if you would give us a discount . You know for the products like yours we usually get 2 % or 3 % discount from European suppliers . 
 Discounts will more or less encourage us to make every effort to push sales of your products . 
 As far as a trial order is concerned , the quantity is by no means small . And generally speaking , we like to profit from a trial order . I hope you ’ ll be able to meet our requirements . 
 1 % ? That ’ s too low a rate . Could you see your way to increase it to 2 % ? . 
 It seems this is the only proposal for me to accept . I ’ ll come again tomorrow to discuss it in detail . 
 Hello , can I help you ? 
 How long has it been on for ? 
 You can still drive , without problems . 
 Let's check it out . There'll be a $ 45 charge to check it over . If you fix it with us , we'll include the $ 45 into your repair . 
 Please write down your address and phone number , and sign here . 
 It'll be about an hour . Are you going to wait ? 
 No problem . 
 I went to school today . Did you go to school ? 
 That's horrible . I'd be happy to give you the assignments from English class . 
 Don't mention it . 
 That is greatly appreciated and I hope you feel well enough to go to school tomorrow . 
 Just tell me what you'd like , please . 
 I hate to tell you this , but we have no more filet mignon . May I suggest the porterhouse instead ? 
 Have you ever tried chocolate-covered strawberries with champagne ? 
 That'll be a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and porterhouse , all charged to your amenities account . 
 Please call if you have any other requests . Your food will be delivered promptly . 
 It's about two or there blocks away from here . 
 It'll take you about 15 minutes . 
 I want a new brand image . Something creative , something strong . Make no mistake , something with ... resolve ! 
 Let's meet on Friday to discuss your progress . Give me your e-mail address ... umm , I mean addresses ... We'll be in touch . 
 Yes , what do you have for appetizer ? 
 Well , please bring me the cold beef . 
 Are you voting tomorrow ? 
 You know that I am . 
 It ’ s at the park up the street . 
 Where ’ s your polling place ? 
 How come you don ’ t know where it is ? 
 You should check online . 
 Why aren ’ t they are aware of the gravity of the situation ? 
 Sir , I've finished your shaving . Wow , it takes years off you after having a shave . 
 Thank you . May I suggest you to trim your eyebrows ? 
 No , sir , I am serious . Haven't you heard that today men are becoming increasingly interested in having their eyebrows professionally groomed ? 
 Absolutely . Several men have tried it in my A shop . Do you want to try ? 
 Can I stay out all night with my friends ? 
 But we'll be careful . 
 I'm sleepy . I can hardly keep my eyes open . 
 I think I will . 
 Hi , my sweetheart . It ’ s Dad . 
 I ’ m at work right now . You can reach me at 905 675 9870 . Please call this number if you need me . 
 I love you . 
 She's a Persian . She has papers and everything . Not like a street dog . 
 And bugs . They can catch anything . 
 No , they use litter boxes or go outside by themselves.Thev ' re so smart . 
 It's better than picking up dog poop . 
 It's not my fault . 
 I wish I had studied here . It's more than a university . 
 Woo . It has such a long history . I think I should take more photos of the university . 
 Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ? 
 I agree with you there , but you price is unreasonable . 
 I don't think we will be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % . 
 Don't you agree with me that in the long run moderate prices we bring about large sales and more profit ? 
 Is that all ? 
 I'm sorry , we can't handle the price you offered . 
 It ’ s horrible . Why do drivers run a red light then ? 
 Talking on the cell phone while driving is very dangerous too . It increases the chance of accidents . 
 What are the requirements to apply for the position ? 
 Do you think my educational background suits this position ? 
 Does this job require that new employees take any kind of training course ? 
 Could you tell something about the job ? 
 Oh , I see . I believe I can do the job well . 
 Yes , there are . What cabin would you like ? 
 It is 150 dollars each . 
 The boat time-table is effective from the first of August till the first of November 
 The ship will stop at New York . 
 It will take 5 days . 
 Did you order the cake ? 
 Get on the phone right now . It might not be too late . 
 Yeah . How about “ Happy Birthday Tony , from the gang . ” 
 What would you like to eat ? 
 How about something to drink ? 
 OK . I'll see if I can get waited on . 
 thanks , I like it too . I bought it at the nearby department store . 
 yeah , I know that . But at those places . the prices they ask you are ridiculously high , and if you don't bargain hard , you will get ripped-off . 
 yeah , but personally , I hate bargaining . If I bargain , I might come to a lower price , but I will never know the true price of what I am buying ; and I always have the feeling that I am overcharged at th 
 that's why I like department stores more . Shopping at a wholesale market like the locals is one of the few things I am unable to grow accustomed to . 
 When will the campus recruitment of L'Oreal being this year ? 
 It is really early , isn't it ? 
 Dahua's Market . How can I help you ? 
 We are on Nanjing Road , next to the theatre . 
 Excuse me . Can you take me to the airport ? 
 Kennedy Airport . 
 Thank you , but I'd rather keep this case with me . 
 Well , a way to make a living , of course , but beyond that I think a job is a way of developing oneself as a person . 
 I wouldn't like to hold a specific title . I just want to enjoy what I am doing . 
 It's the most important thing to me . 
 I think a company is a place to get work done . Certainly friendly , open relationships among all company employees is important , and I think an employee should be serious about his or her work responsibilities and have a professional relationship with the boss . 
 Goodbye . 
 It's here at last ! 
 Twenty minutes exactly . 
 Can I help you ? 
 I ’ ll be glad to help . 
 All you have to do is to ask for help . 
 I ’ m ready and willing to help . 
 I like the colour very much . It's a lovely dress , but it's too small for me . 
 All right . I'm afraid this green dress is too small for me as well . It's smaller than the blue one . I don't like the colour either . It doesn't suit me at all . I think the blue dress is prettier . Co 
 Can I help you ? 
 Have you made a reservation ? 
 How long will you be staying ? 
 A single room costs you $ 85 / day . 
 Yes . 
 No , You can pay when you check out . 
 Today is Tuesday , 25th September , 2001 . 
 What time is your appointment ? 
 What time is now ? Do you have the correct time ? 
 You won't be late.It ' s still early . 
 Well , turn left at the first corner after the crossroad . It's near the corner . You can't miss it . 
 It's my pleasure ! 
 Sure , anything else ? 
 OK . Here you are . 
 I haven't gotten started on my room yet . 
 I have every intention of cleaning my room later . 
 I already told you that I'm going to do it . 
 I'll remember to do that . 
 I'll clean my room before I leave . 
 Why not ? If I were you , I certainly would . 
 As the saying goes , work while you work , play while play . All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy , you know ? 
 Good morning , Sir . Are you here to get some advice about our new Personal Financing Program ? 
 The account is a compound savings account , which is in RIB and Forex . 
 Yes , you can have a Money Link card . You can also base the account on time deposits . The choice is yours . 
 The interest on this new account is higher than any of the accounts in our Personal Financing .

 Ladies and Gentlemen , this is the Statue of Liberty . It's one of the American symbol . 
 The statue has for a century acted as a figurehead for the American Dream . 
 Of course you can . 
 I'd like to book a ticket to Singapore , please . 
 June 3rd . 
 Okay . I will book this flight . 
 Here you are . 
 Don ’ t worry , you can pay in an installment , that is to say , you don ’ t have to pay the whole amount of money at once . 
 Certainly , you need to pay a deposit at first , and you will pay the rest monthly . 
 It depends . 
 Certainly . 
 Sure , what's wrong ? 
 It's easy . Press O and then P . Then it will ask you for your password . 
 Just press ENTER and you've done . 
 We can borrow from a bank , the gross interest rate will be something like 7 % . With corporate tax at say 30 % . We are only paying on 50 % of this . There is still inflation to consider . 
 We can borrow as much as we can . 
 How much loan capital can we safely raise then ? 
 So you're going picnicking ? 
 Have a good day ! 
 I went to the doctor yesterday . 
 I said I had been to the doctor the day before . 
 He said I ' d got the flu . 
 He told me to stay in bed for ten days . 
 Yes , ten days . 
 I'm thinking about that idea we talked about . 
 I'm not sure . 
 Yes , can you tell me how to use the phone in my room ? 
 Thank you . 
 I'll give you mine too . 
 Not bad , but I'm a little tired . 
 Could you arrange a meeting with your boss ? 
 Well , shall we get down to business ' . 
 Yes , we finished the evaluation of it . If the price is acceptable we would like to order now . 
 What's your best price for that item ? 
 I think the price is a little high , can't you reduce it 
 Well , I'll accept the price and place an initial order of 10,000 units . 
 The pleasure is ours . Can you deliver the goods by March 31 ? 
 Excuse me , can you tell me where the post office is ? 
 I'm afraid I don't quite understand . 
 What's the quickest way to get there ? 
 Can you tell me where the taxi stand is ? 
 Thank you . 
 Excuse me , can you help me ? I would like to change rooms if possible , I couldn ’ t sleep at all last night , because the people in the room next to mine were making a lot of noise , also if at all possible , I ’ d like a room that doesn ’ t overlook the street , between the noisy neighbors and the highway outside , I didn ’ t sleep a wink . 
 I ’ m on the 6th floor , room 698 , I ’ v had many problems with that room , just this morning , I called someone up to fix the light fixture in the bathroom , it didn ’ t work , and it still doesn ’ t work . 
 Ok , that would be very nice ! What do I need to do to transfer ? 
 Mmm , I don ’ t think the charges are right , can you explain them please ? 
 Yes , that ’ s right . After graduating from high school in New York I attended York University in the UK . My major was English , and my minor was business studies . I completed my BA in 2004 . 
 Yes that ’ s right . I ’ Ve always enjoyed studying . My friends say I ’ m a bit of a bookworm , but my father always pushed us to succeed school . 
 Well I ’ Ve always been keen on writing , so I became the editor for the University student newspaper , which I really loved . Also I volunteered for a group called Shelter , to help the homeless in York . 
 Providing warm meals and shelter , especially in the winter months . I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group . 
 Yes , okay . 
 Here ’ s my VISA card . 
 What ’ s the problem ? 
 It was ? 
 That ’ s my only one . 
 No cash today . 
 I ’ ll come tomorrow with cash . 
 How do you spell that ? 
 Right . Got that . 
 You will have to take your driving test . Have you taken it yet ? 
 Could you fill these papers out , please ? 
 You need an appointment . 
 Is Friday good for you ? 
 Okay , so Friday at what time ? 
 All right . Come in on Friday at 11 
 We just moved in yesterday , actually . 
 It's great ! Unfortunately , we're going to spend a fortune doing everything up . 
 It's about 200 years old . It has a lot of history ! 
 It's just off of the ring road . 
 It's bigger than our last one . I've got flowers in the front , and fruits , vegetables and a fish pond in the back . 
 Oh , yes . Our windows let plenty of natural light in . They've also got wonderful views of the park behind our house . 
 Right now , there are three bedrooms , two barrooms , a kitchen , a sitting room , a dining room , and a living room . We're hoping to add on a green room and a guest bedroom . In fact , when the guest bedroom is ready , you should come and stay with us for a weekend . 
 Mary , we're going to the supermarket . Do you want to come ? 
 Let's all go together then . 
 She's getting coupons from her desk . 
 They give you discounts on some stuff that you want to buy . 
 Because there is a coupon for almost every product , we always bring coupons on our shopping trips . 
 Well , I felt like baking , so I made some muffins . 
 Sure , I'll take mine , sunny side up . 
 You know , my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for twenty years . It drove my mom crazy ! 
 You ’ re so picky sometimes . 
 Dammit ! I asked for sunny side up ! How many times do I have to tell you . 
 Than you , I'm not late , am I ? 
 Well , thank you , but it's not all that hard to do , you know . I've been calling your office and sending you proposals for about two years now , and you've never responded before . 
 Please , I wish you would . 
 Yes , I know that . It's why Ive been trying to become one of those suppliers . I hear you're a good man to do business with . 
 That's pretty much what I heard . 
 No problem at all , Mike . Just give me the chance . 
 Oh , hi Kim . How ’ s it going ? 
 Ok , sure . When did you have in mind ? 
 Why don ’ t ’ we say the 3rd around 2:00 p . m . ? 
 Great . Talk to you then . 
 Oh no , I won't . But we will have an accident if you don't stop shouting . 
 Oh , shut up , will you ? It was all your fault . If you'd kept quite this would never have happened . 
 If you're observant you'll see rare birds , insects , butterflies , and a few reptiles . But you must look for them . There are also a few am-phibians in lower places . 
 Huh ! I am really out-of-shape , Why aren't you out-of-breath ? 
 How can you say that ? But , you could give me a piggyback the rest of the way . 
 Hi , Steven , take a seat ! How are things at work ? 
 Can you finish it on time ? 
 OK , I will send Beker to help you . We need to get the brochures done and sent them to our clients on Friday without delay . 
 OK , I just want to brief you all on the travel market in Taiwan . To start with , generally speaking , the travel industry in Taiwan focuses mainly on tours . This segment of the industry is well developed . 
 Yes , of course . Most of the time , when they travel , they prefer to do so in large groups accompanied by a guide , who usually takes care of everything , for instance , choosing the restaurants , the itinerary , the mode of transport , and things like that . Another thing is that most travelers to the UK tend to be middle aged , around 40 to 50 or so . This age group is less adventurous ; they like good hotels , and have money to spend . They kind of prefer to stay in the cities where they feel safer . They are not into mountain climbing in Wales or anything . 
 Just a moment . I'll tell you about that in a minute . Where was I ? Oh yes . By way of illustration , let ’ s look at the top five destinations in the UK for this kind of traveler over the last five years . If you look at page ten you can see what I mean . In spite of these characteristics of the market , I still think there is room for growth in the youth sector . 
 OK , let me tell you what we ’ Ve been doing . We ’ Ve been in touch with the Wales and Scottish Tourist development offices here in Taiwan and they ’ re interested in working with us to promote their regions to the youth segment . We ’ Ve decided to implement an advertising campaign focusing on the excitement of the activities in those regions . 
 Go ahead . 
 Well , at the moment we are trying to work out those details . We haven't managed to come up with a concrete plan yet , but we are working on it . 
 Well , our intention is to have some features about these regions in some youth magazines . We ’ re also going to run some ads on TV and put some flyers in places where young people go , like the gym and student organizations . We ’ re making arrangements to have some activities at big shopping malls and department stores around town . 
 Yes . Today is Tuesday , so the boss went off to his MBA seminar class . He is out of the office every Tuesday and Thursday mornings , and he has classes all day Saturday and Sunday . 
 He is finishing up a special continue education program for executives . He can continue working , taking a few of classes here and there , and in 2 years he will complete his MBA . 
 The classes have him out of the office , so that is stressful for him . But as far as homework goes , it is a breeze for him . 
 He just has his secretary do his homework for him . 
 Yes . I ’ d like to book a duplex suite . 
 Next Friday . 
 Oh , thank you very much . 
 How do I contact them ? 
 Hello , I would like to speak with Ryan . 
 Ryan , this is Malia , and I am afraid that I am feeling a bit under the weather . 
 I have a horrible rash from poison oak . 
 The doctor said that I probably have had it a few days . 
 I bought some over-the-counter lotion , and I am taking an antihistamine . 
 Mmmm ... This apartment seems a little expensive . Do you have any cheap studios ? 
 Do you think any studios will open up soon ? 
 Can I help you with something ? 
 Is there a problem with it ? 
 What would you like to do with all the money in this account ? 
 I can do that . 
 Do you want to take any money out ? 
 It ’ s going to take a moment for me to cancel your account . 
 Hi , Nancy . How are you doing ? 
 Not right now . I've got to get another car and my old one is blown up . 
 You mean used cars ? 
 Well , yeah , but I'd be getting somebody else's problems . 
 It's the same kind of deal though , you know , you never know what you're going to get . 
 Let's look at them all . Have you got a paper there ? 
 I have got a run . Can you tell me where is the restroom ? 
 No , thank you . I have brought some . 
 Like who ? 
 I've got it under control . 
 What if you had three more top-notch programmers to help you ? 
 Good morning , how have you been doing ? 
 Have you had any type of bug lately ? 
 Has anyone ever told you that you have allergies ? 
 Does this happen more when you are under stress ? 
 I am going to refer you to a pulmonary specialist who can run tests on you for asthma . 
 Let's go to Wangfujing by bus . 
 OK , it will be a new experience for me . 
 Where do we pay the fare ? 
 Let me pay for it . Where can I get a subway map ? 
 Do I have to pay an additional fare to change trains ? 
 What should I do if I notice a fire ? 
 Should I try to put the fire out ? 
 Do you know the restrictions about the carry-on items for exiting ? 
 What are the things that are forbidden to take in departure ? 
 Hey , how are you doing ? 
 Sure , whatever you need . 
 How are you , Sue ? 
 Congratulations on your success . 
 And how ’ s your brother ? 
 He ’ s going to be sent to Britain to study , really ? 
 Fantastic ! Please send him my congratulations . 
 Excuse me , can I have your passport , your immigration form and your Customs Declaration Form , please ? 
 How long will you be staying at Hotel in China ? 
 And what's the purpose of your visit ? 
 And where will you be staying ? 
 OK . Could you put your hand baggage on the counter , please ? Do you have any gifts , or food in here ? 
 I'm sorry , sir , you can't bring fresh fruit into China . I'm going to have to confiscate these . 
 Well , Yuri , tell me about it . 
 That's what I was afraid of . 
 Mud ? But Ivan told me there were no mudslides in that district . I thought all the mudslides were down in Chichitango . 
 Oh , that's terrible ! What bad luck ! I wish we had never come to this country.But , if it isn't the strikes and the revolutionaries , it's the earthquakes.Our operations here are finished ! 
 It's not your fault , Yuri.But tell me . When will Ivan be able to get out there ? 
 Good . I want an estimate of damages as soon as possible . 
 Yes , Yuri ? 
 Has the earthquake damaged the bridges too ? 
 Are you serious ? Fighting ? But I didn't hear anything on the news . 
 Oh , this is terrible , Yuri . Terrible ! So we can't even assess the damages . How can we do business in this country ? Either we're buried under mud , or we're in danger of getting kidnapped.No , I can't believe this mess ! 
 You don't have to keep saying that , Yuri . It's not your fault.But me--I'm the one who should be sorry.It was me who suggested operations here in the first place ! Oh , what can we do ? 
 Chicken , please . 
 Thank you . Oh , can I have another drink ? 
 Your dog is really cute . What's his name ? 
 What kind of dog is he ? 
 Well , he sure likes to run around a lot . Is he well behaved ? 
 That sounds like my cat . She likes to scratch the couch with her claws . 
 About a year ago actually . You've probably never seen her though . 
 She's not a house-cat . She stays outside most of the time . 
 You are seemingly upset . What's behind you ? 
 That's not as complicated as you suppose . 
 It is known that there is a time limit for trademarks . And we should not have a similar trademark with the one in the same field . 
 Correct . And our country follows the priority of use principle . 
 Some relative documents will be needed and the fee may be quite dear . So you need to learn more about the process and regulations about this issue . 
 Yes , I need this prescription please . 
 Capsules are fine . 
 Yes , I know . It ’ s not the first time I ’ m taking this ! Don ’ t worry , I won ’ t overdose ! 
 Oh , yes , I almost forgot ! Can I also get some eye drops and um , some condoms ? 
 Oh , well that ’ s okay , I ’ ll get some later , thanks ... Really it ’ s no problem . 
 Good coming , sir . 
 Would you mind moving to the middle of the bus ? 
 Where are you going ? 
 Don't worry . I'll let you know when we get there . 
 I will be accompanying you on your tour today to visit our company . This is the assembly line . These drawings on the wall are process sheets . They describe clearly how each process goes on to the next step . 
 About 200 . They can assemble at least 3,000 computers every day . 
 Yes , since I came to this company , I was told that high efficiency is essential for the further development . 
 Well , all products have to go through five checks in the whole process . We believe that the quality is the soul of an enterprise . There fore , we always put quality as the first consideration . 
 Mr . Chandler , this way please . I will show you a five-minute multivision about the history of our company . 
 Let me see . Your name , please ? 
 Sorry . What was that you said ? 
 Where ? 
 When , did you say ? 
 Who's coming ? 
 Sorry . I didn't quite catch what you said . There's a lot of noise outside . 
 Loretta ? No , she can't come , she's busy . 
 What are you collecting donations for ? 
 How much are you planning on raising ? 
 What kind of fundraisers are you doing ? 
 You should try actual fundraisers , too . 
 Try having a car wash or selling candy . 
 I know . It ’ ll also help you make more money . 
 OK ... just grab it right out of my hands ... 
 That piece fits on to your ear . It hooks right on . And you just put the other one in your other ear . 
 May I serve your dishes now ? 
 With sugar ? 
 Excuse me . I bought this just now and here's a receipt . I'm afraid I was short-changed . Could you look into it ? 
 Excuse me.My bag was stolen.Will you help me ? 
 Just about half an hour ago . 
 Yes.It was just when I was walking in the park . I saw some children with a newspaper . 
 I want to get in touch with the Chinese Embassy , because my passport was in the stolen bag ! 
 Yes , we do . The most popular vegetables are potatoes , carrots , peas , and cauliflower . The most popular fruit are apples , bananas , pears , peaches , grapes , and oranges . Do you like vegetables ? 
 Which kinds of vegetables do people in your country usually eat ? 
 I love eggplant ! Unfortunately , it ’ s quite expensive in my country , so I don ’ t eat it often . 
 Because we don ’ t grow it much in my country . We import a lot from other countries . 
 We eat it in my country too , but I wouldn't say it ’ s very popular . Most people buy frozen sweet corn from their local supermarket . 
 A lot of younger people like to buy large packets of mixed frozen vegetables . Peas and sweet corn have been sold frozen in my country for many years . I prefer to buy fresh vegetables . 
 Could we have the bill , please ? 
 That's alright . Here you are . 
 We want someone who can operate the common office equipments and have special skills in photography . 
 What do you think of your own qualification ? 
 Mark ? What were you up to yesterday ? I called you , but there wasn ’ t anybody home . 
 How ’ d it go ? Did we win ? 
 Do you mind if I ask you a question ? If it ’ s too personal you can forget it . 
 Have you got a scholarship , or are you on your own ? 
 I have a tuition scholarship from the university . Otherwise I ’ m on my own . 
 Oh no . My family supports me . And believe me , changing foreign money into dollars is heart-breaking . You seem to get so little in return . 
 I am so busy today . 
 I ’ m not sure . Perhaps you could do the shopping . 
 Or maybe make the beds . 
 Thanks . That ’ s terrific ! 
 Excuse me , where are the canned goods ? 
 Thank you.And where can I buy some delicatessen ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Good morning , Ms . Walker . What can I do for you ? 
 Of course , Ms . Walker . Could I have your account number , please ? And , when do these documents need to arrive ? 
 Yes , I ’ Ve come in apply for the position as head of claim department . 
 My name is Zhang Due . 
 I graduated from Beijing College of Foreign Trade . My major was International Trade . 
 Yes , I have been working in Lush Insurance Company for four years . 
 Yes . 
 Yes . 
 I've been looking forward to visiting your factory . 
 That'll be most helpful . 
 How much do you spend on design development every year . 
 That's fine . 
 No , Nancy , today I'm here to make a withdrawal . I made a formal request 7 days ago . 
 That's correct . But before I do , I was wondering if you could give me some advice . 
 Maybe I'm making a big mistake cashing in my Time Deposit before maturity . 
 No , not really . My Current Account is for cash flow and couldn't withstand having all of that money taken from it . 
 Yes , I think I speak English quite fluently . I've often explained historical places in Xi'an to foreign tourists in English . They say my English is quite good . 
 Oh , more than ten years . I started learning English when I was still in a primary school from a foreign teacher . 
 Certainly . 
 Thank you . Nice to meet you too . I'm John . Is this your first time to take a long-distance trip on plane ? 
 Oh , I am sorry to hear that . Take it easy . It will be OK soon . You see , I take this long-hour plane frequently , but the jet lag still makes me uneasy . 
 Yes , whenever I think about China , I'd see the Tian'an Men Square . China is a very beautiful country . And I've seen many landmarks in China but I like the Great Wall most . 
 Was it built before the In dynasty ? I thought it was in the Ming dynasty . 
 Oh , yeah . Thought I am an American , I know quite a lot about China and I like Chinese tea very well . 
 Yeah , many of my friends like Chinese tea and whenever I go back to China , I'll take some Dragon-well green tea for them . 
 I heard about it , but I don't have any clothes made from silk . 
 Oh , I'm eager to have a try . 
 I ’ d like a half a pound of ground beef , please . 
 Could I also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ? 
 No , that won ’ t do . I ’ ll take this smoked ham you have here . 
 Is this salami and bologna you have here ? 
 Sounds good . Okay , that ’ s it . 
 Mmm ... No that ’ s okay , really . I think that ’ s all for today . 
 I ’ m reporting from Channel 5 News . 
 I want to ask you a couple questions . 
 Have you voted yet ? 
 Who was your vote for President ? 
 Why can ’ t you tell me ? 
 I see . 
 Billy , you don ’ t look too well . Maybe you should take the day off school . 
 You ’ Ve god a fever and playing football isn ’ t a good idea for a boy with a fever . What ’ s that on your arm ? 
 It ’ s a rash . I ’ d better take you to see the doctor . How did you get that bruise on your leg ? 
 Does it hurt ? 
 Here . Put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down . I ’ ll take you to the doctor ’ s after breakfast . 
 If you are better , but I doubt you will be . 
 We need to work is because we need money to live . We need money for food and clothes and to pay for our house . We need money for many different things , and only when we work , we can earn money . And work can also help us feel that we are useful . 
 Yes , it is really hard . But you must believe that you will find a suitable job finally . When you work , you can accumulate a lot of experience . Besides , you need to learn a lot of things while you are working . 
 But whether you like it or not , there ’ s a trend of life-long study to make sure that we can keep ourselves up with the high developing society . And you need to accept this concept positively . 
 You have no choice , so you'd better adjust your thoughts to be ready to learn anything at any time . 
 It's my pleasure , what can I do for you ? 
 What brings you here ? 
 Where are you staying ? 
 Oh , it's not very far . And as far as I know it is a fancy place . 
 We sell them , right here . 
 I called about that ad we saw in the paper . 
 That's the one . 
 You were right . It was from a headhunter . She wouldn't tell me anything without a contract . 
 No ! Not at all . But , I did find out they have more than one position with different clients , so at least one would probably work . 
 I'm going there tomorrow . 
 Did you get a chance to speak with the sellers about my counter-offer ? 
 Did they accept the counter-offer ? 
 How much will that cost ? 
 Can I choose the home inspector ? 
 So , when are you going to inform the owners of my acceptance ? 
 This is our rock - bottom price , Mr . Li . We can't make any further concessions . 
 What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great . 
 What is your proposal ? 
 Do you mean to suggest that we have to make a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible . 
 The best we can do will be a reduction of another 30 dollars . That'll definitely be rock bottom . 
 You certainly have a way of talking me into it . All right , let's meet half way again . 
 Yes , there's one other point I wish to clear up . 
 My friends in business circles all seem to be of the opinion that the U . S . import and export corporations have become more flexible in doing business recently . 
 I'm glad to hear that . With a view to expanding and further enhancing the bilateral relations between our two parties , and in particular , exchanging timely views on specific problems in the execution and enforcement of contracts , is it possible for us to have a representative that could stay permanently in Washing - ton D . C . ? 
 Yes , of course . I'll call my home office tonight and let them know about it . When do we meet again ? 
 Good . I'll come back tomorrow , and we can then discuss it more specifically . 
 Yes . I would like to book a table for 2 at 7:30 tomorrow evening . 
 In that case , please put my name in your waiting list . We know you are quite a good restaurant . 
 Mr . Smith just called me back . 
 We got the contract ! 
 What's wrong with you ? 
 I really recommend you go for a run in the morning . 
 On the contrary ! It really refreshes you and gets you ready to attack the day . 
 Yes , I often feel like a million dollars after work , like I can take on anything . 
 Welcome ! 
 With ice , sir ? 
 Anything else , sir ? 
 Fruit juice , milk or mineral water ? 
 Coming up immediately . 
 Is this Ann ? 
 Ann , this is Sam . Look , Ann . I wanna see you again . How about a drink tonight ? 
 What about tomorrow evening ? 
 But Ann .. 
 In total , it should be about $ 5,000 for the week conference . Would you like to see the breakdown ? 
 First we have the airline tickets , which are $ 500 per person ; with four of us going , that's t $ 2,000 . For our accommodations , we're spending $ 80 a night , per room , for five days . That's another $ 800 . 
 I have two people to a room . The $ 80 room rate is the lowest I could find . With the conference going on that week , all the hotels have inflated their prices , they're making a killing . 
 I have budget $ 25 per Peron per day for food expenses . That totals another $ 800 . And for other incidentals , like take fees , and tips , I have estimated about $ 400 . 
 That's my buffer ... I wanted to leave a little room in the budget , just in case---it's better to be safe than sorry . 
 I ’ m very sorry . 
 Yes , my name is Peter . I have made a reservation for a single room from June 18th to June 21st . I'd like to make some changes . The reservation should only be to June 20th . 
 Yes . 
 That's exactly what I want . How much does it charge ? 
 It sounds good . I'll take that . 
 Hello ! 
 Sure , just a second . Who's calling ? 
 Ok , sue , I will just go in get her . 
 That's true . During rush hours , taxis are just as quick as buses . 
 At least , it can free you from the crowd . By the way , do you come from China ? 
 Wow , like America . It receives a great number of visitors every year . 
 I have never done this before and don ’ t know where to begin as far as making an offer on this house . 
 I absolutely must have this house and will pay three hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more . 
 I hope that the owners aren ’ t insulted by that offer . 
 Does it usually take very long for the owners to get back to you with an acceptance ? 
 Should I be in touch with my bank to tell them to get the loan papers ready ? 
 Is there a swimming pool in this hotel ? 
 What exactly does that mean ? 
 That sounds really neat . Is there an extra charge for these swim stations ? 
 Are the swim stations open 24 hours , like the rest of the gym ? 
 I'll go down there as soon as I can ! 
 So that will be one teddy , two terry cloth robes , three pairs of satin slippers , and two pairs of pajamas . 
 Let me see ... yes , 15,880 NT . After the discount , your total comes to 12,704 NT . Here's your free teddy bear , free panties and your card application . 
 Right here . And write your address . You'll get the card in the mail within a week . 
 I know your friend will like the gift set , especially the teddy bear . 
 Remember to keep your receipt in case your friend needs to make any exchanges . There are no refunds on sale items . 
 Yes . My name ’ s Mark Benson . I just started a couple of weeks ago . 
 Thanks , I appreciate that ! 
 It's good to be home . 
 It's a job I have been dreaming of for many years . While it is difficult , I am convinced that there is nothing more noble and rewarding than this profession . 
 Yes , a little . I know your school is one of the best known in this town . There are about 200 children in the school . 
 It took them four minutes to get here . That was pretty fast . 
 I guess the fire wasn't in the tool shed after all.It looks like the back of the house was burning . 
 Not really . 
 I think they went to Mexico , but I'm not sure.It ' s a bad thing to return home to.They ' ll come home from their trip , and they'll see half their house burned . 
 Yes , I suppose . It's a dangerous thing if a fire starts when people are sleeping . 
 I'd like to buy a skirt . 
 I like one with flowers on its brim . 
 It seems too short . 
 It looks nice . How much is it ? 
 Is there any cheaper one ? 
 I think I'd better take that one you showed me just now . It is better than this one although this one is cheaper . 
 Here is the money . 
 No , thanks . 
 Yes , I did , Ms . Chen . 
 I'm positive , Ms . Chen . 
 Oh , thank you . What is the occasion ? 
 Oh , yes , I'd very much like to go . 
 I'll be there in time . 
 Bye . 
 Is Mr Li in ? 
 Ok . 
 I bought it online . 
 yes . I buy most of my daily necessities online . 
 yes , much better . You can log in a website , browse through many items and categories comfortably at home , order the goods , pay by credit or debit card , and the goods will be delivered to your home . 
 and you can still go " window shopping " just like in a real shopping mall . 
 yes , most of the shops are closed at 22 or even earlier , but the internet operates 24 hours a day , seven days a week , and can be accessed anywhere . 
 sure . You can buy almost anything you can think of . 
 I'll have a whole-wheat loaf , three white loaves , a baguette and ten rolls , please . How much is that ? 
 There you go . 
 I feel dizzy and I have a headache . 
 Since yesterday . 
 I'm glad you appreciate our folk music . But a live performance is much more interesting . 
 The show starts at 7 and is over at around 10 o'clock p . m . 
 I'm glad you enjoyed it . It's had long run , but the house has always been full . 
 Personally I liked the main character . He was true to type . 
 Are you OK ? 
 So I can say now that you must have enjoyed the opera . Which scene is your favorite ? 
 What's it about ? You know , I couldn't help falling asleep . 
 I guess I've done the same thing last time I was here with her , too . I mean falling asleep . For me , this one is not that attractive . 
 Yes . I like Carmen very much . But I don't mind if you want to tell me about this one . 
 Very impressive . And I do like the leading actress who has an amazing voice . 
 Yes , the applause ! That was what kept waking me up during the show . 
 No doubt , it's not a simple thing to put on a ' phantom show ' . 
 I need a taxi to the airport . 
 Traffic rules are different among countries . 
 People drive on the right in China . 
 Excuse me , would you tell me who that girl is ? 
 Would you love to introduce me to her ? 
 What can I do for you , sir ? 
 Fruit juice , cakes and refreshments , and everything . 
 Any cereal , sir ? 
 And eggs ? 
 How do you want your eggs ? 
 Anything more , sir ? 
 Excuse me , are you Mr Williams from America ? 
 I'm Li Ming from CITS . Glad to see you . 
 Good afternoon , doctor . 
 I'm an athlete for the Olympic Games here . 
 Let me have a look . You're very lucky because the cut is not deep . 
 Must I stop all my training ? Will I be able to attend the games ? 
 Don't do strenuous exercises until your wound is healed . 
 Not at all . You'll be OK soon . 
 Hi Chris . I am glad to see you . Can you help me with my new computer ? 
 I bought it yesterday afternoon and they delivered it this morning at 10:45 . 
 I am not sure . I just can't connect to the net . 
 Of course , come in . 
 It was only 345 pounds . 
 I am on my way to the doctor now , but I should be back in about 45 minutes . Can I come back at around 3:15 ? 
 I'm planning on going to the market soon . 
 I don't know what we need . 
 I'll make a list . 
 OK ! Do we need any meat ? 
 What else do we need ? 
 Is there anything else that we need ? 
 Are you being served , sir ? 
 Will you sit here , please ? How would you like it cut ? 
 But it's short already , sir . 
 Shall I just trim it ? 
 Oh , I see . You like the Chinese style , don't you ? 
 Would you like to have a shampoo , sir ? 
 How about oil or spray ? 
 There ! How is that ? 
 Hello . Do you like this jewelry ? I made most of these items myself . 
 My mother taught me some tricks of the trade . I've always loved jewelry . 
 I've been making these designs for over ten years . You can have a bracelet for ten dollars . 
 It's a deal ! 
 Yes ? 
 Why not ? 
 I'm sorry . I can't . What does the note say ? 
 Sorry , I'm very near sighted . 
 For the bank manager ? 
 What happened ? 
 Well , no surprise there . 
 Great , so are you going to sign a contract with them ? 
 Great ! Good luck . 
 Good idea . The more people you ask , the better your chances are . 
 There's an Ethernet cable in your room . Just plug it into the back of your laptop . 
 That's okay . I can tell you about some alternatives we have . 
 Well , there's our computer lab on the first floor . 
 The lab and the computers are no charge , but you have to pay for whatever you print . 
 Of course . Our lobby is set up for wireless , so just bring your computer down here . 
 They plan to install a printer here . But until then , you'll have to use the lab . 
 What are you going to look for ? 
 What store are you going to ? 
 You don't know ? 
 Would you like me to tell you where I got mine . 
 I went to get mine from IKEA . 
 They're not cheap , but neither is their furniture . 
 Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer , and you'll be online in a heartbeat . 
 No problem . I'll tell you about our alternatives . 
 Our state-of-the-art computer lab is on the first floor . 
 Sir , the computers are free to guests , but you do have to pay a nominal printing fee . 
 Just use your computer here in the lobby . It's set up for wireless . 
 We might have a printer here next month . But for now , you'll have to go to the lab . 
 I hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field . Since my major was international banking , I really hope to work at a bank . 
 Because your bank is a new one , I think I'll be given more opportunities , and the working conditions and surroundings are so excellent here . 
 I expect to work hard , madam . 
 No , I enjoy travelling . 
 Why ? 
 Oh , that ’ s very sad . 
 What did you do ? 
 That ’ s a good idea . The counselor is a psychologist . He ’ s better trained to handle these sorts of things . 
 Yeah , me too . 
 But mum , I didn't mess it up . 
 Sorry , mum . I won't do it again . 
 Thank you for purchasing your new mattress with us . 
 Would you like us to deliver the mattress for you ? 
 When do you want it delivered ? 
 What time exactly ? 
 We can have it to you at that time . 
 We will deliver your mattress tomorrow at 12 o'clock . 
 Your silk garments have aroused much interest in our country ever since our first order was put on the market . We have no doubt we can do better this year if you appoint us your sales agent . 
 That's true . However at the Fair last March , people were so interested in Chinese garments that the demand this year will surely increase . 
 I'm sure it will , if we are appointed your agent . Your garments are attractive , and we , a well-established importer with multiple sales channels , can boost the sales . 
 Hey , don ’ t walk on the lawn . 
 You lost your wallet ? Anything important in it ? 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry to hear that . I think you ’ d better talk to the police officer walking there . 
 You are welcome . 
 the professor is a bit boring today . You need something to perk yourself up . How about a coffee ? 
 well , you need something to wake you up . How about a soda ? 
 the diet sodas don't have any caffeic in them , which one would you like ? 
 unfortunately , it doesn't . how about some diet coke ? 
 maybe you should try a cappuccino or a latte ; they taste much better than plain brewed coffee . 
 you'll love that . It's just a shot of espresso beans mixed with steam milk and some chocolate syrup . 
 thanks , but I'll stick with some jasmine tea . I'm trying to watch my diet . 
 That ’ s a good idea . I haven ’ t been in a while and I need to get a new backpack . The old one is hanging on by a thread ! 
 Shall we share a taxi ? 
 I want to go back to my college on the Huanghe road . It is very close to your house . 
 That's the one . 
 Yeah . If we share the cab , it'll be cheaper . Besides that your Chinese is better than mine . The drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though I practice my pronunciation carefully . 
 Did you go to the basketball game on Friday ? 
 You missed a really good game . 
 Our school did . They played really well . 
 Yeah , you should have . It was really exciting . 
 The score was 101-98 . 
 That's what made it so great . 
 Hello , BCD Company , can I help you ? 
 This is Mrs Smith , may I have your name ? 
 Hello , Mr . Sun . 
 You are welcome , Mr . Sun . 
 You certainly made a good impression on me , as well . 
 We'll be making the decision by the end of this week and we'll contact you as soon as possible . 
 You are welcome . 
 May I see your receipt ? 
 I am sorry , sir . You bought it 2 weeks ago , and you can only refund it in one week . 
 I'll do it later , Dad . I must prepare the concert on Saturday . 
 We hope so . 
 Oh dad . You don't understand at all . 
 I don't need it to play the guitar . 
 I'm sorry . 
 Good morning , doctor . I feel terrible . I ’ Ve god a cold and I have a rash here on my neck . I ’ m not sleeping well either . What do you think the problem could be ? 
 Yes , I bought some medicine at the chemist ’ s . I ’ Ve been taking it for three days . 
 OK . I can afford to take a few days off work . 
 Yes , I have . I had to get a project finished . It ’ s done now , so I can relax a little . 
 I have a bad headache , but ... 
 Thanks doctor . I ’ ll get these immediately . Goodbye . 
 What's the problem with your internet ? 
 How long has this been happening ? 
 The internet doesn't come up at all ? 
 There's obviously a problem with your connection . 
 I can send somebody right now to fix it . 
 They'll be there in about an hour . 
 There's still a lot left-have some more ! 
 What are my choices for lunch ? 
 Fish with noodles , please . 
 Coffee , please . 
 Yes , you can draw your tax back at any customs in the EU . 
 No problem , sir . 
 Would you show me your ID , sir , please ? 
 Thank you very much . Now , sir , do you have a credit card ? 
 Regrettably , Mr . Sandals , we accept only MasterCard or VISA . 
 Thanks . You're in room 507 , a big , nonsmoking room , with a queen bed . Is that okay , sir ? 
 I'm happy to hear that . Here is your key . Just dial 0 if you need anything . 
 Okay . Do you have a particular size in mind ? 
 Look at this one . It's our biggest pan . 
 Okay , we have the same thing in aluminum . 
 Try this one . Same aluminum pan , but with a heat-resistant bamboo handle . 
 That's a good choice . How do you want to pay for it ? 
 I'm so sorry . A lid comes with the pan . Here it is . 
 Could I reserve a table for Saturday , September 16th at 8: 00 p . m . ? 
 For two people . We would like a quiet table , please . 
 This is Mr . William . 
 William . W-I-L-L-I-A-M . 
 Hello , Frank . 
 Not too much . I'm looking to rent an apartment . 
 I dislike my roommate . He really turns me off . 
 No . He likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room . 
 Yes . But he doesn't care . I really wouldn't want to move , but I simply can ’ t stand him . 
 Good morning , sir . Can I see your boarding pass , please ? 
 Excuse me , sir . This is your passport . 
 Yes . As a matter of fact , you can't board the plane without boarding pass . 
 I'm sorry sir . I can't let you pass . 
 Ugh , in about thirty minutes , sir . 
 Calm down , sir . You are creating a commotion . 
 Could be . 
 Madam , I made a close study of the draft contract yesterday evening . I think there are something needs to modify . 
 First , about the terms of payment . Your draft contract says that payment is to be made by D \ A . This is not our practice . We prefer to have the payment made by L \ C through a negotiating bank in America . 
 The second thing I would like to point out , that is packaging . It's stipulated in the contract that all the computer parts should be packed in cardboard boxes . But I think the wooden cases are much safer . 
 As far as the contract stipulations are concerned , there is nothing more . Thank you very much . 
 Can you shorten this pipe for me ? It's too long . 
 Can you take 15 mm of it ? 
 What kinds of things do you like to do ? 
 I didn't know you knew how to draw and paint . 
 How long have you known how to do that ? 
 Did you take some sort of art class or something ? 
 You have got to be talented . 
 If only I was talented . 
 Where do you come from ? 
 What's the climate like in your country ? 
 Which seasons do you like best ? 
 Most people in Montreal speak French . 
 Only less than 20 percent of the citizens speak English . 
 It was really nice talking to you also . 
 That should be loads of fun . 
 Would you like to go to dinner or something ? 
 Okay , until next time then . 
 Talk to you then . 
 See you . 
 Bucharest , Romania . 
 Here you are . 
 Pleasure . I'm visiting my relatives . 
 Three weeks . 
 I work as an accountant for a Romanian telecommunications company . 
 Yes , here it is . 
 Thank you . 
 The Grand Hotel . 
 Yes . Do you know where it is ? 
 It's the 11th Avenue , Park Street . 
 Have you found another job yet , Sally ? 
 What kind of job are you looking for ? 
 You haven't had any experience in either of those fields . 
 Excuse me . Do you mind if I ask some things about work for this company ? 
 I've heard that the company is very strict with its staff . Is that true ? 
 If you make mistakes in your job , you'll be fired . Is that right ? 
 Working here involves a busy schedule and overtime . Is that true ? 
 It seems that working in a foreign enterprise is not the same as I expected . Thank you for your help . 
 I ’ m not sure . I feel hot and cold . 
 I was sick most of the night . 
 Have I got high fever ? 
 Yes , I have . 
 ah . 
 All right , thanks . 
 What shall I do today ? 
 It's time to graduate and it's time to find a job . Susan , why do we need to find a job ? 
 But you know it's hard for a new graduate to find a god job right now . 
 I've been fed up with study . 
 Oh , my . Why there are still so many things to learn after graduation ? 
 How many ports do we call at on our passage ? 
 The ship is going very fast . 
 You look pale . Are you seasick ? 
 I have some tablets for seasickness . 
 Then we'd better go back to our cabin . 
 You know , next week , we ’ ll hold a football match . Our cheering squad is busy rehearsing the programmes for it 
 Fill it up . Super Unleaded . 
 I just checked the oil myself , but you can check the tires . 
 I'll charge it . Here's my card . 
 What about these ? They are very fresh and exceptionally juicy . 
 Very sweet . 
 These are a dollar each and those are 75 cents each . 
 OK . Anything else ? 
 Yes , we've just had some wonderful tangerines in from Tailband . Here they are . 
 Thirty dollars . 
 In comparison to city life , the country life is quiet and peaceful . 
 Yeah , I agree.Every wall has two sides . 
 You are the leading company in the computer industry . 
 First , your overwhelming share in the world market . Second , your superiority in sales and profits in addition to the amount of capital and the number of employees . Third , the diversity in your production line is second to none . 
 In particular , I'm interested in marketing in the domestic field . 
 Yes , we do . They are all in this book . 
 No problem . Just give us a few minutes more to pull them up , though . We don ’ t get that many English singers ! 
 Hi , I have a reservation under the name of Sandals . 
 Of course ! Let me take it out of my wallet . 
 Yes , of course . Is American Express okay ? 
 In that case , here's my VISA . 
 Yes , I'm easy to please . 
 Can I help you , Miss ? 
 What is your skin type ?

 Is it ready to eat ? 
 May I help you ? 
 Sure . How do you like your money ? 
 No problem . Here you are . 
 May I know the definite date of delivery ? 
 Is there any possibility for you to ensure prompt shipment ? 
 Good morning , Sir . 
 Is this where I catch the bus for the zoo ? 
 That ’ s a little troublesome . 
 Maybe that ’ s what I'll do . Thanks a lot . 
 We agree to give you a break on the price , all together a discount of 6 % . Good news is , I talked to my boss , he confirmed that if you take care of the shipping costs , we'll throw in insurance . 
 Now , all this is available to you , as far as you make payment within a 30 day grace period . That shouldn't be a problem , right ? 
 So , if all this is agreeable to you , I'll put it all down on paper and fax a contract to you this afternoon . If you can get a signed version of the contract we've agreed upon back to me by tomorrow morning , we can go ahead and make arrangements to ship the product on Tuesday . 
 Have you been to the Queen Street West ? 
 You can find the most fashionable restaurants there . And also you can see the galleries , antique shops and the ballrooms . 
 I'm looking for a pair of white sports shoes to go with my jeans . 
 Adidas . Size 38 . 
 Yes . ( After trying ) A bit tight actually , they pinch my toes . Have you got a larger pair . Size 39 ? 
 ( After trying ) Mm , this pair fits me well . I'll take it . How much is it ?

 Around 9 p . m . 
 Fine . Do you accept American Express ? 
 It ’ s 134986 
 Where do you want to go this weekend ? 
 Do you want to take the jet ski ? 
 Oh , that's right . Renting is good ! 
 Okay , you call them . 
 Good afternoon , Chloe , I ’ m Doctor Evans.What seems to be the problem ? 
 Ah I see , yes you do sound rather croaky . Well let ’ s have a look , shall we ? Could you please open your mouth and say ” ah ” . 
 Good , yes , your tonsils are a little swollen and red . How are your ears , blocked at all ? 
 Ok Chloe , can you please breathe in and out slowly for me while I listen to your chest ? You really are all bunged up , you don ’ t sound too good at all . Ok , I ’ m going to set you up with a bunch of antibiotics . You will need to take these orange pills twice a day and these blue pills every evening . You will also have to take this cough medicine three times a day after meals . Finally , I am giving you an inhaler to use every time you feel breathless . . . just to clear up your lungs ! 
 Absolutely not ! You are highly contagious ! You don ’ t want to infect the rest of your co-workers do you ? I recommend staying in bed for at least three days and drinking plenty of fluids so you don ’ t get weak and dehydrated . You can catch up on all the latest TV shows and movies ! 
 Ha-ha , sure not a problem ! Here you are.Now off you go and away to bed . If you have any questions just give me a call ! Feel better soon and take care . 
 What schools have you attended ? 
 How do you think the education you have received will contribute to your work in this company ? 
 Your graduation thesis was on Medical Application of Laser , right ? What were your conclusions ? 
 How much are you planning to buy ? 
 Cool ! Can I come ? 
 But not enough space for me ? 
 Billy ... 
 You mean one for the city ? 
 I'm afraid we don't have any . If I were you , I'd try one of the newspaper stands . 
 But you should be considerate to the kids , it ’ s their nature to play . 
 Of course , it ’ s not polite of them , but sometimes you should put things the other way round and try to understand them . 
 I ’ m in a bit of a hurry , Louise . Can it wait ? 
 All right . Why don ’ t you have a seat ? What ’ s the problem ? 
 Wow ! That car almost hit me . 
 Yes , it seems to me we have come quite a long way . However , let me take a close look at the final draft . 
 Well , everything we've discussed seems to be here . 
 I'll need a few minutes to check over my notes again on every detail . What about the quality standard ? 
 In order to extend our export business to your country , we wish to enter into direct business relations with you . 
 Our hope is to establish mutual beneficial trading relations between us . 
 Oh , my dear lady , take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him . 
 I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems . 
 Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend , not a boss . 
 Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do . Make sure you won't lose your temper ! 
 No , it's unnecessary . Just respect the staff and their own opinions . 
 Oh , no one is perfect . 
 We have the equal partnership in team . 
 Thanks for saying that . 
 I've got some documents here that go with the L / C our company opened 10 days ago . I think there is something wrong . 
 Very carefully , that's when I found the problem . 
 Yep , you've got it ! What should we do ? 
 That's a great idea ; thanks for your help . 
 You mean the large one or the small one ? 
 They're on special this week . They've been reduced to five dollars . 
 No . We have some that are different in style but not in color . They're over there . Do you see the sign ? 
 Very well . Just take your time . 
 I got stuck in traffic again . There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection . 
 I don't think it can be avoided , to be honest . 
 I think it's something that I'll have to consider . The public transport system is pretty good . 
 I know . I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city . 
 the only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car . 
 that's true . I could certainly use the exercise ! 
 yes , it's not good for me or for the environment . 
 Ok . 
 Thanks . 
 Good morning . I'm calling to ask if you have a vacant apartment . 
 I prefer a one-bedroom apartment . 
 I'll share it with one of my friends . What ’ s in a one-bedroom apartment ? 
 Is there any furniture ? 
 It sounds wonderful . Do I have to sign a lease ? How much should I pay ? 
 When can I come over ? 
 OK . Good-bye . 
 Operator . 
 I'll be happy to try . 
 May I have your name and room number , please ? 
 I'd like to have steak and a beer . 
 Well-done , please . 
 Yes , of course . 
 All right . Your name , please . 
 Chen Liang , a table for four . And when are you coming ? 
 OK . We look forward to seeing you . Goodbye . 
 Henry , do you know how much we spent this month ? 
 we've spent $ 1,000 . 
 What kind of qualities should a secretary have ? 
 I am diligent and hard-working . Besides , I am good at both English and Italian . 
 When will we leave here ? 
 Thank you for bringing me here Hong , this place looks great ! 
 Let me see . How about the lotus root ? 
 Oh , yes that would be nice . 
 Actually , I ’ m vegetarian so I ’ d like to have the bean curd . 
 Excuse me , you look lost . Can I help you ? 
 Right . Let me see . You go straight down here and turn right . 
 Then take the next left then the next right . Are you with me ? 
 Have you had any experience with sales work ? 
 What exactly did you do at that company ? 
 Did you like your work ? 
 But when and why did you leave the company ? 
 I see . Why did you choose our company ? 
 Aunt Cindy , do you shop online often ? 
 Last week , I tried to buy some books online , but I didn't know how to pay for them ? 
 Are there many things online ? 
 Oh , what's this ? Second-hand cellphone store ? 
 Really ? How to do that ? 
 That's amazing . I'd love to try it later . Oh , an on-line virtual supermarket ? 
 Oh , I got it . It simulates the real supermarket , which makes it feel so real . Mom will love it . She loves shopping in supermarkets . 
 Are there any disadvantages about it ? 
 Are you ready to move ? 
 Yes , but there is a chance that might be suitable for you . 
 I can't say , but let me make a call and see if I can help . 
 This apartment is wonderful . 
 How much would I have to pay for rent ? 
 That ’ s way too much money . 
 How about if I pay $ 850 ? 
 I can ’ t go any higher than $ 850 . 
 You can ’ t go any lower than that ? 
 Good.Now what kind of job do you want ? Mr.Wilson ? 
 Well , I know Brown's Biscuit Factory are looking for a porter.They pay $ 200 a week . 
 Good.Now here's the address of the factory.The manager's name is ... 
 I ’ d say the main reason is poverty . Countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . If their neighbors have some resources , they try to steal them by military force . 
 several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end . 
 I don ’ t think that there is any easy way . The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . The thing is to find the real pro 
 It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries . 
 The problem is that many poor people might suffer . 
 I'm glad we're meeting today . Thank you . 
 I would like to talk to you about your daughter . 
 No , your daughter is great . 
 Your daughter is a wonderful student . 
 Of course not . Your daughter is smart and very well behaved . 
 It is my pleasure to have her in my class . 
 Here . Catch ! 
 I thought he only liked to listen ? 
 And he can move , too ! He dances like Ricky Martin ! 
 No . I have nothing . 
 Yes , they are . 
 OK . 
 Thank you . Could you change it for a purple one ? 
 Will it shrink when washed ? 
 Hi , boss . You have a call . 
 I know . But she said she had an important thing to tell you . 
 Thanks . 
 Well , I wasn't planning on spending that much money today , so ... 
 Even if an item is on sale ? 
 Oh ! It's so cute ! 
 How long would you like to keep it ? 
 Yes , that'd be all right . 
 I ’ Ve been a secretary for two years , before that I was at university . 
 It ’ s challenging , I feel I have learned a lot . 
 I get along well with people , and I enjoy working with others . 
 Hello . This is Hamilton ’ s Heating and cooling service . Can I help you ? 
 What ’ s the problem ? 
 Maybe the compressor is going bad . 
 Sure . But there is a minimum charge of $ 60 for a service visit . If your freezer needs parts , there will be an additional charge . 
 All right . let me check our technician ’ s schedules . I ’ ll call you back and let you know what time we can send a service technician to your house . What is your phone number ? 
 Okay . I ’ ll call you right back . 
 Bye . 
 Yes , they all stop at this corner . 
 You can take any bus except the Number 9 . 
 They run about every five minutes . 
 About fifteen minutes . It's not far.Are you a stranger in New York ? 
 How do you like New York city ? 
 You'll soon get accustomed to it . It's not difficult . Well , here's the bus.Fortunately , it's not full . 
 Don't mention it . 
 What ? You don ’ t know the first thing about gardening ! 
 Oh yeah ? Tell me then , smarty pants , how will you go about setting up your garden ? 
 What type of tools ? 
 Right . Well it seems like you have all your bases covered . What ’ s next ? 
 Well , good luck with your garden , especially considering we are in the dry season and it won ’ t rain for the next three months ! 
 Yes . He ’ s in hospital with a bad back . One morning , he just couldn ’ t get out of bed . His wife called an ambulance and they took him to hospital . He ’ s been there for a few days now . 
 You have to be very careful with seafood . It tastes lovely , but it often causes upset stomachs . Have you heard anything from Tom ? 
 He might be allergic to pollen . My niece is allergic to pollen . It seems like she has a cold , but in fact it ’ s her allergy . 
 It ’ s nice that she ’ s back for a while . Thinking of all these ailments , I got a splinter the other day . It took a long time for me to get it out of my skin . Look . 
 That ’ s a good idea . You ’ Ve got a nasty bruise on your hand . 
 What do you feel your greatest achievement has been at your current job ? 
 That certainly is quite an accomplishment . 
 What's your sales record been like there ? 
 If things are going so well , why do you want to leave the firm now ? 
 Hi dude , you look upset , what's up ? 
 What's the problem ? 
 Well , you can simply tell them you want to sleep , or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down . 
 I understand . I used to live in a dorm with four people . I was great in some aspects . We always went out and and had fun together . But on the other hand , when I wanted some quiet time , and people kept talking and laughing aloud , it was torturous . For me a room to myself , even a small one , is ideal . Though I don't mind sharing an apartment with somebody . 
 Welcome to our factory . My name is Tiang Had and I'll show you around here.First we'll take a look at the workshop which produces food thermometers . Please , this way . 
 Yes , it has . 
 This is a circuit board . 
 No , they are from other factories . 
 It is lithium which can be used for over three years . 
 Miao Ping , if I do decide to go ahead , how will the interest if I exceed be counted ? 
 So , if I do decide to go ahead , how can my company open a Corporate Agreement Savings Plan with you ? 
 OK , let's get the ball rolling on this . 
 Oh , that's all right . 
 No . Forget about it . It's not important . 
 I am . 
 The police officer that pulled me over said I was speeding . 
 I was not speeding . 
 In a 40 mph zone , I was only going about 35 . 
 Do I still need to pay the fine ? 
 I appreciate your understanding . 
 Okay , well it ’ s always more difficult to describe them isn ’ t it ? 
 Well as I mentioned before , I do tend to get frustrated if I don ’ t see progress in my work or career . I suppose I ’ m quite a restless character . My father always taught me to be a high achiever so . 
 Well , in a way yes . But I must say that even if I ’ m not completely happy in my work I always give 110 % I would never shirk my responsibilities . I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon . 
 Yes , please . 
 As you know , china has a single-child policy . Therefore , there ’ s just my husband , my daughter and I . What about in your family ? 
 Not anymore . They live with my brother now . and yours ? 
 No , I have two older brothers and one younger sister . What about you ? 
 How long have you been married ? 
 I ‘ Ve been married for about five years . What do you think about divorce ? 
 If my husband cheated on me or treated me badly , I would get a divorce . 
 ( ha ha ) I ’ ll keep that in mind , but don ’ t tell my husband . 
 I definitely want to meet with you , Mr . Parker . I just need to sort out my schedule . 
 I realize that . We don ’ t have any time to waste . I can put you down for 9:20 . Could you make that , Mr . Parker ? 
 What's the matter , sir ? You look pale . 
 Are you often traveling by plane ? 
 That's right . It's normal if you don't often take the plane . Just relax a little bit . 
 Don't worry , sir . It's just because of the lower pressure . 
 You may feel much better if you chew some gum or peanuts . 
 Are you feeling better now ? Do you need some pills ? 
 So , you'd better wear this eyeshade and you will sleep well . 
 If you try to adapt yourself to your destination's local time , you'll feel more comfortable . So please try to sleep , and have meals according to Los Angeles's time . 
 You are welcome . Please press the button when you need any help . 
 Oh really ? When is it going to start ? 
 Well , I ’ d like to , but I ’ m going to have to look at my schedule . 
 Thank you for that , and in return , here's your receipt . 
 I hope you'll visit us again , sir . 
 I guarantee you that our little “ friends ” won't be back . I hope your trip home is pleasant . 
 Let me check the computer . Uh-oh , Looks like your luggage is on its way to Paris . 
 Well , we can give you this lovely shaving kit and call you the minute your luggage arrives here . Just leave us a contact number . 
 Thank you . I am terribly sorry about this . It very rarely happens . We do have a sophisticated tracking system , so I know we will find it soon . But we apologize for the inconvenience . 
 Wow ! I have been working here for 15 years and you ’ re the first person to accept a lost luggage situation cheerfully . 
 Come again ? What are you talking about ? Aren't we on the same team now ? 
 What do you mean ? You didn't ? Oh , no ... No ! 
 But how ? So you knew all along I was with WebTracker ? How did you know ? 
 Have you find any job that you are interested in ? 
 There ’ s not a very high demand for that kind of job , isn ’ t there ? 
 That ’ s a good idea . You have plenty of experience in marketing , don ’ t you ? 
 By the way , I saw a job in the paper this morning that you might be interested in . 
 It is a job at an advertisement company . 
 Anyway , it is worth trying . 
 I'll be back late tonight . 
 I have a meeting with my General Manager . 
 Yes , ma ’ am . I could come in any day next week , except for Friday morning . 
 Yes . That would be fine . 
 Sure , would you prefer looking in the morning or afternoon ? 
 Can you go during the week , or can you only go during the weekend ? 
 Where would you like me to pick you up ? 
 I am thinking of looking at three houses , and it will take about two hours . 
 Once I contact the owners and confirm the times , I will e-mail you a schedule . 
 Oh , my bread ! 
 Curse this oven ! Curse it ! 
 Curse the worst oven in the world . 
 There are thirteen of them . Oh , have another . Have a third , if you like , have them all . 
 OK , what style do you want ? 
 What about this one ? It fits you . 
 Is there a train leaving for Philadelphia ? 
 May I buy a ticket here at the station ? 
 Where ? 
 Thanks . 
 May I have a look at your receipt ? 
 All right . Wait a minute . 
 I want a job in which I can use English , I would also like to be able to have some responsibility in my work . 
 Yes , I see . In my previous job , I did typing and filing everyday . 
 Well , not exactly , but I have shown some of my foreign friends around Beijing . 
 I think I would like that . 
 Hello , Marsha , I haven't heard from you in a long time . I'm great , and you ? 
 Sure , what can I do for you ? 
 I'm really busy right now . I got a lot on my plate.So this isn't an actual bid you want but just a ballpark figure ? 
 Well , I can give you those figures now over the phone , is that okay ? Or do you need them in writing ? 
 Is this another rush , dear ? Did you forget and wait until the last minute again ? 
 Well , just because it's you . Tomorrow , say around noon . 
 What's it like ? 
 And then ? 
 That's neat ! 
 OK . Commodity inspection is really an important part of our trade contract . 
 Following the rules of world business , the exporters have the right to inspect the goods before the delivery , while the importers have the right to re-inspect the goods after their arrival . 
 Inspection is to be done by the China Commodity Inspection and Testing Bureau . Usually inspection is conducted within five days before each shipment . 
 Yes . The re-inspection should be made within seven days upon the arrival , and if any discrepancy is found , the claim must be raised within one month . 
 They always use the standard and method laid down in the contract . 
 A seminar of technical specialists including the surveyors from both sides will be held to clarify which result is correct . 
 I buy a computer magazine every month . It keeps me up-to date with all the latest developments . 
 Sometimes it takes too long to find the exact information you are looking for . Besides , I like to read a magazine in a coffee bar sometimes . 
 Yes , they do . But you can only access all the articles if you have a subscription . 
 Yes , I do . The magazine arrives by post at the beginning of each month . Do you every buy magazines ? 
 Can I help you ? 
 Ten Yuan . 
 One Yuan . 
 And here's your change . Please check if it is correct . 
 Welcome to come again . 
 Let ’ s play a little game . I ’ ll describe someone and you try to guess who it is . 
 Ok . This man is tall and slim . He ’ s got blue eyes and curly brown hair . 
 Good question . Yes , he has a moustache , but no beard . 
 Yes , it is . You describe someone we both know . 
 Is she attractive ? I don ’ t think I know anyone like that . 
 I like slim girls , so I doubt I would find a plump girl attractive . You ’ ll have to give me some more information . 
 This doesn ’ t sound like anyone I know . I give up . Teel me who she is . 
 How embarrassing ! I don ’ t even recognize a description of my own mother ! How important do you think appearance is ? 
 I ’ m afraid you ’ re right . I chose my girlfriend because she has a wonderful personality . 
 Mark , you are not telling me the truth . Now why ? 
 Yes , all right . So why ? Go on then . Say it . Oh , really , Mark . I promise I'm not going to be angry . Now why were you late ? 
 You forgot ? You ... 
 Excuse me , I got a parcel arrival notice yesterday . 
 Here you are . 
 Yes , here is my ID card . 
 Really ? Let me check it . 
 No , ma'am . I ’ m afraid you put in only one quarter and one dime . 
 I would like to make a deposit . 
 I ’ m depositing a check . 
 All right . Here you go . 
 That would be great . 
 I would like $ 150 . 
 Thanks for everything . 
 Me too . Is there a place nearby that we can get something to eat ? 
 Kentucky's ? Is that a chain restaurant ? 
 I've heard about it , but never had one . 
 OK . Let's go . 
 Let's get start . What kinds of things do you have in mind ? If you let us know the requirements you have from the very beginning , we can work through each one until we can come to an agreement . 
 Huh ... I think 7 % is little high that might be hard to do . How about this ? We'll give you a discount of 4 % , but you can have 90 days credits . 
 No , you have to take care of the insurance . But we are willing to pay the half transport . Can you accept that ? 
 But you'll have 90 days to pay your bill and I'll tell you what ... I'll also throw in the discount of 10 % on your up front deposit . 
 Doctor Ruth's office , may I help you ? 
 Let's see , Mr . Horn ... The doctor's schedule is full today . Would tomorrow be all right ? 
 Would you prefer to come in in the morning or the afternoon ? 
 The doctor has an opening at 10:30 tomorrow . I'll put you down for then . 
 Okay , Mr . Horn , see you tomorrow at 10:30 . 
 Oh , yeah . We will have winter holiday . 
 Don ’ t worry , mum . I will study hard tomorrow . 
 Hey daddy ! You look great today . I like your tie ! By the way , I was wondering can I ... 
 I haven't even told you what it is yet ! 
 Do you think I could borrow the car ? I ’ m going to a concert tonight . 
 Egg ! I told you about it last week ! Smelly Toes is playing , and Eric asked if I would go with him ! 
 Duh ! He's like the hottest and most popular guy at school ! Come on , dad ! Please ! 
 Fine then ! Would you mind giving me 100 bucks ? 
 That ’ s so unfair ! 
 I have had a low fever these days . 
 Thank you , doctor . 
 Maybe it is right since everything is possible . You know the market changes quickly these days . But I still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance . For me , his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy . I really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns . 
 I will think about it . 
 Yes . 
 That will be fine . 
 Sure . Firstly , it is very important for you to be punctual . Interviewers usually don ’ t think much of a candidate who comes 5 or 10 minutes late only to explain that he could not find the place or he was stuck in traffic . 
 Secondly , you need to create a good image in a limited time . 
 I think you should make some preparations . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . What ’ s more , try to avoid a too causal style . 
 You ’ d better not . Informal clothes like sports shirts , tom jeans or dirty sneakers convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . 
 OK , Mr . Wang . Thank you very much for coming to the airport to see us off . Your great country and your hospitality have left a very deep impression on all of us and your working attitude and your way of doing business have changed my opinions about Chinese people . 
 That's true . And this trip has been a very productive one for us . 
 Believe me , Mr . Wang . I'll do my best to promote the transaction . 
 It ’ s very kind of you to say so . 
 I think we will have opportunities to meet each other in the future . 
 Fine . Thank you very much . Bye-bye . 
 Did you enjoy your meal ? 
 May I interest you in some dessert ? 
 Well , we have chocolate mousse cake , homemade fresh strawberry shortcake , and a spicy rum apple crisp for our specials . 
 Since there are four of you , would you like to split a second dessert ? 
 Would you like coffee or tea with your dessert ? 
 OK . I will be right back with your desserts and drinks . 
 I come home for lunch . 
 Only 1 hour . 
 Hi , I'd like two tickets to Providence , please . 
 What time does the next train leave ? 
 Ok , could you give me two tickets for that ? 
 Thank you very much for telling me all these things about the college . 
 It's my greatest pleasure to have met you.See you around . 
 Room service.May I come in ? 
 Here is your laundry . I am sorry to tell you that one of your clothes has shrunk due to our fault . 
 We are terribly sorry for that.Could you please buy a new one and give us the receipt ? We will refund the cost of the laundry and the new sweater . 
 Would you please fill out the form ? 
 No , that's not true.The White House is very big . And there are a lot of historical exhibits there.The tour will take us through many different rooms . I read about it in the guide . 
 I'm sure the security is very tight.Probably they will make us walk through metal detectors like at the airport . 
 Don't always joke like that ! You don't have a gun . 
 You shouldn't say things like that . You could get arrested ! 
 No . But if you say something like that in the White House , they may take it seriously . Sometimes I think you joke too much . 
 I'm not sure . I think it lasts about one hour . 
 First I want to look in the travel guide.Maybe they don't have tours in the morning . 
 No , I'm fine . 
 Have you tried the Internet ? 
 Wow , you really live in the Stone Age , Mom . 
 Go to www.yahoo.com and click on Travel and tickets . There are about a billion sites to look at . 
 All right . 
 You two are so health-conscious ! 
 Why not ! Before you know it , I'll be heading off to the mountains to stand on my head ! 
 Thanks for the carrot juice , Mrs . Schmidt . I've got to run to class ! 
 I'd like to rent a car for several days . 
 Well , what kinds do you have ? 
 Honda is OK . 
 Is that you , Janice ? Just speaking . 
 So sorry to hear that . What's wrong with you ? 
 Is that serious ? You ought to see a doctor . 
 That's good . Do you suppose you will be back at company the day after tomorrow ? 
 Well , take care of yourself . And hope you will be better as soon as possible . 
 You know I did . 
 I voted for Obama , of course ! 
 I knew he would win . 
 He was the top candidate . 
 That just goes to show that America is finally turning over a new leaf . 
 I ’ m excited that Barack Obama is our President . 
 Yes , I just bought new car , I drive to work everyday ! 
 Sure , I see safety is most important thing ! Accident is awful ! I will take your advice ! 
 Yes , definitely ! You can't drive freely ! 
 Compare with speaking , yes ! But things are not good as you expecting ! 
 Can you see that road side help ? 
 That's right . We have to slow down again . If we haven't meet the passing tree , we have to stop a car away . 
 There are a plenty of signs such as Watch for children ! 
 Yes , speaking.May I help you ? 
 That's too bad.What kind of accident is it ? Are you all right ? 
 OK . I'll do it right away , but tell me how it happened . 
 Good morning . I ’ m Liu Yi , from China XYZ Company . We have an appointment with Mr . Thomas . 
 Thank you . 
 Should each of us write separately ? 
 I need to get on another bus , but I have no more money . 
 I spent it on a bag of chips . 
 You don't have any spare change ? 
 How am I going to get home ? 
 How much does that cost ? 
 Thanks for letting me know . 
 I haven't received my credit card bill yet . 
 My Master Card . 
 I never got it . 
 What am I going to do since I haven't received the bill ? 
 Can I get an extension on my bill if it does happen to be the post office's fault ? 
 Thanks for everything . 
 Mr . Mass , here is a gift for you . 
 It's a souvenir I bought for you from Rome . 
 I'm glad you like it . 
 Don't mention it . Just a little thing I did .

 College job placement services can help . 
 Yes , I was wondering if you had the time to show me around this exhibition ? 
 I'm in the electrical appliances . 
 Thanks , they are rather attractive . But I think there is nothing better than seeing things In actual operation . 
 Yes , very much , if it wouldn't add inconvenience to you . First hand information is always more valuable than reading pamphlets . 
 That would be great . 
 Hi , I ’ m Henry Wilson from number 37 . 
 Yes . Everything is fine in the apartment . But I know nothing about this area . Could I ask you some questions ? 
 Can you tell me the postal code for this building ? 
 Thank you . Also , how can I get my mailbox key ?

 Yes . 
 What floor is the office on ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Hello , sir . How many in your party ? 
 OK , a single fare is $ 50 per right . 
 No , it's not necessary . But you have to fill out this form . 
 Have you decided on something ? 
 Sure . Anything else ? 
 Potato chips and French dressing . 
 I ’ m sure we could get one or two tv companies to come in . Perhaps the president could invite them and do an interview . 
 It will be expensive to do outside the campus . Perhaps we could arrange for some sponsorship . 
 Good thinking ! We should also print some leaflets for students to distribute . 
 We could take out some advertisements to local newspapers . I checked the prices and they are reasonable . 
 Hello , May I speak to Mary , please ? 
 Hi Mary , This is Tom . 
 Just fine . I see . Aren ’ t you busying tomorrow evening ? 
 Well , why not dine out together and go to the moves . 
 Ok . I ‘ l l pick you up at 6 o ’ clock . 
 Excuse me , would you get me some paper napkins ? 
 Could you recommend some dessert ? 
 Don't you have cheese ? 
 So you've been attending night classes for a while now . Do you feel it's helping you ? 
 Really ? That's great that you found a school that puts your need first . 
 That's great . They must really be committed to staff development . 
 So , you know how to drive , right ? 
 Do you think you can teach me ? 
 I have it already . 
 I've only done it once . 
 Yes , I am aware of them . 
 Whenever you have time . 
 Yo , G.How are you getting along with your classmates in the English training school ? 
 The boat is ready to leave.Everyone come onto the ship , please .

 Sure . Take your time . 
 $ 80 . 
 I haven't got enough for prosecuting him . 
 I'm just thinking about that , but the trouble is , I don't know who is well in the know . 
 Thanks for reminding me . She's the right person to help me . 
 Oh John , I thought we said we would start eating right ! Remember ? Our new healthy lifestyle ? That ’ s all junk food ! 
 Well , healthy food , of course ! I got some whole wheat bread , skimmed milk , fresh fish and organic carrots ... 
 They were grown without using any chemicals that are harmful to our health . And yes , John , we need organic carrots ... 
 Yup , better for the environment and better for us ! 
 I like doughnuts . 
 Where is this Sons located ? 
 You're going to need to take two buses to get to that Sons . 
 First , you need to get on the 268 going west . 
 You need to get off on Fair Oaks and Washington . 
 Get on the 261 , and it'll take you the rest of the way to Sons . 
 That's all there is to it . 
 All right , how about the other guests . 
 Ok . 
 I'm afraid we have no more sole . 
 Certainly , just a moment , sir . 
 The one on the manikin is in fashion now . 
 OK , here you are . You look really attractive in that gown . 
 Linda , this is Todd calling . 
 Linda , I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed our time together last Friday night . 
 I had a great time too and was thinking that maybe you might want to join me for a hike to the waterfalls on Saturday . 
 Linda , that would be a perfect addition . 
 I was hoping to leave by 9 o'clock so that it won \ ' t be too hot for the hike . 
 Cindy ! Are you getting take-out ? 
 Yeah , thanks . Could you pick me up a chicken salad sandwich , an order of fries , and a large diet coke ? 
 Excuse me , miss . Could I have something to drink , please ? 
 Is it possible to get a beer ? 
 You ’ re right . I ’ ll save the beer for when we land . One orange juice , please . 
 Yeah , it is . I come here all the time . 
 OK . 
 Sure . What are you going to have to drink ? 
 I think I'll have a glass of wine . 
 Not really , maybe we can just order some bread . 
 I'm not sure . I haven't decided yet . Can you recommend something ? 
 I think I'll have the lobster . What are you going to have ? 
 I'm gonna go to the bathroom . When the waitress comes back , will you order for me ? 
 Good evening , sir . I understand that you have been robbed . 
 When did this happen ? 
 Why didn't you report it before ? 
 Please tell me exactly what happened . 
 That wasn't very wise , sir . 
 You should never open a door without looking to see who it is . 
 What happened ? 
 Did you get a good look at them ? 
 What did they take ? 
 They don't seem to have done much damage to the flat . 
 My men began searching the area as soon as we received your call . I can't promise you that we'll recover your property but we'll certainly do our best . 
 You don't know what happened ? 
 There was a truck on the freeway , and it flipped over . 
 I wouldn't lie about something like that . 
 I heard that a couple people got hurt . 
 The news said they should be fine . 
 Me too . 
 Yes , a red wine and a cup of coffee . 
 With milk but without sugar , please . 
 Yes , please . 
 Sure , I ’ m heading out myself . Enjoy your evening . 
 Thanks for the warning ! See you tomorrow ! 
 It comes to $ 100 . 
 Sure . Here is your receipt and you can draw your tax paid for those goods at customs . 
 Happy New Year , Thomas . How many joys nice drinks with us , will you ? 
 First , I am going to get ready for the parade , I have a great costume . Then later today , I am going to church . If you want , I can give you a costume , and you can be at parade too . It will be fun 
 My father likes to go , and I told him I will go with him . 
 Lots of people especially seniors like to go to church , and attend the evening service . 
 If only we'd remember to close it . 
 I wish I'd put it in the bank . 
 I know , I am sorry I ever bought it . 
 Do you have a good English-Chinese dictionary ? 
 Is this the latest edition ? 
 What's the difference ? 
 Oh ! I see . I'll have the paperback , please , 
 Fill out this form with whatever you need . What do you need the most ? 
 I can get a few of them right away , but might have to order some . 
 Make sure that you have money allocated for these supplies . How much do you have for office supplies ? 
 Would you like them delivered to you or can you come get them here ? 
 When you finish completing the request form , we will order and let you know when the supplies are here . Have a great day ! 
 That dress is too expensive . 
 Yes , it is pretty , but it costs $ 200 . What about this one ? It ’ s almost the same , but it costs half as much . 
 It ’ s just a little shorter . 
 Well , it ’ s your money . You can spend it however you want . Do you really think it ’ s pretty ? 
 Is it possible that I have a business trip abroad and work in American once in a while ? 
 Is there any training program for the employees to make a further study ? 
 Bob was late for work this morning . 
 Yes , once last week . 
 Hello , Lucy . This is Monica again . I have a question . 
 I was wondering what kind of resume do you prefer , an e-resume or a paper one ? 
 Ok , thank you . 
 Can I try it on now ? 
 The dress is slim in cut . 
 Why don't you begin by telling me something about yourself ? 
 The usual , you know , something about your background and experience and anything personal that you feel is pertinent . 
 Sounds as if you come from a professional family . 
 What made you decide to get into computers ? 
 Now what about your experience ? How long have you been working with computers ? 
 It certainly sounds impressive . Why don't you have your credentials sent to me and I'll show them to the board ? We'll probably get back to you in a week . 
 Hey , Gary , great to see you again . Please have a seat . So tell me , what seems to be the problem ? 
 Well , let ’ s have a look . Open wide . Hmm ... this doesn ’ t look good . Well , it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose . We ’ ll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse , and the crown probably needs to be refitted . I ’ m going to order some x-rays . 
 No , not at all ! Just lay back and relax . 
 Nice and easy . Just give it a little gas . 
 First you have to put the car into gear . Move this shifter so the arrow points at D for drive . 
 R is for reverse , P is for park , and D1 and D2 are lower gears for going through snow , or up a steep hill . 
 Why ? They keep going up . 
 I'd like to go to Suzhou next week . Do you know how to get there by train ? 
 I see . Do you know how much the ticket is ? 
 Is it far from here to Suzhou ? 
 How long will it take to get there ? 
 Hi , Alex . Would you come with me to supply ? I ’ Ve got to pick up a load of stuff and I ’ m afraid I can ’ t carry it all . 
 Thanks . I appreciate the hand . I ’ d have to make two or three trips on my own . 
 Can you please give me a hand ? I can ’ t carry the heavy box . 
 I think you are flicking through it . 
 I want to settle my account . 
 Well , I think something must be wrong with my bill . I didn't have any laundry . 
 Ok , so where do you think we can save more money ? 
 Yeah . That ’ s a good idea and you like to cook . What about the books ? 
 Come on . If we save more money , we can retire earlier and you ’ ll actually have time to read all those books you buy . 
 Ok . Let's compromise . If you agree to only spend 75 on books , I'll agree to only spend 40 for my next shirt . 
 I often see some ' new age people ' show off their various skills to handle a skateboard , which makes me wonder in awe . 
 Although it is easy to ride , the condition of the road surface should also be paid attention to , such as places being put together and full of gullies . If the condition permits , it is better to be equipped with helmet , eye shades , ankle shield , knee shield and elbow shield . 
 Can I give you a lift home , Mrs . Word ? 
 Could you hold my umbrella when I get my keys out , please ? 
 Dreadful . There , the door is open now . 
 Um , which of them is the better typist ? 
 Is there any difference in their short hand ? 
 How about languages ? 
 Um . That doesn ’ t really matter . Because we have more French visitors than German . 
 Oh , please do not mention it any more . Last night he did it for the first time . 
 Forget it ! It was a bitter pill for me to swallow . 
 Ha-ha . Last night , I only told him practice makes perfect . 
 Yeah , it will become a wider trend . 
 Yes , Mr . Ransom ? This is Karl Miller . How may I help you ? 
 Certainly , Ms . Ransom . Do you have an order number ? 
 Would you please tell me the exact problem , sir ? 
 Oh , my gosh , they're back ? Another room at once , sir , plus a full refund , of course . 
 Sir , our guests are our reason for being . 
 I am preparing a birthday party for Julia . 
 Of course , could you help to blow up some balloons ? 
 Well , would you please clean the livingroom ? You know I'm too busy . 
 Hey , Jim , it ’ s time to wake up and get out of bed . 
 You ’ d better get up , or you ’ ll be late . 
 Yes , it did . It went off 30 minutes ago . You slept right through it . You ’ re like a dead person while you sleep . 
 Rise and shine ! Sleepyhead ! 
 The early bird gets the worm . 
 Ha ! Ha ! If you don ’ t make an effort now , later on it ’ ll be a lot tougher for you . 
 Do you really want to know ? 
 You did pretty bad . 
 You didn't pass the test . 
 There are a few reasons why you failed . 
 The main reason is the fact that you're a horrible driver . 
 You'll be able to take the test again in a couple weeks . 
 We look forward to a further extension of our pleasant business relations . 
 That will be good . 
 Yes , I am , and I am so excited . 
 I love my candidate . 
 My candidate is probably the most intelligent . 
 I also agree with all his policies . 
 I know he ’ s going to be the next President . 
 I can ’ t wait to vote . 
 No , I haven ’ t gotten over there in a few weeks . How is he ? 
 You said it ! I can't believe he lasted as long as he did . 
 The Scholar ? Let me see . Oh ... yes , Of course I know . It ’ s in the Lincoln Square . 
 Oh , yes . It ’ s just a few minutes block . Turn left at the traffic light , and you ’ ll see it . 
 Would you like me to type it for you ? 
 Not at all . I ’ ll be glad to do it . 
 Shall I right out again first ? 
 Can I print it ? 
 Is the new computerised stock system in operation ? 
 Have all the operators been trained on it ? 
 What's the fare , please ? 
 What ? You're overcharging me ! 
 Then something must be wrong with the meter . 
 Dear , this bakery has introduced some new types of cake recently and you can eat as much as you can . 
 I'm sorry . I won't do it again . 
 Is this the sign ? What does it say ? 
 Now let me tell you your definite duties in this office and this is your desk . Please sit down . 
 B , your main duty is to answer phone calls and transfer files to the person who wants them . Is that difficult ? 
 Well . I have nearly forgotten . Mr Green from ABC Company had an appointment with me , but I will be very busy at that time . If he calls , you can tell him the appointment will be changed to next week . 
 Can I ask a favor of you ? 
 Would you mail this letter for me when you go to the post office ? 
 DM210 is equivalent to 400 RIB . 
 Are you afraid of losing money due to exchange rate fluctuations ? 
 Mom , I finished . 
 Of course . 
 OK . Now I'll put the dishes in the sink . 
 OK . Then I will clean the table . 
 Why are you so angry , darling ? 
 How long has the company been in business ? 
 When did it become CABS ? 
 What does CABS stand for ? 
 Excuse me , I'd like to make a suit of this material . 
 Yes . Should I take off my coat ? 
 Please make a single-breasted . 
 How much does it cost ? 
 All right . When can I get it ? 
 Thank you . 
 Is that why you didn't return my call ? 
 That's okay . 
 Hello , Lina . I'm calling about your new PIN scheme . I'm new to all of this , so some of my questions may sound a little ignorant ... 
 I see . How about buying and selling items ? 
 That's good to know , because I do travel quite frequently . 
 I'm here on holiday and I don't have a local debit card . Is it possible to withdraw money on my Visa credit card here ? 
 Oh , yes . It's amazing here . I don't think I ever want to go home again ! 
 Fine . Here you go . 
 Is it OK to withdraw USD ? 
 OK , 200 USD , please . 
 Perfect . Thanks ! 
 OK . Let me see . 
 Excuse me , could you tell me where you have got that music book ? 
 It's too high . I can't reach it . Could you help me ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Good afternoon . My name is Monica . I am here for the job interview at 2 PM . 
 Done . Here is my paper . 
 What about the 3rd round ? 
 Good morning , Mr . Zhang . 
 How are you ? How nice to see you again . How is everything going ? 
 Not bad , thanks ! Our company has sent me to pick you up here . 
 I ’ m sorry to disturb you , Mr . Crane . 
 Could you please look over these resumes ? They ’ Ve just come in . 
 Can you tell me about some good deals on produce ? 
 What exactly are mangoes ? 
 Is the seed edible ? 
 How much does a mango cost ? 
 Maybe I won't like the taste . 
 How do I tell the difference between a ripe one and an unripe one ? 
 Where do most of them come from ? 
 Car trouble center . How may I help you ? 
 Hold on , before you kick your car let ’ s go through some possible problems . 
 OK , first of all , can you turn the key in the ignition ? 
 Those are possible problems , but tell me , when you turn the key , do you hear the starter motor crank ? 
 No . If you step on the accelerator pedal you can flood the carburetor and your car will never start . 
 I know this may seem like a silly question , but does your car have gasoline ? 
 What are you doing this weekend ? 
 Is it a family thing or just friends ? 
 Is your great uncle Rick going to be there ? He is really funny . 
 You mean your sister ? 
 You lost me . 
 When can you start the job ? 
 Can you start on Monday ? 
 That's all right . When you come , ask for Smith , OK ? 
 Morning , Tom ! What are you doing over there ? Learning to dance ? 
 Oh , my goodness . I'm sorry . But I don't think tai chi is to be practiced like that . 
 Well , they just look a bit funny . but far from making a laughing stock out of you . 
 To begin with , you should keep your neck erect upward at any time . 
 Good ! And then , the entire body . Never incline your body forward or backward . Take care to regulate the point of balance . Place it at your waist . 
 No ! You should avoid sticking out your belly . Keep your hip steady . Don't swing . 
 Oh , yes , things are quite different with the limbs . Keep your knees bent a little . Right , they should be rich in elasticity . Move slowly when you shift your centre of gravity from one leg to another . 
 Exactly ! Move your arms in a relaxed manner . Well . don't stretch yourfingers stiffly . Just keep them in a natural shape . 
 Let me have a look . 
 I like the fabric , but I don ’ t like the style . 
 They are too bright . 
 Oh , hi , Mary , what can I do for you ? 
 It ’ s on Tuesdays and Fridays . 
 You could save a couple of dollars by taking it to the dump yourself , though . 
 It ’ s at the corner of that street . 
 Just leave the stuff by the curb . The company ’ ll send a guy out next month to give you the bill . 
 No problem . 
 Why ? 
 Really , well , OK . Get the receipts out . 
 That's $ 1 825 . 
 $ 3 075 . Our paychecks is $ 3 300 , combined . That means we don't have any receipts for $ 225 . 
 Well , we could eat in more often . That $ 400 for entertainment is mostly going to restaurants . 
 All right . 
 Sorry , turkey . I have already got dibs on the TV for tonight , remember ? And I'm watching ' Disco Fever ' on channel 6 . 
 Hey , what's wrong with the TV ? 
 Looks like the TV wins that argument . 
 Sure , why not ? 
 Hi Mary . We are really looking forward to a great meal here . 
 I would love an appetizer . Are they listed in the menu ? 
 I am thinking about the popcorn shrimp . How is that ? 
 I'll trust your taste and take one order of that . 
 In that case , we'll take an order of onion rings with our first choice . 
 Don't be so dramatic . You're such a baby . Now sit down and finish your soup . 
 And when we get back from the doctor's , you'll gargle again . 
 Well , the only free food on the streets is from a soup kitchen , and their soup isn't as tasty as mine ! 
 I have many hobbies . I like most all kind of sports , and I also like to listen to classic musics . 
 Football.It ' s a very exciting game , because it keeps you alert , and I also enjoying the team spirit of football . 
 Yes . I enjoying reading biographs , especially those of well-known statesmen , militarists , scientist and artists , I can learn a lot from their life histories . 
 I like the novels of Dickens very much , I have reading almost all of them in Chinese translation , I wish i can reading them in the original . 
 Thank you . I never imagine that would happen . 
 Thank you . But I am not sure whether the manager is settling for it . She asked me to go to her office . 
 I feel nervous when I face Nova . 
 You know the sales figure shows that the prediction has not achieved . 
 I'm still nervous . I don't know what to say to the manager . I always feel ill in that kind of place . 
 Were you engaged in any activities at college ? 
 What kind of activity would make you get involved ? 
 By the way , where's Jim ? 
 I can't find my keys . 
 There was a serious disturbance in the street this morning . 
 Yes . The police have come . 
 Everything that came in off the fax machine last night is all on your desk . But I noticed that some of the faxes came through pretty blurred . Maybe you can take a look at them . If the copy is unreadable , I'll call them and ask them to relax . 
 What about that one ? 
 You know , I think the fax machine is out of toner , I can change the toner cartridge . That should solve the problem . 
 I guess the fax machine is out of paper , too . Don't worry , I'll have someone look at it this afternoon , and in the meantime , I'll have your documents re-faxed to our other fax machine . 
 Easy . View the home page of the company , and see if they need staff . Many websites offer two-way service , such as job-hunting and talent hunting . 
 21st Talent Website , 51 Job , and Zhaopin.com are most popular . 
 Yes , they notify me to work next week . 
 It is a pretty big mechanical company . I am assigned to work in the assembly shop . 
 My working hours aren ’ t fixed , sometimes I do the day shift , sometimes the night shift . In all , about 8 hours . 
 But it matches my major . 
 My wage depends on production results . 
 The company provides labor insurance for all employees , as well as fine retirement policy . 
 There is the company union , but it really shares the same aims as the management . 
 I will . 
 Hi . We'd like to open a Foreign Currency Account , please . 
 Yes , yes , we do . Right here . 
 We will go for the US dollar account . 
 Hi , Zina . I had a feeling you'd be stopping by . 
 Yes . 
 I know it . WebTracker is playing for keeps . They'll go for our jugular if we give them the chance . 
 Maybe . Maybe I will . 
 I've got it . 
 He asked me if I'd like to be a newspaper salesperson ? 
 Don't worry about that . He said I can do that at spare time . Anyway , it's just a part-time job . 
 It's a weekly newspaper named Olympic English . So I need to be here only on Sunday . 
 That's exactly what I am thinking about , And also it's a good way to get social experiences . 
 Let's do it together . 
 For what ? You have a telephone at home , don't you ? 
 I have some good news for you . We've decided we'd like to send you to Shanghai on a business trip this weekend . 
 Don't you think that it'd be a good thing for you to get out of the office foe a couple of days ? 
 I thought you'd be a bit more excited about this . Everything will be paid for and I'll send my assistant with you to take care of everything for you . All you have to do is to get on the train tonight at 7 pm . 
 Oh , no . We've bought your return ticket for you . I think you'll find it comfortable . 
 Oh no . the train hasn't been crowded at all recently . Besides , you're in first-class , so you'll be fine . 
 They've scheduled the negotiation meeting for 9 
 We've booked you a room in the same hotel as your meetings , so you won't need to deal much with the transportation system . 
 That's not a problem . Have a nap if you can . You don't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip . 
 I would like to book a table for six tonight . 
 What a pity . Can you recommend a nice restaurant near here ? 
 Honey . The cottages harmonize well with the landscape.That tourist resort is worth travelling to . 
 Do you have any shoes like these ? 
 Size five . 
 Black . 
 But my sister bought this pair last month . 
 No , she bought them in the U . S . 
 Can you get a pair for me please ? 
 They look very uncomfortable . 
 Can I collect unemployment benefits ? 
 My employer cut back on my hours . 
 Do I definitely get to collect unemployment ? 
 How do I check out my status to collect unemployment ? 
 How much will my unemployment check be ? 
 I see you just graduated from college . What was your GPA ? 
 Why do you think it wasn ’ t higher than that ? 
 Wo , wo , that certainly is a lot for a young man to take on . 
 Which glasses ? These glasses . 
 These ? 
 Here you are . 
 We hope that partial shipment is allowed . 
 Shipping the goods is to be made in three equal monthly installments . 
 The negotiation of the price has taken us a long time . I hope the following negotiation about quality will be quicker . 
 Don't worry . Our quality is based solely on our sales samples . 
 We are sure to responsible to replace the defective ones . 
 May I sit here ? 
 Oh , is it ? Thank you anyway . 
 Thank you . 
 No , I'm not . 
 No , I'm not . I'm going to look for an apartment . 
 I'm going to try to find a place near the office . 
 Out in the suburbs . It's a long trip to work every day . 
 I'm going to buy a newspaper and check the classified ads . 
 I know , but I'm going to enroll in a night school to take a course in business management .

 Okay . Our rental agent will be with you in a moment . 
 Right . Just take off your jacket and shirt . And lie down on that bed over there ... That's right ... Now , just hold up your right arm , will you ? ... Does this hurt ? 
 And this ? 
 And do you feel anything when I do this ? 
 And you don't feel any pain anywhere else ? In you legs , for example ? 
 Well , it's probably nothing serious.But I think we'd better have that shoulder X-rayed.We can't do the until the morning , though.So it'd be better if you stay in hospital for the night

 What water wagon ? 
 That ’ s my wagon . I need the water to water my flowers in the yard .

 What's the price for that suit ? 
 Well , I like everything about it except the price . 
 Excuse me , How do I get to the Grand hotel ?

 I know , Mr . Emory . I'm sorry . But I really need to see the doctor this afternoon . I feel dizzy and I can't concentrate on my work .

 No wonder his son is so clever .

 What else did she tell you ? Did she tell you how many miles there are on it ? 
 That's not bad . What about the price ? Did she tell you how much her friend wants for the car ? 
 Three thousand ! That's almost too good to be true . Did she say why her friend wants to sell it ? 
 Well , we can see it for ourselves . Did she tell you when we can go and look at it ? 
 It's very dark in here . Will you turn on the light ? 
 Then , turn on the lamp , please . 
 It's there by the window . 
 No , mom . Piano is for girls . 
 No way , mom . I don't like piano . 
 All right , all right . I understand . 
 I get along pretty well with most of them .

 No , you can take your time . Oh , I also want a manicure while I am having the perm . 
 Thank you . How much will this cost ? 
 Steven , we are preparing a martial arts show for the New Year's party . Would you like to join us ?

 No . You know , there are many schools and styles of kung fu . What we will perform is a set of Chinese shadow boxing . 
 Thank you for joining us ! Now let's see some pictures and know more about kung fu . 
 Is there any way you can cut us a better deal on your wholesale price for this order ? 
 Based on the estimate you gave us , by the time we figure in transportation and other expenses , our profit is short.With the offer you've given me , we're making next to nothing.Can ' t you do any better ? 
 I'll be honest with you , our budgeted cost can't exceed more than $ 150 per unit.That is our bottom line . If you can meet that price , you've got the deal.Otherwise ...

 how is your house hunting going ? 
 how much are you looking to spend ? 
 looks like you ’ re not going to get more than a bedroom in a shared flat with that . 
 well , if you want to live in London , you have to pay the price ! 
 I can ask around at work . Do you have a preference for makers or non-smokers ? 
 how long do you want to sign a contract for ? 
 do you need a furnished or unfurnished apartment ? 
 you know that you ’ ll have to pay utilities on top of the rent , right ? 
 it ’ s not usually included , so you ’ ll have to factor in about 100 pounds more each month for utilities . 
 don ’ t worry . Sometimes people will give you a discount if you promise to do the clearing or take care of the children . 
 Did your meal meet with your approval ? 
 How about a dessert to top off that wonderful meal ? 
 On this evening's dessert list , we have chocolate mousse cake , homemade fresh strawberry shortcake , and a spicy rum apple crisp . 
 One dessert will serve two , so would you like to split a second one ? 
 How about some coffee and tea as well ? 
 I will prepare your desserts and have someone bring you your drinks right away . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 What about jeans ? It's the fashion now . 
 Then , how about this ? 
 what can I do for you , sir ? 
 Fruit juice , cake and refreshments and everything . 
 Any serial , sir ? 
 And eggs ? 
 How do you want to your eggs ? 
 Anything more , sir ? 
 We will go to climb up the hill tomorrow . Let's go to supermarket to buy some food . 
 What should we buy ? 
 It is heavy and not convenient to take them to the top . 
 Good idea . We can buy some candy and nuts for children . 
 That's enough for the kids . Get some drinks . 
 Right . We should buy some yoghurt for kids . 
 OK . Four saucers . We can buy some custard tarts tomorrow morning . 
 I'd like to have a couple of complete sets of paper money and coins . 
 Ah , where can I find old paper money and coins used before and after 1949 ? 
 Good . Sorry to have troubled you so much , Miss . 
 No , thanks . I did not notice it has been dark outside . I think it is time to dinner . 
 Hey there , how are you doing ? 
 Well , I got laid off , and I ’ m looking for work . 
 Right now , I ’ ll take about anything that will pay the mortgage . 
 I went out on one interview , but I haven ’ t heard back from them . 
 You know , I saw that and it looks pretty good ! 
 Hi , I ’ d like a single room . 
 No , I ’ m afraid not . 
 How much is it ? 
 Okay , I ’ ll take it . 
 Okay.When is your restaurant open ? 
 Okay , thank you.Which way to the room ? 
 Thanks . 
 May I see some identification , sir , please ? 
 Thank you so much . Have you got a credit card , Mr . Sandals ? 
 Unfortunately , at the present time we take only MasterCard or VISA . 
 Thank you , sir . You'll be in room 507 , nonsmoking , with a queen-size bed . Do you approve , sir ? 
 That's great . This is your key , sir . If you need anything at all , anytime , just dial zero . 
 Does your boss pay you for the over-time work ? 
 He should know that this is against the Labor Law in our country . Legally , employees should get double pay if asked to do extra work during the weekend or on holidays . 
 I suggest that you go to the lawyers ' office to get some help . 
 Morgan , can I ask you a question ? 
 I was just wondering if many Chinese people take their leftover food home from a restaurant . 
 what happen to all the leftover food ? 
 that seems like an awful waste ! Why don't people order fewer dishes so that they don't have to throw so much away at the end of the meal ? 
 I guess that makes sense . I just think it would make more sense to take the leftovers home . 
 no , that's OK . You know what they say when in Rome ... 
 many people in my generation don't eat pig's feet , but my parents grew up eating them , so I think they are OK . 
 that's OK . I'll try anything once , but sometimes , once is enough ! 
 Yes , it is . Please put your luggage on the scale . 
 Oh , can I keep this little suitcase as hand-luggage ? 
 Here's your ticket and your boarding card . 
 I like this apartment . Do you think we can afford the mortgage ? 
 I love the balcony . We can sit outside and enjoy the sun in summer . We are on the 12th floor , so there ’ s very nice view from the balcony . 
 Yes , and there are many houses nearby . I like it that the neighbourhood isn ’ t full of apartment blocks . 
 Yes , it would . Don ’ t worry . There ’ s a lawn outside the building and there ’ s the park nearby . This place will be fine . 
 Yes , everything has been well designed . 
 Could we order later ? We have five persons altogether and 2 of us are still on the way . 
 Yes , thank you . 
 Wait a minute . I am really sorry but I can't find it now . 
 Maybe , what shall I do now ? 
 Well , I think that's the only thing I can do . 
 Yes , I'd like to make a deposit . 
 I prefer time deposit . 
 RIB deposit . 
 Yes . 
 Six months . 
 Here you are . 
 Thank you . 
 Of course , here is the catalogue and the price list . You can have a look . We also have many other kinds of carpets . 
 Of course we can . We can provide the quantity you ask for . 
 No problem . Let's check the terms of contract . 
 Here's the application form . 
 Thank you . Now if you'll just give me a credit card . 
 Thank you . 
 Which book ? Your cookbook ? 
 Isn ’ t it on the bookshelf ? 
 Then have you put it in the bedroom ? 
 Ok . Look ! It ’ s just near your foot . 
 Hey , how's it going ? 
 Not bad , thanks for asking . 
 Only about fifteen minutes . 
 Not really , I usually drive . 
 Yes , I do . 
 Once our President lowers gas prices , I'll be driving again . 
 I can't believe the way our landlord cheated us . 
 Long Distance . May I help you ? 
 No , sir . I'm afraid not .

 What ’ s going to be covered in the orientation ? 
 Quite a lot . All them one afternoon ? 
 It is ok with me . I enjoy being busy and learning new things . 
 Yes , sir.how can I help you ? 
 You would need to speak to Ms.Stevens . 
 One moment , please , and I will connect your call . 
 Here you go . 
 Cancelled ! So what am I supposed to do now ? 
 What's my other option ? 
 That's fine . I'll do that then .

 Look at my cell phone . I can listen to music , watch movies , take pictures , play games , surf the web and download documents . It's just like a PAD . 
 That's Ok . you know , digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry , and they won't cost you too much . 
 That's right . what's the flash memory of your old mp3 ? 
 Then any cell phone can meet your need because they generally have memories of over 512MB .

 Certainly , I'll be very happy to help you . Usually we offer current or fixed accounts for individuals .

 OK . Do you have your ID card on you ? 
 Good . Everything is done . Here is your deposit book and ID card . 
 It's my pleasure . 
 Nah , I just check my weight , I'm getting fatter . 
 I'll get you for that comments , George . 
 ah , I don't know a fit works . Last time , all I saw the gym were bunch of lidos , like me . 
 All right . But so help me it better work . 
 Not me . I'm too hot and I'm too tired . 
 Well , that's not for me . 
 Get out of it ! It wasn't as good as you think . 
 Wow , the ferris wheel over there is so big . I'd like to take a ride on it . 
 Look at your right-hand . Is it the zone of the Lost Maya Kingdom ? 
 I want to have a try later . 
 Wow , that's my favorite . It's like a superman shooting right up into the sky . 
 Of course . After this , I want to show you to the Haunted House . 
 Bingo ! 
 John ? I have to say I was bothered by the way you handled the meeting today . 
 I think it would have been better if you had given us more of a chance to give our opinions . 
 Hotel front desk . 
 For what time ? 
 What did you get for lunch today ? 
 Where'd you get your food from ? 
 What sandwich did you order ? 
 Was it any good ? 
 I ordered a sandwich there before . 
 Yeah , and they messed my order up too . 
 Do you like shopping ? 
 Why don't you do your shopping at home ? 
 I mean you can buy things through the Internet , that is E-commerce . 
 Good afternoon , sir , is there anything I can help you with today ? 
 Well , I would be happy to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for her . Is there anything particular that you have in mind ? 
 Well , you can give her a set of pearl earrings , or this beautiful heart-shaped pendant . What is her favorite gemstone ? 
 Don ’ t worry , we specialize in providing our customers a relaxed , pressure-free shopping environment . That stone is an amethyst . We have a range of beautiful amethyst pieces . Take a look at this bracelet . It ’ s 18K rose-gold , studded with amethyst and blue topaz . It ’ s a great statement piece . 
 We have this beautiful platinum pendant , or you could also get her a locket . You could also get her a timepiece — it ’ s both glamorous yet functional.If you tell me a little more about your girlfriend , maybe I can help you find something for her . 
 Perhaps you could give her a ring ? 
 Well sir , I believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose ! 
 Fabulous ! We should look at engagement rings then ! Now that ’ s a whole other section . 
 I am reading the book on patent and I think it will be helpful for my work 
 Yep ! I heard that your company is registering a new trademark . 
 I just read this in the whole afternoon . Let me show you . 
 The purpose of the law is to protect and encourage inventions and to promote the development of science and technology . The law came into effect in 1984 , and it consists of 8 chapters with 69 articles . 
 Foreign companies should appoint a patent agency , which is designated by our government to act as his patent agent . This task is usually taken by the Patent Agent Department . 
 15 years . 
 Right , drink as much as you can . 
 Yes . Go straight ahead till you come to the traffic lights , turn left there and it's the first turning on the right . 
 That's it . It'll take you about five minutes . 
 I really want to go to China for vacation , but I can ’ t find a cheap plane ticket . 
 No , not yet . Can you find a good price there ? 
 Well , you don ’ t have to be mean . How do I do it ? 
 O . K . Thanks . I ’ ll let you know what I find . 
 I ’ ll look for a ticket for you , too . 
 Well , I am always energetic and enthusiastic . That's my strongest personality . 
 Em , as I have said , I'm diligent and industrious . On the other hand , sometimes I'm too hard-working and I put myself under too much pressure to make things perfect . 
 To work in a team , in my opinion , two characteristics are necessary for a person . That is , the person must be cooperative and aggressive . 
 I like playing games and having sports . They are my favourite hobbies . 
 Oh , it's hard to narrow it down to just one . I mean , I like all kinds of sports , basketball , swimming , bike riding and so on . Maybe it is just the reason why I am so energetic and vigorous . 
 Please put you name and address here . May I see your passport ? 
 How would you like it ? 
 OK . Here you are . 
 cool down , Harry ! What are you really mad about ? Did you get ripped off ? 
 is that so ? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . It's the norm of free trade . The seller sets a preposterous price , and the buyer tries his best to bring it down , until a compromise is reached . Yet you ignored the process . No wonder you ended up easy prey . 
 of course , that's something really irritating . And the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . I recommend you to consult the price tags in the supermarket first . And then you may negotiate for a fair deal . 
 Sure , we have several different styles you may choose . How high of a heel do you want ? 
 In that case , I might have just the pair for you . Look at these , they were made in Italy , the leather is very soft , so your toes will not get pinched . You can tell just by looking at it that it was superbly made . 
 Yes , we do , we also have this same style in dark blue and red . 
 Let me go to the back and get them . I'll be right back . 
 Brad , it's her birthday . Let's get her something really special . 
 I mean beautiful and heartfelt-something that will make her cry . 
 Women like that kind of thing , beautiful thoughts that are touching . 
 Okay , you get your funny one and I'll get my beautiful one . 
 Yes , please . We ’ re on my way out . You can put up make up sign on . Could you bring us some towels and hangers . 
 What would my new duties be ? 
 Will I have the chance to take business trip abroad once in a while ? 
 How many rooms are you looking for ? 
 150 a month . 
 May I know how long will it take to get some more in from the factory ? 
 When will you be able to deliver ? 
 When can I have your firm C . I . F . prices , that is to say , the final offer , Mr . London ? 
 Yes . I ’ ll be here tomorrow morning at 10 . 
 I don ’ t need that long to make up my mind . If your prices are agreeable and if I can get the commission I want , I can place the order right away . 
 I ’ m glad to hear that . As I ’ Ve just said , I hope to conclude some substantial business with you . 
 I ’ m buying for chain department stores in Canada . They are also interested in Egyptian carpets . Could you introduce me to the person in charge of this line ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 No , I haven't been registered . 
 I'm a medical case . 
 Yes , here you are . 
 The doctor told me to stay about one month . 
 Well , when they leave the hospital , give me a call and I'll come back . 
 Hey , Mr Brown . How are you ? Look at that smile on your face ! 
 That's what we like to hear , a profitable business . 
 So , what can I do for you today ? Are you needing to withdraw or transfer ? 
 Oh , domestic things ? Yes , of course , we can help you with that . 
 It sure was . I couldn't eat another bite . 
 You're right . I have to get up early to go to work tomorrow . 
 Don't worry about it . Tonight is my treat . 
 No , I insist . I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't . 
 Alright , if that's the way you are going to be , we'll split the bill . 
 Just promise you will let me treat you to dinner next week , ok ? 
 Great . Bye . 
 How can we get in touch with you ? 
 About one week . 
 Does your company have a large population ? 
 Do you have more than 200 employees in the company ? 
 Good morning . What can I do for you ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . This room is at the end of the corridor . It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when everything is quiet . 
 I'm awfully sorry , Miss . I do apologize . We'll manage it , but we don't have any spare room today . Could you wait till tomorrow ? A tour company will be leaving tomorrow morning . There'll be some rooms for you to choose from . 
 Be sure . And if there is anything more you need , please let us know . 
 You're welcome . I hope you'll be more comfortable in your new room . 
 Yes , I'd like a cheeseburger and a large order of French fries . 
 Yes , a medium Coke . 
 Yes . 
 To go , please . ( The attendant hands the customer his order . ) 
 Excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the school clinic ? I've lost my way . 
 Straight ahead to the traffic lights , left and then right . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Good morning , this is Jane . This is Apple Co . Ltd . 
 Yes , this is . May I help you ? 
 Oh , the results have come out , and I can tell you ... Yes , I find your name . You are hired . Congratulations ! 
 Next Monday morning . 
 Your starting salary is 2500 yuan a month , and after you become a permanent employee , it will be higher . 
 See you ! 
 I'd like to rent a car , please . 
 Full-size , please . What's the rate ? 
 And I'd like to have insurance just in case . 
 No . 
 All right . I'll take it . 
 How about this one ? 
 Just one day . 
 Is the international driving licence fine ? 
 Did you hear who won the election ? 
 McCain is our new President . 
 I ’ m not happy about it , either . 
 I guess the people wanted him as our new leader . 
 I have to tell you something else that you probably won ’ t like . 
 I wasn ’ t serious , because Obama got elected . 
 I just got a call from Mrs . Fitzgerald . See what your Willie has just done . 
 Because he takes after you , he's got into trouble again . 
 That was last time . This time it's worse . 
 Well , he was playing baseball with some friends ... 
 True , but that's not all . The ball went through the window and hit the vase she has in her front window ... 
 And then , ricocheted off her fish bowl . Mrs . Fitzgerald at the last minute dived and saved her fish . 
 Stop interrupting me . Finally , the ball flew through the air and knocked out Willie's school principal , who was having a cup of coffee with Mrs . Fitzgerald . 
 Wow ! They've got everything here . All the world's famous brands . Aunt Cindy , what is your favorite brand ? 
 Oh , that's a very expensive brand , but with good reason . 
 I see . Come here . The high heels here look really attractive . But I wonder whether it's comfortable to wear any of them ? 
 It's not a simple thing to be beautiful . 
 Yeah , very tasteful . And with them , you look even more fashionable . Oh , there are so many French perfumers . Oops , perfumes for guys ? So strange ! 
 Oh , really , that's really something new . I'm afraid not everyone can accept it . 
 That's true . Well , it's obvious that fashion is not a cheap thing . So , do you spend all your money on it ? 
 How is it that you are my mom's sis ? You two are so different . She always picks up bargains and spends more than she earns . You do so much better than her . 
 Is Bob home ? 
 Would you please weigh this letter to see what the postage is ? 
 By ordinary air mail , please . 
 A postal order for four hundred dollars . 
 Will I be informed when my friend gets the letter ? 
 All right , I'll have it registered , then . 
 Why ? 
 I realize that but I needed to make a decision . 
 Yes , sir . Can I help you ? 
 Medium rare , that ’ s right , sir . I remember your order . 
 If it is not to your satisfaction , I ’ ll certainly bring you another . But I ’ m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes . 
 Employees in this company have to have a good command of English . Do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken English ?

 You must be very busy these days . I heard you are responsible for the meeting arrangements this time . It can be the most important meeting for our company this year . 
 Do we still use the conference room in the same hotel as last time ? You remember ? I like that one . 
 Good preparation will improve the effectiveness of the meeting . I am sure that your hard work will pay off . 
 Sure . Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality . 
 To begin with , I have to use chopsticks . 
 Certainly . After all , I've been here for two years . It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils . Though , I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Chinese dinner table . 
 Anything strange about that ? 
 Oh , sorry ! There's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks . 
 Yeah , we were classmates when I was in university . 
 Sure , if I can

 Anything else ? 
 OK . Wait for a moment , please . I'll be back in a moment with the dishes .

 I have seen this cheaper in other places . 
 Could you give us a detailed description of the properties of your product ? 
 Could you tell me more about it ? 
 Can you introduce its price level to me ? 
 We need the best possible quality . 
 I see , that's what I will order . 
 Hi , Lily ! How is everything ? 
 I ’ m sorry to hear that.Take care of yourself . 
 Tom , it's time for you to take a shower . 
 Why ? You can't be always so lazy . 
 Alright . But you promise this is the last time . 
 What are you doing ? 
 Are there any good programs on TV ? 
 Which Channel is it ? 
 It doesn't seem quite interesting . Would you change the channel ? 
 Yes , sir.When do you want to leave here ?

 That would be great ! How about 2:30 ? 
 Better late than never . 
 That's perfectly all right . 
 It's really of nothing . 
 That's quite all right . 
 I have a little experience . I guided a few foreign tourists around Beijing last year as a part-time job . I showed them to the Great Wall , the Imperial Palace , and the Summer Palace . 
 Yes , I know . A friend of mine is a guide . He talked with me about his work , but I don't mind working hard . 
 No , this is my first . 
 I'd like to be an overseas tour guide someday . Would there ever be any chance of that ? 
 Yes . When can I get the decision ? I hope you can give me a definite answer as soon as possible . If I'd turned down , I ll have to secure a position elsewhere . 
 Thank you . Good-bye . 
 I think these patterns are quite good . Can you give me a price indication of these ? 
 Thank you very much . If your price is suitable , then we can make further discussion of contract . 
 Very good . How many goods do you have ? 
 We want to order 900 dozen . 
 What are we going to eat for dinner ? 
 I didn't plan on cooking tonight . 
 I don't know what to make . 
 I've been craving chicken and potatoes .

 Okay , I guess I'll cook .

 Did you know there was a blackout last night ?

 They took advantage of the blackout . 
 Yes , apparently four stores were broken into . 
 There was no evidence of who did it . 
 How far is this address from here , please ? 
 So how long does it take ? 
 Hello ! 
 This is Doris . Who's calling please ? 
 Oh , I almost forgot . Thank you for calling to remind me . Actually . I do need to change the time of my appointment . I have a scheduling conflict . And I can't make it that early . 
 It would have to be after lunch . Do you have anything available about 2 o'clock ? 
 That ’ s alright , . I think I should be able to make it at one fifteen . Can you put me down for that time slot ? 
 Wonderful . Thanks very much . 
 Take the No . 7 bus . There's a bus stop just over there . 
 Yes . No need to change . 
 I want to file a complaint . 
 A man robbed me today . 
 I was robbed this morning . 
 He took my phone and my wallet . 
 I saw him perfectly . 
 I could do that . 
 Yes , is there any vacant room for tomorrow ? 
 Well , is there any other hotel nearby ? 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , it is . Which department for ? 
 What's your problem then ? 
 OK , I will register you with medical department . 
 Yes . Just go there ! 
 It's on the second floor . Have you got your records ? 
 OK , here is your registration card . 
 I sure am . How about you ? 
 Do you know where your polling place is ? 
 Oh , really ? 
 I ’ m not sure . 
 I didn ’ t receive my polling place in the mail . 
 I didn ’ t know that . I ’ ll go look right now . 
 No , I'm proficient in both written and spoken English , but I can only carry on a simple conversation in French . 
 My mother is an English teacher in a college , so I began learning English when I could speak , and I took English as my minor subject at university .

 Oh , yes.Erm , well , could you tell me your name , please ? 
 Oh , yes.Erm , well , what exactly is it that interests you about the job ?

 I'm afraid I lost my ticket . Can I buy one again now ? 
 I'm going to New York . 
 In Chicago . 
 I'm afraid I don ’ t . 
 Yes , may I know your name ? 
 The NASDAQ gained a few points today . 
 It's hard to say . The stock market is weird . You never know what will happen tomorrow . 
 It's a kind of investment . If I choose a good stock and hold it long enough , I can get good returns . 
 I think something must be done . 
 I agree with you . Only in this way can we ease the traffic problems . 
 How about this one ? 
 It doesn't matter , sir . Shoes will stretch a bit with use . 
 Have you applied for you visa to go to study in the united states yet ? 
 Good luck ! I ’ Ve heard it ’ s very difficult to get a visa to go to the united states . 
 What kind of documents did you need to present ? 
 Why do you think so many people have their applications rejected ? 
 Why are they stricter with Chinese people than with other nationalities ? 
 hello . How was the marketing meeting ? 
 I ’ m surprised to hear that . I thought you had some very good suggestions . 
 so what happened in the meeting ? 
 I wonder why not . We could always revise the suggestions , to take into account any objections . 
 may I make a suggestion ? 
 Is there a chance you could contact the client confidentially and see what they think ? If they like your ideas , perhaps they could put them forward as their own proposals . You won ’ t get credit for ide 
 go on . Take a chance . You could just hint at your idea . The client should be smart enough to take a hint . 
 I'm glad you liked it . Are you ready for dessert ? 
 I made strawberry shortcake . 
 Great . Would you like coffee or tea with that ? 
 do you take cream or sugar with your tea ? 
 definitely . Would you like skim or whole milk ? 
 what happened ? 
 I'll go with you . Where is she ? 
 is she alright ? 
 don't worry . Family comes first . Come on , let's go . 
 ok . Just call me if you need anything then . 
 Do you think chinese families have changed much in the last 50 years ? 
 What do you think is the biggest change ? 
 That's true . You know , some husbands and wives don't even live in the same city any more . 
 I guess I'm a bit old-fashioned . I'd rather have my parents live with me than live in a retirement room . 
 How about your other siblings ? Do they spend a lot of time with your parents ? 
 I see . Do your parents ever ask you to come home to visit them more often ?

 You mean you haven't arranged any car . 
 Here , I'll take a taxi instead.How do you refund us ? 
 80 yuan . 
 It's a bit . But I can give you a discount . 
 No . I'm afraid the price is too low . 
 I'm sorry , but I think you should give me no less than 65 yuan .

 Yes , you will lose interest . I see that you have a 5 - year C / D with us . I'm sorry to tell you that would mean losing 6 months of interest as a penalty for withdrawing before maturity .

 I wonder if you could help me find something for my daughter . 
 I think that would be perfect . 
 In fact , she prefers Macs . How much is one ? 
 She's going to be so happy . Let me have one . 
 I'll pay for it with my VISA . 
 Are there any extras that she needs ? 
 You've been so helpful . Thank you . 
 Linda , it's really late . Let's call it a day . 
 Sure thing . Do you want me to give you a ride home ? 
 Don't mention it . It ’ s my pleasure . 
 That was really a nightmare ! 
 I was stuck between 15th and 16th floors in the elevator . 
 I pressed the emergency button ! And then I stayed in the elevator waiting for the rescue . 
 A little bit , but I know that the elevator isn't enclosed . at least I wouldn't be smothered there . 
 Of course , there are 6 other people in the elevator ; they were so scared that someone even started crying . 
 Yes . I have to call the property management . 
 Yes . They should check the elevator regularly . I have to give them something to remember about , and they should also equip fire extinguishers in the building . 
 I know what you mean , but I'd better remind them again , and also remind them to repair the button in the elevator for the disabled people . That has brought the disabled people lots of inconvenience . 
 I'm afraid I can't . 
 Well , my car won't start . I don't know what's the matter with it . 
 No , I don't think it could be . I checked the battery two days ago . It must be other problems . 
 No , there is plenty of gas . I filled it up yesterday . 
 Yes , that's possible . 
 Would you tell me the nature of the problem , sir ? 
 Perhaps you saw a silverfish , sir . 
 Sir , you haven't been drinking by any chance , have you ? 
 Forgive me . You're 100 percent correct . Allow me to transfer you to my supervisor . 
 I'm just comparing prices . 
 But they don't let you have goods on approval . 
 Hi , Susan . What can I do for you ? 
 Let me take a look . Just a second . That ’ s no problem , Susan . See you on Wednesday . 
 I know , but I am really sick . 
 I understand , sir . I ’ ll bring a doctor ’ s note in tomorrow . I am sorry , Mr . Thomas 
 Yes . I ’ m interested in a job your company posted on the Internet . 
 It is a position in your Maintenance Department . Is it available ? 
 I have no experience but I ’ m interested in it . 
 I don ’ t have my resume with me , but I will send you a copy immediately . Can I fill out the application form right now ? 
 Thanks . 
 Hello , I need to get a cab . 
 That's fine . 
 Hi , Bob . I heard that you had passed your driving test . Is it true ? 
 Is the driving test difficult ? 
 What does the driving test require ? 
 Oh , I see . I need more practice before I take the driving test . 
 Hopeful ! Thank you . 
 What's that ? 
 That's easy . Everyone knows that there are nice . 
 Nice try . I wasn't born yesterday , you know . 
 That sounds crazy . They can't just change their mind about things like that . 
 I suppose you're right . They also used to think that they were so important that the sun revolved around them , not the other way around . 
 Do you think that we'll one day be able to travel to another planet for a vacation ? 
 Do you think we'll ever get to meet an alien from outer space ? 
 You're so old-fashioned . That's what people used to think about people from another country ! 
 I'm planning on going to the market soon . 
 I don't know what we need . 
 I'll make a list . 
 Okay , do we need any meat ? 
 What else do we need ? 
 What's the problem ? 
 I really didn't see it . 
 I only saw bushes at the intersection . 
 I really didn't mean to run it . 
 Are you still going to write me a ticket ? 
 Thanks for being so understanding . 
 I think I'll get some new goggles . 
 We also need some sunscreen . What about beach towels ? 
 I think I'll get a hat , too . 
 Okay , I guess that's it . Let's go pay for this stuff .

 This is Lucy White . Thank you . Bye . 
 I want to rent this car for 5 days . 
 By the way , do I have to return the car here ?

 Do you buy that newspaper every day ? 
 Is there a Sunday edition of that newspaper ? 
 What section does it have ? 
 What ’ s in that section ? 
 I buy a national newspaper sometimes , buy I nearly always buy a local evening newspaper . I find the local news more interesting than national or international news . 
 I can help you with that . Just have a seat and roll up your left sleeve .

 That's not fair . We had fun . Give me a second chance . Can we meet tomorrow night for drinks at the pub ? 
 But Anne ... 
 We try to recycle as much as we can . 
 We have to send it to landfill . It's very expensive because the government recently introduced a landfill tax so we're planning to build a new incineration plant next year to burn our waste . 
 Yes , you're right , it does . But we believe it's less harmful to the environment than landfill 
 Yes , madam . May I help you ?

 OK , I am sorry for that . We will arrange another one for you . 
 no , but I'm pretty good at eating ! 
 well , to be honest with you , Chinese food is really different from western food . 
 I'm not really used to it yet . 
 like most foreigners , I really like Sweet and Sour Pork and Kung Pao Chicken . I eat them almost every day . 
 I tried once , but they are quite difficult to eat with chopsticks . 
 that's good to know . I'd like to try more Chinese food , but since I can't read any of the menus in the restaurants near my home , it's difficult to try new food . 
 that would be great . I really only want to taste real Chinese food , not just the food that foreigners like to eat ! 
 I heard you want to apply for the position as a foreign bank staff member , is it true ? 
 What about the foreign bank ? 
 What are the requirements ?

 Yes . Now what other problems do you have ? 
 Well , I ’ m glad that everything else is to your liking .

 Rudy Randolph , 818-555-1234 , April 9 through 15 . 
 Thank you . I'm glad that wasn't too much of a bother . 
 My computer isn't working . 
 I'm trying to turn it on , but it won't work . 
 Which ones are you referring to ? 
 Is that why it won't turn on ? 
 I did not know that . 
 I'm going to do that . 
 Do you have any other questions ?

 Hi Julie . Yeah . I've been on a diet for a couple of months now . 
 Thanks for noticing . 
 I joined a health club and my trainer gave me tips on eating . With a combination of eating better and exercising , I managed to lose 15 pounds in 2 months . 
 Mostly on how to exercise , but the best advice I got was changing my eating habits . Instead of eating 3 times a day , she told me to eat 5 times a day . 
 Actually , I'm eating the same amount . I eat 5 smaller meals a day . Basically , it naturally speeds up the metabolism and helps to burn fat at a faster rate . 
 You don't need to lose weight . 
 Ah ... but remember to incorporate a little exercise into your diet . 
 No problem . 
 Well you have to try Peking duck . 
 Ok , you could try the Peking wonton then . 
 Actually , I know a great restaurant in Dongcheng . 
 Hello ! This is Air China Booking Office . 
 May I know your flight number , please ? 
 Oh , yes . That's our regular flight to Nanchang . Would you please tell me your name ? 
 Yes , here you are . You're flying in economy class . Is that right ? 
 Let me check . Now , your ticket is in order . Thank you for calling to reconfirm . 
 Quite right . If you don't confirm , the reservation will be cancelled 72 hours before the departure time . In order not to miss your flight , I think you should pick up your ticket as early as possible . 
 Good morning , is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Yes , what size do you want ? 
 No problem . Come and get your picture on Friday . 
 Where are you heading , sir ? 
 What's your flight time ? 
 I guess we should get there no later than 7:00 . 
 Well , since it's rush hour , I'd say the ride would take about thirty minutes , more or less.Is that okay ? 
 Okay , now I ’ d like to find out more about your last job . I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly , is that right ? 
 So , what changed ? 
 Wow , a real step up ! 
 I see , so why did you decide to leave finally ? 
 Mom , look ! My first piggy bank and it still has money in it ! 
 Remember when I used to beg you to break it so I could go buy ice cream ? 
 Thanks for not giving in to my childhood tantrums , mom . 
 I think I'm going to keep it as a monument to what I've learned about money . 
 I ’ m hungry , let ’ s grab a bite to eat . 
 Nah ! Let ’ s go get a burger and fries . 
 What are you talking about ? I have salads some times . 
 Fine ! I ’ ll start drinking and having home cooked meals that are low in fat . Are you happy now ? 
 What can I do for you , madam ? 
 How about this one ? 
 They're three hundred dollars . 
 OK , This one is one hundred and twenty . It's the cheapest here . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Good evening . I'll have a Scotch . 
 On the rocks , please . 
 Is that difficult ? 
 That's all right . What can I do ? 
 Well . I can do it . And then ? 
 Who will pay for these things ? 
 OK . I will go in no time . 
 How much would you like to borrow ? 
 Let me check with our credit manager . ( later ) Our record shows that your credit rating is quite high . I don't think you'll have any problems . 
 Our monthly interest is 1.5 % of the outstanding balance . Would you please fill out this application form ? 
 Thanks ! We love it . 
 I ’ m just not looking forward to cleaning it ! 
 Oh , great . Where was it ? 
 What was it doing there ? 
 You mean Johnny threw out all the dinnerware ? 
 I ’ ll show you around and explain the operation as we go along . 
 That is our office block . We have all the administrative depart - ments there . Down there is the research and development section . 
 About 3-4 % of the gross sales . 
 That ’ s the warehouse . We keep a stock of the faster moving items so that urgent orders can be met quickly from stock . 
 It would largely depend on the size of the order and the items you want . 
 Well , since you have order the roast chicken . I suggest you to order the red wine to go with the main course . It can help you digest the food . 
 I think whiskey will be a good choice . 
 Yes , I really want to know about the housing system in your company . 
 I also want to know if there's a holiday at your company , for I must visit my parents every year . 
 No , thanks . 
 Yes , that's right , around five nine five ten . 
 I'm not sure . Medium , I suppose . Maybe a little on the heavy side . 
 No , I don't think so . 
 No . 
 Black or dark brown . 
 Straight , I think , and about average length . 
 Well , he had a jacked or a plage shirt . You know the kind of number jack wear . 
 Dark , maybe dark blue maybe black . I'm not sure . 
 Boots 
 No , hiking boots . Brown ones . 
 Now I want you to look some pictures . 
 Good morning , Mrs Smith . 
 Yes , thank you . 
 In the first academic year we learned Principles of Accounting , and in the following years we learned Cost Accounting , Commercial Accounting , Industrial Accounting , and Management Accounting . 
 No , we haven't taken such a course , but we have taken a more specialized course for decision making , by the name of Forecasting and Decision-Making . 
 I forgot to include my experience as an accountant in my resume . In fact , I took a part-time job as an accountant at the Atlantic Trading Company during my second and third school year . I worked three evenings a week there and I did quite well . Here is the recommendation . 
 No problem . The professional English course is just English for Accounting . Moreover , as you know , the Atlantic Trading Company is a Sino-Australian joint venture . When I served part-time there , I became well acquainted with accounting operated in English . 
 I have a relative working as a manager in your manufacturing department . Her name is Lilling . She told me a lot about your company and I became quite interested . I believe I can have a promising career with the development of this company . 
 No , can you tell me about it ? 
 I have passed the five courses required by the Chinese CPA Association , but the certificate won't come to hand until next month . How about that ? 
 Thank you , Mrs Smith . It is really a pleasure talking with you . 
 Thank you . Good-bye . 
 I'd like to eat a bowl of dumplings . 
 Yes . But I prefer a bit salty soup . 
 Egg soup is OK . 
 I'd like a bottle of juice . 
 My goodness ! My silk dress is shrunk . How did you wash it ? 
 It should be handwashed with cold water . It's a common sense . Don't you know it ? 
 That's all right . Please ask me if you don't know how to do something next time . You can keep the silk dress if you don't mind . I think it fits you . 
 When do you go to bed usually ? 
 That's helpful for your health . 
 You are from Japan , aren't you ? 
 I love Japan a lot . 
 Let's go to another place where my friend is working , let me pay here . 
 Oh , I must be going now ; it was nice talking with you . 
 500 US dollars . 
 You had champagne for the girl . 
 No , I haven't . What's going on ? 
 Yes . The lights were out all night . 
 What do you mean ? 
 People went out and looted ? 
 Did the police find who did it ? 
 I hope we don't have any more blackouts . 
 Here you are . 
 Yes , I think so . The suit matches the trousers . 
 Excuse me . 
 Could I have one more blanket ? 
 OK . I will . 
 Would you , please ? Thank you . 
 This hotel has no full-size pool , but we do have swim stations in our gym . 
 You swim in a swim station just like you run on a treadmill . 
 The swim stations are available to all guests for no charge . 
 They're available anytime between 7 a . m . and 10 p . m . , seven days a week . 
 The swim stations are very popular , sir . I hope you don't find a line down there . 
 That was a cake walk.It ’ s nothing to speak of . 
 It should be 3 
 That's right . Welcome to Great Britain . 
 Um . Ten ? 
 I know , but it wasn ’ t my fault ! I told Jennifer she had to drop me off before ten , but she wouldn ’ t leave the party ! 
 Mom ! That is so unfair ! 
 What ! For being a couple of hours late ? You have to be kidding ! 
 See how many people are here ! 
 Other than the employees , our boss Jack invited some friends of the company . 
 Of course not ! We have to sit at our assigned seats . I think our table is over there in the back . 
 Look who you get to sit next to--Tim from purchasing ! 
 Don't worry . I'm also sitting next to you . 
 I can't wait until we get our year-end bonus ! 
 You got our email with all the specifications for the project . We'll be accepting bids untill noon on Tuesday . If you have any questions between now and then , please let me know . 
 I understand . But unfortunately , it is our policy not to disclose our bottom line . You can be assured that price is a weighty consideration when we review the proposals . We also consider other elements , including design and practicality . We also give weight to the reputation of the submitting company . 
 We're just looking for a reasonable price according to the specifications in our project blueprint . That's all I can say . 
 Well , I love it . The room is special and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . There are plants along the corridor . Especially , I got my own desk with computer and telephone . Such a great place ! 
 What was so bad about it ? 
 Sounds bad ! Lucky you ! You didn ’ t take that job . I think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently . 
 John , do you have a minute ? 
 Well , I ’ Ve been meaning to talk to you about the situation in the office . 
 That ’ s exactly what I ’ m getting at . We ’ re supposed to be able to do our preparation and marking in that office , but have you noticed ? Jack constantly has students coming in to get help with his course . A lot people are going in and out . 
 No , not yet , but someone ’ s going to have to . 
 No , of course not . But I ’ m not able to do my work and neither are you . 
 Oh , that would be too small . 
 Come to think of it , you may be on to something . Let ’ s go have a look . 
 Ok , let ’ s go through this one more time . I don ’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses ! 
 Right . You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . For example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . Also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing . 
 Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick . 
 No ! Since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes . 
 Why am I being arrested ? 
 I don't have a warrant . 
 I don't know what a bench warrant is . 
 I was never told to go to court . 
 This isn't fair . 
 What about my rights ? 
 Alright , tell me what you think about this one . 
 Yeah , maybe you're right . How about this outfit ? 
 No , I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just want to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It's casual , yet sophisticated . 
 How about this scarf , these earrings , and an anklet ? 
 That's a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense . 
 Yep . Here it is . What do you think ? 
 The leopard print sounds fabulous . OK , I'll take it . 
 Cindy ’ s husband is Ron . 
 They have two children-one son and one daughter-as well as one daughter-in-law and one son-in-law . 
 Yes , they have three grandchildren-one girl and two boys . 
 Yes , she gets along with them quite well . 
 Their family is very similar to Cindy and Ron ’ s family . 
 They are responsibility , skill , patience , quietness , and so on . 
 Aspirin . 
 Certainly . Can I have the name please ? 
 Ok , Are you checking out tomorrow ? 
 Will you need a wake up call , sir ? 
 Ok then , your room is 502 on the fifth floor . Breakfast is served between 6.30 am and 9am . Enjoy your stay . 
 Hello , is John in ? 
 Yes , would you leave him a message to call me ? 
 What can I do for you today ? 
 Do you remember where you got it ? 
 Counterfeit notes these days can be very sophisticated and difficult to spot with the naked eye . But I must warn you that if it does show to be a counterfeit I have no option but to confiscate it . 
 The machine shows it to be counterfeit . You'll need to fill in this form and I'll give you a receipt to show the money has been confiscated . 
 So do I ! 
 No , it's too expensive for me . I've decided to take some exercises on my own . 
 Run around the track . In the morning I run for an hour , and in the afternoon I run around the building . 
 I hope so . Would you like to join me ? 
 Yesterday I read hamlet.such a fantastic book ! 
 I do agree with you . 
 My tooth is killing me ! 
 It just started hurting me last night . 
 I think one of my fillings might be coming loose . 
 I have an electric toothbrush . 
 Oh yeah , when I do that , it hurts a lot more ! 
 well , first of all , it ’ s much bigger . It has the same number of rooms , but each room is larger . We also have a larger garden , which our dog loves , of course ! 
 yes . One bedroom is for my wife and i . there ’ s another for our daughter . My wife wants to use the third one as a guest room , but I ’ d like to make it into a study . Our daughter is also keen on 
 that ’ s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . The kitchen and dining room are together . It ’ s really large . 
 yes , they are . That ’ s very important to us . We like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . Each room has large windows . 
 no , we don ’ t . we wish we had one . That ’ s the only thing we wanted , but don ’ t have . The area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly . 
 it ’ s a very quiet neighbourhood . There ’ s some traffic , but not much . It ’ s not very difficult to get to the city centre , but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or yo 
 Well , I ’ ll be glad to help you out . We can deliver what you need to your office . 
 We definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit . 
 I can't seem to find the cereal aisle . 
 What breakfast foods ? 
 Oh , I think I know what you're talking about . 
 Could you tell me where the dishwashing detergent is ? 
 Oh , I didn't think of that . 
 Well , thank you very much . 
 Excuse me , Mr . Li . I have something to discuss with you . 
 I would really appreciate it if we could talk for a few minutes now . It's about the overtime you've asked me to put in . 
 I really can't work overtime . Because my husband has been ill recently , I must take care of him . 
 Waiter , can I have the bill please ? 
 We'd prefer separate checks . 
 The dinner is really rich . 
 I like the soy sauce chicken . 
 Hi , I Want a room , please . 
 A double room for my wife and me , please . 
 I haven't taken it yet . 
 I study every night . 
 Does it cost money ? 
 Does the test cover everything in the manual ? 
 Did you pass the test your first try ? 
 Wish me luck . 
 Good evening , Mr . Smith , What can I do for you ? 
 Yes , Mr . Smith , when would you like us to call you tomorrow morning ? 
 That's right . 
 OK . Good night , Mr . Smith , Have a good sleep . 
 John ? Can you come over here for a second ? 
 I need you to take a look at these samples . I think there are a few problems . 
 What's the matter with me , Doctor ? I feel so tired these days . 
 And what's the cause of that ? 
 But I can't just slow down . 
 You mean I've got to lose weight ? 
 Would you like me to type it for you ? 
 Not at all . I ’ ll be glad to do it . 
 Shall I write out again first ? 
 Can I print it ?

 Just to the bottom of my ears . By the way , I'd like a shave , too . 
 How much is it ? 
 Here you are . Thank you and goodbye . 
 Well , I'm glad I had a chance to see these samples , but I'm really not in a position to make a decision right now . 
 Yeah , why don't you do that , and then you can give me a call sometime next week . 
 Hi ! Do you know what's for dinner ? I'm starving ! 
 Out ? What do you mean out ? 
 Dad and Mom ? 
 You mean this is going to be a regular thing ? 
 Has anyone told you about Jessica's party coming up ? 
 Is that right ? I already got my invitation from her earlier . 
 Are you even going to go ? 
 Exactly , it seems like it's going to be loads of fun . 
 The invitation says it starts at 8 
 I have no idea , she hasn't given out many though . 
 have you seen bill recently ? 
 daisy ’ s in hospital too . she got food poisoning last week . She thinks she got it from some bad seafood .

 I see . My niece just flew back from Australia to visit . She ’ s got jetlag now . she ’ s just resting today , but we ’ ll probably go out somewhere tomorrow . 
 oh , your hand is still sore . You should put some ointment on it to stop the swelling . 
 yes , I banged it against to cooker yesterday . It really hurt , but it ’ s OK now . the bruise will disappear soon . 
 Certainly . How much will you be exchanging today ? 
 That ’ s a hefty amount . But that should have no problem at all . You should be aware that there is a ten-percent service charge , though . 
 Wait a minute ... do you have an account with us ? 
 For members , there is a small transaction charge , but it ’ s only 5 dollars per transaction . Any particular denomination ? 
 Here you are Mr . Lee . Will there be anything else ? 
 Excellent . As soon as we landed , we boarded a bus to Disneyland . I love Mickey Mouse . Janet and I spent the entire first day going on all of the rides . 
 I felt fine . I must have been too excited to notice . 
 Good morning , sir . May I help you ? 
 What do they look like ? 
 How tall are they ? 
 Do they look like roses ? 
 Oh , lilies of the valley . No , I am sorry . We are all out of them right now . 
 What about roses ? 
 As many as you like , sir . They are beautiful , aren't they ?

 The aircraft is equipped with onboard phones . They do not interfere with the communication and navigation of the aircraft . 
 Of course . They will be used at anytime before or during flight . 
 Well , all right . There are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents , information and other things . 
 They are , keep the documents in chronological order , remove all the chips and pins , punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder . 
 You should always remember that one customer on file is the rule . 
 I'd like to begin to work any time you want . 
 No problem . See you next Monday .

 Not that I can think of . Wait a second , we ’ re out of breakfast cereal . I think corn flakes are on sale . Get those . 
 Please point out the painful place with your finger . Is there any relation between the pain and the weather ? 
 Have you ever had any trauma ? 
 Does the pian become more intense at night ? 
 Do you have the sensation of ants crawling over the painful part ? 
 I'd like to treat you with acupuncture if you agree . 
 Acupuncture may cause just a little pain , but it also causes a certain feeling of numbness and distension.We ' ll try it every day for seven days.Will that be all right ? 
 Be quick . Put our bags in the deposit box . 
 I told you to hurry up a thousand times . You just put a deaf ear to it . 
 I surely did ! Ask the customer service counter if we can deposit our stuff there . 
 It's all your fault ! Now we can't get in shopping . 
 That sounds like a good idea ! 
 What color do you want ? 
 Peter , wash your hands first , and then have some dessert . 
 Not today , Honey . Don't eat too much ice cream . 
 Ok . The last piece is for your dessert . We're having dinner soon . 
 Of course ! Will you ?

 Good morning . 
 I'm not quite hungry now . Let me think for a while . 
 Ok , Ok . Toast and egg . 
 No . 
 I want to save some US dollars into my account . 
 Yes , that's what my husband advised me to do . But I'm not sure how long I should save for . 
 Mmmm ... 2 years does seem like a long time . How about the interest if I save for 6 months ? 
 That sounds fine to me . Yes , I think 6 months is the way to go . 
 Let's take a cab . 
 I'm afraid he is not in at the moment . 
 I suppose he won't come back until 6 p . m . By the way , do you want to call later , or would you like to leave a message ? 
 Okay , I'll do that . 
 You're welcome , bye !

 Very good . It's a pleasure to do business with you , Mrs . Phoebe . 
 Yes , I am . 
 I have been married for three years . 
 There are three people in my family . 
 My wife , my daughter and I . 
 Oh , all right . I lost a bunch of money in the last two years , but this year has been pretty good . 
 Just goes to show that you should buy companies , not ideas . 
 Yeah , me too . Did you hear about Frank ? 
 He lost his kids ' college money day trading . 
 How about 15 % the first six months and the second six months at 12 % with a guarantee of 3000 units ? 
 It's about the best we can do , Smith . We need to hammer something out today . If I go back empty-handed , I may be coming back to you soon to ask for a job . 
 Good . Let's iron out the remaining details . When do you want to take delivery ? 
 Let me run through this again , the first shipment for 1500 units to be delivered in 27 days by the 31 st . 
 Fine . But I'd prefer the first shipment to be 1000 units , the next 2000 . The 31 st is quite soon , I can't guarantee 1500 . 
 Tom , this deal promises big returns for both sides . Let's hope it's the beginning of a long and prosperous relationship .

 Just a moment , please . Oh , yes . One twin and one single . Is that right ? 
 Will you fill out this form , please ? 
 Certainly.How do you like to have it made ? 
 You may rest assured . 
 By the end of next week . 
 How can I help you ? 
 What's your name ? 
 Ok . Which facial would you like ? We have five different kinds of facials . 
 Well , since it's summer and it looks like you've had quite a bit of sun , I'd recommend our summer special . It's especially suited for individuals with sensitive skin . 
 The facial will start with a thorough cleansing . 
 Yes . The stimulation mask promotes blood flow and will firm up the skin . You can also choose to either get a hand or back massage as well . 
 Yes . We'll also apply some of our special day cream that will moisturize our skin and protect it from the sun . 
 Ok , just follow me . 
 Thank you for meeting me here . 
 I need to speak with you about your daughter . 
 I enjoy having your daughter in my class . 
 She is a great addition to my class . 
 She is always behaving herself , and she's so smart . 
 I'm more than happy having her in my class . 
 Our country is a free trade nation . She was mainly agriculture and rather a backward country and mow has developed into a modern highly industrialized state with an expanding economy . Parallel to this , her dependence upon foreign trade has increased . Increased output generates a greater need for raw materials , semi-finished products and capital goods . Thus . in many fields , our country is an important and growing market for exporters from other countries . But this doesn't mean that our country is an easy market , because of a liberal import policy and the high standard in our market is keen . 
 The price factor can be a useful instrument for exporters when trying to place their products in industrialized countries . Of course , marketing goods abroad is not only a question of price . There are also other important factors such as design , quality of goods , terms of sale , transport and insurance . 
 Well , I am a little bit out of shape . I think I should get some exercise to keep fit . what kind of service do you offer ? 
 How can you get that done ? 
 What else ? 
 Sounds pretty good . How much do you charge ? 
 Perhaps one month . I'll just have a try at first . 
 OK , I'll take it . 
 Don't worry , but my clothes are made of leathers . 
 Thank you for your warning . 
 Be careful of yourself . 
 Yes , I think so.Flight KL638 is still at the airport due to the hurricane . 
 Well if so.you should contact with the office over there.Maybe they will do you some help . 
 Can I help you find something ? 
 Is there one in particular that you like ? 
 Ah yes , that is a great refrigerator . 
 It's both affordable and it comes with all the appliances . 
 It comes with an ice maker , water dispenser , and there is a lot of room inside . 
 Be my guest . 
 You must be pretty excited about your trip to Europe . When is it that you are leaving ? 
 Like what ? 
 You are not going to give it up , are you ? 
 I don ’ t blame you . Perhaps you could sublet it . 
 Mmm ... let me think . Oh , I know just a person . An old colleague of mine , Jim Thomas , is coming here to do some research this summer , from June to August . 
 Tell you what , I ’ ll be calling Jim late this week anyway , so I ’ ll mention it to him then . 
 I like chess better than xiangqi . And you ? 
 I think chess is more reasonable . You see , each side has eight pawns , a larger number than that of the soldiers in xiangqi . A true battle should be like that . Soldiers should outnumber the commanders . 
 Correct ! Another contrast is the rules for the general and the king . It seems the general or marshal in xiangqi is much too incompetent . They are required to stay in the palace , waiting to be checked and fleeing for life under the cover of the guards . Look at the king in chess , he is much more capable . 
 There's another distinctive contrast . Both board games use a total of 32 pieces , but xiangqi is played on a 9 - by - 9 board , bigger than the 8 - by - 8 board used in chess . 
 Sure . On a chessboard , fire is much more intensive . It has a smaller board , while those bigger pieces-chariots , horses and bishops-can cover longer distances . 
 Wow , that would be very convenient . How much is the rent ? 
 That definitely sounds like a steal . I think that is a very trendy neighborhood as well . 
 Professor wang can I ask a few questions ? 
 What is the tariff ? 
 Why does the government levy the tariff ? 
 Anything else . 
 Oh , I know . Thank you . Professor wang . 
 I want to make a reservation under the name of William Smith . 
 Around 12:00 . 
 No , we have five persons . 
 Thank you . 
 Great . I have long been looking forward to there . 
 I can't help shopping there . 
 I see.That ’ s all right . Don ’ t put the blame on yourself . 
 Actually , I haven ’ t been sleeping well . I am kind of out of it . 
 I go to bed , but I just can ’ t get comfortable enough to stay asleep . 
 I usually try to go to bed around 11 
 My mother is ill with cancer , and I think about her a lot . 
 I usually watch a lot of television before I go to bed . Maybe I should try something else to help me quiet down . 
 What's the problem ? 
 Did you see if all the connections are right ? 
 The connections between your CPU and your outlet . 
 If your plugs aren't connected all the way , the computer won't turn on . 
 Why don't you try it and see what happens ? 
 Let me know if that doesn't work . 
 There is a warrant out for your arrest . 
 You have a bench warrant . 
 Have you missed a court date ? 
 I can't help you . 
 A lot of things aren't fair . That's life . 
 You have the right to an attorney . 
 I haven't started yet , but I will . 
 I'm planning on cleaning it up a little later . 
 I know . I am still going to clean it up . 
 I won't forget . 
 My plans aren't until later , so I'll clean it before I go . 
 Hold on for a moment . ( a few minutes later ) I have cancelled your reservation.Shall I make another one for you ? 
 I see . Please call us again for any further reservation.Thanks for calling us . 
 How long have you had it ? 
 I think you've got the flu . There's a lot of it about . 
 Take some medicine and stay in bed for a day or two . 
 Well , that's an hour's ride.Why not just post your mail here . 
 I see . 
 Yes , sir ? 
 I can understand that . Let me see if I can clarify some things for you . 
 It ’ s going pretty well , but I ’ m really tired ! 
 It ’ s all right . I don ’ t mind being busy ! 
 Sure , Brian . What ’ s on your mind ? 
 No , not at all , Brian . This year , we ’ Ve all had to cut back . I ’ m hoping next year ’ s going to better . I hope you can understand . 
 Here you are . 
 3 weeks . I am here on tour . 
 Excuse me , can you tell me how to apply for a visa to America ? 
 And what should I do next ? 
 How long will I wait for ? 
 What's the fee for application ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Are you here for the position advertised in China Daily ? 
 What kind of information would you like ? 
 Yes , it's still open . 
 Oh , we need your resume , health report , three photographs and several letters of recommendation . Would you please send them to us by next Wednesday ? 
 Would you please recommend some Chinese wine ? 
 That's great ! What comes along with Moutan ? 
 It sounds good . 
 Really ? Let me have a try . 
 No-no-no , sorry ! That's a handicapped parking space . Are you handicapped ? 
 Sorry , but you'll have to park in a normal space . 
 Be patient , miss . It'll just be a second . 
 I received an E-mail from mother today . 
 She missed us and asked when we would go back home . 
 I don't know . Maybe next week . We haven't been to the Great Wall yet . 
 All right . 
 I'd like to make a deposit please , into my granddaughter's account . It's her birthday on Friday . 
 Yes , right here . 
 Here ? And here ? 
 1,000 RIB . 
 It's an important birthday . 
 Good morning . Thank you . 
 Yes . I have written for several top newspapers in the country . I ’ m also in the process of writing my first novel . 
 Have you a bus tour round the city ? 
 Day tour . How much does that cost ? 
 Is lunch included ? 
 I haven ’ t seen you in a while . How have you been ? 
 Well , I ’ m hanging in there , but I lost my job and need to find another one quickly . 
 I am just trying to find something that will pay the bills until this bad economy passes by . 
 No , I haven ’ t been out on one interview yet . 
 I think that I might be interested in that position . 
 Are you ready to order now , sir ? 
 How would you like the steak , rare , medium , or well-done ? 
 Would you like something to drink ? 
 There have been too many unplanned shutdowns over the past few months . We'll have to make a few changes to the way we operate . We need to reduce our downtime . 
 We need to establish routine maintenance procedures . It costs us too much in lost production if we wait until something breaks down before we fix it . 
 Good afternoon . Can I help you ? 
 Certainly . 
 Two yuan , please . 
 Wait a moment . It seems that your letter is overweight . Let me weight it . 
 I'm afraid it is . So you will have to pay two yuan extra . The total charge is four yuan . 
 Here are the stamps and your receipt . 
 You can keep it until the addressee tells you that the letter has been delivered . It is the proof that you sent the letter if it fails to arrive . 
 Not at all . 
 Yes ? 
 Yes , it is . 
 Good heavens , am I really ? I'm so sorry , I didn't notice . 
 I see . 
 Hello , this is ABC Corporation . May I help you ? 
 Yes , but do you have any experiences as a sales manager ? 
 That sounds fine . Please give me your name and phone numbers . I ’ ll set up an appointment for an interview for you . It will most likely be in a couple of days . Is it all right for you ? 
 Thank you . 
 Certainly . When do you want to travel ? 
 Ok , no problem . What class of service would you like - soft sleeper or hard sleeper ? 
 The soft sleeper costs 600RMB one way and the hard sleeper is 400RMB one way . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Do you want it with everything ? 
 All right . You have a hamburger without mustard . Anything else ? 
 OK . Here you are . 
 Hello , Pratt . How was your interview yesterday ? 
 I am sorry to tell you that I have lost the opportunity . 
 Yes , I know I am excellent , but I pay no attention to the etiquette you ’ Ve told me . 
 When I entered the room , I forgot to close the door . Later , I couldn ’ t help smoking , you know I am a heavy-smoker . What ’ s more , I forgot to polish my shoes . There is some dirt on it . 
 Yes , I know . And next time I must make good preparations . 
 Thank you . 
 No , who won ? 
 What ? You can ’ t be serious ! 
 Why would anyone vote for McCain ? 
 That ’ s horrible . 
 More bad news ? 
 Are you serious this time ? That ’ s wonderful news . 
 Good morning . 
 To the airport please . 
 Thank you . How much is it ? 
 Here's ten pounds . Keep the change . 
 You're welcome , Goodbye ! 
 Yes , I'd like to make reservation for tonight , a table for five , please . 
 Around 8 . 
 Frank London . Any chance of a table by the window ? 
 I'll appreciate it if it could be arranged . 
 Which credit card was the bill for ? 
 That bill should have been mailed about two weeks ago . 
 My computer shows that it has already been mailed . 
 You should try contacting your post office . 
 You'll have to prove it was their error ; then you can get an extension . 
 You are very welcome . Have a good day . 
 Why don't we go shopping ? 
 Let's go to Julian Store . 
 This is James Hong calling from Lincoln Bank . 
 I'm calling to let you know that the funds for NX567822100007 have arrived . 
 Well , it's here now . Shall we credit that straight to your account ? 
 Hello , this is Catharine from Thomson Company . Can I speak to Mr . Wang ? 
 Yes . Please tell him that he is expected to have an interview with the CEO of ABC company tomorrow morning at 10:00 . 
 OK , I will repeat what I said loudly . 
 Let me see . Yes , here you are . 
 No , they won't . They are shrink proof . 
 Mark , you really did a good job . 
 You must have spent much time on the project . 
 Your project made much profit for the company . And the board of directors decided to give you a bonus . 
 Excuse me , sir , this is the express check-out lane for people that have fifteen items or fewer . It looks like you have more than fifteen items there . 
 Fine ! Please place your items on the belt and push your shopping cart through . Do you prefer paper or plastic ? 
 No problem , I ’ ll take those . Sir , these coupons expired yesterday . 
 Do you have a club card or will it be cash ? 
 Will this be debit or credit ? 
 Yeah , sure . Your total is seventy-eight dollars and thirty-three cents . Here is your receipt . Have a nice day . 
 Yes , we try to accommodate all needs of our patrons , including fitness . 
 The gym is just below the lobby . Take the elevator or the stairs . You can't miss it . 
 No , the gym is free to guests . Take your room key , however , so you can get in . 
 The gym is open seven days a week , twenty-four hours a day . 
 Unfortunately , no . If you want a trainer , you'll have to use another gym . 
 My long-term goal is to become an expert in this field . 
 In order to achieve that objective . I would work step by step and make further study . 
 Uh ... yeah . Hi ! Is Susie there ? 
 Oh . I'm sorry . But is this 321-9987 ? 
 I am really sorry . 
 Good morning , sir , where are you going ? 
 When is your flight ? 
 We are checking in . May I have your ticket ? And your health certificate and your luggage , please . 
 Are you keeping this small bag as carry-on luggage , sir ? 
 You must weigh that as well . 
 Your luggage is two pounds over , I am afraid there'll be an excess luggage charge , sir . 
 It's 10 yuan . 
 This is your luggage check , which you must show when you disembark at your destination , and here is your boarding pass and your ticket . 
 Now please wait until your flight is called . There are about twenty-five minutes to go . 
 There is nothing at all to worry about . Once you're in the air , it's just like sitting in your own living room . It's going to be a very pleasant flight . 
 Let me see . I am sorry we just have sold it out . 
 I think so.Could I have you name , telephone number ? If we get one , I will call you . 
 What is the proper way to handle a napkin at dinner ? 
 How about at a formal dinner ? 
 My friend Emily recently lost 18 pounds . 
 The point is that she has been persuading me to lose weight too . 
 Good ? Yes , it's good for her but not for me . You see , she tells me that I'll feel better about myself if I slim down . She keeps giving me newspaper clippings about the latest miracle diet and insists that I join a health club , as she has . 
 I just can't bear it that Emily made me feel like a baby who always pigs out on junk food . 
 But junk food is so easy . It requires no silverware or plates , no rigid mealtimes , no pleases and thank yous . 
 Yes , but life without chips , ice cream and coca cola is boring . 
 Well , that sounds better than giving it up . 
 OK . You have to fill out this form and let me see three identification cards or documents . 
 Let me see them . Yes , they ’ re OK . 
 You can deposit an initial amount of five dollars . 
 Do you have any experience working with a computer ? 
 What kind of software can you use ? 
 Do you have any other computer qualifications ? 
 Do you know how to use a PC to process the management information ? 
 Do you like coffee , Ann ? 
 Do you want a cup ? 
 Do you want any sugar ? 
 Do you want any milk ? 
 Do you like biscuits ? 
 Do you want one ? 
 Look , Dad , many people are doing morning exercises here . 
 Really ? You were so happy then . 
 Daddy , don't mention it . 
 Dad , I'd like to take a picture with the status . 
 Daddy , we can't have a photo of the whole family . We can take one here . 
 I really like the apartment , but I was wondering if I could change some things . 
 I would like to have different carpet . 
 How much more would it cost ? 
 While I am at it , would it be possible to switch paint colors ? 
 When can my apartment be painted and ready to go ? 
 Where do these flower vases come from ? 
 Are they breakable ? 
 No wonder it's so expensive . 
 it's hard to say , but i do love foxtrot and waltz . 
 to tell the truth . i don't like it , it's too noisy . 
 oh , it's really beautiful . but i just can't dance it well . 
 ok . 
 Mr . Smith , I'm wondering whether you have found a way of considering my offer ? 
 You see . I made what I consider to be a reasonable offerbased upon the rise in production costs and the continued fall in the exchange rate of Australian Dollar to U . S . Dollar . 
 I understand . 
 I think the best way I can do is to reduce our price by 2 % and I should think we could conclude a deal at $ 98 . 
 Your legal department is very good at these things . We can trust them with the drafting of the agreement . 
 Very agreeable , Mr . Smith . It will only take me a minute to sign it and send it back to you . 
 Hi , I come to pick up my laundry . This is the invoice . 
 I'm afraid that a button is missing . 
 OK , please . 
 Well , oh my God , there is another problem , I'm afraid . There is still a stain on the shirt . 
 It's been several days now , I am not sure . 
 Oh , that's so bad . I know little about that . Is there a remedy for it ? 
 OK , I will . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Hi . Can you give me a wake-up call tomorrow ? 
 I need two wake-up calls , if you don't mind , one at 7 and the other at 7 fifteen . 
 On second thought , you'd better make that second call at 7 thirty instead of 7 fifteen . 
 No , that gets it for now , thank you . 
 Hello , Steven . Can you do me a favor ? 
 My car has broken down . 
 I have done it . But now I have an urgent appointment to keep . Could you drive me to the subway station ? 
 Thanks a lot ! 
 How can I help you ? 
 Will that be all , sir ? 
 I will have someone bring that up right away . How would like to pay for the dinner ? 
 All right , sir . You would receive dinner in about 15 minutes . 
 Well , well , Mike.Fancy meeting you here . 
 Yes , I haven't seen you for four years.How time flies ! 
 Thanks . 
 Well , I'm looking for a job . 
 What kind of information do you want ? 
 Wilson . 
 Steven Michael . 
 Yes , It's Henrylee@yahoo.com . 
 Twenty-one . 
 In California . 
 I'm single . 
 I was an office boy . 
 Yes . This is Barbara in room 209 . I ’ d like to order breakfast , please . 
 Two slices of whole wheat bread and one cup of coffee . 
 Thank you . 
 Oh , yes , Mrs.Saxton . Please take a seat here . 
 Would you like a shampoo first ? 
 Yeah . A lot of my customers love it . ( after shampooing ) Do you want a permanent wave or a cold wave ? 
 Sure . We just got some . They're upto-date . 
 No problem . 
 What ? 
 Yes . We need some . How much did you change ? 
 Yes , it's about 35 pesos for every Taiwan dollar , right ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 Why ? 
 Sixty ? That's too much . How can that be ? 
 Just two days ago it was 35 . How can it be 60 ? 
 That's amazing ! Really ? How could it change so much in two days ? 
 You'll never lose weight if you listen to your stomach . 
 You want to be beautiful , don't you ? Think about the butter and flour in ... 
 Most models only eat once a day . If they can do it , so can we . 
 I think you're hallucinating ! What are you talking about ? 
 And your point is ? 
 I agree with you , but I think people are pretty bad , too . 
 People are always gossiping about one another . 
 We can be so critical of one another . 
 Good morning . I ’ m Mickey Huang , I have an appointment with Mr wilson . 
 That's right . My appointment is for 11 o'clock . 
 Thank you . 
 No , I'm fine . Thank you . 
 yes , but I have a few questions for you . 
 first , I ’ d like to know if you offer employees sick leave . 
 even if I ’ m only sick for one day ? 
 that ’ s pretty strict , if you ask me . 
 I see . I guess that makes sense . 
 yes . Maternity leave is mentioned in the contract , but there ’ s nothing in the contract alout paternity leave . Do you offer anything to fathers ? 
 how many days of paternity leave do you offer ? 
 why are women allowed so much more time for maternity leave ? 
 I guess so . I don ’ t have any other questions . Should I sign here then ? 
 Would you like to order now ? 
 Please let me point out the chef's special , which is blackened catfish . 
 We are always happy to adjust our cooking to meet your needs . 
 The cashew broccoli noodles or the cheese and veggie enchiladas would be an excellent choice . 
 Would you like your salad brought to you with your entree , or would you like it served now ? 
 Hello . May I help you ? 
 That one is one hundred and fifty dollars . 
 That ’ s one hundred and forty . 
 This is an exclusive design by marco ! It ’ s a bargain at that price . 
 Okay , okay , how about one hundred dollars ? 
 Okay , I can give you a special discount , just because you seem like a nice person . One hundred and ninety dollars for both . 
 my final price ! One hundred dollars for both ! That ’ s two for the price of one . That ’ s my last offer ! 
 So , where is this bus supposed to take us ? 
 Well , don't you know for sure ? 
 Are you sure we got on the right bus ? 
 This place doesn't look like Altadena . 
 Read one of the street signs or something . 
 That's the last time I'm trusting you with the transportation . 
 Welcome , sir . May I help you ? 
 No problem . Actually , we have some great packages . The most exciting season of Hawaii is now . How about a relaxing vacation in Hawaii ? 
 Yes . There will be one at the end of this month . For many people , a Hawaiian vacation promises languid days filled with sunbathing and poolside cocktails . For others , it ’ s all about non-stop action in one of the world's most extreme natural playgrounds . Whether you are in search of quiet relaxation or unbridled stimulation , Hawaii gives you the best of both . 
 15 days . The transportation by air will take five days . 
 Sir , let's do it step by step . First , we will visit over 25 different places . Most of the places are in Hawaii ’ s Big Island . We will stay in Arlott ’ s Lodge 
 Well , right now there's a special rate for 40,000 RIB for this package , including everything such as airline ticket , tour guides , hotels and food . All you have to do is to sign up and we will take care of everything . 
 Sure . By the way , this special price is only good through the end of the week . 
 Yes , sir . It will be a great pity ! 
 Thank you ! 
 They arrested me without probable cause . 
 They had no reason for arresting me . 
 Yes , the next morning . 
 Yes , they did . 
 I matched the description of a bank robber they were looking for . 
 I want justice . 
 Yes . 
 Hi , excuse me , Sir ? I ’ m looking for a dress shoe . My usual pair that I ’ Ve had for years have finally been stretched out of shape . They don ’ t provide any support anymore . 
 Show me some classic high heels , please . 
 Black . Classic . 
 Umm . too shiny . And I wear pantyhose with my shoes so let ’ s look for a closed-toe shoe . 
 I don ’ t like the pointed toes . Let me take a look at what else you have . Too high . That one looks like the back would cut into my heel . I have a high instep so I doubt that one will fit properly . I don ’ t want bows . I find slingbacks very uncomfortable . Those might as well be stilettos . Too modern . Ah , finally , this is what I ’ m looking for . 
 Seven-and-a-half . 
 Hmmm.Not good . They ’ re too tight.The length is right , but the shoe is too narrow and it ’ s pinching my toes . And there ’ d be no room for my insoles . You know what ? I don ’ t think I have the patience for this today . They just don ’ t make shoes like they used to . I ’ ll come back another time . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 OK . This way , please . 
 We've particularly busy on Sunday . Please sit here . How do you wish it cut ? 
 It's a long time since you had a haircut last time , isn't it ? 
 How long ago ? 
 Shall we share a taxi ? 
 I want to go back to my college on the Huanghe road . It is very close to your house . 
 That's the one . 
 Yeah . If we share the cab , it'll be cheaper . Besides that your Chinese is better than mine . The drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though I practice my pronunciation carefully . 
 Hello . May I help you ? 
 Don ’ t worry , we ’ ll try to help you . Will you please fill out this form ? 
 This is for registration . After you have given us your personal details , we'll match these against new jobs as they come in . And we ’ ll contact you when there is a job that suits you . 
 Maybe several weeks , maybe several months . It's hard to tell . 
 Actually , many jobs are filled by people who select vacancies from the display boards there . 
 My advice is to keep looking for jobs yourself . Check the job boards at the job center regularly and check the newspapers daily . If you have friends or relatives here , ask them for help , too . 
 Keep in touch . 
 I'm doing great . What about you ? 
 Everything's been good with you ? 
 I started school recently . 
 I'm going to PCC . 
 I like it so far . My classes are pretty good right now . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Great . That will give me time to talk with my staff before I make final decision . 
 Good news . Thanks for getting things done so quickly . 
 Oh , and there's one more thing you have to do every hour on the hour , sweets . 
 Well , you do that when your nose needs blowing . I was talking about a way to make your throat heal faster . 
 It works better than any medicine , Lily . I'll make you a glass right now , and you'll finish it ! 
 That would be a good shot . Can you take my picture here , dear ? Please try to get the garden in the frame as well . 
 Thanks . Could you take one more from this angle ? 
 Now let's have one together . 
 Let me see ... set the timer first and push the button , oh , come here . 
 Cheese ... 
 Yes , but it's blurred and a little dark . 
 Ok , let's go . 
 I don't think we can . 
 By the middle of October , I think . 
 I understand . 
 But our factories are fully committed for the third quarter . In fact , many of our clients are placing orders for delivery in the fourth quarter . 
 I see your point . However , we have done more business this year than any of the previous years . I am very sorry to say that we cannot advance the time of delivery . 
 You may take it from me that the last thing we want to do is to disappoint an old customer like you . But the fact remains that our manufacturers have a heavy backlog on their hands . 
 All right . We'll get in touch with our producers and see what they have to say . 
 I'd like to open an account . 
 Actually , I'd like to open one of each , if that's possible . 
 What are my choices ? 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 What about this one ? It's the latest . 
 I am sorry , it's out of stock right now . 
 Yeah.What a surprise ! 
 Fine.thanks . 
 What do you mean , Mom ? For breaking your best china ? 
 Well , it's more like she kept me busy ... 
 Am I back in your good books ? 
 Where do you usually do your shopping , Mrs . Lane ? 
 How do you find the prices there ? 
 I see you have bought some coffee.Would you mind telling me how much you paid for it ? 
 Hey honey , how was your day ? 
 Why ? What happened ? 
 Yeah , you ’ re right . We aren ’ t getting any younger and our kids are getting older . 
 Sounds good , although , do you think we can qualify for insurance ? Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money . 
 I wish our company or country provided us with healthcare . 
 Is everything all right ? 
 What's the problem ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 He didn't hurt you , did he ? 
 I'm so sorry . 
 Let me take you . 
 Repair service , how may I help you ? 
 How old is your phone ? 
 The wire in your phone might have gotten rusty . Could you bring your phone into our office ? We'll clean it for you . 
 We're located at 132 West Street . 
 From 9A . M . to 5 P . M . 
 No problem . See you this afternoon . 
 No , ma'am , there's only one person ahead of you . You won't have to wait long . 
 All right , madam , it's your turn . What will it be today ? 
 Come here , please . We'd like to wash your hair first . That way it will be easier to cut and style . I think you'll like this style . It's very fashionable . 
 Would you like me to blow-dry your hair ? 
 What do you think of it ? 
 Not at all . When you wash it , it will fall into place naturally . You'll probably need another cut in about a month . Shall I make an appointment for you ? 
 Anything I can do for you ? 
 It's on the third floor . 
 You're welcome . 
 Yes , this is a very popular car . 
 The car is beautiful , isn't it ? Come on inside and we'll discuss the price . 
 50000 yuan ' What a deal ! That will , of course , include tax , licence , and registration fee . 
 Then what price would be fair to you ? 
 I can see that you are a smart buyer . Forty thousand is my best price . 
 38000yuan is my final offer . 
 O . K . So , where do you think we can save more money ? 
 Yeah , that ’ s a good idea , and you like to cook . What about the books ? 
 Come on , if we save more money we can retire earlier , and you ’ ll actually have time to read all those books you buy . 
 O . K . Let ’ s compromise , if you agree to only spend $ 75 on books , I ’ ll agree to only spend $ 40 for my next shirt . 
 I was meaning to ask you if you saw the basketball game on Friday . 
 It was a great game . 
 Our team played hard and won . 
 It was the best game ever . 
 The other team lost by three points , 101-98 . 
 It really was . You should've gone . 
 morning , Mr . Emory . I was hoping to set up an appointment with you for sometime this week . 
 Fine , Mr . Emory . Would next Monday at 4:00 o ’ clock be all right for you ? 
 The time has come to say goodbye . 
 I feel that way , too . But all good things must come to an end , as they say . 
 I've had a delightful time and I really appreciate your spending so much time showing me the sights . 
 You'll be out to see me next year , as you promised ? 
 I'll be expecting you then . 
 I think our smoked fish will be to your taste . 
 Benter's Books . 
 We have several hundred in stock . 
 Where is that ? 
 ( while driving ) Are you in a hurry ? 
 We'll make it except a jam.You know it's rush hour . 
 I'll do my best . 
 Do you have small bills ? 
 Here is your receipt.Thank you . 
 True . When I tell my kids to behaves themselves , they will make a face and slip away . 
 Would you care for a cup of tea before your meal ? 
 How about some Oolong tea ? It's very popular with our guests . 
 Here is the document you asked for this morning . 
 You ’ re welcome . You know , these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . The more I think about it , the more I hate myself for being so disorganized . I decided to change the situation as soon as possible . Otherwise I will be more regretful later . 
 The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place . 
 I take care of the letters . I may read , sort out and organize incoming mails . 
 Yes , except the personal mail . And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly . 
 Yes , and I check all the e-mails for Mr . Thomas . 
 Do you want to send it by airmail or by surface mail ? 
 About five weeks . 
 Just a moment . I'll weigh it . 
 It's a portable TV . It's a popular thing now . 
 News about current affairs , documentaries , music , movies , noncommercial ads and so on . 
 Yes , there are something good and informative . I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education . 
 Of course . Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs . 
 Not always . It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals . 
 Yes , 50 Yuan per month . 
 Yeah . You know driving is boring . TV can get me out of the fatigue of driving . 
 That's the point . 
 Hello , this is Mr . Morris Pitt . I'd like to speak to Mr . Bell , please . 
 Please have him call me at my office . He knows the number . 
 Hey Ted , I saw this ad in the paper . You should take a look . 
 It ’ s for a job . It looks perfect for you . 
 Come on , what have you got to lose ? 
 Here , I ’ ll help you type one up . 
 Have you made up your mind ? 
 We have roast chicken , grilled chicken , chicken curry and chicken chops . 
 Good afternoon . Welcome to China . May I see your passport , customs and health declaration form ? 
 Thank you . What's your occupation , Mr . Smith ? 
 You are here on business , aren't you ? 
 I see . Do you have anything to declare ? 
 Would you please fill out this currency declaration form ? It's a record of the foreign currency you have brough in . 
 Have you got a minute ? 
 What can I do for you ? 
 What kind do you want to open ? 
 Do you have an account opened with this bank already ? 
 You can always transfer money from that account into your new one . 
 How much money do you want to transfer ? 
 I ’ ll do that right now . 
 Excuse me , I'm lost . Can you show me where I am in this map ? 
 That's great ! It's not my day . I just have very bad sense of direction . 
 I am supposed to go to Liu Ichang . 
 Yes . Yes . Can you tell me how to get there ? 
 Most of our customers are foreigners . How many foreign languages can you speak , Elizabeth ? 
 And how well can you speak them ? 
 And how about your Spanish ? 
 I see . Well , we have a lot of Spanish customers , but you wouldn't need to write any Spanish here . 
 We are on our way . I think our first stop is Buckingham Palace . 
 And here is Buckingham Palace ! Look , isn't it beautiful ? It is much bigger than I imagined . 
 Yes we are going towards Westminster Abbey . I can see it now ! Look to your right . 
 This is amazing . I'm glad we decided to take this bus tour . So where next ? 
 Yes . It is just round the corner . Oh , can you see the London Eye ? Look straight and to your right . 
 This is Lambeth Bridge . We will then loop back and cross the river again on Westminster Bridge . 
 Excuse me , but I ’ m a bit lost here . Where does this street lead to ? 
 So is it the right way to the City Hall ? 
 Is there a train leaving for Philadelphia ? 
 May I buy a ticket here at the station ? 
 Where ? 
 Thanks . 
 Yes , I'd like to see that pen . 
 Can I get it duty-free ? 
 It's not the latest model , is it ? 
 Mom , Dad ! Can you come to my room ? I think there is something under my bed ! 
 Have you been registered yet , sir ? 
 Are you a medical or surgical case ? 
 Do you have your medical history sheet with you ? 
 Please fill in this admission card . Well , how long do you expect to stay in the hospital ? 
 But there're no beds available now . Two patients will be discharged this afternoon , so you'll have to wait until then . 
 Certainly . See you in the afternoon . 
 Would you like a savings or a chequing account ? 
 Right.Could you fill out this form please ? 
 Good thing , we took a taxi . 
 Hey , look there . It is an advertisement of the piano training class on the billboard . The place is not far from our home . 
 Your sister is in high school now ; no one plays the piano at home . 
 Why ? Why not ! The piano is right there . 
 Anyway , I will have a look at the piano class after work by myself . 
 I think my car can run much faster than yours . 
 That's true . 
 Sorry , Tom , can you say that last bit again please ? We didn ’ t get that . 
 Sorry Tom , We're having problems hearing you here . It ’ s a bit hissy . Can you hear us ? 
 Hello ? 
 Tom , if you can hear me , I think we ’ Ve lost you . There ’ s a problem with the line . Let ’ s try again . We ’ ll call you . 
 Mary , this company is pretty good . I really want to have an interview . 
 Not yet . Do I have to ? 
 Why ? 
 Yes , you are right . 
 Sure . Why didn't I think of that ? 
 Then how can I make the appointment ? 
 Ok , I see . 
 Hi , I'm checking in . The last name is Rama . 
 Actually , no . It should be a suite . I had booked a non-smoking king . 
 That's okay . I'm here a little early . Is it possible to check in right now ? 
 Here it is . 
 Oh , just one . 
 No , I'm fine . Thanks . 
 Why do you want to work in our company ? 
 Can you tell me something about the balance sheet now ? 
 Will you be voting ? 
 I already have . 
 I mailed in an absentee ballot . 
 I can ’ t vote on Tuesday . 
 I have to go to work . 
 I need to take care of some business that morning . 
 How ’ s everything with you today ? 
 What can I do for you ? 
 Do you know which account you want to take the money from ? 
 Where are you transferring the money to ? 
 How much ? 
 Will that be all ? 
 Hello , Mr . Hao . I am calling to tell you that you are not selected as our employee . Sorry . 
 Maybe . But you should not withdraw forever just because you failed once . 
 Good afternoon . Thank you for the opportunity to interview for this position . 
 Actually , I am very familiar with the area so there was absolutely no problem . 
 I am interested in switching fields . 
 I am good at pulling together teams of people to accomplish a task . 
 I am impatient with myself at times and am hard on myself . 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Well , that's really a big city . How long do your vacations last ? 
 Here you are . Take your time . 
 Good evening . We've a reservation for a table for four . My name is Tim . 
 But there is a change in the number of people . There are seven of us . Three of my friends are coming soon . 
 Well , it's a window table that we've booked . 
 Oh , I see . We'll have to make up with the center one . 
 If a Mr . Wu comes to look for me , just take him here . 
 Excuse me , Miss . The total works wrong . What are these extra charges ? 
 Well . What's this 138 dollars charge then ? 
 Oh , right . I forgot about that . Sorry , I'll pay cash . 
 I want to book a tour with adventure sports . 
 I don ’ t really think I ’ m ready to throw myself down a river full of jagged rocks in a rubber boat or go up in the air in a wicker basket held up by an oversize balloon . What else do you have ? 
 What ? You mean strap myself to a flimsy kite ? No , thank you ! Next ! 
 I ’ m thinking something exciting but safer . 
 That ’ s more like it ! 
 Sure , sweetie.What are you doing ? 
 OK.Why don't you just hold the ladder , and I'll put it up . 
 Let's go ! 
 Did you like the Chanel bag that I got ? 
 I bought it on eBay . It was only one-tenth of the original price . And the purchase was so easy . 
 Well , it came with a certificate , and it looks real . But auctioning on eBay is risky . 
 Then you haven't browsed eBay before ... get online . Don't hang up ! 
 Right . The people in your math class might not be the people you have science with . 
 Yep . And the date is set for homecoming night . 
 It's a football game the school team plays at home . The dance and reunions are usually that night , too . 
 Yes , I am after some sugar . 
 Can you show me the way , please ? 
 Don't you think all of the money goes to the ads and we have nothing to read . 
 Extra income.They can get rich with sheer ads . 
 Well , I just came in . I worked overtime yesterday . Some statistics and very important documents seemed to be inaccurate . So I stayed to double check them . The boss was aware of my very late work of last night . So before he left office , he told me I could come one hour later this morning . 
 It was around 1 thirty in the morning . I guess I didn ’ t fall asleep till 3 because those numbers were involving in my mind . I just couldn ’ t stop thinking about them . 
 Working at weekend is something I hate to do most . 
 Hello . I need to speak with Allan Cartwright . 
 I certainly hope so , I am about to stop doing business with your office . 
 Carlo's Kitchen . 
 For four , And may I have your name ? 
 Are there any special unemployment forms I need to fill out ? 
 Do you know where I can find the application form ? 
 What records will I have to show to apply for unemployment benefits ? 
 Is there anything else I will need to provide ? 
 Do I need to do anything else after I turn in the application ? 
 I'd like to try the chef's special . 
 I am on a diet . Do you have a vegetarian menu ? 
 Oh . I see . I would like to have mashed potatoes and chocolate pudding . 
 It depends on your height and body type . 
 By warming up before and cooling down after your workout . 
 Well , it's completely changed my life . 
 Well , before , I was the skinniest guy on the beach . 
 Just look ! In six short weeks I've put on 30 pounds of pure muscle . 
 Did you hear something ? 
 It is a good habit to set your cell phone to vibrate . It is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices . 
 Maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done . 
 Hey , Benjamin , have you finished your report on the project ? 
 What ? Man , you don't know how to write a project report ? That's sounds a little bit ridiculous . 
 Oh , sorry , I've totally forgotten that you are a workaholic . 
 First is your final conclusion on your work of this year , and then comes your plan for the next year . 
 Let me see , no , you have to include more details about your final conclusion , for example , your experiences in dealing with some emergent events . 
 And only that doesn't make a perfect one , you also have to pay attention to the format of the report . 
 I'm sorry . There isn't . Because different people have to write different kinds of reports . 
 OK , no problem . But you have to learn it and then do it yourself next time . 
 I watched it happen . 
 Yes . I was right there . 
 This guy tried to rob the bank . 
 I was really scared when he pulled the gun out . 
 He tried to leave with the money . 
 They caught him before he could walk through the front door . 
 Yes . They are over there . 
 By weight . 6.0 cents per pound . 
 $ 4.55 , please . Anything else ? 
 Here you are . 
 Give me a sec . 
 I want to have a haircut . 
 How much is a regular haircut without shampoo ? 
 And how much for haircut with shampoo ? 
 Since it is , I need a haircut with shampoo . 
 SEEK , please . 
 What hairstyle do you feel will look best on me ? 
 I have the same idea as you . 
 You came to the right spot . Come on in and join us ! 
 I am here to show you how to put together the perfect resume . It will turn out great ! 
 We need to put our name and contact information across the top . 
 You can list your education at the top , or choose your job experience to be there if it is more impressive . 
 I think that that would work out quite well as an ending for your resume . 
 Yes . This is Mr . Wang in Room 1305 . Please send up a boy to help me with my luggage . 
 Well , two big suitcases and two small bags . 
 Are you doing the job the way I suggested ? 
 Well , have it your way . 
 Yes , I have received an Engineer's Qualification Certificate and a driver's license . 
 I have two years driving experience . 
 I have experience in computer operation , proficiency in Microsoft Windows , Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel . 
 Visual C + + , C and Delphi . 
 No , but I have database programming experience and network knowledge . 
 Hello , I'm calling from Beijing . I'd like to reserve a double room with a bath from tonight on for five days , please . 
 John Smith . J-O-H-N S-M-I-T-H . 
 What ? You're kidding ! Let me see that ... There must be some mistakes . 
 Oh , it's a pity . 
 We're sorry , but single rooms have been occupied . 
 Then , how about this room with just a shower ? 
 No , sir.The tax is included . 
 It's a furnished two bedroom flat in a three-story building on campus . 
 It's not as bad as I thought it would be . The freshmen that live nearby are really loud , especially on the weekends . But , the rent is much cheaper than private housing , so it's worth it . 
 No , but we do have to pay 9 months rent in 6 months , so for the first 6 months we pay 1/2 month's rent each month . 
 No , it's all included . Besides , students don't have to pay council tax , so we're saving quite bit of money by living here . 
 That's the bad thing---the contract ends in June , so we'll have to find a new apartment soon . 
 Not yet . I'm hoping we'll be able to find something cheap once all the students leave the city for the summer . 
 Which service offered by your bank do you use most ? 
 Do you ever ask you bank for traveller ’ s cheques ? They are much safer than carrying lots of cash around . 
 Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills ? I use direct debit . 
 That ’ s good idea . You don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . I suppose you have a mortgage too . 
 I have a deposit account with my bank . There are some restrictions on withdrawing money , but the interest rate is much higher . 
 That ’ s great . But I prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain . 
 Yes , I've just married . 
 I have been married for three years . 
 There are four people in my family . 
 My husband , my mother-in-law , my daughter and I . 
 Hi , I'm looking into your loans and I'm a little confused about the interest rates . Could you give me some advice ? 
 I understand . I'm interested in the Petty Consumer Loan . 
 So , the rate could fluctuate a little , depending on the amount given by the PBC ? 
 I'm going to have to do some more research into this . Thanks for your help , bye for now . 
 We're okay for vegetables but we should stock up on meat . Can you go to the butcher's and get some veal and some beef ? 
 Better visit the supermarket then . We'll need some other things for the party . Get some vanilla ice cream , some butter and some vinegar and twelve bottles of beer . 
 I'll see you later then . 
 Good morning , Madam . What can I do for you ? 
 Do you have an appointment ? 
 Ah , yes , Ms Reeve . I have all of your information here . Do you have the cash cheque ? 
 I'm sorry Ms Reeve , it says 45,000 RIB here . 
 I'm sorry , we cannot make corrections on these . You'll have to bring another one with the correct amount , I'm afraid . 
 Good afternoon . My name is Monica . I am here for the job interview at 2 PM . 
 Done . Here is my paper . 
 What about the 3rd round ? 
 How do I get to the EDD ? 
 Can I go in to look for a job at their office ? 
 Is there an office near me ? 
 Do you know where the local office for this area is ? 
 If I go there , will I be able to collect money right away ? 
 How much are you asking for this ? 
 Is tax already included in their price ? 
 Would you consider a volume discount ? 
 I'll accept your offer . 
 Yes , I am looking for a coat . 
 I have no idea . 
 Well , it's good in style , but I am afraid it doesn't wash well . 
 Don't tell me it affects our flight . 
 Did they say for how long ? 
 So we can't really go anywhere , can we ? 
 I brought some cards . Are you up for a long game ? 
 Beauty costs , dear ! What do you think of this dress ? Do you think it suits me ? 
 come on , you sound like my Mom.Look at that , it's beautiful ! 
 maybe you have a point . 
 all right . How about this black shirt ? It can be worn for anything---a party , a job interview and even a funeral ! 
 oh ! Hey , look , that's the same shirt Britney wore in her concert . 
 why not try it on ? 
 yes . 
 Francis , what ’ s that ? 
 Could you tell me something about it ? 
 How many departments do we have ? 
 Ok . Who should I report to ? 
 Waiter , a table for two , please . 
 Can we see the menu please . 
 What ’ s good today ? 
 We don ’ t want that . Well . perhaps will be begin with mushroom soap and follow by some seafood and chips . 
 no dissert , thanks , just coffee.can I have the check please ? 
 You bet , as long as I can collect enough money . 
 Aren't you crazy ? 
 Could you drop me off at the airport ? 
 Do I need to pay any extra change for my suitcases ? 
 All right . 
 Absolutely . I've sorted out all the materials we need and sifted three great ways of marketing . 
 We can discuss them detailedly over the meeting and choose the best way to promote our key products . 
 They are playing the wedding march , and I have felt tears . 
 Really ? I have seen that our wedding , but just mary's . 
 You are always be the most beautiful one in the world . What is the bridemaid's name ? 
 Don't be so sensitive , just a casual question , I caught you looking at the groomsman 
 I wonder why he is chosen to be the groomsman , and why mary doesn't marry him since he's much more attractive . 
 Administer is doing a good job . I'm not sure they'll be as happy as we are . 
 First of all , I need to share what the purpose of a home inspection is . Do you understand what I was doing there ? 
 I help you spot potential problems with the home before you purchase it . 
 Sellers aren ’ t really all that objective . They may have gotten used to a leaky faucet , but it is still broken . 
 The owners may wish to pay to have the problems fixed , or maybe the price of the house can be reduced . 
 The house has a very outdated electrical system . Many of the switches and outlets do not work and are unsafe . 
 I really love this kind of atmosphere . 
 There are people everywhere . What's that girl doing ? 
 And what about that man there ? 
 I see you have a coffee bar for a water cooler . The staff here must be comfortable . I think it really helps morale when people feel supported by their employees . 
 What channel did you watch last night ? 
 How do you feel about it ? 
 Well , I don't think much about it . To me , it's a sheer waste of time 
 Variety shows and talk shows , I think . 
 Actually , I received that kind of training when I was in college . 
 I worked as a PR clerk for one year 
 Yes , I'd like to know if the company provides opportunities for further education . 
 That's very generous . 
 Thank you . I appreciate the time you've given to me . 
 We have hundreds of constituencies and the votes in each one elect a member of parliament . Most people call them mp ’ s . 
 Almost all of them do . A few are independent . That means that they do not belong to a party . If one party more than half of the mp ’ s . they form a government . That means that they choose a prime minister can cabinet members . 
 This is a small group of people-perhaps 25 mp ’ s who are usually ministers . They make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy . 
 Any mp can present a law to parliament . The proposed law is debated and voted on . If it is accepted , it becomes law . 
 Yes , it does , because they have most of the mp ’ s . most mp ’ s vote the way their party wants them to . 
 They produce manifesto . These documents which states their policies . Some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . Votes who often change the party they vote for are called floating voters . 
 A cup of coffee , please . 
 I'd like a little sugar , please . 
 Why did you ask me if I wanted some ? 
 Excuse me . I want to pay the bill . 
 OK.Your bill includes the doctor's fee and the cost for a 3 - day supply of medicine . It comes to one hundred yuan . 
 Good . Here is the receipt . The dispensary is over there ... By the way , will this be covered by your insurance from work ? 
 In that case , I'll give you a certificate , so you can get it reimbursed . 
 Don't lose this receipt , because insurance companies are very difficult about helping when they don't have the right paperwork . 
 I ’ m a sales manager in a publishing company . 
 Oh , mostly fiction , lots of romance , science fiction , biography , stuff like that . 
 About two years now . 
 I need some stamps . 
 How much do I need for this letter ? 
 How much ? Is it overweight ? 
 How much is it , then ? 
 OK . Here you are . 
 not really . I wasn thinking of maybe going to a movie . Do you want to go with me ? 
 have you heard of Hot Fuzz ? 
 that's the one . It's an actioncomedy . What do you think ? 
 what do you have in mind ? 
 isn't that the chick flick with Kate Hudson and Owen Wilson ? 
 not really . Do you like biographical / drama films ? 
 Anne Hathaway is in a new movie called Becoming Jane which is based on a true story about Jane Austen . 
 it's on at 8: 00 pm at the Phoenix Theatres . I have a membership there , so I can book the tickets ahead of time . 
 sounds good . I'll see you then ! 
 Right over here , sir . What-size do you wear ? 
 These here are all mediums . 
 Shall I gift-wrap them for you , sir ? 
 Hey , what's good with you ? 
 I'm throwing a party on Friday . 
 Do you think you can come ? 
 What are you going to be doing ? 
 I was hoping you would come . 
 I'd better see you there . 
 Do you have laundry service ? 
 Well , would you please send someone to 502 ? I have some clothes to wash . 
 So will you back me up if things get ugly with Elvin ? 
 We just will.Trust me on that . 
 He'll do it . He's too proud not to . 
 Yes , I do . Everyone . 
 First , you have had an impressive growth record , ever since the company had been founded for half a century . Second , I can improve myself by working here . 
 Yes , I get it . Will the medical plan cover me while on duty ? 
 Yes , I have read . In the contract , I am expected to be available up to two hours past normal working hours . Is that right ? 
 That's exactly my understanding . 
 Mary , do you often do your shopping online ? 
 How about the price ? 
 Last week , I tried to buy some clothes online , but I didn ’ t know how to pay for them . 
 Are there many things online ? 
 Yes , I need more amenities . 
 You know , the things that are free , like the soap and the shampoo . 
 No , I still have plenty left , even if I took three baths a day . 
 I need to take home some souvenirs ! 
 Yes , souvenirs that I can take home and add to my collection . 
 Are you kidding ? Whoever heard of paying for hotel souvenirs ? 
 I was wondering if you could help me use the Student Job Center . 
 I want to work in a restaurant . 
 I want to work part-time . 
 Yes , I know what to do . 
 Yes , I think that would be great . 
 Would you like to take a look at the menu , sir ? 
 Would you care for a drink before you order ? 
 Yes , sir . I'll bring it over . Have you decided what you'd like , sir ? 
 What can I do for you ? 
 Well , this company can be dated back to 1893 , so it has a hundred years of history . 
 Hi , I was wondering if I could get my test results from the other day . 
 Is something wrong with me ? 
 Can we talk about it now ? 
 When can I come and see you ? 
 Now I know that something bad is up ! 
 May I help you ? 
 Which place are you most interested in ? 
 Well , I strongly suggest you going to London . It's really charming . 
 We have been here for about five days and I have to leave now . 
 Yes , we have a very pleasant time . Thank you for being so nice for us . 
 No , thanks . You've done a lot for us . Thank you for everything . 
 Oh ! Thank you ! It's very kind of you . 
 We're sure we will . And welcome to our corporation next year . We're expecting you . 
 Where are you going ? 
 Hey Joe , what are you doing in this department store ? 
 Why not ? When I go shoe shopping , I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices . 
 So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ? 
 Well , you ’ re in the right store . If they don ’ t have it , no one will . 
 What would you like ? 
 Sure . The first food you have is appetizer , followed by a soup . Then you will have the main course . The last dishes are desserts . 
 Okay , Rebecca . Now you ’ Ve given me a good idea of your work and academic background , but what about you as a person ? How would you describe your key strengths ? 
 Yes , true , but how about other personal qualities ? 
 What would you say is your most positive quality ? 
 Do I have to talk to the interviewer or just leave my application ? 
 What should I do in the fair ? 
 Are you engaged ? 
 I want sharing Company . 
 Do you have the letter of approval of employment ? 
 In that case , you are not allowed to work in China , until you get the employment petition . 
 Hello . 
 Hi , Troy . How ’ s your trip going ? 
 Are you all right ? 
 Yes . Everything is fine in the family . Don ’ t worry about the family . Just enjoy your trip . How ’ s the weather there ? 
 That ’ s good . Take good care of yourself . 
 I love you , Troy . 
 Why am I being charged $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered ? 
 Well , the file is wrong . I was at a great concert that night . 
 Thank you for taking care of it so quickly . 
 You can't do that ! You can't charge me for a mistake that you made ! 
 Well , now I've seen it all ! What a rip-off this place is ! 
 Our housing problem is a highly complicated issue . 
 Right . Like our LPF program . The mortgage size is linked with the amount of savings households have accumulated on their LPF accounts . 
 Like you and me ! 
 It's a great pleasure to meet you , Mr . White . I believe you have seen our exhibits in the showroom . What is it that particularly interests you ? 
 Thank you for your inquiry . Would you tell us what quantity you require so that we can work out the offer ? 
 Here are our FOB price lists . All the prices in the lists are subject to our confirmation . 
 As a rule we don't allow any commission . But if the order is sizable one , we will consider it . 
 We'll discuss this when you place your order with us . 
 Please I'd like a ticket to New York . 
 No , early saturday morning . 
 Nothing earlier ? I prefer flight at 9 thirty . 
 No , exactly not . 
 Sounds not good . I won't take it . 
 Do you know what the weather will be tomorrow ? We are planning to climb the mountain . 
 I hope so . Thank you . 
 Let me check . Oh , oh ! It ’ s at 3:25 . 
 It's at ... gate 14 . 
 OK , so here's the plan ; When we land , run to gate 14 ! 
 You taught at a local school for a year , right ? 
 Did you enjoy yourself there ? 
 So why did you decide to resign ? 
 I see . But why don't you continue to work as a teacher ? 
 So you can have more room for development . 
 It sounds like a good idea . 
 Hi , this is ABC Company . Is that Joseph ? 
 I am calling to tell you that the interview for you is in our company on Monday morning at 8: 00 . 
 It is on the Jianshe Street where there is a Carrefour Supermarket near it . 
 I think we can have a try . 
 I see . Is this the marvelous landscape in Guiling ? 
 Which do you prefer , the linen one , the figured dacron or the brocade ? 
 I ’ d like to send this parcel to Australia . 
 Sure . It ’ s not very heavy . 
 I see . What are the options ? I suppose airmail is faster and more expensive than surface mail . 
 How long will it take to get there ? 
 It that case , I ’ ll send it by airmail . I ’ d like to send it as a registered parcel . 
 Thanks very much . There ’ s thirteen dollars . 
 Do you have any luggage ? 
 Here's your boarding pass . Have a nice flight . 
 Hey , Ann , I am really sorry about last night . I shouldn't have said those things to you . 
 don't be silly . You guys should spend as much time together as you can . Besides we can go to the beach anytime . 
 well that's what being friends is about , isn't it ? 
 Nah , I wouldn't worry about that . But I don't want to be the third wheel . You two should have some quiet time to yourselves . 
 maybe ... I'll think about it . 
 OK . Do you want a trim , or do you want to get your hair done ? 
 Like that Rastafarian over there ? You mean dreadlocks ? You crazy ! That'll take way too long . 
 I'm gonna get a relaxer , then flip the ends up like Halle . 
 How many hours do you work a week ? 
 And how many weeks holiday do you get a year ? 
 Do you do overtime ? 
 How are you doing ? 
 What can I do for you today ? 
 Are you depositing cash or a check ? 
 How much are you depositing ? 
 What account do you want your money in ? 
 Do you need anything else ? 
 Beauties Picture , how may I help you ? 
 He's out of his office . 
 Hey , Devi , have you thought about where would you like to go to dinner on Friday for your birthday ? 
 You know , we could look online at the local Internet sites . 
 What kind of food would you like ? 
 This one , Shogun , looks good . 
 Would you like to go there then ? 
 Marry ; Mr . Johnson wants these documents to be copied . 
 I'm afraid ... 
 Can I help you ? 
 Two hundred and thirty yuan . 
 You can come later . 
 It's half past seven . 
 We offer 24 - hour service . 
 Excuse me , I'm looking for the Holiday Inn . Do you know where it is ?

 How far is it ? 
 How long does it take to get there ? 
 Is it close to the subway station ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Yes , I'll be with you in a minute . Here's your bill , sir . It's 480 yuan altogether . 
 That's for the wine . 
 Would you like to put it on your hotel bill ? 
 Your name and room number , please ? 
 May I have a look at your room card , Mr . Black ? 
 How's everything , Janice ? 
 Which company ? 
 Yep ! I got some , in which I am interested . But ... 
 YOU GET ME ! 
 Seemingly there is no turning back . I have to face it somehow . 
 It is really exciting news . 
 You don ’ t know ? The company is going to replace these old computers with the latest ones . 
 We will all get a docking station on our own desk from which you can remove your laptop easily . And if you come back to office , you just reconnect your laptop with docking station . 
 This is a kind of socket mounted to your desk . The socket has all the wire connections of the company line and all the other office automation equipments , like fax , copier , a screen , printer and scanner , and it will be very convenient . 
 We have a great variety of men's suits , sir.Which particular brand do you prefer ? 
 How about this one ? 
 I want to get in shape . I feel like a fence sitter-not really fat , but not really healthy . 
 Would you like to get in shape together ? 
 How about going to the gym ? There's one really close to work . 
 As a matter of fact , they are having a promotion right now . 
 Oh , my goodness . The traffic is crawling . 
 We are now running late . 
 Let me check and look at the map . Yes , there is an exit three quarters of a mile ahead . We ’ ll exit Market Street , head west , then get on the Pennsylvania Freeway . 
 Jenny , what's your favorite color ? 
 Now , we're going to draw an apple in your sketch book . What do we use ?

 Do you even know where this bus is supposed to go ? 
 Don't you know ? 
 Is this the right bus , or not ? 
 Where are we ? This is not Altadena . 
 Tell me what the street signs say . 
 Next time , I'll look for the bus myself . 
 Joy Chain elementary school , please . 
 How frustrating ! The bus is still not coming .

 Ok . Please go ahead . 
 Oh , we are skillful in doing that . You can trust us . Our shop has a history of more than 20 years .

 Now darling , I know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . I think we should sell it . 
 But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished . 
 Well , only you liked it really , darling . 
 That is the most boring , typical gift in the world ! 
 That's not exactly a conversation piece . It's so plain . 
 The diagonal black and red stripes are really conservative though ... 
 A fly-away tie ! What a riot ! 
 Yes , the food you have just sent here is cool.Would you please heat them up ? 
 That's fine . Quickly please , we are so hungry .

 Actually , it is my mother ’ s wedding . My parents divorced many years ago . Now she is ready to establish a new family . It is a special occasion . I've got to be there , right ? 
 Thank you so much . 
 Yes . Right now I have a studio .

 Will you still throw me out if I make the rent payment ? 
 I am going to take care of the rent payment right now . 
 Honey , I think I need to go see the doctor . 
 I was working in the garage and cut myself with my saw .

 How about the working hours ? 
 Can I ask for a leave ? 
 Are there any other jobs waiting for me in the future ? 
 That's OK . How can my salary be improved ?

 Here you are . 
 Thank you so much . 
 Look ! It fits you perfectly . It looks great on you and has your name on it . 
 Devi , do you have any preference for where you would like to go for dinner for your birthday ? 
 There is a great restaurant directory here in the weekend section of the newspaper . 
 Do you have a particular type of food that you would like ? 
 That Japanese restaurant , Shogun , got good reviews . 
 Would that be a place that you might like to go to for your birthday ? 
 Hello , Steven . Annie said that you and Julia have had a quarrel , haven ’ t you ? 
 That's the reason why you fought ? 
 You two are always quarrelling over little things . 
 Are you still mad at her now ? 
 Will you apologize to her ? 
 Hello ? 
 Yes . 
 Not too bad , thanks . And you ? 
 I'm terribly sorry , but I've already made arrangements for Wednesday . 
 That would be fine . 
 Whenever is suitable for you . I have no plans for that day . 
 And where would you like to meet ? 
 I'm not very familiar with Chinese cuisine . What can you recommend ? 
 Of course ! Peking Duck is world-famous . I would love to try it . 
 All right . Well , I'll see you later . 
 What does Human Resources Department do ? 
 They take care of a lot of things . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Yes ? 
 OK . 
 I see . 
 I ’ m going to put it on this table , Sam . 
 What are you going to do with it ? 
 Be careful . Don ’ t drop it ! Don ’ t put it there , Sam . Put it here , on this shelf . 
 Those flowers are lovely , too . 
 No trouble . I enjoyed helping you . 
 OK , no problem . Have you found the blank ones ? 
 Yes , well put your name on it after you have downloaded it off the company website . OK ? 
 You fill in the hours and total them for the week . Have you ever used a 24 hour clock ? 
 So after you noted the hours , starting at zero which is midnight , you just write down the minutes as a dot followed by minutes . Get it ? 
 Just make sure you show your total , sign it , and turn it in . 
 You are a quick learner . I don't think you'll have any trouble with this . 
 In April or early May . 
 In that case , we will have to improve one month further on the time . Now is Jan . If the fertilizers should be shipped before the end of March , only 2 months are left . The time is too limited . 
 All right . You can rest assured that we will do everything possible to advance shipment . The fertilizers will be delivered before April . 
 Yes , what kinds of wine do you have ? 
 Thank you . Please bring us a bottle of dry white wine . 
 Happy to meet with you . Now , do you prefer group projects ? 
 Do you value a steady job more or one that offers a chance to move ahead ? 
 Could you work for us in another state , if need be ? 
 How much do you need to make per year ? 
 Yikes ! Thanks for your interest in this job . We ’ ll be getting back to you . 
 I think something must be done . 
 I agree with you . Only in this way can we ease the traffic problems . 
 Yes , Christine ? 
 Sure . You just walk down this hallway . The copy room is the second room on the right . 
 What happened ? 
 Ben , we ’ re fifteen . What kind of job are you looking for ? 
 Uh-huh . 
 I think this painting would look good in our living room . What do you think ? 
 Hi Michael . 
 I'm looking for the airport . Can you tell me how to get there ? 
 I think I can take the subway to the airport . Do you know where the subway is ? 
 Where ? I don't see it . 
 Oh , I see it now . Thanks . 
 Do you know if there's a restroom around here ? 
 Thank you . 
 Mr . Wang , have you enjoyed your stay here ? 
 We ’ Ve all enjoyed being with you . When will you come back ? 
 I ’ m looking forward to seeing you again . Take care . 
 I'm looking for some fresh produce that's on sale . 
 Mangoes . What are they ? 
 Can you eat the nut ? 
 How much are they ? 
 What does a mango taste like ? 
 How do I know if it's ripe ? 
 Where do they come from ? 
 Yes , I think there is something wrong with my car . 
 When I tried to back it , I found it was out of order . I can't see where the trouble is . 
 Is it serious ? 
 And when will it be OK ? 
 OK . Thank you . 
 Very good . I feel quite refreshed now ! You should come with me sometime - exercise is good for you ! 
 I just ran alongside the main road . 
 Oh ok , I ’ ll try that tomorrow . It ’ ll probably be better than fighting with the traffic ! Go on , why don ’ t you come along ? 
 May I come in ? 
 How are you doing , sir ? 
 Please allow me to introduce myself . My name is Li Hua . Nice to meet you . 
 May I help you at all ? 
 We certainly do . I can give you some details about a loan called Personal Loan for Studying Abroad . We offer this to anyone who will study outside this country . 
 This loan is specially provided for people who are studying overseas to pay for their tuition fee and other sundry items . 
 That's right . The sundries could include accommodation , text books and so on . The guidelines are not so strict , you see . 
 Do you play mahjong ? 
 How can I be sure your products are of superior quality , as you promised ? 
 But a quality inspection system does not mean that each unit will always be up to the standard . 
 Your salesman also told me that each worker is trained to do quality analysis . Can you tell me a little about that ? 
 You are from the travel agency , aren't you ? 
 Yes , I am . Are you Miss Li from the travel agency ? 
 Do you mind telling me your name ? 
 Yes , it is . I usually travel light . 
 Sure , and I'm glad to meet you . Thanks for your help . 
 Fine . Do you want your windshield cleaned ? 
 It comes to $ 15 . 
 Yeah . If you are available now , let me describe your work duties , OK ? 
 As a newcomer , you are going to be responsible for some basic tasks first , including certain routine duties like answering the telephone and typing . Later , you will be assigned to the Sales Department . 
 For this is your first day in our company , you can begin with our special products . Before you do your job , it's necessary for you to be familiar with our own products . Sort these papers and file them correctly . 
 Can I help you ? 
 I'll certainly try to help you . What topic is your paper on ? 
 There are several possible sources you might use for that topic . I suggest you use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television . 
 This section of the store is called Junior . Why is that ? 
 But I can't find anything in my size here . 
 Well , there's nothing I can do about my height ! 
 What's in the petite section ? 
 Taxi ! 
 Beijing International Airport . Would you please help me with my baggage ? 
 Thank you . I've got just 50 minutes to go . Can we manage ? 
 I can't afford to miss my 9:40 flight . 
 IBA , Client Services Department . Shelley speaking , how can I help ? 
 Certainly , that's what we're here for . What can I help you with ? 
 Calm down , Sir . Is that an IBA Debit or Credit Card ? 
 Just calm down , Sir . OK , when do you think you lost it ? 
 That's fine , Sir . Let me just take some details FRCM you and we can help you . 
 Sir , how can I help you ? 
 OK , please take a seat . Look at here . Head up . Done . 
 Do you like traveling by train or by plane ? 
 Are you a social person ? 
 What is your strategy in communicating with colleagues ? 
 Good morning , Wilson Association . 
 I'm sorry , but Mr.Tomas left here just a few minutes ago . 
 I'm afraid not . He is away for the rest of the day . 
 I'm afraid not , he has gone out of this town on business . May I take a message ? 
 Would you like to make another appointment ? 
 I see . I'll tell Mr.Tomas you've called . 
 Oh man ! I ’ Ve been starving myself for days now and I haven ’ t lost an ounce ! 
 Yeah , my friend is getting married next month and I ’ m supposed to be a bridesmaid . I have to fit into my dress and look nice for her wedding , but I haven ’ t lost any weight ! Look at these love handles . 
 Why ? If I eat less , then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves , right ? 
 So you are saying that I should eat , but I should just watch what I eat ? 
 If I do all this do you think I can lose twenty pounds in four weeks ? 
 Thank you all for coming to our monthly staff correlation meeting . Today we have a lot of new things to introduce to you all , there will be a lot of changes in company policy to accommodate better employee welfare .

They will also be encouraged to maintain proper physical health with a company sponsored aerobics class on Friday nights .

Michelle Cain to our team as our company ’ s ombudsman . 
 Yes , that ’ s right . From now on , whenever you have a question or concern regarding anything that happens during the work day , Ms . Cain will be your advocate .

 But I can't resist a good dinner .

 Are you more a follower or a leader ? 
 May I speak to Marry ? 
 Ok , I'll try her back then . 
 What's your products ' competitive edge ? 
 We need your detail explanation . 
 It sounds good , and how about its quality ? We only look for the best . 
 OK ! How long dose it take you to deliver if we order 1000 pieces of silk ? 
 What dressing would you like on the salad ? 
 I beg your pardon ? 
 Sorry , it's not available now.Anything else ? 
 Will you say it again ? 
 Do you carry black ink ? 
 I've looked for , but I didn't see any black ink . 
 Well , I'll settle for blue-black . I'll also take a dozen airmail envelopes . 
 Give me a package of twenty , then . And where do I find shoelaces ?

 What position have you held before ? 
 Would you tell me the general description of your present job ? 
 What made you decide to change your job ? 
 Why do you leave your present company ?

 Did you already wash your clothes today ? 
 Could you wash some of my dark clothes with yours ? 
 The only thing is that they have to be washed on the gentle cycle . 
 There aren't a lot of clothes , do you have a lot to wash ? 
 You don't mind , do you ? 
 Okay , thanks a lot . 
 Does this dress look OK on me ? 
 Well , I think that one fits me better . What's the price ? 
 So where is this mystery restaurant that we are going to ? 
 That sounds great ! I am craving some type of beef dish . 
 I see , so what are we having ? Chicken ? 
 Sounds good ! I have always heard that Indian spices give a rich flavor to food . 
 What about veggies ? 
 It all sounds exquisite ! I can ' t wait ! 
 If you want to live much longer you have to give up smoking . 
 Maybe with the choice of life or death before you , you will find it easier . 
 See all these black areas ? That's tar built up in your Lungs . 
 Look at it this way , when you quit , you will save money , time and your life ! 
 Yes , I'm looking for a cap . Size 16 . 
 Yes . It's a bit tight . Have you got a bigger one ? 
 Yes , that's fine . I'll take it . Can I pay by check ? 
 It's Sunday today . 
 I think we should have a house cleaning today . What's your opinion ? 
 Come on . What do you want to do ? Washing clothes or cleaning the house ? 
 Okay . Here is the laundry . 
 Don't worry . I'll help you with it later . 
 OK . Let me send a memo around . 
 I don ’ t think he ’ s back today . 
 I know , it ’ s a big one . 
 We have a great selection . What decade are you looking for ? 
 We have six . 
 Actually , two of them have dancing figures . 
 A good choice . I prefer that one myself . 
 Oh , no , I'm afraid not . These things are just too old to guarantee anything . 
 Even if they break down , they're still works of art . 
 I've already started . 
 This afternoon . 
 We haven't decided yet . Could you give us a little longer ? 
 Can we get something to drink ? We want two bottles of beer . 
 Could you tell us your specials today ? 
 We'll take this steak dinner . 
 Peas and carrots . 
 Icecream , please . 
 I had the soup and bruschetta which all together is £ 4.50 and my trout for the main course was £ 12 . 
 Yes and shall we go fifty-fifty for the wine ? 
 So now your bill comes to £ 20.15 and I need to pay £ 22.50 . 
 And is that all ? 
 So now my bill is £ 24.50 and yours come to £ 23.65 . Is that correct ? 
 I think £ 5 would be good . 
 Speaking . May I ask whom I am talking to ? 
 Oh , yes . I remember your company . 
 I'd like to , but I'm afraid that my schedule is full this week . 
 Am . How about 10 a . m . on next Friday ? 
 All right , expecting you . 
 I studied at Anshan University . 
 Yes , I interned with an accounting firm during tax season . 
 Yes , but I learned a lot . 
 I learned about different tax laws and how they work . 
 Yes , Mary ? 
 Are you telling me you're not going to meet with me ? 
 Well , I don't like it , but I guess I don't have any choice . 
 OK , I'll go to your office at that time . 
 Good afternoon , Mr . Black . Haven't seen you for a long time . Can I help you ? 
 Let me see if he is free . Would you please sit down and wait for a moment ? 
 The manager will come to see you in a few minutes . 
 You are welcome . 
 That's a good idea ! So you don't need to worry about it . 
 It's OK . You could send an email to the employer via the internet . 
 You could inquire about the results directly , but should be politely . 
 I think the letter of inquiry should be written briefly . If it's too long , I'm afraid the employer won't have time to read it . 
 After you send the letter of inquiry , you should pay close attention not to miss any reply . 
 Excuse me , Mr . Rodriguez ? Could I speak with you for a moment ? 
 Well , I ’ d like to talk about my new contract with you , if that ’ s all right . 
 George , did you remember to buy the book ? 
 When will you buy it then ? 
 Well , I ’ d better get back to work . I ’ Ve got a ton of stuff on my desk ! 
 Yeah , definitely . I was hoping to catch a ride with you . 
 The boss had an informal discussion with me this morning , I feel really down . 
 Well , actually I failed to meet a deadline last week and I forgot to answer an e-mail for a VIP customer yesterday . 
 Yes , everything . I feel overwhelmed by the daily work . Sometimes , I just can ’ t focus on what I am doing . What is worse , though I make plans for a whole week , I always have to make changes later on because other things come up . I can ’ t manage my time well . I can ’ t handle work well . I am afraid I was screw up more things . 
 Well , I will try . 
 Excuse me , madam ! You parked in the handicapped spot . 
 Don't tell me you lost it . 
 That was quick . 
 Oh , there is something wrong with my car . 
 I want to change a new car . I like Honda best , especially the red one.But it is too expensive . 
 Yeah.Maybe I can find my favorite car in addition to Honda . 
 Those are today ’ s top stories . Now let ’ s go to John for the weather . John , what does the forecast look like for our weekend travelers ? 
 That ’ s pretty chilly for the summer ! Will it rain on Saturday ? 
 That certainly sounds like a dreary Saturday . 
 Thanks John , and there you have it ! Looks like it ’ s a weekend to stay at home ! 
 Yes , just over there . 
 Yes , they are just next to the newspapers actually . 
 Come on , darling . We haven't got much time . 
 Half past six ... and it's half past six already . 
 We haven't . Hurry up ! 
 And about time too ! 
 Sure . I'll be there as soon as I finish this document . 
 OK . 
 I'm sorry to say that we have to let you go , John . 
 Well , you're working very hard but not efficiently . And you don't work well with other employees . 
 I'm afraid it's too late . We are downsizing our workforce and you'll have to go . 
 We can give you the option of residing rather than being fired , because it will look better on your resume when you apply for another job if you resign . 
 All right , but let me know your decision before the end of the day . 
 No problem . What ’ s wrong ? 
 Where is the pipe ? 
 Can you tell me how long the pipe has been leaking ? 
 You do realize that I will need to rip down your wall to get to the pipe , right ? 
 Is that all right ? 
 I ’ ll get started on it now . 
 Sure . Why don ’ t you try it on ? The fitting room is over there . 
 I ’ m thinking about buying this sweater . I know it ’ s june now , but it will be perfect for autumn and winter . 
 Yes , it ’ s half price . It ’ s supposed to be too large-that ’ s the fashion . 
 There . It looks great , don ’ t you think ? I ’ m going to get these jeans as well . I need a new pair . I need a new pair . I ‘ m also going to buy this scarf ready for winter . 
 Don ’ t worry . I ’ Ve got my credit card . You can pay me back later . 
 These two sections need to be re-written , Jerry . The last guy that did this really mixed things up . 
 Not until next week , I think , the 15th . 
 Flight BE 407 to Rome is delayed . Will passengers please wait in the lounge ? 
 The time of departure will be announced as soon as possible . 
 Which department do you want to register with ? 
 Please pay the registration fee , 10 Yuan . 
 Is this our bus stop ? 
 Dude , where are we at ? 
 I thought this was the right stop . 
 Did you make us get off early ? 
 I should not have listened to you . 
 Now we have to walk . 
 Good morning , madam . Can I help you ? 
 Our jackets are over here next to coats and accessories . 
 Of course . The changing rooms are over there . 
 can I see these silk ties ? 
 I ’ ll take this one . 
 No , thank you . I want to have a look at that scarf . 
 Oh . I like this one . I have been looking for this color and design . Please wrap it for me , and I ’ ll take it . 
 I noticed there ’ s a jam a few blocks away . 
 I ’ m afraid I ’ ll be late . 
 Yup , I think so . The car ’ s packed , we have munchies and music , and the map ’ s in the car . 
 Got it ! Did you fill up the tank ? 
 You ’ re sure we ’ re not forgetting anything ? 
 Well , let ’ s get going then ! I love road trips ! 
 But we ’ Ve only been on the road for ten minutes . 
 Excuse me , have you got any laundry ? The laundryman is here to collect it . 
 Anything else ? 
 Are they to be dry-cleaned ? 
 Yes , but not too stiff , right ? 
 There are a few spots on it . I am afraid you will not have it tomorrow . Dry-cleaning usually takes three days . 
 In that case , I suppose I could ask the dry-cleaner to clean up the spots for the moment , and have it well pressed . You might get it back on time then . 
 By the way , a cotton came off your shirt you gave me the day before yesterday . 
 The laundry has sewed on a new button for you . 
 I am afraid the new one is not exactly the same as the others . 
 If you have any more laundry , please just leave it in the laundry bag behind the bathroom door . The laundryman comes to collect it every morning . 
 I do hope this undesirable incident will not stand in the way of our future business . 
 I'm going to take a nap . 
 That's a good idea . 
 No , thanks . Just let me sleep until I wake up . 
 Okay . I think I'll be awake by then . 
 You mean I will smell the food cooking ? 
 I don't think I'm going to dream about anything . I'm really tired . 
 I really feel like eating a salad . 
 I'm really not sure . 
 Caesar salads are pretty good . 
 I want a salad with some chicken . 
 I like my salads to have croutons , almonds , and shredded cheese . 
 You should make a salad like that . 
 I want to buy a rain coat . Could you please show me one ? 
 I like yellow best . How much does it cost ? 
 It's nice , but that's very steep for a rain coat . Could you give me a 20 percent discount ? 
 In that case , I don't think I'll buy one here . 
 I have no idea . 
 I've told you a thousand times . I don't want to go in the Haunted House.It ' s too scary ! 
 Go alone if you want . I will wait at that cafe and have a soda . 
 I know . But if you don't go in the Haunted House , you won't be happy.So I will wait for you . It's no problem . 
 How was it ? 
 Don't worry about it . But how was it ? 
 I am sorry , sir . All the tables have been booked . 
 Would you mind waiting in the lounge for 10 minutes ? I am sure I can arrange you a table then . 
 Hello , Mr Mayhew . How are you today ? 
 Would you like a balance inquiry first , Mr Mayhew ? 
 Your balance is 21,290 RIB . How much would you like to take out today ? 
 Actually , I have a suggestion for you . We've started a new service called Entrusting Deposit Combination - Have you heard about this ? 
 Excuse me , I'm afraid you've parked in the wrong spot . 
 No , it's D408 , my parking space . I have already paid for it . 
 It's no big deal . Thank you . 
 Off hand , I'd say the Reader's Digests is my favorite . 
 It's instructive and inspiring . 
 No , it's a semimonthly . 
 Yes , it's so popular that it's sold out as soon as it reaches the bookstores . 
 I lost track of time , am I late ? 
 My friend needed me to help him . 
 I will try . My apologies . 
 Sure , I'll sit right here . 
 I am confused about the projected revenues . 
 Jimmy , I ’ d like to wear this robe for tonight cocktail party . What do you think of it ? 
 What ? But it is my favorite piece of clothing . 
 What am I going to do ? 
 Is this the right bus for the Grand Hotel ? 
 Where can I take it ? 
 May I help you ? 
 Well . Can you tell me how much you have deposited ? 
 Please let me have your name and your savings account number if you remember it . 
 Don't worry , Mr . Brown . Let me try to check it for you . One moment , please . Yes , I have your account number here . The balance is exactly RIB 12,000 
 It's my pleasure . Please fill out this lost passbook bill and list the code word you used when you first opened your account . 
 So your mom can stop nagging you now . 
 Don't tell me she's been listening to the fortune-teller again . 
 The day we choose to get married could never be an unlucky day . 
 I heard Nick found a job in a bank and his salary is said very high . I also want to work there . 
 I know that , but making a lot of money makes me crazy . 
 Actually , I am afraid I will be stuck in the job forever , if I choose a bad one . 
 Room Service . May I help you ? 
 Have you switched on the radiator ? 
 We're terribly sorry for that . We'll send our staff io fix it now . Or do you want to change your room ? 
 OK . Is it convenient for us to come now ? 
 How's your job search going ? 
 have you finished compiling your resume ? 
 that's good . Don't forget to design the format . An attractive format is as important as the content . 
 good . How about your cover letter ? 
 no , a CV is not enough . You should also attach it with a cover letter . Don't overlook it . You're faced with fierce competition in the job market . If your cover letter cannot stand out in the pile of 
 yes , you're right . All your preparation efforts are to help you land a job interview . 
 I've been told you might have a vacant room . 
 Would it be okey to look at the room , now ? 
 This apartment looks nice . 
 How much is the rents ? 
 This apartment is nice , but I'd like to find a cheaper one . 
 Oh , yes . I reviewed your estimate . But it seems like the project blueprint you sent with the estimate is not quite what we had in mind . Did you get a copy of the specs for this project ? 
 No . Later we decided to opt for the prior outline , version 7 . 
 Home at last . Tonight we have a lot of homework though . 
 To tell the truth , I don ’ t really like him either . He ’ s kind of boring and not very active . He always looks unhappy too . 
 Do you think we should be talking about him like this behind his back ? 
 I absolutely agree . It ’ s getting dark . We should finish our homework now . 
 Mr . Reynolds ? Rick Murphy . I ’ m the accounting manager for Macmillan and Emory , Incorporated . 
 I would like to meet with you to discuss some discrepancies on our payroll account . 
 Shall I make some coffee , Jane ? 
 It's ready . Do you want any milk ? 
 What about some sugar ? Two teaspoonfuls ? 
 Would you like some more ? 
 Of course . I think there are a few in that box . 
 What a pity ! 
 Have a biscuit instead . Eat more and smoke less ! 
 Do you like chocolates ? 
 Do you like coffee ? 
 And do you like English food ? 
 Hi.Mike . 
 Fine , thanks.And you ? 
 This will be your office here . 
 We try to get everyone in the upper management team a nice office . 
 I'm glad you like it . 
 Yes , we have a coffee machine and some other beverages in the break room . 
 It's just down the hall , the fourth door on your right . 
 You can always call me if you need anything and I will get it for you . 
 What are you thinking ? 
 It ’ s about 7 o ’ clock . let ’ s have our breakfast first . 
 What do you want ? 
 Sorry , I didn ’ t prepare this . 
 Ok , I ’ ll have it sent to you immediately . 
 don't you think it ’ s a bit bright ? 
 that dress looks lovely on you , but it ’ s not very practical , is it ? 
 I like the jeans , but you need something to go with the top . It ’ s too plain on its own . 
 that might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ? 
 thanks . You ’ d be ok on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ? 
 that looks great . Just one more thing---you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ? 
 no , they ’ re a Prada knock-off for 1/10 of the price of the real thing . 
 if I were you , I ’ d buy that now while it ’ s on sale . If you spend more than $ 100 , you get a $ 50 voucher for more clothes . 
 OK . I just saw a Versace for thirty dollars . This stuff can't be real ! 
 I'm not sure I'd want to give these people my credit card number . 
 Sure , but it's so complicated . They asked for my credit card authorization number . 
 I have trouble understanding all these forms ... but I'm sure I'll get it . 
 Yes , I have read the Filling Instruction carefully , since you showed me it last week . 
 The essence of filing I remember is to bring together in a single folder or file all papers relating to a particular subject . And outgoing and incoming letters are kept in this file cabinet . 
 And each file should be named clearly , either in block capitals or in jet black typed capitals . 
 A card index is very important in the filing system . It is a most helpful friend to a secretary , so it must be kept handy and up to date . 
 Mom , will you tuck me in tonight ? 
 I hope I don't have any nightmares tonight . 
 Thanks for tucking me , Mom . 
 Not really . What ’ s up ? 
 I ’ m kind of useless in that area , but I ’ ll take a look at it . 
 Excuse me.Could you please tell me where the train station is ? 
 Excuse me.Would you like a drink before your meal ? 
 Would you like a drink ? 
 OK.Here you are . 
 Well , all the drinks including beer are free of charge . 
 Don't worry.We will come back again a little later . 
 Sure , if you're done ! 
 Well , listen , Honey , you've been a big help lately ... 
 If you take out the garbage and do the dishes , I'll think about it . 
 Nothing in life is free , Son . 
 Excuse me , please show me that business suit , the dark one . 
 May I try it on ? 
 What kind of account do you prefer ? Checking account or savings account ? 
 Ok , please just fill out this form and show us your ID card . 
 Is my car ready yet ? 
 It's LF 312 G . 
 I bought it here three days ago . 
 Have your mechanics finished yet ? 
 Well , it was my car . 
 That's right . I drove it into a lamp post . Can your mechanics repair it ? 
 may i ask you for a dance . 
 you dance it very well . do you often go dancing ? 
 We're interested in your Drawn Works . What about the supply position ? 
 Here's our inquiry list . You'll find the required items , specifications and quantities all there . 
 I don't need to remind you that the market has become very competitive . 
 That's fine . By the way , do you quote FOB or CIF ? 
 Then would you please make your prices CIF including five percent ? 
 Good morning . 
 Never mind , come right in . I've almost finished.You always keep the room neat and tidy , I must say.It saves me a lot of work , but you should let me do it . 
 It's very considerate of you to do so.Do you have any laundry today ? 
 Let me have it , please . I'm taking some laundry downstairs anyway . 
 I'm afraid he's having an important meeting now . Can I help you ? 
 Of course , he would . Would you leave them with me ? 
 We're thinking of ordering some special styles of summer clothes . We should be interested in your products if they are of the styles we want . 
 How long would it take you to deliver the orders ? 
 Good . I'll send your catalogues to those who are interested . Meanwhile , may I have an indication of price ? Can I have your price-sheet ? 
 Thank you for agreeing to come in and meet with us today . 
 I can see from your resume you were in charge of sales for Corporate World Unlimited from 1997 to 1999 . Can you please tell me about your responsibilities ? 
 What , do you believe , are some of the key attributes that helped you to achieve such an outstanding increase in sales ? 
 This broth is wonderful . What's in it ? 
 Hey ! Watch out ! You're using the same spoon for both broths ! 
 You're getting that hot stuff in my mild broth ! 
 what are you doing ? 
 you really like brains that make you think , don't you ? 
 I guess the games I like the most are the ones that I'm good at ! 
 well , I like to play darts . Whenever I go to a bar , I usually play for a few hours . 
 my parents used to love to play checkers and dominoes . We used to have family tournaments every weekend . 
 not at all . I never really did , to be honest . What about you ? Did your family used to play games together ? 
 some of my friends play cards on the internet . Have you ever tried that ? 
 how about mah-jong ? 
 I thought everyone in your country were experts at mah-jong ! 
 How can I help you ? 
 Did you have anything specific in mind ?

 We have a very wide selection of colors.And our eye shadow is specially designed to moisturize the skin.So it is very gentle on your eyelids . Would you like to sample some ? 
 I can help you with that . 
 Hello , I ’ d like to speak to Kate . 
 It ’ s ok . I ’ ll call her back latter . Thank you . 
 Your prices seem a little high . 
 We make a counter-offer to you of $ 150 per metric ton F . O . B . London . 
 OK . We will increase our order . 
 I'm glad that we've settled the price . 
 I'd like to open a new account . 
 Yes . And I've brought some documents along with me , too . Do you need to see my passport ? 
 Yes . Does the checking account come with a debit card ? 
 That's very convenient . 
 Yes . What's the maximum amount that you are allowed to have in an overdraft ? 
 Is there a penalty for having an overdraft ? 
 That's true . Is everything alright with my documents ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Mrs . Reynolds ? This is Martin Gross calling . 
 Well , I ’ Ve got the spread sheets you asked for , but I ’ m still waiting on some data from accounting . 
 We ’ re going to the Dragon Boat Festival tomorrow . Feel like coming along ? 
 Really ? I think you ’ ll love it . 
 Do you want to settle the bill now ? 
 Yes , we do . 
 Do you have any identification ? 
 Fine . 
 I don ’ t think so , Mr . Parsons . I think you have covered all the main points for me . 
 Great . Rmm , when can I expect to hear from you ? 
 That sounds perfect . Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me Mr . Parsons . 
 I hope to hear from you very soon . 
 Would you mind telling me the purpose of your visit to the U . K . ? 
 May I see your passport ? 
 Would you please open the suitcase ? What are these ? 
 Do you have anything to declare ? 
 OK , you're through now . 
 Yes , Mr . Smith ? 
 No , it will be another hour . 
 Of course . It's the best one I have here---and it's only 300 yuan . 
 Really ? Even for such an excellent one ? 
 I like the apartment , but I see something wrong with it . 
 There ’ s a leaking faucet in the sink . 
 That leak is going to raise my water bill . 
 You need to fix it . 
 I won ’ t rent it if the faucet isn ’ t fixed . 
 I ’ m glad you finally agree . 
 There are many famous resorts in Egypt . You can have a good time here . 
 I'm afraid two days isn't enough for you to see all the places of interest . 
 If I were you , the pyramid would be my first choice . It's so magnificent . 
 You needn't worry about it . There are many stores at the scenic spots . I'm sure you can get what you want . 
 Good afternoon , miss , can I help you ? 
 It ’ s certainly a pretty dress . I can ring you up at the register over here . 
 Will you be paying by cash , check , or credit card ? 
 Sorry , no . We only take MasterCard or Visa . 
 Very well , ma ’ am . Oh , there seems to be a problem , it says it ’ s rejected . 
 Alright . Thank you . Yes , it seems to be working fine . Your total is $ 199.00 , sign here , please . 
 Here you go , and here ’ s your receipt . Have a nice day . 
 Excuse me , can you help me figure out how to get to the Wudaokou subway station from here ? 
 An after I buy the ticket , where should I go ? 
 So I transfer from red to blue , then how long do I ride the blue ? 
 It sounds so complicated ! 
 Fred , we're gonna have a meeting after half an hour . Have you got it ? 
 Hush ! The wall has ears , you know . 
 My boy . I give you my sympathy to you . However , this meeting is said to be extremely important , so we have to attend it . 
 It is to give honors and promotions to some colleagues who made outstanding performance last year . 
 Look , the printer isn ’ t functioning well . I ’ Ve pushed the start button . It is suppose to be working now but it remains like a log . What ’ s going on ? 
 I didn ’ t pay attention to that . I will try to get the paper out . 
 I want to offer you more invoking stock options . 
 Let me explain . To get more cash , I'll have to borrow more from Vital , the venture capitalists . 
 Exactly . Instead of increasing their position , I want to increase yours .

 Well . We ’ re expecting about twenty-five people and we ’ d like to spend no more than $ 20 a head . 
 sure . I ’ d be happy to give you some hints and advice . 
 it looks good to me . I would suggest that you put the client ’ s logo and our logo on each page . The bosses seem to like that . 
 why don ’ t you use a different font the headings ? They ’ ll be more distinct . 
 I think you ’ Ve included all the essential things . You might want to make the conclusion a little longer . Restate your reasons clearly . 
 definitely ! I would include one or two on each page if possible . Remember that you should make the report as eye-catching as possible .

 Hi . What can I get for you ? 
 Good choice ! Our ground beef is extra lean , if you know what I mean . 
 No , no no no chicken breasts at the moment , but we have some nice chicken thighs . 
 Okay , is there anything else ? 
 Yes ! It ’ s very fine meat ! Made it myself ... 
 Wait ! We have T-bone , rib eye , and sirloin steaks . They are very fresh ! Just came from the slaughter house ... 
 Okay . That will be thirty-four dollars and fifty cents . 
 It's 800 US dollars per kilo CIF five percent Hamburg . 
 Why ? This is a fair market price . 
 Then what leads you to think that we have to reduce our price ? Please tell me candidly . 
 We give you quotations on the same basis as we quote in the domestic market . 
 But even with the overhead out , the export overhead must be put in . Finally , it comes to the same thing . Anyway , this is a quality item and should be sold on its value .

 Yes . There is one more thing . 
 The mini bar door was open when I checked in . I didn ’ t use it . Could you send someone to check it out ?

 It fits you to a T . 
 Cash or charge ? 
 Sign here , please . 
 Good-bye , and thank you for shopping here . 
 Where exactly are you coming from ? 
 Do you have a problem walking a little bit ? 
 If you walk down Fair Oaks to Altadena Drive , you can catch the 267 . 
 Make sure to catch it going west . 
 You get off on Del Mar and Hill . 
 Don't mention it . 
 I've always got room for something sweet ! 
 I've never tried traditional Greek yogurt , so I want to try that first . 
 I believe they add locally produced honey to it . 
 do you want to try some of my yogurt . It's a favorite everyday dessert in Greece . 
 what do you think ? How does it taste ? 
 sure . I'll just have a bite . 
 it's absolutely delicious ! That is the best tiramisu I've ever had ! 
 ok . I've had one of those before . They're really sweet and crunchy . 
 I believe they are a local delicacy in the South . 
 yeah , why not ? We've already pigged out as it is ! 
 Mr . Chen , I have a Marry from realty world on line one . 
 OK , I'll take a message . 
 How do you get along with your boss ? 
 What do you think is important in your work ? 
 Can you help me find my books ? 
 Oh , I see . Thank you . 
 Of course ! I am very interested to know how my child is doing and also get some insight from you as to how he can improve . 
 I guess he gets that from me , I never did well in math when I was a kid . What can I do at home to compliment what he is learning in the classroom . 
 Thanks a lot ! I will definitely do that . Is there anything else ? 
 Oh yes , I ... 
 I went to Yale University . 
 I have a B . A . in Economics . 
 I'm twenty-seven . 
 Yes , I have worked in a bank for the last five years . 
 I got $ 500 a week . 
 Sure . 
 I'll have a go . 
 Yes ? 
 Certainly . Go along Queen's Road ... 
 Yes , and turn right at the Hilton Hotel . 
 Then go up Garden Road , past the Cathedral . 
 Yes . Then cross the road at the next traffic lights . The Peak Tram is straight ahead . You can't miss it . 
 Yes . Why ? 
 Is there anything I can do for you , Mr . King ? 
 Is it all right for you to pay the bill this evening ? 
 At the Cashier's Counter of our hotel , right in the lobby downstairs . 
 All right . Is your companion leaving for Shanghai with you ? 
 Shall I make out a single bill or two separate bills ? 
 OK . I'll surely have the bill ready for this evening . 
 No problem . By the way , do you have any comment to make on our hotel ? 
 Thank you for your compliments . You're welcome to our hotel again . 
 I heard that Kevin got divorced . Is that true ? 
 What ? 
 Poor Kevin , we should do something for him . He is a nice guy and does his job well . 
 Hello , I am calling to confirm my reservation for a single room . 
 This Friday . 
 That's right . Thank you . 
 What kind of cottons are they ? May I see your list ? Ah , machine prints . 
 I see . And the quantities . 
 How many rolls altogether ? 
 Six weeks , did you say ? 
 We could manage the plain rolls in six weeks . The prints might be put off to eight weeks . 
 That's the best we can do just now , I'm afraid . 
 What about taking the prints in two shipments ? Two thousand rolls in seven weeks , and the remained a week later . 
 Yes , I'll see that you get those delivery . Shipping by ' S . S . American ' as usual , is that all right ? 
 When can we expect your confirmation of the order ? 
 All right . 
 Thirty minutes or 30 seconds , sir , it doesn't matter , I'm ready for you . 
 There's nothing like getting an early start , sir . 
 You can leave your baggage in our storage space , with a deposit . 
 I wish it was , but it isn't . They will still want a credit card . 
 Don't forget that you have very little time , sir , before you have to check out . 
 Yeah.And I'm going by bus . 
 But both my wife and I prefer taking a bus . 
 to be honest , I don't really care for either one . 
 I used to play basketball when I was little , and I never scored a goal . Every time I watch a basketball game , I think about how horrible I was at it . 
 how about you ? What's your favorite sport of all time ? 
 have you ever seen a live game ? 
 I've never really understood the game . 
 thanks , that'd be nice . When's the next ice hockey game on ? 
 that's a good idea . 
 Excuse me . I would like to purchase some travelers ' checks . 
 $ 5000 and I want them all in fifties . 
 Thank you . 
 I think you should buy a bottle of moisturizer . 
 Yes . It will keep your face from getting dry and make your skin soft . 
 Hi . You called and said I should come in . It's about some documents that have arrived for Nobut Foods . 
 Oh great ! We've been waiting for those . Is everything alright with them ? 
 No , everything has to be perfect . 
 I'd like to open a savings account . Can you tell me how to do it ? 
 I have a driver's licence , a membership card and my passport . Will they do ? 
 What's the minimum amount I can deposit in an account ? 
 Thank you . 
 What's up ? 
 It is really good news . How much do you earn a week now ? 
 Darling , I know you are a good husband . You don't have to work so hard . After all your health is the most important . 
 I see . You must have more rest . 
 I set up the Personal Wealth Management Service with you , but I'm going to be travelling overseas . I'm not quite sure what I should do . I mean is it possible to still use the service ? 
 Really ? In that case , could I have the number of the Service Centre please ? 
 And they can deal with everything ? 
 That's good to know . Thanks . 
 Hello . I have a reservation , under the name Lee , Leo Lee . 
 It ’ s L-e-e . 
 You mean I have to pay now ? 
 I see . I guess you can tell I don ’ t travel much . 
 I'm sorry , but I didn't catch what you said . 
 If you're sure you're not in a hurry , I can use a little help . 
 May I take your drink order while you are looking over your menu ? 
 The wine list is on the second page of your menu . 
 Yes , we have a full bar here . 
 Actually , we are famous for our Cuervo Gold margaritas . 
 Would you like that drink blended or on the rocks ? 
 Would you like it with salt or no salt ? 
 Good morning , I want to send this parcel to Taiwan . 
 How long would surface mail take , compared with airmail ? 
 How much would this parcel cost me by airmail ? 
 Thanks . That'll be OK . 
 I would like to check out . 
 Can I pay by credit card ? 
 Good morning , sir , Can I help you ? 
 Oh , we have many kinds.Do you like this design . 
 What's wrong with you , young man ? 
 Do you have a fever ? 
 Let me examine you.Don ' t worry.It ' s nothing serious . 
 Yes , stay in bed and drink a lot of water.Your fever will be gone in a day or two . 
 Of course not.You need a good rest . 
 Oh , the bus is gone . 
 I'm afraid we have to wait for the next bus . 
 Could you introduce to me the man over there ? 
 You're so kind . 
 Yes , hello . Our company used your bank to send some documents to Malaysia last week . Could you check and see if the proceeds have come back yet , please ? It's Sang Hung Enterprises , based in Kula Lump . 
 That's as it should be . When will it be paid in and credited to our account ? 
 What shall we do tonight ? 
 That's a good idea.We haven't been there for ages . 
 Oh , I don't know.It depends . 
 Yes ? 
 Oh , did you ? 
 Yes , of course . Will you come with receipt ? 
 Until 8 o'clock madam . We are looking forward to seeing you . 
 Let's play some music ! I feel like dancing . 
 Ahh ! Now that's more like it . Atmosphere ! 
 Oops ! It's the landlord . I guess the tables have turned now . We're the noisy neighbors . Turn it down ! 
 It's nothing . It's not the first time anyway . 
 I hope so . 
 Let's go get something to drink . 
 Do you know what you want to drink ? 
 You shouldn't drink soda when you're really thirsty . 
 When you're thirsty , you're not supposed to drink soda . 
 Water is what's best for you . 
 It's better for you . 
 I am doing well . How about you , Mary ? 
 There is a new movie at the mall that I want to see . Want to go with me ? 
 I could go to the movies on Friday night instead . Would that be better ? 
 I thought the movie about a serial killer who rapes and mutilates his victims would be a good choice . 
 Maybe we can think of something somewhere between a chick flick and a horror movie ! 
 Well , it is still open . Where did you graduate from . 
 It sounds great . I will arrange an interview tomorrow . Can you come tomorrow ? 
 Excuse me , do the buses stop here ? 
 I want to go to Broadway and 82nd Street.Can I take any bus that comes along ? 
 How often do the buses run ? 
 Fine.How long does it take to get to 82nd Street ? 
 Yes , I am . I arrived only three days ago from Japan . 
 I like it very much , but it's a little confusing to me . 
 Thank you for the information . 
 Hi Linda , this is Todd . 
 I just wanted to tell you what a great time I had with you at the movies last week . 
 I also enjoyed it and was wondering if you would like to go for a hike in the mountains with me on Saturday . 
 Sure Linda , that's a great suggestion . 
 I was thinking maybe 9 o'clock or so , so that we could get started before the heat gets too bad . 
 Jenny , you're too lazy . You should do some exercise . See , you're getting fat . 
 That is your excuse . 
 Not just today . Go exercise everyday ! 
 What flight has seats available to Milan on this Sunday ? 
 Oh.my god . But I have to be there on Sunday . I want to go on stand-by . 
 Thank you . 
 No , but you can let them know that yours is the cream of the crop-the purest motor oil in the world . Careful , hold it by the java jacket . This coffee drink has half and half-what do you think ? 
 That's just the point ! Purity is the essence of good coffee , right ? 
 He is in his bedroom . He has been in a bad mood after school .

 That's really cheap . I will take it . 
 Welcome to our company .

 He is our accountant .

 Hello , I'd like to talk to someone about making a withdrawal . 
 Yes , but the problem is that I have a Savings Account with you , and I need to take some money from that . Do I really have to give 90 days notice if I want my money ? 
 That's not a problem . I'll pop in later today to make a formal request . Thanks ! 
 Here is the coffee , toast and bacon . Do you like fried eggs or poached ones ? 
 Of course . They will be ready in a few minutes . 
 Why ? 
 Really ? Well . Ok . Get the receipts out . 
 That's 1,825 dollars . 
 3,075 . Our paychecks are 3300 combined . That means we don't have any receipts for 225 .

 Chen Hong , too .

 Don ’ t worry . That ’ s just a part of being a teenager . 
 You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ’ t affect her decision . 
 Oh , she can make her own decisions . 
 Believe me . Everything will be ok . 
 Good evening , sir . Are you ready to order now ? 
 Chinese food is divided into eight big cuisines , such as Cantonese food , Sichuan food , Fujisan food , etc . Our restaurant is famous for Sichuan style . 
 Yes . Cantonese food is lighter while Sichuan food is spicy and hot . 
 How about the eggplant and minced pork in dry red chili sauce and the ' Tofu ' beancurd ? They are our specialties . 
 Yes . Sour soup of Sichuan style . It's our chef ’ s recommendation .

 OK , sir . We'll try our best to serve you as soon as possible . 
 I am an Assistant Electronics Engineer . 
 I've wanted to be involved in engineering ever since I was little . And my study has equipped me with a career as a mechanical engineer . 
 what ’ s wrong , Jim ? 
 Twenty minutes just to find out what their business hours are ? 
 Oh , I hate getting voicemail instead of a person.What did you do ? 
 Couldn ’ d you choose to be transferred to a real person ? 
 What kind of personality do you think you have ? 
 Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ? 
 What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ? 
 Do you have any friend you would call really close ones ? 
 What kind of people would you like to work with ? 
 What kind of people you find hard to work with ? 
 Cool camera . What are its features ? 
 What about the quality of the pictures ? 
 Wow ! What about the memory ? 
 May I help you ? 
 Let me see . Oh , you're at the wrong gate . Your plane leaves from Gate No . 8 . 
 No , don ’ t worry . Just follow me . 
 Well , an important part of the duties of a secretary , I think , is to do well the preparation work for the meeting . 
 First of all , the agenda should be prepared before the meeting . Then you should ensure that those entitled to be present are properly informed . 
 All the necessary documents and the information relevant to the meeting should be available , preferably printed and distributed before the meeting . 
 Of course , she should take minutes . 
 After the meeting she should type the minutes up , and then keep proper records of the business transacted and the resolutions passed and also implement many of the decision reached at the meeting . 
 Hello , sir . Have you anything to declare ? 
 OK . Please open your luggage , and I'll tell you what you should declare . 
 You should declare the camera and the film . Do you have alcohol ? 
 How many bottles have you got with you ? 
 I'm sorry . According to the regulations , a passenger can only take two bottles on to the aircraft . So you cannot take so many . 
 You may give them to your friends who come to see you off . This is the Customs Declaration Form . Please fill in it . And then you can go through the other formalities . Be sure to keep the form safe . 
 See you . Have a good journey . 
 Most people think that wealth means success . But from my point of view , the problem should be viewed from two aspects . On the one hand , wealth is a very important thing to measure success . The ability to make money , to some extent , signifies your knowledge , your capability , the value of your labor , etc .. With the development of our economy and industry , more and more people are pursuing money these days . And in toda / s society , If you have money , you seem to have everything . But this is not the case . I think success , on the other hand , also means satisfaction from work . It also means that you can get respect from others . 
 Ideally , I ’ d like to have a job that will allow me to work from home several days a week . I ’ m the kind of person who can set priorities , work well independently , and set my own pace . I actually successfully worked from home for several months in my current job when a problematic pregnancy forced me to stay in bed . But I realize that many employers do not have experience with employees who work from home , and I have , of course , performed very successfully in a traditional office setting . 
 Very good . Basically , once our sales plan was put together , I had a great deal of freedom to handle my sales in the way I felt best . 
 He always says I am a hard worker with consciousness of responsibility , sufficient education , and enough experience . 
 They would say I am a dependable friend and a capable colleague . 
 Hi , is Heather there please ? 
 Is this 617-228-2289 ? 
 Heather Johnson . 
 Do you know where she went ? 
 Yes , would you please tell her Eric Martin called ? 
 Oh , yes . How are you ? 
 OK . Thanks . 
 Waiter , a menu please ! 
 Thank you . Could you tell me the specials today ? 
 Ok , let's think about it for a minute . 
 You say he was around average hight . 
 Weight ? 
 Any karks on his face ? 
 Glasses ? 
 what about his hair ? 
 Long or short ? Straight ? Curly ? 
 Boy , this surely doesn't help us much.It could be anybody.How about his cloth ? What was he wearing . 
 Ok , now we are getting some where.Pants ? 
 What kind of shoes ? 
 Cow while Boots . 
 All right . That nearly done a little.Now I want you to look some pictures . 
 Hi . I need some help with these documents under L / C . 
 Yes . My Manager sent me in , there's a problem with the shipping time . It's been delayed quite significantly and my manager is unwilling to accept it . 
 Thank you . I need to get this done as soon as possible ; my manager is tearing his hair out ! 
 Yes , Jason , right ? Nice to meet you . Welcome to Taiwan . 
 You had a long flight , you must be tired . 
 Oh , sorry to hear that . But , don worry ! Taiwan has plenty of great things to eat . First , lets get you to the hotel . 
 My car is in the parking lot , lets go this way . Let me help you with your bags . 
 We have a good variety . What decade would you like ? 
 There are six on this table . 
 Many people like the dancing figures . Two of our boxes have the figures . 
 That one will bring you many hours of pleasure . 
 I'm sorry , but if it breaks down , you're on your own . 
 When you buy a Model T , you can't expect a warranty . 
 No , I haven ’ t . 
 Perhaps you left that at school . 
 Well . Didn ’ t you go around to the Smith after school ? You might have left it there . 
 But she can ’ t be home now . She might have gone to the library . 
 I had a look yesterday . I found some exhibits are fine in quality and beautiful in design . The exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles . I have gone over the catalogue and the pamphlets enclosed in your last letter . I have got some idea of your exports . I am interested in your silk blouses . 
 Some of them are of the latest style . Now I have a feeling that we can do a lot of trade in this line . We wish to establish business relationship with you . 
 Concerning our financial position , credit standing and trade reputation , you may refer to our bank.or to our local chamber of commerce or inquiry agencies . 
 That sounds interesting ! I'll send a fax . As soon as I receive the definite answer , I'll give you a special answer . 
 So do I . 
 That is what I want to say . 
 Thank you ! 
 Knock on wood . But I have a very important date . 
 The choice of destination is very important . It will too energetic for the old people if you make an excursion or go to climb mountains . But they'll be interested in going to the historical places of interest where they can have fun . 
 That's a good idea . That will allow both you and your parents to enjoy yourselves . 
 It's some medicine the doctor recommends . If you leave it at home , you will find it difficult to face up when the old people suffered a seizure . 
 You'd better have all a light schedule . You can rest up for a few days if your parents find tired 。 
 Yes , that's right . Having an enjoyable time together is the goal . 
 Sit down here - don't put any pressure on it . I'd better call the company doctor . 
 Of course , sir , I'll have a look in the back . 
 I'm afraid I haven't got one in your size . 
 There're a lot of chuckholes on this old highway . Driving on it is experience-demanding . 
 Ok . You drive and do be careful . 
 Sorry . No . You need to transfer to a connect flight in the middle . 
 You have to do it . But it takes only about 30 minutes . 
 It has become more time saving . 
 Anything else ? 
 Our employees receive fifteen days of paid vacation every year . If you don ’ t use the full fifteen days , they carry over to the following year . 
 You get five paid sick days . 
 Yes , we have an excellent retirement plan and medical insurance as well . 
 We ’ ll contact you soon , Ted . Thanks for coming in . 
 I feel my greatest asset is perseverance , that is , the ability to stick to things to get them done . 
 I feel a sense of accomplishment when I finish a job and it turned out just as I'd planned . 
 Not really . I like looking on the internet at what ’ s available , but I usually prefer to actually see and touch what I ’ m buying before I pay for it . Sometimes , I ’ ll look at something in a shop , but later buy it online if it ’ s cheaper . You don ’ t like buying things online , do you ? 
 Not really . I know that it happens , but if you buy from reputable companies with secure websites , you should be ok . Even though I use online shopping facilities , I don ’ t think it ’ s the best way to shop . 
 I do . I ’ m a big fan of using new technology , but I don ’ t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . I think people need to get out and interact with other people . 
 Sure . I ’ d love to join you . Can we stop by the computer store ? I just want to see if they have something . 
 Ok . I ’ Ve finished online . Let ’ s go . I ’ ll just get some money and my credit card . 
 When we get paid for this assignment , you get US $ 2 , TOO , and I get US $ 3,000 . 
 Okay , okay , we'll split it 50/50 . 
 Oh , sure . How are you ? Long time no see . How are things at Lemans ? 
 No , not at all . Go ahead . 
 Well , I can't speak for all universities , but my salary is a definitely lower than at Lemans . I just don't think the salaries are comparable when you leave a major corporation . 
 I'd have to say yes and no on that . I don't get a big end-of-the-year bonus like I did at Lemans but I get to take classes for free if I want to . I've always wanted to get a graduate degree so I'm taking classes now to do that . 
 Yeah , I guess I am . Working at a university is really suits me . 
 Tom , the new sales representative ? Nice to meet you ! I'm Melinda . 
 Now let me show you around . This is our reception area , and our conference room is right over there . Over there is the sales department . 
 Yeah ... You can make photocopies and send faxes over there . 
 I tell you what just between you and me , we just mess things up so that it looks like we work hard.Just kidding . Oh , your cubicle is over the . And this way . Those are all private offices--the managers ' offices . 
 Sure thing . 
 Yes , it's far quicker and less complicated . 
 Really ? 
 Yes , and seven days a week . 
 Follow me , please . 
 No , you don't have to . 
 Please come in , Steven . 
 Have a seat over there . How are things going out in the office ? 
 But , our business has been going down sharply the couple of months and we have to reduce some staff . 
 I'm afraid so . 
 You're the sales manager , but our sales didn't go up . 
 I feel sorry , but that's the decision of the directorate . 
 No problem . But how ? 
 Ok . I am done . You have nothing on the list left behind . But I suggest you take sneakers with you . 
 It is necessary for you to walk on the street . Otherwise , it will be not good to wear high heeled shoes . 
 You do need to take some medicines with you . Just in case . 
 I'll cook dinner for you . 
 Good morning . Do you have a small house for the 18th and 19th of this month ? 
 One bedroom will be okay . 
 You do allow pets , don't you ? 
 No problem . I don't have a dog or a cat . 
 Could you change this note for me , please ? 
 Eight tens , six ones and large silver for others . 
 Thanks . 
 this is the route I thought we could take on our hike on Saturday afternoon . 
 it ’ s about six or seven miles . That ’ s about the kilometers . 
 right . Then we turn left and walk up this small hill . The view from the top of the hill is worth the climb . We can eat a snack there . 
 we can spend a few minutes looking around the church . Then , we turn right and walk along this path . 
 yes , we can , but it isn ’ t very interesting . 
 that ’ s right . 
 I think it will take about four hours , including breaks . 
 yes , there are . They tell use which way to go and how far we have to walk . 
 Just so-so.You ' re doing all right ? 
 No thanks . 
 I need to get a Letter of Credit . Is this the right window ? 
 Yes , right here in my brief case . Just a moment , please . 
 That's done . There is more than enough to cover the contract amount in our account . 
 When will I get a raise ? 
 You said the same thing three months ago . 
 You mean I won't get a raise until recession ends ? 
 I got the message . I am quitting . 
 How do you do ? My name is John White . 
 The pleasure is all mine . 
 Sure . We've got a lot to do in a short time . We're planning to shut the line at midday on Wednesday and start up again at 6 pm the following day . We might need to extend the shut by about six hours . 
 Not really . We need to dismantle the conveyor belt and replace the rollers . 
 Eight o'clock . It's time for you to get up and have breakfast . 
 You won't go to work today , Steven , It's Sunday . Come and have breakfast now . 
 You have been too tired recently , darling . That's why I didn't wake you up this morning . After breakfast , you can go to sleep again . 
 Hello , I hope to get a room for the night . 
 Sorry , I don't . 
 I only need a single room . 
 Smoking if possible . 
 I am very grateful . How much will it be ? 
 Oh dear . I don't have it with me . Do you take debit cards or should I pay with cash ? 
 I've just got Bean's new brand image . Let's make a T-shirt line with these pics . 
 Exactly ! With the war in Iraq , they'll sell like crazy around the world . 
 Sure . I'd rather show Bean in a garter belt , but all in good time . 
 Do you have a room available for this weekend ? 
 I'd like two twin beds , please . 
 That's fine . Do you have any specials for your guests ? 
 Good . Let me give you my credit card number to reserve a room . 
 Would you mind telling me if this is the right way to the police station ? 
 Should I take a bus ? 
 Happy Mother ’ s Day , Mom ! 
 Of course I should have ! You certainly deserve them ! You put up with all of us . 
 What did you do at that company ? 
 If a consumer complains about the quality of your products , what will you do ? 
 Please pull your table down . It's lunch hour . 
 What would you like , sir ? 
 You may choose from the fish and beef . 
 Here you are . Would you like a cup of tea or coffee ? 
 We have a selection of orange , apple , grape and lemonade . 
 All right . Will there be anything else ? 
 Sure . Here you are . 
 You're welcome . Enjoy your meal . Press the call button if you need any more help .

 Good morning , Mr . Thomas , it is nice to see you too . 
 I ’ Ve worked in the field for more than 4 years . Depend on my work qualifications and experience , I would like to have 5000 Yuan to start . 
 It is a bit lower than I expected . But I can accept that . What are the working hours ? 
 Do I have to work on weekend ? If so , how do you pay for the overtime ? 
 Is there probation ? 
 Good afternoon . It's a pleasure to see you again ! What can we do for you today ? 
 Have you had a chance to go through them yet ? 
 Is it a big difference ? 
 Can I give you a lift home , Mrs Word ? 
 Could you hold my umbrella when I get my keys out , please ? 
 Dreadful . There , the door is open now . 
 Roger ? Would it be possible to meet with you to discuss my department ’ s budget ? 
 All right . That ’ ll be fine . Can you put together a rough idea of the kind of money I ’ ll have available for the next year ? 
 John , it ’ s time to get up .

 For about 3 hours . Enjoy your trip . 
 I was born in London , but I spent most of my childhood in Hongkong . 
 I had a pretty strict up-bring , and my parents and I were always fighting about it . 
 Oh , sure . Once they reached middle age , they became a lot less uptight . 
 My parents wanted me to stay in Hongkong , but I decided to go back to England , I graduated from Oxford University with a degree in English literature . 
 I ’ m a freelance writer . i write magazine articles and fiction books 
 No , I didn ’ t . I was an english teacher for about five years , but by the time I was thirty , I decided I want a fresh challenge . 
 I started writing margin articles for fun , and eventually was asked to write a book , so I was pretty lucky . 
 Yes , it ’ s about a group of friends living in a foreign country , and all the strange experiences they have 
 Good evening , sir . Are you Mr Jim Stewart from the States ? 
 Glad to meet you , Mr Stewart . I'm the guide from Pacific Tour Agency . My name is Zhang Hua . 
 I'm always at your service , sir . By the way , did you have a pleasant trip ? 
 Well , shall we go to the hotel right now ? I've already made a reservation for you . 
 So we must get you to the hotel as soon as possible . I hope to see you refreshed and revitalized tomorrow morning , as we are going to visit the Great Wall . 
 Come this way , please . The coach is waiting outside . 
 Julia , burglaries in our town have been on the wing . 
 I heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . The robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight . 
 I am worrying about it too . I want to install a security door . 
 Yes , I think so . The security door is so firm that nobody can break in . 
 OK , I will do it right now . 
 Did you think it wasn't real ? That's my pet lizard . 
 His name is Grunt . Come closer and I'll properly introduce you . 
 No , he's perfectly harmless . And he's not afraid of strangers either . Here , hold him . 
 Stick around and you'll get to know him better . He has a very unusual personality . 
 Thank you for your instruction . I really need to know the rules before I play the game , so I can know more about our company . 
 Set your heart at rest . I keep this in my mind . 
 Hi , do you know a place that sells cheap cashmere sweaters ? 
 That's a good idea ! 
 Thank you for the suggestion . 
 What're you going to wear today ? 
 You'd better tuck in your shirt . 
 Are you a good driver ? 
 I need you to teach me how to drive . 
 Yes , I have it . 
 I drove a car before , but only once . 
 I already know all of them . 
 When do you have time ? 
 How far do we have to go ? 
 The traffic is not very heavy on this high way , is it ? So I ’ m sure we ’ ll make it . 
 Don ’ t worry . There ’ s plenty of time yet . 
 Right . 
 We have some fresh red roses . 
 Twenty dollars per dozen . 
 Yes , that is today's sale price . 
 Is there anything else you'd like to get ? 
 I'm sure your wife will love them . 
 Don ’ t put me on the spot . You know , I can ’ t do that . 
 I've got a sore throat and my chest hurts . 
 Yes , I ache all over . 
 A little bit . 
 It's gone completely . 
 Is that all doctor ? 
 Thank you , doctor . Goodbye . 
 May I help you ? 
 How long is your journey ? 
 The popular tour of the season is a 14 - days ' sightseeing to Venice . Are you interested in that city ? 
 Good morning . What can I do for you , sir ? 
 Very well . Please sit down here . Do you want me to cut your hair very close ? 
 It's such a hot season , isn't it ? May I suggest thinning out the top ? 
 ( several minutes later ) Now it's done . Is it satisfactory ? 
 Anything else I can do for you , sir ? 
 I'd like to book a ticket to Shanghai . 
 As soon as possible . Do you have a flight tomorrow ? 
 That will be OK . 
 Just me this time . 
 Economy class will be fine . 
 I would like to book a one way trip ticket . 
 I would like to pay by check . 
 I'll pay by charge card then . 
 Lucy Green . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 My , it looks too queer ! 
 Great ! Will you please tell me how to take it ? 
 That sounds very interesting ! 
 Thank you very much . 
 You've come to the right store . We've got a beautiful and wide selection of necklaces for you to choose from . 
 Do you mean the exquisite golden necklace ? 
 It costs only two thousand yuan . 
 Yes , it is , and the lustre will never fade out . 
 Thank you very much for your dinner . 
 My wife is expecting me at home . I must be off now.So long ! 
 Good afternoon . 
 Speaking . 
 Let me check my diary . Er . I'm afraid I can't make Tuesday . I've got to go to Beijing for a conference . I'll come back on Thursday . 
 Yeah , that would be fine . What time ? 
 Yeah , that's fine . Next Friday at 12 at Garden Hotel . I'll look forward to it . 
 Yes . Which one is the brake again ? 
 I ’ m glad this car is an automatic . I don't like having to change gears . 
 You should also put yours on . you never know what will happen with me in the driver ’ s seat ! 
 I can ’ t see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car . Could you move it forward a bit , please ? 
 That ’ s better . Now what ? 
 The tank is almost empty . I guess I ’ ll drive to the petrol station to fill it up . 
 I got it . Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll get you there in one piece . 
 Why does that cop car behind me have its red lights on ? 
 OK . Would you like to file them according to dates ? 
 Yes , I will . 
 When do you expect it to be finished ? 
 All right . 
 I have just left school , but I am well acquainted with office work . 
 Since leaving school , I have attended typewriting and shorthand classes , and have now attained a speed of fifty and ninety works respectively . 
 I know how to gather and summarize information from the Intent , which is an essential skill for market analysis . 
 I am a good accountant and have a thorough knowledge of the English language . 
 What's the fare , please ? 
 Is this the right bus to Zizhuyuan Park ? 
 But somebody told me this was the right bus to take . I want to go to Tian'anmen Square , you see . 
 Would you please let me know when we get there ? 
 I am afraid not . I haven't worked in an American company so far . 
 The first is accounting entity , and the second is going concern . The third is measuring unit . The fourth is accounting period , and the fifth is objectivity . 
 I am the manager here . You can complain to me . How may I help you ? 
 I apologize for everything disturbing you . We will give another room to you right now . Please wait a moment . 
 Yes , I agree . We can see the scenery better . In a bus , all you see are the roads . 
 I agree . Buses bounce too much . After two or three hours , you feel too tired . 
 Beautiful . 
 I don't know if it will turn out good.The window might cause the picture to be blurry . 
 Can I help you ? 
 uh ... Yes . Turn right , then take the second turning on your left . 
 It ’ s about fifteen minutes ’ walk . That ’ s all . 
 Yes . It ’ s on this street . Keep walking for two blocks and it ’ s on the corner on the right . 
 You are welcome . Good luck . 
 What kind of job are you interested in ? 
 I really appreciate that I would expect my secretary to be able to work independently and take over some of my ordinary responsibilities , such as answering routine correspondence , taking phone calls for me and sometimes assisting me with personal affairs . 
 Have you had any experience as a guide ? 
 Once in a while we have visitors from abroad and I would like to be able to ask my secretary to take them shopping and sightseeing . 
 Mr . Jackson , I've drafted a schedule for your business trip next week . You may have a look . 
 You're leaving on Tuesday morning . 
 Your flight takes off at 8 
 Yes , you're seeing him on Thursday . You're inspecting the factory in the morning and having dinner with him in the evening . 
 Oh , that's not everything . You're free on Friday and then on Saturday you're catching the 9 o'clock plane back to Guangzhou . 
 maybe that's why some young chaps often spend a whole afternoon in a coffee bar , surfing the net or just typewriting something with laptop . While they are savoring a coffee at a leisured pace , they 
 then what about tea ? We need to bear in mind in the first place that tea , rather than coffee , has been the most popular drink for the Chinese people . 
 what a pity that the traditional teahouses , as depicted Lao She , keep fading away so quickly in this metropolis . It is not easy to find an old-fashioned teahouse that suits the ordinary people's spend 
 We did a survey on your job performance . 
 Not so good . Lots of complains . 
 Your performance so far is not quite in line with what we expect for our executives . I hope I ’ Ve made my point . 
 Glad to meet you , Mrs.Tina . 
 That's what I understand . 
 Exactly my understanding . 
 Yes , I have . 
 Just one . I noticed an item about flex-time.Is that a possibility for me ? 
 That's acceptable . 
 That was a beautiful car . It ’ s a new car , but it ’ s totaled . 
 I don ’ t think I could afford that kind of car again . I think I ’ ll have to choose something that is not as hard to replace . 
 What will happen if I chose a smaller car ? Would the payments be the same ? 
 Yes . 
 What size do you want it to be ? 
 Oh , I see , that's the size of 12 x 18cm . How many prints do you want to have ? 
 Let me see . Eleven yuan . 
 This is your change . 
 Yes . Is it easy to get around ? 
 How about the subway ? 
 Good morning , mom . 
 I'm still sleepy . 
 No , I couldn't fall asleep last night . 
 No , I haven't . 
 I have been studying . 
 Do you know if it costs any money to take it ? 
 All right . Do you know if the test covers the whole book ? 
 Did you pass it the first time that you took it ? 
 Well , I hope that I do well . 
 I'm going to do some shopping . 
 What's on TV tonight ? Is there a football match ? 
 Really ? Who will play ? 
 That's cool . I'll watch it . 
 There is no doubt that the Brazilian team will win . 
 Hello , welcome to Credit Services . How can we help you ? 
 Are you an existing customer ? 
 May I ask why you didn't think of applying for a credit card with us sooner ? Most young people jump at the chance . 
 That's very sensible of you . We have many fresh graduates applying for credit cards , getting them and then going on a spending spree and being unable to meet the repayments . 
 Good morning , I would like to make a doctor ’ s appointment . 
 I have been having skin problems that aren ’ t going away . 
 No . Except for the rash , I feel fine . 
 I would like to come in on Tuesday . 
 I would like to see Dr . Smith . 
 Have you had any medical experience in any hospital before coming here ? 
 How long have you been there ? 
 In what section did you work in the hospital ? 
 What a washing machine ! It ’ s getting worse today . Look ! Now it doesn ’ t work at all . I think I need a new one . 
 Of course ! Let ’ s have a look . Great ! In my frame of mind , I ’ d like to but one today . 
 Why not ? What about us doing it right now ? 
 So let's head there . We'd better hurry up . 
 Yes . Can I help you ? 
 Yes , you could if it's kept intact . But don't you want to get a bigger size ? 
 Are they ? In that case , I'll be glad to give your money back . 
 Never mind . It ’ s just my duty . 
 I would like to rent a car with a good stereo . 
 Good . I am here visiting my girlfriend . I want her to have a good time . 
 This is a Porsche ! 
 But I probably can't afford it . It must be really expensive . 
 But how can you do that ? 
 Yes , it almost looks new . 
 Nothing . What's going on with you ? 
 I had no idea . 
 I didn't hear anything about it . 
 What time ? 
 I'll go . 
 No doubt . 
 Ha , I am flattered . Actually , when it comes to negotiate , you don ’ t need to like it . You just need to understand how it works . 
 Well , generally speaking , if you want to change someone ’ s mind or understand his position , you have to put yourself in his shoes . Understand his need and the cost for his need . And then you work together to find a solution . 
 Ok , as John after Kennedy put it , let us never negotiate out of fear , but let us never fear to negotiate . 
 It's no problem . I was really missing you anyway . 
 Why haven't you tried to come see me then ? 
 Doing what ? 
 I would've come to see you sooner , but I've been busy too . 
 I've been working too . 
 I am too . 
 I want to change my hairstyle . What would you suggest ? 
 Do you think it will suit me ? 
 Ok , I'll have it for a change . 
 I ’ Ve been really busy . How is everything ? 
 Yeah , why not ? I ’ Ve got a little free time on my hands . Where do you want to eat ? 
 I am afraid there isn ’ t . 
 There is a desk and two chairs . 
 They are behind the door . 
 Yes , I would like to check in . 
 Yes , my name is Steven Smith . I have a reservation from October 2nd to October 6th . I called last week . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 OK . By the way , where is the restaurant ? 
 Thank you . 
 OK , but I think you should keep an eye on your plan if you see what I mean . 
 No buts . The thing is to cut down your expense , Judie . 
 That would be WebTracker . We're heard they're almost ready . That's why we have to finish first . 
 Right . And that would be a total giga-bummer . 
 Excuse me . May I see Mrs . Smith ? 
 Nice to meet you , Mrs . Smith . I'm coming here for an interview by appointment . 
 Yes , I am . 
 Not really , I am familiar with this area . 
 I have a really bad toothache ! My cheek is swollen and I can ’ t eat anything . 
 When you pull my tooth will you also have to extract the nerve and the root ? 
 I guess that ’ s what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day . 
 May I help you ? 
 How about this one ? It smells like green tea and is our best seller . Try it . 
 It goes for $ 40 . 
 I had a big argument with david yesterday . I hope he ’ s not still mad at me . 
 he borrowed some money from me and I needed it back . He said he didn ’ t have the money yet . 
 yes , but is got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ’ t have got angry . 
 not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back . 
 no , we didn ’ t . I guess you ’ re right . We should patch things up . 
 Doctor Lin's Office . 
 How about 2 o'clock this afternoon ? 
 I need some flowers for my wife . It's her birthday . 
 How much are the roses ? 
 That sounds like a good deal . 
 I'll take a dozen . 
 No , the roses will be fine . 
 I wonder if you can help me . I ’ m looking for a room . 
 How much do you charge ? 
 OK.Can I see the room now ? 
 The dress looks beautiful . Can I touch it ? 
 I see . What about the dress over there ? I would like to try it on . 
 Please show me the menu , Miss . 
 Yes . I'd like an Italian soup to start with and then some fried noodles . 
 Yes , I'd like another cup of coffee afterwards . Make it hot , please . 
 How long are you staying ? 
 May I ask what brought you here ? 
 What line of business are you in ? 
 Where are you going to play this weekend ? 
 I want to spend two days in the mountains with friends . The city is too noisy . Do you know Tangle Temple ? 
 Do you want to climb the mountain with us ? 
 No problem . The temple is quite large . 
 I'm getting a little excited now . What clothes should I wear ? 
 Anything else I should bring ? 
 Needless to say . 
 Hello , Kristy . Could I speak to the department that deals with credit card applications , please ? 
 The personal card , please . Is it possible to take care of this over the phone ? 
 OK ... and what deposit do I need ? I mean , is there a minimum deposit ? 
 That's no problem . How long will the whole thing take ? A week ? 10 days ? 
 Right , I'll contact my guarantor now and we'll come in within the next couple of days . Thanks very much for your help . Goodbye . 
 I'll have to look . What do you want it for ? 
 I can give you quarters , if that'll help . 
 I can ’ t believe it . 
 I plan on going back to school . 
 I ’ m not sure yet , but I plan to do good things . 
 I have no plans on being back . 
 That ’ s true . 
 I ’ m going to be fine . 
 Everyone has his own habits , but these habits are not very good . The noise often spoils other people ’ s appetite . 
 The westerners use knives and forks to eat so it is complicated . The Chinese use a pair of chopsticks and eat out of the same plate . I assume it is less complicated , right ? 
 It seems that people share the same basic sense of etiquette regardless of their background . Apart from the different tools used for eating we seem to follow the same principles . We do not let inappropriate manners spoil other people ’ s appetite.Westerners like to say , “ bon appetite ” before meals which is one way to suggest “ mind your table manners . ” Is there such an expression in Chinese ? 
 Can I help you ? 
 Is this taxi taken ? 
 Yes . Will you take me to the station ? 
 Thanks . 
 Does that include some kind of " Love , Amy Card " ? 
 Mmmm ... I'll have to think about it . 
 My name is James Owen . I ’ m Manager of Sales . How do you do ? 
 Thank you for coming . Did you have any trouble finding the office ? 
 I apologize for this mess . They ’ Ve got me handling so many projects , and it ’ s hard to keep things organized . 
 Well . Miss Sun , as you know , we are looking for an executive secretary with good English skills and some business background . We looked over your resume and thought you might be a good candidate . 
 Today's interview is for us to get to know a little about you . If needed , there will be a more lengthy interview later . So , if you ’ re comfortable , let's begin . 
 So how did you like the restaurant ? 
 What didn't you like about it ? 
 What did you think about the food ? 
 The service wasn't that great , either . 
 Do you think that you want to try this restaurant another time ? 
 How do you feel ? 
 Here is the bigger size . 
 Have you watched any of the talent shows on TV ? 
 Yeah , and they know exactly what the audiences have in mind . Everyone desires equal opportunities and a channel to climb up the social ladder all the way to the highest in society . 
 But it seems that these talent shows are getting less popular these days . There's no such program on this year . 
 No surprise . The over-the-top promotion has ruined the audiences ' appetite . 
 The same is true for ' My Hero ' . Winners of the contest used to star in the TV series ' The Frog Prince ' . 
 This is the rush hour . 
 Let ’ s drive off this road . 
 Excuse me , how can I get special discount coupons ? 
 Can I get a discount coupon if I buy these goods ? 
 But how much discount can I get if I use it to buy goods next time ? 
 Can I buy everything in the supermarket by it ? . 
 How long can I keep it ? 
 I see . I will take 9 bags of sugar so that I can get 3 coupons . 
 My wife is in labor ! 
 Is Doctor Hawkins here ? She ’ s our doctor . We called her from the car . 
 Thanks . Sorry . It just came as such a surprise . The baby isn ’ t due for another two weeks . 
 About fifteen minutes . 
 Yes . 
 Ange , can your dog do any tricks yet ? 
 Really ? Does he chase balls ? 
 This can't be the same dog . He's so clean , he shines . 
 He's really cute . His bowl even has his name on it . 
 Good morning , I'd like a haircut . 
 Just a trim will do . 
 Hello . I'm sorry to tell you that I've lost my credit card this morning . I want to report the loss and replace a card . 
 Done ! 
 Thank goodness . 
 OK ! Thank you very much . See you a week later . 
 Nice to meet you . 
 I ’ m excited to speak to a candidate . 
 What is your stand on gay marriage ? 
 So , would you make gay marriage legal ? 
 I ’ m sure plenty of people won ’ t like that . 
 I like that . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 Yes , sir . 
 We'll visit the generally well-known spots . 
 Five days ' time will be OK . 
 Excuse me . Could you help me ? 
 I'm looking for a leather belt for my husband . 
 Size 36 . . . I think . 
 Dark brown , if you have it . 
 Yes . I'm sure he will . I'll take it . 
 Do you take Master Card ? 
 Oh . In that case , I'll pay cash . 
 I don't think dieting is good for you . It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with ! 
 They need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of physical exercise every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though . 
 Sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert . 
 Many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be treated seriously ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . 
 I used to take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start . 
 You might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size that I am now ! 
 He is a dishonest man and always tells a cock and bull story . 
 Yes , speaking . 
 Oh , I'm sorry , but I've just accepted another offer that I feel is more suitable to my needs . 
 I have a good feeling about this house . 
 I love the paint job ! 
 What a beautiful home ! 
 I like the way the blinds give you privacy from the street . 
 I love that they put a wine storage area in the kitchen . 
 I love the relaxing colors in the tile and floor covering ! 
 Can I help you , Sir ? 
 Fill in the slip , stating the exact amount you wish to withdraw , please . 
 OK , do you want large notes or small ones ? 
 Here's the cash for you . 
 Can you offer the Five Insurances for me ? 
 How are they get paid ? 
 I received an eviction notice from you , and I don ’ t understand what it means . 
 You can ’ t make me move just for being late with my rent . 
 Are you throwing me out ? 
 If I catch up on my rent , can I stay ? 
 I will go get the money right now . 
 Excuse me , I've been waiting here for 10 minutes . Do you know how often does No . 636 run ? 
 It seems you got here at good time . Do you have a bus schedule ? 
 I see , thank you . By the way , is this the right bus for the Museum ? 
 Do I have to change ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 How was your shopping trip Martin ? 
 Oh really ? Did you find any bargains ? 
 And how did you get around town ? 
 Right , so you didn ’ t get lost ? 
 Excuse me . 
 Can you tell me the way to the Peak Tram , please ? 
 Along Queen's Road ... 
 Right at the Hilton . 
 The Cathedral ? 
 That's very kind of you . Thank you.Er ... have you got a pencil ? 
 Can you repeat all that ? I think I'd better write it down . 
 Yes . 
 Do you know where Dawanglu is ? 
 You can take me there ? 
 That's good . 
 Let's go . 
 One bottle of perfume and a watch . 
 In Boston . 
 Oh ... I go to see my sister twice a year or so . 
 Nearly ten years . 
 I can't remember , but I've got the receipt somewhere . Would you like to see it ? 
 Yes . Does that mean I'll have to pay duty on it ? 
 Ok . Here you are . Is that all right now ? 
 Yes , I did . I had a fine time . 
 Fine , just get it ! We have been shopping for furniture for five hours ! I ’ m so tired ! 
 Fine ! I am going to go home and drop off this nightstand , coffee table and love seat while you look for the rest of the things . 
 While you are at it can you pick out a nice recliner ? I really want one so I can watch TV . 
 How about this floor lamp ? 
 We still need to find an armoire and a dresser . 
 Great ! Pick me up in about an hour because I think I ’ ll also get a bean bag and a dining set . 
 Recliner ? In my beautifully decorated living room ? I don ’ t think so ! 
 I'm glad you like them . They are all made of silk . Here on display are all the most popular and favorite products . What items are you particularly interested in ? 
 Yes . It is the latest product and is highly recommended because of its fine design and quality . You certainly have an eye for good things . 
 Here is the catalogue and the price list . You can take a look . 
 No problem . 
 The Smiths are arriving at our city tomorrow . Can you draw up a schedule for them ? If they want to make any changes , minor changes can then be made . 
 They would like to visit our factory and have a look at the new type computer products . Besides , they will introduce their technique in computer manufacturing . 
 They would also like to have a meeting with our designers . And this time , their visit to our company will lay the basement for our cooperation , so you need to pay more attention . 
 They will stay for two days . Try to work out an efficient schedule . 
 Yes . I'll be with you in a second . Yes , sir ? What is the problem ? 
 What did you order ? 
 There must be a mistake . Those are fried oysters . Would you like to keep it or change ? 
 Just a moment and I'll get your order right away . Sorry to cause the inconvenience . 
 I'm sorry but we are fully booked . 
 That's fine , but we have only a single room , is that OK ? 
 Yes , Mr . Emory ? 
 Just one moment , sir . Here you are – 767-4512 . 
 Tell me where you need to get on at . 
 If you don't mind walking , I know a bus you can take . 
 Walk all the way down Fair Oaks , and catch the 267 on Altadena Drive . 
 You have to catch it going west . 
 You need to get off on the corner of Del Mar and Hill . 
 It was my pleasure . 
 It's my pleasure . How many copies would you want ? 
 Yes , sir . Will there be anything else ? 
 Your document will be ready in about ten minutes . 
 What do you want ? 
 What kind of food do you want to get ? 
 Do you know where you're going to get it ? 
 I go to Panda Express for my Chinese food . 
 I really like the food . 
 I think you'll enjoy the food . 
 I'm the manager . How can I help you ? 
 Why , yes , it is . Would you like to get a look inside the apartment ? 
 How about today at 6 o'clock ? 
 Sounds good . I'll see you at 6 . Do you want directions ? 
 If you like the place , you can fill out an application form . I'll bring one with me . 
 No . I won't need to see anything except your driver's license . 
 We can inform the department in charge and ask for revocation of passport . 
 We need a detention warrant . 
 How do you want your egg cooked ? 
 Okay , it'll be ready in two minutes . 
 Good evening . May I help you ? 
 Oh , no , never . What's the exact time you'd like us to call you tomorrow morning ? 
 It won't take long . 20 minutes is enough . Is that OK if I call you at 6:30 a . m . ? 
 It's a pleasure . Good night . Have a good sleep . 
 It's a one-year lease . 
 No , all the leases are for one year . We don't have month-to-month leases . 
 You're welcome . 
 Is this the accounting department ? 
 Thanks . I appreciate that . 
 Then it wasn't meant to be . Some people have put up a hard fight for some items I bid on . But I was the sole bidder for this bag and got it dirt-cheap . 
 Sure . I've even e-mailed some people who had bought from the person who sold this bag . 
 They said he was an honest and professional businessman . But that's the exciting part . It's kind of like gambling ... 
 Good morning . How can I help you ? 
 Very well . 
 About five years . 
 There is my wife who does the accounts and my brother who helps with the sales . 
 Yes , we are a small family business . 
 That depends on the day . We sell from here and on the Internet . I would say about twenty to thirty per week . 
 That's correct . 
 Thank you and goodbye . 
 Yes , I do it a lot.but I don't like doing dishes.what about you , do you like cooking and then cleaning up afterwards ? 
 Suppose you have to do one of the two , which do you prefer ? 
 I prefer the absent.the way I see it , to do the dishes is boring . 
 What ? 
 Will you do the dishes after the meal ? 
 Good morning.My name's Pat Green . 
 I read in the poster that you're looking for a student to work as a language assistant . 
 I think so.But before I apply , could you tell me more about the work ? 
 I used cassette recorders a lot when I studied English in high school . 
 How many hours would I work a day and what's the pay ? 
 OK , I'll take it . 
 My amenities bill says that I owe $ 10 for a movie , but I never ordered one . 
 That's absolutely wrong ! I was out exploring the city Monday night . 
 Thank you . I didn't think it would be this simple . 
 Are you serious ? I have to pay $ 2 for a movie I never watched ? 
 This is outrageous ! I'm never coming back to this hotel again ! 
 First of all , I would like to thank you for your kind invitation to visit your beautiful country . I hope my visit will help to promote a friendly relationship between us . 
 I would like to tell you that my clients are very satisfied with the last delivery of your slippers . The styles and colors are very much to the taste of our market . 
 I understand you are selling the same products to some other Australian importers . This tends to complicate my business . As you know , I am experienced in the business of slippers and enjoy a good business relationship with all the leading whole - sabers and retailers in that line . I have a mind to expand this business in the years to come . One of the reasons of my visit here is to sign a sole agency agreement with you on these items for a period of 3 years . As it is to our mutual interests and profit , I am sure you'll have no objection to it . 
 I'll come to that . My proposal is 
 Well , I admit I always do business on the safe side . Could you let me have your proposal then ? 
 You certainly drive a hard bargain , Mrs . Brown . 
 Well , if you put it this way , I'll have to comply . When shall we sign the contract , Mrs . Brown ? 
 Tomorrow afternoon will be fine . 
 Well , we've got some great mangoes on sale . 
 Well , it's a fruit with a big seed in it . 
 No . Peel the skin with a sharp knife , and throw out the seed . 
 Well , they're on sale today for only $ 1 each . 
 They usually taste sweet , but they remind me of an orange . 
 You can buy them either ripe or unripe . Unripe ones are hard . 
 The ones that are on sale are from Central America . 
 Yes , what's in the package , madam ? 
 How would you like to send it ? 
 Do you want to insure it ? 
 3 dollars . 
 Sorry , I'm not really that interested in those things . 
 Really ? 
 Oh . I don't care about that . 
 Are they ? 
 I'm afraid I'm not interested in fashion . There are so many other really important things in the world . 
 Just a second . I'll have to check that . Anything else I can do for you ? 
 There you go . 
 But they are closed today . 
 Have you already forgotten ? What's the date today ? 
 You forgot all about it , didn't you ? 
 What's that ? 
 Better not forget that , so kill you if you don't get her something . 
 I don't think drinking requires any special purposes . For us people in the West , the purpose is generally quite simple-to savor the wine . 
 And to make matters worse , you're urged to drink " one more cup time and again.There is too much etiquette to observe . You'II be set free at a Western banquet It seems we are keen to make it convenient as possible to savor the wine , its color , its aroma and its delicate taste . 
 Yes . For me , who can't hold much liquor , it's particularly agreeable . If only I had thechance to enjoy Chinese Matai at a leisured pace while sitting at a Western banquet ! 
 It's called ' Endless Love ' . It was a gift from a sister city in Australia for the 100th anniversary of the city . 
 Just two months ago . There were very big celebrations and there was a spectacular fireworks display . I took part in the great parade myself . 
 Yes . We all loved the celebration of our city's birthday . It made the people feel so proud of our city . 
 Yes , very . I thought the last speaker was especially good . 
 How do you do ? I'm Mary Green . 
 Green , G-R-E-E-N , but just call me Mary . 
 Glad to meet you . 
 Yes . There's one on the corner of 23th street . 
 Just walk north for 3 blocks . It's next to the Mexico restaurant . 
 Oh , very close . Maybe 5 minutes walk . 
 Yes , ma'am . Here we are . 
 30 dollars , ma'am . 
 Yes , but we need some extra charge and some tip , too . 
 OK , ma'am . Calm down , 15 dollars will do . 
 Yes , Mr . Michael ? 
 I ’ m sorry , Mr . Michael . Could you tell me where the problems are exactly ? Maybe I misunderstood the client ’ s intentions . 
 Here you are.That comes to 120 yuan . 
 Certainly , sir.Would you sign here , please ? ... Thank you . 
 I think you will get a big bonus , because you always have high sales . 
 Yes , I am expecting to get the bonus . I hope we will both get the salary and bonus . 
 I am going on a business trip to Guangzhou next Monday morning . 
 Yes , as the New Year is coming , they ’ re organizing a party for all their customers . 
 Sure . 
 No , no one has informed me of that so far , tell me . 
 I see . What about the maximum purdy and rate , any change ? 
 I will call them this afternoon , thanks . 
 Are you ready for your big interview tomorrow ? 
 Lots ! Have you done any research about the company ? 
 Have you updated your CV ? 
 Excuse me , sir . What would you like to eat , Chinese food or western food ? 
 Are you going to have this set course or have dinner in the dining room ? 
 Please put down the table in front of you . It's more comfortable that way . 
 It's my pleasure . What would you like to drink , milk , tea , coffee , orange juice or iced water ? 
 Yes , here you are . Enjoy your meal . 
 OK , enjoy yourself , sir . 
 It is beef . Do you like it ? 
 You are welcome . Please press that button if you need any help . 
 Hello , can I help you ? 
 Sure . We have one on the second floor . 
 This is the first floor . The second floor is one level up . 
 That's just over there . On the right . 
 OK . Where should we go ? 
 Fine . I'll be ready in a minute . 
 No , I don't , do you ? 
 But , I don't believe in taking pills to get enough vitamins . 
 Because it's better , easier and cheaper to get them from the food we eat . 
 Not yet , Mr . Wang . But I'm working on it . 
 I just keep getting a busy signal . 
 All right , I'll let you know when I get through . 
 Oh , that's easy . Go to www.onxiu.cn . Now , click on the link with the picture of an envelope . 
 That one , the one that says Mail . 
 Don't worry . See where it says , New User ? 
 Click on that . 
 Yeah , just fill out this form and choose a password . The computer will do the rest . 
 About 6 in the morning . I like to walk to the office . 
 About 20 minutes . Do you live alone ? 
 How old is she ? 
 I think so . 
 sure , what would you like to discuss ? 
 well , I have to tell you that I'm quite surprised . Is there any possible way to change your mind ? 
 can I ask why ? Were you unhappy working for us ? 
 are you planning on studying abroad ? 
 have you been given a better offer ? 
 well , what's the problem then ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that , but you don't need to quit over that . Why don't you just take a leave of absence ? We can hold your job for you until your mother gets better . 
 sure , we'd be carry to lose a good worker like you . 
 It ’ s very nice to meet you . 
 I can ’ t believe I ’ m actually speaking to a candidate . 
 I want to ask you what your policy is on gay marriage . 
 Would you make gay marriage legal ? 
 I know a lot of people wouldn ’ t agree with that . 
 I think that is really cool of you . 
 Hey , Susan . Have you got a sec ? I have some questions about my paycheck . 
 Well , this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand . First of all , what is this FICA , and SUI Y tax , and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan ? 
 Then here we have a series of deductions . First off are the federal ones . FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act , or something like that . It's your federal income tax . And then there's Social Security and Medicare , which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work . 
 That's right . Below the federal deductions are the state deductions . There's the state income tax , and then this SUI / SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up , but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take . 
 That's right . Not all states have an income tax . Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead . 
 No problem ! All those deductions do add up , and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like . I can understand why you'd want some explanation . 
 Hello . How can we be of service ? 
 OK , are you already an account holder ? 
 To find out if you are eligible for our Fixed Asset Loan , we will have to look at various aspects of your business , such as your long-term business prospects , your cash flow , your profitability , your capital structure ... 
 Yes , and then other qualitative factors , such as the transparency of your business operations , your credibility and the integrity of your management . 
 Yes , I need this prescription please . 
 Capsules are fine . 
 Yes , I know . It ’ s not the first time I ’ m taking this ! Don ’ t worry , I won ’ t overdose ! 
 Oh , yes , I almost forgot ! Can I also get some eye drops and um , some condoms ? 
 Oh , well that ’ s okay , I ’ ll get some later , thanks ... Really it ’ s no problem . 
 How much tea are you going to order ? 
 When do you want to deliver the goods ? 
 I'm sorry , but June 30 is quite soon . I can't guarantee 1 500 cases , I'd prefer the first shipment to be 1,000 cases and the next 2,000 cases . 
 Let me affirm this again - the first shipment of 1,000 cases , to be delivered in 27 days , by June 30 , and the second shipment of 2,000 cases by August 15 . Right ? 
 Well , if there's nothing else , I think we've settled everything . 
 Do I often have to work overtime ? 
 Is there any extra pay for that ? 
 I finally found an apartment that I want to rent . 
 I saw it in this ad for apartments in today ’ s newspaper . 
 I really did , but what ’ s so great about it is that it ’ s really affordable . 
 Well , most importantly the apartment is beautiful . 
 The rent is $ 725 each month . 
 That ’ s what I said when I found out how much the rent was . 
 Excuse me . Do you have this in blue ? 
 And sorry . I can't find the price . How much is it ? 
 OK . Do you have it in extra small ? 
 Bill , I'm expecting a big increase in turnover with the coming of the Mid-Autumn Festival . But wholesales are unwilling to supply my orders unless I pay them an advance of 50 % of the full price , for my business is fairly new . I hope that you can make me an advance on loan . 
 No . I should be grateful if you could see your way to make an advance against my personal reputation . You may inspect my accounts . From my accounts you can see that I've promptly met all my obligations . 
 Yes , I can . You know Mr . Macready , the famous car dealer here in New York . He agreed to act as my guarantor of a loan in the sum of US $ l0 , 000 until the end of this year . 
 Hey Sarah , I'm having some trouble finding an apartment . Can you help me look at some listings online ? 
 Well , it has to be cheap . I don't want a really expensive apartment . 
 Sure , a studio would be fine . 
 Certainly . It's right over there . 
 I am having some plumbing problems and need them fixed . 
 The toilet flushes really slowly . 
 Both the kitchen and the bathroom plumbing are messed up . 
 It has been going on for a while , but just started to get worse this morning . 
 Yes , I will be home this afternoon . 
 Have you seen the movie Batwoman ? 
 Yes , it's quite amusing , actually . Good plot , and Sharon Stone's in it . 
 Yeah , but she looks amazing . 
 Well , it's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . But then she got reincarnated as a cat . 
 I know . Stay with me . She then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss . First , though , she had to discover her true cat nature . At the end she had a big fight with Sharon Stone , who was the real danger in the company . She had actually murdered the boss , who was her husband , and then tried to frame Batwoman for the murder , so everyone thought Batwoman was evil . 
 No . Sharon Stone was married to the boss , who treated her badly , so she killed him . So where was I ? OK , so then , at the same time she fell in love with a cop , who was investigating the murder of the boss . Finally , she ditched the cop to follow her feline nature . 
 No , Sharon Stone did . 
 Haven't you been listening to a word I've been saying ? 
 I need a phone card for this new cell phone . 
 It's for my daughter who is still a senior high school student . 
 What's special with the service ? 
 That's nice . And I need a pre-paid phone card . 
 Oh , good . Then what is it ? 
 May I have two of them ? 
 Okay , then a third one for my husband too . 
 Hello . I'd like to make a call to Australia . 
 Oh , can I ? 
 Could you please tell me the international prefix and the country code for Australia ? 
 What time do the special rates apply ? 
 I wonder if I can charge this call to my hotel room . 
 This is Mr . Ma in room 215 . 
 Thanks very much for your help . 
 Bye . 
 I am looking for cologne , small bottle . Can I see that one in the glass shelf ? 
 It's too expensive . 
 What's the difference between the two ? 
 Let me see . 
 Is this line for non-residents ? 
 Ok . Here's my passport . 
 I think it's soon , maybe in a few months . It was renewed in Beijing , so the new expiry date is on the last page . 
 I won't . 
 No , I don't have anything to declare . 
 I'll be here for about a year . 
 I'll be studying . I'm doing an MBA at Nottingham University . 
 I have a housing contract with the university . I'll be in a dorm room on campus . 
 My father has already paid for that in advance . Here are the receipts . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Easy for you to say . My bottom still stings . 
 Can't we go to McDonald's first ? 
 No , thanks . 
 Blah ... What's that ? 
 What shall we do now ? 
 I've got all I need . 
 It smells good . Look at these . They make my mouth watering . 
 It will be our turn soon . 
 OK . I'll have many cream cakes today . 
 Mr . Martin ? I need to talk to you for a minute . 
 Well , I ’ d just like you to help me with the holiday schedule . 
 Hi . You said that you might need some help with preparing dinner . What would you like me to do ? 
 Ok , I ’ ll peel the vegetables and you chop them . I ’ m terrible at chopping vegetables . I always seem to chop them into pieces that are either too big or too small . ... wow ! You can chop vegetable really quickly , just like professional chefs on TV ! 
 Which spices are you going to add to the meat ? 
 Yes . We don't want everyone to burn their mouths and have a drink gallons of water ! OK . I ’ m really to do the meat . Should I cook it over a low flame ? 
 Right . What are you doing over there ? 
 Bad news , I'm afraid . Our supplier has gone bust . The parts you ordered have arrived at the docks but the handling agent won't release them until someone pays the invoice . We also need to arrange transport to the factory . 
 Do you have any questions you want to ask ? 
 If necessary there will be . Any other questions ? 
 We'll give you our decision in a few days . How can we get in touch with you ? 
 Thank you for your interest in our company . 
 Would you please let the next applicant come in on your way out ? 
 What can I do for you today ? 
 Were you looking at a particular refrigerator ? 
 This particular refrigerator is a very good choice . 
 Not only is it affordable , but it comes with all the appliances . 
 It has an ice maker , water dispenser , and plenty of room on the inside . 
 Go right ahead . 
 May I help you ? 
 How do you want to send it ? 
 Is there anything valuable ? 
 They are fragile articles . They must be packed in a proper strong box . Your light cardboard box won't do . 
 Yes . 
 Yes . Now fill in two customs declarations and one despatch note in English . You'll have to take your parcel to the next window for examination when you have completed the forms . 
 Have you written down your return address ? 
 Recycling is big business these days , isn't it ? 
 What do you recycle in your plant ? 
 How is plastic recycled , then ? 
 Is that the method you use here ? 
 How do you do that ? 
 What is a visa used for ? 
 Oh . Where do I need to apply for a visa ? 
 Does it take a long time to get a visa ? 
 What materials do I need to provide ? 
 Hi . I want to get something nice for my niece . 
 I like that suggestion . Show me one , please . 
 Oh , my niece will love her ! How much for her ? 
 That's great . I'll take her . 
 Thank you , but no . This will do it for now . 
 I'll pay cash , thank you . 
 How do I take the tablets ? 
 How do I take the sucking lozenges ? 
 How do I take the pills ? 
 Well , thanks very much . 
 Do I need a visa ? 
 Yes , I know . I must get my traveler ’ s check and some foreign currency . 
 Really ? That ’ s very good of you , Helen . But I must get a new suitcase , my old one needs repairing . 
 That ’ s very kind of you , Helen . I hope you don ’ t mind my leaving you like this . I need a holiday . It won ’ t be long . 
 Hey , Joe ! Where have you been these past few days ? 
 Cool ! I ’ Ve always wanted to do something like that ! Have you learned anything useful ? 
 Have you treated any real emergencies ? 
 I can imagine ! I tend to faint when I see blood , so I think I won ’ t be taking up a course like that anytime soon ! 
 I'll be with you in a second . Uh ... Yes , ma'am ? 
 Oh , I'm so sorry . May I ask what you ordered again ? 
 I have to move . 
 I can ’ t stay here anymore . 
 What is the problem ? 
 Why not ? 
 But I need it back . 
 It will be impossible for me to stay here . 
 Good morning , doctor . I've been suffering very much from a toothache lately . 
 I think one of the back ones at the top is giving me the most trouble . 
 Oh , I hate having teeth pulled out . Will it hurt ? 
 Will it take long ? 
 Is it out ? 
 Well , really ! That was wonderful ! I felt no pain at all . Thank you , doctor . 
 Sure . What kind of toast do you like ? 
 We have white toast , whole wheat toast and rye toast . 
 Anything to drink ? 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 That's a good place to go at this time . How about this route ? 
 No , sir , you have to deal with your own meal since we charge you only $ 80 for the trip . 
 No , madam.May I help you ? 
 No problem.Step in , please . 
 Ben , what are you doing ? 
 Why ? 
 Have you thought about graduate school ? 
 Would you mind telling me then — what were those four years of college for ? What was the point of all that hard work ? 
 Now listen , Ben . Look , I think it ’ s a very good thing that a young man — after he ’ s done some very good work — should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself , and lie around , and drink beer and so on . But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass . 
 Right , here it is . 
 I'll take 4,500 RIB , please . 
 OK ... there we go . Thanks very much . 
 I am sorry to hear that , but face the music . 
 Here . Do you have a registration card ? 
 Please register your information here and pay for it . And I ’ ll make a medical record for you . 
 Please pay ten yuan for the registration . 
 This is your registration card . Please don ’ t lose it and bring it whenever you come . 
 Go down this way until you come to the drugstore . Make a left turn and it's just there . 
 I would like to cancel one of my accounts . 
 I only need one . 
 Could you please transfer that money to my remaining account ? 
 I appreciate it . 
 That ’ s all for today . 
 I greatly appreciate your help . 
 I'm not feeling well , doctor . I have a sore throat . 
 Yes , my back aches . 
 It began the night before last . 
 Lots of people are ill at the moment . 
 Are you done ? 
 Let me see . Everything looks fine . We ’ ll be taking applications for this position through Friday . We ’ ll start calling for interviews sometime next week . 
 That ’ s right . 
 Bye now . 
 Yes , I am . 
 It's a quarter to eight . I'm going to work . 
 I'm working on Saturday mornings this month.Are you getting up ? 
 OK . See you at noon . 
 Hi , I need to talk with the property manager right away ! 
 This morning , when we woke up , there was water pouring in from the ceiling ! 
 There were several rooms , but the worst leak was in the bathroom . 
 We are on the second floor , one of the middle floors . 
 Actually , I have to go to school right now . 
 It's time to get up ! 
 You shouldn't have stayed up so late watching TV . I told you we had to get an early start . 
 Do you want to eat breakfast here ? 
 Okay by me . 
 You mean this month ? 
 Over 2 million . 
 No problem . Who is it ? Anyone I know ? 
 That name doesn't ring a bell . But tell me more . 
 Well , I'll have to personally thank him by making him my famous chocolate cake . 
 Absolutely ! Bob and his whole family are welcome here any time ! 
 I'm sorry , but there's no one here by that name . 
 Yes , this is . What number are you calling ? 
 Sure it is . This is 6666777 . 
 It doesn't matter . Bye-bye ! 
 I ’ Ve been having problems getting onto the Internet . 
 Yes , they're fine . I suppose.the server might be down again . 
 It would be nice to go to the beach sometime this weekend . 
 The weather this weekend is supposed to be warm . 
 I think it will be . 
 I want this trip to be perfect , I hope it stays warm . 
 I know . Every day the weather seems different . 
 That would make it easier for us to make plans . 
 Good afternoon , Felix Wassermann Associates . Lawson speaking , how can I help you ? 
 B :: Miao Eng ! I'd know that voice anywhere . What can I do for you ? Any problems ? 
 That is good news . 
 Perfect . Thanks very much for calling . See you soon , bye ! 
 Yes , of course . 
 I'd be very pleased . 
 I think he should be an expert of everything . 
 Because English is nothing but a tool which is used when people may negotiate in international conferences , probe into physics , release some information in a press conferrence , and do anything we can do with language . Therefore , an interpreter has to know some expertise in the field he / she serves as an interpreter . Otherwise he / she can not carry out his / her work smoothly . 
 It's my honor , Mr . Mike . By the way , how can I know whether I am accepted or not ? 
 Yes . Thank you very much . I am looking forward to hearing from you . 
 Good-bye . 
 Yes , it is better than last year . They have done a very good job this time . 
 If someone wants to find us , they can look at this floor plan.It shows where all the companies have their booths . 
 Really ? They didn't give you one with your ticket ? 
 That's strange . 
 Are you hungry ? 
 I went across the street . There is a good Chinese restaurant next to the hotel . 
 They must . Let me look at that.Here it is . Cortex . It's on the second floor , next to the Roll booth . 
 For whom ? Cortex ? 
 I've never met Darren.But you're right . That would probably be uncomfortable . 
 Yes , maybe . If you're Darren McDowell , you should probably check . 
 No , I'll stay here at the booth . I ate earlier . Are you going to the Chinese restaurant ? 
 Good morning . I ’ m Liu Yi , from China XYZ Company . We have an appointment with Mr . Thomas . 
 Thank you . 
 Should each of us write separately ? 
 Good afternoon , Miss . 
 What style do you want ? 
 Sure . Here you are . 
 Yes , Miss . Is that all right ? 
 And would you like a manicure ? 
 One hundred yuan , please . 
 Thank you . 
 I'm not sure if we've got any now . Books of that kind are on this shelf . Well , I'm afraid we've sold out . 
 Come some time next week if you like . I think we'll have got some by then . 
 That's all you need to know about the interview for the job as a fireman . Any other questions ? 
 You can contact me any time you need me . Bye ! 
 Hi . My minibar is empty . 
 I finished off everything . 
 The Perrier and the Jim Beam . Let me have three more of each . 
 I really loved the apples in my room . Bring me a few more , please . 
 Oh , yes , speaking of fruit , bring me some grape juice , too . 
 Mr . Li , does the recommendation of the university play an important role in job hitting ? 
 But I doubt the authority because most of the recommendation letters of the university are the same . 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 I'm sorry . All the appointments are filled . 
 Let me see ... Perhaps I could fit you in at five thirty . 
 What about tomorrow morning , then ? 
 I guess it can't be helped . 
 All right , then . See you this afternoon . 
 Good morning , sir . Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 No problem . How would you like your suit ? 
 That's fine . You can get it 6 days later . 
 No , I haven ’ t . 
 Perhaps you left that at school . 
 Well . Didn ’ t you go around to the Smith after school ? You might have left it there . 
 But she can ’ t be home now . She might have gone to the library . 
 Hi , I'm back ! Hmm ... your hair is pretty damaged , and you've got split ends . 
 Well , the trim should fix the split ends , but you might need a deep conditioning treatment . 
 I'm also going to add some layers to frame your face . 
 No problem ! 
 Really ? What can I do ? 
 Umm , OK . Whatever you think will help . 
 Can you use the thinning shears on top , too ? My hair is really thick . 
 I ’ m afraid we are really short staffed this week , Mr . Cranial . I ’ d like to accommodate you , but I just don ’ t think I ’ ll have the time . 
 Not at all , sir . I ’ d just like to push it up to next week . I ’ ll have a lot more free time at the beginning of next week . 
 I ’ d like to apply for a secretarial position . 
 No , but I can write very fast . 
 No , but I ’ d like to learn how to use them . 
 Can you work every day from 9 to 5 ? 
 I couldn ’ t possibly hire you . You can ’ t take shorthand , you can ’ t use a computer , and you can only work part time . 
 I'm not an expert , but that's the impression I have . 
 Needless to say , as a Westerner , it's bread . 
 OK , sir . How do you like your meal ? 
 I'm glad you like it . It's $ 60 in all . 
 Can I ask you what the office rules are ? 
 Is it from 9:00 to 12:00 in the morning and 1:00 to 5:00 in the afternoon ? 
 How are you feeling ? 
 You said you never went to hospital . 
 The good thing is you don't need to go to school . 
 And your Mom and Dad will buy you anything you ask for . 
 I really envy you , Danny . 
 Your sister said you fainted three times during the injection . 
 No matter what , you are still my hero , Daniel . 
 OK , I promise . You promise you will be well soon ? 
 Hello , darling ! Did you have a good day today ? 
 Would you like a drink ? 
 Dinner will be ready at six . Are you hungry ? 
 Oh . Did you pick up the suits from the cleaners ? 
 Good . Are you going to the pub tonight ? 
 Good morning . I came in answer to your advertisement for a salesperson . 
 I'm afraid I haven't had any experience in just this sort of work . I'm studying business administration in college . I want to get a job that would tie in with my studies . 
 I worked in a department store in a small town last summer vacation . 
 I graduated from Beijing University . I majored in business administration . 
 The courses I completed are marketing , business law , business English , statistics , marketing principles , sales management , distribution theory , economies and psychology . 
 I liked sales strategies most . 
 It's an interesting job , and your company is one of the best known . Although I have no work experience as a salesperson , the job description you sent was very interesting . It's a job I've been dreaming of when I was at university . 
 I have an interest in marketing and I would consider graduate study in business in the future . I think my goals will become more clear as I gain experience in sales and marketing . 
 Yes , a little . As you mentioned just now , yours is an American capital company . As far as I know your company is a world famous one which produces cosmetics and skincare products . 
 Will traveling be required in this position ? 
 How often ? 
 That's fine . 
 Yeah , Please do . Now let me show you the house . 
 You bet . This is the nicest room in the district . You know what , I just had all the walls repainted last month . 
 It's a well furnished eat-in kitchen . The stove and the ice-box are in good order , and the plumbing is OK , too . 
 Terrific ! When are you moving in ? 
 May I help you ? 
 We're on clearance sale now . Prices have up to twenty percent off . Do not miss the chance . 
 Madam , you know we ’ re clearing out stock now . It ’ s a real bargain . 
 Thirty percent discount , OK ? That ’ s the lowest price . 
 Marketing has us set up with product launches in five major cities , as well as some sponsoring events throughout the year . All together , there will be 15 events . 
 It's not what you're thinking . These events will give us a wider exposure than most . Take the tri-city marathon for starters . This is a highly publicized event . The television exposure alone will nearly double our customer awareness . 
 We've got a spot in Olympic Stadium sponsoring one of a team's equipment , then a rally for cancer research , and a connection to the inner-city education program . 
 It might seem that way , but this events were all carefully chosen based on marketing research . These are the events that our customers and potential customers care about . 
 Whenever you're ready to check out , I'll be ready , sir . 
 You're right . It's only 9 
 Sir , our storage facility is merely $ 5 an hour . You also need to leave a deposit . 
 Unfortunately , it isn't . VISA or MasterCard will suffice , though . 
 Better hurry , sir . Remember you have to check out in less than half an hour . 
 How about this set ? 
 Your resume says you have had one years experience working in a foreign representative office in Shanghai , may I ask why you quit ? 
 Have you done any work in this field ? What have you learned from the jobs you have had ? 
 Jenny , you should go to bed now . 
 Don't stay up late . 
 Well , honey . Turn off the light , lie down and go to sleep . 
 What ? 
 Oh . Why did she do that ? 
 Sis , why did you ask me to come to this bargain market ? It's so crowded , and you can't find anything that you really want . 
 Are you serious ? How can that be ? 
 Come on . You know , you can never really win . The salesperson never loses . They make their living out of it . 
 Oh , this silk carpet is really beautiful . Look at the pattern , and how delicate it is ! 
 Really ? Oh , this one . I like the cloisonn vase . 
 Come on . They look so cheap . Something else , please . 
 Don't underestimate his taste . I don't think he'd like it . 
 Yeah . Well , anyway , it's up to you . But I can tell that you come here often . 
 Say , how about having Chinese food for a change ? 
 Let's see what we'll take . 
 That's it ! 
 No thanks . I like to run in the morning . I ran a couple of miles when I woke up today . 
 I couldn ’ t either at first , but you get used to it . 
 Well , why don ’ t you come tomorrow ? I ’ ll stop by your house on my way out . 
 I ’ ll give you a call around 6:00 and stop by around 6:30 . 
 Great , I ’ ll see you then . 
 Could I have a word with you ? 
 I am disappointed with your work lately . 
 Here comes the bus . I'll ring you up later . 
 See you ! 
 Yes , please have a seat , and we ’ ll discuss this right now . 
 The counter-offer was acceptable to them , but they want you to pay for the home inspection . 
 It can cost as little as five hundred dollars and as much as one thousand dollars . 
 Yes , it is your choice as you are paying for it . Make a wise investment and choose the best inspector you can find . 
 Let ’ s call them right now . I am sure that they will be happy to hear that you have agreed to pay for the inspection . 
 No , I haven't . 
 No , I don't drink . 
 I've got some cigars . 
 Two small boxes . 
 The organizational structure is the company's framework of communication and authority . 
 Yes , you are right . 
 Hi , this is Susan Smith . I ’ m calling about my appointment with Doctor Brown today at 3 
 I got the flu . I have a fever and a headache . Can I cancel my appointment ? 
 Oh , there ’ s a charge ? Why ? 
 I see . That ’ s ok . I ’ ll pay . 
 No . Not right now . When I feel better I ’ ll call you again . 
 Thank you . 
 The toner has run out and there's none in the stationery cupboard . 
 Is Stanley still singing that Elvis song ? He's really hogging the mic ! 
 He sounds like a sick cow ! 
 I already tried that . Nothing seems to help . 
 Coing out for a walk . 
 Turn right at the third light and then go straight for two blocks . 
 No . It's only a ten-minute walk . 
 You're welcome . 
 I enjoyed everything , as long as I was learning . 
 Yes , I did like Spanish and Music . But I don't remember much Spanish . 
 If you hire me , I'll start studying Spanish again . 
 No , this is just my appetizer ... this is my lunch ! 
 This is good food , it has milk , fruit , grains , nuts ... 
 At least I enjoy my lunch ! What's in your bag ? 
 There's the difference , your wife made it ! I have to make my own lunch ! 
 Thank you . 
 Only as a clerk in a store . 
 I'm a quick learner , Mr.Jenkins . 
 Yes , and I'm a very good driver . 
 Do I have to travel a lot ? 
 But how will I get to know the products ? 
 How much is the salary ? 
 How much commission do your consultants get ? 
 Well , I'm very interested in the job . 
 Thank you . 
 Hello ! You're welcome to Guangzhou Fair . 
 Glad to meet you , Mr . Smith . My name is Wang and here is my name card . I'll be glad to do what I can for you . 
 Glad to . The Fair is a big gathering taking place twice a year , thousands of businessmen from more than a hundred and fifty countries and regions are here to trade with China . 
 Ours is a company special in exporting leather products . And what about yours ? 
 Hello , Sir . Can I help you with anything ? 
 No problem at all . With this service , you can pay up to 10 parties at one time . Are these parties on your current beneficiaries list ? 
 Select ' pay multiple beneficiaries ' , here ... then select ' pay from the account ' in the drop down menu ... OK , good . Then we need to enter the beneficiary statement reference . 
 And your statement reference and the payment amount . Click on next , then ' pay beneficiaries ' . That's it ! All done . 
 I always approach things very enthusiastically . When I begin something , I don ’ t like to leave it half-done . I can ’ t concentrate on something new until the first thing is finished . 
 Dishonesty . It ’ s unacceptable . 
 Of course not . 
 Yes . I gave her my resignation a few days ago . 
 Yes , I think she will . 
 Well , there are several reasons . I don't think my present job is suitable for me . That's the first reason . Secondly , your company has a good reputation . I think it can offer me more challenging opportunities . Last , frankly speaking , I wish to get higher pay . 
 Yes . It's a Korea company and it was built in Beijing five years ago . 
 Yes , I am sorry . I missed the bus . 
 Well , I missed several buses . 
 I , ah ... , I got have late . 
 Well , I ... I lost my wallet , and I ... 
 Yes , I found it again . 
 This morning . I mean ... 
 Hello , Westhaven Company . 
 This is Michael Richard speaking . Who is calling ? 
 You gave me a deep impression then . Can I help you ? 
 We have made the decision to hire you . 
 I will , thank you for calling . 
 It's a small . 
 It has never been worn . It was too small for me so I'm selling it . 
 I got it as a gift so I couldn't take it back . Good luck ! I hope it will fit you ! 
 I guess there is some kind of virus seeking into my computer , I can ’ t send out this e-mail . Do you have the number of the text port ? 
 Of course not , I appreciate that . 
 I see . What can I do now ? 
 Oh , hey , Keri ! You cook , right ! You're a pretty good cook . 
 I want to make an omelet , so actually this is really silly , I've never made one before . How do you make an omelet ? 
 OK . Yeah ! Yeah ! 
 Oh , OK . Wow ! 
 Wow . That sounds really good . 
 Take bus 12 and get off at the terminal station . 
 You are welcome . 
 The railway station ? Just go down this street and turn left at the second corner.The station is at the end of that street . 
 It's about a ten-minute walk . 
 Not at all . 
 Certainly , sir . Double or single breasted ? 
 I see , sir . For a gentleman of your size I would recommend a single-breasted jacket as it does tend to make one look a little slimmer . Just let me take your measurements , Let's see , neck 41cm , chest 110cm , wait 120cm and inside leg 70cm . You do have short legs , sir . 
 Can you come back in three days for a fitting ? 
 Good that way . I can have the suit ready for you two days after that fitting . 
 We usually eat chicken , pork and beef.you eat these meat a lot in your country too , don't you ? 
 I've heard that people in your country like mutton chops . 
 Yes , I have , I tried once when I visited your country last year , I think they were very tasty.Can you cook them ? 
 That sounds great . I'll bring a bottle of wine then . 
 Oh , no , surely . Your ideas were very interesting as well . 
 Oh , that would be lovely . Thank you . 
 Oh , yes . Marvelous ! 
 Can I ask what the position pays ? 
 My current salary is in the range of fifty thousand yuan . 
 Yes , but not including overtime pay . I'm looking for a salary slightly higher than my present one , with opportunities for raises if I work well . 
 I have to support my parents who are advanced in age , so I'd like to commence at HAD 2,500 a month . 
 Generally speaking , there are the company , the job title , job description , requirement , and so on . 
 There are many sources , such as newspaper , Internet and direct visit . 
 Ah , yes , hello . I'm calling to get some info about your PIN services . You see , my friend also has an account with you and also enjoys shopping on the Internet . She recommended I sign up for this service too . 
 I will probably just use it for online shopping . At the moment , I have to meet the seller in person and pay cash , if it's a local seller . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 May I show you the gold ones ? 
 OK . Here they are . 
 One thousand yuan . 
 I'm afraid not . The price is very moderate . 
 We brought the price down only a few days ago . This is definitely a bargain . 
 Would you like me to help you on your new project ? 
 I would enjoy helping with the writing portion . 
 That is OK sometimes . 
 No , I can't be there . 
 I can send that information to you . 
 Ladies and gentlemen , here is the Westminster Abbey . It's one of the oldest buildings in London . 
 Of course . Take your time and enjoy your trip . 
 We will meet at 5:00 right here . 
 Hi , I want to check out . 
 Can I pay by a credit card ? 
 OK . Here is the money . 
 Would you wrap it for me ? 
 How may I help you . sir ? 
 Let me see . I'm sorry . Nothing's been turned in . Do you want to buy another one ? 
 150 yuan for hard seats . 
 Sir ? 
 So , what ’ s new in the kitchen ? That refrigerator is new , isn ’ t it ? 
 That ’ s usual nowadays . You ’ Ve added a few shelves too . 
 Did you buy new cupboards too ? 
 I see that you have bought several new pots and pans and utensils . 
 Looking at the spice rack , I ’ d say you ’ Ve been learning how to make asian food . 
 Both kinds of food are becoming popular . Nowadays , it ’ s very easy to pick up the ingredients at the supermarket . 
 Hi ! I need to request a wake-up call for tomorrow morning . 
 I need two calls , one at 7 and another at 7 fifteen . 
 Actually , can I change the latter wake-up call to 7 thirty . am ? 
 I can't think of anything . If I do think of something , I'll be sure to call again . 
 It's getting late , Mary . 
 Why don't you sleep over ? 
 We can sleep together . 
 Don't forget to call your host mother to tell her . 
 I need to buy some fruit . 
 How much are the pears ? 
 Give me one kilo of those , please . Do you have any fresh plums ? 
 It's a bit too expensive . We can get it for six yuan in the shop next here . 
 Sounds reasonable . I'll take three kilos . 
 Here you are . 
 Yes , I am . 
 How do you do , Mr . Zhang ? I'm glad to meet you . 
 Thank you very much . 
 On the whole , not too bad . 
 Yes , I am , rather . But I'll be all right by tomorrow and ready for business . 
 Thank you . 
 I'd like to . Let's go . 
 Yes . Of my mother standing in the kitchen and me doing my homework before school ... 
 OK ! I'll show you how my mom did it . 
 Yeah , and it's bigger than ours was . 
 Why don't you watch where you're going ? 
 There was plenty of room for me to pull out.You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in . 
 I think my arm is broken . 
 Listen , let's just wait until the police get here.Then we can decide whose fault this accident was . 
 I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ? 
 It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there . 
 Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police . 
 It really hurts . 
 To hell with you . The accident was your fault . 
 To hell with you . 
 Yes we do . Check the meat department . There is a fish counter there too . 
 Let me show you . 
 See , it's right over there . 
 That's all right . 
 Oh , I thought I could make a right turn on red here . 
 Oh , I guess I didn't see it . 
 Here they are . 
 Thank you , Ma'am . 
 Yes , I'm going to the cinema , dad . 
 Oh , I won't be back so early . The film will be over at nine . Can I have the key to the bicycle ? 
 Oh , dad , I'm not a child . I'm 17 already . I'll come back as soon as the film is over . 
 I will . Thank you , dad . 
 It would be good if you could get them to me by Thursday afternoon , Ms.Barkley . 
 7880 Crofton Avenue , Building 40A , Room 304 . 
 A one-way ticket to Chicago , please . 
 One adult , please . 
 We will carry out the order when the purchase order gets here . 
 Well , actually in most cases we don't talk about special deals , but since this one is so new I will listen to what you have to say . 
 I can't agree to that . My company will have to pay for both sending them and bringing them back . 
 OK , I agree . But the repeat order can't have the same terms . 
 Alright , sir . You are making a good choice . Honda has made a lot of design improvements in the new Accord . 
 On all our new cars , the standards include 
 Why not , sir ? 
 Well , sir , I know some of our customers are concerned about cruise control . But Honda has never had a single cruise control malfunction that led to an accident . 
 You know , sir , you don't have to use it . You can turn it on or off . If you don't want to use it , you just never turn it on . 
 No , the sunroof is optional , sir . 
 Telco Mobile , how can I help you ? 
 Certainly sir , we currently have a special promotion where we include voice mail services , call waiting and also three way calling . 
 Not at all . No hidden fees or surcharges , it is a flat monthly rate . 
 Yes of course . We can activate all these services in about an hour . 
 My wife and I want to go to Beijing for a tour . Can you arrange it ? 
 I'd like to know what kind of tour your travel agency has . 
 Excellent . 
 September 28th . 
 We would like to visit the Great Wall , the Ming Tombs and the Imperial Palace . 
 All I do all day is work and watch TV . I really should start thinking about my health . 
 For starters , we should start doing more outdoor activities . That way we'll get some exercise . 
 That's not a bad idea . How much is it ? 
 Playing tennis twice a week will be a good start . Count me in . 
 Here you are . 
 Yes , I am . 
 Fujisan Province . 
 It's not surprising . Our school year just ended , and a lot of Chinese are on vacation . 
 About half a month . 
 Thank you . 
 It's me , Ali . There's this strange guy who keeps coming around . He's been here three times this week . 
 He makes me nervous . He looks at me funny . And he never buys anything ! 
 Are you ready to order ? May I suggest a veal . 
 The chicken is also nice . 
 Our special tonight is lobster . 
 Perhaps you'd enjoy the lamb 
 What ever you say ? 
 Okay . Is all going well ? 
 Really ? That's great . You really did a good job . Anything else to tell me ? 
 OK . If he wants to make any changes , minor alternations can be accepted . Let me know what happens . 
 How do you think a manager should react to an employee ’ s unsatisfactory work ? 
 Exactly , I overheard a manager scold his employee in the elevator this morning , they were from the company on the 12th floor , I guess . They were only three of us in the elevator , I felt very embarrassed to be in the middle of them . 
 Sure , no matter what happened , they should wait to discuss in their office and find the solution in a positive way . 
 I'm not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ? 
 I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly . 
 Did she ? That's great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the environment . 
 Oh , he's fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays . 
 I had mine when I was 24 . That's a little young . I'd suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career . 
 Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in your country ? 
 Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom . 
 Hello . Front desk . How can I help you ? 
 I ’ m sorry . The kitchen is closed after midnight . 
 Good night . 
 Just take your clothes off from the waist up and put this gown on , with the opening in the back . 
 You need to come over here and face this plate . 
 I will need your arms raised to shoulder height . 
 Everything you are doing is perfect . 
 I am just getting behind this screen . You need to take a deep breath , hold it , and then breathe normally . 
 You can get dressed as soon as the film is processed . We will be all done here . 
 Yes , it has great curb appeal . 
 Yes , it is nice , but wait until you see the interior . 
 The carpeting and paint are all new , as well as the window treatments . 
 Come and see the kitchen . 
 Let ’ s go check out the bedroom and bathroom . 
 I am happy that you like the house . We should write down what we like so that we can remember it . 
 Yes , I don't feel well today . 
 Since the day before yesterday . 
 It began with a shiver then I perspired a great deal . 
 Thank you . Doctor . 
 Yes , dad ? 
 Well , no . It just seemed like another bill we ’ d have to pay . 
 That ’ s true . Well , how much do you think I should get ? 
 The blake's got divorced . 
 Mr.black has been getting a little around aside . 
 No , he doesn't . But his wife found out he has been too charming for a long time.Incredibly , he has many different girlfriends . Starting almost right after they married 20 years ago . 
 No , the only thing I've ever done behind your back is zip you up , besides I told all my other girlfriends , and my wife who's getting suspicious . and we had a cold for a while , tell the 
 You are not funny either . I can't believe I married a woman like you . 
 Sure , what's the matter ? 
 What do you think we can do about this ? 
 Well , sir , I am busy in market development . So I am worried whether I can do this . 
 OK ! I will try this . 
 There's no power . 
 Yes , the fuse had blown and I've changed it but now the motor keeps cutting out . 
 Daniel , here is some money for the tickets . 
 Oh , like a gentleman . Two tickets for two people . 
 They may unless we get a half-price ticket for you . 
 You may ask if you can take a half-price ticket . 
 Hello . Do you know how I can find a room to rent ? 
 Will that work ? 
 Good idea . Thank you . 
 Yes , I want to a room for tomorrow . 
 A single one with a private bath . 
 It doesn't matter . 
 You're right . I think it ’ s time to seek professional help . 
 I know you don ’ t want to pay for a job , but I think it ’ s time we consulted a headhunter . 
 Ha , ha , ha ! I agree . That ’ s not much fun . 
 Actually I do . 
 Cooke & Co . does a lot of placements in your field . 
 Not at the moment , but I ’ ll let you know . 
 What's the matter , sir ? 
 No , I haven't sir . 
 But , sir , I didn't drink at all . 
 OK . I'll blow . 
 But I ... 
 Do you know who that tall man is ? 
 Do you know where he comes from ? 
 May I help you , sir ? 
 Regular or unleaded ? 
 How many gallons do you want ? 
 All right . Shall I check the oil ? 
 You're a quart low . 
 Yes , sir . 
 Everything looks so good . Is there anything in particular that you recommend ? 
 So you're saying I can't go wrong with anything I order ? In that case ... 
 That sounds really good ! Does it come with a soup ? 
 I see what you mean ! 
 What happened ? 
 Did you promise me to get the bread ? 
 But you forgot to get the bread . 
 Well , I certainly did . 
 You are free . You can go now . 
 I'll do with the cake . 
 Get up , you lazybones ! 
 what ’ s the cheapest way to go there ? 
 Oh , is that right ? Is there a subway station near here ? 
 Good . Can I walk through this building ? 
 I see . Thank you . 
 I'm Mr.Stephen ' s secretary . He has an appointment with Mr.Green today . 
 I'm afraid we have to reschedule it . 
 I'm very sorry . But Mr.stephen must leave for Hong Kong right away . 
 That'll be fine . 
 Really ? How can he be so sure about the timing ? 
 Well . This must save lots of employees from worrying about how to write a salary increase letter . You know how tough it is . Do all the employees receive the same pay increase annually ? 
 I like this system . It will encourage the best employees and motivate those who want to make a change at work . 
 Yes . We just had a basketball match with Class Two . 
 They did . 
 Seventy to sixty-seven . 
 Really ? I have a weakness for coffee . 
 No , I assure you . 
 Ok . 
 Of course . 
 I'll see . I will if I can but I won't promise . 
 Yes . But only if you ask me nicely . 
 Ok . I'll keep my promise . 
 Yes . I'm looking for a green dress . 
 I wear size 32 . This one looks nice . Where may I try it on ? 
 How does it look ? 
 How much is it ? 
 I'll take it . 
 Here is the copy . Do you need anything else ? 
 Do you mean all the sales letters from them ? 
 I ’ ll get them for you at once . And could I file the report for you ? 
 No problem . 
 Yes . The porter will go and help you . 
 OK , sir . 
 I listen to various types of music . 
 I enjoy listening to both Rock and R & B . 
 I enjoy the different types of instruments that they use . 
 That's exactly what I think too . 
 Dude , what are you talking about ? Only girls do that . 
 True . So what do they do to you at your beauty spa ? 
 That doesn't really sound like something I would be interested in . In any case , I just wash my face every night and use sunscreen during the day . 
 Uh ... no . 
 You mean the large one or the small one ? 
 They're on special this week . They've been reduced to five dollars . 
 No . We have some that are different in style but not in color . They're over there . Do you see the sign ? 
 Very well . Just take your time . 
 Barbie dolls are quite popular , you know . 
 Take a look at the newest Barbie — Digital Barbie . 
 Our regular price for Digital Barbie is $ 29.95 plus tax . 
 Another one sold . Do you see anything else you would like ? 
 Tax brings your total to $ 32.42 . How would you like to pay ? 
 Here's your change . Thank you . 
 What's your last name ? 
 Yes , I do show your reservation . How could you like to pay for the room ? 
 Fine . Here is your room key , here is also a map of our hotel . The swimming pool , gym and sauna are all located on first floor . 
 Yes . If you want to order room service , just press 0 on your phone , and that will connect you with the front desk . 
 Don't forger to come straight home after school . 
 Have you got everything ? 
 Well , that was an interesting documentary ! 
 Like what ? 
 Yeah , I know it sounds weird , but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . Through a you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire , you can rest peacefully on your nest egg . 
 That seems a bit unstable don ’ t you think ? 
 I ’ Ve been thinking of doing that lately ! I don ’ t want some banker to run off with my money ! 
 Well , we won't be able to guarantee you a room for February 22 , but we can book you on February 23.Is that OK ? 
 Hello . I would like to buy some business cards . 
 Two thousand would be fine . 
 All I want is the same thing on this card . 
 ... Okay , I'm finished . Here's your form and my old card . 
 Do you think you could finish it in three days ? 
 how do you feel about wearing name logos or slogans on your clothing ? 
 do you think advertising has an influence on the choices you make when you're shopping ? 
 I actually try to avoid name-brand items . I can't stand it when big companies advertise their products all over the place ! 
 What kind do you need ? 
 The ground beef is $ 2.48 a pound . 
 What else would you like ? 
 The chicken breasts are $ 4.05 a pound . 
 Altogether , it's going to be $ 12.15 . 
 All right , let me get your meat for you . 
 What range of salary do you have for this position ? 
 It sounds amazing to me . 
 Do you have any idea how many you'd like ? 
 Would you fill out this form , please ? 
 If you detect any difference , I'll take you out to dinner . 
 Thank you . Your order will be ready seven days from now . 
 We can certainly give you faster turn around , but it will cost you extra . 
 First , as far as I know , your company has had an impressive growth record.Second , I want to get into the foreign trade business . 
 I'm in charge of marketing activities in South-East Asia , for example , organizing trade conferences and arranging exhibitions . 
 Yes . Are the chances for employees to be transferred to overseas branches of the company ? 
 That would be good . 
 Ah , yes , that's right . 
 Hello , I was just looking for the guide 。 
 Not bad . But I've made too many flights these days . I could hardly remember how many take offs and landings I've been through these three days . I think we all feel a bit tired . 
 Wonderful . I'm eager to take a sauna as soon as possible . 
 I'm sure we will . Actually , we are looking forward to seeing the great wonder . 
 Sorry to say it , but neither of those . I'm here to close our account with you . The market around here has been dropping for a while now , and it's just not sensible for us to stay . 
 I guess I should just withdraw everything . 
 Here you go . That's everything , then . Thanks very much for your service over the years . 
 sure , here you are . 
 yeah , I think the food is alright , it's not too spicy though it's a little salty for me . But you are Chinese , you should have known better . 
 Oh , I see how this food can be really hard for you . I can sympathize with that . I stayed in Sichuan for a year . The food was difficult at the beginning . Every dish was so spicy . After a while , I got u 
 I completely understand . I didn't intend on liking spicy food at first either , but when you have no other choicest , you've got to adapt . 
 exactly . 
 I really would rather just listen.Isn ' t there anyone else who wants to sing ? 
 I know , but ... Hey , Stanley's here ! I've been wanting to hear him sing all night . 
 I'll put the song at the front of the list . 
 You got it ! In a sense , it has become a byword for Chinese sport . 
 I think its critical advantage lies in its low cost . All you need is a racket , a table and a light celluloid ball . Tables are usually available in public recreation areas , like finest rooms , and outdoor playgrounds ... 
 Put it there ! In senior high schools , we used to play on desks in the classroom , when no vacant tables were available . Likewise , the racket may take a variety of forms , too.Anything that resembles a racket , from a plank to cardboard or even a hardcover book , may be used as a racket . 
 Yeah , the sport is affordable and accessible to every Tom , Dick and Jane in this developing country . No wonder even the state leaders are known to be keen on it . 
 Actually , he excels in it . Chairman Mao , too , encouraged the whole nation to play ping-pong as a part of the nationwide body building campaign . 
 Julia , the apartment I looked at today is pretty decent-around 120 square meters . 
 A new two-bedroom apartment , around 100 to 120 square meters , in the Sanlitun area . 
 Very quiet and safe . And it's got a lot of trees and plants . 
 Yeah , it's near a bus stop . 
 The total cost is 850 dollars . How would you like to pay ? 
 We take Visa and Master Card . 
 No , we don't . 
 Thank you ... please sign on the line . 
 Look at this one . It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers . 
 Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture . 
 Let's have the salesmen for a demonstration . 
 I think the file is too big . You'll need to expand your memory . First , close down all the files you have open , and then ... 
 Let's eat the kind that has both spicy and mild broth in one pot . 
 Yep . That way I can satisfy my craving for spicy food and you can eat hot pot without burning into flames . 
 Let's go ! 
 No problem . 
 Oh , Never mind , I finished my paper . So you can use it tonight . 
 Hello , miss . Where is the button that controls my seat ? 
 Oh , I see . By the way , what shall I do if changes in altitude create pressure on the ears ? 
 Excuse me , Sir , you are not supposed to smoke here . 
 Your seat is in the non-smoking section , so please refrain from smoking . 
 Then I'll try to find a seat in the smoking section . One moment . please.Thank you for waiting . I found a seat in the smoking section for you . 
 Do you have all types of seafood here ? 
 What do you recommend ? 
 OK , we will try it . 
 Two bottles of white wine , please . 
 Yes . I should have gone to buy the ticket in advance . But now ... 
 Right . Let's go and find some fun . 
 Yes , there are three stops left . 
 Well , you will get there in about a quarter of an hour if the traffic isn ’ t too heavy . 
 Sure , madam . I ’ ll remind you . 
 Let me see your form . You mentioned that you want five days to go back home for New Year , right ? 
 Do you still remember we already have a New Year celebration on January 1st ? 
 Well , I understand that . Your request is approved . Remember to give my best regards to your parents . 
 I'm quite active and energetic . I approach things enthusiastically and I don't like to leave things half-done . 
 I'm quite outgoing i think . I enjoy mixing and doing things with others . 
 I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . A person can't live all by himself I think . A friend in need is a friend in deed.The more really close friends I have , the better . 
 People who are honest , dedicated to their work and having integrity . 
 Many of our business friends in England , France , Switzerland , Italy and Germany are paying for our exports in Japan currency . It is quite easy to do so . 
 Many banks in Europe now carry accounts in yen . They are in a position to open letters of credit and effect payment in yen . Consult your banks and you'll see that they are ready to offer you this service . 
 Sure you can . Several of the banks in London , such as the National Westminster Bank and Barclays Bank are in a position to open letters of credit in yen . They'll do so against our sales confirmation or contract . 
 Next please . Hello . How can I help you ? 
 Would you like one way or round trip ? 
 When will you be leaving ? 
 In about 2 hours . 
 First class or coach ? 
 OK , let me check availability . I'm sorry . Tickets for that flight are sold out . 
 Let me see . Yes , that one still has seats available . Would you like me to reserve a seat for you ? 
 That'll be 120 dollars . 
 Thank you , here's your change . 
 I have some shirts that need laundering , and I ’ d like my suit pressed . 
 How long will it take to get my clothes back ? 
 That ’ s all right . Pls send someone to pick it up . 
 Tina Li , Financial Planner , how may I be of service ? 
 It certainly is . You can do almost anything with it , anytime , anywhere . 
 All you need to do is sign up at any one of our branches and you can use the service right away . 
 It's a pleasure . Thanks for calling Lincoln Bank . 
 Sure , sir . How many of you are there ? 
 No problem , sir . When are you coming to dinner ? 
 What about the working hours ? 
 I like flexible hours . 
 No , I don't . 
 Oh it was really good . Do you know , he ’ s the nicest boss I ’ Ve had here . 
 What ’ s more , he said I was the hardest working person in the office ! 
 I hope so . Then I ’ ll be the happiest person in our office too ! 
 Hello , I would like a room please . 
 A double room sounds great . 
 A few nights , I'm not quite sure of my schedule yet . 
 Here you are . 
 Since it is low season , we are running a special rate right now of 150 yuan per night . 
 Our rooms include television set , air-conditioning and a bathroom . 
 Yes , sir . 
 You're welcome . 
 Is he ? Yes , he looks pale . Is there anything I can do for him ? 
 Certainly . 
 Well , yes . I'll give him the medicine , too . 
 Hello , this is Francis . 
 Today , I am busy all day long . 
 That ’ s not good for me at all . It'll have to be another time . 
 I know . I am available from 1 PM to 4 PM on Friday afternoon . 
 See you . 
 I want to go to Lid Hotel . 
 Which bus should I take then ? 
 Thank you so much ! 
 Excuse me , can I use your computer to type my paper ? 
 I am afraid I can't finish typing it this afternoon.When will you use it tonight ? 
 Thanks a lot ! 
 Many children are learning drawing , dancing , swimming and so on in their spare time . You can follow suit . 
 Well , you should talk with your son and let him make his own decision . 
 Excellent ! Let ’ s set off . 
 Hold on , please . 
 Sorry , but she's out . 
 I'd be glad to . 
 Someone has stolen my gold necklace . 
 Of course not . 
 Yes , I've looked everywhere in my room and I can ’ t find it . 
 Last night on the dresser . I took it off before I went to the shower , and forgot to put it back on after the shower . And this morning I left the hotel in a hurry without wearing it . 
 Yes , I am positive . 
 Yes , I think I did . It has to be one of your maids who took it . I want my necklace back . 
 That just isn't good enough . Cet me your general manager . I want to speak to him now . 
 Did you hear who won the election ? 
 I couldn ’ t be happier to know that he ’ s our new President . 
 You voted for him , right ? 
 I voted for him . 
 So am I . 
 I have faith in him . 
 Are you willing to work abroad ? 
 How about your family ? 
 Hello , sir . Can I help you ? 
 12:00 . You have to wait for a while . 
 Well , sir . Come with me . I will show you the waiting room . You must be tired . Have a short rest there . We will call you later . 
 Could I have my bill , please ? 
 I'm afraid there has been a mistake . 
 I believe you have charged me twice for the same thing . Look , the figure of 6.5 dollar appears here , then again here . 
 I need to get some beef . 
 I want to get some ground beef . 
 I would like four pounds of ground beef . 
 I would like the extra lean . 
 Thank you very much . 
 I appreciate that . 
 Hello , nice to meet you . I ’ m Mr . Gotcha . Have any trouble finding the place ? 
 So why don ’ t you tell me why you are interested in changing positions ? 
 What would you consider your strengths ? 
 What is your biggest weakness ? 
 We have a position where that could work out well . 
 The current owners will be moving out on Tuesday , so technically you could pick up the keys and move in on Wednesday . 
 You need to contact the utility company and make arrangements to transfer the utilities to your name . 
 If I were you , I would take a few days to take care of those things before you move in . 
 That would be perfect . That way , someone will be there , but you will have them right away . 
 I think that I have something else really important to do on that day . I just can ’ t remember what it is . 
 You are right . My mum must be crazy . 
 Wow . You are a real snake . 
 I know , I know . Kill , or die , right ? 
 I really feel sorry for that rhumba boy if he ever identifies himself . 
 Do you know what exporters consider ? 
 Could you talk about it in detail ? 
 I understand . Thank you . 
 It was a pleasure , Mrs . Robinson . 
 I helped break ... I mean WASH ... all the dishes ! 
 Yeah , uh , it's outside . Listen , I really have to be going now . 
 Hello , welcome to IBA . What can I do for you ? 
 We certainly do . May I ask you the purpose of the rental ? 
 I see . We have various rental periods . How long would you like to rent it for ? 
 You can choose a short-term or yearly rental . 
 May I please speak to Tom ? 
 Haven't run into you for ages ! 
 Really ? 
 Yes . I've been through them and there's a problem , a rather major discrepancy actually . You see ? It should be KN509 . 
 Exactly , if we accept these it could cause a lot of problems in our record and our accounts system because the numbers don't match . 
 Good evening , this is housekeeping . May I help you ? 
 Yes , sir . We'll be there shortly . 
 Everything is OK now . 
 You are welcome . It's our job to keep things running smoothly . 
 The significance of understanding the nuance and distinctions of foreign customs and business practices are a continual challenge for global entrepreneurs and trader . Despite many countries accession to TO membership , trade and investment frictions are still predominant among existing membership . However , these frictions will be better managed under the TO trade rules and the organization's dispute settlement mechanism . 
 Problem and disputes occur mainly due to difference in the laws of countries involved . For this very reason , it is imperative to establish from the outset which law governs when disputes arise . The most fundamental principle of all international contracts is the applicable laws and regulations . Make sure that the arbitration clause in your business contract be all-inclusive . 
 Yes , it will be your utmost interest to protect your intellectual property such as your innovations , idea , designs and copyrights in your target country . 
 The lack of regulatory transparency was a problem and still is to some extent . However , the countries are moving forward to deepen their reforms , new changes will involve the establisher of legal structures to sustain high levels of foreign as well a domestic private investments . This will surely strengthen the law and regulations in the countries , especially , areas related to trade issues . 
 Precisely , the actions the countries have committed to take are consistent with TO agreement . 
 Don't worry about it . It's just a drop in the bucket . That car has more scratches on it than I can count . 
 Very well , thank you . And you ? 
 That's right . How nice to see you again . 
 they are doing well . 
 Of course . They will be happy you asked about them . 
 Thank you for your invitation . I'm free tonight . 
 I prefer seafood . 
 That's fine . I'll be waiting for you . 
 Bye . 
 Do you have any other symptoms ? 
 Just a little . Has your toothache gone now ? 
 How about your tongue ? Does it still hurt ? 
 How did you get that burn again ? 
 You haven't had much luck lately , have you ? 
 When's the last time you took your tablets ? 
 I think it's time you took another dose of each . What would you like to drink with them ? 
 Sure , I'll just go and get it now . what would you like to eat ? Some soup ? 
 soup always makes me feel better when I'm sick . I hope it makes you feel better , too . 
 Yes , everything is fine . 
 Didn't they announce that our flight was delayed ? 
 We boarded the plane on time , but then we were held up for almost an hour due to a maintenance problem . 
 We finally took off , but about 30 minutes later , the captain came on to the loudspeaker to warn us that there would be some bad turbulence for most of the flight . 
 Yes , but this was the worst turbulence I'd ever experienced in my life ! Everyone started getting sick . The flight attendants had to stay in their seats . The captain decided to land early . 
 We landed in Southampton and waited an hour for the storms to pass and then took off again . 
 It wasn't too bad . At lease I'm alive . 
 I managed to get a sandwich from a flight attendant . How about you ? 
 Do you have any more questions ? 
 Let's call it a day then.Good - bye , everyone . 
 Can we talk ? 
 I ’ m not too clear on some things about my lease . 
 How many years is my lease for ? 
 Can I move out before those three years ? 
 Why would you keep it ? 
 I get it now . 
 What's the admission charge ? 
 Two adult passes , please . 
 Three twenty-five cent stamps , please . 
 And please send this letter by registered mail . 
 There's a check for two hundred dollars and a photograph . 
 No , don't bother . 
 I'm going to go to the concession stand and get some popcorn and Coke . 
 What are you talking about ? We always eat the stuff here . 
 But what's a movie without munchies ? 
 John , do you have a minute ? 
 Well , I ’ Ve been meaning to talk to you about the situation in the office . 
 That ’ s exactly what I ’ m getting at . We ’ re supposed to be able to do our preparation and marking in that office , but have you noticed ? Jack constantly has students coming in to get help with his course . A lot people are going in and out . 
 No , not yet , but someone ’ s going to have to . 
 No , of course not . But I ’ m not able to do my work and neither are you . 
 Oh , that would be too small . 
 Come to think of it , you may be on to something . Let ’ s go have a look . 
 Do you have any seat preference , madam ? 
 Would you like a window seat ? 
 I am sorry , there is no window seat in the non-smoking room . 
 If I understand the terms correctly , the length of the contract would be one year with a one-year option . Is that correct ? 
 I was under the impression that both contracts had the same terms . 
 Could you elaborate on that ? 
 Let me see if I have that right . This contract is for six months of training , but if it isn't cancelled , continues for another six months . Is that right ? 
 Okay , that's clear enough . Let's move on to the other terms . 
 Have you got any identification ( ID ) with you ? 
 What currency will you have ? 
 All right , and how will you have it ? 
 Here you are . 
 Jack , I don't know how to write my resume . Could you tell me about that ? 
 What does the contact information include ? 
 Anything else ? 
 I see . It is the position desired 
 I see . Skills are about specialty , and educational background is easy as well . But what about related experience ? I have little work experience . 
 I see . By the way , should I write the educational background starting from elementary school ? 
 Thank you very much . I will write it right now . 
 Hello , madam . Where to ? 
 No problem.Get in now . 
 All right.Got it . 
 Thank you . It's very kind of you to invite me to such a beautiful place . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Thank you . Oh , it tastes nice . 
 I ’ m fine . I ’ Ve been out of town . I just got back . 
 I was in New York for a wedding . 
 I cannot , Mum . Nobody can help me ! 
 Gosh ! The water faucet is dripping badly again . 
 I know . I ’ Ve got to get it fixed ASAP . 
 I wish I could , but I ’ Ve got to go now . I have an appointment in 20 minutes . 
 Oh , by the way , could you give me a ride ? My car is still in the garage . 
 Taxi . 
 Central Park , please , but can you make a stop at Union Square ? I wanna pick up my friend there . 
 How long do you think it will take to get to Union Square . 
 Can you make it in 15 mins . I am already 10 mins late . 
 On the 14th Street side . Oh , we are already at the 16th Street . You are fast . Can you make a left at the next corner ? 
 I think he is around here . Can you slow down ? Ah , there he is . 
 Thank you . How much is it ? 
 Here's $ 15 . Keep the change . 
 ( Bob groans . ) What's the matter.Bob ? 
 What happened ? 
 Can you stand ? 
 We'll have to get you to a hospital for an X-ray . 
 It may be worse than it seems . How's it feel ? 
 Someone will be out to take a look any minute now . 
 Of course ! It's the sort of thing a hospital emergency ward is for . Will we have to wait much longer ? 
 What kind of breakfast do you want ? 
 Yes , a continental one contains eggs , bacon , toast and juice . American one is the same as a continental one except the egg . 
 What kind of packing do you plan to use for this consignment of goods ? 
 I'm concerned about the possible jolting , squeezing and collision that may take place when these cases are moved about . 
 In that case , I guess I can rest assured . 
 You're right . But wouldn't it be safer to use wooden cases ? 
 It wouldn't be worth the trouble in that case , would it ? Let's still use cartons . 
 Hello . Can I help you ? 
 I'm afraid it is still being washed . 
 Yes , we can . But you need wait a moment . 
 Yes , it will be ready then . 
 No problem . 
 We'd like to have break fast in our room tomorrow ; Would you please arrange it for us ? 
 Shall I make an order now ? 
 That's really convenient . 
 Boy , you are lost . It's across town . 
 You can take a No . 12 bus here and then transfer to a No . 23 bus to get there . 
 Yeah , it'll take us there . 
 I always catch this bus . 
 It only takes about half an hour . 
 We can get off the bus right behind Macy's . 
 Yeah , it's right in the parking lot . 
 Yeah , I know . 
 Sorry , I can ’ t . I ’ m busy . 
 I always do volunteer work on the first Saturday of every month . 
 I help out at the children ’ s hospital . I help plan activities . 
 Yeah . It ’ s exciting . This month we ’ re doing crossword puzzles . 
 Yes . This is room 804 . I can't find my coat . I was wondering if it's in the lost and found . 
 It's a light blue coat . It's got a hood and a big silver zipper . 
 Last night . I think I may have left it in the lobby bar . 
 Thanks . I appreciate that . 
 Yes . Do you have any seats available on a flight for Beijing leaving at 15 
 One economy , please . 
 Yes , I want a pair of sport shoes , Jordan . 
 Size 41 . 
 They fit me . Can you make it a little cheaper ? 
 Have the owners answered back with a counter-offer for my offer to purchase the house ? 
 That sounds pretty good to me , but I am not sure what to do . 
 If I make another offer and they refuse , then what ? 
 Let ’ s try going with three hundred and thirty thousand dollars for a counter-offer . 
 Do you think that this will move along fairly quickly ? 
 Any phone calls for me while I was out ? 
 Thank you . 
 What qualities do you think a business manager should possess ? 
 If a client complains about the service of your department , what will you do ? 
 Hey , Tom . I saw this ad in the paper . You should take a look . 
 It's for a job . It looks perfect for you . 
 Come on ! What have you got to lose ? 
 Here , I ’ ll help you type one up . 
 I hear Fred is a very good student in your class . 
 What do you mean by on the whole . 
 Can you get me a taxi ? 
 Thanks , but no thanks . A taxi will do just fine . 
 No , I hate limousines . They're gas guzzlers . 
 My destination is Rockefeller Center . 
 As soon as possible . 
 Okay , I'm coming downstairs now . 
 These vegetables taste very sweet . 
 Really ? Dad , how do you know how to plant organic vegetable ? 
 Dad , come on ! Just tell me . 
 You ’ re free to go . 
 What are your plans now that you ’ re getting out ? 
 What is your major going to be ? 
 I hope I don ’ t ever see you back in here . 
 This really isn ’ t the place for you . 
 Good luck out there . 
 What are you here for today ? 
 Is the arresting officer here ? 
 Plead your case . 
 Why would the officer lie ? 
 Did the camera take a picture of your license plate ? 
 There was no picture taken , so I'll let you go . 
 You have been doing a great job this year and I am very satisfied with your work . 
 Based on your contribution , I would like to give you a pay raise . Your monthly salary will be increased by 800 Yuan . This increase includes an 80 % married increase based on your achievements and increase responsibilities and then the additional 20 % increase were reflecting the changes in cost of living . 
 I am sorry for damaging your car , sir . 
 The car park in this community is over crowded , isn't it ? 
 There aren't enough buses in this city , are there ? 
 That's too much of hassle . We just want a little bigger parking space . 
 No . but I'm gonna . You know , several months ago , I backed into red Honda when parking . 
 No , right here in the parking lot . It was parked right here in your space . The left rearview mirror was smashed . 
 Yes ! How do you know that ? 
 Do you really think we can beat WebTracker ? 
 How can you be so sure ? Do you know something I don't ? 
 What's step two ? 
 Michael , it is time to wake up . 
 Yes , it is time to wake up . And , also , from now on I will speak only English to you . And you should speak only English to me , too . 
 Right . That's good . 
 I know you can do it . 
 That is great . All I want is for you to do your best in everything you do . 
 No Let's go to an ice cream parlor ! They have way more flavors to choose from there . I feel like having something special like Neapolitan ice cream . 
 It's three different flavors mixed together . Chocolate , strawberry and something green with candied fruit . 
 Absolutely ! They also have real Italian Galatian and French sorbets . They do a great baked Alaska . 
 Well ... l like the traditional flavors like rum raisin , butter pecan . maple walnut , strawberry , chocolate and vanilla . But now there are some new flavors from Asia like green tea and durian . 
 That's OK . We can go jogging , after we eat ! 
 I think I ’ m tough not only physically but mentally . 
 I have been playing football since high school . At present , I ’ m a member of a community football club . 
 Yes . I practice every weekend with my teammates . 
 I never get tired . I think this comes from practicing football . 
 Frankly speaking , I ’ m a typical Chinese workaholic . I don ’ t mind working late at night . Due to that , I tend to leave the office late . 
 So far I haven ’ t met any particular kind . However , I may rule out those who prefer chatting to working . 
 It depends on the type of work . Usually I prefer to work alone , because I ’ m self-motivated . But I can work either way . If necessary , I don ’ t hesitate to join the team . 
 Your job includes paper filing a lot . Anc you will have to check and fill the stationer cabinet regularly . Besides , you have to reserve the meeting room in advance if the are any important visitors . 
 Of course to me . 
 Is that right ? I didn't know it . 
 Will you forgive me ? Could you return my camera ? 
 Oh , I see.Then can I buy slides and picture postcards somewhere ? 
 Mary sings much better than Susan , doesn't she ? 
 Maybe it's because Susan's parents are both painters . 
 I could go for that . But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year . 
 We should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away . How about the countryside ? There must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air . 
 Tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist . What about next Monday ? 
 No need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know . 
 Great ! Oh , one more thing , don't forget to check the weather before we go . I'd hate to get caught in the rain . 
 Me , too . Now let's make a list for what we need to with us . 
 Haven't seen you for ages.Where have you been ? 
 In Thailand . I taught English there . 
 It depends what it is . Once we have disconnected the unit , we do as many jobs as we can . If there is something that isn't broken but might cause a problem before the next service then of course we repair it or replace that part . But if it's not urgent , we make a note in the service record to carry out that repair next time . 
 There is a supermarket in Kensington High Street . I'll come and give you a hand . 
 Here , take one of these trolleys . What do you want exactly ? 
 The fruit and vegetables are over there . 
 Over there . 
 Just fine , Mr . Emory . Could you please sign this memo ? I want to get it out to everybody this afternoon . 
 Yes . That ’ s for today . Thank you . 
 I want a leather jacket . 
 Size 40 . 
 Let me see . Do you think a brown one will do ? 
 Really ? Please get it for me . 
 Is this dress made of pure silk ? 
 Is it washable ? 
 How much , please ? 
 All right . Will you wrap it for me ? 
 What do you consider to be your weakness ? 
 Anything else ? 
 Rich ! I ’ m glad I caught you . Mr . Carlton ’ s just come over here from the main office . 
 He needs to see the two of us to talk about next week ’ s annual sales meeting . 
 How long will it take for our order to be delivered ? 
 Fine . We will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control . 
 Professor Wang , what is non-tariff barrier ? 
 Can you give an example ? 
 Why ? 
 Oh , Are there other means ? 
 This is designed to exclude them from domestic market , isn't it ? 
 Is this the workshop to prepare for an interview ? 
 I am really excited to be taking this workshop so that I can get ready for my interview next week . 
 I think that we should dress neatly and appropriately . 
 Yes , and I always feel much better when I am friendly . 
 Any more hints as to what I should do in an interview ? 
 Hello . I'm now trying to take a bath , but there are too many buttons.Would you tell me how to use them ? 
 I read it , but I couldn't understand it.Would you come to my room and tell me how to use them ? 
 And also tell me how to use other switches . 
 Oh really what ’ s happening ? 
 Ok but you must stay calm . Do you want me to give you a lift ? 
 Ok , wait one minute . I must remember where I left the keys . 
 Speaking . 
 0K . Well , I suppose I have no choice . What do you want me to do ? 
 I'm going out in about half an hour . 
 Oh , around seven o'clock , I suppose . 
 OK . I'll do that . 
 What seems to be the problem ? 
 Let ’ s have a look . Mmmm . This doesn ’ t look too good . I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth . It ’ s pressing against your molars and that ’ s one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain 
 First we will take some x-rays and see what we ’ re dealing with . I also noticed a small cavity up front here , so you are going to need a filling . 
 It could be that , or maybe you are eating too many sweets . In any case , I ’ ll administer an anesthetic and you won ’ t feel a thing ! 
 Sure . Wait for a moment . Here you are . 
 Here is the menu . 
 I'm feeling a bit airsick . 
 Thank you . oh , can you get me some orange juice as well ? 
 Hi , Madam , I'm new here , could you tell me where is boarding gate ? 
 Wait a second , please . Oh , it's CA193 . 
 Yes . 
 It's so nice of you . 
 We should make it , if there isn't too much traffic . 
 Yes , but don't worry . We'll make it . 
 Oh , do you really like it ? 
 Well , it's kind of you to say so . 
 Sure . It's really very easy . First , mix together an egg , two teaspoons of salt , and two pounds of ground beef . Then , add two ounces of milk . Are you with me ? 
 OK . Next , put the mixture into a baking pan and bake it forty-five minutes at 360 degrees . 
 Sure . Bake it forty-five minutes at 360 degrees . 
 Hi Cody , how did practicing go this week ? 
 Great ! Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first . Good , good . This week , work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note . Now let ’ s take a look at this tricky section . 
 It might work . I ’ ll have to hear it . Show me what you ’ Ve done . Not bad . 
 It ’ s just nerves . Just play the right hand for now . One two three four five six , ta ti tri-ple-ti . Good , good . Don ’ t forget the accidentals ! The key signature says that note should be a G-sharp but now it ’ s a G-natural . Now add the bass clef . You ’ re going too fast . Remember the tempo for this piece is andante . 
 Yes , much better . Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal . What was that ? 
 That ’ s ok , keep going , you ’ re moving ahead by leaps and bounds . Watch your dynamics ! Keep your elbows lifted . Remember to stroke the keys , don ’ t pound . That ’ s better ! Remember that as a pianist or any other musician , your technique will be what separates you from the pack just as much or more so as your musicianship . 
 Thank you , Bob ! This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many , a series of unprecedented meteorological events occurred around the world . In Switzerland , a major avalanche was reported in the Alps . Fortunately , no one was injured . Due to to the extreme cold this winter , a blizzard has struck the US Midwest , causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled . 
 Not a great week for the world ! Any good news ? 
 Would you like to have this kind of suitcase ? 
 You can check it , sir . 
 Are you going to vote ? 
 Yeah , but what day are the elections ? 
 That ’ s why I ’ m asking you . 
 Really ? 
 Good thing you told me . 
 It slipped my mind . 
 I want to get a snack at the cafeteria . 
 I may just get some chips . 
 What do you want to get ? 
 What kind do you want ? 
 What kind of chocolate ? 
 I don't think they sell Kit Kats . 
 I really think all Americans look alike . 
 But they do . 
 They wear the same clothes , they ’ re all blond , they all drive cars , they all own Parker fountain pens ; they all drink Coca Cola , and they all chew gum . 
 Maybe I am just homesick . I know you ’ re right . I just miss China , that ’ s all . 
 Is everything OK ? 
 So , since when is your house a bank ? 
 I mean , what ’ s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows . 
 What ’ s the matter with you ? Why are you acting all paranoid ? 
 OK , well , what did you want to see me about ? 
 I can't believe my eyes , Bill . Are you having a salad for lunch ? No hamburger ? 
 I know . But why are you suddenly interested in lessening your salt intake ? 
 Do you have hypertension ? I would have thought you were too young . 
 Well , I'm glad you're starting to pay more attention to your diet . 
 So do I . That's why I've been trying to lower my cholesterol level . 
 That's right . I could stand to lose a few pounds , too . 
 How long have your headaches been going on ? 
 Any unusual amounts of stress in your life going on right now ? 
 Have you been able to sleep regular hours ? 
 Has anything hit you in the head lately ? 
 Let ’ s have you come back in a few days and see how you feel . 
 Yes , but it's quite a ways . 
 This bus doesn't take you directly there.You ' d have to change buses twice . I suggest you walk . It'll take you less than 20 minutes . 
 Go straight ahead through the intersection . 
 Keep walking till ou pass the square , then turn right . Walk past two lights and turn left at the third . 
 Keep walking and look for a tall building . 
 The right side . ICCC should be on the first floor . 
 You're welcome . 
 Yes . I believe you have a luncheon meeting this coming Wednesday . Could you give me some more information about that ? 
 Mmm , that sounds very interesting . 
 How much is it ? Is three hundred dollars enough ? 
 Oh , you've already grown up , son . 
 What is it ? It's eight in the morning . 
 No . I'm not a religious person . 
 Maybe next weekend . I went to bed too late last night . 
 Alright . 
 It is my honor to have this chance for this interview . Well , my major is commercial English . You know , and I am not only familiar with useful English expressions in business , but also learn some theories on this field . Besides , during my college learning period , I also attended some commercial activities to strive for the opportunity of practicing what I learned . 
 Well , I was a diligent student when I stayed in my college . I dislike meeting the deadline , when I am working on a project . I am always willing to complete it well ahead of the schedule . 
 Well , I lost my grandpa when I was only ten . I often recall the period when he fed me . 
 I will start my work at the beginning of next month . 
 I want to have a look at the microwave ovens . 
 Not really . What are these toys over there ? 
 I don't like its color . A bit too bright . Do you have a grey one ? 
 Really ? How so ? 
 Okay . 
 How about its quality ? 
 What about the price ? 
 Do you have deviled crabs ? 
 I want an order of that . By the way , I want it hot . I like chili . 
 Bring me a bottle of beer . 
 Are you looking for a small , medium , or large pan ? 
 Does this one look big enough ? 
 Well , what do you think of the aluminum pan ? 
 Here's the same pan , but it has a space-age , heat-resistant plastic handle . 
 I'm so happy that you found what you wanted . Do you want to use a credit card ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry . Here's the lid . Yes , it comes with the pan . 
 Thank you . I try to keep in shape . 
 Yes , as long as I can find the time . I like swimming best . 
 I like the back best . I am good at freestyle stroke , but I usually use breast stroke as it keeps me from getting tired . 
 I agree . I'm not good at it , either . Can you swim ? How about going for a swim this Saturday ? 
 What can I do for you ? 
 Yes , what's the problem ? 
 So you will stay until 9th ? 
 OK , we'll make the correction for you . 
 Mr . Johnson , there's something I'd like to talk over with you . Would sometime this week be convenient for you ? 
 That'll be fine . 
 Are you sure you know where this bus goes ? 
 What do you mean it should ? 
 Dude , are we on the right bus ? 
 It doesn't look like we're on our way to Altadena . 
 What does that sign say ? 
 Yup , I'm never trusting you with the bus schedules again . 
 Yeah , at least . 
 Oh , thank you . Yes , please . What I need is to handle some domestic affairs . 
 Well , I need a Deposit Certification to handle this . 
 Yes , yes . Here it is . By the way , is there a handling fee ? 
 You'll love this . It's a chick drink . 
 Well , that too . I mean that it's kind of sweet . See if you can guess what's in it . 
 Not bad . You really know your booze ... So I guess you know what's in the salsa , too ? 
 Don't tell me you're a salsa expert , too ! 
 I have a typical nine to five job . Actually , I work a little longer than nine to five most days . 
 No , I don't . I get a bonus each month , depending on the value of the contracts I sign with clients . 
 We have an hour-long lunch break from twelve to one . We can take coffee breaks during the day . My boss doesn't mind , as long as we get our work done on time . 
 There's some paperwork , but most of the time we put the information into our computers . Then we can send information to each other by email or across the network . Do you work in a cubicle ? 
 I work in a cubicle too , but I don't mind it . 
 Everything in that minibar has been consumed , sir ? 
 Is there anything special you'd like ? 
 Okay , sir . Three of each . Would you like anything else ? 
 Perrier , Jim Beam , and apples . Is that it for now ? 
 Your order will be brought to you momentarily , sir . 
 That depends . What does she look like ? 
 How tall is she ? 
 Is she chubby ? 
 It sounds like she's pretty good-looking . Does she wear glasses ? 
 How's her skin ? 
 Does she have any piercings or tattoos ? 
 What's the tattoo on her foot like ? 
 Even her mom ? 
 What's her personality like ? 
 So there is something wrong with her ! It was beginning to sound like she was too good to be true ! 
 I'm not sure if I can , but I'll try . 
 I've prepared some L / C documents , all in accordance with the conditions . There shouldn't be any problems ; I've done about a million of these things recently . 
 Thanks very much . I'm sure I'll be back , so see you again soon . Bye ! 
 Well , I've always used the Bank Book , but now I have this card . I don't know how to use it in the machine . 
 Yes , I sure can . I feel like a dinosaur with all of these youngsters and their electronics . This machine is working , then ? 
 Oh , it wants me to put in my PIN number . OK , I can do that ... 
 There are so many to choose from . I didn't know you could do all of this using a card . 
 Could you send up a Coke and a salad ? 
 Make them with French dressing . 
 Excuse me . I want to pay for these items . 
 How much is it all together ? 
 Can I pay by credit card ? 
 OK . Here you are . 
 Yes . And can you pack the things up , please ? 
 This blouse is a special offer today . You can have it at 10 % off the regular price . 
 No . 10 % is my last word . 
 May I have two full fare tickets and one half ticket ? 
 Here you are . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 What's the matter , sir ? 
 No , I haven't sir . 
 But , sir , I didn't drink at all . 
 OK . I'll blow . 
 But I ... 
 Tomorrow is my day off . I wonder if it's convenient to change our appointment from tomorrow to next Wednesday , still at the same time . 
 It's a shame.Will this afternoon be all right ? But I can only spare you an hour and a half today , from four o'clock . 
 Can I help you ? 
 What kind ? 
 Sorry , madam . We have stopped selling those kinds of eggs for a week . 
 You know , red yolk is proved unnatural . It's artificial , and may lead to cancer . 
 Yes , so they are no longer being sold . 
 Madam , what can I do for you ? 
 I get it . And ... ? 
 How about adding some pictures of our products for the introduction ? 
 OK , I will prepare it right now . 
 Please trust me . I will finish it very well . 
 Well , we could probably get started with a strategy meeting tomorrow morning at 8: 00 . 
 That's fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ? 
 What for ? Oh , I see , you mean next year our company will expand business to the South Korea market . 
 Well , sounds promising . But I think our company will provide us with the language training courses if it is necessary . We need not bother signing for the language by ourselves . 
 If we are to modernize our information processing , manufacturing system and management code , we need to complete our office automation . 
 Our copying machines are too slow , our telephone system is limited in function , and our offices are not well-equipped for us to work efficiently . To improve the offices for higher efficiency , we have to change all the chairs and some of the desks also , redesign our office so that we may have more space . 
 Can I help you ? 
 This is the new style.Two hundred and twenty-eight . 
 Of course , please . 
 Two hundred and ten yuan . It is the lowest price . 
 Well , two hundred yuan . 
 OK , I'll wrap it for you . 
 Yes . There are several data documents about this contract . Please advise me which one I should give up . 
 I see . Thanks for your instruction . 
 Daddy , do you mind helping me prepare the supplies for mountain climbing . 
 Is it gonna to rain tomorrow ? 
 Just take my umbrella in case of rain . 
 Definitely , or else , I will starve to death halfway up the mountain . 
 Daddy , may I take your compass ? I feel so cool with it in my hand . 
 It doesn't matter . I can go with you to the supermarket to pick up a new pair . 
 May I help you ? 
 Yes , madam . There's one in the seat pocket . Here you are . 
 Should I bring you some water ? 
 I want to buy some jewellery . 
 I should like to look at some bracelets . 
 Jade ones . 
 What's the price for this one ? 
 How about seven hundred yuan ? 
 OK . I'll take it . 
 It was nice talking to you too . 
 That would be fun . 
 I think we should go out to eat . 
 All right , so I'll see you then . 
 Okay , I'll talk to you later then . 
 Bye . 
 Yes , I'd like to change Australian dollars for RIB . 
 I am not sure . What's the rate today ? 
 What was the rate yesterday ? 
 Oh , the rate goes down . 
 Let me think ... Will the rate still go down tomorrow ? 
 Well , I want to change 1000 Australian dollars for RIB . 
 OK . 
 Thank you very much . 
 But then it'll be too warm . 
 Well , here is your breakfast ! 
 Sorry , your friend over there ordered fried eggs , and I gave you his by mistake . 
 Here are your pancakes , madam . 
 Oh , I am so sorry ! 
 Good , sir . I will take care of that right away . 
 This is a nice place , but you need to get some furniture . 
 Do you have a bed ? 
 Can I take a shower ? 
 Really ? 
 Well , do you want to go get some dinner ? 
 The total for all these items comes to $ 36.78 . 
 There is something wrong with your card . 
 Your card was declined . 
 Would you like me to try another card ? 
 What about cash ? 
 I ’ m sorry , but you can ’ t take the items until you can buy them . 
 For me , now an important question to buy an Accord is the time when I can get this car . I need a new car rather soon . 
 That's good enough , I think . What colors does the new Accord come in ? 
 My brother has last year's Accord . And his car is a kind of soft purple color mixed with silver . I really like that color . I wonder if I can get that color on my Accord . 
 Yes , I think that's it . Can I get that on the Accord ? 
 Well , I think I want to order the new Accord then . It looks like an excellent car . 
 Yes , I know . I think Honda is the most reliable car on the road . I would never change to anything else . The Honda I have now almost never has service problems . It runs smooth as silk . 
 So , where can I start my work ? 
 And I represent ? 
 Ok , thank you . 
 Congratulations , Francis . Your hard working finally pays off . I am so happy for your promotion . 
 I hope I could get promoted some day . Tell me about your experience , ok ? 
 How do you think if I volunteer for some work ? 
 How many places have you worked altogether ? 
 Would you tell me the general description of your present job ? 
 What time do you go to work ? 
 What time does the office close ? 
 Does your work involve a lot of paper filling and typing ? 
 What made you decide to change your job ? 
 What's today's date ? 
 When are you going on vacation ? 
 Really ? The day after tomorrow ? That's very soon . 
 How long are you going to stay there ? 
 When are you coming back ? 
 Alright . Have a nice trip . 
 Ten more minutes , mom . Please ! 
 I bet she will hang around with her mates after school . 
 Excuse me , can you show me the cloisonn bracelet in the counter ? 
 Can you also show me this one ? 
 I think the cloisonn bracelet is more beautiful . 
 Will the luster fade out after some time ? 
 Ok . Can I try it on ? 
 Hello , Madam . What can I do for you today ? 
 It's very quick and easy . It just takes 24 hours , we guarantee that . All you need to do is fill in this slip and we can proceed . 
 There is a service commission that you must pay . It's 1 % of the funds to be remitted , so you should pay an extra 6 RIB . 
 It's Cindy , you know that . Hey , Cindy , say hello to Maria . 
 She is also very naughty . By the way , do you have a dog , Maria ? 
 Oh , a cat ? Come on . 
 But I think they're dull , aren't they ? 
 Well , cats are certainly more independent . 
 oh , really ? so you just took home a stray cat ? 
 Poor cat . 
 Hello . City News . Can I help you ? 
 Okay . What ’ s your account number ? 
 And your address , please ? 
 When do you want it cancelled ? 
 Okay .

 I want to immigrate to the States because my daughter works and lives there . 
 About nine years 
 She is a teacher in a highschool , She teaches Chinese . 
 All right . 
 I'm fine , dad . 
 No , dad . Can I go there to play ball ? 
 Can you tell me how to reach the bank please ? 
 I have an AIR pass card and I want to withdraw money from the bank . 
 How do I get there . I have no knowledge of this area . 
 It sounds very complicated . How far is it from here ? 
 Oh , I would really appreciate that . By the way will I be going North or South ? 
 So how did I do ? 
 I lost ? 
 So the price was good ? 
 So I didn't miss by much then . 
 I knew the delivery was slow but I figured the price would win it for me . 
 I'd have a look at some pots and pans . 
 What kind is most durable , please ? 
 I'll have the stainless ones . They look very solid . 
 Is supper ready ? I'm hungry . 
 Ok . What are we having ? 
 I'll have my beef well-done , please . By the way , don't we have soup tonight ? 
 Let me see . Well , I'd like onion soup . Thank you . 
 You remember me ! Yes , I'm with Li Wang Enterprises ; I'm the Accountant Peters .

 I think so too . How much is it ? 
 Well , that's too expensive . I can't afford that . 
 Sure . What ’ s up ? 
 Are you going fishing ? 
 Well , don't worry . I ’ ll take care of the business for you . Have fun ! 
 Yes , may I have some water , please ? 
 May I get an order of barbeque wings ? 
 No , thank you , that'll be all for now . 
 I'm ready .

 Yes , that's it . 
 Yes , I think so . I ’ d like to have one medium steak , and a bottle of wine . 
 Ok . 
 What can I do for you , sir ?

 I see . Should I have it bound ? 
 That is all right . 
 Oh , yes.Thank you . I'd be glad to . 
 I'm sure the output of your production will increase a lot . 
 Oh , thank you .

 Good morning . Are you ready to order ? 
 Would you like anything to drink ? 
 Anything else ? 
 Sure . Coming right up . 
 That's true . I got the news yesterday . 
 You're flattering me . 
 Not bad . I'm confident . And I like challenges . 
 Thank you . 
 OK , I'll get it . It's for you , Jeff . 
 Do you know where I can find old music boxes ? 
 What's that ? I've never heard of such a thing . 
 OK , Where can I find one ? 
 Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 Yes , sir . Do you need some flowers ? 
 Certainly , sir . What kind of flowers would you like ? 
 You need fruit and lilies . Am I right ? 
 I think it's quite enough . I'II have them bought for you as soon as possible . 
 How long do you plan to stay here ? 
 How so ? 
 What are your future plans and what kind of expectations do you have of the company ? 
 Is Bob home ? 
 I need to get a taxi . 
 No , that won't be necessary . I just need a taxi . 
 Just a taxi , please . 
 I'm going to Rockefeller Center . 
 I want to leave as soon as possible . 
 Thank you , I'm coming down now . 
 Your house is very old . Does it need redecorating ? 
 Shall I help you with it ? 
 I have much time . I suppose it can be done . 
 What's your weight . 
 Do put yourself on a diet , otherwise you'll be too fat . 
 I heard you've found a new job . 
 So you're quite happy with your new job ? 
 How can I help you ? 
 What ’ s your destination ? 
 Ok . When is your train supposed to leave ? 
 OH , dear . What ’ s your last name , please ? 
 And your passport number ? 
 Let me see ... it doesn ’ t look like we have any information about your ticket here . 
 Oh dear . I ’ m really sorry , sir . But you don ’ t have any proof of purchase . You ’ ll simply have to purchase another ticket . 
 It depends on how you want to travel . If you want a soft sleeper , it will cost 610 RIB , if you want a hard seat , it will only cost 100RMB . 
 looks like you might like the soft sleeper then . 
 ... sir ? 
 Perhaps it ’ s in your other pocket . 
 You ’ re just 4 mao short for the hard sleeper , but I ’ ll let it go . Anything for love ! 
 Hello , Room Reservation Service . May I help you ? 
 Let me see . Yeah , There are two such rooms left . May I have your name please ? 
 OK . I've got it . 
 Good-bye . 
 I've got a sore throat and my chest hurts . 
 Yes , I ache all over . 
 A little bit . 
 It's gone completely . 
 Is that all doctor ? 
 Thank you , doctor . Goodbye . 
 Hey man , you hit my car . 
 It doesn't matter , because you damaged my car . 
 Look what you did to my rear bumper . 
 My bumper is smashed in . 
 Your front bumper is just as damaged . 
 Here . I'd better get a call from you . 
 Could I have a refund on this ? 
 Then can I exchange it for something else with the same price ? 
 OK . I will . 
 What are you planning on making ? 
 The only way you're eating tonight is if you cook . 
 I don't know . What do you want to eat ? 
 That sounds delicious . 
 I already told you that I'm not cooking tonight . 
 I already know . Start cooking . 
 Yes . I want to rent a formal suit for an interview . Can you give me some advice ? 
 May I try this on ? 
 Have you got anything to declare , madam ? 
 Have you got any wine or spirits ? 
 What about cigarettes or cigars ? 
 How many , madam ? 
 Excuse me.May I see the manager of your store ? 
 Oh , great , I saw a job ad outside your store . I am interested in the job advertised . I am coming to see if there is any opportunity available for me . 
 I can do the work of shop assistant and I worked part time in a small department store during my summer vocation last year . 
 At present , both are OK for me.What do you need most , then ? 
 I think I can . I have been learning English for almost 5 years and especially I am fluent at speaking English.Also , I have made some foreigners friends during the experience of learning English . 
 It quite suits me . I am free in the evening these days , I will have no difficulty starting at five pm . 
 It seems reasonable.By the way , I can get my earning raised with a excellent performance , can't I ? 
 I see . I will try my best to do the job well . 
 How about next monday ? 
 Thank you for your kindness , ma'am . See you next Monday . 
 There are various kinds of tea in China . It depends on the taste and effect . 
 This is green tea , you can drink it in summer . It can relieve summer-heat and it is good for maintaining your lungs . 
 It is black tea , it has a strong taste and promotes digestion . 
 It is jasmine tea of high quality . It is fragrant and has a pleasant taste . 
 No problem . Wait for a moment . 
 He is in his office , but you'd better choose your words carefully while talking to him . 
 Nothing . But he is in a bad mood today . 
 That's all right . 
 Here you are . Have a nice stay here . 
 We will find you one . Wait a moment . 
 So , now we have covered all the important points . 
 Before we draft the contract , let's examine the details . 
 Perfect . But what I ’ m concerned about most is the time of delivery 。 
 Yes ? 
 No problem . I ’ ll have the covering LC opened as soon as I wetback . In addition , would you tell me by whom the commodity inspection is conducted before shipment ? 
 Please remember to use both English and Chinese versions and both versions should be equally valid . 
 Then I ’ ll come along three days later to put my signature on it . 
 I want to buy some running shoes . Maybe New Balance . 
 But I exercise at the club . And I use the stepping machine.So I need good running shoes . 
 What's the difference ? 
 And what are running-shoe-style shoes ? 
 But they aren't as light , right ? 
 That's what I want.For exercising at the club . I can even spend 100 dollars on them . I don't care . 
 My sister has New Balance running shoes . I want shoes just like hers . I don't care if they're expensive . And they look cool too . 
 I want the best.My sister said good shoes are very important . For support . They support your feet . 
 No , but she exercises more than me . 
 Here it is . This is what my sister has . 
 I wonder if they have my size . 
 Here in America , it's six . 
 It's none of your business . Let me try them on . 
 Well , I am not sure . Lets me check my agenda 
 I am free on Tuesday afternoon from 2 PM to 4 PM , is it convenient for you ? 
 Yes , there is . See you then . 
 Thank you . 
 Certainly . ( He brings her the sauce . ) Here you are . Can I get you anything else ? 
 Good afternoon , is there anything I can do for you ? 
 That will make your eyes seem bigger . 
 Sure . It's the latest . 
 I'd like to pay some money in using my card , please . 
 Here it is . I usually use the machine , but there seems to be such a long queue at the moment . 
 I'll look forward to that , I can't stand queuing . 
 1,000 RIB , it should all be there . 
 OK , done . When will it show in my account ? Not for withdrawal , I mean just registered . 
 That's fine . OK . Thanks . 
 What's wrong with it ? 
 Oh ... 
 Sorry , love . 
 My cigarettes . 
 In the dustbin ! Why didn't you tell me before ? 
 But yesterday you said you would rent it . 
 Why is that ? 
 Maybe you ’ re right . 
 Say it . 
 That's right . And in my opinion , to push the sale of the new products is not an easy task . 
 Could you put it in detail ? 
 I think the idea is very good . In the promotion campaign , two or more media are used together , so as to draw customers ' attention and keep hold their attention to larger extent . 
 I think TV is also an effective media , as long as our company is willing to spend more money on it . 
 I also think good advertising is essential to call attention to a product and introduce our L-series products . Meanwhile , ads are also the representation of the company's image . 
 You are not going to believe this . Do you remember the dress we saw at Mayors that was so beautiful and expensive ? I got it today at half price . 
 How can you stay so calm ? Aren't you going to take a look to see if there is anything for you ? 
 But there won't be anything good left . 
 Thank you , Mary . We have been looking forward to trying out this restaurant . 
 Sure , that sounds great . Where are your appetizers listed ? 
 The chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good . Is that pretty good ? 
 OK , I'll take one order of that . 
 Perfect ! Please add on an order of onion rings . 
 Oh , how annoying ! 
 What a nuisance ! 
 I saw a lot of teenagers when Alan and I were there yesterday . 
 Speaking of that trip , Alan bought a shirt at a department store , but the sleeves are too long . Do you know a seamstress or tailor who can shorten them ? 
 Isn't that complicated ? 
 We ? Do you want to go with me ? 
 What do you do there ... hang around , like the kids ? 
 Yes , I'm looking for a new winter coat . 
 I don't know really.What ' s the fashional color this year ? 
 Good.Red suits me very well.It ' s a cheerful color , isn't it ? 
 Well , I used to be size fourteen , but I've put on a bit of weight recently , so may be sixteen . 
 I quite like this one.How much is it ? 
 Oh , that's too expensive.Aren ' t there any cheaper ones ? 
 Yes , I see . I'll take it.Here ' s $ 200 . 
 Thank you . 
 I can't , I have to go to the gym . 
 Actually I will ! I am working out with a personal trainer that gets on my case if I don't go . I like it , because it makes me feel more obligated to go and get healthy . 
 Yeah . He makes a work put plan depending on the areas I want to work on , or the muscles I want to build . Like for example in order to get better muscle tone in my abs , pecs and biceps , he makes me work out with free weights . Then for my quads , calves and hamstrings , I do leg lifts or squats . 
 Excuse me , how do I get to Wall Street ? 
 I ’ m sorry , but how do I know the subway train is going south ? 
 O . K . , so it ’ s this one ? 
 Oh , sorry . 
 I am afraid I have some bad news for you . It's about our order contract O5TSWAL . 
 The goods arrived half a month later than scheduled . What's more , five cases were found broken and unit inside seriously damaged . 
 But then there were some cracks in a number of cases . Almost all the bottom of the cases were loose . 
 But our surveyors found the damage was caused by poor packing . 
 But you filled the cartons too full and the straps are not strong enough . When they were rehandled , some of them were broken . 
 Here is your ticket . Let's get in the museum . 
 I can't agree more . I think we'd better hire a guide so that we can learn more . 
 What's wrong with you , young man ? 
 I see . You've got a cold . 
 Take this medicine three times a day . 
 Drink a lot of water and have a good rest . You'll be well soon . 
 Well , we didn't ask for this room service maybe someone else ask it , I ’ m sure . 
 Yes , please . 
 We paid for the room service already in our room . 
 No , we got no receipt , and we pay it on the spot ! 
 I ’ m a firefighter . 
 I ’ m really lucky to do something I really love . 
 I work downtown at station 24.It can get a little crazy sometimes but that ’ s what makes it challenging . 
 Here it is . 
 For one week . 
 For sightseeing . 
 At the Hilton hotel . 
 No , nothing . 
 Why ? What's the problem ? 
 Okay , I'll get Bob to cover you . 
 It ’ s my job . What can I help you with ? 
 In what room is this pipe ? 
 When did the pipe start leaking ? 
 I will need to tear down that wall to fix that pipe . 
 You ’ re fine with that ? 
 Okay . I will begin working on it now , if you ’ d like . 
 Go ahead , please . 
 You ’ ll have 10 days paid vacation every year . 
 We will provide you wit life insurance , health insurance , accident insurance , housing benefits , heating allowance and transportation allowance . 
 You ’ ll be paid a bonus at the end of every year . 
 We provide our employees with training opportunities at home and abroad . 
 Sure . I will ask Lucy to call you in two days . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 It's in aisle A . 
 I don't know . Check the flyer or check with the produce person . 
 Where is your wine list ? 
 Do you have any mixed drinks available here ? 
 I heard that you are famous for your drinks . What are your specials ? 
 I would love a margarita right now ! That is what I am going to order . 
 I prefer my margarita on the rocks , please . 
 No salt , please . 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry . I forgot about those completely . I ’ ll bring them by your office . 
 You bet . I ’ ll swing by after lunch , okay ? 
 I think so , ‘ cause I remember the policeman told me this is the very way . 
 Just head straight up the street about two blocks and then turn left . 
 Can I help you , madam ? 
 Are you all our guests ? 
 Please fill in this form . 
 So you're leaving this evening , we ’ ll keep your bags until 6pm , here is you tag . 
 Look ! It is not working well . Did you try out the bike when you bought it . 
 But it would save a lot of trouble if you had taken it for a test ride . 
 Hi , Helen . Where are you going on this summer vacation ? 
 That sounds like fun ! 
 This first one , I have a question ... This graph is marking the sales performance for our line of hair products , right ? Can this line be right ? It looks like our sales plummeted . I can't believe we did that poorly ... If I remember correctly , sales went down slightly , but not as dramatically as the graph shows . 
 Well , the good news is the new industrial cleaning products really took off . Look how the sales have shot up over the last two weeks . 
 At lease they stayed the same . That's better than dropping . 
 I may get some fruit . 
 I tend to only eat grapes and apples . 
 I've always liked green apples . 
 Why do you say that ? 
 You'd rather eat a red apple ? 
 They're okay , I guess . 
 No , Mum , I'd rather stay inside . 
 I prefer staying at home and watching TV . 
 Yes , but a football game is next . 
 I just enjoy watching games . 
 While you are thinking about what you might like to order for dinner , would you like to order your drinks ? 
 The wine list is posted right there on the board . 
 Yes , we have a wide selection of mixed drinks available from our bar . 
 Our most popular drinks are our Cuervo Gold margaritas . 
 Can I bring that to you on the rocks , or would you like it blended ? 
 Salt or no salt ? 
 What ’ s the matter , dear ? 
 Oh , dear . Did you lose a lot of money ? 
 You must tell your embassy about it . And I think they ’ ll issue you with a new one . 
 Sure . Here you go . 
 Okay , Bob , What is it ? 
 All right . 
 Yes , here you are . 
 Well , it's straight , but it's upside down I'm afraid . 
 Come over and chew the fat . We can enjoy to our hearts'content . 
 Do you have an appointment , Mr . Liu ? 
 Mr . Thomas is quite busy , I ’ m afraid he won ’ t be able to see you today . 
 Have a seat please while I call . 
 I ’ m sorry , Ms . Fairbanks . I won ’ t let it happen again . 
 I understand , Ms . Fairbanks . 
 Well , it depends on what you have . 
 It takes only one day and you could experience almost all the famous spots in the city , I don't think you would like to miss it . 
 50 dollars per person . 
 Of course . Please take it easy . 
 Why not ? 
 Yes . I urgently need a room for tomorrow night , and do you have any vacancies ? 
 I'd like a suite with an ocean view , please . 
 What is the price of the suite ? 
 It is a little high . I'm told that your hotel is offering discount now . 
 Oh , I see . Then do you have anything less expensive ? 
 OK , I will take it . By the way , does the price include breakfast ? 
 My name is David White . 
 That is D-A-V-I-D , W-H-I-T-E . 
 About three days . 
 Thank you . See you . 
 I want to work in the banking industry . I ’ Ve always been interesting in working for an international invest bank . I ’ d like to help people invest their money . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve sent letters to several banks . A few have invited me for interviews after we take our examinations . 
 Which field would you like to work in ? have you decide yet ? 
 Perhaps you should apply to banks as well . They need people to market their service . As you said , the banking industry pays well . 
 I need to talk to you about something . 
 I have some questions about my lease . 
 Exactly how long is my lease for ? 
 What will happen if I move out before then ? 
 I don ’ t understand . 
 Okay , I think that I understand . 
 Is everything to your satisfaction ? 
 Oh ! Sorry to hear that . This is quite unusual as we have steak from the market every day . 
 I'm sorry , sir . Do you wish to try something else ? That would be on the house , of course . 
 I ’ m glad you could find time to meet with me , Mr . Johnson . I can ’ t think of a nicer environment for our meeting today , the ambiance here is lovely ! 
 Well , as you know , I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States . They ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . Naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining . 
 Actually , the factory is located in Scotland . 
 That ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . They ’ Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one ! 
 Unique , aren ’ t they ? I bet you ’ Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection . 
 I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations . I ’ m sure you can keep a secret.Buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and Haggis . 
 It ’ s a traditional Scottish delicacy ; you take sheep ’ s liver , heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep ’ s stomach . 
 Which man ? 
 Oh , he's the coach of the football team . 
 Hi . I would like to get an internet plan for my house . 
 I have no idea what kbps means . I just want to be able to get online , play games and chat with my friends . Oh , and watch movies online as well . 
 Do I have to pay an installation fee ? 
 Awesome ! 
 Certainly . I'll do it for you right away . Sorry the drugs on this order are out of stock . 
 Would you prefer to take similar medicine of other brands ? 
 Certainly . I recommend this medicine . It's the same medicine , same quality , at a much lower cost . And it helps just as much . In fact , you'll feel better just by saving the money , I promise . 
 This is for internal use . Two tablets , four times a day . 
 You're welcome . 
 Of course , pick up the receiver , hit a button and listen for a tone . Are you hearing it ? 
 Well , after you dial 9 on the keypad , you should hear the tone change . 
 When you dial 9 and hear the tone change it means you have an outside line . Who are you trying to call ? 
 For an outside call you now just dial the number . For a company number you need to know the extension . Do you have a list of extensions ? 
 You can always look an extension up on the company website . 
 What's that ? I thought our negotiation went very well . 
 $ 1500 is almost the lowest price we can offer . 
 You get what you pay for , considering the high quality , our price is very reasonable . 
 Sorry , I can't give you an immediate answer for this problem , let me talk to our general manager first . 
 Excuse me . I seem to have lost my son . 
 Shirley . 
 Daniel . 
 He is in a blue sportswear and a white sportsshoes . About 1.4 meters . 
 Hello ! I need to make a copy of something at once . 
 Fantastic ! Is there a charge ? 
 Well , I'm only making one copy , so I guess I can afford it . 
 I want to get a bite to eat . 
 I have no idea what I want . 
 I wouldn't mind getting some Chinese food . 
 I'm not sure . 
 Do they do a good job on the food ? 
 I think I will get my food from Panda Express , too . 
 yes , I experienced one when I was in Tokyo once . The tremors only lasted a few seconds though and then it was over . 
 I don't remember , but it wasn't very serious . Have you ever been in an earthquake ? 
 where are you from ? 
 did your house ever get damaged from the winds ? 
 wow , that must have really been scary . 
 have you ever experiences a flood ? 
 that sure didn't last long ! 
 I'm a great driver . 
 Have you gotten your learner's permit ? 
 Have you ever been behind the wheel ? 
 You do know all the controls in the car , don't you ? 
 Tell me when you want me to teach you . 
 I'm not busy tomorrow . Call me then . 
 You finished everything in there , sir ? 
 What would you like to order ? 
 Uh-huh . What else do you want ? 
 No problem . Is there anything else I can get for you ? 
 I'll get all of that for you right away . Someone should be up shortly 
 Could you tell me the advantages of it ? 
 There is something in what you said , but what is the rent ? 
 In my opinion , the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas . 
 Your intention is good , but I still can't agree with you . If no one would like to share it with you , you have to pay it all by yourself . 
 I agree with you in this way . But how often do you go to work or shopping per week ? 
 In my opinion , you have to go to the university every day , and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university . 
 Can I see the doctor ? 
 No , I don't . 
 Well , I am spending my vacation here and I have a stomachache and ... 
 I ’ d prefer to see him asap . If I have to wait for another 30 mins , I think I will faint from this unbearable pain in my stomach and ... 
 No , not for this country . 
 No , I didn't think I ’ d need it . 
 Cash , credit card , cheque anything . I just have to see a doctor . I am in pain . 
 I know . I am sorry that I yelled at you . 
 Is Diana in ? 
 Yes , please ask her to call John Smith . 
 Can you type , Jane ? 
 How many words a minute ? 
 En ... and can you speak any foreign languages ? 
 Really ? that ’ s very good . What about French ? 
 ... Can you start next week ? 
 Yes , on Monday . 
 Yes , that ’ s right , you have the job now . 
 Yes.May I help you ? 
 We're very sorry to cause you a lot of inconvenience . 
 We're rather busy right now.It will take another 15 minutes . 
 I'm afraid it would take 15 minutes at most . 
 I ’ Ve decided to grow my own garden ! 
 On the contrary , I have been reading a lot of books about the subject . 
 Well , first I need to buy some things , such as fertilizer , seeds and tools . 
 You know , the basics . A rake , shovel , spade and a hoe . 
 I ’ ll till the soil and then sow the seeds . I ’ ll then add some fertilizer and voila ! Gardening all done ! 
 Hi , my name is Ted , what's yours ? 
 I said , I'm Ted , who are you ? 
 Do you come here often , Laura ? 
 Let's go outside and talk . So Laura , do you come here often ? 
 I asked if you come here often . 
 No , this is my first time here . 
 Yeah , that's why I'm here . My friends dragged me here , because they think I spend too much time studying . 
 I guess so . But the music is too loud . I don't mind getting out and meeting people , but next time I'll do it in a park . 
 Who's calling ? 
 No , I haven ’ t , but I thought about joining the green party . 
 Yes . I was . But I didn ’ t have enough time to devote to it . 
 You ’ re right . But smaller political and pressure groups can often influence large political parties . Any member of parliament can propose legislation and parties and pressure groups can raise awareness 
 That ’ s true . But it ’ s a little strange because the media often reports on political events . You can read about them in newspaper or hear them on tv . 
 Yes ? 
 Pardon ? 
 Yes , it is . Thank you very much . 
 I see . It's on top of the hills . 
 I know . It's a major symbol of China . 
 Do we have any choices ? 
 Ah ... let's just climb . It's more fun , I think . 
 Well , that was tough . 
 This looks great . When was it built ? 
 That's remarkable . 
 Would you like to go sightseeing tomorrow ? 
 What would you like to see in Beijing ? 
 I'll pick you up here tomorrow . 
 Really ? How much is it ? Oh , it's 42 yuan ! How expensive ! 
 How come ? I have never seen such a popular book before . 
 You are right . Let's buy the cheaper one . 
 Hello , could I speak to the export manager , please ? 
 This is Joey from Mary trading company . I learned that you are the leading export of cloth by Hummed company . 
 We are interested in cloth made in China . The clothes are sold very well here . We are a big location supplier for the northeast market here . I'm thinking that we'll have some business opportunities . 
 Yes , I'd like to see that . What does it clean exactly ? 
 What does the unit consist of ? 
 I hear you jog everyday . 
 I think maybe one day you can take part in the walking race . 
 Hey , John ! I haven ’ t seen you in ages ! What ’ s new ? What have you been up to ? 
 Trading ? You , big guy ? What are you trading ? 
 Currencies ? As in Euros , Dollars , Pounds and Rupees ? 
 I don ’ t understand . You ’ re buying and selling money ? 
 Last night ? 
 You ’ re kidding ! I ’ m on ! Where do I sign up ? 
 I can help you . What location are you looking for ? 
 Have you thought about what your needs are in terms of size ? 
 Is living in a particular school district important to you ? 
 Are you interested in purchasing on the lake , or would you like a home with a view ? 
 Now that I have an idea of what you want , I can begin my search . 
 I want to see you play . Be quick ! 
 Mike , shall we book two tickets online ? 
 Yeah . How many tickets remain ? 
 Brilliant idea ! That will make our journey rewarding and much safer . 
 Hello ? Can you help me ? My computer ! Oh man ... 
 I turned on my laptop and it broke ! I mean , the monitor went black ! 
 I don ’ t feel sick , ... let me check ... Nope ! No fever , I ’ m fine . 
 Phew ! . . . Wait a minute , CRASH ? ? ! ! Spyware ? Trojans ! What ? where ? when ? ! 
 It's about time . 
 Okay , let me take a look . 
 Sounds pretty good . I see the equalizer has a good selection of settings . 
 Hmm . This system seems to have everything I'm looking for . It's a bit pricey , though . I'll have to think about it . Thanks for your help . 
 Why do you think you are qualified for this position ? 
 Great . Then what's your technical post title now ? 
 Do you take the original certificate with you ? 
 Can you briefly tell me about one of your designs ? 
 Welcome to our hotel's indoor swimming pool . What can I do for you ? 
 You don't need to worry about that . madam . We have a warm massage pool , and the temperature is 36 ° C . 
 Certainly , madam . The deepest place is two meters but you can swim in the shallow area , which is only l . 4 meter in depth . We have separate locker rooms over there and they are free of charge . 
 Hello ! Can I help you ? 
 What kind of flowers do you want ? 
 How about rose ? It's the most suitable one for lovers . 
 Well , what about violet ? It means the eternal beauty . 
 Excuse me . Have you got the time ? 
 Does your watch keep good time ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Hi . What ’ s up ? 
 Okay , I ’ ll ask my plumber to come by and fix it today . What else ? 
 What ’ s the matter with it ? 
 I ’ ll get an electrician to repair it as soon as possible . Is that everything ? 
 I ’ m sorry . There ’ s nothing I can do about that . You ’ Ve got to call the phone company . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Happy to see you-too-Mike.How ' s your family ? 
 Good evening , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 OK , please fill in the form first . 
 We will send it to your room at 4:00 pm tomorrow . 
 We have express service as well . It charges 30 % more but I assure your coat will be ready tomorrow morning . 
 I have a little trouble , and I don't know how to deal with it . 
 Tom wants me to write a recommendation letter for him , but I don't know how to write it . 
 Really ? Tell me without delay . 
 Well , I see . 
 It's easy to write those . 
 Tom got along well with classmates . He is really a good boy . 
 What should I write except these ? 
 OK , I will remember . 
 Yes , thank you . I just want to have a smoke . Can I smoke in the aisle ? 
 OK . That's fine . 
 I feel itchy ! I can ’ t stand it anymore ! I think I may be coming down with something . I feel lightheaded and weak . 
 What ’ s wrong ? 
 Maybe it ’ s just a rash or an allergy ! We can ’ t be sure until I see a doctor . 
 Are you serious ? You always blow things out of proportion . In any case , I think I ’ ll go take an oatmeal bath . 
 I'll see if she is in . 
 I'm afraid she's out . 
 Yes , of course . 
 Sure . 
 It's my pleasure . 
 I am . Are you ? 
 Is that right ? 
 Voting isn ’ t difficult . 
 They tell you everything on the ballot . 
 You ’ ll be okay . 
 You should be excited about your first vote . 
 The keys will be turned in on Tuesday night . The house will be yours at that time . 
 You can tell the utility company what day you are moving in , and they will transfer the utilities to your name . 
 Take advantage of the house being empty to clean and paint . It will be harder to do after the furniture and appliances have arrived . 
 That will be good . You are going to want your stove and refrigerator right away . 
 I think I am getting a fever and will be too sick to help you . Here , feel how hot my head is ! 
 OK , but do you want to talk to your wife if she calls ? 
 All right . 
 Yes , please . I'd like to buy a gift for my younger brother . He's going to take a trip to South America . 
 By air . So my gift should be quite light . What can you suggest ? 
 My sister already gave him one . I like something unusual . 
 Oh , a nice handkerchief . That's a great idea . I'll take it . 
 Let me see . Your plane leaves from Gate 12 . You should go to Gate 12 to board your plane 
 Take the escalator over there and turn left , you'll see the sign . 
 Do you like cooking ? 
 I don ’ t like it . It takes up too much time and I really hate having to clean up after the meal . I can ’ t stand doing the washing up , drying up , and putting all the dishes and cutlery away . 
 So , what kind of dishes do you usually make ? I know you like Italian food . 
 Do you find it hard to get ingredients for Chinese food ? 
 How long does it take you to cook a meal for five or six people ? 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 All right . How much do you need ? 
 One thousand U . S . Mm hmm . And are you going to pay cash ? 
 All right . Now can I have your passbook ? 
 Thank you . And what amounts do you want the checks in ? 
 Do you take in students ? I've been told you might have a vacant room . 
 How much are you asking ? 
 Could I have a look at it , please ? 
 Good morning , miss . 
 Could you tell me please where can I find a currents exchange ? 
 I'd like to exchange 5000 Singapore dollars into the US dollars please . 
 Yes , here is my account number . 
 Sure , here is my passport , by the way what is the rate today ? 
 Yes , it is the credit demand.Where can I cash travellers ' cheques ? 
 900 dollars . 
 I need 8 hundreds and the rest in 10s please ? 
 Thank you , have a nice day . 
 Watsup , ladies ! Y'll looking ’ fine tonight . May I have this dance ? 
 It's all good . I'll show you all the right moves . My name's Malik . 
 How you feeling ’ , vista ? Mind if I take your friend ' round the dance floor ? 
 Right . Cool ! Let's go ! 
 You should send him to the boarding school . He need a strict teacher . 
 Hello , madam . Would you like to take a look at our products ? They are high-tech items . 
 Sure . Do you have a minute ? Why don't you have a seat and let me show you how to operate this item ? 
 You see , if you press this red button , the helmet becomes an umbrella . 
 It only costs you 20 dollars for one . 
 Hi , Mark ! Hi , do you have a minute ? 
 Sure , no problem . Can we fix a time to talk later ? 
 Ok , see you 10 o'clock next Monday ! 
 What's for dinner tonight ? 
 I'm not making anything . 
 What am I supposed to cook ? 
 I want some chicken and potatoes . 
 When are you going to make it ? 
 Fine , I'll make it . 
 Cindy , can you show me how to call Connecticut ? 
 A good friend of mine is there on a homestay program , too . 
 Is it expensive to make out-of-state calls ? 
 What do I do here ? 
 That's it ? 
 I'd like to reserve a table for three this evening . 
 Do you have pot service at noon ? 
 OK , we'll come at half past eleven tomorrow . 
 Black . 
 This is how you turn on the computer . 
 Which university did you graduate from ? 
 What was your major at university ? 
 What course did you like best ? 
 What do you think is the relationship between the subjects you've taken and the job you are seeking ? 
 I am an eloquent speaker in the classroom . But when I face a stranger outside , I get tongue-tied and nothing comes out . 
 I will go out of my way to catch the attention of the interviewer . 
 I ’ m very shy . I think I might shake in my boots at the moment I meet the interviewer . 
 Another problem is that I dare not look into their eyes whenever I meet strangers , especially foreigners . 
 Is there anything else that I should pay attention to in an interview ? 
 I ’ ll remember to bring gum with me . 
 I remember now . Your advice is very helpful . 
 I would like to speak to Mr . Miles . 
 Yes . Can you tell him Bob White called ? 
 He knows who I am . 
 I can be reached at 544-879-9087 until 5 p . m . today . 
 Thank you . 
 Oh , my God . It ’ s beautiful . But it looks expensive . 
 I want to have a car like that . But I am not rich . And I don ’ t have a rich daddy . 
 Good afternoon . I suppose you are Ms . Monica . My name is Mr . Thomas , the general manager of ABC Company . Here is my business card . 
 I am very impressed by your resume . Therefore , I am very interested to know why you ’ re willing to leave your current company . 
 Ok , I understand . But why you choose us to work for ? 
 How do you work with a team ? 
 What ’ s your long term goal ? 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 What about this one ? It sells like hot cakes . 
 Yes , I will get you one . 
 It looks delicious . Can you tell me how to enjoy it ? It's my first time to eat it . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Yes , they all stop at this corner . 
 You can take any bus except the Number 9 . 
 They run about every five minutes . 
 About fifteen minutes . It's not far . Are you a stranger in New York ? 
 How do you like New York city ? 
 You'll soon get accustomed to it . It's not difficult . Well , here's the bus . Fortunately , it's not full . 
 Don't mention it . 
 Well , frankly speaking , I am running a little behind . It's 40 % done . 
 I have little chance to communicate with colleagues when I have problems . They are always too busy to help a green hand like me . 
 I did . But I am so depressed because there is nobody that will help me . 
 I see your point , but I seem to be on bad terms with them . 
 Thank you so much . 
 That's a good idea . I can learn many useful things from books . 
 Well , I will do it better . 
 Thanks very much . I promise I will work harder . 
 Would you like some coffee or tea ? 
 How would you like your coffee ? 
 Coffee will be right with you . 
 Good afternoon . I need some stamps and envelopes . 
 A dozen 30 - cent stamps and 6 envelopes . 
 That ’ s all . How much altogether ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Do you like travelling ? 
 Do you usually travel by bus ? 
 are you ready for your first driving lesson ? 
 the pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas . 
 automatics are very simple to drive . The first thing you should do is put your seat belt on . 
 very funny . Next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . Can you see out of them ? 
 how ’ s that ? 
 check your petrol situation . 
 that ’ s a good idea . Put your keys in the ignition , start it up , put the car in reserve , wait for the road to be clear , and then back out of the driveway . 
 remember , no honking this time . The horn is only for emergencies ! 
 You look like in perfect condition . 
 Which sports do you participate in ? 
 Can you tell me something about yoga ? 
 How do you feel when you practice yoga ? 
 But it will help you keep fit . 
 Excuse me , sir.Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Is it this one ? 
 You are welcome . Looking forward to seeing you again . 
 I booked a room here . 
 Brown , Jason Brown . 
 That's right 
 Yes . 
 OK . Is this all right ? 
 Here you are . 
 In cash . 
 Thanks . 
 Thank you . It looks very attractive . 
 Tasty and tender ! It must be one of the famous local dishes . 
 And it must be very particular in cooking . 
 I see . 
 Wow , the ferris wheel over there is so big . I'd like to take a ride on it . 
 Look at your right-hand . Is it the zone of the Lost Maya Kingdom ? 
 I want to have a try later . 
 Wow , that's my favorite . It's like a superman shooting right up into the sky . 
 Of course . After this , I want to show you to the Haunted House . 
 Bingo ! 
 morning , Mr . Montgomery . I ’ Ve been sent over from purchasing to fill in for Clare Williams . 
 Oh , about seven years . Time flies , you know ! 
 Hello , Pauline ’ s Furniture Store , Faye speaking . How may I help you ? 
 I ’ m terribly sorry about that . We could take it back and deliver a new one to you early next week . Would that suit you ? 
 Please hold on , I'll just check with the delivery department . 
 How are you ? 
 Could you tell me how you dealt with it this time ? 
 Hey , look out ! 
 You've just scratched my car . Oh , God , a paint was scratched off . 
 No , mine ! 
 I've just had it repainted . 
 I am sorry to say this , sir , but you should've been more careful . 
 What about the damage to my car ? What are you gonna do about that ? 
 OK . I gotta call mine too . 
 Is this a temporary job or something more permanent ? 
 When you get your next Continued Claim Form , you should just write down where you worked and note that you no longer need unemployment . 
 Just because you work for a week doesn ’ t mean that you will be losing your benefits . 
 Yes , where do you want to go ? 
 This is the right bus . 
 Certainly . Four more stops after this . I ’ ll call out the stops . 
 What can I help you with today ? 
 What's the problem ? 
 Is there anything else wrong with it ? 
 I can come down and fix that for you if you'd like . 
 How does this afternoon at 2 thirty sound to you ? 
 Alright , so I'll see you then ? 
 We would like you to stop by again so we can show you some more problems that have come up with our apartment . 
 We sent you an e-mail the first week we moved in ; it listed the problems we found . 
 The roof leaks when it rains , there is mold on the bedroom walls , and the dishwasher doesn ’ t work . 
 Maintaining basic health and safety standards is your responsibility . 
 Unfortunately , you won ’ t be getting a rent check unless these problems are fixed by Friday . 
 Which school is your children in ? 
 Oh , it costs too much . It's more expensive than the public school . 
 But the private school don't amount to better schools . 
 So it seems . And what are you going to do about that ? 
 Well , you know how important a clean house is to your grandma . 
 She was the head janitor at St . Mary's Hospital for thirty years , after all . 
 You know , maybe she's just a neat freak . 
 You could be right . 
 Oh , really ? Nice to meet you . I thought they were going to leave me here on my own ! How long have you been with the company ? 
 Does it ever ! Well , let's get started . If you could begin typing this letter now , I'll see what else needs to be done . 
 Good idea . How about a cup of coffee ? 
 Hello , is that Mason's builders ? 
 We have a problem with our roof . Can you come and have a look ? 
 We have water coming through . It was raining yesterday and this morning we noticed a wet patch on our ceiling . 
 Yes , it seems to be just in the living room , above the window . 
 No , sorry , we didn't . 
 Yes , we have a hatch with a ladder . 
 Yes , my wife will be there . 
 That's great . Thank you very much . 
 I'll throw out the garbage . 
 and what if it doesn't work out , right ? 
 You need to quit thinking like a loser . invoking is going to kick butt . You know how I know ? 
 Because I won't let it fail . 
 Mary , besides the resume , I think we should also write an application letter . 
 I think we should begin the letter with a salutation , and the salutation must be very formal . 
 We should say we are very interested in that job , and we hope to get that job . 
 For example , I have mastered Business English very well , and I also know a little Spanish . 
 You can say you have had a firm grasp of the professional knowledge , and you can communicate with others proficiently in English . 
 Let's write it at once . 
 Yes . You could use five or six units.But five or six wouldn't be very efficient . I recommend seven . 
 Let me calculate the price for you . I can give you a 15 % discount if you buy the seven units.Let ' s see here . Your total would be 5929 dollars . 
 As I said , it is possible , but it would be much more expensive . I think it would be at least 12000 dollars to do a complete system . 
 It's more practical , and the new units really are very quiet.Your customers won't even notice them . 
 Yes , that's for the units.Installation would probably be another 700 to 1000 dollars.But it depends on the time spent , of course . 
 No , Ma'am . Installation isn't included.The price I quoted was just for the units . 
 I know that , Ma'am . But they would just raise the price of the units to cover their costs.Here in L . A . , installation is charged separately . 
 I understand , Ma'am . 
 It's a question of quality , Ma'am . At that price , you would not get good equipment . I've been in this business for almost twenty years . I know what happens.If you don't get quality air conditioning now , you will just have to replace the system after two years . 
 Well . 
 Well , we don't usually do it , but ... I believe we can accommodate you on this.We will do the installation for free . Because we appreciate your business . 
 I am calling to say thank you for the interview yesterday . 
 Is there anything I should do ? 
 Thank you . Please call me at any time if you have any questions . 
 When you need an apartment , where do you look for one ? 
 Can I share an apartment with someone ? 
 Are apartments expensive in this city ? 
 I want a two-bedroom apartment . 
 Would you have time to go look at apartments with me ? 
 Hi , still in the office ? It ’ s already 7 . 
 Sounds like our boss . Typically him always late with important information . Anything I can help ? 
 Ok , shall I make a coffee first ? 
 Hello . Welcome ! 
 This way please . We offer multiple manicure services here . Do you want a full service ? 
 But the full service will make your nails look much prettier and it is on discount now . 
 OK . Please sit down . I hope you will be satisfied with our service . 
 Hello . Good morning , Stately Restaurant . May I help you ? 
 Fine , sir . For how many people , please ? 
 OK . What name , please ? 
 Can you spell that , please ? 
 Oh , thanks , Mr . Kaufman . We look forward to your visit . 
 Have you been coming to this Laundromat long ? 
 Why is that ? 
 I've just started doing my clothes here . 
 My washing machine broke down . 
 It's too expensive to get it fixed . 
 Yeah , I think that's what I'm going to have to do . 
 Julia , look at me ! I'm gaining weight . How could I lose weight ? Do you have any good ideas ? 
 Are you sure ? 
 Really ? Does swimming have other advantages ? 
 That ’ s great . Okay , from now on I would swim three times a week . I hope I can get rid of the weight . 
 I am waiting for a fax but just now I found there ’ s something wrong with the fax machine . 
 Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ? 
 Gucci , you look serious . I wish you ’ d let your hair down . 
 I don ’ t want you to be worried , but our son has some bad habits now . He says painful words everyday . 
 He says kick mommy , beat mommy , don ’ t want mommy very quickly if I do something that he doesn ’ t like . You know , if I wash his face or change his clothes , things like that . 
 Yes , but sometimes he is just not reasonable . 
 It ’ s easy to say , but I will try . 
 I know my parents sometimes threaten to punish him . But this doesn ’ t work , instead he picks up another bad habit . 
 I need to have some money transferred from the UK , from my company . It's kind of an emergency . 
 That would be wonderful . The problem is I don't have an account with you . That is a problem , isn't it ? 
 T / T ? What on earth is that ! ? Sorry , but I've never heard of it . T / T ? 
 White Rose Restaurant . Good afternoon ! Can I help you ? 
 Certainly , sir . At what time should we expect you ? 
 And what is it going to be , Chinese food or Western food ? 
 May I have your name , sir , please ? 
 So it's Mr . Peter , a table for six for the evening of the next Monday . It is Chinese food and you are coming at 6:30 . 
 Thank you for calling us . We'll be expecting you next Monday . 
 Thirty bucks a record . Or five for one hundred and twenty bucks . 
 Absolutely . I bought them from the King's estate myself ! Tell you what-I'll let you have five for one hundred bucks . 
 OK . Five for eighty-five bucks . That's my final offer . 
 My watch always gains ten minutes a day . 
 No kidding . 
 You know what you can do ? 
 No , you don't have to . You only need to put your watch back ten minutes every day . 
 Yes , that's what I am doing . 
 Hi , what brings you to my office today ? 
 Have you had the flu lately ? 
 Have you ever been tested for allergies ? 
 Does this happen all the time or maybe a little more in the cold weather ? 
 I feel that you should see a pulmonary specialist to check for asthma . 
 How are the children doing in your class , Jane ? 
 Which child is this ? 
 What a large child ! 
 And which child is this ? 
 What an agile child ! 
 Now which child is this ? 
 Mm . All my children hope to go to college . Right ? 
 Not bad . There ’ s a new English teacher . 
 She is beautiful . 
 She is quite young and her hair is blond . 
 Not really . Her eyes are blue . 
 Not much . She is very tall and slim . 
 Good afternoon , sir . 
 Could you spell that , please ? 
 One moment , please . Ah yes , Mr . Hilton , you booked a single room for three nights . Is that correct ? 
 I see from the computer that you are a frequent guest here . Do you have your loyalty card ? 
 Thank you . Right , your room number is 105 . Here's your key and receipt . Thank you for choosing our hotel again , sir . 
 Goodbye . 
 Sure . Our company is in Ericsson Tower , No . 12 Like East Street , Chaoyang District . 
 You can make it by the No . 913 bus , or by subway Line 13 . 
 Yes , but he should bush it off as if it were not a big deal to him . 
 Are you looking for a small , medium , or large pan ? 
 Does this one look big enough ? 
 Well , what do you think of the aluminum pan ? 
 Here's the same pan , but it has a space-age , heat-resistant plastic handle . 
 I'm so happy that you found what you wanted . Do you want to use a credit card ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry . Here's the lid . Yes , it comes with the pan . 
 Here you are . 
 I want to check these three pieces and I'll carry this overnight bag by myself . 
 Well , then , how much do I owe you ? 
 Would you like to order anything else ? 
 The waitress is walking over here with our check even as we speak . 
 Yes , she really went out of her way to make this a pleasant dining experience . 
 How much money should we leave for a tip ? 
 She definitely deserves 20 % for a tip . 
 Yes , what a wonderful meal ! 
 Hello , can I help you ? 
 What dress size do you wear ? 
 This dress is the latest fashion form Paris . It ’ s made of pure silk . And this silk blouse would go with this skirt . Do you like it ? 
 Why don ’ t you try it on and see how you feel about it ? 
 How does that feel ? 
 You look wonderful . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 I think that looks like a very nice house . Is it on our Internet listing for Open Houses ? 
 I love the beautiful lawn . What a great front entryway !

 I'm considering entering for the beauty contest this summer , so I must have a slender figure . 
 I'm afraid the judges do not think so . All the beauty contests are for slim girls only . 
 How much do they weigh ? 
 But I'm not fat enough to enter that contest . 
 Almost ready . I am making a double check . 
 Of course . And I have also packed two umbrellas just in case of raining .

 As a rule , we use cardboard boxes for outer packing . Besides , I would like to make it clear that each piece of computer will be dismantled into several parts before shipment . 
 Yes . As you know , that's the common practice for exporting computer . This can avoid some damages on computers in the process of transportation . 
 If you prefer wooden cases , we will provide them . But cardboard boxes are light , less expensive , and more convenient to handle in the course of packing and unpacking . 
 Perhaps . That will be more complicated , if we use wooden boxes . 
 That is guaranteed . Each box is lined with foam plastic in order to prevent damage by air , water or stress . Besides , cardboard boxes will be secured together on wood pallets by overall metal strapping . 
 Is there anything that you are interested in ? 
 Yes . It's a prototype of our new product . It has got more advantages than the second did .

 In my opinion , overly strict regulations are just another way of restricting imports . 
 Why not ? Our cannedlichee and canned provisions have already been widely sold in various markets abroad , and the Ma Ling Label has now been accepted by most of overseas customers and importers . Is it quite impossible for you to use the Ma Ling labels as they are ? 
 In that case , what can we do to help you ? Have you any suggestions ? 
 Do you think that's the only way out ? You know we usually do the labeling , as we are responsible for the brand labels of our products . 
 Certainly . What's your size ?

 What department did you study in ? 
 Why do you choose the Law School ?

 Excuse me , sir . I am coming to apply for the position of accountant . 
 I graduated from Tianjin College of Commerce . 
 My major was accounting . 
 Sure . I took such courses as accounting principles , commercial accounting , cost accounting , industrial accounting , electronic data processing accounting , and accounting involved in foreign capital enterprises . 
 I'm engaged in accounting . 
 My work involves various routine bookkeeping and basic accounting tasks including journal entries , verifying data and reconciling discrepancies , preparing detailed reports from raw data , and checking accounting documents for completeness , mathematical accuracy and consistency . 
 I think so . 
 Of course . This balance sheet contains three major sections , that is , assets , liabilities and owner's equity . So , you see , the total current liabilities of your company are $ 3,372 , 000 , and the owner's equity is $ 5,400 , 000 . That means that the total assets , which is equal to the sum of the creditor's and the owner's equities , are $ 8,772 , 000 . 
 The creditor's equity is the same as liabilities . 
 I was in my friend's room talking for an hour of so .

 I needed to write it for $ 100 . 
 Thank you so much . 
 Fine . Here you are . Anything else ? 
 Last week , we had a performance review on all the staff in our department in last quarter . Stevens , can you provide more information about the performance review ? 
 They are popular in and out of our department . Fred is easygoing , while David is cautious in working . 
 So , I want to recommend them for a raise . Fred is promoted to be the assistant of manager in marketing department and David to be director of office . 
 No , thank you . 
 On second thought , I will have a cup . 
 Which train is the ticket for ? 
 It is not too late . Pass your ticket to me , please . 
 Five Yuan . 
 Joe , can you squeeze me in sometime today ? 
 I know what you're saying , but I have to go over the books with you before I go see our tax guy . 
 National Trust . 
 Just one second , and I'll check . 
 Is there a bus tour ? 
 I'd prefer the night tour . 
 Hello ! 
 Oh , hi , Donald . 
 Well , it rained hard all day and I had a bad cold , so I decided to stay home . 
 Oh , the telephone lines were damaged by the storm . They repaired them yesterday . 
 No , they stayed home and played cards with the children . 
 No . I listened to records and studied , what did you do yesterday , Donald ? 
 Were you at the scene during the robbery ? 
 Were you able to see a lot ? 
 What happened ? 
 Could you see his face ? 
 Was he with someone else ? 
 Would you be willing to come down to the station for further questioning ? 
 Alright , tell me what you think . 
 Yeah , maybe you ’ re right . How about this outfit ? 
 No , I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just had to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It ’ s casual , yet sophisticated . 
 How about this scarf , these earrings , AMD an anklet ? 
 That ’ s a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense . 
 Yep . Here it is . What do you think ? 
 The leopard print sounds fabulous . Are they a name brand ? 
 That ’ s even better than the real thing . 
 It ’ s too bad I did all that shopping yesterday ! 
 What a find ! So , how much does it cost ? 
 Ninety dollars is pretty steep . I'll take it for sixty bucks . 
 Eighty-five ? That's the best you can do ? I'll come back later ... 
 It was bad . 
 But I already tried my best . 
 Oh , there is something wrong with my car . 
 I want to change a new car . I like Honda best , especially the red one . But it is too expensive . 
 Yeah . Maybe I can find my favorite car in addition to Honda . 
 Well , Mr . Cui , could you tell me why you are interested in working with this company ? 
 I see . But have you ever done any work in this field ? 
 Why do you plan to change your job ? 
 Have you applied for work with any other companies ? 
 If you are accepted at both places , which company will you choose ? 
 Miss , where do you want to go ? 
 No problem . 
 Yes , you are changed 50 cents a piece . 
 Hello . I'm Duty Manager today ; you wanted to speak to me ? 
 Yes , Sir . We can provide these loans in both local and foreign currency , Temporary Working Capital Loans , Short-term Working Capital Loans and Mid-term Working Capital Loans . 
 Which one interests you , Sir ? 
 Have you received any degrees ? 
 How about your academic records at college ? 
 That's very impressive . Which course did you like best ? 
 Can you tell me why you changed your major when you were a graduate student ? 
 Did you get any honors and awards at college ? 
 Do you have any other questions ?

 I'm looking for books on WTO.Could you show me where they are ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Turn on the TV , please . 
 What's wrong with the TV ? It isn't clear and the color's not right . 
 Can you do something about it ? 
 That's better , but it's still not quite right . 
 Good idea . 
 920 pm , I couldn't say . I can't remember . 
 I'm absolutely certain . 
 I'm not quite positive . I think I went out at about half pass nine . 
 No , I didn't . 
 Quite sure . 
 I'm looking for an MP - 3 player . Which brand is of the highest quality ? 
 Which model is the best-seller ? 
 May I have a look at it ? 
 Do you have this model in white ? 
 Then I'll take the yellow one . 
 Okay . 
 Yes . I want to reserve a table for two this evening . 
 Well . In that case , we will have to go to another restaurant . Thank you all the same . 
 Of course . Did you ? 
 That's sad , but have you gone to the movies recently ? 
 I'm serious , have you ? 
 I really want to go to the movies this weekend . 
 I really don't want to go by myself . 
 No , I think I'm going to go to the movies . 
 Your lease isn ’ t up yet . 
 That ’ s going to be a problem . 
 It ’ s a problem because I can ’ t give you your deposit back . 
 You ’ re breaking our contract . 
 That ’ s not going to happen . 
 That ’ s really not my problem . 
 Sure , Mum.In a minute . 
 Yes , Mum . 
 I bought it online . 
 Yes . I buy most of my daily necessities online . 
 Yes , much better . You can log in a website , browse through many items and categories comfortably at home , order the goods , pay by credit or debit card , and the goods will be delivered to your home . 
 And you can still go ' window shopping ' just like in a real shopping mall . 
 Yes , most of the shops are closed at 22:00 or even earlier , but the internet operates 24 hours a day , seven days a week , and can be accessed anywhere . 
 Sure . You can buy almost anything you can think of . 
 Come in , young man . 
 I am Smith , the personnel director . Please have a seat , son . 
 Actually , I haven ’ t had time to look it over . Did you bring another copy with you ? 
 Call me Mr . Smith . 
 Pardon me , but I was wondering if you could break a one . 
 I need the change for the stamp machine . 
 I'm sorry to trouble you but there is a lot of noise in next room . 
 It ... , I think the neighbor on the right . 
 I'm not sure , but I think so . I'm very exhaust but I can't sleep . 
 If the nest room is still noisy , could you give me a different room please ? 
 Mandarin is the language I spoke since I was a child . So I can speak it very fluently . 
 I can speak and read Cantonese because I worked in Guangdong for many years . 
 I think , maybe , it takes a real Kung fu master to give a more fair assessment ; meanwhile , I am no more than a beginner . But I really doubt whether kung fu would be of any great help when it comes to defending oneself in real life . 
 An art ! You have a good point there . So it is called martial arts in English . The Chinese are really capable of doing things nicely . They even made fighting a great enjoyment , so marvelous and fascinating . 
 I know he is a martial arts fiction writer . But I've read none of his novels . 
 I see . They must have incorporated a series of Chinese cultural elements . 
 So kung fu is also a means of self-cultivation , isn't it ? 
 Could you just run through the evacuation procedure ? 
 Should we use the stairs ? 
 Have you washed any clothes yet ? 
 When you wash your dark clothes , can you put some of mine in ? 
 Just make sure you keep it on the gentle cycle . 
 There isn't a lot , why , do you have a large load to wash ? 
 Do you mind washing my clothes ? 
 Thank you so much . 
 Excuse me , I'd like to try some Chinese food . 
 I know nothing about Chinese food . Could you give me some suggestions ? 
 Is there any difference ? 
 How about Sichuan food ? 
 Oh , really . I like hot food . So what is your recommendation for me ? 
 Thank you . 
 Good morning , madam . I think I'm lost here . The place I want to go to is a hotel called the Hilton . 
 No , I am sorry I have no idea . I am a stranger here . 
 Oh , yes . My friend told me the hotel was near the Central Railway Station . 
 Can you show me where the Central Railway Station is on this map ? 
 Excuse me . Can you tell me where the Wal-Mart supermarket is ? 
 Is it far from here ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Excuse me.Does this train go to Brooklyn ? 
 Do you know when it leaves ? 
 Oh , it's ten o'clock . I'd better go now . 
 No , thanks . I'll have to meet my friend at the airport . 
 Are you kidding ? It ’ s summer . 
 What's that ? 
 Really ? It's unbelievable . 
 Do you have Ginkgo trees here ? 
 What are these trees opposite to the pine trees ? 
 I think I know that . 
 It's still early . 
 Since we're late , let's go to see a film . 
 Steven , what's the expense of moving house ? 
 It costs a lot of money . Hospital bills had already made deep in-roads into our savings . Do you think the rest of your salary will be enough to cover our daily expenses ? 
 We have to cut back on our shopping from now on . 
 I hope so . 
 We hope that this dispute can be settled through friendly negotiation without its being submitted for arbitration . 
 Mary , could you please come in for a short while ? 
 Mary , I'd like you to meet Richard , Our new executive in the marketing . 
 Welcome to our department . I hope you'll like it here . 
 Sure , if you've got any problem you can ask me . 
 Richard , Mary is a very helpful and experienced secretary indeed , and I'm sure you will find out . 
 Hi , Bill.It ' s Marsha Black at MPPD Ltd.How are you ? 
 Not too bad at all.Do you have a minute ? 
 We're ready to place our Christmas order and we need a formal bid . 
 Right , this is not a drill . This is for all the marbles . 
 ASAP , in writing of course . 
 The usual guys , so you better use a sharp pencil . 
 How do I submit an expense report ? 
 You mean I have to attach the receipts with the expense report ? 
 Let ’ s call it a day . 
 It ’ s hard to commute a long way . 
 Are you ready to order ? 
 And for your entree ? 
 Do you plan on voting this Tuesday ? 
 I already voted . 
 I had to mail in an absentee ballot . 
 I ’ m not going to be able to vote this Tuesday . 
 I have to work this Tuesday . 
 That same morning I have some business to take care of . 
 Hello . Can I ask what steps I have to go through in applying for the job ? 
 What is the next step ? 
 Ah ! It hurts . Don't touch it . 
 The shoulder . 
 It's not a cut . It's a gash ! It's bigger than a cut ! Ah ! I need a doctor . 
 I'm bleeding too much . 
 Yes . My bike has one under the seat . Get it , quick ! 
 Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist.That will work as a tourniquet.After that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound . 
 No , forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood . 
 I ’ m having a problem . 
 A pipe burst in my wall . 
 The water is causing mildew . 
 Can I just call someone myself to fix it ? 
 You won ’ t do it until tomorrow . 
 So , I can call someone to fix it ? 
 Here ! Here ! Use my card ! 
 Not on your life ! I'm the best man , so I pay ! 
 What's that ? 
 You've got it ! But are we coming back for the music , or for the fruit ? 
 Where else haven't I been to yet ? 
 Sounds great ! How many kinds of folk collections they have ? 
 Private collectors ! Oh , they must have excellent collections . I'll go and see each of them . What kinds of collections can I see ? Come on , David , don't keep me in suspense ! 
 Enough , David ! I can't wait anymore . Let's go right now ! 
 Very interesting . That's really a place I must go and see . And then ? 
 Mr . Chen himself has become an authority in this area , and master of butterfly sample making , I should say . 
 Because I ’ m not in the mood , that ’ s why . 
 Help you in the kitchen , I don ’ t feel like it . 
 Really ? Do I have to do it ? 
 Well , isn ’ t there anything you want ? 
 No , why should I ? I don ’ t feel like it . Besides , I ’ m in such a bad mood . 
 You do ? OK , fine with me . 
 But I also want ya to do me a favor . 
 You gotta have some better deodorant . 
 Do you know what you want to eat for lunch ? 
 I want to get some pizza . 
 Tell me what you want to eat . 
 See , I had a burger for lunch yesterday . 
 How about I get pizza and you get a burger ? 
 Where do they sell both at ? 
 I'd like to purchase a pan . 
 Well , I cook a lot of big meals . 
 Yes , that's the right size , but it's so heavy . 
 Yes , this is very light . But the handle is also aluminum . 
 Great . This is exactly what I was looking for . I'll buy it . 
 Yes . Oh , wait a second , please . What about a lid ? 
 Excuse me , I am a transit passenger for flight PB965 , can you tell me where to go ? 
 Where is it ? 
 I hope it hasn't left without me . 
 With invoking ? No , thanks . 
 I'm not interested , Zina . 
 I don't think so . 
 My wife's birthday is today . I need some flowers . 
 How much do the roses cost ? 
 That sounds good . Last year I paid $ 30 . 
 Give me a dozen . 
 No , I'll just give her the roses and a card . 
 I heard you are looking for a house . 
 How is this going ? 
 I can recommend an apartment for you . A friend of mine is about to move . She doesn ’ t want to rent that house any longer . 
 It is on Spring Avenue . 
 It ’ s $ 240 a month . 
 It includes water , but not gas and electricity . 
 But it ’ s very convenient for you to walk to work . 
 Yes , it is . 
 Certainly ! But I have to contact my friend first . 
 This is a very spacious apartment . It's forty pings , including the parking space . That's about one thousand four hundred square feet . 
 You never know when two might turn into three . 
 Exactly , which is why a three-bedroom is better . And look , there are two bathrooms . 
 I want to find an old music box . 
 Do you have anything made in the 1920s ? 
 Do any of them have dancing figures ? 
 That's fantastic . I think I like this one . 
 Now , is there any warranty with this ? 
 I understand . 
 What do we need for the barbecue ? 
 I can ’ t wait to start cooking . I ’ Ve bought the grill and charcoal.Do you have enough plates and utensils ? 
 And if people drop them , they won ’ t break.We ’ ll need to buy some buns to make hot dogs and hamburgers . 
 I brought some cheese to make cheeseburgers and some onions for the hot dogs.We ’ ll need some tomato catchup and some barbecue sauce . 
 How long does it take to cook meat on the barbecue ? 
 They can cook them themselves to make sure exactly how they like it . 
 Hello , this is Michael . I'd like to speak to Mr . Wood . 
 I will call again in twenty minutes . Thanks . 
 Are you ready to order now , sir ? 
 Would you like an appetizer ? 
 Would you like some soup first ? 
 What kind of soup would you like ? 
 Have you decided on anything ? 
 How about stewed-fried steamed pork ? 
 Are you interested in today's special ? 
 Twice cooked spicy pork slices . 
 Anything else ? 
 During the last two years , there has been a great increase in goods stolen abroad . 
 If the goods are received in apparent good order and condition , the steamship company doesn ’ t have liability for pilferage . How do we protect ourselves ? 
 Is it true that products of high value such as watches , jewels and luxury clothing items are often subject to pilferage ? 
 I ’ d like to set a fixed time for this meeting before we finish today . Can you all take a look at your schedules ? 
 That ’ s out for me . I already have a standard meeting on Thursdays at 9:30 a . m . How about Wednesday afternoon at 2 
 I would like to exchange this dress . 
 Is there anything on sale today ? 
 Are dresses going to be on sale ? 
 That's great . I'll wait . See you next weekend . 
 May I help you ? 
 Have you brought your receipt ? 
 I am sorry , we will change yours for a new one . 
 It leaves at 8 
 Just a moment please . Yes . You can have a seat . 
 It thirty-eight dollars . 
 Here ’ s your ticket and change . 
 Go to gate No . 2 please . 
 Don ’ t mention it . 
 Yes , I ’ d like to activate my voice mail service please . 
 Sure that sounds great ! Are there any other fees ? 
 Perfect . I also wanted to know if there is any call forwarding service ? I am usually out of town and would like my calls to be forwarded to a local number . 
 I need to copy a document immediately . 
 Great ! How much is it for a copy ? 
 That sounds reasonable . I'll be down there immediately . 
 I have redecorated my bedroom . I decide to repaint the walls and change the pictures . I also bought a new pair of curtains . What do you think of it ? 
 I bought a new mattress and some fresh bedclothes . I also bought a new dressing table and a new bedside table . 
 Do you think that I should get a new wardrobe ? 
 Yes . I have some many clothes stuffed into it . Perhaps I should get rid of some of them . There are clothes in there that I never wear anymore . 
 That ’ s a good idea . After I get rid of the old clothes I no longer wear , I can see what new clothes I need to buy . 
 Ok . I ’ ll let you know when I ’ Ve sorted out my clothes . 
 What are you thinking of getting ? 
 I think I may get something too . 
 I have a sweet tooth . I want candy . 
 I really want some chocolate . 
 I either want a Snickers or a Kit Kat . 
 Then I guess I'll just get a Snickers . 
 Let's take the MET . lt's faster and cheap . 
 We should take the red line . Let's get the tickets at the automatic vending Machine . 
 5o dollars . Later you have to place your ticket near the sensor . 
 It's so crowded . All the seats are taken . Let's go there . There is a seat over there . 
 Yeah , you are right . Let's stand . It takes only about 20 minutes . 
 Anyway , we are arriving at Danshui soon . I can't wait to watch the beautiful sunset . 
 Sure , sir . Have you brought the cloth ? 
 Well , I recommend you to choose the 100 % cotton . 
 Is it all right for me to come in now . Mr . Sutcliffe ? 
 Do you mind if I sit down ? 
 I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put in for a transfer ? 
 Do you mind if I speak frankly ? 
 Well , you see . I don't like the office . I don't like the staff.and I'm afraid you and I don't get on . So may I put in for a transfer ? 
 Good morning . Could you tell me the times of trains to London , please ? 
 What time does the 7:59 train get to London ? 
 What about coming back ? I'd like to come back at about 7 p . m . 
 Mmm , how much is a return ticket ? 
 An ordinary return , please . 
 Poor Ben , your wife is too mean to you . She gives you so little money every time when you are out . 
 No , doing it in the long run will make you an acute man . 
 That's because you are always fixing your eyes on the bald . 
 I wanted to talk to you about that , Mr . Eng . Mr . Emory would prefer to keep the deadline as is . We can start earlier if you ’ d like . 
 Certainly , sir . We can wait another day or two . 
 But why ? 
 OK , I see . 
 Yes , that will be just as good . 
 All right . Then I can do some shopping today before going back to my country . 
 Yes . I'd like to open an account that enables me to draw money easily . 
 How much is the service charge ? 
 Sounds reasonable . Will 300 dollars be enough for a minimal deposit ? 
 Anything else ? 
 Have you ever shopped online ? 
 Do you have some experiences to share with me ? I want to have a try . 
 What about the registration procedure ? Is that complicated ? 
 It is so nice of you . 
 Sure , company rules are not very strict at this point . 
 But remind you , there are some forbidden activities . 
 Don ’ t use office phones for personal matters . 
 Never ever come to work drunk , also smoking in the office is not allowed . 
 I think I may rent this apartment from you . 
 How much are you looking to rent it for ? 
 That is too expensive . 
 How does $ 850 a month sound to you ? 
 That ’ s the best that I can do . 
 Would you please reconsider ? 
 Hello , this is Mary from the Taipei new station , what can i do for you ? 
 Hi , Mr Wang , who do you wish to speak to ? 
 Davids who , we have 5 Davids in the office . 
 Please hold on a minute , offer your call to Mr Richton . 
 You are welcome . 
 From here , it does look like it could use a little work . Let ’ s see what the interior looks like . 
 Sometimes all a place needs is a little bit of cleaning and some fresh paint . 
 I think that we should check out the kitchen . It is listed as roomy and spacious . 
 The picture in the listing shows a lovely master suite . I think that we should go look at it since we are here . 
 Well , I think that it is pretty safe to say that this is not the house for you . 
 Oh , honey , you made a mistake . 
 OK . Let's do it together . 
 16 divided by 2 equals 8 . 
 I've heard that you are going to call for a tender . What kind of goods would you like to buy ? 
 When do you open the tender ? And where ? 
 And when is the closing date ? 
 Could you please tell me something more about the conditions for the tender ? 
 Thank you for your information . 
 I'm sorry to have taken up too much of your time . 
 Okay , bye ! 
 Welcome to Al ’ s Garage . What seems to be the problem ? 
 Very wise decision . When was the last time you had a tune up ? 
 We usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers . 
 First of all , we change the motor oil and oil filter . If you don ’ t do this , it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves . 
 We also check your spark plugs , fuel filter , and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones . 
 Trust me , regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs . 
 Hello Mike . How are things going for you ? 
 Fine . Everything is just fine . 
 Mike , I enjoyed your company , but I am getting ready to graduate soon . I really need to focus on my studies . 
 It would be better for me to just deal with getting my work done , but thank you for a lovely dinner . 
 Of course . What is your size ? 
 OK . I'll get it for you . 
 Try this one , please . This is made of real leather and is very soft . How is it ? 
 Aunt Shirley , I heard the Yuan Miao Festival is the name for the festival . Why did it get its name ? 
 Oh , I see . I also heard today is the last day for the street fair . Can ’ t wait to sample all the snacks . 
 Can you recommend some must-try ? 
 What ’ s that ? It gets the name from the festival itself . That ’ s really funny ! 
 Oh , I know Tangyuan . It ’ s a sweet snack , good for dessert . 
 I ’ d like to try the salty ones . Where does that strange smell come from ? 
 Well , I guess that ’ s about it . Everything ’ s packed and ready to go . 
 Have fun ! I plan to spend some more time with my grandkids , and I might even go back to school . 
 Could I make a reservation for Flight 10 to Tokyo ? 
 How about the next flight-tomorrow at two o'clock ? 
 Betty , something is burning . Can you smell it ? 
 Look ! The iron is still on . 
 Look at my nice blue shirt , there ’ s a big hole in it . 
 Never mind , dear . 
 Yeah , hold on a second . I ’ Ve got it in my office . Here it is . 553-2213 . 
 No problem . Pick me up something to eat too , please . 
 You look a bit pale , don't you ? 
 You should get plenty of sleep . 
 If I were you , I wouldn't drink too much . 
 You better do some exercise every morning . 
 Why do you worry about your future ? You're very young , and you'll make great contribution to the world . I hope you take my advice . 
 Let ’ s start with the basics , bread . Bread is an important ingredient here . You need to remember one thing - choose the bread according to the following criteria , freshness , crumb and color . If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven , or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color . 
 Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light . The best choices here are evident — cucumbers , tomatoes , onions , sweet pepper or chilli , lettuce and , of course , herbs — you can ’ t go wrong with them . As for aubergines , mushrooms and asparagus , I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil . 
 That ’ s all the time we have for today , but join us next time where we ’ ll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna ! Till next time ! 
 Sure . It ’ s on basement level one . Turn right when you get off the elevator . 
 No problem , John . 
 I'll have to check . Do you need anything else ? 
 That'll be 14 dollars in all . 
 Here you are . 
 Really ? Ugh ... Is there any difference ? 
 Gee . I must have left it in my hotel room . 
 But when does the plane take off ? 
 Oh , my God ! What do I do now ? Bone head , bone head , bone head ( He smashes his head with his hand . ) . 
 ( The speaker in the airport says , ' Mr . Benjamin , we now have a boarding pass by the name of Benjamin at Lost and Found . ' ) Is that me ? 
 Oh , thank God . Thank you , I'll be right back . 
 It's down in the lobby . Turn left at exit B . 
 Is there any chance to further study ? 
 Do you have training program or plan for employees ? 
 You look tired . 
 Really ? How come ? 
 You shouldn ’ t work so hard . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Excuse me . Is this where I catch the bus for the zoo ? 
 That doesn't sound too bad . 
 Maybe that's what I'll do . Thanks a lot . 
 My dear , it's five flights up ! 
 Is the place well-furnished ? 
 What about the kitchen ? 
 Are the plumbing all right ? 
 The place is OK.Let ' s go there and have a look at it again . 
 Well , I ’ Ve got a terrible stomach-ache and I keep needing the toilet . 
 Well , I went to a seafood restaurant last night and I ate lots of oysters . 
 Ok . Thank you very much . 
 Hi Mike , how are you doing ? 
 Everything is going great . 
 Mike , I had a good time too , but I am getting ready to move back to the east coast , so I think I shouldn't get too involved right now . 
 Right now , I think I need to really focus on matters at home , but thanks for a nice evening . 
 Yes , the lift is just around the corner.You can go up first , and your luggage will be brought up straight away . 
 Pardon me . Could you help me ? 
 I am looking for a sweater . 
 Medium , I think . 
 It's pretty . Can I try it on ? 
 I can't get into my room . I mean I left my room key inside . 
 Oh , did they ? Well , would you give us an extra key to the room ? 
 By the way , what should I do with the key when I go out ? 
 Hi there ! My name's Terry Graham . You're new around here , huh ? 
 Well , if there's anything I can do for you , let me know . 
 How do you want your hair cut ? 
 Who is Peckham ? 
 You are a big fan of him ! He has strong legs . 
 Hey , wake up . It's done . How do you like it ? 
 But it's the same hairstyle . 
 Oh . I made a mistake . I thought the guy on the right was Peckham . 
 Sorry , but do not worry . I think I can fix it . Just cut a little more off the temple . 
 Tommy played truant today . His teacher called me this morning . 
 I've asked him , but he won't tell me . What should we do about this ? He is like you . I remember when we were at the college , you always skipped classes . 
 Stop , stop ... We are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . Maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school . 
 In that way , I'll be late every day . How about letting him go to school on school bus ? 
 That's because I went to school for each class when I was at school . So now I am much more clever than you . 
 It seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax . Ok , no problem . We do it ourselves . 
 Check with somebody from the IT department . They are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment . 
 They're right over there , next to the dictionaries . 
 Let ' s see . These books here focus on grammar , and those are mainly for conversation practice ... Here we are . This book has short passages for students to read and answer questions about . 
 Excuse me . I want to pay the bill . 
 Here you are . 
 No , I'll e paying for myself , but I have private medical insurance . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Today is Saturday , isn't it ? 
 What's the date today ? 
 I have a meeting this afternoon . 
 It will begin at three o'cock . What's the time now ? 
 I have to go now . I don't want to be late . 
 Good evening , Mr . Taylor . I'm so glad you were able to come . 
 Now dinner's ready . Let go over to the dinner table . Would you like to use the chopsticks or the fork and knife , Mr . Taylor ? 
 Yes , hope you like it . Do you need beer or wine ? 
 I'm glad you like them .. . We'd appreciate your kind consideration in the coming negotiation . Let's drink to our friendship . 
 Come on , darling.We haven't got much time . 
 Half past six ... and it's half past six already . 
 We haven't . Hurry up ! 
 And about time too . 
 The Northern Line is what you want . 
 It's two yuan . 
 Just go through the No . 8 ticket-barrier over there . A train will be in directly . 
 That's all right . 
 yes , are you ? 
 you do know that it's absolutely freezing out , don't you ? I'd put a coat on if I were you . 
 well , it's started raining since then . Look out the window ! It's pouring rain out there ! 
 have a look outside for me . Does that look like hail to you ? 
 that's a good idea . But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it . 
 how long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ? 
 maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse . 
 good idea . That will help us to warm up . 
 alright . I'll have a cup of tea waiting for you . 
 This is Room 320 . Can I have a morning call tomorrow ? 
 Seven , please . 
 Thank you . 
 He is the guy I was telling you about . 
 Thank you.What ' s the fare ? 
 How can it be ? 
 I see . Thanks for your drive . 
 No problem , sir . There's a copy machine in our computer lab . 
 Each copy will cost you a dime , sir . 
 There aren't many things you can get for a nickel , sir . 
 No , I haven ’ t . 
 Perhaps you left that at school . 
 Well . Didn ’ t you go around to the Smith after school ? You might have left it there . 
 But she can ’ t be home now . She might have gone to the library . 
 Show me a smaller pair of trousers , sir . I am not that fat , you see . 
 I have no idea . Measure me , please . 
 ( After trying ) I'm afraid it's still too fight around the stomach . 
 ( After trying ) Mm , a perfect fit . How much ? 
 A little expensive . But I'll buy it anyway . It's hard for me to get a perfect one . Here is 200 Yuan .

 It's a private garden . 
 No more today , honey . 
 Yes , honey . Go to your room , and take out your book . It's your reading time now . 
 Just go to read . I will find it , honey . 
 I apologize . This should not have to be this way . 
 Of course , I should have been more careful . I ’ m sorry . 
 I'd like a beef-burger , a French fries and a milk shake , please . 
 I'm not quite sure . What do you have ? 
 Very well , I'll try the banana flavor . 
 No , thanks . That will be all . 
 I'm looking for an engagement ring for my girlfriend . I have an idea of what she likes , but I want to surprise her with something special , too .

 Yes , I would love to work on a special project ! 
 I want to buy some cloth to make a curtain . Which one is better ?

 That's fine . Could you give me some more napkins , too ? 
 Yes , I would also like some sweet and sour sauce and pepper . 
 Do I owe you anything for the sauce , pepper and napkins ? 
 I love the peaceful life in Canada . 
 I'd like to , but I'm afraid I can't afford the life here . 
 Do you need any help ? 
 Walk along the way and then turn left , It's right there . 
 No , you don't have to . It's a duty-free shop . 
 Excuse me , Mr . , Macmillan ? Could you tell me the fax number for Mr . Winthrop ’ s office , please ?

 Hello . I am calling about the apartment you advertised . 
 I am interested in one-bedroom . Do you have any available ? 
 Sometime around next week . What can you tell me about this apartment ? 
 Sounds good . May I come over tomorrow to take a look ? 
 How about 10 am ? 
 My name is Blanca . 
 I swear I will never shop at a street market in China . It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something . 
 yes . Last Sunday I went to a nearby market . It was on open-air fair . I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot , without even trying to strike a bargain . I paid one hundred and twenty . And just 
 but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ? 
 Sam , you ’ Ve got to forgive me . 
 I used your computer . And I ’ m afraid I ’ Ve erased your personal files accidentally . 
 I ’ m afraid not . I apologize . 
 I told you I ’ m sorry . What can I do to make it up to you ? 
 Could you do something to advance your time of shipment ? 
 I hope you'll try to convince them to step up production . 
 Well , in that case , there is nothing more to be said . What's your last word as to the date then ? 
 All right . I'll take you at your word . May I suggest that you put down in the contract shipment on October 15th or earlier ? Our letter of credit will be opened early September . 
 That's very considerate of you . And now , shall we discuss the insurance terms ? 
 I suppose the additional premium for the special coverage is for the buyer's account . 
 Then what about SICC ( Strikes , Riots and Civil Commotions ) ? Can we request you to cover this for our imports ? 
 Then please cover W . P . A . and TEND for this transaction . 
 I wonder if you could allow us any discount for this commodity . It's the general practice that wholesalers usually get some discount from manufacturers or suppliers . 
 But we usually get a discount of 3 % to 5 % from our other suppliers . Actually , some discount on your prices would make it easier for us to promote sales , you know . 
 Ladies and gentlemen , dear Mr . Simpson . Following the increasing communication between Unity Company and Pineapple Computer Company , we established steady cooperation . And today we all here feel very proud and honored to have Mr . Simpson with us . Mr . Simpson is well-known for his success and his career .

 Well , I also hope our cooperation will be never-ending . Thank you again .

 The reservation was for a double for three nights , wasn't it ? 
 Credit card .

 Bottoms up ! 
 Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .

 Hello , Jenny . What's the matter ?

 What's the problem with Sons ? 
 Is there a big selection of organic foods at Whole Foods ? 
 I haven't been shopping there , but maybe I'll try it sometime . 
 I'll take your word for it . 
 Doctor , I have a bad cough and a headache . 
 I don't know , but I feel terrible . 
 Do you think I should lie in bed ? 
 OK . Do you think I can play football tomorrow ? 
 OK , I'll listen to you .

 Anything else ? 
 How about drink ? 
 Okay , Rebecca . Now you ’ Ve given me a good idea of your work and academic background , but what about you as a person ? How would you describe your key strengths ? 
 Yes , true , but how about other personal qualities ? 
 What would you say is your most positive quality ? 
 Hello , can I help you ? 
 What color and what style do you like ? 
 Well , you can have a look at our skirts hanging there .

 I have a major stomachache 
 I had spaghetti with clam sauce for lunch . 
 Yes , that could have been it , but I haven ’ t been feeling that great for the past few days . 
 Not really . Things have been going OK . 
 I think that I might be getting the flu . 
 Yes.There are the Huangshan Hotel and Anshan Hotel nearby.And you can take a taxi to go there . 
 You're welcome ! By the way , you'd better booked in the Internet or the telephone next time and then you kow whether there are rooms available or not . 
 Can I help you ? 
 What's wrong with them ? 
 The front brake ? 
 What kind of car is it ? 
 Write down your name and address , give me the key , and I will check it out . 
 No . 
 About half an hour . 
 So can you fix it ? 
 What do you mean ? I bought this computer just three years ago ! 
 OK , I know where this is going . How much will it cost me to get a new computer ? 
 I have no idea what you are talking about . I just want to know if it ’ s good and if I will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time ! 
 Have you ever shopped at Whole Foods market ? 
 It's very good , and it's fresh too . 
 I shopped there before too , but the food is better at Whole Foods .

 The food there is a great step up from Sons .

 Your order will be ready soon , thank you for calling . 
 You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness . 
 Do you really think so ? I don't . It will just make us fat and act silly . Remember last time ? 
 I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends . 
 Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us . That is excellent exercise and fun , too . 
 All right . 
 the chef is going to slice it into thin pieces . There will be around one hundred and twenty pieces of both skin and meat for each .

 Which of them is the local train , please ? 
 How much is the fare ? 
 What should I do with the token ? 
 Oh , I am not sure I even want to look at this house ! 
 It doesn ’ t look much better inside this place . 
 There are hardly any windows in here , and that makes it really gloomy . 
 Look at those broken tile countertops and the peeling wallpaper . 
 What ’ s that smell ? 
 Okay . This trail looks the best . It's a little steep . But I'm sure it will be alright . 
 ... What a stink . This place stinks like rotten eggs . 
 Suddenly the ' great outdoors ' isn't so appealing . Let's hike a little faster ...

 There are various choices of blood pressure medication that we can try . 
 We could start with Hydrochlorothiazide , which is a diuretic . 
 There really are not many side effects . You need to drink a lot of water when you take this pill .

 Sure . Go back and take the third turning on the left . 
 It is really like a labyrinth . 
 I am sorry . That table has been booked . 
 Taxi ! Taxi ! 
 I ’ d like to go to the railway station please . 
 Is it a long run to the station ? 
 The streets are heavy with traffic at this time of a day , are they ? 
 Is it the rush hour ? 
 No , I ’ m not . Would you please drive slowly and carefully ? 
 I need to find the cereal aisle . 
 Where is that at ? 
 I think I can find that . 
 Actually , I do need to find the dishwashing detergent . 
 I thought it was over there . 
 I really appreciate all your help . 
 The bank closes in 30 minutes and I need to cash a check . 
 Thanks . But it ’ s necessary for me to buy a TV set . 
 You can take me to the bank if you want to . 
 Honey , I think you should quit smoking . 
 But I want you to be fit . 
 Check out this article . It says smoking can lead to lung cancer . 
 But you know that smoking does harm to health , right ? 
 Stop beating around the bush . Will you quit or not ? 
 What seems to be the problem ? 
 Where does it hurt the most ? 
 How long has it felt like this ? 
 Do you have a history of stomach pain ? 
 Well , I think that we are going to have to get you to an emergency room right away . 
 If we give you the job , what ’ s the most important thing you except to get ? 
 Just this ? 
 Do you want to get a promotion ? 
 Where would you like to be in 5 years ? 
 How do you plan to accomplish this ? 
 Good morning ! Welcome to our bank ! How may I help you ? 
 OK ! Come this way please . You should fill a form here first . Here you are . 
 If you don't mind , Mr . Smith , please go to counter number six to queue up and wait for the service . 
 My pleasure . 
 Well , I'm trying to buy some foreign currency for my holiday . 
 We are going to Macau to visit my niece . She said it's better for me to bring US dollars , is that right ? 
 OK , I see . What's the exchange rate ? Is the dollar up or down ? 
 To be honest , I have no idea about these things ! But I'm sure that's alright . 
 Hello , the International Hotel . May I help you ? 
 What time would you like your table ? 
 Would you like to sit in the hall or in the private room ? 
 Wait for a moment , please . Let me check whether the private room is available or not . No problem . 
 OK . A reservation for eight at7 : 30 , Room 208 . Please don't be more than half hour late , or we will have to give it to other guests . 
 Sorry , you have the wrong number . There's no Brian here . 
 No , it's 777-9344 ? 
 That's OK . 
 Sure . Go straight on down this road , take the second left and then the first right . It ’ s next to Tiananmen Square . 
 Don ’ t mention it . 
 It is just too much . Don ’ t you feel it is an exaggerating style to decorate offices in that way ? 
 Well , I doubt that . 
 What do you have ? 
 Can I have apple pie with ice cream ? 
 I love you home made apple pie . It ’ s delicious . Can I have another glass of lemonade as well ? 
 Ok . Would you like a drink too ? 
 Are you having any dessert ? 
 Excuse me.We ordered too much.May we take the food home ? 
 Do we have to pay extra charge for that ? 
 Well , then , will you put this and that into doggie bags ? 
 Thanks.Would you do me another favor ? 
 Some more Chinese tea for us , please . 
 I just moved into my apartment , and the plumbing is not working . 
 The bathtub barely drains at all . 
 Neither the kitchen nor the bathroom plumbing is working well . 
 It just started happening last night . 
 I will not be home . 
 I was trying to find the class on preparing for interviews . 
 I am so happy I found this class because I was really nervous about my upcoming interview . 
 Our dress and grooming are probably the first thing an interviewer judges us by . 
 Yes , and they help establish a friendly tone for the rest of the interview . 
 What else should I be thinking about ? 
 You ’ re working hard , George . What are you doing ? 
 Which hammer . This one ? 
 Here you are . 
 What are you going to do now , George ? 
 What colour are you going to paint it ? 
 Pink ! 
 My name is Sue . How do you do , Mr . Black ? 
 Thank you , sir . 
 Thank you . I wonder whether I can enjoy the life insurance and health insurance . 
 Good . Anything else ? 
 Thank you , sir . 
 I'm a little short . I don't have enough for you . 
 I really don't have enough money . 
 Well , why don't you ask Bob for some money ? I'm hungry too . 
 Okay , so on Friday , you can buy yourself something to eat . 
 You can always go home and make something to eat . 
 Sorry . That's not my fault . 
 That's all right . 
 I'd just like a trim and don't make it too short . 
 A little trimming , please.Trim a little more above the ears . 
 Yes , I would like to look at some of your products . I think what I am using now does not fit me well . 
 What do you have in foundation ? 
 What colors do you have in foundation ? 
 The color I use now is natural beige . How much do you sell it for ? 
 That's expensive . 
 I understand . I need a lipstick , too . Do you have lipsticks in red ? 
 All right . How much is it ? 
 Well , I'll take them . 
 The reason for my application for this position is simple . My educational background and professional experience make me qualified for the job . 
 Oh , just one thing , could you give me some ideas of the pay ? 
 2,000 RIB per month . 
 3,000 RIB per month . 
 No , that's all . 
 You did a wonderful job . 
 Yes , you passed . 
 You did mess up on something . 
 Your parallel parking isn't all that great . 
 You just need a little more practice . 
 You got it . 
 I'd like to work in a law firm to enrich my experience and put what I've learned into practice . 
 Well . During the college years , I worked as a trainee every summer at lawyer's offices . Does that count ? 
 I did clerical stuff and ran errands . 
 May I know about the office hours ? 
 Er , may I know how much I will be paid monthly ? 
 When will I know your decision ? 
 Yes , I did . Can you call after 7 p . m . ? I'm usually out in the daytime . 
 Good-bye . 
 No , I'm good . All we need now is our check . 
 I think that is our waitress is over by the bar . Boy , the service has not been good this evening . 
 Good . Just bring it back and we'll total it together . 
 What do you think would be the right amount to tip ? 
 I agree that it was bad service , but I heard one of the other waiters mentioning that it was our server's first night on the job . 
 I think that a tip of $ 3.60 will be the right amount to leave . 
 Ugh , I feel terrible . I went out last night with Trevor , and things got a little out of hand . 
 We hit a couple of local bars , and met up with some friends . Everything was cool until Mike came along , and it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday ! 
 Tell me about it ! We drank everything in the bar ! 
 Yeah . I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous . I threw up like five times . 
 I was so dehydrated that I drank like a gallon of water , and my head has been pounding all day . I swear , I ’ m never gonna drink again ! 
 Oh , yeah . I ’ m there ! 
 You just need to send an application . 
 Yes . You are expected to know the e-mail address of the company . 
 I am accomplished in English and computer . Besides , I've got a Teacher's Certificate . 
 Yes . I regard instructor as a decent occupation and I love to be an instructor . 
 What is it , dear ? 
 You mean stuff like tampons and sanitary napkins ? 
 Follow me . All the things you need as a woman are in aisles 10 and 11 . This section is usually near the medicine section in any supermarket . 
 Hello baseball fans , and welcome back to today ’ s game ! My name is Rick Fields and of course , I am here , once again , with the man that seals the deal , Bob Copeland . ' 
 Well , the national anthem has just been sung , and the umpire has started the game . It ’ s time to play ball ! 
 A very nice curve ball by the pitcher . The catcher gives him the sign , he winds up and Vargas gets a line drive ! 
 Great play ! 
 Home run by Okapi ! That puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at Richie Stadium ! 
 These shoes are great ! What is the price of this ? 
 That's too much ! 
 Yes , I'm thinking of buying some T-shirts , but I find your price is on the high side . 
 I'm not so sure of that . I think it's difficult for me to push sales at such a price . 
 I think to get the business done , you should at least reduce the price by 20 % . 
 As a trial order , I'll take 5,000 dozen this time . 
 That's really a big change from 20 % . I really can't accept that . 
 To conclude the deal , I'd say a reduction of at least 15 % would help . 
 If that's the case , I'll have to go somewhere else to meet my needs . 
 8000 would be too large a figure to be used for a trial . 
 Ok . Let's call it a deal . 
 I ’ m just finishing now , ma ’ am . I ’ ll have them ready within the hour . 
 You ’ re welcome , ma ’ am . I ’ ll call you when they ’ re ready . 
 I ’ m great . Thanks . 
 I need to know if I have any fees to pay . 
 How much do I owe ? 
 That ’ s crazy ! 
 Can I do that right now ? 
 I think I ’ ll be paying with cash . 
 No problem . 
 You know that I have no secrets toward you . 
 Why asking that ? It's often the sort of Dutch treat . 
 I ’ m sorry . She ’ s in a meeting right now . 
 Can I give her a message for you ? 
 And your name , please ? 
 Certainly . 
 Good evening . Could you let us have a double room ? 
 A week or ten days . We'd like to have a quiet room , if possible-not too near the street . 
 What's the price per day ' ? And are the meals included or extra ? 
 All right , we'll take it . 
 OK . 
 Sally , do you really need to go ? 
 But don't forget to give me a ring . 
 Hello , Anna . Come in and sit down . 
 What's the matter ? 
 Do you often suffer from backache ? 
 When did it start ? 
 Well , go home and rest in bed for two days , then you'll feel better . 
 Yes , I'll give you some pills . Take one a time and three times a day , and come back in three days . If you don't feel ... 
 How about your academic records at college ? 
 In which subject did you get the highest marks ? 
 Have you received any scholarships ? 
 Have you been a class leader ? 
 Did you join in any club activities ? 
 What sport are you good at ? 
 You are excellent . 
 Well , there are several things . Of course , you must do everything you can to keep costs down and revenues high . 
 No . if you do that , the workers won ’ t like their jobs . They will be less efficient and you will get a high staff turnover . Those things will increase you costs . 
 You need to invest in some good advertising . You have to know where your potential customers are and target them . It ’ s no good trying to sell computer games to older people . The market is too small . 
 Find out what other companies charge for the same products or services . Price yourself near the low end . Don ’ t be much cheaper than everyone else , because many customers distrust very cheap things . Th 
 Yes ? How can I help you ? 
 Yes . 
 Yes . The limit is four per family . 
 I know . This is a really good bargain . 
 No problem . 
 Julie ! It's good to see you again . How have you been ? 
 Really ? How was it ? 
 I hear the beaches in Thailand are beautiful . 
 I do like Thai food . Did you see much of Bangkok ? 
 I know what you mean . I could use a vacation myself . 
 Yeah , it sure would . 
 Excited about what ? 
 Is this the first time you ’ Ve voted ? 
 That ’ s lucky . 
 You turned 18 in an election year . 
 Really ? 
 You ’ re a part of history . 
 I suppose you know very well that we require irrevocable letters of credit payable against presentation of shipping documents . 
 I'm afraid it has been our practice so far to insist on payment by L / C . 
 I understand that . Still , I'm not in a position to help you . Maybe we could do something later when we have had more and larger deals together . 
 For your high blood pressure , we have several choices of medications . 
 Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic that helps you with water retention . 
 Most people have no side effects . You will have to make sure that you drink plenty of liquids with this medication . 
 I am going to add a second drug for now , Lisinopril , which is an ACE inhibitor . 
 You will feel much better except for the fact that you might have a little cough . 
 Don't you have one like this in blue ? 
 Do you need every color in the rainbow ? 
 Ze ze ze ... Women ! 
 Yes . The two sides declared a short ceasefire but it broke down earlier today . Several military target were destroyed by bombing . Many civilians were among the dead and wounded . 
 Bout side claim a small area of territory . Both sides tried to build border fences and began attacking each other . 
 Relief agencies report that many civilians are in desperate need of food and shelter . Several European countries have agreed to send aid , but are afraid that their planes will be shot down . 
 Both countries are very poor . Soon they will run out of money to finance the war . Then , perhaps , they will negotiate . 
 Great . The bed is exactly what I have been looking for ! 
 Oh , I like red wood . How much do you charge for it ? 
 That's sheer robbery ! 
 It's more than I can afford . Can I make an offer ? 
 Shall we make it 250 dollars ? 
 What about 260 dollars ? 
 It's a deal . 
 We have no choice but to hold you responsible for the loss we sustained . 
 Well . I hope there won't be such things . 
 What are you doing to your house ? 
 What are you going to do to it ? 
 What colour are you going to paint them ? 
 What else are you going to do ? 
 Can you give me a hand with my luggage ? 
 Well , this apartment is really a must-see . Will you come with me to look at it this weekend ? 
 Great ! Do you know someone else who is also looking for an apartment ? 
 Can you lend me some money ? 
 You ’ Ve gone through all your money so quickly ? I thought you were well-off . 
 You'v been work here for nearly a month , how do you feel about the job ? 
 I had the same feeling when I first came to work here . but after a period of time , I feel better , I am sure you ' ll get used to this busy job . 
 You know the phrase the survival of the fittest . We have no choices . 
 Do you know a bus that goes to the Gold Line station ? 
 My house is up in Altadena . 
 It'll really take me to the station ? 
 Do you know what street it goes on ? 
 I would've never known . 
 I appreciate you telling me . 
 Honey , we are all out of wine and cheese . Do you mind running to the deli and picking up a few things ? 
 Your friends and family are coming over tonight and we still need to get a lot of things . 
 OK , pick up some cured meats to go with the wine . Maybe a pound of polish sausages , ham , liverwurst , salami and any other cold cuts that are on sale . I think I saw a promotion for pastrami . Also get some cole slaw and a jar of olives . 
 Never mind that . Get some dips as well . Get a jar of spinach and blue cheese dip and also some Tzatziki . If they have bean dip get that as well . Last but not least , get some pickles . 
 Very funny ! Get a move on ! People will be here any minute . 
 I am calling about the advertisement for a flat with a bedroom . Do you still have it now ? 
 Is there any furniture in it ? 
 What's the rent for a year ? 
 Where is it located ? 
 That's great . But can you make the rent cheaper , let's see , 12,000 Yuan ? 
 OK . I will be free at tomorrow afternoon . I'll take a taxi to get there . 
 Mr . Black , I ' d like to take some time off . I ' Ve been feeling exhausted these days . 
 Yes . I was wondering if I could take another two weeks off . 
 The project I'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week . I'd like to take my leave from next Monday on . 
 Thank you , Mr.Black . There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . Mr.Smith will be in charge during my absence . He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients . 
 I will . Many thanks , Mr.Black . 
 These red ones ? I'm not sure . 
 Oh , these ? Hmm ... Yellow isn't a good color for me . 
 Which one ? 
 It's $ 42 ! ! That's expensive ! 
 We need to figure out how much money we ’ re spending and what we ’ re spending it on . 
 Well , I think we could be saving more . 
 Let ’ s see . We spent $ 700 dollars for our home loan payment , $ 400 on groceries , $ 75 on utilities , $ 250 on gasoline , $ 100 on books , and $ 300 on entertainment last month . 
 We put $ 500 into the savings account , and $ 750 into our stock account . 
 Right . 
 I'm not sure if we've got any now.Books of that kind are on this shelf.Well , I'm afraid we've sold out . 
 Come some time next week if you like . I think we'll have got some by them . 
 This is the schedule for the project . Any comments or questions ? 
 Don't worry . These dates are only targets . 
 I don ’ t know ! This stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me . Luckily , I managed to start it up and drive it here . What do you think it is ? 
 What do you mean ? My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month . It ’ s brand new ! 
 Ugh ... So how long is this going to take ? An hour ? 
 What ! How am I supposed to get to school or go shopping ? This is not happening ! 
 Go ahead . 
 Good morning . I'd like to speak to Peter . Chen Please . 
 This is Tim . Hunter from Hunter industries . 
 We have an appointment for this afternoon . Mr.Chen will know why I'm calling . 
 Hello . Can I speak to Anne ? 
 It ’ s Mike , her boyfriend . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Yes , certainly . I'll be back in a minute.Here you are . 
 Of course not . Let me check . Oh , you seem to be correct . 
 Only ten percent of taxes included in the bill . 
 It sure does . 
 Perhaps if you would be kind enough to tell me the problem , sir . 
 Oh , no , are they back ? I'll give you another room immediately , sir , and a refund for tonight . 
 Sir , without happy guests , we are nothing . 
 Very well . Thank you . 
 Do I have any fees to pay ? 
 How much ? 
 That ’ s unbelievable . 
 I want to pay all of it off today . 
 I ’ ll be paying with cash . 
 Hello . Is there a package tour to Beijing ? 
 Does the tour have a Chinese-speaking guide ? 
 What is the cost of the tour ? 
 It's a bit expensive . Can you tell me the schedule ? 
 Well , do you have any experience in guiding ? 
 What places of interest did you show them ? 
 After you 
 What's the weather like in your country ? I suppose it must be warmer than here . 
 We don't have much snow in winter in Beijing . In fact , we haven't had any so far this winter . The winter is rather long , but the cold is generally not severe . The temperature seldom gets as low as ten below zero Centigrade . 
 About freezing point , I think.But the morning's forecast said that we are going to have a very cold spell in the next few days - and the temperature will probably drop to 10 or 15 degrees below zero . 
 It is considerate of your wife . 
 Fall is the best season in Beijing . It's neither hot nor cold . The sky is clear and blue . There's hardly any wind , only a slight breeze which is hardly noticeable . And we have plenty of sunshine too . 
 Good , you are welcome . 
 well , it depends . 
 of course yes . 
 very touching . 
 yes , it is so . i love songs that take me to some places i have not been or have been for a long time . it is fun and exciting . 
 it is full of energy . 
 it certainly is . 
 All right . In my first teaching position I received the Excellent Teaching award the past two years in succession . 
 Yes . I was chosen as one of ' the Top Ten Prominent Youths of Beijing ' in 2002 . 
 Yes . I have got two articles in English in The International Youth Writer's Collection . 
 yes , you sent them to New York , right ? 
 what did you in mind ? 
 we have plenty of postcards to choose from here . The same designs can be found on these posters . 
 yes , we do . They're on the wall behind you . 
 the prices are clearly marked on the back of each mask . Would you like me to get one down for you to look at ? 
 here you go . 
 are you looking for some homemade chocolate as a gift . 
 we've got plenty to choose from here . 
 Hello , could I speak to Allison , please ? 
 When do you expect him back ? 
 Well , may I leave a message ? 
 Would you please ask him to call Chris when he gets back ? 
 I'm afraid he doesn't . My mobile is 139- 2477 - 4026 . 
 Hello , Miss , what can I do for you this afternoon ? 
 Yes , it is , busy today . We usually have a lot more clients on the weekend . Would you like to take a sit , and wait for a while , please ? 
 It should be around that , if you like , please for a free to read the magazine while you are wait . 
 Sorry to keep you waiting , Miss . I'll have a dresser Mr.Li is just finish with a client in a moment or two . Would you have a shampoo first ? I'll get it on for you . 
 Come on , Let's go for lunch , Gregory . 
 Don't worry about it.It ' s on me . 
 I agreed , Hi , guess what ? I went bungee jumping last weekend . 
 Definitely . you know , I'm into serious sport in a big way . 
 come off it , It's not that serious . You should DIY ( do it yourself ) sometime . 
 No , really , I think you'd like it . I adapted to it right off the bat . 
 I can teach you how . 
 No , not really , but I think I have lost my wallet . Where can it be ? 
 Um , okay . Well , I just want a trim . Nothing too fancy . 
 Okay . Um ... can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top . 
 Um ... no . 
 Let's have lunch together today . 
 I want a Hamburger and ice cream . What about you ? 
 What about cheese cake or apple pie ? 
 How often are stockholders meetings held ? 
 What percentage of the stockholders actually attend the meetings ? I'm guessing not a large percentage ... 
 So , how much say do the stockholders really have ? 
 May I take your order now ? 
 Do you want some salad dressing ? 
 We have Italian , French , thousand island and blue cheese . 
 Where is it ? 
 Get in , please . 
 Don't worry , you'll be there plenty of time . That is it . 7.15 $ , please . 
 Mr . Jones , shall we now discuss the packaging ? 
 Good . A wrapping that catches the eye will certainly help push the sales . With competition from similar garments producers , the merchandise must not only be good value but also look attractive . 
 What about the outer packing ? 
 Cartons ? 
 Could you use wooden cases instead ? 
 I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for such a heavy load . 
 Maybe you are right , but the goods are to be transhipped at Hamburg or London . If the boxes are moved about on an open wharf , the dampness or rain may get into them . This would make the blouses spotted or ruined . 
 Well , I don't want to take any chances . Besides , cartons are easy to cut open , and this increases the risk of pilferage . 
 Maybe so , but I'm afraid that in case of damage or pilferage , the insurance company will refuse compensation on the ground of improper packing , or packing unsuitable for sea voyage . 
 If you could guarantee compensation in case the insurance com - any refuses to honor a claim for faulty packing , we would be quite willing to accept cartons . 
 I can understand your position . Perhaps I'm asking too much . 
 Well , I'll call you immediately for instructions on the matter . 
 Oh , my god . What happened ? Are we dying ? 
 Well , thank you . Mr.Parry , for all your information . Just one more question . 
 Do you play any sports or games ? 
 And what athletics did you play ? Can you remember ? 
 And now ? 
 Well , thank you again for coming to see us . But just remember that we like people who join the company to play in the company sports teams . 
 Oh , dear ! which dress should I choose ? I can't make up my mind . Please help me . 
 Which dress do you like best ? 
 Only all right ? 
 Mike , that's no help to me at all . I can't wear both of them at the same time . I want a decision . 
 Oh , yes . The green dress is very smart . but I can't be sure if it goes with a hat . 
 Well , we just got in some mangoes . 
 Well , it's a fruit with a big nut in it . 
 No , you peel off the skin and throw out the nut . 
 Well , the sale price is $ 1 each . 
 They're like a citrus fruit . 
 You can buy them hard . Wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel . 
 Most of them in this store are from Mexico . 
 I'd like a pair of sports shoes . 
 I just like jogging . 
 Er ... , that blue pair . I need size 43 , please . 
 Very comfortable . I'll take them . 
 Good morning ! Can you help me , please ? I'm looking for some books for my mother . 
 She's very fond of detective stories ? 
 Oh , yes ! 
 I'm not sure , but she probably won't remember if she has ! She's very forgetful ! 
 She's eighty-seven . 
 Thank you . That's a good idea . she likes exciting books . Can you suggest another one ? 
 Thank you , Rick ! As you can see , ladies and gentleman , we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to win the grand prize of one million dollars ! 
 All right , we are here at the eighth hole . It ’ s a par four , and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid . Although , I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole ! 
 Oh no ! Not a good swing at all ! It ’ s definitely not his day today . On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot . 
 Oh no ! A bear ! Run , Tiger , run ! Somebody call animal control ! 
 Sure , Sherry . Sorry to have kept you waiting . If you hadn ’ t told me , I probably would have just forgotten all about them . 
 There you are . 
 Just go straight along this street , turn left at the first crossing and walk straight ahead about 100 meters . You can ’ t miss it . 
 It ’ s about 20 minutes ’ walk , I think . 
 Yes , you can take the No . 5 bus over there . Get off at the next stop . 
 It ’ s my pleasure . 
 I need to do a credit investigation on another company , but I'm worried it'll be a bit difficult . 
 Well , it's an American company , you see . I'm worried that there will be too much red tape involved . 
 Really ? I have been told , by another bank , that it makes it difficult if you want to investigate a company which is registered outside China . 
 I'm not exactly prepared right now . How about I go back to the office , get the relevant information and come back before closing ? 
 I'll return at about 4:30 pm . See you then . 
 Please give me this extra value meal , a red bean pie , and one order of vegetable salad . 
 A cup of hot orange juice . 
 Yes , that's all . 
 Don ’ t you have it ? Did you lose it ? 
 Myrdal , purse don ’ t just disappear . Think carefully . When did you have it last ? 
 OK . Let ’ go back to the hotdog stand . 
 Yeah , I do . I guess I'm a real fitness freak . 
 Well , I do aerobics every day after work . And then I play racquetball . 
 Oh , do you want to play sometime ? 
 Pretty well , I guess . 
 No problem , Rod . I won't play too hard . 
 I wish to have a job in which I can make good use of my strengths and have further improvement . And your company meets all my requirements . 
 Yes , I have purposefully done some homework in advance . 
 Actually , I have applied to several companies recently . But I am most satisfied with your company . 
 Admittedly , I hope it is a job in line with my specialty . But I will make the best effort to do the job whatever is assigned to me . 
 I would continue to work in the company as long as the job suits me well . 
 In my mind , salary is not the most important thing . 
 Sure . Where are you ? 
 What kind of car ? 
 Where are you going to ? 
 You are within 50 kilometers , so it's a 50 - dollar flat rate . 
 About 20 to 30 minutes . 
 What are you going to eat with your sandwich ? 
 What kind do you like ? 
 What kind of apples do you like ? 
 I don't like green apples . 
 Green apples are too sour for me . 
 Yeah , I love red apples . 
 hi , my name's Abby . What's your name ? 
 I'm a freelance English teacher . How about you ? 
 what kind of job are you looking for ? 
 have you ever thought about becoming a freelance IT consultant ? 
 not if you are good at net-working . Do you like to meet new people ? 
 do you have experience in the IT field ? 
 do you speak Spanish ? 
 that's OK . Have you sent your CV out to anyone yet ? 
 did you write a clear objective in your resume ? 
 I think you need to update your CV . Bring it over to my office tomorrow and I'll help you with it . 
 I work so hard that I do not have the energy to exercise . 
 But I work hard all the time for long hours . Often I have no time for lunch . Yet , I am still getting fatter . 
 I know you're right , but what can I do ? 
 But I'll miss the news . It's important in my business to keep up with events in China . 
 That's a good idea ! 
 All right . One moment , please ... No , Mr . Smith checked out this morning . 
 I ' m afraid he didn ’ t leave one . 
 That is very kind of you , Mr Lee . Thank you . 
 Of course . It ’ s a terrible night , isn ’ t it ? 
 Thank you . 
 Sure , here you go . 
 Of course . There you are . 
 How are you doing ? Pretty good , I imagine ? 
 OK , let me hear it . I'd be glad to help if I can . 
 Well , I trust that your presence will hasten the settlement of payment terms . 
 But for an enterprise of your size , an order from us will certainly not embarrass you financially . 
 In what way can we solve the problem ? 
 Yes . But the sum is large , it must be provided by a group of banks . 
 Well , we accept your suggestion . 
 Sorry , madam . I afraid you have a wrong number.we don't have Mr Over here . 
 No , you give a wrong number . 
 That's all right . 
 I ’ m in need of your services . 
 I have a court date coming up . 
 It ’ s the felony charge . 
 What ’ s your rate ? 
 That ’ s too high . 
 I ’ ll hire you anyway . 
 Sure , sir . But there is a charge for alcoholic beverages in economy class . Would you please refer to this price list ? And then give me your order . 
 OK , I will bring it to you in a moment . 
 I ’ d like a coffee please . 
 What have you got ? 
 Goodness me ! What a choice ! I think I ’ ll have a cappuccino please . 
 Mr Ludlow , hello . It's good to see you again . What can we do for you today ? 
 No problem . Could I please see the bill and all of the other documents ? 
 There's no problem here , everything's in order . I can transact that for you now . 
 No , you don't need to pay anything on top . We just simply deduct the discounting interest . 
 What should I wear today ? 
 How's the shirt ? 
 Hello , this is my passport . 
 Those are something gifts I bought for my friends . 
 Of course not . 
 Wow ! So many choices you have ! I wish I could , but I just can't . I'm on a diet to lose weight . 
 I'd better not . Please don't tempt me . Please ! 
 You're damn right . I'm not so easily coaxed into doing something that I think is wrong . 
 Hello , Sir . What can I do for you today ? 
 We've just started a new business at this bank , Bank-Insurance Link . 
 Certainly . It could really benefit someone like you . Besides insurance for you , you can also get more or less dividends from the insurance company . 
 There are two different types that we are offering at the moment , Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit . 
 I'm going to the pub tonight . 
 Excuse me , does this bus go to the new bookstore ? 
 Thank you . How much is the fare to that stop ? 
 How many stops are there ? 
 Could you please tell me when we get there ? 
 By the way , do I need a transfer again after No . 50 ? 
 Thank you . 
 Most willingly . It's 600 dollars per ton . 
 But you know , the price of this article has soared up since last year . 
 OK . I can make a special offer for you . This price is based on careful calculations . And it is the lowest price we can offer to you . 
 Sure , but I don't drink much . So I don't know what to order . 
 It sounds good . I'd like to start with a Compare . 
 Stirred will be fine . 
 Thanks . Does the bar have a signature drink ? 
 Can you recommend one ? 
 It sounds interesting . I'll take one . 
 It tastes great . 
 Yeah . 
 How about we go and get something to drink ? 
 Do you know what you want to get ? 
 Soda isn't the best thing to drink when you're thirsty . 
 Soda isn't good for you . 
 You should really drink water . 
 It's a lot better than soda . 
 Yes . It was so crowded . I'm worn-out . Let's find our seats . 
 Let me see ... yes , one window seat and one aisle . 
 That's fine . I'd like to be on the aisle anyway . It's easier to get in and out . 
 I think the smaller carry-on bag can go in the overhead compartment , and the others can go under the seat . 
 Don't forget to keep the seat belt on . 
 Yes ! 
 Oh , you have too wild of an imagination . 
 I think the plans look good . There's just one thing though , I'm a bit concerned about the main lorry entrance . What's the height clearance ? 
 Are you sure that's high enough ? 
 Hello , this is Steven . Is that Mrs.Wang ? I'm just calling to follow up about the status of the personnel manager position . 
 I ’ m very proud to be employed by your firm . 
 Anytime . 
 Thank you for hiring me . See you then . Bye . 
 May I help you ? 
 Yes . What colors do you like ? 
 How about this one ? 
 Of course . This product moisturizes at the same time . 
 Good morning , sir . Are you Mr . Wang , the personnel manager ? 
 No , you don ’ t . My name is Liu Lili . I got the information from the TV that your department wants to hire a clerk , who will work under you . I would like to apply for the job . 
 OK . I ’ m 24 this year . I earned my college diploma from the Night College of Foreign Languages Institute in 2010 . My major is English . Recently I ’ Ve also earned my degree in Secretarial Technology . 
 Of course . I ’ Ve been working as an office clerk in the Textile Company since my graduation . I do a lot of things , such as typing , handling the daily correspondence , arranging meetings and so on . 
 To be frank , not very much , because I can ’ t use much what I ’ Ve learned in my work . I enjoy doing more challenging work . 
 Of course . First of all , she must have a strong sense of responsibility . 
 She must be an honest person . 
 She must also be diligent and do a lot of things on her own initiative . 
 Well , no . But I took related courses . I can gain experience quickly . I ’ m sure I can do the job well . 
 Yes , do you have a wine list ? 
 Bring us a bottle of Remy Martini and red wine . 
 I need a room for a few days . 
 John Sandals . That's S A N D A L S . 
 I'll be there in April Friday through Monday , the 14th through the 17th . 
 Possibly . What's the actual price ?

 Fine . Beginning when ? 
 That's the twenty-fourth of June ? 
 Your name , please ? 
 Single or double ? 
 You're all set . That's a double room for the twenty-fourth , twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth of June , in the name of Hamlin . 
 Actually , yes I do . I was wondering about the subscription fee . And how much will you charge me during the time of redeeming this new fund ? 
 So , it's going to cost me then ? 
 Good morning , Family . We'll have our board meeting this afternoon . Can you write the agenda on the notice board ? 
 We'll talk about the financial report for the first half of the year . 
 We'll also discuss the personnel plan for the second half of the year . 
 Yes . Please write them down on the notice board . I want everybody to see them . 
 I ’ m ready to settle the bill . 
 Definitely ! Very relaxing . 
 What ? I only stayed three nights . 
 But your brochure said that this was a package deal and the hotel ’ s services were all-inclusive . 
 But why are you overcharging me almost a thousand dollars ? 250 dollars a night , times three nights should just be $ 750 . 
 Perhaps I could talk to your manager ? 
 So , where can I start my work ? 
 And I represent ? 
 Ok , thank you . 
 Hello , Mr . Gao . We appreciate your letting us have the apartment . 
 The ad said rent was thirty thousand . That includes utilities and phone , I assume . 
 That's another one thousand six hundred ? 
 Seat 30B is right here , sir . You may take your seat . I'll put your bag in the above compartment . 
 Yes , sir . I'll bring you a menu shortly after we take off . 
 Here you are . 
 It is a six-hour flight with an-hour layover in Los Angles . 
 Welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you ? 
 Well , there certainly are many benefits that go along with our credit card . 
 You know it is not necessary to pay the balance in full every month . 
 Yes , you will see on your monthly bill and statement the amount in full but also the minimum payment . 
 Yes . As long as you keep making regular monthly payments , paying the minimum is just fine . Of course , your credit limit will be lowered accordingly . 
 For example , if your credit limit is 5,000 RIB and you owe 1,000 RIB , your available credit will be 4,000 RIB . So , your credit limit drops . 
 May I help you ? 
 What size do you wear ? These shoes are on sale . 
 Of course , yes . They look nice . And they're not expensive . 
 They are $ 168 . 
 Where is the produce ? 
 Is there any produce on sale ? 
 That'll be eight dollars , please . 
 Hi , Mr . Smith . I ’ m Dr . Hawkins . Why are you here today ? 
 Yes , well you haven ’ t had one for ... five years . You should have one every year . 
 Well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . So , try to come at least once a year for your own good . 
 Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ? 
 Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . You really should quit . 
 Well , we have classes and some medications that might help . I ’ ll give you more information before you leave . 
 Hey , Trev ! How did the shopping go ? 
 Trev , are you OK ? 
 Aren't you lucky . The vintage-clock guy is driving a hard bargain . So I have nothing . 
 Hey , Ann . Wake up . It's time to get out of bed . 
 Yes , or you'll be late . 
 It went off 30 minutes ago . 
 Rise and shine . 
 Good morning ! May I help you ? 
 Do you have an appointment with Mr . Smith ? 
 Wait a moment , please . I'll tell his secretary that you are here . 
 I'm sorry . He is holding a meeting until ten o'clock . 
 Is there a problem , officer ? 
 Did I really ? 
 I had no idea that I ran it . 
 Yes , madam . 
 I really have no excuse , madam . 
 I understand , and I am very sorry . 
 I like this apartment . Do you think we can afford the mortgage ? 
 I love the balcony . We can sit outside and enjoy the sun in summer . We are on the 12th floor , so there ’ s very nice view from the balcony . 
 Yes , and there are many houses nearby . I like it that the neighbourhood isn ’ t full of apartment blocks . 
 Yes , it would . Don ’ t worry . There ’ s a lawn outside the building and there ’ s the park nearby . This place will be fine . 
 Yes , everything has been well designed . 
 Hmm ... How long will it take to mail things to the USA by air ? 
 I want to send it by express mail . The faster , the better . 
 Here you go . 
 Thanks . 
 I took them from a travel agency . Look at those nice pictures , lash forest , palm fringed , white sand beaches , crystal blue ocean , they ’ re breath-taking . It is like paradise on earth . 
 Yes , I ’ m thinking about signing up for a tour in the travel agency . Their next tour starts the same time as my holiday does next month . 
 10 days . When I get back , I still have two days to go before work . Isn ’ t that great ? 
 I wonder if you could help me , I'm looking for a room . 
 What sort of price are you asking ? 
 Would it be convenient to see the room ? 
 Good morning ! What's wrong with you ? 
 How long have you been like this ? 
 Do you have a fever ? 
 Let me take your temperature first . 
 Adaptability and sense of humor . 
 ( Pause a few seconds ) They say Mr . Chen is an honest , hardworking and responsible man who deeply cares for his family and friends . 
 Honest , flexible and easy-going . 
 I feel that learning how to motivate people and to work together as a team will be the major goal of my leadership . 
 Silence is golden . Just don't say anything ; otherwise the situation could become worse . I do , however , accept constructive criticism . 
 Sometimes , the narrow-minded people make me frustrated . 
 I will try to present my ideas in a more clear and civilized manner in order to get my points across . 
 How long would you like to stay with this company ? 
 Can you give me a hand with some things in the kitchen ? I don ’ t think I can finish everything in time . 
 First of all , I need you to do the drying up . I ’ m almost finished the washing up . I ’ m going to clean the cooker when I finish . 
 We ’ ll have this finished in no time with two if us working on it . 
 Actually , it was just some leftovers from yesterday . I made far too much food to eat alone . I am glad you could come over to help me finish it . 
 Yes . Look in that drawer . I should throw the old one out . 
 May I take your order ? 
 I'm afraid this course is for four persons . 
 I'm afraid not , sir . 
 I would recommend a soup with two or three small dishes . 
 Would you like rice with your meal ? 
 Thank you , sir . Just a moment , please . 
 No , sir . Would you rather sit near the dance floor ? 
 That's free . 
 Your name and room number , please ? 
 Have you used any hotel services this morning ? 
 OK . You have stayed for four nights at 90 US dollars each , and here are the meals that you had at the hotel . That makes a total of 660 US dollars . 
 Of course . Please sign your name here . 
 I'm sorry Marry is out right now . 
 Why don't you call back later this afternoon ? 
 Honey , don't tell me that you want a pet dog also . 
 Honey , you know , we don't have enough room for a pet dog . 
 No , honey , the balcony is full of boxes and things . I'm sorry . 
 Fine , Mr . Richardson . What do you have in mind ? 
 Yes ! I agree ! We could really use another one ! I ’ ll get on that right away ! What else would you like to order ? 
 Yes . So am I . But what will he do after graduation ? He really needs to go to college . 
 I know that but he has to learn to be independent . He can't just keep living at home . 
 Premium or regular , Madam ? 
 No problem , Madam . Should I check the air in the spare tyre as well ? 
 Should I clean the windshield for you ? 
 All right , Madam . It's ok . There is hardly any water in the radiator . It's dangerous , Madam . You could break down , because of the heat you know . 
 Anything you say , Madam . 
 No , we don't . I am sorry . It's 30 dollars and 10 cents in total . 
 Thank you , Madam . Have a nice drive ! 
 Great . I ’ ll have a shot . 
 No , is there a single room left ? 
 For a week or so . Do you give discount for a week or more ? 
 All right . I will take a room for a week . Here is my passport . 
 You're so careless , Billy . 
 I've done it for you . 
 Um ... Hello , I would like to open an account . 
 I want to open a current account . 
 What's the minimum deposit for opening a current account ? 
 Well , here's 3,000 yuan . 
 OK , here you are . 
 Done ! What else should I do ? 
 OK . Thanks . Goodbye ! 
 Good morning.Wilson Association . 
 I'm sorry , but Mr.Thomas left the office a few minutes ago . 
 I'm afraid not.He ' s gone for the rest of the day . 
 I don't believe so.He ' s going out of town on business.May I take a message ? 
 Would you care to make another appointment ? 
 I see . I can tell Mr.Thomas that you phoned . 
 Bye-bye . 
 This is she . How's it going ? 
 Sorry about that . I was cleaning up . 
 So what were you calling me about ? 
 Sure , what did you want to do ? 
 That sounds like fun . Let's do it . 
 See you then . Goodbye . 
 No , I ’ m not sure . I think about 65 mph , right ? 
 No , Officer , not at all . 
 Well , I guess I just wasn ’ t paying attention to the speedometer . 
 Um , because I was busy talking to my friend . 
 Yes , I was using a cell phone . I just bought it , so I decided to give my friend a phone call to tell him about it . While I did that I also turned on the radio and was listening to one of my favorite songs , and eating some food I had bought at a fast food restaurant , and , um ... guess I had too many distractions . 
 By the way , can you tell me where I can find a restaurant not ? 
 How can I get there ? 
 Thank you . 
 I thought you knew , Todd . It was decided last week . I guess you weren ’ t at the meeting . 
 I ’ m sorry . Todd , but Mr . Emory felt that it was going too slowly , and that it needed a fresh start . He should have told you . 
 Let me see , in 5 minuets . 
 Don't worry . The bus tour is really worth while . You can enjoy the whole city in a single day . 
 It lasts 4 hours , from 10:00 to 14:00 
 How do you do , Mr . Smith ? My name is Thou Hong . 
 Will you please take a seat ? Mr . Smith , have you seen the display of our electronic products in the exhibition hall downstairs ? 
 Sure we can . You know , we've been in this line for more than twenty years . 
 Good . We can hold more talks later on to iron out the details . 
 Could we have the honor of you presence of the meeting ? 
 Would you prefer some other time ? 
 Are you quite sure you can come next Tuesday ? 
 What time am I supposed to pick you up ? 
 OK . 
 Yes , this is Holiday Inn reservation . 
 Yes.Your name , please ? 
 That is true . I hope it doesn't rain . 
 It wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now . 
 Any rain right now would be pointless . 
 I want it to cool down some . 
 Winter is great . I wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though . 
 I feel the same way . 
 That is true . I hope it doesn't rain . 
 It wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now . 
 Any rain right now would be pointless . 
 I want it to cool down some . 
 Winter is great . I wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though . 
 I feel the same way . 
 Don't you have a credit card ? 
 Why don't you change the cash to traveler's checks ? It's much more convenient and safer . When you are abroad , you can cash them . 
 Hello , Could you please connect me to Mr . Cook's office ? It is on Line Three . 
 Oh . Then I don't know what his number is . Can you check it for me ? 
 OK . Thank you . 
 Thank you . You helped me a lot . 
 Anything else , sir ? 
 That'll be fifty-five dollars and twenty cents . 
 Oh , no , sir . We already gave you a discount on each item . 
 I have to find a living room set . 
 I don't know . 
 Where did you go to find yours ? 
 Does the furniture from IKEA cost a lot ? 
 How good of quality is the furniture ? 
 I don't mind paying for quality workmanship . 
 I need to order new business cards . 
 I think 2,000 would be enough . 
 I don't want to make any changes to my old card . 
 ... Okay , that's it . Here's the form , and here's my old card to use as a model . 
 I need it sooner . Let me have it in three days , okay ? 
 Can I help you ? 
 May I have your name please ? 
 Alright ... And did you have some specific questions about your application ? 
 Oh , that's no problem . Just give me a moment , and I can check.Judy Liao . Let's see ... Yes , here it is . Judy Liao . We have received your resume . 
 Is there anything else I can help you with ? 
 No , that is all we need . If we have those things included , that is sufficient . 
 I'm not really sure about that . But I know we are still receiving resumes.Maybe after a week or two they will start calling applicants . 
 If you have any further questions , you can call any time . 
 Thank you . Goodbye . 
 Really ? Do you mean that you are leaving ? 
 Where do you want to go ? 
 I will miss you . But anyway I wish you every success at your new post . 
 Hello , do you have any vacancies ? 
 What kind of apartment is it ? 
 Would you give me some fruits ? How much are these oranges ? 
 How about this one ? 
 Well , I'll take five of the seventy cent ones , and those grapefruits sweet ? 
 I follow you and I'll take three just for my trial . 
 That's all.Thank you . 
 Here you are . 
 An aisle seat , please . 
 Well , we just got in some mangoes . 
 Well , it's a fruit with a big nut in it . 
 No , you peel off the skin and throw out the nut . 
 Well , the sale price is $ 1 each . 
 They're like a citrus fruit . 
 You can buy them hard . Wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel . 
 Most of them in this store are from Mexico . 
 It makes no sense to tell him about that . 
 Because he'll tell Mary and that will cause us problems . 
 Oh , she did ? Then it's a used car of course . 
 What else did she tell you ? Did she tell you how many miles there are on it ? 
 That's not bad.What about the price ? Did she tell you how much her friend wants for the car ? 
 Three thousand ! That's almost too good to be true.Did she say why her friend wants to sell it ? 
 Well , we can see it for ourselves.Did she tell you when we can go and look at it ? 
 Do you know a bus I can take from Altadena to downtown LA ? 
 Will that bus really take me to LA ? 
 Is it a very long ride ? 
 Really ? 
 Do a lot of people ride that bus ? 
 Wow , thanks a lot .

 I can get more promotion in your company . 
 Thank you . 
 When I was in LA , I met the WebTracker sales rep . 
 The sales rep had a green note pad just like yours . He said everybody at WebTracker used them . 
 We both may be snakes , Dave , but I'm just better at it . Among the snakes , I'm the sneakiest . 
 Really , what's wrong with it ? 
 Oh , do you use your computer often ? 
 Don't worry . Have you got receipt with you ? 
 We'll go to your house and repair it on Tuesday.Ok ? 
 See you then . 
 Hello , I need a new suit . I have an important interview next week , so I really need to look sharp . 
 Great ! I want a three piece suit , preferably made from Italian cashmere or wool . 
 Sure . I ’ ll also take some silver cuff link and a pair of silk ties . 
 Tommy played truant today . His teacher called me this morning . 
 I've asked him , but he won't tell me . What should we do about this ? He is like you . I remember when we were at the college , you always skipped classes . 
 Stop , stop ... We are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . Maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school . 
 In that way , I'll be late every day . How about letting him go to school on school bus ? 
 That's because I went to school for each class when I was at school . So now I am much more clever than you . 
 I know ! It ’ s an amazing growth opportunity ! They ’ re true industry leaders , and it would be so interesting to be part of an organization that is the undisputed leader in business process platform development . 
 Well , I visited their website and read up on what they do . They ’ re an IT service company that offers comprehensive business solutions for large corporations . They provide services such as ARM development , and they also offer customdesigned applications . 
 Well , the position is for an account manager . That basically means that I would be the link between our and our development team . 
 Well , as I said they ’ re the industry leaders , they have a really great growth strategy , amazing development opportunities for employees , and it seems like they have strong corporate governance . They ’ re all about helping companies grow and unleashing potential . I guess their core values and mission really resonated with me . Oh , and they offer six weeks ’ vacation , stock options and bonuses ... I ’ m totally going to cash in on that . 
 Susan , good evening.Why are you so dressed up ? 
 You look great.Your make-up is perfect . 
 No , the one you have on looks fabulous , especially with your hair like that . 
 With that dress I'd like to say your white diamond necklace would look perfect . 
 Not much , Just a house party with some friends . 
 Yeah , most of the people are from my office . 
 I'm sure you will have fun no matter where you go.Remember to take your bag . 
 Yes , this is the Resume Writing Workshop . Welcome ! 
 It ’ s easy . Don ’ t worry about it . 
 Well , the most important thing we need to do is make sure that our name and contact information are across the top . 
 You can either list your job experience next or your education--whichever is the most impressive should be first . 
 Sure , that would be a good place for them . 
 Usually , you cannot prepare for these questions in advance and have to depend on your immediate performance . 
 In this case , you should first keep calm and normal to the face . 
 Formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation . 
 Try to show the best of yourself with decent words and manners . 
 You should admit your weakness frankly . 
 You must have confidence in yourself . 
 There's some leftover pizza from last night . 
 Um , I think there may be some leftover lasagna from the other day . 
 There might be some birthday cake left in the freezer . 
 You can wash the vegetables and cut the chicken and I'll make dinner ! 
 I have been feeling great , Dr . Smith . 
 Yes , I am going on a cross-country bike ride on vacation and want to make sure that I don ’ t have any problems . 
 I ’ Ve been having trouble with congestion in my chest . Can you give me some tests for that ? 
 That would be great . What is the blood test for ? 
 I have been feeling great . I don ’ t imagine that any of my tests will turn out badly . 
 It says on the bottle here that you can have two refills . 
 Alright . I'm sorry , Miss . According to our file , this prescription has already been refilled twice . 
 Well , it looks like you have.You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription . 
 I'm sorry , Miss . We can't do it . We must follow the prescription.And this prescription has run out . 
 Miss , I understand your problem.But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription.It ' s the law . I can't do anything about it.We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . Never . 
 A prescription must be valid . It cannot be an expired prescription . I'm sorry , Miss . It's the law.You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you . 
 Miss , I just can't help you on this . I'm a pharmacist , not a doctor . And there are other customers I need to help now . I know it is frustrating when this happens.But there is nothing I can do about it . I'm sorry . 
 Maybe that's true . I don't know.But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too . 
 Yes , Marry ? 
 I see . 
 Maybe so . But I'm fast learner and I'm willing to work overtime to learn the business . 
 I must to ask you to reconsider your decision and give me a chance . 
 It just isn't on time today . 
 I think it'll be here pretty soon . 
 I really do hate public transportation . 
 That's right . 
 Oh , that's the worst . 
 I completely agree with that . 
 I don't know . Where did you leave it ? 
 Are you sure ? 
 Well , you should have kept an eye on it . 
 Let me get a hamburger . 
 No cheese . 
 Can I get a soda , please ? 
 I'd like a Sprite . 
 I'd like a bag of Doritos with that . 
 That'll be all . 
 Barbara ! 
 Yes , that's right.But I'm having a holiday here . 
 Yes . I'd like to see one of those ties . 
 Yes . 
 OK . I'll take it . Will you gift-wrap this , please ? 
 How long is the warranty ? 
 How about the repairs after the warranty expire ? Are you responsible for the fixing if the machine breaks down after the warranty period ? 
 Will you supply spare parts if we want them ? 
 What can I do for you , sir ? 
 OK , may I take your size ? 
 Could you show me how to operate this fax machine ? I am going to receive some urgent fax from a company .

 What size prints would you like ? 
 All right , ma'am , they'll be ready for you in an hour .

 Yes , because a real man doesn't need Mom to worry about him so much . He can do things by himself . 
 Oh , my poor Danny , sure , you are a man . But you know , running like this in street is very dangerous . 
 Do you remember the rules of road safety ? 
 Walk the sidewalk and please right-hand side . 
 Yes , so you still remember , ah .

 Bull . I're done my research . I know you still control more than 65 percent of invoking options . 
 That doesn't matter . I want at least 4 percent . 
 About 50 miles . 
 No , but we ’ Ve got a hurry . It will be the rush hour soon . 
 But it ’ s Friday today . This road is always jam packed during the weekend , isn ’ t it ? 
 I'm taking a date to a restaurant , so could you please direct me to a good one ?

 I have no idea where to get it from . 
 Well then , where do I get it ? 
 I didn't know that . 
 I appreciate you telling me . 
 I'll make sure to get it tomorrow . 
 Good , let's go for a drive . 
 Great . 
 There are 3 secretarial categories here . One is receptionist , one is junior secretary , and the other is senior secretary . 
 I would like to be able to work independently and take over some ordinary responsibilities such as answering routine correspondences , taking phone calls , and sometimes assisting you with personal business affairs . 
 Yes , I am . I opened an account with you about a month ago , but today I'm here to see about a loan of some kind . 
 Yes , that's fine . My credit is good ; I banked at my former bank for many years . 
 Haha ! Actually , I felt that your array of services is much better than what my old bank had on offer . Plus , I've got plenty of friends who bank with you and they are extremely happy . 
 I have everything right here . I'll let you go through that and come back . I'd like to have a good read of your materials to make sure I make the right choice . 
 Just a minute , please.It ' s in my bag.Here it is . 
 All right.Shall I enter all my belongings ? 
 Are you ready to order , sir ?

 Here are a variety of red wines for you to choose . You can have a taste then make your decision then . Here is the wine menu . 
 Then do you like any cheese to go with it ? 
 Oh , no . But cheese is the best thing to go with red wine . And we have really fresh cheese which will be free if you order red wine . Here are the pictures . Pick out something you like .

 Anything for dessert ? 
 OK . Please wait for s while . We'll get it done quickly ! 
 Yes . If people can not communicate with each other easily , they can not understand each other's way of thinking . 
 Many exporters speak French and German as well . 
 Even if the language is accurate , a misunderstanding can not be avoided due to cultural differences . 
 Yes , it not only includes the nation's historical and cultural background , but also contains the nation's view of life way of life and way of thinking . 
 Hello , my name's David Wong . I've ordered a sofa from you last Wednesday . I wonder when it will be delivered today . 
 It's 45132 . 
 May I have the bill , please ? 
 How much altogether ? 
 Does it include the charge for drinks ? 
 Here is $ 200 , keep the change , please . 
 Thank you for seeing me . Did you look over my letter and resume ? 
 Yes , I think it is possible more important than the salary . 
 Good , about the essential living conditions ? 
 I see . I'm a female . Are there any special benefits for me ? 
 I think it is very necessary for us . I wonder whether I am on holiday with payment every year . 
 Right . How about the unemployment compensation and the retirement pension ? 
 Yes , I see . 
 Hello , Lucy . 
 Yes , I have decided to work with your company . 
 It ’ s my honor to be one member of your company . I ’ d like to begin to work any time as you like . 
 No problem . Thank you for calling me . 
 Can I take your order now or do you still want to look at the menu ? 
 Certainly . How about spaghetti with clams and shrimps . 
 Good morning , what can I do for you ? 
 Oh , I see . Would you mind telling me your monthly salary ? 
 OK . We can supply you a loan . How much do you want to loan ? 
 It's only 4.5 % for one-year loan . Do you want to apply now ? 
 OK . Please fill out this loan application . 
 My pleasure . 
 Two hours.That area is a little backward . 
 You're right . 
 Is this the right counter for gloves ? 
 Well , let me see some of each . 
 Six and a quarter , I believe , but you'd better measure my hand to make sure . 
 Very well , I'll take these two . 
 Ah , good morning , Mr . Smith . Nice to meet you . I'm Peter Anderson from Personnel . Do sit down . 
 Now , have you brought your curriculum vitae with you ? 
 Have you brought your certificates as well ? 
 Yes , that'll be all right . Well , please tell me about your working experience . 
 OK , so do you think you can make yourself easily understood in English ? 
 Yes , I am young , and unmarried . It's no problem for me to travel frequently . 
 Thank you very much . I'm looking forward to your call . 
 I want some coffee . 
 What have you got ? 
 I think I'll have a latte , please . 
 Do you speak a foreign language ? 
 How well do you know English ? 
 If we give you the job , what ’ s the most important thing you except to get ? 
 Just this ? 
 Do you want to get a promotion ? 
 Where would you like to be in 5 years ? 
 How do you plan to accomplish this ? 
 What are in this folder ? 
 Are they filed alphabetically ? 
 Can you find last month ’ s report for me , please ? 
 Oh , my god ! I look so old . I look as if I were 40 . I think it's time for some plastic surgeries . I'm tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin . 
 Anyway I think I need a nose job and some breast implants as well . 
 I know what you mean . I just want to make myself more attractive . 
 Really ? 
 And so , I just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are with this project . As you know , you ’ Ve missed a fairly significant deadline last week , and this will negativity impact the team ’ s ability to move forward with the next stages of this project . 
 Oh , come on ! An excuse like that is tantamount to lying . You ’ re essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues , rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks . 
 I ’ m not going to accept this excuse . You ’ re using these small technical glitches as a crutch and trying to rationalize the fact that you ’ Ve missed your deadline . Look , we have standards and I expect you to live up to those standards . No more phoney cases . If you ’ re in over your head , you tell me . No more missed deadlines . Now , I want that data on my desk by nine am ! 
 May I ask if there's anything wrong with it ? 
 Oh , sorry.But do you want to change it for another one ? 
 Welcome to IBA . Which service do you require ?

 Of course . Financing Link is a value-added service , and can be tailored to suit your requirements .

 Why didn ’ t you call me last night ? 
 Why didn ’ t you phone me from a callboy ? 
 Tell me why you didn ’ t come to see me tonight then . 
 I like the design of the coat . 
 Anyway , it's my ideal coat . I'll take it . 
 Hi , I'm out of here . Here's my key . 
 Thank you . 
 I only had nine little problems here . Other than that , I enjoyed my stay , and I loved the city . 
 oh , Sam ! Is this your dog ? 
 Cindy , you're so cute . 
 I have a little white cat . 
 yes , cats are always gentle . and they don't need a lot of space since they're small . 
 not at all . They're quiet most of the time.But they can be every bit as affectionate as dogs . 
 absolutely . Believe it or not , I found my cat by a garbage can around my neighborhood two years ago . 
 yes . It was starving and looking for something to eat when I saw it . 
 now we get along very well . It makes me feel that I'm someone special . 
 I would like to have my clothes washed . What's the rate ? 
 OK , here are the clothes . 
 Good afternoon , how can I be of service today ? 
 It is possible to take into account special circumstances , should the manager agree to it . If your credit rating has been class A in your initial trading period and your debt to asset ratio is sound , and then I'm sure the manager will see you to discuss it further . I'll set up a meeting for you . 
 Ah ! It hurts . Don't touch it . 
 The shoulder . 
 It's not a cut . It's a gash ! It's bigger than a cut ! Ah ! I need a doctor . 
 I'm bleeding too much . 
 Yes . My bike has one under the seat . Get it , quick ! 
 Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist.That will work as a tourniquet.After that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound . 
 No , forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood . 
 I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed . What do you think ? Damn , it hurts ! 
 I'm lucky I wasn't killed . I must have been going around forty-five miles an hour.There was too much gravel on that corner . I slid out . 
 Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped.Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk . 
 There . Stop ! 
 Yes , I must go to Shanghai to attend a meeting about our plan . 
 Six days or so . 
 Harry . He has been assisting me on the plan . 
 Yes , he is familiar with the plan . 
 What the magic ward to say if you want something good to happen ? 
 Ok , here you are . 
 Amy , you forgot another magic word . 
 You are very welcome . 
 To be honest , I haven't really done much research . 
 Thanks for your advice , after going through all of these materials I've decided not to go with my initial choice . 
 Hello ? Hello ? 
 Hello ? Who is calling , please ? 
 Listen , I know who you are . If you call this number again , I ’ ll call the police . You ’ ll be arrested . I ’ Ve got your number . 
 Yes , speaking . How can I help you ? 
 The requirements are strong communicational skills , management and work assiduously . And you have to handle the recurring crisis good-humoredly and discreetly . 
 Yes . We have a reservation . 
 Jack . 
 The reservation was for a double , for three nights . Wasn't it ? 
 Hi , Monica , I am afraid I can ’ t make it to the office to punch out . 
 I am still in XYZ Company , this meeting took longer than I expected . Say to it that the office manager knows I won ’ t be in to punch my card . 
 Is Alice available ? 
 I've called you a hundred times today . 
 No problem . 
 Did you want to do something tomorrow ? 
 How about a movie ? 
 Call me tomorrow then . 
 That price of ours , by the way , is for a minimum quantity of 1,000 saddles . 
 20-30 % . But we proposed the plan from the storage and delivery viewpoint . That is to say , less warehouse space and prompt delivery . 
 Sales have been exceptionally good during the past twelve months . 
 All in the local market . One or two suggestions that came in from the distribution might interest you . 
 Perhaps . General opinion is that the rear carrier should be offered as an extra . 
 Thanks . 
 Here you are , officer . 
 Yes , a camera bag , a travel bag and a suitcase . 
 No . I have only personal effects . 
 Ah , Jenny ! You remember me , what a good memory you have . 
 She's fine , thanks . Actually , she's the reason I'm here . It's our Wedding Anniversary in 2 weeks and I want to get her something special . She's been nagging me about our furniture , you see . 
 I would like to cash my undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate , please . 
 Yes , I know . But it can't be helped . It's been a pretty slow month and I just don't have enough cash to refurnish the whole house . 
 What can I help you with today ? 
 What is the problem ? 
 Do you have enough money in your account ? 
 Let me check that for you right now . 
 Apparently there is only $ 57 left in your account . 
 That ’ s what my records show . 
 Are you going to helen ’ s birthday party on Friday evening ? 
 If everyone turned up , it would be a squeeze . But a few people said that they couldn ’ t go . So I think it should be OK ? 
 I ’ Ve got her a birthday present and I ’ ll take a bottle fo wine too . 
 Helen gets on very well with her neighbors . I wouldn ’ t be surprised if they went to the party too . 
 Well , don ’ t be late . I ’ ll see you on Friday at helen ’ s . 
 Not yet , Dad . I am watching Ultraman instead.No , no , Dad . Please . This program is on only once a week . 
 What makes you think that ? 
 But there are cartoons on TV . Bees , big trees , seas , and a lot of other interesting things . 
 About 6 . 
 Dad , it's not fair . I am so disappointed with you ! 
 Nice to meet you . My name is Tyler Smith . Let's go to your office desk , follow me please . 
 Here is your working place . Nancy will come to show you how to set up the telephones . I'm going to call her now so that you can get started . Is that OK ? 
 If you have any further questions , just ask me . 
 You are welcome . Have a nice day . 
 Good morning.Could you tell me the times of trains to London , please ? 
 What time does the seven fifty-nine get to London ? 
 What about coming back ? I'd like to come back about 7 p . m . 
 Mmm , how much is it ? 
 Return , please . 
 Yes , it is . 
 Ok , thank you . By the way , could you please tell me how I can get there from A community ? 
 I got it . Thank you so much . 
 What's special for today ? 
 We'll have it for two people . 
 Here ! Here ! Use my card ! 
 Not on my life ! I'm the best man , so I pay ! 
 What's that ? 
 You've got it ! But are we coming back for the music , or for the fruit ? ! 
 It was chosen as the most popular magazine of the year . 
 As far as the language is concerned , it's worth reading . 
 That's so sweet of you . We definitely want it . 
 OK . How does seven o'clock this evening sound ? 
 What are you going to have ? 
 Can I get you anything to drink ? 
 That sounds good . I think I'll have the same . 
 What kind of bag is it ? 
 What is your room number and your name , please ? 
 Well , let me check.We delivered four bags to room 1106 , you friend's room about an hour ago . 
 You're quite welcome . 
 Yes , please . 70,000 US dollars is being transferred into our account . 
 I'm the accountant with Go Thong Computers . 
 No problem . Can I withdraw all of it now ? 
 Is this American Airlines ? 
 I need to get a flight to Chicago on the 7th in the morning . Can you give me a hand ? 
 Operator , I want to make a collect overseas phone call to Beijing . 
 Richard Zhang . 
 The code is 880 , the area code is 010 and the local number is 8824578 4 . 
 Monica Tang . 
 OK , thank you . 
 Excuse me , I'm looking for the airport bus stop . Do you know where it is ? 
 When does the bus come ? 
 How about the next one ? 
 Isn't there an earlier one ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Honey , we are all out of wine and cheese . Do you mind running to the deli and picking up a few things ? 
 Your friends and family are coming over tonight and we still need to get a lot of things . 
 OK , pick up some cured meats to go with the wine . Maybe a pound of polish sausages , ham , liverwurst , salami and any other cold cuts that are on sale . I think I saw a promotion for pastrami . Also get s 
 Never mind that.Get some dips as well . Get a jar of spinach and blue cheese dip and also some Tzatziki.If they have bean dip get that as well . Last but not least , get some pickles . 
 Very funny ! Get a move on ! People will be here any minute . 
 You know Mr . Forster , this is a really large purchase . I am afraid we can't pay off at one time . We have to pay by installment . 
 Yes , Mr.Forester . 
 We'll start our payment in half a year and the total amount will be paid off within 2 years by three installments . 
 All right . 
 Ok , let's sign it . 
 Well , I remember walking pass the baker shop . 
 I'm afraid so . I don't remember you telling me about it . 
 What would you let me do now ? 
 Really ? You are so kind . 
 No . That's not enough . I've got some cereal . 
 I enjoy listening to all kinds of music . 
 I like to listen to Rock and R & B . 
 I like the kinds of instruments that they use . 
 Thanks , I feel the same way . 
 Have you got any Chinese paintings ? 
 I'd like a flower-and-bird painting . 
 Oh , they look just like live cranes . I like this picture very much . How much is it ? 
 It's a lot of money . But the picture is excellent , I'll take it . 
 Robert is not available at the moment . 
 Around 3:30 . 
 Hold on there , Fittipaldi , first let ’ s go over things one more time . Now before you even think of starting the car , make sure your seat is at a comfortable position and you can grip the steering wheel firmly . Next check your rear view mirrors to make sure you can see properly . 
 Fine , start the car . now gently step on the clutch and shift to 1st gear . Good , now accelerate gently and let go of the clutch as you do it . There we go , good ! 
 Keep your eyes on the road ! No music ! We are coming up to a red light , step on the brakes . What are you doing ? I said the brakes ! Look out for those people ! Get off the sidewalk ! 
 It ’ s the police ! Pull over ! 
 so , are you enjoying the performance so far ? 
 I think you're being a little critical . The actor in the lead role is fantastic . I suppose the chorus could be a bit better , though . 
 actually , the woman playing Ophelia is a past classmate of mine . 
 that's only part of it . I absolutely adore this director . Every play he works on turns out great . 
 quite a few actually . By the way , after the play , there's always a big party for the cast and their friends . My friend has invited us . Do you want to go ? 
 I've never had a part in a play before , but I used to be a part of the stage crew in high school . 
 I helped build the sets and find props for the plays . What about you ? 
 why not ? 
 that sounds kind of boring . Oh , look . They're dimming the lights . I think we should get back to our seats for the second half of the play . 
 Over there in the booth . 
 For a local call , just insert 35 cents in the slot and use it in the same way as your home phone . Inquiries are free from a public phone . 
 Yes , could I settle my bill , please ? 
 Wang Wei , Room 1202 . 
 The figure seems right . 
 By credit card , please . And what kind of credit cards do you honor ? 
 Then I'll put it on my Master Card . Here you are . 
 Is that Room service ? 
 I have made a reservation for my breakfast last night . But I still haven't got it . I am so hungry now . 
 203 . 
 How do I know what forms to fill out for unemployment ? 
 How do I get the form to apply for unemployment benefits ? 
 What type of information will I have to provide to the Employment Development Office ? 
 Will they need anything else from me ? 
 What should I do after I turn in the application ? 
 Isn't this fun ? 
 Just follow the foot movements . Brush left , brush right ... yeah ! That's it ! 
 Let the men take the lead ! 
 Oops ! 
 Yes . I've had one for as long as I can remember . 
 I actually like having a curfew . I have an excuse to get to bed on time . 
 I don't like being too tired the next day . 
 If you stayed up much later , you would see that just about every-thing closes around ten anyway . 
 Sure , what kind of shoe are you looking for ? We ’ Ve got strappy sandals , sleek high heels , edgy pumps , or if you ’ re looking for something a little more practical , we ’ Ve got Mary Janes , ballerinas . 
 Ok , right this way . What color did you have in mind ? 
 Of course . We ’ Ve got this style here that is very popular . Because it ’ s an open-toe shoe , you can wear it any time of the year . They look great on everyone . 
 OK , these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two-inch heel so they are very comfortable . 
 What size ? 
 Here we are . How does it fit ? 
 Have a nice day , Ma ’ am . 
 If you'll just give me your name , phone , and date of visit , I can cancel your reservation . 
 Mr . Randolph . Okay , one second , sir , and there you go . Your reservation is now cancelled . 
 Not a problem , sir . Please remember us in the future . 
 She had a very impressive resume , but she seemed to lack the confidence that I think a good manager needs . 
 Did you notice the way that she avoided making eye contact with us while she talked ? 
 When she first walked into the room to greet us , she didn't shake our hands or introduce herself at all . I thought that was a bit unprofessional . 
 It sure would . Did you also notice the way she slouched in her chair during most of the interview ? She had horrible posture ! 
 On top of that , she didn't seem to have any sense of people's personal space.She didn't keep enough distance between us during the meeting . 
 Don't worry , we ’ ll find someone eventually ! 
 Yes , you get off at the square . 
 Well , you will get there in about half an hour if the traffic isn't too heavy . 
 Drop 50 cents in the box , please . 
 Sure . I will . 
 How much is a stamp to send a letter to France , please ? 
 Air mail , please . 
 Four stamps , please . How much is that ? 
 There you go . 
 I would like to make my plea . 
 I would like to plead not guilty . 
 I know . But I did not do it . 
 I didn ’ t commit the crime . 
 If I tell you who did , will you release me ? 
 I ’ ll tell you all you need to know . 
 I like you to come in and discuss some further tests that I would like to run . 
 For now , I would like to run a few more tests to look into some of the problems that you mentioned . 
 If there is any question about test results , we always do a recheck . 
 I would be happy to see you this afternoon . If you are feeling upset , please bring a friend or relative along . 
 Come on in this afternoon and we will talk . It will be fine ! 
 You can go to ZhongShan Park . 
 Yes . The scenery there is so breathtaking 
 Yes , of course . It's really worth visiting . 
 Yeah , time for more coffee ! 
 By the way , I heard Kitty's just got in a shipment of Jamaican Blue Mountain . 
 It's only the rarest coffee in the world ! Didn't your momma teach you anything when you were growing up ? 
 Good morning . Could you tell me the times of trains to London , please ? 
 What time does the 7 fifty-nine get to London ? 
 What about coming back ? I'd like to come back about 7 p . m . 
 Mmm , how much is it ? 
 Return , please . 
 An ordinary return , please . 
 Morning , Michael . I ’ Ve been very busy lately . One of our other vendors is going out of business and I ’ Ve been searching for a suitable replacement . 
 No , thanks . I ’ Ve been trying to cut down on the caffeine . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . The demand for phone cameras is growing , and Pear has been falling behind in the market . 
 No , we ’ re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . We were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal . 
 Excuse me , but do you have this T-shirt in size L ? 
 Too bad . I really like it . 
 Do you have it in size L ? 
 Where is the fitting room ? 
 Thanks . 
 It is ' www . job . com ' 
 No . I can text the address to you if you are not clear about it 
 Is dinner served ? 
 Please give me some chicken . 
 Thank you , you are so thoughtful . I think I could use some beers right now . 
 This job is more challenging and I have longed to be a translator . That ’ s why I came here for an interview . 
 I think one needs common knowledge , specific knowledge , and professional codes to be a successful translator . 
 I think I am very good at planning . I manage my time well so that I can always get things done on time . 
 I always give each job my best efforts , so when others are not pulling their weight , I am frustrated . 
 I got the Scientific Research Prize from the Gansu government for my achievements in the Northwest Regional Economy Development Research Project . 
 Working under pressure is exciting and challenging . I don ’ t mind . In fact , I am very efficient when certain pressure is exerted on the work . 
 There was a time when both the clerical assistant and the secretary resigned at the same time . I then had to handle their work temporarily . The workload was incredibly heavy . So I started to set priorities for the jobs and hired part-time staff to handle routine work . Finally , I managed to keep the operation smooth until we found someone to fill the vacancy . 
 I stick to my principles and keep to the rules . Sometimes , they just lack enthusiasm and I get them involved with something constructive . Some of them change their attitude later . 
 I'd like to pay this cash into my account please . I usually do it at the machine , but the queue is very long today . 
 I see . Here's my Bank Book . 
 Thanks . 
 Yes , it is very expensive . Maybe we shouldn't have come here . 
 I think we might not see any . 
 I thought it was O . K . But it really was too hot.And I think they should show people more . The exhibits should be more interesting . 
 Yes , but I still think it could be better . 
 There is no one here by that name . 
 No , this is 2517759 . 
 That's all right . 
 yes , I can still recall the days when we were all seniors at college . I asked you whether you would go back to your hometown or not . 
 congratulations ! I hope when you hold the wedding ceremony , I ’ m still residing in Beijing . 
 no , I ’ m planning to quit this job and go back to work in my hometown after the spring festival . 
 well , I still can ’ t adjust to the fast pace of city life . 
 that ’ s right . I work extremely hard , and try my best to adapt to the lifestyle here , but I don ’ t feel any sense of belonging here . 
 yeah , I think so . 
 Yeah , who ’ s calling ? 
 Fantastic ! I can ’ t believe it ! That ’ s the biggest account we ’ Ve gotten so far !

 They're quite complex machines and they have a lot of different components . We need to check the metal casing regularly for any signs of corrosion . We also check the brushes once a fortnight to make sure they aren't worn down . It's important to make sure everything is properly aligned and we adjust it if necessary . There is a canvas belt at the end of the assembly line . If it gets wet , it might rot so we check that regularly too .

 Though our company doesn ’ t have a return policy , limiting the personal use of internet , I don ’ t think the boss will like us to do that .

 good morning . I understand that you ’ Ve got a problem with your washing machine . I ’ m from the repair company . 
 when did it first break down ? 
 is it still under warranty . If it is and I can ’ t fix it , it would be quicker and easier to exchange it for a new one . 
 ok . I ’ ll start by looking at the motor . I ’ ll just unplug it and take a look inside the machine ... oh , yes . There ’ s the problem . It ’ s quite simple . I ’ ll sort it out in a few minutes . 
 part of the motor is loose . I can put it back in place quite easily . 
 Good day to you . How can we assist you today ?

 Would you like a dessert ? 
 Lemon pie , hot cake in syrup , chocolate sundae and custard pudding .

 What should I do now ? 
 Ur , it stinks !

 Well , the free stuff ! You know the soap , lotion , shampoo , etc .

 So when will it be here then ? 
 Never ? 
 Willy , I don't think we have much butter . Can you buy some ? 
 Here's the money.And get some salt . 
 This apartment is great , but could I upgrade a few things ? 
 I want to have a different color carpet . 
 Would it cost a lot more ? 
 I was also wondering if it would be possible to pick a different paint color .

 Let me see it . 
 David Hall , 83 , Bridge Street . 
 Here you are .

 Advance Reservations . Can I help you ? 
 Could you tell me your name , sir , please ? 
 Hi , Mr . Smith . I ’ m Dr . Hawkins . Why are you here today ? 
 Yes , well you haven ’ t had one for ... five years . You should have one every year . 
 Well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . So , try to come at least once a year for your own good . 
 Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ? 
 Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . You really should quit . 
 Well , we have classes and some medications that might help . I ’ ll give you more information before you leave . 
 Sorry to bother you sir , but I have some bad news . 
 Well , the stock market just took a huge plunge and we ’ Ve lost a lot of money ! 
 There are many factors that weigh in , but NASDAQ is down 200 points , the DOW JONES indicator also suffered ! Our portfolio is worth half of what it was worth points week ago . 
 I know sir ! We didn ’ t expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden . On the other hand , you still have some high yield trash bonds and government bonds that will give us enough liquidity to cut our loses and reinvest in emerging markets . We could potentially make this tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box . 
 What do you do in your spare times ? 
 What sports do you like best ? 
 Do you like reading books ?

 Thank you for your interview with me . 
 What's the problem ? 
 I apologize , but the cable has been down lately .

 Since it's not working , I'm going to give you a credit . 
 You won't pay anything until your cable starts working again .

 Meat , I think . 
 I do , but I want meat . 
 Yes , but I prefer red wine with meat . 
 I just want to have a coffee , I think . 
 No , I haven't . 
 Did you really ? 
 Well , congratulations . 
 I'm so happy for you . 
 Yes . You really deserved this . 
 Yes . Good for you . 
 Sure . If you want to stretch your legs , a good exercise is to lift your knee in front of your body , like this . It ’ s a very simple exercise , but very effective . 
 One good way is to do push-ups . Another way is to use weights . Make sure you grip the weights firmly . You don ’ t want to drop them on your feet ! 
 You don ’ t need to bend your elbows that much . Bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle . The most important thing is to remember to keep your body straight . Many people bend the 
 One that I recommend is that you lie on your back . You should have a weight in each hand and stretch your arms out side of your body . 
 Yes , you do . Lift the weight up , keeping your arms straight all the time . 
 Hey , Mary . Dress warmly for today . 
 Looks can be deceiving .

 Do you want beef or lamb ? 
 This lamb's very good . 
 What about some steak ? This is a nice piece . 
 Do you want a chicken , Mrs Bird ? They're very nice . 
 To tell you the truth Mrs . Bird , I don't like chicken , either ! 
 Sure.It ' s just right . 
 No ! It's a perfect fit !

 Thirteen . 
 About 158cm . He likes to wear loose-fitting sweaters . 
 I don't think he'll like it . He prefers simple styles . 
 The style is all right , but I'm not sure about the color . Let me think for a while . 
 Left for the fork and right for the knife . Just remember that the stronger one is for knife . 
 Sure . Rather than eating , having western food is more about western culture . 
 Cindy has reserved a table for us at a newly opened western restaurant downtown . She said the environment there was really pleasant . 
 You should put on the black suit I bought for you last week . But I'm afraid it may be a bit crumpled . You'd better iron it now . 
 There is no need to do that . I think the restaurant accepts credit cards . But it's necessary to make a budget . 
 It seems that it's all about me . Then what do you do ? 
 OK then . Well , 50 Yuan for appetizer , 200 Yuan for dinner and 200 Yuan for wine . Anything else ? 
 OK , then 50 Yuan for dessert . 500 Yuan all together . 
 OK , I will fetch the remote control . 
 Yes . Here you are . 
 We can pig out on potato chips and cookies . They are very cheap . 
 Really ? Where did you hear that ? 
 I'm not sure ... well , first , it couldn't be George . He is such a kiss-ass . He'd wash the boss's dog if he asked . 
 That's true . What about Lisa ? I bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her . 
 Well , okay . Then there is still Michael . But he's the boss ' pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . It definitely won't be Michael . 
 Well , it could be me too . But I am not too worried . This place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hard-ass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . It would almost be a blessing to be fired from this place . 
 You should try to put your best foot forward , and be careful of your personal appearance . At least you should get yourself dressed up . Appearance isnt everything , but it's the first thing an interviewer notices about you . 
 Don ’ t boast and don ’ t be modest . 
 Appear confident and show the interviewers that you ’ re competent . Don ’ t exaggerate things or you'll give the impression that you ’ re talking big . 
 Try to be natural , alert and interested . 
 My pleasure . Good luck to you . 
 What ’ s wrong ? I thought everything was set . 
 Maybe we could work out an overtime schedule . It ’ s definitely worth it to finish by the twentieth . 
 Quite well . I made good records in college . I won the scholarship in every semester . 
 Yes , I had taken finance courses in a training school . Compound talents are needed in the society and I must study continually to keep abreast with the times . 
 $ 1 . You can get your photos instantly . 
 No problem . Say ' cheese ' . That's good . Please wait a moment . 
 Can I sign up for some classes today ? 
 I would like to take a driver's course . 
 Why do I need an appointment ? 
 Can I do that right now ? 
 How about 9 o'clock tomorrow morning ? 
 Thanks for all your help . 
 It's a special green tea named Longing Tea from Zhejiang province . 
 You can see that it keeps the original color of the tea leaves very well . 
 Probably . I love green tea . It's one of my daily necessities . 
 Not really . But I really love to have after-meal tea . 
 There are a lot of them . In hot or warm days , tea helps to dispel the heat and brings on an instant cool with a feeling of relaxation . Moreover , the tea leaves contain a number of chemicals which are good for people's health . 
 No . Constant drinking of over-strong tea would do harm to people's health . So don't make your tea too strong . 
 It's fine for most time of the day . But don't have tea before bedtime . 
 It will give rise to occasional insomnia . OK , let's enjoy the tea before it gets cold . 
 Yes , here you go . 
 Yes , I ’ d like to check three pieces . 
 What ? Why ! I am taking an intercontinental flight ! I ’ m flying sixteen thousand CMS ! How am I supposed to only take two , twenty kilo bags ? That ’ absurd ! 
 Now I see . You charge next to nothing for an international ticket , but when it comes to charging for any other small thing , you charge an arm and a leg ! So tell me , miss , how much will I have to pay for all of this . 
 That ’ s more than my round-trip ticket ! 
 Yes , they are our main export bases of tools with the advantage of having good production experience and long historical record . All their products enjoy high prestige in the world market .

 Yes , we can pack the goods according to your instructions . 
 All right . We'll make the shipment as soon as your L / C is on hand . 
 Sure . What is it ? 
 Sure . Will you be long ? 
 Go ahead . It will be safe with me . 
 I don't think I'm going to get one . 
 It's just a waste of cash , man ! 
 Oh , really ? 
 Really ? 
 That sounds like a good deal . 
 I will . 
 I sure did . 
 I was in the bank at the time . 
 I saw the guy come in with a gun . 
 He was wearing a mask . 
 He came in alone . 
 That'll be fine . 
 Oh , Henry , I haven't seen you for ages . Come in . Let me take your coat . How are you getting along ? 
 Please take a seat . Everything would be ready in a minute . 
 Here you are . Here you go . We have cocktail and salad , fried chicken , French fries and icecream for dessert . Eating chicken while it's hot . it tastes better . 
 Here you are . Taste the French fries . 
 Would you like some more ? 
 Here is to our friendship and health ! 
 I think that I would enjoy living here , but I would like to make improvements . 
 I think that it would look better with a better quality carpet . 
 How much more would it cost to upgrade ? 
 Do you think that I could have a different paint color in my apartment ? 
 How long will it take for my new apartment to be ready ?

 Yes . What can I do for you ? 
 What ? I can barely hear you because your veiled voice ? 
 The fried shrimp is crunchy ! But my mom will never cook shrimp this way . She always says that fried food is not healthy . 
 She often cooks it in a large pan of boiling water . 
 My mom says it has a lot of fat . I also suggest you do not eat so many fried things . 
 Really ? I really want to have a try ! 
 That sounds like a good idea ! But I'm afraid my mom will be angry about it . 
 Can you believe this ? I locked my keys in the car , and I have to go to the airport to pick up my aunt . 
 I don't know ... Hey , do you think I could borrow your car for a few hours ? 
 Well , could you drive me home ? I have spare keys there .

 I stayed at Bob's last night . 
 I guess I should have told you . 
 It ’ s freezing in here ! Can I turn up the heat ? 
 Dad ! Are you serious ? What ’ s the point of having central heating if we can ’ t use it ! Look , I can see my breath ! 
 Dad ! I ’ m gonna catch a cold ! 
 I'd like to send this to Chicago . 
 Air mail , please . 
 Make it special delivery , please . 
 Which type of telephone bill would you like to pay today ? 
 I'll need your Bank Card , please . Your Bank Book is required for over the counter services ; with the ATM you just need to have your card . 
 Well , that is easy ! It sure beats waiting in line for ages waiting to deal with a real person ! 
 What's the hardware ? 
 That's seems obvious enough . Then what about the software ? 
 I see , actually the hardware is the easy part , I do want to study how to use the software . 
 Ever since I saw computer can do your project , I wanted to have a computer . 
 What do you need ? 
 Right now the cable isn't working . 
 The cable should be running again in a couple of days . 
 We'll just give you a credit for the inconvenience . 
 It'll be free until it comes back on . 
 Thank you for all your patience . 
 Well , it is hard to say . At least you need to come up with a good reason . 
 Yes , you should be there . Go find the manager and ask . I think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . Don ’ t forget to fill in the leave application form . It will be signed by the manager for approval . 
 Hello . 
 I'm sorry . He's not here right now . 
 Around five thirty . 
 Yes . May I ask who's calling ? 
 Okay . I'll tell him you called . 
 Hi , I would like to purchase a one way ticket to Brussels , please . 
 How long does it take to get there ? 
 Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time ! 
 Great ! I ’ ll take it . 
 I understand . Thank you very much ! 
 Hi , is this the Bread and Cheese Deli ? 
 I need to place an order for a couple of sandwiches and drinks . Can you deliver ? 
 How big is this parking lot in our community ? 
 So you guys should be always busy . 
 I bet it is always full of cars . 
 Ah ... I see . 
 What is the hourly rate for a car like this ? 
 How mush would it cost if someone parks here for one hour and ten minutes ? 
 That's expensive . 
 Get in slowly , sweetie . You'll get used to it . I'm gonna go and make you some chicken soup . 
 I know you don't have an appetite , but you need to eat something . You'll get too weak if you don't eat . 
 That's a good sign . But just soak a little longer , OK ? 
 Really ? You're joking . 
 I'd like that . Alright , put on this apron first . 
 Hmm , let me see ... Boil some water . 
 Not bad . Okay , now take some meat and potatoes from the fridge . 
 Three . And bring four bell peppers . 
 Now wash them , then dice the potatoes and bell peppers . 
 Dad , how do you say this word ? 
 What does this word mean ? 
 Dad , can you just tell me what it means ? I'm too lazy . 
 Hello again ! Here's another fruit tray for you . 
 I make each one a little different . It's a way for me to express my creativity ! 
 Oh , look at your table ! I'll help you clear it off . 
 Enjoy your food ! Bye ! 
 Oh no ! Evaluations ! You can tell that's not my favorite job ; I haven't even started yet . When is the deadline for turning in thecompleted forms ? 
 I never know how to rate the employees ' work . Of course attendance and productivity are easy , I just look at the sales figures . 
 Exactly ! Attitude ... how do you rate attitude ? 
 Great idea . And after all , that's the whole point of an evaluation . I almost can't wait to give it a try . 
 Hi , Jimmy , good morning . 
 I see . 
 Maybe that is true . But I am a fast learner and I am willing to work overtime , and I do not mind a lot of business travel . 
 Can't you give me another chance and reconsider your decision ? 
 Possibly you are now . But in case you will change your mind , please let me know . 
 Check out , sir ? 
 No problem.How would you like to pay ? 
 How do you want to advertise the opening ? 
 All right . I suggest posting the ad Monday through Friday . 
 And job seekers will certainly check the paper over on Tuesday . 
 Such concern for the company , Craig ! I'm impressed . 
 Would you please tell me what places are worth visiting ? 
 Could you come and help me mend the computer , Neel ? 
 I can't log on the internet again . 
 No , never . 
 I don't have this kind of software . 
 We're broke . 
 How do you like you trip ? 
 That's interesting . I will go with you . 
 Don't worry . There are so many people . We will join the touring party . 
 Is this the right bus for the Grand Hotel ? 
 Where can I take it ? 
 Excuse me , could you help me ? 
 Well . I was wondering if anyone has turned in a passport ? 
 I think so . I can't find it anywhere in my hotel room and I remember the last place I used it yesterday was in this department store . 
 In the shoe department . I had to show it to pay for these shoes with my traveler's cheques . 
 Then what shall I do ? 
 You are right . Do you have a pen ? 
 Oh , I seem to lose something every time I travel . 
 Sure . It is helpful to shorten the distance between you and the interviewer and create a lively atmosphere . 
 But you should pay special attention to your words and attitudes . 
 In the interview , use polite words , such as ' Thank you ' , or ' Please ' . 
 When talking you should focus your eyes on the interviewer in order to closely watch his or her expressions . 
 Whatever the result is , you should keep your good demeanor . 
 In short , you should present the best of yourself throughout the interview . 
 I think he hasn't made any new friends yet . He's just a little lonely . 
 Without a doubt . Maybe if he knew he doesn't have to give up any of his old friends to make new ones , it will be easier for him . 
 Well , we can help him keep in touch with his old friends . 
 Yeah . There's a lot we can do to help him through this transition . 
 It looks like it was made just for you . 
 How would you like to pay for it ? 
 Now , if you'll just sign here . 
 So long . Have a nice weekend . 
 Yes , I'm Jame , your neighbor when you lived in here last year . 
 Me too . 
 Turn left at the second light and then go straight for two blocks . 
 No . It's only a five-minute walk . You can't miss it . 
 You're welcome . 
 good morning , Nathaniel . This is Leah calling from the International Student Office . 
 the reason I'm calling is because Ms . Collins will not be able to call you back until next week . 
 she's terribly sorry about that . She had to leave the office suddenly and won't be able to return until next week . She hopes you understand . 
 she asked me to call you to book an appointment with someone else today . When are you free today ? 
 Mr . Liu is available at 2:15 today . Will that work for you ? 
 I'm afraid she isn't available this afternoon . She has an opening at 11:30 this morning . Will that work for you ? 
 ok , we'll be expecting you at 11:30 . See you then . 
 Hello . Yes , I'm here to redeem a Treasury Note . It's not at the maturity date yet , but it is an emergency . 
 There you are . As you can see , the maturity isn't up yet . 
 Oh , really ? No , I wasn't aware of that . 
 Come in and sit down , Jack.Now , what's the trouble ? 
 I see.When did it start ? 
 Have you got a temperature ? 
 Let's see.Yes.You ' Ve got quite a high temperature . 
 Hm .. I think you ' Ve got the flu . 
 No , not at all , but you must stay in bed for three days and take this medicine . 
 Three times a day after meals . 
 We are interested in placing a large order for your wool carpet . 
 10,000 sq . m . You should give us a discount for such a large quantity . 
 The Iranians will give us a 10 % discount if such a high order is placed with them . No doubt you know an incentive discount encourages the buyers and helps expand seller's business . 
 I have been washing the dishes for over a week now . 
 No . We made an agreement that we would take turns doing the dishes . Now it's your turn to do them . 
 Any new ideas on the Mr . Fro case ? How can we give this motor oil a new brand identity ? 
 I could use one , too . I'm still burnt out from that last cigarette ad campaign . 
 Excuse me . Are these chips on sale ? 
 Is there any limit ? 
 That ’ s good . Thanks . 
 There's a major problem with room 507 . 
 This room is overrun with cockroaches . 
 I stopped counting at nine . 
 Your inspector needs spectacles . The fact is that cockroaches are running rampant . 
 Can you help me please ? 
 Do you know if there is Japanese restaurant near the hotel ? 
 Is it far ? 
 Good morning . I want to deposit 3,000 yuan in your bank . 
 No , I haven't . It is the first time for me to come to deposit money here . 
 Two years , please . 
 OK . What should I do if I want to draw my money before maturity date for an urgent use ? 
 I see . By the way , what if I forget to cash my money when the maturity comes ? 
 I see . 
 Thank you . How much is it ? 
 Here ’ s 30 yuan . 
 Excuse me , which way is to the post office ? 
 Well , thanks anyway . 
 This is he . What can I do for you ? 
 It's still available . Do you want to see it ? 
 Does today at 6 p . m . sound okay to you ? 
 Okay , I'll see you at 6 o'clock . Do you need any directions ? 
 I'll have an application form with me . You can fill it out if you're interested . 
 No . I only need to check your driver's license . 
 I haven ’ t been able to get a good night ’ s sleep lately . I ’ m exhausted ! 
 I try to go to sleep , but I just can ’ t stay asleep . 
 I go to bed when I finish my work . 
 I am worried about how I am going to pay my tuition . 
 Doing something relaxing before I go to sleep sounds like a plan . 
 I was supposed to do that ? I thought Sharon was responsible for that . 
 I ’ m really sorry , Mr . Samuel . I really don ’ t remember that . 
 We submitted two designs to our buyers , this one and one with the mug indented to form a grip . They chose this one . 
 No , this type cleans better , no crevices between the body and handle joint . 
 We can make shipment within one month from receipt of order . 
 We do a fair amount in tiles and in insulators for electrical appliances . But kitchenware and tableware are our mainlines . 
 Morning , Tom . 
 You seem to be in a hurry . 
 Okay . I won ’ t hold you up then . 
 See you later . 
 I have eight years of experience working in the IT industry . For the past two years , I have been working as a project manager for a dotcom . I am also MI certified . I'm looking for a team environment where I can join the excitement of building a company . 
 I have worked on a variety of projects and jobs in the high tech industry . I wanted to have the experience of working for a dotcom and have learned something about being in on the ground floor of a business . 
 I've been searching for a while now to find a company that had a business model and corporate philosophy like yours . I am interested in working for a company that provides products and services to the K - 12 education market . My background is in this field , and my strength is in building relationships and solving problems . I am excited and interested in the idea of developing business relationships through e-commerce . 
 To have a combination of technical and business knowledge and to be very results-oriented . My past record shows that I have those qualities and more . Because of my business acumen and technical know-how , the teams I have managed accomplished outstanding results , including booking more than $ 50 million in online revenue . 
 When I have a specific project to complete , I like to know the specifics of a project from beginning to end . I like definite deadlines and I like to meet those deadlines . I expect some deviation from the original plan , but I try to stay focused and not let myself drift too far . I have great attention to detail and like to take my time and do it right the first time . 
 I've set some goals for myself and my career , and unfortunately I'm at a standstill in my current situation . I have begun to explore options available before I spend too much time in a job where I can't advance . My goal is to continue to take on new responsibilities and be a key contributor to the success of an online venture . 
 I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . I'd like to postpone that discussion until later . 
 Yes , I do . Who are your financial backers ? Who are the key competitors ? Does the company have a plan for the IPO ? What would you say is the best thing about your product or service ? 
 I have made a reservation for this Sunday . My name is Bobby 
 I am calling to cancel it now . I can't go to your city this week . 
 Thank you . 
 Take me to the airport , please . 
 I have to be there before 1700 . 
 There's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time . 
 Here's twenty dollars . 
 No.If you can't break it , keep the change.But can you give me a receipt ? 
 What are you doing , Steven ? 
 What will you bring along when traveling ? 
 Have you packed the camera yet ? 
 Pack some necessary medicine in your carry-on . 
 Is this taxi taken ? 
 Please take me to this address . 
 Jessie , I ’ m afraid I can ’ t come back home for dinner tonight . 
 I ’ m sorry . Our company has just opened . There are always too many things to handle . You know that . 
 I apologize . You have my word , I ’ ll spend some time with you on the weekend . I promise . 
 Thank you for understanding . I promise I ’ ll make it up to you . 
 It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld . 
 Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ? 
 I've had that problem too many times . So I learned to save.When I'm writing something , I save every three sentences or so . I don't want to lose anything . 
 What are we going to do now ? 
 I wonder how much of the city is down . 
 Maybe . But if there's a blackout , probably the pubs are closed.And besides , I know you have a political science exam tomorrow . I thought you had a lot of reading to do . 
 I have a flashlight in my closet . If you want to use that to read , you can . 
 I like your idea of getting a beer . I think I'll go out myself . 
 No , it just won't work.If I read for your exam , you won't know the answers tomorrow . I will . 
 How many students are in the class ? 
 So it won't work , old buddy . They'll see that I'm not you . Sorry . 
 Here's our sample room . 
 Yes . We are exporting a wide range of foodstuffs to many countries . And the demand is getting greater and greater.By the way , which items are you interested in ? 
 Yes . This way , please . Our shortbread is in a variety of flavors , such as almond , walnut , lotus seed , etc . And different packaging has different weights . We can make packages within a reasonable range of any size you require . 
 You are welcome to have a try . Here it is . Ours is of prime quality . 
 What happened to your car ? 
 Are they going to pay you for the damages ? 
 What the hell . That doesn't make sense . What are you going to do ? 
 That sucks . I'd be pissed if that happened to me . 
 Oh my gosh . Damn ... screw the court , I would burn down their store . 
 Can you pick up some things from the store for me ? 
 I need a few things , I'll give you the list . 
 Everything I need is on the list . 
 Since you asked , would you pick up my medicine from the pharmacy ? 
 I believe so . 
 I really appreciate you doing this for me . 
 Hi , boss . You wanted to see me ? 
 Excuse me ? I hope I didn't just hear what I think I just heard . 
 You're going to make me rich by not paying me ? 
 I use it almost every day , but I usually only use it to check my email . I don ’ t often surf the net . You use the internet a lot , don ’ t you ? 
 So , you ’ re online eight hours a day . 
 How useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ? 
 How do you solve the website problems when you ’ re buying something online ? 
 What's your favorite movie ? 
 Oh , why is that ? 
 That's true . It is a very funny movie . 
 Yes , I saw that movie the first day it came out in theaters . 
 Me too . That movie brought tears to my eyes . 
 I have it on DVD at my house if you want to come over and watch it . 
 Are you through with your meal ? 
 Here is your bill . 150 yuan in all . 
 No , I'm sorry we don't . We accept credit cards and cash . 
 OK . ( A few minutes later ) Sorry to keep you waiting . Here is your change . 
 My pleasure . Welcome to our restaurant next time . 
 That's a good idea . Do you know how to write an introductory letter ? 
 I just know a little . First you need to include your basic information , such as your name , age , gender and major , etc . 
 I think the most important is that you need to show the employer that you are qualified for that job . 
 Yes , thus the employer can know you very well , and then decide whether you are the right person . 
 I wish you good luck ! 
 OK , I'm sorry it took so long . 
 The phone has been ringing off the hook today . 
 Do you have any plans for dinner tonight ? 
 I was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . What do you think ? 
 I could teach you how to cook something healthy . Frozen pizza are so bad for you ! 
 I recently saw a recipe for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . Maybe we could try that ? 
 I bought all the ingredients this morning , so let's start ! 
 first , you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces . 
 Yes . Once it gets hot , put a little oil in it , add the vegetables and stir-fry them for a few minutes . 
 That needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stir-fried on its own until its cooked through . 
 I'll prepare that . Do you prefer white rice or brown rice ? 
 Manhattan Square , please . 
 I'd like to go around the city , if you don't mind . 
 I don't think we can make it . 
 By the middle of October . 
 Well , considering our long standing good business relationship , we'll try hard to negotiate with our manufacturers for an earlier delivery . 
 Let me see . Now the workers will have to work on three shifts for it . Well , we can manage it on 20th September . That's the best we can do . 
 What do you think of the acting of the two main actors in the film ? 
 Well , I'm afraid not . I think the hero has much more to be believed in . 
 Hello . I've been told to come in and see someone about my L / C . I just had a message to come in and see someone called Kristy . 
 I received a letter asking me to come in and see you . I'm Mr Simons from Dalton's Electrics . 
 Oh dear ! Where should I go from here ? 
 What would you like to drink ? 
 Wouldn't you like something to eat ? 
 Right . I'll see if I can catch the waitress's eye . 
 I take it you've done this before ? 
 Good . 
 Yes . I'd like to check in , please . 
 Sure . Here they are . 
 What's the weight limit ? 
 I hope my baggage aren't overweight . 
 May I carry this satchel ? 
 OK . 
 Which gate ? 
 Thank you . 
 I'm afraid not . Why don't you call the Help Desk ? Someone there will be able to help you . 
 I would like to order some internet today . 
 What kind of internet is there ? 
 Which of those two is best ? 
 So that one better ? 
 What do you mean by that ? 
 So then I can't use my phone if I'm on the internet ? 
 Hi there . How can I help ? 
 I see . And your company has a Wage Distribution Service Agreement with us ? 
 Yes , that's a Current-all-in-one Passbook . That's what you need to get your salary . 
 I'd be happy to help you . Name it . 
 Sure , no problem . Do you want me to edit it for you ? 
 Oh , its nothing . 
 Yes , I was . I was almost an hour late . 
 I said I was terribly sorry . But he said it was quite all right . 
 No , he didn't scold me because he was late , too . 
 Is Petti there ? 
 Wrong number ? Are you sure ? I called yesterday and she was there . 
 That's impossible . I remember the number clearly . Isn't this 763-4565 ? 
 Really ? I ' m so sorry I bothered you . I ' ll try again . 
 Yeah . I guess it does . Sorry again for bothering you . 
 I would like to check out now.My room number is 712 . 
 Do you accept traveler's checks ? 
 Here you are . 
 Well in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing . The news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises around 80 staff . 
 Well , as you know Rebecca , in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . You could be on call at any time . We do have to work very unsociable hours at times . 
 Good , as long as you understand that . 
 Yesterday ! But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month . 
 First National Bank . 
 How can I help you ? 
 What's your name and account number ? 
 When can I go to see him ? 
 OK . 
 Well , there are two Hilton Hotels around here . Which one is your destination ? 
 Then , it would be a little bit harder to find out your way . Do you remember the name of the street , or one or two landmarks ? 
 Good , any other clues ? 
 Oh , is there a bank near there , Standard Charted possibly ? 
 That's the second branch hotel of Hilton . Walk straight down and you will see the bookstore you just mentioned . Turn left , I believe , you will get it . 
 Hi , can I help you ? 
 All right . If you need any help , just let me know . My name is Greg . 
 Did you find something you like ? 
 You are right . This is very good brand . It doesn't sag easily and we offer a lifetime warranty , so you don't have to worry about its quality . 
 Unfortunately , it doesn't . However we can give you a 10 % discount on the frame . We also offer a very good financing plan . There is no payment no interest until next June . 
 Oh ! My mouth is on fire ! 
 I need more water ! 
 It's your fault for mixing the two broths ! 
 Excuse me ? How can I get to the nearest branch of the national bank ? 
 How far up the street are the traffic lights ? 
 Ok . So I turn right at the traffic lights . Then ? 
 Ok . Where do I go then ? 
 God it . Thans very much . 
 We can figure that out right now . How much do you earn annually ? 
 How many years have you held your current position ? 
 Is there any extra income that you receive other than salary ? 
 Have you ever figured out your credit score ? 
 Adding in your expenses , I calculate that you can spend three hundred thousand on a house . 
 Well , it has a lithium battery that lasts for 24 hours and it has a 160 second anti-skip mode for when you're playing sports . 
 Using MP3 mode , you can download about 10 hours of music from either your CD player , or your computer's hard disk onto one mini-disk . 
 You can choose from several play modes , or you can use the full-spectrum equalization , 3 D mode and Mega Bass features . We rec-ommend using it with the studio monitor headphones . 
 It's ultra-compact , it has a brushed , titanium metal body and a rubber shock-proof , weather-proof case with a belt clip . 
 Sure . 
 Any time is all right , except Sunday . 
 OK . I'll tell her . 
 Don't worry . No big deal . Just a common cold . 
 No . You can never count on the grown-ups when there is something . 
 Come on , sister . This is the seventh glass already . 
 Do we ? Where is it ? 
 Be careful . Now I have no one but you to depend on . 
 What's the new strike ? 
 Poor me ! 
 Great . Are you a qualified teacher ? 
 What kind of teaching certificate do you have ? 
 How many years of experience do you have ? 
 When did you get your TEFL certificate ? 
 Why do you want to teach at our school ? 
 That ’ s great . Can you speak Chinese ? 
 Can you come in for an interview tomorrow at 10 ? 
 Great . See you then . 
 Don't worry about such problems . We can deal with them for you . Other questions ? 
 You are welcome . 
 I am glad that you have been happy with my performance . 
 Does this title come with an increase in salary ? 
 Can you give me the specifics ? 
 That sounds fair . 
 I can believe it , and I am very excited about it . 
 Of course I did . Didn ’ t you ? 
 I have total faith in Obama as our President . 
 Yeah . I have faith that he will help America turn over a new leaf . 
 I believe that change has already begun . 
 I no longer need to worry about what will happen with this country . 
 Yes , Jason , right ? Nice to meet you . Welcome to Taiwan . 
 You had a long flight , you must be tired . 
 Oh , sorry to hear that . But , don worry ! Taiwan has plenty of great things to eat . First , lets get you to the hotel . 
 My car is in the parking lot , lets go this way . Let me help you with your bags . 
 Hey doc . Well , I think I might need glasses . I ’ m getting headaches , and I really struggle to see things that are far away . But I have always had 20/20 vision . 
 Mmm .. . X , E , R , 3 , a question mark , and I can ’ t quite make out the other symbol but I think it ’ s the peace sign . 
 Yeah , I know , my vision is really blurry at times . 
 Thanks doc ! 
 Did you need help with something ? 
 I can help you with that . 
 I work here . 
 May I see your ID ? 
 All right , here is your ballot card . 
 Go to a voting booth and vote . 
 Are you looking for shoes ? 
 What about this brown one ? 
 Hello , who is speaking , please ? 
 Oh , good . Let me get a pencil and take down the information . Well , go ahead , please . 
 What time does it leave ? 
 That is good . 
 That's right . 
 Those are in the non-smoking section , aren't they ? 
 Fine , thank you very much . 
 Sure . They are my kids , Alex and Kathy Stern . 
 Thanks . 
 And that is ? 
 I'm afraid we can't agree to that . We concluded the business with you here in Houston , and the goods you ordered are manufactured in New York . We wish to point out that all orders accepted by us are shipped from New York or Seattle . Hong Kong is out of the question . 
 I see . You want to have your goods shipped from New York to Osaka via Hong Kong , where they can be transshipped . Is that the idea ? 
 Your idea may be a good one , but the trouble is that there are risks of pilferage or damage to the goods during transshipment at Hong Kong . How about shipping them from Seattle instead of network ? You may choose either one as port of shipment . It makes no difference to us . There are more sailings from Seattle than from New York . 
 We'll try our best . Anyway , we assure you that shipment will be made not later than the first half of April . 
 You mean for this afternoon ’ s meeting ? 
 That ’ s quite a while . Let ’ s make it the week after you get back , then . 
 No problem at all . To tell you the truth , I could use the extra time in my schedule to catch up on some paperwork . 
 Certainly . ( Take a table-cloth to her ) 
 A table-cloth of this size and style is 15 Yuan . 
 If you take good care of it , it will last you quite a number of years . 
 I'm planning to buy a bicycle . As you are quite a cycling enthusiast , I wish you might give me some advice . 
 My purposes are two-fold . On the one hand , I've grown bored of commuting on suffocating buses every day and decided to ride to work . On the other hand , bicycling is a sport , and I intend to build up my body through constantly taking a ride over the weekends . 
 Does that make any difference ? 
 Are they designed differently ? 
 I would like to pick a time to look at houses with you . 
 It is easier for me to take off work in the afternoon . 
 Because of work , I can only go look at houses on the weekend . 
 If you could pick me up at home , that would be great . 
 That might be a little too much , but we ’ ll see how it goes . 
 Mrs . Lee , I ’ Ve stayed here for almost a week . And I really must leave tomorrow . 
 Thank you . You ’ Ve been so nice to me . 
 No , thanks . You ’ Ve done a lot for me already . Thank you for everything . 
 Mr . Black ? I'm from the Pacific Mechanical Company . 
 Thank you . 
 For wood or for metal ? 
 Yes , we have a showroom not far away from here , Mr . Black . Are you free now ? 
 Fine . Then , shall we go right away ? I have a car outside . 
 Take your time , sir . I can wait . 
 The radio said it's OK on this road . 
 We have too many cars ! 
 OK , do you want us to use starch ? 
 Yeah , sir . Your shirt will be ready by Thursday morning . Anything else ? 
 No problem , sir . 
 We'll remain open from 9 a . m . till 8 p . m . 
 Here's your laundry ticket , sir . 
 Hello . Is this Ann ? 
 Yes , it's me . 
 No . Worse than that . I have a flu . I'm in bed with a fever . 
 I'd like to do it , of course . But I just can't . I'm afraid I'd fall down in the middle of it . 
 Why not just tell him I'm sick ? I'll ring him myself this afternoon . 
 Not yet . I feel too lousy to go out.Anyway , I have a flu . I know what it is . I don't need a doctor to tell me that . 
 I'm not sure yet.Maybe this will all be gone in a day . So it's probably better if you don't call off my appointments . I will call you later this afternoon and tell you what I think . 
 Yes , that's what I plan to do . Except I won't make the chicken soup.Right now I don't think I could swallow more than a spoonful of it . 
 Yeah , I'm very nauseous . It's mostly nausea and a fever . 
 Thanks , Ann . Talk to you this afternoon . 
 I don't have any more cash , and I have to get on another bus to get home . 
 I wanted some chips at lunch today , so I spent it . 
 I know.Do you have some change I can borrow ? 
 I need to get home . 
 I don't have money for a transfer . 
 Really ? oh ! I'm glad you let me know . 
 We're going to have to postpone the meeting . 
 Mr . Chen can't make it today . 
 Yes , he's holding a bunch of books . 
 Do you know what you're going to do this weekend ? 
 I don't know . 
 Do you know what movie you're going to watch ? 
 None that I can think of . 
 Thank you for inviting me , but I think I'll pass . 
 What is this ? I didn't order that . 
 I've ordered savory pork and coleslaw . 
 Hey ! What is this ? 
 Oh , Is that what this is ? 
 No , don't replace it . Give a refund . 
 Oh , really ? Give me a clam soup . 
 Thank you . 
 How are you doing today ? 
 What can I do for you ? 
 Is there a problem ? 
 How much did you write it out for ? 
 How much was it supposed to be ? 
 I ’ ll cancel that check for you . 
 It's nice of you to see me off . 
 Thanks . Stop here now . 
 OK , I will . Goodbye and remember to look me up if ever you're in Paris . 
 OK , bye for now ! 
 How was your flight from Hong Kong ? 
 10:30 . I'll pick you up at the hotel at 10:00 . : 10:30 . 
 I said please stop by the entrance of EVA Air at the Arrival Terminal . 
 Oh , no . That ’ s it . Nice to chat with you . Have a good day . 
 Mr . McKenna , do you have a second ? I need to talk to you about something . 
 Well , I was just wondering . . . you see , I know I ’ Ve used up all my vacation days this year , but my sister is getting married , and the wedding is overseas , and , well . . . 
 Well , sir , I was just hoping that I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year . 
 I was thinking of taking off from September first until the thirtieth . Would you be okay with that ? 
 how can I help you ? 
 do you know what kind of scent she usually wears ? 
 ok , here are some of our most popular perfumes . 
 personally , I quite like the new perfume by Clinique . It's a subtle flowery scent . What do you think ? 
 would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers . 
 how about some lipstick ? Every woman needs a nice tube of red lipstick . 
 how about some mascara ? That will make her eyes look bigger . 
 I know what she would like---some whitening cream . 
 will that be all then ? 
 Hello . Is there a room available tonight ? 
 I ’ d like a twin room , please . 
 Oh , I see . Thank you anyway . 
 I'm nervous . I have to make a big presentation in the meeting . 
 What are your plans for the future if you are hired ? 
 Do you have any short-term goals ? 
 Would you like me to go into a little more detail about the free services we can offer you ? 
 No problem . First of all , we can provide a business licence . Secondly , Enterprise ID Certificates , Forex registration and ... 
 Yes , ' Foreign Exchange Registration ' , for Bank Drafts , Bills of Exchange and so on . Also , approval of RIB accounts , capital verification and so on . 
 Do you think a private vehicle might be more to your liking ? 
 Even better than a private vehicle is a limo . How does that sound ? 
 A taxi it is . Where will you be headed ? 
 A taxi will be here in just a minute , sir . 
 The taxi will be ready when you are , sir . 
 No problem . How many are you thinking about ? 
 If you'll just fill out this form , please . 
 We can do that very easily . 
 Great . Your order will take only one week . 
 We can do that . It'll just cost you extra . 
 Well take your time . There are so many things to sell . 
 $ 7 . 
 Excuse me . I'm looking for Bluemingdails . Could you tell me how to get there ?

 Thanks very much .

 Hello , Walter ? 
 I was wondering if you wanted to go for a walk with us . 
 Oh , man . I hope you get to feeling better . 
 OK , then . I'll be there in a minute . 
 I'm in the bathroom . 
 Gross . Diarrhea ? 
 OK , whatever , I don't want to hear about it . I'll call the doctor for you . 
 Enough . I don't want to hear any more about your bathroom time .

 OK , Tom . It's your turn . Are you ready ? 
 Come on ! In the two hours we've been here , you haven't sung even one song ! 
 Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis song for him ? He loves ' The King ' . 
 Say , what's you favorite sport ? 
 Do you know how to skate , like a skater ? 
 Then you must know a lot about skating . 
 No , sir . 
 I'm sorry . I did not know that . 
 Can't you give me a warning ? 
 How much will the fine be ? 
 I have to go to court over a brake light ? 
 Can I have the ticket , please ? 
 I'm here for the backpack you announced several minutes ago . 
 Sure . Here you are . 
 Of course , it's a soft leather one , you know , not a sports one that looks childish . 
 No , it's straps closed , and it has a buckle in the front . 
 Oh , yeah , the brand name . 
 Oh , it's a Polo . It has the logo on the back and at the bottom in the left-hand corner . 
 Well , all the gifts for my family , you know , two pairs of sneakers for my children and a bottle of perfume for my wife . 
 Thank you so much . You guys are really responsible .

 Thank you so much . You guys are really responsible . 
 I really enjoy it , especially when it ends up tasting good ! 
 I usually make a few salads for lunch throughout the week and I make dinner about 6 times a week . 
 I do . If you cook at home , you can eat healthy food cheaply . 
 I almost always make either a beef roast or a chicken roast with asparagus , parsnips , peas , carrots and potatoes on Sundays . 
 aside from the Sunday roast , we usually eat dangers and mash , toad-in-the-hole , or fish'n chips once a week . 
 my family loves spicy food . We often eat Chinese , Thai , Indian , or Mexican food when we're in the mood for spice . 
 I absolutely love making mousaka , which is a Greek dish with eggplant . But it takes a lot of time , so I don ’ t often make it . 
 Yes , it does . 
 I think it leaves at two-thirty . 
 Where are you going to find one ? 
 Do you want to know where I bought mine ? 
 I got it from IKEA . 
 It cost me a couple thousand for the whole set . 
 The furniture is built extremely well . 
 Well , trust me . The quality is fantastic . 
 As your realtor , I am here to take care of this process . How much were you planning on offering ? 
 We want to leave ourselves some bargaining room . Let ’ s offer three hundred and twenty thousand dollars . 
 The market is fairly down right now , so the offer is a realistic one . 
 The owners usually respond to an offer within a few days . 
 You are already pre-qualified for your loan , so you are in good shape . 
 Well , I like reading , walking , swimming , hiking and playing basketball 
 Yes . These hobbies have indeed enriched my life 
 I prefer to read novels with a cup of tea . 
 Detective books . 
 To some extent , I regard books as my good companion . 
 That's for sure . 
 Well , as a rule , the contract will become void automatically , if both sides do not agree to renew it when time comes . 
 Oh , I am sorry . I misunderstood . Well , in that case , the contract can be canceled with a 2 month's notice . What do you say ? 
 Hello Mr Fang ! It's good to see you again . What can we do for you today ? 
 That shouldn't be a problem , Mr Fang . Have you got your Certificate of Use of Foreign Exchange Account and the Foreign Exchange Account Opening Notice with you ? Our most widely used currencies are US dollar , Japanese yen and Hong Kong dollar . 
 We will transact this for you as soon as we can after the materials you have given me have been checked and verified . 
 Housekeeping , may I help you ? 
 May I have your room number , please ? 
 505 . Let me check it out . Just a moment , please . I'm sorry . You're right . We have found your sweater . We made a mistake delivering the laundry . We'll send it up to your room at once . We're very sorry for the inconvenience 
 Dick , I ’ Ve decided not to rent that house . 
 I ’ Ve changed my mind . 
 Well , I think maybe I should find a house that is closer to where I work . 
 Hello . 9-1- 1 . Can I help you ? 
 What happened ? 
 Give me your address . 
 All right . The police and an ambulance are on the way . In the meantime , find a clean cloth and press it firmly over the wound . This will slow the bleeding . 
 Help will be there in just a few minutes . 
 Sure . What is it ? 
 All right . What do you want me to get ? 
 Okay . How much ? 
 How many ? 
 Anything else ? 
 Okay . How much do you want me to get ? A gallon ? 
 Is that all ? 
 Yes . That's small bag of sugar , four oranges , and a half gallon of milk . 
 I think so . 
 How far is it from here to the airport ? 
 I need to get there before ten.Can we make it ? 
 Hello , I bought a pen in your shop just before . 
 Now I came back to the hotel and try to show it to my friend , the pen is broken , I am afraid . 
 Would you change it to a new one ? 
 Yes , I do . 
 Thank you so much ! 
 Yes . This way please . 
 I recommend our New English Pizza . 
 Okay . Wait a minute please . 
 Well , in the feudal society , emperors had supreme power , so his residence was certainly a forbidden palace . 
 Yes . The Forbidden City is divided into two parts . The southern section , or the Outer Court was for the emperor to exercise his power over the nation , and the northern part , or the Inner Court was for his royal family . 
 Even the whole country belonged to him . That's why he is called the emperor . 
 Yeah , the buildings and designs of the Forbidden City are the peak of Chinese traditional architecture , not only scientific but also suitable for living . 
 Some of them are mascots and some are symbols of power . 
 Oh , no . In fact , yellow is the symbol of the royal family . 
 Exactly . Here is the Nine-dragon Screen . 
 Sure , this will be a really good picture . 
 I want a pair of locus . 
 I need size 41 . 
 Okay . I'll just be a minute .
