How are you ? 
 What can I help you with ? 
 How much are you withdrawing today ? 
 What account would you like to take this money from ? 
 Here ’ s your $ 300 . 
 Will you be needing anything else ? 
 Are you still hungry , Ryan ? How about some more squid balls ? 
 Wow ! You really like fruit , huh ? You've already had 3 plates ! 
 Well , whatever suits your fancy . I'll press the service button again . 
 I totally agree . I really like my lifestyle to be drama-free , and I don't want to argue about cleaning the apartment . My last roommate was a drama queen . Every time I forgot to take my shoes off , she got really mad and made a big deal out of it . 
 That's right . We should try to be laid back and not do lots of things to bother one another . 
 Of course . We both experienced a good cooperation . 
 Hi , Jone , how are you ? 
 What's wrong ? 
 Oh , no ! Did you call the police ? 
 Why not ? 
 I'm going to give you some advice , Jone.If this happens again , you should call the police immediately . You should try to remember everything . You should explain everything to the police . 
 Hello , Dana , this is Kevin Abrahams from Eureka Corp . I don't know if you'll remember me but we met last week at the Chamber of Commerce luncheon . 
 Great . Do you have a few minutes right now for me to tell you a little bit more about the data management tools our company has to offer ? It won't take long . 
 Oh , sure , I understand . I'd be happy to send you a promotional packet about the programs that I think might best suit a company of your size . Would it be okay if I called again to see if you have any questions ? 
 No problem at all . I won't keep you any longer . I'll put a package to you in the mail and we'll go from there . 
 Thanks for your time . 
 Are you Liu Yan ? 
 Have you brought your credentials ? 
 Let me have a look . 
 Your resume says you worked at DK Company for two years . What were you responsible for ? 
 Have you received any honorable title personally ? 
 Well , considering your qualifications , we believe you would be a suitable candidate . 
 Do you think it looks good on me ? 
 You won't believe it , but it was really cheap . 
 Do you have everything ? 
 It's hot today , shall we go for a dip at the beach ? 
 Would you like to swim in the swimming pool or at the beach ? 
 OK . Let's pay the entrance fee and change our clothes in the dressing room . 
 Well , I use breast stroke for long distance , crawl or free style for short distance and back stroke just for fun . 
 I had a bad start of the day . I was stuck in a bad traffic jam on my way and I missed my morning meeting . 
 It is ok . My boss briefs me later on . 
 Err , kind of . You know this traffic jam is really bad with so many new cars hitting the streets these days . 
 Hello , Debbie . This is Donald . 
 What happened yesterday ? You forgot our date , didn ’ t you ? 
 You did ? But I tried to call you at least twenty times and nobody answered . 
 What did David do yesterday ? Did he and Judy go dancing ? 
 And what did you do ? Did you play cards , too ? 
 I just told you , Debbie . I tried to call you twenty times ! 
 Yes , to tell you the truth , there is . 
 Well , I've lost my wallet and my ID card . 
 Forget it , there is no use crying over the spilled milk . 
 Yes , I am . When is the wedding ? 
 August bride . How nice ! By the way , who is going to be the matron of honor ? 
 Oh , yeah ? I wonder who is going to give Jane away at the wedding . You know her father passed away several years ago . 
 I think so . The wedding will be held at her church , right ? 
 Do you know where they will go on their honeymoon ? 
 Hi , sir . Could you tell me where the Hilton Hotel is ? 
 Eh , let me see . Sorry , I can't remember it , because I've been there only once , accompanied by my friends . 
 A bookstore , probably . With a yellow and orange logo . 
 I remembered there is a very busy street several miles away . I waited for the traffic light for a very long time . 
 Oh , yeah , I got it , there is a bank My friend exchanged her money there . 
 Great ! Many thanks ! 
 Well , I was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . Now , I know the answer . 
 To some extent , it is . Anyway , whether they like it or not , they do give people a very good impression . 
 Room service.May I come in ? 
 Sir , this is the coffee and bread you want.Can I put it here ? 
 $ 6 . 
 Certainly.Please sign your name here . 
 She didn ’ t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day ’ s hard work . 
 Alison , would you like to have some more ? 
 Actually you haven't had much . 
 That sounds ridiculous . Why ? 
 I broke my sister's mirror . I'm sure it'll get her back up . I really don't know how I can escape the punishment . 
 Graham , why are you always on the phone with Jane ? 
 The other night when you came home there was lipstick on your right cheek . How do you explain that ? 
 Are you sure ? 
 Okay , I'm sorry . I believe you . 
 Because you are the most handsome boy at the university and I love you so much ! I guess I just go crazy sometimes . That's all . 
 Why ? 
 Oh . Graham . I love you so much and I really believe in our love . 
 No problem . We can do it right now . 
 All right . Now what do I do ? 
 Which way do you want me to go ? 
 How far do you want me to go ? 
 Just make sure to tell me beforehand . 
 Well , that was fun . Let's do it again soon . 
 Sure , sweetie.What are you doing ? 
 OK.Why don't you just hold the ladder , and I'll put it up . 
 What is the best place to park ? 
 I drive a motorcycle . 
 I am not sure what a handicapped spot is . 
 I park days and evenings . 
 What signs ? 
 What curb colors ? 
 Have you heard about Jessica's party on Saturday ? 
 Really ? I got mine from her this morning . 
 You're probably right , do you intend on going to the party ? 
 I know , it does sound pretty awesome . 
 It's supposed to start at about eight . 
 I really don't know , but I don't think she gave out that many yet . 
 Hello . This is Lucy from ABC Company . Is this Monica ? 
 I am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . Could you please come for the final round ? It is scheduled on the morning of next Monday 10AM in the HR manager office . 
 Ok , see you then , bye . 
 Oh , what a beautiful garden ! 
 The garden looks lovely when the roses are in bloom . You must have a lot of pleasure in planting flowers . 
 You did a good job . But I got tired of working in the garden . 
 Yes . Thanks . 
 I'm not sure , but let me check my schedule ... Ah , no . I have nothing then . 
 How nice of him ! I'll be delighted to go . But what time would be convenient ? 
 That's good . It's most thoughtful of you to do this , Miss Wood . 
 How much will my pay be , if you don ’ t mind my asking ? 
 Yes , thank you . May I ask for an apartment ? 
 I don't think you've met my sister , Mary . 
 Come and meet her now . 
 Is it true that one of our competitors is planning to launch their tracking service next month ? 
 Or they'll take over the market before we even get started . 
 I guess we'd better get back to work . 
 Maybe you should look around for an outlet . 
 Outlets have more reasonable prices . 
 No problem . Good luck 
 Hi . You called and said I should come in . It's about some documents that have arrived for Nobut Foods . 
 Oh great ! We've been waiting for those . Is everything alright with them ? 
 No , everything has to be perfect . 
 Look ! Someone is celebrating his birthday . 
 Why ? Do you know that guy ? 
 That's interesting . But it would be really expensive , I suppose . Just think about all the drinks . 
 Wow . That's wonderful . 
 Nowadays , it's no difference from America . But in old times , we have traditional ways to celebrate it . 
 Ha , I am flattered . Actually , when it comes to negotiate , you don ’ t need to like it . You just need to understand how it works . 
 Well , generally speaking , if you want to change someone ’ s mind or understand his position , you have to put yourself in his shoes . Understand his need and the cost for his need . And then you work together to find a solution . 
 Ok , as John after Kennedy put it , let us never negotiate out of fear , but let us never fear to negotiate . 
 How is this one ? It's the latest , made of cashmere . 
 Sure . 
 Thank your for calling World Airline . What can I do for you ? 
 Round-trip or one-way ? 
 What date would you like to fly ? 
 How many people will be traveling ? 
 Which class ? 
 Right . Ok , the fare is $ 700 . 
 Sure . I don ’ t mind . 
 I don ’ t see why not . 
 Go ahead . It ’ s OK with me . 
 No . 
 The annual salary is sixty-five thousand dollars per year . 
 This job pays for half of your medical , dental , and disability . 
 You have a total of 21 days paid time off which can be used for vacation , personal , or sick leave . 
 We still offer a traditional retirement plan that pays out if you stay with the company for 5 years or more . 
 We offer full tuition reimbursement for job related classes . 
 It's on the second floor in Suite 201 . 
 I knew this would happen some day . 
 Well . It's not all my fault , Anna . You are responsible , too . 
 I think we can still talk . 
 Talk it easy , Anna . You really don't hate me . do you ? 
 Daddy , I love this Happy Farmhouse . It's really fun . 
 But you are holding it for me . Nothing to worry about . I trust you . Oops , what's that ? 
 What would happen if they started attacking you ? 
 I see . Why do people come all the way here to pick apples by themselves and take them home ? Isn't it easier for them to buy the apples in the supermarket ? 
 Come on , daddy . You can see that people only pick the red ones . 
 Oh , then what would happen if there were pests ? 
 Cool ! Well , let's go over there to join mom . I want to tell her all about the special pests-killing method . 
 Swimming . What about you ? 
 What's the bonus like at your company ? 
 Six months ' salary ? Are you serious ? That's incredible ! 
 Hey , I know what that's like . I bought a BMW on my Visa card . Now the payments really hurt . 
 What did you buy ? 
 Health Monitor ? I read an article about that racket.They ' re overpriced to begin with ! Listen , if I were you , I'd let them take back their monitor and spend my money on something more practical . 
 No joke ! 
 How I wish my son Mark could be as excellent as your Joe ! 
 I agree . Both Joe and Mark are men of guts . 
 Don't you have a credit card ? 
 Why don't you change the cash to traveler's checks ? It's much more convenient and safer . When you are abroad , you can cash them . 
 Have you applied for you visa to go to study in the united states yet ? 
 Good luck ! I ’ Ve heard it ’ s very difficult to get a visa to go to the united states . 
 What kind of documents did you need to present ? 
 Why do you think so many people have their applications rejected ? 
 Why are they stricter with Chinese people than with other nationalities ? 
 Good morning , young lady . You can call me Ma . Do you see anything you like ? 
 That quilt was passed down to me from my ma in Holland . 
 Well , this home is too big for me now , so I'm moving to an apartment that is much smaller . Therefore , I need to part with a few things . 
 Is fifteen dollars OK ? 
 I'm here , hello . 
 I'm in Beijing , at the Weston Hotel . 
 I don't have it to hand , but I know the number . It's 16211469 9 . Can you do anything , like stop the card for example ? 
 But , what do I do if I need cash ? 
 Thank you so much . I'll find the nearest branch and come in tomorrow . Thanks again for all of your help . 
 Oh , hi Mike . I ’ Ve been out of town the last few days . What did you need ? 
 Well , feel free to drop by my office any time . The door ’ s always open . 
 Sure , Mike , I ’ d love to . 
 No , that ’ s perfect . We can leave directly from here . 
 No Let's go to an ice cream parlor ! They have way more flavors to choose from there . I feel like having something special like Neapolitan ice cream . 
 It's three different flavors mixed together . Chocolate , strawberry and something green with candied fruit . 
 Absolutely ! They also have real Italian Galatian and French sorbets . They do a great baked Alaska . 
 Well ... l like the traditional flavors like rum raisin , butter pecan . maple walnut , strawberry , chocolate and vanilla . But now there are some new flavors from Asia like green tea and durian . 
 That's OK . We can go jogging , after we eat ! 
 Yes , I would be happy to help . What do you want to buy ? 
 OK . So this machine will make change if you need it . Do you have your dollars ready ? 
 Next , you feed your dollars into the machine in the slot . Make sure they are smooth . 
 I'm sure you know that if the dollar gets stuck , you might have to re-feed it . 
 Now you just make your selection and pray . If nothing comes out , try again or call the number on the side of the machine . 
 Well , good luck ! 
 First of all , I hope to spend a few years working in some famous companies to command a skill , to set a solid foundation and to build my interpersonal network . When I feel I have accumulated enough experience , I hope to own an undertaking . Of course this is up to the situation then and the opportunities the companies offer me . In the long run , I hope to be an entrepreneur . 
 I'd be happy to help you . Name it . 
 Sure , no problem . Do you want me to edit it for you ? 
 Oh , its nothing . 
 Well . All right , Mark . Just this once . But you have to pick them up yourself . I ’ m a very busy man . 
 I ’ d rather you didn ’ t come immediately as I said I ’ m very busy at the moment . Come after lunch , Mark . 
 I'm glad I was able to help . 
 Don't mention it . It was the least I could do . 
 Thank you . 
 It was a pleasure . 
 Yes , you can take small sum of money and important items such as passport and keys and business documents and so on . 
 There is a long list of those things forbidden , including explosives , gum opium and precious cultural relies and so on . 
 Sure.the fitting room is right behind you . 
 Sure , wait a moment . 
 I feel sorry for you . It's a jungle out there . 
 well . I guess I can ask around to see if anyone's got a room or apartment available . 
 how much do are you looking to spend ? 
 looks like you'll have to get a place in the suburbs . 
 anything you need to have in the place ? 
 you can also check out university bulletin boards . 
 not really , but landlords put up notices to attract students and they often have low rent . 
 good luck . 
 I am sorry , sir , there are still 5 minutes remaining ... OK , it's time . We will take a roll call before starting the fantasy sightseeing . 
 For about 3 hours . Enjoy your trip . 
 Oh , hello . I'm Bias Chettri . 
 Pleased to meet you too , Ms Jenson . 
 You really should go to Rachel's pet store . 
 it's more than special . You can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more . 
 snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets . 
 Hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ? 
 but it will pose a risk to your health . 
 i mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria . they are likely to cause immune system problems . 
 I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children . 
 yes , good luck , Maria . 
 Thank you , same to you ! Lee , have you got any plans ? 
 How nice ! Have fun ! 
 Keep in touch ! 
 Welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you today ? 
 OK , that's absolutely fine . I will need to see some credentials before we can get started . Do you have the notification of admission letter from your university , your passport and your visa with you ? 
 You do , I'm afraid . There are 3 ways to do this . You can choose , mortgage , pledge or guarantee mode . 
 Right , that's no problem . I see you are already well informed . If you choose that one , you can borrow up to 70 % of the total tuition and miscellaneous fees . 
 You know , I really don ’ t think Americans are very romantic . 
 That ’ s the impression I get from the movies , and from looking around . Men and women seem very business-like in their relations with each other . 
 Is it true or isn ’ t it ? 
 I just think you ’ re trying to change the subject . But go ahead . 
 OK , go on . 
 Not exactly , but I see your point . 
 What time is it by your watch ? 
 It's 2:42 by my watch . But it moves a bit fast . 
 I like Chinese food . 
 At school , we sometimes have Chinese food for lunch . 
 My mother can make some Chinese food . 
 Is there anything I can do for you , Mr . King ? 
 Is it all right for you to pay the bill this evening ? 
 At the Cashier's Counter of our hotel , right in the lobby downstairs . 
 All right . Is your companion leaving for Shanghai with you ? 
 Shall I make out a single bill or two separate bills ? 
 OK . I'll surely have the bill ready for this evening . 
 No problem . By the way , do you have any comment to make on our hotel ? 
 Thank you for your compliments . You're welcome to our hotel again . 
 I just dropped in to say good-bye . 
 I'm going to try to leave by ten . 
 Good-bye . Hope to see you soon again next year . 
 What happened to that girl you were seeing ? 
 That was a short relationship . You only started dating 2 months ago . 
 What do you mean ? 
 She sounds very emotional . 
 Were you suppose to be there ? 
 Ok . You're right . She's a psycho . 
 Hi , boss . You have a call . 
 I know . But she said she had an important thing to tell you . 
 Thanks . 
 Here you are . 
 China . 
 I just work there . 
 I'm here on vacation . 
 Almost three weeks . 
 Oh , I'm sorry , but there are a couple of different places I will travel to within the United States , so I wasn't sure what to put . 
 Ok , here you are . 
 Yes . I have some travellers cheques and two credit cards . 
 Nope . I only have my clothes and camera ! 
 Please fill in the arrival card and sign the register . 
 Room 202 , but I'm afraid we have to ask for a deposit of $ 200 . 
 Sure , here you go . 
 Of course . There you are . 
 Hey , Sandy . Do you want to go to the ETV with us ? 
 Good morning.sir.My name is Liu Peng from Tsinghai University . I am here for the interview relating to my visa application . 
 Of course not . 
 I'd like to have further education.Now I am studying for my doctorate . 
 Yes . The school has provided me with full scholarship and that will be enough to support myself . 
 What kind of keys ? 
 What a shame ! I didn't see them . 
 Sure . It's my pleasure . I'd like to help you look for the missing keys . 
 It's not a big deal.Hey , I found them . 
 You're welcome . 
 Yes , a little breeze and a lovely moon . 
 Me , too . 
 Yes , Mr . Ransom ? This is Karl Miller . How may I help you ? 
 Certainly , Ms . Ransom . Do you have an order number ? 
 Why ? What's the problem ? 
 Okay , I'll get Bob to cover you . 
 I'm moblogging ! 
 Oh , moblogging is a combination of the word ' mobile ' and ' blogging ' . It's another form of blogging . Users can publish blog entries to the web from a mobile phone or other mobile devices . 
 Yes , you're right . I can blog wherever and whenever I'm on the move . It's especially good when I'm on a business trip and my laptop happens to be away from me . 
 Well , if I simply want to write a few words , I'll send it by email or edit it all from the cell phone browser . 
 Then I'll shoot some pictures , re-size the images and upload them with text descriptions to my blog . 
 You bet it ! 
 I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour . 
 I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ? 
 Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ? 
 I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy . 
 We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm . 
 Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze . 
 Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible . 
 I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days . 
 Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days . 
 Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again . 
 I fired Mr . Li today . 
 May I show you to your room ? 
 Here , let me help you with your bags . 
 Let me see . How much should I pay for you ? 
 No , this will not do . Let me see . 
 Good ideas . 
 Wow , that would be very convenient . How much is the rent ? 
 That definitely sounds like a steal . I think that is a very trendy neighborhood as well . 
 Good afternoon . Is there a vacant room here ? 
 A single , preferably with a bath . 
 For four days or so . 
 I hope it's quiet . I hate noise . 
 How much does it cost per day ? 
 All right . I'll take the room . 
 OK . 
 No problem . Here you are . 
 The skirt looks beautiful . Can I try it on ? 
 Well , I think this one is a little too small . Would you please bring me a bigger one ? 
 What ’ s up ? You don ’ t look too good . 
 I liked physics . It ’ s all math , really , arcs , curves , velocity , cool stuff . 
 A physics class about the creation of the universe ? That ’ s some pretty unscientific language there . Sounds more religious to me . 
 Turtles ? Whatever ... Look , all that ’ s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles . At least , that ’ s what the math says . 
 There is evidence ! You know Edwin Hubble ? He ’ s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . What would it be expanding from ? Well , the Big Bang ... DUH ! 
 Dude , don ’ t equivocate . A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing . You slept through class , didn ’ t you ? 
 All right . 
 What would you suggest ? 
 I'd like the beef . 
 No , I'd rather have a glass of juice , please . What kinds do you have ? 
 I'll have a glass of lemonade . More ice , please . 
 Could you give me more paper napkins ? 
 Thanks . 
 Did you clean your room today ? 
 Well , when were you planning on doing that ? 
 Didn't I ask you to clean it up earlier ? 
 I want you to vacuum in your room , and don't forget to dust everything . 
 Make sure you clean it up before you do anything else . 
 Well , humans could never make something like that . 
 Be a little more open-minded , Stu ! Don't believe everything you read in your history books ! 
 Speaking of The X-files , it's on right now ! 
 Hi . I ’ m interested in renting a one-bedroom apartment . 
 Thank you . 
 Do you want me to check the tires ? 
 $ 10 . 
 Um ... well , actually , we had a fantastic time last night . He was ... amazing ! 
 He ’ s really good looking . he ’ s quite tall , around 61 , he ’ s in his early thirties , and he ’ s got the most beautiful dark brown eyes ... 
 You know what , this is the best part . David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank , so he ’ s got a great career path ahead of him ! 
 Yeah ? 
 Hello , George ! Haven't seen you for some time.Where have you been ? 
 Very well.Thank you.Did you have a good time there ? 
 The final examination will be held at the end of this month . Have you made good preparation ? 
 Are you sure you can do well this year ? 
 According to what you did last time , I have my doubts . 
 I ’ m sorry to disturb you , Mr . Crane . 
 Could you please look over these resumes ? They ’ Ve just come in . 
 To be frank , I find philosophy rather boring . 
 How could you manage to pass the exam ? 
 I am tired of everything in my life . 
 You don ’ t know that I have been over-protected by my mother these years . I am really about to leave the family and spread my wings . 
 How about the matter ? 
 It ’ s the only way to preserve her reputation . 
 I hear many people here speak French . 
 It is not easy to improve my English . 
 Yeah ! But French is not easy to learn . 
 Good morning . What can I do for you ? 
 This is our new brand . I can make sure our computer board is one of the best boards . 
 With pleasure . It's easy to have a memory expansion on board capacity and fulfill your needs for a computer . Besides , there is more space for extra cards to expand later on . 
 The hard drive has 260 G and the RAM is 4 G . 
 Yes . The price differs depending on how many you want . 
 Yes . It depends . If you have a large order , we will give you a discount . 
 Thank you , miss . Will dinner be served on the plane ? 
 That would be nice . Could you also get me a pillow and a blanket , please ? 
 How long will this flight last ? 
 Good . I'll have plenty of time to nap on the plane . 
 Just so so.There are no exciting things for me . 
 Sure it is . Why don't we go to a park ? 
 I just moved into my apartment , and the plumbing is not working . 
 The bathtub barely drains at all . 
 Neither the kitchen nor the bathroom plumbing is working well . 
 It just started happening last night . 
 I will not be home . 
 What's it made of , could you tell me ? 
 Can it wear well and keep its shape ? 
 What's the time ? My watch has stopped . 
 Is your watch right ? 
 Could you type up this document for me , Sandra ? 
 Never mind . I'll do it . 
 Yes . I would like a pair of black leather shoes in size 25 . 
 The tip is rather narrow . 
 We ’ re trying to get donations . 
 We ’ re getting donations for the campaigns . 
 As much as we can . 
 We ’ re just going door to door . 
 Do you have any suggestions ? 
 That is a good idea . 
 Hello . I'm Duty Manager today ; you wanted to speak to me ? 
 Yes , Sir . We can provide these loans in both local and foreign currency , Temporary Working Capital Loans , Short-term Working Capital Loans and Mid-term Working Capital Loans . 
 Which one interests you , Sir ? 
 Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 Yes , sir . Do you need some flowers ? 
 Certainly , sir . What kind of flowers would you like ? 
 You need fruit and lilies . Am I right ? 
 I think it's quite enough . I'II have them bought for you as soon as possible . 
 Why do you want to eat western food so much today ? Anything special to celebrate ? Did you get a promotion ? 
 It's not your birthday , also not mine . Hey , come on . Just tell me . 
 My dear , tomorrow is our wedding anniversary . We've been together for 20 years . But you never change . Always so careless ! Do you remember the thing that happened on our wedding day ? 
 Yeah . Do you know that this restaurant used to be the teahouse where we first met ? 
 Do you remember our first date ? I got a really special gift . 
 Yeah , it's really unforgettable . Thank you for making me happy all these years . 
 Have you bought War Craft 2 yet ? 
 How do you like it ? 
 Did it cost very much 
 Mechwarrior is such a good game . The graphics are awesome ! 
 My roommate always wants to play it . But I told her to buy her own game . 
 I've never seen such good graphics . 
 I'd like to mail this letter to Taipei . 
 Taiwan . 
 Okay . Can I also have a sheet of 20 sixty-four-cent stamps ? 
 By the way , how much does it cost to send a package to Taiwan ? 
 I see . 
 Oh I fell over on the way to work . 
 Yes and I broke my phone too so I couldn ’ t call you . 
 It was ! But the worst thing was I tore my best shirt . 
 What date is today ? 
 Didn't you notice the roses everywhere ? 
 Oh , God . I just forgot it . I should have brought roses for my girlfriend . 
 Here's Copellini's , my cousin's store . 
 Admit it . You just think of Mussolini . 
 Ah , yes . The Italians do love the sensual forms of the human body . 
 Yeah-all from Italy . See all the saints ? They're important to Roman Catholics . 
 Tell me what you're hungry for . 
 Unfortunately , we're out of filet mignon at the moment . May I suggest the porterhouse instead ? 
 Perhaps I could interest you in chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ? 
 You'll see this charge on your amenities account . 
 It won't be long until your food is delivered . I know you'll enjoy it . 
 External factors . I think the main external factors are political , economic , social and technological factors . 
 The internal factors are composed of human resources , team spirit , innovation spirit and coordination between different departments , etc . 
 I'm afraid not . Why don't you call the Help Desk ? Someone there will be able to help you . 
 Excuse me , miss . I don't think we need the MP4 any more . We would like to refund it . 
 Here you are . 
 Tell me about yourself and your past experience . 
 How are your typing and shorthand skills ? 
 Can you operate computers skillfully ? 
 Sometimes we are very busy and need to work overtime . How do you feel about that ? 
 It just depends . If we have important visiting delegations , you have to stay with us . It's not unusual . 
 OK , please . 
 Nothing different from a secretary's common responsibilities . However , you know , our company is an international trade-oriented company , can you handle English papers and write English correspondence ? 
 What are your salary expectations ? 
 The starting monthly salary would be ¥ 2,000 , with rises after the half year according to your competence . 
 We'll inform you of our final decision by early July . Do you have any other questions ? 
 Hey , May . How about getting together for a movie tonight ? 
 Well , Let me check the newspaper . What about The Terminal ? 
 Well , birds of a feather flock together . I like her too . She was in a lot of dramas . 
 What's more , she doesn't have scandals . And she likes to take part in the charitable activities . 
 Steven Spielberg . Another superstar . 
 Can you introduce the story of The Terminal briefly ? 
 This is really exciting movie . Lets go to this one . 
 Yes . Work starts at eight and I arrive home after six . 
 I can take a break at lunch time , but it is only 30 minutes . 
 Yes , I really don't like it . 
 I said , ' Do you need any help ? ' 
 Just tell me what you'd like me to do . 
 Would you please tell us how to review our lessons ? 
 Any other requirements ? 
 Should we remember all the new words and expressions ? 
 Sorry , I don't quite understand some difficult points in this unit . I wonder if you could help us to solve the problems . 
 When shall we have a coaching period ? 
 Ok . 
 I am typing a report for the moment , Mr . Robbins . Anything I need to do ? 
 Is it urgent ? 
 Ok , I am coming . 
 Yes , I have this time . But If I don't understand a word or a phrase when you are dictating , can I ask you halfway ? 
 All right . I understand now . Do you think I should leave a margin on every page wide enough for notes and amendments . 
 Certainly I will , Mr . Robbins . By the way , may I use a window envelope ? 
 You want the cards in alphabetical order using the last names ? 
 Royal Hotel , can I help you ? 
 Yes , we have . What kind of room would you like ? 
 No problem , sir . 
 I ’ m fine . 
 I would like to cancel a check . 
 I wrote the check out for too much . 
 I wrote it out for $ 150 . 
 It was supposed to be for $ 100 . 
 I really appreciate your help . 
 Hello . I'd like to speak to someone regarding my card . 
 No , no . Nothing at all like that . It's just that I applied for a credit card with you a while ago , my application was accepted , but I'm still waiting for my card . 
 Yes , my application was accepted last Friday . Now it's Wednesday , that's more than 5 days . 
 Of course ! How silly of me ! Yes , 5 working days would mean this Friday , at the earliest . I see . I'm sorry to trouble you . 
 Nothing , thanks . I again apologise for the misunderstanding , bye for now . 
 $ 90 . 
 Sorry , sir . The prices here are all fixed . 
 I am trying to find this book . 
 It doesn ’ t seem like this library has it . 
 I have already . 
 It says the book is on the shelf , but I didn ’ t find it there . 
 You can do that ? 
 That ’ s fantastic . Thank you . 
 No , you'll have to get off at the bank , and take a No . 50 . 
 One dollar . 
 Two stops after this one . 
 Sure . 
 No , a No . 50 will take you right there . 
 Wei , you look really tired . 
 9:00 ! 
 Why ’ s that ? 
 Good evening , sir . I understand that you have been robbed . 
 When did this happen ? 
 Why didn't you report it before ? 
 Please tell me exactly what happened . 
 That wasn't very wise , sir . 
 You should never open a door without looking to see who it is . 
 What happened ? 
 Did you get a good look at them ? 
 What did they take ? 
 They don't seem to have done much damage to the flat . 
 My men began searching the area as soon as we received your call . I can't promise you that we'll recover your property but we'll certainly do our best . 
 That ’ s understandable . Every kid likes new clothes . 
 Please put your baggage on the counter and open it , let me have a look . 
 Anything subject to duty in your suitcase ? 
 Any cigarettes or liquor ? 
 I think you'll have to pay some duty on these cigarettes because they exceed the quota . And this article is liable for duty . 
 One hundred dollars . 
 Just a moment . I'll make out your duty memo . ( Writing and giving the memo to Mr . Green ) Take it and pay the girl over there . 
 Can you give me a hand with my luggage ? 
 Excuse me . Is anyone sitting here ? 
 You don ’ t mind if I smoke , do you ? 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry . But this isn ’ t a no-smoker , is it ? I mean would you mind if I smoke here ? 
 Sign ? What ’ s sign ? 
 Oh , sorry . I didn ’ t notice it . Sorry . 
 I want to leave the motorbike outdoors . 
 Why not ? 
 What about you , Ernie ? How did you get into pop music ? 
 Yeah , if something is on the radio it must be really good . 
 Excuse me , I want to know what's your price per dozen for exercise books ? 
 Oh , it's rather too high . We have another offer for a similar one at a much lower price . 
 If you can go a little lower , I'd be able to give you an order on the spot . 
 I hope you'll give a second thought to it . 
 What about if we order a large amount of exercise books ? 
 About 300 dozens . 
 OK . That's a deal . 
 Certainly . Jackie Chan is a very famous movie star in Hong Kong . His Chinese name is Cheng Long . 
 OK . Then tell me what else you know . 
 He measures his worth by how many of his bones he has fractured while executing his film , incredible stunts . By the way , can you count the breaks ? 
 Indeed you know much about him . 
 Is this the central park to East Market bus ? 
 To the ministry government hall . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes . I'm coming to confirm my ticket . 
 My name is Zu Ping . In fact , I have a reservation on Flight No . 125 for Zhenjiang , leaving Beijing at 2:00 p . m . tomorrow . Now I'd like to make a change of my travel schedule . Is it possible to change my booking to the day after tomorrow ? 
 Do you have a seat available on the same flight the day after tomorrow ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 That'll be 12 dollars and 95 cents , please . 
 Oh , you don't have anything smaller ? 
 Oh , sure . Credit card is fine . 
 Is this the right subway to the Wall Street ? 
 Could you tell me shall I take the express or local train ? 
 Which of them is the local train , please ? 
 How much is the fare ? 
 What should I do with the token ? 
 Where are you from ? 
 So you speak German , don't you ? 
 Oh , I see . What other languages can you speak ? 
 Good . 
 Yes . I'm used to online shopping . It ’ s convenient and time-saving . You can buy anything you want and they will send it to your home or any place you want . 
 You can get the same product at a much lower price . 
 You should open an account at the online bank first . After that , you can buy anything online . 
 Sure . You can find everything all over the world . Let ’ s check it out online ! 
 The Queen Street , I guess . 
 I ’ m afraid you ’ re going in the opposite direction . 
 Hi , I would like to make a dinner reservation . 
 We will need the reservation for Tuesday night . 
 We would prefer 7 
 There will be 4 of us . 
 Thank you . The last name is Foster . 
 Thank you so much . I appreciate your help . 
 It sure is ! The water looks so nice ! Anchor the boat for a little while . I ’ m going to take a dip . 
 I get too tired ! I ’ ll just backstroke , it ’ s easier ! 
 It ’ s fine . Jump in ! 
 Ahahah ! ! ! Help me ! Help ! Bring the boat closer ! The shark is coming straight towards me ! 
 Japanese is easy to learn . 
 I don't think so.There ' re so many familiar characters and they sound just like Chinese . 
 You're not looking happy.What ' s the matter ? 
 With the job ? 
 A good suggestion for you.You need a holiday . 
 What do you mean ? 
 You need a holiday.That ' s what's the matter . 
 what are you watching on the telly ? 
 which one is that ? 
 I've seen the British version and loved it , but have never seen the American version . 
 what are you watching now ? 
 I can't stand American Idol ! I think it's really over-rated . 
 have you got satellite , cable , or digital TV ? 
 do you watch a lot of TV then ? 
 I don't have a TV at home , so I rarely watch anything . Is there anything worth watching after the office ? 
 why not ? I don't have anything better to do ! 
 Where did you See then last ? 
 Yes.Will you check if my suit is ready to go , please ? 
 Bill Smith . 
 No , it ’ s a dark brown suit . 
 Right . 
 Thanks . 
 Well , I ’ Ve got a terrible stomach-ache and I keep needing the toilet . 
 Well , I went to a seafood restaurant last night and I ate lots of oysters . 
 Ok . Thank you very much . 
 I tried . You were preoccupied . 
 You got drunk , and you were hilarious . Lighten up . 
 So now you can say you had a mafia experience . Ha-ha . 
 Are you kidding ? Don had fun scaring you . He'd probably buy you dinner if we go back . 
 No , who was it ? 
 You ’ re a liar ! 
 Who voted for him ? 
 That ’ s the dumbest thing that I ’ Ve ever heard . 
 What could be worse than what you just told me ? 
 That ’ s fantastic ! You really got me there . 
 I will . Will you be voting ? 
 You don ’ t know that ? 
 It ’ s this Tuesday . 
 Why would I joke ? 
 You should ’ Ve known already . 
 As long as you go vote , that ’ s all that matters . 
 The 486 . 
 Yes , it does . 
 It's about forty-five minutes to an hour . 
 Yeah , it's not that long of a trip . 
 It starts getting more crowded the closer you get to LA . 
 You're very welcome . 
 The weather is so crazy . It rained cats and dogs last night , but cleared up in the morning . 
 Honey , wait for me . I am too tired to move a step further . 
 Attaboy , that's just what I am thinking . 
 Honey , be patient . It's better to wait than to climb with my legs broken . 
 Yeah , the scenery is beautiful . What's more , the air is fresh here ? 
 Of course not , I have to watch my American Idol . 
 I feel like a cup of black tea . 
 Yes , I'd like a portion of that strawberry tart . 
 I'm planning to buy a bicycle . As you are quite a cycling enthusiast , I wish you might give me some advice . 
 My purposes are two-fold . On the one hand , I've grown bored of commuting on suffocating buses every day and decided to ride to work . On the other hand , bicycling is a sport , and I intend to build up my body through constantly taking a ride over the weekends . 
 Does that make any difference ? 
 Are they designed differently ? 
 Do you have a park in the city ? 
 That ’ s great . We can go boating on the lake in the afternoon . 
 Then we can take a walk and enjoy the scenery in the park . 
 Where else haven't we been to yet ? 
 Sounds great ! How many kinds of folk collections do they have ? 
 Private collectors ! They must have excellent collections . I'II go and see each of them . What kinds of collections can I see ? Come on , don't keep me in suspense ! 
 Enough ! I can't wait anymore . 
 Why ? 
 OK . You can change it . 
 No , I think it is very boring . Can you change it to Channel Twelve , please ? 
 Yeah , it's very funny . Have you ever watched it before ? 
 I'm sure you will like it . 
 Just over a year I think . Why , what's the problem ? 
 I think the guarantee's just run out . Let me check . Oh , it's OK . We took out an extended warranty , it runs until next March . 
 I think working in this company could give me the best chance to use what I have learnt . As you know , I majored in computer programming in the university . I've cherished a desire to get a job where I can apply my knowledge . I know your company is one of the largest computer companies in the world , and I wish to have opportunity to develop my capabilities here . That ’ s why I applied . 
 Yes , since 1993 , I ’ Ve been employed as a clerk in the Beijing Branch of the DHAK Trading Corporation . 
 Because I would like to get a job in which I can have good opportunity for advancement , and the job was not challenging enough . 
 Yes , I applied with another company , but that was just to get experience in being interviewed . 
 This one , of course . Your company is my first choice . I want to work for you . 
 I have no idea . It was completely out of the blue . 
 Oh , yes . Step inside , will you ? I'll give you an idea of what business I want to take up with you . Take a seat . We can go into details later . 
 Our speciality back in South Africa is wholesale supplying of screws , bolts , nuts , pins , studs , and that kind of things . 
 For both . Now , do you make machines for producing such things ? 
 Yes , quite free until noon . 
 Have you ? That's splendid . Just let me get my things together . I won't keep you long . 
 hi . Could you give me a hand with this report ? 
 thanks . Would you mind taking a look at the layout ? Do you think it ’ s appropriate ? I want it to be formal , but not boring to look at . 
 that ’ s an excellent suggestion . I can easily do it on the computer . 
 I ’ ll take that suggestion too . How about the content ? 
 is it ok to include the pictures ? 
 thanks for those ideas . I ’ ll get to work on them right away . 
 Here you are . 
 Ok.But is there anything wrong ? 
 I've got 6 packets of cigarettes and 2 bottles of champagne.Besides , I have two cameras , one is for my own use , and the other is a gift . 
 Ok . Where shall I pay duty for it ? 
 I've paid for it . Here's the receipt . 
 Thank you . 
 What happened ? 
 That's great . I thought you said you didn't get the job . 
 I bet . That's great news . I'm very happy for you . 
 Sounds good . 
 Hello , Mr . Jones , its ... 
 Ei , OK , er .. Fred . Thank you for seeing me today . 
 Well , I ... I guess the weather . And the people . They were all very friendly to me . 
 Yes , I am . I was born here , and still live with my parents in the same house . 
 We've been cramming for tomorrow's history exam since early this morning . What do you say we take a break and listen to some music , okay ? 
 While you're picking out a record to play , I'll grab a couple of beers out of the refrigerator . 
 Yeah , I've got everything from rock n ' roll to the latest new - wave stuff . 
 Sorry , my taste in music doesn't go back any further than the 1960 ' s . Music written before then is just history to me . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Do you have your syllabus with you ? May I see it ? 
 Let me see . Oh yes . Your professor has placed this book on reserve . That means you cannot find it on the shelves in its usual place . You need to go to a special room called the reserve room . It's down the hall and to the right . 
 You see , your professor wants every one in the class to read the chapter . If one student removes the book from the library , it is likely that none of the other students will have the opportunity to read it . So , your professor has insured that all students have the opportunity to read it by placing it on reserve . 
 Yes , when a book is on reserve , a student can go to the reserve room and ask the reserve librarian for the book . The student can have the book for a few hours , and he or she MUST read it in the library during that time . That way , the book stays in the library , and all students have a chance to read it . 
 Will there be anything else ? 
 Look , my clothes are wet . 
 Unexpectedly , a girl threw a bucket of water on me . 
 The Dai people are enthusiastic . 
 How are you doing with your English Language studies ? 
 Is it harder than you thought ? 
 Oh hi , Linda , this is Todd . 
 Linda , I just wanted to say that I had a wonderful evening with you last Friday . 
 I had fun also and was wondering if you would like to go hiking with me in the mountains on Saturday . 
 A picnic lunch would be a nice thing to have along . 
 Nine would be good , don't you think ? 
 How's it going ? 
 To be honest , I'm a bit fed up . 
 There's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around . 
 Sure , but how ? 
 But for what reasons ? She doesn't even know who I am . 
 Easier said than done . 
 But I always get tongue-tied when I see her . 
 I see . I'll try . 
 Good morning , Madam . Can I help you ? 
 May I have your name , please ? 
 I see . Wait for a moment please . I am sorry , Mrs . Clinton , but the remittance doesn't appear to have arrived yet . 
 If the money was sent by cable , it would have taken about one or two days . But if it was sent by airmail , it would take at least one week . 
 Or would you like us to phone you when the money arrives ? 
 Could you please tell me your phone number , so we'll give you a ring as soon as the remittance has arrived ? 
 Thank you . We'll inform you in time . Goodbye . 
 I'm sorry but we are fully booked . 
 That's fine , but we have only a single room , is that OK ? 
 I am sorry for damaging your car , sir . 
 The car park in this community is over crowded , isn't it ? 
 There aren't enough buses in this city , are there ? 
 That's too much of hassle . We just want a little bigger parking space . 
 No . but I'm gonna . You know , several months ago , I backed into red Honda when parking . 
 No , right here in the parking lot . It was parked right here in your space . The left rearview mirror was smashed . 
 Yes ! How do you know that ? 
 What's the weather today ? 
 What was the weather like yesterday ? 
 What will the weather be like tomorrow ? 
 Could you show me where the ice cream is located ? 
 This is my first time here . 
 I'm glad I asked you . So this is aisle 6 where I can find all the canned fruits and vegetables . 
 Today , you need to pay 20 RIB in handling fees . 
 I must tell you that because your banking has been such a large amount , you need to wait until you leave the country to get any currency back . 
 Yes , totally . It's nice to meet a customer who understands the system . 
 That's right . I know we have a complex system , but you have caught on so quickly . 
 We've been looking forward to your visit . It is a great pleasure for us to have you as our guest . It is always more convenient to discuss things face to face . 
 We've received some similar comments from other Australian firms too . 
 We appreciate your good intention and your effort in pushing the sale of our slippers . As you know , the demand for this item in your market is quite substantial . However , according to our records , the total amount of your order last year was moderate , which does not warrant an agency appointment . Unless you increase the turnover we can hardly appoint you our sole agent . 
 As far as I remember , we sold about 40,000 pairs last year to you alone . Don't you think this annual turnover is rather conserve - time for a sole agent ? 
 Let's put it this way . I propose a sole agency agreement for Ladies and gents plastic slippers ( excluding children's ) for a duration of 3 years ; 60,000 pairs to be sold in the first year , 70,000 pairs in the second year , and 80,000 pairs in the third year , the area is to be within the continent of Australia ( excluding any neighboring island ) , commission 5 % . 
 On the contrary , Mr . London , we value your friendship more than anything else . We both understand our slippers are very popular in your market on account of their superior quality and compete - time price . And with the sole agency in your hand , there will be no competition and you can easily control the market , which would naturally result in bigger sales . I'm sure you can fulfill the agreement without much difficulty . 
 Tomorrow afternoon . 
 OK . Everything is in the bag . 
 Excuse me , what do you want for this bag ? 
 Would you take $ 12 ? 
 13.50 ? 
 Is this your new teacher ? 
 Is she short ? 
 What color are her eyes ? 
 What color is her hair ? 
 And how old is she ? 
 Let me get last week's notes . 
 I couldn't come . 
 I wasn't feeling well . 
 Thanks a lot ; are these all the notes ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Let me help you with that . 
 You really shouldn't be lifting this by yourself . 
 I don't have my homework today . 
 I was really sick . 
 Yes , I probably could . 
 Next class meeting . 
 That would work for me . 
 After you 
 What's the weather like in your country ? I suppose it must be warmer than here . 
 We don't have much snow in winter in Beijing . In fact , we haven't had any so far this winter . The winter is rather long , but the cold is generally not severe . The temperature seldom gets as low as ten below zero Centigrade . 
 About freezing point , I think.But the morning's forecast said that we are going to have a very cold spell in the next few days - and the temperature will probably drop to 10 or 15 degrees below zero . 
 It is considerate of your wife . 
 Fall is the best season in Beijing . It's neither hot nor cold . The sky is clear and blue . There's hardly any wind , only a slight breeze which is hardly noticeable . And we have plenty of sunshine too . 
 Good , you are welcome . 
 I ’ m worried about my daughter . She can ’ t decide about college . 
 I don ’ t mind that . But she disagrees with me about everything . 
 But I just want to give her some tips . 
 I guess you are right . 
 I hope so . 
 He's on the other line , can you hold for a minute ? 
 He'll be right with you . 
 Thanks.Miss Zhang . 
 Really ? I've already opened this one.Say , this is sweater , and it's just what I need to go with my new suit.Thank you ever so much . 
 Yes , I do . 
 Yes , please . Christin . 
 Yes , please . 
 No , thank you . I don't like milk in my coffee . I like black coffee . 
 Yes , I do . 
 Yes , please . 
 I hope that you remembered to send in your last Continued Claim Form . 
 You have to send that form in every two weeks so we that we will know what to pay you . 
 If it is not more than fourteen days past its due date , then you may still mail it in . 
 You can ’ t mail it in early because you don ’ t know , in advance , how much you will be working . 
 Yes , your check will be a little late in getting to you . 
 Not so delicious as before , but it's fine . The soup is tasty but the meat is a little tough . 
 Something's wrong with my air conditioning . 
 So how long do you plan to live here ? 
 Fine by me . Do you know how to read this kind of contract ? 
 Great . When in Rome , you guys know what to do . 
 That about does it . See you in a week . 
 Not much really . It's more of an American tradition , so back home we don't really celebrate it . In fact , I am not even sure of what exactly is being celebrated ! 
 Yeah but , how did this holiday come to be ? 
 And then what did happen ? 
 Interesting ! I am amazed how big and delicious thanksgiving dinners are ! 
 Count me in ! 
 Yeah , this dress is really nice ! How much is it ? 
 One hundred and fifty dollars ? What about this other one over here ? 
 Hmm ... that ’ s a bit out of my price range . Can you give me a better deal ? 
 Well , I don ’ t know . I think I ’ ll shop around . 
 That ’ s still more than I wanted to spend . What if I take both dresses ? 
 I don ’ t know ... It ’ s still a bit pricey ... Thanks anyway . 
 Great ! You ’ Ve got a deal ! 
 How so ? I thought it went fine . 
 I ’ m sorry . I thought we were all pretty much in agreement . 
 Pretty good , Sam . Only the awful weather , you know . 
 Me either , but I ’ m dealing with it anyway . 
 I can ’ t sleep or eat . I have a really bad pain in my tooth ! 
 It bothers me off and on , but it ’ s gotten much worse these past few weeks . 
 My girlfriend told me that I grind my teeth a lot when I sleep . Maybe that is the problem . 
 I use a soft bristle toothbrush . 
 Absolutely . That set it off big time ! 
 We had a fantastic time . 
 No , but we went to the Kennedy Center . 
 No , doing it in the long run will make you an acute man . 
 That's because you are always fixing your eyes on the bald . 
 That's true . I got the news yesterday . 
 You're flattering me . 
 Not bad . I'm confident . And I like challenges . 
 Thank you . 
 OK . Could you please help me to clean them ? 
 Great . At first , you can put the chairs back . 
 Thank you . I'll wash them . 
 Good boy . 
 What fun ! Normally I ’ d love to , but I ’ m afraid I have to work late tonight . We ’ Ve got to get the contract ready for Miss King . 
 Unfortunately , I just can ’ t make it this time . I have to go straight home . It ’ s my second wedding anniversary , and we ’ re supposed to be having a big dinner Susan would kill me if I missed it . 
 Yeah , maybe . Thanks , anyway . Hope you guys have a great time ! 
 I share the same opinion . You are over-weight so it's hard for you to buy clothes . 
 Here is one tailor's shop . Why not order one here ? 
 That cat . 
 It ’ s me , mum , I am sorry . 
 He got a scolding . 
 Surely it's a sound idea , Mr . Joey . But I have a few questions for you first . 
 First , can I know something about your financial situations ? 
 Thank you . And how is your business in the clothing business circle ? 
 Then what do you deal with ? 
 That's nice . They provided us with convenient choice . 
 I'd like to hear that . 
 That sounds attractive , all right , how about that we sign a one year contract ? 
 Can you tell me the time ? I've got an appointment at 8: 30 . 
 Gee ! There's only thirty minutes to go . 
 You tried to seduce me . I fell for you . 
 I am just thinking of it . Maybe I ’ ll go . 
 Yes , are you ? 
 You do know that it's absolutely freezing out , don't you ? I'd put a coat on if I were you . 
 Well , it's started raining since then . Look out the window ! It's pouring rain out there ! 
 Have a look outside for me . Does that look like hail to you ? 
 That's a good idea . But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it . 
 How long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ? 
 Maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse . 
 Good idea . That will help us to warm up . 
 Alright . I'll have a cup of tea waiting for you . 
 You might make a few enemies this way . 
 You mean your friends . I think it's cruel . 
 Hurry ! Get a shot ! ... Hand it over ! 
 Room service . Can I help you ? 
 Certainly . 
 Any drinks ? 
 I like your sweater . It suits you very well . 
 She certainly has the taste . 
 I wonder if the municipal government will take some preventive measures . 
 Have you watched today's news ? 
 Did you hear about last night's blackout ? 
 Some people went looting because of the blackout . 
 People decided to use the blackout to their advantage . 
 I guess they broke into about four stores . 
 There's no evidence of who it was . 
 What kind of music do you like ? 
 Me too . 
 Qi In is . 
 Yes , I like it very much . 
 No problem . 
 Oh , yes , if you like.The large one goes to Washington.The other one I will take with me . All right ? 
 Oh , thank you . Thank you very much . 
 By subway . 
 Yes . There ’ s one on the other side of the building . 
 I ’ m afraid you can ’ t . you ’ Ve to go out there and walk around . 
 I ’ m going to be moving out soon . 
 There ’ s no way that I can stay here . 
 I don ’ t understand why . 
 Why can ’ t I have it back ? 
 You have to give it back to me . 
 But I ’ m not able to live here anymore . 
 Hello . May I speak to Brian , please ? 
 Is this 777-9345 ? 
 Oh , I ’ m so sorry . 
 Hello , Zhang lin ! Fancy meeting you here ! 
 How's life going , Zhang Lin ? 
 Pretty good , thanks . I'm going to see my uncle . 
 Good bye . 
 Of house , what's the matter ? 
 What kind of fruit do you want ? 
 Sure , please give me $ 10 in advance . l Wil have them bought for you . 
 It ’ s broken . I just bought it yesterday , you know , it costs me $ 556 . 
 Mike suggests me to return it . 
 We wish to express our desire to trade with you in leather shoes . 
 Please inform us of your decision as soon as possible . 
 Do you think so ? I don ’ t like girls who look like that . I like girls who are not too slim . If you like her , go and talk to her . 
 He ’ s huge ! He must go to the gym to have a well-built body like that . 
 I don ’ t mind , but I like girls with long hair . 
 Have you ever dated a girl taller than you ? 
 Yes , I have . Perhaps I should go to the gym , like that girl ’ s boyfriend . 
 You just ran a red light . 
 How are you ? 
 Could you tell me how you dealt with it this time ? 
 Did you go to the concert last weekend ? 
 Yes , I did . I enjoyed it a lot.There was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist . 
 I only paid two dollars for mine . 
 Good morning ! 
 I just feel a little tired . You know , it took me 16 hours to get here . 
 That's very kind of you , but I can do without a rest . I have long wanted to have a talk with you about the possibility of business between us . 
 Thank you very much . 
 I believe I will . 
 I'm here on holiday and I don't have a local debit card . Is it possible to withdraw money on my Visa credit card here ? 
 Oh , yes . It's amazing here . I don't think I ever want to go home again ! 
 Fine . Here you go . 
 Is it OK to withdraw USD ? 
 OK , 200 USD , please . 
 Perfect . Thanks ! 
 I would like to check out . 
 Can I pay by credit card ? 
 I heard that you went to the concert the day before ? How did you like it ? 
 Who was the conductor ? 
 Oh , I learned that he is also a legendary violinist . 
 Obviously you did enjoy the concert . 
 Don't just stand outside . Come on in . 
 This is Alex . Remember ? This is Sean . 
 Over there are Stacy and Rebecca . We're all on the school's tennis team . 
 That's my boyfriend Matt . Isn't he cute ? 
 Come on . I'll introduce you two . 
 No.My brother is playing football there . 
 Thank you for your compliments . 
 I want some coffee . 
 What have you got ? 
 I think I'll have a latte , please . 
 How can I be sure your products are of superior quality , as you promised ? 
 But a quality inspection system does not mean that each unit will always be up to the standard . 
 Your salesman also told me that each worker is trained to do quality analysis . Can you tell me a little about that ? 
 Here are the leads from last week's exhibit as a trade show . There are about forty or so that are hot . You should contact them immediately , in the next twenty-four hours if you can . The rest are categorized according to potential and interest.You can see we've got our hot stack , our warm stack , our lukewarm , and our cold but not dead stack . 
 Don't worry , most of the leads on mildly interested , if not strongly interested . We've just got to make sure the Hot ones are contacted right away . And even the contacts that for what ever reason aren't prepared to make an order now , they might be interested in the future . Please be conscanciouss about getting a hold of everyone of these leads . We've spent a big chunk of marketing budget to find these people . I don't want our investment to go down the drain . 
 Are you free tomorrow night ? 
 Shall we have dinner together ? 
 Yes , I do . I know a place that has excellent food . 
 I've really enjoyed your party , Lisa . 
 I wish I could stay longer , but I must be going . 
 Well , sir , I think I have made a mistake . I will take it back to the kitchen right now . 
 Yes , sir . I'm really so sorry about that . 
 Give me a shot of whisky and soda . 
 Certainly without ice . Ice will spoil the taste . 
 Whoa , when . 
 May I take your order ? 
 Yes , take your time , please . 
 Fine . 
 The special today is steak . 
 What would you like to go with your steak ? 
 I see . What would you like for dessert ? 
 Our philosophy teacher is very humorous . 
 No , not at all.The examples he gives are very interesting . 
 Hello again ! Here's another fruit tray for you . 
 I make each one a little different . It's a way for me to express my creativity ! 
 Oh , look at your table ! I'll help you clear it off . 
 Enjoy your food ! Bye ! 
 Okay ! I'll do the dishes . 
 My tooth is killing me ! 
 It just started hurting me last night . 
 I think one of my fillings might be coming loose . 
 I have an electric toothbrush . 
 Oh yeah , when I do that , it hurts a lot more ! 
 Are you crazy ? The papers make everybody listless . I don't think you are the exception 
 I'd better exercise my body too.My limbs are rusty now . 
 Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ? 
 I agree with you there , but you price is unreasonable . 
 I don't think we will be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % . 
 Don't you agree with me that in the long run moderate prices we bring about large sales and more profit ? 
 Is that all ? 
 I'm sorry , we can't handle the price you offered . 
 Certainly . Come and choose the cloth . 
 $ 150 including the cloth . 
 How sweet ... if you make me some more toast , I'll let you use my new retro toaster ... 
 Isn't the shape cool ? 
 Hey ! What's that smell ? Are you burning the toast ? 
 Married whom ? 
 Come on . Tell me what happened . 
 Is that true ? But anyhow , it's none of our business , isn't it ? 
 Looks not bad . 
 Yes , It's pleasantly quiet here . 
 Where can we have our laundry done ? 
 Does the hotel run its own laundry service ? 
 I see . Is the telephone on the table good for outside calls ? 
 Can I get a city map at the hotel ? 
 I'm here to open a Current Account with your bank . 
 Here you go . Is there a minimum amount I need to pay in ? 
 OK , how long does it need to be ? I'm not very good with remembering long numbers . 
 Oh , God . It ’ s late . I ’ m afraid I have to leave . 
 That ’ s very kind of you . But if I don ’ t go now I ’ ll miss the last bus . 
 Thank you for your hospitality . 
 How about next time we meet at my place ? And I ’ ll treat you to Chinese food . I know how much you like it . We can order in and watch video too . Anything you like , I promise . 
 Well . I really do have to go . 
 See you tomorrow . 
 Yeah , Richard said something to me that I didn't appreciate . 
 He asked me how long it took me to learn English . 
 Yeah , but I get that sometimes . It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U . S . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes . 
 You know , Richard isn't such a bad guy . He made the comment out of ignorance , not malice . 
 I told him 28 years . And , he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week . He was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it . 
 Yeah , I'm pretty sure since I then asked him how long it took him to learn English . 
 He said , ' 36 years , ' and we both laughed about it . He apologized and now , it's all good . 
 Is that the Japanese Restaurant ? 
 What kind of food do you serve ? 
 I see . That sounds fine . Until what time are you open ? 
 Fine . Well be there before then . 
 How far do we have to go ? 
 The traffic is not very heavy on this high way , is it ? So I ’ m sure we ’ ll make it . 
 Don ’ t worry . There ’ s plenty of time yet . 
 Right . 
 Er , good morning , yes , er ... 
 Oh , yes.Erm , well , could you tell me your name , please ? 
 Oh , yes.Erm , well , what exactly is it that interests you about the job ? 
 Really , hmmmm.Erm , well , could you perhaps tell me a little about yourself ? 
 Where exactly have you been working , please ? 
 The tall one ? Sure , that's Drive , he works with Lily . 
 I'm not sure , he is a manager I think . 
 Well , he has already taken you know , that's his wife right there . 
 How long did you have in mind ? 
 Seeing as next month is our slow season , that should not be a problem . 
 Just make sure to turn in all the necessary paperwork to ensure there are no problems with the days you want to take off . 
 Certainly.here you are . 
 Very smart ! 
 Yes , I have read the Filling Instruction carefully , since you showed me it last week . 
 The essence of filing I remember is to bring together in a single folder or file all papers relating to a particular subject . And outgoing and incoming letters are kept in this file cabinet . 
 And each file should be named clearly , either in block capitals or in jet black typed capitals . 
 A card index is very important in the filing system . It is a most helpful friend to a secretary , so it must be kept handy and up to date . 
 Hello , may I speak to Alice please ? 
 I've been trying to call you all day . 
 It's okay . 
 Oh , I just wanted to see if you wanted to hang out tomorrow . 
 Maybe we can go see a movie or something . 
 I'll see you tomorrow then . 
 Have you seen the tower in front of us . That's the famous Eiffel Tower . It was built in 1889 for the World's Fair . 
 It stands 320m ( 1050ft ) high and held the record as the world's tallest structure until 1930 . 
 Yes , the towel was named after its designer Gustave Eiffel . 
 Hi , Steven . Do you have time and chat with me ? 
 The new couple next door divorced . Have you heard about it ? 
 I guess it Is Mrs Hill . She sued for divorce on the grounds of her husband's misconduct with his secretary . 
 OK . I close my mouth . 
 A boss likes him a lot . He says Jim is a good team player . 
 Maybe we all should learn something from him . 
 Morning , Mary . I haven't seen you in a long time . What's up ? 
 So you don't travel a lot now ? 
 It's certainly a popular hobby . I know a lot of people love stamps . 
 I believe collecting stamps has something similar to traveling right ? 
 Well , every stamp has a story to tell . 
 Good . 
 There's a lot to share when you have a common interest . 
 Ok , good luck . See you 
 Man ! That car almost hit me ! 
 Do you need help with something ? 
 Is there something wrong ? 
 Did you check the computer ? 
 Did it say anything ? 
 I ’ m sure I can get it from another library . 
 I ’ ll let you know when I get the book in . 
 Good morning , my name is Martin . You've applied for the Laboratory Assistant's position , right ? 
 Can you tell me why you replied to our advertisement ? 
 Do you know exactly what you would be doing as a Laboratory Assistant ? 
 What sort of student do you regard yourself as ? Did you enjoy studying while you were at school ? 
 What were your favorite subjects at school ? 
 Do you have any plans for further study ? 
 Have you ever had a job before ? 
 We have a lot of other applicants for this position . Why do you think that you deserve to get the job ? 
 I think I have asked you everything I wanted to . Thank you for coming along to the interview . 
 We'll be in touch with you by telephone or by mail within a week . Well . Goodbye . 
 Mum , I have something for you today . 
 Don't you remember ? Today is March 8th . It's Women's Day . 
 Now , close your eyes . ( Mum closes her eyes and Steven puts the present in her hand . ) 
 Happy Women's Day . I love you forever , Mum . 
 I'm from Canada , originally . 
 Montreal . 
 We moved here when I was fourteen . 
 Well , I went to high school here , but I went to college in Texas . 
 No , I traveled for a while in Europe after college , and then I lived in France . 
 Let's see ... That was about six years ago . 
 I studied French . Anyway ... that's enough about me.How about you ? Were you born in L . A . ? 
 What a good idea ! 
 We could go to more places this time , if you liked . 
 When shall we go and look ? 
 No , let's go on Saturday . 
 Where shall we go ? 
 No , I don't like that place . Why don't we try the garage Martin recommended ? 
 Bye , mom ! 
 OK . Bye ! 
 Alright . See ya ! 
 Ok , see you after school ... 
 Mom ? 
 I ... I can ’ t breathe . 
 I don't know ! Can I park my car now ? 
 Fine ! I'll be back by nine then . Don't worry . 
 Finally ! 
 Susan has got married . 
 Her marriage was a hole and corner affair . 
 I have no idea . Maybe she didn ’ t want to let us ... , so ... 
 What crime did I commit ? 
 I am innocent . 
 Have you ever been to America ? 
 You'd like it . 
 I want to have a suit made to measure . 
 One Made in 100 % black Barathea wool , with 5 Celtic buttons . 
 I'm going to go to the concession stand and get some popcorn and Coke . 
 What are you talking about ? We always eat the stuff here . 
 But what's a movie without munchies ? 
 I would like to buy some local handcrafts as gifts to my friends and relatives . 
 Well , the tapestry is delicate and beautiful . 
 How much is it ? 
 Mmm , it is reasonable . Look at this set of table wear , it is so beautiful ! 
 This silver vase is a good ornament for the living room . 
 I will take the tapestry , the set of table wear and the vase . 
 All right . I will take one . 
 Most people think that wealth means success . But from my point of view , the problem should be viewed from two aspects . On the one hand , wealth is a very important thing to measure success . The ability to make money , to some extent , signifies your knowledge , your capability , the value of your labor , etc .. With the development of our economy and industry , more and more people are pursuing money these days . And in toda / s society , If you have money , you seem to have everything . But this is not the case . I think success , on the other hand , also means satisfaction from work . It also means that you can get respect from others . 
 Ideally , I ’ d like to have a job that will allow me to work from home several days a week . I ’ m the kind of person who can set priorities , work well independently , and set my own pace . I actually successfully worked from home for several months in my current job when a problematic pregnancy forced me to stay in bed . But I realize that many employers do not have experience with employees who work from home , and I have , of course , performed very successfully in a traditional office setting . 
 Very good . Basically , once our sales plan was put together , I had a great deal of freedom to handle my sales in the way I felt best . 
 He always says I am a hard worker with consciousness of responsibility , sufficient education , and enough experience . 
 They would say I am a dependable friend and a capable colleague . 
 It ’ s very nice meeting you , too . 
 What would you like to ask me ? 
 I feel that people can love who they want . 
 Of course ! 
 I can ’ t help that . 
 I hope so . 
 Morning . 
 Yes . You can take No . 846 from here , but you have to get off at Nanchengmen stop and change to No . 106 . 
 Actually , if you go to the bus stop in the next block , you can take No . 105 which will let you right off in front of the zoo gate . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Yeah ! Do all these people work in the company ? Everyone and their dog is here ! 
 Can we just sit wherever we want ? 
 Hmm . We don't exactly have the best seats in the house , do we ? 
 Www ! That weirdo ? ! He really gives me the creeps ! 
 I just hope he doesn't start bragging again ! 
 Me , either ! Who decides how much money we get ? 
 I'm Patti Whitney.Isn ' t this convention great ? 
 No , I've been coming for the last 3 years.Each year keeps getting better.Where are you from ? 
 I'm from the other side of the coast--Los Angeles . 
 Have you been to California ? 
 How many kids do you have ? 
 Well , California ’ s changed over the last little while.You should come back out sometime . 
 Sure . I ’ Ve never seen a dragon boat race . 
 As long as I don ’ t have to row . 
 Your reservation is right . Please get a ticket booking form from there and fill it . 
 $ 800 . 
 Surely of course . Give me your card please . 
 A teacher . 
 I wouldn't like to be a singer , but I'd like to become a music teacher to teach children to sing , That dream developed in my mind when I was a child . 
 I'm quite sure . I've always loved working with children . 
 Well , it ’ s not like that . We just e-mail , it ’ s really nothing . On top of which I am definitely thinking about stopping because it ’ s getting ... 
 Confusing . But not , because it ’ s nothing . 
 Oh , listen , I can ’ t even remember . Ok , on my birthday , I wandered into over 30 rooms , for a joke , sort of and he was there , and we started chatting ... 
 Oh , books , and music , how much we both love New York . Harmless , harmless , meaningless . Bouquets of sharpened pencils . Oh . 
 Forget it . We don ’ t talk about anything personal , so I don ’ t know his name or what he does or where he lives exactly . So it ’ ll be really easy for me to stop seeing him , because I ’ m not ... 
 There will be a parents ' meeting in our class this Saturday and I am worried about it . 
 I didn't do well in last exams . If my father knows it , he will beat me up . 
 You know that my father is irritable . 
 Good idea . 
 What ’ s wrong ? Slow down or you are gonna give yourself a heart attack . 
 Take it easy ! Let ’ s go to the mall , window shop a little and see if there is anything she might like . 
 That ’ s where you ’ re making a big mistake ! You can ’ t just guess peoples ’ likes or sizes ! Especially with clothes or jewelry . On top of that , I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her . At the same time you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like ! 
 Yeah , tell me about it . I know ! Your mom is trying to learn Spanish , right ? Why don ’ t you get her a gift certificate for this great website I saw called SpanishPod . 
 I ’ m betting the New York Yankees win . How about you ? 
 Sorry , guys . Could I just interrupt for a moment ? My money is on the Yankees ! 
 Hey , Ken . Good luck if you already put your money on the Red Sox . 
 What a pin-up she is ! 
 That's incredible ! She has such a sharp figure . 
 Where do you usually do your shopping , Mrs . Lane ? 
 How do you find the prices there ? 
 I see you have bought some coffee . Would you mind telling me how much you paid for it ? 
 Congratulations on the new house ! 
 Well , you guys work hard for it . It ’ s really beautiful . 
 It seems that you get antsy when you hear I praise another guy . 
 How come you think of him that way ? 
 I have no reason to distrust him . He's never caused any harm . 
 Nothing smells a rat . I told you that he's an all-right guy . 
 Hey , Gary , great to see you again . Please have a seat . So tell me , what seems to be the problem ? 
 Well , let ’ s have a look . Open wide . Hmm ... this doesn ’ t look good . Well , it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose . We ’ ll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse , and the crown probably needs to be refitted . I ’ m going to order some x-rays . 
 No , not at all ! Just lay back and relax . 
 Could I see that automatic camera ? 
 Where is it made ? 
 Is it expensive ? 
 I'll take this one . 
 Yes , give me two rolls of Kodak color film . 
 Good morning , everybody . Welcome to IAM Technology . I'm very pleased so many of you could make it here today . My name's Sam Weiss . I'm the Production Manager . I'd like to show you the layout of the factory before we go and visit it . As you can see from this diagram , everything is under one roof . We've designed it this way to help the flow of materials and to avoid bottlenecks . 
 what do you think about the public service advertisement for quiting smoking ? 
 why not ? 
 it's a pun . They use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking . 
 I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking . 
 perhaps you're right , , though . Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow . 
 that's a good point . I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad . 
 Mr . Wang , I want to apologize for being late again this morning . I just can't get up in time for work . 
 I guess I'll have to buy a new alarm clock . 
 What ? Are you sure about that ? 
 Where is he going ? 
 What a pity ! 
 I know that . But it's pity for us to lose such a good neighbour . You know I always appreciate Tom's company . 
 Can you tell me where the pots and pans are ? 
 Oh , thank you . 
 No , thanks . I already have credit cards . 
 That's a nice discount . 
 Thank you , but I'm just browsing today . 
 What a boring film ! 
 And the plot is so simple . 
 When does the library close ? 
 Does it close at that time every day ? 
 Is the library open on Saturdays ? 
 What time do you open and close on Saturday ? 
 Okay . Thank you very much . 
 No , that ’ s all . Thanks . 
 Yes , I've got to work overtime . 
 Let's take a roundabout way . 
 Look , traffic jam again ! 
 Is Petti there ? 
 Wrong number ? Are you sure ? I called yesterday and she was there . 
 That's impossible . I remember the number clearly . Isn't this 763-4565 ? 
 Really ? I ' m so sorry I bothered you . I ' ll try again . 
 Yeah . I guess it does . Sorry again for bothering you . 
 How did you do on your BELTS exam ? 
 That's excellent ! Have you received your conditional offers yet ? 
 Do you know where the visa office is ? 
 It's just near the Dong Si Shi Tiao subway stop . 
 I'd like to pay some money in using my card , please . 
 Here it is . I usually use the machine , but there seems to be such a long queue at the moment . 
 I'll look forward to that , I can't stand queuing . 
 1,000 RIB , it should all be there . 
 OK , done . When will it show in my account ? Not for withdrawal , I mean just registered . 
 That's fine . OK . Thanks . 
 well , first of all , it ’ s much bigger . It has the same number of rooms , but each room is larger . We also have a larger garden , which our dog loves , of course ! 
 yes . One bedroom is for my wife and i . there ’ s another for our daughter . My wife wants to use the third one as a guest room , but I ’ d like to make it into a study . Our daughter is also keen on 
 that ’ s one of the main reason we chose that particular house . The kitchen and dining room are together . It ’ s really large . 
 yes , they are . That ’ s very important to us . We like to live in a home with plenty of natural light . Each room has large windows . 
 no , we don ’ t . we wish we had one . That ’ s the only thing we wanted , but don ’ t have . The area is very nice and the neighbours seem friendly . 
 it ’ s a very quiet neighbourhood . There ’ s some traffic , but not much . It ’ s not very difficult to get to the city centre , but you must remember to turn left and right at the right places or yo 
 Yeah . She's a healthy beautiful girl . 
 She is tired , but getting a lot of rest now . 
 I'm just glad there were no complications . 
 It's been a week , and I haven't slept that well . 
 Yeah , but it's so hard . I have to work , and then go home and take care of my wife and the baby . I'm going to get sick at this rate . 
 That's true . I should make sure my wife and baby stay healthy during this time . 
 Rather nice . 
 It was raining when I left New York . 
 What part hurts ? 
 Well , maybe you broke it . But what I'm worried about is this cut . 
 C'mon . Just don't move . 
 We don't have a decent First Aid Kit , do we ? 
 There's some tape , iodine , and cloth bandages . I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . What we need is a tourniquet . 
 Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut . 
 Alright , alright . How did you cut this so bad ? 
 We'll have to get you to a hospital . I can ride you on the back of my bike . 
 Yes , I almost slid too.Alright . This tourniquet is tight . How does it feel ? 
 Alright , I'm twisting it around . You tell me when to stop . 
 Hi , how ’ re you doing ? 
 Oh , what ’ s the matter ? 
 Oh , that ’ s too bad . Why don ’ t you take some aspirin ? 
 Well , it ’ s necessary for you to see a doctor . 
 Well , you ’ d better get some rest . 
 Bye . 
 What do we have for the dinner now ? 
 Do you feed rabbits ? 
 Where is my favorite white bread ? Is it in refrigerator ? 
 Do you prepare some dessert for me ? 
 Are you trying to change our eating patterns ? 
 We want to order 3,000 cases and hope to deliver the goods in two equal lots . 
 We'd like you to execute the first delivery by June 30 and the second delivery by August 15 . 
 I can agree to that . 
 Right . 
 Let's hope it's the beginning of a long and prosperous relationship . 
 Yes Anthony , come on in . Have a seat . 
 Well , Anthony , this is not going to be an easy conversation.The company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment . 
 I don ’ t want to beat around the bush so I ’ m just gonna come out with it . We are going to have to let you go . 
 I ’ m sorry but , to be honest , you are a terrible employee ! 
 Anthony , you were caught making international calls from the office phone , you called in sick in eight times this month and you smell like alcohol ! 
 We're going to pay by check . 
 If you think it is necessary . 
 OK , no problem . 
 How are you doing ? 
 Go for it . 
 I voted this morning . 
 I can ’ t tell you that . 
 That is private information . 
 All I can tell you is our next President got my vote . 
 I went to the beach with my friends and had a barbecue there . 
 Sure . I think it ’ s a fantastic place to go . 
 It sure is . 
 I ’ m deeply grateful for all you ’ Ve done . 
 Could you cover for me on Tuesday ? I'm not coming back until Wednesday . 
 We're going to the beach for the weekend . 
 No . Just some fun in the sun . We really need to get away and relax for a few days . 
 What did you think of the film ? 
 Yes , I liked it , too . Did you like the acting ? 
 Not really . I thought it was disappointing . 
 Do you think so ? I don't like it very much . I found it rather uncomfortable . 
 Thank you , Lisa . 
 Oh , great ! I love it ! You know I've been expecting this for a long time . 
 Come here , let me introduce some friends to you . 
 We try to recycle as much as we can . 
 We have to send it to landfill . It's very expensive because the government recently introduced a landfill tax so we're planning to build a new incineration plant next year to burn our waste . 
 Yes , you're right , it does . But we believe it's less harmful to the environment than landfill 
 Yes , I can help you with that . Pick up the receiver and hit one of the buttons . Do you hear a tone ? 
 Next you dial 9 on the keypad . You should hear the tone change . Did you hear it change ? 
 OK . Well , after you get the line to change you have an outside line . Who are you trying to call ? 
 To call a number on the outside you now just dial the number . For inside calls , punch in the extension number . Has someone given you an extension list ? 
 All of the extensions are listed on the wall chart over there if you ever need help . 
 I am going to the bank . I need to cash some checks . 
 Why are you going there ? 
 I see . Will you bring a lot of money with you ? 
 Do you have the bank card in Japan ? 
 That sounds really convenient . Do you pay extra money to enjoy this service ? 
 Great ! I will apply for a credit card when I go to the bank later . 
 Hello , thank you for calling Bradford and Sons . This is Tracy speaking , How may I help you ? 
 Just a moment . I'll check to see if she is at her desk.May I tell her who is calling ? 
 Thank you , Mr.Burton.Can you please hold for a moment ? I'll check to see if she is available . 
 I'm sorry , Ms.Jenkins is away from her desk.She has already left for lunch.Would you like to leave a message for her ? 
 2 hours . 
 The plane must fuel before flying to Paris . 
 Surely of course . 
 I went to Croydon . 
 No , I went for an interview . 
 Yes , I got a job as a Management Trainee . 
 How do you want to advertise the opening ? 
 All right . I suggest posting the ad Monday through Friday . 
 And job seekers will certainly check the paper over on Tuesday . 
 Such concern for the company , Craig ! I'm impressed . 
 Sure . What's your date of delivery ? 
 What about the balance of the order ? Can they also arrive at our company quickly ? 
 Can you deliver them earlier ? 
 Possibly , subject to quality and delivery guarantees . 
 I was looking forward to something a bit more substantial . As you know , we have long-time cooperation . 
 Well , let's shake on that and draw up the details of the contract . 
 What happened with that guy at the cafe ? 
 But you ’ re crazy about him ? 
 Why don ’ t you run off with him ? What are you waiting for ? 
 Really ? 
 Oh , let me guess . Through the internet ? 
 Hmm . You ’ Ve got mail . 
 I've worked in the Production Department for two years . 
 Working with my colleagues , we were able to increase the production efficiency by 5 % . 
 Yes . I got a bachelor's degree in English from Beijing University . 
 I can get more promotion in your company . 
 Thank you . 
 Sure , here you are . 
 We have fruit cake , cream cake and chestnut cake . 
 Of course , we do . 
 Thank you . Here's a present for you . 
 I think I may rent out this apartment that I found . 
 I was looking through the ads today , and I found it in there . 
 Yeah , and it ’ s affordable too . 
 First of all , it ’ s absolutely gorgeous . 
 It ’ s only $ 725 a month . 
 I know it is . 
 Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set ? 
 You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order . 
 I think the only thing is toner . Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . Anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time . 
 David , imagine meeting you here ! 
 All right ! I stayed up yesterday and waited for your vegetables . I stole your peaches and flowers . 
 How many vegetables do you steal today ? 
 So funny . By stealing , I forgot all my sorrows and pressure from work . 
 I really want to be far away from the reality now . 
 Lucy , what are your priorities when buying a car ? 
 What about the environmental factors ? 
 Sure they are . Some hi-tech devices are built in to make sure they pollute less . Some of these green cars have not become standard . So the production costs are still high . But anyway , we should make efforts to start with . 
 I have done something like that before . 
 I think I am . I left the job only because it was too far from my home . 
 Certainly.Let ' s to and meet him now . 
 How was my singing ? 
 Were you able to attend Friday night's basketball game ? 
 You should have been there . It was intense . 
 Our team was victorious . 
 It was a great game . 
 Our team won 101-98 . 
 That's the reason it was such a great game . 
 Good morning , I ’ m Daniel . I ’ m applying for the positon of manager . 
 I got to know your company through such famous brands as LUX , LIPTON and WALLS . After making a customer survey , I was glad to find out how your products are appreciated by millions of Chinese . 
 It ’ s the job I ’ m interested in . And your company is the best-known . Although I don ’ t have much experience as a manager , the job description you sent to me was very interesting . It ’ s a job I ’ Ve been dreaming of and I feel suited to fill it . 
 I don ’ t think so . As the saying goes , “ A great oak needs deep roots . ” I ’ m really interested in this job . 
 Hello . This is Hamilton ’ s Heating and cooling service . Can I help you ? 
 What ’ s the problem ? 
 Maybe the compressor is going bad . 
 Sure . But there is a minimum charge of $ 60 for a service visit . If your freezer needs parts , there will be an additional charge . 
 All right . let me check our technician ’ s schedules . I ’ ll call you back and let you know what time we can send a service technician to your house . What is your phone number ? 
 Okay . I ’ ll call you right back . 
 Bye . 
 Hey , that was quite the presentation ! Honestly , I was completely blown away by your strategy outline . I've gotta say , Alex , you really wowed me today . 
 No , I think you deserve some recognition here ; I mean , if I look back on your previous presentations , this is a huge improvement . 
 And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies . I really appreciate you taking the time to think though my suggestions . 
 Well , I just wanted to say well done . Really you did a great job . 
 Hi . I would like to get an internet plan for my house . 
 I have no idea what kbps means . I just want to be able to get online , play games and chat with my friends . Oh , and watch movies online as well . 
 Do I have to pay an installation fee ? 
 Awesome ! 
 Yes , but can you show me the other colour ones ? 
 No , I don't like the brown one . 
 Good , I like it . 
 It is extremely beautiful.This is the very thing I've been dreaming of.Please put in a gift box for me . 
 Peter is a bag lady now . 
 He was so rich in the past . Maybe he ’ s regretting his past mistakes now . 
 Amanda , how do you like this peaked cap ? 
 But I think this one fits me Well . Why don't you try on the sombrero in black ? 
 Why didn't you go to school yesterday ? 
 What was your problem ? 
 Are you feeling any better ? 
 I'm going to the store , would you like any Pesto Pistol ? 
 Excuse me , can I have a look at the green coat ? 
 Yes , I like the style.Can I try this on ? 
 May I help you ? 
 What's the problem ? 
 When ? 
 What did he take ? 
 Did you see his face ? 
 Could you pick him out of a line-up ? 
 Have you find any job that you are interested in ? 
 There ’ s not a very high demand for that kind of job , isn ’ t there ? 
 That ’ s a good idea . You have plenty of experience in marketing , don ’ t you ? 
 By the way , I saw a job in the paper this morning that you might be interested in . 
 It is a job at an advertisement company . 
 Anyway , it is worth trying . 
 I'd like to have some more . It's really good . 
 Good afternoon , Mr . Green . 
 I'm sorry , but he's not in , he's gone out on business . 
 Please come in for a cup of coffee . 
 Excuse me , will you change me some money , please ? 
 I'd like to change these dollars into RIB . Would you please tell me the exchange rate between American dollar and RIB ? 
 500 dollars , please . 
 OK . Thank you for your help . That's very nice of you . 
 Mr . Wilson . I'm very glad we reached the agreement at last . Now I'd like to propose a toast to the further development of our cooperation . 
 Bottoms up ! 
 Have you declared your income and are you prepared to pay tax ? 
 I don't really know . Why not ask the accountant or the lawyer of the law firm ? They will tell you which is subject or not subject to taxation . He can even help you avoid paying tax legally . 
 Certainly . No one who evades tax can escape from their detection.They ' ll check your income through computers . You'd better make a declaration to the tax authorities as soon as possible . If you fail to meet the deadline , you will be fined . 
 no , I haven ’ t . I can ’ t think of anything to get him . 
 I know . He bought me that beautiful sweater for my birthday . It was exactly what I wanted . And it fit me perfectly ! 
 that doesn ’ t sound like a great present . 
 let ’ s think . He loves football , doesn ’ t he ? I saw signed photographs of famous footballers in a shop near hear . Let ’ s go and have a look . You know which team he supports , don ’ t you ? 
 it ’ ll be an expensive present , but we can share the cost . 
 yes . He always get us special gift . We should repay his kindness . 
 Engaged ? She ’ s married . 
 Yes , Mother , but my arm is longer . 
 Yes . First I'll have tomato juice . 
 I'll have the lamb chops , well-done , please . 
 I need to return a book . 
 I want to check these books out . 
 That ’ s all . 
 It ’ s right here . 
 Yes . That ’ s it . 
 All right . Have a good night . 
 I'm fine , Katherine . I just stayed up late last night working on my Chinese . 
 You did ? Do tell me . I've spent all these months trying to learn something new about it , but I've made little progress ! 
 So you're learning Chinese songs ? 
 That's a real achievement . How did you do that ? 
 It makes sense . 
 Can Join you , Katherine ? I do want to have a try . 
 Great . Do you think we need a Chinese dictionary ? 
 Ok . I will bring it with me . 
 I hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field . Since my major was international banking , I really hope to work at a bank . 
 Because your bank is a new one , I think I'll be given more opportunities , and the working conditions and surroundings are so excellent here . 
 I expect to work hard , madam . 
 No , I enjoy travelling . 
 I've been really stressed . It's the end of the year and I've got so much stuff to do ! I feel like I'm drowning in work . 
 It's seriously affecting my life ! I can't sleep , I don't have much of an appetite and my husband says I've been kind of short tempered . Other people seem to handle stress okay ... why am I so weak ? 
 Yeah , but I don't see any tigers or leopards roaming around our office . My stress is just about silly paperwork ! 
 So a deadline will cause that same reaction ? 
 So the life of a cave woman was less stressful than my life ? 
 Glad to meet you mr smith my name is jenny . 
 Oh , I'm a tourist . May I go inside and look around ? 
 When can I go inside then ? 
 I have a terrible toothache . 
 This one here . 
 Can you fill it ? 
 Then I might as well have it done now . 
 Do you like tea ? 
 Tea does good to people's health . There are many kinds of tea.Say , black tea , green tea , scented tea , brick tea , milk tea , Jas - mine tea , chrysanthemum tea and so on . 
 Yeah , but scented tea is now in fashion . 
 I'm trying to send the instruction book by E-mail , but I failed many , many times . And there is something wrong with the net maybe . It's so slow . 
 I am used to editing with Word 2003 , and there are many pictures in the book . 
 I merely know how to send the direct letter . But I am not familiar with the attachment . 
 Can I mail the book if it is a large file ? 
 What if it exceeds the capacity ? 
 What's going on here ? 
 Master Li ? Who's that ? 
 I will ! I could use some good luck ! 
 let me give you a little advice . You know what the topics are going to be , so prepares what you would like to say in advance . 
 you have to be realistic . Not everyone is going to agree with you , but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion . 
 we could chat about the topic before class . I could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking . 
 that ’ s easy . Express possibilities . People will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle . 
 the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say . They will reply to your statements , but you can ’ t be sure how . 
 When did you finish ? 
 Well , I ’ m glad to hear it . Have a cup of coffee ! 
 I am great . How are you ? 
 Yeah , me too ! What are you thinking you would like to do ? 
 Have you gone out on any interviews so far ? 
 Did you see the posting for the electrician apprentice program ? 
 Let ’ s go check it out again ! 
 Thank you . Here is a copy of the Tour Guide Certificate of mine . 
 Yes , but I am on holidays this week . 
 I am bilingual , English and Russian . 
 Yeah , I've been working out a lot . 
 For a year and a half . 
 Has it been that long ? 
 I usually go every other day for about 3 hours . 
 Yeah , I used to work out for an hour a day 4 times a week , and I saw no results . This is what you have to do to get noticeable results . 
 Just think of it as a hobby . Then it's actually fun . 
 Sure . Speaking of photos , what type of film will be the best ? You know , I'm planning a tour to Jiuzhaigou Valley . 
 Thank you so much . You're an expert . 
 I am . 
 Fine , thanks . 
 Don't make it too short . I just want a trim . 
 Yes , I do.That looks good . It's not too short.It ' s just right . How much do I owe you ? 
 Here is 4 dollars , keep the change . 
 The product's selling points is its advanced technoledge . 
 Why is the price so high ? 
 Model of computers aren't compatible ? 
 Maybe after the next generation of technology comes out , the price of this model will become more affordable . 
 True , but our focus has never been affordability anyway . Coastwise , we may not be very competitive , but qualitywise , we definitely have an edge . 
 This model has advanced technoledge , superior components , it is compact , and it's a top-quality product . 
 Are you new here ? 
 Are you a freshman in college ? 
 What school did you transfer from ? 
 What made you transfer ? 
 Did you like PCC ? 
 Good luck here . 
 Look , there is traffic accident over there . 
 The old man is knocked down by the bicycle . 
 Well , I prefer active rather than passive training . For example , I like the training offered by a financial software company from which we bought the newest updated virgin . They sent the programmers to demonstrate how to do and then ask us to practice . All employees receiving this training were in the same meeting room , so we could communicate with each other . We had a lot of fun learning together . It helps to build up the work relation among colleagues . 
 Of course , it is much better than just giving us some reading materials or information via the internet . 
 How nice these frames are ! 
 I want to try on this pair . 
 That's right . 
 I agree , but I like wire frames . 
 What's the fare , please ? 
 What ? You're overcharging me ! 
 Then something must be wrong with the meter . 
 I really liked it ! 
 What did you enjoy the most ? 
 The fish was pretty special , but I loved the dessert . 
 I really felt that the service was exceptionally good . 
 I am looking forward to returning to this restaurant . 
 Yes . What can I do for you ? 
 All right . Have you got an idea about what type to buy ? 
 Can you remember them all ? 
 It may comfort you to know that many people attended his viewing . 
 In times of loss , it is often hard to pick up the phone . But his whole family was here . 
 And he was so young , with so much life to look forward to . 
 This sheet tells the visiting hours and funeral time and location . 
 I'd like to , but the photocopier is out of order . 
 It broke down one year ago . 
 The pile is over ten feet high . I am afraid it will fall all over and bury you underneath it if I put this file on top of it . 
 What do you expect ? I've been working for you for three years , and you've never given me a holiday . I don't feel well today , because I have a terrible headache . I am not in the mood for being gentle and polite . If you can't stand it , it's your problem . I am not going to change , because I think it suits you best . 
 I apologize for forgetting myself , but I do need some time off . 
 What's the matter , sir ? 
 No , I haven't sir . 
 But , sir , I didn't drink at all . 
 OK . I'll blow . 
 But I ... 
 Would you like to come by and play bridge ? 
 Well , to tell the truth , I don't really feel like it tonight . I had a pretty hard day and I'm sort of tired . 
 Oh , we always go to the movies . Can't we do something different ? 
 Let's see . How do you feel about playing bridge ? 
 Well , shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over , and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff . 
 Hello , Janet . It's me ... Oh , fine . Just fine . Say , Janet , I was wondering if you and Tom were doing anything tonight ... No ? Well . would you like to come by our place and play a few hands of bridge ? 
 Uh , I can see a red double decker bus . It's the kind of bus you'll see very often in London . In fact I know this bus is from London because I can see the names , Chelsea , Sloan Square , Victoria , Herring Cross . These are all areas in London . Um , so obviously the bus is in London . 
 Yeah , yeah , yeah . many times . Many times . When I was younger , you used to get double-decker all over England but now you only tend to see them in the big cities . 
 Well , it depends on the journey . It's .. I guess it's not too expensive , but the minimum price you would pay is , for a short journey , is about a pound . 
 Hmm , yeah , well this girl here at the back , that's leaning on the door , um , she looks really bored , actually . Maybe she is going to work or something and she doesn't want to go ! 
 Uh , well , no , not really , because I haven't worked in England for a long time , so I haven't taken a bus for a long time . 
 Um , yes , sometimes . Sometimes . 
 I have no idea what I'm doing . 
 Whoa ! We're changing partners now ? Where do I go ? 
 Whoa ! Oh , no ! 
 Michael Johnson doesn ’ t look graceful , but he sure is powerful . 
 What are you talking about ? ! He ’ s passed every drug test he ’ s taken ! 
 Just because Ben Johnson was juiced up doesn ’ t mean all athletes are . 
 Good afternoon , Sam . 
 What are you going to do tomorrow ? 
 I would like to go skating . Feel like going with me ? 
 I think so . Fresh air , white snow . It's so comfortable . 
 It doesn't matter , I can teach you . 
 I really admire you , Diana . 
 you are really happy and able to achieve high scores at school . 
 isn't there anything else ? 
 you must have a high IQ score . 
 go ahead . 
 seriously ? But you are such a genius . 
 well , perhaps you're right . Sometimes EQ matters more than IQ . 
 oh , thank you . I'm going to the library , are you coming ? 
 Good morning . I ’ m Liu Yi , from China XYZ Company . We have an appointment with Mr . Thomas . 
 Thank you . 
 Should each of us write separately ? 
 Wow . That girl who brings the fruit is really pretty ! I wish she wouldn't have rushed off so fast ... 
 " Tie a Yellow Ribbon on the Old Oak Tree " ? ! Where did you learn that song ? 
 I'm sorry , but I can't ! That's something my grandmother would sing ! 
 Here you are . 
 I'm sure you'll look grand when it's done.Would you like to have a shampoo after a while ? 
 How about oil or spray ? 
 The May Day holiday is coming . Have you made any plan ? Are you going to stay here or go out for a traveling ? 
 Where have you planned to go ? 
 Then which will be your first choice ? 
 I have decided to go to Tasha . 
 By plane . 
 Yes , do you like it ? 
 Yt looks good on the outside , but the inside is a different story . It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again . 
 Well , first of all , it needs a new engine , which is extremely expensive . 
 It must have been a few years ago now . 
 They do . Once my son was born , there was no reason to drive this car anymore . It's only a two-seater , you know ! 
 The heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer ! 
 The brakes don't really work that well anymore either . 
 It costs more than you think to run a car---especially when there are so many things wrong with it ! 
 Well , we didn't ask for this room service maybe someone else ask it , I ’ m sure . 
 Yes , please . 
 We paid for the room service already in our room . 
 No , we got no receipt , and we pay it on the spot ! 
 I'm off to Barcelona for a week . 
 Yes , here you go . I don't need a visa to go to Spain , do I ? 
 That's good advice . 
 Are there any seats available by the emergency exits ? 
 Ok . I'll take that one then . 
 I like to travel light so I just have this one . 
 Yes , please . That's a fantastic idea . Which gate do I need to go to ? 
 Excuse me , how do I get to the Forbidden City ? 
 Is it far ? 
 Thank you . 
 Pleased to see you , too , Mr . Brown . 
 Yes , a very pleasant journey , thank you . 
 So it is , I've come again to renew our sole agency agreement for another 2 years . 
 I'm glad you're satisfied with our work . I can assure you we've spared no effort and spent quite a sum of money in pushing the sales of your products . 
 Thank you . 
 That is the result of our hard work . Well , what annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then ? 
 No , no . That's too big a number to be acceptable . Let's put it at 450 pieces . And we'll strive to sell more , of course . We wish to add another clause . For every 50 pieces sold in excess of the quota , we'll get 1 % more in commission for our efforts . 
 I suppose all the other terms remain unchanged . 
 No , certainly not . That's a reasonable restriction . 
 Yes , we've already prepared one . I've brought it with me . I'll put it forward when we talk with the manufacturers tomorrow . 
 Good . 
 No , it's at counter 1 , right over there . 
 Yes . 
 Do you want to send it by air or by regular mail ? 
 I ’ ll have to weigh it first . 120 yuan , please . 
 Your change , please . 
 May I help you ? 
 I ’ m Smith , the manager of Human Resources Department . May I ask your name ? 
 Would you tell me what education background you have ? 
 Do you have any experience in this field ? 
 OK . Do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken English ? 
 OK . I will accept you for a three months-period of probation . Is this satisfactory ? 
 I want to have Mexican food for dinner . 
 OK , you win . You pick the restaurant this time . 
 Hmm . Your file shows that you watched ' Titanic ' Monday night . 
 Well , as they say , garbage in , garbage out . Let me correct this error , please . 
 When I deleted the $ 10 , the computer automatically added a $ 2 service charge . 
 Sir , if it makes you feel any better , the $ 2 service fee used to be $ 5 . 
 Unfortunately , sir , you'll have to pay the $ 2 , whether you like it or not . 
 Is he ? Yes . He looks pale , is there anything I can do for him ? 
 Certainly . 
 Well , yes . I ’ ll give him the medicine too . 
 John , I was looking through some magazines for ideas about where we might go on vacation this year . 
 You can't be serious ! 
 After a year together , I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together . 
 You know , now that I think about it , I really don't have much more to say to you at all ! 
 I didn't see you at Mr . Johnson's class today . 
 Why ? 
 May I help you , madam ? 
 Follow me , please . Here it is . What do you want ? 
 OK . Wait a second , please . 
 Yes , of course . 
 Anything else ? 
 It's located in the suburbs ? Well even though that sounds like a steal , I really want something downtown . 
 I know , that's my problem . What do you think I should do ? 
 Oh , great idea ! 
 Yes , something just opened up . 
 It's a one-bedroom , one-bathroom apartment . 
 We're redecorating our living room . 
 First , we're going to change the curtains , then we're going to paint the walls . 
 Pale yellow . 
 We're going to put in some new furniture . 
 Sure , Richard . What ’ s on your mind ? 
 Well , why don ’ t we sit down and work out the numbers ? We can always scale down the bonuses if we have to . 
 I tried it for a half-hour.It was interesting , but ... well ... I couldn't really do it . 
 I couldn't even stand on it and hold the sail . I probably fell down fifty times . 
 Yes , it was really stupid . 
 It was fifty dollars for a half-hour . 
 What do you mean ? It's expensive ! 
 Hi , welcome to the Belt Department . Can I help you today ? 
 Then , perhaps a leather belt would work . Come here . Let me show you some . 
 Good morning . Venus Real Estate Agency . 
 Do you have any particular type of apartment in mind ? 
 Are you renting it alone or with company ? 
 A one-bedroom apartment has one bedroom , a living room , a kitchen and a bathroom . 
 No , but a fridge and a stove . 
 Yes , it ’ s a one-year lease . And $ 200 a week with one month refundable deposit . 
 Would Friday morning be alright ? 
 Good-bye . 
 Neither have I . 
 Yes , we must . What have you been doing since I last saw you ? 
 I've been learning Japanese every evening . 
 I hope to visit Japan next year . 
 Yes , let's go into the dance-hall and ask if we can take dancing-lessons . 
 Do you have spare time tonight ? 
 There will be a live show of football tonight . 
 AC Milan versus Real Madrid . 
 Absolutely . 
 Great idea ! Here we go ! 
 Glad to meet you again , Mrs Hao . You are so kind . 
 Oh , it's a real Chinese meal . When in Rome , do as the Romans do . I'd take the chopsticks . 
 Beer , please . Oh , there are so many dishes . 
 Let's hope for good cooperation between us . 
 She means business , for sure . 
 We'd better get back to work . 
 What can I do for you , sir ? 
 OK , may I take your size ? 
 We have three dressings for salad . Which one would you like ? 
 We have Italian , French and Thousand Island . 
 Good morning , sir . How may I help you ? 
 Certainly , sir . Would you like to open a time deposit savings account or a checking account ? 
 No problem , sir . What sort of time deposit account would you like to open ? 
 The minimum time period is three months . The longer the period , the higher the interest rate . If you withdraw your money before time is up , there are penalties . 
 Is she coming ? 
 They are announcing your flight . You'd better board the plane . 
 I am just reminding you about the time . You don't want to miss the plane , do you ? 
 Name it and I'll do it for you . 
 I've got it . 
 I am just doing what I think I should do . 
 This isn't like you ... Well , I hope you will have a nice flight and a successful start in business 
 Why do you go fishing so often ? 
 Mr . : There are two things that you'll need to know . 
 Mr . : The school has three lunch periods , and the kids are divided into three groups to go to lunch . 
 Mr . : Furthermore , when you are dismissed in the afternoon , you will be divided into two waves . 
 Mr . : The school parking lot is not big enough for all the school buses to come in at one time . So only half the buses come in first to pick up the first wave's students . 
 This is great , isn't it ? 
 We should do this more often . 
 Next please . 
 That'll be five yuan forty , please . 
 Sure , I have . Will you join ? 
 You are right . Our company ’ s Christmas party has always been an amazing occasion for everybody to relax and get to know each other better . It is also a time to make new friends and do some networking . 
 No , it will not be formal at all . It is a fun time . You will love the game show . Please dress casually . Usually there is an over abandon of drinks , so be careful with that . 
 Where to , sir . 
 Star Hotel . OK . 
 About 20 minutes . 
 How much is the fare ? 
 I really want to make something for dinner . 
 I haven't the slightest clue what I'm going to make . 
 I don't know how to make that . 
 That sounds fairly simple , but how do I cook it ? 
 What's next ? 
 What's the next thing I need to do ? 
 Dan More's Office , how may I help you ? 
 May I tell him who's calling ? 
 Just a minute please , Mr . White . 
 Good morning . Could you tell me the times of trains to London , please ? 
 What time does the 7:59 train get to London ? 
 What about coming back ? I'd like to come back at about 7 p . m . 
 Mmm , how much is a return ticket ? 
 An ordinary return , please . 
 Good morning . I'd like to speak to Peter . Chen Please . 
 This is Tim . Hunter from Hunter industries . 
 We have an appointment for this afternoon . Mr . Chen will know why I'm calling . 
 Now we arrive at the Cambridge University , it is one of the oldest universities in the world . 
 In 2009 Cambridge will come to its eight hundredth anniversary . 
 Is Jack still staying idle everyday ? 
 Really ? He is so competent now . 
 Now , if I look here I see that you completed a BA in English ? 
 Yes , I ’ m pleased to see that you also got a distinction . 
 Well , it looks like his encouragement paid off Rebecca . So how about extracurricular activities at University ? 
 What did that involve ? 
 I ’ m sure . Okay , now let ’ s move on to your work experience , shall we ? 
 Thank you very much for your invitation . 
 I'd like to say goodbye to you . 
 I need a taxi to the airport . 
 What's wrong with Debbie today ? She seems upset about something . 
 What kind of cuisine do you have ? 
 Hangzhou food . 
 All right . I'll take it . 
 Yes , I like using chopsticks . 
 Yes , but I don't know what soup you have . 
 Good . I prefer beef soup . 
 Save it until you've served dishes . 
 morning , Mr . Emory . I was hoping to set up an appointment with you for sometime this week . 
 Fine , Mr . Emory . Would next Monday at 4:00 o ’ clock be all right for you ? 
 How's the weather today ? 
 I really don't think this weather will last . 
 Do you know that song ? 
 The song you hear now . 
 Elvis Presley . Don't you recognize his voice ? 
 Good idea . 
 It's love all . 
 Can you tell which team seems to win ? 
 Yes.Our guest team is really tough . 
 Jessica is going back to Holland next week . I've been thinking a lot about what to give her as a parting gift , but I still have no clue . 
 yeah , that's her . We had a lot of wonderful times together . She is really a special friend , and I want to get her something meaningful . 
 I don't think so . That way it would lose all the charm . I want it to be a surprise . I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last . 
 hmm , I think I've got an idea . Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home . 
 I hope so . I'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase . I hope it won't cause her trouble at the border . 
 Michael Jackson's coming to town . 
 You bet it is . And we got four thousand for our car space ! Awesome ! 
 That's just what was running through my mind . Moonlight and dancing . 
 Come on baby , let's dance ! 
 What seems to be the problem ? 
 What ? You've got to be kidding me ! 
 Of course I did . As recognition for a job well done . Once a month I invite the most productive employee to dinner . 
 I think she's misinterpreted my intentions . What happens now ? 
 I understand that . But I hope that we can get to the bottom fo this and show Miss Brown that she misunderstood my reaction . 
 Wish you have a blast . 
 We need to know whether you have the special training . 
 How about your experience ? 
 Mr.Sun , would you mind if I ask you some questions , which may sound impolite ? 
 Can you tell me how old you are ? 
 Are you married ? 
 Can you tell me something about your family ? 
 Why are you so late ? 
 That's enough . Sit down . 
 It is a way to make a living , but beyond this it's a way of fulfilling one's development . It can prove your ability . 
 I left the job because of expiry of my employment contract . Besides I have accumulated a lot of experience in this sort of job . I want to seek better jobs . 
 Um ... Uh ... I'm just looking , thanks . 
 No , no , no . I'm just browsing . Thanks anyway . 
 Um ... well , where's the men's shoe department ? 
 How are you making out these days ? 
 I heard that Jim lost 100 yuan . Do you know that ? 
 Really ? 
 But some classmates said you took the money . 
 Look at my eyes . 
 Return the money to Jim and make an apology . I think he will forgive you . 
 Mr . Lee , all ready to check out ? We ’ Ve already prepared your bill , and housekeeping has done a quick check of the room . How will you be paying ? 
 The bill is itemized , so take some time to look through it and make sure we ’ Ve charged you for the correct services . Most of your extra charges were for phone calls and room service . 
 That ’ s the mini-bar . Each day we check what ’ s missing and restock it . The items you consume are put on your bill . 
 Those are for pay-per-view movies . Each time you selected a movie , the entertainment system prompted you to confirm that you really wanted it , right ? 
 What are you doing this weekend ? 
 Is it a family thing or just friends ? 
 Is your great uncle Rick going to be there ? He is really funny . 
 You mean your sister ? 
 You lost me . 
 What is this for ? 
 Okay , thanks . 
 Our company is going to do some cutbacks soon . 
 I met with the supervisor just this morning . I don't know , but I am a little worried . Who do you think will get sacked ? 
 No , it's not going to be George . I don't think it's Andy either . He is involved with the boss's sister in-law . And you know how whipped our boss is . 
 Lisa ? No way . I've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . You know rumors can't come out from nowhere . 
 No , that would be crazy . But then who will it be ? Oh dear , it must be me . I should have known it ! Why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . What should I do ? I've got a family to support . 
 Hello , Mary . Nice day , isn't it ? 
 I do feel like an outdoor exercise . After all , we haven't had such a beautiful day for a long time . 
 OK . It's delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh . 
 Are you kidding ? Don't you see many people over there ? Just on your right . 
 Ah , you changed so fast . 
 A haircut and a shave , please . 
 Short on both sides . Not so much off at the back . 
 Yes , please . 
 Well . I would like my hair cut shorter on the temples . 
 Yes , thanks . 
 No , thanks . But I'd like a facial massage . 
 Now where should I pay the money ? 
 Hello . May I speak to Mary , please ? 
 Hi , Mary . This is Tom . 
 Just fine . I say . Aren't you busy tomorrow evening ? 
 Well , uh ... why not dine out together and go to the movies ? 
 Okay . I'll pick you up at 6:00 . 
 Madam , what can I do for you ? 
 I get it . And ... ? 
 How about adding some pictures of our products for the introduction ? 
 OK , I will prepare it right now . 
 Please trust me . I will finish it very well . 
 Yes , it is.It was taken just before I was leaving for college . 
 How time flies ! I'll not see twenty again . 
 But the rain has been pouring down for two days . We ’ Ve both caught colds . 
 How unlucky ! Let ’ s pack our bags and go home . 
 It's my new pendant . Do you like it ? 
 Yes , in a monkey suit . It's adorable ! 
 Yeah . Two-toned , white and yellow . 
 Thank you very much for your kindness . 
 No , he left nothing . 
 Good morning , Mr . Yang . Thank you very much . Can I work now ? 
 I am sorry , I am just too excited and forget it . Can I look it through ? 
 Well , I am sorry that I have a question . There is no remuneration item in this agreement . Can you tell me something about it ? 
 But you didn ’ t tell me in the interview . 
 Okay , I can ’ t decide whether sign or not now . Can you give me some time to think it over ? 
 Yes . Thank you very much . Mr . Yang . 
 I've gotten a few . 
 I've gotten about six . 
 Yes , I've paid all of them off . 
 It's like $ 130 each ticket . 
 I got a parking ticket the other day . 
 I'm going to do that as soon as possible . 
 I wanted to talk to you about that , Mr . Eng . Mr . Emory would prefer to keep the deadline as is . We can start earlier if you ’ d like . 
 Certainly , sir . We can wait another day or two . 
 No , it's no use . 
 I know . She won't change my grade . 
 Yes . The German engineer would never dreamed that the hand - supported scooter he invented several years ago to solve his traffic problems would become so fashionable in the Occident within a few years and even spread to Japan and China . 
 Small and exquisite in size , easy to operate , foldable and easy to carry are its charms . 
 When was America discovered , Tony ? 
 America was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492 . 
 All right . Ask me a question now . 
 That's easy . It was invented by Edison . 
 I can't answer that . But I think Mars will be visited by men before theed of this century . 
 All right . What is the nearest planet to the sun ? 
 Ladies and gentlemen , now we are in the National Forest Park . 
 The stone is a prehistoric log . It was turned to stone millions of years ago . 
 But it's the truth . 
 We don't have them here , I'm afraid . Ginkgo trees grow well only in cold weather . 
 They are poplar trees . They are widely used in our lives . 
 How do you feel about that restaurant ? 
 What did you dislike the most ? 
 Did you think that the food was any good ? 
 The service certainly could have been better . 
 Is this a restaurant that you want to come back to ? 
 Is your lady beautiful ? Since I came here from the country , I've not seen her close . Tell me , is she beautiful ? 
 And , her lips ? 
 And her voice like a lark's song ? 
 Oh , she sings too ? 
 You received a letter in the mail . 
 Who ’ s the letter from ? 
 I want to know what it says . 
 Are you serious ? 
 Are you okay ? 
 I am really sorry to hear that . 
 I have a sweet tooth . Chocolate is my favorite . So how about you ? 
 Hello , may I help you ? 
 Photograph or document ? 
 Show me your document , please . 
 Ah , it is clear enough to send . 
 It'll only take a couple of minutes . 
 Twenty yuan . 
 The keys will be turned in on Tuesday night . The house will be yours at that time . 
 You can tell the utility company what day you are moving in , and they will transfer the utilities to your name . 
 Take advantage of the house being empty to clean and paint . It will be harder to do after the furniture and appliances have arrived . 
 That will be good . You are going to want your stove and refrigerator right away . 
 I think I am getting a fever and will be too sick to help you . Here , feel how hot my head is ! 
 Why tell me ? She has nothing to do with me ! 
 No , I couldn't care less ! 
 That's because you cheated . 
 Yes , you do . 
 I bought it online . 
 yes . I buy most of my daily necessities online . 
 yes , much better . You can log in a website , browse through many items and categories comfortably at home , order the goods , pay by credit or debit card , and the goods will be delivered to your home . 
 and you can still go " window shopping " just like in a real shopping mall . 
 yes , most of the shops are closed at 22 or even earlier , but the internet operates 24 hours a day , seven days a week , and can be accessed anywhere . 
 sure . You can buy almost anything you can think of . 
 How beautiful the flower is ! 
 You like it . Well , I'll gather in for you . 
 Where it is ? 
 You look run down , Brian . 
 Well , you wanna take a sick leave ? All you need now is a good , long rest . 
 Good idea . 
 I'm clipping coupons . 
 It's a good way to save money . 
 How much ? Last week I save $ 10 on food . 
 We only accept payment by irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents . 
 I'm afraid not . We insist on a letter of credit . 
 Consult your bank and see if they will reduce the required deposit to a minimum . 
 Well , Mrs . Wang , you must be aware that an irrevocable letter of cred it gives the exporter the additional protection of the bank er's guarantee . We always require L / C for our exports . And the other way round , we pay by L / C for our imports . 
 I'm very sorry , Mrs . Wang . But I'm afraid I can't promise you even that . As I've said , we require payment by L / C . 
 Yes.Would tomorrow morning be all right with you ? 
 I'm afraid he's fully engaged.Could you make it another time ? 
 Whoa , whoa , take it easy , relax . Geez , you ’ re sweating like a pig ! What ’ s going on ? 
 What are you talking about ? It wasn ’ t more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family ! 
 Let ’ s think this through . First of all , you cannot leave Amy at the altar . Not only will she be humiliated and kill you , but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams ! Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this ? Second of all , you are just getting cold feet . You know deep down inside that you want to marry her , so cut the crap and do it ! 
 Great ! Phew ! That was a close one ! You had me going there for a minute I thought I was gonna have to slap some sense into you . 
 You know I did . 
 I voted for Obama , of course ! 
 I knew he would win . 
 He was the top candidate . 
 That just goes to show that America is finally turning over a new leaf . 
 I ’ m excited that Barack Obama is our President . 
 There is a warrant out for your arrest . 
 You have a bench warrant . 
 Have you missed a court date ? 
 I can't help you . 
 A lot of things aren't fair . That's life . 
 You have the right to an attorney . 
 Really ? That's so great . Congratulations . 
 That's really exciting . How many months are you pregnant ? 
 Are you going to find out if it is a boy or a girl ? 
 Maybe it's more exciting not knowing . 
 There are so many things you have to prepare for . 
 It really must be an exciting time for you guys . 
 Passport , please ! 
 Are you Chinese ? 
 Where in China are you from ? 
 There are a lot of people from China visiting right now . 
 How long do you plan to stay ? 
 All right . Here's your passport . Welcome to Australia . 
 Mark . Where have you been ? I ’ Ve been calling you all morning . 
 What ? So you blew me off yesterday and today over a stupid video game ? What game is so important that you have no time for me anymore ? What are you playing ? 
 You ’ Ve been wasting your time on this ? I can ’ t believe it ! It doesn ’ t even look fun or challenging ! 
 Fine ! 
 Can you bring me something ? I am totally hooked on this game ! 
 What is that ? It looks like something from a swamp ! 
 You know , healthy eating doesn't have to make you gag . 
 Have you ever tried it ? Or are you just going to believe the sales lady ? 
 It may take less time , but I don't know about easier . Yuck . 
 Let's just sit in the back . We can still hear the service from here . 
 They're probably up front . The preacher's about to speak . Let's listen . 
 Oh , how I wish this all wasn't happening ! 
 Cool down , man . Everyone is fed up with the rush-hour traffic . But life isn't really all that . You should take the initiative and make some changes first . 
 I recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus . It may offer you many benefits . First , it's good for your health . I'm afraid it's not necessary for me to further elaborate . While lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising , a bike ride to work not only builds you up , but also makes full use of time . You might as well sleep out for a longer hour . 
 Well , such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like Beijing . I think a still more desirable benefit is psychological . Bicycling home after work can help release your stress . Life in the offices is miserable . You just sit there in a daze , gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents . Why don't you give a full play to your energy after work ? Enjoy the speed on the road . Just think , you are flashing past the poles with your own energy . How great ! 
 You are expected to write the educational experience about your high school and college , even the time span . 
 Job intentions refer to the kind of job you are eager to get , for example , accounting , marketing . 
 You've got a point there . It is a custom and good manners to serve tea to a guest who comes to pay a visit . There is no need to ask if he needs it or not , or if he wants something else . It might be an insult to the guest if he is left sitting there without being served tea . 
 It wouldn't be considered rude behavior if he doesn't even take a single drop . But he'd better receive the teacup with both hands and bow his thanks when the cup is brought before his face . When the host pours hot water into his cup , he may also choose to tap his index finger on the table , meaning " Thanks " . No matter if he likes it or not , it is impolite if he doesn't even lay a finger on the cup . 
 Sure . The guest is welcomed by being served tea . But if after chatting for a while , the host asks servants or family members to serve a new cup of tea , or add some hot water , he is giving another signal . 
 More often than not , the understatement is ' I'm afraid it's time you leave ' . 
 I wish I could , but I'm busy . I'm going to work at a soup kitchen tonight . 
 Nah , it's a place where homelesspeople go to eat . 
 Well , the minister at my church told us about it , and it seemed interesting . I thought I'd try it once , and if I didn't like it I'd stop . 
 It's simple . All we do is prepare some food , usually sandwiches and some fruit , and give it out to them at the soup kitchen . 
 Only about two hours , for a couple of days a month . Why don't you give it a try ? 
 Come on , it's easy , and it'll make you feel good . Why don't you come with me tonight ? 
 We take very good care of this particular pump . It's a crucial part of our process . We clean it and flush it through at the end of every shift , We check the high pressure seals , recalibrate the gauges and lubricate all moving parts weekly . We replace the gaskets every month . 
 Well , from experience we can predict the lifespan of different components . We try to replace components before they fail or wear out . This prevents the equipment from breaking down . It also saves us a lot of trouble ! 
 Of course . 
 Things were different this time . I sat by a math genius . 
 B :: Come on ! I just took a glance . 
 I cannot understand why she always helps and supports her brother . 
 Because he is often in trouble . 
 Oh , I see . 
 I think it's the postman.Will you go and open the door ? 
 Hello , are you Chinese ? 
 I'm from America . Are you settling in all right ? 
 I live in my uncle's house . He came here ten years ago . 
 I think it's just a matter of getting used to it . 
 Have you heard the news ? 
 Deborah had her baby last week . 
 I thought you heard . 
 She was a cute 8 pounds 6 ounces . 
 I know , you should really go and see her and the baby . 
 I just wanted to let you know what happened . 
 Hi . I ’ m here for flight 514 returning to Beijing but the board shows there is a delay.How long of a delay is expected ? 
 Do you think it ’ s safe to leave to get a quick bite ? 
 What seems to be the problem ? 
 Umm ... You know ... Actually I was thinking of trying another airline . No need to hold my seat . 
 I have many hobbies . I like almost all kinds of sports and I also like to listen to classical music . 
 I like playing basketball . Basketball is a very exciting game because it keeps you alert and I also enjoy the team spirit of basketball . 
 I like the novels of Dickens very much . I've read almost all of them in Chinese translation . 
 Yes , I like listening to Beethoven's works . 
 I like all kinds as long as they are exciting . 
 Well , right now , we can't afford internet use in the rooms . But you can go to the web bar in our hotel . It's on the 12 floor . 
 Come in , come in , what can I do for you ? 
 Yes , I am applying on it . 
 Aren't you a bit young ? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up . 
 Well , if you think you are ready , I'll let you enroll . 
 You don't have to play that record so loud , do you ? 
 Yes . And please ask me the next time you want to use something . 
 Yes , sir . Where would you like to go ? 
 Is it the one on Xi Shut Street ? 
 Hi , Andy . I am going to Isabel ’ s . Are you coming ? 
 That is no problem at all . Isabel ’ s is having a clearance sale , and today is the last day . You don't want to miss such a good chance , do you ? 
 All right , but hurry up . It takes you hours to change . 
 I think so . They don't sell shoddy cloth for one thing . 
 She already bought that evening gown . 
 Yesterday . She wore that gown last night , and showed it off to everybody at Mr . Mile ’ s party . 
 Hurry up , will you ? We ’ ll have to go to the gas station first . 
 I have a parking ticket to pay for . 
 Yes , I remembered to bring my ticket with me today . 
 I didn't bring my ID . 
 What do you need my ID for ? 
 All right , I see what you mean . 
 Will everything be cleared from my record ? 
 Can I have my money back on this skirt ? 
 Yes , this is defective . See ? I didn't notice this hole when I bought it . 
 If you have exactly the same one-same color , same design , and same size , of course . 
 Miss , please give something to drink . 
 Do you have whisky ? 
 Well , in that case please give me some free drink . 
 I'm sorry to make you wait . What did you decide ? 
 Trust me , it's worth it . With the " Love , Amy Card " , you'll get a 20 percent discount on everything in the store , every time you shop ! 
 Yes ! And there are more bargains . See these pajamas ? If you buy a pair now , you get this teddy bear as a gift ! 
 Excuse me , sir ? 
 I'm afraid you can't smoke here . 
 Can't you see the notes here ? 
 It says No smoking . 
 I'm looking for some lipsticks . Do you still have some in peach rose ? 
 Great . I'll take one . 
 Wow . That sounds like a bargain . I'm running low on facial moisturizer and powder . Could you ring those up for me along with the lipstick ? 
 That ’ s all . 
 Would you please tell me the exact problem , sir ? 
 Oh , my gosh , they're back ? Another room at once , sir , plus a full refund , of course . 
 Sir , our guests are our reason for being . 
 No foot gives out scent . 
 Never mind , the odour of my feet will quicken their eating speed . 
 Don ’ t pretend you are a good God . 
 I've never experienced such a kind of feeling . 
 Have you heard Jenny divorced her French husband ? 
 Yes . They used to be joined at the hip . 
 That ’ s true . She said they often argued over nickel-and-dime things . 
 You said it . You know , they fell in love at the first sight and quickly jumped into marriage . 
 Definitely . Just hope Jenny can recover from the pain of divorce soon . 
 I'm sick of it , too . 
 It's no use complaining.If we had got enough money , we wouldn't put up with it ! 
 You , too . Where did you get your new hat ? 
 Yes . It's a birthday present from my husband ! 
 He'll come out with surprises . Just wait and see . Look at that woman , with the white chiffon ! 
 Yes . I like the dress . It must be the latest fashion . Look , the hem has lowered , and the waist narrowed . 
 Yes . She dressed with an individual flair . I rather envy her . 
 I quite agree with you.See the woman there ? I dare say she hasn't got any eyes . How could she match the mauve gown with the green handbag ? And all that jewelry ! 
 So what ? It only makes her look cheap and vulgar . 
 You're quite slim . In fact , if you were one of those starlets , the movie company would say you have a fabulous figure . 
 Oh , my shoes pinch me . Let's find a seat and sit a while . 
 The buck stops here . 
 Definitely . I need to have enough time to have a rest on this weekend . We worked like bees in the whole working days . 
 Let me think . Oh , awful ! I still have not finished the chart which was assigned by Mr . Wharton on Friday . So that task will make my busy . 
 So what ? 
 Hello . I want to buy some RIB , is it OK to use US dollars ? 
 I think 250 dollars should be sufficient . 
 Oh , right , of course . Here you go . 
 It's correct . Is there any way I can change it back before I leave the country ? 
 That's wonderful news , thanks for all your help . 
 Yes . I'd like to make a plane reservation to Shanghai , China . 
 Via Kiang . I'd like to leave on May 5th . 
 Well , I need an economy ticket . 
 Single . What's the fare , PLS ? 
 I see . Is my ticket confirmed then ? 
 Thank you . 
 Five . Besides my parents and me , there are my brother and sister . 
 15 . 
 He ’ s not quite 25 . 
 Yes . 
 No . But I write to them often . 
 Once a month . 
 We have a team to make itineraries of the tour , evaluate the value of it for one tourist and recommend the routine for different tourists . 
 Yes . There are selected itineraries for rich and high-tasted people , common routine for people who are on trade observation tour , and excursion routine for people who have limited time for sightseeing . 
 Hi , Ms . Seymour ? It ’ s Allan Parker . I ’ Ve been waiting to call you and thank you for all your help last week . 
 Well , I want to let your boss know that she ’ d better hold on to you ! You ’ re a hard worker ! 
 Do you want to know the honest answer ? 
 You had pretty bad scores . 
 You failed . 
 There are a couple of reasons why you didn't pass . 
 To sum it all up , you really just don't know how to drive . 
 Sure you can , in about two and a half weeks . 
 I went to school today . Did you go to school ? 
 That's horrible . I'd be happy to give you the assignments from English class . 
 Don't mention it . 
 That is greatly appreciated and I hope you feel well enough to go to school tomorrow . 
 What ? What ’ s the good news ? 
 That ’ s wonderful ! You must be really proud of him ! 
 Yes , here's your key . The bellboy will take you to your room . 
 Look , who's here , Peter ! 
 Just got back.Good to see you ! 
 May we see the wine list please ? 
 That sounds pretty good ! How much is it ? 
 I'd like a bottle please . 
 Here you go . 
 Would you like some drinks ? 
 We have various kinds of wine . As for an appetizer , I advise you to order white wine or dry white wine . 
 Can you name some festivals of religious nature ? 
 What about historic festivals ? 
 How many parking tickets have you gotten before ? 
 How many ? 
 Have you paid off your parking tickets ? 
 How much do you have to pay for the ticket ? 
 That's a lot of money . 
 Well , you better make sure you pay it off . 
 Mr . Brown , are your children always kicking up a row like this ? I cannot concentrate on my paper . 
 I ’ m afraid if the noise goes on , I shall have no alternative but to leave . 
 Here's some flowers , love . Happy Valentine's Day . 
 This is let you know that I still you after all this years . I knew there are some up and down when I married you , but through at all , you've always been may my Valentine . 
 I don't think I say this enough , but I want to thank you for your kind listen patience , you ' Ve always been there for me . 
 I am so glad we met one another . 
 It ’ s true . You should be happy about that . 
 No , I haven't got one . My employment petition hasn't been approved yet . 
 Ok , I see . 
 What are you collecting donations for ? 
 How much are you planning on raising ? 
 What kind of fundraisers are you doing ? 
 You should try actual fundraisers , too . 
 Try having a car wash or selling candy . 
 I know . It ’ ll also help you make more money . 
 But mum , we're watching this movie . 
 Just 10 more minutes . 
 Sure , Sherry . Sorry to have kept you waiting . If you hadn ’ t told me , I probably would have just forgotten all about them . 
 There you are . 
 Yes , my name is Max Richards . May I please speak to George Nelson ? I have already called several times . It seems I always catch him out of the office . 
 I'm sorry , I didn't hear you clearly . Could you repeat that please ? 
 Can I leave a message for him please ? 
 My name is Max Richards , my phone number is 898-3423 . Could you ask him to call me back as soon as he gets back , please ? I have a rather timely matter to discuss with him . 
 Yes , please let him know I would like to discuss the Girard case with him . 
 I am sure you will find our prices are most competitive . Here is our offer . All the prices on the list are firm . If your order is a sizeable one , we could reconsider our prices . 
 As a rule , we don't allow any commission . However , as an encouragement for businesses , we will allow you a 3 % commission . 
 By the coming September . 
 Certainly ! 
 Yes . I would like to cash my travelers ' check . Here you are . 
 In tens and twenties , please . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Yes . I'm going to the Untied States for travel . What places do you recommend ? 
 Someone suggests that I should go to Seattle and Hawaii . 
 And Seattle is the home of Microsoft and Boeing . That must be a great place . I can't miss it . 
 What is it ? What happened ? 
 No , it can't be . Really ? Who ? 
 What did you do ? 
 Did he leave when you left ? 
 What did you do ? 
 That's about five blocks . And around corners too.So he was definitely following you . 
 Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . 
 Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything . 
 Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police.But for now , just try not to worry . 
 You seem to have all the jitters about Jane . 
 Keep your fingers crossed . She'll bring home the bacon . 
 Have you followed the value of dollar lately ? 
 It's really frustrating , isn't it ? I have the same problem . I would feel a lot better if the currency was a little more stable . With the way the dollar plummeting lately , my securities have gone up in smoke . 
 What we really should be making investment in is the Euro . I've followed the Euro's progress over the last quarter , I think it's about time to buy in . 
 Are you kidding ? The Yen is in worse shape than the Dollar ! 
 It is impossible . You cheated on me . 
 Shut up ! 
 But you have had lily already ? You should have told me about her , but you didn't . 
 Leave me ! Go away ! 
 Hello , doctor . 
 I've got a backache . 
 No , I don't . I've never had a bad one before . 
 About four days ago . 
 Can you give me some medicine ? It's very painful .

 I am very nervous about signing my escrow papers . 
 What should I have brought with me ? 
 I feel a little overwhelmed by so many papers . 
 My boyfriend is an attorney and told me that I could fax him anything if I had a question . 
 Is this the last thing that I will need to do before the house becomes mine ? 
 OK , Ann , you spent quite a bit of time in Australia recently so why don't you talk about that ? 
 Mm-hm . How long were you there ? 
 Oh , OK . 
 So , did you , did you lose your finger ? 
 Almost . Ah , you're lucky . Um , it's funny , you go in the water and you worry about sharks , but not clams . 
 Will you be going back to Australia soon ? 
 In spring , people are feeling refreshed . They take off their heavy winter clothes and walk with a straight back and light steps . They feel they are full of spirits and energy . 
 Well , when summer comes , the weather is hot and the leaves turn darkgreen ; the sun is blazing and the air is threatening . No one would like to stay in the open air for long . 
 I myself like very much to listen to the singing of some of the insects , especially the singing of cicadas . 
 And you can hear singing and laughing everywhere ! People are happy in autumn because autumn brings them harvest and richness and prosperity ! 
 Well , it's hard to say . For the fields and rivers , winter is a relaxing season , but for farmers , I think they might take a rest physically , but mentally they are still busy thinking , planning and calculating for the working of the next year . 
 How much are you planning to buy ? 
 Cool ! Can I come ? 
 But not enough space for me ? 
 Billy ... 
 Can I help you ? 
 uh ... Yes . Turn right , then take the second turning on your left . 
 It ’ s about fifteen minutes ’ walk . That ’ s all . 
 Yes . It ’ s on this street . Keep walking for two blocks and it ’ s on the corner on the right . 
 You are welcome . Good luck . 
 Hey ! Fred , you are five minutes earlier than me today . Usually , you don't . 
 What's your meaning ? 
 You are a thief ? 
 You mean it is a still virtual game . Your friends steal your vegetables time and time again , and you take theirs as well , right ? 
 Don't be addicted to the game . It's not good for your job . 
 Thank you , Wendy . I hope you'll be able to make it to the wedding . 
 What a lovely day , isn't it ? 
 I hope it stays like this . 
 Is the weather usually like this here ? 
 What's the weather like in winter ? 
 I wonder what it ’ s going to be like tomorrow . 
 Neither too cold , nor too hot . 
 Yes , especially in spring . 
 Once , when I was a child . 
 Now and then . 
 What are you doing this weekend ? 
 I cannot stay here any more minutes . 
 Tom is making so much noise . I have not a bit of peace and quiet all evening . 
 Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 I'm awfully sorry , sir . I do apologize . A ten-year-old boy and a mother live upstairs . Maybe the boy is a little bit naughty . 
 No problem , sir . We'll manage it . 
 No , she isn't . My girlfriend hates red . 
 A classmate of mine . 
 What's wrong with it ? 
 Can you tell me what the charge was ? 
 Are you positive that you didn't buy the purse ? 
 I'm very sorry . When was this purchase made ? 
 We're going to investigate this claim . 
 You won't have to pay for anything . 
 Thank you very much , Mr . Smith . I am very happy that I ’ ll be a member of your team . May I see the agreement first ? 
 OK , thank you . Well , I find that the salary level in this agreement is not like what you have said in the interview . Can you give me some explanations ? 
 Can we add up this item to the agreement ? 
 No , thank you . Shall we sign the agreement now ? 
 Thank you . I'll work hard . 
 That's so sweet of you . We definitely want it . 
 OK . How does seven o'clock this evening sound ? 
 Where are you living ? 
 Do you move a lot ? 
 I really want to go to the beach this weekend . 
 I heard that it's going to be warm this weekend . 
 I believe so . 
 I know . I really want to go to the beach . 
 You're right . One minute it's hot , and then the next minute it's cold . 
 I do too . That way we can have our activities planned ahead of time . 
 Are you a visitor here ? 
 Have you been used to your new life ? 
 What are you eating ? 
 Why ? 
 Are you ready for the big competition today , Todd ? The winner gets two tickets to the Sydney Olympics ! 
 We ’ Ve still got a lot of time before we have to start running . 
 You bet . I used to take a whirlpool almost every night back home . 
 I'd like a pair of sports shoes . 
 I just like jogging . 
 Er ... , that blue pair . I need size 43 , please . 
 Very comfortable . I'll take them . 
 We are here , bus station , we are in the heart of the city . 
 Head straight up the street about two blocks then turn right . 
 Just myself . What is the rate ? 
 Fine . Do I have to show my passport ? 
 Sure . 
 Well , that's what I'm looking for myself . 
 Absolutely . Oh , do you see a sign there ? 
 OK . Let's go and see . 
 There are many interesting places you should be sure to see . One problem is transportation , however . Because the city is very old , the roads are narrow and congested . If you only have three or four days to visit , you don't want to spend them waiting in traffic in a cab . I suggest you take the subway . 
 No worries , there's a subway station at the conference center itself , and a shuttle from your hotel to the conference center that takes only 5 minutes . When you do your personal sightseeing , you can first take the shuttle to the conference center , then hop on the metro . 
 You can get a daily pass that will allow you to travel unlimited for the whole day for about 6 dollars . Otherwise , you can pay by trip , which is about 50 cents to 2 dollars each trip , depending on how far you go . 
 No , no ... . it's very hard to get lost . There are two lines , one that goes in a circle , the other that is straight . If you get lost , there are always subway attendants that can help you find your way . 
 I'd like to begin to work any time you want . 
 No problem . See you next Monday . 
 I'd like to introduce myself first . 
 My name is Gavin White . I was born and raised in London . After high school , I went to Edinburgh University . I worked for one year to pay for my tuition and then got my Bachelor ’ s degree there . Now I've come here to get my Master ’ s degree . I am glad to meet all of you and I hope we will become good friends . 
 Next week . 
 Hello , I need to register for a class . 
 I want to take a Psychology class . 
 Can you tell me what days the classes are on ? 
 And the other class ? 
 Are you sure these are the only open classes ? 
 Okay , sign me up for the class on Monday and Wednesday . 
 Excuse me , could you give me change for a dollar ? 
 I want to get cigarettes . 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Sure . We will make a broadcast for you . May I have your name , please ? 
 OK , please wait for a moment . 
 I'm going to have to say that Superbad is the best movie ever . 
 Well , Superbad is super funny . 
 I didn't know that you saw Superbad before . 
 I couldn't keep from laughing throughout the whole movie . 
 That's exactly how I felt . 
 I would love to . 
 Yes , thank you . 
 Thanks . 
 I'm going to the movie theater with my friend . What are you going to do ? 
 How about you see a movie with me and my friend ? 
 Not sure . Is there a movie out that catches your eye ? 
 Have you decided whether or not you would like to go ? 
 For sure another day . 
 I was responsible for helping patients restore their organic functions , training them in speech and organism , carrying our massage and physiotherapy , taking care of patients ' nutrition and diet . 
 They are sense of post , mentality quality , first aid ability , emergency adjustment , and law consciousness . 
 Not great . It's a kind of boring . 
 Yes , me too . But I'm disappointed . 
 Dear friends . Here , I wish to say a word of thanks for holding this send-off party for me . Actually I didn't expect at all for this . I owe a lot to all of you here . It's been 5 days since I came to visit here . Time really flies . I feel grateful for your welcome and help in the five days . I will miss you while I am leaving . Let's keep in touch in any way . What's more , to the success of our face-to-face meeting , to the upcoming cooperation of our two companies , bottom up ! 
 Madam , we also welcome you to visit our company . I hope you can also bring your family there to have a look of our company . In this way , we will know each other better . 
 Have you bought a bus pass yet ? 
 Why is that ? 
 Buying a bus pass will save you money . 
 There's no limit to how often you can use your bus pass . 
 Plus , you don't have to use change for the bus anymore . 
 You want to buy one now ? 
 Kim ! I'm here ! I brought all my old maternity clothes plus Dave and Alice's baby clothes ! 
 Believe me , the time will fly by ! Before you know it , you'll be changing diapers ! You have to start preparing ! 
 I'll be back tomorrow with my work clothes and a gallon of lavender paint ! You just sit back and relax ! 
 Hello , there . I've just started using your net banking and I'm looking for some information about my Commission Fund . 
 Regarding what exactly ? 
 Where can I find a spare hose for the pump ? 
 25 mm diameter . 
 Thanks . Have you got any light bulbs ? 
 Oh yes , some wire cutters . 
 Just one pair . 
 I usually bowl with an eight ball . I like the control of a light ball . I can spin it more , so that the ball hooks . 
 Well , let's see which technique is better . I think I'll go up first ... Yes ! I hit a strike . I knocked them all down on my first bowl . 
 Good start . You knocked eight pins down . But you are left with a 7,10 split . Unless you can bowl a UFO-ball on this bowl , it is going to be impossible . 
 Dinner's ready ! Come and get it ! 
 The government has to face a lot of social problems now . 
 But it is very difficult for any government to handle it efficiently . 
 May I take a look at the shoes over there ? 
 Size 24 . Are they synthetic or leather ? 
 It's comfortable . I will take it . 
 Yes , it will . 
 Yeah , I take this bus all the time . 
 It's about thirty minutes long . 
 There's a bus stop right behind Macy's . 
 There's a bus stop in the mall parking lot . 
 Absolutely . 
 Yes . I'd like a cup of onion soup . 
 I'd like the roast chicken , please . 
 I want a Special King size and some chips . 
 Green salad please . 
 Cola , please . 
 ... 
 Thank you . 
 OK . There are five people in my family , Father , mother , elder brother , younger sister and I . 
 My brother has found his job and my sister is still in college . 
 My father is a middle school teacher . 
 My mother is a housewife . 
 I am not married yet and I live alone now . 
 No , my father and brother are doing that . 
 Yes , I have already graduated . 
 I ’ m watching TV . 
 I will . 
 I think I'm going to go home . 
 I know , but it's 12 
 Three or four o'clock ? 
 I never stay out that late . That's too late . 
 Were you so wild when you were still in Taipei , Sharon ? 
 What is that they're doing on the couch ? 
 Pot ? Isn't that marijuana ? 
 But , Sharon , that's illegal ! The police could come , and we could go to jail . 
 Really ? 
 I didn't know you had such wild friends . Do you smoke marijuana too ? 
 I don't want to . 
 I don't know if I can drink more . I already had two drinks . 
 I thought a university was for studying . 
 Alright . I'll have another drink . 
 Oh , that sounds great ! 
 Yes , that would be perfect . 
 Yes . Thank you for inviting me . 
 I know . He doesn ’ t like to ask anyone for help . My dad insists on paying his own bills and taking care of himself ! 
 It seems that folks like my father and your grandmother are determined to be on their own . 
 Sometimes they are too independent . 
 Nothing really . 
 I didn't realize that . 
 Nobody has told me anything about your party . 
 When does it start ? 
 I'll be there . 
 Of course . 
 Can I make a reservation for flight FW58 to San Marino ? 
 Next Monday . 
 What's the fare for a first class seat ? 
 Oh . I am not a wall streeter.Give me an economy one please . 
 I think it ’ s my ankle . 
 One of my snow-shoes that cause on rocks . 
 I don ’ t think so . It ’ s kind of sore . 
 It ’ s that really necessary ? 
 So what's wrong with the drain ? 
 Let me take a look . You know why ? It's clogged with hair . No wonder water won't go down . 
 You ’ re darn right ! 
 Don't worry . I ’ Ve got some acid here . It will help dissolve the hair down there . 
 Now you know you have to clean your bathtub every time when you use it . 
 There's many books here.What about these ? 
 Sure.But you can only keep them for a week . 
 I have failed in my final examination . What can I do now ? 
 Do you eat a lot of healthy food ? 
 You have the point . I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt . 
 Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled . 
 You have made a poor meal . Let me get you some more fish . 
 What about some drink ? 
 How may I help you ? 
 Give them here . 
 It appears these books are two weeks late . 
 You do realize you are going to have to pay late fees , right ? 
 The late fee is 25 cents a day . 
 It ’ s 25 cents for each book . 
 Is there a daily passenger ship to Dalian ? 
 How many days does it take to Dalian ? 
 How many ports do we call at on our passage to Qingdao ? 
 The ship is going very fast . 
 The sea is calm and peaceful . A sea trip is always enjoyable in fine weather like this . 
 Would you come to spend the weekend with us ? 
 That ’ s too bad . 
 He always likes to say something as if all his geese are swans . 
 Yeah . This is a clever way to be in contact with such a person . 
 You like to communicate with him ? 
 All staff can enjoy the health insurance program . 
 Employees are covered by worker's compensation insurance . 
 No , what ? 
 Get out of here ! I didn ’ t even know they were dating ! 
 Can I help you ? 
 Yes , but it's checked out . 
 It's popular you know . You want to reserve it ? 
 Fill out this form and we will send you a note when we get the book . 
 Take the card , and fill in your name and library card number . 
 Charles , do you have any children ? 
 How many children do you have ? 
 What are their names ? 
 How old are they ? 
 Are they in school ? 
 What does Stephanie study ? 
 Is she here now ? 
 Could you please reserve a taxi for me ? 
 A private vehicle ? No , thanks , I won't need one . 
 T A X I , please . 
 Rockefeller Center . Can you get the taxi here immediately , please ? 
 Good . I'll get my coat and come downstairs . 
 Jenny , don't you think it's really charming ? 
 Let's take our time and enjoy the art and sprite of the famous museum . 
 Sam , you ’ Ve got to forgive me . 
 I used your computer . And I ’ m afraid I ’ Ve erased your personal files accidentally . 
 I ’ m afraid not . I apologize . 
 I told you I ’ m sorry . What can I do to make it up to you ? 
 Could I make a reservation for Flight 10 to Tokyo ? 
 How about the next flight-tomorrow at two o'clock ? 
 Good morning , how have you been doing ? 
 Have you had any type of bug lately ? 
 Has anyone ever told you that you have allergies ? 
 Does this happen more when you are under stress ? 
 I am going to refer you to a pulmonary specialist who can run tests on you for asthma . 
 Where's your better half ? 
 When is your birthday ? 
 Do you usually have a birthday party ? 
 What would you do at the party ? 
 Do you know when people began to sing the song " Happy Birthday " ? 
 Let me tell you the story.In 1892 , Patty Smith Hill and Mildred Hill wrote a song called " Good Morning to you " . But later someone added the words " Happy Birthday " to their tune . 
 Yes , actually , the song has been sung since its publication in 1932.People all over the world have sung it in many different languages . 
 Yes . What can I do for you ? 
 Could you please tell me the address ? 
 Which season do you like best ? 
 I prefer summer , especially the summer evenings . When the sun comes down , it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . After a rain shower , the smell of the air is refreshing . It is also a best reason for ice-cream . 
 Well , I have to hide in the air-conditioned rooms . Anyway , it is all worth , just think about the cool evening time . 
 I hope you enjoyed your stay . 
 Good . Right , that comes to $ 1,500 . 
 That ’ s right , sir . Three nights at 500 dollars a night ... that comes to $ 1,500 . 
 Yes , of course . The meals and excursions were included in the hotel price . 
 I ’ m sorry sir . The 250 - dollar rate is based on double occupancy . That means it ’ s 250 per person . The room itself is 500 dollars a night . 
 Of course . Just a minute ; I ’ ll get her . 
 Good morning ! Can you help me , please ? I'm looking for some books for my mother . 
 She's very fond of detective stories . 
 My home phone , the landline . I don't have a mobile phone , far too complicated for an old lady like me ! Do you need my Bank Book ? 
 Let's get started . First , select the service you require . That's household bill payment for you . Then we select the type of bill , so that's landline ... here you go . Your bill for this month comes to 87.42 RIB . The money will come out of your account and go straight to the phone company . 
 May I help you ? 
 I hope you will ! Take your time . We have a lot more upstairs . 
 Titanic made a hit ! It was so touching . 
 The heroin may not be attractive . I like the story , though . 
 I'm not in the mood . 
 I don't want to sit there and watch them torturing the animals . 
 Cute ? Hope so . 
 Me ? No way , keep him away from me , please . 
 I've said that I've got a problem with the circus . I'm not kidding . 
 What type of music do you like to listen to ? 
 Like what , for instance ? 
 Why is that ? 
 That's a good reason to like something . 
 Did you see the way that Brian came to work yesterday ? Ever since he came back from that conference in Silicon Valley , he's been coming to work dressed in jeans and sweatshirts . It's like he's decided to make himself at home in his office . I don't know how long it'll take before the management talks to him about it . 
 Maybe so , but it seems kind of strange , which the rest of us in white shirts , dark suites , and ties . 
 What's that ? 
 I played the video game at Mike's home yesterday . 
 It's really fantastic . The hero , Super Warrior , is so brave that he can defeat any enemies he meets . He runs through tunnels , swims under water , and climbs over bridges . It's really exciting ! 
 I borrowed it from Mike yesterday . Why not have a try ? 
 What ’ s the area of your country ? 
 That sounds quite big ! How many people live there ? 
 What ’ s the average income ? 
 So your country is fairly rich . 
 Unemployment in my country is a fraction of that . 
 But yesterday you said you would rent it . 
 Why is that ? 
 Maybe you ’ re right . 
 What are you buying ? 
 I can check for you , if you'd like . 
 First , we need eggs , milk , and bread . 
 How about some chicken , ground beef , and some steak ? 
 Get some snack foods . 
 That is very encouraging news . I heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . That is to say , the R & D center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market . 
 That is the best one I have seen . I am sure our target customers , young people will love it . 
 I have never experienced a roller coaster . I want you to sit beside me . 
 You try to put on a brave face . 
 It's not really all that good.The bedroom is a little small for us . 
 But there's no hot water after 10 at night.Sometimes I like to have a hot shower before bed , especially in the winter , it feels good . 
 True , and I like the kitchen.It ' s new and well equipped . 
 You are right.The view is spectacular.But that bedroom is so small.We ' d never be able to fit all of our stuff in there . 
 I haven't thought of that . 
 With pleasure . 
 No problem . 
 No need , sir . 
 Yes , I am . 
 I actually transferred here from another school . 
 I transferred from PCC . 
 I love it here . 
 Don ’ t get me wrong . I like it here , but PCC is better . 
 Because I got my AA and now I am going towards my bachelor degree . 
 The boss wanted to pay Bob with stock options . But Bob didn't want to play that game again . 
 At his last start-up , Bob worked for stock and no salary . They folded and he made zip . 
 Now he only works freelance . Hundred bucks an hour . 
 Do you have many different suppliers ? 
 Excuse me . May I use the phone first ? 
 You bet . I was supposed to call my mother an hour ago . 
 How ’ s it going ? 
 What can I help you with ? 
 What ’ s wrong with the check ? 
 How much did you write the check for ? 
 How much were you supposed to write it for ? 
 I can cancel it for you right now . 
 Hey , Jim . I didn ’ t know you biked to work . 
 One less car on the road means less pollution . 
 How far is it ? 
 That doesn ’ t sound too bad . I wish I could do it , but I work in the city . So I take the train . 
 True . Well , see you tomorrow . 
 Mumm . Those burgers smell great . It's perfect day for a barbecue . 
 Oh , hi ! I'm Barbara Johnson . Nice to meet you . 
 Barbara . But please , just call me Barb . 
 I'm studying medicine . 
 At Harvard . What about you ? 
 Oh , are you ? That sounds interesting . 
 Good . I'm starving . 
 Yes , where do you want to go ? 
 Would you please look at the five routes ? 
 Yes , right now it's the busy season . 
 Basketball , football , table tennis . I will watch them on TV . 
 Yeah , it is my favorite . Many Chinese people including women and children would like to concern the game . I think they want to see the performance of coming and YiJianLian , the Chinese players in NBA . 
 I am good at tennis and skiing . What about you ? 
 Moderate exercise is really important for health . ' Life lies in movement . ' 
 Good idea . I will take the racket . 
 I feel like something good to eat . 
 Hey , that sounds a good idea . 
 You can find one at the end of the street . 
 No.but there are quite many cars . 
 How about eating out for a drink with me tonight . 
 No problem . Let's say 6:30 p . m . at the Royal Restaurant , OK ? 
 Excuse me . This chicken doesn't taste right to me . 
 How should I know ? It's just kind of cold in the middle . It just doesn't taste right . Do you want to try it ? 
 Another one ? I don't want another one . Give me something simple . You've got steak , right ? 
 Half done . 
 I watched it happen . 
 Yes . I was right there . 
 This guy tried to rob the bank . 
 I was really scared when he pulled the gun out . 
 He tried to leave with the money . 
 They caught him before he could walk through the front door . 
 Normally , about 60 people . But it may depend . 
 About 20 % of them come from other countries and the others are employed from domestic universities and colleges . 
 Yes , can you tell me where I can find a travel agency ? 
 Thank you . 
 Cinct de mayo ? 
 Do we get a day off from school then ? 
 Www , man ! 
 Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ? 
 And then what happened ? 
 Is there any more vodka in that bottle ? 
 Marvelous . Pass it over . My name's George , by the way . 
 So Irene , what do you do ? 
 Macrohard , eh ? 
 I have my own company that designs computer systems . 
 Bring me a cup of coffee , please . 
 I'd prefer a black one . 
 Just taking a smoke break . 
 Sure . Here you go . 
 I didn't know you smoked . 
 Oh . You're new to smoking still . I've been smoking for 7 years . 
 Many times . I'm really addicted . It's harder to stop than you think . 
 I highly recommend you quit soon . The longer you smoke , the harder it becomes to quit . 
 No problem . I'll talk to you later . 
 Well , I like to play the piano . 
 About 18 years , I started learning when I was a kid . 
 Sure , so , what about you ? Do you have any hobbies ? 
 Good evening . What'll you have ? 
 Draft beer and cans beer . Which do you prefer ? 
 OK . Here you are . 
 Of course . Wait for a moment , please . 
 That's a good idea . Do you know how to write an introductory letter ? 
 I just know a little . First you need to include your basic information , such as your name , age , gender and major , etc . 
 I think the most important is that you need to show the employer that you are qualified for that job . 
 Yes , thus the employer can know you very well , and then decide whether you are the right person . 
 I wish you good luck ! 
 Why do you want to be a teacher ? 
 In what department do you wish to work if we hire you ? 
 I'm leaving now , mum . 
 I will.Bye - bye ! 
 Could you lend your bike to me for several days ? 
 Till the end of the week . 
 This is a nice place , but you need to get some furniture . 
 Do you have a bed ? 
 Can I take a shower ? 
 Really ? 
 Well , do you want to go get some dinner ? 
 Professor Wang looks so handsome today . He is wearing a light brown suit and a pink tie . 
 He ’ s quite particular about what he wears , especially about his ties . He gets different tie each day . 
 The tie is necessary for man . It makes you look so attractive in a super tie . 
 My father dose not know how to tie a tie , for he often wears a cravat . 
 You mother is not only a patient mother but also a gentle wife . 
 Yes , what about us having a tour ? 
 How about Milan ? 
 Why not travel by ourselves ? 
 well , yesterday , I decided to face my fear of heights . 
 let me put it this way . I've never seen a professional sorts game in a stadium because I could never get myself to walk to the top of the stairs to sit down . 
 I went sky-diving ! 
 It was scary , but it felt great , too . 
 of course I was scared . But I had an instructor that went with me and that helped . 
 I think so . After I jumped out of the plane , I realized that I should just enjoy life . Worrying about it or not doing things out of fear is just plain silly . 
 are you scared of anything ? 
 what do you think is going to happen ? 
 it sounds like you just need to be more careful . 
 No , it might be dangerous there . 
 I'd like to , but I'm tied up with my paper . 
 I do not know what I could imagine , but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers . 
 Hello , I need to get a cab . 
 That's fine . 
 How are you feeling , John ? 
 Do more exercises after you are healthy . 
 Are you hungry ? Do you want me to buy something for you to eat ? 
 Dalian is a beautiful city . Do you agree ? 
 The climate here is pleasant . 
 This city is really comfortable to living . 
 No other city can match it . It's heaven . 
 Maybe . 
 My throat is really dry . 
 Yes , I'm parched . 
 I was thinking about getting a soda . 
 Why not ? 
 I don't know what else to drink . 
 I would like some water . 
 Good day . How can we assist you ? 
 It certainly is . Do you have your contract and Import License ? 
 Thanks . What you need to do now is deposit 100 % of the guaranteed funds of your contract into your account with us . 
 That's great . We will have to charge you 250 RIB for that service , though . Could you please fill in this ? Thanks . 
 Yes , of course.It was nice to see you . 
 Wei ! This is a first-you didn't bargain ! 
 But you could have saved money . 
 F . Y . I . , there is a flea market nearby , but maybe you're done ... 
 A guy in my office got the flu the other day . Today I seem to have come down with it , too . 
 Yes . I wonder if you could do something to help me recover soon , because I'll be on a business trip in two days . 
 But I'm going on a business trip in two days ! 
 Mr . Anderson , the boss wants to see you . 
 I've something very unpleasant to talk with you . Upon the arrival of the first consignment , it was found that about 50 % of the sixty cases of pineapples were leaking . 
 It ’ s simply because the tins were damaged . 
 I am sorry to say it's not on the way , but during loading . The tins inside the cases were broken evidently through rough handling . 
 Certainly . Here you are . Our health authorities said they were no longer suitable for human consumption . I have to remind you that our terms are CIF Hamburg . I hope you would indemnify us for the loss , so it wouldn't be so heavy on us . 
 Do you mind if I smoke ? 
 Please tell me something about your insurance background . 
 Why do you want to be an insurance agent ? 
 Do you have any work experience in promotion ? 
 Do people respond well to you ? 
 You got a letter in the mail . 
 What is it ? 
 What does it say ? 
 Are you serious ? 
 Good for you ! 
 I ’ m so proud of you . 
 Do you have brothers and sisters ? 
 Oh , I have an elder sister . She is married .. Her husband is a businessman . 
 No , they live alone . 
 Really ? Do you mean that you are leaving ? 
 Where do you want to go ? 
 I will miss you . But anyway I wish you every success at your new post . 
 Cute ... Here . These beans are already ground . Now for step three 
 You have to brew the grinds while they're fresh and drink it immediately for the best flavor . 
 There is no step four ... 
 Doctor , what is the best way to stay healthy ? 
 It is very confusing to know what to eat . 
 Are there certain things that I should avoid ? 
 After watching my diet , what else should I do ? 
 Can I have a glass of wine now and then ? 
 The Blacks got divorced . 
 Mr . Black has been getting a little on the side . 
 No , he doesn't . Anyway , his wife found out that he has been two-timing for a long time . 
 No . The only thing I've ever done behind your back is zipping you up . 
 We have been here for about five days and I have to leave now . 
 Yes , we have a very pleasant time . Thank you for being so nice for us . 
 No , thanks . You've done a lot for us . Thank you for everything . 
 Oh ! Thank you ! It's very kind of you . 
 We're sure we will . And welcome to our corporation next year . We're expecting you . 
 I am exhausted . I need some sleep . 
 I twisted and turned all night , and couldn ’ t sleep . I was worried about my mother ’ s health . 
 Hello there , Sir . I've dealt with you before , haven't I ? 
 Yes , of course , Mr Peters ! Good to see you again . What can we do for you today ? 
 I see . We offer Agent Services free of charge here . Before your new business begins trading , we could , on behalf of your existing company , do a series of registration and get the certificates you need . If you are unsure of the local laws , that is . 
 It is difficult . 
 Do I have to memorize it ? 
 What can I do for you ? 
 Let me have them . 
 These books are two weeks late . 
 You ’ re going to have to pay late fees . 
 25 cents a day . 
 That means 25 cents for each late book . 
 Hello , Lucy , I heard you did a good deal in interview . 
 What did you do in the interview ? 
 Are all these helpful for the interview ? 
 Anything else ? 
 What can I do for you , sir ? 
 What kind of games do you like ? 
 I see , but games are played in different ways . I'm wondering what type of games do you like to play ? 
 Basically , there are 7 types of games 
 Don't worry . Most male customers choose first person shooting , real time strategy , action or sports , while female customers prefer simulating , action or role playing . Shooting , action and sports games require flexible movements and real time strategy usually needs overall consideration . 
 If so , counter Strike and Might & Magic are good alternatives . Counter Strike is one of the hottest shooting games and Might & Magic series are popular among girls because the game has attractive plot and interesting scenes . 
 Do you want the latest editions ? If your computer runs fast , I think the latest editions are better because although old editions are cheaper , they are less exciting and attractive . 
 Hello , can you tell me how to use the telephone ? 
 Thank you so much . By the way , is there a mail service ? 
 What kinds of things do you like to do ? 
 I didn't know you knew how to draw and paint . 
 How long have you known how to do that ? 
 Did you take some sort of art class or something ? 
 You have got to be talented . 
 If only I was talented . 
 So how did your end-of-the-year review go ? 
 Did he actually say that ? 
 Are you sure you're not reading too much into what he said ? 
 Well , I think you may be overreacting . Mitch likes to give everybody constructive criticism and I think that's what he was doing . 
 Yes , I do . If you ask around , other people will tell you the same thing . 
 I'm glad to hear it . 
 Mike ! Good to hear from you . How are you ? 
 Things are going well with me . 
 Mike , I don't think that it's a good idea to go out again . I really need to focus on getting packed and ready to move back home . 
 I can't really deal with any distractions right now , but I appreciate the nice evening we spent together . 
 Yeah , it'll make a hit , I think.When will it be on , do you know ? 
 Hey , Ann . Wake up . It's time to get out of bed . 
 Yes , or you'll be late . 
 It went off 30 minutes ago . 
 Rise and shine . 
 Is there any way we could get a better warranty on this product ? 
 That might not be ideal because there would be some drawbacks to an annual contract situation that might make it difficult to sell to our buyers . What about free delivery ? If we make a large enough order , could you waive the deliver fee ? 
 That would be fine . We could accept a lower rebate . 
 no . It's all yours . 
 Carson . It's nice to mee you , too . 
 it is unusually warm . I blame it on global warming . 
 so sure . Are you from around here ? 
 where are you from ? 
 I am from Texas . I was in China once , but it was a long time ago . 
 I did . I especially liked the food . What do you think about the food here ? 
 Is that the Da Vinci Code that you've got there ? 
 no , but I saw the movie . What do you think about it ? 
 well , this is my stop . it was nice talking with you . 
 I want to buy a parking permit , please . 
 I attend both day and evening classes . 
 I ride a motorcycle . 
 I'll use a credit card , thank you . 
 No , just the motorcycle permit . 
 You really need to look at some of the problems we are having with the apartment . 
 We spoke with you the first week we moved in about things that you promised to fix . 
 There is no hot water , the bedroom has a broken window , and there are rats in the kitchen . 
 You are obligated to maintain your building and my apartment . 
 I will be withholding my rent check this Friday unless these problems are addressed immediately . 
 I am calling to ask about the position of an usher . 
 What qualities do you expect the applicants to have ? 
 Hi ! I'm Hong lei . What's your name ? 
 Hi Ricky . Are you a new student here ? 
 No , I've been here for six months . 
 It's not so long really . What class are you in ? Intermediate or ... ? 
 I'm in Advanced One . Who's your teacher ? 
 Ah ! Does she wear glasses ? 
 That's probably Anne Wallis . 
 No . But she taught me last term . How long have you been here ? 
 Wow , not long . Where do you live ? With a family ? 
 Yes . Actually my friend has a spare room in here apartment and she's looking for a flatmate . Would you like her phone number ? 
 Good morning , Sir . 
 Of course , Sir . What kind of currency would you like to deposit ? And what is the amount you would like to pay in ? 
 OK , Sir . Would that be Fixed or Current Deposit ? 
 And how long are you depositing for ? 
 I am not sure how to add a class . 
 I'll bring one next time . 
 I think I know where it is . 
 Thank you for your directions . It's clear . 
 That's great . Thank you so much . 
 Good afternoon , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 No problem . Please wait a minute . ( She goes to the back for a few minutes . ) Here is your medicine , sir . Take two tablets after each meal and once before bed . 
 Yes , our over-the-counter medicine is over there on that shelf . 
 Yes , right over here . 
 Here's a twenty . 
 Isn't it a nice day ? 
 It seems that it may rain today . 
 How come ? 
 I feel the same way . It smells so good after it rains . 
 Really ? Why ? 
 I really want it to rain today . 
 Carlo's Kitchen . 
 For four , And may I have your name ? 
 May's birthday is coming . Shall we buy her a birthday present or let her choose one for herself ? 
 You are such a good father . It's next Sunday . 
 What about a cell phone ? She is old enough to have one . 
 Maybe we can try shopping on line . 
 I'm sure that May would love the pink one . 
 Totally . Computers bring with them convenience.Oh , what's wrong ? 
 Oh , it's such a pain . We'd better go to a store later . 
 I want to buy a skirt , but I have no idea which one to buy . 
 I don't like to keep up with joneses . 
 I think this suits me . Can I try it on ? 
 I'm the Project Manager so I have to make sure our projects run smoothly . I work with three Project Engineers . They take care of after-sales service and look after the maintenance side of the business . 
 I haven ’ t been able to get a good night ’ s sleep lately . I ’ m exhausted ! 
 I try to go to sleep , but I just can ’ t stay asleep . 
 I go to bed when I finish my work . 
 I am worried about how I am going to pay my tuition . 
 Doing something relaxing before I go to sleep sounds like a plan . 
 Are you nuts ? 
 What is it ? 
 Really ? I can't believe it . It's like a dream come true . I never expected that I would win The Nobel Prize ! 
 Thanks for the compliment . 
 Hey Mark . What are you doing ? 
 Anything interesting on ? 
 So I take it you're pretty bored too . 
 It's Saturday and we are sitting at home doing nothing . What's wrong with us ? 
 I already tried to call up some of the guys , but they are all busy . 
 She's out shopping with her friends . 
 Aright . Do you have any cigarettes ? 
 Ok . See you there in about 30 minutes . 
 Oh , the food here really is bad . My soup was cold and meat , ur ... it was like leather . 
 I ’ m sure this one is especially bad . And the word is so unpleasant . 
 Well , I ’ m going to write a letter of complaint . 
 Good evening , Pizza House . This is Marty speaking.May I take your order ? 
 We have a two-for-one special on large pizzas.Would you like a large pizza instead ? 
 Great ! Would you like your second pizza to be the same as the first ? 
 Okay , thin crust . Your total is $ 21.50 and yourorder will arrive in thirty minutes or it ’ s free ! 
 wait ! ! I need your address ! 
 Why ? 
 But I see people sweat a lot doing Yoga too . 
 You should try swimming then . It helps you to keep fit . 
 Yes . Come with me to the vitamin section . 
 You're looking for a multi though , right ? 
 Okay . Then I recommend this one . It's made especially for men about your age . 
 That's my job ! Is there anything else I can assist you with ? 
 Have you checked your connection settings ? 
 Yes , there have been a few problems recently . Why don't you call the IT department ? 
 Hi , I would like to send this package to China , and these postcards as well . 
 How much is this going to cost ? 
 What ’ s the difference ? 
 I see . Well , there ’ s no rush . Please send it via priority mail . Please be extra careful , the contents of the package are fragile . 
 Hello , this is Quinn from IBA . 
 I'm afraid so , yes . 
 Unfortunately it's rather a big mistake . 
 I would recommend we scrap this one and you bring in another set as soon as possible . 
 Are you ready to order , sir ? 
 How do you like your steaks ? 
 OK , sir , wait a minute . 
 I need to rent three pairs of skates for the morning . 
 One pair of 37 , and two pairs of 21 . One for me , and the other two for two kids . 
 Thanks . Well , those two kids are beginners . What should I do about their safety ? 
 Oh , yeah , maybe I should ask them just to walk along the railings . 
 OK . Anything else ? 
 Got it . Thanks for reminding me . And , are there any intensive training courses ? 
 What ’ s the problem , Ms . Murphy ? 
 I ’ m sorry . Ms . Murphy . I ’ ll re-work it . Can I give it back to you this afternoon ? 
 I need a copy of the agenda . Also , may I suggest something ? I know we have many points to review today , but would it be possible to limit our meeting time to finish before four o'clock ? Many of us still have a mountain of work to do before the day's end . 
 I propose we accept the minutes . 
 I second . 
 I gave everyone a copy of the manual last week . We've had the review board going over everything , and they have come up with a final review . Here's a copy for everyone , and if you have any questions , you can talk to me after the meeting . Basically , the budget review has been completed , with maybe a few polishing details left . 
 If everyone could take a look at the final review handout , if there're any objections or corrections , let me know . Next week , we can cast the final approval . 
 That's quite all right . 
 Not too worry , so tell me about yourself . 
 We are going to have a party tonight , would you please look after our baby tonight ? 
 That's good . 
 I just received a phone call for an interview next week . 
 thank you , but I'm nervous . I don't know what to do.Could you tell me what should I do before an interview ? 
 yeah , besides my personal introduction , what else should I prepare ? 
 then what should I do when I'm being interviewed ? 
 are there any other things I should pay attention to ? 
 Is Tom in ? 
 May I have his office phone number please ? 
 Wow ! They've got everything here . All the world's famous brands . Aunt Cindy , what is your favorite brand ? 
 Oh , that's a very expensive brand , but with good reason . 
 I see . Come here . The high heels here look really attractive . But I wonder whether it's comfortable to wear any of them ? 
 It's not a simple thing to be beautiful . 
 Yeah , very tasteful . And with them , you look even more fashionable . Oh , there are so many French perfumers . Oops , perfumes for guys ? So strange ! 
 Oh , really , that's really something new . I'm afraid not everyone can accept it . 
 That's true . Well , it's obvious that fashion is not a cheap thing . So , do you spend all your money on it ? 
 How is it that you are my mom's sis ? You two are so different . She always picks up bargains and spends more than she earns . You do so much better than her . 
 This is our rock - bottom price , Mr . Li . We can't make any further concessions . 
 What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great . 
 What is your proposal ? 
 Do you mean to suggest that we have to make a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible . 
 The best we can do will be a reduction of another 30 dollars . That'll definitely be rock bottom . 
 You certainly have a way of talking me into it . All right , let's meet half way again . 
 Yes , there's one other point I wish to clear up . 
 My friends in business circles all seem to be of the opinion that the U . S . import and export corporations have become more flexible in doing business recently . 
 I'm glad to hear that . With a view to expanding and further enhancing the bilateral relations between our two parties , and in particular , exchanging timely views on specific problems in the execution and enforcement of contracts , is it possible for us to have a representative that could stay permanently in Washing - ton D . C . ? 
 Yes , of course . I'll call my home office tonight and let them know about it . When do we meet again ? 
 Good . I'll come back tomorrow , and we can then discuss it more specifically . 
 Promise you are not going to be angry ? 
 I forgot . 
 Ah , ah , you promised , and remember ? 
 As a matter of fact , I have . I ran into him just the other day . 
 Not too well . He had to have four teeth pulled last week . 
 I think so , too . 
 I'll be sure to do that . 
 Yes . But I don't know the exact time . 
 Oh , I see . I will tell my wife . Thank you for telling me so much . 
 Yes , of course . I am going to have my appendix removed . 
 Yes . Here it is . 
 Sure . Here is the mirror . 
 What about this one ? It's natural ingredients . 
 Hmm . Let me try something.Wait . I have a reservation for someone named Sang here . But it's spelled J - A - N - G . It's not spelled J - I - A - N - G . It's for a Mr . C Sang . 
 Yes , sometimes it happens , Ma'am . That's why it is always good to carry your confirmation number . I'm sorry about the inconvenience . 
 Yes , of course.The pool is open until 10:00 p . m . So you still have about 45 minutes . 
 Here is your key . Your room is 379.You can find the elevators just around that corner there , down the hall.Enjoy your stay , Ma'am . 
 May I ask you a few questions about insurance ? 
 Now we've given a CIF Shanghai price for some steel plates . What insurance rate do you suggest we should get ? 
 Why not ? 
 Then am I right in understanding that FPA doesn't cover partial loss for the nature of particular average . 
 Are there any other clauses in marine policies ? 
 Well , thank you very much for all that information . Could you give me a quotation for my consignment now ? 
 Yes . My customer is in urgent need of the steel plates . 
 Thank you . 
 Good morning . What time is it now ? 
 I'm on time today 
 Yes , quite often . 
 No , I left home at 6:30 as usual . 
 Because the traffic is not crowded . 
 Yes , I'm very pleased . I've just got two tickets to see the Olympic opening ceremony . 
 I certainly am . I would have been very disappointed if I hadn ’ t got them . 
 What a good idea . I'm quite hungry . 
 Let ’ s go then . 
 Of course , how can I help you ? 
 Let's pull out your scores so far . Do you think you are doing OK ? 
 I'm seeing that you are doing OK in some areas , but not so well in others . 
 You can greatly improve your grades by always reflecting on what you can improve on . 
 Just do your best and I am sure that you will see improvement . 
 Ah , yes , Miss Chang . What seems to be the problem ? 
 Very well . That can be arranged . 
 It covers an area of 75,000 square meters . 
 In the early 70s . We ’ ll soon be celebrating the 30th anniversary . 
 Thank you . 
 500 . We ’ re running on three shifts . 
 Our associates specializing in these fields make some access - ries . Well , here we ’ re at the production shop . Shall we start with the assembly line ? 
 When's your birthday ? 
 I'm too tired now . I've already worked for 12 hours overtime ! 
 Yes , they were supposed to , but so far nobody's turned up , and I have to do the work alone . This is the first break I've had all day . 
 I'm afraid I can't before I finish this project . 
 I will , thanks for your concern . 
 I know I'm a blabbermouth , but what do you think she should do , John ? 
 I know ! But it's really important to her ! Her whole life could be ruined by this man ! 
 Are you serious , John ? 
 So Chris , I've heard that you're from a big family . How many people ? 
 Seven children ? That's a lot . Why did your parents have so many ? 
 Jeez , seven children . That must have a lot of problems . We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right . 
 Like what ? I assume that there's no privacy . 
 And the age gap is also annoying . There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me . We have nothing in common . 
 Are you here for the position advertised in China Daily ? 
 What kind of information would you like ? 
 Yes , it's still open . 
 Oh , we need your resume , health report , three photographs and several letters of recommendation . Would you please send them to us by next Wednesday ? 
 What kind of qualities should a secretary have ? 
 I am diligent and hard-working . Besides , I am good at both English and Italian . 
 Hi , I Want a room , please . 
 A double room for my wife and me , please . 
 Yes , I'd like to exchange some US dollars into RIB . 
 What's the exchange rate for RIB ? 
 I'd like to exchange 3,000 . 
 Yes . Here you are . 
 All right , thank you so much , good-bye . 
 Hello , I need a wake-up call tomorrow morning . 
 Actually , I need two calls , one at 7 and the other at 7 fifteen . 
 Do you know what , let's change the second call to 7 thirty . 
 Not at the moment , thank you . 
 It's really late but I'm starving . 
 Maybe they have some good pie . 
 There was a coffee shop by my house when I was a kid that served cinnamon hot chocolate . 
 Good stuff ... Oh , no . The door is locked . 
 Good morning , sir . Can I help you ? 
 Please fill out this deposit form , first . 
 No , that's fine . Do you bring your bankbook with you ? 
 Wait a moment , please . 
 Is there anything else I can do for you ? 
 The deposit rate is 0.8 % every month . 
 Please forgive me for rushing into your room forgetting to knock at the door . 
 I'm so sorry to disturb you so early . 
 I'm dreadfully sorry . I forgot to book the tickets yesterday . 
 I let you down . I'll make it up to you somehow . 
 Any chance of using your telephone ? 
 Well , I thought it was not that serious . 
 nothing special . how about you ? Are you used to the life here in the States ? 
 great ! 
 sounds interesting . Where did you get the idea ? 
 absolutely . that's because both of us have distinctive cultural features . 
 yes . this must be a huge difference . 
 sure . We tend to think that the slower on eats , the more polite one seems . 
 and we never sip or slurp the soup loudly . we quietly like little mouthfuls . 
 don't worry . i'm sure our etiquette will become a natural part of your behavior as time goes by . 
 I'm here to express my congratulations to you on your birthday . And I wish you many happy returns of the day . Here is a birthday present for you . 
 Would you like some more coffee ? 
 Good luck finding the waitress ! 
 I'll go get the check , since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way . 
 So the total is $ 36.00 for our dinner . 
 I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service . 
 I think that we should leave 10 % . 
 Is there I can do for you , miss ? 
 Let me see , oh it's a sunny day . You will have a nice trip tomorrow . 
 morning . Macmillan and Emory . May I help you ? 
 No , I ’ m sorry . You ’ Ve reached Mr . Macmillan ’ s office . Let me just put you through to accounting . 
 How are you today ? 
 Can I help you ? 
 I ’ m sorry , but you won ’ t be able to view it today . 
 You have to make an appointment first . 
 Is this Friday okay ? 
 Yes , I will schedule you for that time . 
 What are you doing tonight ? 
 Don't you hate fighting the crowds on the weekends ? 
 What store do you shop at ? 
 I have been using the store across town for years . 
 They do , but they're a little expensive on certain items . 
 I will sometime . Thanks for the advice . 
 Is that different from this kind of zoo ? 
 So tell me about it ! 
 Special rules ? 
 Details ? 
 Why not ? 
 That makes sense . But that sounds interesting . Is there one in Beijing too ? 
 I prefer to go there next time . 
 Hello . 
 I'm sorry . He's not here right now . 
 Around five thirty . 
 Yes . May I ask who's calling ? 
 Okay . I'll tell him you called . 
 I heard you are busy with your new house now ? 
 Let meet this right — — do you want to buy the house ? 
 But it is far from downtown . Living here is very inconvenient . 
 How's your new car ? 
 You made a good choice , then ? 
 No regrets ? 
 I'm glad you're so happy . 
 I'd like to buy some souvenirs . 
 That's nothing new . 
 What do you think of the new mayor ? 
 Cheese ! It tastes like cardboard . 
 Excuse me . Can I deposit valuables here ? 
 OK . 
 Till next Monday when we check out . 
 What does your friend Jim do ? 
 He can repair cares ? I cannot believe it . 
 I must admit I'm not at all interested in math . 
 But I don't think I'll ever show my liking to math . 
 Mr . Sandals , may I see your ID , please ? 
 Now , sir , do you have a credit card ? 
 I'm sorry , Mr . Sandals , but we accept only MasterCard or VISA . 
 Okay . You're in room 507 . It's a single queen-size bed , spacious , and nonsmoking . Is that suitable ? 
 Here's your key , sir . If you need anything , just dial 0 on your room phone . 
 What ? 
 What ! ? It'll be a miracle if we're ready by the end of the month ! Is she crazy ? 
 Crazy is too kind . Insane is more like it . Nuts ! Wacko ! Psycho ! 
 Please to meet you Mrs Chen . My name is Joy . Welcome to the hotel . Here is the keys , registration slips and breakfast description . Breakfast will be served from seven tomorrow morning . Is there any change of your schedule ? 
 And we arrange a morning call at seven thirty . Is that be fine ? 
 Please put your luggage outside your room by eight . The bail-boy will pick them up . 
 Thank you very much . I hope you enjoy your stay . 
 Books in the first aisle are all best sellers . 
 Well , do you like novels ? 
 Here is one written by famous Japanese novelist . You can have a look . 
 My pleasure . 
 Tomorrow ? 
 That sounds great . 
 OK . Dinner and a movie will be perfect . 
 How about 7 o'clock ? 
 OK . Bye . 
 The demographic reports are in ... From the looks of it , we're going to have to re-evaluate some of the content for our promotional events in different venues . 
 According to the report , our Boston crowd is quite different make-up from our Chicago folks . Our Boston consumers are mostly from mid-level to upper-class income levels , university or postgraduates , married no children , white collar ... You know the kind . Chicago on the other hand is mostly mid to low income levels , single parent homes , blue collar ... I think we're talking about two totally different target groups . 
 No kidding . We've got to come up with two completely different sales pitches to suit the needs of each groups . 
 My family really needs a car , we live quite far out of the town centre , but unfortunately we cannot afford to pay out such a large sum of money in one go . 
 Great , I just hope I qualify ! Could you tell me some more ? Can I use the money to buy the car from anywhere ? 
 Then I can go to this appointed dealer , see what they've got and then make a decision ? 
 What do you require ? 
 That sounds fine . If you could give me the name and address of the dealer I'll go over there now and see what they've got . 
 That's a lot of money ! What did you do ? Break the piggy bank ? 
 Ok , I'll find all the quarters and dimes while you sort the nickels and pennies . 
 I found some coins that are not from here . 
 Are you sure the bank will change these coins for you ? 
 Hello , could you arrange a dinner for us ? 
 Eight o'clock tomorrow evening . 
 Ten . 
 Chinese food . 
 No , not too lavish . 
 What is the usual thing here ? 
 Let's say sixty Yuan then . 
 We'd like to have typical Chinese food . 
 No snakes , please . 
 Mao Tai and Qingdao Beer . 
 Right , thanks . 
 See you then . 
 I came to see my aunt . 
 Yes . She lives on the next block . 
 Yes . I have been with ABC Insurance Company for four years , and before that , I worked with the Pacific surveyor company as claim officer . 
 Yes , on the shipper's side , when the cargos arrives , all relevant documents will be forwarded to the consignee.Among other things , this party has to check carefully the content of the packing list and weight list.When cargos are found to be damaged of short landed , this party has to call for a joint survey by representatives of the shipping company and the insurance agent.Based on the survey report , they will lodge a clam for compensation . 
 I think , first of all , I would ask the consignee to produce survey report on loading , if they can't produce that I would suggest them to refer the case to their shipper . Meanwhile , bad weather could be agood excuse to refuse the responsibility . 
 Yes , I used to dispatch telex to shippers and the consignee to inform them of changes of our schedule and other information . 
 When I was college , I passed Band Six of College English Test.All the foreign business men I've dealt with say my English is quite good . 
 No problem , I love it.Thank you for granting me the interview . 
 We're working on different steps in different areas.For example , our Colbert line is thriving in American markets , we've already reached the loyalty stage.In Asia , however , it's a different story.Most people haven't even heard of Colbert , so we're working on awareness through a lot of product launches and related activities . 
 Understanding comes from product differentiation.We get that through product demonstration , literature , expert testimonials , and the like . 
 Shandong . 
 I'd be glad to . I love picnicking . 
 Can I bring my camera with me ? 
 I sure will . 
 Here ’ s my VISA card . 
 What ’ s the problem ? 
 It was ? 
 That ’ s my only one . 
 No cash today . 
 I ’ ll come tomorrow with cash . 
 not much . I'm just trying to hook up to the internet . I'm having a few problems though . 
 I've got all the cords plugged in , but it appears that I'm offline . 
 actually , I've got a wireless connection . 
 I hook up to the Internet every day . I can't believe I didn't do that . 
 No , but I'd like to . Do you have to pay to do instant messaging ? 
 what do you do if people want to talk to you online but you don't want to talk to them ? 
 what's your email address ? I'll add you to my contacts list . 
 cool . We can meet up in a chat room sometime or just chat online using messenger.thanks for your help . 
 Kate , what do you like to do tonight ? Do you often go to the movies ? 
 There ’ s a good movie called Summer in Beijing . 
 Let ’ s find out what time it starts . 
 Here it is . It starts at 8 o'clock . 
 Good morning , I want a room tonight . 
 Single , please . 
 Yes . I made a reservation in shanghai . 
 Yeah . Let me see . Is this the one you want ? 
 Wu Mei . That ’ s my name . 
 Is this room with a bath room ? 
 Can you give me a quiet room ? 
 What ’ s the room rate ? 
 Three nights I scheduled . 
 Is that right ? 
 Your room Number is 827 . The bail-boy will take your bags and show you to your room . 
 Can you effect shipment during September ? 
 Then when at the earliest can we expect the shipment ? 
 It's too late . You see , in our market October is the season for the kind of commodity . So the goods must be shipped before October or we won't be ready for the season . 
 Thanks . Then may I suggest that you put down in the contract ' shipment on September 15 or earlier ' ? 
 Oh , that's very considerate of you . I'lI take your word for it . 
 You're too humble . 
 I ’ m looking for a hotel near the convention center . 
 Not just yet . I have one or two questions . How much for a single ? 
 That ’ s a good deal . Since this is a working trip , I wonder if you have meeting rooms where I can get together with some clients . 
 That sounds great . Do you accept checks ? 
 Merry Christmas ! Let ’ s paint the town red . 
 Hello , sir . Can I help you ? 
 What size are you looking for ? 
 How about this one ? 
 What color do you like ? 
 How about that one ? 
 Sure . There is a changing room behind you . 
 Yes , emergency . There is a huge fire here .

 Where are you ?

 From 6:00 to 9:00 . 
 Certainly , Sir . What would you like to have ? 
 Fine.Have a nice stay here . 
 Yes , she is my favorite girl . I've decided to go steady with her . 
 Sure . She is the ideal girl , the one I had dreamed of . 
 She is the mature , stable , feminine type . I hope one day I can marry her . 
 Hello . 
 Not really , I ’ m in a meeting . Can I call you back in ... say ... 15 minutes ? 
 Ok , I ’ ll look out for it . Sorry , I can ’ t talk now . 
 Yes , but I will graduate from the Shanghai Finance and Trade school next month . 
 I'm sure . You know my major is statistics and I get excellent records in all of the courses I have taken . 
 Yes , my father runs a business so I have opportunity to work in the finance department every holiday . 
 Thank you . 
 Thank you . I wonder whether I can enjoy the life insurance and health insurance . 
 Good . Anything else ? 
 Excuse me , Professor , is there a time when I could meet with you ? 
 I would like to come in at three o'clock . 
 Yes , I can . 
 I got it . 
 Thank you , I'll be there . 
 My accounts go where I go . Vince knows that . 
 It's business , Dave . 
 Right . The faint of heart should not apply . 
 So do I . 
 I sure hope you didn't trust anyone with your credit card number . 
 Easy ? Ha ! ! It was easy for them to cheat you ! ! 
 Excuse me , Mr . Rodriguez ? Could I speak with you for a moment ? 
 Well , I ’ d like to talk about my new contract with you , if that ’ s all right . 
 I need help using the washer and dryer . 
 I can't figure out how to turn them on . 
 I didn't know I needed change . 
 Where do I put the change ? 
 Is that everything that I have to do ? 
 I appreciate you helping me with this . 
 Can I ask for leave this afternoon ? 
 I had a headache this morning . I didn ’ t pay attention to it . I thought probably it is because I didn ’ t sleep well . But now it is getting worse and worse . I feel quite dizzy now and my eyes are somehow very light-sensitive . Maybe it is the migrated . 
 Thank you very much . I am sure good rest will do indeed . I don ’ t have this too often . 
 Why ? Just read your notes.You can see what the professor stressed in the lectures.Probably the exam will ask about things he stressed . 
 Let me see them.Are these all the notes you have ? 
 But Laurie , how can you do well in school if you don't take more notes ? 
 I'm sure you don't write enough.Look at this . Here you wrote , Russian Revolution . 1917 . Bolsheviks . Real revolution , or coup ? And that's all ? I remember he lectured for a half hour about that question.And you didn't write any of it ! 
 Yes , but did you remember ? You need good notes to help you remember . 
 There are different things you can do.For one , the university offers a special free course on note-taking.You should go to the course . Also , I am pretty good at taking notes . I can help you on this exam . I will photocopy all my notes , and you can compare them to your notes.Then maybe you will see what kinds of things to write down . 
 Don't feel that way . I know you are very smart.Note - taking is a special skill . All students need to learn it.Some people are very smart , but they just haven't learned how to take notes yet . I'm lucky because I had a good English teacher in high school.She taught me how to take good notes . It's not hard . 
 Hello , Mr . Wang . I am glad to meet you here at the fair . 
 Sure . Thank you . It seems your business is prosperous . There are many customers here . 
 Well , what do you think of choosing a commission representative or agent abroad to promote your sales ? 
 We are willing to be your agent in Thailand for hand-held tools . What do you think ? 
 Then , what's your usual commission rate for your agents ? 
 4 % is too low , I think . You see , we have a lot of work to do in sales promotion , such as advertising on radio or TV , printing booklets , leaflets , catalogues and so on . It all costs money , 4 % is not enough . 
 You mean to saya 
 We may deduct the commission from the invoice value directly or remit it to you after payment . 
 Think it over . We hope to keep a good business relationship with you . 
 Do you like that vintage clock ? It's almost fifty years old . 
 Well , in the fifties , that clock used to be inside a drive-in burger joint . 
 This is one of my favorite items . 
 Can I help you ? 
 I recommend Pioneer . 
 This model is very popular with ladies . 
 Sure , it's multi-functional . Besides playing music , it can also be used to store documents and make recordings . 
 No , but we have it in yellow . 
 Please wait a second . I'll get it for you . 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Why not go to Paris ? It's famous for Arch of Triumph , Eiffel , versailles and place de la Concorde . 
 Of course , we have . 
 Yes , Marry ? 
 I see . 
 Maybe so . But I'm fast learner and I'm willing to work overtime to learn the business . 
 I must to ask you to reconsider your decision and give me a chance . 
 I didn't make the soccer team . 
 What do you think of this coffee table ? 
 How about this one ? 
 Alright , let's look at some others . 
 Moreover , it's easy to clean , right ? You are really lazy . 
 Thanks , I'm enough . 
 I'll have it if you insist . 
 Yep . There's still so much to do ! 
 Did you reconfirm the plane reservations for all the Taiwanese guests ? 
 Cool ! I can't believe he agreed to go all the way to Dallas with us ! 
 How do you like Tom ? 
 Are you ready to welcome him ? 
 Wow , Is winter always this cold in Taiwan ? 
 No , I am from south California . This is my first real winter . 
 What's the temperature today anyway ? 
 Do you like the apartment so far ? 
 What ’ s the problem ? 
 That ’ s no big deal . 
 What do you want me to do about it ? 
 I won ’ t be able to do that right now . 
 Fine , I ’ ll have it fixed for you . 
 are you ready to go to the bank ? 
 there ’ s problem with my bank statement . There ’ s a mistake on it . I also need to withdraw some money form the ATM . 
 that ’ s right . You ’ re going away next week . 
 I have to pay my credit bill too . If I don ’ t pay it soon , the credit card company will charge me interest . 
 Hi Anna , come in . 
 I know , I didn't have time to put things away before you got here . 
 Yes . 
 Actually most of them are dirty . I haven't done laundry in a while . I usually wait until I can do it at my parent's house . 
 I know I should , but that place isn't very convenient . You have to wait for a long time . 
 No I'm not ready yet . I still have to brush my teeth and wash my face . Can you wait for a few minutes ? 
 Looking through your C . V . , I see that you graduated from Oklahoma State University . Can you tell me what training you have had that would specifically relate to the cable television Industry ? 
 I see . Did you have anything specific in mind ? 
 That ’ s impressive . How would you make that pay ? 
 I see you have several good ideas . Now , I just have a few questions about your C . V . I notice that there is a five-year gap between your last job and now . 
 So , you ’ re just starting back . Maybe you ’ d better tell me a little more about your experience . 
 But they are so silly ! They're not art ! 
 James Cameron , of course . 
 Well , nobody's perfect ! 
 He's late again . Traffic is probably holding him up . You know , he commutes from the suburbs . It's not easy commuting every day . We should cut him some slack . 
 Oh , that's right . Well , the train shouldn't be late . That means there is only one explanation ... Bill must have overslept . 
 That's right , because he's got to get to the train station from his house , then take the blue line into the city , then switch trains to the red line . In all , the trip's got to take more than 2 hours . 
 It's too difficult to park your car in the city . Also , the traffic coming in from the suburbs is a nightmare . 
 Coffee ? I don ’ t honestly like that kind of stuff . 
 What ’ s wrong with that ? Cigarette is the thing I go crazy for . 
 I heard that janet has got a new job . She ’ s working for the united investment group . I hear that they pay very well . 
 now , she ’ ll be able to save up for that holiday in the united states . 
 you ’ re right . By the way , did you hear that tom inherited some money recently ? 
 they did . He inherited the money form an uncle . I hope he doesn ’ t lose a lot of it in taxed to the government . 
 he said that he would probably invest most of it . He ’ s got a well-paid job , so he doesn ’ t need the money to cover day-to day expenses . He just wants some extra money available for when he retires . 
 really ? Have you won a fortune in the lottery ? 
 It certainly was ! So , what are you going to do with your windfall ? 
 Hi , John , I am trying to find a carpenter . 
 Well , I want to build a deck in my back yard . 
 So I can have a special place to hang out with friends , and also do some barbecuing on weekends . 
 You ? Do you have a carpenter's license ? 
 Wow ! That's cool . So , let me give you some details about the deck I want . 
 I'd like my deck to be at the same level as the back door . 
 Yes , the back door is about four or five steps higher than the ground . 
 I don't like things to be fancy . 
 Hmm , that's good . Can you use cedar or redwood to build it ? 
 Well , let's take the measurements right now . 
 No one . 
 I really need to start eating healthier . 
 What kind of food do you usually eat ? 
 Is that really all that you eat ? 
 How do you stick to only those foods ? 
 Yeah , I know , but what about the chicken ? 
 That does sound pretty good . 
 Have you had any kind of punishment in your college ? 
 What was it for ? 
 Have you made a reservation ? 
 We have had a window table reserved for you . This way , please . 
 You're welcome . 
 I'll bring it over . 
 We have squirrel shaped mandarin fish , seeds prawn , etc . 
 That is a long line . 
 A lot of things are prohibited to take on the plane ? 
 Understand . Do I need to take out my laptop from my suitcase ? 
 That is really strict . 
 Hello , I wish to speak to Mr.Zhang . 
 Oh , how do you do , Mr.Zhang ? This is Mary speaking , I have a present for you from Wu of Beijing . 
 Mr.Wu had told me that you were coming to Changchun . May I call on you at your hotel tomorrow ? 
 Great . Then I'll be at your hotel at two . 
 How could I get there ? 
 what's your room number ? 
 I'll do that , Mr.Zhang , See you tomorrow . 
 After the financial crisis , many industries are in incredibly cloudy situations . How do you think about our company ? 
 As the department I am applying for is expanding , I would like to contribute by effort . 
 Hello , this is Wang Lu and I am calling to confirm my reservation . 
 It's ZN741 to Atlanta on July 1st . 
 Chen Hong , too . 
 Thank you vary much . 
 Yeah how ’ d you know ? 
 Yeah ! I just started my training today and I ’ m not really sure where to begin . 
 Well , I don ’ t want to be ripped like you ! I just want a good physique with weights and Carpio . 
 Got it ! Wow is that the weight you are lifting ? My goodness that ’ s a lot of weight ! 
 Waiter , we'd like a menu first , please . 
 Well , we are waiting for two friends , so could we just have a look at the menu for a while ? 
 Hey , How's it going ? 
 Oh , that's too bad . Was it stolen ? 
 Is there anything I can do ? 
 Sure , how much do you need ? 
 That's no problem . 
 That'll be fine . Here you are . 
 I'm going to buy some books and then I'm going to the gas station . 
 OK . I'll wait for you . 
 I ’ m not so satisfied with it . 
 I'm now a secretary in my present work unit . My work is not interesting . I have to type , make copies , book tickets and so on . Everyday I follow the routine . Furthermore , I have studied English for four years at university , but I can ’ t use it there . They are the reasons I plan to change my job . 
 One of my relatives told me that your company needs someone who can speak English . That's just the job that I have been looking for 
 Stockholders meetings are held biannually . Usually the meetings are scheduled for spring and fall . In between the meetings , each stockholder receives biannual reports . Financial statements are made once a year . 
 You're right , it's a low percentage . Also , in order to attend meetings , you have to hold a certain amount of shares . It's quite a large number , so most of the stockers are excluded from proceedings . 
 Unless they're united , very little ... 
 There are many ways ; what kind of job would you like ? 
 Fine ! Will you need part-time or full-time work ? 
 Fine , the two best ways are to use our local listings binders over there or you can use the computers with the Internet job listing sites . See them over there ? 
 Well , in addition , you can schedule an appointment with a job counselor on this list . If you would like to do that , sign here , OK ? 
 Fine , well the job search tools are all here for you to use . Feel free to look around and use what works best for you . Have fun with it ! 
 That's unavoidable , but think , How would you keep up to date without television ? 
 Look , you can still learn a lot from watching television , you just need to be smart when you're watching . Filter the information and decide if you believe what you are hearing or not . 
 Really ? Why ? 
 Again , you need to think carefully . If you don't trust others online , have nothing to do with them . 
 Yes , it is . Which department for ? 
 What's your problem then ? 
 OK , I will register you with medical department . 
 Yes . Just go there ! 
 It's on the second floor . Have you got your records ? 
 OK , here is your registration card . 
 Not good . My cousin is driving me up the wall . 
 He stays up untill all hours of the night , and he never lifts a finger to help . 
 Not yet , but I have to soon . He's eating me out of house and home . I caught him reading the fridge again last night 
 This is no laughing matter , Nick . 
 He watch the tob too much . Now really I don't know . But I can't handle this much longer . 
 The boss is mad at you . 
 The mosquitos are biting me ! 
 Do you have any bug spray ? 
 Then we ’ ll have to put up with it . 
 That ’ s without a doubt , the best idea you ’ Ve had ! Let ’ s do it ! 
 I want to buy a gift for my father . Will you go with me to choose one for him ? 
 Don't you know ? Tomorrow is Father's Day . 
 You also need to choose a gift for your father , right ? 
 What do you think of his behaviour yesterday ? 
 I don't think so . He only had no common sense . 
 My goodness ! It ’ s the afternoon ? Doesn ’ t the time fly ! Do come in and sit down . 
 What ’ s the time ? My watch has stopped . 
 When do you have lunch ? 
 What do you normally eat ? 
 Oh , it ’ s time to have lunch now . 
 Good morning . My name is John Smith . I'm an import manager . 
 Nice to meet You , Ms . Thou . We've learned that you specialize in the export of electronic products . 
 Yes . I had a look just now . I found some of the exhibits of excellent quality and beautiful design . I feel we 
 So , Ms . Thou , we're a newly-established company , but we have wide connections with wholesalers and retailers all over America . 
 Sure . 
 Really ? Why ? 
 I'm surprised . He does't look like a guy who'd ever cheat on his wife , does he ? 
 Well , I'm really surprised . You are not doing anything behind my back , are you ? 
 Haha ... You are not very funny . I guess that means - - except me to tell my lover we have stoped seeing each other too . 
 I'll have a whole-wheat loaf , three white loaves , a baguette and ten rolls , please . How much is that ? 
 There you go . 
 The total cost is 850 dollars . How would you like to pay ? 
 We take Visa and Master Card . 
 No , we don't . 
 Thank you ... please sign on the line . 
 Does your boss pay you for the over-time work ? 
 He should know that this is against the Labor Law in our country . Legally , employees should get double pay if asked to do extra work during the weekend or on holidays . 
 I suggest that you go to the lawyers ' office to get some help . 
 Excuse me , I would like to know something about this campus . Right now it seems very big and confusing ! I have no idea where I am going or what I am doing . 
 Yes , I have , but it doesn ’ t help me very much . I ’ m not very good at reading maps . 
 More or less . I go to three different buildings , and always get there late . I feel so hopeless . I don ’ t know why I am late all the time . No one else seems to be . 
 Operator . 
 I'll be happy to try . 
 May I have your name and room number , please ? 
 I don't think we come here at a right time . 
 The museum doesn't open today . 
 Where shall we go now ? 
 Hello , Chandler ! How are you ? 
 Just so so . I am too tired . My company has been holding too many training sessions lately . 
 Good ? ! For them but not to me . 
 We have to participate in training after a busy day and during the weekend . You know , after work all you want to do is throw yourself onto your bed . And during the Weekend , you just want to stay at home and enjoy a family dinner . 
 Yes , I agree with you on the point but couldn't the training be held during the working day instead of weekend ? 
 Hi , Julie . I was in your neighborhood and I'd like to drop by . 
 That sounds refreshing . Thanks ! 
 He can barely make ends meet . 
 Oh , you are so efficient . I thought you might give it to me tomorrow . Thanks . 
 This is encouraging news , good for you ! What is your solution , then ? 
 Sounds not bad ! Better performance isn ’ t just about doing a lot more . It is about focusing on the right things to do . 
 I am sorry . I've already gone through my paycheck for the week . 
 Not me . You know money always burns a hole in my pocket . 
 Tell me about it ! It's like the whole world is broiling . 
 I hope it's not gonna break into three digits 
 Well , I just hope it'll level off . 
 I guess so . What else can we do ? You can ’ t stay in the heat for long . 
 It depends . 
 I feel dizzy and weak . And I'm having this pain in my ear . I think I am sick . 
 No , this is the second time . 
 Why this happens to me when I am on the plane ? I feel bad . 
 What should I do about it ? 
 OK , thanks . Does it work really ? I'll give a try . 
 Much better . Thank you . I just feel tired but I can't fall asleep . 
 I am not used to wearing that . Thanks . 
 Thank you so much . 
 Yes . I'd like to travel to London . So I want you to make a reservation for me on May 1st . 
 That's great ! I'd like to take the first available flight . I'll need an economy ticket 
 One way trip . What's the fare , please ? 
 I see . Is my ticket confirmed then ? 
 Here is 2,300 yuan . 
 Mr . McKenna , do you have a second ? I need to talk to you about something . 
 Well , I was just wondering . . . you see , I know I ’ Ve used up all my vacation days this year , but my sister is getting married , and the wedding is overseas , and , well . . . 
 Well , sir , I was just hoping that I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year . 
 I was thinking of taking off from September first until the thirtieth . Would you be okay with that ? 
 Could you tell me something about your previous job ? 
 Didn't you like it ? 
 What made you make a decision to leave ?

 My goodness ! My silk dress is shrunk . How did you wash it ? 
 It should be handwashed with cold water . It's a common sense . Don't you know it ? 
 That's all right . Please ask me if you don't know how to do something next time . You can keep the silk dress if you don't mind . I think it fits you .

 Wow , what a great burd ! 
 She's a real turn-on our rights . 
 Yeah , I noticed . She must be really loaded . 
 Lucky her . Anyway , I think that is just as beautiful . 
 Well , that's my opinion . 
 Oh , there is no comparison . Now we are talking but ugly .

 What can I get for you ? Here is the menu . 
 We have sirloin steaks , pepper steak , and filet steak .

 I am worried . 
 My exam . 
 I feel very nervous about it .

 It's one day more or one day less from Tokyo to London ? 
 It means that we will arrive on the same day . 
 Do you like traveling , Kathy ? 
 Or getting stuck in traffic jams when you ’ re driving . 
 Hi , Mary , you have been a secretary for several years in this company . Could you tell me what a secretary should do for a meeting or a conference ? 
 What should a secretary do to prepare for a meeting ? Can you tell me a bit more about it ? 
 I see , and how about the documents and the information ? 
 And what should a secretary do during the meeting ? 
 And after the meeting ? 
 It's seriously good . 
 Let me check . Hold on , please ... Yes , that's fine . Smoking or nonsmoking area ? 
 All right . May I have your name ? 
 How do you spell it , sir ? 
 Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? The same is true in the West . 
 You mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? That goes in like with Confucius ' preachings , right ? 
 Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ? 
 Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ? 
 Good morning , sir . Have you reserved ? 
 Let me see . Oh , yes . Your room number is 503 . The porter will lead you to your room . 
 What's the name of the singer who sings this song ? 
 It's on the tip of my tongue . I think it starts with a ' B ' .

 Old Dyson looks as if he maybe kick the bucket any day . 
 I ’ Ve ever seen a living being looked so thin . 
 Maybe you are right . 
 That is a part of chinese culture , if they think you are a lovely child , they touch your head and say , how cute you are . 
 Well , you get used to it , different countries have different manners . 
 They are just been in friendly , when you are in Roman , do as the Romans do , that means you need to adapt to your enviroment . 
 Then you might need to pretend to be a little crazy .

 Tiffany , why are more and more people turning to the Web to find a mate ? 
 There are actually special sites for people looking to date within their specific ethnic group and age group . But how should you screen potential mates ? Do you suggest talking to them on the phone right away or communicating via e-mail ? 
 Can you give us any other safety tips for people pursuing relationships on the Net ? 
 Besides the growth of these matchmaker sites , do you have any stats on success rates ? Are people out there finding true and lasting love through the Internet 
 Do you have any successful stories to share ?

 I might make nothing even if I stay . For that kind of risk , I want to get rich . 
 Mmm ... it is delicious . 
 Yes . It's superb . 
 In fact , could I ask you for the recipe ? 
 Yes , I've got it . 
 Wait a minute . I didn't catch you there . Could you repeat that ? 
 Now , I've got it . Thank you . 
 Of course not . 
 I'm afraid I don't know how to use your camera . 
 I see . 
 Hello , Mrs Turnbull . How are you ? 
 He's a bit tired . You know , he goes to school at eight o'clock every morning.He doesn't get home till after four . then he does his homework after tea . It often takes him a couple of hours to finish 
 School , you mean ? Yes , he does . He likes his teachers , and that always makes difference . 
 No , he walks . He likes walking . He meets some of his friends at the corner another go together . 
 My husband takes him in the car . He passes the school on the way to the office . 
 Show me your card , please . 
 That's right , sir . Here are your tickets . Have a nice day . 
 Can you do me a favor ? 
 Can you keep an eye on my bag , please ? Nature's calling . 
 No , I just want to use the bathroom . 
 Where are you planning on transferring to ? 
 Where do you want to go ? 
 You haven ’ t thought about it ? 
 Why don ’ t you just continue going to PCC ? 
 It ’ s a great school . 
 So , have you made your decision yet ?

 We're getting ready to place our Christmas orders and we need to know about how much it's going to run this year.You know , so we can have the funds put aside . 
 Right , a ballpark figure is fine , and slant it a little high if you have to .

 Hello Michael . 
 We're going to talk about Australia . Or your going to talk about Australia . So first of all how any people live in Australia ? 
 OK . What are the biggest cities ? 
 OK . Um , if you had to live in one place where would you live ? 
 Oh , nice . Actually , what is the capital city of Australia ? 
 I just got fired . 
 How can I help you , sir ? 
 Sorry , could you tell me your name ? 
 Do you have an appointment ? 
 I guess she forgot your meeting . She is attending an important meeting in the company . Will you have a seat ? May I leave a memo for her ? 
 She will be back soon . 
 Yes . I am calling to make sure if flight CG877 will arrive on time ? 
 You mean it will arrive two hours later than usual ? 
 OK , thank you . 
 Yes . Show me the sweaters , please . 
 Well , could you bring me all the styles of pullovers ? I am not quite sure which one I will buy . 
 Is this seat taken ? 
 Hey , Terry , have all the players got here ? 
 OK . By the way , the stadium is terrific . 
 We are lucky to play in a new stadium . 
 Look out . Catch the ball . You should dunk besides the three-point line . 
 Just calm down . It's just a turnover . Make up your mind and we can shoot well . 
 No problem , I once played a 2 - meter-high player successfully . 
 But that game he dunked over me for 13 times . 
 Oh , look , what's happened to Jack ? He sat down . 
 are you working overtime again ? Over the last two weeks , you have worked overtime every day without a break ! Your company is draining the life out of you ! 
 Well , I hope they're paying you the big bucks for all this work ... 
 What ? ! Isn't there a law against that , I think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages . You should know your rights ! If you are putting in so many hours , they should give you some kind of compensation . 
 That's just wrong ! why don't you just quit ? 
 it sounds like any job will be better than the one you have now ! 
 Looking at the beautiful creatures and listening to their songs are such wonderful experiences . I feel as if I'm in direct contact with nature . 
 You bet . You should try it yourself . 
 Well , they ’ re completely different . Reading is passive , and writing is active . 
 In reading you need to recognize language by seeing the words on the page and knowing what they are . In writing you have to produce language , you have to create your own words on a blank page . 
 A reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from a writing knowledge . Don ’ t you think so ? 
 Exactly . 
 They ’ re both harder than reading or writing . 
 Because they are direct communication with another person , and there ’ s a time limit . This time limit is the most serious problem for foreigners , even for those who know lots of English . 
 I ’ m not trying to discourage you . I ’ m trying to help you . You have to live with these difficulties . Isn ’ t it better to know about them ? The more you know about what you have to face , the better you ’ ll do . I promise ! 
 Yes , it's not very far from here . Follow this road until you get to the traffic lights . You will see a small restaurant at the corner . 
 It is on the right . But it is on the other side of the lights . 
 You go straight on at the lights , but just past the restaurant building there is a small road to your right . 
 Yes , you need to turn right and follow that road for about four minutes . You will see the Post Office on your left . 
 Yes and it is quite a big building so you won't miss it . There is also a small supermarket next to it . 
 You're welcome . 
 I'm Bill . I'm in Room 908 . Can you change the room for me ? It's too noisy . My wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . She said it was too much for her . 
 Anyhow , I'd like to change our room . 
 All right . I hope we'll be able to enjoy our stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep . 
 Did you hear what's going on downtown today ? All the orders from the factory are staging a demonstration in the streets . Not one of the two thousand employees showed up for work today , and they have gathered outside the city hall to demand better working conditions for all factory employees . 
 I think they gained courage after the mayor's speech last week on equality and opportunity for all town citizens . Anyway , the sentiments have been brewing for quite some time . I mean , we all know the working conditions at the factory are quite horrendous . 
 They want raises and medical insurance , and I think they want to clean up the factory's safety hazards . That's probably the most important issue . 
 Yes , at your company , I think . I'm Frank . 
 Nice meeting you , too . 
 I could help you with that . 
 I promise you that I have the time to do this . If I didn't , I wouldn't offer to help . 
 Tomorrow night would work for me . 
 OK , and I'll bring some information that helped me with my presentation . 
 See you tomorrow night . 
 I can't agree with you . She's pretty , but she always blows hot and cold . 
 She's my sister , you know . 
 Saint Jude-he's the saint of lost causes . Like my cousin , Anna , who can't stop getting pregnant . She's a lost cause . 
 Yep . She's always got a bun in the oven . She was pregnant before marriage-a real sin in the Catholic Church . 
 Ha-ha . Birth control and abortion are four-letter words in my family . 
 I'm calling about you appointment.Mr.Smith has to cancel all his appointments because he's got something urgent to attend to . 
 Anytime except today.Please give him a call before you come . 
 Would you like to mail it by air or sea ? 
 About 10 days . You can send it express mail if you need it faster . It will only take three or four days . 
 OK , the postage is 275 yuan . 
 This is the receipt , please keep it . Have a good day . 
 Mary didn't pass the final exam in physics . 
 Her parents scolded her severely and she's very depressed now . 
 Hey Joe , how have you been ? 
 I am doing OK , Joe . 
 I can't because I already promised my roommate that I would go shopping with her . 
 Did you have a certain movie in mind ? 
 I kind of wanted to see “ The Secret Life of Bees . ” 
 Why are you so rude to your wife ? 
 But she means to help you , not to trouble you . 
 Were you in a leadership position when you were a college student ? 
 Did you get any honors or awards at your university ? 
 Were you involved in any club activities at your university ? 
 What extracurricular activities did you usually take part in at your college ? 
 Can I help you find something ? 
 Is there one in particular that you like ? 
 Ah yes , that is a great refrigerator . 
 It's both affordable and it comes with all the appliances . 
 It comes with an ice maker , water dispenser , and there is a lot of room inside . 
 Be my guest . 
 I'm a little rushed . Is there any quicker way to get there ? 
 How much will that run me ? 
 Do the drivers speak English ? 
 Are they safe ? 
 Hi Jane , can you let me know the best way to get to your house this evening ? 
 I need to be in the city centre this afternoon so I will be coming straight from there . 
 Got that . 
 Hold on , I am looking at the map now . Ok , I can see Horntown Road . Do I go straight at the intersection ? 
 Ok , I can see that road . 
 Good , I can see the library on the map . 
 That's great , see you at seven . 
 What is it ? 
 Let me see . Wanted , manager for up-and-coming firm . Must have good organizational skills . Experience a plus . Please contact Susan Lee . Oh , I don't know ... 
 What about my resume ? 
 Thanks , Mary . You are real pal . I'll call now to set up an interview . 
 Because Myra was cheating on exams , and she spoke back rudely . 
 Hi , is that Jason ? 
 I am calling to let you know that you are expected to come for an interview in our branch . 
 You can bring life photos , recommendation letters and certificates . 
 ok . I should have it finished by Friday afternoon . Then I can check those account over the weekend . We need to have them finished by Monday , right ? 
 from next week on , we should be in less of a rush . 
 don ’ t say that yet . A new project could suddenly appear . 
 carol said that she would spend some time checking that everyone is up-to-date with their work . 
 they usually go on for ages . 
 I will . Enjoy your meeting ! 
 and what if it doesn't work out , right ? 
 You need to quit thinking like a loser . invoking is going to kick butt . You know how I know ? 
 Because I won't let it fail . 
 So , this is the worst story I ’ Ve heard this month . You have my real sympathy , Tim . 
 I understand how you feel , but you ’ Ve gotta learn to move on .
