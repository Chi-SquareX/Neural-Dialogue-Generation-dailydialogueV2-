Say , Jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ? 
 What do you mean ? It will help us to relax . 
 I guess you are right.But what shall we do ? I don't feel like sitting at home . 
 That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play pingpong.Perhaps we can make a foursome with them . 
 Good.Let ' s go now . 
 Can you do push-ups ? 
 Really ? I think that's impossible ! 
 Yeah ! 
 Can you study with the radio on ? 
 What is the difference ? 
 That's true , but then you have to buy a record player . 
 I will be all right soon . I was terrified when I watched them fall from the wire . 
 I see . 
 Yeah , I just got them . I started playing ice hockey in a community league . So , I finally got myself new skates . 
 I ’ m a defender . It ’ s a lot of fun . You don ’ t have to be able to skate as fast on defense . 
 Oh , yeah ? Which team ? 
 Really ? I think we play you guys next week . Well , I have to go to practice . See you later . 
 Hey Lydia , what are you reading ? 
 What are you talking about ? Let me see that ... What are horoscopes ? 
 January 5th . 
 That ’ s bogus . I don't feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense . 
 Well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ? 
 Frank ’ s getting married , do you believe this ? 
 Yes , he is . He loves the girl very much . 
 A girl he met on holiday in Spain , I think . 
 Not yet . 
 That ’ s right , we bought it the same day we came on the market . 
 It ’ s a wonderful Spanish style . 
 And it ’ s a bargaining . A house like this in river side costs double the price . 
 No , it has three bedrooms and three beds , and has a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling . There ’ s a two-car garage . 
 Yeas , when will you buy a house ? 
 Right , congratulations . 
 Hi , Becky , what's up ? 
 What's the problem ? 
 For example ? 
 No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen . 
 My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun . 
 We basically sat her down and told her how we felt about her constant criticizing , and how we welcomed her advice but hoped she'd let us do our things . She understood , and now everything is a lot more peaceful . 
 How are Zina's new programmers working out ? 
 So you'll make the Stars.com deadline , and have us up and running next week ? 
 Good . After Stars.com starts paying us , we won't need Vikam's cash anymore . 
 Do you like cooking ? 
 Why do you like it ? 
 That's wonderful ! 
 Really ? I hope I can have a chance to taste it . Don't forget to tell me . 
 Anyone home ? Jen ! 
 Wow ! You're really working up a storm ! 
 You look like a cooking show host--only messier . 
 Thanks . I just got back from summer camp . 
 Great . I got to try so many things for the first time . 
 I went sailing , fishing , and horseback riding . 
 The counselors were so nice too . It was the best summer ever . Except for all those mosquitoes ! 
 It ’ s good . But to tell you the truth , I don ’ t wear perfume . 
 That ’ s all right . Thank you all the same . 
 All right , Bill.Here ' s your daily exercise schedule . You are to jog before breakfast . 
 Then , you are to walk to work . 
 Thirty minutes in gym at lunch time . 
 Use the stairs , never the elevator . 
 And three times a week , you can either swim , play racketball , or hand ball . 
 OK , you can stop now.It ' s time for the dance class . 
 You will . 
 Hi Bill , I saw your grandma yesterday . 
 I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track . 
 Well , it pays off for her.How old is she anyway ? 
 That is truly amazing ! 
 No problem , what class would you like to take ? 
 There are two classes that are still open . 
 The first class is a Tuesday and Thursday class from two to three . 
 The other class is on Monday and Wednesday from 10 am - 12 . 
 I'm positive . 
 Okay , I'll sign you up . 
 Honey , a typhoon is coming . 
 Jenny , come and help , we need to prepare more food . 
 Hi , my name is Lean , and I'm from Russia . 
 To me English is a difficult language . 
 True , but English is harder than most . It's a crazy language . 
 One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings . 
 Can I help you ? 
 I'll certainly try to help you . What topic is your paper on ? 
 There are several possible sources you might use for that topic . I suggest you use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television . 
 Here ’ s your hot dog and beer . What happened ? Did I miss anything ? 
 What ’ s the score ? 
 So Baltimore is winning ? 
 This is a really great place to watch a baseball game . 
 The fans are great here , too . Not like in Philadelphia . 
 Yeah , it reminds you why they say baseball is America ’ s favorite pastime . 
 Perfect . It really hits the spot . 
 Sorry , I don't smoke . 
 Were you ? your performance was excellent . 
 Excuse me . Could you please take a picture of us with this camera ? 
 This one . 
 No , this is a focus-free camera . All you have to do is point and press the button . 
 Every country should face the history . 
 Sometimes , we , human beings , really had done something wrong , so we should admit it at first . 
 I believe such things won ’ t be realized , just daydreaming . 
 I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . But I don ’ t like traveling to work , waiting for buses , or ... 
 Exactly . 
 I do wish I could afford one . 
 Of course I know that . But don't you notice that the house price is skyrocketing ? 
 How do you do , Ms . Yang.You speak very good English . 
 Where did you learn it ? 
 It's amazing . 
 White , please 
 I don't like Folk music very much . 
 I like classical music . Do you ? 
 I don't believe you . 
 You are funny ! 
 What do you like to do in your spare time ? 
 Do you have any hobbies besides playing chess ? 
 Do you have any hobbies like playing tennis or things like that ? 
 Can you tell me why you like it ? 
 Where is John ? I can't find him anywhere . 
 What ? Beg your pardon . 
 I just cann't believe my ears ! 
 I hope so . I'm looking for some material for a paper I'm writing , and I'm not quite sure where to look . 
 My paper is on the influence of television on children . 
 Thank you for you help . 
 Well , I have the day off from work . 
 Well , I ’ Ve been working so hard lately , so I ’ ll probably just take it easy . 
 Yeah , I ’ ll probably just stay in and relax . Maybe watch a few movies . 
 Sure . Any time . 
 Yes , I do . I think that science is making us wiser . What do you think ? 
 I believe industry is making us wealthier . 
 And in my opinion , medicine is making us healthier . 
 I don ’ t agree with you . I maintain that we ’ re healthier , wealthier and wiser than we were a hundred years ago . 
 What do you plan to do for your birthday ? 
 How about a party at home ? That way we can get together and celebrate it . 
 How may I help you ? 
 Is that all you need ? 
 Is that all you would like to check out ? 
 Do you have your library card ? 
 Make sure to take proper care of this video . 
 If you damage the video , you will be fined . 
 What's the matter with you then ? You look miserable . 
 What do you mean by us . 
 That's right . 
 I ... I ... I miss my parents , also they miss me . 
 You mean I am groaned a few words ? 
 Hi , Mary . You look pale today . What's the matter with you ? 
 You'd better take some medicine and have a good rest . I hope you'll be yourself pretty soon . 
 I feel like going for a drink , it's been a long day . 
 How about the new bar across road ? 
 I agree , I had lunch there last week . 
 Could you tell me the right time , please ? 
 You have to go and fix it . 
 does your family have a record of your ancestors ? 
 do you have a copy of your family tree in your house ? I ’ d love to see it . 
 that ’ s amazing . Do you have a large extended family ? 
 are you very close to your first-cousins ? 
 I see . who ’ s the head of your household ? 
 that ’ s interesting . What does your grandfather think of your step-mother ? 
 that ’ s pretty much how you feel about your step-mother . Like grandmother , like grandson . 
 Sounds interesting , I haven't gone boating for some time now , and what time ? 
 Sure . Where shall I meet you ? 
 Great . I look forward to meeting you . 
 See you . 
 Yes , it's so exciting , though I had the most falls in our skiing team . 
 Of course there is . The top-level coaches there are from the State Sports General Administration . 
 Yes.My face even ached in the icy wind . 
 I was skiing on and on excitedly until I realized one thing-I could not stop ! You can just imagine how terrified I was . 
 You look pale recently . 
 Take good care of yourself . 
 Hey , Maggy , Did you hear about David ? 
 You know , about David and his new boss . 
 Well , I heard David has been fired . 
 how do you usually get to school ? 
 I feel that I can see more when I pedal a bicycle , but when I feel lazy , I drive my car . 
 I agree , but I would find it difficult to stop using my car . It's just so convenient . 
 do you have a car ? 
 maybe if I sold my car now , I wouldn't be so tempted to use it . 
 that's true . Every month , I spend hundreds of dollars on gas , insurance , and repairs . 
 I could stand to lose a few pounds . Having a car has made me lazy . I never end up walking anywhere ! 
 sounds good ! Let's go ! 
 His nose is out of joint because we forgot to invite him to the party . 
 Study , study , study . I want to learn a lot . 
 Yes . I am going to take some university courses there . 
 Yes , but I think it's probably for the best . 
 Hey , I am a pretty cool guy . I will make friends , and I'll have a lot of extracurricular activities too . You know , like fencing , or theater or something . 
 Well , do you think I have to ? 
 Please look at the sky.Don ' t you see the dark clouds ? It's going to rain soon . 
 But I don't think it's so nice . 
 The weather report says it's going to rain for a whole week . 
 On , darn . The grocery store is closed . 
 Alright . We are out of everything . 
 I know , our schedules are so weird . Sometimes , the little corner store is the only thing within walking distance that ’ s open when we get home . 
 I know . Three dollars for milk . 
 You can count on it . 
 I like him.He ' s good for her . 
 Dad , where are we off to ? 
 Where are we going to have a drink ? 
 Yes ? 
 Good . I will have hot chocolate . 
 When crossing the road you must always pay attention to what's around you . 
 I am not sure . We will ask for directions in the coffee shop . 
 How about going to the cinema tonight ? 
 I am not sure about the name of the film , but I know it's a romantic one . 
 Don't you think it's too bloody ? 
 I feel so uncomfortable . 
 No . The teacher is dragging the chalk over the blackboard . It set my teeth on edge . 
 I have made up my mind . I am getting a tattoo . 
 Yeah ! Why not ? They are trendy and look great ! I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back . 
 Really ? 
 Oh , I didn ’ t know that ! I thought they just paint it on your skin or something . 
 Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing ! 
 It's a portable TV . It's a popular thing now . 
 News about current affairs , documentaries , music , movies , noncommercial ads and so on . 
 Yes , there are something good and informative . I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education . 
 Of course . Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs . 
 Not always . It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals . 
 Yes , 50 Yuan per month . 
 How dreadful ! 
 Oh , dear . That ’ s terrible . Not at all what I expected . 
 I can ’ t bear to look at it . I ’ m rather disappointed . 
 What do you do in your free time , Nancy ? 
 Really ? How long have you been playing the violin ? 
 That's really interesting . 
 Well , I like collecting matchbox ! I'm not sure if that counts , though . 
 How can I tell her about this ? 
 There is no need to be so frustrated . 
 Don't worry , you'll find a way . 
 I like baseball and basketball . 
 In my country football is brand new , so I never learned the game when I was younger . 
 Yeah . I heard a lot about it . Is it really that fun ? 
 Are you a football player ? 
 What is two hand touch and flag football ? 
 I see . It's safer then right ? 
 I'll give it a try . Give me a call and let's go down together . 
 Great . 
 My parents called . As usual , they reminded me again that I should have a plan to marry by my late 20s . Easier said then done . Who should I marry ? I have no time to go on a date . 
 I will find one myself , of course . I ’ m a modern girl . 
 You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , I hate that idea . 
 I don ’ t think it makes sense . Three minutes is such a short time . 
 Anyway , I don ’ t want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that . 
 I don ’ t want to post my personal information on the internet . I ’ m not knowing who is reading it . 
 I was thinking about it . Are you ? 
 Really ? Well , what time does it start ? 
 Well , who all is going to be there ? 
 How do you know it's going to be so fun ? 
 Wow , that does sound like it's going to be fun . 
 Yeah , I will be there . 
 Step into my office for a moment . What is your concern ? 
 Let's go on the computer to see what's up . Do you think you are doing well ? 
 I can see that you are trying , but where do you think you could improve ? 
 Having a regular study routine and following it is very important , right ? 
 Thanks for stopping by ! 
 Thanks . 
 What happened ? Quarrel again ? 
 Don't ask me . I don't wanna be involved in your quarrel . 
 What ? What did you buy ? 
 What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? 
 And ? 
 And it's a brick ? 
 I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? 
 So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . 
 But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? 
 Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! 
 That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . 
 Is the clock right ? 
 By how many minutes ? 
 Hey , Mary , what's up ? 
 Oh , that's exciting . What does this guy look like ? Is he hot ? 
 It seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ? 
 Well , that's something I've never heard of . But if you ask me what I value most in a friend , I would say honesty . 
 Yeah , I know . A friend in need is a friend indeed . I don't need fair-weather friends either . 
 Yeah , my head hurts , that ’ s all . I ’ Ve been in physics class all day . It ’ s killer ! 
 Yeah , yeah , but today ’ s lesson was all about the creation of the universe . 
 It ’ s all religion . Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion ? That ’ s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff . 
 Math , sheath . What ’ s the evidence ? 
 Anyway , it ’ s just a theory . Why do people go around touting theories ? Where ’ s the scientific rigor in that ? 
 Today more and more people advocate lifelong learning . But people have different views about lifelong learning . How do you understand lifelong learning ? 
 Does that mean studying all the time ? 
 Then the axiom - ' You can't teach an old dog new tricks ' doesn't work any longer . 
 Yes , I agree with you . When I retired I will participate in programs to keep momentally active . 
 You know what ? I've recently been teaching myself French . 
 Yes , so I want to learn French to develop my career . 
 Nine ... but I'll be ten on May 1st.When is your birthday ? 
 Are you going to have a birthday party ? 
 It smells like an ashtray in here ! 
 What ’ s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking . 
 Look , there are other ways to quit . You can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . It ’ s not like you can just light up like before . 
 Fine ! I want a divorce ! 
 It's freezing . 
 I get antsy not because you praise a guy , but because you may be taken for a ride by a guy like him . 
 Because you seem to have lost your vigilance . You should be on the watch out . 
 Isn't there anything that sounds fishy ? 
 All-right guy ? All right . Let's talk about something else instead . 
 I think so . Maybe that ’ s why it ’ s cheap here . 
 Sure , I have . Will you join ? 
 You are right . Our company ’ s Christmas party has always been an amazing occasion for everybody to relax and get to know each other better . It is also a time to make new friends and do some networking . 
 No , it will not be formal at all . It is a fun time . You will love the game show . Please dress casually . Usually there is an over abandon of drinks , so be careful with that . 
 If the weatherman's predictions are accurate , it should rain tomorrow . 
 hi , Emily , do you know that guy over there ? 
 He is cute.What dose he do ? 
 Really ? Are you going to introduce us ? 
 You didn't ring me last night . You said you would . 
 That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch . 
 And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ? 
 Hi , Nicole . Did you have a good weekend ? 
 Really ? Why ? 
 And I bet you studied , too . 
 Well , I didn't clean the house and I didn't study . I stayed in bed and watched TV . 
 Sort of . I played golf on my computer ! 
 What's the route ? 
 If only I could join it ! 
 Oh , dear . 
 Oh , well , I looked around . There wasn't any other space . I waited a while and nobody came . I'm sorry if I've taken your place . 
 I ’ m not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ? 
 I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly . 
 Did she ? That ’ s great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the enviroment . 
 Oh , he ’ s fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays . 
 I had mine when I was 24 . that ’ s a little young . I ’ d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career . 
 Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ? 
 Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom . 
 I'm going to Japan this year on vacation . 
 No , but I'd really like to . 
 Hey , Mark , long time no see . 
 Great . I just got back from a week's vacation in Thailand . 
 Fantastic ! I didn't want to come back . 
 They are . And not only that the people are friendly , but also the food is delicious , not to mention cheap . 
 Not much . I've got enough city life in Beijing . 
 Hey , wouldn't it be great if we could go to Thailand together sometime ? 
 Could I see the manager please ? I have a complaint to make . 
 Did you have the room checked before we move in ? 
 1808 . The toilet doesn ’ t work properly , the water doesn ’ t run in the shower . 
 Congratulations , Vivian . You won the grand prize , again . 
 You did ? How ? Did you wear red underwear again this year ? 
 Tell me ! Tell me ! What's your secret ? ! 
 What ? ! You did that ? ? ! ! ! 
 I'm very sorry I can't . 
 I've been snowed under with since my bosses away on business . 
 Not bad.Thank you for your help . I am always busy with this job , I feel a bit tired . 
 I also feel that work efficiency here is very high . and you have strong working ability and professional skill , it seems that you know all , that's really wonderful ! 
 That's right , I have to work hard . 
 Sorry , I'm engaged for the foxtrot.Will the next Walls be all right ? 
 Excuse me , is this seat taken ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Yes I do . How about you ? 
 You can say that again ! It's much more modern than people imagine . Where are you from ? 
 Uh huh ... 
 Wow ! So many people in the United States get divorced ! 
 I don't think so . In Korea some marriages break up , but most couples stay together . 
 Not really . Very few people get married beforethe age of 20 . 
 No , a lot of women stay home and take care of their families . But some work . 
 The beauty under the tree ? 
 She is a young man ! 
 Oh , over there in Pacific Pavilion . 
 Yeah , that's it . 
 How was your education going on in Australia ? 
 Where are you going to work then , in Australia or back in China ? 
 Why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? Many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad . 
 Yeah , China's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country . 
 Oh , yes . I love playing badminton , table tennis and computer games . And playing the games has become my favorite . 
 I'm no better than them . They say it's mindless to sit in front of a machine all the time , but I think it's stimulating . 
 Once in a while . 
 I hope I can practice self-control again . 
 It ’ s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . I play the part of the detective . He has to catch the killer , but there ’ s very little evidence . It ’ s a psychological th 
 I have had disagreement with every director . I ’ Ve worked with . We ’ Ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . It was the same when I made this movie . I don ’ t no 
 Not at all . The feedback from audience has been great . I care about what they think more than what the critics think . 
 I wanted to , but my insurance company wouldn ’ t let me . All of my stunts were done by a stuntman . As you know , I used to do my own stunts , but I ’ ll leave that to the experts in future . 
 My pleasure . Have you seen the movie yet ? 
 Who's that old lady trimming the trees ? 
 She's looks very healthy.How old is she ? 
 Mom . My legs are killing me . 
 Oh , man . I had the best supper last night . My wife made a stir-fry and it was amazing ! 
 Well , you can keep the vegetables , I ’ ll take the meat . The stir fry my wife made was really hearty , with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion ... 
 What did you say ? 
 Well , I feel a little tired . 
 Then can you wait a few minutes ? I want to finish writing this letter . 
 I won't be long . No more than ten minutes . Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you in the park ? 
 Thank god you showed up when you did ! He ’ s insane ! Do you think we should call the police ? 
 I know ! Well ... he said I ’ m not pregnant . I ’ m sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing . I want you to know that I didn ’ t do it on purpose ... 
 Just hold me ... I ’ ll always be here for you , no matter what . And together , we can tackle whatever life throws at us . I believe in us , steven . 
 Zina , can I talk to you about something personal ? 
 My boyfriend says I work too much . That I spend more time with you than with him . 
 He said not to bother coming back . And I said , fine , I won't . 
 Mary , how was your date with john ? 
 oh , really . That is great news . What does he look like ? 
 sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ? 
 oh , it's love at first sight . When will you see each other again ? 
 maybe he is busy with his work . Just wait and try not to think about it too much ! 
 come on , Mary , you're a total catch . I bet he will call you . Don't worry . 
 that's what friends are for . 
 It was a nightmare . 
 Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year . 
 Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout . 
 I am still waiting for their call . 
 So the company decided to cancel your trip to Hong Kong ? 
 Maybe it's a good things . If you don't have to go to Hong Kong , you can take a break and take things easy for a while . 
 That's a good idea . Let's see if we can get more people in this plan . There isn't much business these days anyway , so I think many people will be interested . 
 I really like the straight legs . 
 I don't like the way they sag down . I feel like I have plumber butt in them . 
 What if someone got it in their head to give them a tug ? What then ? 
 If you ask me , it's a walking invitation ! 
 Oh ! ! My car isn't working . I'm waiting for a tow-truck . 
 Yes , my wife is coming to get me . 
 No , we live in the suburbs . What about you ? 
 Do you have a car ? 
 You're lucky ! 
 Yes . to our first anniversary and many more to come . Cheers ! 
 Well , it's a special day . They say if you survive the first year , the rest is smooth sailing . 
 I requested it . What do you say ? Do you have your dancing shoes on ? 
 What do you plan to do for your birthday ? 
 How about a party at home ? That way we can get together and celebrate it . 
 How about seconds , Victor ? 
 Why don't you have dinner with me tonight ? 
 Let's say about 6:00 ? 
 Cigarette ? 
 Sorry , here . 
 I ’ ll stand in with you if you like . I ’ Ve got nothing else to do . 
 Hi Rose , what are you busy with right now ? 
 Well , Rose . 
 Are your free this weekend ? 
 Great , Is it convenient if i visit you this weekend ? 
 I'd like to call on you this weekend . I just want to a drop in for a chat . 
 Is 5 PM . Saturday a good time for you ? 
 Sure , that would be great . I'll bring the wine . 
 I'll be there on time . 
 You have 16 balls on the table , 7 solid colored , 7 striped colored , a black 8 ball , and the white ball . 
 You hit the white ball with your cue . The white ball hits the colored balls . And you want to get the colored balls into the pockets . 
 At the beginning , it does not matter , but once someone gets one ball in , it is set . 
 The black ball has to be the final ball in the pockets . 
 How about going to hear a country-and-western singer tonight ? 
 I'll pick you up around 8: 00 . 
 The mosquitos are biting me ! 
 Do you have any bug spray ? 
 Then we ’ ll have to put up with it . 
 That ’ s without a doubt , the best idea you ’ Ve had ! Let ’ s do it ! 
 Stop running around in front of the TV , will you ? Why don't you just sit and watch ? 
 Then stay away . No one is keeping you from doing that . 
 All right , I will explain it to you later on . Now scram . 
 That's exactly what I want , thank you . 
 Ha ! It's not like you've ever been one to beat around the bush . 
 No , seriously . . . I really want this . 
 I know . But things have changed . I guess I've settled down . 
 My daughter plans to quit her present job and wants to find another . She says she wants to get a better job with higher pay . 
 But what about settling down to start a family ? Doesn't anyone want to get married any more ? 
 What time is the right moment ? 
 Please excuse me , but I really have to be going . 
 It was nice to see you , too.And please give my regards to Mrs.Robbins . 
 I'm afraid so . 
 Winning is a piece of cake to me . 
 What would you reckon the taxing increases ? 
 But what do most people think about it ? 
 are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night ? 
 yes , I was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place . 
 that's what I thought you would do . Listen , I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . It's just down the street from all the bars . You probably don't want to be walking around after dark . 
 I wish it wasn't , but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here . 
 do me a favor , and take a taxi . It'd make me feel a lot better . 
 when I first moved in , I walked everywhere . But within a week , I had my purse stolen — just a block away from the police station ! Now , I always take public transportation . 
 nothing else has happened to me , but I have seen quite a few fights on the streets after the bars close . 
 Jack wonders whether Linda likes him or not . 
 He is too scared to ask her . 
 I don't understand why some parents keep beefing and complaining about their daughters not being able to follow suit . 
 If I were Li Na , I would ask her if she had done that . 
 Where is John ? I can't find him anywhere . 
 What ? Beg your pardon . 
 I just cann't believe my ears ! 
 I need to use the Internet . 
 Yes , I do . 
 That ’ s fine . 
 Then what ? 
 How do I log on to the computer ? 
 Thanks . I ’ ll be sitting over there . 
 Thank you.But does it really look all right ? 
 Then does it go well with my sweater ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 If you ask me , I don ’ t think it ’ s guilty . 
 I mean it ’ s not his fault . 
 Yes . Don ’ t you think he should be pitied rather than accused ? 
 Thanks ! These are beautiful . You shouldn't have ! 
 I forgot what I put up with . In that case , I do deserve these flowers . 
 What is it ? Maybe I can help . 
 Do you come from a country where they shake hands ? 
 It ’ s very simple . Men shake hands , women and children don ’ t . 
 Well , a good rule to follow is , for men you hold out your hand , for women and children , you wait and see what they do . 
 Sure . Once you get the hang of it , it ’ s a piece of cake ! It ’ s nothing to worry about . 
 Don't worry about it . I keep forgetting everyone's birthdays as well . 
 Yes , Jane invited me for dinner to this new restaurant which opened near us . 
 The food was excellent , but Jane ordered a birthday cake , which they forgot about . So as you can see , you were not the only one . 
 Yes , Jane was quite upset about it . The manager came to apologize and we did get free dessert , but still ... 
 In the end it was a nice evening and I got an iPad as my birthday present which I wanted for a while . 
 I can try , but knowing Margaret she will see through that immediately . 
 Let's go in to wait for them . 
 When do you usually go to the movies ? 
 The movie theater is always so crowded on the weekends . I like to go to the movies during the week . 
 Are you telling us a lie again ? 
 All right . But what was the trouble ? 
 I can't believe Mr . Fro didn't buy it . Who does that guy think he is anyway ? Bill Gates ? 
 Time to order . Balista , today I want a skinny triple latte . 
 I'm not . I just don't feel like drinking whole milk today . Why ? Do you think I'm fat ? 
 Come on , Tara . Let ’ s go up to the window and buy two tickets . The movie is starting in a few minutes . 
 Two tickets , please . How much are they ? 
 I ’ m looking forward to this film . I read a good review of it in this morning ’ s newspaper . 
 Are these seats okay ? 
 Do you often buy magazines ? 
 Why don ’ t you find the information on the internet instead ? 
 Do you have an online edition of that magazine ? 
 Do you have a subscription ? 
 I only buy them if they look particularly interesting . I don ’ t buy any regularly . 
 It sure is . I'm glad it didn't rain . My name's Mike Gates , by the way . 
 I'm sorry . What's your name again ? 
 So Barb ... what do you do ? 
 Really ? Where ? 
 I'm an engineer at IBM . 
 Yeah . I like it . Hey , it looks like the food is ready . 
 Wow ! I can't believe I'm standing here ! 
 I'm standing in front of an exquisite work of art ! 
 I've seen it so many times in books , but I never imagined I'd get to see it in person . 
 Maybe so , but do you have any idea how much this one is worth ? 
 About 80 million dollars . 
 hey , Maris , are you a part-timer ? 
 oh , it ’ s pretty popular among my classmates these days . So are you ? 
 cool ! It must be amazing to work at a bar ! 
 that ’ s true . I ’ m wondering did you learn anything from the job ? 
 you mean you got working experience , right ? 
 it must be very demanding . 
 really ? It sounds interesting . 
 great . I ’ m looking forward to it . 
 Yes , it looks interesting . 
 It must be old . 
 Let's enter it ! 
 It must be locked . 
 She can't answer you . 
 It must be a haunted house . Are you frightened ? 
 Have you got any hobbies ? 
 Which is easier to learn ? 
 Jim , how was your weekend ? 
 That sounds like a lot of fun . Did you go swimming , too ? 
 I couldn ’ t agree more . That ’ s an ideal place for a vacation . 
 I can ’ t wait to go there myself . 
 I don't think the exam will be very hard . 
 Maybe you're right . I have been too lazy lately . 
 I did , but he gives me a runaround . 
 But he was trying to beat about the bush . And my talk with him was fruitless . 
 It's exactly twelve minutes past seven . 
 It'll begin at nine o'clock sharp . 
 I would if I were you . 
 You said it . I always count on him when I need his help . 
 We're having a sixties party next week . Do you want to come ? 
 You come dressed in anything from the sixties . 
 Check out your mom's closet . I'll bet she still has something . 
 That will be great ! Do you have LPs or Cds ? 
 I want to improve my handwriting , and I've practiced it for several weeks , but nothing happened . You see , my handwriting is still bad . 
 I know it , but I don't know when I can make it better . 
 Yeah , you are right . I must stop complaining and stick to it every day . 
 I ’ m so excited , mother . Oh , a new baby ! 
 And my first nephew . He looks a lot like you , mum . He does . 
 Yes , he does have Richard ’ s eyes . The baby even looks like you than Richard does . 
 It ’ s true . Michelle is a lot like Henry in so many ways . And she is shy with new people just like he is . 
 You ’ re right . 
 How do you like this waltz ? 
 May I ask you for a dance ? 
 You are doing the waltz wonderfully well . 
 Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ? 
 I suppose she's right . Does she speak English very slowly ? 
 It must be interesting to study English . 
 Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ? 
 Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do ! 
 I think someone is stalking me . 
 I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . 
 I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too . 
 Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me . 
 He followed me all the way home ! 
 Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ? 
 Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me ! 
 I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is . 
 Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile . 
 I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ’ s better to get to know it . What about you ? 
 Oh , my God ! John , I didn ’ t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory . 
 But I ’ m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ? 
 I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ’ t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ? 
 Really ? 
 Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ? 
 How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ? 
 So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ? 
 Why did they want to found a college ? 
 Oh , I see . 
 When did it begin to be called Harvard University ? 
 It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion . 
 Wow , I didn ’ t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history . 
 I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard . 
 That ’ s right . I have a lot to learn from you . 
 I am not convinced by your explanation . Could you explain it ? 
 I can't accept your excuse . It's five o'clock . 
 Ok , sounds good . But I think it's your trick . 
 I love going out into the countryside for walks or bike ride . I love being out in the fresh summer air . How about you ? 
 What do you do in winter ? 
 I think most people do . I like wearing nice , colorful clothes in summer-you know , a nice dress or skirt . It ’ s too cold for those kinds of clothes in winter . 
 Do you think we ’ ll have a nice summer this year ? 
 I will never forget Linda . After all , she was my first lover . 
 I remember that someone says that it is difficult to forget the people who don ’ t want to forget . 
 Could you tell me what university you want to go to , John ? 
 What university would you enter ? 
 Oh , I forget.Sorry . 
 Did you ? And what course did you take there ? 
 I've not known.Perhaps , I've got a bad memory . 
 Terrific ! B . A . , again and again-B . A . 
 Fun for you ! Do you get to do anything you want ? 
 Does everyone usually show up for your family reunions ? 
 How Ay days will the reunion be ? 
 This is going to be a major production for you ! 
 Nice to meet you , Lvan.My name is Alike . I'm from Japan . 
 A second language is always difficult . 
 A crazy language ? Why do you say that ? 
 No wonder you say English is a crazy language . 
 I liked it . I thought it was great . 
 Yes . I thought it was excellent . Didn't you ? 
 It's a nice cinema , isn't it ? 
 What ’ s up ? You don ’ t look too good . 
 I liked physics . It ’ s all math , really , arcs , curves , velocity , cool stuff . 
 A physics class about the creation of the universe ? That ’ s some pretty unscientific language there . Sounds more religious to me . 
 Turtles ? Whatever ... Look , all that ’ s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles . At least , that ’ s what the math says . 
 There is evidence ! You know Edwin Hubble ? He ’ s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . What would it be expanding from ? Well , the Big Bang ... DUH ! 
 Dude , don ’ t equivocate . A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing . You slept through class , didn ’ t you ? 
 There is nothing good at the moment.Let ' s do something different.Would you like to go to a concert ? 
 Fine ! Do you want anything to eat now ? 
 Well , let's go and have something to drink instead . I know a good place . It's a little expensive , but it's fun . 
 I partly agree with you . Buying stocks is not difficult , but making money consistently from buying stock is very difficult . Even professionals don ’ t find it easy , so be careful . Anyway , people like us need help with investing . Why not do some online research ? There are data , reports and discussion forums to educate people on how to invest . In addition , you need to visit an established website that offers stock charts . 
 I just watched the investment TV program last weekend . It has become a very hot topic these days . Actually I am not even a beginner . 
 That's out of the question . 
 Aha . I've read of my roommate . I made a move today . 
 You knew Brain Locker ? 
 Well , he's thin and tall . He has brown hair , a holt nose , green eyes and wearing glasses . 
 Where are you from ? 
 Where in China is Guangzhou ? 
 Well , I must be off now . I have an appointment at six . 
 Ok , Goodbye . 
 Hey ! How was your first day of class ? I ’ m in level two and I ’ m loving my class this semester ! It ’ s great being in a class of international students ! 
 That ’ s both fortunate and unfortunate . It ’ s the United Nations in my class ! We have people from all over the world ! There are three Germans , a Pole , a Scottish , two French , an American , a Brazilian , 
 Well , I think you ’ re pretty lucky actually . You ’ ll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture . 
 Don ’ t ! Stay the course ! Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful . I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice . 
 Well , there is that , yes . 
 Yeah , I can really go for some Chinese food right now . 
 I know one . Let's go . 
 Morning , Mike . 
 I ’ Ve already got your certificate for sick-leave . How do you feel today ? 
 Have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ? 
 I will explain it in detail in the next class . Could you preview it ? 
 Do you like flowers ? 
 What's your favorite flower ? 
 Spring is a lively season . 
 I admire plum blossoms very much . It seems that only it can blossom in the cold winter . 
 It is the symbol of laughing at hoar frost and fighting with snow . I admire the bravery of plum blossoms . 
 The bright people will remember it forever . 
 What is the weather like today ? 
 And the streets are covered with ice . Do you know what the temperature is today ? 
 It seems 10 degree below zero at least . I don't mind the cold weather , but do hate when it get slippery . 
 That's fine . let's go skating together tomorrow . 
 I like music that has a fast beat and is lively , like dance music . You know , I go to a disco almost every week . Sometimes it's too loud though . You prefer classical music , don ’ t you ? 
 I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music . It ’ s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music . 
 Really ? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often . I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress . 
 I ’ Ve got a few classical music CD ’ s . I should follow your lead and increase my brian power . 
 That ’ s a good idea . You should do the same with some music . You might find something you like . Classical music might make you clever , but dance might make you livelier and happier . 
 There is a new coffee shop opening up down the street . 
 That's right . You don't drink coffee , do you ? 
 What kind of things would you like to see on the menu ? 
 That shouldn't be too difficult . Since this is a small neighborhood , maybe they will take this suggestion . 
 Darling , I have news for you . Bobby and his wife , Evelyn , are going to have a baby soon . 
 Actually they ’ re expecting the baby to come on my birthday . 
 In fact , they ’ re both very excited about the coming baby . Evelyn imagines what their baby would be look like , since one parent is American and the other one is Chinese . 
 It ’ s still a mystery . Because Evelyn is only three-month pregnant . But she begins to take her maternity leave now . 
 Well , I am a regular member of this club . 
 Yes , membership fees vary depending on the club but usually they run into tens of thousands of dollars . 
 Very few , unfortunately . 
 Extremely good . I shot a 78 , including 5 birdies ! 
 Ten . How did your game go ? 
 Maybe you can correct it by going to a driving range before you play again . 
 I agree . 
 I can't believe they would play so good . 
 Thanks . I'd love to . What time is the show ? 
 That sounds great . So , do you want to have dinner at 6:00 ? 
 Oh , that's OK . Let's just meet at the theater before the show , around 7:30 . 
 Is the Chinese team taking the lead ? 
 Japanese teams always play a dark horse . 
 Do you mind if I ask your friend out ? 
 Okay , that's good . 
 Harry is so down that he won't talk to anyone . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Hi , Is that David ? 
 Hey , what's new ? 
 Sorry to hear that . What happened ? 
 Hey , that ’ s not the girl with pink hair , is it ? The girl I saw with Jack yesterday . 
 Hey , she is not worth it . Forget her . 
 Hey , she is not worth it . Anyway , there are plenty more fish in the sea . Listen , let's go for a drink in the town . How about that ? 
 But you have to promise me that you are not gonna wear that face . 
 The one where you look like your dog just died . You have to get over her and the sooner the better . 
 This is a nice set of wheels . How much did the dealer charge you for this ? 
 Okay then , let ’ s go fast ! Whoa ! This thing can really accelerate fast . 
 Hey , just watch out for cops or you ’ re gonna end up in the slammer . You know you tend to go fast ? 
 Now watch ... some guys probably run a light and hit your car . 
 When's your birthday ? 
 Bob is getting on in years . 
 He looks tired all the time . 
 Which church do you attend ? 
 What ’ s the difference between this and other Churches ? 
 Then does that mean the other churches are corrupt ? 
 Do you believe that Mormons have all of it ? 
 Why do you really go to church ? 
 Sorry I was late for the meeting today . I got stuck in traffic . 
 Hello ! What are you reading about in the newspaper ? 
 People are starting to get frightened by it . Everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder . 
 There must have been some good news in the newspaper . I can ’ t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited . 
 Yes . Her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states . 
 I ’ m so happy for the family ! They must be very relieved and excited about that . 
 Don ’ t be moody ! I hope you ’ re not tired , because we ’ Ve been invited to a party this evening . I know how excited you get about parties . 
 Sounds good . When and where shall we meet ? 
 Fine , see you then . 
 There are hundreds and hundreds.English is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions . 
 I'll look up the rate.To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof.It means to search for and find some information . 
 That is just a natural , grammatical English expression.It has a direct translation in other languages . 
 Why did the teacher criticise Myra in front of the whole class ? 
 I don't think that Myra should have spoken so rudely to the teacher . I know she was angry , but that's still no excuse for rudeness . 
 Do you need a spot here or off campus ? 
 There's a parking structure for students . 
 Go to the western side of the campus , and you'll find it there . 
 When I went up there , it wasn't full at all . 
 Sometime this morning . 
 I am really not sure . 
 Do you mean the ' I love you ' virus that attacks computers through e-mail ? 
 This is terrible . Why do hackers play such a dirty trick ? 
 So they create viruses to tell people they are smart ? That's really sick . 
 Why do you say that ? 
 Think a little . I think he means well at the bottom of his heart . 
 I ’ m going to the hospital . 
 Professor Wang was hurt in a traffic accident . 
 His life is hanging by a thread , and he is under an emergency treatment . 
 Sorry , I can't . I am busy . 
 I always do volunteer work on the first Saturday of every month . 
 I help out at the children's hospital . I help plan activities . 
 Yes , it ’ s exciting . This month we are doing crossword puzzles . 
 Oh , yes . Laura ’ s the oldest . She ’ s a computer programmer . 
 She ’ s a librarian at the public library . 
 Christy is working as a waitress at a restaurant in Paris . She ’ s married to a French photographer . 
 Larry drives a truck . He drives all over the country . We hardly ever seen him . 
 Colorado . 
 Oh , no . Rocky is a pilot . 
 Yes . Mostly to England and France . 
 Merry Christmas , Lee ! 
 Thank you for coming . I'm glad you liked it . 
 She's at home . 
 I know that they are auspicious fish . It's quite popular nowadays . 
 Not at all . I think the tattoos are so cool and chic . 
 Honey , it's not so serious . It's just an animal . 
 OK , I understand , but what else could we do ? 
 It's Ellie and her friends . 
 She's my little niece.It ' s her birthday.They ' re singing " Happy Birthday " . 
 She's ten . 
 Oh , yes.Ellie was playing games all day yesterday.By the way , Alice , when's your birthday ? 
 Today ? 
 Well , imagine that ! How old are you ? 
 Very much.What time ? 
 I'll be at your house at about 5:30 . Happy birthday . 
 Yes , I hope we meet again . 
 Okay . 
 And what did the program say ? 
 I think that many physicians 8 now agree with that idea . 
 And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise . My father is over 60 years old , and he lifts weights every day . 
 Yeah , I went over the figures this morning . We're finally started making money again ! 
 not only our annual sales brake a record , but our month by month earnings exceeded our forecast as well . After a two-year slump , we finally back in the black . 
 I think our success is partly because of Wallace's contribution , and partly because of our new marketing strategy . Because of the new advertising campaign , we have become the top sellers in the field . 
 Let's hope it is ! 
 It's worth it just to go and eat what the mafia eat ! The five-dollar tiramisu is a culinary orgasm . 
 Fortunately , yes . You're blushing ! 
 You're embarrassed , aren't you ? You gotta loosen up in Little Italy . The lady at the cafe will kiss you when you meet her ... 
 Yes , I received the scholarship 3 times on end . 
 Yes , I joined the CPC when I was a freshman 
 Let ’ s go for a joy ride . 
 Well , of course I can ’ t miss it . Which team are you for ? 
 Me too . Do you think they are going to get the championship this time ? 
 The weekend's finally here ! 
 Yep . It's the kickoff of the barbecue season . We're invited to a grill party in the park tomorrow . 
 We need to buy some buns for the hot dogs and hamburgers , and I'm making potato salad . 
 Hi , Martin . I ’ Ve been looking for you all morning . 
 I want to say goodbye . I ’ m leaving for America tomorrow . 
 Yes . 
 Thank you . 
 Me too . I ’ ll write to you once I get settled . But I have so much to do . You might have to wait a while . But I really will write to you . I love to write letters . I think it ’ s more meaning than the emails even than the phone call . 
 Thank you . 
 Bye . 
 And I'm the one who put him there with my football moves . 
 Yeah , what was all that stuff about running tests about anyway ? 
 Great , then let's go visit him . I want to give him some flowers , too , to say sorry . 
 Yes , I did . Did you ? 
 Oh yes , I loved it . Wasn't the scene with the judge great ? 
 Look out ! Your tea water is running over . 
 Sure . 
 Did you see May today ? 
 I don't have the foggiest idea . 
 Yeah , especially since she got a promotion recently . 
 I don't think the teacher had a right to say that . The teacher was wrong to have accused her in front of the whole class . 
 I agree she had the right to say something , but I feel she should have done it privately . 
 Come on in . I am so glad you are here . We have been expecting you . 
 No , you are just on time . We haven ’ t really started yet . 
 Thank you , they ’ re beautiful . You can hang your coat over there . Try this new couch , it is so comfortable . You will love it . Want something to drink , tea , coffee , juice or Cola ? 
 Make yourself at home . 
 Well , I don ’ t mean to boast but all the designs are done by myself and some colleagues are already trying to copy some of them for their new apartments . Look , they are making photos now of my designed kitchen . 
 John , I am just not in the mood for this . 
 I lost the table tennis game yesterday . 
 I just don ’ t want to play table tennis any more . 
 My opponent bowled me with the very first ball . I was wondering if it's appropriate for me to play table tennis . 
 Perhaps you are right . But I still need some time to recover from the failure . 
 The band is pretty good . How do you like the music ? 
 Well , then , may I invite you for the next dance ? 
 Don't worry . I'm not much of a dancer myself . 
 You dance beautifully too . 
 In college . But I don't dance very often . What's your favourite dance ? 
 How about tango ? 
 Tango is my favorite . Anything but hip-hop or the foxtrot . ( the music has stopped ) 
 My pleasure . Let's go and have a drink . 
 I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution . 
 We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced . 
 I think you're right . There needs to be an international response to this problem ? 
 What a shame ! 
 That's too bad . 
 I'm sorry to hear that . 
 What a pity ! 
 Ho , no ! 
 My first grandchild . 
 Do you think so ? Well , I guess . He does look a lot like me . Oh , he ’ s got Richard ’ s eyes though . 
 Well , children usually resemble their parents . 
 You often like comparing children with their parents . 
 When do you go to bed usually ? 
 That's helpful for your health . 
 Have you been ever been to Disneyworld ? 
 The one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland . 
 Well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon . 
 Some time next year . We haven't set the date yet . 
 Thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ? 
 For the most part , yes . Some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though . 
 Even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ? 
 Thanks for the advice . I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight . 
 Can you speak French ? 
 Can you understand your Spanish teacher ? 
 About 40 percent , if he speaks slowly.When he speaks fast , I can only catch a word here and there . But Mr . Wang is an excellent Chinese teacher.With his help , my Chinese is getting better and better e 
 much better than it did yesterday . 
 I not only passed my test , but I aced it ! I'm so happy ! 
 thanks for helping me with it . If you hadn't encouraged me to do my best , I wouldn't have ever been able to pass . 
 did you always do well at school ? 
 really ? 
 I'll get my finals in two months . 
 most students just cram the night forehead . 
 no , I think I should study a little bit at a time , starting a few weeks before the exam . 
 I'll go and talk to my professor or a learning support assistant . 
 Can I borrow your Cds for our school dance ? 
 I promise I will personally guard every single one and they will come back in perfect condition . 
 That sounds fair . That's still cheaper than paying a band to come play for us . 
 Our class doesn't have enough money . We already checked into it . 
 Do you want to go to the beach tonight ? 
 I wanted to go to Malibu beach . 
 The water there looks so dirty . 
 I like the pier too , because it's beautiful at night . 
 It's a lot nicer , and I really like it better . 
 If that's okay with you . 
 There are so many environment problems in the world today . Do you think we can really solve them all or will destroy the world ? 
 We need to solve the problem of air pollution before we destroy the atmosphere . There ’ s lots of clean , modern technology , but companies in developed countries say it ’ s expensive . Developing countries put more emphasis on economic development than on environment protection . 
 In other parts of the world , especially in Africa , there is a problem with desertification . Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert . In means that people cannot grow enough food . 
 Have you ever thought about joining an organization committed to protecting the environment ? You could get involved with projects to improve the environment . 
 Kathy ! How are you ? It's been ages ! What are you doing these days ? 
 You're kidding ! You've always hated cooking ! 
 When did you change your mind ? 
 I still can't believe it ! So , did you go to cooking school or something ? 
 Really ? How long did you stay there ? 
 And what did you do after that ? 
 Susan , I am inviting you and Frank to our house warming party this weekend . 
 Yes , Deborah and I are going to buy a new home in Woodlawn . 
 Well , we have always dreamed of owning our own home , but real estate 1 in this area is extremely expensive . 
 That ’ s a good idea if you can find employment nearby . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 What ’ s the problem ? 
 Have you checked the computer ? 
 What did it say ? 
 I can always borrow the book from another library . 
 I ’ ll make the call and contact you when it gets in . 
 ABC Rent-a-Car . May I help you ? 
 We have Volkswagen , Pinto , Plymouth and Datsun . 
 Twenty dollars per day for Volkswagen , Pinto and Datsun , and twenty-seven dollars for Plymouth . 
 There is no charge for mileage . And fill up the gas when you return the car to us as it is not included . 
 All right , sir . May I have your driver's license ? 
 Would you be willing to accompany me to the party tonight ? 
 Which film shall we see ? 
 Yes , I'd love to.Here is a good one , Mozart and Beethoven.It ' s on the Festival Hall . 
 No , I'm not hungry . 
 Spring Festival is the most important festival in China , isn't it ? 
 How long is the holiday ? 
 Do you eat any special food for the festival ? 
 That's interesting . I'm told the Chinese firework is very beautiful , isn't it ? 
 Oh , great ! I hope I can spend this Spring Festival with you here in Beijing . 
 I'm really sick of waiting for a bus . 
 But a taxi costs too much . 
 I feel absolutely horrible . My temperature is 41 degrees Celsius , and I've got a headache and a runny nose . 
 I've also got a terrible stomach-ache . Is my face still swollen ? 
 yes , for the most part . It doesn't feel as bad as my other ailments , anyway . 
 no , the burn ointment seemed to take effect right away . I think it's already healed . 
 I scalded on the hot coffee a few days ago . 
 no , but I'm sure I'll get better soon . 
 I took the red ones just before lunch and the white ones just after lunch . 
 just some water , please . Do you have any ointment for my nose ? It feels so itchy after blowing my nose so much . 
 that sounds good . 
 I haven't got enough evidence for prosecuting him . 
 I'm just thinking about that , but the trouble is , I don't know who is well in the know . 
 Thanks for reminding me . She's the right person to help me . 
 We heard you weren't feeling well , so we came to check on you . 
 Who , Femi ? Yeah , Yi-jun saw her inside . 
 I remember someone spiked my punch . You sat with me in the girl's bathroom ... 
 Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired . 
 With everything , with everybody , with all this ! 
 It wasn't always like this , you know . 
 Well , I mean.We always do the same thing.There ' s no variety in our lives . 
 Certainly , perhaps . 
 Yes , it sure is . I had to run here from work ! I need to rush as I'm on my lunch break . 
 Oh , that's so nice of you ! Thank you very much . 
 Sure . Well , the avocado sandwich is delicious , and it's the healthiest thing on the menu . Personally , I think the beef salad is the tastiest choice . I usually get that . Also , the milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town ! 
 Oh , don't mention it . 
 It's December eighteenth . 
 Yes , I know that . 
 Sure , a promise is a promise . 
 Nothing . 
 I ’ m rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off . 
 This man is your fiance , Dolly ? 
 He's handsome . 
 He's outgoing and honest , but sometimes he's a bit conservative . 
 Don't bother . those are a dime a dozen where we are going . 
 No ... mom said that we'll have the wedding at home on the 2nd . So let's hope your mom is right about that being a lucky day ... 
 They're going to give us back the seats ? 
 Hawaii ? My dream honeymoon destination ? 
 Oh , Jack ! That's wonderful ! 
 What do you mean ? 
 That is called a nuclear family . 
 What kind of family are you like ? 
 It's a traditional family . It may be too large to live well . 
 What was that all about ? 
 Is she going to be okay ? 
 Is sailing fun ? 
 John dates her seven times a week . 
 I think so . Maybe he's fallen for her . 
 Right . 
 I don't think Joe has done such a thing . Don't believe things in haste . 
 Good morning , Loans . 
 I would like to compliment you on your diligence . 
 Yes . And we're proud of you , Loans . 
 Which countries have you been to ? 
 I thought you had been to Australia too . 
 I think I ‘ d say norway . It has many picturesque fjords , waterfalls , and mountains . 
 Well , the north of Norway is almost always cold , but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . It ’ s a wet country , so there ’ s snow almost everywhere in winter . 
 Alison , would you like to have some more ? 
 Actually you haven't have much . 
 That sounds ridiculous . Why ? 
 Welcome to my birthday party , I am so happy you can come . 
 Thank you , shall I open it now ? 
 Wow , a remote car model and my favorite brand . I really like it . That is so nice of you . 
 Typical you , always wanting to keep the best things for yourself . The more I appreciate the gift now . 
 No . Does the newspaper say what has caused that ? 
 I think the government should make a serves of moves to cool the market . 
 I think that show biz stars have a really easy life . They have lots of money , so they can buy almost anything they want . They ’ re famous , so everyone loves them . 
 I bet they love it really . Sure , they complain about it , but that just gets them more publicity , doesn ’ t it ? 
 No way ! They want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! They have such an easy life . They don ’ t even pay for drinks when they go to a cocktail party . 
 I don ’ t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . They ’ re overpaid , over-ambitious , and over-adored . 
 Come on ! They only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves 。 
 Yeah , it ’ s been ages ! So how have you been ? 
 Just as usual , you know . 
 Cut what out I ’ m not doing anything . 
 Fine ! By the way would you mind not slurping your coffee every time you have a cup ! 
 You ’ Ve got to be kidding me ! You ’ re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze ? 
 Fine . Let's call a truce . I'll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down . 
 The weather in Beijing is just beautiful ! 
 Yes , I can see . The summer heat is over , and the winter cold is still far away . 
 Autumn is also very nice in Washington . 
 No , it isn't . But sometimes it snows a lot in winter . 
 Oh yes ! Sometimes it rains very heavily.How about here in Beijing ? 
 I feel it's rather dry here . 
 Are you from the south ? 
 I see.so this is your hometown ? 
 Yeah . It is incredible ! Is it the work of Qi Bakshi ? 
 Well , Qi is famous all over the world , isn ’ t he ? Besides I am quite interested in Chinese painting . 
 I prefer free sketch , especially the landscape paintings . I can always feel peace and harmony from those landscape paintings . 
 I love this art exhibition ! 
 OK . 
 It has stopped snowing , but it's even colder . 
 And the streets are covered with snow . 
 I missed today's weather forecast over the TV . 
 The ice will soon be thick enough for skating . I am so fond of winter sports . 
 Nick , it's very nice of you to see me off . 
 Very well . If I leave I'll miss you . 
 I'm sure and I remembered your phone number . I'll call you . 
 It's time I left . 
 What are your working hours ? 
 Much better than mine . 
 Mine aren't fixed . Sometimes I do the day shift , sometimes the night shift . 
 For What ? 
 Well , that sounds like it would be OK . Just be careful . 
 I went to Yale University . 
 I have a B . A . in Economics . 
 I'm twenty-seven . 
 Yes , I have worked in a bank for the last years . 
 I got $ 500 a week . 
 I'm all right , thanks . Just a little tired . 
 Yeah , I got home around two . 
 Fantastic ! I enjoy clubbing , especially those clubs with live bands . The only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad , full of smoke , and the music is too loud , so conversations are not really possible . Once I nearly got burnt by a cigarette . 
 A wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . If I had drunk enough and I would have had the bold to punch him in the face . 
 What do you do for a living ? 
 Really ? Do you like it ? 
 I ’ m a bus driver . 
 No , I don ’ t really like it . It ’ s boring . 
 that would be a good shot . Can you take my picture here , dear ? Please try to get the garden in the frame as well . 
 thanks . Could you take one more from this angle ? 
 now let's have one together . 
 let me see ... set the timer first and push the button , oh , come here . 
 cheese ... 
 yes , but it's blurred and a little dark . 
 Ok , let's go . 
 Yes , I did . 
 Oh , I didn't watch the football match . I wanted to but my wife preferred to see the old film . 
 How did it finish ? 
 It was quite good . But . I missed the beginning of it because I had to eat first . 
 No , she didn't . After half an hour she stopped watching and started to read a book . 
 It's the new neighbor . I hate her guts . 
 She made another white crack about my clothes . 
 Of course , I am sure . 
 Just how am I supposed to do that ? 
 I've tried , but she keeps pushing my buttons . 
 I am not . she is no picnic . 
 Thanks , Serena . 
 Do you already know how to play an instrument ? 
 Aside from yourself , who are the other members of the band ? 
 Yes , I ’ m a singer . 
 Great ! Wait here ? You don ’ t have enough room for the amplifiers , microphones or even your drums ! By the way where do you keep them or practice ? 
 Oh , thanks a lot . 
 1 thirty P . m . But I've got to check in at 12 thirty P . m . 
 Pan American Airlines . Flight 282 . 
 Ok . See you tomorrow . 
 Oh , I see . You ’ Ve already decided , have you ? Now , you listen to me , you ’ re only 19 . 
 Oh . So you think you can just do whatever you want , do you ? 
 Hello , Friendship Restaurant . May I help you ? 
 Yes , Sir . For how many people , please ? 
 What time ? 
 So sorry , we're fully booked in that room . Would you like to make reservation some other time ? 
 Hey , Zina . You're here early today . 
 I just wanted to say thanks for putting us on the map so fast . I appreciate it . 
 Fair enough.Keep up the good work . 
 Let's stop the car and enjoy it for a minute . 
 Wow . We don't get to see this in the city ! 
 Look behind us at the mountains ! They're reflecting pink ! 
 Where is our camera ? Let's see if we can catch this on film ! 
 Sure.Where would you suggest ? 
 Sounds good . 
 Sorry , I thought you knew . 
 Didn't I ? 
 Well , I'm telling you now . 
 I didn't think you'd be interested . 
 Sorry , I didn't think it mattered . 
 Hi , Bill . 
 Where is that cool guy , Dick ? I haven ’ t seen him for two weeks . 
 Bummer , I ’ m sorry to hear that , is he better now ? 
 Where's Tom this evening ? 
 Really ! What's the matter with him ? 
 Tell him I was asking about him . 
 Maybe you should talk to the teacher . 
 You never know unless you try . 
 well , I finished my last final today . 
 do you want to attend the convocation ? 
 do you want to have them made or do you want to rent them ? 
 no . those you have to provide for yourself . 
 well , most of them only need a cap and gown for that particular convocation service , but some of the education majors have had them made , because they will be faculty members , and they'll need them f 
 Mary , don't move . Stand right there . It's a good shot . The background is very pretty . 
 it doesn't matter . Say'cheese ' . 
 Certainly . Ok , got you . 
 No , not at all . Go ahead . 
 I go to movies ; I go to lectures ; I listen to the radio ; I do lots of things . Most importantly , I practice every chance I get . 
 Sure . It ’ s like understanding on the telephone — — you can ’ t see the speaker ! It ’ s great for improving listening comprehension . 
 It certainly does . But if you practice speaking every spare minute and learn useful sentences every day you can make big progress . 
 Good morning , Tom.How are you ? 
 Things couldn't be better.Where are you going now ? 
 I'm going to the English class.It ' ll start in five minutes , I've got to run . 
 After a while , crocodile . 
 It is in mine too.The biggest issue is water . The climate is dry and so water conservation is very important . 
 Water is rationed . We can only use a certain amount each month . It means that we cannot use some modern household items , like washing machines . They use too much water . 
 Yes , I agree . The air here is much more polluted than in my country . Of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry . 
 The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don ’ t believe that any single country can do anything about it . 
 Hurry up . Time is running out . 
 Hi Cody , how did practicing go this week ? 
 Great ! Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first . Good , good . This week , work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note . Now let ’ s take a look at this 
 It might work . I ’ ll have to hear it.Show me what you ’ Ve done . 
 It ’ s just nerves . Just play the right hand for now . One two three four five six , ta ti tri-ple-ti . Good , good . Don ’ t forget the accidentals ! The key signature says that note should be a G-sharp b 
 Yes , much better . Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal . What was that ? 
 That's ok , keep going , you ’ re moving ahead by leaps and bounds . Watch your dynamics ! Keep your elbows lifted . Remember to stroke the keys , don ’ t pound . That ’ s better ! Remember that as a pianist or any 
 It's 5:30 by my watch . 
 Yes . There's only a few seconds in a whole month . 
 Are you angry , Lisa ? 
 Please don't tell my mom . 
 I'm glad that you see it that way . 
 Thank you so much , Lisa ! 
 I heard through the grapevine that your getting married . 
 Congratulations , I hope everything works out . 
 I wouldn't say so . 
 Well , I thought he was , but he ends up to be a con man . 
 yes , everything is fine . 
 didn't they announce that our flight was delayed ? 
 we boarded the plane on time , but then we were held up for almost an hour due to a maintenance problem . 
 we finally took off , but about 30 minutes later , the captain came on the loudspeaker to warn us that there would be some bad turbulence for most of the flight . 
 yes , but this was the worst turbulence I'd ever experienced in my life ! Everyone started getting sick . The flight attendants had to stay in their seats . The captain decided to land early . 
 we landed in Southampton and waited an hour for the storms to pass and then took off again . 
 it wasn't too bad . At lease I'm alive . 
 I managed to get a sandwich from a flight attendant . How about you ? 
 I've got some bad news about the bike you lent me . 
 I fell on the way to school , and your bike got scratched . I'm really sorry . 
 No , thank you . 
 It's kind of you to say . I feel a little stupid . 
 When you lent me the bike , it looked brand new , almost anyway . 
 I appreciate that , thank you . 
 Today is December 23,2002 . 
 Merry Christmas to you ! 
 Oh , Penny , I'm Leonard , glad to meet you . 
 It is hard to get used to a new place , isn't it ? 
 We'd like to . Can you tell me when we go ? 
 OK . Do you want us to bring something ? 
 OK , see you later . 
 You know what , last night I almost got hit by a vase falling from the third floor . 
 Luckily that was nothing serious . 
 I do feel like a trip to Florida on such a gloomy day in New York , to enjoy the sunshine while lying on the beaches of Florida . 
 But if the sunshine is too strong , it might damage the eyes and the skin . 
 I see . Overdoing it will do more harm than good . 
 I just finished reading this article ' Getting Old Gracefully ' . It's a very good article . 
 A lot of things . There is a part about how old people should accept being old and stop feeling restless . You really should read it . 
 Why not ? What this article says makes good sense to me . If you read it , I'm sure you'll agree with me . 
 Thanks for coming shopping with me . 
 I've never given a speech in front of a thousand people before . 
 Thanks . Now let's decide which one of these suits looks best for this occasion . 
 The question is , can he have it done before Friday ? 
 I love slim girls , don ’ t you ? 
 And I like a girl with good skin , do you ? 
 Well , yes . But surely you like a girl with a nice figure . 
 But you like a girl to be rich , surely ? 
 What's going on here ? 
 Master Li ? Who's that ? 
 I will ! I could use some good luck ! 
 Yes , I do . The look of a picture is very important . 
 You wouldn't know a good movie even if it bit you on the nose . 
 Enough ! If we don't finish the game , there won't be time for any movies tonight ! 
 It's Thursday , I think . 
 We're busy on weekdays , but we'll have a good rest at the weekend . 
 I decided to go for this kind of life . 
 I know . I always hope for the best and prepare for the worst . 
 What day is it today ? 
 Are you new to this school ? 
 Is this your first year in college ? 
 Where did you transfer from ? 
 Why did you transfer ? 
 Did you like it at PCC ? 
 Well , I wish you luck here . 
 There is something wrong with my girlfriend . 
 The department manager is all over her . He says he loves her . 
 Of course not ! She thinks he's an apple-head . She doesn't like an apple-headed man , you know . 
 Are you ready to go to the bank ? 
 There ’ s problem with my bank statement . There ’ s a mistake on it . I also need to withdraw some money some the ATM . 
 that ’ s right . You ’ re going away next week . 
 I have to pay my credit bill too . If I don ’ t pay it soon , the credit card company will charge me interest . 
 It ’ s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . The air is so fresh and clean . 
 I can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . The problem is that , for me , each advantage has its own disadvantage . 
 Well , I hate the noise in the city , but I love being around lost of people . The problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . The two just don ’ t go together . 
 People can ’ t have it both ways . If you live in the country , it is often less convenient . If you live in a city , it is noisy , but there ’ s more to do . 
 I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . When the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes . 
 Just remember that in that village there ’ s nothing to do . There ’ s not even a pub or restaurant . There ’ s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods . 
 Hey Mike . What are you doing ? 
 I was just concerned about Sam . He hasn't been himself lately . 
 That sucks . He must feel depressed . 
 Why don't we take him out ? We can try to take his mind off of it . In the least show him that we're there for him . 
 Ok . I'll call you back after I'm done . 
 Did you hear Peter just retired ? 
 He is not young as he looks . I think he's almost sixty . 
 Hello , Steven . Congratulations ! 
 How's your married life ? 
 That's very good . It's said that marriage is the Ab of love . But the words may not be right . 
 We have waited for a long time . When will we start ? 
 are you working overtime again ? Over the last two weeks , you have worked overtime every day without a break ! Your company is draining the life out of you ! 
 Well , I hope they're paying you the big bucks for all this work ... 
 What ? ! Isn't there a law against that , I think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages . You should know your rights ! If you are putting in so many hours , they should give you some kind of compensation . 
 That's just wrong ! why don't you just quit ? 
 it sounds like any job will be better than the one you have now ! 
 I felt as if I had been in a different world . 
 I'd like to reserve a table for three at 6:30 this evening . 
 Nonsmoking , please . 
 My surname is Gao . 
 OK . Come back into the classroom , class . 
 Yes , but to the health , this break has long enough . 
 come on , baby . It ’ s time now . 
 Hurry up , little boy . 
 oh , Iris , it ’ s about the job with the PR company . 
 but my mother won ’ t allow me to accept any part-time job . I ’ m afraid she will say no again . 
 she says a part-time job is cursed blessing . It takes so much time and energy that I won ’ t be able to focus on my studys . 
 I turned down quite a few offers before for her sake . But I ’ m a senior now , I don ’ t want to miss the chance this time . 
 I ’ ll try , but what if she insists ? 
 do you think it will work ? 
 ok , I ’ ll do that . Thank you , Iris . 
 Where did you go yesterday ? 
 How often do you play tennis ? 
 I seldom play tennis . I prefer football and basketball . 
 I usually play with my school-mates . 
 Yes . I went to Tinge Sport Centre for football match last Sunday . 
 I've got a date . 
 Why don ’ t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy , being outside working during the day ? 
 Maybe you have two choices . You could attend school during the day , or you could get a position that provides training . 
 And what did the program say ? 
 I think that many physicians now agree with that idea . 
 And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise . My father is over 60 years old , and he lifts weights every day . 
 I was playing a joke on you . 
 Dear , forgive me . I won ’ t do that again . 
 I ’ m going to Hainan . 
 Yes , actually it ’ s my second visit . I was there last October . 
 Well , the life style is much more relaxed than here in the city . And the seafood is tastier ! 
 Hurry up , Daniel , it's Barbie time . 
 Come on , it's cool outside . 
 Hey , Daniel , what's your favorite weather ? Snowy or sunny ? 
 What ? Are you crazy ? 
 Ew , Danny , gross ! 
 I love snowy , because it is very very romantic . 
 My girlfriend dumped me . 
 Did Roll win the race ? 
 But anyway , he won at last . 
 What's this then ? 
 But this should have been handed in last Thursday . 
 Well , what's your excuse then ? 
 Oh , Yes ? 
 Hey , This is your order . 
 Yes . I started this part-time job just three days ago . And my internship will last 1 week . I'm still a student now . 
 Of course not . You know , there are many foreign customers like you here . And I think it's good for me to improve my oral English . 
 No , I'm not an English student . But I do like English . I'm going to be a volunteer in the 2008 Olympics where I want to be helpful with the language . So I try to improve my English . 
 Thank you , sir . But I'm not allowed to accept any tips . 
 Well , would you like something else ? The new-made cafe parfait is really good . Want some ? 
 Sure . If you want more coffee , please go over there . There is self-help coffee maker . 
 Oops . Well , wait for a while . We'll get it done quickly . 
 Do you think the bad weather will last long ? 
 I hope so . We have planed to visit the square but we have to cancel it . 
 Good idea . Thanks a billion . 
 After you . 
 Pardon ? 
 University ? Why ? You asked me last year . 
 I went to Harvard University . 
 God save me ! Is there anything wrong with you ? Didn't I tell you ? 
 I did a B . A . in economics . Remember ? 
 I think he deserved his gold . 
 Yes , it's perfect ! 
 You are studying here , aren ’ t you ? 
 Do you like this campus ? 
 How come ? 
 Oh.It ’ s awful , but it can ’ t be helped . 
 How I wish my son Mark could be as excellent as your Joe ! 
 I agree . Both Joe and Mark are men of guts . 
 Hi . 
 I'm not sure yet . 
 Yes . When ? 
 Sorry , I didn't hear you . Can you say that again please ? 
 Oh , I'm busy then . Can we meet a little later ? 
 OK . Where ? 
 Oh , Where is that ? 
 OK , I'll meet you there . 
 Fine , thanks . How about you ? 
 Thank you , I just tried my best . I am very happy to know you like it . 
 Well , yes . Several colleagues from different departments helped me with that . They are very supportive . I consulted an economic expert last week . He was very kind to give valuable suggestions . 
 Come on , don ’ t flatter me anymore . I took the job because I love being challenged . But I can ’ t get this turned around without the support from you people . 
 Can't you stay for a little bit longer , it's only 8 . 
 OK.See you on Today . 
 You too.Thanks for dropping in . 
 Yeah . But in my heart of hearts , I find he ’ s not very much to my liking . 
 The problem is that I just have no one to turn to right now . 
 Hi , Jim . How are you ? I haven't seen you for a while . 
 Where were you ? 
 What do you think of the novel you just finished reading ? 
 What do you like best about it ? 
 What do you think of the ending ? 
 Quite a few times , I had my back to the wall . 
 That ’ s right . 
 Is that your phone ? 
 It's very impressive . Can you use the Internet on your phone ? 
 That's really convenient . Does it have the Bluetooth ? 
 No , but I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go . 
 Good morning , Mary ! 
 I want to have a few friends over for a dinner party to celebrate my birthday . Would you be able to come the next weekend on Saturday ? 
 Yes , if that's all right for you . 
 Oh , good . If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock , that would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner . 
 Don't worry . I'm sure you'll do better next time . 
 It doesn't matter . Forget it . 
 Oh ! That's much hetter than I did . 
 There's no secret at all . The only thing for you to do is to practice more . You will succeed . 
 It's a pleasure . Come on . I'm on your side . 
 What time are you leaving ? 
 Take care and give my best to you parents . 
 Come back . You haven't paid yet . 
 But he took some newspaper away without paying . 
 Why ? You make me confused . 
 Why does he have such a privilege ? 
 I see . Does he live by himself ? 
 He must be lonely ? 
 How respectable ! 
 I need to get on the Internet . 
 Yes , I have it . 
 That ’ s okay . 
 Then what do I need to do ? 
 What do I do to log on to the computer ? 
 Okay . Thanks for your help . 
 Yes , I am . When is the wedding ? 
 August bride . How nice ! By the way , who is going to be the matron of honor ? 
 Oh , yeah ? I wonder who is going to give Jane away at the wedding . You know her father passed away several years ago . 
 I think so . The wedding will be held at her church , right ? 
 Do you know where they will go on their honeymoon ? 
 Don ’ t do that again . You are riding the tiger . 
 You will ask for it . 
 Hurry up ! Time is money ! 
 But you are too slow to follow them . 
 Watch out ! You'll hit that car if you're not careful . 
 You see . I told you you'd hit him if you weren't careful . 
 Oh , so it was my fault , was it ? If I hadn't warned you in time it would have been much worse . 
 I didn't sleep a wink last night . 
 Well , I am under a lot of pressure . My boss is very pushy . He assigned me three projects . Now the deadlines are near , and I still have not finished all of my projects . 
 Well , I guess no one can help me but myself . For the moment , I just need someone to talk to , so that I can relieve my stress . 
 Sure , When is good time for you ? 
 What time do you want me there ? 
 All right , It's a date . 
 What's her figure ? 
 What's the color of her eyes ? 
 What ’ s the life expectancy in your country ? 
 About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It ’ s a problem that will soon affect most of the world . 
 Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday . 
 How ’ s your son these days ? 
 He ’ ll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you think it is a good age to have a child ? 
 Yes , I think you ’ re right . I ’ m thinking about having a child , but not just yet . 
 Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life . Parents usually try to discourage them , but they don ’ t often succeed . 
 It ’ s almost impossible to get the right balance . If you are too strict , kids might ignore you . If you are too lenient , they might go wild . 
 You're screwed . You can't do anything about that . You have to hope that you get some classes that will be useful . 
 No . They will tell you the same thing in a worse way . 
 Of course . Registering for classes is not something you want to miss . 
 Well , I know psychology 101 is a big class , so there will always be seats in that class . You can also get into Sociology . 
 I took that class last year . The professor is really cool , so if you go to his office , you can have him sign a card that will let you in even if the class is full . 
 I guess that's because so many people drop out of that class . 
 No problem , man . 
 Any time . I'm just glad I could help . 
 What's the matter ? Are you OK ? 
 Don't worry . You have plenty of time to decide . 
 You always worry too much about everything . Take it easy , honey . You are good enough . You can go to the ideal college . 
 In a perfect world , I would enjoy my work if I do not have to do much , and make lots of money ! 
 That's only a joke . To be honest , I have to improve my English , because my English is not good enough . I still get confused about some simple grammars . Since you are quite good at it , do you have any suggestions ? 
 Is the training center helpful ? 
 I'm glad we live in a small town . 
 Because the houses look so nice at Christmas time . 
 Yes , we have a big tree this year . I bought the decorations at the five-and-tencent store yesterday . Do you want to come and see it ? 
 When can you come ? 
 You know , smoking does do harm to your health . 
 Why don't you try to give it up ? 
 Have you ever thought of just cutting down ? You could do it gradually . 
 Hello , Jim . What was the film like ? 
 Why ? What was it about ? 
 A lot of young people have to do that . 
 lt sounds like the story of my life . 
 I take sleeping pills sometimes . 
 It sounds a very depressing film . 
 I don't know . My wife used to speak French . I must tell her to brush it up . 
 Sure . 
 Do we have enough time ? 
 The seats are excellent . We're right in the center . 
 I can't agree more . 
 In the United States , yes . But back in China , I went to concerts a couple of times with my parents . 
 We have two . One is like this one . The other is a little smaller . 
 May I help you ? 
 It closes at six . 
 No , not every day . 
 Absolutely . 
 Saturday ’ s hours are from nine in the morning to six-thirty at night . 
 What else can I help you with ? 
 Whose part do you think is best played ? 
 You're absolutely right ! That's the very figure I like best . 
 Vince , I think one of your programmers is spying on us for WebTracker . 
 I won't say who , because I'm not sure yet . But I'll know soon . 
 It isn't Elvin . 
 Loan me that tape recorder you have . And don't say anything to anyone until I come back . 
 Hi , Lin Tao . I have't seen you for some time . 
 Yes , the same as ever , thanks . What about you ? 
 Good bye then , and keep in touch . 
 Fixing computer isn ’ t my cup of tea . You can leave this job to Jason . 
 But what ? 
 What a great weekend that was ! 
 I really enjoy the beach in the summer . 
 We should come here more often . 
 I'd like to come back next weekend . 
 Aren ’ t you going to swim ? 
 You are not telling me that we drove 50 miles to come here for just sunbath , are you ? 
 What about your beautiful bathing suit ? We shopped all day . Don't you want to show it off ? 
 All right . Suit yourself . I am going swimming . 
 Yes ? 
 I've got a better idea . Why don ’ t we hire a boat and go for a ride ? What do you think ? 
 How dare you accuse me of stealing your computer ? 
 The flood will come on the heels of the heavy rain . 
 I ’ m sure they will . 
 No problem . 
 You mean the white building near the playground ? 
 That is the library . And it has more than 1,000 , 000 books . 
 You know , our school is divided into two parts , the junior high school and the senior high school . That is the new classroom building for our senior high school . 
 Yes . There is a large swimming pool , but it is only available in summer . 
 I believe that you can make your dream come true . 
 I try and look at the programmes that are on to decide which particular ones interest me , rather than you turning it on a seven o'clock and you leaving it on until half-past eleven when the programmes finish . 
 Un ... I think it can be a time-waster and it depends on how particular people are about what they want to see ... Mm , it can just be a sort total amusement for someone and totally consuming without reallyconsidering what it is they're watching . 
 Well , I suppose one of the problems is ... will depend on what a person's life style is , and that if he has other outside interests which are equally important to him as television , he will then , you know , hmm . be more careful about which programme she wants to watch because he has time which he wants to use for other things . 
 Yes , I think that is a danger , and I think that . . in fact is what mishappening to a lot of people who use it as their ... their main ... um field of amusement and ... because they don't have other outside interests and even when people come round they'll leave the television and not be , you know , particularly interested in talking to them , you Know the television will be the main thing in the room . 
 Thanks . 
 I feel the same way . 
 Yeah . He has no one to count on . 
 What's your trouble ? 
 I got it . 
 What is the problem ? 
 Are you planning on having someone take notes for you ? 
 When , exactly do you need to leave ? 
 Fine , but next time try and not have to miss class again . 
 See you later ! Drive carefully . 
 I wouldn't do it if I were you . 
 It's very dangerous , you know . 
 It's an easy way to get hurt , let me tell you . 
 Well , take care of yourself , and don't say I didn't warn you . 
 I think he has realized that . But he is still whistling in the dark by putting up an act . 
 But when I noticed that he was left in the cold , I could not help wanting to help him to get out of the situation . 
 What's he like ? 
 You must feel very uneasy at his home . 
 Hi ! I'm Nancy . Nice to meet you . 
 Where are you from ? 
 I'm from Chicago . 
 It's fun . 
 Oh , I am very sorry , Hans . Thank you for waiting for me . You must have been here a long time already . 
 I was caught in the heavy rain , or I would have come earlier . I am sorry I kept you waiting . 
 Yes . When I came out of the subway , it was raining cats and dogs . And I forgot my umbrella . So I had to wait for the rain to let up . 
 Good morning , Jim ! 
 Yes , it is . The sun is shining . There is no wind , only a pleasant breeze . 
 We have decided to go to the park this Sunday . Would you like to go with us if you have not decided yet ? 
 He ’ s predicting clear skies . 
 Come in , come in , what can I do for you ? 
 Yes , I am applying on it . 
 Aren't you a bit young ? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up . 
 Well , if you think you are ready , I'll let you enroll . 
 Management is going through a big turnover these days . With Bill's retirement , and department realignment , we have lost about 1/3 of our managerial staff . They've been dropping like flies ... 
 Actually , I don't think so . Supervisors are really important to make sure everything goes smoothly in the workplace . They are necessary for divvying up work and disciplining employees . If there is no one to keep an eye on us , no one would get any work done . You know what they say , when the cat's away , the mice play . 
 Alright ... I get your point . 
 It's interesting , I like being an editor . 
 I like talking to writers , I get to meet a lot of interesting people . 
 I don't feel bored at all . I'm getting along with my colleagues . I will enjoy working with them . People are great in this industry . 
 No , I have no complaints . I hear there are many opportunities to move up in this company . is that true ? 
 That's perfect . I will definitely do well . 
 No , I don't think we have . 
 How do you do ? Mr . Brown . I am Susan Heywood . 
 Really ? I am glad to meet you . 
 Why don ’ t you sit down and relax , darling ? 
 Well , come and talk to me then . 
 May I turn on the radio then ? 
 So that we can sit down together and listen to some music . 
 Ok , I will . But let ’ s go to a disco after dinner . 
 David , why don't you clean your room ? 
 Why are you feeling depress ? 
 I don't think she would do such a thing . 
 Oh , cheer up ! A girlfriend is not everything . 
 Then forgive her mistake . 
 My sister was taken to the hospital yesterday 
 She was hit by a car . Luckily , she wasn't seriously hurt . 
 We'll have to hurry ; visiting hours will be over soon 
 What are the good sights to see in Beijing ? 
 Hello , let me introduce myself . I'm your new neighbor . My name is Andy . 
 Nice meeting you , too . 
 Thanks for the invitation . I will ! 
 I usually calm down first and think about the reason that caused my anger . 
 Something like listening to music is a good idea . 
 Classic . Something that could calm your mind . 
 Working out is another good way to relieve anger . 
 Jogging , yoga , or even just taking a walk . 
 What a shame ! 
 Your boyfriend , Bryan , wanted to toss the football . I think he wore me out . 
 You're like the tenth person to say that . 
 Whatever . I wish people would just leave me alone ! 
 Who cares ? She is pretty . 
 You're just jealous . 
 Thank you.You ' re partial . 
 It's nice to hear that anyway . 
 I ’ Ve never seem such a scene either except in films . 
 In my wedding ceremony , where do my parents sit in the church ? 
 Do friends of the bride always sit on one side of the church and friends of the groom on the other ? 
 Hi , Mary ! You're here already . Where's Harry ? 
 That should give us time for a cup of coffee . I'll go and get some . 
 Why did the teacher criticise Myra in front of the whole class ? 
 I don't think that Myra should have spoken so rudely to the teacher . I know she was angry , but that's still no excuse for rudeness . 
 Not rally . 200 years ago , it was just a small insignificant village . 
 Large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . The village quickly grew into a key industrial centre . 
 Yes , it did . The names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city . 
 Oh , yes . Several of the buildings from the villages still survive . Many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . There was a castle near one village , so our city has a castle too . 
 What is wrong with your face ? 
 Why ? 
 How's Jerry's new school ? 
 He's a team player . 
 How many people are there in your family ? 
 Is your brother older or younger than you ? 
 What's the problem ? You don't look happy . 
 How come ? 
 Why don't you go to the English corner to talk to your classmates in English quite often ? 
 You should always keep in mind , the more you practice , the better English you can speak . 
 Come on . It ’ s quite safe . You really have no guts . 
 No . Someone had stolen a march on me and bought it . 
 It is marvelous , and the price is marvelous , as well . 
 I want to return this video . 
 I also need to check this magazine out . 
 I don ’ t understand . 
 What can I check out ? 
 I need this magazine . 
 That ’ s weird . 
 No . What happened ? 
 Don't be angry , you lose money just to avoid misfortune . 
 Ok , so who are we going to invite to our dinner party ? 
 Don't forget my friend Andy from the office . He has nothing to do on Friday , so I invited him over . 
 Why can't we ? 
 I'm not sure . He just broke up with his girlfriend recently , and I don't think he's in the mood to start again so soon . 
 I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill . It's only a superstition . It really doesn't mean anything . 
 Ok , ok . I'll ask my sister to come . That way we'll have fourteen for dinner . 
 Hello , 8520388 2 . 
 Hi , Maria , this is Shirley . 
 Hold on for a moment please . I'm fetching my textbook . 
 Oh , the homework is to explain what economic law is both in broad sense and in narrow sense . 
 Yes . You can use your textbook for your reference . 
 I don't think so , Maria , but I think you can look for information on the Internet . 
 Oh , there isn't such a code called economic law . The Economic Law of China is a general concept for several laws . 
 Yes , it's a general name for several laws related to economics , like Commercial Law , and Law of Central Bank . 
 I just dropped in to say goodbye . 
 I ’ ll leave at ten o ’ clock . 
 Thank you , I will . Hope to see you again next year . 
 They must have practiced a lot . The perseverance has made them they are today . 
 Let me have a look . Well , it lists some shows that will be on next week . 
 Hmm ... Oh , this one , ' The Drunken Beauty ' . This is a real classic . 
 Of course not . She was said to be the most beautiful woman in her time and that made her become the queen . They play was famous for its singing and dancing . 
 She is an opera star in China . Her teacher's teacher is Mei Landfang . 
 You are such an expert on it . I don't know that . 
 So , want me to book the tickets again ? 
 We can do that if you like . Maybe next weekend . 
 That was heaven ! 
 Really ? 
 Well , whatever it does , I feel transformed ! 
 Give it to me . 
 It ’ s from NYU . 
 I didn ’ t get accepted . 
 I ’ m serious . 
 NYU was my first choice . 
 I ’ ll just have to wait for UCLA . 
 Study , study , study . I want to learn a lot . 
 Yes . I am going to take some university courses there . 
 Yes , but I think it's probably for the best . 
 Hey , I am a pretty cool guy . I will make friends , and I'll have a lot of extracurricular activities too . You know , like fencing , or theater or something . 
 Yesterday morning was beautiful i thought the sunning was going to continue . 
 I know . i could not believe it when i got hit by that storm.it was pouring with rain all afternoon . 
 If it was sunning all year round there would be drought.you probably would not like it either . 
 The weather forecasters are not good at predicting the weather would be like.our weather is so changeable . 
 Birds of a feather flock together . 
 Oh , it ’ s fine . I ’ Ve got a very nice secretary and a large pleasant office . 
 And a company car . 
 Yes , it is . But I ’ Ve got a lot of work too . 
 What a surprise meeting you here , Landy . 
 It ’ s a small world , isn ’ t it ? 
 So you're traveling around the world , aren't you . 
 When did you arrive here ? 
 Did you have a good journey ? 
 Where have you been on this trip ? 
 Really ? How long will your holiday last ? 
 All these countries in two weeks ? 
 Please do excuse me for a moment . I've got diarrhea . 
 It may have something to do with the food I had last night 
 I will . Thank you . 
 Well , last night I had a big argument with Ann . 
 Now that I look back at it , it wasn't that big a deal . I shouldn't have lost my temper . 
 It's just we've been planning to go the beach for a while , and we decided we could both make it this weekend . Then out of nowhere she called me up , said her boyfriend had made plans and that she need to cancel the trip . I was so angry when she told me that I said she didn't care about our friendship at all . 
 I know , but I was so upset . I mean , come on ! Does she have to do everything her boyfriend says ? 
 Well , I think I was being a little selfish myself . I know they don't get to see each other very often . 
 Yeah , I'll call later to patch things up . 
 Don't do that to me , honey . Give me a chance , please . I make a solemn promise never to drink alcohol again . 
 Have a heart , honey . You know I am trying hard to quit drinking , don't you ? Just give me one more chance , please ! 
 Oh , I am so tired . My back is sore and my neck hurts . 
 You are wrong , Shirley . I was always absent-minded in the class . I meant to concentrate on the class , but I was just so tired . Maybe I am old . 
 One of my friends took the Adult College Entrance Exam last year . He filled the school column with his name , and his score was relinquished . 
 He said he hadn't taken any exams for ten years , and couldn't get used to it immediately . He was extremely nervous then . 
 Yeah . The test was fairly easy and almost every test-taker could pass that exam . Adult College Entrance Exam is much easier than college entrance exam . And there are fewer subjects . 
 What did you do over the weekend ? 
 Do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ? 
 Like what ? 
 What else can we do to protect the environment ? 
 How about recycling ? Does that actually help ? 
 What do you think the biggest worry for our future is ? 
 I had no idea you were such an environmentalist before ! 
 Merry Christmas , Bill ! 
 What do you want to do to celebrate Christmas ? 
 I'll go to church first and then go to a Christmas party . Would you like to come ? 
 See you . 
 I like to go to the movies . What do you do in your free time ? 
 Well that's great ! It's nice that we have something in common . 
 That cat . 
 It ’ s me , mum , I am sorry . 
 Yes , and you could too if your hair wasn't hanging down in your face . 
 You like it , but it's getting to be a handicap for you . 
 I know a great hairdresser not far from here and she is cute too . 
 Did I mention she's good at cutting hair too ? 
 Not too bad , thanks . And you ? 
 Oh , they are fine . They are enjoying their retirement . 
 Say hi to your family for me . 
 Where should I sit ? 
 Okay . 
 It's Lin . It's spelled L-I-N . 
 My pronunciation is not very good . It's L-I-N , Lin . 
 Lin is a common Chinese last name . 
 Ready for what ? 
 Yes . I am ready . 
 Of course I ’ m nervous . 
 I won ’ t know anybody at that school . 
 Why not ? 
 That ’ s a good way to think about it . 
 Eh , so so . 
 Nah , not too flashy . 
 I guess . 
 And I ’ m trying to watch the game , but you ’ re yapping on about your new clothes ! 
 Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ’ s the third quarter and you ’ Ve been blabbering on since the first ! 
 Oh no you didn ’ t . You didn ’ t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ’ t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ? 
 And Merry Christmas ! 
 Don ’ t be worried . Please sit down and take it easy . 
 But you should avoid finger-pointing when you haven ’ t got the real facts . 
 Hey , Mike . You've been surfing the Net for quite a while . What on earth are you searching for ? 
 Well , roughly speaking , a hacker is a computer buff . 
 You can say that . 
 They must have mixed hackers with crackers . 
 There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers , but they aren't . They break into computers and break the phone system . Real hackers call these people crackers , and want nothing to do with them . 
 Well , the real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy , irresponsible and not very bright , and feel that being able to break security does make you a hacker any more than being able to start cars without keys makes you an automotive engineer . Unfortunately , many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word hacker to describe crackers . This irritates real hackers to no end . 
 You got it . 
 You are welcome . 
 You usually are good about turning it in ; what happened ? 
 But couldn't you have done it when you felt better ? 
 You have already missed one other assignment ; when can I expect the make-ups ? 
 That will be soon enough , but make sure you get next week's assignment in as well , all right ? 
 Good . I know that you are capable of being an excellent student . 
 There are several interesting articles on recent scientific breakthroughs . I just finished reading one about cloning . 
 According to the article , you have no real need to worry . Research nowadays is focussing on cloning parts of a human body to replace damaged or lost parts , not on recreating a whole human . 
 In this article , scientists say that if you took the genes from someone and tried to create a copy of a person , there ’ s no guarantee that the copy would look or act like the original ! 
 I read about how scientists are using material from plants and animals to create new medicines . For example , an animal be immune to disease that affects human . So , scientists find out why it ’ s immune 
 Thanks for helping me up . 
 I'm the hazardous one here . I made three people fall over ! 
 I'm so humiliated ! What's that man saying ? Everyone's laughing ! 
 How was the party yesterday ? 
 Oh , don't talk to me about yesterday ! It was the most awful evening I've ever had . 
 Well.John had promised to be my date , but he stood me up . I waited for a full hour in the cold wind . 
 I left after the opening dance . I couldn't wait to get out of there . 
 I wasn't quite prepared for the view of the Earth as we left . It was just awe-inspiring . It emerged from just a slightly curved horizon to a whole Earth , where you could look across oceans and continents in a single glance . I wasn't quite prepared for that . It's inevitably etched in my memory . 
 Detached . You're literally detached from one planet , captured by another . Your only link to reality is the Earth out there ; fortunate - 1y , it stays in view the whole time . 
 I believe it's certainly for real . It without question has suffered a lot of delays . But there's hardware sitting on the pad right now and it's due to go off in December . It is a reality . It has just taken longer to get literally off the ground . 
 I hope this flight is not just a one-time affair , that it does re-ignite people's interest to push on . But only time will tell . 
 If I were the man making the decisions , you could get in line tomorrow . I strongly support ordinary people going into space . Unfortunately , I don't think it will be in the near future . 
 I went to play tennis in the public park . 
 Twice a week . How about you ? 
 But it is very difficult to gather a team of players together . 
 Do you like watching football matches ? 
 Oh , I watched it on television . It was an exciting match . 
 My native place is Shanghai , which is a very beautiful cosmopolitan city . 
 Yes , I am a local resident . 
 I ’ m watching TV . 
 I will . 
 How can I help you today , Alice ? 
 Oh , good . You're an excellent student . I'd be very willing to help you with that . 
 What kind of scholarship is it ? 
 Fine . I know about that scholarship.You have to be a student in your junior year , and you have to have a grade point average of 3.7 or higher . 
 Excellent . So you'll have a good chance of getting it . 
 Do you have an essay you want to send them ? 
 What is the question ? 
 That's a pretty short essay . 
 Good luck . I'm sure you will do a good job . 
 Sure . What are they ? 
 I'd be happy to write one for you . 
 What is it ? Do you want me to read your essay ? 
 Of course I could read it . That's no problem . But you need to get it to me soon . 
 Alright . If you can bring it to me tomorrow morning , I can talk with you after class on Friday.So I'll have some feedback for you before the weekend . 
 Don't mention it . I'm always willing to help good students . 
 I heard the radio announcer say it was 18 degrees below zero . 
 My car didn't want to start either at first . 
 Not in the new apartment . We have to leave the car in the parking lot . 
 I do . Right now I have it protected up to 30 below zero . 
 Not really . It sometimes gets to 20 below . 
 What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ? 
 Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows . 
 You are absolutely right . They are too brief . They don't tell you anything . 
 I'm not feeling well . I think I'm having a cold . 
 Yeah , I will . 
 I didn't wear make-up this morning . 
 You're right.Make - up can only disguise my age , but exercise may delay it . 
 Yes , my old friend Hanson lives there 
 Yes . He's one of my best friends . Our friendship formed at college . Why did you ask that ? 
 I get it . You want to find a guide , don ’ t you ? 
 Don ’ t worry . I will call Hanson , and ask him to help you . 
 My word , you do look ill ! 
 You seem to have something on mind . Promise me , go to see the doctor right now . 
 A piece of cake . You'll be successful . 
 Yes . 
 Yes , I did . 
 Hugh Young ? Didn ’ t he use to wear a funny yellow jacket all the time ? 
 I remember Hugh . Most people thought he was a little ... uh ... peculiar . Do you know what he ’ s doing now ? 
 A millionaire ? As a jazz musician ? 
 Well ! I guess people don ’ t find him so peculiar anymore . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve won the first prize in the math contest . 
 Thank you , Paul . 
 Good , happy birthday to you ! 
 Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me . 
 Hello Gina ! We've spoken so many times on the phone but's it's so good to finally meet you in person ! 
 Oh , please don't call me sir . Just call me Jason . 
 Pretty good . There was a bit of turbulence while we were over the Pacific Ocean but it wasn't too bad . The worst thing was the guy behind me . He snored all through the night ! 
 The stewardess said it's not company policy to wake people up for any reason . 
 Not much ... but that's ok ... I'm a night owl anyway . 
 I'd love to squeeze in a trip to the Great Wall . 
 What are you going to do after you return from Washington ? 
 What will you do all day ? 
 Have you ever worked ? 
 I'm going to camp . I've gone to camp for four summers . 
 We do many things . In the morning , we go swimming and boating . In the afternoon , we play basketball or tennis . We sit around a camp fire at night.We sing or tell stories . 
 It is wonderful . What's John going to do this summer ? 
 Well , so long , Mary . Have fun . 
 Can you tell the result ? 
 Now the score is in our favor . 
 Hard to say.Now the score is in our favor . 
 They're still fighting hard.Let ' s wait and see . 
 I don't think so . Did you ever go and look at your stamp ? 
 But you've been looking for that stamp for years . 
 Bummer . I guess we're both out of luck . 
 Kate , what do you like to do tonight ? Do you often go to the movies ? 
 There ’ s a good movie called Summer in Beijing . 
 Let ’ s find out what time it starts . 
 Here it is . It starts at 8 o'clock . 
 I feel confused by all the diet options out there . I don ’ t know which one actually works . 
 Maybe you ’ re right . It is very expensive to go to a weight-loss center . I ’ d better join in a fitness club . 
 I bought an exercise dress yesterday and I found it was hard to dress it up . 
 Is it like a zoo of polar animals ? 
 It must have been fun seeing those unusual animals and birds . 
 Maybe you should let me know about your plan . I want to take my kids there some day . too . 
 May and Danny have already grown up . 
 Look at that big tree over there . 
 Do you know that I fell in love with you at the first sight . 
 But you agreed to go out with me at last . 
 I can ’ t wait to retire . 
 And then I ’ m moving to Florida where I can play golf all day , every day ! 
 What do you plan on doing after you retire ? 
 I admire your energy , Ruth . You are young at heart . 
 Sounds good , when ? 
 Any time is fine . 
 Please wait for us even if we're a little late . 
 See you then . 
 I wonder if I can ask you a question . 
 Well ... er ... it is just ... just that I ... 
 I ... er ... I just want to know if you could lend me a few bucks . 
 Yeah . But I ... 
 Yes . I'm leaving tomorrow . I came here just because I want to say good-bye to you . 
 I'll miss you too , my friends . 
 Oh , yes . Beautiful . 
 No , I am from France . 
 Of course not . 
 Laura . 
 I don ’ t think it ’ s very nice . And my father doesn ’ t like it . But my mother likes it very much . So we often come here . 
 Well , we come here almost every month . 
 It ’ s my mother . She ’ s fond of swimming . And the man beside her is my father . 
 No , I hate swimming . I prefer playing tennis . 
 It ’ s not very big . It ’ s a little over half a million square kilometers . 
 There are about 30 million people in my country . Most of them live in the north . 
 That ’ s the really hard to say . I think most people earn about two thousand dollars a month , if you convert the money from our currency into dollars . 
 I think we are richer than most countries , but not as rich as countries in western Europe . Our biggest problem at the moment is unemployment , which is roughly 8 % . It has doubled over the last four years . 
 Look at this headline - Elvis Baby Born on Spacecraft . Where do these tabloids get such crazy stories ? 
 It looks as though everyone in line reads them , or at least looks at the headlines . 
 Maybe our checker is faster at scanning the food . 
 The answer is zero ! What a let-down ! 
 No hard feelings . After all , he is a child . 
 Hi . 
 Yeah ? 
 Yeah ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry . 
 I'm so sorry , I .. I didn't realize it was that loud . 
 It's true.It was a bit loud . 
 Oh , it's no problem.It ' s OK.You know , it only happened once . 
 My mother likes to split hairs . 
 She has keen to buy something which is much cheaper . 
 Hey Bob . Whatchy doing ? 
 I didn't know you paint . What type of painting is it ? 
 That sounds so interesting . I wish I learned a hobby . 
 I think I will . Thanks for the info . 
 He is a teacher , but he makes a little money on the side by repairing cars in his free time . 
 Believe me , he is the first-class . 
 Hi Martha . Everything is perfect . 
 It couldn't be better . My husband is so supportive with my work and he helps around the house so much . 
 I'm so happy . Even though we are both working , we get to spend a lot of time with each other in the evening and on the weekends . 
 In the evening , we just sit and talk over dinner . But on the weekend , we try to go out to the beach or hit a nice restaurant , or go to a nice cafe . 
 David , why don't you clean your room ? 
 Why are you feeling depress ? 
 I don't think she would do such a thing . 
 Oh , cheer up ! A girlfriend is not everything . 
 Then forgive her mistake . 
 My brother joined the army last year . 
 He's tall and strong . 
 Look , Forest Gump is on at six thirty . 
 Yeah , I am very impressed with Tom Hanks ' performance in the movie . 
 Life is like a box of chocolates , you never know what you're gonna get . 
 You know , it also won 6 Oscar awards in 1995 . Unbelievable ! 
 Yes , the Forrest's experience can encourage the people in trouble . 
 Gucci , I have an idea . Do you want to see this movie together ? 
 I hate this kind of weather ! 
 I think he had water on the brain . This is bad . 
 Okay , Pollyanna , what's so good about this weather ? 
 We ' get ' to stay home ? Do you know something that I don't ? 
 What day is it ? 
 I'm leaving on November 10th . 
 No , it's a Monday . 
 Right . 
 Oh , it ’ s the latest novel by ray blue . It ’ s a sic-fi thriller . 
 He does . He ’ s good at this genre too . It ’ s a captivating read . 
 Yes , I would . I need to buy a textbook for my course and , as you know , I love browsing through the latest paperbacks . 
 I want to look at nelson Mandela ’ s autobiography . 
 Do you know what the BBS is ? 
 Tell me then . 
 Oh , I see , but what's it used for ? 
 Tell me in details . 
 Oh , that's great . I want to try later . 
 Any plans tonight ? 
 Well , I am wondering if we took a hang-out for a drink or something . You know , I just came back from a really tough interview . I was quite nervous during the interview . I really want to have the job . Right now , I am still a little on the edge . I am not sure if I could convince them during the interview . 
 I don ’ t know . I think I did well in the paper exams . I was prepared to answer a lot of questions , but they didn't ask those as I expected . To my surprise , the manager tried to talk about the Chinese poesy with me . 
 Just did my best . 
 I need to return these books . 
 The cover came off . 
 How much are you talking ? 
 That ’ s not bad at all . 
 Here you go . 
 You ’ re welcome . Have a nice day . 
 Maybe it is right since everything is possible . You know the market changes quickly these days . But I still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance . For me , his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy . I really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns . 
 If you refuse to take risk , you can ’ t have better returns . 
 I don't know why people are just mad about David Peckham . Is there really anything so fascinating with him ? 
 You mean he plays well ? Yeah , he often scores by free kicks in crucial games . But a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks . 
 In the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . After all , the majority of his fans are girls . 
 And he is English ! He makes a model gentleman when he puts on a black suit and speaks with a typical British accent . 
 Hard to say . Now the score is in our favor . 
 They're still fighting hard . Let's wait and see . 
 Certainly . 
 Come by any time . 
 Yes , I'll be waiting for you in my home by 10:00 . 
 Fully agree . I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel . The latest office equipment is more type-functional . It combines fax machine , copy machine and printer in one . It saves a lot of place one machine instead of three . 
 When will we get one of those ? 
 Congratulations ! Mr . Stuart ! You won the city marathon . 
 We are all very proud of you . 
 I watched the race with my children . We saw you run to the finish line . We all screamed with excitement . 
 I really dislike reading academic books . 
 Are you ok , Chuck ? You look pale . 
 Oh , poor you . You know what ? I found a new way to learn Chinese and it works very well . 
 Sure . I'm learning Chinese through songs . 
 You can say that . I can actually sing some of them now . 
 I start by listening to the song a few times and after several times I am able to follow the singer . 
 It does . I've learned some Chinese folk songs this way . They are clearly presented and easy to follow . 
 Why not ? I downloaded a beautiful song the other day . We can learn it together now . 
 Yes , just in case we run into me new characters . 
 Where to , miss ? 
 Sure thing . So , where are you flying in from ? 
 Really ? You don ’ t look very Chinese to me , if you don ’ t mind me saying so . 
 Wow sounds interesting ! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but , how old are you ? 
 Don ’ t get me wrong ! It ’ s just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas ! 
 I am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old U . S of A , although I have some Colombian heritage . 
 Uh ... yeah .. of course ! 
 Oh , boy , I hate to say this , but I really have to leave now . 
 I ’ m so sorry . 
 Have you thought of moving at all , Sarah ? 
 Buying a house can be expensive , but there are ways to find cheaper houses . 
 Well , sometimes the city auctions offer houses to the community . You ’ d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day , but you would definitely save money doing it that way . 
 Sure , my sister-in-law and her husband just bought a house that way . They ’ re pretty satisfied with it . 
 Not at all . The woman , who owned it , took good care of it . But when she died , she had no family left and no will , so the government had to sell it for her . 
 It was about 75 years old . There were a few repairs that needed doing , but it didn ’ t take a lot of money or time . 
 The area can be a bit rough in the evenings , but the neighbors watch out for each other , so it ’ s ok . 
 No , they have a big new fancy house . 
 Yes , he does . He is a science fiction writer . 
 Afraid so . The more the better . 
 Well , they spend it pretty quick . New clothes , new computers and new cars every year . And they ’ Ve got a cook and housekeeper.Mona used to be an actress , she likes to spend a lot of money . 
 No . They want children but no luck yet . 
 Jim likes to travel around the world.That ' s expensive ! So he tries to make a lot of money . 
 Oh , she enjoys spending money on fancy parties.Mona loves to wear sexy dresses , and she has quite a bit of jewelry . 
 I guess so . She is also interested in politics . She knows everyone in city government . 
 She is pretty serious about it . Her uncle is a mayor . She wants to follow in his footsteps . 
 She might do well . Everyone seems to like her . 
 Hey , I still know my name . 
 She said I have a fever but nothing major . 
 What if this small fever turns into a big fever ? 
 Who was the best teacher that you ever had ? 
 What was she like ? 
 What kind of things did you learn ? 
 Anything ? Do you really believe that we can do anything ? 
 You said she was strict . Did she have a lot of rules ? 
 I see . She sounds like she really cared about her students . 
 Really ? Doesn ’ t every teacher have a teacher ’ s pet ? 
 Do you know what she is doing now ? 
 Have you ever read one of the books ? 
 Why don ’ t you recommend one to me ? 
 Mum , this is for you . 
 Happy Mother's Day to you , Mum ! 
 Did you like the party ? 
 Why ? What had you expected ? 
 Look , daddy is on again . Don't you think he is handsome ? 
 The seats in the middle of this stadium are great , but they're already occupied by somebody else . 
 Of course , tomorrow evening there will be a most exciting game . 
 Rockets vs Lakers . Yao Ming , my idol , will appear in front of several hundred million of the worldwide audience . 
 In 2002 . And since then he has attracted more attention than ever . 
 Oh , you know something . He is 2.26 meters tall . But he is also nimble and skillful . 
 Yes , what's worse is he can't take any further part in the game . 
 Never mind . After all he is not so attractive as Yao Ming , right ? 
 Pretty ! Say beautiful rather . Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than she altogether-face and figure ? 
 Such an eye ! The true hazel eye-and so brilliant ! Regular features , open countenance , with a complexion , Oh ! What a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure ! There is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance . One hears sometimes of a child being ' the picture of health ' ; now , she always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health . She is loveliness itself . 
 This is him speaking . 
 Yes . I am very glad to have the chance . 
 Just calm down . I'm sure you'll do well . 
 I hear you ’ re taking a music class . I didn ’ t know you ’ re interested in it . 
 In my opinion , you ’ ll make it . 
 No , I ’ m serious . 
 December the fifteenth . The day after tomorrow is little Tom ’ s birthday . 
 Thirteen today and tomorrow . Fourteen the day after tomorrow . 
 And don ’ t forget Mary , Tom ’ s twin sister . It ’ s her birthday , too . 
 Peter and Mary broke up . 
 I had a wonderful evening . 
 I will . 
 Sally ? She is a bachelor girl . She is an excellent designer . Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains . 
 Oh , quite the other way round . She is a knock-out . She devotes much of her time to her career . 
 No , what ? 
 Why ? 
 Why on earth would she do that ? You mean that she intentionally did not eat any food for days ? That's crazy ! 
 I can't believe that there are girls who are willing to do that to their bodies . And all for a certain look . 
 True , but there are limits . Being thin is one thing ; starving oneself to death is another . No one forces them to do this . 
 I ’ Ve cut it up and come to the conclusion that hi is actually sick of Jenny ’ s brother . But he likes Jenny . She is a big apple in his eye . 
 That ’ s why many people look up to him . 
 No , I haven't , but I've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper . 
 Either something in the hotel business or something to do with travel . 
 I know.But I'd like to try.Look , here are some advertisements that I've cut out . 
 Yes , I am . I really don't know anyone . 
 My name is Bill . How are your lessons going ? 
 I prefer to learn English . In my opinion , English is easier than Chinese . 
 You are right . 
 Hi , Nice to meet you . 
 Mrs . Smith , what do you do for work ? 
 Oh . Where do you work ? 
 I'm a teacher . 
 I teach English . 
 At a high school in New Jersey . 
 I'm 32 . 
 I'm so sorry , Taylor . Go talk to her . I'm sure she'd be happy to see you . 
 Yi-jun said Femi was talking about you . So get out there , Tiger ! 
 Can't hurt to try . Carpe diem . Who can say if we'll be here tomorrow or not ? 
 You should be optimistic about this . Things have taken a good turn . You should remember that less than two centuries ago the dangers of train travel seemed similarly terrible . 
 It's once in blue moon . 
 The main one is radiation . There are two sorts of radiation man must fear in space . The first is radiation from the sun , and this is particularly dangerous when the sun is very active and explosions are occurring on its surface . The second , less harmful , comes from the so-called Van Allen Belts . 
 No , I was out . Was it worth watching ? 
 Oh , really ? So , Spain is through to the next round ? 
 Get up as early as six o'clock only to be jammed at every crossroad and still late for work . What a life ! I've had enough of it . 
 What should I do then ? 
 I know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus . After all , it's a sport . But do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty , polled air on the road ? 
 How many people are there in your family ? 
 That ’ s a big family . How old is your brother ? 
 What about your sister ? 
 Do you miss your family ? 
 Do you often go home ? 
 How often do you call to them ? 
 I'm terribly nervous . 
 What's wrong ? You don't like ancient Egypt ? 
 The Pyramids are amazing ! Millions of gigantic stones ... each one perfect ... 
 You sound like the TV ! You're not going to tell me that aliens built the Pyramids , are you ? 
 I don't know . My life is a big mess . Everything is so complicated . 
 But promise me , you'll keep it a secret . 
 I've fallen in love with my boss . 
 Bo , of course not . He is still single . 
 I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us . 
 Worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days . 
 It gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed . 
 How may I help you ? 
 Is that all you need ? 
 Anything else ? 
 I need your library card . 
 Do you need anything else ? 
 Your books are due back two weeks from today . 
 Did you happen to bring that book that we were talking about yesterday ? 
 Thanks so much . 
 I had no idea that there were specific things that should be given on different anniversaries . 
 It says that traditionally , give something made of paper . 
 I'm going to the park to play baseball with the guys . 
 Yeah , but that was before the guys ask me to join the team . 
 You know how much I want to be on the team , and now there is an opening for me.If I don't go to practise today.They ' ll get someone else and I'll miss my chance . 
 I know , and I will . 
 After baseball practice . 
 No , I won't . I'm going to skip TV tonight and work on your chess game with you if that's ok with you . 
 No problem , I'll play as hard as I can and give you an extra game to say thanks . 
 Probably my parents . 
 Well , during school , they wanted good grades . Then after I got a job , they wanted me to get a better job . And finally , they want me to get married . 
 Your parents are not like that ? 
 You're lucky . 
 Not much I can do . It's always there . I sometimes go out with some friends and drink , but that's only a temporary solution . The stress always returns in the morning . 
 Sure . Sounds great . Let's go . 
 He prefers suits to jackets . 
 As a matter of fact , he is . 
 She must be a good wife . 
 I see . 
 I don't know . I just woke up . 
 Okay . It looks like rain . 
 The sky is gray . 
 No . 
 The street isn't wet . 
 You'd better take an umbrella . 
 Yeah how ’ d you know ? 
 Yeah ! I just started my training today and I ’ m not really sure where to begin . 
 Well , I don ’ t want to be ripped like you ! I just want a good physique with weights and Carpio . 
 Got it ! Wow is that the weight you are lifting ? My goodness that ’ s a lot of weight ! 
 I don't know how John can put up with his son , who fools around without working . 
 If I were him , I would give him a good talking-to . I would insist on his stopping fooling around like that . 
 I have never tried it . 
 Sorry , I don't think I can . 
 Friday is great . 
 Gordon , you're ever so late . 
 But there's a bus every ten minutes , and you are over 1 hour late . 
 How on earth can you miss several buses ? 
 Oh , come on , Gordon , it's the afternoon now . Why were you late really ? 
 Have you got it now ? 
 When ? 
 I am not convinced by your explanation . 
 Oh , Goodness , please not again.That ' s what we did last week . 
 Right , it was a chick flick , just like this one , so what's the difference ? Besides , this is the last week for the third movie in Destroyer series and I want to see that on a big screen . Action movies need to be seen in a theater on a big screen . 
 Oh , sure , it was great . I had popcorn for dinner and paid the price of a movie ticket to get a two-hour nap . 
 That place doesn't have a single meat dish.Just fish and shellfish and you know I don't like fish that much . 
 But when I pick the restaurant , we go to a place that has both chicken and fish . I always respect your food preferences . 
 Now you're talking , we can see that love story next time . 
 Really well , thanks . 
 She's not bad . She's a bit bossy , but I'm sure I'll get used to her . 
 She's far better than my old boss . He didn't know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down . 
 They are all pretty easy-going . It's a very friendly place to work . 
 Of course . I spent so much time at my old workplace that I got to know them all very well . They were like family to me . 
 Sure . Since we work together in teams , we have to get along with each other . 
 Yes , it helps everyone to understand what we're doing from different perspectives . 
 I prefer it to working independently . I think most people do . 
 That's wonderful . Congratulations . 
 I'd love to . What date is it ? 
 What day is that ? 
 Yes , sure . What time will the wedding begin ? 
 Very good ! I'm looking forward to it . Please give my best regards to John . And I wish you best luck ! 
 So do you think you can get to the office alone ? 
 Do you think the taxi driver will understand you ? 
 Ok but how will we know if you are going to be late ? 
 You and Bob have finished ? 
 Are you going to be okay ? 
 Tony looks very handsome in the suit . 
 Judge from his look , he's a very serious person . 
 You are friend of Janet , right ? I am Andrew , Andrew Smith . 
 I'm sorry , I didn't quite catch that . 
 Wow ! It ’ s packed . 
 it's getting cold . 
 Oh , it's made of wool . I like the striped pattern . 
 it looks great , but you need something to go with it . It's too plain on its own . 
 that's a good idea . When did you buy it ? Is it a name brand ? 
 that looks lovely . Just one more thing---you need a pair of earrings . 
 perfect ! 
 thanks . We should be ourselves . There are so many fashion victims out there . 
 Susan ? What brings you here today ? 
 Really ? So what ’ s the news ? 
 Hello , Mary . 
 Here is my friend Bob . 
 Are you free tonight ? 
 Wanna chill out and watch cable ? 
 It's a drama called Soul Food . This channel is BET-Black Entertainment Television . It has black shows , news and commercials . 
 BET has black shows that are overlooked by mainstream white TV . 
 My boss wore a real stupid tie to work today . Can you guess why ? 
 He is , but I didn't mean that . His daughter bought him a tie as a Father's Day gift , and he was very happy to wear it and show it off to us in the office . 
 No , it's great being a father , seeing your children growing up and loving you and admiring you . 
 So Alex , you ’ re off to the Olympic stadium then ? 
 Wow , that should be really exciting , especially with so many famous athletes there . 
 Well have a good time . Get me some autographs if you can . 
 Where did you go yesterday ? 
 How often do you play tennis ? 
 I seldom play tennis . I prefer football and basketball . 
 I usually play with my schoolmates . 
 Yes , I went to the Than He Sports Center for the football match last Sunday . 
 Thank you Bill , and good morning Salt Lake City ! 
 Well , it ’ s a bit of a mixed bag in Utah today . we ’ Ve got heavy cloud cover here in Northern Utah , and we ’ re calling for scattered showers throughout the day , with a day-time high of forty-five degrees.Now , if we move down to the south of the state , we can see that a cold front is moving in.We can expect clear skies , but it will be quite cold , with temperatures hovering around the thirty degree mark . 
 Well , it ’ ll be a rainy day for Northern Utah.we can expect some isolated downpours in the morning . Winds will be coming in from the North East , with gusts reaching twenty-three miles per hour . Salt Lake City can expect the rain to turn to sleet in the evening . Things are looking a bit better for the South.we ’ ll see cloudy skies with a chance of showers . Later in the day , we can expect partlycloudy skies , with a forecast high of thirty-eight degrees . 
 That ’ s right Bill . We will have more later on today on the six o ’ clock news . That ’ s the weather forecast for this morning . 
 You mean as in Sylvester Stallone ? 
 I am having a hard time at my job . 
 My colleagues quickly get promotions , while I always get sidelined . I don't know what to do anymore . 
 But I don't know what else I can do . I am willing to work hard . Sometimes I make mistakes and the boss is not happy . 
 Tell that to my boss . 
 Yes . 
 He was also assassinated because of his views . 
 Well , if he can become president , then I can at least get a promotion . 
 Well , my particular interest is collecting stamps , especially the rare ones . What about you ? 
 So have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ? 
 Oh , hi ! 
 Pleased to meet you . My name is Alice . Did you just move in next door ? 
 Me ? I guess so . I've lived here for about six years now . Have you lived in America very long ? 
 I teach mathematics at a college . What do you do ? 
 Well , Tom . It's good to meet you . I have to go now . I am teaching a class this evening , and I need to get to the college . 
 See you around ! 
 Excuse me . I am interested in getting a library card . 
 OK , here it is . 
 Here's my license and form . 
 Yes , I know what to do . 
 OK . 
 Hey , Frank . I heard you got a new job . 
 Is it true that you have a heavy work schedule ? 
 So , why did you apply for such a demanding job ? 
 Oh , I see . And can your family utilize 5 the health insurance , too ? 
 That ’ s a great employment benefit ! 
 He has come to life in the end . 
 Yes . Fortunately , an ambulance passed in the nick of time , and we got him away to hospital . 
 Wish him to be healthy soon . 
 No , not really . 
 Well , it's very expensive and they're usually singing in another language . That kind of gets on my nerves . 
 Lisa wins the first prize in the English speech contest of her college . 
 But I always feel disappointed . I have many problems with English learning . 
 I feel confused about the grammars . 
 And my writing is not good . I feel so frustrated . 
 I know that , mom . But sometimes I'm just sad . 
 Yes , mom . You are right . Nothing is impossible to a willing heart . I will keep going . 
 fantastic ! I got an overall score of eight . 
 yes . I'm just waiting until I officially get admitted to the university with a conditional offer to apply for my visa . 
 no . 
 that's not too far away . Do you think I'll get a visa ? 
 yes , I've been to Tailband , Egypt , and Japan . 
 never . 
 no , I want to come back to China after I graduate . 
 I've received a full scholarship , so I won't need any other money to live off while I'm studying . 
 that's be great . The more prepared I am , the better . 
 I'm Patti Whitney.Isn ' t this convention great ? 
 No , I've been coming for the last 3 years.Each year keeps getting better.Where are you from ? 
 I'm from the other side of the coast--Los Angeles . 
 Have you been to California ? 
 How many kids do you have ? 
 Well , California ’ s changed over the last little while.You should come back out sometime . 
 Don ’ t you know that she was the only one who had received the invitation in the office ? 
 Sure . 
 No.The time we have spent apart has been good for us.Absence makes the heart grow fonder . 
 I ’ m returning these books . 
 Here are all of them . 
 I didn ’ t have time to return them . 
 How much ? 
 25 cents a day ? 
 That ’ s expensive . 
 That's right . I thought I'd give it a shot . 
 What shall we do after the volleyball match ? 
 That's a good idea . I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family . 
 I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must . 
 Is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ? 
 Oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ? 
 Any other ideas ? 
 It all sounds great . We can go there after the match . I can't wait to see what they have . 
 What do you have to do to grease the palm of him ? 
 You can go and ask your father . 
 Thanks ! I'm so happy . It's like a dream come true . 
 Hi Vicky . 
 Yes . 
 That's no problem . I just wanted to tell you I'm inside . 
 On the second floor . 
 Come upstairs . 
 Oh , Can you hear me OK ? I said , come to the second floor . 
 Just looking at some books on how to learn English . 
 No , I'm still full from dinner . 
 I don't know for sure . When you get here we'll talk about it . 
 Bye . 
 She's my grandma . 
 92 . 
 I ’ d say the main reason is poverty . Countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . If their neighbors have some resources , they try to steal them by military force . 
 Several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end . 
 I don ’ t think that there is any easy way . The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . The thing is to find the real problem form the war and solve that . 
 It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries . 
 The problem is that many poor people might suffer . 
 Well , it's hard to say . I cough a lot in the evening . 
 You're right , but you know , it's hard to give up an old habit . 
 You know , I often have to work til late at night . I need something to keep me awake . 
 Thank you for your advice ! I'll try it . 
 In that case , I won't keep you any longer . Drop in any time . 
 See you later . 
 I'd love to , but my mother asks me to go home before 11:00 every night . She will worry if I get home late . 
 I have no choice . My mother is always very strict with me . 
 You're right . Mother's love is the greatest love in the world . 
 I'm feeling very sad . I just read the newspaper . 
 According to the newspaper , the town was razed by an earthquake and more than 10 thousand people died in the earthquake . 
 Yeah , we have to do something to help the people in the stricken area . 
 It's a good idea . But where can we donate money ? 
 Yes , let's do it now . 
 You mean Lily ’ s boyfriend ? 
 Well , he is a hard case . Everyone would feel headache about him . 
 That's the new teacher . 
 She's very nice . 
 English , of course . 
 Yes.She teaches our class three times a week . 
 Not very much . 
 Judy , what is everybody talking about ? 
 You ’ re kidding . It can ’ t be true . 
 Really ? I ’ m surprised . 
 Hi , Mike . Haven't seen you for a while . How's Cathy ? 
 What happened ? Did you break up ? 
 Oh , I am sorry . Maybe you were just emotional at that moment . Do you think you guys can get back together ? 
 Oh , you are such a dog ! 
 I wouldn't say that.They seem to be on good terms but actually they always speak ill of each other . 
 I went to Jessie's birthday party yesterday . It was very good . 
 We ate a lot of things . We played games and gave gifts to Jessie . We had a lot of fun . 
 My birthday comes next month . I want to hold a birthday party , too . 
 My friend finally dumped her boyfriend , and she's sworn she's going to abstain until she finds the right man to marry . 
 She's doing great , she's getting her confidence back , and her self-esteem , has improved drastically.She ' s very happy . 
 Do you have any plans for next Sunday evening ? 
 My friend , who had the mishap , wants to take us to dinner to show her gratitude for helping her . 
 She feels you gave me the freedom to be able to assist her and she appreciates that . Come on , Let's indulge her . 
 No thanks . I like to run in the morning . I ran a couple of miles when I woke up today . 
 I couldn ’ t either at first , but you get used to it . 
 Well , why don ’ t you come tomorrow ? I ’ ll stop by your house on my way out . 
 I ’ ll give you a call around 6 o'clock and stop by around 6 thirty . 
 Great , I ’ ll see you then . 
 How's the weather today ? 
 Is it going to rain today ? 
 But I heard it might rain . 
 I really love this music . It's a compilation . 
 And you got them off the Net ? 
 Well , thanks for asking for my permission ... Now hand it over and let me record ! 
 Um , which of them is the better typist ? 
 Is there any difference in their short hand ? 
 How about languages ? 
 Um . That doesn ’ t really matter . Because we have more French visitors than German . 
 Does he like that country ? 
 Would you ask him to tell us more about the country ? 
 Yes , it is . Hi , Tom ! It's a real surprise to see you here . 
 Nothing much . What about you ? Is everything going well ? 
 How was it ? 
 Sorry , I've got a meeting in half an hour . 
 Great ! It's good to see you . Goodbye ! 
 Give me your email , would you ? 
 Ok ... I ’ ll talk to you later . Bye 
 I just got off the phone with my boyfriend . He is always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing . It ’ s so hard to talk to him at times . 
 Yeah but , he is always in a really foul mood . I try to find out what ’ s bothering him or get him to talk about his day but , he always shuts down and brushes me off . 
 I guess you are right . What do you think I should do ? He wasn ’ t always this grouchy you know ... 
 You are something else you know that ? 
 Hello , Karl . I ’ m Chuck Jones . We ’ re going to be neighbors . 
 This is a small town , and we like to be neighborly . We know everyone who lives around here . 
 So , tell me , Karl , why did you come all the way to Minnesota to live ? 
 Look ! It ’ s the start of the Olympic Games . 
 You want to watch , don ’ t you ? 
 Please yourself . 
 Yeah , it's very easy . But it's above Nick's head 
 He's always confused by easy questions . 
 What ’ s wrong ? That was a great goal . 
 Looks like you ’ re going to lose out on this game then . 
 What were the odds ? 
 Too bad . 
 Yes , Friday I have a class , right after work . 
 Saturday my parents are coming to town . What ’ s up ? 
 No , do you want to go and do something ? 
 Oh , that sounds great . How about 6 o ’ clock ? 
 Yes , of course . I need your student ID please . 
 Okay , Susan . It says here that you are a business major and you are in your second year . Is this information correct ? 
 Sure.That ’ s not a problem.Do you have the list of courses you want to taketh semester ? 
 Yeah , that ’ s perfect . What about the subjects for your minor ? 
 Wow , you are going to be busy this semester ! Okay , here you go . You are registered now . you ’ ll have to make your first tuition payment before classes start . 
 Not rally . 200 years ago , it was just a small insignificant village . 
 Large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . The village quickly grew into a key industrial centre . 
 Yes , it did . The names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city . 
 Oh , yes . Several of the buildings from the villages still survive . Many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . There was a castle near one village , so our city has a castle too . 
 Most of our customers are foreigners . How many foreign languages can you speak , Elizabeth ? 
 And how well can you speak them ? 
 And how about your Spanish ? 
 I see . Well , we have a lot of Spanish customers , but you wouldn't need to write any Spanish here . 
 Did you watch the old-fashioned wrestling game last night ? 
 You bet . The wrestlers had got sound defences and they simply couldn't make it . 
 I don ’ t see any problem , only the car is a bit old . 
 Get in . 
 Click your right key of mouse and choose QQ Zone . 
 Yep ! The nick name for your zone , address , gender and so on . Some of them are privacy , so you have the right to keep secret here . 
 You can choose one type to make it as your background , and then find a music player and put your favorite songs into it , so your visitors can enjoy the music after entering into your zone . 
 Certainly . 
 Look ! David gives his following-comment on my first blog . He is my first visitor . 
 Yes . 
 Well , that happens . I hope she is all right . 
 That is the down side of an office romance . I hope their work is not affected by the emotional stress . The boss must be very annoyed if that will be the case . 
 Hi Bill , I saw your grandma yesterday . 
 I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track . 
 Well , it pays off for her . How old is she anyway ? 
 That is truly amazing ! 
 How about 6:30 ? 
 Hi , Zhengjun , what make you so happy . 
 Oh , congratulations ! 
 Yes . I miss you very much . 
 Have you graduated from college ? 
 Has the train come yet ? 
 It ’ s so unreliable . I ’ Ve been late for my meetings all this week . 
 Yes , my customers have started to complain too ! 
 I've got some bad news about the bike you lent me . 
 I fell on the way to school , and your bike got scratched . I'm really sorry . 
 No , thank you . 
 It's kind of you to say . I feel a little stupid . 
 When you lent me the bike , it looked brand new , almost anyway . 
 I appreciate that , thank you . 
 Yes , I know . 
 At least I ’ m the one who rates with her . I ’ m glad we can still be friends . 
 Basketball , I'm a basketball fan . 
 Well , nothing special , reading , watching TV , walking , and so on . 
 No , I don't have any hobbies . How about you ? 
 Really ? How many collections do you have ? 
 Among those collections , which is the most expensive ? 
 It seems to me that everything is going digital nowadays . 
 Cool ! What brand 
 What about the quality ? 
 It's four o'clock already . I hate to leave , but I think I must . 
 I'm sorry , but I can't . 
 Sorry , they are too busy these days . 
 Yes , I think so . 
 You , too . 
 It's my favorite . 
 Yes , we're making plans for a tour . 
 Well start out from Long Island this Friday . We've planned a four day drive to Salt Lake City , where we'll join my brother and his family on his fortieth birthday . 
 Oh , we'll spend the nights in hotels and enjoy local food as we pass by . How does it sound , David ? 
 Yes , we'll take our time . And we'll go to Five-lake Strict and the Wall Street . 
 You can say that again . 
 Yes , would you arrange it for me the day after tomorrow ? 
 Six o'clock in the afternoon . 
 Six . 
 We don't care about money . We'd like to have some good dishes of local specialties . 
 How many courses are there altogether , please ? 
 Could you tell me some of entrees about the dinner ? 
 Very good . 
 Yeah . I saw a science program . It was quite interesting . 
 Mars . Scientists say there might be water on it . 
 I hope so . Did you know the US successfully sent two robotic explorers to Mars last month ? 
 Yes . Both have sent back pictures of the planet . And the latter did a better job . 
 I found the ideal position . I ’ m working for a plumbing company . 
 Plumbing work requires mathematics knowledge , and creativity . I love this job . 
 I didn ’ t , but I applied for an apprenticeship , and since I studied math , AND I have a good attitude , my application was accepted . 
 We are going to the concert this evening . Will you join us ? 
 Why not ? 
 Well , if it isn't the teacher's pet ! 
 You can't prove that by me . I saw the score on your report . 
 It just happened to be the highest grade in the class . 
 I worked hard too . But she always gives me a lower grade . 
 You won one million yuan in a lottery . What will you say ? 
 I understand . It's too good to be true , isn't it ? 
 I was supposed to meet with you at half past one . 
 There's a problem with my schedule . 
 Two of my classes occur at the same time . 
 Is it at all possible for you to fix that error ? 
 I want to keep both of them , if that's possible . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 That sounds like fun . 
 I think so . Why did you ask that ? 
 Congratulations ! Why do people hold parties before the baby is born ? 
 In any case , I like baby showers , because they allow friends and family to share the joy and excitement of welcoming a new life into the world . 
 Of course . I will prepare a good gift for the new arrival . 
 What are you doing ? 
 Mumm . no . 
 What ? 
 I have no idea what you ’ re talking about . The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl . 
 Sounds interesting , but soccer doesn ’ t really appeal to me . 
 All I know about soccer is that you can ’ t use your hands and that players are always falling down , trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . It seems like a sissy sport to me ! 
 We have absolute proof that you committed the crime . 
 Where can I get the information , Kate ? 
 Why ? 
 That was a tough question . How did you get it right ? 
 There ’ s a letter here for you . 
 What ’ s the letter about ? 
 Tell me what it says ! 
 You ’ re lying . 
 Are you upset ? 
 I ’ m sorry you didn ’ t get accepted . 
 The final examination will be held at the end of this month . Have you made good preparation ? 
 Are you sure you can do well this year ? 
 According to what you did last time , I have my doubts . 
 What ? How could you forget to reserve the concert tickets ? 
 How could you ? I reminded you just this morning . 
 I have been looking forward to this performance all month . 
 Did you hear what happened to Mike last night ? 
 Well , apparently he had too much to drink and got into some kind of trouble . Typical , isn't it ? 
 Well , I don't know the details , but ... 
 Are you serious ? Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! It disgusts me . 
 Well , to begin with , Gambling is addictive , ruins marriages , destroys families and bankrupts communities . Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . People have lost their houses , cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . Secondly , it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . Women gamble to escape , and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies . 
 You cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . Now excuse me , I have a protest rally to organize ! 
 Aren't you the pot calling the kettle black ? You're wearing my pants right now ! 
 Yes . I dare say it will be . 
 No . I don ’ t think that ’ s possible . Some places are sure to be open . 
 Mmm , you may be right . 
 No . We couldn ’ t possibly . 
 It will be summer . So it will be hot . 
 Yes . It could happen . 
 What did you have in mind ? 
 I just know I want to get out of the mindless gift trap . 
 I want to give a gift that is really meaningful . 
 Or what only we are able to give them . 
 That means they have tapered legs . 
 Mine are , too . 
 Yeah . Let's just lounge around ! 
 Of course not . If you're feeling bad and want to let your emotions out , you can just say whatever you want to me . 
 Uh , A ... you know I'm friends with William . 
 Mary is really a diligent girl . 
 She learns to speak Latin by osmosis within three months . 
 Hello , this is David . 
 Sure ! How about the coffee shop right across the street from my office ? 
 Does five thirty work for you ? 
 Is it the plans for my new house ? 
 I feel like going for a drink , it's been a long day . 
 How about the new bar across road ? 
 I agree , I had lunch there last week . 
 I have an idea for Christmas this year . 
 Let's not exchange any gifts at all . 
 Hear me out . We can pool the money and give it to a family who could really use it ! 
 Actual 1y , it was their idea first . 
 Do you know anything about Dr . Miller's classes ? 
 I'm thinking of taking his class next semester . 
 Yes , I really need someone who is really good . 
 Maybe , but I'm not sure . 
 No , that stuff isn't important to me . 
 I don't care about any of that . 
 Hey , Ben ... did you catch the game last night ? 
 Baltimore defeated Texas by 17 points ! 
 Football of course ! 
 No , I'm talking about American football . The World Cup is soccer . 
 So Chinese people prefer soccer or basketball ? 
 Oh , certainly . I wouldn't miss a game for the world . My girlfriend says I have an addiction . And actually , if I had to choose between her and my games ... I'd probably pick football . 
 Oh , yeah ! I think the love of sports starts when kids are very young . Americans come from many different backgrounds so I guess sports are something we can all enjoy together . 
 It says a storm may come tomorrow . 
 Me , too . I'm always in low spirits when it rains . Are you going out tomorrow ? 
 What bad luck ! 
 Yeah , maybe you are right ! 
 I don't care as long as it's a Chinese restaurant . 
 I really find Chinese dishes more to my taste . 
 Don't mention it . It's my pleasure . Have you been to one of these large , sit-down dinner parties since you got to New Haven ? 
 I'll bet you were a little embarrassed . 
 Cookouts often start slowly . A two o'clock start means you arrive any time after two . 
 I was late getting back from the mall , but I'm hurrying . 
 Don't worry . We won't be the first . 
 Yeah . He really does let me down . 
 I ’ m at the end of tether . I run out of ideas . 
 Why not send them short messages ? 
 Short messages will be kept in the short messages center . Once they open the handsets they will receive them , which is better than you can't find them . 
 I use short messages quite a lot . If it's not too complicated I will send a short message , which can save much phone charge . 
 I almost can't live without messages , from which I learn about weather forecasts and stock quotations . 
 What happened to you last night ? You didn ’ t show up . 
 I ’ m so sorry to hear that . 
 Fine , thank you . How are you doing this morning ? 
 Yes . I've been to New York . I got back only yesterday . 
 Very much . New York is such a nice place . Shall I show you some photographs ? 
 You too . I hope to see you soon . Goodbye . 
 My goodness ! What happened ? You have blood on your face . 
 How could you have the heart to kill it ? We only have one ! 
 How annoying ! 
 Every time I try to start this program , the computer freezes . 
 I heard that James was fired because he got a keep back of 20 thousands dollars from a vender . 
 But mine could be a lie for his job . 
 A little bird whispered to me . Keep that to yourself . 
 It must be Kate . 
 Hello ? 
 Hi Joe . 
 It's really cold . It snowed all day and the schools closed early . 
 It's 30 degrees now . It was even colder this morning . 
 I was watching the news a little earlier . They said it's probably going to snow tomorrow . 
 Me too . How's the weather where you are ? 
 Mike promised to help us . 
 Why not ? 
 Hello , Ann ! Is that you ? 
 It's been a long time ! What's new ? 
 Not bad I guess . I just got back from Hawaii . 
 I had a good time . You seem to be in a hurry . Don't let me hold you up . 
 Ok , I won't keep you then . 
 Yes , stay in touch . Bye ! 
 Sure ! It's txyb@gmail.com . 
 What is it ? 
 Really ? I can't believe it . It's like a dream come true . I never expected that I would win The Nobel Prize ! 
 Thanks for the compliment . 
 Tom ! How are you ? We missed you at the party last night . Are you OK ? 
 Come on . We ’ Ve been through this already ! Look , I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here , but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it . 
 Yeah , it can get pretty lonely over the holidays . When I first got here , I ’ d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home . I almost let it get to me , but then I started going out , keeping myself busy and before I knew it , I was used to to it . 
 OK . how does this sound , let ’ s get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight . I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there ! 
 Not at all ! It be fun ! It will be like a boys ’ night out ... well kinda ... 
 There was something wrong with the plane last Thursday . 
 Flight 198 . Fortunately , there were few passengers . 
 Well , all the passengers and crew members landed on their feet finally . 
 I'm going to New York to visit my sister . She is in art school . I've never been to New York before . I'm kind of scared . 
 Well , I know a lot of people have guns there . I think maybe it isn't too safe . 
 Yes , I'm not really scared . Maybe only a little . 
 I want to see the museums , and I want to shop a lot . 
 Hmm . I hope not . 
 I'm afraid I can't . Parking is not allowed here . 
 There is a square in front of us . We can park the car there . 
 I'm not sure , you know I'm not familiar with the city , too . 
 No problem . You know him . He ’ s the kind of guy that ’ s always willing to go the extra miles . 
 I bet he will come . 
 Pardon ? 
 University ? Why ? You asked me last year . 
 I went to Harvard University . 
 God save me ! Is there anything wrong with you ? Didn't I tell you ? 
 I did a B . A . in economics.Remember ? 
 Did you have a good weekend ? 
 Oh I see . So what did you do then ? 
 Ahh . And how about on Sunday ? Did you watch the football ? 
 What do you want for your birthday from your parents ? 
 Why don't you ask them to buy you a PC ? You will soon use it at college . 
 Your husband is very helpful , isn't he ? 
 Really ? 
 Doesn't she have any friends ? 
 Such friends are even worse than enemies . 
 Let me get last week's notes . 
 I couldn't come . 
 I wasn't feeling well . 
 Thanks a lot ; are these all the notes ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 I wonder if you agree that money is not happiness . 
 Then how do you explain so many rich people committing suicide ? 
 He has worked five years in that bank . 
 You said it.Let ' s ask him to work in our bank . 
 Did you pass the test ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . 
 It's a little like being a mom , only I get paid for it ! 
 That's exactly why my business is doing so well ! 
 Well , I've been in business for one month now and I have ten clients . 
 If you ever need a job , let me know . I can always train you . 
 Wow ! It's a trivia game all about the Academy Awards . 
 Does it have questions about foreign language films ? There's hardly any American films worth watching . 
 Hi , Mr . James , what ’ s the rush ? 
 I can lend you some money . 
 Can I help you in anyway ? 
 Sure . Let ’ s go . 
 She can cope with it . Don ’ t be such a wimp ! 
 Be careful of what you say , or you ’ ll have to eat humble pie . 
 I've got a complaint about the noise next door . 
 Some people aren't very considerate . 
 Yes , I think so . 
 We'll play the CD loud , is that all right ? 
 What should we do ? 
 Good idea . 
 Yes . Look , it is on my desk . 
 Not at all . It ’ s a piece of cake . 
 Yes . It ’ s easy and convenient to use a computer . But it takes a long time to really master it . 
 Really ? I was quite good at the hurdles and the discus . 
 I thought you were good at the high jump ! 
 Did you ever win any competitions ? 
 I came second and third a few times in the regional championships , but I never won . Did you ever take part in the national championship for the sprinting events ? 
 May I have an appointment with you tonight ? 
 OK . where and when ? 
 OK , I am going to the hotel to pick you up . See you tomorrow night . 
 I don ’ t think so . 
 The government will never fulfill their promise . 
 How do you feel about teaching my friend how to read ? 
 He's 78 and he's a new emigrant from South America and he's never been to school . 
 No . But I thought that you could start with reading and then go from there . 
 Come on . You're great at teaching and I know you will love him . He's adorable ! 
 I've just had an argument with Bob . 
 He did and it's his entire fault . 
 Hi , Stephanie . I hear you have a new job . 
 So how do you like it ? 
 Not bad . You know I'm an air traffic controller now . 
 Yes , but it's very stressful . 
 How did you know that ? I heart Tom ’ s father didn ’ t agree with that . 
 It ’ s great . Although his father didn ’ t agree with that , Tom went through with it . 
 I'm better now . Want to play again ? 
 Let's get all the balls out of the pockets . 
 You are crazy . Gambling is against my principles . 
 Okay . 
 Do you ? 
 They look all right to me . 
 All right . All right . 
 To be frank , I was married once , and now I'm single . 
 Yes , my first marriage was a failure . 
 I went a global warming rally in London . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment . 
 it might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening . 
 well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start . 
 if you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy . 
 yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center . 
 I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone . 
 to be honest , in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place , we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment . 
 But it's also a sort of exercise and it's good to your health . 
 You're complaining again . 
 On that day , boys are supposed to give roses to their sweethearts . 
 They give chocolate in return . 
 Yes I am . And you ... 
 So nice to meet you , David . Call me Bill . It's very nice of you to come here . 
 Hey , Ann . You don't have a pen , do you ? 
 Thanks . I don't suppose you have some paper , too . 
 Thanks so much . I owe you one . 
 Yes , of course . It was nice to see you . 
 Hey Mark . What are you doing ? 
 Anything interesting on ? 
 So I take it you're pretty bored too . 
 It's Saturday and we are sitting at home doing nothing . What's wrong with us ? 
 I already tried to call up some of the guys , but they are all busy . 
 She's out shopping with her friends . 
 Aright . Do you have any cigarettes ? 
 Ok . See you there in about 30 minutes . 
 Bob's sister will go to America . 
 I thought you wanted to know more about her . 
 hey , Tom , did you enjoy your lunch ? 
 what ' the matter ? 
 I see . You simply can't blame the server for this . 
 that's true . 
 it was good . I brough lunch from home today . 
 well , I personally don't like then because i don't believe they are healthy . 
 yes . I am wondering that you must believe fast food is your lifestyle , don't you ? 
 well , actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places . 
 yeah , it's hard to believe but true . 
 I like variety shows . 
 I prefer a variety show without a host . 
 It's my girlfriend . I guess she's playing the army game . 
 I saw her dating with her ex-boyfriend again . 
 Maybe . But it still gets on my nerves . 
 Yes , I did . I heard that they took both drivers to hospital . One needed surgery . 
 The second driver was luckier . He had a concussion and needed some stitches for his head wound . 
 I understand that he ’ s connected to a heart monitor and breathing apparatus . His condition can ’ t be very good . 
 It means he ’ s really badly injured , but he will almost certainly survive . 
 Happy New Year , Bill . 
 Do you have any plans for the New Year holiday ? 
 How happy you are ! I have to stay at home to prepare my final exam . 
 I don't know whether she has it bad for me , but she enjoys being with me . 
 I think I do . I don't think I can be happier with another girl . 
 That is a deadly risky business . He should have it coming on him . 
 I bet he is . He domed his own life . 
 He ’ s been on the gravy train these years , hasn ’ t he ? 
 It seems that nobody can always expect things to pan out well each time . 
 Whoops . That's my pager . I had to get it for work . 
 Well , I know how to turn it off ! 
 I want to meet you . Are you free this evening ? 
 No , I just want to meet you . 
 Hmm , that's all right . Shall we meet at the bar near the beach ? 
 Do you have any tissue , Eve ? I've used all mine . 
 Thanks . I am all right . It's just my nose . It must be an allergy . Do you have any aspirin ? I have a terrible headache . 
 No , no . I am okay . It's the weather . It was warm and sunny this morning and now it's chilly and raining . 
 I can't . I am already behind the schedule . Besides , you know Mr . White . He would think that I was putting him on . 
 Do I ? Oh , no . 
 What about Mr.White ? 
 Thanks a lot , Eve . Goodbye . 
 Well , I'm afraid your father's not interested in modern films . 
 That sounds fine . 
 You are pulling my legs ! 
 I'm going on a cruise this summer . 
 My brother won a free trip and he's taking me . 
 Where do you spend the weekend ? 
 That's nice . 
 That'd be great ! Thank you . 
 Good , thanks . How about you ? 
 Why ? 
 But your company is huge . Can't they afford to pay the staff decent wages ? 
 Why don't you give them a suggestion ? 
 Good morning , Linda . How have you been ? 
 I ’ m sorry to hear that . Is there anything else I can do ? 
 Well , I hope you ’ ll feel better soon . 
 Are you going to watch the Indy Five Hundred on TV this weekend ? 
 You were when we were in high school . That , and baseball . 
 True , but I still have to watch my baseball . The season's in full swing now . 
 Hello ? Is the real Taylor in there ? 
 I'm nervous as can be . 
 It looks like you have to buy tickets for us , Jason . And we're not going to see an action movie ! 
 I guess that's just the luck of the draw . 
 Sorry , not tonight ! 
 no , I can handle it . Thanks anyway . 
 well , maybe just a little . I can't seem to make it fit . 
 that's so true . thanks for your help . Are you in the aisle seat in this row ? 
 I'm in the middle seat . 
 thanks . sorry for making you get out of your seat again . 
 no , not at all . Which one would you like--the New York Times or the Guardian ? 
 I was just going to do a little Sudoku while we wait for the plane to take off , so the Guardian is all yours . 
 that would be great . thanks . 
 I'm with you , Jane . 
 Well , uh ... I didn't catch the last part . 
 Man , I ’ m freaking out ! You gotta help me ! 
 I can ’ t go through with this ! I just can ’ t ! I ’ m not ready for marriage ! What was I thinking ? I ’ m only thirty five years old ! I ’ Ve got my entire life ahead of me , adventures waiting ! I can ’ t settle down yet ! 
 I know . I know ! 
 You ’ re right . I ’ m being crazy ! Ok , I ’ m ready , let ’ s do this ! 
 Hi , why do you look so depressed today , Mike ? 
 How come ? 
 I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood . But why not take it easy ? 
 Who's that over here ? 
 What do you think of the teacher ? 
 What does she teach ? 
 Is she your teacher ? 
 Can she speak Chinese to her students ? 
 It's a good thing you can speak English ! 
 Are you kidding ? 
 Hi Steve . This is Mike . What are you doing ? 
 There's nothing to watch right now . 
 Me too . Let's get together and do something . 
 Yeah . Let's plan something tomorrow . 
 I think it is going to be the same as today . Clear and sunny . 
 Are there any special events going on tomorrow ? 
 Oh yeah . I heard about that too . Let's go check it out . 
 It starts at one PM . 
 Perfect . I'll see you in front of the apartment at eleven thirty . 
 It sounds a good idea . Let ’ s go . 
 Yes . I heard about that . And I know you want to buy it , but I ’ m not interested in detective novels . 
 Magazines about fashions , such as Cosmo Polian . 
 Yes . I can lend you some . 
 When can we expect you for dinner ? Can you come tonight ? 
 Well ... How about Friday then ? 
 Good . Shall we say seven o'clock ? 
 That'll be for you to decide . I've got a new dish that I want to try out on you . 
 I don ’ t understand why you always look so happy , so energetic . It seems like you ’ Ve got good news everyday . 
 All I know is you look quite differently from other teachers . 
 Oh , I know . I saw you doing pull-ups one time on the campus 5 and some students trying to imitate you . 
 It ’ s true . Many students do the exercise when they have to . We have P . E . once a week . 
 Of course . I didn ’ t know that . I only know exercise makes bodies stronger . I should take some exercise then . Do you have any suggestions ? 
 Oh , I know . Thank you . 
 Basketball , football , table tennis . I will watch them on TV . 
 Yeah , it is my favorite . Many Chinese people including women and children would like to concern the game . I think they want to see the performance of coming and YiJianLian , the Chinese players in NBA . 
 I am good at tennis and skiing . What about you ? 
 Moderate exercise is really important for health . ' Life lies in movement . ' 
 Good idea . I will take the racket . 
 Fine , just fine.Thanks . 
 Well , as a matter of fact , I've got a lunch date with Bob Thomas . 
 Of course . Are you a new member here ? 
 Welcome . My name is Johnson . 
 Do you have any experience using weights ? 
 Well , first it is important to go through a good stretch.You must warm up properly so that you don't hurt yourself on the machines . 
 Alright . Great . Then we must get a card for you . 
 No . Not that . I mean a training card.The card allows you to keep track of how much weight you use on each machine.Here , let me show you . 
 Now , you can see that on this card there are all the machines listed.So , when you go through the series of twelve machines , you enter in the number of repetitions you do.And you also enter in the weight at which you set the machine . 
 Yes . And it also reminds you what is a suitable weight for each machine.Today , I will go through the machines with you one by one . I will show you how to use them.And we will determine what is a good starting weight for you . 
 So you write your name and member number at the top of the card.And then , after you exercise each time , you file the card here . 
 Are you alright ? Can you do more ? 
 That's okay . Don't worry.It ' s important not to push yourself . Especially not at the beginning . 
 We can just go through them next time . It's no problem . Really.The most important thing is to know your limits.So if you feel burned out now , it is good to stop.Because if you strain a muscle or hurt your back , then you won't be able to exercise for a couple weeks . Right ? 
 Don't be afraid . Give it a try . 
 what are you doing ? 
 you really like brains that make you think , don't you ? 
 I guess the games I like the most are the ones that I'm good at ! 
 Well , I like to play darts . Whenever I go to a bar , I usually play for a few hours . 
 My parents used to love to play checkers and dominoes . We used to have family tournaments every weekend . 
 Not at all . I never really did , to be honest . What about you ? Did your family used to play games together ? 
 Some of my friends play cards on the internet . Have you ever tried that ? 
 How about mah-jong ? 
 I thought everyone in your country were experts at mah-jong ! 
 I didn't like my brother's batting around without doing anything useful . 
 I hope so . 
 It's inevitable . Their love wasbuilt on the sand , and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks . 
 That give us a good lesson . 
 I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . But I don ’ t like traveling to work , waiting for buses , or ... 
 Exactly . 
 Really ? I remember she said if she would remain single . Is the man very rich ? 
 You means she didn ’ t marry a rich man . 
 I thought she would marry a fortune . 
 I grow a variety of things , so that something is in bloom all year round . 
 It looks best in spring , when the plum and cherry blossoms are out . 
 Good afternoon ! Sit down , please.How are you ? 
 Very well too , thank you very much.Isn ' t it a lovely day ? 
 Yes . 
 Mm ... It's quite warm now . 
 In London.Where do you live ? 
 Oh , no ! Now I'll be late . 
 Yes , I'd appreciate it if you could drive me downtown . 
 What a great weekend that was ! 
 I really enjoy the beach in the summer . 
 We should come here more often . 
 I'd like to come back next weekend . 
 What's this , I wonder ? 
 A coffee grinder ? 
 Oh , that would be very useful . 
 Oh ? You hoped to get that job , didn't you ? 
 I'm sorry . That's too bad . Who is it ? Who got the job , I mean ? 
 Hmm . Why do you think they gave it to him and not to you ? 
 You mean you didn't get the job because you're a woman ? 
 What sort of clothes does he wear ? 
 Perhaps that had something to do with it . 
 It's possible , isn't it ? 
 Well . . . perhaps you should think about it . 
 I'm not saying you should . I'm saying you should think about it . That's all ! 
 Hmm . Perhaps it should be the only important thing . But it isn't . Not in this company . 
 Yes , it is . I'm Jennifer . Nice to meet you . 
 Are you American ? 
 I come from America . Are you a freshman ? 
 Me , too . 
 Yeah . Anytime . 
 I don't know why , but I think there's something wrong with my hands . I couldn't seem to be able to control it on the first ball . 
 Then why couldn't I get strike on the first ball ? 
 Really ? I will try again . 
 Bob ! I hear your team won the match . 
 Congratulations ! 
 Are you free on the thirteenth in the afternoon ? 
 I'm sorry . I'm attending a meeting at the Hilton then . 
 No . I'm busy then too . I'm meeting Dorothy Heath at North Bridge Road . Are you free on Thursday afternoon ? 
 Good idea ! Is two o'clock okay ? 
 Did you enjoy the movie ? 
 Sorry to hear that . I think it's even better than On the Golden pond . 
 Hi Jackie . You don't look too well . What's going on ? 
 Why ? What's stressing you out ? 
 The best thing to do is study as much as you can . I'm sure you'll do alright . 
 I have to study for an exam too . Why don't we study together . We can encourage each other . 
 The new webpage design is much more effective than before . I feel confident it will rope in a lot more business because of its user-friendly format . 
 The old page was okay , alright , but there wasn't a big influence in our sales volume , because the site wasn't developed with an eye towards the marketing aspect . Now it's different . We got our marketing department team in on the action , and the results are smashing ... 
 First , the visitors to the site are encouraged to give their contact information . They can sign up for a free monthly drawing . Once we've got their info , it goes into a database for future marketing mailers and advertising targeting . Also , there are clear links to descriptions of our products and services , so as to give confidence to new customers . We also added a specific area for on-line customer service ... So far we've gotten a ton of positive feedback ... 
 Did you know that drinking beer helps you sing better ? 
 Well , usually people think I'm a terrible singer , but after we all have a few beers , they say I sound a lot better ! 
 Pardon me . Could you please pass me the tissue ? 
 Thanks , I didn't expect the dish to be so spicy . Are you ok ? 
 Well , not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Guizhou provinces can . Back where I come from , people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies . 
 Yeah , you can increase you tolerance for spicy food , but so far , I haven't had the need or the opportunity . Every time I try spicy food , it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes . 
 Yeah , I guess that's a typical example of ' when in Rome , do as the Romans do . ' 
 Tom , Christmas Day is coming . Merry Christmas to you . 
 Could you lend your bike to me for several days ? 
 Till the end of the week . 
 Don't you feel a little strange taking the place of your old boss after he was demoted ? 
 Did they mutiny ? 
 It is a really good chance for you to get more exposure at work . supervisors get to take the credit for all the hard work of the people under them . 
 How about a game of tennis ? 
 It's a deal . 
 Are you feeling better today , Bill ? 
 You'd better give up smoking . It's bad for your health . 
 But you should make up your mind first . 
 Why don't you go to bed and get up early ? You'll have the same time for work . 
 Hi , John , how was your vacation ? 
 That must have been wonderful . Do anything interesting ? 
 Wow ! Isn ’ t that dangerous ? 
 Tell me about it . 
 500 feet ! I would never be able to do that . 
 What did her boss say to you ? 
 Yeah . You look so unhappy recently . What ’ s the matter . 
 Hi , Tina , it's Joe . 
 What's the weather like there today ? 
 What's the temperature ? 
 Have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow ? 
 I really don't like the winter . I wish it were summer . 
 It's not too bad , but it's pretty cold here too . I heard it's going to be a little warmer tomorrow . 
 Sure , let ’ s take a look . Sweetie , this is terrific . Your ideas are so original . 
 I can tell you worked hard on it . 
 Well , it was definitely worth all the time . 
 How about doing shopping this weekend ? 
 Sportshoes.Will you go with me ? 
 Merry Christmas ! 
 I said Merry Christmas ! Don't you know that Christmas is almost here ? 
 Huh ? Didn't you know ? Aren't you excited ? 
 Forgotten about it ? How could you ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry . I didn't know . 
 I guess so . So what do you do around this time of year ? 
 Well , would you be horribly offended if I invited you to a Christmas party at my house ? 
 It's all over . I'm bankrupt . 
 Bill , Happy Halloween ! 
 I will dress up as a vampire with big fangs . 
 Sure . Wait a moment . ( Several minutes later ) Here you are . 
 I will bite many beautiful girls on the neck tonight . Maybe I will suck their blood . 
 I think that ’ s settled . 
 How dare you speak to me like this . 
 Hey , Karen . Look like you got some sun this weekend . 
 That ’ s great . Where did you stay ? 
 So , what did you do out there ? I mean besides bask in the sun , obviously . 
 Not to mention cooler . Did you go swimming ? 
 It all sounds so relaxing . I wish I could get away to the beach like that . 
 OK class , so today we are going to continue with our anatomy class , today we will review everything we have learned . Can anyone tell me what the first major organ is ? 
 That's right , the brain ! It serves as a control center for the body , handling the processes of the central nervous system as well as cognition . Then what major organ is in our chest ? 
 Very good ! It pumps blood throughout the body , using the circulatory system such as blood vessels and veins . Now let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive ! Now what about the organs that help us digest food ? 
 Very good ! Let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food and our intestines process that food and then expel the waste . Are we forgetting anything ? 
 Oh yes , you are right . Very important organs indeed . 
 Well , mumm , they ... Time for a break ! We can talk about it when you get back . 
 Not good for business ? I don't see eye to eye with you.The new policy offers new opportunities . 
 Do you know how to play go ? 
 But I heard it is very difficult to play . 
 Linda ? Is that you ? I haven't seen you in ages ! 
 What have you been up to ? 
 Good for you ! What are you doing ? 
 I knew some day I would be able to profit from your love of fun ! 
 So , what ’ s new in the kitchen ? That refrigerator is new , isn ’ t it ? 
 That ’ s usual nowadays . You ’ Ve added a few shelves too . 
 Did you buy new cupboards too ? 
 I see that you have bought several new pots and pans and utensils . 
 Looking at the spice rack , I ’ d say you ’ Ve been learning how to make asian food . 
 Both kinds of food are becoming popular.Nowadays , it ’ s very easy to pick up the ingredients at the supermarket . 
 How do you like skiing , Pat ? 
 I suppose skiing is easy for you . 
 I see . Do you ski often ? 
 That sounds great . 
 Not on your life ! I know I'd break my leg 
 Hi , Dave . This is Zina . 
 I got your e-mail a couple of months back . 
 The one that said , You're a creep . From me you won't hear another peep . I hope you wreck your jeep . 
 Hello , my name is Bill Martin and we have a reservation for party tonight . 
 I need to cancel that . We have had a last minute change of plans . 
 OK , we will let you know as early as possible . By the way , will we be able to get a refund on this cancellation ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Good-bye . 
 Sure , go ahead . 
 Yes , it is . You want go online ? there are no wi-fi hotspots around . 
 Can't you wait till you get home ? then you can surf the internet using the broadband , wireless connection or whatever you like . 
 Now I see , you must be suffering from discomgoogolation . 
 Well , the term ' discomgoogolation ' comes from ' discombobulate ' and ' google ' . Because floods of information are just a mouse click away , net users are very likely to become addicted to the web . 
 Then , you're probably addicted . 
 I ’ m sure you do miss that type of cooking . But can ’ t you try to get used to Western food ? 
 I suppose you ’ re right , Lee . Maybe that ’ s why so many Westerners are overweight . 
 You see , because we are often busy working , we eat too much fast food , and that food is very fattening . 
 Ok , on that day , boys usually give roses to the sweet hearts and girls give them chocolate to return . 
 Yeah , that is the holiday is hot , isn't it ? 
 That's a relief for me and a misery for the children . 
 It's too late . 
 Yeah , I've been there twice . 
 Oh , it's fantastic . 
 On my first trip I went to Tokyo , and on my second trip I visited Kyoto . 
 Very big and exciting , but very crowded , too . 
 And the restaurant are excellent ... but they're kind of expensive . 
 Kyoto is lovely . It's full of beautiful old temples and gardens.It ' s a very historic city . 
 I was in Tokyo in August , and it was really hot and humid . I went to Kyoto in October.It was hot and sunny , but there was no humidity . 
 Where do you live now ? 
 Which street do you live on ? 
 Who did the stupid thing ? 
 I don't think so . Dick has been on the ball and never does things like that . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Just a second . I'll see if I can find them for you . 
 Here you are . You must return them within a month . 
 You can come in and renew them unless someone else has reserved them . 
 No trouble at all . So long . 
 Sure , I love curry . Who else is coming ? 
 I have no plans for Friday , so curry would be great . Which restaurant do you have in mind ? 
 Which one is that ? 
 Oh yes , I know which one you mean . I have never been there , but I looked at their menu once and it did look good . 
 What time ? 
 That's good . See you on Friday . 
 No , I was way too busy studying all the time . How about you ? 
 What was that like ? 
 What did you do ? 
 Did you get any perks on the job ? 
 Did you like the play ? 
 You're absolutely right . The acting could be better . 
 I need some books on hardware . 
 Great ! They're the very books I want.May I borrow two books ? 
 I see.Thank you . 
 What is the matter ? 
 That is to say , love is blind . 
 I'm getting sick of work man . I can't take the political bull in the company any more . 
 Yeah , but that's not why I am upset . I just found out another guy got a promotion . He doesn't know how to do anything . He sits there and kisses the managers butt all day long . 
 I'm just pissed that management can't see behind his smooth talking lies . 
 Yeah . I shouldn't stress about this anymore . It's not like I can do anything about it . 
 How about a cold bottle of beer . 
 You're so witty ... 
 This watch is supposed to be worn on your left hand . 
 It's better for right-handed people like me . See , I don't even have to move my arm to see the time . 
 Bingo ! 
 I am sorry , sir.All the tickets have been sold out . 
 Sorry , sir . The only tickets of the same performance available are on 21st . 
 Does Tom drink a lot ? 
 That's a problem . He has sort of Dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything . 
 Yes , we do . 
 It's 3 nights a week , Monday , Tuesday and Thursday . 
 It lasts for 9 months . 
 The next beginning class starts on October 25th . 
 From 7 to 9 o'clock . 
 It costs 125 dollars a month . 
 Thank you , please fill out this form for us . 
 Yes , please . We need a record of you education and your work experiences . 
 Seventy-six , I think . 
 Pretty busy . I have to pick up a lot of credits this year . 
 I ’ m majoring in French literature . 
 That ’ s right . We got the assignment last week . 
 Next Monday ! 
 Okay , next question . If Eric asked you out on a date , what would you say ? 
 Let ’ s see ... If I won the lottery , I would buy two tickets for a trip around the world . 
 My dad will freak out if I even mention a trip like that ! 
 If I told her that , she would faint and have me committed ! 
 Yes . My car is having problems . 
 It won't start . 
 No , thank you . I think I can handle it . 
 I will . Thanks . That's sweet of you . 
 I might need some tools though . Do you know where I can get some ? 
 Thanks . That would be very helpful . 
 OK . If you really insist , I could always use the company . 
 I'm terribly sorry I'm late . I just couldn't help it . 
 Look , just give me a chance . I can explain it . 
 I suppose I do . 
 They use said it 
 It sure is 
 Well , if you live in other as long enough you love them just as much . 
 That's for sure . 
 Yeah , I know . 
 Alice , your father is amazing . He ’ s 90 years old and he lives alone in that big house . 
 That sounds like my Grandmother . She was always stubbornly independent . 
 They see their independence as a kind of character strength . 
 How are you making out ? 
 I hope so . Thank you again for your delightful gift . 
 Happy Birthday , Mary ! 
 Here is a gift for you . I hope you like it . 
 I had my own ways of finding out . It's a secret . You look so beautiful today . Your new shirt goes well with your skirt . 
 Really ? It looks so nice . 
 All right . 
 No , thanks . I've had enough . Now , Mary , before you blow out the birthday candles , you have to make a wish . After that , you may cut the cake . 
 No , just a small one . Next let's sing ' Happy Birthday ' to Mary . 
 How did you meet your girlfriend ? 
 That's great . Did you start dating right after you met , or did you become friends first ? 
 Is there anything available for tonight ? 
 Isn't there anything else available ? 
 I haven't seen your father in like 5 years . How is he doing ? 
 Why ? What's wrong ? 
 Is it due to old age or is he sick . 
 That makes sense . It's important to take care of your health early in life . 
 Well , I hope he starts feeling better . Say hi to him for me . 
 Wedding rings ! 
 Aren't they cool ? I like the settings . 
 No . I just like looking at wedding rings , OK ? 
 These are specially designed for the year 2000 ! 
 I ’ m in , let ’ s go ! 
 Geez ! What ’ s the rush ? 
 Are you nuts ! I ’ m not going to run a red light ! 
 What ’ s your problem ! Geez . Having a fit is not going to help ! 
 I ’ m going as fast as I can ! 
 You ’ re such a geek ! 
 Not everyone thinks Japan is beautiful , but to me its beauty is breathtaking.You feel the same way about France , don't you ? 
 Well , it's made up of four large islands and many smaller islands located off the coast of the Asian main lands . France isn't an island , is it ? 
 Good harbors ! Yokohama is one of the most famous port cities in the world , and Japan is the largest shipbuilding nation in the world . Also , there are long mountain ranges in the southern is hands . France isn't very mountainous , is it ? 
 The Japanese climate is warm and moist in the south , mild in the central part and cold in the north . Except for Hokkaido , we don't get much snowfall at all . France has a mild climate , doesn't it ? 
 Yes , Japan is good for farming . Rice is the main crop , but Japan is also an industrial center . Fishing is very important , too . Rice isn't grown in France , is it ? 
 Yes . I'd like to visit France . I'd like to travel all over the world . As you describe it , France seems to be very much like Japan . I would like to see it for myself . 
 He is sly . He is actually angling for compliments . But he may have got the crush on you . 
 Keep your fingers crossed . He may pop the question one of these days . 
 I had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday . 
 It is a long story . Basically , she thought I had laughed at her while I didn't . 
 Yeah . It's so nice of you to comfort me . 
 It's still early . 
 Since we're late , let's go to see a film . 
 My uncle passed away last night . 
 Diana , in your opinion , which is more important , IQ or EQ ? 
 I watched the movie Forrest Gump last night . And the question just lined in my mind . 
 Why ? You seem pretty sure about it . 
 But IQ is decided at birth.One can't expect to make a lot of improvement in it . 
 That ' s true , but what if one comes across some difficulties . He must rely on his EQ to deal with them . 
 I think it is independent of IQ and plays a prominent role in deciding the way we live our lives . 
 Just as Forrest ? 
 I got it . 
 Wait a minute ! Just hold your horses ! What's your hurry , anyway ? 
 That won't take long . 
 Well , I'm not quite ready . 
 You wouldn't do a thing like that ! 
 How's business ? 
 Wow , that terrible movie is finally over . Next time I ’ m picking the film , because I don ’ t want to end up seeing a chick flick . 
 Not everything , just this film . Even the title is ridiculous . and it ’ s so long , those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life , so much so that I ’ m thinking about asking them to give me my money back . 
 I ’ m only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage . 
 Next time , go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings . 
 Love stories ? More like one-night-stands . 
 My friends ? Fat ? What about those whales you call friends ? 
 Which language do you speak ? 
 Yes , I do . I ’ m learning Chinese now on the internet . 
 It ’ s not easy , particularly with listening and speaking , because sometimes the connection isn ’ t too good . 
 Actually , many of the characters are the same or very similar in both Chinese and Japanese , so they ’ re easy for me . 
 Yes . How are the Spanish classes going ? 
 Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? 
 But you should tell me you were in love with her . 
 You know you didn't . 
 Yes , but you might have told me before . 
 You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ? 
 Oh , you men ! You are all the same . 
 Yeah . We went to a movie last Saturday . We saw Police Partners II . 
 Richard did , but I didn't . Of course , I told him I liked it . 
 Well , we went to a dance club . 
 Yeah , we had a great time . And we're going to go there again next week ! 
 I think I will continue my studies . Now it's not easy for a graduate with bachelor's degree to get a job since there are so many graduates with master's or doctor's degree . We are likely to lose in competing with them in the job market . 
 Well , I think so . But I am thinking of going aboard to get a master's and doctor's degree . If can get a Ph . D . abroad , it will be much easy for me to get a job at home . 
 I think I will try to get the scholarship since I really don't have so much money to study abroad . Actually now I am preparing for the TEFL and GRE exams . If I can get high marks in the two exams and if I am lucky enough , I may get a scholarship . 
 It's hard to get tickets for the movie . 
 Yeah , two at the tenth rows . 
 3.5 dollars each . 
 My feeling's exactly . 
 I couldn't agree with you more . 
 You are absolutely right . 
 I think Andy's party will be fun . 
 What's that ? 
 Sure . Oh , that reminds me . Could I borrow your black leather boots ? 
 Hi , Mr . Smith . Are you enjoying the cookout ? You don't look too happy . 
 Is that what people usually do on Memorial Day ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . Thank you for telling me a little more about it . 
 Really ? Their songs are very popular all round Asia now . I am also a big fan of theirs . 
 I really love their dancing . They are all excellent dancers . 
 Sure . I think you can hear the song everywhere you go now . 
 Why not ? 
 If you would like me to , I could help you with that . 
 I have plenty of time to do this . I promise you it won't be a problem for me . 
 If we work on this tomorrow night , you could easily be ready by Friday . 
 That would work out well . Bring any concerns that you might have . 
 Don't worry . Everything will go well . I promise ! 
 Why ? Did tom pop the question ? 
 Let me guess , your parents want you to marry a Chinese man , right ? 
 I used to have the same problem when I was with my ex . 
 I just let it go and continued dating with my Korean boyfriend . But finally we broke up . 
 Simple . We had personality clashes and there were too many cultural differences . 
 He hoped to live in the Korean way and asked me to give up working and stay at home to take care of the family . 
 Yes , he said it would be better for me and for the whole family . But I simply can not quit working . 
 Not really . There are many successful mixed marriage around us . 
 He is in the bedroom and fallen asleep . 
 He ran four miles and came back dead beat . 
 Hi , Ann . 
 I just heard that our school will hold a singing contest in 5 days . 
 Of course . This is a great chance for me to show off my beautiful voice . 
 I heard that the winner gets a Panda Radio . 
 A chance ? Not just a chance , I'm a hundred percent certain.Everyone says my voice is beautiful . 
 I still have 5 days to practise . It's in the bag ! 
 Yeah , maybe . 
 OK . Good night , then . Have a good sleep . 
 I wonder if it is possible that we organize a dinner party for all the colleagues in our departments . They are working very hard these days . Maybe it is time for everybody to relax a little . 
 Well , what about this Thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ? 
 I hope so . Let me know how many will come . Then I will book the restaurant . 
 Today is Thursday . 
 Today is May first , 2003 . 
 Well , I don't think so . 
 That would be fine . Where are you going ? 
 Great . 
 Ok . I like fishing very much . 
 The same question to you . 
 Deal , Where is Gucci ? 
 Oh , look at her . She looks like one is the basketball babies in NBA . 
 Get real . Don't be so pathetic . 
 Oh , man , look at her , go ! She is amazing ! She should be my sis . 
 Yes , I want to be her boyfriend . Just like in the movie . 
 She told me she liked my new haircut . She thought it was cool . 
 You know John ? 
 Yes . I ’ Ve read news about him in today ’ s paper . 
 I wish he could too . 
 He ’ s a bit tired , you know . It often takes him a couple of hours to brush up . 
 Good luck to them . 
 No , thanks . I have had enough . 
 Please bring me a cup of coffee . 
 Give me 10 yuan , your ID card and a photo of you please . 
 Yes , it is . But you must pay a deposit for the card . 
 Yes , if the card is well kept and has no dirt and scratches . 
 I am very proud of John . 
 But he has suffered a lot . 
 Perhaps they should give it a second thought . The residents are getting up in arms about it . 
 What do you think of that situation comedies showed every weekend ? 
 You're becoming a real television watcher . 
 May I invite you for a dance ? 
 You dance well . Do you breakdance ? 
 There's a story about breakdancing in the paper . 
 According to the story , it's some sort of modern dance style . 
 Well , breakdancing is more a physical exercise than a dance . 
 Right , a disco is a place where people dance according to nonstop recorded music ... 
 You are witty . 
 That would be a possibility . Where is this fundraiser taking place ? 
 Do you need it for the whole weekend ? 
 We will need to know who will be driving the van . 
 It needs to be back on Sunday night . Can you arrange for that ? 
 Just keep track of everything and get it all back where you took it from by Sunday evening . 
 I don't know . Who ? 
 the Canadian rock singer ? But I heard you had a part-time job yesterday . How did you see her ? 
 so you're a big fan , eh ? 
 and she was in a movie once again , right ? 
 what was your impression of her when you saw her in person ? 
 did you take a photo with her ? 
 crazy ! 
 What ? Again ? Why do you keep running out of money ? 
 No , I think it's how you budget your life , that's the problem . 
 True enough , until the time comes that you need to take my money . I don't know where you're wasting your money but I think you need to take a look at what's really important . 
 I don't just survive . I put money away as well . I know when I get paid where most of the cash will go , and I stick to my plan . If I follow a budget I don't have any nasty surprises . 
 In a few months I'm planning to invest my money into some foreign companies . I think you need to reevaluate your spending habits . 
 I think that the public transport system could be made simpler . I never know where the bus routes actually go . The routes seem to twist and turn rather than going roughly in a straight line . 
 If we built more roads , people would just fill them with cars again . I think we should discourage people from using their cars . 
 I think we should do a few things at once . Improving public transport would encourage people to use that . If we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre , they won ’ t use their cars as much . 
 I think that they should pay more tax . Look at the damage they cause to the environment and people ’ s health by discharging all those exhaust fumes . 
 That ’ s a good point . Car owners will probably be against it , but people who use public transport will be in favor of it . 
 Today is December twenty-third , two thousand and two . 
 Merry Christmas to you . 
 Yes , I am . 
 No , I transferred here . 
 I transferred from PCC . 
 I wanted to attend this school originally , but my grades out of high school weren ’ t good enough . 
 PCC is great ! 
 Thank you very much . 
 On this occasion , most people do . 
 She is a beautiful bride . 
 Are you crying ? 
 Harris and Anne are perfect for each other . 
 You and Tom also make a great couple . 
 For the wedding ? 
 Try to catch this bouquet then . 
 is that the girl you spent almost every weekend with ? 
 I am not good at picking gifts . Maybe you can ask if there's anything she needs to make it easier ? 
 yeah , that's nice . 
 a plant ? That's creative . I'm sure ever time she waters it she'll think of you . But there is a problem . Do you think it'll be able to go through the customs ? 
 I don't know . I think the idea of a plant going across borders with a friend is really exciting but maybe seeds would be safer . You don't want to get her in trouble . 
 My invitation ? No , I haven't . My invitation to what ? 
 Whose house warming party is it ? 
 Oh , they have ? I didn't know . I haven't seen Tom lately . 
 Have you seen the house ? 
 Is it nice ? 
 Well , that does sound nice . Have they moved in yet ? 
 When are they going to have the party ? 
 Wow , that would be something to look forward to . 
 Yes , I ’ Ve been there several times on business trips . But I have never really seen the terra-cotta warriors as it is outside the city . 
 I agree . As long as the food is not too bizarre once I saw some people eating insects . That is frightening . 
 Well , the airport is quite far from the downtown area , but it is still more convenient than taking the train . 
 I know there is a beautiful farm in the countryside near Taipei . Are you interested in going there ? 
 You can see many cows and horses there . lf you are brave enough , you can try horseback riding . it is fun . 
 Wow ! It is huge and you can do many activities here . 
 I never knew there were so many fun things to do on a farm . 
 I think we need to buy some baits and borrow some fish poles first . 
 Of course . I will . 
 It is . However , you will suffer from muscle pain for many days you are a first-time rider . 
 how are you doing ? 
 what happened to him ? 
 was it his first offence ? 
 what happened to him then ? 
 did they take his license away ? 
 what do you think will happen to him ? 
 that doesn't sound too promising . Does he have a defence lawyer ? 
 my sister is a lawyer . I can ask her if she can help him . 
 Well , sir , we are asking all our guests to wear a jacket and a tie in our restaurant . 
 I'm sorry you can't borrow a jacket and a tie . 
 Certainly.What time will you come back ? 
 How many in your party ? 
 All right.We are waiting for you at seven . 
 Yes , we do . I think we have the same musical tastes . 
 I'm not a very good singer , but I'm a really great dancer ! I love hip hop dancing . 
 I wish I had access to the public library . 
 Are you ready ? 
 Is this your brother-in-law ? 
 From his looks , I'd say he's a man of character . 
 You seem to very busy these days . What are you doing ? 
 Where did you spend your holiday ? 
 Our team just scored a goal . 
 Tell me about it . 
 Want to meet for lunch this Saturday ? 
 What are you doing ? 
 What kind of volunteer work ? 
 Oh , yeah ? 
 Tom , is Jenny crying ? 
 I ’ m just coming for that . 
 She ’ s your sister.What she asked was only duck soup for you.Why can ’ t you be good to her ? 
 You ’ re making my blood boil . 
 I'm about to explode ! You ’ Ve made a mess of this matter . 
 Sorry isn ’ t good enough ! What can you do to help me ? 
 Well , obviously , what you ’ re doing is not good enough ! 
 Can you tell me something about financial aid ? 
 How to apply for it ? 
 Then ... 
 What if not ? 
 How was Mei ’ s party on Saturday ? 
 Oh really ? What did you do ? 
 I see . Anything else ? 
 Well , it sounds like you really enjoyed yourself . 
 It's about 5 degrees centigrade . 
 The weatherman says it's going to snow tomorrow . 
 I think I'll soon get used to it . 
 lt's about 180C , but in winter the temperature may fall to 10-15 degrees below zero . And we have a long winter . 
 I prefer spring when little by little everything becomes green and the weather is almost always nice . 
 But Ben is not a bad man . I know him from A to Z . 
 I can understand that . But ... 
 Me ? Why me ? Why not you ? 
 And you think I fit the qualifications ? 
 Really ? What is there to do after we graduate ? 
 I'm honored that you think I would be qualified . But I would really have to think about this first . 
 I knew there would be a shower , but I didn't realize it would rain cats and dogs today . 
 I know . I don't want to get sick , especially during finals week . 
 They must have just come back from tomb sweeping because today is Tomb Sweeping Day . 
 Tomb Sweeping Day is a traditional festival in China , on which many Chinese mourn the dead . 
 People go to the cemetery to pay their respects to the dead . 
 Ohm , hello , Marcia . I was ... 
 Well ... thanks , Marcia.It ' s very nice of you to say so . I mean ... 
 Do you really think so ? I mean , was I ? Er ... you ... must be disappointed . 
 I called in sick . 
 It's a huge headache . I have no idea what I want to do . 
 It should be , but there are too many options . My grades are good enough that I have a lot of choices , but after that ... 
 Yup , you understand . And my parents are trying to pressure me into going to a Catholic college . They both attended one and think that it combines a good education with good discipline . And the tuition 3 is usually pretty low . 
 Thanks for the information . And good luck in your college search . 
 Are you thinking about a public school or a private one ? 
 Public schools are usually state funded , whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere . 
 One isn ’ t necessarily better than the other . It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers . 
 Yeah , sometimes . 
 Is this something that you could schedule for another time ? 
 Have you arranged for someone to take notes for you ? 
 You know that I only allow one absence per semester , don't you ? 
 Write down your name and the date on a piece of paper and give it to me . 
 Well , have a good day off from class . 
 Ashes to ashes and dust to dust ... 
 I'll tell you all about it another day . 
 You ladies look very elegant in black . But I don't want you to wear black in my honor for a long time yet to come ... 
 Exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment . 
 As much as I love this city , I think I'm going to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health . 
 What is the greenhouse effect exactly ? 
 I see , so it's similar to global warming ? 
 I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live . 
 People always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations . 
 What would you like to do tonight ? 
 What about going to a movie ? 
 Mary , be calm . 
 No , listen to me . I always regard you as my best friend . I admire you , and of course you've helped me so much . I should thank you . 
 No , listen to me . Perhaps it's my fault that I treat everybody so well . Maybe in other people's eyes , I want you to be my girl-friend . but ... but ... 
 OK ... OK ... Anyway . I will treat you as my best friend . I hope you can do the same . 
 Would you mind doing something for me ? 
 Would you please explain the meaning of the word ? 
 Our maths teacher is rather humorous . 
 No , not at all.His examples are really interesting . 
 Yeah , how about your maths teacher ? 
 Bad luck , Anne . 
 She's another antique . 
 Hey , if you're not busy this weekend , would you like to go see a movie ? 
 How about that European movie ? 
 Yeah , that's the one I've heard the special effects and the plot are outstanding . 
 Okay , see you then . 
 What is it ? 
 All right . 
 No problem . I'd be happy to . 
 I have an appointment for half past one . 
 Well , I have a problem with my class schedule . 
 It seems that I've been given two classes scheduled at the same time . 
 Is there any way that you can fix my schedule ? 
 Yes , I do . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Are you sure of that ? 
 They may have some difficulty in doing it . 
 So I hear . 
 After all the crises they have survived together , her husband should do such things . She must feel that she ’ s been stabbed in the back . 
 The headlines are all about the presidential election in the united states . Few other stories made the front pages . 
 There ’ s an interesting feature article in the chronicle about doing business in china and the daily news has printed a report about the special economic zone near pairs . We have a subsidiary company l 
 Generally , the reporters take positive lines . They do point out a few problems that we need to be aware of , but there ’ s nothing worrying in the reports . In the classifieds , one of our competitors is a 
 Not really . They all seem to focus on the election . There have been several letters printed in the chronicle regarding that controversial article on drugs that they printed last week . 
 Sure . There you are . 
 That would be terrible . 
 Oh , how were you saved finally ? 
 I am looking for some information about home stay . 
 How did you pay them ? 
 He followed me all the way home ! 
 Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ? 
 Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me ! 
 I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is . 
 Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile . 
 It's Gone With the Wind . 
 I enjoy the various characters and the plot . 
 Is it very interesting ? 
 If I have a chance , I'll enjoy the book . 
 That's a good idea . Let's go ! 
 I would like to check out these books . 
 Yes . Here you go . 
 I do ? 
 Exactly how much do I owe ? 
 I won ’ t be able to pay that right now . 
 I will pay it . Don ’ t worry . 
 That's a very good question . Choosing proper courses and effectively planning a college schedule is very important to the progress toward your educational goal . In order to do these wisely and effectively , you should consult with a Program Adviser or Academic Counselor . 
 Ok , I will go into more detail . A Program Adviser or an Academic Counselor is usually an experienced professor who is responsible for all the necessary academic counseling through graduation . You can discuss with him the program selection , changing or adding a program , the requirements for graduation , and other problems related to your study . You will choose some courses , and then discuss with the adviser whether your choice can meet the requirements for graduation . 
 Sure , very difficult . 
 It's my pleasure to talk with you . 
 Yes , in many ways it is . There are many stereotypes I have to deal with in my daily life . 
 Well , like since I'm black , I must like rap music , come from the inner city , or play basketball well . 
 Hey ! But that's not the only problem . There's also the affirmative action stigma . 
 I know that , but some people don't think like that . And I get problems from teachers as well . 
 Racist ? Not exactly . It's how they look at me and ask for my opinion on a topic , as if I can speak for all black people and give them the black opinion on a subject . Suddenly I become the representative of the black race , as if we all had the same opinion . 
 Could you help me ? 
 I can't seem to find my class . 
 It's in the C building . 
 Do you think you can tell me where it is ? 
 It's room number 261 . 
 Could you show me where it is ? 
 John , have you ever watched Beijing Opera ? 
 What do you think of it ? 
 I couldn't agree more . Actually , I'm a Beijing Opera fan . 
 Let ’ s play a game ! 
 No , no , a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . I ’ m going to describe someone ’ s face , and you guess who it is ! 
 Let ’ s see . He has a roman nose , bushy eyebrows and dimples ! 
 Aunt Rose ! That mole is so huge ! OK , my turn . He has a crooked nose and full lips . He has quite a few freckles and an oval face . Oh , he is also bald ! 
 Not funny . 
 Everything is great , Tad . How are you ? 
 Tad , I'm pretty hungry right now . Want to walk over and check out the food table ? 
 That is Mary . I heard that she's just moved in with Lee . 
 Oh , that relationship is history . Malia hooked up with a guy she met on holiday . 
 Actually , he was OK with it . They hadn't been getting along too well . 
 I was not born yesterday . 
 I don't think you really want to hear about it . 
 To be honest , it was horrible ! My manager is such a pain in the neck ! 
 Well , he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them , my manager blamed them on me ! 
 There wasn't really anything that I could do . There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself . If I had said anything , he would have fired for me for sure . 
 He treats everyone pretty poorly , but the way he treats me really takes the cake ! 
 I really have no idea . All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair ! 
 Not really . I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion . 
 I try to be sensible about it , but it's not very easy . Sometimes you just have to grin and bear it . 
 Can you speak English ? 
 Where did you learn it ? 
 What else can you speak ? 
 Hi , Maggy , Did you hear about David ? 
 You know , about David and new boss . 
 Well , I hear David have been fired . 
 How would you describe your relationship with our boss ? 
 What do you think his strengths are ? 
 Which school is your children in ? 
 Oh , it costs too much . It's more expensive than the public school . 
 But the private school amount to better schools . 
 How much is it for each square meter ? How large is the apartment ? 
 That surely will cost you a lot of money . Are you going to make a full payment ? 
 If sounds so tempting . Why not go applying for a loan from the bank ? They charge very low interest , so you can choose whether to pay up the balance in 10 or 20 years . 
 I'm glad you like it . 
 Not at all . 
 I'm glad . 
 We'd like to have a look around your house ? 
 Thank you . 
 It's so spacious , about 40 square metres , right ? 
 Are these corn ears hanging on the tree branch ? 
 Very beautiful and very interesting . But why do you hang them in the tree ? 
 Very good idea . Sometimes such pictures can show the house's richness . 
 Oh , I ’ m going to meet my girlfriend in Thailand . 
 Actually it will be my first time to meet her . 
 That ’ s true . But we have known each other over the Internet for a few months now . Actually we are on an intimate level . We even plan to be engaged next month . 
 The Internet is making interaction much faster . People are getting to know each other much more quickly this way . 
 Hi ! Susan ! I haven't seen you for ages ! 
 Oh , fine . Hey , why don't we grab a bite to eat and do some catching up ? 
 Oh , George , what a beautiful day it is today ! The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there ! What a perfect day to be at the beach ! The kids are going to have so much fun ! And we ’ ll be able to relax in the sun while they ’ re playing . 
 There we go . Can you help me with the umbrella ? Perfect . 
 And stay in the shallow area . I don ’ t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! It ’ s too deep out there and we didn ’ t bring your floatier . 
 What is that ? A jellyfish ? Jeremy , put that down right now ! It could sting you ! 
 Hello 
 Hi B . How are you ? 
 I called you yesterday . Did you get my message ? 
 No problem . I wanted to remind you that my friend is getting married next week . You're still coming to the wedding with me , right ? 
 Yes . Did you forget ? 
 That's good . I want to invite Megan also . Next time you see her , can you tell her for me . 
 Yes , I think they might have gone to the same college or something like that . I'm not exactly sure how they know each other . 
 Yes . I'll pick you up first , and then we'll go get Megan . 
 Do you also believe in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy ? 
 I mean that you're gullible . You shouldn't believe everything you read , especially on the Internet . 
 Sounds like a pyramid scheme . Have you heard of those before ? 
 It's a scam 7 that's based on a hierarchy , like a pyramid . The person at the top asks the people below him for money , and then tells them to go and ask other people for money while sending some of it back to him . 
 Not exactly . The scam keeps on going , with the people at the bottom paying more and more money until they reach the very bottom . 
 Nothing . The people at the bottom give their money to the people above them , and they get nothing . They end up losing . That's why it's a scam . 
 We've been cramming for tomorrow's history exam since early this morning . What do you say we take a break and listen to some music , okay ? 
 While you're picking out a record to play , I'll grab a couple of beers out of the refrigerator . 
 Yeah , I've got everything from rock n ' roll to the latest new - wave stuff . 
 Sorry , my taste in music doesn't go back any further than the 1960 ' s . Music written before then is just history to me . 
 When can we expect you and your daughter for dinner ? Next Saturday ? 
 How about Sunday then ? 
 Does 6,30 suit you ? 
 Thanks , goodbye . 
 I agree , I think that that would be perfect ! 
 That might be a little too cold for some people . 
 What about April ? April has good weather that isn't too cold or too hot . 
 You know , maybe we could take a survey to see how that works for everyone . 
 Fine ! Well , I'll get right on it now ! 
 I need to check these books out . 
 Here it is . 
 Really ? 
 How much do I owe ? 
 I don ’ t have that much today . 
 I ’ ll pay it as soon as possible . 
 Huh ? 
 It is ? Oh , that ’ s nice . 
 Actually , I ’ d forgotten about it . 
 Because I ’ m not Christian , I ’ m Jewish . 
 It ’ s all right . There are so many Christians in America that everybody takes it for granted that I ’ m Christian . 
 Well , I ’ ll celebrate Hanukah soon , but that ’ s not as important to us as Christmas is to you . Mainly I ’ ll just enjoy the holiday break . 
 Not at all . A party is a party . I ’ ll be happy to come . 
 That's a good idea.What time is good for you ? 
 Sounds good . 
 Of course , this is my first time here . My Mom has a membership here . Here is the card . 
 It's not so wise that you do not explore the children's market . 
 Well , I want to become just like Bruce Lee . What should I do ? 
 I am still young . And I'm growing every minute . 
 I love running . Anything else ? 
 I'm perfect with my clothes . And I do not have anything else with me . 
 Oh , that's the only place where jeans are not popular . I'd better just go home . 
 Really ? Can I join it ? 
 How can I join it ? 
 OK , thank you . 
 No , it's not . 
 Don't mistake her as somebody . She ' s my older sister . 
 What do you do in summer ? 
 I don ’ t often go for walks , but I either play sports outside-you know , tennis or badminton-or just sit in the sunshine and read a good book . 
 Well , I play sports indoors quite often . If I ’ m feeling lazy , I just watch a film at home . I prefer summer to winter . 
 Yes . I like wearing shorts in summer . My legs would freeze ! 
 Thanks to global warming , it could be hotter than ever ! 
 Thank you . Same to you . 
 I've been invited over to a friend ’ s , and you ? 
 Do you offer a course in business management ? 
 How many nights a week is it ? 
 And how long does the course last ? 
 When does it start ? 
 What time is the class ? 
 How much does it cost ? 
 Yes , that's all right . I want to enroll in the course . 
 Do you want me to fill it out now ? 
 Which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most ? 
 How would you solve the problem ? 
 It would probably be very expensive . 
 It ’ s not a bad idea . I think education is the biggest problem at the moment . Schools don ’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly . 
 Most voters what everything both ways . They want the government to pay for lots of things , but without increasing taxes . 
 Yes . The government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly 
 No , I'm scared of cats . 
 I feel they're dirty . 
 Sorry , but I ’ m not really that interested in those things . 
 Really ? 
 Oh , I don't care about that . 
 Are they ? 
 I am afraid I am not interested in fashion . 
 But thank you very much all the same . 
 Come in , come in ! 
 I thought we were supposed to meet HERE . 
 I ’ m sorry . We must have misunderstood each other . 
 You ’ re right . I am sorry . Let ’ s go and watch the movie . 
 how was school today , Dominic ? 
 why ? What happened ? 
 it's just one exam . Can you re-take the exam ? 
 why didn't you do a good job ? 
 do you think you studied enough for the exam ? 
 what did you do last night ? 
 did you study at all last night for your exam ? 
 I am sure if you had studied , you would have done well . When can you re-take your exam ? 
 alright . Get out your books and I'll help you prepare . 
 They have moved to Chicago . 
 Mr.Smith has changed his job . 
 Why ? What's eating her ? 
 I don't have the slightest idea . 
 What ? Not my Dad , I hope ! ? 
 No kidding ! Jack is such a log ! He's never dated a girl . 
 And the problem with Jack is that he seems to have no interest in girls . He's putting his heart into his stamp collection . 
 Oh , they all went out ! Did you make a wish ? 
 Better luck this time ! 
 At least , it is better than my boxed lunch at work . I'm so fed up with the bland food . Thank you for having lunch with me ! 
 It's hard to believe that you like it . You are so easy to be satisfied . 
 Eating is important . You are what you eat . It's not only a daily routine . 
 No . I'm going to pay the bill for the company's lunch . 
 Well , the bill is paid by month . That's probably the only thing that I like about a take-out restaurant . 
 For what ? I thought you didn't like western food . 
 That's really smart . My son Daniel is the same with your son . I just don't get it , why all the kids prefer western food to traditional food . 
 That's for sure . It's always hard for the parents to say no to their children . 
 I need to return a book . 
 I want to check these books out . 
 That ’ s all . 
 It ’ s right here . 
 Yes . That ’ s it . 
 All right . Have a good night . 
 Most people like football . More boys like football than girls . A few girls play it really well . Some people like playing basketball . 
 More and more people like it now . fewer people play table tennis than before . Many people like swimming , because it is fun and keeps you fit . 
 Extreme sports are only for a small minority of people . Several people from my university enjoy them , but most of us just watch . No one I know plays golf . 
 A great deal of people follow rugby in my country . 
 Thank you for letting me borrow your portable CD player . 
 You seem to be in the seventh heaven . What's put you on ? 
 Did she give up her decision to marry Dick ? 
 I've come to say goodbye . 
 I'm catching the eleven o'clock train . 
 Goodbye . Hope to see you again next year . 
 Yes . It was sunny and warm yesterday but the wind is really blowing hard now . 
 I'm going to put on more clothes , too . 
 I don't know . Do you like snowing ? 
 You can read the newspaper . Maybe it will tell you whether it will snow or not . 
 This city is far too polluted . We should do something about it . 
 I am looking for a comfortable convenient way to see the country . 
 No , I've not heard of it . Tell me about it . 
 Is it just a bus ? 
 Wow ! That sounds like pure luxury . 
 Tom Hanks is always my favorite film star . 
 Many ! 
 Certainly . It ’ s actually the Chinese New Year and is regarded by the Chinese as the most important holiday of the year . 
 Family members usually get together on the Eve of the New Year and have a special dinner to celebrate . Relatives and friends often visit each other during the holiday to wish each other a happy new year . 
 Yes , just like Christmas in western countries , it is a time for eating lots of special food . 
 Really ? Why ? 
 Oh , it's unbelievable . She is such a chain smoker . 
 Oh , she is going to be a great mother . 
 Never ! He ’ s over 80 , isn ’ t he ? 
 Good gracious ! Are you sure ? 
 Is she really ? 
 Really ? Quite a woman , isn ’ t she ? 
 I know it's so exciting ! A new year is always like a clean slate . Fresh start to accomplish any dreams , objectives and goals . 
 I was thinking about it , but I'm never able to keep my New Year's resolution . Last year for example I joined a gym and only went twice . 
 That seems reasonable . We should get together and watch the ball drop in Times Square . 
 Well , we can't break tradition ! It's bad luck ! 
 Yes , I am.You must be Tom.Nice to meet you . 
 Be careful , Tom.Those are pretty heavy . 
 Are you working or are you a student ? 
 Which school are you studying at ? 
 I'm really tired of my job in the bank . I'm thinking about changing it . 
 Not yet , what's your opinion ? 
 Mike ! What's going on , man ! Long time no see ! 
 Things doing great ! It ’ s funny running into you like this . Smell well , just last week I ran into Matt as well . 
 He ’ s doing well . We went out for a couple of beers and the funniest thing happened . 
 Well , we were talking and catching up on what we ’ Ve been doing , talking about work and family , when all of a sudden , Matt saw a mouse run under his chair and he completely lost it ! He started freaking out , and screaming ... 
 Yeah , and the funniest thing was , that he jumped on to his chair and started shrieking like a girl . You had to be there ! Everyone was staring and laughing ... it was hilarious ! 
 I got rid of that clunker . This is my new one . 
 Jump in , I'll give you a ride . 
 Yeah , it costed a bundle alright . 
 Yeah , this sucker is the fastest thing I've ever owned . 
 We are on the high way . I'm the * * . 
 It's a great feeling . 
 Thanks , Daisy . 
 It's bulldog 123 . 
 Yes . 
 What do you mean ? 
 456 Cherry Drive , Pasadena , CA 91170 . 
 So what's the problem ? 
 Oh , I get it . My email address is bluedog123@yahoo.com . 
 What can I do for you today ? 
 Tell me the problem . 
 Oh , I see . 
 Do you still want both classes ? 
 I'll try to change one to a different day . 
 I ’ d love to have my own farm . 
 I wouldn ’ t mind getting up early morning and the physical work would make me fit and healthy . 
 That ’ s one reason I ’ d like to try it . I ’ d really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office . 
 My uncle owns a farm and I ’ Ve spent some time working with him . I love being in the countryside with farm animals and green fields . 
 We still have one more day to go before we return home . What will we see tomorrow ? 
 what about a factory tour ? 
 yes . I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which open to the public every weekend . We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry . 
 I'm not sure , but as far as I know , most factory tours are free . They are sponsored by the company providing the tour . 
 I believe most of them think of it as good public relations . They can promote their product and make their company better-known . 
 exactly . 
 I'll call the tourist information centre to check . 
 How can you tell the difference ? From what I see , they look almost the same . 
 Yes , they are different ! But it's too professional . What I need is just being able to tell the real from the fake . Do you know any method we can use to tell a fake ancient coin ? 
 I see . By the way , China was more than once ruled by foreign tribes in history . Did they issue their own coins in China ? 
 If you happen to find one , please bargain with the owner for it . I'd like to have one . It's interesting to see the integration of the Han and Mongolian cultures on this small piece of metal . 
 It's the fourth one this year . Isn't it horrible . 
 It may take many years for the trees to grow . I hope people will stop cutting down trees . 
 But we can't destroy our forests to get the wood . 
 Just having a chat . 
 What ’ s wrong ? I want a break from this horrible job . 
 Would you like to buy a bottle for me in the shop ? 
 Ok , I will go there myself . 
 It doesn ’ t matter . Oh , God , I have only four dollars in my wallet . Is that possible for me to buy one ? 
 I'm bored and got nothing to do tonight . 
 Hey , that sounds great . 
 What ’ s the first thing you do when you go to the bathroom in the morning ? 
 Do you usually shower or take a bath ? 
 Do you shave every morning ? 
 Do you brush your teeth twice a day as dentists recommend ? 
 Your dentist must be proud of you ! 
 No , not at all.Go ahead . 
 Yes.Is that so important ? 
 Yes , I have a three-year-old son . 
 Why not ? What's wrong with it ? 
 Would you like another one ? 
 Hmm ... have you got a receipt ? 
 Yes . I must see your receipt . You can't have your money back without receipt . 
 Morning , Tom . 
 You seem to be in a hurry . 
 Okay . I won ’ t hold you up then . 
 See you later . 
 To be frank , I was married once , and now I'm single . 
 Yes , my first marriage was a failure . 
 No , I can manage it myself.Just sit down , please . 
 Never mind . 
 How could I help but follow it ? The fluctuation of dollar is killing my company ! The exchange rates are eating into our profits , and we can't do anything about it . 
 Every day I have less money ! I haven't spent anything , it is just melting away because of the shifts in exchange rate . 
 What about the Yen ? 
 What a lovely day . The sun is shinning and the sky is so blue . It's a perfect day to go to the beach and get a beautiful tan . 
 Come on . Getting a tan symbolizes health and wealth in western countries . 
 That is a really interesting fact . 
 Just do whatever you feel like doing . 
 Good idea . It is always cooler in a shade . 
 What time is it , Tom ? 
 Is it ? I have no idea if I ’ m so late . I must be off now . 
 I must catch the nine-thirty Train . 
 Did you bring some lunch with you ? 
 Wow , that looks beautiful . 
 I might try it myself . 
 Yes , such as Christmas and Easter . 
 Thanksgiving Day , Independence Day . 
 Don't you know they've already broken up ? 
 And he's so handsome . 
 It seems like he's not coming . 
 Sure . 
 no . It's all yours . 
 Carson . It's nice to mee you , too . 
 it is unusually warm . I blame it on global warming . 
 so sure . Are you from around here ? 
 where are you from ? 
 I am from Texas . I was in China once , but it was a long time ago . 
 I did . I especially liked the food . What do you think about the food here ? 
 Is that the Da Vinci Code that you've got there ? 
 no , but I saw the movie . What do you think about it ? 
 well , this is my stop . it was nice talking with you . 
 Would you like a cup of coffee ? 
 Oh , no . 
 This machine is out of order . 
 I sure did . 
 Hello , Mary . Nice day , isn't it ? 
 I do feel like an outdoor exercise . After all , we haven't had such a beautiful day for a long time . 
 OK . It's delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh . 
 Are you kidding ? Don't you see many people over there ? Just on your right . 
 Ah , you changed so fast . 
 Oh , don ’ t talk to me about last night ! It was the most awful evening I ’ Ve ever had . 
 Well . Mary had promised to be my date , but she stood me up . I waited for her for a full hour in the cold wind . 
 It was boring . The music was too slow and the food was lousy and , above all , I was really sick of the same old crowd all the time . 
 I left after the opening dance . I couldn ’ t wait to get out of there . 
 Let me see . Laptop , flash disk , a ballpoint pen , a pencil , a notebook , a pair of glasses , cell phone , charger , moisture , notion , ... Oh , that is too much . You are not going to a business trip . 
 Actually , the company will provide you with all of these supplies . So , you can leave this very thick notebook at home . 
 Suit yourself . Don ’ t forget to set the alarm clock . 
 Because they are full-grown . Look at their curvy figures . 
 They suddenly become shy when they speak to boys . 
 She is certainly not my kind of girl . 
 You are so Platonic . Those naive girls will eventually grow into real women . They can't resist love , and men cannot resist their attraction either . 
 This one looks great ! I love the seashore . 
 And listen to this ! What do you think of sailing , swimming , windsurfing , and fishing ? 
 Yeah ... me , too . 
 Hey ! Look at this ! We can stay in a big hotel or we can stay in a little cabin by the beach . 
 Neither do I . Let's stay in a cabin.It ' ll be much nicer right beside the ocean . 
 Don't you know that ? It's panda . 
 OK , then put on your glasses , and do you know what does the panda eat ? 
 That's right . 
 You sound quite knowledgeable . 
 Actually , it likes milk too . 
 Do you know other famous animals in the world ? 
 That's right . OK , let's move on . 
 I attend an aerobic class three times a week . 
 No , I feel young , fresh and energetic . 
 Of course I did . I dreamed to be a pilot when I grow up . But unfortunately , I didn ’ t realize it . 
 Okay , forget about that . S , do you have some practical dreams at present ? 
 You're promising . Just follow your dream and never give up . 
 Hi Joe . You've met my new assistant , right ? 
 You are kidding , but she's so helpful . 
 Come on . She's like that with everyone . 
 Eric , how long will you be in China ? 
 Well , have you ever thought about learning some Chinese ? 
 Don't worry . All things are difficult before they are easy . 
 Well , are you invested in some language-exchange program ? 
 It's where I teach you Chinese , and in exchange you teach me English . 
 How about this sunday ? 
 Good . I'll give you a call tonight . 
 Bye . 
 Yeah , really . 
 Hi , I ’ m Susan Marshall , You can call me Susan.Nice to meet you . 
 Well , I ’ m a college student.How about you ? 
 Happy Birthday ! This is for you , Kate ! 
 You know in China we usually don't open presents until the guests leave . 
 The May Day holiday is coming . Have you made any plan ? Are you going to stay here or go out for a traveling ? 
 Where have you planned to go ? 
 Then which will be your first choice ? 
 I have decided to go to Tasha . 
 By plane . 
 Can you imagine she's over forty ? 
 Absolutely.She ' s a teacher of aerobics . 
 What's the matter ? 
 What teams are playing tonight ? 
 That will be a tough match , right ? 
 What are we waiting for ? It's already 7 pm now . Let's buy some drinks and desserts now . 
 I didn't expect to see you at this hour . You must have goofed off again . 
 You'll be sorry if the boss finds it out . He may probably give you the bag . 
 Hey , Leo . How come you look so terrible ? What ’ s going ’ on ? 
 How gross ! I can ’ t handle people like that . Does he at least give you a hand around the house ? 
 Man , what a freeloader . You better do something quick or he ’ ll never hit the road . After all , he ’ s got it made in the shade here . 
 Now , don ’ t go losing your temper . If you tolerated all you can , just kick him out ... but do it with gloves . I know ! Tell him a white lie like you ’ re getting the house fumigated ! 
 I've got an idea . Let's make this game even more interesting . 
 Well , if you want to ! Seriously , though , let's make a bet . 
 Don't be such a chicken ! Whoever loses has to treat everyone to a movie . 
 It ’ s broken . I just bought it yesterday , you know , it costs me $ 556 . 
 Mike suggests me to return it . 
 What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ? 
 Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows . 
 You are absolutely right . They are too brief . They don't tell you anything . 
 Do you think it fits me ? 
 I bought it at half price . 
 Do you like tea ? 
 Tea does good to people's health . There are many kinds of tea.Say , black tea , green tea , scented tea , brick tea , milk tea , Jas - mine tea , chrysanthemum tea and so on . 
 Yeah , but scented tea is now in fashion . 
 I ’ m not in the mood . 
 I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . That ’ s a real let-down . 
 But she did and made me disappointed . 
 But she means a lot to me . 
 This small town has many serious problems . 
 The mayor and high officials practice cronyism and a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions . 
 Do you love me ? 
 Yes , but do you love me ? 
 why didn ’ t you answer my question ? 
 Do you love me ? come on , I ’ m eager to hear . 
 Don ’ t cherish your words , dear . 
 You missed the film.That ' s a shame . 
 Yes . I got very excited . 
 Hello , this is the admissions office . Can I help you ? 
 What would you like to know ? 
 Yes , we offer both night and weekend courses in a number of different subjects . 
 If you give me your address , I can mail you an information packet and the application forms . 
 How nice of you to come ! 
 Just fine , thanks.And you ? 
 Marquet , do you think I should enroll in the science course ? 
 Right , I figure since you are doing premedical , you know about the very courses . 
 Yes , I'm really weak in maps , I did poorly in high school . 
 Earning extra income on the Internet is easier than you might think . After I started selling traditional craft items on the Internet last year , I have really been able to make bank doing something I love . 
 To run a successful internet business , it requires a little research and relatively small investment . You've got to have a good idea of some kind of product that is in demand or would be popular . 
 After you have your great idea , then you can set up shop by registering a domain name , creating a website , an email address , and a hosting service . If you want to go all out on your website , you can put together shopping cart technology , but that can be pricey to start out with . 
 Anything worth doing takes work . Money doesn't grow on trees ... Most of us have to work for it . 
 Yes , I did , but Linda stood me up . She didn't keep the date for the first time . 
 I don't know . 
 I did phone her this morning , but she hung up on me . I think she is going to walk out on me . 
 I will . Thanks for your advice . 
 Thank you , Lisa . 
 Oh , great ! I love it ! You know I've been expecting this for a long time . 
 Come here ; let me introduce some friends to you . 
 I know the Chinese teachers had their first festival in 1985 . 
 What will you do on Teachers ' Day ? 
 I intend to invite him to dinner . 
 Does it work ? 
 Don ’ t count on it . I think the best way to prevent AIDS is to keep yourself clean by having clean sex and keeping a regular sex partner . 
 Harry was angry last night . 
 But he used to be very relaxed and cheerful . It's not like Harry to do a thing like that . 
 Did you get any pizza ? When I got there , only small one was left . What a pity ! 
 Hello , Kevin . I hate to do this , but I have to cancel our appointment . 
 Yeah , I really wanted to come , too . But something unexpected in Shanghai have come up . I have to fly out for a few days , but I'll be back soon . 
 I should have some free time next week . Say , next Wednesday evening ? 
 Yeah , I'm expecting to come back on Tuesday . 
 OK . 
 Nice to meet you , Lvan.My name is Alike . I'm from Japan . 
 A second language is always difficult . 
 A crazy language ? Why do you say that ? 
 No wonder you say English is a crazy language . 
 Yes . Look at these historical relics here , amazing ! 
 For protection . Some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air . 
 No , there isn't . There is a vacuum in every box . 
 Yeah , they all come from a very ancient time . 
 It was made 4,000 years ago . It's priceless ! 
 I was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! Can you come here for a sec ? I need your help . 
 I don ’ t know what to wear ! Ok , give me your opinion . Do you like the way this looks ? The striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . I like the cut and hemline of these shorts so I think I ’ ll wear these as well . 
 Thanks honey ! You have such great fashion sense.Now , what am I going to do with my hair ? 
 I need to return these books . 
 Here they are . 
 I forgot they were due . 
 How much is the late fee ? 
 So I have to pay 25 cents for each day the books are late ? 
 That ’ s a lot of money . 
 Rock'n'Roll , I guess . 
 Not really . That ’ s pretty heavy metal . 
 I had to go get a cavity filled today . 
 I don't even wanna talk about it . It killed me ! 
 It took quite a while , but the worst part was getting numbed . They had to give me 3 shoots . 
 No kidding . Not only can ’ t I stand the pain , but man ... dentists are expensive . The bill is going to be humungous ! 
 I do , but it still does not cover everything . 
 The same to you ! 
 We're having some friends over.What are you doing ? 
 OK , guys . Here's the plan . Get the ball to the goal , and keep it away from Rich and Taylor ! 
 They played ball at school . Here we go . Yi-jun , go out for a pass ! 
 Catch it , Yi-jun ! Run to the ball ! Uh-oh ! Slow down , you're going to hit ... 
 What are you doing ? 
 There are no countries marked on the map . 
 The thing that I find most surprising is that most of the world is covered with water . Compared to the oceans , most countries are tiny . 
 Rivers have created deep valleys and canyons like the grand canyon . 
 It ’ s all so interesting . I ’ ll have to find more information about it on the internet . Or perhaps I should try and attend your geography class . 
 I'm going to a disco with my friends . 
 Well , I can ’ t believe your uncle and aunt came to stay with us for a week , and they did not even call us in advance . 
 I know , but it is hard for me to get used to your relatives coming to visit us , and without warning . 
 Yes , but Americans never visit without calling in advance , and they almost never stay overnight . 
 I think you ’ re right ! 
 Thursday . 
 I'd love to . 
 It does seem like the perfect day ! I ’ m glad we chose to get out of the city and enjoy the nice weather ! This looks like the perfect spot ! Ok kids , put on your sunscreen while your mom and I set up ca 
 Ok kids , here ’ sa beach ball and a Frisbee , a pail and a shovel . I want to see an impressive sandcastle by the time we leave . Don ’ t stray too far . Wait ! Leave your sandals here or put on your wet shoes 
 You ’ re back already ? The water was too cold , huh ? I ’ ll tell you a secret . Do you see that small pool of water over there ? It ’ ll be warmer in there . Go see if you can find some seashells or catch some 
 Ah ! Not on me ! Ow ! 
 Well , for many international students , coming to the United States and living here and studying can be quite a daunting experience , especially when finding a house on campus or off campus . 
 I think first of all for first-time students , coming and living on campus in dormitories can provide a certain level of security . 
 Uh , when you live off campus , there might be a certain amount of flexibility in choosing roommates that you might not have when living on campus . 
 Well , of course , the choice is up to you . Good luck ! 
 Who is that guy ? 
 Really ? He is my type . 
 What position does he play ? 
 Oh , I love Michael Jordan . He fills people's lives with great excitement . 
 Kobe is a good player but I heard he is a womanizer . 
 Jordan is a legend , anyway . An idol that no one can replace . I think Clive can make a good professional basketball player . He is not just about muscles he also plays smart . 
 By the way , do you know if he has a girl friend ? 
 Oh , My chance is slim then . 
 Haha ... please don't tell me you've got a dead stack . I hate making cold calls ... 
 Don't worry , I've gotchy covered . 
 Shandong . 
 I ’ m very sorry to hear about that . So are you all right ? 
 Oh , you poor thing ! 
 Of course I won't chill out . Opportunity knocks only once . 
 You're right . I will have a talk to her about that . 
 I usually ride my bike . Which form of transport do you prefer to use ? 
 I think we should discourage people from using their private cars . They produce too much pollution ! 
 Cars might be convenient , but they're so bad for the environment . 
 No . I used to have one though . Once I started using my bicycle to get around , I found that I didn't really need it . 
 You could try . It would save you a lot of money . 
 If you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving , you will get lots of exercise , too ! 
 Let's go to a car dealership . I'll help you try to sell your car for a good price . 
 Bob is really handsome . 
 I wish I were just as handsome . 
 How's your new work , Carl ? 
 Good for you . 
 Well , you have to take the bad with the good . 
 What can I help you with today ? 
 The library closes at six o ’ clock . 
 Not always . 
 Yes . 
 The hours are from 9 am - 6 
 Do you need anything else ? 
 I can't wait until my car is repaired . The commuting with public transportation is killing me . 
 But it is ! Take this morning for example . The subway was so packed this morning , I got totally squished by about a hundred busy commuters on the way to work . 
 That's true . The bus is even worse . Just thinking about taking the bus every day makes me tired ! Hey , how do you get to work every day ? 
 I'll bet it's good exercise , too ... a good way to keep fit . 
 Why are you so rude to your wife ? 
 But she means to help you , not to trouble you . 
 What he said disappointed me . 
 He advised me to change to a more suitable course . 
 He said that career in law was unsuitable for a women . 
 What do you think is harder , reading or writing ? 
 I don ’ t think I understand what you mean . Could you explain a little more ? 
 Oh , now I see what you mean . When you ’ re reading , you are just looking , but when you are writing , you are actually doing something ! 
 I think I see what you mean . I can read Shakespeare but I definitely can ’ t write it . 
 So I have another question for you . What do you think is harder , speaking or understanding ? 
 In what way ? 
 You are making me feel really discouraged . 
 You look happy . 
 Wow ! Is it a good car ? 
 Was it expensive ? 
 What colour is it ? 
 Let's meet tonight at the Thai restaurant at about 5 . 
 Why don't you walk ? It's only about 20 minutes walking and it's a nice evening . 
 Ha-ha , see you then . 
 I schedule my appointments from two to four on Saturday ; what works best for you ? 
 Great , do you need directions to my office ? 
 Well , just make sure to go through the double doors , and I'll be on the right . 
 It's very easy to find . 
 I will enjoy seeing you ; have a good week ! 
 That's disgusting . 
 What ’ s wrong ? Slow down or you are gonna give yourself a heart attack . 
 Take it easy ! Let ’ s go to the mall , window shop a little and see if there is anything she might like . 
 That ’ s where you ’ re making a big mistake ! You can ’ t just guess peoples ’ likes or sizes ! Especially with clothes or jewelry . On top of that , I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her . At the same time you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like ! 
 Yeah , tell me about it . I know ! Your mom is trying to learn Spanish , right ? Why don ’ t you get her a gift certificate for this great website I saw called SpanishPod . 
 Happy birthday , Ms . Lin . Here is a present for you . 
 I hope you like it . 
 I am glad you like it . 
 Cheer ! 
 Half past seven in the morning . 
 In the market . 
 Bottoms up . 
 Thank you . This place is nice . 
 Not really . It's much warmer usually . Your are not used to cold weather ? 
 Well , You'd better get some more warm clothes . 
 I would say it's about 5 degree Celsius . 
 Good evening , David.Good evening , Mary.It ' s so good of you both to come . 
 what are you listening to ? Is that Beethoven or Mozart ? 
 I think Beethoven's music is incredible . I've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent , too . Do you believe that ? 
 what other kind of music do you listen to ? 
 to be honest , I think classical music is too complicated for me . 
 I like pop music . Do you ? 
 I see what you mean . I think that's way I like it so much . 
 I've always been into it . Have you always liked classical music ? 
 so , how did you become interested in it ? 
 do you still play piano ? 
 Want to join me for a midnight snack ? I need to grab something to eat . 
 Let's go to the food stall . There's a good one just around the corner . 
 ( Later .. ) Everything looks tempting . What do you want to have ? 
 Can I have a bite ? 
 Super ! 
 Yes , I've been sitting here for a few minutes . I'm waiting for someone to put gas in my car . 
 Self-service ? 
 Are you serious ? 
 Yes , I'm from Taiwan . I never heard of a gas station where you fill up your own car . 
 Do I really have to do it ? I don't know how . 
 What sign ? 
 I see . 
 Why ? Did you open an attachment ? 
 I kind of like it . He looks better that way , doesn't he ? More presidential . 
 Yeah , their expressions were exactly the same ! 
 I bet my button dollar that he won't . He is no more than a nine day's wonder . 
 Many people like him get a flying start but soon disappear . 
 Yes.It ' s sometimes scary if you think of the tremendous amount of media we face every day . 
 Which financial magazines and newspapers do you think do the best job of checking facts ? 
 I like to read Fortune . 
 Where does a broadcast company get most of their information ? I hope it's not just from press releases . 
 But sometimes when a flimsy report , or even a rumor gets on television , there's going to be a terrible ' echo chamber ' effect . 
 Hi , Li Ming . You look upset . What's the matter ? 
 Why ? We can leave school earlier that day . 
 I can't believe it . My parents never beat me . 
 You can ask the teacher for help . 
 Did your company go union ? I heard that many companies in out industry are being unionized , so It's getting harder and harder to compete on a level playing field . 
 Management isn't looking on the labor unions too favorably , I'd guess . I don't blame them ... labor unions can really put the squeeze on the executives . 
 I hope the host team loses . 
 According to the papers , the visiting side is a strong team in America . 
 Hi honey ! You ’ ll never guess what ! My friends Julie and Alex are getting married ! 
 I know ! Anyways I just talked to Alex ’ s best man and he is organizing the bachelor party It ’ s gonna be so much fun ! All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we are going to do that night . 
 Aw come on ! It ’ s just some innocent fun ! You know how these things are ! We are gonna play drinking games , get him some gag gifts and just have a good time . Nothing too over the top . 
 Come on ! If one of your friends was getting married I wouldn ’ t mind you going to her bachelorette party ! 
 Aren ’ t you interested in watching the Olympics ? There have been some excellent performances by athletes from all over the world . 
 I think it ’ s wonderful to see people from all over the world taking part in such a great event . 
 I think the Olympics help to promote world peace . 
 You are so pessimistic ! The Olympics is a great opportunity for athletes to demonstrate their speed , skill , agility and strength . Most people hope to see someone from their country win , but I think that they are just happy to see good performances by any athlete . 
 Now there we are in agreement ! 
 Thank you . But a number of things have been going wrong lately . 
 Oh , the whole house needs re-painting for starters . The carpet in the living room is worn out , and I'd like to put in new wall-to-wall carpeting . Last week , I had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . Anyway , all par for the course when you own a house , I guess . I think I am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over . 
 Go right ahead . 
 Well , you really do have a talent for this , Alice . Thanks for the suggestions . 
 What are you hiding in your coat pocket ? 
 You want to take pictures of the inside of your pocket ? 
 What's that supposed to mean ? 
 Sorry.What was that you said ? 
 Where ? 
 When , did you say ? 
 Who's coming ? 
 Sorry . I didn't quite catch what you said.There ' s a lot of noise outside . 
 Loretta ? No , she can't come , she's busy . 
 You'd better tell your sister what happened and face the music . 
 That sounds great ! 
 I'm in a good mood today , actually . How about you ? 
 What's wrong ? 
 I see ! Do you want to ask her out ? 
 You can ask her out for drinks after work . 
 Then you've got a lot of work to do . You need to get her to notice you first . 
 You can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying ' hello ' to her . 
 That's something you need to overcome . Men should make the first move as most girls prefer being chased . 
 Good luck ! 
 Sure . Come on in . 
 what about taking her for a dinner or a movie ? 
 well , there is a play on campus this weekend . 
 what's the matter with these ideas ? 
 what about going on a picnic ? 
 you can also take her to the art museum or a cafe . Certainly , i must come up with something you can use . how do you like the ideas i am giving you ? 
 Hi , Sue . What's up ? 
 Ok , I guess . My boss has been on my back recently . 
 You know , just giving me lots to do . I'm really busy right now . 
 Oh , lots of things . Mostly training new people . 
 Yeah ? I guess so . I spent the weekend at beach . 
 Some friends of my parents live out there , and they invited me there . 
 I jogged up and down the beach and played volleyball . You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand . I couldn ’ t get through a whole game before I had to sit down . 
 I wanted to , but the water is too cold , and I just wetted in up to my knees . 
 It looks like you could use it . Don ’ t tell me you spent the weekend in the library again . 
 Yes , of course . This is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines . 
 Thank you for the invitation . 
 Yes , please . Thank you for everything . 
 Yes , I do . I ’ ll walk you there . 
 Are you applying to study or work abroad ? 
 What do you want to study ? 
 Have you got your visa yet ? 
 I see.Is it your first interview ? 
 Do you have a park in the city ? 
 That ’ s great . We can go boating on the lake in the afternoon . 
 Then we can take a walk and enjoy the scenery in the park . 
 So the reform can not be carried out well . 
 Easier said than done . 
 Oh , no ! No more paddling ! My arms are sore ! 
 Beth , what date is today ? 
 What is the date today ? 
 Oh , i almost forgot . Today is my mom's birthday . 
 Thanks ! I will do that ! When is your birthday ? 
 Wow ! What a lucky girl ! Your birthday is on Christmas Day . 
 April 2nd . I missed being a target of a lot of jokes by one day . I guess I am lucky , too ! 
 Thanks . 
 I guess so . 
 That should work out great . You are miracle worker ! You have got me awake and motivated . 
 Jane , what do think about this dinner ? 
 The band is pretty good . How do you like the music ? 
 well , then , may I invite you for the next dance ? 
 don't worry . I'm not much of a dancer myself . 
 you dance beautifully too . 
 in college . But I don't dance very often . What's your favourite dance ? 
 how about tango ? 
 Tango is my favorite . Anything but hip-hop or the foxtrot . 
 my pleasure . Let's go and have a drink . 
 Bang ? ! Bang ! Bang ! What are the Kings doing at seven o ’ clock on Sunday morning ? 
 Yes , but what ’ s the banging noise ? 
 And what ’ s Mrs . King doing ? 
 What ’ s happening ? 
 What ’ s Mr . King doing ? 
 And is she helping him ? 
 Well , I ’ m not going to answer it . I ’ m sleeping . 
 Oh , you are so nice . What a lovely scarf . 
 Of course , I like it very much . Thank you . 
 Yes , of course . Have you got the tickets ? 
 Matinee or evening ? 
 Circle or stalls ? 
 Wonderful , I'll go with you . 
 Off campus or on campus ? 
 Why don't you park in the parking structure for students ? 
 It's on the west side of the campus . 
 It was empty last time I went up there . 
 I went up there early this morning . 
 It might be . You'll have to go see for yourself . 
 What kind of movie is it ? I don ’ t like many of his movies , actually . 
 I like thrillers and I like Julia Roberts , so it might be interesting . I read a review today and the critic didn ’ t seem to be very impressed . 
 He didn ’ t say it was bad , but he said that it wasn ’ t as good as it could have been , particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it . 
 Good . Dinner is nearly ready and I ’ d like to watch the news before we go . The Oscars were last night and I want to see the results . 
 this is tough to say , Jordan , but I think we should break up . 
 yes , I mean it . 
 no , we are just too different . This isn ’ t working . 
 I have thought about it for a while . I think it ’ s time to move on for both of us . 
 I ’ m sorry . 
 then why didn ’ t you talk to me ? 
 I don't want to argue with you anymore . This is going to be tough , but Let ’ s try and be friends . 
 I think we ’ ll be better off if we are apart . 
 sure , let ’ s just be friends . 
 Excited ? What's there to be excited about ? It's just another company dinner , right ? 
 Really ? What kind of prizes ? 
 A new car ! You're kidding ! 
 Wear red underwear ? ! Does that really work ? Are you going to try it ? 
 Gee , I don't think I own any red underwear , but I can buy some ! 
 I don't quite remember . Why did you ask that ? 
 Oh , my . What did you do ? 
 Did you call the police ? 
 I heard that you went to the concert the day before ? How did you like it ? 
 Who was the conductor ? 
 Oh , I learned that he is also a legendary violinist . 
 Obviously you did enjoy the concert . 
 Have you heard about Alice and David ? 
 No , they've got engaged . 
 Well , my dear , I didn't believe it either . But I got it straight from the horse's mouth . David called me this morning . 
 Last weekend , while they were on their ski trip . 
 Next June . 
 All the routine work really browns me off . 
 I wish I hadn't chosen this job . 
 I like them very much . They are delicious . 
 Daniel , hold on for a minute . What are you trying to pull there ? 
 Oh , you want my chocolate cakes , so to speak ! 
 Daniel , carrots contain much Vitamin C . It is good for you . 
 Oh , stop it ! You know you need vegetables . You will end up fat if you don't watch your diet , now . 
 Oh , no ! I ’ Ve been assigned to work with Jerry for our group project . 
 Flowers for my favorite girl . 
 That's a secret . Here , let me help you with your coat , and we'll be on our way . 
 Fine , what do you call this ? 
 Really ? Thank you . I am thinking the same thing about you . 
 On Saturday night I ’ m going to have a small get-together . 
 Would you like to come ? 
 Yes , this coming Saturday . 
 I ’ m sorry to hear that . 
 Well , perhaps , another time . 
 Sure . Thank you for saying that . Actually , those songs were sung for the first time today . I wrote them in the past two months . 
 You can say that . But my band and I also sing regularly in several other places , too . 
 I picked up guitar at an early age , maybe around 8 years old . Afterward , I taught myself by listening to some records of top players . 
 Could you come and spend the weekend with us ? 
 That's too bad ! 
 Excuse me . I don't think we have met before . My name is Mary Jenson . 
 Good to meet you , Mr Chettri . 
 Welcome to our university ’ s fifties anniversary , Sir . Please have a seat . 
 Thank you . 
 Certainly . Mr . Lee ’ s office building at the south end of the campus , just beside the library . 
 Let me show you the way . Please follow me . 
 My pleasure . 
 It ’ s up on the second floor . You have to use the stairs . The elevator isn ’ t working . 
 Listen , Nancy . If I don't work hard , I will be laid off . 
 Come on , Nancy . Play it cool . I go with you and burn the middle night oil tonight . 
 I was turned down again . It ’ s frustrating . I guess you ’ Ve got to teach me some skills . 
 At least you know what American women generally like in a man . 
 American men are naturally taller than Chinese men . So even if I exercise , there aren ’ t many chances . 
 You know , that ’ s going to be a tremendous change for me . Because I never exercise . 
 Have you heard that new song by the Beastie Boys ? 
 It's not much different from that heavy metal music you like so much . 
 Hey , you can dance to rap music ! 
 What's your new girlfriend like ? 
 Does she know how to speak Spanish ? 
 Wow ! ! ! 
 That's terrific ! 
 What's that ? 
 Are these your text books ? Biochemistry , General Ecology , Botany , Cell Genetics , Molecular Genetics ... 
 Oh , right ! Do you have many exams at the end of each semester ? 
 And when do you prepare for your final exam ? 
 Really ? You only review your lessons in one month ? Does it work ? 
 Wow , and all the key points are included in them ? You're so smart ! 
 Do you have the classrooms open for the whole night ? 
 What's today's date ? 
 You know , Mary , I feel we meet somewhere before . Where were you born ? 
 What was your childhood like ? 
 Where did you go to university ? 
 What is your current occupation ? 
 Did you know that you wanted to be a journalist right after your graduation ? 
 Do you like your current job ? 
 Do you want a cigarette ? 
 You don't mind if I have one . 
 Yes , you are right . 
 I've tried to give up smoking several times , but it's no use . 
 Oh , hey , no kidding ! I haven't seen you since orientation three months ago ! So how've you been ? Settling into college life OK ? 
 Oh , so you're a frat boy now , huh ? 
 Not much . I'm still living at home and commuting to school . I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about . It just wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped . The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count . 
 Yeah , it is , a little bit . I joined the Great Outdoors Club , though , which has been a lot of fun . We've gone on two camping trips already , and I've made some good friends . 
 Definitely pre-med . What about you ? 
 OK , take care ! Hey , nice running into you ! 
 Whatever we do , we should do it above board . 
 Well , since you agree with me , we should put the issue above board instead of talking about it through other channels . 
 Well , all my friends listen to it , so I became a big fan too . 
 I'm a big fan of Snoop Dog . 
 What is over ? 
 Any reasons ? 
 Oh , that ’ s too bad . 
 Fantastic ! I got an overall score of eight . 
 Yes . I'm just waiting until I officially get admitted to the university with a conditional offer to apply for my visa . 
 No . 
 We ’ Ve been over this a thousand times . The data is irrefutable ! Look , we ’ Ve done extensive research , built studies , and read the literature , and there is conclusive evidence to support my theory ! 
 That is preposterous ! 
 I am not wrong ! The chicken came first ! 
 My husband goes out drinking with his friends every night . I'm fed up with it . 
 Charles , have you finished your homework ? 
 I want you to have a walk with me . 
 Did you lock the doors ? 
 Well , I ’ m going on to bed . I ’ m beat . 
 Please told Tim to close the door to the basement . I don ’ t want dog down there tonight . 
 Have you ever played Making ? 
 Yes , some friends play it all day , all night , and sometimes a whole weekend . I tried to read about some basic rules online , but it is hard to understand . So I went to watch people play yesterday only to find I was even more confused . I think I have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . Practice makes the master . 
 It is important to keep your mind up-to-date and active . 
 What a great idea ! Now you have a friendly audience to practice with ! 
 Oh , he wants to practice his language skills , too . 
 Maybe Olga can introduce you to some of her friends who can write to you in German and you can do the same for her with your friends to write her in English . 
 I don't know , but you know how to surround yourself with great friends ! 
 What a shame ! 
 That's too bad . 
 I'm sorry to hear that . 
 What a pity ! 
 Ho , no ! 
 I am going to the bank . I need to cash some checks . 
 Why are you going there ? 
 I see . Will you bring a lot of money with you ? 
 Do you have the bank card in Japan ? 
 That sounds really convenient . Do you pay extra money to enjoy this service ? 
 Great ! I will apply for a credit card when I go to the bank later . 
 Does she make any sense to you ? 
 She's speaking French , not Greek . 
 Me neither . All I have to do is study French hard . 
 Do you love me ? 
 Yes , but do you love me ? 
 Why didn ’ t you answer my question ? 
 Do you love me ? Come on , I ’ m eager to hear . 
 Don ’ t cherish your words , dear . 
 What do you do in your spare time ? 
 What kinds of sports do you like ? 
 Who is your favorite author ? 
 Are you a music lover ? 
 What kinds of films do you enjoy ? 
 Do you have any hobbies ? What is it or what are they ? 
 How do you spend your spare time ? 
 What kind of books are you interested in ? 
 Well , those books are really good . I like them too . How do you entertain yourself ? 
 It depends on where you are and what position you are in . For instance , if you are in an elevator and you smile , you will make other takers uncomfortable . 
 I cannot see eye to eye with you here . You see , I am fed up with those who keep smiling to me . I mean , they smile for no reason at all . 
 It's nice and bright today , isn't it ? 
 How about winter ? 
 It's boring , right ? 
 Do you get much rain during the summer ? 
 So you should bring an umbrella often . 
 I ’ m betting the New York Yankees win . How about you ? 
 Sorry , guys . Could I just interrupt for a moment ? My money is on the Yankees ! 
 Hey , Ken . Good luck if you already put your money on the Red Sox . 
 When in Rome , do as the Romans do , they say . 
 They live in Rome , of course , and go to work by car or bus . But sometimes it takes too long that way because of the traffic jams , so they walk . 
 Yes , but they do it differently . Everything is different . 
 Well , the climate's different for a start . It doesn't rain so much as it does in England . The sun shines more often . 
 I know . You hate the rain , don't you ? 
 And a Roman really Ioves life . Eye knows how to enjoy himself . 
 Not always . But they like a good meal . Lots of tourists go to Rome just for the food , you know . 
 I don't know exactly , but it costs a lot of money . 
 My mother works in a company as an accountant . 
 Not always , she's rather busy at the end of the year . 
 All right . ... What's the date today , please ? 
 Are you going to the cafeteria downstairs ? 
 Could you please get me a takeaway ? I have some urgent work to finish . So I don ’ t have enough time to go out for lunch . 
 I am not picky on food . Just bring me the day menu . 
 Well , the costumes and the set are marvellous , but the acting is a bit stiff . What do you think ? 
 Do you know anyone in the play ? 
 Really ? Is that why you wanted to come to the play ? 
 So you've seen other plays that he's directed ? 
 Sure , I'd love to meet the cast ! Have you ever been in a play ? 
 What did you do ? 
 I once helped out with costumes , but I didn't enjoy it very much . 
 I spent over three weeks sewing sequins on a coat . 
 Many congratulations on your winning the game . 
 You were doing great out there ! 
 That's good to know . We'll watch for crazy drivers . 
 Football ? Sounds dangerous . Maybe I'll just be a cheerleader . 
 Uh , yeah . And I've seen guys in pads tackled . We have no pads . I don't want to be tackled . 
 OK , but they better tag lightly ! 
 Oh , I am very sorry , Hans . Thank you for waiting for me . You must have been here a long time already . 
 I was caught in the heavy rain , or I would have come earlier . I am sorry I kept you waiting . 
 Yes . When I came out of the subway , it was raining cats and dogs . And I forgot my umbrella . So I had to wait for the rain to let up . 
 How's your thesis going ? 
 I've finished the first draft , but the professor said it's poorly written . I have to rewrite it . it's so depressing . 
 I am trying to decide what school to apply to ? 
 I am not sure . What's the difference between them ? 
 Which is better ? 
 I hear you have to wear uniforms at private school . 
 You'll soon graduate from your university . Do you have any plans for the future ? 
 Do you have a clear career path to follow ? 
 what kind of job do you want after graduation ? 
 wait ! You can't do so many things at the same time . What exactly do you want ? 
 yeah , you should first decide what kind of career you really want , plan your career path , and then try your best to achieve your goal . 
 no , you can't waste your time wandering around . If you want a job that requires a higher degree or diploma , you should focus on your graduate school entrance exam ; if you want a job that needs working 
 Look at these clothes designed by top fashion designer like Versacci , Calvin Klein , and Vivienne Westwood . What do you think of them ? 
 I know what you mean . People would stare at you in amazement if you wore something like that in an everyday situation . I suppose only extravagant rich people wear them at cocktail parties . 
 I think that the designers hold these fashion shows for a few reasons . First , it ’ s just like a big party . They can meet each other and network . The other thing is that it is great advertising . All the journalists and photographers are there . Thirdly , it give them a chance to show what they would like to see people wearing . 
 Yes . I think the designers are saying that these clothes are what they would like to see people wear if those people weren ’ t concerned with what other people might think . In a way , the designers are saying ‘ don ’ t worry about what others think . Wear what you like ! ’ . 
 Come on . All this fashion has reminded me that I want to buy some clothes . 
 Really ? How do you get the chance ? 
 Congratulations . How lucky you are ! 
 I ’ m sure you ’ ll enjoy the trip . China is such a beautiful country . 
 Have a nice journey , Lily . 
 Dora , are you interested in going to the museum with me tomorrow ? I read the newspaper this morning . I know there is an art exhibition in Taipei Modern Art Museum . 
 I don't think so . I think we had better go there earlier , or we may have to spend a lot of time waiting . 
 Look at the ticket booth in the center . There seems to be not as many people as we thought it would be . 
 Good idea . 
 I have no idea . Let me take a closer look at my museum map 
 It's on the 2nd floor . We are going to see some beautiful paintings about the history of ancient Greece . 
 Good afternoon ! 
 I'm very well , thank you.How are you ? 
 Yes , it's beautiful , but it's also very hot . 
 What's the weather like in your country ? 
 Where do you live ? 
 Here.Near this school . 
 I hope we can make great progress in this new semester . 
 I hear we'll have a new English teacher this semester . 
 I am sure we will . 
 Nowadays , they offer so many services , you hardly know which one to choose . Take mailing for example . Do you send something first class or second class or do you use EMS ? 
 You can buy things at post office that were never sold there before . You can buy sweets and chocolates , newspapers , birthday and Christmas cards ... 
 My son likes going to the main post office . They have a philately counter where he can buy stamps for his collection . 
 I think it ’ s better for some things , like sending and receiving money , but if you need to post something it sometimes takes longer than it used to . 
 She is really pretty , isn't she ? Her skin looks so baby-smooth ! 
 Ah , I can smell jealousy in the air . 
 Yeah , right . But what did you put on your face last night ? Those little greenish things . 
 Yeah , yeah , yeah ! They wipe out tight , tired feelings and remove lines and age signs . Blah , blah ... See , I can even recite it . 
 It sounds that you have a high opinion of him . 
 Birds of feather flock together . 
 You cannot judge a person that way . I have a hunch that he is a sly dog . 
 You can never tell . He might do you in when he sees an angle in doing it . 
 So I've heard . That's why I'm having such a great time . 
 Huh ? Um ... well , it's nice to see that some people still have big families . 
 What was that noise ? 
 Frightened ? You must be joking ! 
 Again ? The area around the park is too dark at night . There should be more lights there . 
 Your feelings might be right . You should never walk alone there at night . It is too dangerous . 
 Well , that's it . 7 appointments in Paris at beginning of next week , and 4 in Frankfurt at the end of the week . 
 Now it's a question of getting there . I need a flight to Paris on Sunday evening and a hotel in Paris for 3 nights . I have to be in Frankfurt by 11 on Thursday morning . And I will need a hotel for one night . I will head home on Friday . 
 My last appointment is at 3 , so I should be free by 5 at the very latest . I think I could get to the airport by 6 . 
 No , not really . 
 No , but I am sure it won't take more than an hour . 
 You are a pessimist . 
 What is the best place to park ? 
 I drive a motorcycle . 
 I am not sure what a handicapped spot is . 
 I park days and evenings . 
 What signs ? 
 What curb colors ? 
 Would you like to play golf with me ? 
 It doesn't matter . I will teach you . 
 Borrow morning . 
 Just take your golf club . I will pick you up Borrow . 
 See you Borrow . 
 Hi , Bill , this is my new car . 
 You like it , huh ? 
 It is special , isn't it ? 
 Lots . Looks like I'll have to moonlight for the next two years . 
 Hey , let's go for a spin . You can try it out . 
 Ok , let's go . 
 Have you ever been to it before ? 
 Let's go . It sounds interesting . 
 Dear , don ’ t worry . The police can help you . 
 Good morning , Miss Bell ! 
 Nice to see you too . It's been a long time . 
 Just fine , and you ? 
 Did you drive yourself to the airport ? 
 Did someone meet you at the airport here ? 
 Is this where we'll be holding the meeting ? 
 Is there a lot of snow in this region at this time of the year ? 
 Well , I think I like it . I appreciate the snow very much . 
 By the way , where can I go ski ? 
 Hi , Sandra . how was your weekend ? 
 Fantastic ! how was that ? 
 I might . what did you do yesterday ? 
 Do you know that scientists replicated a sheep into an identical clone . 
 It's a big jump in science . Maybe more like a leap . 
 She has contributed to a new school . 
 I hear the school is very modern . It has the best equipments . 
 She said she would name it after her father . 
 What are you doing over the weekend ? 
 I want to go camping , you know , just get a way for the weekend . I'm not sure I'll be able to , though . 
 Well , I have a lot of work . I'll see how to goes . 
 Thank you . Good afternoon Mrs . Smith , Miss Duncan , Miss Lamb . 
 Thank you . 
 I don't like the weather like this . Cold and rainy . Hope it become sunny as soon as possible . 
 Quite well , Tom.And you ? 
 He's much better today . 
 See you later . 
 That is very encouraging news . I heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . That is to say , the R & D center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market . 
 That is the best one I have seen . I am sure our target customers , young people will love it . 
 Mary , I think we should stop seeing each other . 
 I'm sorry but it's for the best . 
 Do you like jazz , Tom ? 
 Well , yes , I do . I'm a real fan of Wanton Marsalis . 
 No , he doesn't ! ! ! He plays the trumpet . So , what kind of music do you like ? 
 Who's your favorite group ? 
 No , I don't . I can't stand them ! ! 
 Yeah . We ’ re never going to get to the end of this one . 
 Well , it does have a lot of girls in it . 
 Do you think Bruce Willis just drank a Coke for his health ? 
 Of course . 
 Yeah , Got a Coke ? 
 Hurry , the movie is coming back on . 
 Good morning , Gav ! Did you sleep well last night ? 
 That's great news ! You look much more relaxed than you did yesterday . 
 What's that ? 
 That's annoying , but nothing to worry about . 
 Just breathe deeply when you feel yourself getting upset . 
 Is there anything else bothering you ? 
 Do you have any other plans this weekend ? 
 Try not to take on more than you can handle . 
 Speaking of classical music , we should never forget about the New Year's Concert of the Vienna Philharmonic . 
 Sure . It's one of the biggest classical music events . Have you ever been to the live show ? 
 Wow , you're so lucky . I saw it on TV . But it must be so different to be there in the concert hall . 
 It seems to me that you are on very good terms with him . 
 He must be all over you the first time he saw you . 
 That means he was head over heels in love with you . 
 But I think he can't hold a candle to you . I don't think he has ever popped the question . 
 How about the matter ? 
 It ’ s the only way to preserve her reputation . 
 can I see your passport , please ? 
 yes it is . Residents can queen up in the lines to my right . 
 what's the expiration date on your passport ? 
 I see . Yes , you'll need to renew your passport in a few months . Make sure you don't let it expire while you are in the UK . 
 do you have anything to declare ? 
 how long will you be staying in the UK ? 
 what is the purpose of your stay ? 
 where will you be staying ? 
 how do you plan on paying for your living costs and tuition fees while you are here ? 
 ok . Have a good day . Here's your passport and documents back . 
 I can't even imagine you snorkeling ! 
 OK , Bond . 
 So you can always keep two times at once ? 
 The only two times you need are I'm late and I'm really late . 
 No , I am not eating there anymore . I have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner . The food served in the cafeteria is not my type . I am a total meat lover . But the cafeteria is doing its best to force me to be a vegetarian . They have been serving the Chinese cabbage and white gorse for three days . Haven ’ t you noticed that ? 
 Well , then the cafeteria suits you best . But anyway , if you like to have a lunch outside the company , feel free to join me anytime . 
 Would you please tell us how to review our lessons ? 
 Any other requirements ? 
 Should we remember all the new words and expressions ? 
 Sorry , I don't quite understand some difficult points in this unit . I wonder if you could help us to solve the problems . 
 When shall we have a coaching period ? 
 Ok . 
 It's harmful . Not only for yourself but for others . 
 Stop producing cigarettes . 
 That's right.But I don't think there are better ways . 
 Maybe it can take effect . 
 Yes . 
 The author was a famous writer , and he was also a politician . He was born in 1911 and died in 1985 . 
 Can I answer it in Chinese ? 
 Let me have a try . The author takes the characters peculiar to the British people as a topic to show that they are quite different from other nationalities . They are quiet , shy and reserved ... 
 wow ! You're going to Tibet ? 
 that's really cool ! I've always dreamed of going somewhere like Tibet , seeing something unique . 
 nothing particular . 
 oh , Tibet sounds great , but I'm afraid it'll cost too much . Last time I traveled to India , and it cost me a fortune . 
 ok , then count me in . where will we stay ? 
 then make sure that you book me a room , too . 
 and check whether they accept credit cards . 
 Excuse me , I ’ d like to apply for a library card . 
 What sort of proof do you need ? 
 I ’ m a student from out of state , so I don ’ t have a local driver ’ s license . 
 The phone bill ’ s in my name . 
 How long will it take to get the regular one ? 
 Okay.Thanks for your help . 
 In a while , crocodile . 
 We were in the same science class last term . 
 I did . 
 It was no big deal . 
 They're glad that I finally got a boyfriend . 
 Hi , my name ’ s Karl . My wife and I are moving in next door . 
 I ’ m happy to meet you . It seems everyone in town is so friendly . 
 Well , I ’ m from Chicago . There few people take the time to get to know their neighbors . 
 We wanted to live in a more peaceful community and have more space . Another reason is , we can afford to buy a home here , but we can ’ t in Chicago ! 
 You are kidding . 
 Although we have many things in common , we'are not soul mates . 
 120 British pounds . But there are still three days left in the auction . If you want it , you'll have to bid . Do you have the guts ? 
 Just don't come looking to me for help . 
 I'm signing off . 
 Have you met John ? 
 Have you noticed how fluently he speaks English ? He has only lived in America for less than three months . 
 What courses are you going to take next year ? 
 Why are you going to take English with chemistry and physics ? 
 Of course it depends on what you are going to do when you leave college . Have you decide what you are going to do when you graduated ? 
 Does your wife work ? 
 Oh , I understand . She cooks , cleans and takes care of children . Is that right ? 
 You are really a hen-pecked husband . 
 I like all kinds of stuff . I admit I love romance . 
 You mean my favorite movie of all time ? I guess I ’ d have to say pretty woman . 
 What are you thinking about ? 
 Again ! 
 Hello . Are you a friend of Helen's ? 
 My name is Phil . What's yours ? 
 Have you tried these little ditties ? They are really good . 
 Can I get you some punch ? I was just going to go get myself some . 
 I usually bowl with an eight ball . I like the control of a light ball . I can spin it more , so that the ball hooks . 
 Well , let's see which technique is better . I think I'll go up first ... Yes ! I hit a strike . I knocked them all down on my first bowl . 
 Good start . You knocked eight pins down . But you are left with a 7,10 split . Unless you can bowl a UFO-ball on this bowl , it is going to be impossible . 
 Mom , why do chinese people like to touch my head ? sometimes they even touch my cheeks . 
 But i donor like it , not a bit , i am not a pet , i am a girl . 
 But i do not like anyone touch my head . 
 What if everybody in the wheres goes crazy ? 
 Does this mean that if i might want those new European bitches , i am supposed to wonder run reget ? 
 That is my work , i will try it . 
 sure , go ahead . 
 yes , it is . You want go online ? there are no wi-fi hotspots around . 
 can't you wait till you get home ? then you can surf the internet using the broadband , wireless connection or whatever you like . 
 now I see , you must be suffering from discomgoogolation . 
 well , the term " discomgoogolation " comes from " discombobulate " and " google " . Because floods of information are just a mouse click away , net users are very likely to become addicted to the web . 
 then , you're probably addicted . 
 i like my professors and the classes , but it's a lot of work . 
 right now , I'm doing some research into the languages of different African tribes . 
 yes , I learned how to speak it when I was little . 
 well , I grew up in Africa , so I learned quite a few different languages . 
 I don't know because I haven't received my test results yet . 
 about two weeks ago . 
 I left feeling pretty confident about my score , but I heard that my professors are very strict graders , so I'm a bit nervous . 
 You know me ; I'm always studying ! 
 Thanks for the vote of confidence , Justin ! 
 It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld . 
 Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ? 
 I've had that problem too many times . So I learned to save.When I'm writing something , I save every three sentences or so . I don't want to lose anything . 
 What are we going to do now ? 
 I wonder how much of the city is down . 
 Maybe . But if there's a blackout , probably the pubs are closed.And besides , I know you have a political science exam tomorrow . I thought you had a lot of reading to do . 
 I have a flashlight in my closet . If you want to use that to read , you can . 
 Sorry , Mr . Black . I ’ m trying to make them quiet . 
 Sorry , sir . Believe me , everything will be all right . 
 I'm sorry . I won't do it again . 
 I shall . I wasn't as careless as John Sampson . He walked across that wet cement over there . 
 The headmaster asked them not to do so . 
 They went to their stores to get one . Here they come with it now ! 
 you don't look too well . Maybe you should take the day off from work . 
 do you feel ok ? 
 why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some seat or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now . 
 you're really hot . Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down . 
 Zach , what's that on your arm ? 
 it looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ? 
 I completely forgot about your cat allergy . I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . Oh no . we'd better go to the doctor to get some medicine . Let's go . 
 we would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse . 
 Craig , what do you do for work ? 
 What school do you go to ? 
 That's a good school . What do you study ? 
 How long have you been studying English ? 
 That's a long time . 
 No wonder your English is so good . 
 I see . Talking with other people is very important . 
 I'm having a party tonight at my apartment . You should come . 
 Hello , Jason , there is going to be a screening of Final Destination 3 at our campus cinema tomorrow . I plan to go to see it . 
 Yeah , I love horror movies . Would you like to go with me tomorrow ? 
 That's funny , I didn't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside . 
 Alright , all joking aside , what kinds of moves do you like ? 
 That is to say , you like all genres except for horror movies . 
 Not quite . I also greatly enjoy romance and comedy . 
 Really ? I haven't heard of it . 
 Ok . I can't wait to see it . Let's go ! 
 Yeah . People always enjoy the lighted lanterns and the gala performances . 
 Did you notice the characters on the lanterns ? 
 They are puzzles . It's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the Lantern Festival . 
 It's really eye-catching . It's the biggest dragon lantern I've ever seen in all my life . 
 Very impressive . It's made of glass which makes it even brighter . 
 Let me have a look . Oh , no . They are Chinese poems which describe this happy scene . 
 Of course not . I believe he ’ s innocent . 
 He nursed a viper in his bosom . His best friend Tony foamed him in . Tony first seduced his wife and then trapped him . 
 For me , the times of chatting online has gone . 
 I opened my blog today . In order to have more visitors , I have to land on others ' blogs and leave my messages for their blogs . 
 Do you still remember Justin ? 
 He seemed to be dumped by his girlfriend . I found his blogs were a little sad . 
 Will you be okay when you immigrate to America ? 
 What about your parents ? 
 So , how's your work ? 
 I am going to resign . A few of the new staff have already left . Obviously , a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries . 
 But we have a policy of paying according to seniority in the company , so new employees get quite low salary , no matter how excellent they have done . 
 That's why I am going to leave . 
 I am worried about my future . I can't believe that our company is as big as it is . The company can only continue to grow by taking care of its staff . 
 Thank you . I will . 
 My first grandchild . 
 Do you think so ? Well , I guess . He does look a lot like me . Oh , he ’ s got Richard ’ s eyes though . 
 Well , children usually resemble their parents . 
 You often like comparing children with their parents . 
 Hello . 
 Sure , just a minute.Mark , you're wanted on the phone . 
 Hi ! This is Jill.How come you didn't come in today ? 
 That's too bad.You ' ll have to be more careful nest time . 
 No , nothing special.Oh , yes , you know Bill , The guy with the moustache.His wife had a baby girl last night and he passed out cigars to everyone today , He said his wife and daughter are doing fine.The baby is their first child . 
 Yes , we have to.Do you think you can make it tomorrow ? 
 You're welcome.Bye . 
 I like music that has a fast beat and is lively , like dance music . You know , I go to a disco almost every week . Sometimes it ’ s too loud though . You prefer classical music , don ’ t you ? 
 I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music . It ’ s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music . 
 really ? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often . I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress . 
 I ’ Ve got a few classical music CD ’ s . I should follow your lead and increase my brain power . 
 that ’ s a good idea . You should do the same with some music . You might find something you like . Classical music might make you clever , but dance might make you livelier and happier . 
 Hi ! Wang Mei.Come and have a look at my new dress . 
 Thank you for saying so . 
 I bought it in a store near my school . 
 It's only thirty yuan . 
 I'll go together with you . 
 I see . Well , can I have a look at your phone ? Unfortunately , this phone can ’ t be used in the US , it ’ s not compatible with our 3G network . 
 Well , you ’ re in luck ! You see , if you sign up for our three-year plan , we ’ ll throw in a handset for free . 
 There ’ s no catch ! You just choose a plan , sign a three-year contract and , that ’ s it ! Actually , we ’ re running a special promotion right now , and we ’ re giving away a Blackberry Curve with our special Mega Value forty dollar plan . 
 Well , you get nine hundred anytime minutes , and you can also enjoy free mobile to mobile calling to other Tel-Mobile clients , one thousand text messages per month , and unlimited evening and weekend minutes . Oh , and we also offer a rollover option . 
 That ’ s right , plus the activation fee , the emergency services fee , the monthly service fee , oh , and any charges for extra minutes , and ... 
 Why do you have to leave early ? 
 Could you make it up by attending my other section this week ? 
 Are you leaving right away or can you stay for a few more minutes ? 
 OK , but please make sure that you get all of your make-up work completed . 
 Go do what you have to do , but make sure it doesn't happen again . 
 The last straw , huh ? 
 I know what you mean . 
 How nice of him ! 
 I think so . Blue is still very fashionable at the moment . 
 I think this kind of dress will stay in fashion for a few more years . People don ’ t change fashions every year . It would be too expensive . 
 There are some real fashion victims who just have to keep totally up-to-date with expensive clothes . 
 I know what you mean . The situation will be worse if we marry our boyfriends and have children . The we ’ ll have even less money to spend on fashionable clothes ! 
 You are kidding ! He just broke up with Ann . 
 I hope I will meet her soon . 
 So what ? Are we going anywhere ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry I forgot all about it.Well , can I take a rain check ? 
 I'm terribly sorry , Rose.But I have to finish this paper by tomorrow or professor Martin will kill me . 
 Why ? Just read your notes.You can see what the professor stressed in the lectures.Probably the exam will ask about things he stressed . 
 Let me see them.Are these all the notes you have ? 
 But Laurie , how can you do well in school if you don't take more notes ? 
 I'm sure you don't write enough.Look at this . Here you wrote , Russian Revolution . 1917 . Bolsheviks . Real revolution , or coup ? And that's all ? I remember he lectured for a half hour about that question.And you didn't write any of it ! 
 Yes , but did you remember ? You need good notes to help you remember . 
 There are different things you can do.For one , the university offers a special free course on note-taking.You should go to the course . Also , I am pretty good at taking notes . I can help you on this exam . I will photocopy all my notes , and you can compare them to your notes.Then maybe you will see what kinds of things to write down . 
 Don't feel that way . I know you are very smart.Note - taking is a special skill . All students need to learn it.Some people are very smart , but they just haven't learned how to take notes yet . I'm lucky because I had a good English teacher in high school.She taught me how to take good notes . It's not hard . 
 What are you grinning about ? 
 I thought mom said no dating till you are 16 . 
 All of your friends , what are you planning to do ? 
 What a party ! I hope you don ’ t expect the girls to fish . 
 This is my friend Jenny . 
 It's Snow . 
 They're blue . 
 It's brown . 
 She's 42 . 
 Yeah , I'm OK , I have been having a lot of mood swings lately . I think it has to do with the pills my doctor prescribed that are causing chaos on my hormones . 
 Yeah , it's weird . For example just this morning I was feeling detached and lonely , even though there was really no reason to feel that way . 
 I hope you are right . 
 Isn't it lovely ! That's when she got her Master's Degree from Miami University . 
 Oh , that's a nice one of all of you together . Do you have the negative ? May I have a copy ? 
 No . I'd like a slide , I have a new projector . 
 Have a wallet size print made for me , too . 
 Michael Jackson's coming to town . 
 What do you like to do with your free time ? 
 You mean you like to study English ? Why ? 
 Studying English wouldn't give me any satisfaction . It's hard work . 
 David , would you like something to eat ? 
 Do you want something to drink ? 
 Sorry , I don't have any coffee . 
 A small glass , or a big one ? 
 Here you are . 
 You're welcome . 
 I came two years ago after I graduated from college . This is my first job . 
 Of course ! Everyday , there is a deadline to meet . Bosses watching and testing me all the time , not liking in college , handed in paper months later and tested on schedule . It is so busy . But anyway , I have trying my best to be a good employee . 
 It is so encouraging to hear this remark . The secret is to make plans . Write down your goals , short-term and long-term and make detail plans for a week or a month . Then just work hard . 
 I'm back . My bid on the Buddha is still the highest ! 
 Don't you want to hear more about my statue ? 
 His name is not fat boy ! You can be so rude sometimes . 
 I said he was nothing but a yeoman . 
 Yes . 
 He always wears an extremely becoming suit with tie . 
 A light brown suit and a pink tie today , and a light blue shirt and a blue tie yesterday . A perfect match ! 
 Match is important ; well , the way of tying is also important . 
 My father wears a tie every day , but he can ’ t do it himself . My mother helps him with his tie every morning . 
 There is a tornado warning on . My mother just told me she heard it on the radio . 
 It means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area . 
 No . Not necessarily in town . But in southern Wisconsin somewhere . A tornado has been spotted . They have two stages here.This is what is called a " tornado watch . " That means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado . 
 Yes . People should look out , because maybe there will be tornadoes coming.So it's called a " watch . " 
 Yes . If a tornado has been spotted , they announce a " tornado warning " . So if there's a tornado warning on , it means a tornado is out there somewhere . 
 Well . Tornadoes can be dangerous , it's true.If we hear something like a loud train coming , then we have to go in the basement . 
 That is what tornadoes sound like . They sound like trains . They're very loud . 
 Maybe . It depends on the tornado.Some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour.That is very fast . Others aren't so fast . 
 I've only seen one in my life . I was looking out the window . It was around two miles away . It was very interesting to watch.But it was heading toward my friend's house . So I quickly called them on the phone . 
 No , it didn't . But they are glad I called them . 
 They were all sitting in the living room watching TV.They had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house.If it had hit them , they could have all been killed . 
 Not so many really . But a lot of houses are destroyed sometimes . 
 That's right . And his wife is a baby doll , too . She used to have many followers . 
 Nothing of the sort . I can't hold a candle to her . 
 Why am I always the last to know these things ? 
 No , but Bean did send me like a hundred forwards today . My mailbox must have been overflowing . 
 He not only sent me nasty e-mail , but he's so bored , he even asked me to search the Net for even more forwards for him ! 
 I've tried , but I can't stand the bald man talking so loudly in the program . 
 Don't be so irritable . I just don't understand the program , that's all . 
 Ok . I will wait until you have had your fun , if that's what you want . 
 How did your interview go ? 
 If you get the promotion , what will your new title be ? 
 Will you get a pay-raise , too ? 
 That makes sense . Who interviewed you ? 
 What kinds of questions did she ask you ? 
 The second one sounds rather difficult to answer . What did you tell her ? 
 Those are good answers . How did she react ? 
 What do you think about her as a boss ? 
 You're lucky . Not everyone has such a great boss ! 
 When you find out you get the promotion or not , let me know . 
 What's this then ? 
 But this should have been handed in last Thursday . 
 Well , what's your excuse then ? 
 Oh , Yes ? 
 Our unit is participating in a fundraiser this weekend and would like to borrow the van , if possible . 
 It will be at the beach by the pier . 
 We will only be needing it for Sunday . 
 The only two drivers will be Mary and I . 
 Sure . We also would like to use the chairs from the lunchroom . Would that be OK ? 
 Hi , what ’ re you reading ? 
 No , not that one . But I saw the movie . Could I borrow it when you finished . 
 Oh , I ’ m crazy about them . 
 Kobi Bryant and Shaquille O ’ Neal , they are the Los Angeles Lakers ’ star players . 
 Wait a second . He shoots , he scores ! 
 Here comes Jordan , though . 
 Yeah . He ’ s older , so he doesn ’ t slam , as much as he did when he was younger , but when he does , it ’ s still amazing . 
 The Lakers . Jordan is the only good player Washington has . 
 Oh , they're fine , still very active and enjoying their retirement . 
 Sure , thank you . 
 Thank you , Bob ! This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many , a series of unprecedented meteorological events occurred around the world . In Switzerland , a major avalanche was reported in the Alps . Fortunately , no one was injured . Due to to the extreme cold this winter , a blizzard has struck the US Midwest , causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled . Moving to to Latin American , Ecuador has suffered a six month drought that has not only affected farming , but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides electricity for the entire country . In Chile , a major earthquake that registered seven point five on the Richter scale struck the southern region . Losses are reported to be in the billions . Authorities have not yet released an official statement . 
 I ’ m afraid not , Bob . One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted , causing major floods and landslides in the region . Meanwhile , Mexico ’ s coast has been hit by hurricane Liliana and officials say that all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami may hit Central America , affecting Honduras , Guatemala and Panama . That ’ s all the news we have for today , but stay tuned for updates on the six o ’ clock news . Back to you Bob . 
 I thought you had forgotten . 
 Thank you honey , it means a lot to me . 
 So he is . But , why not try to help him to become stronger ? 
 My friend Jane is very beautiful . 
 Perfect . And I like her charming eyes , too . 
 Dark blue . 
 Twenty . 
 No , I don't think so . 
 No . It's no problem.Are you American ? 
 No . I'm from Taiwan . Can't you see ? 
 I don't think so . You are flattering me . 
 Are you flying home ? 
 You were visiting Taiwan ? 
 Really ! You live in Taiwan ! 
 May I ask what your job is in Taiwan ? 
 Of course . It's a good school . How long have you lived in Taichung ? 
 It must be strange for you to live in Taiwan . 
 No . Well , I don't know.But Taiwan is so crowded . Don't you miss life in America ? 
 This is my first day here . 
 I started school somewhere else . 
 I started at PCC . 
 My grades weren ’ t good enough to go here . 
 I loved PCC . 
 I ’ m excited to be here . 
 It's very nice . I haven't heard live music in a while . This is fun . 
 Of course . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer ... 
 You're dancing so well . 
 When did you learn to dance ? 
 It's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz . 
 The Bible says that Jesus Christ was resurrected three days after he was crucified . People commemorate that at a festival called Easter . 
 We celebrate it on the first Sunday after a full moon on or after the 21st of March . 
 We make a lot of Easter eggs and then paint some designs on them . We'll also go to church and pray . 
 Morning , Bob . Fancy meeting you here ! 
 Well , I thought I'd come to see you , so here I am . 
 Fine , just fine . And you ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . Take care of yourself . 
 Sounds wonderful . When shall we make it ? 
 OK . 
 Thank you . 
 It was a real red letter day for you . 
 What are your hobbies ? 
 Like what ? 
 it's a lovely day , isn't it ? 
 is she American ? 
 so I take it you two are hitting it off ? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ? 
 sounds like you've got some competition . You made a move already ? 
 that's nice . Having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage , eh ? 
 good luck ! 
 Hi ! I'm Hong lei . What's your name ? 
 Hi Ricky . Are you a new student here ? 
 No , I've been here for six months . 
 It's not so long really . What class are you in ? Intermediate or ... ? 
 I'm in Advanced One . Who's your teacher ? 
 Ah ! Does she wear glasses ? 
 That's probably Anne Wallis . 
 No . But she taught me last term . How long have you been here ? 
 Wow , not long . Where do you live ? With a family ? 
 Yes . Actually my friend has a spare room in here apartment and she's looking for a flatmate . Would you like her phone number ? 
 Guess what ? I've got great news ! 
 Well , you know how I've been working at the Economist as a proof-reader , right ? 
 Well , the editor-in-chief heard that I had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if I was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him . 
 She said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back . 
 It's a monthly magazine , but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly . 
 Yes , but I'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again ! 
 I don't have any with me , but I think I could manage to bring a free copy home for you . 
 Me , too . Do you want to go out to celebrate my good news ? 
 Perhaps we could go to the library festival that's going on at the local bookshop . 
 You've got to be joking ! It's the teacher's right to say anything wants , and if she saw Myra cheating , she certainly had the right to say so . 
 You're right.If I were the teacher , I wouldn't have done that . 
 Um ... It's wonderful to be here . Uh ... this place looks really cozy . 
 Maybe ... 
 Is that a kind of alcohol ? 
 Great . My face will turn even redder ! 
 Uh ... I mostly just like to listen . You're the groom . Why don't you go first ? 
 How about As long as You Love Me ! You can pretend you're singing it to your fiancee Brooke ! 
 Are you free tonight ? 
 Would you please go to a dancing party with me ? 
 As a matter of fact , I haven't danced for a long time . 
 Thanks for flattering me . I think you dance a lot , right ? 
 What are your favourite dances ? 
 How about samba ? 
 Then I'll see you at six . Is that all right ? 
 See you then . 
 Yes , I'd love to . It ’ s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good . 
 Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . Which films do you think will win awards this year ? 
 You ’ re right . This year should be much more exciting than usual . What ’ s you favourite award category ? 
 It ’ s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood . I like the “ best actor and actress ” . 
 Wow ! Why so much ? I thought they were getting you an assistant . 
 They ’ re really running you into the ground . Why don ’ t you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere . 
 Wow ! Why so much ? I thought they were getting you an assistant . 
 They ’ re really running you into the ground . Why don ’ t you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere . 
 Wow ! Why so much ? I thought they were getting you an assistant . 
 They ’ re really running you into the ground . Why don ’ t you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and go away somewhere . 
 Don ’ t dress like that . You ’ ll make fool yourself . You look stupid in that robe . 
 Maybe it is . But it ’ s out of fashion . 
 Let ’ s go downtown and pick up some fashionable clothes for you . 
 Sorry , I can ’ t . 
 I ’ d like to . But I ’ m afraid I can ’ t . 
 That sounds great . 
 No . I ’ d better not . 
 Because I don ’ t think my husband would like it . Thank you for inviting me anyway . 
 Don't worry yourself too much . 
 Too ... your face is really oily ... perfect ! 
 Nope . I'm going to tell your fortune . So ... the oilier , the better . 
 It's facial paper , and it fits into the rings of my binder ! It's magical . 
 Have you finished your work ? 
 Where is the baby ’ s mother ? 
 Bob , how about joining the boxing club this summer vacation ? 
 So let's get registered tomorrow . 
 I'm sure he was off-side . 
 I think he favors the host team . 
 What do you think of the former champ ? 
 No champion can remain at the top for ever . 
 I want to say goodbye to everyone . 
 I ’ m catching the 9 fifteen train tomorrow morning . 
 You really don ’ t need to . 
 I hope so , too . Thank you , Lily . Thank you for everything . 
 Please say goodbye to the rest of the family for me . 
 Thank you . Remember to look me up if you ’ re ever in Washington . 
 Goodbye , then . Thanks again for everything . 
 He ’ s fine . He retired last week . It ’ s turning point in his life . Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement . 
 Oh , I don ’ t think he wants to . He wants to travel to several different countries around the world . 
 How do you want to spend your old age ? 
 You're not looking happy.What ' s the matter ? 
 With the job ? 
 A good suggestion for you.You need a holiday . 
 What do you mean ? 
 You need a holiday.That ' s what's the matter . 
 Delicious ! Did you make this chocolate cake yourself , Fred ? 
 It's really good . 
 Why not ? 
 What is its national anthem ? 
 Can you sing the song ? 
 Beautiful day , isn't it ? 
 I wish it would stay this way for the weekend . 
 You must be pretty excited about your trip to Europe . When is it that you are leaving ? 
 Like what ? 
 You are not going to give it up , are you ? 
 I don't blame you . Perhaps you could sublet it . 
 Mmm ... let me think . Oh , I know just a person . An old colleague of mine , Jim Thomas , is coming here to do some research this summer , from June to August . 
 Tell you what , I'll be calling Jim late this week anyway , so I'll mention it to him then . 
 How is your new car ? 
 Why do you say so ? Can I see your new car ? 
 Wow , this new car is dynamite ! It is a shiny , beautiful car . 
 The car has very sleek lines . I love it . 
 You made a good choice . 
 Well , my watch says five past two , but it's no use relying on it , because it has been gaining and losing these last few days . 
 Yes , I will . 
 Everything seems to be getting worse . I don't know what to do with it . 
 But how can I prevent a deficit ? 
 OK , OK . I ’ ll do my best . 
 I know life is not all roses , and I believe I will pull this through . 
 How are you , Sue ? 
 Congratulations on your success . 
 And how ’ s your brother ? 
 He ’ s going to be sent to Britain to study , really ? 
 Fantastic ! Please send him my congratulations . 
 Mike , I can't catch up with our Chinese teacher very well . 
 What is that ? 
 Will they recommend me the class that suits me ? 
 That's great . I'll tell my mother about it . 
 It's very hot , the temperature is often over 40C . 
 Not really.But I like it in spring and fall . I don't like it in winter . 
 The winter is very rainy , I don't like the rainy day . 
 I lived there for three years . I like summer but I don't like winter . 
 Yes , it is.But it's nice in spring and fall . 
 ... Who you were with ? I didn ’ t know whom you were with . 
 Sorry , it ’ s from the Godfather . It ’ s when the , when the movie producer realizes Tom Higgins had emissary of Vito Corleone , it ’ s just before the horse ’ s head ends up in the bed with all the bloody sheets , you know , wakes up , and AAAL ! Never mind . 
 Why would I spy on you ? 
 The entrance to our store is around the corner . And there ’ s no other way of saying that . It ’ s not the name of our store . It ’ s where it is . And you do not own the phrase around the corner . 
 Look , the reason I came into your store is because I was spending the day with Annabell and matt . And I was buying them presents . I ’ m the type of guy who likes to buy his way into the hearts of children who are his relative . And there ’ s only one place to find a children ’ s book in the neighborhood . That will not always be the case . And it was yours . And it is a charming little bookstore . You probably sell what 350,000 worth of books in a year . 
 We ’ re on our own tonight , dad ’ s taking mom out . 
 You know on a date , they are going to dinner . 
 Yeah , they said they ’ re reviving the old tradition . 
 That ’ s right , once a week . Do you want to order some pizza ? 
 No . Only for a couple of weeks . 
 I am going to register at Harvard next month . 
 I am going to major in tourism . What about you ? How long have you been here ? 
 Well . You should be able to give me some advice on where to stay . At the moment , I am staying in a hotel which is far away from the school . 
 Way to go , Mary . A lot has happened during the last few months , hasn't it ? 
 What's up with Vince and Elvin ? 
 And they're happy with that ? 
 Why don't you have dinner with me tonight ? 
 Let's say about 6:00 ? 
 Did everyone fill out their entry permits ? 
 Speaking of flight attendants , they keep smiling at me . I wonder why ... 
 That's because it's time . 
 It's time to make our wedding wish come true ... 
 Why not ? I've got the rings ready . 
 Hopefully , you'll say " yes " ... 
 I would like to return this book . 
 I would also like to check out these books . 
 That ’ s it . 
 Oh , yeah . Here you go . 
 That ’ ll be all . 
 Thanks . Have a good one . 
 What did she say ? 
 Really ? I can't believe it . 
 But I think a master degree is good enough for a girl . 
 Thank you all the same . 
 Yes ! Let ’ s go sailing and water skiing . That ’ s so exciting . 
 Yes . Let ’ s sleep on the sand . That ’ s most exciting ! 
 Why not . If I were you , I certainly would . 
 As the saying goes , work value work , play value play . All work and no play make a jucky-dull boy , you know . 
 Titanic made a hit ! It was so touching . 
 The heroin may not be attractive . I like the story , though . 
 It's too good to be true . 
 Very well . We started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done . 
 At ten o'clock on the morning of next Sunday . We have invited all our relatives to the wedding . 
 Yes , its design is very elaborate and the designer took many weeks to make it . 
 Thank you ! 
 The Palace Hotel . 
 It will be expensive , but we think it will be worth . 
 Please come in ! 
 Oh , so nice of you to come here . Have a seat . Please make yourself at home . 
 Thank you . My wife would be very happy to hear this . 
 You bet . 
 Hi , John ! I haven't seen you for ages . 
 So how have you been ? 
 We must set 1000 dollars aside each month . 
 We are going to buy our own house . 
 Hey , Jeff , where's your stereo ? 
 You must have been really hurting for cash to have done that . 
 It sounds like you weren't expecting that . 
 Well , if you need some money to tide you over until payday , I can loan you some . 
 So what are you doing for Thanksgiving ? 
 Well you know , it's a time to get together with all your family and be thankful for everything ! 
 Well , the first settlers of Massachusetts arrived there because of religious persecution from England and King James . Once in the New World , they befriended an native named Squanto , who taught them how to harvest food from the area such as corn . 
 Well , they had enough harvests for the next winter and celebration 。 They decided to have a big feast for the natives , giving thanks the land , and everyone for the foods , healthy and new lives . 
 Come to my house for Thanksgiving ! We are having turkey , pumpkin pie , mashed potatoes with gravy , and lots of stuffing ! 
 Cheers ! To our first night in our new apartment . 
 All you hear is the crickets and the breeze . 
 Well , I think it's fabulous . And the neighbors don't even seem to exist . 
 Ms . : Do you have a question , Mary ? 
 Ms . : Let me give you a hall pass for it . 
 Ms . : With a hall pass , you can go to the ladies ' room or wherever you need to go during class time . 
 Ms . : If a teacher stops you in the hallway , just show him or her the pass . 
 Ms . : That's right . 
 Don't believe him . He's a liar . 
 Exactly . 
 My friend and her fiance had a really good idea . They have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . The picture are of things they want . People sign their name by the item they will buy . 
 Most of the things were household appliance . You know , everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . I think it ’ s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help them set up home . 
 I bought a sewing machine . I know that my friend likes making her own clothes , but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems . 
 She says that after several years of use , it ’ s not working properly . When she uses it , it makes a funny noise . 
 I think it ’ s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . Because they know that we will buy the new models , the appliances don ’ t need to last more than five or ten years at most . 
 not really . Quite boring right now , actually . Mostly infomercials and public service announcements . 
 I know , I know.But my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes . It's the series finals , and I wouldn't miss it for the world ! 
 well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it . 
 I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results . 
 yeah.Oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . It should be good . 
 I ’ Ve had it ! I ’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere ! 
 That ’ s exactly what I am going to do ! I ’ Ve decided to create my own company ! I ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself ! 
 Well , no.it can ’ t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ? 
 Well , that seems easy enough . 
 Geez . Is that all ? 
 Umm . I think I ’ ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business ! 
 Sure I am . I've been writing a blog for almost three years . 
 I began blogging when I first went to the US for my graduate strides . 
 At first , I'll write about my life there . Like interesting things on the campus , travel stories , special English words that I come across . Sometimes , I'll post my pictures on my blog so my friends and family can get to know how everything's going . 
 It's random . If there happen to be a lot of things going on , I may add several new entries in a week , and if I've got nothing to share , I may leave my blog untouched for weeks . 
 Sure , since I came back from the US , I've been keeping the habit of blogging , simply to share my personal insights on any topic I like . 
 What are you doing this Saturday ? 
 Do you want to go see a movie ? 
 What's playing at the Century Fox ? 
 Should we go see it ? 
 How about ‘ Run of the Mill ? ’ 
 Why don't we go to a concert instead ? 
 Hello , My name is Candy Brown . May I have your name ? 
 Nice to meet you , too . Where are you from ? 
 I was born here . 
 It's nice talking to you . But I have to go . 
 OK . It's 15066688866 . Call me ! Bye-bye , then . 
 It's a lovely day , isn't it ? 
 I love it when the weather is like this.Why don't we sit down outside and have our lunch ? 
 I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado ; but I must admit , this sure is a nice spring day . 
 Okay.Hey , is that a dark cloud over there ? Do you think it will rain after all ? 
 If the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend.It ' s been a while since I've not really gotten some sun . 
 Thank you , but I hate having to leave here and working abroad . 
 Sometime next month . 
 What's the matter ? 
 Just relax . That's because you're new to chat . Let me take a look . 
 ZZZ means'sleepy or tired or bored ' , A / S / L is tricky , which is often used at first encounter . It's a three-word question , ' age , / sex / location ? ' 
 Wrong . lt's not a place name , but a passionate act . 
 Ahahah ... you miss her point for sure . H & K actually is an acronym for ' hug and kiss ' . 
 Yeah , seems that you have a lot to learn and memorize . 
 well , yesterday , I decided to face my fear of heights . 
 let me put it this way . I've never seen a professional sorts game in a stadium because I could never get myself to walk to the top of the stairs to sit down . 
 I went sky-diving ! 
 It was scary , but it felt great , too . 
 of course I was scared . But I had an instructor that went with me and that helped . 
 I think so . After I jumped out of the plane , I realized that I should just enjoy life . Worrying about it or not doing things out of fear is just plain silly . 
 are you scared of anything ? 
 what do you think is going to happen ? 
 it sounds like you just need to be more careful . 
 What's it ? 
 What you said gives me the creeps ! 
 How do you do , Mr . Brown ? It ’ s a pleasure to get to know you . 
 I propose a toast to the health of everyone here and to the success of our negotiation . 
 So who does he think he is , anyway , I can't believe the way that my boss has been ordering everyone around lately , I mean , it's now like he is the CEO , or anything . 
 Yikes ! you are joking , right ? I can't believe it . No wonder he is so stressed and bossy lately . I thought he was just being ostentatious by giving orders to people and all the different departments . What big shoes to fill ! 
 What does a CEO do anyway ? I know the CEO makes the most money in the company , but what does he actually do ? 
 Must be one smart guy . 
 Ha ! It's not like you've ever been one to beat around the bush . 
 No , seriously . . . I really want this . 
 I know . But things have changed . I guess I've settled down . 
 Have you ever been in an earthquake ? 
 Do you know where it measured on the Richter scale ? 
 No , but I was in quite a few tornados when I was younger . 
 I'm from the plains of the Midwest . It's a prime location for tornadoes . 
 Most of the time we were lucky , but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room . 
 Actually , some of my fon best memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass . 
 No , but my father's car was destroyed in a flood once . It actually happened the day after he bought the car ! 
 There is a tornado warning on . My mother just told me she heard it on the radio . 
 It means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area . 
 No . Not necessarily in town . But in southern Wisconsin somewhere . A tornado has been spotted . They have two stages here.This is what is called a tornado watch . That means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado . 
 Yes . People should look out , because maybe there will be tornadoes coming.So it's called a watch . 
 Yes . If a tornado has been spotted , they announce a tornado warning.So if there's a tornado warning on , it means a tornado is out there somewhere . 
 Well . Tornadoes can be dangerous , it's true.If we hear something like a loud train coming , then we have to go in the basement . 
 That is what tornadoes sound like . They sound like trains . They're very loud . 
 Maybe . It depends on the tornado.Some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour.That is very fast . Others aren't so fast . 
 I've only seen one in my life . I was looking out the window . It was around two miles away . It was very interesting to watch.But it was heading toward my friend's house . So I quickly called them on the phone . 
 No , it didn't . But they are glad I called them . 
 They were all sitting in the living room watching TV.They had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house.If it had hit them , they could have all been killed . 
 Not so many really . But a lot of houses are destroyed sometimes . 
 Yes , he married my sister ten years ago . 
 Yes , my sister loves his personality . 
 Well I always hear it on the radio , so I started to get into it . 
 I totally agree ! 
 I ’ m waiting for a bus and going for a walk in the park . 
 I always like to go for a walk before a supper . 
 Can you tell Bob from Tom ? 
 Don't you notice that Bob has a mole on his face , but Tom does not . 
 I have a problem . 
 My mattress was supposed to be delivered today . 
 The delivery people showed up four hours late . 
 I was late for work because of them . 
 I want my money back for the delivery . 
 It shouldn't be a problem . 
 Hi , my name is Pete . You are Ann . Isn't that right ? 
 Do you see that girl in the red top ? She told me who you were . 
 Yes , that's her . 
 Actually I live in London , but my family lives in Seattle . 
 Where in London do you live ? 
 I play tennis there every week . Shall we have a game one day ? 
 Every year , the South has the floods . It is an act of God . 
 Yeah , you have some other ideas ? 
 For example ? 
 Oh , I see . Fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things . 
 Oh really ? Is he all right ? 
 Poor old John ! I am ever so sorry . 
 Don't worry , but my clothes are made of leathers . 
 Thank you for your warning . 
 Be careful of yourself . 
 Well , ' Terminator ' is a really great action movie , and I like action movies because they're exciting . 
 It is pretty violent , but since it's just robots fighting one another , it isn't very bloody and so it won't gross you out . 
 So do you believe in palmistry ? 
 It's when someone takes a look at another person's palm 4 to tell the future . 
 Are you sure ? I've read a lot about palmistry and I've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . Do you want me to take a look at your hand ? 
 Ok , let's see , well , you've got a long life line , which is good , and the love line is strong ... 
 Hmm , hard to say , wait , yes , it looks like you will do well in business , and your ambition will help you a lot , but ... 
 You seem to have a large gullibility line . You believe everything that you're told . 
 I heard through the grapevine that Michael probably become the new sales manager . 
 I am not a rumor monger . 
 Melissa ? I ’ d like to invite you to my wife ’ s birthday party . 
 Her birthday is on the 9th . We ’ re going to have dinner at a Mexican restaurant , and then maybe go out dancing . 
 Hello , Janet . 
 And what is this ? 
 And when is your son's birthday ? 
 But Mark's birthday is in April so I need to think about his present soon . 
 Oh , my birthday is in December just before Xmas so of course nobody remembers . 
 Thank you very much for everything you have done for me during my stay in China . 
 The help is mutual . I must thank you to see me off . My wife and I will be looking forward to seeing you . You will come to see us , won't you ? 
 How do you usually spend your leisure time ? I mean , do you have any special interests out of your job ? 
 Yeah , you ’ re quite right and what ’ s your hobby ? 
 Oh , photography , It ’ s really a good hobby . 
 You yourself have a photo studio ? 
 Can I help you ? 
 May I know the reason , madam ? 
 When did you buy it ? 
 Can I see the receipt ? 
 Well , if there is no damage , you can return it . 
 waiting for someone . 
 you're right . He is so funny and I think I'm in love with him . 
 I know , but I keep thinking of him every day . And I get really depressed when he's not online . 
 well , this might be silly . But I just can't get him off my mind . And I can't help missing him . 
 yes . He said I'm his dream girl . 
 I know . I can't tell whether he's serious or not so I need your advice . 
 hi , Natasha , how's life ? 
 oh , you must be very happy . How many people are there in your family ? 
 I have a small family . They are my parents , my younger brother and me . 
 yes , it did . But my parents are ethnic minority people . It's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children . 
 the child must feel very longly . My younger brother is 10 years younger than me . Before he was born , I used to be the only child and always dreamed that I would have a younger sister or brother one da 
 yes , we are very close . He is 12 years old and very smart . He always makes us laugh a lot . 
 thank you . 
 Yes , there are many cities where it's almost always warm.San Diego , for example . 
 Many.Most of the cities in the southern part of the United States are hot all year . 
 Most people grow accustomed to the climate , but there are many others who complain about it all the time . 
 Several.Two good examples are Seattle , in the state of Washington , and Portland , Oregon . 
 In the north there are many cities which are very cold in the winter.Boston and Chicago are two of them . 
 Oh , no.On the contrary , there are many beautiful days , especially in the spring and fall . 
 Why would that be funny ? 
 Why ? 
 I don ’ t agree , but anyways , I think you should start thinking of a new year ’ s resolution yourself . 
 Well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives . 
 Well , I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me everyday ! 
 You don ’ t look like enjoying this workout . 
 You don ’ t like this sort of exercise ? 
 Yes , that ’ s funny . I thought you liked it . 
 Never mind . It ’ ll be over in 10 minutes . 
 Bye . Take care . 
 I'm afraid I've had a terrible row with my boss . What shall I do ? 
 Oh , but I can't . It wasn't my fault . 
 Jack , what are you doing ? 
 I can see that . But why are you reading advertisements for houses for sale ? Are you buying a house ? 
 Can I have a look as well ? 
 Oh , this one looks really good . And look at the garden . So beautiful . 
 Yes , but my house has large windows and so gets lots of sun . And it has a small balcony at the top . 
 Talking about a barbecue , didn't you say you are organizing one next week ? 
 John , do you mind helping me prepare for the picnic ? 
 Yes . It says it will be sunny all day . No sign of rain at all . 
 Okay . Please take some fruit salad and crackers for me . 
 That's great . We can also take the dragon kite with us . After the picnic , we can fly it . 
 Okay , it sounds good . 
 Oh I ’ m enjoying myself but it ’ s so hot here 
 Well it can be but Shanghai is much warmer than London . 
 Actually I think the buses and trains here are more modern . 
 Oh , I think Shanghai is much more crowded than London . 
 You got me on that one . 
 Not really ! 
 Maybe , but I think they are just for kids . 
 Maybe they don ’ t agree with my taste . 
 I ’ Ve been away on holidays for sometime . 
 I went with my husband . Our first stop was Bangkok . We stayed there for 5 days . Then we flew to Hong Kong , stopover for 3 days . Our last stop was China . We visited the Great Wall . 
 Yes . We enjoyed ourselves very much . Have you traveled much , Luke ? 
 Oh , I see . Yeah . Some people like traveling , some don ’ t . My husband didn ’ t like traveling at first , either . He said what ’ s the use of traveling ? A waste of money and a waste of time.At last I got him on the move . After all , he loved me . We went to Bali , Indonesia , one of the most beautiful places in the world . That trip left a very deep impression on him . Since then whenever we have holidays and money , we ’ d like to patronize the travel agency . Isn ’ t it a bit dull to shut yourself at one place all your life ? 
 As of today it is . Memorial Day marks the end of the school year and the beginning of summer . 
 ... and for us to get tans in our new bikinis . 
 That's smart these days with all the news on skin cancer . Hey , there's everybody ! We made it ! 
 You mean with my performance ? 
 I guess everyone has a few secrets up their sleeve . 
 I was part of a band in school . 
 Come on ! This is work . Don't you think that would be a little weird ? 
 Sure . 
 It's very exciting . I think . 
 Hey man ! Everything is just groovy baby ! 
 I wanted to , but I ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block ! I was chatting her up a bit and then we mellowed out at her place . 
 Gravy ! Jim is such a jive turkey man . He is always hitting me up for cash . Anyway , you wanna book and go grab some grub ? 
 Did you do anything fun over the weekend ? 
 Why didn't you want to go out ? 
 Did you download a movie or rent it at the store ? 
 I'm not a VIP . 
 Is there a lot of crime in your city ? 
 It ’ s the same in my city . We also have a lot of drug addicts . A lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs . 
 Some people believe that a tough approach is better . Other prefer a more lenient approach . 
 That ’ s possible , but I ’ m not sure it would really happen like that . 
 Oh , don ’ t go yet . Let ’ s at least have one more . 
 It ’ s too bad that you have to leave so early . 
 Thanks for coming ! We should meet again sometime soon . 
 Anytime . You can reach me 5558929 . 
 Fine . 
 I hope so , too . Bye ! Ben . 
 Big talk , I ’ d say . He does not have a girlfriend yet . 
 My son closed his ear to what I said . I don ’ t know what I should do . 
 I cannot have the heart to do that . 
 I'm glad to hear that . 
 Really ? I ’ m not sure that I would like all the attention . There have been numerous cases of paparazzi interfering with star ’ s private live in recent years . 
 I wouldn ’ t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice , but it would get tedious after a while . Imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you . 
 I think you ’ ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . You ’ d also have to be very careful about every word you said . If you appeared on a chat show and said something silly , it would be reported in all the newspapers and magazines . 
 That ’ s a great idea . Which charities would you support ? 
 You ’ d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity , so you ’ d really need to be very careful . Anyway , I ’ d be the first to buy your posters and I ’ d attend your first book-singing when you wrote your autobiography . 
 Have you ever thought about Tom ’ s attitude ? 
 Love me , love my dog . He ’ s a sensible kind man . 
 What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ? 
 Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows . 
 You are absolutely right . They are too brief . They don't tell you anything . 
 no , of course not . Go ahead . 
 yes , now that you mention it , I think we had a chemistry class together in high school . 
 What did you do after high school ? 
 I took a year off to go travelling . 
 I went all over the world . It was the best year of my life . Where did you go to school ? 
 Oh , did you study a foreign language ? 
 that's a very difficult language to learn , isn't it ? 
 so you can speak Chinese ? 
 I think most languages take a lifetime to learn well . 
 Oh , I feel miserable . I've got a bad cold , My head is dizzy and my nose is running . 
 As a matter of fact I have , The doctor said it'll go away after a day or two.He ' s prescribed me some tablets . 
 Yes , it helps me but I just have to wait and let my system do the work . 
 Oh , no , I'm fine.My refrigerator is piled up with food.But if it's not too much trouble for you . I'd like something to read . 
 I'd like both . 
 I ’ m sure you do miss that type of cooking . But can ’ t you try to get used to Western food ? 
 I suppose you ’ re right , Lee . Maybe that ’ s why so many Westerners are overweight . 
 You see , because we are often busy working , we eat too much fast food , and that food is very fattening . 
 Do you think that is a good idea ? 
 What are your main concerns ? 
 I know what you mean , I've thought about that myself . 
 Could you take a slight pay decrease for a chance to move forward ? 
 I think I'm convinced that trying for this position is the best choice for you . 
 It ’ s severe punishment , I think . 
 No wonder . 
 I went on a trip with my family last week . 
 We went to Europe . 
 London , Paris and a few other cities . 
 No , We didn't go there . I'd like to go there next time . 
 That's what I've heard . 
 Thanks . 
 Well , I just spend 15 minutes as so checking my stock bonds and booking an air ticket for my mother . Anyway , I have done all my work and it is about the time to leave . 
 Certainly , work always comes first . 
 Well , keep a low profile . 
 I'm having a hard time getting the information . 
 Oh , I didn't think of that . 
 Oh . 
 No , I knew it all along . He was the obvious choice . 
 A new broom sweeps clean anyway . 
 Well , my whole family is in the United States now , but we're from Costa Rica originally . 
 Actually , Costa Rica isn't in South America . It's in Central America . 
 Flight BE407 to Rome is delayed . Will passengers please wait in the lounge . 
 The time of departure will be announced as soon as possible . 
 After you . 
 That's very kind of you . 
 That is awesome . Congratulations ! I know you can make it . 
 Yes . Wait for me at the cafe down my office building . Say 5 PM , ok ? 
 See you ! 
 Yes , I am . 
 I'm going to be a clerk . 
 He works in an office . He writes letters and reports , and he types . 
 A-what ? 
 Good gracious ! What's that ? 
 I once read a story about a person who talked to animals . It was very interesting . 
 Hello Todd . 
 Australia ? Oh , there's about twenty million people in Australia right now . A little bit under , but close to twenty . 
 The biggest city ? The biggest city is Sydney , then it's followed by Melbourne and then Brisbane and then I think it's Perth . But most of the big cities are on the East Coast of Australia . And Perth is on the west coast , but sort of of out there by itself . 
 I like Brisbane . I had my teenage years in Brisbane , growing up in Brisbane , um or maybe Sidney because it is a big city , but Brisbane has got the gold coast and the sunshine . 
 Ah , Canberra is the capital city . But is not the biggest city . Sydney is the biggest city . Canberra was made sort of by the politicians so Sydney wouldn't get to crowded . It's a separate territory . 
 It's not like him to be late . 
 We are leaving on our science field trip at 8 a . m . next Monday . Do you have something to write that down on ? 
 That will be on the second of December . Be there half an hour early to get your bags on the bus . Do you understand ? 
 The bus will bring you back 6 days later on December 8th . Is someone coming to get you ? 
 We will be leaving the campground at 5 in the evening and arrive at our campus at 8 p.m.Any more questions . 
 I put all of that information in the packet . I'll give you another copy if you need one . See you on Monday ! 
 What's wrong ? 
 Then just keep your chin up . 
 I was born in Beijing , but I spent most of my childhood in London . 
 I had a pretty strict upbringing , and my parents taught at an university so they have extremely high expectations for me . 
 My parents wanted me to stay in Beijing , but I decided to go back to England . I graduated from University of Newcastle upon Tyne with a degree in Cross Culture Communication . 
 I am a journalist . I write for China Daily . 
 Yes , I'm very pleased . I've just got two tickets to see the Olympic opening ceremony . 
 I certainly am . I would have been very disappointed if I hadn ’ t got them . 
 What a good idea . I'm quite hungry . 
 Let ’ s go then . 
 The lecturer is dull , too . 
 I feel the same way . 
 What's the matter ? 
 How could you cheat on your wife ? You have been married for ten years . 
 I will try my best to persuade her to reconsider the divorce . But are you sure that from now on you will be faithful to her forever ? 
 Mary has really gotten under my skin . 
 I think I ’ m crazy about her . 
 finally we're on board ! 
 are they window seats or aisle seats ? 
 ok . But can I trade my seat with you ? I prefer the one near the window . I'm a terrible flyer . I always get airsick and can never relax until after I've landed . 
 thanks . Where shall we put our luggage ? 
 good idea . 
 ok . Hope it's a pleasant trip . 
 and no hijackers . 
 I want to have a complete relaxation this weekend . 
 Yes , exactly . 
 I like football best of all . 
 It's a very good game . 
 I only watch now . 
 I'm colin . It's nice to meet you . What do you do ? 
 I'm in between jobs at the moment . 
 I'd like to find a job with flexible hours in the IT field . 
 no . Is it difficult to find such a job ? 
 yes . I'm pretty out-going and friendly . 
 I have some . I worked in the IT department at a language school for four years in Spain . 
 yes , but not fluently . 
 I've sent my CV to dozens of companies but nobody has got back to me . 
 no , because I didn't know what I wanted to do . 
 thanks , I will . I'll see you tomorrow then ! 
 That's the new teacher . 
 She's very nice . 
 English , of course . 
 Yes.She teaches our class three times a week . 
 Not very much . 
 The Phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50 . 
 If the Phoenix beats the Rocket , it will enter the final . 
 Julie , is that you ? 
 Yes , it's me . And you're Julie Ashley . How are you ? 
 So do you ! How are you doing ? 
 Okay , let's sit over there . 
 Yes , I think so , If you want to graduated this year , you've got to take a science course . 
 Well , I have to take biology , chemistry , maps and physics . What you need is a good introductory course for non-science majors . 
 That's a problem . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve just come back from Scotland . 
 I only had time to visit Edinburgh . 
 It ’ s fantastic . 
 I went to there on business . 
 Yes , a lot of friends . 
 Yes . And I took many pictures . 
 Fine . And you ? 
 That's good . Not Evey company provides employees with training opportunity . It seems that your company wants to further develop their employees and encouragelifelong learning . 
 So , what's the problem ? 
 Yes , you are right . But one should keep learning daily to maintain our keen mental power expand our intellectual capacity . Constant learning drive us to Sharp our power of reasoning , analysis and judgement . 
 Yes , you are right . I think weekend is the time for family gathering and rest Maybe you could make that suggestion to your boss . 
 No , I don't really care too much for seminars ... I find them to be either boring ot useless . I mean , how much can you really learn in one afternoon ? 
 I'm still not too jazzed about going ... I feel kind of awkward in those cocktail party situations . 
 Now you're talking . 
 What about ? 
 You have done a lot of traveling . I'll bet you've learned quite a bit . 
 Because you can see the results with the general public ? 
 I would buy that kind of book ! 
 It was terrific.The concert was really a hit.The symphony orchestra was so good that I was completely absorbed in their performance . 
 Oh , speaking of the conductor , he is indeed a genius.He did a perfect job.His name is Menuhin , a descendent of Russian American immigrants . 
 Absolutely right.He gave a performance of Felix Mendelssohn's violin concerto.That caused a sensation.The audience were stunned by his pure tone . 
 Yes , I did . 
 Thank you , I ’ m doing much better . I ’ Ve begun organizing everything for the funeral . 
 It ’ s a lot harder than I imagined . There are many things that you have to to arrange . I booked a time and date with the funeral home , but I still have a lot of things to do . 
 No . Wendy is being cremated . She always talked about how she didn ’ t want to be buried . I already chose a cremation urn and we plan to spread the ashes in the ocean . 
 Thanks , it hasn ’ t been easy , but luckily we have life insurance and Wendy left behind a detailed will that will sort out any other legal matters . 
 Hi ! Nicole ! 
 Great . We can't keep up with the demand . 
 How about you ? 
 Then let me take you out to dinner to celebrate . 
 Do you want to bet ? 
 Nice meeting you , Kevin . I hope to see you again . 
 Sure , let's . Goodbye , then . 
 No , it sounds wrong . He was born in the 16th century . 
 1564 . 
 Not very well . He was white about the gills . 
 Yeah , but he refused to take the medicine . 
 I don't know the reason . 
 Next Wednesday . 
 Yes , I have . 
 Ten days ago . 
 Yes , he will . 
 What's the score ? 
 The Russian team needs to tie the Ukraine to get the pass for the final . 
 what are you looking for ? 
 do you know what camcorder options are available ? 
 would you like to look at the new digital camcorders that have just come in ? 
 ok . This Sony model is their newest and our most popular camcorder . Why don't you see if you like the way it feel ? 
 it's got an above-average battery life . It lasts up tp 12 hours and can be charged in 30 minutes . 
 yes , that is an option . 
 yes . I can show you examples of some footages that was taken with this camera in the dark . 
 It can record any sound that's within about 8 feet of the camera . 
 there are models that can pick up more sound than this one , but they're much bigger and heavier than this one . 
 Do you think what I did to Elvin was out of line ? 
 Elvin doesn't want any programming help . He wants all the glory for himself . 
 Did you hear the names he was calling me ? 
 Are things still going badly with your house guest ? 
 leo , I really think you ’ re beating around the bush with this guy . I know he used to be your best friend in college , but I really think it ’ s time to lay down the law . 
 Why don't you come round for a meal one evening next week ? 
 Which day would suit you ? 
 How about Thursday ? 
 Oh , about 6:00 . Will that be OK ? 
 See you on Thursday , then . 
 I'm sorry , I didn't mean to forget our wedding anniversary . 
 I know , I'm sorry . 
 Is it formal or informal ? 
 Then , you should dress well . 
 I think a white shirt with a blue tie looks nice on you . 
 Of course , the sports shoes don ’ t go with the formal occasions . 
 The brown leather shoes go well with your trousers . 
 It ’ ll be too late ; you ’ d better take a taxi . 
 What's his job ? 
 But Mrs.Smith hired him to find her lost son . 
 Let ' s got out tomorrow night . We can go to a bar and try to find you a girlfriend . 
 Maybe you just need a few pick-up lines , you know , break the ice . 
 Come on ! You can just walk up to a girl and say “ If you were a booger I \ ' d pick you first . ” 
 Fine , then you can say , “ So there you are ! I ' Ve been looking all over for YOU , the woman of my dreams ! ” 
 Yeah , so you make her laugh , you make a fool of yourself a little bit and then you buy her a drink . 
 Nice ! Let ' s go ! 
 If they all unite on a certain issue , it's the stockholders who have the final say . You'd think it might be our CEO or the workers , but in fact , the stockholders control the money so they have the most power . 
 It might not be the most efficient , but if you think about it , it makes pretty good sense . The stockholders are our investors . They own the capital in our company , so they should have say about what is done with the company . 
 Did you go to the concert last weekend ? 
 Yes , I did . I enjoyed it a lot.There was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist . 
 I only paid two dollars for mine . 
 I didn't know you liked old movies . 
 You're so right ! Today's movies are just too commercial ! 
 Why are you asking me about my boyfriend ? 
 Brad Bush ? Good for you ! 
 You mean you've never had a boyfriend ? 
 Until college ? 
 Now that it ’ s the new year , I ’ Ve decided to turn over a new leaf . 
 You got it ! I have a new job , I ’ m living in a new city , with new friends ! This is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way I live my life . 
 Well , first of all , I ’ Ve decided to stop smoking . It ’ s not that I ’ m pinching pennies or anything , it ’ s just that I ’ Ve been smoking since I was sixteen , and I think it ’ s time to stop . 
 One last thing , I ’ Ve decided to come out of the closet . 
 Why are you in such a hurry ? 
 Don't worry , do it step by step 
 Don't worry , do it step by step . 
 Hey , Frank , there is that Janet chick . 
 She sure knows how to strut her stuff . 
 And look out she's dressed . 
 No way . Her old man is rich . He buys her anything she wants . 
 I think you've lost it . 
 I admit that she is much prettier than Kate . 
 At least we agree on that . Let's go and get a drink . 
 Yes . Swimming is one of my most favorite sports , indoors or out-doors . 
 I have never thought that swimming can bring us so many benefits . I only know that swimming in great waves and deep running water can train people's spirits , and enable people to be fearless of the hardships , dangers and difficulties and become brave and staunch . 
 Yes , but not always . However , I won't let it go if I have a chance . 
 Do you really believe in that ? If they are going to focus on something , they should do it on civil rights . 
 I understand your point , but we continue to have transgressions against human rights . If so much attention weren ’ t devoted to the topic of animals , we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala . 
 Well , you are right on that point . This is the reason that I don ’ t buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products . 
 As long as you don ’ t treat it better than your wife , it ’ s fine . 
 Did Mr . Lin put you in charge of marketing ? 
 Where will it be ? 
 Is it because of trade negotiations that we can start selling in the U . S . ? 
 Great . 
 You seem excited about it . 
 Do you honestly think we can compete though ? All the computer giants are there . 
 The company will have to choose a good advertising firm.And then there's the problem of quality.How do we convince American buyers that our quality is good ? 
 Well , I hope it all works out , John . I think if you're part of the team , things will go well.But you know we'd all miss you here . So I won't say I'm happy to think that you're leaving . 
 Me ? No way . I'm dedicated to the company , but I'm not going to leave Taiwan . I'm happy here . 
 I ’ m very pleased with their performances . Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . That ’ s very fast for a kid his age . 
 He ’ s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ’ s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ’ s fine for someone hi 
 The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes . 
 They ’ re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ’ s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ’ re not very fast , but that ’ s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape . 
 I ’ d be afraid to jump from that height ! 
 It seems that they really enjoy to go faster , higher and further . 
 Five . Besides my parents and me , there are my brother and sister . 
 15 . 
 He ’ s not quite 25 . 
 Yes . 
 No . But I write to them often . 
 Once a month . 
 You ’ re in America now , my British friend . We just call it football . 
 The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked , but the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone . 
 Yeah , he tackled him so hard his helmet came off . 
 It looks like it , he ’ s getting up . 
 The Giants ? 
 Well , here we go again . 
 The Redskin ’ s quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . We ’ re losing again . 
 If I think of famous people , I think of Abraham Lincoln . 
 That's the one . He also was famous for never giving up on his goals . 
 And I also admire him for his courage in fighting for equal rights . 
 And humility . I would have liked to meet him personally . 
 I have a typical 9 to 5 job . Actually , I work a little longer than 9 to 5 most days . 
 No , I don ’ t . I get a bonus each month , depending on the value of the contracts I sign with clients . 
 We have an hour-long lunch break from 12 to 1 . we can take coffee breaks during the day . My boss doesn ’ t mind , as long as we get out work done on time . 
 There ’ s some paperwork , but most of the time we put any information onto computers . Then we can send information to each other by email or across the network . Do you work in a cubicle ? 
 I work in a cubicle too , but I I don ’ t mind it . 
 Don't shoot . I give up . 
 Really ? I thought he loved his wife very much . 
 He deserved it . 
 Speaking . 
 Hi , Rose . How ’ s everything ? 
 Sounds good . What time do you want me to come ? 
 Joanne , let ’ s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is , okay ? Let ’ s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly , so we can go our separate ways , alright ? 
 What was that ? 
 Let ’ s not go there , Joanne ! Ok , so let ’ s start with the record collection , I ’ ll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back . 
 I believe that was a wedding present to both of us , Joanne . And you hardly ever use it ! 
 Whatever ! Alright , I ’ ll concede the silly gramophone , if you ’ ll agree that I get the silver tea set . 
 Which ones ? Let me have a look . Wow , look at that ! That brings back memories ... That ? 
 ... and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet . I had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley , smiling and laughing in the rain ... 
 Oh , Joanne , are we making a big mistake ? I know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can ’ t reconcile and try again ? I still love you . 
 The motorcycle ? But that ’ s mine ! 
 Sorry , I don't know , there's something wrong with my watch . 
 In the coming , before going to work . 
 OK . I'll turn it on . 
 Well , I'm setting my watch at four . Thank you . 
 Going to the gym tonight , Mary ? 
 That sounds like fun.Would you mind some company ? 
 I'll get my things and meet you there . 
 Whose part do you think is best played ? 
 You're absolutely right ! That's the very figure I like best . 
 We're having a tailgate party I before the game . Would you like to join us ? 
 Someone brings a truck to the game and we have a barbecue right there in the parking lot out of the back of the truck ! 
 Don't worry about it ! Just come at five . 
 Well , if you insist , you are welcome to bring a potato salad ! 
 What may I do for you ? 
 You will need to apply for one . 
 You can do it right now , if you ’ d like . 
 Please fill out this application . 
 I just need to take your picture . 
 You will get it in a few weeks . 
 I ’ Ve got this really neat idea , you can hire a car and drive straight there . 
 But that ’ s the quickest way to make your plans work . 
 Would you please put that cigarette out ? I get sick on it . 
 Thank you SO much . 
 What ? 
 I ’ m sorry ? ! 
 I knew this would happen some day . 
 Well . It's not all my fault , Anna . You are responsible , too . 
 I think we can still talk . 
 Talk it easy , Anna . You really don't hate me . do you ? 
 It's a fine day today , isn't it ? 
 How nice seeing the sun back again ! The air is so fresh . 
 Well , the weather is so unpredictable this time of year . 
 Look ! It looks as if it is going to rain . 
 The weather is often quite different from the weather forecast . 
 Next Saturday ? I ’ m sorry . I ’ Ve promised to go to a Chinese Opera with my daughter . 
 Yes , Sunday sounds fine . What time ? 
 It suits us fine . We ’ ll see you then . 
 Hey , look ! They ’ re playing reruns of the 1996 Olympics . 
 He completed the first 200 / 400 double in Olympic history ! 
 Carl won the gold in the 100 , 200 , long jump , and 4x100 relay in 1984 . 
 Will you have time this Saturday evening to go to the cinema with me ? 
 What a pity ! Then how about Sunday ? 
 Then when do you think we could go out together ? 
 OK . Any time on Friday will be OK with me . 
 Come on , fellows.Let ' s enjoy my wife's cooking ! 
 Thank you ! My wife likes cooking very much . 
 Guess what ! 
 I am going to the mountains with my family this weekend . 
 Does Mr . Schmidt know he's going to become a father ? 
 Well , he has a surprise waiting for him when he gets back , doesn't he ! 
 I just saw a red van pulling into the driveway . Is that her ? 
 Sunday papers . I usually read them after coming back home from our company . 
 As you know , I am a sports fan . And these papers are famous for their sports section . So I will feel relaxed after grasping some information I am interested in . 
 Correct ! What about you , Fred ? 
 Don't overdo it . 
 I get drunk easily . 
 Yes , it's nice and bright . 
 I hope so too . 
 It's usually a bit hotter than today . 
 It's pretty cold and it often snows . 
 Let's hear the weather report later . What's the weather like in your hometown ? 
 That's quite a lovely weather . 
 Have you ever seen a hurricane ? 
 Do they often happen in your country ? 
 Oh , it's time for the weather reporter . Let's turn on the TV . 
 No , I am on business . I will spend half a month for the business . 
 I am currently working in a foreign company as a salesman . 
 Maybe . But it provides much wider space for me to improve the skills and increase the experience . What about you ? 
 Do you like your job ? 
 Which kind of news do you catch ? 
 Are you feel tired ? 
 You have to experience this if you want to be an extraordinary reporter . 
 What a charming room ! It faces south , and there's such a lovely view of the city . 
 No , I shouldn't think so.By the way , is there a socket for my razor ? 
 Is it a two-pin socket ? 
 Good , I ' Ve get a two-pin plug . 
 Aw , shucks , ma'am . 
 Mr . Mechanic , I'd like a nice Venezuelan blend this morning . 
 But really , maybe this can work . Everyone loves coffee , and everyone needs motor oil . 
 What ’ s your city like ? 
 Is the traffic bad in the city centre ? 
 What about restaurants and entertainment ? 
 Is there a lot of nightlife in your city ? 
 It sounds like a really exciting city to live in . 
 Bob ! Your eyes look bloodshot . Did you not sleep well ? 
 you have it right . Alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in China . Drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in Northern China . 
 you lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . This will endear you 
 then he must be opening his heart to the friends . In a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you . 
 When ’ re you getting married ? 
 Why so late ? Didn ’ t she want to get married this October ? 
 That ’ s really a shame . By the way , who will be the bridesmaid ? 
 Wow ! I ’ m very excited about your ceremony . 
 Good afternoon , Mr . Green . 
 I'm sorry , but he's not in , he's gone out on business . 
 Please come in for a cup of coffee . 
 I heard the film was after the novel The Godfather . 
 Mario Puku . 
 I'm always interested in how , but seldom pay much attention to who . 
 Yes , Sally . I want to do some sit-ups and perhaps get in a game of singsong . 
 I'd love it . Working out is more fun with a friend . 
 Good . If you happen to see Jim and Bob on the way see if they would like a game of singsong . 
 Give me a chance to explain . I was no my way and I had an accident . 
 I am fine . In fact , I don't have a scratch on me or my vehicle . But the other guy is in critical condition . 
 Yes , I'm serious . I'm really sorry about missing your concert . 
 Of course I forgive you . What are friends for ? Now , what am I going to do for that other guy ? 
 Autumn is the best season in Beijing you know ? 
 What is the whether like in Washington at this time of this year ? 
 Is it very cold in winter there ? 
 Does it rain a lot in summer there ? 
 How about here in Beijing ? 
 I feel it ’ s rather dry here 
 Are you from south ? 
 I see . So this is your hometown ? 
 He is really terrific ! 
 My friend Jane is very beautiful . 
 Perfect . And I like her charming eyes , too . 
 Dark blue . 
 Twenty . 
 Sure it is . Why don't we go to a park ? 
 Look how fast that car can accelerate ! 
 Hi , how are you doing ? 
 I'm pretty good . Thanks for asking . 
 I've been great . What about you ? 
 What school do you go to ? 
 Do you like it there ? 
 Good luck with school . 
 My brother joined the army last year . 
 He's tall and strong . 
 You seemed to be fed up with Mary . 
 She is a barking dog . But she means well . 
 You are unfair to her . She is a very nice girl . 
 Really ? How many do you have ? 
 That is a lot of friends . Do you have a best friend ? 
 How many best friends do you have ? 
 Hmm . I have only one best friend . 
 I have only a few friends . 
 That's very nice of you . 
 Is he beating Mark ’ s time ? 
 Give me your hand . ( takes Rose's hand ) Close your eyes . Go on . ( Rose closes her eyes ) Step up . Now hold on to the rail . Keep your eyes closed ; don't peek . 
 Step up onto the rail . Hold on . Keep your eyes closed . Trust me ? 
 All right , open your eyes . ( Rose opens her eyes . She stretches her arms , and Jack stands behind her , arms around her . ) 
 My uncle passed away last night . 
 Man , they take a lot of our paycheck . 
 Seriously . The only tax I don't mind them taking is social security . It's only a few dollars every paycheck . 
 Yeah . It won't be much , but at least we ’ ll have a monthly check when we get old . 
 Let's just hope the politicians don't figure out a way to spend it . 
 Nick ! How ’ s it going ? 
 What are you doing in this neighbourhood ? Do you live around here ? 
 It was great to meet you last week at the conference . I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment . 
 Sure , you still have my contact details , right ? 
 Sure , my name is Ana Ferris . Don ’ t worry about it , it happens to me all the time . I ’ m terrible with names too . 
 Take your pick , Julie . 
 I wish I could , but I'm busy . I'm going to work at a soup kitchen tonight . 
 Nah , it's a place where homelesspeople go to eat . 
 Well , the minister at my church told us about it , and it seemed interesting . I thought I'd try it once , and if I didn't like it I'd stop . 
 It's simple . All we do is prepare some food , usually sandwiches and some fruit , and give it out to them at the soup kitchen . 
 Only about two hours , for a couple of days a month . Why don't you give it a try ? 
 Come on , it's easy , and it'll make you feel good . Why don't you come with me tonight ? 
 Hello Wang . I'm Dou . Pleased to meet you . 
 Just call me Miao Dou , Please . 
 That ’ s great . Is the electrician here today ? 
 You ’ re right . I wasn ’ t . I hear nothing . 
 Not a sound on the city streets , just the beat of my own heart , I think that ’ s how it goes , something like that . 
 Engaged ? 
 Are you crazy ? 
 I'll come see you tomorrow . 
 Have you got any plans for the coming holiday ? 
 Volunteer in a zoo ? What specific things will you do ? 
 It must be a unique experience . I ’ m looking forward to share your story when you come back . 
 Oh , honey . You came . I'm so glad ! Why are you wearing a bonnet ? 
 They're beautiful . Taylor , you're so pale and skinny ! 
 I guess . Are you sure you're taking care of yourself ? 
 Is everything ready for Billy ’ s birthday party ? 
 Yes , I did . I ’ Ve put one on the table for each child . I put up the big “ happy birthday ” sign too . 
 I ’ m sure of that . There ’ s enough food here to feed an army ! 
 Thanks for reminding me . I ’ Ve prepared some party games for the children too . 
 Hopefully , that will keep everyone happy . 
 No , nothing . Why ? 
 Yes , I do , very much . 
 Oh , yes . I ’ d love to . 
 Sorry . You know the rules . 
 That ’ s out of the question . 
 Not a chance . 
 Sorry , it ’ s impossible . 
 Yes , I like ping-pong very much , but I can't play well . 
 Listen to this . Mary got married . 
 Yes . Yesterday . 
 She married Jerrod . 
 She ’ s going to live in Paris . 
 It was great meeting you . 
 Maybe we can meet again sometime ? 
 What's your favorite hobby ? 
 What kinds of books do you like to read ? 
 By the way , would you like to see movies ? 
 What do you do in your spare time ? 
 I just like to sleep like a lazy cat . 
 Are you sure you heard right ? 
 I don't believe you . 
 There is a new restaurant opening up in town next month . 
 My favorite , Mexican . And I've heard that the head chef is from San Paulo . 
 I can hardly wait ! 
 I'll double check the announcement . 
 I am thinking about inviting you to a dinner . When would you have time ? And what kind of food do you fancy ? 
 To thank you for helping me at work last week . If you would not have been so kind , I would not have been able to pick my parents from the airport . You really did me a big favor . Thank you so much . 
 Fine , I know a good hotpot place in the downtown area , food there is pretty spicy too . Shall we try that one ? 
 Charlotte , have you had your supper ? 
 Why ? Don't you feel well ? 
 What's up ? 
 You must not feel depressed about such a trivial thing . 
 You'd better shape up if you want to get the job done . 
 Cheer up ! Don't let me down . We all make mistakes , and that is life . 
 Busy with your work again ? 
 I'm not at all convinced . Tomorrow is Saturday ! 
 What for ? 
 Oh . I've really forgotten it . 
 A silk scarf . I love it . Thank you very much . My lovely son . 
 What do you think of your teacher ? 
 And I hear he gives very good lectures . 
 I'm so glad to meet you . 
 Fine . 
 Really ? Thank you . 
 Don ’ t ever mention him . I ’ m getting over it . 
 Are you done ? 
 Hi , Paul . I haven't seen you for a long time . 
 Fine , thank you , and you ? 
 I came to see my uncle . He lives in the next block . 
 Well , I am certainly going to take chemistry and physics , but I haven't decided on the other subjects yet . I'd like to take English . 
 Because I want to study english literature . but I think chemistry is better for getting a job . 
 I am going to be a , well , I hope to be a research chemist . 
 sorry , I'm afraid that I've got plans tonight . 
 I'm going to my parents ' house for my father's birthday . 
 it's his 50th birthday . 
 sure thing . What are your plans for the evening ? 
 well , if you can wait until tomorrow night , I'll go with you then . 
 sounds like this weekend just isn't going to work out for us . 
 sure.Hey , I'm sorry , but I've got to get going . 
 say hello to your friends for me . 
 Bye ! 
 Hi , how are you doing ? 
 Glad to meet you , Wang Lin . I am Mary . 
 Yes . My company has an office here , and I have just been transferred . 
 Great . I would like that . 
 Oh , hi Melissa . Are you going to the conference too ? I was planning to pick up Mr . Campbell . 
 Oh I see , okay . So I heard you got married . Congratulations ! 
 That sounds so romantic ! Jack and I were hoping to get married in Europe next year , but we had to postpone our plans . We just don't have the money ! 
 I sure do . In my opinion , it's actually becoming more expensive than back home . 
 What's that , a new video game ? 
 For instance ? 
 Wow ! Anything else ? 
 What if I want to use CD-ROMs or floppies ? 
 Hey , what's up ? 
 What were you writing ? 
 You mean you're going to ask her out in a note ? You big chicken ! 
 But , you work with her everyday . 
 You've dated a lot . What's so different about Diana ? 
 Well , I guess you don't want this note , then . 
 I was looking for you to deliver this note from Diana . She wants to know if you want to go to the office party with her tomorrow night . 
 Sorry . What can I say ? Now , do you want the note or what ? 
 Have a great time tomorrow night . 
 So , what happened ? 
 He stood you up . 
 Not possible . 
 Absolutely . 
 And no phone . 
 Mary , how was your date with john ? 
 Oh , really ? That is great news . What does he look like ? 
 Sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ? 
 Oh , it's love at first sight . When will you see each other again ? 
 Maybe he is busy with his work . Just wait and try not to think about it too much ! 
 Come on , Mary , you're a total catch . I bet he will call you . Don't worry . 
 That's what friends are for . 
 It's nothing to get upset about . 
 No . It's out of the question . 
 What's the big deal ? 
 Maybe it's just a blessing in disguise . I've been wanting to try a new place anyway . 
 Not a great deal . 
 For accounting system and things like that , you mean ? 
 Yes ? 
 Of course , his machine must have been connected to a computer . 
 How happy you are ! Next Monday is your wedding day . Congratulations ! 
 Fred is really a good guy . And he loves you so much . 
 He's after your own heart , it is important . 
 I promise ! 
 Thank you very much . 
 A gold watch ! 
 I love it ! Darling , you ’ re kind . 
 Goofed off ? Maybe , but I'm not a clock-watcher . I finished doing what I should do and then knock off an hour earlier . 
 I'm sure of what I'm doing . 
 You too . Have you lost some weight ? 
 Not some crazy diet fat I hope . 
 Good for you , keep it up . 
 Yes , it's to my liking , too . 
 It's my dream . 
 Hey , Andrew . How's everything with work ? 
 Really ? What's he been doing ? 
 Are you ? What are you busy with ? 
 OK , that ’ s fine . Bye . 
 That ’ s it , my lease is up . I have to move . 
 The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot 
 I think I might move in with my parents for a couple of months until I can find something . You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here . I ’ m gonna have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while . 
 Actually , would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks ? 
 Which social problem do you think the government needs to concentrate on most ? 
 How would you solve the problem ? 
 It would probably be very expensive . 
 It ’ s not a bad idea . I think education is the biggest problem at the moment . Schools don ’ t seem to have enough money to educate kids properly . 
 Most voters what everything bout ways . They want the government to pay for lots of things , but without increasing taxes . 
 Yes . The government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly . 
 But there're some mare's tails . 
 Oh , really , I thought it was a sign of rain . 
 Thanks . Does it suit me ? 
 I know . That ’ s why I bought it . I hate wearing the same styles like everybody else is wearing . 
 It ’ s very nice of you to say so . I should say you are glamorous yourself , as a matter of fact . 
 Welcome back ! How was your vacation ? 
 Where did you end up going ? 
 I've always wanted to go to Paris . The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! Did you go to the top ? 
 Sure . What's this one a picture of ? 
 You don't look very happy in that picture . 
 So what did you do ? 
 My travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . Did you go to the Louvre ? 
 That's what everyone says ! I can't wait to see it for myself some day . 
 Thank you . It has been handed down in my family for three generations . 
 It surely is . 
 He ’ s doing fine . A new broom sweeps clean . 
 I think we ’ ll benefit a lot . 
 She told me that she's got tennis practice today . 
 How did you know ? 
 I see . Do you live in this neighborhood , too ? 
 Oh , Cindy did mention you before . You're Alexander Newman . 
 What's the score ? 
 The Russian team needs to tie the Ukraine to get the pass for the final . 
 I hear that there is a festival called Duanwu in China . 
 Why are you celebrating this festival ? 
 What do you do on that day ? 
 I see . 
 It's as plain as the nose on your face . They're dating each other . 
 Well , you can bet this relationship's going to be a flash in the pan . 
 I think you are absolutely right . Actually , my father proposed to my mother after knowing her only two weeks . They got married a month later . 
 I have to have at least eighteen to keep my scholarships and grant . But so far , I only have fifteen . 
 Yes . And now I'm down to either taking a class I'm not going to need or considering a double major . 
 I think with International Business a language would be appropriate . 
 As a matter of fact , I would like to work in South America . So some Latin language like Spanish or Portuguese would work . 
 I got a character part — some old lady who shows up in a few scenes . 
 Are you kidding ? You got the leading role . 
 I would trade you if I could but I don't think I'd be a very convincing macho A . 
 I do a good old lady . I wouldn't mind being the damsel in distress once in a while . 
 Oh , thank you very much . I ’ d like to come , but I ’ m afraid I ’ m busy that evening . 
 Well , I ’ m not too sure , actually . I ’ Ve got a lot going on the next couple of weeks . Why don ’ t I call you later ? 
 Which season do you like best ? 
 I prefer summer , especially the summer evenings . When the sun comes down , it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . After a rain shower , the smell of the air is refreshing . It is also a best reason for ice-cream . 
 Well , I have to hide in the air-conditioned rooms . Anyway , it is all worth , just think about the cool evening time . 
 Yeah , really , jane and ted always have great parties . 
 Oh , so you're a teacher . 
 I'm in the car business . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 Nice to meet you , I'm jim taylor . 
 Yeah . Whatever became of him ? 
 That's great . We should visit him some time . 
 OK . See you . 
 I'd like to speak to the Ms . Collins , please . 
 This is Nathaniel Brown . 
 I'd like to talk to her about my accommodation situation . 
 Ok . 
 Sure . Can you have her call me back on my cell phone number ? 
 It's 0-7- 7-8- 7-3- 6-7- 6-8- 8 . 
 No , there's no double six at the end of the number . It's just zero , double seven , eight , seven , three , six , seven , six , double eight . 
 Anytime before 6 pm tonight . 
 Thank you ! 
 bye ! 
 Is everything OK ? 
 Come in ! Quickly ! 
 What do you mean ? 
 Security , Dan , security ! You can never be too safe you know ! A lot of sickos out there . Just the other day they caught that peeping tom red handed ! Had a high power telescope and binoculars by his window . 
 Paranoid ? I ’ m not paranoid ! I ’ m cautious ! You see Dan , we have to be on guard at all time ! People just invade your privacy as if they knew you ! Telemarketers , solicitors , even your bank ! They have way too much information ! I like to keep everything on a need to know basis . 
 You are being watched ! Be careful Dan ! Be careful ! 
 I'm sorry to have made you disappointed . 
 Was I ? Sorry , I didn'y mean to be . I do apologize . 
 Forgive me darling . I'm very tired . 
 Hi , John ! I haven't seen you for ages . 
 So how have you been ? 
 Hey , let's go to the night market after work tonight . 
 That reminds me I should buy some new socks to go hiking this weekend . 
 Do you have to remember every text ? 
 Good Lord ! Look at that man . 
 He's swimming in the cold sea . He must be very strong . 
 How about a movie tonight ? 
 Does 7 o'clock suit you ? 
 How about a snack after work ? 
 Would you rather stay home ? 
 Are you really interested in doing something ? 
 Have you bought another handset 
 This is silver gray , while I remember your handset was black . 
 Can a handset case be changed ? 
 How many cases are accessible ? 
 It's really going to be fresh all the time . 
 I'd love to go out with you , but I'm sorry I'm busy tonight , but I'd like a rain check . 
 I want to change my job . 
 Well , I want to earn more . 
 Not only that . The job I ’ m doing now is the most boring job you can imagine . 
 Can I get you another blanket ? 
 I'll turn the heat up . 
 Do bullfights interest you much ? 
 So I ’ Ve got two tickets to the latest show but I need a little favor from you . 
 There is a wonderful opera today . I'd like to see it . 
 ' The sound of music ' . This music is known by everybody and is suitable for all ages . It is about a happy family without sex , violence or bad language . 
 Yes , you are right . I like the song in the movie , edelweiss , do you remember it ? 
 Those young actors play the roles perfectly . 
 No , I am asking you whether you will go to see it . 
 Would you like to come out with me tonight ? 
 Tomorrow night , then ? 
 I ’ m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then . 
 Ok . How about give me a ring , then ? 
 Why not ? 
 You look like a basket case . 
 What's the problem ? 
 Yeah , and ? 
 Why ? 
 I guess you think twice next time he comes . 
 So how long has he here for ? 
 Well , I know you do the right thing . 
 Hi , Steven . Do you have time and chat with me ? 
 The new couple next door divorced . Have you heard about it ? 
 I guess it Is Mrs Hill . She sued for divorce on the grounds of her husband's misconduct with his secretary . 
 OK . I close my mouth . 
 I just broke up with a girl . Why didn't she understand that I loved her ? 
 I don't know . She always said I didn't love her , but I did . 
 I have asked for a talk again , but she refused and said she wanted to be quiet . 
 I like your sweater . It suits you very well . 
 She certainly has the taste . 
 What are they ? 
 Wow ! 
 Two waves ? 
 And the other half come in later to pick up the second wave . 
 What ? What did you buy ? 
 What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? 
 And ? 
 And it's a brick ? 
 I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? 
 So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . 
 But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? 
 Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! 
 That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . 
 I'm sorry for being late . 
 About what time can I go to my own class ? 
 Now that it is all over . can I go now ? 
 That's too bad ! 
 You bet . I'm really excited . 
 I'm just watching some television . 
 Me too . Do you think we are boring people ? 
 That's right . What do you think we should do as a hobby ? 
 I like to play the piano for fun . 
 Hobbies are great . I'm going to make a list of all the things I like to do . 
 Have you had any kind of punishment in your college ? 
 What was it for ? 
 How do you like my new sports car ? 
 If I won the Pools , I'd go round the world . 
 What would you do ? 
 One thing's certain . If I had a lot of money , I wouldn't work any more . 
 As I said , I'd go round the world . 
 Oh , I don't know . It'd take me a long time to go round the world . 
 Anyway , we haven't won the Pools , and we're not likely to win them . So there isn't much point in talking about it , is there ? 
 And my wife would be happy if I bought her a mink coat . 
 What'll you have ? 
 I'd have a Scotch if I were you . We deserve it . 
 do you like animals ? I really like dogs . 
 why ? I think cats are ok . 
 I like wild animals . I don ’ t like spiders and snakes . I think spiders and snakes are disgusting . 
 I think bears are wonderful . Pandas are fantastic . I low the people who kill them for their fur . 
 really ? I don ’ t see the attraction . I ’ m afraid of mice . 
 Yeah , it happened a week ago . 
 Fortunately , she's not seriously injured . 
 Thank you for inviting me . 
 A glass of white wine would be fine , thank you . 
 What does his dad say ? 
 Do you think children watch too much Tv ? 
 Perhaps I should impose a limit on how much Tv my kids can watch . They don ’ t do much else in their free time . At least they always do their homework first . 
 They could go out and play with their friends . 
 Perhaps I could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . He watches too much Tv too . 
 Did you meet the new girl in our sales department . She is taking the place of Maggie during her alternative leave . 
 I guess not , They haven't officially introduced her to the whole staff yet , she barely started yesterday . 
 If the new girl is competent , maybe they will promote her when that time comes . 
 not much . I'm just trying to hook up to the internet . I'm having a few problems though . 
 I've got all the cords plugged in , but it appears that I'm offline . 
 actually , I've got a wireless connection . 
 I hook up to the Internet every day . I can't believe I didn't do that . 
 No , but I'd like to . Do you have to pay to do instant messaging ? 
 what do you do if people want to talk to you online but you don't want to talk to them ? 
 what's your email address ? I'll add you to my contacts list . 
 cool . We can meet up in a chat room sometime or just chat online using messenger.thanks for your help . 
 I ran into a glass door yesterday . 
 You have been here for how long ? Four months now ? 
 Do you know Chinese better now ? 
 Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere . 
 A shouting match ? You ’ re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ’ t believe it . 
 Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don ’ t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it ’ s quite natural to us . 
 That guy's manner really turns me off . 
 Maybe he's abnormal . 
 I'm fed up with his endless talking . 
 I can't see it . 
 No . As far as I can remember he was supposed to be on a business trip to Lisbon . 
 Maybe you'll call his home . 
 Uh , I don't know what to say . What do you want to know ? 
 Let me think a minute . I think I always try to take every chance to practice . 
 Well , I talk to myself . That is , I play one role first , than the other . 
 How's your new car ? 
 You made a good choice , then ? 
 No regrets ? 
 I'm glad you're so happy . 
 Now that you'recommending such enormous fees , producers , directors , movie-makers must see you in a completely different light . 
 Then the standard that you set yourself originally must have changed . 
 It seems to me that now you're famous . You've got to go out and be seen at the right places and go to the right parties . 
 Then fans don't see you much in public places . 
 A lot of people compare you to Julia Roberts . I wondered if there was anyone that you compare yourself to in Hollywood , that you've watched and thought , ' Well , they've got something I could use a little bit or could learn a little bit about . ' 
 When do children start school in your country ? 
 But thats only in the cities , isnt it ? 
 Can kids in the countryside get equally good benefits and education like those in the cities ? 
 The baby is crying again . 
 How can you do so ? Perhaps something is wrong with him . Let ’ s go and see him . 
 Oh that ’ s a lovely necklace . 
 Oh I didn ’ t know you were married . 
 Oh I see . That ’ s nice . Did you meet your husband at work ? 
 Hi ! Is that the new laptop you brought last week ? It looks very nice . 
 Here ? In this cafe ? How can you do that ? 
 That ’ s great . Can you do it anywhere ? 
 So , what programs do you have on your laptop ? 
 I know you are keen on photography . It ’ s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone , anywhere , at anytime ! 
 Nice and warm again , isn ’ t it ? 
 How are you these days ? 
 Fine today , though a bit under the weather last week . 
 Can you believe I'm going to America ? 
 Yes , I'm really excited . 
 I have an idea . 
 You just turn a deaf ear when she talks . 
 So are you . 
 I feel exactly the same way as you . 
 What ? You don ’ t love me ? Me , either . 
 No . 
 I know , I know . Well , is there some , is there someone else ? Oh , that woman on television , Sydney Ann . 
 She'd better drink plenty of hot water and lie in bed . 
 Don't worry . She will be all right . 
 Oh , yes , it is . Thank you . I was looking for it just now . 
 Have you ? 
 Just two blocks away , in that tall building . 
 My family move in just two weeks ago . We live on the fourth floor . 
 I ’ m Chen Ming . 
 I ’ m glad to meet you , Mr . Song . 
 No , I ’ m going to the airport to meet some friends from Beijing . 
 How can I forget my old friend ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 A new candy shop just opened around the corner last week . They have a variety of candies and it is always full of people . 
 Are you serious ? It is always crowded with many people . 
 Look at the candy bar over there . It is so colorful and tasty . 
 I want to get a big bag and buy a little of everything . 
 To be honest , I care only about whether I can have some delicious candy eat . I couldn't care less about whether the shop is popular or not . 
 That is true . Speaking of cavities , I am starting to feel something is wrong with my teeth now . Let's get more strawberry chocolate drops before we go home . 
 Who do you think will win the championship ? 
 There's a game on tonight . You want to watch it with me ? 
 Good morning miss . Wang 
 It ’ s a beautiful morning isn ’ t it ? 
 I hope it won ’ t be too hot , I can ’ t stand the heat 
 You are very late , but I was on pins and needles the whole time . 
 Look at these newlyweds . They seem as if they are on top of the world . 
 People who have just got married feel that the world is right before them . 
 What would you say if I told you I was going to quit school ? 
 I don't know . I failed my exam . 
 A B plus . 
 But I should have aced it . I mean I finished the paper so quickly , thinking it's a piece of cake . But when I knew my result , I was like what ? That can't be true ! 
 No , I don't . I just don't know how to handle this . This is my first time , you know . 
 What ? 
 How ? 
 Thanks . But I really don't feel like watching movies tonight . I have to get an early start in the morning . 
 I guess that's what I need . Thanks . You're being a really good friend . 
 Thanks , bye . 
 No , I'm not.Hey , look at that guy over there . 
 The guy in the blue shirt at the table by the window . 
 Right there . 
 Yes , it's Mel Gibson . 
 I don't know . Why don't you go ask for his autograph ? 
 Why not ? 
 We have so Ay ! But my favorite happens at Christmas Eve . 
 Well , all the brothers and sisters get together and fill the Christmas stockings for the litt 1e kids . 
 Well , in fact it's fun for us to just be together that night and do this one thing . 
 You should be there some Christmas Eve . 
 Sure . What is it ? 
 I'm glad to help you . But what is it you want to ask about ? 
 Why ? I think the meeting went well . 
 Yes . But what are you worried about ? 
 Rude ? You weren't rude at all , Annie . Why do you think you were rude ? 
 I understand . But really you weren't rude at all.You said what you thought . I think he appreciates that . 
 Yes . 
 You mean because you are a woman ? 
 Listen , Annie . You shouldn't worry about Mr . Drummond.He is a very good man to work for . He is not sexist at all.He appreciates people for their ideas.And he is willing to take suggestions from men or women . 
 I agree with you on that , Annie . I've worked for Derek Drummond for nine years now . I feel he appreciates his employees for their work , not their gender . I would never change jobs . 
 Any time . If you have a good idea , don't be afraid to speak up.This is a company that appreciates initiative . 
 why , Jerry ? Your words just came out of the blue . 
 I work very hard and that's it , you know , practice makes perfect . 
 I have no idea . 
 well , Jerry , let me tell you a secret . 
 my IQ score is slightly above average . 
 maybe I've got a higher EQ . I'm not sure . 
 you can say that again , Jerry . And I'm sure you're high in both of them . With a little more time cracking the books , you can also get high marks . 
 let's go ! 
 Oh . Hi Matt . I went snowboarding yesterday and my whole body aches . 
 Yeah . And I never want to go again . 
 That's exactly how I feel now . 
 Ha . There won't be a next time . 
 I'll think about it after I start feeling better . Right now , I don't even want to hear the word snowboarding . 
 Oh , hi Stacy . 
 I worked over the summer at a restaurant . Have to make tuition money , right ? What did you do ? 
 So are you officially a junior now ? 
 That makes sense . So where is Nicole ? 
 Really ? Why ? 
 Wow . She's so lucky . She doesn't have a degree and she already has a job . 
 Do you know how much they are paying her ? 
 What is up ? 
 Oh , don ’ t be angry . I just thought you might need them sometime . 
 Are you a smoker ? 
 Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ? 
 When did you begin to smoke ? 
 Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking ? 
 Hey , look at my new shirt . What do you think about it ? 
 I bought it on a street market . A real bargain ! 
 Jenny , you look terrible . What's eating you ? 
 Hey , chill out , I'm just trying to help . 
 So , what's the problem ? 
 No kidding ! Didn't you study for it ? 
 That's too bad , anyway , I'm sure things will turn around next semester . 
 You can't do that , Jenny ! 
 Come on , let's talk about it . 
 How was your day ? 
 Anybody I know ? 
 Of course . You didn't have to ask me . 
 Just don't stay out too late . 
 Yeah . The autumn is marvelous here . 
 That's a hard time . The air is cold and damp , and the road is often icy . 
 Sure . 
 Plenty . We never worry about lack of rainwater in our area . 
 That's right . 
 Not at all . 
 You're welcome at any time . 
 You're most welcome . 
 Call us as soon as you get home . 
 Sorry , I can't dance . 
 Is it difficult to learn ? 
 How should I do ? 
 All right . By the way , do you often dance ? 
 It seems a good way . 
 Come on , you think about what to wear almost every day . There are thousands of clothes in your wardrobe . 
 I have and I can prove that is 100 % true for you . 
 No kidding ! Again ? ! You just went shopping yesterday . You really are a shopaholic . 
 OK . Do you have the receipt with you ? I think they will ask you to show them the receipt first . 
 Isn't it time for dinner ? 
 How about Mac Donald's ? 
 I think most people treat animals well , but we are often cruel to animals . When we raise animals for food , the conditions they live in are often poor . 
 What would you do with all the animals ? You couldn ’ t just let them go . Besides , some people would still hunt them . Meat has become an integral part of our diet . 
 That ’ s true . I think zoo are a good idea , because they allow people to get close to animals . I think it ’ s good for kids to see wild animals . 
 I read that the number of animals being used in experiments is falling dramatically as new techniques are being introduced . 
 Sometimes you read about people who have been cruel to pets or other animals , but those stories are rare . 
 Yes , I have . They do an excellent job . 
 OK.Take care . 
 What a creep ! Phony good luck e-mails are one thing , but sexual harassment is crossing the line . 
 You could try using a spam filter to reject stuff that's obviously pornographic or anything else you don't want . 
 Yes , that is why I never drink it . 
 Very seldom , because tea has tannin which may be harmful to one's health . 
 What good is it for ? 
 That's true , but it must not be allowed to stand long . 
 Because if you drink a kind of tea which has been prepared for some time before , it will do you harm . 
 You flatter me . 
 Yes . That would be nice . When do you want to go ? 
 Sorry , I can't go today . 
 Ok . What time ? 
 I think that's too late . 
 Yes , that's good . Where would you like to go ? 
 Oh , I don't like that Restaurant . I don't want to go there . 
 OK , I like that place . 
 Oh , I've been fine , but I'm having some trouble with my son . 
 Oh , he's 14 and in the past few months , he's become quieter and a bit secretive . He locks himself in his room and I think he's running around with the wrong crowd . 
 Well , he's become friends with a couple of older boys who are in a band . And one night last weekend , he came home really late , way past his curfew . 
 He told me that his friend's car broke down and they had to walk home . 
 I haven't yet . I just keep hoping it's just a phase he's going through . 
 You're right . I should talk to him . Sometimes , it's not easy being a parent . Thanks . It helps to get it off my chest . You're always so easy to talk to . 
 Hello , Tom ! Do you have plans for this evening ? 
 How about having dinner with me ? 
 Let ’ s fix it at seven o'clock , OK ? 
 Don ’ t worry . I will arrange everything . 
 See you . 
 Good idea ! I finish work at five . Why don ’ t we meet at six ? 
 Let ’ s meet in front of the train station . 
 Ok , see you tonight ! Don ’ t be late ! 
 That would be great . Actually , can I get your phone number , Ella ? That's assuming you don't mind if I call you sometime . 
 Ok , got it . I will call you sometime next week . 
 It's time to go . Bye , Ella . Hope to see you soon 
 Lisa , I'm so glad to see you . How are you doing ? 
 Me too . We haven't seen each other for years . 
 How time flies ! Now you are a college student out of a little girl . 
 Couldn't be better . 
 She's been good . She is in grade one in Joy Chain high school . And she dreams to be a volunteer in 2008 . 
 You were scared , too ? I dared not tell you my feeling when I heard that . I almost got fainted . 
 But Sarah says she does not care , so long as he loves her . 
 What ’ s it for ? 
 Oh , that ’ s a nice idea . Well , it ’ s fine if you take our picture . 
 Hey , That's a really nice outfit you have on . 
 Oh , you look stunning . Your dress really goes well with your shoes . 
 No , not at all . It looks really classy on you . Where did you pick that up ? 
 When did you go there ? 
 I might just do that . What style of clothes do they have ? 
 I was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection . 
 Well , I spent a lot of money on getting my shirts tailor-made , so I couldn't afford to buy any new ties . 
 Yes , I am . Say , are you going to wear that outfit to the party ? 
 Me too . I will probably go dressed in a T-shirt and jeans . 
 That's my style when I'm not in the office . 
 Hello , John . How are you ? 
 Very well , thanks . Nice to see you again . I haven't seen you for a long time . What have you been doing lately ? 
 Fine , thanks . I've been busy lately . 
 I've been studying for my exams . My school exams will begin next month . 
 Thanks . And how are your parents ? 
 Where are you going now ? 
 I can't . I have to meet someone . 
 Good-bye . See you again sometime . 
 OK , boy . I will buy it for you . 
 Can you imagine she's over forty ? 
 Absolutely . She's a teacher of aerobics . 
 Today is Tuesday , 25th September , 2001 . 
 What time is your appointment ? 
 What time is now ? Do you have the correct time ? 
 It must be about 6 o'clock . 
 You won't be late . It's still early . 
 Oh , hi Jeremy . No please , go ahead . So how are you , Jeremy ? I was talking to Linda about you only last week . 
 No , tell me more . 
 And . 
 That's great news , Jeremy . Congratulations ! Anyway , I must get back , but give my regards to your wife Monica . 
 What's your favorite kind of music ? Do you like pop music ? 
 There was a concert country music last week . 
 I like it , too . But sometimes I enjoy jazz and classical music . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 What did you do to this book ? 
 You will need to pay for the damage . 
 I ’ m going to need $ 5.00 . 
 It isn ’ t . 
 Thank you . 
 Hello ? 
 I ’ Ve no idea . Nothing really . 
 Wonderful . 
 I ’ ll be ready . 
 Don't mention it . I lost a bunch of money on it this year . I think it is on the brink of bankruptcy . 
 I changed my strategy around too . I am investing in good companies now . 
 It's a good idea . But please be careful when you invest this time . 
 If you have any question , you can ask me . 
 All right . Let's chat next time . Bye-bye . 
 Where do you have to go . 
 When do you have to be there . 
 How long do you have to be there ? 
 When will you be back ? 
 I ’ Ve got a new boss . 
 Well , he ’ s got dark hair and brown eyes . 
 And a white sports car . 
 Yes , but he ’ s got a wife and 3 children as well . 
 You can buy some of these nice butterflies . 
 What ? You feel sorry for the butterflies ? 
 Well , I agree with you . I'd rather think that the butterflies are flying around in the mountains . I just wonder if they really catch so many that it affects the butterfly population . 
 How much are they ? 
 If you want . Didn't you buy her a small vase already ? 
 Alright . Buy it then . I won't buy anything . Well , maybe I'll buy some Cognac . 
 Let's go ask about it . 
 Nothing much . 
 You got a raise ? 
 You got promoted ? 
 You won a lottery ? Don ’ t beat around the bush , just tell me , please . 
 I'm frustrated . 
 I can't work out this problem . 
 Thanks . I really appreciate it . 
 Yes , I ’ Ve been got all his albums and most of his films on DVD . I adore him . He ’ s my idol . 
 Some of his early films are hard to find nowadays , especially the ones where he only played a bit part . 
 Yes . These posters are new . I bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday . 
 I was , but then I discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet , so I ’ m not a member now . 
 Of course ! I bought two copies . 
 What would you like to have in your breakfast , bread , egg or sandwiches ? 
 And milk or orange juice ? 
 What would you like for lunch , pork , mutton or beef ? 
 What kind of drink do you like most , red wine , beer or champagne ? 
 And among apples , oranges and bananas , which is your favorite ? 
 Do you always have meals outside or in your house ? 
 The art critic from the daily chronicle doesn ’ t think much of the max oreo exhibition . He says that the artwork is uninspiring and old fashioned . 
 I liked it . I didn ’ t think his works were masterpieces , but the certainly weren ’ t uninspiring , in my opinion . 
 I like landscapes and still life . You prefer abstract paintings , don ’ t you ? 
 I agree . I prefer oils too . I collect landscapes , but I only have a small collection . You have a small collection of abstract art , don ’ t you ? 
 That would be nice . Can you read the characters ? 
 I think that ’ s true with any of the fine arts . 
 Yes , of course . This is really a nice party with wonderful people and lovely wines . 
 Thank you for the invitation . 
 Yes , please . Thank you for everything . 
 I think there's too much violence and it did no good to my little boy . 
 It's really hard to avoid such bad influence anyway . 
 You're really sporty ! 
 Do you have clubs ? 
 There are clubs for beginners . It's cheaper to buy those rather than rent them a few times . 
 Like the seven-piece set . It's only $ 120 . 
 Okay . 
 Well , in the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulties in getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts . 
 Now we have a two-year-old boy . We're very happy that he's healthy and smart . 
 Right now he speaks mostly English , and he can say a few Chinese words . But he will learn in the future . 
 Yes , people surely can . He's whiter than the Chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though . 
 Well you know , claiming that your grandmother is sick is the classic excuse used to get out of doing something . 
 Is there anything I can do to help ? Just remember that I'm there for you if you want to talk about it . 
 You're welcome . I'd like you to join us for dinner again sometime . 
 Today ? 
 Don't mention it . I am pleased to help you . 
 I'll do that.Thank you.Have a safe trip home . 
 Yes , I do . I find it very informative.It always has plenty of articles from correspondents all over the world and the business section is very useful too . 
 Yes . There is . it has several sections , so it ’ s quite a read ! It usually takes me a few hours to read it on Sunday morning . 
 Let me see . There ’ s the news section , the entertainment section , sports , business , and world affairs . 
 World affairs ? They look at the most important stories in more detail . I find it fascinating . Do you buy a daily paper ? 
 You must like negotiating a lot . People are saying , you are a super negotiator . 
 I am not good at it by any means . Give me some advice . 
 Sounds easy . But how can I apply to practice ? I am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . But I am afraid our boss will turn me down . 
 Hey , Shirley . The party has been wonderful . My husband and my children have enjoyed it very much , and me too . 
 I surely will . By the way , is the party like this held every weekend in our neighborhood ? 
 My children would like that ; they like dancing very much . 
 Look ! Who is that guy on the stage ? 
 Really ? 
 He performs very well . He is so funny ! 
 OK , that's perfect ! By the way , is there any playground in our neighborhood ? 
 OK , got it ! Thank you so much . You have helped me a lot ! 
 You look pale , you must have poor health . 
 Why not go to see the doctor ? 
 How is Tom now ? 
 Let's congratulate him on Sunday . 
 There are three of them , the Three Tenors . 
 Yeah , it's really a unique experience . It's a solo concert by Pavarotti . He put on the performance in the Forbidden City in Beijing . 
 Besides , speaking of classical music , we should never forget about the New Year's Concert . 
 Sure . It's undoubtedly one of the biggest classical music events . Have you ever been to the live show ? 
 Wow , you are so lucky . I saw that one on TV . But it must be so different to be there in the concert hall . 
 Who was the conductor at that event ? 
 So cool . I wish I can go to the live New Year's Concert someday in the future . 
 I believe in that . Well , the performance is about to begin . Let's be quiet . 
 Are you looking for a space on or off campus ? 
 You can park in the student parking structure . 
 You'll find the parking structure on the west side of the campus . 
 Last time I checked , it was pretty empty . 
 That was earlier this morning . 
 I have no idea . 
 We need to talk about the size of the country and its population . 
 It says here that most of the people are han Chinese , but there are 55 minorities that make up almost 10 % of the population . 
 We could divide into five parts . There ’ s the northeast , which is mild in summer and very cold in winter . Then there is the northwest , which is largely desert . Tillet is famous for its mountainous climate . The rest of the country can be roughly divided into two parts . One is temperate-mild in winter and warm in summer . Then , in the south it is hot most of the year . 
 It is , buy remember that we only have a few minutes to make our presentation . We can select cities from each part and give data for each one . 
 Yes . The other large cities are Chengdu , Dalian , Wuhan , tianjin , shenyang , Chongqing . Hongkong and Guangzhou . 
 I learned of the railway accident only this morning . 
 Is that true ? 
 Thanks . 
 No . I don ’ t suppose he ’ s to blame . The man in the other car made a big mistake . 
 Yeah . I think everyone should go easy on driving . 
 No , who won ? 
 Really ? I'm surprised . I didn't know his English was that good . 
 I rather doubt it.You ' re cheated by his appearance , I think . 
 Paul , let's go and see Grandpa this afternoon . 
 It's Saturday . 
 I have made up my mind . I am getting a tattoo . 
 Yeah ! Why not ? They are trendy and look great ! I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back . 
 Really ? 
 Oh , I didn ’ t know that ! I thought they just paint it on your skin or something . 
 Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing ! 
 really ? Where did you hear that ? 
 I'm not sure ... well , first , it couldn't be George . He is such a kiss-ass . He'd wash the boss's dog if he asked . 
 that's true . What about Lisa ? I bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her . 
 well , okay . Then there is still Michael . But he's pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . It definitely won't be Michael . 
 well , it could be me too . But I am not too worried . This place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hard-ass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . It would almost b 
 Yeah . I do it once a week . 
 Sure . I get a lot of information and make many friends . 
 I want to say ... 
 That I can't go on any longer without you . 
 Nancy , I made up my mind you were the only woman for me at the first sight . 
 Forgive me for startling you with the impetuosity of my sentiments . 
 I really love you . 
 And I hope so . This is what you were meant for . Say you love me , say yes , say yes . 
 Do you think Tom will be elected president ? 
 Let's make a bet on who gets it . 
 Your knowledge of English is really surprising . 
 No , seriously . I am impressed . 
 Your knowledge of English is really surprising . 
 No , seriously . I am impressed . 
 Have you noticed the Mexican restaurant on the other side of this street ? 
 Yes , someone give me a pamphlet introducing the restaurant and its business hours when I passed by this morning.So , let ’ s have a try . My treat . 
 Good for you . Today we have more chances to try some new food because there are now many new form restaurants in our city coming from places all over the world . 
 For sure all the customers will benefit from this . 
 I told you so . 
 Nothing much . What's new with you ? 
 Me too . Seems like all I do is eat and sleep . 
 Okay . Check you later . 
 They're discussing whether they should replace Miss Smith , the Music teacher . 
 Because she's not responsible enough . 
 My immediate family is quite small . It ’ s just my older step-brother , my mom , my step-dad and me . how about you ? 
 I didn ’ t know you were a twin ! Are you identical or fraternal ? 
 Interesting . It must be great having a twin sister . Are you best friends , too ? 
 I don ’ t know much about him . He died when I was just a baby . Even though I don ’ t have a blood relationship with my step-father and step-brother , I consider them to be my real family . 
 No , she also died when my step-brother was little . My mother and my step-father met each other shortly after my father died and became good friends . They ended up getting married a few years later . 
 It's awfully quiet around here . 
 I have a feeling that we're not supposed to be in here . 
 Mike's going to have a self-driving traveling across the country . 
 You don't want to join him ? 
 Yes , and I want to have a try . 
 I'm going to Bill's house . 
 I'm going to help him . 
 He's fixing his roof . 
 Is there anything good playing ? 
 Really ? I want to go , too . 
 No problem . 
 I get a lump in my throat whenever I see a tragic movie . 
 But their love is touching ! 
 I am not ! 
 Yes . Table tennis is probably the most popular . 
 Most anyway . 
 Yes , I like . But I can't play it well . 
 Basketball and swimming are very popular . 
 We can play together if you are free . 
 I couldn't look at you , and say you aren't beautiful ! 
 No , Miss Anna , you must let me say how lovely you are ! What's wrong with that ? 
 You know that everybody notices how beautiful you are , don't you ? 
 Oh , Miss Anna ! That's too hard ! I won't be here long . 
 My country is well know for being very flat . There are some hills in the southeast of the country . 
 Pretty much . The land rises and falls only a few meters . The southeast , the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . There are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country . 
 The coast of your country is very varied . The coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches . 
 There are many lakes and rivers in your country too . We also have many rivers , but only a few lakes . 
 Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ? 
 I suppose she's right.Does she speak English very slowly ? 
 It must be interesting to study English . 
 Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ? 
 We have a class outing today . 
 Excuse me , Professor . I have to talk to you about why my homework didn't get done . 
 I had to watch a football game instead . 
 Yes , I think so . 
 I'll make it up next week . 
 OK , I can do that . 
 Will you be done doing my hair soon ? 
 How much time do you need ? 
 I think it looks gorgeous . 
 I honestly think it looks great . 
 How much is it for my hair ? 
 Thanks for doing such a good job . 
 Why do you look so gloomy ? What are you looking for ? 
 Did you finish typing yesterday ? 
 Don't worry about it . It must be somewhere in your room . Let's see where you put it . Have you searched your drawers and the desk ? 
 How about the shelf ? 
 Don't get upset over it . At least you have another week to go . 
 Cheer up ! What I meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . There is no need to write a new one . Oh , what's this ? Is this your dissertation ? 
 You ’ Ve put it among these journals . 
 how come you're still up ? Shouldn't you be asleep by now ? 
 as far as I know , insomnia is usually caused by stress . Are you stressed at all ? 
 you're a good student . I'm sure you can do well . What you need to do is to relax . 
 taking a yoga class or learning some relaxation techniques can help you cope with your stress . 
 you need to take some breaks throughout the day . Studying all day isn ’ t very usually effective . 
 besides , it ’ s not difficult to learn yoga . In fact , I can teach you a move that ’ s supposed to help you fall asleep ! You just have to sit down like this , bend over and breath in deeply . 
 good night , sleep tight ; don ’ t let the bed bugs bite ! 
 What is it ? 
 It's huge ! 
 The craftsmanship is excellent . 
 Thank you so much . 
 Can I still get tickets for tonight's performance ? 
 Aren't there any other seats ? 
 It seems to me that you fall for good-looking guys . 
 Why don't you date up a handsome guy and spend time together ? 
 You must have a lot in common and a barrel of fun . 
 Would you like some coffee , Tom ? 
 Here's some sugar . 
 Espresso is made with a machine that forces steam and boiling water through finely ground coffee . It's strong . 
 Cappuccino is one-third espresso and two-thirds a mixture of steamed milk and froth . 
 If you want something manly , stick with the espresso . 
 What do you think of the speech the man delivered just now ? 
 We cannot expect politics to be true anyway . 
 And we're going to have summer vacation . 
 I'll plan for the vacation . 
 Very good . That may be the most delicious food I have ever eaten . 
 I really appreciate you for having invited me . 
 Anyway , I owe you one . Are you free tonight ? 
 I want to invite you to enjoy the food I cook . 
 Thank you for your letter . 
 Yes , I ’ m feeling very well these days . 
 And I was glad to receive your letter . 
 I will be back again next Wednesday . 
 Bye . 
 Your dream comes true now . 
 You are really confident . 
 He looks strong.What does he do ? 
 He must be very brave . 
 How's your brother doing ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . What's the matter ? 
 I'll tell him . Thanks for asking about him . 
 Yes , I am . I like to watch soccer games on TV , but I don ’ t play . I watched every game of the 2002 World Cup . 
 Italian . They played very well , but they were not very lucky . 
 What are you doing , awake ? 
 But it's almost midnight ! 
 Really ? How do you know it was Santa ? 
 Hmm ... well I know that Santa won't come down the chimney with you hiding behind the tree , spying on him ! 
 Really ! Let's go back upstairs and get back to bed . That way , we can let Santa do his job . Then when you wake up , it will be Christmas already ! 
 Hey , honey ! Is that you ? Don't eat all the cookies — I want some , too ! 
 I ’ m fine , Celia . And you ? 
 Do you have a lot of homework ? 
 Of course I do ! 
 I ’ m studying for my chemistry exam tomorrow . 
 Yes . Are you ? 
 Do you want to study together ? 
 Do you want to go to and empty classroom ? 
 Ok . Let ’ s go ! 
 Yes . Should we go there by bus so we aren't late ? 
 That's true . Cycling is good for our environment , too . Let me just get my helmet then . 
 Not really , but I liked the design , so I got it . 
 I'll think about it . 
 Yes , my father gave it to me for my birthday . Do you like it ? 
 Nothing but the best from my dad . I like everything about it except for the brakes . They are a bit sticky . 
 Well , my saddle is too low for me . Do you know how to change the height ? 
 Is that why my knees have felt sore after every time I've ridden my bike ? 
 Oh , God . It ’ s late . I ’ m afraid I have to leave . 
 That ’ s very kind of you . But if I don ’ t go now I ’ ll miss the last bus . 
 Thank you for your hospitality . 
 How about next time we meet at my place ? And I ’ ll treat you to Chinese food . I know how much you like it . We can order in and watch video too . Anything you like , I promise . 
 Well . I really do have to go . 
 See you tomorrow . 
 Don't you want to go to the visiting hours ? This sheet says they are tonight . 
 ... and maybe that's what we both need . 
 OK , but don't forget I'm here for you , and I know how you feel . It's my loss , too . 
 What makes you say that ? 
 But everything has been so easy . 
 Yeah , you never look at the positive side of things . 
 Write down your name here in ink . 
 I ’ m afraid a pencil won ’ t do . Wait a moment , I ’ ll find you one . 
 you said it . Good beer , good music , and on top of that , there are so many hot girls here ! 
 well , she's alright , but not really my cup of tea . What about the blond with the red dress ? 
 yeah ! She could do anything she wants to me ! 
 I don't think so . I get so nervous talking to girls . I always put my foot in my mouth , scare her off , and end up looking like a real fool . Besides , she is way out of my league . 
 okay okay , just let me have another cup of beers to get my head in the game . 
 why ? 
 okay , here I go ! 
 Do you watch a lot of TV ? 
 Not me . I have to have my TV and watch whatever comes on . 
 I am certain I am going to fail my English test . 
 Because it's impossible to improve listening level within a week . 
 Yes , I think my vocabulary and reading comprehension are not very bad . 
 Oh , thank you . That's very nice of you . 
 Hello . Thank you for seeing me off . You actually don't need to bother . 
 Thanks a lot . I hope to see you again . 
 Thanks again for everything you have done for me . 
 Did you see the way that Brian came to work yesterday ? Ever since he came back from that conference in Silicon Valley , he's been coming to work dressed in jeans and sweatshirts . It's like he's decided to make himself at home in his office . I don't know how long it'll take before the management talks to him about it . 
 Maybe so , but it seems kind of strange , which the rest of us in white shirts , dark suites , and ties . 
 What's that ? 
 I go to the fitness center every weekend . 
 To lose some weight . 
 Uh-oh . I'm in trouble . 
 I just remembered that I've got to give a speech in class today and I forgot to prepare for it . 
 I heard you received a prize for you book . 
 congratulations ! You must be very proud of your achievement . 
 what was the prize ? 
 that ’ s a great prize for a person who writes books ! Have you ever won a prize before ? 
 I won $ 10 in the lottery last month . Perhaps next time , I ’ ll be luckier and win the jackpot ! 
 To tell you the truth , it's the most tedious course i have ever had . 
 It is still a mystery to me . 
 Why ? 
 Oh , yes ! I completely forgot about it . 
 No , but now he'll be in trouble . What's a boyfriend for ? To forget about Valentine's Day ? 
 You know , it's OK for a girl to forget these " big days " , but for a guy , to do that is unforgivable . 
 Oh , it's Jack . Excuse me . 
 He asked me out to a dinner tonight . How about joining us ? 
 So what ? 
 I heard that your previous manager was very capable , he is a good manger . 
 What do you mean ? 
 And lots of " Dear Abby " sob stories ... 
 No wonder you're such a wacko ... 
 Nice . Hey , I like the layout of this page ... 
 How many cleaning ladies does your company hire ? 
 Most cleaning ladies are illiterate . But some of them do a very nice job . 
 I find that every employee here respects that manager very much . 
 What's your favorite book ? 
 Why do you like it best ? 
 Well . I like the Thom Birds best . 
 Sure . I like the writer's language , too . 
 Would you like to go to the bookshop with me ? 
 It ’ s a beautiful day here in New Zealand at the Men ’ s Volleyball world championship . My name is Rick Fields and I ’ m joined by the man with the plan , Bob Copeland . 
 The ref signals the start of the game and here we go . Ribero serves and China quickly receives the ball . Chen bumps it to the setter , and ... a very nice set by Chen ! 
 It ’ s China ’ s service now . What a superb jump serve by Li , oh , and we have a let serve . The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net . 
 Hello , Grace . That's a beautiful skirt you have on . Where are you going ? 
 What kind of job are you applying for ? 
 Oh . That dress doesn't exactly match the job . 
 Yes , your skirt is really beautiful , but you are applying for a teaching position . You see , your skirt is very short , and your make up is too thick . What's more , the color of your lipstick doesn't match your skin . As a teacher , you should be a little more sedate . 
 Some of my friends tell me that being a teacher , the most important is the beauty of mind . You shouldn't pay too much attention to your appearance . You should appear frugal and prudent . Your experience and knowledge will gain the appreciation of your interviewer . 
 He's out of John's hands . Nothing he can do about such a black sheep . 
 London is such a historical city ! There ’ s history everywhere you look . There ’ s nelson ’ s column , built as a monument to one of the Britain ’ s great admirals and his important victory . He won the battle of Trafalgar in 1805 . 
 Nearby , on the banks of the thames , there ’ s the statue of Boadicea . She fought the Romans when they invaded Britain . 
 She was a very controversial leader . Are we going to visit the famous tower of London later ? 
 I ’ m looking forward to seeing the famous castle and prison . Many historic figures were imprisoned there in the past . I really want to see the crown jewels too . 
 Where ’ s that ? Oh , I know ! Madame Tussaud ’ s the waxworks museum . 
 Sometimes , it ’ s hard to know who belongs in each section of the museum ! 
 let's take the bus . 
 it's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once . 
 we could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice . 
 if we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ? 
 I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus . 
 it looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . 
 thanks , that was nice of you . 
 Mary , please go to the door . I hear the bell . 
 Give it to me ... How wonderful ! He's coming to visit us . 
 He's coming by car on the twenty-fourth . He's staying from thetwenty-fourth to the twenty-sixth . 
 No , he's coming with Aunt Cynthia and the girls . 
 Your cousin Fay is fifteen . Rosemary is older than Fay . She's seventeen . 
 Of course . The girls can stay in your room with you . 
 If you like , but now we have to think about meals and many other things . 
 What's your little caper ? Come home so late ! We are all worried about you . 
 Singing ? At the subway exit ? Oh , it sounds like someone needs some money . 
 It is just pop song , you could have sung there too if you want it . 
 Honey , just do it next time . Have you heard of the real art in the subway station in Russia ? 
 Many oil painting exhibitions are there . That is a kind of Museum Exhibition . 
 I am sure you will . There are some works , and some students who major in painting interpret the meaning for visitors . And people can enjoy the paintings while waiting for the train . 
 Both the pop music and the oil painting ate arts , but with different aesthetic values . 
 Not well enough , but I'm learning . 
 Indeed . I love the smell of the grass and trees . They certainly refresh my mind . 
 Sure . Did you hear anything ? Look ! An eagle is hovering in the sky . 
 Yes . Will it hurt us ? 
 OK . I have a good pair of hiking boots . It should not be a big problem . 
 You are kind . Look there is a big tree over there , it looks like a thousand-year-old tree . 
 How do you know ? 
 Can we talk ? 
 You know what I mean . 
 I want to know where this relationship is going . I ’ m in love with you and I need to know ... 
 I ’ m awesome . Well , I guess that ’ s my answer , isn ’ t it . 
 Look , if you don ’ t love me , it ’ s not a thing , alright , we ’ Ve had our laughs , but I don ’ t appreciate ... maybe it ’ s just time we ... 
 You do ? 
 Oh , I love you too ! 
 Oh baby , I ’ m so sorry . 
 Sure , but I have to tell you that I've become a vegetarian . I don't eat any kind of meat . 
 I saw a program a few months ago about how animals are raised for human consumption . I haven't been able to eat a single piece of meat since . 
 Definitely . I've also been buying organic fruit and vegetables , which is more expensive , but much better for you because they don't have any pesticides on them . 
 I guess you could say that . Eating fruit and vegetables helps keep you healthy . I've lost 5 pounds and I feel great ! 
 Well , I eat a lot more tofu , beans , nuts and some fish . 
 I prefer cooked fish to raw fish , but if you really like it , make it . 
 That sounds great . What time should I come over ? 
 Sounds good . See you there ! 
 He ’ s 21 . how old is James ? 
 How ’ s your father ? 
 He can spend more time with his grandchildren . 
 So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea ! 
 In the same way , probably . 
 No . Please sit down . 
 Are you also going to Beijing ? 
 I'm taking a vacation to visit a friend there . Have you ever been there before ? 
 Really ? What did you think ? 
 Was it that crowded ? 
 Oh , maybe I can take the bus or even rent a car . 
 Thank you very much ! 
 Really ? Me , too . What's your favorite flavor ? 
 Chocolate is mine . 
 Sounds not bad ! You know , the only thing I worried about is the safety . I ’ m not an active exerciser and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport . 
 I will think about it . 
 Do you like watching the Winter Olympic Games ? 
 Of course I do . I love it . All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable . 
 Yeah . What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics ? 
 I see . Then , what's your favorite winter sport ? 
 Then you must know Shen Due and Hao Hongbo . 
 You should go to talk with May . She is a big fan of them too . 
 For me , the Olympics for the disabled always catches my heart . It makes me understand that perseverance makes the impossible possible . 
 I always am . You just didn't notice . 
 So the reform cannot be carried out well . 
 Easier said than done . 
 No . It's all Greek to me . 
 I know that . I mean I couldn't understand her at all . 
 I wish you the best of luck . 
 Fine , thanks . 
 I have some problem with my work . 
 I can solve it , thanks . 
 Everything is Okay . And as soon as I see my son at home , all my worries vanish into the blue . 
 Ah , that's a good idea . But I heard the film club of our school would show a film for free . Maybe we don't need to go to the cinema . 
 I'd like to , but I'm afraid I can't . 
 That's not the reason . I have to go to the English Corner tomorrow evening . You know , I've been going there every week . 
 You said you wanted to improve your English , so how about coming with me tomorrow ? I can also introduce some friends to you . 
 They are not geeks . They are also interested in singing , dancing , and so on . They are excellent , and they can always help me a lot . 
 It depends . If they are not busy , they will come to join us , and talk with us . 
 Of course not . The foreign teachers also teach us English songs , and play games with us . 
 You won't be disappointed . 
 Yes . After so many years of hard work , I ’ d rather I had an office of my own . 
 I ’ ll be very glad if you would help . 
 Thank you . I wish I would . 
 Wow , is that your sports car ? 
 I love it ! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar . Is it in good condition ? 
 What's wrong with it ? 
 When's the last time you had it serviced ? 
 I thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis . 
 What else is wrong with it ? 
 Anything else ? 
 Why don't you get it all fixed ? 
 Well , let me know when you can get it fixed . I ’ d love to go for a ride in it ! 
 No , I can't . I'm sorry . I have to help my mother . We're going to move tomorrow . 
 No , it's not far . It's near our old house . 
 Sure . Thanks . 
 Why ? Is there some new , cool computer out on the market ? 
 That's a notebook ? 
 It looks more like a toy , or a cool briefcase ! 
 I suppose I do . 
 You said it . 
 It sure is . 
 Well , if you live in other cities as long as enough , you will love them just as much . 
 That's for sure . 
 Oh , hello , Mr . Campbell . I'm fine and Jack's doing well . How are you ? 
 Yes , I'm leaving at four pm . 
 Yes , me too . 
 Have you read all these crazy things that are going on around the world ? 
 I was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed ! Then they are sold on the black market . 
 Well , I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you play them backwards ! Can you believe that ? 
 Well maybe you are right , but how about the story of how KFC has rows of headless chickens which are super grown in order to get bigger chickens faster ! 
 Hi Bob , this is my friend Mary . 
 Bob is in advertising . 
 Wow ! I can ’ t believe I ’ m standing here ! 
 I ’ m standing in front of an exquisite work of art ! 
 I ’ Ve seen it so many times in books , but I never imagined I ’ d get to see it in person . 
 Maybe so , but do you have any idea how much this one is worth ? 
 About 80 million dollars . 
 Lady , you look unhappy . What ’ s the beef ? 
 When were you Bron may I ask ? 
 Do you know what it was according to the lunar calendar ? 
 By the way , could you tell me when the film will begin ? 
 I am frigid I can't be there on time . 
 I don't want to miss it today . 
 See you . 
 Yeah . I was so happy , because my favorite singer , Ricky Martin won ' Best Latin Pop Performance ' . 
 He is really great . He has sold millions of records worldwide . He is especially known for his rocking performance at the football World Cup song-the Cup of World . 
 That's right . His voice ranges from the smooth sound of ballads to the highpowered rhythms of the Spanish Caribbean where he grew up . He has fan clubs across the world , from America to Russia , from England to Taiwan , from Norway to Australia . 
 How come ? 
 He's such a mother hen . 
 You too . Have you lost some weight ? 
 Not some crazy diet fat I hope . 
 Good for you , keep it up . 
 How did they hear ? No one called . 
 His mom and dad must be destroyed . He was their only son . 
 Yes ... thank you for understanding . We have to go now . 
 OK . Steven , you're looking at a picture . Please describe what you see ! 
 OK . Have you ever been on a double decker bus ? 
 Oh , really . Mm ! How much is the fare ? 
 Mm , yeah , who can you see on the bus ? Can you pick out anyone on the bus who looks interesting ? 
 Is that how you feel on the bus ? 
 So , so you're British , do you missing them ? 
 Is the view going to be ok ? 
 I ’ ll do my best . 
 I got a promotion . Lunch is on me . 
 You can keep these books for only half a month . 
 Of course , you can . 
 I didn't sleep a wink last night . 
 Well , I'm under a lot of pressure . My boss is very pushy . He assigned me two projects . Now the deadlines are near and I still haven't finish one of them . 
 Well , I guess no one can help me but myself . For the moment , I just need someone to talk to so that I can relieve my stress . 
 Which team won ? 
 What was the score ? 
 You know ... I did very poorly on that test . 
 Well , you know how I am about exams . I'm a perfectionist . 
 What happened to Nancy ? She is all sweetness and light today . 
 No wonder ! Who is the bridegroom ? 
 I think Bill Clinton is a good president . 
 Well . Maybe he isn't a good husband , but he is a successful president . 
 Yes , he is . Of course he makes mistakes , but who doesn ’ t . 
 What good sunshine ! Let's go and get a suntan on the balcony . 
 It's different in my case . I work in the office , so only rarely do I get the chance to get any sun . 
 Would you like to stretch your legs ? 
 Let's get a soft drink . 
 Yes , we do . 
 It's a new concert hall and the acoustics are great . 
 Is this your first time to come to a symphony concert ? 
 Do you have concert halls in your city ? 
 Well , we'd better get back to our seats . It's about to start . 
 Wake up sleepyhead.The sun is beginning to shine . What a lovely summer day ! 
 It's not that hot . It's cooler than yesterday . Let's go swimming ! 
 Yeah , sounds like fun . I can wear my new pink bikini . 
 Who cares ! Well , the smart guys get there early . That's the kind of guy I want to meet . Let's go ! 
 Ok , you could borrow one of mine . 
 No problem . Here it is . 
 Yes , isn't it . 
 It's beautiful 75 degrees . 
 Not a good plan . The TV weather forecast says the hurricane is coming this weekend , and the temperature will also drop to 66 degrees . 
 I never make any definite weekend plan until Friday morning . Then after listening to the weather temperature , I make my plans . 
 are you ready to go the concert ? 
 actually , why don't we go there by bike ? We could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in such hour . 
 is your helmet comfortable ? 
 maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better . 
 is that your new bicycle ? 
 it's the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike . These are really expensive ! 
 I can fix those for you . Is there anything else wrong with it ? 
 that's easy . It's important to have the saddle high enough so that your legs can extend fully when you are on your bicycle . 
 it's possible . Give me a minute and I can fix these for you and then we can go . 
 Yes , here you go . 
 Yes , I ’ d like to check three pieces . 
 What ? Why ! I am taking an intercontinental flight ! I ’ m flying sixteen thousand CMS ! How am I supposed to only take two , twenty kilo bags ? That ’ s absurd ! 
 Now I see . You charge next to nothing for an international ticket , but when it comes to charging for any other small thing , you charge an arm and a leg ! So tell me , miss , how much will I have to pay for all of this . 
 That ’ s more than my round-trip ticket ! 
 I'd like that very much . 
 Fine . See you later . 
 Fine . 
 Oh , I have been with my uncle for a week . 
 He is an accountant . I have been helping him for a week . 
 Yeah . How are you these days ? 
 So what kind of music turns you on ? 
 You mean the kind of stuff like Nirvana ? 
 Dick , I ’ Ve decided not to rent that house . 
 I ’ Ve changed my mind . 
 Well , I think maybe I should find a house that is closer to where I work . 
 Hi ! How are you going ? 
 Not bad.How about you ? Haven't seen you for a long time . 
 Did you enjoy yourself ? 
 Thanks , I like looking at photographs.How nice ! Oh , I'm afraid I must be going now . I've got an appointment . Have a good day . 
 Goodbye . 
 Am I ready for what ? 
 Oh . Yes , I ’ m ready to transfer . 
 I ’ m very nervous . 
 I ’ m not going to know anybody there . 
 That makes me nervous . 
 I didn ’ t think about it that way . 
 Yes . We went for a walk in the woods near the highway . 
 Yes . It was very cold and windy . We wore heavy wool sweaters and walked quickly to keep warm . 
 Yes . Farther away from the highway it was very quiet and there were birds and squirrels everywhere . We counted over twenty squirrels . 
 Yes , we bought veal sandwiches . We stopped around twelve , and we ate and watched the squirrels , but it was too windy to sit long . It was a very nice walk , anyway . 
 Yeah , it is ! Why is it so expensive ? 
 I don ’ t think it ’ s worth that money . 
 How is your business going ? 
 Really ? Maybe I should work for you . 
 Hey , what's the matter ? 
 Are you sure that this has nothing to do with sleep ? 
 I've been told that you are a very successful businessman abroad . I wonder how you managed to achieve such success ? 
 I suppose that in a foreign country it was difficult at first , wasn't it ? 
 You mean you didn ’ t know much English then ? 
 That's incredible . Could you tell me what you did to make a start ? 
 Really ? I wish you could tell me more about your experience . 
 What's the news on our website ? How effective do you think it is from a marketing standpoint ? 
 What kinds of hits are we getting on our company's website ? 
 You really think that many people turn to the internet to find product information.What about the old standbys of word mouth and print media ? 
 What do you know about Julia Roberts ? 
 I mean her personality . 
 I've never seen a machine like this before and need some help . 
 I want to buy a drink . 
 I've got the correct change already . 
 OK , what next ? 
 OK , next ? 
 I agree with you . 
 Honey , wait ! I've sprained my ankle . 
 Of course not ! 
 The pain is killing me . 
 I thought leather shoes will do just as well . 
 What are you going to do ? 
 God ! It's freezing ! 
 So Chris , I've heard that you're from a big family . How many people ? 
 Seven children ? That's a lot . Why did your parents have so many ? 
 Jeez , seven children . That must have a lot of problems . We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right . 
 Like what ? I assume that there's no privacy . 
 And the age gap is also annoying . There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me . We have nothing in common . 
 Well , at least going to college won't be too bad . Since both of your parents are college professors , they must give you reduced tuition at the college . 
 That was a nice funeral . 
 The son gave a nice speech about his father . 
 I think it was about 45 minutes long . 
 I liked it . 
 Do you think anyone will come to my funeral ? 
 I think only the family will be there . 
 Hello ? 
 Nothing . Just watching TV . 
 Sure . What time ? 
 Sounds good . Where and when will we meet ? 
 All right . See you then . 
 Not too good actually , people are not spending as much as before ! 
 Lots of reasons I guess , unemployment is pretty high these days . 
 Yes . She believes everything about him . 
 Yes . If she doesn't believe it , Christmas won't be so exciting to her . 
 I'm not going to tell her . She will find out and understand when she grows older . 
 Nervous ? Why ? 
 Don't worry . You don't have to do anything.All you have to do is listen . You will enjoy it . 
 Listen , Ryan.Catholics welcome people who aren't Catholics to visit the church.You don't have to pretend to be Catholic . It's okay if you just come to listen . 
 Yes . We are kind and welcoming people.It is not a secret society or something like that . 
 Yes , but you don't even have to sing . If you want to sing along , you can . 
 There is a songbook . All the words are in the songbook.Many people have to read the words . 
 No . That is something only true Catholics do.So if you come to the church as a visitor , you only listen to the service.But you shouldn't go up to the altar for the bread and wine.Only after someone joins the church , then they go up for the Eucharist . 
 That is the special word for the ritual of the bread and wine.The Catholics call it the Eucharist . 
 It's not . It's an ancient Greek word . It means gratitude . 
 Of course you are . I wouldn't ask you otherwise . 
 They were not too bad . I really liked my poli-sci class . 
 I don't know if I would call it my favorite , but it ranks up there . 
 I took a business communication class last year and it was terrific . 
 What are you reading ? 
 It seems that English already is the main global language . Does the article suggest that there should be an artificial language like Esperanto as the world language . 
 Does the article say anything about other language ? How will they survive in an English-speaking world ? 
 Right . All the people who speak Chinese . Hindi , French and Spanish aren ’ t suddenly going to stop using those languages . 
 In that case , I shall continue to learning a few basic phrases in other languages . 
 Yes . 
 It is really a hard nut to crack . The problem is that the crime was done without leaving any trace . 
 How about taking a walk in the park ? 
 Oh , it's so quiet here.We have the park to ourselves , only you and me ! 
 Oh , I see them.Some are doing Taijiquan , some are performing swordplay , some are practising the Chinese Wushu . 
 Another glass of beer , will you ? 
 At least one for your trip . 
 Have you seen that house ? 
 You're right . I love it very much . 
 At least more than 100 years old . 
 I can't open the door . 
 Let me ask the old woman in that reception office . 
 She must be deaf . 
 Frightened ? You must be joking . 
 Hi , Ms . Seymour ? It ’ s Allan Parker . I ’ Ve been waiting to call you and thank you for all your help last week . 
 Well , I want to let your boss know that she ’ d better hold on to you ! You ’ re a hard worker ! 
 It's very hot , the temperature is often over 40 ° C . 
 Not really.But I like it in spring and fall . I don't like it in winter . 
 The winter is very rainy , I don't like the rainy day . 
 I lived there for three years . I like summer but I don't like winter . 
 Yes , it is.But it's nice in spring and fall . 
 Yes , I didn ’ t finish work until 9:00 pm . 
 Yes , I have too much work to do at the moment . 
 Because too many people in the office are on holiday . 
 Oh , thanks a lot . 
 1:30 P . m . But I've got to check in at 12:30 P . m . 
 Pan American Airlines . Flight 282 . 
 Ok . See you tomorrow . 
 You mean he had been put in prison before . 
 Oh , he had fooled me . 
 Yes . 
 Hi . My name is Jessica . 
 Pleased to meet you too . And where are you from , Robin ? 
 I'm from New York . Oh , this is my stop . Bye , Robin . 
 Well , I've never downloaded music before . How does it work ? 
 Alright . But why is downloading music better than buying Cds at the store ? 
 Hi ! How are you doing ? 
 Pretty good . Say , where are you living this semester ? 
 Oh , I am looking for an apartment . I prefer living off campus . I can study better . 
 Okay , see you around . 
 I think modern painting means nothing . 
 Then why are so many crazy about it 
 Maybe . 
 Yes , I found a better house near my office . I ’ m very satisfied with it . But I ’ m worrying . 
 I ’ m worrying about how to move all of my household stuff . You know , I have a lot of stuff . 
 How much dose that cost ? 
 I think it ’ s a little expensive . 
 That ’ s right . 
 Wonderful . 
 Okay , thanks a lot . You did me a great favor just now . 
 I saw your car outside , so I stooped by . 
 I just meant that she's got different taste . 
 She's pretty conservative . 
 Yes . 
 About 30 . He's really outgoing . But why do you ask ? 
 Fine , thank you . 
 Very well , thank you . I'm meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at twelve.Would you care to join us ? 
 That girl looks very attractive , doesn ’ t she ? 
 I ’ d like to , but there ’ s her boyfriend . He ’ s very broad-shouldered . 
 Do you prefer tall girls or short ones ? 
 We have different tastes . I like girls with short hair . I like tall girls - probably because I ’ m so tall myself . 
 No , never . I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever met a girl taller than me ! Have you gained weight recently ? 
 I'm getting a bit plump myself . Perhaps I ’ ll go with you . 
 Pretty bad . I ’ Ve had a bad cold for three days and still can ’ t get rid of it . 
 No , thanks . 
 Thank you for your concern . 
 Sure . I've got a copy here . It's due for renewal at the end of next month . We've still got time to look for another supplier if you're not happy . 
 Well , Mary types faster than Jones . But I think Jones types more carefully . 
 Jones can certainly take down letter more quickly , but Mary ’ s short hand is the best in her class . 
 Both of them speak excellent French . But I think Mary speaks German more fluently than Jones does . 
 Today is your birthday . First of all , happy birthday to you ! 
 Excuse me . Is anyone sitting here ? 
 You don ’ t mind if I smoke , do you ? 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry . But this isn ’ t a no-smoker , isn ’ t it ? I mean would you mind if I smoke here ? 
 Sign ? What ’ s sign ? 
 Oh , sorry . I didn ’ t notice it . Sorry . 
 I don't know whether or not to believe him . 
 But it's really too important to me . 
 I feel pity for the old man . 
 It must be dreadful to grow old . 
 Excuse me , sir . Could you spare a minute ? 
 Do you go to work by train every day . 
 And would you mind telling us what you think of the rail service ? 
 Why do you say that ? 
 Which train do you catch in the evening ? 
 And can you get a seat ? 
 Would you agree that the service is fast ? 
 So , how'd everyone do ? 
 Your vintage clock ? ! I just paid sixty-five dollars for it . 
 It must be my special touch . I think bargaining is in my blood ! 
 You are studying here , aren ’ t you ? 
 Do you like this campus ? 
 How come ? 
 Oh . It ’ s awful , but it can ’ t be helped . 
 Would you mind if I smoked ? 
 How do you feel about the TV series ? 
 Yes , I agree , but still a lot of people watch it . 
 I've brought some potato chips . Would you like some , Jack ? 
 That'll be fine . Thanks . 
 I forgot to bring it , but maybe Mary has some . Let's go and ask her . 
 No , he isn ’ t . 
 He is afraid of his father-in-law . 
 Do you mean lying to people for their good ? 
 It's hard to say . I mean , how can you judge what's good for them ? Maybe it is best to tell them the truth no matter what it is . 
 I know . If you're sure the truth will do harm , maybe you can choose not to tell it . 
 Come on in . Would you care for a drink ? 
 May , is the university a terrible place ? 
 Because you study day in and day out for the entrance exam . So I figure you would study even harder after you ’ Ve got in . 
 How do you know that ? You haven't got in yet . 
 Oh , really ? Were you not caught ? 
 What do you want to study in the university ? Have you thought about it ? 
 I will choose what I like . You don't know what a torture it is for me to study English , because I don't like English . 
 You can decide later . You will have choices before you submit your university application form . 
 Who is your favorite NBA star ? 
 Kobe ? I know him , the key guy of the Lakers , a heck of a NBA player . He is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense . 
 Maybe he is not good at rebounding ? 
 Kobe came to Beijing during this summer's Olympics . Did you go to the match between China and USA ? 
 Well then , what are your spoils ? 
 May I help you ? 
 Is there a problem ? 
 You should look it up on our computer . 
 What came up ? 
 I can try to get the book from a different library . 
 I will call you when I find it . 
 What happened ? 
 I hear little Bob has recovered . 
 The operation was very successful . 
 Are you in favor of having a trip during the spring break ? 
 How about the Yellow Mountains ? 
 Did you go to the movie yesterday ? 
 What did you think of it ? 
 I think it is the worst one I have ever seen . 
 I can't think the same . 
 I couldn't agree with you . 
 Don ’ t mention it . It ’ s my pleasure . Have you been to one of these large , sit-down dinner parties since you got to New Haven ? 
 Cookouts often start slowly . A two o ’ clock start means you arrive any time after two . 
 I was late getting back from the mall , but I ’ m hurrying . 
 Don ’ t worry . We won ’ t be the first . 
 I doubt if I can pass it . 
 But I often skip his classes , and he doesn't like me . 
 I must , if I want to pass the course . 
 Why ? 
 Don ’ t make a mountain out of molehill . I am sure he will do that on his payday . 
 Yeah . He ’ s almost become a slave , his wife is leading him by the nose . 
 Say , Anna , what are you doing tonight ? Would you like to go out ? 
 Well , how about tomorrow night ? Are you doing anything then ? 
 I'm going to see a musical . Would you like to come ? 
 All right ! Thanks ! 
 Again ? 
 Your clock never works . Perhaps you should buy a new one . 
 Maybe by then it will be too late . 
 By that time , you will be fired . 
 I go occasionally when there's a game on near home , but usually I watch it on TV . 
 Sometimes . But I'll never forget the game in which our Chinese Women's Volleyball Team won the World Cup . It is the most thrilling and exciting game I have ever seen . 
 The work is rather hard , but it's interesting . 
 I work in a publishing house . How about you ? 
 What do you do then ? 
 May I help you ? 
 Why don ’ t you try looking at the database ? 
 Do we have it available ? 
 I guess it is lost . 
 Yes , we will . 
 I can do that . 
 Can you help me figure out how to use this vending machine ? 
 I want to buy that candy . 
 Yeah , so far , so good . 
 Yeah , I already knew that . 
 OK , let's move on ! 
 I hope it works ! 
 What was your wedding ceremony like , Abigail ? 
 Three parties ? That's quite a lot . That must have been expensive ! 
 Were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ? 
 Did your husband's family get to meet your family ? 
 That makes sense . Did you go on a honeymoon ? 
 You really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ? 
 Did you read this ? It says that the number one new years resolution make is to spend more time with friends and family . 
 Well , think about it . We are a society that is always on the go , not because we have to , but because we want to . 
 We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary . 
 What ’ s the point ? We always make a new year ’ s resolution and by February we will have forgotten about it . It ’ s pointless . 
 What about you ? Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in . 
 Yeah , yeah , whatever . 
 I traveled the Three Gorges . 
 Yes , we had a good time . The trip was terrific . We toured the Three Gorges by boat . Its realty exciting ! 
 Yes . There are many places where the gorge is very narrow , with steep cliffs on both sides . 
 Yes , but we have life jackets . And we got a real kick out of that . 
 What do you think of his behaviour yesterday ? 
 I don't think so . He only had no common sense . 
 Well , you can just see the sea . Between the factory chimneys . 
 Well , it can't be helped . We'll just have to put up with it . 
 Not bad . Thank you . You look great today . And how is your husband ? 
 Well , I'm glad to hear that . Please give my regards to him . 
 Hello ! How are you . 
 What have you got ? A cough ? A cold ? 
 Perhaps you ’ Ve been working too hard . You do have a high-pressure job . 
 Well . I ’ m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . Dr . Jameson is very good . 
 OK . Hope you feel better soon . You should take it easy . I ’ m sure the doctor will prescribe rest , you know . 
 Yes . The German engineer would never dreamed that the hand - supported scooter he invented several years ago to solve his traffic problems would become so fashionable in the Occident within a few years and even spread to Japan and China . 
 Small and exquisite in size , easy to operate , foldable and easy to carry are its charms . 
 Hi , dear , do you know what the important day is today ? 
 Please think it over . 
 Come on , dear . I know you mustn ’ t forget it . 
 Ur , you really let me down . 
 No , you haven ’ t . You just don ’ t care about me . You ’ re an indifferent husband . 
 It ’ s an anniversary of our weeding . 
 I don ’ t know . 
 Oh , I see . 
 It ’ s Saturday , a great weekend . 
 Don ’ t be angry with me . I have a bad memory . 
 What day is it on earth ? 
 Let ’ s call it a day . 
 It ’ s hard to commute a long way . 
 How was your trip to America ? 
 Did you go to the Magic Kingdom ? 
 How do you like these dishes ? 
 Did you enjoy your dinner ? 
 Would you like some more rice ? 
 Another piece of meat pie ? 
 How about the dessert ? 
 What was the movie you saw last night ? 
 Really ? I've seen that movie , too . 
 I thought it was pretty good . 
 You're kidding . The storyline and acting were outstanding . 
 It might be . 
 What are you talking about ? Where is your Halloween spirit ? Didn ’ t you ever dress up in a costume and go around the neighborhood trick-or-treating with your friends ? 
 Whatever , I ’ m going next door I heard Mrs . Robinson is giving out big bags of M & Ms ! 
 That's good , but I think it's too late . She hasn't studied all semester , and I doubt she can catch up in one week . 
 Hi . My name is Dolma . 
 Good to meet you too . 
 I was born in Beijing in 1965 . 
 Really ? Thank you . 
 Can ’ t be better , it was wonderful . We had a lot of fun there . There was so much joy and walk and breathe the winter air . We arrived at the park at 9 o ’ clock in the morning and didn ’ t leave till 3 o ’ clock in the afternoon . 
 Of course not ! We built a snowman , some snow dogs and one big snow fort . We went sliding on the nice hill . It was a real work out . At noon , we had the most special winter picnic outside . Fortunately , we got it all on a video tape . You must come with us next time . I bet you will love it . 
 Do you believe in horoscope fortune-telling ? 
 That sounds interesting . Have you been involved in any mystery ? 
 What did it say about you then ? 
 But it must have been only a coincidence . That's the only way superstition wins over science . 
 For fun . It serves as a shared topic to them.While they claim to consult the predictions constantly and marvel at their " accuracy ' . they do not necessarily take them seriously . When it that these predictions are matched by their real-life experiences , they delight in spreading the thrill with friends . But if there isn't any correlation between reality and predictions , they just grin , forget about them , and go on living as usual . 
 Yeah . Sometimes I just cannot accept his behavior . 
 OK , it ’ s better to be far away from him . 
 Yeah.The autumn is marvelous here . 
 That's a hard time.The air is cold and damp , and the road is often icy . 
 Sure . 
 Plenty.We never worry about lack of rainwater in our area . 
 That's right . 
 I ’ m not crazy about it at all . 
 I ’ m not interested in it . Are you keen on it ? 
 I hate it . 
 It ’ s the worst thing I ’ Ve ever tried . 
 Yup . I have English at 9 in the morning . 
 Not really . What about you ? 
 Sure . I need to return some books . They are due today . Besides , I can also read some weekly publications , magazines and newspapers . 
 That sounds like a good idea . We can chill out a little in such a hot summer . Are you good at swimming ? 
 Oh , it's almost 9 . I need to hurry . I am running late now . See you after class in front of the library then . Bye ! 
 Linda , would you care for some candies or cookies ? 
 You are not really chubby . You are actually thin enough . 
 So you are watching your weight , aren't you ? 
 Did you listen to the weather forecast ? 
 There's a typhoon coming . 
 Yep , it should be here by tomorrow night . 
 She's my roommate , not my date . The D-man , as in dork . 
 Alrighty then . Didn't you use to date Sheryl ? 
 Oh ? I heard she dumped you . Anyway , she's right over there . Oh , Sheryl ! 
 I wish it could be Germany . But it seems they are not in a very good conditions . 
 It seems they've been out of luck since the beginning of the event . Their shots hit the woodwork as many as six times . Oh . my goodness ! I'm afraid the team is under a spell . 
 I agree . Eeven though German attackers are not good at dribbling past opposing defenders , they breach the defensive line through quick movements to the right attacking positions and through accurate , well-timed passes . 
 Yes . They have a good reputation for their tenacity and discipline , especially in vital , decisive encounters . 
 Because it was her husband who beat her . 
 She said that she didn ’ t want to foul her own nest . 
 Well , it's hard to say . I cough a lot in the evening . 
 You're right , but you know , it's hard to give up an old habit . 
 You know , I often have to work till late at night . I need something to keep me awake . 
 Thank you for your advice ! I'll try it . 
 He appeals to the fans thanks to two things 
 Certainly not . What really counts is to play as a team , passing the ball amongst each other , dodging defenders . Free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts . However , a few free k 
 yes , his face looks are manly , with a straight nose and infinite eyes . As a man of medium height in the West , he keeps a powerful but elegant figure , looking neither lanky nor stout . 
 What are you reading ? You've had your nose buried in that book since last night . 
 I haven't read a book like that for as long as I can remember . 
 Can I read it when you're finished ? 
 Don't tell me anything about it . I want to read it for myself . 
 Did you have a part-time job when you were still in school ? 
 Yeah . I worked about 20 hours a week in a pizza restaurant . 
 It was always very busy there . 
 I stood behind the register and took pizza orders . 
 Yeah . I got to eat as much pizza as I could for free . 
 Glad to meet you mr smith my name is jenny . 
 How could I feel easy ? I ’ m really pissed . 
 Ok . I ’ ll try my best to calm down first . 
 It is . It ’ s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world , with brief descriptions of how they were build , their purpose , and so on . 
 They don ’ t now , but most of them did originally . There ’ s picture of the pentagon in the united states . It ’ s very distinctive with its five sides . 
 Yes . Usually only TV towers are cylindrical in shape . 
 This is the world ’ s largest sports stadium . It ’ s a massive oval . 
 It says here that it ’ s m mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings . 
 According to the book , it is . I ’ Ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . Look at the building . From the air , it looks like a square with a semi-circle attached to each of its four sides . What 
 Hey Bobby . What's going on ? 
 I forgot my cigarette today . Do you have another one ? 
 Thanks . 
 Really ? I've been smoking for over a year now . 
 You ever tried to quit ? 
 Yeah . I tried to quit last month , and I thought it was going to be easy , but it turns out that I'm still smoking . 
 I think you're right . Aright . Gotta go to class . Thanks for the cigarette . I'll talk to you later . 
 Do you know who ’ s just got married ? Old Mc Donald . 
 He ’ s nearly 90 . 
 I am . Whatsmore , his wife is 84 . 
 Yes , she is . And guess what , he is her sixth husband . 
 What did you do last night ? 
 Did you watch the Barcelona versus Madrid game ? 
 What were the results of the game ? 
 What was the actual score ? 
 Really ? I thought Barcelona was going to win . They are a much better team than Madrid . 
 What happened ? 
 That explains it . 
 That was the last game before the playoffs . 
 In a few weeks . Are you planning on watching them ? 
 Me , too ! Do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place ? I'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together . 
 Ok , it's a date then ! 
 I'm sorry for hero . I dont think there's any excuse for his acting in some parts . 
 Last weekend I didn't want to go out either , so I stayed at home and played video games by myself . It was really fun ! 
 Yeah , I'm really into video games . In fact , all my friends are on the Internet . I've never met any of them in the real world . 
 Hello , Pam . 
 It looks like there are a lot of people inside . 
 Should I take my shoes off ? 
 Where are your parents ? 
 That's great ! 
 What for ? 
 Sorry , I don't feel like playing . I have too much homework . 
 What ? Won't you have more drinks ? 
 Oh ! I'm sorry , but I wish you could stay . 
 Don't mention it . You can come whenever You are free . 
 Not really . It's much warmer usually . Your are not used to cold weather ? 
 Well , You'd better get some more warm clothes . 
 I would say it's about 5 degree Celsius . 
 August 1st . 
 Yes , we do.My parents prepare dinner for me . 
 We sing " Happy Birthday " at the party and have birthday cakes . 
 Well , I don't know . 
 So the " Happy Birthday " song has been popular since then ? 
 What do you think of your teacher ? 
 And I hear he gives very good lectures . 
 I ’ Ve got a new boss . 
 Well , he ’ s got dark hair and brown eyes . 
 And a white sports car . 
 Yes , but he ’ s got a wife and 3 children as well . 
 That's all tight , Mr.Smith.That ' s my job . I'm very glad he recovered so soon . 
 No trouble at all . He's very cute and brave . By the way , do remember to keep him away from sea food for at least two weeks . 
 Would you like to have dinner with me tonight ? 
 I ’ ll pick you up at ... say , seven thirty ? 
 See you tonight then . 
 Excuse me , could you tell me where you have got that music book ? 
 It's too high . I can't reach it . Could you help me ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 She will insist . It's a rosary . She has millions of them . Take it . 
 Oh ! My grandmother used to say “ raising pigs , raising kids ... at least you can eat the pigs . ” 
 She likes to complain about her macho husband and her “ bambinos ” , but she loves them all dearly . 
 Sure ! How about we go home and prepare a couple of sandwiches ? 
 All you ever do is have unhealthy fast food Pizza , fries , burgers and hot dogs ! You have to start eating better ! 
 Yeah right ! I ’ m serious ! You should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . You drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! It ’ s really not healthy ! 
 It ’ s a start , but I ’ ll be happy when I see you stick to your promise ! 
 Yes , we are . 
 In the spring . 
 Well .. we're not sure yet , probably in St.Albans . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 We're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in South London . 
 Yes , probably but I may look for another one when we're settled in . 
 How much is it ? Is three hundred dollars enough ? 
 Oh , you've already grown up , son . 
 I feel the same way . 
 Yeah . He has no one to count on . 
 I ’ m flattered , but really anyone else could do it . 
 I ’ m thinking of making an album , you know . 
 Why ? 
 It is because your children have grown up , and you haven ’ t lived with a child for a long time . 
 Yes , the fried chicken is too hard to eat . I suggest you bring me another one free of charge . 
 OK . I will talk to him direcly . 
 He said his present job seemed to be a blind alley . 
 I want to buy a gift for my father . Will you go with me to choose one for him ? 
 Don't you know ? Tomorrow is Father's Day . 
 You also need to choose a gift for your father , right ? 
 Jane is going to quit her job in the bank . 
 It's true , but she says she is tired of counting others ' money . 
 A few months . 
 Great ! I'm having a great time . 
 Great ! I would like to see cute pandas , too . 
 We can take the MET and get off at the Zoo Station . 
 ( At the zoo ) Wow ! This zoo is really huge . 
 Look at the map . It has different areas , such as marine lives , mammals , polar animals and insects . 
 We have to go to the mammal area . We are at the gate right now . We need to go straight from here and turn left and go along to the end and make anotherleft turn . 
 Finding an excuse is obviously down your alley . And trying to avoid taking care of the children is what you are good at . 
 You are passing the buck . I'll be hanged if I ask you to go to the park with us . 
 Thank you for showing me your offices , Mr . Becker . I can see why Washington bureaucrats enjoy their jobs . 
 The city is beautiful , the off ... , the offices are modern and comfortable , and the work is so interesting . 
 Do you mean financially rewarding ? 
 I've always thought that most bureaucrats are lazy . 
 How much do you make ? 
 I just got fired . 
 Hello ? 
 Not yet . And I ’ m really hungry now . 
 Why not ? 
 Thanks . I could eat a cow . 
 Sorry , but I ’ m not really interested in those things . 
 Really . 
 Oh , I don ’ t care about that . 
 Are they ? 
 I ’ m afraid I ’ m not interested in fashion . 
 But thank you very much all the same . 
 Hi . What's up ? 
 Not too much . I've been pretty busy . 
 Gotta go . Call me tonight . 
 Hey , what sort of drinks do you want ? Gatorade or water ? 
 Yes , that ’ s the exact thing we need . One for each . 
 We should choose from the backups . 
 That ’ s why we should learn to protect ourselves . Otherwise , the game is not worth the candle . 
 Yes , I played shooting guard , I like shooting and you ’ ll play inside , OK ? 
 Wow , the cheer-section is coming . The music is so fantastic . 
 Well , you should ask your friend . You know I ’ m not the boss . Just kidding . 
 Yeah , what ’ s up ? 
 I also have a doubt . Oh , kill me softly , she is May . 
 Thanks for inviting me . Here is the gift for you . Happy birthday , Francis ! Many more happy and healthy years for you ! 
 Yes , please do . 
 Yeah , I was really struggling whether I should give you this nice little car . It was the last one they had and I really like it so much myself . 
 Hi , Mark ! Long time no see ! 
 Where have you been ? 
 How was your flight ? 
 That ’ s too bad . How long was the flight ? 
 Did you have a layover ? 
 Did you buy anything in the duty-free stores ? 
 Oh , you didn ’ t have to ... 
 I wish our competition will quit poaching our people , when Susan resigned last week to work for the Sunburst , she was our fourth employee to leave us for them . 
 Well , those do leave will soon find out the grass isn't as green on the other side of sense as they thought it was , I know Sunburst is suffering from inbreeding . 
 With Susan leaving , we should probably look to someone new on board . 
 Maybe we should start shopping around the competitors people . 
 Yes , I had a bf before . 
 We parted from each other last month . 
 Mmmm , no . How about you ? 
 Haha , so you are my E-bf . 
 Mmmm . .. OK , let's try to be . 
 Hey ! What is it ? 
 LL 
 I have no champagne right now . How about this ? 
 Is it made of chocolate ? 
 Oh , I will have a sweet dream . 
 A little bit . I have to go to sleep though I don't want to . 
 Thx.Bye for now . Kisssssssssss . 
 Hello , Kevin . 
 Thanks . You too . 
 Cloudy in the morning , overcast in the afternoon . 
 No , but I wouldn't be surprised if it rained tomorrow . 
 Which do you like better , orange or lemon ? 
 Why ? 
 You hurt Ben's feelings . 
 have you ever seen Bill Gate's home on the internet ? 
 it's got its own library , theatre , swimming pool , and a guest house . The house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through 
 I think his house is fantastic , but I wouldn't want to live there . You would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house , plus a few people to take care of the gardens , and pro 
 my dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quite village in England . 
 old homes are great because they've got character . I think that's important . 
 no , that's just because I don't have enough money to buy new cloths all the time ! 
 no , I'd definitely try to restore it to its original state . I love to imagine what it'd be like to live in another time in history and living in a house decorated like it would have been 200 years a 
 It takes two to make a quarrel and it takes two to mend fences . 
 You're just left school , haven't you , Emily ? 
 You sound relieved . 
 Well , what are you going to do now ? Have you made any plans ? 
 You mean getting into university actually depends on your passing your A level subjects ? 
 That was a great dinner . I didn't know that you knew how yo cook . 
 I don't know . I'm pretty full . What are we having ? 
 Ooh , that's my favorite . Maybe I'll have a small slice . 
 I'll have a cup of tea . 
 Actually , could I have some milk with that ? 
 Skim , please . That'd be very nice . Thanks ... oh no . Janna , I'm so sorry , but I've got to go . 
 I just got a message from my sister saying that she's been in a car accident . I need to go pick her up . 
 She's on the M40 , near Reading . 
 I don't know , she didn't say . I'm so sorry about this . 
 Actually , I've only got a two-seater . I'll have to go on my own . 
 I will . Thanks a lot . 
 Yes , to tell you the truth , there is . 
 Well , I've lost my wallet and my ID card . 
 Forget it , there is no use crying over the spilled milk . 
 It ’ s good . But to tell you the truth , I don ’ t wear perfume . 
 That ’ s all right . Thank you all the same . 
 There are a few stories about natural disasters . There is a massive forest fire in Australia . It covers several square kilometers of land has destroyed many more square kilometers . 
 Nobody knows at the moment , but it has been very hot there recently . The drought in Africa is causing starvation . Millions of people have migrated to try and find food . 
 The European union has sent several plants with relief supplies . Several countries have sent soldiers to distribute food and medical supplies . Refugee camps have been set up across the region . 
 Six have been seriously affected , but the refugees are also migrating to several surrounding countries . 
 Yes . There have been a few there recently . They say that this one was not a big quake . The Iranians are dealing with it on their own . They have purchased some special equipment to find people buried under rubble . 
 So far , less than 20 people have died , but over 100 are in hospital . 
 I think Hebes is a good place . 
 Really ? 
 How do these storms affect the people who live in these areas ? 
 It sounds that sandstorms are trouble for everybody ! 
 hi , how are you doing ? 
 same here . Have you seen any new films recently ? 
 oh , really ? I saw it two years ago . It's worth seeing and it's thought-provoking . 
 it reflects some of our difficulties in this ever-changing world . 
 well , it's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend end quickly too . 
 oh , that's too short-lived . 
 I can't agree more . The only-child generation in China tends to know little about marriage . 
 in their mind , love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone . 
 We should keep Frank at arm's length . 
 He hits below the belt . 
 Did you read the letter in the paper about smoking ? The person who wrote that must be crazy . 
 Maybe so . But a law banning cigarettes would do no good . 
 So Beth , what kind of music do you listen to ? 
 I mostly listen to pop music , but I like a lot of different stuff . 
 Tomorrow's Carl's birthday ? 
 Good idea ! Let's make ready , then . 
 Honey , we're in the museum now . We're not here to discuss your coworker's love life . We're here to enjoy the great paintings by Picasso ! 
 You're making a federal case out of it . One unhealthy love affair can't ruin anything . It could even make your life more interesting . 
 All I'm trying to say is that life is ... like ... er ... this painting . 
 All right , if that would make you happy . 
 Well , nothing really serious . 
 Well , I'm an English major , you know.So I came here to make sure I'm taking the right things . 
 I want to finish my degree in four years.So I don't want to forget to take classes I need . I have a friend who has to stay in college another year.She didn't know until recently . There were some classes she needed to take to graduate.She didn't know about them . 
 I brought my transcript from my first year.Here . And here is the list of courses I plan to take in the fall . 
 No , I don't need to . I took Advanced Placement English in high school.So I'm not required to take composition . 
 No , I thought I would take it later . 
 Well , I suppose I could cross out the 18th century poetry class . I have to see when the Shakespeare class meets . 
 I can take it then . I have that time slot free . 
 I'll take it then . 
 I want to be an English professor in the future . I love studying literature , and I want to teach it . 
 That's the reason I want to finish my B . A . in four years.Because I know I will be in school a long time . I want to start the M . A . and Ph . D . program as soon as possible . 
 it was wonderful , but I was so tired . 
 yes , that was the first thing we did . We went all the way to the top . There were visitors from all over the world taking photos there . 
 art galleries , cathedrals , statues , fountains , palaces , bistros , there's really too much to say . 
 yes , at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . However , on the third day of traveling in the city , I felt sick . I think I had something bad to eat , but it passed by the evening . 
 on the fouth day , we went to taste the French cuisine . That was really fantastic ! And no stomach problems . 
 you'll have to try for yourself some day . 
 Yes , Miss , what can I do for you ? 
 I'm sorry for that , I'm going to check with the chef right now . Miss , I just checked with the kitchen , and they said your order will be coming right up next . Oh , here comes . 
 Miss , I'm very sorry for the delay , please enjoy this . Free a glass of wine for inconvenience . Again I'm terribly sorry to make you wait so long . 
 How do you like this waltz ? 
 Well , then , may I invite you for the first dance ? 
 Me ? Oh , no . In fact , I took up dancing quite recently . 
 I'm glad you say so , you dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got a partner . 
 Yes . And what dances do you do best ? 
 Oh , well , the music has stopped . Thank you for the dance . 
 Fine . 
 We are going to climb a cliff on the Yangtze River . 
 It is a very difficult climb , because there are not many places to put your hands and feet . 
 We rappelled down the side of a 300 - foot cliff . It's very exciting . 
 Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb . 
 Ok , see you . 
 There are 15 people in my family . 
 15 people . 
 Of course we do ! My father's parents , Mum , Dad , three unmarried aunts , two uncles , my two brothers , my three sisters and me . 
 Right , but that's where my heart is . But you're right , now there are only 14 living at home . 
 Yes . My family lives in rural Korea , near Pusan . We have a huge house.The first floor of the house is a part-time private school.In the afternoon , students come for special tutoring in biology , Englis 
 My aunts and uncles are all teachers . 
 I guess so . While growing up , I read hundreds of interesting English storybooks every year . 
 I agree . Reading for fun is why all the English students at our family school have excellent English . All the students read 800 easy storybooks during their second year of studying English . 
 My aunts studied in the American universities.They say that extensive reading for fun is the most effective way to improve your English.That ' s what they learn here in America . 
 Uh well ... would you like the bad news first or the really bad news ? 
 Well sir , our sales have dropped , no plunged , fifty percent in the past month alone . We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits refalling fast . The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory , or getting rid of our staff . If we consider redundancies , it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages . It ’ s a real mess . 
 Um ... how can I put this ? Let ’ s just say that at this pace , we will be filing for Chapter eleven in less than three months . 
 Oh , that ’ s the really bad news . Our supplier suffered QC problems and , well , half of our production is faulty . We ’ re going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter . And the worst part ? We ’ re going to have to shoulder this cost . 
 We tried that , sir . The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country . 
 There is some really good news though ! 
 I got offered a new job ! 
 I ’ Ve been a secretary for two years , before that I was at university . 
 It ’ s challenging , I feel I have learned a lot . 
 I get along well with people , and I enjoy working with others . 
 I'm exhausted . My new exercise class is so hard , 
 You thing so ? 
 Tomorrow morning . Try it . 
 Are you going to this class this morning ? 
 You're no able to move after this class . 
 You want to bet ? 
 I bet I can go one hour in your class this morning and not feel a thing . 
 Yes , Ms . Jones . 
 Professor , where's Canada ? 
 Can you show me on the map ? 
 Oh , I see . Where's Mexico ? 
 How about Connecticut ? Where's that ? 
 What state is west of Pennsylvania ? 
 OK , Where's Los Angeles ? 
 Where's Boston . 
 Where is Las Vegas ? 
 What kind of books do you like ? 
 Really ? Me too . 
 I prefer the novels by Hemingway , such as The Old Man and the Sea . I like the simple words in his novels . 
 Absolutely ! 
 If she has , they must be fair-weather friends . 
 She'd better keep away from them . 
 I guess so . Now Anna's got four kids and another on the way . 
 That's Anna for you . She keeps up the image of the stylish Italian woman . Here she comes . 
 Yeah , or the expensive Italian facial treatments . 
 Hi , Nancy . Come in please . I'm just putting away on my books . 
 Yes , I ’ m going to take a holiday tomorrow . 
 That's all right . I'm almost finished . Do you need my help ? 
 Oh . All right I'll read it soon . 
 It's nothing Nancy . 
 My dissertation . I put it somewhere last night and I can't find it now . 
 Yes , I kept on typing it until midnight , but it is lost . 
 Yes , but there is nothing inside the drawers or on the desk . 
 I've searched everywhere . Where on earth did I put it ? 
 I have been working on it for a whole month and it's too late to write another . Just think of all my hard work that goes for nothing . How could I do such a thing ? 
 Let me see . Yes , that's it . Where did you find it ? 
 My poor memory . Thank you very much . 
 I think he was locked in it . 
 What a strange guy ! 
 He's late again . Traffic is probably holding him up . You know , he commutes from the suburbs . It's not easy commuting every day . We should cut him some slack . 
 Oh , that's right . Well , the train shouldn't be late . That means there is only one explanation ... Bill must have overslept . 
 That's right , because he's got to get to the train station from his house , then take the blue line into the city , then switch trains to the red line . In all , the trip's got to take more than 2 hours . 
 It's too difficult to park your car in the city . Also , the traffic coming in from the suburbs is a nightmare . 
 Take the books out of the bookcase . Put them in this box . 
 Take the magazines out of the bookcase . Put them in that box . 
 Peter ! Pack them . Don't read them . 
 Of course . 
 This is great , isn't it ? 
 We should do this more often . 
 What do you think of his behaviour yesterday ? 
 I don't think so . He only had no common sense . 
 Yes . What a good job we have done ! 
 Many customers didn't want them . 
 Good idea . 
 I'm not sure , but still it did attract a large crowds today . 
 But people can just throw them into the trash can as they turn around . 
 Anyway , let's just finish out job and get back home . 
 I'm afraid of the darkness . 
 Thank you . 
 I'm number seven . What about you ? 
 Hah hah ! You have to go before me . 
 Don't worry . It's safe . 
 You are the one who wanted to come here , Sandy . You should enjoy it . 
 I'm not too scared . But I've done sky diving before . 
 I think so too . It's just pointless . 
 I don't know . Maybe they're really crazy . 
 Hi ! Dick . Where are you going ? You're in such a hurry . 
 What are you going to play ? 
 Enjoy yourself . 
 I always meet people like him . 
 Look , most of the maple leaves have turned red . 
 Of course , my father used to take me to Kiang Shan or somewhere like that as a child . 
 Honey , I'm sorry . I promise you , this summer vacation , I will take you to Huang-Shan Mountains . It is more beautiful and magnificent . 
 Yes , I went there five years ago . You were still a baby at that time . 
 Surely . You can enjoy the beauty of numerous streams and waterfalls . The sea of clouds has a fairy tale beauty . 
 That depends . If you are lucky , you can see a vivid rainbow across over two peaks . 
 He has reached puberty . His mind and body both will change a lot . 
 Time is flying . I still remember everything when he was a child . 
 Usually for lunch , we don't have to reserve a table , they should allow walk-ins . But to be on the safe side , I'll order a table for half-past twelve . Will that suit your schedule ? 
 Are you planning on treating the investors to a full-course meal ? 
 That'll be pretty heavy for a mid-day meal , don't you think ? 
 With your prime rib and chicken choices , you'd better hope nobody's vegetarian . 
 Too much , Harry . Don't blame her anymore . 
 I know . But there's no point in making her feel worse , isn't there ? 
 Hi Jane , can you let me know the best way to get to your house this evening ? 
 I need to be in the city centre this afternoon so I will be coming straight from there . 
 Got that . 
 Hold on , I am looking at the map now . Ok , I can see Horntown Road . Do I go straight at the intersection ? 
 Ok , I can see that road . 
 Good , I can see the library on the map . 
 That's great , see you at seven . 
 What ? 
 Wow ! Congratulation ! When do classes start ? 
 You ’ re so lucky ! Do you have to do many things before you leave ? 
 When can you do that ? 
 Sure . What can you choose from ? 
 What is your major ? 
 What are the fundamental course ? 
 Interesting . That ’ s very different from the Chinese education system . 
 Really ? 
 why not ? 
 Hey John , nice skates . Are they new ? 
 What position do you play ? 
 Yeah , you ’ re a pretty big guy . I play goalie , myself . 
 The Rockets . 
 All right , see you later . 
 Yes , we do . 
 It's 3 nights a week , Monday , Tuesday and Thursday . 
 It lasts for 9 months . 
 The next beginning class starts on October 25th . 
 From 7 to 9 o'clock . 
 It costs 125 dollars a month . 
 Thank you , please fill out this form for us . 
 Yes , please.we need a record of you education and your work experiences . 
 No , thanks . I have some trouble with my heart , my doctor recommend I to drink less . 
 All right 
 Yes . 
 Sure , come on in . 
 My father and sister are out to photographing . What about you ? 
 What is a back-packer ? 
 Cool . You must have been to a lot of places . 
 So cool . I want to be a back-packer when I grow up . 
 I'll try my best . 
 Thank you . Hey , do you know how espresso got its name ? 
 It's because of the way the steam and boiling water are pressed through the coffee . Es-PRESS-o , get it ? 
 Hello ! 
 Please allow me to introduce myself . My name is Tom . 
 Yes , I did . Have you lived here long ? 
 No , not really . When I left Vietnam , I came to America and I lived with a cousin in Dallas for two years . Where do you work , Alice ? 
 I am an accountant at a company 
 It's nice meeting you too , Alice . 
 Goodbye , Alice . 
 Hi Tom ! I'm fine , and you ? 
 Good . See you ! 
 You like movies ? 
 What type do you like the best ? 
 I see . I generally like movies to help calm me down . I think a sign of a good movie is the ability to bring you into the story as if you were part of it . 
 True . The movie industry is becoming more and more commercial . You see a lot of expensive movies with little artistic value . I generally think those made in the forties are of higher quality on the average than movies today . You can name a lot of classics from that decade . 
 I'm totally with you on that . 
 Here ’ s an ad . about a big sale of washing machine . Do you want to see it ? 
 Hey , your Chinese is coming along ! 
 Yeah . It ’ s a lot better than mine . 
 Hang in there . It ’ ll all come together one of these days . 
 And then what ? 
 That sounds boring to me . 
 Yes , I think I will do something new . I ’ Ve always wanted to be a teacher . I ’ m willing to begin studying to teach . 
 What colour is her hair ? 
 What , curly ? 
 Does she wear glasses ? 
 No . I'm sure I know her . 
 Ah ... No , I can't place her . 
 Yes . 
 I have two kids . A boy and a girl . 
 Jack and Stephanie . 
 Stephanie is 18 and Jack is 24 . 
 Stephanie is . She goes to college in Washington and Jack works in Florida . 
 She studies English . 
 No , she's at school . 
 Yes . It's perfect . 
 I couldn't have asked for more . 
 Is the math wrong or the way the answer was marked ? 
 These things can happen ; let's double-check the answers first to be sure , all right ? 
 Look at the answer sheet and compare it to your answers . Do you see any place where I made a mistake in grading ? 
 Yeah , I see the same thing ; now we can do the math and check that , right ? 
 I count all of the correct answers , total them , and divide by the total . Does this look right to you ? 
 Thank you for caring enough to check on your scores ; keep studying ! 
 I have a part-time job now , so I work in the evenings . 
 Mrs . Schmidt ! What's happening ! 
 And the doctor told you to start listening to Bach ? 
 Congratulations ! 
 And they said you should play classical music ? 
 Guess what ! I know something you don't know ! 
 How many planets are there in the solar system ? 
 Not anymore ! Can you believe it ? They've decided that Pluto is not a planet anymore ! 
 I'm dead serious . They've decided that it's too small to be a planet , but actually they haven't yet agreed on how big something has to be in order to be a planet anymore . 
 Yes , they can . If you remember correctly , people used to believe that the world was flat . 
 We actually know relatively little about space and the cosmos . 
 I suppose we could actually live on a planet outside of the milky way . 
 I hope not . I think they would be a threat to those of us that lived on the Earth . 
 Point taken . Hopefully one day , we'll live in an interplanetary society . 
 Yes , I finished last Friday . 
 Well , yes . I don't mind admitting that I am . I enjoyed school , but I did object to having to go in every day once we've done all our exams . 
 Yes , I intend to go to university . That'll be in September . But it all depends on my A level results . 
 Oh , yes . 
 I'm sorry , I overslept . 
 Hello , Jack . It's Mary . What are you doing in your office ? 
 Would you like to come and have dinner with us on Friday ? 
 What about Saturday ? 
 Will you come round next Tuesday ? 
 What do you say to next Wednesday then ? 
 Ok . Bye . 
 It's snowing outside . 
 Let's go out and have a look . 
 Look at the snow , it's so beautiful . 
 I love winter , I love snow . 
 But I like cold more than hot . 
 How often do you have English lessons ? 
 How do you practice ? 
 Do you ever speak to native speakers of English ? 
 What happened to that girl you were seeing ? 
 That was a short relationship . You only started dating 2 months ago . 
 What do you mean ? 
 She sounds very emotional . 
 Were you suppose to be there ? 
 Ok . You're right . She's a psycho . 
 Adam . I ’ m sorry . 
 Yes , But I couldn ’ t help it . I was late getting off work for a start and then I miss the bus . The bus I did catch that stuck in the traffic jam . It was one thing after another . 
 Yes . But those are the rush in that moment . And my boss ask me to do some urgent letters . 
 Well , no . I thought I ‘ Ve finish in five minutes . and I didn ’ t want to be difficult about just few minutes , if I hadn ’ t been missing the bus and in the traffic I wouldn ’ t have been so late . I ’ m sorry . 
 How was the movie last night ? 
 Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography . 
 She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see . 
 Nothing is to your satisfaction . 
 You've done a lot , my darling ! 
 You're too strict with yourself . 
 Would you like to come to our party ? 
 What happened ? You look so pale . 
 What makes you say that ? 
 Oh , that's too bad . Work harder next term . 
 Don't lose heart . Everything will be fine . 
 What do you think of the lawyer's speech ? 
 Don't believe him . He's liar . 
 hey , the new SOHO . How's everything going ? 
 your office ? Aren't you a freelancer ? 
 a virtual office ? 
 what kind of services do they offer ? 
 sounds fun.what else ? 
 oh , that helps a lot to promote your corporate image . 
 I just love your hair that way . 
 Where did you have it done ? 
 Just yesterday . I'm still getting used to it . 
 Thanks . 
 It certainly was a great party . It ’ s a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here . 
 I doubt it , I'll deal with it right away . Luckily it wasn ’ t a glass of red wine , I ’ ll just get a bowl of water and a cloth . 
 Afterwards , we can do the washing up together . Everything will be finished within an hour . Your friend Keith is really funny . I liked his magic tricks . 
 Amanda told some very funny jokes . At the beginning of the party , she was being very serious . 
 What did you put in that punch ? It tasted great , but was quite strong . 
 Very much . The birthday cake was delicious , wasn ’ t it ? Emily told me that she and karen made it themselves . 
 All cleaned up . Are you ready to start on the washing up ? 
 I know but I have no choice . My stomach just keeps crying for more and more . 
 I've been going to the gym these days . The exercise makes me hungry all the time . 
 Don't pull my leg . 
 Surely not . I can feel the results . I'm starting to feel different now . 
 I'm planning to meet my personal trainer to have the work-out plan fixed . 
 Your father is a bit too timid . He even doesn't know how to introduce himself . 
 Girl , don't make fun of your Daddy . But I can introduce him to my personal trainer . Maybe one day he will be a fitness freak instead of a cough potato . 
 Look , Bob . This is a photograph I took during my trip to Australia . 
 They ’ re people I met during the trip . That ’ s the ship we traveled on . 
 That ’ s the man I told you about . Remember ? 
 That ’ s right . 
 Guess ! 
 That ’ s right . I grew a beard during the trip , but I shaved it off when I came home . 
 My wife didn ’ t like it ! 
 Yes . Why ? 
 Just asking ? ! Why is your face burning like mad ? Ah-huh , someone has a crush on Jenny , doesn't he ? 
 Come on , Ted ! Don't be such a chicken . If you like her , you ’ Ve got to tell her . Maybe she likes you . 
 What are you so afraid of ? Just tell her what you are feeling about her . 
 But that's better than keeping everything to yourself . You ’ Ve got to let her know . Come on ! You ’ Ve got to take a chance . Even though you are rejected , it ’ s not the end of the world . There ’ s nothing to lose , is there ? 
 Susan has got the cancer of stomach . 
 Yesterday when I went to hospital to see her , you cannot imagine how greatly surprised when I saw her . 
 Because of atomic cocktail and other medicines , all of them have the side effect . she has lost all her hair . 
 No , thanks . I have got to work overtime . 
 Well , I am . I'll have to finish this report for next Monday's meeting . Is Tom coming to pick you up ? 
 That's nice . Where is his villa ? 
 Sometimes I envy you a lot . Tom is a good guy . 
 I know , but I am a work maniac . 
 Have a nice weekend . 
 Did she mention anything else ? 
 See you . 
 Are you crazy ? Tomorrow's Saturday . 
 Americans also don't go to work on Saturdays . 
 Right . What are you going to do tonight ? 
 On a Friday night ? 
 Thanks a million . 
 Jacob , are you interested in helping me out and going on a blind date with a friend of mine ? 
 Well , she's got a beautiful face and long curly red hair . 
 She's fairly tall , maybe 2 inches taller than me . 
 Not at all . She's actually very athletic . 
 No , but she does wear contact lenses . 
 She's got a gorgeous complexion with a few freckles on her nose . 
 I think she has her ears pierced and she definitely has a few tattoos , one on her lower back , one on her neck , and one on her left foot . 
 It's a butterfly---everyone in her family has one . 
 Yes , even her mother . 
 She's a lot like me . 
 Good morning , Jason . How did you sleep ? 
 Great ! So , are you ready for a full day of shopping ? 
 I know a place that should be perfect . It's called the China Friendship Shopping Center and it's pretty much like an American mall - except with more variety . You can even buy a live chicken there if you want . 
 Well . I'll be honest and say you'll never be as good at bargaining as a local person . You're a foreigner and the sellers can see that . But ... if you're smart , you can get bargains that are not too far away from the local price . 
 For starters , you want to do a lot of scouting first . You've got to know what things cost . 
 That could be helpful . But when you go into a shopping center ... prices become very flexible . You have to be able to read the market . 
 That sounds great ! I ’ d love to ! Here is my address . Pick me up at eight ? 
 Thank you for such a lovely evening ! The food was amazing , and I had a great time . 
 What is it ? 
 Hey , you ’ re early ! Where ’ s everyone ? 
 Oh ... why ? 
 Sure . What is it ? 
 Are you serious ? We ’ Ve been friends for years ! We can ’ t just change that overnight ! 
 I ... I ... 
 Well , I nearly always get up at dawn . I don ’ t like sleeping in late . The days are longer in summer than in winter , so I get up in summer . I usually do some exercise when I get up . 
 I usually have cereal , but sometimes I cook a traditional English breakfast . 
 I usually do housework in mornings . I go shopping occasionally . I like to do all my shopping in one bag trip to the supermarket . I always drive to the big supermarket in the city center . It takes about 20 minutes to drive there . 
 I usually meet some friends and we play sports together or I might spend some time alone on my hobbies . I spend winter evening watching tv , but I spend summer evening at cultural events if I have time . 
 I'm not at all keen on that sort of job.It makes me crazy . 
 You have to type all day . 
 I like to live here and enjoy my neighbors ' company . And I don't think I should waste money just because I have much of it . 
 Oh , the car is old but still in good condition . I just think we should be thrifty , whether you are rich or not . 
 But what ? Just remember that thrift is not only a great virtue , but also a great revenue . 
 Judy , have you ever made out how much money shall we spend ? 
 What ? That's too much . 
 Ah , the transportation fee always takes a great part in the budget . 
 Hmm , what I'm fearful of is that the accommodation will also deteriorate once we choose a cheaper hotel . 
 Julia , what do you think of the network ? 
 Yeah , you are right . Internet makes our lives easier . But it's a two-blade sword . 
 I mean Internet brings benefit a lot , but also some disadvantages . For example , many youngsters are addicted to the games and they neglect their study ; or some bad guys steal people's money online , etc . 
 Yeah , you are right . But we have to know how to make good use of it . 
 Well , you've been working on this assignment for five hours . 
 Where are you going ? 
 What's wrong with her . 
 Congratulations to you . 
 Hi , I ’ m Susan.What ’ s your name , please ? 
 Where do you come from ? 
 Yeah , that ’ s right.SO what are you studying ? 
 That sounds interesting . 
 Just fine , Karen . I ’ m just taking a breather from all this paper work ! 
 I ’ ll have to try it . You know how I am about Italian food ! What ’ s the name ? 
 I can ’ t think of where to go . 
 I really don ’ t know . 
 I really like where I ’ m at now . 
 That may be what I ’ m going to do . 
 You ’ re absolutely right . 
 I ’ m just going to stay at PCC . 
 The bigger they are , the harder they fall . 
 Oh , you didn ’ t know that apartments here are considered valuable , even if they are small and crowded ? 
 I don ’ t mind paying high rent to live in New York . 
 Yeah , but so what ! I ’ m proud to live in the world ’ s most exciting city . And , the salaries here are the highest in the nation , too . 
 The one in the red shirt ? 
 She's alright . 
 Why don't you go talk to her ? 
 Hell no ! You're just a chicken that's all . 
 Why don't you go stand next to her for a while and if an opportunity comes up , strike a conversation . 
 It doesn't matter . You gotta find what she's interested in and go with that . 
 Do you want me to go talk to her ? 
 If you don't do anything , I'll bet somebody else will . 
 How about a movie tonight ? 
 Does 7 o'clock suit you ? 
 How about a snack after work ? 
 Would you rather stay home ? 
 Are you really interested in doing something ? 
 Have you ever played Making ? 
 Yes , some friends play it all day , all night , and sometimes a whole weekend . I tried to read about some basic rules online , but it is hard to understand . So I went to watch people play yesterday only to find I was even more confused . I think I have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . Practice makes the master . 
 It is important to keep your mind up-to-date and active . 
 Why do you say that ? 
 Many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . Government service can be a rewarding and secure career . 
 Well , many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries . 
 Sometimes that ’ s true , but not usually . Most feds are honest , hard-working professionals . It ’ s hard to keep highly trained people , so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive . 
 I ’ m a GS - 15 . That ’ s high on the scale of workers , but even a GS - 1 is paid a living wage . 
 Why don't we spend this vacation earning our tuition ? 
 OK . 
 Yes , it is . 
 Yes , he is . 
 It ’ s OK . It seems we have a lot in common . 
 He is tall and slim , fair-haired . 
 He is a nice guy and very considerate . I am impressed with how smart and humorous . 
 So click here , then up to the top . 
 Then open that window.Yeah , that one . 
 And that's it . You're done . 
 Sam , we are hard up for the everyday expenses . When can you find a job . 
 You liar , I saw you again in the inn . I bet you don't want to work at all . 
 What do you do ? 
 I really should be on my way . 
 No , thanks all the same . 
 Thank you very much . We really had a good time . 
 So see you . 
 I hear your daughter graduated from high school as the valedictorian . 
 Where is she going to college ? 
 Really ? That's the icing on the cake . Congratulation again ! 
 Hey Jackie . What are you doing ? 
 I was thinking about heading to the mall . Do you want to go ? 
 Yeah . Both Bon and Nordstrom's is having there annual sale . It's a great time to buy some clothes you've been holding out on . 
 I'll meet you in front of Nordstrom's in 30 minutes . 
 What do you think about these shoes ? 
 No . Not really . 
 I bet it's expensive . 
 For 80 bucks it looks great . Go try it on . 
 Would you like to live in the country ? I ’ m not sure I ’ d like it . 
 What do you mean ? 
 I see what you mean . I love being far away from a city , but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities . 
 I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . They ’ re so much better to look at than concrete , rows of parked cars and tall buildings . 
 The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . There ’ s so sign of pollution . The village looks so peaceful . 
 You ’ re right . I would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . I would hate living in the country ! 
 Fine , just don't do it at night . 
 The cold weather will damage the engine . 
 Yes ? 
 how's it going ? 
 to be honest , I'm a bit fed up . 
 well , my boyfriend was supposed to call me last night , but he never did . 
 the thing is , this isn't the first time he's promised to do something and then didn't . 
 a bit ? I'm extremely annoyed that he didn't phone me when he promised me that he would ! He's such a liar . 
 I don't know . I've got mixed feelings about it . On the one hand , I really want to end it with him , but on the other hand , I don't want to be without him . 
 in the long run , I think breaking up with him would make me much happier , but I know that I'll be depressed about it for a few weeks first . 
 what would you do if you were me ? 
 Our philosophy teacher is very humorous . 
 No , not at all.The examples he gives are very interesting . 
 Bonjour ! 
 I said , Bonjour ! 
 I ’ m speaking French . Don ’ t you know anything ? 
 Well , I just got back from my language school . We have to speak French all day there . No English allowed ! 
 I ’ m trying to learn new skills . It makes me more qualified for a good job . 
 What have you been up to , Johnny ? 
 Wow , your grandma's really having a field day with you , huh ? 
 You have all the fun , don't you ? 
 Sure thing , Johnny . Watch out for dishpan hands there , kid ! 
 No , I don't think she's that strong-minded . 
 She will be back soon.You can wait and see . 
 A quarter past five . 
 See you . 
 You're welcome , Bob . It was nice meeting you . 
 My eyes water continuously . Why ? 
 What is there in the air ? 
 I can't believe that the air in this city is so dirty . 
 So do I . 
 Maybe you are right . 
 Maybe it was Dick . 
 Then it must be a naughty boy who did it . 
 What about going to the zoo on Saturday and to the park on Sunday ? 
 Then , what shall we do on Sunday . 
 Good idea . I'll go shopping in one of the department stores nearby . We'll go to the zoo and the park another time . After all , we can put that off . 
 I haven ’ t met Bob for years . How is he ? 
 He would have recovered from the stress and got married again . 
 Daniel , have you ever heard about the wildlife sanctuary ? 
 Yes , of course . 
 There are a lot of wild animals in that place , and also some special rules while visiting . 
 There , you only have two ways for visiting . 
 On their bus or in your own cars , and you won't be allowed to get off the bus until you reach the special region . 
 Because it is dangerous to get out of the car or bus . You can just imagine how fierce the wild animals can be . 
 Yes . 
 Yeah , sure , you won't be disappointed . 
 English is my favorite . 
 Thank you . 
 Not yet . I guess we should send Jim along to talk to the chief since he is such an apple polisher . I am sure he can help . 
 What are you doing there with your mobile phone ? 
 Moblogging ? what does that mean ? 
 Sounds interesting ! That must be very convenient . 
 How can you do that ? 
 What if you want to publish some photos ? 
 I see . Moblogging must have done a great favor for habitual bloggers like you . 
 Wow . Look how polite your son has become . 
 I don't think much of the film . 
 Really ? Do you like the story ? It's sheer nonsense ! 
 Excuse me , can you suggest a good book for me to read ? 
 Do you have an English-Chinese dictionary ? 
 So , Karen , what do you do in your free time ? 
 Really ? How long have you been playing piano ? 
 That ’ s really interesting . you have to play for me some time . 
 Well , I collect beer mats . I ’ m not sure that counts , though . 
 I can't help it . 
 It was fantastic ! We had such a good time . The only problem was that because it was their high season , we spent hours queuing . 
 Yes , Florida had great weather while we were there . You look tan , too . Did you go somewhere ? 
 Wow ! Bali Islands have some of the best beaches in the world , don't they ? 
 Did you go diving while you were there ? 
 Did you take any pictures in the ocean ? 
 Have you started planning your christmas vacation yet ? 
 No , but I do like snowboarding . 
 I'll talk to my husband about it ; I'm sure he'll say yes ! He loves Switzerland ! 
 I guess I'd better go now . 
 In that case , I'll be seeing you . 
 I ’ Ve just take out an insurance policy . Are you insured ? 
 I took out a life insurance policy and make my wife beneficiary . 
 I need to make sure that my wife will be financially secure if I die . 
 That ’ s one of the conditions of my policy too . It covers you if you die before you retire and when you retire . 
 Yes , I did . It was one of the conditions of the insurance policy . The insurance company need to assess the risk . 
 I've got a headache . 
 No , thank you . I'll take an aspirin and see how it goes . 
 Well , if I were you , I'd go on studying . 
 If I had chance again , I'd major in English . You're good at language . 
 You should take their advice . They know what's best for you . 
 But if you go to university , you'll still have time for fun . 
 And if you try to find a part-time job , you'll have some money too . 
 Let's program your courses , since you have had English literature , you should take American literature and American prose and fiction . You transcript indicate that your english background is strong , so I don't think you have any problem with it . 
 Three , you also should take two three-credit-course in education department . 
 You mean it shuts off to save energy ? 
 It's not breathing ! 
 Jen , it's not alive ... but it does look user-friendly . 
 The art critic from the daily chronicle doesn ’ t think much of the max oreo exhibition . He says that the artwork is uninspiring and old fashioned . 
 I liked it . I didn ’ t think his works were masterpieces , but the certainly weren ’ t uninspiring , in my opinion . 
 I like landscapes and still life . You prefer abstract paintings , don ’ t you ? 
 I agree . I prefer oils too . I collect landscapes , but I only have a small collection . You have a small collection of abstract art , don ’ t you ? 
 That would be nice . Can you read the characters ? 
 I think that ’ s true with any of the fine arts . 
 I like taking photos . 
 Yes , look at the photos I took . 
 Thank you for saying so . 
 It's quite cold this early morning , isn't it ? 
 Time sure flies , doesn't it ? 
 It was a kind of sixth sense . 
 No . 
 He'll never do well in mathematics . 
 Well , I can't help . 
 Stay away from me . 
 I'm serious , Zina . Back off . I have a bottle of pepper spray in my pocket . 
 Why are you being so nice to me ? Don't think for a second that I trust you . 
 Do you ? By the way , could you mail this letter for me as you go through the lobby ? 
 Thank you . Come back to my office at the same time tomorrow . I'll have the pictures ready by then . 
 Are you a smoker ? 
 Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ? 
 When did you begin to smoke ? 
 Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking ? 
 Hey man ! How ’ s it hanging ? 
 Did you go to the roller rink on Saturday ? I heard it was far out , man ! 
 Right on , right on ! Well , Jim went to the rink with Sherry and he said it was dy-no-mite ! He was low on bread , but Sherry paid for everything . 
 Yeah man , I ’ m starving ! 
 Yeah , this is my first visit here . 
 Thanks , but I speak English with a strong German accent . 
 On and off , for quite a few years . 
 Does it really look OK ? 
 And I got it on sale . 
 I want to take Shield on a date but I don't have much money . 
 She likes to golf , dance , and eat foreign food . 
 Well , I really like being with her . 
 Dutch , where's that ? 
 Oh . I wonder if she'll go for that . 
 Her name is Laura , isn't it ? 
 How old is she ? 
 What does she look like ? 
 Pretty , is she ? 
 Are you free tomorrow , Sam ? 
 I'm going to go hiking . Do you want to join me ? 
 Why ? 
 Yes , do you always gather to welcome new comers ? 
 Really ? 
 You are studying here , aren ’ t you ? 
 Do you like this campus ? 
 How come ? 
 Oh.It ’ s awful , but it can ’ t be helped . 
 Why don't you go out with Jack ? 
 Wow ! What happened to you ? You look sad . 
 That's unbelievable . Why did this happen ? 
 I cant't believe it . You've worked here for years . 
 Well , Jim . It is a combination of how much you eat , the type of food you eat , and when you eat your meals . 
 That's a big mistake , you should always have a good breakfast . You will not run your car without fuel , and yet you won't expect your body to work without food . 
 I bet you eat a large evening meal , then sit and watch TV or read a book . Then instead of burning off your energy , your body stores it as fat . 
 Well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits . 
 I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution . 
 That's because your country is more agricultural and has much less industry . 
 We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution laws have been introduced . 
 I think you're right . An international response to this problem is needed . 
 Of course.Don ' t worry . I'll call one for you . 
 Yes , besides it versa according to the distance . 
 No problem . 
 You are welcome , bye . 
 Mine . It's My Heart Will Go On , the theme song of Titanic . Isn't it of strong character ? 
 No , not yet . 
 You needn't ask anyone . You can get on line to search for one . 
 Yeah . Web sites provide many melodies for handsets like my ERICSSON . 
 Numerous . It's time that everybody is particular about personality.Find one and change yours . 
 Why ? What are they like ? 
 Have you ever talked to them about it ? 
 What did they say ? 
 They soud like the neighbours from hell ! 
 I thought you didn't talk to them much . 
 What do the other people in your apartment think about them ? 
 Maybe you should think about moving . 
 Well , perhaps you should have a party and try to get to know them better . Maybe once you get to know them , they'll turn out to be more sensitive . 
 Well , I don't know what else you could do then . Do you think bribing them with chocolate would work ? 
 Yes , the autumn is marvelous here . 
 I hope so . 
 A house warming party ? 
 Congratulations ! That ’ s wonderful . I bet both of you are quite happy . 
 I understand . That ’ s why Christopher and I want to find a place in a small town , far from the city . 
 I agree . That ’ s why Christopher is already looking for a job in Maine , or Wisconsin . 
 Ok , on that day , boys usually give roses to the sweet hearts and girls give them chocolate in return . 
 Yeah , that is what the holiday is for , isn't it ? 
 Not well . I ’ Ve been feeling pretty lonely lately . 
 You know what they say'a friend to all is a friend to none ' . I don ’ t feel like I really know any of my friends . In fact , I should probably call them acquaintances , not friends . 
 I know you are , you are my girlfriend . I wish I had a guy friend to hang out with sometimes . 
 Not at all . 
 That ’ s a good idea . 
 I ’ m not sure . I guess I ’ d like to meet some people who have a positive attitude and want to have a good time . 
 That ’ s a possibility . Thanks ! 
 You can't judge a book by its cover . 
 Shift it a little before you get up . 
 Hey Susan , what are you coming as this year ? 
 Yeah ... for Halloween ! We have a big office party tomorrow evening . There's a prize for best costume ! 
 Really ! You don't have some kind of Chinese ghost festival ? 
 Cool ! A whole month ! What do you do during that month ? 
 Feed them ? 
 And then later everyone eats the food ? 
 It makes sense , right ? Who else is going to eat it ? 
 But no dressing up like ghosts , right ? 
 Hey Annie , who is this picture of ? 
 I think you can say your seventh great grandfather ! Cutie ! What's his name ? 
 Nice pun . What is it you active about him most ? 
 He looks like a very personable man . 
 Does Tom drink a lot ? 
 That's a problem . He has sort of Dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything . 
 Are you serious ? Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain ! It disgusts me . 
 Well , to begin with , Gambling is addictive , ruins marriages , destroys families and bankrupts communities . Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop . People have lost their houses , cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted . Secondly , it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk . Women gamble to escape , and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction . Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies . 
 You cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling . Now excuse me , I have a protest rally to organize ! 
 Mr . : Yes ? 
 Mr . : Would you like to go to the nurse's ? 
 Mr . : Here's a hall pass for it . Do you need someone to walk you there ? 
 Mr . : I'll drop by later to check on you . 
 Sure 
 Am I late for the party ? Looks everyone is already here . Hope I didn ’ t miss something interesting . 
 Great , here are some flowers for you . I hope you like them . I was not sure if the color will suit your new apartment . 
 Don ’ t bother . I will help myself . 
 It is such a nice place . 
 Have you got any plans for the coming holiday ? 
 Volunteer in a zoo ? What specific things will you do ? 
 It must be a unique experience . I ’ m looking forward to share your story when you come back . 
 He is planning again . 
 That is him . 
 Thank you very much , David . It's an excellent birthday gift . 
 I'm so relieved . I just passed the bar exam . 
 That's an understatement . I'm on cloud nine . I couldn't be any happier . 
 Not yet . I didn't get a hold of them . I'll try to call them again tonight . 
 I think so . It's turning out to be a great day . 
 Do you have a car or motorbike ? 
 In that case , you can park either in a student lot or on the street . Are you aware of the marked handicapped spots ? 
 The handicapped logo with blue means that you are not to park there unless you have a handicapped permit . Will you mostly be parking during the day or the night ? 
 Make sure you pay special attention to the street signs with time limits . Have you noticed those signs ? 
 Pay attention to what the signs tell you in terms of time limits and what days you can park there . Do you know what the curb colors mean ? 
 Just remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means loading and unloading only . I think you'll be good to go ! 
 It bears a great many of advantages , but also some weak points . 
 For instance , the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study . 
 Actually , it's not the fault of the mobile phone . But people should have a proper attitude towards it . Mobile phone is a tool serving people , not the fetters restricting them . 
 Yeah . I'll miss all of you , too . But I'll keep in touch . 
 That's very kind of you to say so . Let's try some after-dinner wines . 
 Do you prefer brandy or ports . 
 Excellent choice . I love its smooth flavor . 
 Yes . You always have a good nose for wines . 
 Oh , what's that ? 
 Why not ? It sounds great . 
 Thanks . Cheers . 
 You seem to be unhappy . What happened ? 
 What does the doctor say ? 
 Good evening , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 How would you like your Bourbon , straight or on the rock ? 
 Here you are , sir . Bourbon with iced water . 
 The bourbon is 15 dollars plus 10 % service charge . So the total is 16.5 dollars . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 His girlfriend broke up with him . 
 I've just got the examination results . I am afraid you haven't passed . 
 I am afraid so . I am terribly sorry ! 
 Don't worry about that , I am sure they will understand . After all , it was a very difficult exam . 
 You can always take it again . 
 How high did the price go ? 
 You didn't watch the end of the auction ? 
 more and more Chinese are marrying foreigners . 
 oh , why ? 
 I wouldn't say that's totally true . I've met many happy intercultural couples . 
 I guess it's because the Chinese women are more attractive to Western men . 
 what do you mean ? 
 a left girl ? What's that ? 
 you have a point here , but I believe some mixed marriages are based on true love . 
 Our maths teacher is rather humorous . 
 No , not at all . His examples are really interesting . 
 Yeah , how about your maths teacher ? 
 Bad luck , Anne . 
 She's another antique . 
 I enjoy watching Channel 5.They always have films from all over the world . 
 I can read the subtitles.My set is a huge-screen one . 
 Happy birthday , Ann . Many happy returns of the day ! Here is a present for you . 
 Ok , who is that girl ? 
 Well , I don't know . 
 Who is afraid ? I am not afraid . 
 All right.That ’ s very nice of you . 
 I ’ m sorry I can ’ t make it.Thank you anyhow . 
 Certainly . Let me see.Oh , it's on that shelf . 
 Of course.Here you are . 
 Let's skip The X-files tonight , Fran . Okay ? Just this once ? 
 How did you know ! There's a program on ancient Egypt tonight . 
 Look , it's starting ! 
 Do you feel like going to see Paul and Claire tonight ? 
 How does 7:30 sound ? 
 David , have you watched the 82nd Oscar Awards Ceremony ? Avatar got the Award of Visual Effect . The movie sounds great ! 
 How was it ? 
 It is said that The Hurt Locker got the Award of Best Picture . What do you think about this ? 
 Wow ! That's a fantastic movie ! 
 Who was the director ? 
 the May holiday is coming up soon . Are you planning on going on vacation ? 
 where are you planning on going ? 
 I went a long time ago , before they built the new train that can take you there . 
 personally , I think it ’ d be better to go when you have more time . A few days isn ’ t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital . 
 it ’ s a beautiful city , but I think it ’ s become too touristy . How about going to a cosmopolitan city like Shanghai or Hong Kong ? 
 maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of Beijing . I heard they are very relaxing . 
 since the May holiday is the high season , you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . Here ’ s the phone number . 
 What are you worrying about ? 
 Where is he ? Is he in danger ? 
 Guess who I saw yesterday ? 
 My cousin Monk . Have you seen her lately ? 
 Nothing exactly . She's grown into a very attractive young lady . 
 You know , her long lovely blond hair and beautiful blue eyes really make her stand out from others . 
 Yean . Around five feet five inches tall . 
 Oh , come on . Let's not beat a dead horse . 
 I like all sorts of movies , primarily drama and science fiction . 
 Western and horror are the two types of movies I don't care for . 
 Some are entertaining , but I find most of them stupid and childish . For example , I don't understand why a person always goes into the house alone when something is suspicious . 
 Well , you seem to enjoy speaking English . 
 I hope so . You see , at the moment I find it difficult to get used to the teacher's speed and accent . I'm awfully worried , I can't reply as quickly as she seems to expect . 
 You know , speaking in class is a very good chance to put your English to practical use . 
 You think ? 
 But I still get stuck on the different tones . It drives me crazy . 
 Tom , you're my good friend , right ? 
 The exam ! The terrible exam ! I'm not ready yet . Can you tell me how to get good marks ? 
 Yes , thank you . 
 No thanks . I've had enough . 
 To tell you the truth , I am on the diet . 
 Well , I am gaining weight these days , and I have to watch my calories . 
 You have taken words out of my mouth . He is a tough customer . 
 Look ! There are playing The Matrix today . 
 I don't know . If we can't , we can buy from ticket scalpers . 
 Come on . We are already here . Besides , I really wanna see this picture . 
 Seven thirty . There is only 10 minutes left and look at the long line ! 
 Yeah , let's do so . 
 What can you expect with this crowd ? I am praying that no one will cut in the line . 
 I hope not . We are getting closer .. two more ... one more ... it's our turn . 
 I'm sorry . 
 You are so thoughtful . 
 Oh , through a lot of hard work , of course . 
 Surely it was , especially when you only knew few people and little English . 
 Right . I only knew a few English sentences . 
 First , I worked as a servant . 
 I'd like to , but I must run to a meeting . 
 Sure , what's up ? 
 Good question . I have to think about it . 
 France ? Is he crazy ? 
 Well , how can I put this ? France is a terrible team . 
 I'm a newspaper columnist . I write comments for a living . I enjoy working in a coffeehouse . 
 I don't mind . By contrast , I quite like the circumstances , as I can see a variety of people here , who can always give me tremendous inspiration . And the most important thing is coffee as it is my life . 
 Irish coffee is my favorite . But I can drink any other . I'm not particular on it . 
 Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee . 
 Exactly . Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . People love it all over the world ? 
 Many people think Brazil makes the best coffee . Brazil exports a lot of coffee . But I love Irish coffee . So it's hard to say . Just depends on your taste . 
 Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee . 
 I suppose so . That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffeehouses in China now . 
 Well , there are certain factors that effect people's size and weight . 
 One study said that low-income groups have a higher percentage of over-weight people than higher income families . 
 The survey said that the low , income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis . 
 And junk food contains lots of fat and oil . There is one final reason why so many people are fat . 
 Nobody exercises any more-not even kids ! The average American home has the TV on for 6 hours a day ! 
 Yeah , I guess so . 
 Hey , I started a diet and lost 10 pounds . 
 Well , I quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds . 
 Merry Christmas , Lily . 
 This is your first Christmas in the US . Here is the gift for you . 
 Ok . People decorate their houses , place a Christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a Christmas carol together . 
 Don't worry about it . 
 I think you just need to get more sleep . 
 Jack and Mary broke up . 
 Mary said Jack was cheating on her . Jack was seeing a girl from his hometown . One day , Mary saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately . 
 no , he doesn ’ t . Anyway , she found out that he had been two-timing her for a long time . 
 how so ? 
 poor Mary ! She really liked him . 
 do you think they ’ ll get back together ? 
 I hope she ’ ll recover soon . 
 Look , my clothes are wet . 
 Unexpectedly , a girl threw a bucket of water on me . 
 The Dai people are enthusiastic . 
 Did you hear about Bob and Mary ? 
 They had an argument and split up . 
 Nick ! How ’ s it going ? 
 What are you doing in this neighbourhood ? Do you live around here ? 
 It was great to meet you last week at the conference . I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment . 
 Sure , you still have my contact details , right ? 
 Sure , my name is Ana Ferris . Don ’ t worry about it . it happens to me all the time . I ’ m terrible with names too . 
 Howdy folks , and welcome to today ’ s game ! You know , Rick , today is a key game between Russia and Canada . As you know , the winner will move on to the finals . 
 Maurice Richard has the puck now , and passes it to the center . He shoots ! Wow what a save by the goalie ! 
 What an amazing goal ! 
 I just found out that my husband is cheating on me . 
 That's what I thought . It seems that he's been seeing someone else for about two months . 
 I asked for leave and was at home when the telephone rang . I picked it up and a girl asked to talk to Mark . She then asked if I was his sister , and I said no , I was his wife . She hung up immediately . 
 Yeah , he first said it was someone from work . He gave me a lame excuse , and so I pressed him on it . 
 He kept trying to make stupid excuses , and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion . 
 Channel 24.It shows some cable networks and no commercial interruptions . 
 It was very good . I followed it right to the end . 
 Certainly.Go ahead . 
 I'm surfing the Net . 
 At the drop of a hat . 
 It ’ s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions . 
 Roger Vargas is up at bat . The pitcher winds up and strike one ! 
 The players are scrambling to get the ball . Vargas gets to first base and he ’ s still going ! The outfielder throws it to second ! Vargas slides ! He ’ s safe ! 
 We have a runner on third and up at bat is Brian Okapi ! There ’ s the pitch , he hits it ! It ’ s going , going , that ball is gone ! 
 So , this is the worst story I ’ Ve heard this month . You have my real sympathy , Tim . 
 I understand how you feel , but you ’ Ve gotta learn to move on . 
 I told you that she is no fool . 
 She cannot get in Dutch with him . He is her boss , you know . 
 Hey , Ann , I am really sorry about last night . I shouldn't have said those things to you . 
 don't be silly . You guys should spend as much time together as you can . Besides we can go to the beach anytime . 
 well that's what being friends is about , isn't it ? 
 Nah , I wouldn't worry about that . But I don't want to be the third wheel . You two should have some quiet time to yourselves . 
 maybe ... I'll think about it . 
 Tom , You're back , come in please.How are you ? 
 You'll recover after a good night's sleep . 
 That's all right.Would you have a cup of coffee ? 
 Don't mention it . 
 It's my pleasure . 
 Thank you.Thank you for the trouble you've taken . 
 Jack and Mary broke up . 
 Mary said Jack was cheating on her . Jack was seeing a girl from his hometown . One day , May saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately . 
 No , he doesn ’ t . Anyway , she found out that he had been two-timing her for a long time . 
 How so ? 
 Poor Mary ! She really liked him . 
 Do you think they ’ ll get back together ? 
 I hope she ’ ll recover soon . 
 I wish you wouldn't play the TV so loud . 
 Yes , please ask when you want to borrow my records next time . 
 So , Karen , what do you do in your free time ? 
 Really ? How long have you been playing piano ? 
 That ’ s really interesting , you have to play for me some time . 
 Well , I collect beer mats . I ’ m not sure that counts , though . 
 In summer I go hiking , and in winter I ski . 
 No , not at all . Glad to have you . 
 Not so good . I have a terrible cold . 
 Yeah , you're right . 
 No , I haven't . 
 Ugh ! 
 Ha , she is unstoppable . I'm learning so much from her . 
 She's demanding . But I like that . I mean , I know our timeline is tight . 
 You guys are working around the clock , I know . That guy Dave next to Zina never leaves . 
 I have a suggestion . Why don't we go to a ETV and sing ? 
 Yes , why not ? Don ’ t you like ETV ? 
 Never ? Really ? I'm surprised . 
 But there are a lot of Kts in this town . There's one just two blocks from here . 
 I'll see you in Sterlet , then . 
 Sterlet . It's spelt 0 , S , T , E , R , L , E , Y . 
 Listen to this . Mary got married . 
 Yes . Yesterday . 
 She married Jerrod . 
 She ’ s going to live in Paris . 
 I am trying to decide what school to apply to ? 
 I am not sure . What's the difference between them ? 
 Which is better ? 
 I hear you have to wear uniforms at private schools . 
 Let's program your courses , since you have had English literature , you should take American literature and American prose and fiction.You transcript indicate that your english background is strong , so I don't think you have any problem with it . 
 Three , you also should take two three-credit-course in education department . 
 I'm not comfortable about this , Sandy . I don't understand most of these games . 
 I don't want to lose all my money . 
 I guess you're right . 
 Yes , I remember.You must decide how much money you will gamble before you start to play . 
 I know it's true , Sandy . But still some people lose control.They start to gamble , and they can't stop . 
 Okay . 
 Maybe 500 dollars . 
 I don't want people to think I'm stingy . 
 I feel very miserable . I took the death of my wife very hard , you know . 
 I ’ Ve tried it , not a chance . 
 Mary , it was wrong of you to be so late . Mother ’ s very worried . 
 I don ’ t really like Henry . I like my Rose . 
 But my Rose is great . 
 Really , Mary , you ’ re horrible . 
 Mr . : Please open your books to page 10 . ( To Mary ) Can I help you ? 
 Mr . : That's alright . It's the first day of school , after all . 
 Mr . : I'm asking the class to read page 10 to themselves . Then I'm going to ask some questions about the passage . 
 Mr . : Here . Write your name inside the front cover . Remember that you must return the textbook to me at the end of the semester , so keep it in good condition . 
 Fine ! How are you ? 
 I've come to tell you I'm going to the concert this evening.Will you come with me ? I've two complimentary tickets . 
 It will be held at the Music Hall . 
 It's a piano recital . I'm fond of piano , you know . 
 Me , too . I've heard so much about you . 
 I was looking forward to your arrival . 
 Yes , I watched once . 
 Well , honestly speaking , I went to watch it out of curiosity . I ’ d say it ’ s really a special art form . 
 Really ? Good for you . 
 What class are you trying to take ? 
 Well , there are only two classes open . 
 One class is on Tuesday and Thursday from 2 p . m . to 4 . 
 That class is from ten to twelve on Monday and Wednesday . 
 Yes , I am sure . 
 Very well then . 
 What ’ s up ? 
 America ? Did you get admit to MIT ? 
 Congratulations ! Susan . I ’ m so happy for you . 
 Really going to miss you . 
 Ok . Take care . Have a nice journey . 
 Look after yourself . Bye . 
 Have you ever run into a person who tries to bleed you white ? 
 I hear that some guys splash all their money about on them . 
 I ’ m sure it will be wet when we arrive . 
 It will be Sunday so I expected everything will be closed . 
 But the bank should be closed so we shouldn't to be able to get some money . 
 Do you think we ’ ll need our overcoats ? 
 Why not ? 
 Is that very likely in England ? 
 My disposable contact lenses . They're great for camping ! 
 Yep . They're prescription contacts with UV protection . 
 You just pop'em in in the morning , take them out at night , and then throw them away . No cleaning ! 
 Near sighted . 
 not much . Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight . 
 well , I didn't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found his extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! We have so much in common . We like the same teams , music , a 
 there's nothing definite I think . I don't have a list or anything , but when I first meet somebody , I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . It seems I have radar h 
 I agree . You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need . 
 Are you studying here ? 
 What are you major in ? 
 What do you think of the literature course . 
 Look at the cloud . 
 Let's go quickly . 
 no , we're not . We've been drifting apart for a while . 
 we did , but since she started her new job , all she does is hang out with her new friends from work . 
 I could , but all they ever talk about is work , so I always end up feeling left out . 
 I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her ! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her . 
 you're right . She would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge . But she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore . 
 I've given her enough time . I'm over it now . 
 I think I just have to accept the fact that it's time for us to go our separate ways . 
 Of course , I like flowers . 
 I like peach blossom , because I like spring . 
 Yes . How about you ? 
 You have a perfect taste ! 
 Yes . It's snowing outside . Let's enjoy the plum blossoms . 
 Where are you from ? 
 There's a double feature at the cinema this Saturday . Do you want to go with me ? 
 There's an action movie with Harrison Ford and a chick flick with Susan Abandon . 
 So , is that a yes ? 
 It starts at one and yea , let's meet there . It's the cinema on the corner of Lincoln and Main . 
 Did you hear what's going on downtown today ? All the orders from the factory are staging a demonstration in the streets . Not one of the two thousand employees showed up for work today , and they have gathered outside the city hall to demand better working conditions for all factory employees . 
 I think they gained courage after the mayor's speech last week on equality and opportunity for all town citizens . Anyway , the sentiments have been brewing for quite some time . I mean , we all know the working conditions at the factory are quite horrendous . 
 They want raises and medical insurance , and I think they want to clean up the factory's safety hazards . That's probably the most important issue . 
 Oh , why not ? 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry to hear that . Hey , don ’ t worry about the dinner . We ’ ll do it some other time . But you take care of yourself . 
 Why do you want to spend your summer days in a mountain village ? 
 I don't agree with you . It's too small to live . 
 I disagree , a big town is more lively . 
 Well , alright , I agree with you about that , but I still prefer a big town . 
 We're sorry you have to leave . 
 Certainly . Come back soon . 
 to be honest , I wouldn't . 
 not really . But it has puzzled me for a long time . 
 my husband and I prefer to have no kids , but my mother-in-law is very traditional and wants grandkids . 
 yes . It seems she can never accept a childless marriage . We had a fight last night . 
 but it's absolutely our own business to have a child or not . 
 you know , I often overhear our neighbor , the young couple , fighting about how to raise their kid and I really don't want kids to spoil our happiness . 
 I guess you're right . But I still prefer to have no child . 
 I've had enough of that ! 
 I hate the hero.He ' s too cruel . 
 How much did you bid ? 
 We'll see how much fun it is after they take all your money ! ! 
 What if he had his friends fake the reviews ? 
 It's taking you forever to do my hair . 
 You should've been done already . 
 I don't think that you're done . 
 My hair looks hideous . 
 It doesn't look good at all . 
 I really hope that you didn't expect me to pay you for this . 
 Excuse me ! I don't have time to waste . I've been here almost one full hour ! 
 Unbelievable ! Parking in this city is such a nightmare ! 
 Oh , gosh ! I have to go to the restroom so bad ! I can't bear it anymore ! 
 Oh , look ! There's a spot open next to the public restroom ! Can I take it ? 
 I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour . 
 I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ? 
 Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ? 
 I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy . 
 We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm . 
 Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze . 
 Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible . 
 I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days . 
 Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days . 
 Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again . 
 let's go out for a walk . 
 Well , shall we go to the cinema ? 
 Mr . Bellow , have you anything in mind as to what to drink or may I make a few suggestions ? 
 Would you prefer our cocktail — Shanghai cocktail ? It's a mixture of real Chinese ingredients . 
 ( The waiter makes the cocktail for Mr . Bellow and hands into him . ) Here is your Shanghai cocktail , Mr . Bellow . 
 Jack I hear you have a chance to go to college without taking a test . Is that right ? 
 Don't hesitate . That's a very famous university which a lot of students are longing to attain . 
 But this chance is really precious . 
 I hope you can make a clever choice . Anyway , the opportunities around you are not that By . 
 Hi , Janice . Our first weekend after being employed is coming . Show me your plan . 
 What are you assigned to do ? 
 For me , I think I will iron my shirt and trousers . Actually , weekends tend to be the most hectic day in the whole week . 
 I couldn't agree more . 
 I am hurrying . 
 I can't figure out which dress to wear . 
 And you ’ re going to completely transform your eating habits , right ? 
 I ’ Ve heard this one before . 
 Well , I guess we ’ ll just have to wait and see . 
 Will you be joining Billy and I at the Bar ? 
 We are going to try the new one that opened up on 17th Street . 
 I want to stop off at my apartment to get changed so I should be there by 9 pm . 
 Certainly . But if there are going to be four of us , I had better make reservations . 
 Then I'II make reservations for 9 pm for a party of four . 
 Not that I know of . Why do you ask ? 
 I hear the drinks and food there are moderately priced.You should be fine . 
 No , its very casual there . Leave your jacket and tie at home . 
 I'll see you there at 9pm . 
 What's the most popular sport in your country ? 
 Do you play table tennis ? 
 I've really enjoyed your party , Lisa . 
 I wish I could stay longer , but I must be going . 
 It is very common in the winter in Ottawa . 
 Give me Scotch , please . 
 Black Rose . 
 Just plain water with plenty of ice rock . 
 Have you ever seen Bill Gate's home on the internet ? 
 It's got its own library , theatre , swimming pool , and a guest house . The house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through a remote control . It's also located near the sea , so he can park his boats next to his house . It's absolutely amazing ! 
 I think his house is fantastic , but I wouldn't want to live there . You would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house , plus a few people to take care of the gardens , and probably an au pair or two to take care of the children . It's just too big of a place to take care of on your own . 
 My dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quiet village in England . 
 Old homes are great because they've got character . I think that's important . 
 No , that's just because I don't have enough money to buy new cloths all the time ! 
 No , I'd definitely try to restore it to its original state . I love to imagine what it'd be like to live in another time in history and living in a house decorated like it would have been 200 years ago would be a great way to feed my imagination even more ! 
 Of course . I can't live without it , so I always bring my CD with me no matter where I go . 
 Light music and classic music . 
 But I didn't get the ticket . And it is said that they were sold out yesterday . 
 Amazing ! I can imagine the feeling when I hear the smooth tune around my ears . 
 I ’ m so sorry , and I will pay much attention to it later . 
 I spend most of my spare time reading . And I subscribe to various newspapers , magazines and periodicals . 
 I am interested in science fiction . 
 Thanks to you . I'm totally pumped up . 
 I surely am . But still there is one single problem . 
 I eat more and more these days . And it puts even more weight on me . 
 I'd love to do that . What do you recommend ? 
 Do you think it's a good option for health and relaxation ? 
 I can so that . 
 How did it go ? 
 Do you have to leave soon ? 
 Oh , that ’ s better . So you don ’ t have to rush . 
 What ? 
 He knows you very well . 
 I ’ m sure you have chances everywhere . You ’ re handsome , talkative , and got a sense of humor . You must be very popular . 
 This small town has many serious problems . 
 The mayor and high official practice crony is mand a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions . 
 Do you see the woman ? Is she a teacher ? 
 Does she teach Chinese ? 
 And who ’ s the man in the green beside her ? 
 which countries have you been to ? 
 I thought you had been to Australia too . 
 I think I'd say Norway . It has many pictures as fjords , waterfalls , and mountains . 
 well , the north of Norway is almost always cold , but further south it can be fairly warm in summer . It ’ s a wet country , so there ’ s snow almost everywhere in winter . 
 What's bothering that guy ? 
 Jane , I was wondering if you you had any plans for saturday afternoon . 
 There is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum , I was hoping you ' d like to come with me . 
 What about sunday ? 
 Maybe next week . 
 Sorry to hear that , I was really looking forward to spending some more time with you , I really enjoyed our last chat . 
 Hello , Mrs Turnbull . How are you ? 
 He's a bit tired . You know , he goes to school at eight o'clock every morning.He doesn't get home till after four . then he does his homework after tea . It often takes him a couple of hours to finish 
 School , you mean ? Yes , he does . He likes his teachers , and that always makes difference . 
 No , he walks . He likes walking . He meets some of his friends at the corner another go together . 
 My husband takes him in the car . He passes the school on the way to the office . 
 Yeah . 
 Oh , my mother is a German , so I can speak German . 
 Yeah , I'm eager to learn Chinese , but it is too difficult for me . 
 Very Good . I'd like to do that . 
 How about tomorrow night ? 
 Your muscles are a spectacle ! 
 No , but I am starting working out from now on . 
 You are an eager beaver . 
 I visited the famous variety show host , Dennis . 
 Oh , he's a very serious person . 
 Lily , do you know Lizzy ? 
 Lizzy smith . 
 Then , Do you know her younger sister ? 
 Yes . 
 Oh , not bad . Then do you know her mother ? 
 That sounds terrific . 
 I just want to visit the family some day . 
 Yes . But I'm not used to eating American-style breakfast . 
 I saw yesterday that they rent windsurfers at the beach . I want to rent one . 
 No , but it looks fun . I always wanted to try it . 
 Sure . What ? 
 But I always wanted to try it . 
 Well , I will see . How was your day at the office ? 
 Don ’ t worry . I don't think you ’ re going to lose your job over one mistake . 
 But it wasn ’ t just you who was involved , right ? You were only doing what your supervisor told you to do . 
 Let ’ s think realistically about what might happen . How much money do you have in your savings ? 
 Well , you can't have everything . Let's just figure out what you will do if you lose your job . When is your contract up on your apartment ? 
 Well , that ’ s good . If you lose your job , you can just move in with me until you find another job . That will save you plenty of money . 
 If you lose your job , you just have to go for a few months without buying all the junk you usually buy . If you live frugally , you ’ ll save plenty of money . 
 Excuse me , I need your assistance . 
 I have no idea where my class is . 
 My class is in the C building . 
 Do you mind telling me where it is ? 
 Number 261 . 
 Can you please show me ? 
 I'm more worried about snipers . 
 Sniping is when someone makes a bid at the very last minute to steal something for a bargain price . 
 I heard about a software program called turbid . It automatically submits a bid with just a few seconds to go in an auction . 
 So , Fred , what are your plans for after graduation ? 
 That ’ s cool . Have you already found an apartment to live in ? 
 I couldn ’ t even if I wanted to . My parents told me that if I went home , then ’ d have to find my own place . 
 Not really , they just don ’ t want me living at home . My older sister did that , and she lived at home for seven years . Once she started living at home , it got harder and harder for her to move out . 
 My parents just didn ’ t handle my older sister very well , and because of that , they want me to be more independent . They think that it ’ s important that I should learn how to live on my own . 
 Hi , Mel , would you like to come and have a cup of coffee this afternoon ? 
 I see . Then what about tomorrow , at Starbucks ? 
 Are you kidding me ? Becky ? She ’ s a real bitch . 
 Well , we have the Thompsons , the Greens , and the Anderson , about twelve people total . 
 But that makes thirteen people ! We can't have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! 
 It's an old superstition . If we have thirteen people at the table , then it means bad luck . Can Andy bring a date ? 
 But we can't have thirteen for dinner ! 
 Absolutely not ! I refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! 
 That's better . 
 I know what you mean . 
 Yes , he did the same to me . 
 Temple fair ? 
 Sounds interesting ! 
 I just can't wait to see them . Which one do you choose today ? 
 Great ! Do you know how to get there ? 
 Couldn't be better . 
 I hope nothing is wrong . 
 What's the matter ? 
 Oh , no . Is it serious ? 
 Of course . I'm sorry for your daughter . 
 Not at all . 
 Yes , I hope so . I would like to register for Comp Lit 287 . 
 I know . I already tried to register for it by phone , but the computer won't let me . 
 But I'm a new student here . I thought maybe there was some way I could get into the class . I thought I should come and talk to you in the department office . 
 My name is Karen Huang . That's spelled H - U - A - N - G . 
 I'm a comparative literature major . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 That's why I'm trying to get into Comp Lit 287 . I know it's a required class.And Professor Cohen told me I need to take it . 
 Even if the class is full ? 
 Oh , I didn't know that . 
 Thank you . So you think I will be able to get in with this ? 
 Thanks . 
 Who's that man over there talking to James ? 
 He's very handsome , isn't he ? What's he like ? 
 Really ? I love eccentric people . 
 Why ? What do you mean by that ? 
 Heard what ? No one ever tells me anything . 
 Really ! How fascinating . 
 Well , what can I say ? I didn't know . Oh , I meant to tell you earlier , your blouse doesn't really match your skirt . Those colors don't really suit you either . 
 How did you first meet Jack each other ? 
 And then ? 
 Then he sent you to your home ? 
 It's a romantic meeting . I can say that a hero saves a beauty . 
 He is so humorous . 
 I'm from Germany . 
 Yeah , but I can speak English , too . 
 A little French . 
 What are you reading ? 
 Aha , Fitness Consultant . Very good , Don't you know about the rules in this office ? 
 Well , don't do this again next time . What is it about , anyway ? 
 What kind of sports ? 
 Interesting . What were you reading just now ? 
 Really ? That sounds interesting ! 
 No . It's confiscated for now . And I will return it to you after I finish reading it . 
 Did you watch NBA games before you came to the U . S . ? 
 What a pity ! 
 Yes , of course . 
 Kobe . 
 Let's go to watch an NBA game tonight , shall we ? 
 Hi , could you help me find a place where I could buy some lunch ? 
 I was thinking of pizza or something else Italian , maybe . 
 Good ! Where is it ? 
 That would be great . 
 I'm reading an interesting report on Mars . 
 Absolutely ! It says there is water on Mars buried beneath the surface . It's just a matter of how deep it is . 
 The soil would need quite a bit of fertilizer to grow anything . And it would need to be protected from the UV radiation . 
 I'm not sure NASA has built any portable habitats for extended stays on Mars , but they have looked at various designs . 
 Well , I'm not really an expert in this area , but my understanding is that anything is possible . It's just that it is so hard to determine what went on 4.5 billion years ago . 
 I'm skeptical . Mars is made of rocks containing silicon , iron , and various minerals . It also has an atmosphere of carbon dioxide . It is so different from what we have on earth , you know . 
 But there are still other big problems we need to solve such as prolonged weightlessness , food storage , and a series of physiological effects . 
 Not a bad idea . 
 Well , let ’ s see . I ’ d like to go to see the Summer Palace . 
 When are we leaving for our field trip ? 
 Yes , I will write that down . 
 Yes , I will be there on time . 
 Yes , someone is coming to get me . 
 What should we bring with us ? 
 Mr . : Hello , Mary . 
 Mr . : I'm Mr . Taylor , and I'm your counselor . I'm going to show you around the school . 
 Mr . : Right here is the cafeteria . 
 Mr . : But not big enough . And here is our computer room . 
 Mr . : And over here is our gymnasium . 
 Mr . : Just like everyone else . 
 Tell me about it ! It's like the whole world is broiling . 
 I hope it's not gonna break into three digits 
 Well , I just hope it'll level off . 
 I guess so . What else can we do ? You can ’ t stay in the heat for long . 
 Well , I've been practising for 5 weeks . 
 No , once I did 32 . 
 I was away for my vacation . 
 Good . I wish I could have another vacation . 
 sure . Have you got anywhere in mind ? 
 that Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . Do you want to go there ? 
 if you want spicy food , then I'd recommend going to a Thai , Indian or Chinese restaurant . How about that Chinese buffet on Cowley Road ? 
 you're right . Most of their dishes have sweet sauces . We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us . 
 the Taj it is then . 
 they'll still charge us a corkage fee . 
 don't worry about money . I'll treat you tonight . 
 no , I'll pay . It's my turn anyway . You paid last time . 
 Robin , what are you going to do tomorrow ? 
 And later ? 
 It seems that you will have a nice day tomorrow . 
 I have a lot of work in the office and a lot of chores in the house.How I envy you , Robin ! 
 I ’ d stay over there , if I were in your shoes . 
 See your problem ? You get so restless when it ’ s time to calm down . 
 You married Joe , didn't you ? 
 I remember you are in love . 
 It's Greek to me . 
 Whew ! Thanks , Karen . That car almost hit me . 
 Those poor Egyptians slaves worked so hard and you want to give aliens all the credit ! 
 OK , but don't believe everything you see on The X-files , either ! 
 Hi . are you new here ? 
 I'm Steven , your neighbour . 
 Nice to meet you , too . 
 I guess so . I live next door but one , and hope you'll drop in now and then . 
 The winter in Ottawa is freezing . 
 I think I will be adapted to it . 
 Yes , that's the reason why I remain here . 
 This really has been a wonderful holiday for us . Shall we take a walk around the pond or into those woods for a while ? 
 No , not really . I had thought we'd stay in Hamburg tonight , but we can't unless we rush it . Let's stay in Bremen instead . Tomorrow we can have lunch in Hamburg , then check into a hostel in Copenhagen and have dinner there . 
 Sure . We can walk around to that path that leads into the woods there . Hey , look ! There are some wild ducks over there in the reeds . 
 I used to go hunting with my uncle , that's how . 
 Wow . She can be really nasty , can't she ? 
 Well , I guess Zina figured you couldn't blow it if you were in the hotel room . 
 Well , at least we have Stars.com . That'll be great publicity . 
 Hello , Mary , where do you work ? 
 Is the pay good ? 
 Hey Matt . I'm going to ask Martha to marry me ? 
 I always knew she was the one , but I decided to pop the big question about 2 weeks ago . I'm just debating on how to do it . 
 So how did you propose ? 
 What do you think I should do ? 
 I never thought about that . 
 Asking her father in front of her . How do you think she will react ? 
 I think that's the idea I was looking for . Thanks , man . 
 The bridegroom looks a bit nervous . 
 Oh , they are playing the wedding March . Here they come . 
 I am so happy for them . 
 Yes , I always cry at weddings . 
 Yes , they are . 
 In fact , we are beginning to make preparations . 
 No , no , for the engagement . 
 What's this , I wonder ? 
 A coffee grinder ? 
 Oh , that would be very useful . 
 Yeah . How's everything going ? 
 Just alive ? I guess you are some lucky guy . I heard you are going out with Jane . 
 Oh , come on . Jane is a very nice girl , someone you meet only once till lifetime . 
 Well , I really envy you for finding such a nice girl . 
 No , that's not right . I didn't order a coffee . I ordered a cola . 
 Waiter ! 
 It's not that . There's an animal in my soup . 
 I've never been to such a dirty restaurant , and never seen such slow service . 
 Dalian is a beautiful city . Do you agree ? 
 The climate here is pleasant . 
 This city is really comfortable to living . 
 No other city can match it . It's heaven . 
 Maybe . 
 Me too . I ’ ll see you after work , huh ? 
 Sure . Meet me at five . 
 Oh , I'm hoping to take courses in my vacation . 
 you are dressed to kill . You look gorgeous , Alexander . 
 how did you meet each other ? 
 is this your first date ? 
 sure it will . Oh , no , it's seven fifteen already . I'm going to be late for my date . 
 absolutely not ! He's a cheater . I will never talk to him again . I'm over with him . He's history ! 
 a guy I met on the internet three month ago . 
 please don't be so fussy ! I didn't just meet him yesterday . 
 I can ’ t believe that Anthony is finally getting married ! 
 Don ’ t be mean . Look here come the bridesmaids ! Their dresses look beautiful ! 
 That ’ s the flower girl and the ring bearer . I ’ m pretty sure they ’ re the groom ’ s niece and nephew . Oh , they look so cute ! 
 That ’ s all you ever think about , food ! Oh , I think the bride ’ s coming now ! She looks gorgeous . Wait , what ’ s she doing ? Where ’ s she going ? 
 I've just got the examination results . I am afraid you haven't passed . 
 I am afraid so . I am terribly sorry ! 
 Don't worry about that , I am sure they will understand . After all , it was a very difficult exam . 
 You can always take it again . 
 The tall one ? Sure , that's Drive , he works with Lily . 
 I'm not sure , he is a manager I think . 
 Well , he has already taken you know , that's his wife right there . 
 Hello , my name is Paula . Nice to meet you ! 
 It seldom rains this summer . 
 Because of pollution and other things , our environment has become worse and worse . 
 It is serious . 
 Rich struck it rich in advertising . And he and Cath got married and just had a child . 
 Teresa Jones got a boob job . 
 I've got something . You saw Taylor Smith ? Looks terrible , doesn't he ? I heard he ... 
 Oh I ’ m learning very slowly . I think Chinese is more difficult than English . 
 Maybe , but I think people usually learn English more quickly than Chinese . 
 Maybe that ’ s why your English is much better than my Chinese . 
 Thank you . You're very kind . 
 Sure , honey , we ’ re talking now , aren ’ t we ? 
 Yeah . I know . 
 You know , I think you ’ re awesome . 
 Honey ... 
 Baby , I love you so much . 
 I love you . And I think you ’ re awesome . 
 Come on . Put the gun down . 
 How do you do ? I ’ m Parker . 
 Parker . 
 Yes , with a P . 
 Barker ? With a B . Of course . 
 Won ’ t you come in , Mr . Barker ? 
 Let ’ s go to WAngFuJing by bus . 
 Okay . It will be a new experience for me . 
 where do we pay the fare ? 
 Let me pay for it . 
 Ask the worker who sells token to give you one . It ’ s free of charge . Actually maps showing subway routes are posted at most stations . 
 No , you don ’ t have to . Here comes the train . 
 Is it horror movie ? 
 No way . I will be scared out of my wits . 
 Er , let me see . Romance , comedy , documentary , action , science fiction , cartoon and so on . 
 Yeah , It seems like we don't talk the same language as far as movies are concerned . 
 The Terminal is a movie of this type . 
 Yeah , I could hardly wait to see it . 
 Uh , yes . 
 Yes . I commute five days a week by train . 
 It ’ s really very good . 
 Well , trains are frequent and come on time . 
 I usually take the 5 thirty home . 
 No , I usually have to stand . 
 Yes , it ’ s reasonably fast but it certainly isn ’ t cheap . Fares have gone up25 % . 
 Hi , Don . What a surprise ! 
 Have you noticed what has changed ? 
 Yes . I ’ m on a diet , but I ’ Ve not taken anything . I just eat less and exercise more . And it really worked in the past three months . I ’ Ve lost twelve pounds . 
 What kind of exercise do you think I do ? I just go to dance everyday after work . I ’ m taking an amateur dance class . I dance two hours everyday . 
 Sure . Join my class next week . 
 I'm doing business through Internet now . 
 Yes , very good . 
 It is very convenient . You know you can browse the website and send e-mails to your customers at any time . 
 Also it has low cost , and you know you only need to pay the fee of Internet , which is very cheap . 
 To be frank , sometimes it is not so safe as doing business through traditional ways . 
 Yes , but if you choose some good B2B websites , such problems can be avoided . 
 Of course , such as the Alabama , which is a famous website . 
 Alright everyone settle down . Let ’ s get started.As you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . It is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . This brings me to our topic for today . Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ? 
 No , that ’ s May fifth in Spanish , James , no wonder you are failing my Spanish class . No , May first is International Workers ’ Day . 
 No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is . 
 In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement . Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect . 
 Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality . 
 Well , as we say , the rest is history ... 
 Yeah . She's a healthy beautiful girl . 
 She is tired , but getting a lot of rest now . 
 I'm just glad there were no complications . 
 It's been a week , and I haven't slept that well . 
 Yeah , but it's so hard . I have to work , and then go home and take care of my wife and the baby . I'm going to get sick at this rate . 
 That's true . I should make sure my wife and baby stay healthy during this time . 
 Um ... well , actually , we had a fantastic time last night . He was ... amazing ! 
 He ’ s really good looking . he ’ s quite tall , around 61 , he ’ s in his early thirties , and he ’ s got the most beautiful dark brown eyes ... 
 You know what , this is the best part . David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank , so he ’ s got a great career path ahead of him ! 
 Yeah ? 
 Hi , Lucy . What are you going to do this weekend ? 
 Would you like to play tennis with me ? 
 Be sure to get to the sports hall at nine o'clock on Sunday morning . 
 I heard that Jim lost 100 yuan . Do you know that ? 
 Really ? 
 But some classmates said you took the money . 
 Look at my eyes . 
 Return the money to Jim and make an apology . I think he will forgive you . 
 Howdy ! Nice car ! What seems to be the problem ? 
 Not sure yet.How about you pop the hood and we can take a look . Mmmm , it doesn ’ t look good . 
 Well missy , the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . You should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died . 
 I ’ m afraid a bit more than that . We need to order the spare parts , take apart your electrical system , fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . You are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks . 
 I like this kind of weather . 
 And it's calm . I like the peace . 
 A friend of mine is now in the big house . He was caught red-handed for selling cocaine . 
 He must be regretting about having done the business . 
 Do you like climbing ? 
 How about climbing up the Fragrant Mountain tomorrow ? 
 It is located at the east foot of Western Mountain of Beijing , in a park with the same name . There are some huge stones within the mountain which look like the censer , so it is called ' Fragrant Mountain ' . 
 Many times . Except climbing , there are many attractions worth visiting . 
 It is the best season to view red leaves from the Mid-October to the first ten days of November . During the period , thousands of hectares of maples on the sloping field are so red that you would recognize them as fallen petals by mistake if looking from a further area . The bright red , pink , scarlet , and peach-puff leaves are distributed in different layout , with some green pines and cypresses dotted in between . 
 You can take a bird-eye view at the glorious picture when you arrive at the top of the mountain . 
 What had make you so upset ? 
 What ’ s wrong with that ? 
 To be frank , I find philosophy rather boring . 
 How could you manage to pass the exam ? 
 That one looks pretty big . Are you going to keep it ? 
 Not me . I like to throw back what I catch . 
 Lester , you are really fantastic at automobile repair . 
 That ’ s not a big problem . There are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified . 
 And you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school , or from the government . 
 Hey , Ted . What are you up to this Friday ? 
 That ’ s great ! Do you have any plans ? 
 Sounds nice . 
 Can I stop by ? 
 Judy , what is everybody talking about ? 
 You ’ re kidding . It can ’ t be true . 
 Really ? I ’ m surprised . 
 How do you like waltz ? 
 May I invite you for the first dance ? 
 In fact , I took up dancing quite recently , too . 
 I'm glad you say so , you dance beautifully too . It's lucky that I got a partner . 
 Yes . And what dances do you like best ? 
 Oh , the music has stopped . Thank you for the dance . 
 Fine . 
 I need to return a book . 
 I want to check this magazine out . 
 Why not ? 
 So what am I allowed to check out ? 
 I need to check out this magazine . 
 That doesn ’ t make any sense . 
 That's nice of you . 
 Wonderful . 
 Really ? I didn't realize it was so late . 
 Where are you going this weekend ? 
 So boring ! Shall we go out for a picnic with my friends ? 
 Fred and David , my college class mates and Rachel . 
 Your tent and enough food and water . 
 We can go fishing , chatting and camping . 
 Don't hurry . Wait for my call . 
 I'm really into watching foreign films . what about you ? 
 camping for an evening is ok , but I couldn't do it for much longer than one night ! 
 no , but I've always wanted to do that . I've heard it's a beautiful place to go . 
 do you have any photos of any of your camping trips there ? 
 that'd be great . What kind of camera do you have ? 
 so , you must be pretty interested in photography then . 
 actually , I do . I took quite a few photography classes at University . 
 yes , I was planning on going . Are you ? 
 that'd be great . what time should I meet you there ? 
 sounds great . see you then . 
 Well , I go to the gym a lot . I am a member of a gym nearby . 
 About three times a week if I can . 
 Not really . I ’ d really like to try golf , though . 
 Wow , that's great ! 
 The day before yesterday . I only visited Montreal and Ottawa , but I had a great time . 
 That's hard to say ... I think Ottawa is prettier.It has better sightseeing , too . A lot of museums and galleries . 
 Montreal is more exciting . It has better shopping.The stores are cheaper and more interesting . 
 Oh , Montreal of sure . It has more restaurants and clubs.They say Montreal is the most exciting city in Canada . 
 Well , you seem to enjoy speaking English . 
 I hope so.You see , at the moment I find it difficult to get used to the teacher's speed and accent . I'm awfully worried , I can't reply as quickly as she seems to expect . 
 You know , speaking in class is a very good chance to put your English to practical use . 
 I accidentally knocked it off the table and it broke . I'm really sorry . 
 Are you going out , Jack ? 
 Which language do you speak ? 
 Yes , I do . I ’ m learning Chinese now on the internet . 
 It ’ s not easy , particularly with listening and speaking , because sometimes the connection isn ’ t too good . 
 Actually , many of the characters are the same or very similar in both Chinese and Japanese , so they ’ re easy for me . 
 Yes . How are the Spanish classes going ? 
 What happened to John ? 
 Professor , I will not be here for our next class meeting . 
 I tried to work something out , but I really do have to miss one class . 
 I'm going to be doing a lot of extra reading . 
 Yes , I remember . 
 Sure , no problem . 
 Ms.Green , are the schools more or less similar everywhere throughout the United States , or do they differ in various sections ? 
 Do most students in the United States attend private schools or public schools ? 
 Which students go to private schools , then ? 
 But are the public schools good everywhere ? 
 Dose it cost anything to attend the public schools ? Are there any restrictions as to who may and may not attend ? 
 We thought you might like to participate in our rehearsal . 
 That ’ s a pity . We can arrange another time hopefully . 
 What ? 
 Oh , how awful . What a terrible thing to do . 
 Well , maybe they've got a point . I mean , I suspect that they think the same about us . 
 I guess not . My view is that we should give in to their demands , so that innocent people can stop getting killed . 
 Well , that's probably true , but I don't think we should be dogmatic about it . A colleague of mine was kidnapped once , so perhaps I have a different view of things . 
 Well , it was in the Balkans during the war . He was only held for three days , and then they simply released him . It was a case of mistaken identity , and they just let him go when they found out he was no use to them . It was lucky they didn't kill him . 
 How have you been ? 
 And how ’ s everyone in your family ? 
 I ’ d love to but I ’ m afraid I can ’ t . I ’ Ve already got a lunch engagement . 
 Oh , this ? I got it in Singapore . Here , do you want to take a look ? 
 Yes , it is , isn't it ? A bit too light , really . What make have you got ? 
 Wow , that's really old . 
 Why don't you get a new one ? 
 Really , what makes you say that ? 
 Sometimes , but I guess not very often . It's more for fun . Sometimes when I'm on a trip , for example , I can take a picture and send it to my kids . Or I can send a picture of a sample back to my office and get it costed up immediately . 
 Three . Two boys and a girl . 
 Oh , that ’ s alright . 
 No . Please don ’ t . I couldn ’ t let you do that . 
 He borrowed it from Nick . 
 He was too desperate to find some other way . 
 Yes , are you ? 
 You do know that it's absolutely freezing out , don't you ? I'd put a coat on if I were you . 
 Well , it's started raining since then . Look out the window ! It's pouring rain out there ! 
 It does , actually . Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping . 
 Ok . I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . It's a bit chilly in here . 
 I don't know . The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night . 
 I don't think we have anything to worry about . Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ? 
 If I'm not back in ten minutes , come and find me . 
 Is everything ready for the Christmas party ? 
 I like the big star on the top of the tree . I ’ ll put the presents under the tree later , how ’ s the food . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve bought all the things to go in it . It won ’ t take long to make . How many people are coming to the party ? 
 Do we have Christmas pudding ? 
 Yes , I did . I send most of them a week ago . I ’ Ve brought some with me to the party to give to people in person . 
 I hope you didn ’ t forget mine ! 
 That must be a long love story . 
 They have made it . Will our love last 50 years ? 
 Do you think you could keep the noise down ? 
 Yes . And another thing , would you mind not making long distance calls ? 
 Hey , Brad . How was your day ? 
 I'm going home . 
 Is that right ? 
 So he takes attendance once in the morning and once in the afternoon . 
 Mary and I decided to ring the curtain down on our love affair . 
 Don ’ t make a fuss . Many people divorce after having living together for many years . 
 Did you enjoy the movie ? 
 Sorry to hear that . I think it's even better than On the Golden pond . 
 I have some photos here taken by myself . Would you like to see them ? 
 I would get Fuji 200 film for taking photos of natural beauty . 
 How about you , Chuck ? Where did you grow up ? 
 And when did you come to Los Angeles ? 
 Oh . What was your major ? 
 That's interesting . So why did you become a hairdresser ? 
 How are your wedding plans going ? 
 Are you going to get married in the church ? 
 Have you booked the hotel for the reception ? 
 No problem . 
 I can't agree with you . She's pretty , but she always blows hot and cold . 
 She's my sister , you know . 
 Nothing . Maybe it is just the weather . Rainy days often make me feel a little sad . 
 Sure . But it is too cold today . I have to put on warm clothes and look stupid . 
 Philip , I was really glad to hear about your award . Congratulations ! 
 Sure . But the work you did was really exceptional ! You definitely deserved it ! 
 Hi ! I see you are having fun with your new computer and internet connection . 
 I can give you the name of a few useful website to visit . 
 When you sent your emails , did you attach any files to them ? 
 When you use the internet , be careful not to give out your email address very often . If you do , you might get a lot of spam-unwanted email from companies trying to sell you things . 
 That ’ s right . Another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . Your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time you want to visit . 
 Take this web page for example . Press the keys “ control ” and “ d ” together . Click on “ favourites ” at the top of the screen . There you are . It has been added to you favourites list . If you click it , you will automatically go to that web page again . 
 If you fall in love like him , you will go soft in the head , as well . 
 You want a bet ? 
 Is there any more vodka in that bottle ? 
 Marvelous . Pass it over . My name's George , by the way . 
 So Irene , what do you do ? 
 Macrohard , eh ? 
 I have my own company that designs computer systems . 
 It seems to be . How about you today ? 
 OK , I'll find the time to relax soon . 
 How are you feeling , champ ? Ready to go ? 
 In what ? 
 Can you do the vault ? 
 I've come to say good-bye . 
 I'm flying home on Sunday afternoon . 
 Please don't forget to say good-bye to the rest of the family for me . 
 You said it . We ’ er breathing poisonous air every day . 
 I absolutely agree with you . 
 I can't come until next week . 
 Thanks , I'll see you around Wednesday then . 
 Oh , that's George . He looks very drunk . 
 Oh , he's really reserved , normally . But , from what I hear , he's got lots of problems . 
 Well , off the record , of course , but I hear that he's got terrible debts . He has his own company , and it's not going very well . 
 Really ? What makes you say that ? 
 I know , that's the problem . He can't find any customers . It's a pity , really , because his products are very good . Oh , that reminds me . Did I tell you about my new laptop ? 
 Oh , really ? 
 Yes , I'll have another cocktail . 
 Absolutely . 
 OK . I'll wait here for you . 
 When ? I saw him well last month . 
 How terrible ! 
 That black sheep . It serves him right . 
 It ’ s too late . 
 Yes , it is . Kelly ? 
 Do you have a cold ? 
 Oh , no ! What about your presentation today ? 
 I understand . What should I tell Mr . Morley ? 
 Alright . Have you been to see a doctor ? 
 Do you think you'll be able to come in tomorrow ? Or should I call off your appointments for tomorrow too ? 
 It's rainy weather today . Maybe it's better if you just stay inside.Make yourself some chicken soup and sleep . 
 That bad , huh ? 
 Well , I'll cancel your appointments for today . And I'll tell Mr . Morley . 
 Hope you feel better . 
 I am on my way out to a New Year ’ s banquet . How do I look ? Is my make-up OK ? 
 Do you think I should wear a different dress ? 
 Thanks for saying . Do you have any ideas which necklace I should wear ? 
 Thanks for helping out . Now that I ’ m ready , what are you doing tonight ? 
 Sounds fun . Anyone I know ? 
 Sounds Like I'm missing out on a good time . Oh , well , there is always next year . 
 Is it true that rice is the staple food in most of Southeast Asia ? 
 Is rice your staple food , too ? 
 What do you like to do with your free time ? 
 You mean you like to study English ? Why ? 
 Studying English wouldn't give me any satisfaction . It's hard work . 
 Hi Bob , how ’ s business ? 
 Okay , enough small talk . Let ’ s get down to business . 
 Since we ’ re good friends , you don't have to pay me . 
 What a coincidence seeing you here . ! 
 We used to be very friendly , but it seems now that my daughter ’ s marriage has taken its toll of our relationship . 
 I don ’ t like her husband , that bad egg , but my daughter insists on marrying him . 
 I wish she wouldn ’ t regret for her decision . 
 Hey , Julie . How's it going ? 
 Who were you talking to ? 
 You look so happy . I see a twinkle in your eyes . 
 Oh , you have a crush on someone , don't you ? Maybe those are wedding bells in your eyes ! 
 Well , that's easy . Walk up to him and kiss him . 
 Are you ready for the big competition today , Todd ? The winner gets two tickets to the Sydney Olympics ! 
 We ’ Ve still got a lot of time before we have to start running . 
 You bet . I used to take a whirlpool almost every night back home . 
 Well , it doesn't seem like it.He must have forgotten . 
 I've come to apologize for what I said yesterday . 
 I must make an apology for losing my temper . 
 I ’ m relieved to hear that . Anyway , it ’ s my fault . 
 Yeah . 
 Yes . I bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted . 
 Partly , and he's also a hardworking man . 
 Well , let's see.Why don't we go dancing for a change ? We haven't done that for a long time . 
 Hmm.Well , in that case , we could go to the movies . 
 Well , do you have any suggestions ? 
 It's OK with me , but we don't have any beer and things . 
 OK . 
 Hello , Tom . I'm really glad to meet you here . 
 I'm so surprised , B . Why did you decide to end your marriage suddenly ? 
 I didn't know that . I thought that you were happy together . 
 I can't believe it . But if you both determine to divorce , I hope you will have an amicable split . 
 Hello , Tom . I'm really glad to meet you here . 
 I'm so surprised , B . Why did you decide to end your marriage suddenly ? 
 I didn't know that . I thought that you were happy together . 
 I can't believe it . But if you both determine to divorce , I hope you will have an amicable split . 
 Dad , I want to learn how to drive this summer vacation . 
 I will get registered now at once . Do you know any training schools ? 
 OK . look , I've typed driver schools , and there are so many results coming out . 
 3,000 Yuan is a little bit steep . 
 I've heard that the Ideal Life School is famous . They offer many programs and there are many classes available . The charge is also fair . 
 Ah , got it . Ideal Life School , programs 
 Did you have any hobbies ? 
 What kind of books do you like to read most ? 
 Are you in love ? 
 People say only those that are in love like to read romance stories . 
 I want take shell on a date , but I don ’ t have much money . 
 She likes to golf , dance and eat foreign food . 
 Well , I really like being with her . 
 Dutch , where is that ? 
 Oh , I wonder if she ’ ll go for that . 
 Hi Jack , I'm working on these documents . The manager wants them for half an hour . 
 Is there something you need ? 
 Yes , I have nothing to do . 
 I beg your pardon ? 
 Really ? well , ok , you're welcome . 
 Hmm , how about seven ? I can treat you to dinner . 
 OK.Then I'll be expecting you . 
 you're rather energetic today . What's going on ? 
 free coffee is one of the perks at this place , isn't it ? 
 not that well . I've got that Monday morning feeling today . 
 my boss has been breathing down my neck all day . I can't wait for the weekend ! 
 you can say that again ! He won't even let us check our personal email at work ! 
 really ? I didn't know that it was against company policy . 
 no , he is . Some bosses will bend the rules a bit sometimes , but not my boss . He always follows the rules to a T . 
 thanks . I better get back to my work before my boss yells at me again ! 
 alright . See you later ! 
 The bank closes in 30 minutes and I need to cash a check . 
 Thanks . But it's necessary for me to buy a TV set . 
 You can take me to the bank if you want to . 
 He came to work late every day that week . Then on Friday , he didn't show up at all . 
 Bob , you're so lucky that you've come at the right time-the 2005 International Tourism Festival is around the corner . 
 My pleasure . Well , the festival is going to start on the third Saturday of October , and covers over one hundred diverse programs in one month . 
 I don't know what to suggest . There're so many attractions , and they all sound interesting . One exciting program might be the Ten Thousand People Cycling round the Town . You can choose from the five routes that lead to different destinations . 
 Then you can take Route No . 5 . Next I would suggest the International Dragon Boat Race where you can watch Lion Dance , Dragon Boat racing , and many other water shows . 
 How do you know ? I thought Taiwanese people didn't have garage sales . 
 Well , I've grown to like second-hand things . I wouldn't have gotten through university without them ! 
 I use those sites . Hey ! Let's go check out a flea market later . 
 What do you think of AC milan and the team of Argentine ? 
 Yes , I think AC Milan's foot work is much better on the whole . 
 Did you move into your new apartment ? 
 Don ’ t worry . It ’ ll probably take you about three weeks to get everything organized . 
 Have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ? 
 What do you mean by that ? 
 Yes , but you only pay 800 dollars a month . Emm , it ’ s hard to decide which is better , shorter commuting time or lower rent . 
 Is there a supermarket nearby ? 
 Sounds like you better buy a bicycle . 
 I want to buy a parking permit , please . 
 I attend both day and evening classes . 
 I ride a motorcycle . 
 I'll use a credit card , thank you . 
 No , just the motorcycle permit . 
 What is that you have there ? 
 Ah ha ! I caught you . Just let me peek . I won't tell anyone . 
 How about one little hint ? 
 That's a very good hint . 
 Here's 30 yuan for my ticket . 
 No , you can't do that . 
 How are you doing with your English Language studies ? 
 Is it harder than you thought ? 
 I am told that you dance like an animal . Why don ’ t you give a show in the front stage ? 
 Did you enjoy that new movie ? 
 Oh , what happened , Carole ? 
 What ? I met him just before I took off from Kitty's , he said he was coming . 
 Looks like it . So how did he handle it to ? 
 I think that's a bunch of nonsense . It seemed ok to me . 
 Doesn't sound promising . 
 If you want I'll let him know if I run into him . 
 Have you run into your cousin Jimmy lately ? 
 How's he doing ? 
 He did ? That's too bad ! 
 Next time you see him , please tell him I'm thinking of him . 
 Oh , my god ! 
 That's the cutest little doll I've ever seen in my life ! 
 What park ? You found a doll in a park ? Gross ! 
 Well , don't blame me ! I never get a chance to watch TV . 
 Okay . Take your time . 
 What are you reading ? 
 Didn't he sell worthless stocks to people or something ? He got arrested for that , didn't he ? 
 If I remember , he got off with a light sentence . Something like three years in a minimum-security prison . 
 I think the government fined him a small amount , and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . He's still a millionaire . 
 I know . And some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes $ 500 at most and ends up in jail for five to ten years . 
 So what's Michael Milliken up to these days ? 
 He was once a poor man but now he is a man of means . 
 He didn't make any effort . His aunt died and left him a fortune . 
 Yeah , I quit . 
 I'm fed up with his boring lectures . 
 Of course we have . It's on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month . 
 It is said that the Cowherd and the Spinster , the lover stars in heaven , can only meet on the seventh Eve , so this day has become the Lover's Day . 
 Maybe you can't be so sure . 
 But some people use this occasion to create trouble . Have you heard of the Black Friday Virus on the computer ? It is designed to break out on every Friday the Thirteenth . 
 I am not sure what to do during the holidays , any suggestions ? 
 The problem is that I find all of them are full of fun . I just don ’ t know what to do first . 
 Actually , I ’ m interested in all of them . The more choices we have , the harder to make a decision . 
 Hello , Jack ! Fancy meeting you here ! 
 Fine . How is Jim ? 
 Good idea ! 
 Yes , of course . This is a really wonderful party with interesting people and great food . 
 Thank you for the invitation . 
 Yes , I ’ d love another glass . You ’ re a wonderful host . Thank you for everything . 
 I was wondering if I could borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend . 
 It is in the park downtown . 
 We will need it for Saturday only . 
 Mary and I will be driving the van . 
 Yes , we can do that . Can we borrow the chairs from the lunchroom also ? 
 Good morning , Kevin . 
 Very well , thank you . 
 It ’ s my pleasure . I enjoyed working with you . 
 Then keep up the good work . 
 I don ’ t know . 
 Oh , I see . 
 It ’ s Saturday , a great weekend . 
 Don ’ t be angry with me . I have a bad memory . 
 What day is it on earth ? 
 What can I do for you ? 
 Have you found a particular item from the card catalogue ? 
 Oh , maybe you can find something from the New York Times , or the Washington Post during that period . 
 You are welcome . 
 Yeah . They take the advantage of other people's hospitality and generosity . 
 You are still wet behind the ears . You should have seen through her . 
 Hi , Celia ! How was your trip to the United States ? 
 Great . How long were you away ? 
 That's a long time ! Was the weather OK ? 
 So , what was the best thing about your trip ? 
 I am really impressed with your presentation skills . 
 Well , your time has been well spent ! 
 Thanks , but I have to admit I am really good at bluffing ! 
 it was fantastic , but I'm glad to be back ! Being a tourist is really tiring ! 
 because it's off-season , we got a really good package deal to Paris , so we went there . 
 that was the first thing we did . I have a few pictures . Do you want to see them ? 
 oh , that's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city . 
 no , by that time , I was sick of sightseeing . I had had enough of art galleries , cathedrals , fountains , statues , and palaces ! 
 we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . We had a few coffees , watched a movie , and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel . 
 of course ! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery ! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though . 
 What does she do ? 
 Does she go to night school ? 
 Why ? What does she want to be ? 
 What classes does she take ? 
 I'm afraid I've spilt ink all over the table-cloth . 
 I'm terribly sorry . Won't you let me pay for it ? 
 Hi , Mike . We're having a party tonight , wanna come join us ? You can bring your girlfriend . 
 What happened ? Did you have a fight ? 
 Yeah , she is . She is pretty , caring , getting easy-going and she is a great cook . She is a gem . 
 Oh ? ! Did you talk with her about it ? 
 So , when are you going to tell her ? 
 I know she ’ s head over heels in love with you . She will be badly hurt ! 
 You saved my life yesterday , Rachel . I can't believe I forgot to bring my wallet when we went to lunch with those clients . 
 Let me buy you lunch today to pay you back . 
 Mary told me that she had seen you with John last night . I got to know the fact that you are playing the field . 
 How delicious ! Tender and crisp ! 
 Yes , it's really savory . 
 I am tired of everything in my life . 
 You don ’ t know that I have been over-protected by my mother these years . I am really about to leave the family and spread my wings . 
 What's all the security check about , Jimmy ? Does it mean the bar may be a dangerous place ? 
 I don't know . Maybe the same . Actually , this is my first time being in a bar . 
 Sure . I love this place , especially the decoration . So tasteful ! 
 Here it is . But , what for ? We're already in . 
 Yes , orange juice will be fine for me . But how can you get the drink ? It's so crowded there around the counter . You can barely move . 
 Cool . Thanks . ( Jimmy brings May a glass of orange juice . ) 
 Not everyone . But a lot of people do , especially the young . It's a fine place to spend an evening with friends or to make some new friends . 
 Yeah , a dancing queen . Wanna go and join them ? 
 OK . Let me help you to hold the drink . 
 Hey , Mary , nice to see you again . I heard you're going back home to the U . S .. 
 You're so thoughtful . Wish you a good trip home . And we'll miss you . 
 You know that ? Dan got a divorce . 
 Yeah . But his relation with Sally come to a sticky end and was found by his wife . 
 Mr.Ben , What do you think of the book ? 
 Why ? 
 I agree with you . 
 Oh , yes please ! I'd love a gin and tonic . 
 Oh , just olives please . What music is this ? 
 It's great ! Where did you get the CD ? 
 Yes . I buy a lot of stuff from there . It's a good shop , isn't it ? 
 Why not ? I'd love to ! 
 Just for a few weeks . I need this vacation . You ’ ll be all right . You know the project we ’ re working on , and you ’ re a good scientist . Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll be back as soon as I spend or gamble all my money . 
 Las Vegas . I find gambling relaxing . I don ’ t take it seriously , the way some people do . Besides , I love the shows and the all-night atmosphere of the town . The casinos never close , you know . 
 What ’ s the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ? 
 How hard is the climb ? 
 What did you do last week ? 
 Wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun . I ’ m sorry I missed it . 
 Yeah , I will . See you then ! 
 Lucy , what are your priorities when buying a car ? 
 What about the environmental factors ? 
 Sure they are . Some hi-tech devices are built in to make sure they pollute less . Some of these green cars have not become standard . So the production costs are still high . But anyway , we should make efforts to start with . 
 I know what you mean , it leaves a lot to be desired . 
 Have you found anything yet ? 
 You should be able to find something comfortable in town , though that would be kind of far from school . 
 But the parking might be . 
 Richard , why didn't you come to school today ? 
 Well , take care of yourself . 
 Don't mention it . 
 Yeah . You said it . 
 I ’ Ve done that . The doctor advised me to cut out smoking and drinking . 
 I like studying English , and I can read well , but speaking can be difficult . 
 Can I ask you a question ? 
 I have my book from class here . How do you say this word ? 
 Sorry , I don't understand . What does that mean ? 
 Yes , I think so . Can you say it again ? 
 Laptop . Did I pronounce that correctly ? 
 Thanks . And this word ? How do you pronounce this ? 
 Thanks so much . You're a good teacher . 
 I can see you've got some color back in your cheeks . 
 You've formed a sound habit . 
 I ’ m not a Christian . I just want to know why Americans believe that sort of thing . 
 You know ... like , say God is the creator of the universe , the Bible , and Jesus Christ ... 
 What do you believe , John ? Are you Christian ? 
 Do you believe that one religion is better than another ? 
 Do you go to church regularly ? 
 I ’ Ve decided to go to the cinema alone this evening . 
 Helen is nice but she talks a lot . 
 It sure is . 
 Howdy folks , and welcome to today ’ s game ! You know , Rick , today is a key game between Russia and Canada . As you know , the winner will move on to the finals . 
 Maurice Richard has the puck now , and passes it to the center . He shoots ! Wow what a save by the goalie ! 
 What an amazing goal ! 
 Nanometer is a length scale . It's one billionth of a meter , roughly ten times the size of an individual atom . 
 Well , let's make it this way . For comparison , 10 NM is 1000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair . There are as many nanometers in an inch as there are inches in 400 miles . 
 What are you doing for Christmas this year ? 
 That's great . M OST of my family is coming home too . 
 My sister.She is going to her in-law's house this year . 
 I asked Santa to bring me a new sweater and some computer games . 
 I hope that I get what I asked for . 
 We wake up early and go to church.Then we come back home and open our gifts together . How about you ? 
 Matthew ? Hi ! 
 it's got to be almost a year now . 
 I'm pretty good . I've been looking for a place to live recently . My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it . 
 not yet . I am still looking through the classifieds . Wish me luck . 
 Mrs . Thou ? 
 great . It's a lovely neighborhood . And it would be nice to be neighbors again . It would be just like the old days ! 
 Hey , How's it going ? 
 Oh , that's too bad . Was it stolen ? 
 Is there anything I can do ? 
 Sure , how much do you need ? 
 That's no problem . 
 That'll be fine . Here you are . 
 I'm going to buy some books and then I'm going to the gas station . 
 OK . I'll wait for you . 
 Really ? Well , thanks for saying so . 
 Sure . Why not ? 
 OK . 
 I don ’ t know whether I am a Barbie Doll or you are one . 
 Well , I am not going to flog a dead horse . Let get down to our brass tasks and tidy these things up . 
 Um ... well , actually , we had a fantastic time last night . He was ... amazing ! 
 He ’ s really good looking , he ’ s quite tall , around 6 ’ 1 ” , he ’ s in his early thirties , and he ’ s got the most beautiful dark brown eyes ... 
 You know what , this is the best part . David is a junior investment banker at Fortune Bank , so he ’ s got a great career path ahead of him ! 
 Yeah ? 
 Hi , Steven ! What do you like to do during the weekend ? 
 That ’ s great ! I think they do you a lot of good . 
 But why do you choose cycling at first ? 
 You are really a good citizen . 
 Matthew , do you know much about body language in countries around the world ? 
 Well , I had a meeting today with a woman from Japan and she wouldn't stop bowing ! I didn't know what to do ! 
 No , I tried to shake her hand , but her hand was so limp I was a bit offended . 
 But she was in America ! Shouldn't she have known that strong handshakes in America signify confidence and respect ? 
 Is that why she wouldn ’ t look at me in the meeting ? 
 The meeting really didn ’ t go down well at all . I think I need to read up about intercultural communication before I have another meeting with someone from another country . 
 That's so true . It's great that we see eye to eye on this . 
 Oh , no ! Not again . 
 I had no idea how seriously that country takes soccer ! 
 Okay . In the middle of their streets there are parks , big soccer fields as far as you can see . 
 That's not all . They use them ! Every night men , women , children all out there till 3 and 4 a . m . 
 I don't know how they function the next day ! It's like they eat and breathe soccer ! 
 I took more than 10 subjects including Theoretical Economics , Political Economics , Western Economics , Statistics and so on . In addition to the courses of my major , I took minor courses too . 
 I took computer science and English courses as my minor subjects . 
 Well , I'm not sure . Maybe it means we can buy something through the Internet . 
 It must be very convenient and pretty quick . 
 Michael Johnson doesn ’ t look graceful , but he sure is powerful . 
 What are you talking about ? ! He ’ s passed every drug test he ’ s taken ! 
 Just because Ben Johnson was juiced up doesn ’ t mean all athletes are . 
 Hi Wei , what are you going to do this weekend ? 
 Oh right ... How about Sunday ? 
 Oh really ? I ’ ll come along with you if that ’ s ok . 
 Oh great , I ’ ll see you there ! 
 Yes , it will take about four hours . We can leave about noon and get there by supper time . 
 All right . There will be three of us going so we will each pay a third . 
 There won't be many other expenses expect food . 
 It's Ellie and her friends . 
 She's my little niece.It ' s her birthday.They ' re singing " Happy Birthday " . 
 She's ten . 
 Oh , yes.Ellie was playing games all day yesterday.By the way , Alice , when's your birthday ? 
 Today ? 
 Well , imagine that ! How old are you ? 
 Very much.What time ? 
 I'll be at your house at about five thirty.Happy birthday . 
 Yes , that's right , around five nine five ten . 
 I'm not sure . Medium I suppose . Maybe a little on the heavy side . 
 No , I don't think so . 
 No . 
 Black or dark brown . 
 Straight , I think , and about average length 
 I'm feeling wonderful . 
 I'm no exception , and that's why I spent a whole afternoon in the swimming pool . 
 I'm going to the store downtown this afternoon to try on my wedding dresses . 
 Will you come with me and help me choose ? 
 Good . I think I'll get too nervous to look at myself in the mirror ! 
 Tom , did you see the film last night ? 
 Do you really think so ? I don't think so . It wasn't that bad film at all . Didn't you hear the applause of the audience ? 
 Well , i don't see the point of arguing this . 
 Of course . I stay online for four hours at least every day . 
 Millions of things . I surf the Net , check my e-mail , and most importantly , I chat with my friends . 
 No , I am not . And I love to meet new people in the chat rooms who share a lot in common with me . 
 Let's take a coffee break , shall we ? 
 What keeps you so busy ? You've been sitting there for hours . You've got to walk around.You just can't stay on the computer forever . 
 I understand that , but you'd feel better if you took a break , even for just a short while . 
 There are hundreds and hundreds . English is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions . 
 I'll look up the rate . To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof . It means to search for and find some information . 
 That is just a natural , grammatical English expression . It has a direct translation in other languages . 
 Have you ever thought of going to Africa ? 
 Would you like to go with me ? 
 Are you a wrestler or a boxer ? 
 Your muscular shoulders and chest impress me so . 
 Merry Christmas ! 
 Are you doing anything special ? 
 Oh . I'm just going to take it easy . 
 Stolen ? No , why ? 
 Criminals are clever ? They're only successful when people are careless . 
 If your uncle had an alarm system , then it wouldn't have happened . 
 Didn't anyone stop them ? 
 Wow , they were good . I guess criminals aren't that dumb after all . 
 He has a long head , I bet he will do well in his business . 
 When we were students , he was no good in any subject . 
 Charles , have you finished your homework ? 
 I want you to have a walk with me . 
 Look ! There's even a built-in handle to carry it with . 
 Oh , yes , it does . Look , here it says that the CD-ROM is built-in ! 
 It says that it comes in teal and tangerine . 
 And it says that it sleeps . 
 You do ? 
 But I find Japanese ones better . 
 Not good . The doctor told him not to smoke again , but it just rolls off him like water off the duck ’ s back ! 
 I hope it will be of some use . 
 Didn ’ t I tell you ? It ’ s over ! 
 It was a few things . The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary , but she stood me up ! 
 No , but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her with another man at a club near my home ! 
 I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that night , but she didn't answer the phone . 
 I know . I still haven ’ t heard from her . The good thing is that I ’ m so angry with her that I don ’ t feel sad about not having her around . 
 I guess so . It would be nice to know why she did this though . 
 Eric , how long will you be in China ? 
 Well , have you ever thought about learning some Chinese ? 
 Don't worry . All things are difficult before they are easy . 
 Well , are you invested in some language-exchange program ? 
 It's where I teach you Chinese , and in exchange you teach me English . 
 How about this sunday ? 
 Good . I'll give you a call tonight . 
 Bye . 
 What is it ? What happened ? 
 No , it can't be . Really ? Who ? 
 What did you do ? 
 Did he leave when you left ? 
 What did you do ? 
 That's about five blocks . And around corners too.So he was definitely following you . 
 Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . 
 Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything . 
 Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police.But for now , just try not to worry . 
 Hello , Mrs . Taylor . I'm here to pick up Diane . 
 Hi , Lucy ! 
 Yes , It's very great . 
 You are right , Mary's father is responsible for the entire wedding-arrangement , costs , etc . I think he must spend much money . 
 Yes.Look ! Mary is going to throw the bride bouquet . 
 What dressing would you like on the salad ? 
 I beg your pardon ? 
 Sorry , it's not available now . Anything else ? 
 Will you say it again ? 
 I ’ ll be away for a moment . 
 Look ! I ’ v been watching that man down in the street . He keeps peeping into the shop . Keep your eyes skinned for that guy , will you ? 
 Is there something wrong ? You look so sad . 
 No wonder you look so upset . Have you called the police ? 
 Hi , Doris . You look a little bit down . What's the matter ? 
 Really ! 
 How do you feel about that ? 
 Mm , so what are you going to miss about Japan ? 
 What especially about the night life are you going to miss ? 
 How are the clubs different in Japan than in London ? 
 Ahh ... What a fine day ! I do feel like an outdoor exercise . 
 OK . It's delightful to have a walk in the park with the air so fresh . 
 Don't you see many people over there ? Just on your left . 
 A growing keep-fit fever is sweeping over China . 
 I know . I have to prepare the supper for the whole family before I leave . 
 The housework is really a big problem for me . My husband is on a business trip to the U . S . now and I have to take care of everything myself . 
 I've asked my parents to live with us for a while , so they can look after her for me while I am at work or in the class . 
 Me too . Sometimes I do want to give it up . I can't deal with so many things at a time . 
 It's close coming up at the end of this month . That will be no more than 15 days from now on . 
 Why don't you take the CPA exam ? You are already a good accountant , having so many years of experience . 
 Steve , when are you going back to America ? 
 Wow , so soon ! I'm going to miss you . 
 My father failed in business . 
 Maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced . 
 No , not now . I have found a part-time job . So perhaps I can help my family to come over the difficulties . 
 Thank you . 
 To tell you the truth , it was completely accidental . 
 I don't think so . Michael . 
 Pleased to meet you , too , Shirley . So , what do you do ? 
 I live here . I was invited by George-he's the tall guy over there . He looks a bit drunk , actually ... 
 Yeah , the air is really fresh . 
 Because it rained last night . 
 It sure did . It was a heavy storm , with lots of thunder . 
 Well , it may rain again later today . 
 There may also be a strong wind coming in . 
 Maybe not . Dust is no longer a big problem in Beijing . 
 We've been planting trees for many years . 
 But the summer isn't . It's scorching in the summer . 
 Spring is warm and short in Beijing . 
 You got it . Oh , by the way , it may be really cool in the evening around this time of the year . Don't forget to put on more clothes , or you might catch a cold . 
 You're welcome . 
 Yes , it would be my first trip overseas . Actually , it's going to be my first time leaving the country . 
 No , I have never vacationed anywhere exotic . But even if I don't get a chance to travel on my personal time , at least I can travel on company time ! 
 Yes , it wasn't too hard to get . All I had to do was fill out the paperwork and pay the application fee . 
 My flight departs at 7 am . I have everything except for my luggage ready . 
 That would be great ! Thanks a lot ! 
 Sure ! You should do anything you can to improve your English . 
 Of course it is.In fact , I'll even take the course with you if you want . 
 Do you have the phone number ? I need to call for registration . 
 That's OK . I can get it from you later . 
 All right . I know a great restaurant near here.But , it's a little expensive and I don't have much money with me . 
 Thank you ! I'll be sure to return the favor after our first class , OK ? 
 Good job ! This is going to be a great night ! 
 What are you and Corey doing for Valentine ’ s Day this Friday ? 
 You have to do something romantic . 
 Well , you have three kids , so you knew what it meant once upon a time ! 
 Do you take a bus to and from work ? 
 Hmm . I have the same problem . When I leave work , it ’ s always rush hour.So the buses are always crowded . 
 That sounds terrible the way you describe it . But you know , not long ago I really suffered on the bus . 
 You just can ’ t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full , so I waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding ! 
 Yeah , absolutely ! 
 You were so happy , weren ’ t you ? 
 I think it's high time we had lunch . 
 I am sorry for that . I was so attracted by the beautiful scenery . 
 I suppose the local one . 
 Yes . What about you ? 
 Then your salary must be high . 
 Is this time one of them ? 
 Really ? We have only one chance every year . 
 Do you think it looks good on me ? 
 You won't believe it , but it was really cheap . 
 Let's go for a drink after work . 
 What kind of sport do you often do ? 
 I used to swim a lot , but now I'm taking gym classes . 
 I can't believe the boss was absent from today's meeting . 
 Any chance of using your telephone ? 
 Well , I thought it was not that serious . 
 I'm falling in love . 
 That girl in my econ class . She is so hot . 
 No . I didn't even talk to her yet . But I think I'm in love . 
 I don't think so . I've been following her around campus and I haven't seen another guy . 
 I plan on running into her in the cafeteria when she's alone . I think I'll ask her then . 
 She's the only thing I can think of all day long . 
 Aright . I'll talk to you later . 
 Willing to help , maybe , but not as helpful as you think . 
 Last night he told the children a cliff-hanger story and both of them were scared out of sleep . 
 Yeah . But he soon feel regretted for it . 
 He is more nice than wise . 
 Not really . To be honest , it's very cheap . I only spent $ 100 . 
 Yes . I bought it in Johnson thrift store . 
 Yes , it is . 
 I am tired of everything in my life . 
 You don ’ t know that I have been over-protected by my mother these years . I am really about to leave the family and spread my wings . 
 Would you mind going to dinner with me tonight ? 
 OK . 
 What's another Japanese art ? 
 Tea Ceremony ! Tell me about Tea Ceremony . 
 I see . 
 How do you learn that ? Is that something that your mother would teach you ? How do people learn that ? 
 So , you finally got your doctorate in genetics . Well done ! 
 What are you thinking of doing ? 
 There must be several private companies that are interested in employing someone like you . You could do some research for a university . There ’ s a lot of discussion about genetics nowadays . Someone wit 
 Well , I hope scientists don ’ t decode to make a clone of me in the future ! I wouldn ’ t like to be the subject of an experiment . 
 New York Times . I read it everyday . 
 It's too biased . I just don't agree with their one-sided reporting . 
 Yes , they have a good reputation for fairness . 
 I know clearly at the bottom of my heart . I just can't set my mind at rest because of the child . She's little . She cannot understand us and accept such truth . 
 I see . OK . 
 I ’ Ve been playing computer games . 
 It ’ s called Counter Strike . It ’ s a first person shooter game . It ’ s awesome . It ’ s a multi player game where you can go online and compete against players from all over the world . 
 My laptop is on my bed . If you think it ’ s so easy then get on line and try to beat me . 
 Damp it ! How are you killing me with a single shot ? It ’ s not fair ! I don ’ t want to play anymore ! Let ’ s go get something to eat . 
 Hey , that ’ s a very nice hairdo you ’ re wearing ! 
 You did it yourself ? Wow , you are good ! 
 He ’ s just got no idea of how good you are . 
 What ? 
 Cool ! I wish I could have been there ! 
 Yes . But if I have any more soup , I think I'll die . 
 Yes , she does . She works at home . 
 Oh , no . Most of the time I do these things . She is a writer . 
 What kinds of Tv programs do you enjoy watching ? 
 I like those kinds of programs too . They ’ re very informative . I think that many people underrate the education value of Tv . 
 Yeah . And that ’ s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational ! 
 In my country , there ’ s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown . I think it ’ s about six minutes per hour . 
 No . they don ’ t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . Is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on Tv in your country ? 
 Some people have satellite and cable Tv in my country , but people don ’ t seem to keen to pay for their Tv programs . Besides , the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programs . 
 Hi , Ann . I was wondering if you are free tomorrow night ? 
 I've just gotten a pair of pre-sale Star Wars movie tickets from a friend and was thinking of inviting you along for the opening premiere . Are you interested ? 
 My pleasure . 
 A friend of mine works at the corporate headquarters of Pepsi , which is a major sponsor of the movie . He was able to get the tickets for free , and then he sold two more for me for 50 dollars a piece . 
 Not really . Considering the fact that other people were willing to pay as much as 200 dollars each on the black market . Besides , I knew you were really looking forward to watching Star Wars on the opening day . 
 Well , let's see . The movie stars at 10 . We should be there at least 1 hour earlier , because there is a big line . I could pick you up at your house at 8 , if that's ok with you . 
 Okay . 
 Yeah , that's great . I'll see you tomorrow night . 
 Bye , Ann ! 
 Look out , honey . Let's come to the shoal waters . Follow me ! 
 Honey , listen to me . First , you should learn how to breathe in and breathe out . 
 Do be patient , Honey . Let's do it slowly and correctly . 
 Come on , sweetie , you've done very well . It is the first step that is tough . 
 Yes , well done . That's the way to go . How clever you are ! You've got it . 
 Exactly , next , you should hold your legs together and extend your arms above your head . 
 That's the way to go . Now , you are flying , my boy . 
 Nothing . 
 Just get out of my face ! 
 Leave me alone ! 
 I don't want to talk about it . 
 I blew the finally exam . 
 No , I'm not . 
 Do you like playing table tennis ? 
 When did you start it ? 
 Don't just stand outside . Come on in . 
 This is Alex . Remember ? This is Sean . 
 Over there are Stacy and Rebecca . We're all on the school's tennis team . 
 That's my boyfriend Matt . Isn't he cute ? 
 Come on . I'll introduce you two . 
 I don ’ t think so . 
 That ’ s should be fun . 
 Hello , Jack . It ’ s Mary . What are you doing in your office ? 
 Would you like to come and have dinner with us on Friday ? 
 What about Saturday ? 
 Will you come round next Tuesday ? 
 What do you say next Wednesday then ? 
 Okay . Bye . 
 I lost all my lottery winnings playing the stock market . 
 I hear you're moving to New York . 
 Well , we'll certainly miss you in Boston . 
 Let's keep in touch . 
 What's a good place for sightseeing ? 
 we are going out for dinner tonight . Are you coming , Betty ? 
 oh , Jake made a reservation at Friday's . 
 yes , the one with the R $ D team . Is that a problem ? 
 why did you say so ? 
 oh , really ? 
 are you kidding me ? How could he behave like that ? 
 what a shame ! Didn't he realized that ? 
 maybe he should really something about eating etiquette . 
 Hey Matt . I just got a job at a consulting firm . 
 I'm so happy . I don't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore . 
 I start next Monday . 
 I know . I'm a little nervous , but it's pretty exciting . 
 Yeah . I'm going to celebrate tonight . Wanna hang out ? 
 Of course . How about Toby ? Should we call him ? 
 I should still tell him . In the least , I can refer him to my company . It might help . 
 So , did I tell you about my New Year ’ s resolution ? I ’ Ve decided to go on a diet . 
 Exactly ! I ’ m going to cut out all that junk I eat , no more chips , no more soda , no more fried food . 
 But this time I ’ m going to stick to it . I really mean it ! Trust me , Carol , I ’ m going to be a new man in one year ’ s time ! 
 Thanks , honey , that was a great meal . I ’ m stuffed . Do we have any chips left ? 
 Yes . I am a bit confused . My sociology class is supposed to read a chapter in a book called Sociology and the Modern Age . According to the syllabus , the book is in the library , but I haven't been able to find it . 
 Yes , uh ... I put it in the front of my sociology notebook . Oh , here it is . 
 I'm sorry - I still don't understand . 
 So , will I be able to find this book ? 
 Okay . Thank you . I understand now . 
 No ! I am on my way to the reserve room . Thanks again ! 
 I think it is unemployment that gives rise to such social problems . 
 You are right . 
 Bill and Betty have already grown up . 
 Look at that big tree over there . 
 Do you know that I fell in love with you at the first sight then ? 
 But you agreed to go out with me at last . 
 So do you feel happy now ? 
 Of course , we are the happiest family in the world . 
 Morning Sally ! What's up ? you seem many hurry ! 
 Don't worry , I'll drive you . 
 How are your cases coming along ? 
 Wow , Good for you . It sounds like a lot of work . I'm proud of you ! Is this the red of building ? 
 You're welcome . Good luck , bye ! 
 Merry Christmas , Mr . Wang . I would like to give you the book I specially chose as my appreciation for your sincere help to me in the past few days . 
 I hope it will be of some use to you . 
 That will be great . 
 It is free on weekend . 
 Here is a guiding plan . 
 Why are you so kind to him ? 
 So that's how it is ! Now he ’ s in trouble , but I belive he will rise to his own feet again . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 You can apply for one here . 
 If you like , you can apply right now . 
 I ’ m going to need you to complete this application . 
 Then I will take your picture for your passport . 
 Your passport will be ready in a few weeks . 
 Her dress looks funny . 
 Are you kidding She is behind the times . That style went out last year . 
 Well , you ’ re really as out-dated as she is . 
 No wonder you never buy me a new dress . 
 I'd love to , but I'm broke . Maybe after payday . 
 Why ? 
 I hear it's Chinese Valentine's Day ! Don't you know ? 
 It's not too late . Go to buy some now . 
 It's hard to say . Perhaps swimming is my favorite . I like swimming because it helps improve my lung capacity . In the scorching summer days , there's nothing like a cool swim . Currently , I go to the pool twice every week . 
 Well , it costs an arm and a leg — 30 yuan per person . What a costly sport ! That is why I have to refrain from even thinking about it . And I find jogging a very agreeable substitute . 
 You know what ? You won't get a rush from it until you fully understand it . It is a simple sport and doesn't require skills of any sort . This leaves room for me to enjoy the beautiful suburban scenery while jogging . Fresh air caresses my face and blows into my chest , which translates into inspirations . Inspirations are really good stuff for a writer like me . Sometimes , I even come up with a verse or two . 
 I'll need a parking permit for next semester . 
 I only attend class part-time in the evenings . 
 I have both , but I usually use my car to get to school . 
 I'll pay cash . 
 No , thank you . 
 Thanks for lunch . It was delicious . 
 Next time lunch is on me . 
 I'm serious . 
 It's a deal . 
 Oh . it ‘ s a case flowers . It ’ s very kind of you . 
 I love flowers you know . Thank you very much . 
 What a terrible house ! 
 The door bell doesn't work , the sink is leaking , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart ! 
 Oh , no . It looks like we're late . 
 There're so many people here . Where are Rich and Cath and Taylor's parents ? 
 That was such a touching speech . He must have really known Taylor well . 
 Mary , Pam and I are going to the mall later to buy some new clothes . Do you want to come ? 
 Pam and I are wondering if you'd like to go to the mall with us . 
 Sink ? 
 Mary , you're going to have to work on your pronunciation . 
 But give yourself some time . You just got here . 
 With this ring I thee wed . Wear it as a symbol of our love and commitment . 
 This one ? 
 Oh , right . This one , right ? 
 Okay , Okay , I got it ! This is the ring finger ! 
 Have you heard about Michael's new home ? It's in one of the poshest areas in this area . 
 No , he's living in an old house in Warton . 
 That's the one . 
 He didn't buy it . His grandfather died recently and left him loads of money . 
 No one in the family expected to get a dime from him . It was quite a surprise . 
 He still has a complaint though . 
 He wanted to live right on a bus line , but he doesn't . so , if he wants to take a bus anywhere , he has to walk 1/4 mile to get to a bus stop . 
 You can say that again . 
 Are you sure of that ? 
 They may have some difficulty in doing it . 
 What was wrong ? 
 I didn ’ t mean to hurt anyone . 
 hello . Where are you headed today ? 
 do you have your passport with you ? 
 fortunately for you , you don't . Next time , if you have any questions about visas , you should try to find out before you get to the airport . 
 would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ? 
 let me see here ... yes , there's one left . 
 alright . How many pieces of luggage are you checking in ? 
 if that's your only piece of luggage , it is small enough to carry on with you . Would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ? 
 you're here a bit early , so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour . Here's your boarding pass . Enjoy your flight ! 
 I agree with you , but that's easier said than done . 
 Don ’ t worry about it . 
 I think you just need to get more sleep . 
 We can't wait any longer ... 
 You'll knock yourself out the way you've worked.Why don't you slow down ? 
 All right.Now that everybody's here . Shall we be getting started ? Miss Lin , are you ready ? 
 Excuse me , Miss Lin.Would you mind speaking up , please ? I can't hear you very well . 
 Mark , you've been coming home late these days . What are you busy doing ? 
 How many hours do you work each day now ? 
 That's tough indeed ! Do you think your health can afford ? 
 Surely you'll be paid extra for overtime , but do you think it's really worth ? 
 Oh , yes . Money comes faster in that way than otherwise . 
 That's true . 
 Most people like football . More boys like football than girls . A few girls play it really well . Some people like playing basketball . 
 More and more people like it now . fewer people play table tennis than before . Many people like swimming , because it is fun and keeps you fit . 
 Extreme sports are only for a small minority of people . Several people from my university enjoy them , but most of us just watch . No one I know plays golf . 
 A great deal of people follow rugby in my country . 
 Trina , will you marry me ? 
 Oh , Babe , I can ’ t wait to spend the rest of my life with you ! I can ’ t wait for all the adventures we ’ re going to have , for all the fights and the laughter . I can ’ t wait to grow old and wrinkly with you . 
 She what ? 
 Four hundred ? 
 Ah ... 
 Wow . 
 If I survive the next six months . 
 Yeah . He's the most experienced athlete in the field . 
 Good boy ! 
 I'll be leaving on the fifth of August for the vacation 
 I'm taking two weeks now . but I want to save the other week and take it sometime during the winter . 
 To the beach 
 Oh , I don't need to do that . I'll be staying with friends 
 Just think , in a few days , I'll be swimming and lying in the sun and just taking it easy . 
 Yes , summer is coming . 
 I'd like to go to Tianjin . 
 Yes , of course . And what's your plan ? 
 That's great . 
 Believe me , you really look much better than before . 
 Hey John . I have some great news . 
 I got a job offer from Dell . 
 I thought I did bad on the interview , but I guess I was wrong . I'm so happy right now . 
 Thanks . I feel like celebrating . Let's go have a beer . It's on me . 
 What would you like to drink ? Tea or coffee ? 
 So , you also like Coffee ? 
 Me too , but I think we shouldn't drink too much of it , as it's not very healthy . 
 But I also heard that coffee and its caffeine content , serve as a drug on the human body that negatively affects the central nervous system , as well as other organs , and leads to addiction 
 Well , I adjust going to have to disagree with you . A healthy body wakes up without caffeine ! 
 You may try to have some alternatives and see how you feel . 
 May I have two tickets for Tiny Times ? 
 2:30 , please . 
 Sorry , we have student cards . We can get discounts with these , can't we ? 
 Here is 50 yuan . 
 I really do not have time to deal with some lovesick computer geek . 
 Sorry , Dave , I didn't mean you . I am just not in the mood for this . I have work to do . 
 Do you have brothers and sisters ? 
 Oh , I have an elder sister . She is married .. Her husband is a businessman . 
 No , they live alone . 
 You mean Lily's boyfriend ? 
 Well , he is a hard case . Everyone would feel headache about him . 
 Nothing special . I just want to get plastered . 
 YY's ? That place is boring . How about Xara's ? It's real classy , and they keep the place spin and span . 
 On second thought , I think I'll join you . 
 Wow , they really went to town on this place ! 
 Sure is . Waiter , bring us two drafts , please . 
 When in Rome , do as the Romans do . 
 Much better today . 
 It's a girl . 
 Sure.She is a peaceful child . 
 So they say . 
 Well.The doctor said I have to remain here for at least two more days because I'm rather weak after childbirth . 
 Mom , have we got any cookies ? 
 I know , but I'm hungry . 
 Aw , Mom . I don't want fruit , Aren't there any chocolate chips ? 
 Yes , a little . 
 I tried before . There are no buttons on the air conditioning . 
 I think it is centrally controlled . They control it at the main desk . 
 I'm going downstairs for more drinking water . I will ask them . 
 They said it is centrally controlled.All the rooms are the same . They can't change it . 
 You can wear more clothes . 
 hi . I ’ m feeling very nervous . I just had a test and I ’ m not sure how well or how badly I did . 
 that ’ s true . I really should go home and prepare for the next test , but I ’ m feeling tired . 
 ok . I feel like sitting down and having a chat . How have you been recently ? 
 that ’ s a good idea . I usually just sit at home alone and get increasingly moody . 
 perhaps I ’ m being too shy . I should go out more too and not spend time worrying about tests ! 
 Waiting for someone . 
 You're right . He is so funny and I think I'm in love with him . 
 I know , but I keep thinking of him every day . And I get really depressed when he's not online . 
 Well , this might be silly . But I just can't get him off my mind . And I can't help missing him . 
 Yes . He said I'm his dream girl . 
 I know . I can't tell whether he's serious or not so I need your advice . 
 The new computer software is driving me crazy ! I really need a break ! 
 That ’ s what I ’ Ve heard . But as far as I ’ m concerned , it takes a genius to figure it out . Can you pass the sugar , please ? 
 So , Is this your first time to TAIWAN ? 
 Oh , really ? And you are from the State , right ? 
 Oh , I am so sorry . 
 Susan is going to get a divorce . 
 She told me that peter and she has a quarrel last nigh , and she left this morning , bag and baggage . 
 Tomorrow will be my first day at work , what do you think I should be wearing ? 
 Indeed , I found most of the employees dress casually when I went to the interview . Only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . It seems that their dress code is not that formal . Probably , I should put on car key and simple shirt . 
 Ye Ting , who are these people in the picture ? 
 So you have two brothers ? 
 Are you going out again ? 
 You mustn't go to bed very late . Can you be home before nine . 
 No . I won't let you ride a bicycle late at night . 
 OK . Here's the key . Take care . 
 Hello . Could I speak to Justin , please ? 
 Oh , hi Justin . This is Karen Hepburn.We met at Chris and Jim's party . 
 Great . Uh , Justin , would you like to see Otis Lesley on Thursday night ? He's at the Kangaroo Club . 
 Oh ... that's too bad . 
 Actually , are you doing anything on Friday or Saturday ? He's playing those two nights as well . 
 At eight sharp.How about meeting in front of the club at about a quarter after seven ? 
 Sure ! 
 OK . I'll take your bet , as long as the winner gets to pick the movie . What about you , Nick ? 
 Why not ! I rolled a five . The category is Best Pictures . 
 I know that , it's The English Patient . It was one of the only good American movies of the 90s . 
 I often go to a place of leisure . 
 I very much like to go to a cafe and doze in the afternoon sunshine . 
 The coffee , books , music and sunshine are just beautiful there . 
 I may take you there some day . 
 So Jen , what did you think of William ? Did you guys have a nice time on your first date ? 
 You said all that on the first date ? Alright ... Well are you two going out again ? 
 I think Andy's party will be fun . 
 What's that ? 
 Sure . Oh , that reminds me . Could I borrow your black leather boots ? 
 That sounds pretty good . But isn't downloading music illegal ? 
 OK , I'm going to get iTunes and download some Vanilla Ice songs . 
 Do you believe in god ? 
 I ’ m not sure . Why don ’ t you believe there is a god ? 
 I basically believe in science over theology . I mean , I believe in evolution for example . However , there are many things that science hasn ’ t explained yet . 
 For example ? 
 Yes . Such people don ’ t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs . 
 It's all yours . 
 Well , I hope it's comfortable enough for you . 
 You have a phone on the bedside table that you can use . 
 Kind of . It leads to my bedroom . 
 Joe , how are you doing ? 
 I am free that night , and a party sounds good . 
 I kind of know where you live , but could you e-mail me your address ? 
 I would really like to bring my friend Jake , if that would be OK . 
 Would you like some help with the food ? 
 Come on in . Make yourself at home . 
 Are you Elvin ? 
 I'm Mary . I want to say I really admire the software you're designed . 
 It is ? 
 I can't take the credit for that . I'm just Zina's assistant . She's the pro . 
 Selfishness is one human beings instincts . It is very difficult to get it out root and branch . 
 His mother , not me , should do this . 
 I ’ m very sorry I can ’ t . 
 I ’ m afraid I have some business to attend to . 
 I ’ d love to but I have to help John with his math problems right now . 
 No , thanks . His home is not far and I can walk there . 
 Ok , thank you . 
 Thank you.Thanks to the baker , I benefit a lot from him . 
 Yes , it is . Are you looking for housing for this semester ? 
 It is , but I can put you on a waiting list , if you would like . 
 Yes , here is a catalog that is put out every year with locations that meet campus requirements for As . 
 The individual landlord's numbers are next to each entry . You can call them with any questions you may have . 
 Hi , Shirley . I'm Sophie . It's nice to meet you . 
 Please come in . 
 I really appreciate it . 
 I will . Actually , I am worried so much about the security of this community because my house has been burgled twice before . 
 Really ? That's good . Is there any supermarket in our neighborhood ? 
 That's terrific ! 
 Yeah , and we can get to know each other at the party . 
 Which ? Zina ? What time is it ? 
 What note ? I can't see . I just pulled an all-nighter . 
 And ? What does it say ? Isn't there a name ? 
 I know I ’ m going to bite the dust going down this hill . I almost got killed on the chair lift ! This is going to be so embarrassing . 
 This is only your second time skiing . This is definitely a case of the blind leading the blind . 
 I don ’ t think I can get up enough nerve to do this . 
 No ! ! ! 
 Don ’ t hold your breath ! 
 No , why ? 
 Sure I like shopping . Who is organizing the party ? 
 What's the occasion ? 
 That's easy , how about a cowgirl ? Oh I know even better , a Canadian Mountie . 
 Leave it to me . I know exactly where to find it . 
 Excellent , come over at ten o'clock and we will start at the shopping center , the one around the corner from my house . They have just the shop we need . 
 I try to picture the Lord's face in my mind . 
 Yes . 
 I don ’ t know . I didn ’ t really feel like going out . I guess I ’ m feeling a little homesick . 
 I was . It ’ s just that the holidays are coming up and I won ’ t be able to home because I can ’ t afford the airfare . I ’ m just longing for some of the comforts of home , like my mom ’ s cooking and being around my family . 
 I see what you mean , but I ’ m still bummed out . 
 You know , I could really go for that . You don ’ t mind being my wingman for tonight ? 
 Great ! I must warn you though , whatever happens , don ’ t let me go on a drinking binge . Trust me , it ’ s not a pretty picture ! 
 Yes , of course . I need your student ID please . 
 Okay , Susan . It says here that you are a business major and you are in your second year . Is this information correct ? 
 Sure . That ’ s not a problem . Do you have the list of courses you want to take this semester ? 
 Yeah , that ’ s perfect . What about the subjects for your minor ? 
 Wow , you are going to be busy this semester ! Okay , here you go . You are registered now , you ’ ll have to make your first tuition payment before classes start . 
 She means business , for sure . 
 We'd better get back to work . 
 It seems like it rains every time we plan a picnic . 
 You are late . What ’ s the deal ? 
 Has Alan shown up yet ? 
 I wonder what happened . 
 Last week his sister was admitted to the hospital . 
 His sister had a car accident last week . 
 She is still in a coma . 
 This cake is excellent . Where did you buy it ? 
 Excuse me . Mr . Li . May I ask you some questions ? 
 Can you tell me how many credits would be enough for a Bachelor's degree ? 
 How long does it take to earn a Bachelor's degree ? 
 I would much rather see her once or twice and not do anything about it — — what could I about it anyway ? 
 Don ’ t you think she is a bit out of my way ? 
 If I do try to do anything , I ’ d only be sent off with a flea in my ear . 
 Excuse me . Have you got the time ? 
 Does your watch keep good time ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Think nothing of it . 
 Neither have I . 
 Yes , we must . What have you been doing since I last saw you ? 
 I've been learning Japanese every evening . 
 I hope to visit Japan next year . 
 Yes , let's go into the dance-hall and ask if we can take dancing-lessons . 
 Come in and have some coffee , Anna . The kids have just gone out to the mall to hang out with their friends . 
 They spend hours there , especially on weekends . 
 I know several . But wouldn ’ t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ? 
 No , it ’ s easy . We ’ ll just take the shirt back to the men ’ s department and show them the sales slip . They ’ ll exchange it for the correct size or give you a refund . 
 Sure . I love going to the mall . 
 Come on , you must tell me everything about him . 
 Hmm ... 
 Oh , how long ? 
 OK . OK . You'd better tell me what he does . 
 Really ? 
 Fine . 
 My wife gave birth to our first child today . 
 Man , I ’ m freaking out ! You gotta help me ! 
 I can ’ t go through with this ! I just can ’ t ! I ’ m not ready for marriage ! What was I thinking ? I ’ m only thirty five years old ! I ’ Ve got my entire life ahead of me , adventures waiting ! I can ’ t settle down yet ! 
 I know . I know ! 
 You ’ re right . I ’ m being crazy ! Ok , I ’ m ready , let ’ s do this ! 
 Yesterday was April the first . 
 Not for the others , but for me . I was in the library going over my lessons when suddenly one of my roommates came in . He told me that I was wanted on the phone in my dormitory , and that person would call me again several minutes later . 
 Yes . I went back to the dorm only to find my roommates laughing and shouting " April Fool , April Fool " . 
 Only then did I realize it was April Fools ' Day . 
 Thanks . Wendy . There will be an important dinner party tonight . So I must make me the focus of my friends . 
 Yeah . I'm really looking forward to it . 
 They're pretty similar , but in different ways . I really can't decide . How about you ? 
 Does that mean work isn't that great ? 
 But work is a huge portion of our lives . I'm looking forward to making it fun . 
 I hope you're right . 
 No , not yet . I'm really worried . 
 Maybe you're right . But I'm still worried . 
 No , I was out . Was it worth watching ? 
 Oh , really ? So , Spain is through to the next round ? 
 How were things in the Tokyo branch when you were there ? 
 Do you see the trend continuing over the next few months ? 
 Why would you say that ? 
 I'll say ! Sometimes they just do things really differently . But one thing I can say , they are really hospitable . 
 Sure ! I just got back yesterday . I'm still suffering from jet lag . 
 Hi there Mr . Anderson ! How are you on this fine morning ? 
 It sure is cold this morning , isn ’ t it ? I barely even get out of bed ! 
 Did you catch the news this morning ? I heard that there was a fire on Byron Street . 
 Did you happen to watch the football game last night ? The Patriots scored in the last minute ! 
 Oh . . . By the way , I saw you with your daughter at the office Christmas party . She is really beautiful ! 
 Sir this is the 56th floor ! We are on the 70th ! 
 You look hot and tired . Jack , have you been exercising ? 
 Who won ? 
 What was the score ? 
 You'll have to take a make-up exam in logic . 
 Sorry to say you failed . 
 May I help you ? 
 Do you need anything else ? 
 This is all you want to check out ? 
 I ’ m going to need your library card . 
 You ’ ll need to take care of the video . 
 We will fine you if you damage it . 
 Hi , how are you doing ? 
 Same here.Have you seen any new films recently ? 
 Oh . really ? I saw it two years ago . It's worth seeing and it's thought-provoking . 
 It reflects some of our difficulties in this ever-changing world . 
 Well , it's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend to end quickly too . 
 Oh , that's too short-lived . 
 II can't agree more . The only-child-generation in China tends to know little about marriage . 
 In their mind , love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone . 
 Which is your preference , tea or coffee ? 
 When did you form this hobby ? 
 How do you get paid ? If you don't mind my asking . 
 And in the meantime , how do you pay the rent ? 
 What ? In your cubicle ? 
 Excuse me . Have you forgotten our drinks ? 
 Why is it taking so long ? 
 There is something wrong with this dish . 
 I don't think this is fresh . 
 Would you please ask the manager to come over ? 
 I hope we can make great progress in this new semester . 
 I hear we ’ ll have a new English teacher this semester . 
 I am sure we will . 
 Are you certain that that is what you want to do ? 
 Why do you think that this would be a good move ? 
 Yes , there are always pros and cons to making a career change . 
 I think the slight pay decrease might be worth it . The benefits are much better . 
 I think you should definitely apply for the position . 
 I'm a teacher . 
 Mind your own business . 
 He doesn't mind . As a matter of fact , he's very pleased . 
 I don't know . I think you might be over the hill . 
 Mountain biking is an Olympic sport ? 
 What ’ s your city like ? 
 Is the traffic bad in the city centre ? 
 What about restaurants and entertainment ? 
 Is there a lot of nightlife in your city ? 
 It sounds like a really exciting city to live in . 
 When do you celebrate Thanksgiving ? 
 What do you eat on that day ? 
 Anything else ? 
 I'm almost hungry . 
 Yeah , really . 
 Hi , I ’ m Susan Marshall.You can call me Susan.Nice to meet you . 
 Well , I ’ m a college student.How about you ? 
 I work for the Bank of China , in the International Section . 
 I sure hope you didn't trust anyone with your credit card number . 
 Easy ? Ha ! ! It was easy for them to cheat you ! ! 
 I think that ’ s settled . 
 How dare you speak to me like this . 
 Honey , I ’ ll be right back ! 
 I told you already ! I ’ m going to get my nails done . 
 Well , first of all , I like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . You should come with me ! 
 They don ’ t only paint my nails ! The manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish ! 
 Excuse me . Do you have a minute ? I'd like to tell you about the Bucky Card . 
 Do you know about the Bucky Card ? 
 The Bucky Card is a great way for you to save money while you have a good time here at school.It gives you discounts on all kinds of things . Movies , pizza , clothing , school supplies . 
 The Card doesn't actually give you discounts on beer.But it will give you discounts on certain club cover charges.So if you want to see your favorite band at Amy's or Cosmo's Club , you get a discount on the entrance fee . 
 Usually it's two dollars off the cover price . 
 This pamphlet shows you what restaurants and movie theaters have discounts.And twice every semester we will send you a new issue of the pamphlet.The Bucky Card has just started.Every couple months we have new businesses joining our program.It ' s a great way for students to save money ! 
 It costs only 19 dollars a year for a card . 
 But think of how much money you'll save ! You can use it for a year . 
 who are you writing a letter to ? 
 OK . I guess I could add something . Tell them that I send my love . 
 well , maybe you could tell them about my promotion . 
 just today . I guess I forgot to mention it . 
 shouldn't we finish writing this letter first ? 
 it is good news , but it looked like you were almost finished . We might as well just sign off . 
 I guess you can write that I'm looking forward to seeing them in June . 
 and also thank them from the bottom of my heart for the Christmas package they sent us . 
 what would you do without me ? 
 May I help you with something ? 
 What happened to this book ? 
 I ’ m going to have to charge you for the damage . 
 It ’ s only $ 5 . 
 I know it ’ s not . 
 Thank you for your payment . 
 He is penny wise and pound-foolish . 
 The trash of the world he sets high price upon , but the heavenly things he shamefully undervalues . 
 Hey , Tom . You look tired . Are you all right ? 
 How come ? 
 Don't you like games 
 Me too . Recently , I've made many friends on the net . Every day I talk to them and share many interesting things with them . 
 I'm afraid not . To me getting in touch with each other has more fun than the coolest computer games or the hottest information . 
 What's the weather like in your city ? 
 The summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 or25 in my city.the rain falls mostly in the winter.and we often get snow . 
 In winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that.the streets are often icing in the morning.with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms . 
 We do have a few foggy days in winter.but i would not say we have a lot of fogs.the sky are usually clearly over your city , are they ? 
 Have you ever had snow in your city ? 
 The river in my city sometime freeze over.people go ice-skating on it.on summer people go boating on the river.but few people go swimming because it is not very clean . 
 I used to think that Americans had so much money they didn ’ t know what to do with it . 
 Yes . But now I ’ Ve learned differently . Now I have a more realistic opinion . 
 There are lots of jobs , and almost everybody works . There is a high standard of living . People earn a lot , but they spend a lot to live . So there isn ’ t so much money after all . 
 That ’ s true . But Americans work hard for their money like we do . I don ’ t know why our spending habits are so different . 
 Didn ’ t you sleep well last night ? 
 Don ’ t worry . It ’ s only a cold . 
 You're right.The air is so warm and everything looks so fresh and green . 
 Marvelous idea ? 
 Well , I like others very much , but I really don't think much of this one . 
 Yes , but I don't like the story . 
 It would be good for both if they lived separately . My parents want to live apart from us . 
 Young people ought to carry out their responsibilities . If it's needed , they would live with their parents . 
 You need a child first , and that's your duty , too . 
 I went to visit a customer in IVS Company the other day . Their offices were very impressive , especially their company Logo which is all over the place . There are Logo models in metal , copper , clove , paper . They are even printed on the wall paper and the balls of the table-lights . It is really decorated identity . 
 Not at all ! I like the design so much . The designer must have thought really hard to come out with such a brilliant concept . 
 Oh , Linda . You must be so excited about going to study in America . 
 Well , I am sure you will . 
 What is the matter ? 
 Yes ? 
 Oh , listen , you'll soon learn , and I am sure they will explain to you how they like to get prepared . 
 So what did you think about the movie ? 
 Really ? I don't agree . This Star Wars episode was incredible ! 
 Well , one of the most spectacular things about this one was the special effects . State of the art special effects are the main reason for the success of previous episodes , so audiences have high expectations for this one , and I don't think they will be disappointed . 
 It's kind of cool that they are still using the same Star Wars theme song for this movie . 
 I know exactly what you mean . Hearing that song gives me a nostalgic feeling . 
 Do you think that they had anything to do with the casting of the movie ? 
 Well , maybe . But I like the little kid who played Manakin Skywalker . I can't imagine anyone else playing that role . 
 I've no idea . But looking at the success of Star Wars episode , I've a strong feeling production for the next episode will be selling pretty soon . I hope It will be even better than this one . 
 Well , I think we should go now . It's getting pretty late . 
 Well , you know what , don ’ t do it , ‘ cause the minute you do , they lose all respect for you . 
 Out of hand . 
 Where ’ d you meet him ? 
 About what ? 
 Excuse me ? 
 What's so special today ? 
 Didn't you notice all the roses ? 
 Oh , God . I just forget it . 
 No . But now he will be in bigger trouble ! What's a boyfriend for ? Forget about Valentine's Day ? 
 Oh , it's Clive . 
 Excuse me for a while.Clive asked me out to a movie ! Do you want to join us ? 
 So what ? 
 John , I ’ d like you to meet Charles Brown , our new manager at the airport . 
 He is short , well-built , and he ’ s got light blond hair . 
 He has a mustache , if I remember correctly , and a light complexion . 
 He is in his late thirties . 
 At two thirty . 
 Oh , Steven , I made a big mistake . 
 I really wish I hadn ’ t done it . 
 I got caught cheating . I feel so ashamed . The teacher saw me and told me I failed . 
 You know my father . If I fail , he'll kill me . I have to do well . 
 I know ... I know ... it's all my fault . I feel awful that I didn ’ t study , and I cheated , and I got caught . 
 Hello , John . How are you ? 
 Very well , thanks . Nice to see you again . I haven't seen you for a long time . What have you been doing lately ? 
 Fine , thanks . I've been busy lately . 
 I've been studying for my exams . My school exams will begin next month . 
 Thanks . And how are your parents ? 
 Where are you going now ? 
 I can't . I have to meet someone . 
 Good-bye . See you again sometime . 
 Thank you . Good evening , Mr.Dean . 
 I'm Helen Baker . 
 Glad to meet you , too . 
 I'm from New Zealand . 
 I'm a teacher . 
 I ’ m tired , Larry . Can we have a break ? 
 I know , but I ’ m really tired . My stomach feels funny . 
 I was too excited to sleep last night . I didn ’ t go to sleep until quite late . 
 About 2 o ’ clock in the morning . 
 About 2 o ’ clock . 
 You did , but I can ’ t help it . 
 Which one do I choose ? I don ’ t want to give up , but I really feel tired . 
 Let me think about it . What should I do ? I think I will not give up . 
 Yeah , it ’ s pretty nice , but its so red because of air pollution . 
 Yeah , the smog from all these cars gets into the air and turns the sunlight red . 
 Yeah , more people need to take public transportation or carpool . 
 Yeah , it ’ s your turn to drive next week . Don ’ t be late picking me up . 
 Well , give me a call if you can ’ t make it for some reason . 
 Thank you , same to you ! Lee , have you got any plans ? 
 How nice ! Have fun ! 
 It ’ s none of my business . 
 I don ’ t say that . But it seems to me the housewife should do that . 
 Hum ... 
 Really ? I thought his wife couldn ’ t have a baby . 
 Oh , what a coincidence ! I bet Bobby must be very happy about it . He likes children and always wants a child of his own . 
 Oh , right . Now I know why they would want to see our boy . It ’ s hard to imagine the wonder ! Are they expecting a boy or a girl ? 
 Oh ! You mean she doesn ’ t have to work now ? It ’ s hard for young parents not to overreact , isn ’ t it ? 
 Yeah , the new ones can be tricky . What are you trying to buy ? 
 Are you ready to go ? 
 The money goes in the slot over there . It has to be smooth to go in . 
 Just remember that you might have to feed the money in a couple of times to get it to work . 
 Make your selection and hope for the best . Vending machines aren't all that reliable . 
 You seem to have it down . Have a good day ! 
 Hello , Mr . Clark . You ’ re early for lunch . It ’ s only eleven o ’ clock . 
 What would you like today ? 
 And would you like salad ? The salad plate today is lettuce , tomatoes , and black olives . 
 I couldn ’ t find the book I was looking for . 
 I checked . 
 It should have been , but it wasn ’ t . 
 Will you be getting another copy anytime soon ? 
 Would you be able to reserve it for me ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 sure , I am a total internet junkie , I can't survive without internet . 
 well , there are a lot of things , like reading news , email , shopping , etc . but mostly I chat online . You could say I'm addicted to online chatting . 
 well , basically it's similar to face-to-face chat , but you type instead of talk . You should try it at least once . 
 to people all over the world ! I have a lot of net pals . See , the magic of internet is that it connects people from all over the world . You can chat with someone thousands of miles away as if they were 
 well , my suggestion for a newbie like you is that don't get lost in the cyberspace . You know internet won't do the filtration for you , so you still need to use your judgement . There are a lot of per 
 What are you doing now , Steven ? 
 Oh , my God . Do you want to be a millionaire ? I can see you are very crazy about money . 
 No , you are wrong . Money can't buy happiness and health . I won't sacrifice my health in order to get money . In other words , I don't want to be a millionaire and I want to have more free time to enjoy life . 
 Maybe you are right . Please take care of yourself when you make money . Anyway health is the most important thing . 
 No thanks . 
 Yes , it is . 
 Take it easy . There is still one more week left before the exam begins . Have you prepared for it well ? 
 Then shall we make preparations together ? 
 All right . But I am very poor at math . Would you like to help me with my math ? 
 Have you ever been to any other country ? 
 That's also my dream . 
 Why not ? 
 The cat has eaten my fish , I'll kill it . 
 I'll beat him . 
 You ’ re all set now ? 
 Really , it was nothing . 
 I was happy to help . 
 Don ’ t mention it . 
 Let's get together this weekend . 
 What time is it , Tom ? 
 Is it ? I had no idea it was so late . I must be off now . 
 I must catch the nine-thirty train . 
 Are you still at that work ? 
 What sort of job do you have in mind ? 
 But it's very tired . 
 What's your parents ' opinion ? 
 is this seat taken ? 
 thanks . 
 yes , on a business trip . How about you ? 
 yes , I went there once last summer . 
 I think it is amazing . You can enjoy both the traditional Chinese culture as well as the vitality of a modern cosmopolitan city . The only thing I didn't enjoy was the subway . 
 yes . There were always so many people . After taking the subway during the rush hour , you ’ ll envy sardines in their cans . 
 that's a good idea . Wish you a great vacation ! 
 Do you like watching TV ? 
 What do you exactly mean by usually ? 
 We're forming a study group to prepare for the finals . Do you want to join us ? 
 After you try it once this way , I don't think you'll ever put off studying till the end again . 
 We plan to get together once a week . 
 We were talking about Wednesday evenings at the library , from seven to eight . 
 What is wrong with Peter ? He sure looks unhappy . 
 How foolish he is . The girl is inviting . She often makes a pass at boys . 
 Can you lend me your car ? 
 Peter , which club do you want to join ? 
 I am a member of the basketball club . Do you want to join us ? 
 It's OK . Don't worry about it . Our school coach will train us to play basketball . 
 Oh , thank you so much . 
 I really appreciated it . 
 It was so kind of you . 
 You ’ re a real friend in need . 
 Hi , Linda . I have two concert complimentary tickets . Will you go with me tonight ? 
 It will be held at the Central Music Hall . 
 It ’ s a piano solo . I'm fond of piano , you know . 
 Let ’ s meet at the park at 6:00 . 
 I'm tired of this job . 
 Good afternoon , would you mind if I sit here ? 
 I ’ m Jack . What ’ s your name ? 
 Do you like this place ? 
 How often ? 
 Who ’ s that ? 
 Do you like swimming ? 
 What shall I call him ? 
 What's he doing ? 
 Hi , John ! How was your vacation ? 
 That must have been wonderful . Do anything interesting ? 
 Wow , isn't that dangerous ? 
 Tell me about it . 
 500 feet ! I would never be able to do that . 
 It's a lovely day , isn't it ? 
 I love it when the weather is like this.Why don't we sit down outside and have our lunch ? 
 I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado ; but I must admit , this sure is a nice spring day . 
 Okay.Hey , is that a dark cloud over there ? Do you think it will rain after all ? 
 If the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend.It ' s been a while since I've not really gotten some sun . 
 Yes , I did . 
 I don't think much of the film . 
 Oh , I'm not sure I agree with you . It was not a good one , but it was not the worst one . Actually , it wasn't too bad . 
 What's more , some scenes were good , much fit for the children . 
 There has been talk at school about canceling the concert . 
 Just word of mouth . 
 Did you come late ? 
 Why is that ? 
 Oh , okay . Well , here you go . 
 Oh , wait , here are the rest . 
 Don't mention it . 
 Sure . Do you think that the total is wrong or that you got something marked wrong that should have been marked right ? 
 Let's just go over all of it to double-check . 
 Here is the answer sheet . Do you see a place where I marked something wrong that should have been right ? 
 OK , now that we've gotten those straightened out , let's total the score . 
 Well , if I total that like this and divide by this number , I get this total . Do you agree ? 
 Well then , we are all straight . Have a good day and thanks for bringing that to my attention . 
 What kind of movie is it ? 
 Oh , I've no interest in such films . 
 Yeah . I could not stand living here . There is always much noise in the neighborhood . 
 You know , on weekends when we wanted to have late rise in the morning , our neighbour started to raise Cain . 
 He's very strict with us . 
 Indeed . He's strict with himself too . We can see every lecture of his is well-prepared . 
 What--is tomorrow night something special ? 
 I don't need to drink every weekend . I could be happy just staying home , you know . 
 Do you feel like dancing ? 
 Alright.At least that's better than sitting in a bar with your alcoholic friends . 
 No , maybe they're not . But they're close . 
 Let's go to the Latin Club . I think they will have a Brazilian band there this weekend . Maybe it's Friday night . 
 The New Bar is all techno music on Friday night.You really want to dance to that ? 
 No . But they play techno all the time . It drives me crazy after forty minutes.And anyhow , if we go to the Latin Club you could actually learn some Latin dance steps.At the New Bar you'll just shake yourself around for an hour.And then you'll get sick of stand you'll want to go get drunk somewhere where the drinks are cheaper . I know you . 
 Oh . You mean Jerry's , over on the east side.That wasn't my idea going there . 
 It's true . I would never go there again either.Country music is a nightmare . So is it the Latin Club ? 
 Well , it seems you'll have to learn some Spanish too , won't you ? 
 David , do you think we are lucky to have the weekend ? 
 I agree with you . What do you want to do , except sleeping ? 
 I am better . I will go out to have a visit to my aunt . Why don't we have fun on weekend ? 
 And what's your vision ? 
 Mine's 20/20 . Life just isn't fair , is it ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 They don't have toilets at the campground ? 
 A funny thing happened to me the other day . 
 I was just thinking about someone I went to school with , this boy I was quite friendly with in third grade . We used to hang out together - he lived next door - but then my parents moved and I changed schools and never saw him again . 
 Well , I was walking down Nan Jing Dong Lu ( Nan-Jing E . Rd . ) during my lunch break thinking about this boy-I have no idea why I was thinking about him . 
 Yes . And suddenly I heard someone call my name . I turned around and there was this man looking at me . I didn't recognize him at all , but he obviously knew who I was . 
 You got it . Well , he walked up to me and said my name again and then I realized it was the boy I had been thinking about , the one from third grade ! 
 I stayed up all night writing a report . 
 Hi , how ’ re you doing ? 
 Oh , what ’ s the matter ? 
 Oh , that ’ s too bad . Why don ’ t you take some aspirin ? 
 Well , it ’ s necessary for you to see a doctor . 
 Well , you ’ d better get some rest . 
 Bye . 
 Are you sure ? Who told you that ? I highly doubt that they would take the step to merge into one company ... They're supposed to be bitter enemies , the strictest of competitors.It must be a rumor.It can't be true . 
 The competition must have been too stiff for U-Tunes.Otherwise why would they allow themselves to be taken over by their sworn enemy ? 
 Daniel , would you like to have a look at my dorm ? 
 It is a small room , just for 4 people . 
 It only has 4 beds and 4 writing desks , but it is spacious and bright . 
 Of course . They are very friendly . 
 We are on the 5th floor , and there's a very nice view from the balcony . 
 Yes , that's a good idea . 
 Let's give them a hand . 
 Oh , no . I don't think I'm in that good form . 
 To where exactly ? 
 That's still too far for me . 
 If you gotta go , you gotta go . 
 I'm sorry , Steven . 
 I know . But I ’ m not ready for married life yet . 
 Your way does touch my heart . 
 I want to think of it for some time . 
 No , she's wearing my Chinese zodiac sign . 
 Yeah , are you surprised ? 
 What's the time ? My watch has stopped . 
 Is your watch right ? 
 How long will it take to learn English ? Will I be able to take other courses next semester or will English take up all of my time ? 
 You mean I could finish this course and still not know English ? You ’ Ve got to be kidding ! 
 So do we have to stay in this English class forever ? 
 So it ’ s really the same story . Practice , practice , practice and more practice is the only way to learn a language . 
 How nice it is here 
 I ’ Ve heard the whether here is ideal , just like spring most of the year 
 You're going to get into a lot of trouble if you do that . 
 I don't see anything wrong with what we're doing ! That's just the problem . In these kind of things , the trouble doesn't always appear at first . 
 Everything has gone as smooth as clockwork . Just like we planned ! That may be true , but if you were to do it , you would have trouble on the horizon . You always say that . 
 Okay . Have it your way , but don't say I didn't warn you . 
 Er ... no , go ahead . 
 Nice to meet you , Karren . I'm Tim Wang . 
 I can bet the farm that you will regret about your decision . You cannot find a better one . 
 No . But I ’ m sure she is a good girl . My sixth sense tells me so . 
 Betty , would you please read this letter of application I've just written ? I'd like to have your opinion . 
 Good ! I'm interested in your advice . 
 Good idea , Betty . What would you think about the second part ? 
 You're right , I'll change it . How about the last part ? 
 I agree . I appreciate your helping me . 
 There ’ s an interesting interview with a top fashion designer about the latest fashions . I enjoyed reading her thought . The which ? section is very interesting this month . They tested facial cleaners . T 
 Which tests do you mean ? 
 Oh , I see . I like to do those tests , too , but I don ’ t take them seriously . 
 You ’ re right . It ’ s sometimes hard to tell which pages are advertisement and which ones are articles . 
 But whenever we play , you just sit on the sand , drink beer , and watch the girls ! 
 To be honest , I don't think you could even win a gold in hopscotch ! 
 Will it be all right to visit you this evening ? 
 It's fine with me . 
 Very interesting ! 
 How about going to dance ? There is a very good nightclub nearby . 
 I'm glad you like it.The band is called " Four and One " . They are especially good at playing rock and roll . 
 Then you must be interested in disco dancing , aren't you ? 
 OK . Let's disco . 
 That's a waltz . Would you like to try it ? 
 All right . Let me get you something to drink . 
 Right . You're right . But she's just evil . Someone should drive a stake through her heart . 
 I'm OK . I'll be fine . I'v cool . I'm cold . I'm like ice . She won't know what hit her . 
 What do you need ? 
 I ’ m going to need your library card . 
 Why don ’ t you apply for one right now ? 
 Please fill out this application . 
 Now , sign your name on the back of the card . 
 Here ’ s your library card . 
 I can ’ t believe my English teacher is making me read pride and prejudice ! 
 But it ’ s so old . 
 No , not at all . 
 I didn ’ t realize it was a romance novel . What ’ s the main storyline ? 
 Why does he want to do that ? 
 Won ’ t they get his inheritance ? 
 I see . This sounds interesting ! Maybe my teacher isn ’ t so horrible after all . 
 There ’ s movie ? My teacher didn ’ t tell me that ! 
 It would take a lot less time .. 
 Ok . That sounds like a deal . 
 I don't know , what's wrong ? 
 Maybe you should ask him openly . 
 There are hundreds and hundreds . English is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions . 
 I'll look up the rate . To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof . It means to search for and find some information . 
 That is just a natural , grammatical English expression . It has a direct translation in other languages . 
 Good morning , Mr.Black . I am the new secretary . 
 I don't want to make a bad impression . 
 I will . 
 I'll keep that in mind . Does everything on the desk belong to me ? 
 What's the extension number for my phone ? 
 Can I make personal phone calls during my office hours ? 
 I understand . 
 Oh ! I just want to drop in on him for a chat . 
 No , thank you.Please tell him to phone me when he comes back . 
 What do you mean ? 
 I think the Romans do what everyone else does . 
 And Roman really loves life . He knows how to enjoy himself . 
 Really ? 
 By air of course . 
 what about renting a restaurant and treating the employees to a nice dinner ? 
 okay , let me think . What about a party-and-movie night ? We can rearrange our reference room , invite a band to play some music , order in some food and watch a movie later . 
 well , we can ask people to make small contributions . 
 BYOB ? What's that ? 
 so we're just going to have a party where they bring their own drinks and we just give them some snacks ? I don't know how well that will go over . 
 oh , that sounds like fun ! 
 It's convenient . People in network go everywhere by subway if they don't drive . 
 What's the difference ? 
 What can you see from a tram or a double-decker ? 
 But they are not as convenient as the subway . 
 Well , maybe you are right . We'll be more amused in a tram or a double-decker than on the subway . 
 What about the tickets ? I've already bought them . 
 It is really exciting news . 
 You don ’ t know ? The company is going to replace these old computers with the latest ones . 
 We will all get a docking station on our own desk from which you can remove your laptop easily . And if you come back to office , you just reconnect your laptop with docking station . 
 This is a kind of socket mounted to your desk . The socket has all the wire connections of the company line and all the other office automation equipments , like fax , copier , a screen , printer and scanner , and it will be very convenient . 
 Mary , I have something to tell you . 
 I ’ m afraid you ’ ll become angry . But I think I must tell you . 
 John made out with other girls at the party yesterday . 
 Sure ! What exactly do you have questions about ? 
 Well , let me take a look at my grade book . How do YOU think you are doing ? 
 Well , your scores show that you could do a little better . What do you think you could improve on ? 
 Fine ! Please remember that regular attendance is the most important way to begin . 
 I'm sure you'll do fine . 
 That's fate . 
 Maybe this is God's will . 
 good morning , Gav ! Did you sleep well last night ? 
 that's great news ! You look much more relaxed than you did yesterday . 
 what's that ? 
 that's annoying , but nothing to worry about . 
 just breathe deeply when you feel yourself getting upset . 
 is there anything else bothering you ? 
 do you have any other plans this weekend ? 
 try not to take on more than you can handle . 
 Do you want to hear a funny joke ? 
 Well , you'll see . 
 OK , an Englishman , a Scotsman , and an Irishman were going on a trip across the desert , and they could only take one thing with them . 
 So they met up at the start of the journey and showed each other their equipment . 
 Hang on , I haven't finished yet . 
 Well , as I was saying , they showed each other what they had decided to bring . The Englishman had brought some water . " If we get thirsty , we'll have something to drink , " he said . The Scotsman brought a map . " If we get lost , we'll be able to find our way . " The Irishman had brought a car door . 
 Yep . A car door . " Why the door ? " the others asked him . " Well , " he said , “ If it gets hot , we can open the window . " Do you get it ? 
 Have you ever run into a person who tries bleed you white ? 
 I hear that some guys splash all their money about on them . 
 I ’ m sorry , Sam . I don ’ t want to foc-concert . 
 I don ’ t like going to the theatre . 
 traveling , swimming , going to the cinema . And you ? 
 I like talking to you too . 
 That ’ s a good idea . 
 Young people enjoy pop songs more . 
 But you don't have such a problem as to pop songs . 
 Well , the first year of our marriage , we had great difficulty getting along . The things that are important to me are not important to him . We had a lot of conflicts . 
 And now we have a two-year-old boy . We ’ re very happy that he ’ s healthy and smart . 
 Right now he speaks mostly Chinese , and he can say a few English words . But he will learn . 
 Yes , people surely can . He ’ s whiter than the Chinese kids , and his hair is a little blonde . My husband says his eyes are very Chinese though . 
 Thank you . I am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . You know information and knowledge in this field update very fast . 
 Yes , according to the agenda , there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course . 
 I will do my best . 
 Yeah . Well it's quite some days since we were together last summer.How is everything going ? 
 Congratulations ! 
 The ceremony will begin at 9 0 ' clock . After the ceremony , there's a reception . By the way , do you know why they have chosen September 9th for their wedding ceremony ? 
 As in English , Chinese also has some lucky numbers . The number 9 stands for perpetuity in Chinese . 
 Oh , Mike . How are you doing ? 
 Well , I prefer yogurt to all the other drinks . Have you ever tried a kind of yogurt with old milk in it ? It tastes great and very healthy too . 
 Why don ’ t you go ahead of me ? I have more items than you . 
 You ’ re welcome . It was good seeing you again . 
 Does your country export a lot of natural resources ? 
 Which resources do you have to import ? 
 I heard that you country recently discovered deposits of precious stone . 
 If your government invests in your country ’ s infrastructure , it will be money well spent . 
 Have you seen any good movies lately ? 
 Why ? You were a real movie buff when you were a student . 
 Mandy , Would you like to come for dinner tonight ? 
 At the new Five Spices restaurant in Chaoyang . 
 It ’ s Asian fusion . I heard it ’ s delicious . 
 Bob is really disturbed these days . 
 But we cannot talk like elders . 
 How was the movie last night ? 
 Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography . 
 She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see . 
 Nothing is to your satisfaction . 
 It's us . 
 Well , you always say you're busy . 
 And you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself . 
 Oh I remember , I cut terrible calls , and you didn't say anything about it . 
 Totally not . Perhaps it's about our marriage . 
 Yes , we're all proud of her ! 
 Cheers ! 
 So ? 
 You mean finally Henry bought the broken car himself . 
 Do you have any plans for tomorrow night ? 
 Sure . What movies were you thinking about going to ? 
 Yes . Isn't the director of that movie the same guy who directed Shaun of the Dead ? 
 To be honest , I didn't really like Shaun of the Dead . Besides , I like movies with a happy ending best . 
 I was thinking of seeing You , Me and Dupree . It's a typical Hollywood blockbuster . 
 Yeah , I suppose you wouldn't want to see that , huh ? 
 It depends on who the film is about . Which movie did you have in mind ? 
 That sounds fantastic ! What time is it playing ? 
 Great . Shall I meet you there around 7 forty-five tomorrow night ? 
 Didn't Joe feel it a shame to live on his parents since he has graduated from college ? 
 If I were him , I wouldn'tbrazen it outby asking my parents for money . 
 Hey , Ray , what are you doing right now ? 
 Yes , I do . I ’ m at home myself right now with nothing much to do . 
 Well , we could go to a movie . Have you see Shrek 2 ? 
 Hmm ... I ’ Ve seen that , too . We could go for a walk in the park . 
 I guess that ’ s out . Why don ’ t we go shopping ? 
 Ok . I guess we ’ d be not do that , either , then . What do you want to do ? 
 I would like to , but I injured my wrist last weekend . 
 That sounds interesting , but I can ’ t drink alcohol with the medicine I ’ m taking . 
 I don ’ t have a car . 
 No . do you have a car ? 
 Oh , good . Why don ’ t you take the bus to mine and we could play Mah Tiang ? 
 Not yet . I ’ ll cook dinner and have it ready by the time you get here . 
 Huh ? We are going to play for money , aren ’ t we ? 
 Hey ... as long as I ’ m not alone on a Saturday night , I don ’ t really care what I do ! 
 Bye ! 
 Yes , it is . 
 No , she ’ s average . 
 They ’ re dark gray . 
 It ’ s blond . 
 I don ’ t know . 
 My father failed in business . 
 Maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced . 
 No , not now . I have found a part-time job . So perhaps I can help my family to come over the difficulties . 
 Thank you . 
 Thank you . 
 She has been admitted to Yale with a scholarship . 
 Thank you . 
 To Australia . I'm going to visit my uncle in Brisbane for three weeks . 
 By air , of course . It takes over two weeks to go by sea . 
 Why ? Did you feel frightened ? 
 What did the pilot do ? 
 Did you land safely ? 
 I heard you are going out with John ? 
 You are so lucky . 
 Why ? Are you kidding me ? A guy like that is hard to find . Few boys are so caring , so patient , and did I mention he is hottie ? 
 Totally . I am saying it from the bottom of my heart ! And it's obvious that he ’ s head over heels in love with you , too . 
 I heard a rumor this morning ... It seems Trusten Tools is going out of business.Another competitor is going bankrupt.That could be good news for us . 
 What ? We are merging with Trusten ? I never thought that would happen.Will we be getting new owners ? Will it affect our jobs ? 
 Wow , with such a big change.We won't have the same name ? 
 Well , I'm thinking of going to see the ballet Swan Lake by the famous Russian National Ballet Troupe this evening at Beijing Grand Theater . Why don't you join me ? 
 You always work too hard , Jim . As the saying goes , all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy . You should spare some time for a rest . 
 Just take it easy . Come on with me . 
 Is your father in the habit of having naps ? 
 Don't you feel dizzy when you have to get up ? 
 so nice to see you again , Louise . How are you doing ? 
 Not too bad . 
 You look great ! However , I think you are a little over dressed for dinner . 
 Yes , but not the Ritz Carlton , the " Ritz " is a pizza place with peanut shells on the floor . 
 I'll wait right here for you Superman . 
 Can we go to the Carlton next time and can you wear that fabulous suit ? 
 What did he aim at ? 
 How could he have such an ill intention ? I think your father can see that through . 
 Are you sure ? He is quite young , isn't he ? 
 Really ? He looks so young . 
 Really ? My name is Gretchen Hammer . What is your name ? 
 Jacob Hammer . He is originally from Holland . 
 It's really a small world , isn't it ! The Hammer family isn't very big . 
 I always make time for family . 
 How do you pay for it ? 
 Tell me if you need help . 
 Okay.But our baby has fallen sleep . 
 But where's the switch ? 
 London is such a historic city ! There ’ s history everywhere you look . There ’ s nelson ’ s column , built as a monument to one of the Britain ’ s great admirals and his important victory . He won the battle of 
 Nearby , on the banks of the thames , there ’ s the statue of Boadicea . She fought the Romans when they invaded Britain . 
 She was a very controversial leader . Are we going to visit the famous tower of London later ? 
 I ’ m looking forward to seeing the famous castle and prison . Many historic figures were imprisoned there in the past . I really want to see the crown jewels too . 
 Where ’ s that ? Oh , I know ! Madame Tussaud ’ s the waxworks museum . 
 Sometimes , it ’ s hard to know who belongs in each section of the museum ! 
 It ’ s all my faults . I forget where I put it . 
 That's true . Her husband is a fat cat . 
 She is only after his money . 
 But many girls nowaday do want to marry a man filthy with dough . 
 So what ? 
 Wow , I like concerts . 
 No , have they have another fight ? 
 You must be joking.Those two . 
 So when did this happen ? 
 Well , I believe it now , and when are they are getting marry ? 
 I can hardly believe it . 
 The reason is that he once was bitten by a dog . 
 I think the government needs a radical plan to improve things . The government just talks , but in the long run , nothing is done to improve the economy . 
 Well , income taxes were decreased last year in hope to give the economy a boost , but I think it's backfired . The immediate effect of the tax reduction was to cause inflation to rise . 
 I have a good solution ... We need some new blood ! We should get rid of this president and boat in some new leaders ! 
 Thank you . My wife would be very happy to hear this . 
 You bet . 
 What happened ? 
 That's serious . 
 So now Mexican pesos are worth about half as much . 
 Wow . I feel sorry for the Mexicans . But it's good for us . 
 Yes , and you know what ? 
 I don't really like this hotel that much.So tonight , now that we are so rich , tonight why don't we stay in the most expensive hotel in town ? 
 You are starting to learn English ? 
 You ’ re lucky you start to learn it so easily . I learned English very late , and learned it all by myself . At that time we didn ’ t have a good English studying environment . I have to keep my dictionary on hand . 
 I spend all my time looking after my baby . I'm so tired . 
 I've tried it , but he would have none of it . 
 What ’ s the matter ? What annoy you ? 
 I understand your feeling . When someone is feeling at loose ends , we may show mercy on him . This is what we call the " milk of human kindness " . 
 You've take the words out of my mouth . 
 Ha ha , right . Sounds to me like you ’ re more excited about the dumplings than seeing your Grandma . 
 Son , firecrackers aren ’ t toys.they ’ re dangerous ! 
 Whoa , don ’ t you remember ? Last year when I set off the firecrackers , you covered both your ears and hid behind your mother ? 
 Ahahah ... really ? 
 Hey , I offered last year ... 
 Hi , Tom . You forgot to put on your sports shoes ! It's Games Day today ! 
 Let me give you a hand . You are carrying so many books . 
 Have you forgotten the cheers ? 
 That's good ! 
 That's my cousin Hubert . He likes smiling . 
 Sure , he's ready to be friendly with anyone . 
 Excuse me.What did you say ? 
 That's incredible . I cann't believe it . 
 How amazing ! 
 I am worried . 
 My exam . 
 I feel very nervous about it . 
 What do you think of the way people use and treat animals ? 
 Perhaps people should stop eating animals . We could grow more crops . 
 We could provide them with better conditions anyway . We should certainly try to improve the conditions at zoos . We should try to recreate the natural conditions as much as possible . 
 I agree . I ’ m an adult and I love going to the zoo . I don ’ t like animals experiments though . I believe that we can do tests in other ways . 
 That ’ s good news . The good thing is that most people treat their pets well . 
 Have you every given money to any of the charities that take care of animals . 
 It's said you will go abroad to pursue your graduate studies . 
 Which country do you want to go to ? 
 Were I in your position , I ’ d go to America . 
 There are many universities for you to choose from . Some famous universities such as Harvard , Yale , the University of Michigan , and Massachusetts Institute of Technology are really wonderful places to study , but they are very competitive and expensive . Some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper . 
 How's it going ? 
 So how long have you know Jack ? 
 Really ? You guys must be really tight . 
 He seems sincere , and trustworthy . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Oh , my ! Really ? I never thought he would be like that . 
 So , can I trust him or what ? 
 But I need someone that I can count on for this job . 
 Come on you're confusing me.Give it to me straight . 
 Are you free this Saturday evening ? 
 Would you like to go to the concert with me ? 
 At our club . 
 At 7:30 p . m . 
 I'm so pleased that you can go . 
 Yes . I'd like to borrow these books . 
 Thanks . 
 What happens if I'm not finished with them in a month ? 
 OK . Thank you very much for your trouble . 
 You look tired . 
 Really ? How come ? 
 You shouldn't work so hard . 
 What do you mean ? 
 How do you like Korea ? 
 What part of the visit excited you most ? 
 Why ? 
 Yes , I think so . But there is also something terrible . 
 Sometimes the traffic is too busy . 
 How should I dress for the party ? 
 I love her so much , you know . I want to be alone . Please keep quiet . 
 Are you saying you saw an eagle ? There are no eagles here . 
 You must have seen some other kind of bird . 
 They have moved to Chicago . 
 Mr.Smith has changed his job . 
 We went to the coast . It's really a nice place for camping , really good time around the fire singing and dancing . 
 There were six of us . 
 Yes , we got wet through . But we still enjoyed ourselves . 
 Sure , I'm heading out myself . Enjoy your evening . 
 Thanks for the warning ! See you tomorrow ! 
 Where else haven't we been to yet ? 
 Sounds great ! How many kinds of folk collections do they have ? 
 Private collectors ! They must have excellent collections . I'II go and see each of them . What kinds of collections can I see ? Come on , don't keep me in suspense ! 
 Enough ! I can't wait anymore . 
 Number 7 and 9 of the Row 11 in the stalls , aren't they ? 
 What a nice theatre ! I guess it can seat hundreds of people . 
 Look . It's begin . 
 It's so interesting , I like it very much . 
 I appreciate what you have done for me.Everything I have seen here has left a deep impression on me . I really don't know how to express my thanks to you . 
 Will you be kind to say " Thank you " to Mr.Zhang and other friends for me ? 
 Of course , I will.Well , it's time for me to say goodbye.The plane will take off soon.Hope some day you will come to America for a visit . 
 Goodbye ! 
 Well , I wouldn't swim in it - but the water is much cleaner than it was a few years ago . 
 Yes , but it must be treated in an effluent treatment plant first . 
 This is very beautiful . Though I have to confess , I don ’ t know the first thing about farming ! 
 What was that ? 
 And that ? 
 What was that ? 
 You know what ? I don ’ t think I can hack it here out in the countryside . I ’ m going back to the city ! 
 Yes , sir ? 
 I used to play football regularly when I was at university.And I used to do athletics in the summer . 
 I was a runner_a long-distance runner . 
 No . I'm afraid I haven't had time since I got married . 
 Certainly , sir . 
 Thank you . I wasn't sure if it looked okay or not . 
 I'm glad that you think so . I thought it might be a bit too revealing . 
 I got it on sale down at the department store . 
 I was just there a couple of days ago . You know , you should go down there too . They have a lot of stylish clothes on sale . 
 Anything you want . They have both casual and formal styles . 
 That's a good idea . 
 Yeah , she has a lot of homework . 
 Right . So in some way we are happier . 
 Could you just hold this for me ? 
 Yes , but I've nearly fixed it . Just take it , will you ? 
 Sometimes I think television is too biased . None of them are completely objective . 
 Newspapers or the radio I guess . I just wish TV was more objective . 
 The internet's a lot worse . 
 There's no one moderating it . Anyone around the world can put information onto the net for anyone else to see . The information on the internet is mostly unsubstantiated and you can never know who has written it , or why . A lot of people get conned online . 
 I went to the doctor yesterday . 
 I said I had been to the doctor the day before . 
 He said I ' d got the flu . 
 He told me to stay in bed for ten days . 
 Yes , ten days . 
 You can say that again.The sun is shining and there is a pleasant breeze.It ' s so lovely . 
 That's correct . We have four seasons of spring . 
 Well , a lot of the games were pretty silly . I don't know how much it helped us to be a better team , but i think everyone had a good time . 
 Yeah , I guess you're right . I think the trust game was my favorite . I think in order to have a strong team , we've all got to learn how to trust each other more . 
 Beautiful weather , isn ’ t it ? 
 No , I ’ m on a vacation to see the famous Three Gorges . 
 Yes , it is . 
 I couldn ’ t agree more . 
 Tiffany , why are more and more people turning to the Web to find a mate ? 
 There are actually special sites for people looking to date within their specific ethnic group and age group . But how should you screen potential mates ? Do you suggest talking to them on the phone right away or communicating via e-mail ? 
 Can you give us any other safety tips for people pursuing relationships on the Net ? 
 Besides the growth of these matchmaker sites , do you have any stats on success rates ? Are people out there finding true and lasting love through the Internet 
 Do you have any successful stories to share ? 
 Isabelle , you know I'm not interested in fame . 
 You know I'm interested in teaching . I'm looking for jazz students ... 
 I know they're out there . I'll find them . 
 I think your speech was excellent . 
 Sure it was . 
 But you did it and did it well ! 
 He would get very angry if anyone criticized him . 
 If only he knew it . 
 It sounds cool . The rhythms look really difficult . 
 Well , black people are supposed to be great dancers . 
 Ha-ha ! You got me there ! 
 I won't do it again . Please forgive me . 
 What's the bonus like at your company ? 
 Six months ' salary ? Are you serious ? That's incredible ! 
 Hey , I know what that's like . I bought a BMW on my Visa card . Now the payments really hurt . 
 What did you buy ? 
 Health Monitor ? I read an article about that racket.They ' re overpriced to begin with ! Listen , if I were you , I'd let them take back their monitor and spend my money on something more practical . 
 No joke ! 
 OK , Ann , you spent quite a bit of time in Australia recently so why don't you talk about that ? 
 Mm-hm . How long were you there ? 
 Oh , OK . 
 So , did you , did you lose your finger ? 
 Almost . Ah , you're lucky . Um , it's funny , you go in the water and you worry about sharks , but not clams . 
 Will you be going back to Australia soon ? 
 Tom did me many favors . 
 I have just had my new paper published . 
 I'm going to Britain . 
 I have been accepted by Oxford University on PhD . 
 I really appreciate your kind words . 
 Thanks , Miss . Wang . 
 Really ? I've already opened it . Great ! And it is exactly after my fancy . Thank you very much . 
 I don't know . Who ? 
 The Canadian rock singer ? But I heard you had a part-time job yesterday . How did you see her ? 
 So you're a big fan , eh ? 
 And she was in a movie once again , right ? 
 What was your impression of her when you saw her in person ? 
 Did you take a photo with her ? 
 Crazy ! 
 I'm glad you came . I hope you enjoyed it . 
 I was wondering how you are going to calculate our final grades . 
 What counts the most ? 
 Do you grade on a curve or use percentages ? 
 What if we miss something ? 
 Will you tell us if we are failing during the year ? 
 Okay , show me your card hand . Here's mine . I have three Kings and a pair of Aces . 
 Thanks again for buying the tickets . That was the most exciting live concert I've ever seen . That silver electric guitar was really cool . 
 That , My Heart Will Go On . It warms my heart . you know , JanetJackson , Shanna Twain and Celine Dion are so very different . 
 Have you heard Maria Carey ? 
 Excellent . You can borrow my Janet Jackson's CD . It's her new one . 
 Why ? 
 Sarah . You look terrible . What's wrong ? 
 I'm so sorry to hear that . When did this happen ? 
 Is there anything I can do ? 
 I'm sure she knew you loved her . Did she pass away in the hospital ? 
 I'm sorry she's gone . 
 I think your grandmother would want you to think of all the good times you spent together . 
 When my grandmother passed away , I frequently visited her in the cemetery . I always talked to her . Even though she wasn't there , I somehow knew she heard what I said . 
 It looks like you haven't eaten anything all day . We should get you something to eat . 
 It will do you good to go out for entertainment at weekends.What kind of movie do you like best ? 
 Shall we go downtown for a movie this Friday evening ? 
 I'm not sure . Let me give a call to find out . 
 0kay . Dinner's on me . 
 Well , have you thought of getting an MBA ? I heard it does wonders in getting you to the top . 
 Nonsense ! The business schools measure your ability through a test called GMAT . 
 Graduate Management Admission Test , it contains three parts 
 Up to you , you could have a one on one session with a tutor or group sessions , you can also use free or private computer software . Going to church might help as well ! 
 Umm . . . That's the spirit ! 
 fine , thanks . How are you ? 
 oh , my lord . I haven't really started them . 
 I know but I was busy with my part-time job the last few days . 
 to be honest with you , Jason , I don't think I'm doing a very good job of balancing my schoolwork with my job . I'm always two steps behind . I've got to get back to the dorm and continue writing tha 
 This is the good life ! We have it good don ’ t you think ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 For example ? 
 I see . Yeah now that I think of it , I wouldn ’ t have gotten married if I hadn ’ t moved to this town and met Sally . 
 Well , I have no regrets ! 
 Would you like to go to the movies tonight ? 
 Well , we could see something different like a detective film . 
 How about a comedy ? 
 How about a love story then ? 
 What's you opinion ? 
 Really ? 
 No , but I can't imagine that a girl like you would wonder to see a war movie . 
 Okay ! What do you suggest ? 
 Is that so ? Why not ? 
 What's on ? 
 That sounds interesting . Which is the nearest ? 
 What time does it start ? 
 But we won't have enough time for dinner . 
 Ah ... I fancy going to the later show . 
 That's Okay , I think . 
 Her ex-boyfriend was terrible , but this new one is even worse ! 
 The man behind your mother must be your elder brother . 
 He looked his age . 
 See you . Have a nice day ! 
 What did you say ? 
 Who's your favorite singer ? 
 Hey , Ann . You don't have a pen , do you ? 
 Thanks . I don't suppose you have some paper , too . 
 Thanks so much . I owe you one . 
 Sorry , not yet ! can you help me to select the dress ? i don , t what i should wear to fit thinner party . 
 How about transom ? 
 Oh , i nearly forget it . 
 What's the matter with you , then ? You look miserable . 
 What do you mean by us ? 
 What do you mean ? We're talking now , aren't we ? 
 Yes . I remember.But we never used to argue.You used to think I was wonderful.Where are you going ? 
 I think it is time to study . Our chemistry exam is coming . 
 December 1st . 
 It seems to be from chapter six to chapter ten . 
 Why are you so pessimistic ? 
 I believe you can pass the exam with good preparation . Don't lose your heart . 
 Are you new here ? 
 Is this your first year in college ? 
 Which school ? 
 How do you like it here compared to PCC ? 
 Do you like it better here or at PCC ? 
 So , why did you leave PCC ? 
 I don't know what I can do now . I'm down and out . 
 I hope so . But I'm always caught short . 
 I was just about to go to bed when the telephone rang last night . 
 Kate . She said she was too excited to go to sleep . 
 It ’ s true . Guess what we were talking about last night . 
 Yeah , how do you know about that ? 
 if you can choose , will you marry a foreigner or a Chinese ? 
 not yet . But I wonder if I can get my parents ’ consent . 
 you are right . It is giving me a real headache . I feel like I ’ m between a rock and a hard place . 
 oh , how did you deal with it ? 
 oh , it ’ s a pity . What was the matter ? 
 like what ? 
 Oh , I see . In their culture women should put family first . 
 so that's why it ’ s hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner . 
 I don't know how to adjust my life . Would you give me a piece of advice ? 
 Yes , I can't sleep well every night . 
 I drink a lot of wine . 
 I often feel so tired . 
 I sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me . 
 Hi Joe . You met my new assistant , right ? 
 You are kidding , but she's so helpful . 
 Come on . She's like that with everyone . 
 Hey , you , pick up that piece of garbage ! 
 Yeah , you . I just saw you throw a piece of garbage on the ground . Can't you read the No Littering sign ? It's a $ 500 penalty for littering , so go pick it up and put it in the garbage can over there . 
 Because this is a public place , and I want to spend my time here without having to look at your garbage . 
 It's not the cleaner's responsibility to pick up after lazy people . It's part of your responsibility to make sure that the place is neat for other people . If everyone thought like you , there'd be garbage everywhere ! The cleaners can't be everywhere ! 
 Hold on , that's an item . You should put that in the recycle bin next to the trashcan . 
 I don't have any plans . 
 Well , yes , I ’ d like to , if it ’ s not too much trouble . 
 That ’ d be fine . 
 I've never really thought about it before . I guess it doesn't bother me . 
 I guess so . I usually buy name-brand clothing , shoes , and electronic goods . How about you ? 
 I know that advertisers are experts at persuading people to spend their money , I think brilliant items are usually higher quality than ~ grounds . 
 Do you have a brand preference for anything ? 
 What do you think about the " impossible is nothing " billboard on the high street ? 
 I think it's a brilliant advert ! It really grabs my attention ! 
 Did you see the fashion awards last night ? 
 Not interested ? 
 But they are showing what will be all the rage next year . 
 Did you know that fashion is cyclical ? 
 Precisely ! For example , Flares were popular for a while , then went out of fashion . Now we can start to see them coming back in again . 
 They're also known as bell-bottoms . They are a type of trousers . 
 That's fine , but then you'll always look plain . 
 That ’ s really a good phenomenon to see . 
 Betty was in hospital . 
 She suffers from cancer . 
 Do you have any plan on your mind ? 
 How are we going there , by bike or by bus ? 
 Maybe we all will be all things to all men . 
 But for the life , we'll be changed by this society . 
 Don't be silly . We have reached the age to take the responsibility by ourselves . 
 You're late . 
 My phone ? 
 Really ? I had no idea . Let me check.Yes , it's dead . There's no dial tone . 
 But this is terrible . I'm expecting important calls . 
 You know what.The theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play.They are supposed to call me this evening.If I don't have a phone . Oh , what can I do ? 
 Do you have a cell phone ? 
 Can you drive me ? I will go to Ann's house . It isn't far . I can call the theater guild from there and give them her number.She will let us wait in her living room . 
 Yes , I do.At Ann's house I will call the phone company and have them check my line.If they can fix it right away without coming to my house , then we'll just return here.But if not , I need to wait at Ann's house to talk with the theater guild.It ' s very important to me . 
 Yes , let's go . 
 I'd like to very much . 
 Who's playing ? 
 Do you know what they are playing ? 
 And who is directing ? 
 I am unsure how to add a class and need help . 
 Yes , I have an add sheet . 
 No , I'm not sure . 
 Thanks . I understand what to do now . 
 That sounds good . 
 I found out when Jim's birthday is . It's this Friday . 
 Can you spread the word and ask everyone to bring some kind of snack food ? 
 Will you call his wife and let her know so that if she is available , she can come too ? 
 I don't know how old he is though . 
 In spring , people are feeling refreshed . They take off their heavy winter clothes and walk with a straight back and light steps . They feel they are full of spirits and energy . 
 Well , when summer comes , the weather is hot and the leaves turn darkgreen ; the sun is blazing and the air is threatening . No one would like to stay in the open air for long . 
 I myself like very much to listen to the singing of some of the insects , especially the singing of cicadas . 
 And you can hear singing and laughing everywhere ! People are happy in autumn because autumn brings them harvest and richness and prosperity ! 
 Well , it's hard to say . For the fields and rivers , winter is a relaxing season , but for farmers , I think they might take a rest physically , but mentally they are still busy thinking , planning and calculating for the working of the next year . 
 Hey Sarah , are you all right ? You look upset . 
 What happened ? 
 Who was chairing the meeting ? 
 Well , I can tell you from experience that Bob might come off a little strong sometimes . 
 What was the meeting about ? 
 It's ironic that the meeting was anything but efficient . 
 You have to keep things short and sweet . When you get a chance to speak , try not to get into too many unnecessary details . 
 You can always bring up the main points during the meeting and speak to those who are directly involved after the meeting . Not everyone needs to know all that information . 
 Let's go to the cinema tonight , shall we ? 
 What about ' Farewell My Concubine ' ? I've been wanting to see it for a long time . 
 My brother has offered me two tickets for this evening . 
 At eight thirty . 
 OK , I'll be waiting . 
 It would be very hard work . Are you sure ? 
 Running a farm would be totally different to you current job . 
 You ’ d need a lot of training before becoming a farmer . It ’ s not something you can just walk into . 
 Well , I ‘ d certainly come and visit you . It would be great to take a working holiday on a farm . I ’ d love to get away from hustle and bustle of the city for a while . 
 Yes , sir . 
 Excuse me , sir . This air compressor doesn't work . 
 Yes , I have . 
 Thank you . 
 Really ? When did that happen ? 
 Have they set a date for the wedding ? 
 Oh man ! I ’ Ve been starving myself for days now and I haven ’ t lost an ounce ! 
 Yeah , my friend is getting married next month and I ’ m supposed to be a bridesmaid . I have to fit into my dress and look nice for her wedding , but I haven ’ t lost any weight ! Look at these love handles . 
 Why ? If I eat less , then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves , right ? 
 So you are saying that I should eat , but I should just watch what I eat ? 
 If I do all this do you think I can lose twenty pounds in four weeks ? 
 Do you know that song ? 
 The song you hear now . 
 Elvis Presley . Don't you recognize his voice ? 
 Good idea . 
 Fine . 
 Oh , I have been with my uncle for a week . 
 He is an accountant . I have been helping him for a week . 
 Yeah . How are you these days ? 
 What did you do this weekend , Kate ? 
 That sounds nice . Where did you go ? 
 Not really . I just worked on my car all day . 
 But then what would I do every weekend ? 
 So soon . Why don ’ t you stay a little longer ? 
 Oh . It ’ s pity you have to leave . 
 I'm glad you enjoy it . 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry . It completely slipped my mind . 
 Definitely , I ’ m really sorry . 
 But I ... I don't agree with that , because computers weaken kids ' ability to think , because kids don't learn basic skills . 
 They can't spell , they can't add , they can't subtract , they even don't remember any more.that ' s because they rely on gadgets . 
 All right . But these are black and I don ’ t like black shoes . They ’ re dull . 
 Then why are you wearing black shoes ? 
 Hey , thanks , mum . 
 Sure , what's up ? 
 Good question . I have to think about it . 
 France ? Is he crazy ? 
 Well , how do I put this ? France is a terrible team . 
 Nice to meet you . 
 I ’ m Rose Teller . I think I ’ Ve seen you somewhere before ? 
 Yes , I was . You work for 3M , right ? 
 Good . 
 I ’ m a fashion designer . Next month , I have a fashion show . I ’ d love it if come . I can get you a couple of tickets . So you can bring a friend if you like . 
 Thank you . 
 Doctor Butcher . 
 No , not at all.it ' s about how to keep fit . 
 That ’ s the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter , I think . 
 It ’ s approximately 3.14 , but the number continues forever . What ’ s the diameter of your circle ? 
 Ok . My next problem is to convert 10000 british pounds into us dollars . What ’ s the exchange rate at the moment ? 
 That means that 10.000 pounds will buy me 18.500 dollars . 
 Fractions . What ’ s a quarter and an eighth ? That ’ s three-eights . Easy . The next question is “ what are prime numbers ? ” . 
 So , 1,2 and 3 are prime numbers , but 4 isn ’ t because 2 * 2 = 4 . 
 How many seconds in an hour ? 60 seconds multiplied by 60 minutes equals 3600 seconds altogether . 
 How's your new car ? 
 You made a good choice , then ? 
 No regrets ? 
 I'm glad you're so happy . 
 Thank you.Steven.That was the most magnificent meal I've had abroad.You ' ll have to let me reciprocate the next time you're in Beijing . 
 We don't . 
 At hotels and some restaurants they add a service charge to the bill , but other than that , tipping isn't customary . 
 In a cab you just pay what it says on the meter . I generally tip hotel porters 10 yuan per bag , but in first-class hotels they're instructed not to accept gratuities . 
 Morning , Mary . I haven't seen you in a long time . What's up ? 
 So you don't travel a lot now ? 
 It's certainly a popular hobby . I know a lot of people love stamps . 
 I believe collecting stamps has something similar to traveling right ? 
 Well , every stamp has a story to tell . 
 Good . 
 There's a lot to share when you have a common interest . 
 Ok , good luck . See you 
 I am in hot water now , all the things seem to be blown up . 
 Thank you for encouraging me . There are problems cropping up here and there . But I will over come them one by one . 
 It sure is.The Grand Canyon is truly masterpiece . No man could ever make anything like this . 
 It is the Colorado River . You will go down the river in a boat if you wish . 
 There is a beautiful state park here . I can see why so many people come out here to camp . 
 It definitely is a nice change from the polluted and crowded city . 
 Our neighbour ’ s tape recorder is so loud that it annoys us to death . I ’ Ve made up my mind to cut the electricity off . 
 Then what shall I do ? 
 David , what's new with you ? You are not in the mood . Can you tell me ? 
 Do not take things so seriously , my pal ! Every one of us will face the trouble and job-hunting is inevitable . Take it easy ! Believe in yourself and some day you will be successful . 
 What's the matter ? You don't look well . 
 What about ? 
 Oh , is that all ? 
 Don't worry about it . Try to look on the bright sight of things . 
 I didn't make the soccer team . 
 Jenny , you look terrible . What's eating you ? 
 Hey , Chillon , I'm just trying to help . 
 So , what's the problem ? 
 No kidding ! Didn't you study for it ? 
 That's too bad , anyway , I'm sure things will turn around next master . 
 You can't do that , Jenny ! 
 Come on , let's talk about it . 
 No , I can't agree with you . She's one but not the other . 
 She's my wife , you know . 
 No , what's up ? 
 You're joking ! 
 David , why didn ’ t you clean the room ? 
 Why are you feeling depressed ? 
 I don ’ t think she will do such a thing . 
 Oh , cheer up . A girlfriend is not everything . 
 Then forgive her mistake . 
 Betty , would you please read this letter of application I've just written ? I'd like to have your opinion . 
 Good ! I'm interested in your advice . 
 Good idea , Betty . What would you think about the second part ? 
 You're right , I'll change it . How about the last part ? 
 I agree . I appreciate your helping me . 
 It's hard to believe that we're really leaving . The past two weeks was like a dream . 
 And the people were so friendly ! 
 Do you still remember the small restaurant at the corner of the street ? 
 I ate so much that I wasn't hungry until afternoon the next day . 
 Maybe we can come here again next summer . 
 Hey , what's the time ? 
 Don't worry . We can call a cab . It'll be alright . 
 No , they live in Shanghai , my hometown . 
 Once a year . 
 I missed it . I watch a live show of a concert . 
 Love Music Woman 
 Wow , what a lovely cake . 
 Oh , they all went out ! Did you make a wish ? 
 Better luck this time . 
 What is it ? 
 Do you mean you want to sell up your company of your own ? 
 That ’ s not a bad idea . Bet after all you should get some sound financial guarantee . 
 Summers is hot and usually lasts a long time . Winters are short , but cold , wet , and windy . I love the summers in my city , but I hate the wintertime . 
 We usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks , but apart from that , summers are dry . Thunderstorms make the air fresh again , so most people don ’ t mind then . 
 I like spring because flowers bloom and trees grow leaves again . In spring , the weather is very changeable-sometimes cold , sometimes warm . It ’ s usually windy with some rain . Autumn is usually sunny an 
 Do you usually go on a summer holiday ? 
 I usually go on holiday during the spring or the autumn . I try to go somewhere where the weather is more reliable than in my city . 
 oh . 
 sure . 
 the train ? Will I be flying back then ? 
 will the train be very crowded ? 
 when is the first meeting then ? 
 where will I be staying ? 
 that's very sensible . Would it be alright if I left early today to prepare for the trip ? 
 what ? How could you forget to reserve the concert tickets ? 
 How could you ? I reminded you just this morning . 
 I have been looking forward to this performance all month . 
 Say , Jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ? 
 What do you mean ? It will help us to relax . 
 I guess you are right . But what shall we do ? I don't feel like sitting at home . 
 That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play singsong . Perhaps we can make a foursome with them . 
 Good . Let's go now . 
 Have you heard anything about Markweed Inc . ? They have called me back for interview , and I'm considering taking a job with them . 
 The best ... huh ? With so many companies out there , how did they establish themselves in such a solid position on top ? 
 Really ? What about the pay rate ? Are the wages pretty high ? 
 Well , what about the work environment ? Not every one is motivated solely by money . 
 Terrible . How about people's lives ? 
 That's great . It seems that Typhoon is not as bad as earthquake . 
 That's why many people died in the earthquake . 
 Oh , China does have been plagued by numerous destructive earthquakes during its long history . 
 We're all familiar with natural disasters . but we still feel weak when we face Wenchman earthquake . 
 That's the point . Love among human beings is not limited by geography . 
 You can renew the books over the computer . 
 I always feel I ’ m left high and dry with nobody to rely on . 
 I appreciate your kindness . 
 Yes , I played with Tony and John . 
 We all went swimming . 
 No , we aren't . We're going to help Mr Smith to plant some flowers . 
 Yes , we are . We can neither play football nor do our homework today . 
 Yes , we certainly are . But Mr Smith is going to pay us for all the work we'll do . 
 Hi , Malia ! What a nice home ! 
 How long have you lived here ? 
 Well , it is very beautiful . 
 Good ! I am really thirsty . You know it really is hot outside ! 
 Mango juice would be perfect . Thank you ! 
 There is some , but my country is not amongst the leading producers . The oil and coal deposits are in the north of my country . Your country is a big oil producer , isn ’ t it ? 
 We have some too . Do you have a lot of coal ? 
 There are a few in my country . We have deposit of gold , but they are very small . 
 That ’ s right . A few people go panning for gold in rivers . 
 It ’ s a natural resources that we hardly use . Government policy is to conserve those forests . 
 Is your country ’ s environment being damaged by the oil industry ? 
 Don't you have too much to do with him . 
 His father is a prisoner . 
 ORG ! It must be so late where you are . What time is it ? 
 what's wrong ? Can't sleep ? 
 really ? What is it ? 
 I can't believe it ! Is it real ? You're moving here ? 
 just give me the dates and I'll make sure I'm free . You know after all these chatting online , it will be great to meet you in real life . I look forward to seeing you soon ! 
 thanks . This is so exciting . Sleep tight and sweet dreams ! 
 You really should stop smoking , you know . 
 How many cigarettes do you smoke a day ? 
 Wow . You ’ re really a heavy smoker . 
 He died of lung cancer , right ? 
 Why are you so rude to your wife ? 
 But she means to help you , not to trouble you . 
 OK , Hello ! 
 Hi , what's your name ? 
 Nandu . Nandu , how do you spell you name ? 
 Oh , OK . That's a nice name , Nandu . And where are you from ? 
 Be quiet , Will you ? 
 I have to miss school next week . 
 Unfortunately , this is what I have to do . 
 I've got it all covered . 
 Don't worry , this will be the last class I miss . 
 I'll remember . 
 There will be a party in my company ; what shall I wear ? 
 I guess it is a formal one because the general director will give a speech there , and most of the staff will take part in . 
 You are right . What about shoes ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 How do you think about our boss ? 
 Yes , I think he's the most relaxing person in management . 
 That's good . Maybe you'll get promoted . 
 Well , no one could survive without water , but you see pollution has been making more and more water unable for drinking . 
 But what are the sources of water pollution ? 
 Well , direct ones are the pollution directly from factories , refineries waste treatment plants etc . , aren ’ t they ? 
 But what about the indirect ones ? 
 I see . For the sake of us all , we should be an active participator in the prevention of it . 
 I'm tired of dancing . 
 Maybe it's because you always have pretty girls as your partners . 
 I ’ m sick of my job , I always have to work late at night , and the company keeps me working in the office . 
 What do you suggest ? I can ’ t afford to quit my job until I get a new one . 
 I just dropped in to say good-bye . 
 I'm going to try to leave by ten . 
 Good-bye . Hope to see you soon again next year . 
 David , recently I established a travelling forum , and now I want to make a plan to hold the first activity . Where can we go for this time ? 
 a dozen . 
 It's surely worth going to . There are ten famous spots there . 
 Inform my members to prepare for the travelling . And then we can discuss about the travelling costs . 
 When is the last time you talked to you parents ? 
 Are you going to see them soon ? 
 OK . And who are you more like , your mother or your father ? 
 We have to pick up Conrad before the party . 
 We're supposed to meet him at Cal's Bar at 10 
 Yes . 
 Yes , it is . Conrad is gay . Didn't you know ? 
 Why not ? We're supposed to meet him there . 
 Why should he do that ? It isn't illegal for us to go in . 
 You sound like you're afraid . 
 You've never been in a gay bar before ? 
 But it's just a bar . There's no danger.You shouldn't be so homophobic . 
 Listen . If you refuse to go in , Conrad will be offended.You don't hate gay people , do you ? 
 Don't worry about it . There is nothing strange about it.If Conrad's there , we'll leave for the party.If he's not , we'll sit down and have a drink . 
 I'm glad you feel that way.We ' ll leave in about ten minutes , alright ? 
 Are these your triplets ? They ’ re beautiful ! I ’ Ve seen other babies who were nothing but skin and bones at their age . You know , they ’ re absolutely identical of you and John ! Are you planning on having any more ? 
 Well , tell me . How was the labor and delivery ? 
 Well , hang in there . In twenty years , you ’ ll fell it was well worth it ! 
 Yep . The steaks and chicken are marinated and I also bought hamburger buns . 
 Yeah , good idea.We can put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill . I also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot . 
 This is gonna be a great barbecue ! 
 It ’ s still touch and go . We don ’ t see how she can make it . 
 It's a fine day today , isn't it ? 
 How nice seeing the sun back again ! The air is so fresh . 
 Well , the weather is so unpredictable this time of year . 
 Look ! It looks as if it is going to rain . 
 The weather is often quite different from the weather forecast . 
 Good morning ! Can you help me , please ? I'm looking for some books for my mother . 
 She's very fond of detective stories ? 
 Oh , yes ! 
 I'm not sure , but she probably won't remember if she has ! She's very forgetful ! 
 She's eighty-seven . 
 Thank you . That's a good idea.she likes exciting books . Can you suggest another one ? 
 No , you don ’ t have to . But I think you ought to . 
 How many people are in your family ? 
 I have one daughter and one son . Then there ’ s my husband and I . What about your parents ? Do they live with your family ? 
 My parents live by themselves now . when they get older , they ’ ll probably go to a retirement home . Do you just have one brother ? 
 I also grew up in a big family . I have one older brother and three younger sisters . 
 About seven years now . and you ? 
 It ’ s becoming more and more common . However , I don ’ t ever want to get divorced myself ! What about you ? 
 If that happens , maybe you could marry my brother and we could become in-laws ! 
 Of course not ! 
 Yeah , I think it will be wonderful . 
 I love dogs . They have been used as guards for centuries . Nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers . 
 Horses are useful to people too . We use them for sports and recreation . 
 Can you ride a horse ? 
 I can ride too . Perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend ? 
 How's it going ? 
 To be honest , I'm a bit fed up . 
 There's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around . 
 Sure , but how ? 
 But for what reasons ? She doesn't even know who I am . 
 Easier said than done . 
 But I always get tongue-tied when I see her . 
 I see . I'll try . 
 It's too hot to read . 
 Which season do you like best ? 
 How about summer ? 
 Why ? 
 But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons . 
 I went to Croydon . 
 No , I went for an interview . 
 Yes , I got a job as a Management Trainee . 
 John hasn't got married up to now . 
 Really ? Does Mary know that ? 
 How silly John is . 
 Really ? Why would you worry about me ? I ’ m just fine . 
 No way ! I like my apartment , and I like to be independent . 
 Not at all . I see you and your family twice a week , and I enjoy seeing my own friends . I ’ m too busy to feel lonely ! 
 Lily broke up with me last week . In fact , she dumped me . 
 She said it was because we had very different ideas about life . 
 Of course not . I knew she had fallen in love with another guy . It is difficult to see her move on so quickly . 
 Thank you , Steven . You are really a good friend . 
 Yes , I do . 
 But I can't sing it well . 
 OK , I'Il go with you . When shall we go ? 
 It's too early . Let's make it seven , OK ? 
 You're being childish . Your nose will heal . And so will your pride , if you let it . 
 Don't know what ? 
 Is that right ? Like what kind of changes ? 
 Come on , grow up . Have you seen Vince around ? 
 What are you talking about ? 
 You said it . Many parents just don ’ t understand know how to educate their children . 
 Hello , Helen . This is John . How are you ? 
 Fine , thanks . I ’ ll have a party next Sunday at home . I ’ m calling to ask whether you can come or not . 
 Okay , now you are a famous star . 
 What ’ s wrong with you ? 
 Okay . 
 What time dose it start ? 
 Then we'd better get started . 
 OK , a moment , please . 
 For which one ? 
 Yes , of course . 
 Sorry . No . You should go to the other counter . 
 Sorry , this biography is over the deadline . You should pay extra for it . 
 3 Yuan , please . 
 You are welcome . See you next time . 
 Hello , my old friend . Long time no see . How are you doing ? 
 Not so well . To be honest with you , I broke up with Tom . 
 hi , come on in . Can I take your coat ? 
 you're the first guest to arrive . I'll just put your coat away and then I'll get you something to drink . 
 whatever you prefer . 
 just over three weeks . Would you like a drink ? 
 I've got white wine , red wine , gin and tonics , ginger ale , lemonade , orange juice , and sprite . 
 one glass of red wine coming up ! 
 there's just going to be 6 of us tonight . 
 Marcia and Paul called to cancel at the last moment . Paul was running late and Marcia wasn't feeling well . 
 I think there's someone at the door . 
 Do you mind if I come over to use your computer ? 
 Does that mean I can't use it tonight ? 
 Do you like plum blossoms ? 
 It's snowing heavily . What about taking a walk ? 
 What a heavy snow ! 
 I've got it . I like the sound of stepping on the snow very much . 
 Do you smell the sweet scent ? 
 The fragrance of plum blossoms comes from the hard coldness . 
 License and registration please . Have you been drinking tonight , sir ? 
 Step out of the vehicle , please . Sir , what do you have in the back ? 
 Don ’ t take that tone with me . Do you have an invoice for these items ? 
 You are under arrest , sir . You have the right to remain silent . You better not pout , you better not cry . Anything you say can and will be used against you . You have the right to an attorney . if you cannot afford one , the state will appoint one for you.do you understand the arrest to you ? 
 I hear you're going to Tainan to visit your uncle . 
 Well , say hello to him for me . 
 Well , the state will benefit a lot , I suppose . 
 Ah , it ’ s hard to say . 
 He's been out of work for a couple of days . 
 He has a bad cold . 
 Thanks . I'll tell him . 
 There will probably be a book list in the bookstore . Do you have your class schedule handy ? 
 To get started , take that list over to the bookstore . Do you know where the bookstore is ? 
 When you pass the gym , it'll be the first door on the left . Do you know how to sell your old textbooks for money ? 
 If you give your used textbooks to the person at the booth outside the door , he will reimburse you . Can you go over there today ? 
 I am free at 1 
 I'll catch you later then . Have a wonderful morning . 
 Thanks . I finally got rid of that old Nissan that got me through college . 
 No , it ’ s last year ’ s model . 
 $ 14,500 . It only has 10,000 miles on it , so it ’ s like a new car . 
 Well , sometimes , I think it ’ ll be nice to drive to work instead . We ’ ll see . Want to go for a ride ? 
 Come on . 
 I'd like to hire a bike . I think it would be a good idea to do some cycling on Sunday . 
 I am sure it will be . It's been good so far this weekend . 
 Thanks . That would be really helpful . 
 I wish the teacher wouldn't make us read this book . 
 Mr . Brown is in hospital again . 
 When I went to see him yesterday , he looked rather pale . 
 Someone ’ s told me behind closed door that he is very hot-tempered . 
 Really ? I hope to meet him soon . 
 I don't find it very exciting . 
 I can't wait ! 
 Nine ... but I'll be ten on May 1st.When is your birthday ? 
 Are you going to have a birthday party ? 
 Come in , come in , what can I do for you ? 
 Yes , I am applying on it . 
 Aren't you a bit young ? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up . 
 Well , if you think you are ready , I'll let you enroll . 
 Good evening , John . 
 How are you doing ? 
 Nothing special . 
 Sounds good.Sorry , here comes my bus.You call me , or I'll call you to make a date . 
 All right.Gotta go , bye , keep in touch . 
 How'd you like to go on a bungee jump this weekend ? 
 How about Sunday , then ? We could start in the morning . 
 Don't worry . It is a test of physical endurance , intelligence . Just to finish it is considered a victory for most . 
 I must apologize for having delayed the work . 
 But you will miss your good chance . I ’ m So sorry 
 Oh dear , my weight has gone up again . 
 And I suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office doesn't help . 
 I do wish I could lose weight . 
 I've tried diets before but they've never worked . 
 Yes , maybe I should . 
 Not bad . We had a get-together with friends from college . I haven't seen many of them since graduation . How about you ? 
 Sounds a good weekend . You know it always amazes me that two people as different as you and Jo can become such close friends . 
 That's great . I know people who can't stand each other for even five minutes . 
 It seems you two bring out the best of one another . 
 Yeah , you are so lucky to have found each other . 
 What ’ s the matter , Sally ? You look so unhappy . 
 What happened ? 
 Your bag ? Did you get it back ? 
 That ’ s too bad . I ’ m sorry to hear that . 
 I ’ m afraid I ’ m busy tonight . I ’ m having dinner with friends . 
 What about tomorrow ? Are you doing anything tomorrow ? 
 Shall we go out tomorrow then ? 
 Do you like a package tour or to travel alone ? 
 I prefer travel alone . I'll have a lot of time lingering at one place . 
 Thanks . 
 Actually , I could you some help . Thank you so much . 
 Sam , what shall I do with my stocks ? Will I lose money ? 
 What do you mean by that ? 
 Is that so ? 
 You should have seen the line at the housing office.It took me an hour to make my dormitory deposit for next year . Have you made yours yet ? 
 Why not ? There ’ s not much time left . Are you short of cash ? 
 You ’ d better hurry up if you wanna a dorm room next September ... 
 Do you have any idea how much that would cost ? 
 You should study in the library the way I do . Think of the money you ’ d save . 
 I hope you will have second thoughts . 
 I enjoyed myself , too . 
 Yes , if it's not too much of a trouble . 
 That's great . Let's go ! 
 Hello , Xu Hua . I'm Paula . I'm American . 
 Thank you . 
 No , not yet . Why ? 
 Oh . I am not his fan . 
 I don't recall . 
 Oh , it ’ s almost eleven twenty . 
 You ’ re welcome . The rain is quite heavy , isn ’ t it ? 
 I have one . We could share it . Which way are you going ? 
 I am going there , too . We can walk together . 
 We'd like to invite you over for dinner this Friday evening . Can you come ? 
 Yes . We hope you'll be able to join us . 
 Good ! 
 How about 6:00 ? 
 Isn't this lovely weather ? Will you help me water the flowers , Jack ? 
 I do.We haven't watered them for quite a few days . 
 Good.So we don't have to work.How nice ! 
 Why ? 
 Oh , I'm afraid all the flowers will die in the rain . 
 Yes I can . I speak it very well . 
 I lived in England when I was a child . 
 Well , I know a little Italian . 
 Those tow games are quite different . First , there ’ s the size of the teams . In football , a team has 11 players . In rugby there are 15 players on each team . The biggest difference is that in football , only the goalkeeper can use his hands . In rugby , the ball is usually carried forward by players , though kicking is permitted . 
 That ’ s right . However , players can only pass the ball backwards . They cannot pass the ball forwards to their team mates . That ’ s a foul . 
 If a team carries the ball over the goal line , they score points . A team can also score points by kicking the ball between two tall posts at each end of the pitch . 
 Yes . Players usually need to bring a player down to stop him from moving forward with the ball . This is called ” tackling ” , as in football . 
 Yes . It ’ s not perfectly round like a football . A rugby ball is oval in shape . There ’ s a match on TV this afternoon . Why don ’ t you watch it with me ? I ’ ll try to explain the rules and tactics while we ’ re watching . 
 What do you say to eating out , Maggie ? 
 Do we need to book a table in advance ? 
 What time shall we go ? 
 How do you like other films starring Charlie Chaplin ? 
 You don't like the performance , do you ? 
 Who's that striking woman over there ? 
 Really ? Why not ? She looks great . 
 Really ? Tell me more . 
 Wow , crikey . So what happened ? 
 Wow . 
 I have no idea what you're talking about . 
 Could you excuse me a moment ? I have to make a phone call 
 What is the movie you saw last night ? 
 How do you like it ? 
 But I heard the box office rose up to 15 million in the first week . 
 My sister has given me two tickets for tonight . It is called ' The life of Rose ' , a French movie . 
 It tells the lifetime of a lady singer from a beggar in the street to a famous singer in the world . It is a kind of tragedy . 
 Let's go . The time is coming . 
 Hi ! Peter . How are you ? 
 Pretty good . 
 I know . Maybe you will get the air if you go against her . 
 And it takes two to make an agreement too . You have no guts , I am afraid . 
 It ’ me . Susan Taylor 
 On , what ’ re you doing ? You look as busy as a bee . 
 Really , that ’ s cool . Let me see what you ’ Ve done . 
 That ’ s all right . Let me see , oh , that lace looks so unique , and it ’ s so creative to make a picture display here . How did you get that idea ? 
 Do you like music ? 
 Do you think the music is well-matched ? 
 How about the words of the song ? 
 I like it . Naturally it can arouse your feelings . 
 Of course , and I also like the rhythms . 
 Really . It's worth listening to and enjoying . 
 Hey , Wen ! Welcome to D . C . ! Glad you came out to visit ! 
 Howard is eighty percent black . But there are whites , and even Asians here . Thankfully , it's also coed . 
 Sorry , nope . But the Alpha Phi Alpha's are throwing a party tonight . 
 How could you handle living in such a big family ? Does everyone get along ? 
 In such a big family , there must be a head . Who's the head of your family ? 
 Is a family like yours common in South Korea ? 
 My family setup is a bit different . In New York city , there're only three people , my mother , my stepfather and me . During this summertime , I fly out to California and live with my dad . Dad's getting 
 To be blunt , maybe I won't be able to get along with his new wife or her kids . 
 But four boys ! 
 You are right , I guess.The world keeps changing , and so do families . But I like a small-sized or medium-sized family where everybody is equal to everybody else . That's what I want . 
 That's a great idea ! 
 That sounds like an excellent offer . I might take you up on that . Thank you for the wonderful invitation . 
 Hi , Peter . I didn't see you last night . Where did you go ? 
 Did you play network games the whole night ? 
 What are you going to do now ? 
 I'm going to have some people over for dinner Saturday night.Would you like to join us ? 
 Some other time then ? 
 Ma , I really don't know how to thank you . 
 It's most kind of you . 
 If there's ever anything I can do for you , Don't hesitate to let me know . 
 I'm most grateful . 
 You're acting weird tonight . 
 What brought this on ? 
 Hey , Mary , can you cut that out ? 
 The tapping of your pen on your desk . It ’ s driving me crazy . 
 I don ’ t slurp my coffee . And plus , how can you hear it when you ’ re shouting into your phone all the time ? 
 Look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it ’ s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . But , it ’ s probably not a good idea to keep it up I ’ m willing to forgive and forget and if you are . 
 Yeah , I ’ ll try to do the same.So , I was wondering you wanna go out to dinner Friday night ? 
 I don't think dieting is good for you . It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with ! 
 they need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though . 
 sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small desert . 
 many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be a treat ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . If you want to lose weight and you can't stop drinking soda , try 
 my mother used to make me take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start . 
 you might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size than I am now ! 
 Congratulations ! 
 No . But I am going to apply for some vocational schools . I like fashion design and want to study it . 
 John , if you don't mind , I'd like to ask you a personal question . 
 All right . Are you married ? 
 Then , when do you plan to get married ? 
 Bob , put on your shoes , your feet are really smelly . 
 But don't forget you are in a cafe . 
 I simply can't bear your barbaric behavior . 
 You should feel shameful for your behavior . 
 I'm really sick of you . 
 I'm planing to go bowling tonight . Tomorrow I was hoping to see a movie . What about you ? 
 Why not ? 
 She is kind of player who never hides how she's feeling . Once look at her and you know if she's winning or losing . 
 Good afternoon , Johnson . 
 Not bad , thanks . 
 that depends . What is it ? 
 I'd love to help you out , but I'm a bit short on cash this month as well . I had to get a new engine put into my car , and that ate up my savings . 
 let's see , I've got about $ 50 to get me through the weekend . I can only spare about $ 20 . I would give you more if I had it , I just don't have much money to my name right now . 
 that'd be great . Thanks ! What time should I come over ? 
 see you then ! 
 I'm sorry . Has it been bothering you ? 
 I'm sorry . I meant to ask you . 
 Why don't you run outside ? 
 Yeah , I suppose . I guess it isn't healthy to run in this weather . 
 Wait for me a minute . I'll go over to the gym too . 
 Yes , why not ? Just let me get my gym clothes together . 
 What do you mean by that ? Everyone can exercise ! 
 No , not at all . I was on the swimming team in high school.And I'd like to do some weight training . They have decent equipment at that gym . 
 Are you laughing at me ? 
 Maybe not . But I want to start . I need to get in shape . I feel these past couple months that my energy is low . 
 So I need to do something too . 
 I know . But I want to start today with a little weight lifting.Then I'm going to buy a new swimming suit and goggles , and every other day I'm going to go swim laps in the pool . How does that sound ? 
 What ? 
 The boss is mad at you . 
 Bob , what are you thinking about ? 
 When do you go ? 
 I have never seen so many flavors of ice cream in one place ! 
 Vanilla with toppings is my favorite . 
 No way ! Do you have a flavors you don't like ? 
 I agree with that , it just doesn't work for me . 
 I think that would be horrible ! 
 I heard that ben is forming his own band . 
 can you play a musical instrument ? If you can , he might ask you to join the band . 
 I wish I could play a musical instrument . I love music . 
 I'd love to try it.but the equipment is expensive and it was still take a lot of practice . 
 that ’ s a great idea . I ’ ll search for some information on the internet . If it ’ s possible to do , the internet will have some information about it . 
 Wow , what a great burd ! 
 She's a real turn-on our rights . 
 Yeah , I noticed . She must be really loaded . 
 Lucky her . Anyway , I think that is just as beautiful . 
 Well , that's my opinion . 
 Oh , there is no comparison . Now we are talking but ugly . 
 I'm going to America . 
 I hope before the end of the month . 
 Who is Cindy ’ s husband ? 
 How many children do Cindy and Ron have ? 
 Do they have any grandchildren ? 
 Does their daughters get along well with her in-laws ? 
 Do they have a large family ? 
 What do you think of doctor Thompson ? 
 How can you be so sure ? 
 Never believe his words . 
 I live in an apartment downtown . 
 Not much . But there is a lot of traffic . I can't stand the noise sometimes ! Where do you live ? 
 Oh , I bet it's really quiet . But is there much to do there ? 
 Hey . Let's trade places one weekend ! 
 I must be going now . 
 No , I really must go now . My family are expecting me home soon . 
 See you . 
 Fine , just fine . Thanks . 
 Well , as a matter of fact , I've got a lunch date with Bob Thomas . 
 You can say that again . 
 I agree ... 
 Just now we both thought it would be fine . 
 Believe me , you really look much better than before . 
 did you get my email ? 
 sure . 
 well , to be honest , nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss . 
 I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses . I spent half of the weekend on a train ! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets ! 
 I see . Well , then perhaps they could give me a few days off after a business trip . It was really tiring for me . 
 thank you . I can't imagine getting much done today . I'm just too exhausted ! 
 no , should I have ? 
 Is that the box-office ? 
 I'd like to book two tickets for the film ' Jane Eyre ' for this evening , please . 
 What a pity ! How about tomorrow evening ? 
 Wonderful , I'll take them . 
 Wang Min . Telephone number is 13811658 . Can I pick the tickets this afternoon ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 I'm glad you like it . 
 Not at all . 
 Oh , I'm glad . 
 No problem . 
 For what ? 
 If you don't know it by now , you might as well not bother studying . 
 My roommate invited both of us to dinner . 
 Yes ! The first time I saw her I knew we would fall in love . 
 It ’ s exactly twelve minutes past seven . 
 Begin at 9 o ’ clock sharp . 
 So you are . 
 I feel exactly the same way with you . 
 What ? You don ’ t love me ? Me , either . 
 No . 
 I know , I know . Well , is there some , is there someone else ? Oh , that woman on television , Sydney Ann . 
 Sure . 
 I don't mind helping . 
 So that's four plates , four forks , four knives , and four spoons ? 
 Don't be silly ! I know how to use knives and forks . 
 Until when ? 
 No problem . 
 What kind of movie is it ? I don ’ t like many of his movies , actually . 
 I like thrillers and I like Julia Roberts , so it might be interesting . I read a review today and the critic didn ’ t seem to be very impressed . 
 He didn ’ t say it was bad , but he said that it wasn ’ t as good as it could have been , particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it . 
 Good . Dinner is nearly ready and I ’ d like to watch the news before we go . The Oscars were last night and I want to see the results . 
 Do you have the five dollars I lent you yesterday ? 
 You don't have to go right away . 
 What are your hobbies , Mr . Green ? 
 But it's an expensive hobby , isn't it ? 
 I usually play chess with my friends . But I like playing basketball best . 
 No , I'm not very good at it . I play just for the fun of it . 
 OK , that'd be very nice . 
 Great , the lamb stew tastes incredible . 
 Yes , the food here deserves its reputation . Chinese food is one of my favorites 。 
 Sure , I'd love to . I heard Sichuan cuisine is very hot , I think I definitely love it . 
 Well , let's finish this great dinner first . 
 Hey Michelle . Good to see you . Are you at lunch ? 
 No , I wish I was ! I just got back from Spain actually . 
 My first time . I've traveled around Europe a lot , but this was my first time to Spain . It was amazing , and the weather was just beautiful ! No rain , and just sun , sun , sun ... 
 Well , I really recommend Spain . You really should go . Anyway , it's been great to catch up , but I must be going , this is my floor . Speak again soon I hope . 
 It is . It ’ s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world , with brief descriptions of how they were build , their purpose , and so on . 
 They don ’ t now , but most of them did originally . There ’ s picture of the pentagon in the United States . It ’ s very distinctive with its five sides . 
 Yes . Usually only towers are cylindrical in shape . 
 This is the world ’ s largest sports stadium . It ’ s a massive oval . 
 It says here that it ’ s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings . 
 According to the book , it is . I ’ Ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . Look at the building . From the air , it looks like a square with a semi-circle attached to each of its four sides . What kind of building is it ? 
 Yes , sir ? 
 I'm very sorry.sir . I'll ask the manager to take care of this . 
 No , the galaxies sit more or less passively in the space around them . But not too much . As the space between galaxies expands , it carries the galaxies further apart - like raisins in an expanding dough . 
 Well , the universe is a chaotic place , and the gravity from one galaxy , or from a group of galaxies , may disturb the motion of its near neighbors , causing them to collide . However , on average , when you compare two large enough chunks of space , the galaxies in one are moving away from the galaxies in the other . 
 You're welcome . 
 I swear , I ’ m going to kill you for this . 
 Oh , yeah ! I had a blast ! I love sweating like a pig with a bunch of pot bellies who all smell bad . Sorry , I ’ m just not into this health kick . 
 I am wiped out . Thank you . 
 Never ! But thank you for inviting me . 
 I like the design of the coat . 
 Anyway , it's my ideal coat . I'll take it . 
 Do you have any hobbies ? 
 Oh , that's interesting . Do you have a garden ? 
 Your garden is really lovely . 
 Do you take care of them everyday ? 
 Don't you feel dull ? 
 What ? You golden watch is lost ? 
 It's an open book that it was stolen by the man in black . 
 Good morning , Miss . 
 Yes . I'd like to know how to use the library . You know , I'm a new student here . 
 Do you have much experience with kids ? 
 To tell you the truth , sometimes I regret having a baby so early . I have been making so many sacrifices just because my husband insisted on keeping the baby . 
 What about your mother ? Did she help you ? 
 I see . So if my little family goes to America , I would end up taking care of my child all the time . My husband would have to make the bread for us . I just don ’ t know how I would get some education and be able to get a job some day . 
 Sounds not so easy to me . When that happens , I will be too old to learn . 
 Hey , Daniel , how's it going ? 
 Wow , it's so strange for you to say things like that . What had happened ? 
 Did your teacher tell you the route he took ? 
 Great , do you still remember when he started his voyage ? 
 Good , by the way , do you finish reading the book Robinson Crusoe I've bought for you ? 
 You should speed up , because the story of Robinson can give you a better understanding about what you learned today . 
 That's my boy ! Wait , Daniel , when is Pirates of the Caribbean on ? 
 Exactly , now , tell me the time . 
 Most of our customers are foreigners . How many foreign languages can you speak , Elizabeth ? 
 And how well can you speak them ? 
 And how about your Spanish ? 
 I see . Well , we have a lot of Spanish customers , but you wouldn't need to write any Spanish here . 
 This historian is famous in the field of Tang Dynasty . 
 Right , to be famous to be respectable in some way . 
 He has lots of hobbies . 
 He ’ s won a dozen prizes for his pictures and roses . 
 He lets his cousins look after his business . 
 Good morning , Miss Li . 
 I ’ m sorry that I was absent yesterday . 
 I feel much better now . 
 I ’ Ve already got it . Thanks . 
 I will . 
 I beg your pardon ? 
 To a historic coffeehouse . It's got a little Mafia story to it . 
 Oh , yeah , while he was eating , and he was a pretty famous Don . 
 Sure . In fact , nowadays , you'll see more tourists there than Italians . There are Mafia tours nowadays that go there to eat . 
 Didn't I tell you ? It's over ! 
 It was a few things . The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary , but she stood me up ! 
 No , but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her drinking with another man at a club near my home ! 
 I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that the night , but she didn't answer the phone . 
 I know . I still haven't heard from her . The good thing is that I'm so angry with her that I don't feel sad about not having her around . 
 I guess so . 
 How do you usually spend your leisure time ? I mean , do you have any special interests out of your job ? 
 Yeah , you ’ re quite right and what ’ s your hobby ? 
 Oh , photography , It ’ s really a good hobby . 
 You yourself have a photo studio ? 
 Have we handed out all the water ? 
 Nothing . The teacher said the only thing left was to get back all the disposable cups later . 
 Terrific . There is one girl said , It is the best game I've ever watched . 
 Clive was really outstanding . Not only he put on a big show himself , but also he inspired the whole team . 
 On the other hand , I think the other team won everyone's respect . The leader said they could have crumpled at the beginning , but they just carried on and never lost their cool . 
 The thing I like most about them is that they did not play with a heavy heart even though at that time the odds seemed to be against them . 
 I'd like to reserve two seats for tomorrow night . 
 Isn't there anything less expensive ? 
 Let's do something different today . 
 I would like you to give me a different hair style . 
 Give me a short haircut . 
 I want you to cut it to a few inches long . 
 I've had this idea for some time now . 
 This is what I want . 
 We can go to the cinema or say at home watching TV , what's it to be ? 
 Thanks , dear . I feel so tired after a whole day's work . 
 Have you thought about it seriously ? 
 Ok , did you find a new company ? 
 Good for you , but your leaving will be a great loss to us . It is so nice to work with you . 
 Hi , Francis . 
 Not bad . It seems you are super yogurt lover . You have so many in your cart . 
 Oh , I haven ’ t noticed that before . Maybe I will try next time . 
 Thank you . In fact , I am in a hurry . My wife is waiting for me at the parking lot . 
 Me too . Have a great day . 
 It ’ s a program about islam . It ’ s very interesting . 
 They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage “ haj ” . 
 Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith . 
 That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed . 
 That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents . 
 Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages . 
 I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there . 
 Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way . 
 I want to enrich my knowledge in management . The United States is an ideal place for me . 
 Before I work in the office , I was a teacher . So if possible , I'd like to come back to some school to pass on my new knowledge to more people . 
 Yes . You know , English is my present working language . Besides , I scored very high in TOEFL . 
 I will support myself . In recent years , I have saved enough money for my study in the U . S . 
 I will be there for three years . 
 It's really there ? This all seems so surreal-like it's all one big nightmare . 
 Poor Femi . Taylor's death must have made her realize that she still cared for him . 
 It's already half past four . We should go and pay our respects . Taylor's family will be there . 
 I love you , too . 
 Oh . My God ! Are you serious ? 
 No ! I have been expecting this moment for a long time . I mean my answer is ' yes ' . 
 I trust you . We'll be happy . 
 It's so beautiful . 
 What ? You're suddenly some kind of coffee snob now ? What's a ristretto anyway ? 
 Sounds like it must be just full of caffeine . I want one of those instead ! 
 The Spring Festival is drawing close . By then we will have five days off . I am expecting it . 
 Just like you celebrate Christmas , we celebrate our lunar New Year's Day , the Spring Festival . It is a time for the family members and relatives to have a get-together . 
 Christmas has more religious nature , while our Spring Festival is a more traditional holiday . On the New Year's Eve , we have a big dinner called ' Family Reunion Dinner ' . One of the traditional food to eat at the dinner is dumplings . After that , the adults usually sit chatting , watching TV , or playing cards . 
 They usually go outside to play firecrackers and fireworks . 
 Perhaps it is like what people told you . At 24 hours midnight , the time when the New Year really comes , we exchange ' Happy New Year ' to each other , and parents and grandparents will take out small packages wrapped with red paper , in them are some what we call ' Lucky Money . 
 Of course the children . 
 I ’ m very sorry I can ’ t . 
 I ’ m afraid I have some business to attend to . 
 I ’ d love to but I have to help John with his math problems right now . 
 No , thanks . His home is not far and I can walk there . 
 Ok , thank you . 
 I really couldn't understand him . 
 We'd better leave him alone . 
 Yes , are you ? 
 You do know that it's absolutely freezing out , don't you ? I'd put a coat on if I were you . 
 Well , it's started raining since then . Look out the window ! It's pouring rain out there ! 
 Have a look outside for me . Does that look like hail to you ? 
 That's a good idea . But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it . 
 How long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ? 
 Maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse . 
 Good idea . That will help us to warm up . 
 Alright . I'll have a cup of tea waiting for you . 
 Yes . All international ping-pong tournaments have become a demonstration of Chinese supremacy in the sport . 
 In the first place , I think the whole nation is just fond of the game . It is well grounded with the mass . With huge numbers of people playing ping-pong , we can always spot a handful of potential world champions . 
 Sure . There is a careful mechanism for selecting players from provincial teams , and those lucky dogs have to observe strict rules . 
 They are subject to hard training . And you know what , for a player on the national team , personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions . They are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other . 
 Well , ping-pong is our national sport , and we just have to keep winning one honor after another . That's why many people think such rules acceptable . After all , they are funded out of taxpayers'money . 
 Why not ! It ’ s a classic . In fact , it ’ s one of my favorite novels . 
 Don ’ t judge a book by its cover . Do you Kwon what it ’ s about ? 
 First of all , it ’ s a romance novel , set in the early 19th century . 
 It ’ s basically about a father who tried to marry off one of his five girls . 
 Since he doesn ’ t have a son , he hopes that one of the girls will marry a wealthy man . That way , all of his daughters will be cared for . 
 No , that ’ s the problem . Though they are well-off , once he dies , his house will go to his cousin . So , when he dies , the girls will have nothing . 
 So , are you going to read the novel or watch the movie ? 
 That ’ s probably because she wants you to read the book first . 
 How about this . When you finish the book . I ’ ll get the movie and watch it with you . 
 Hello ! 
 Hi , Jason ! Long time no see . How's the hotel ? 
 I know what you mean . 
 I am leaving in two weeks . 
 Oh , I am sorry , Jason . I've already got plans for Friday evening . How about Saturday ? 
 7 is fine with me . 
 I'll be waiting . 
 How about next Friday ? 
 How do you feel about hiring that clown to come and entertain the kids ? 
 That's what I was thinking . 
 Do you feel like a king in your castle ? 
 Take it easy , honey . It's just raining cats and dogs . 
 Honey , it's just windy and raining outside . 
 I'm so glad that the spring festival is near at hand . 
 Think of the big face down the eve , hmm . 
 Hey , do you know any mystery belief serve the festival ? 
 You know why fire crackers are set off in festival . 
 And also to frighten away evil spirits . 
 And my parents say the whole year will be as good or as bad as new year day itself and bad or rude words on the day will bring a bad year . 
 Mary likes mountain climbing . 
 Yes , she's a professional climber . 
 You must be feeling terrible for Mary . 
 I'm worried that she can't catch up with her class . 
 You wouldn't believe what I got in the mail today ! 
 it's a letter from Ray and Sue in Shanghai ! 
 no , I thought I'd wait until you got home . 
 ok . It says , " Dear Jessica . It was so good to receive you letter . I sounds like you and Riley are settling into your new home with ease ... " 
 just a few weeks ago . Sue and I send letters to each other often . 
 ok ... I'm going to have to skip over this section . It's girl-talk . 
 oh . It's actually all rather personal . 
 ok , it just says , ball , blah , blah ... " Ray and I look forward to seeing you in June . Write soon . With love , Sue . " 
 didn't I tell you ? We're going to Shanghai to stay with them in June . 
 men ! 
 I think the campaign is a blockbuster . 
 Finally 100 candidates ran for one seat . 
 It's hard to say . They all had an active campaign to round up the votes . 
 Maybe . Who knows ? 
 Yeah . That's just what is troubling John . 
 This situation isn't easy to handle . 
 It's 8 sharp by my watch . 
 Holly , I just heard some terrible news . 
 What ? No , I heard that he has stomach cancer . His ex-girlfriend said it . 
 Maybe that's why he didn't show up at the potluck . Have you seen him ? 
 Hi , Kate . 
 Yeah , I saw someone walking like you , but I wasn ’ t sure . We haven ’ t seen each other for how long ? Almost three months ? But you look quite different now . 
 Oh , you look quite slender and more vivacious . What have you been taking ? Are you on a diet ? 
 Wow ! That ’ s great . I sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals , but it ’ s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . Also you know , old habits are hard to break . 
 Dance ? You only go dancing ? That ’ s not hard . I can do that . 
 What food do you fancy ? 
 How about going to Joe's Restaurant . 
 Hello , Jack.It ' s good of you to come . 
 Thank you , Jack.To be frank , I'd rather forget my birthday . 
 Sam , we are hard up for the everyday expenses . When can you find a job . 
 You liar , I saw you again in the inn . I bet you don't want to work at all . 
 Don't worry about it . 
 No . Don't be silly . I wouldn't dream of letting you do that . 
 Off hand , I'd say the Reader's Digests is my favorite . 
 It's instructive and inspiring . 
 No , it's a semimonthly . 
 Yes , it's so popular that it's sold out as soon as it reaches the bookstores . 
 Hello ? Is that Mark ? 
 I've been overseas , So have you been busy lately ? 
 Yes , I was just wondering when you'd have time to go fishing . 
 That sounds good . I've missed you my friend . 
 Thanks for inviting me to your friend ’ s wedding . I was surprised to hear the bride and groom talking to each other that way during the marriage ceremony . Is that common ? 
 Your tradition of throwing rice as they got into their car was interesting , but it didn't look like real rice to me . 
 Oh , I didn't think of that . Well , this reception reminds me of weddingparties back in China . Plenty of food and drink , music and dancing , and interesting traditions . 
 She ’ s got quite a crowd around her . Oh , look ! That little girl caught it ! 
 We are doing ' Secret Santa ' at the office again this year . 
 I got Jacob . Any ideas what to get him ? 
 Yeah , you ’ re right . Can ’ t go wrong with that . 
 Actually , I had a perfect plan for this afternoon , but it is totally ruined by the sand storm . I woke up this morning and found it was sunny . So I called Lucy and asked her to go shopping with me . We were going to look for a new purse . Now it turned out to be like this . Neither of us wants to go to outside anymore . 
 What ’ s wrong with climate ? Anyway , I think the sand storm happens more frequently these days than the years before . Can ’ t people do something to stop it ? 
 My new plan is to wait for the end of the sand storm and clean my apartment . 
 Hi , John ! I haven't seen you for ages . 
 So how have you been ? 
 Bob refused all his classmates ' invitations . 
 He is surely a hard nut , nobody likes approaching him . 
 Hey , Paul , why the long face ? 
 Try me . 
 Take it easy , maybe tomorrow will be different . 
 Cheer up , I hope you'll feel better soon . 
 Why do you say that ? I think you're making a lot of progress . 
 Learning any language takes a lot of effort . But don't give up . Why don't we practise those dialogues together ? 
 Would you like to go to a party tonight ? 
 Would 7:00 be OK ? 
 Hello , I'm Jack . Are you Christina ? 
 Are you from Italy , Christina ? 
 Really , I went to Munich last week . 
 Oh , yes . It is a fantastic city . And I like German food as well . 
 I am from California in the United States . But I am now studying in England . 
 I am studying languages . This year I am doing German and Italian . 
 hi , Charlie ! What are you reading ? 
 who ’ s it about ? 
 who is he ? 
 who ’ s the author ? 
 what do you think about it ? 
 can I read it when you ’ re done ? 
 how many chapters does the book have ? 
 when do you think you ’ ll have finished reading it ? 
 thanks . Charlie ! 
 Whip me if I get below 80 marks out of 100 ! 
 Yes . Can you help me remember how to spell ' beautiful ' ? 
 I can ’ t seem to make a decision . 
 I honestly have no idea . 
 I like it here at PCC . 
 I like that idea . 
 I completely agree . 
 I ’ m staying right where I ’ m at . 
 Not really , do you ? 
 Take it easy . It is all over now . How was it going , anyway ? 
 That ’ s strange . But probably , it is the new interview technique they call it “ Getting to know you more personally ” . What about your answers ? 
 Mary , how was your date with john ? 
 Oh , really . That is great news . What does he look like ? 
 Sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ? 
 Oh , it's love at first sight . When will you see each other again ? 
 Maybe he is busy with his work . Just wait and try not to think about it too much ! 
 Come on , Mary , you're a total catch . I bet he will call you . Don't worry . 
 That's what friends are for . 
 Who do you think that has the motive ? 
 OK , murder will out ! 
 So Dick , how about getting some coffee for tonight ? 
 Come on , you can at least try a little , besides your cigarette . 
 Not for me , Dick . 
 You're welcome , Diane . I hope you can visit us again soon . 
 I ’ m not in the mood . 
 I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . That ’ s a real let-down . 
 But she did and made me disappointed . 
 But she means a lot to me . 
 Oh . I just can ’ t forget it . 
 I graduated from Songhua University . 
 I graduated from it in 2002 . 
 Nice to meet you , Andrew . I am Noirin , Noirin O'Neil . 
 Noirin , N-O-I-R-I-N , it's an Irish name . 
 No , thanks . I've decided to give up smoking . 
 Well , it's just that I think if you don't enjoy doing something any more , you should stop doing it . 
 That's right . You should give it up , too . It's bad for your health . 
 But it's true . It's a nasty habit . I can't think why I ever started . Anyway , it's obviously got you in its grip ! 
 I mean you couldn't give it up ! 
 How do you know ? 
 Do you think Mr . Johnson is a good worker ? 
 Haven't you ever seen him working late ? 
 What do you think of smoking ? 
 What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ? 
 But that ’ ll affect the national economy . 
 How about painting a warning on each cigarette packet ? 
 I'm here to express my congratulations to you on your birthday . And I wish you many happy returns of the day . Here is a birthday present for you . 
 How did you spend the weekend ? 
 Really ? How was it ? 
 Oh , yeah ? What's it about ? 
 Sounds pretty good . Is it a tragedy ? 
 Oh , I like movies with surprise endings , although , sometimes they can be frustrating . Maybe I should invite my girlfriend to go next weekend . 
 Would you like to come out with me tonight ? 
 Tomorrow night , then ? 
 I ’ m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then . 
 Ok . How about give me a ring , then ? 
 Why not ? 
 My goodness ! You ’ re kidding ! 
 That ’ s amazing ! You got a good pay here , didn ’ t you ? 
 Come on ! Don ’ t be silly ! 
 Well . How do you know ? 
 Over my dead body you are ! 
 Hey , Anna , this is Jason . 
 Yes . How are you , Anna ? 
 Working . I've been really busy these days . I got a promotion . 
 Thanks . I am feeling pretty good about myself too . You know , bigger office , a raise and even an assistant . 
 You are kidding . 
 A bit over two years . This is a fast-moving company , and seniority isn ’ t the only factor in deciding promotions . 
 She is very nice and open-minded . 
 Yeah . He was a real slave driver . He probably would have loved it if we were robots . 
 Good . Tonight 8 o'clock . 
 Bye . 
 That's a good idea.What ' s on ? 
 What's it about ? 
 I never understand why these shops have so much liquor . 
 But why ? Why don't people like to buy shirts duty-free ? Or shoes ? I just don't understand why it's always liquor . 
 You mean liquor has a higher tax than other things ? 
 No , I didn't . How high is the tax ? 
 Why would the government want to tax liquor so much ? 
 That's why a lot of people buy cigarettes here too , isn't it ? 
 What do you plan to do on Sunday morning ? 
 How about going to English corner with me ? 
 Why not ? 
 That's why you should go there , If you don't dare to speak English owing to the fact that you are afraid of making mistakes , you simply will never learn English . 
 I ’ m worrying about the children . After all this is the first time they have been out without us . 
 I know . But I couldn ’ t help . 
 I don't know . I'll have to ask my host mom . 
 But I still have to tell her . 
 Tell you what , give me your phone number . 
 Got it . I'll call you later tonight and we can talk about what to do on Saturday . 
 My mother is a professor and my father is a manager . 
 No , usually they're very busy . 
 I beg your pardon ? 
 What did he say ? 
 Oh dear ! What did he tell you to do ? 
 Ten days ? Would you please repeat it again ? 
 Have a nice weekend . 
 It seems to be clearing up . 
 I really don't think this weather will last . 
 There's a new play tonight . 
 ' Romeo and Juliet ' . 
 It's about their great love . 
 Of course . Do you want to see it ? 
 No , I don't . 
 Good idea . Let's goa 
 Wow ! What happened to you ? You look sad . 
 That's unbelievable . Why did this happen ? 
 I cant't believe it . You've worked here for years . 
 He was 20 years old then . 
 He's over sixty . 
 Nice to meet you , I'am Simon . I don't think I ' Ve seen you around before . 
 What do you do there ? 
 I ' Ve beaning worked IBM for years . I am vested personnel file system , He is the after sale survise director . he such a nice boss , I like working for him . 
 Yes , That's him over there - the taller , handsome one . Would you let me introduce you ? 
 Hey John , did you register for classes yet ? 
 What classes do you plan on taking ? 
 Is that class really that popular ? 
 What other classes are you going to take ? 
 I took that class already . There is a lot of writing , but it's not that bad . 
 I had Professor Mahoney . 
 I'm not sure if he is or not , but I thought he was definitely fair . 
 Not at all . I got a 3.8 . 
 I got a 4.0 in that class . 
 It's not what it appears . I actually tried harder in the 101 class . If I put as much effort into the 201 class , I would have received the same grade . 
 Mr . Smith is really a thorough drag . 
 He's endless talking about stocks almost bores me to death . 
 I'm not at all keen on this subject . 
 Oh , Mr Green , my name is Jianshan . You don't know me , but I'm a friend of David Smith . 
 When I told David I was coming here to live , he give me your number , and suggest that I give your a ring . I was wondering if you could give me some advices . 
 Well , I'm looking for a place to live . David thought as you are a @ agent . you might know something is suitable . 
 Yes , I've got the address . 
 I'm at the post office . 
 Thank you very much , Mr Green . 
 Like to come over to our fancy dress party ? 
 Well , then join us some other time . 
 What are your plans for today ? 
 Would you like to have dinner with me at King Hotel at 7pm ? 
 Could you do me a favour ? I don ’ t understand this French document . 
 School has added several new courses to our grade this semester . I have more homework to do now . 
 I like science most . 
 Surprise ? 
 I do like PE , but I am interested in science . 
 Through this course , I can learn more about the world around us clearly . 
 Naughty ? I'm naughty ? I'm just clever . So I only do the things I am interested in . 
 Hi , Tony . Haven ’ t seen you for a long time . How have you been ? 
 Yes , I've got a job , a waiter's job in a restaurant . 
 Well , $ 10 per hour , but I can keep the tips . That comes to roughly $ 80 every evening 
 Actually , there's still another opening . If you are interested , you ’ ll surely get it . 
 There ’ s no rush . You can see him tomorrow . I ’ Ve told him about you . He promised to give you the job . 
 Think nothing of it , Tony . I ’ m sure you ’ d do the same for me . 
 First of all , you must be punctual . You should be there before 6 p . m . so that you will have half an hour for preparation changing clothes and things like that . Then , remember you should smile . Smile to your customers all the time . Never pull a long face even If you feel awful that day . Anything else ? Oh , yes . Never argue with your boss . Learn to say ' Yes , sir . ' 
 You may put it that way if you like . Don ’ t worry . You ’ ll have no problem . 
 Hi , Tim , any news about your job interview ? 
 Oh , what a pity ! 
 Hello , Kith , can you and Alice come around this evening ? We prefer your coming . 
 About 7 o'clock . 
 No , not really.Just bring yourselves . We would like to your presence . 
 No , I haven't . I'm so surprised at the news . 
 Congratulations . But have you heard the proverb that if one gets married too hurriedly one may regret it for a long time ? 
 How's your married life ? 
 I have to say you're a well-matched couple . 
 What did you learn at the workshop you went to yesterday ? Do you think it was worth the investment to go ? 
 The workshop was only one afternoon long , do you really think you can learn that much in only a couple of hours ? 
 Sounds like you really learned a lot . 
 Every teacher likes him . 
 How he manages to do that is always a mystery to me . 
 There's just one catch . Zina asked me to let you know . 
 She promised that we'd be ready to start tracking the Stars.com web site by the end of next week . 
 Yes , I think she is just a little bit crazy . 
 Would you like to have some more wine ? 
 Say when . 
 That ’ s alright . 
 She's gone to a flower shop . Today is her husband's birthday . 
 What sport do you like the most ? 
 Me too . Did you play when you were a kid ? 
 What position did you play ? 
 I hate third base . It's scary when the ball is coming at you so fast . 
 I played outfield . I hated the infield because I never figured out all the bounces . 
 I'm on a softball league . It's not fast pitch , but it's still fun . You wanna join our group ? 
 We play either Tuesdays or Thursdays . 
 Jane's mother always wants her to marry a big shot . J 
 But it's unfair for Jane . 
 What have you done ? 
 Why don't you go shopping online ? 
 Why not ? Let me recommend a website . 
 It sells almost everything you can see in the department . 
 Hey Nick , what are you up to ? 
 Seriously ? You mean to fire a real weapon ? I don ’ t know man . 
 Yeah that would be cool ! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! Or what about a flame thrower ! 
 Wow , I didn ’ t know ! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies ! 
 Let ’ s do it ! 
 Really ? You are a lucky dog . You know , many girls dream of dating him . 
 What kind of note are you taking there . That looks like doodle to me . 
 Does that actually work for you ? 
 I like to use shorthand note taking . 
 Hmm . I never thought about it that way . 
 I heard that ben is forming his own band . 
 Can you play a musical instrument ? If you can , he might ask you to join the band . 
 I wish I could play a musical instrument . I love music . 
 I love to try it , but the instrument is expensive and it was still need to take a lot of practice . 
 That ’ s a great idea . I ’ ll search for some information on the internet . If it ’ s possible to do , the internet will have some information about it . 
 What ? 
 Too bad I missed it . 
 You have any idea why ? 
 I heard her boyfriend is married . 
 Then what about you ? How are you getting on with your boyfriend ? 
 Your tree looks beautiful . Do you decorate it this way every year ? 
 Well , everything seems to be just about ready . Now all we need is snow.Do you exchange the presents in the morning ? 
 And we'll have a great turkey dinner at around four o'clock . My brother and his family will be joining us . I look forward to meeting them . Well , it's late , so I'll say good night . I'll see you early tomorrow , so I can share your Christmas morning.Good night ! 
 Five and a half years . We moved here on the first of November . 
 Yes . I love living here . 
 Yes . It ’ s a lovely view . 
 yes , it is . We've been dating for over 7 years . We have decided to get married on a special day and we think August 8th , 2008 is a red-letter day . 
 yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ... 
 almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive . 
 yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet . 
 that's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don ’ t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception . 
 thank you . 
 Are you doing something on Saturday evening ? If not , welcome to my new apartment . 
 Yes , I have been busy emptying the packing boxes and cleaning up the mats . Right now , it looks like a home . I would like to have a small celebration party . Please do come . 
 It is in the DX community , Room 306 , No . 2 building . It is very easy to find . Just ask the guard at the entrance . 
 I invited all the colleagues in our department and also my former neighbor , Paul . He is a very good person . You should meet him . 
 Yes , great . I am happy you are coming . 
 I'm planing to go balling tonight . Tomorrow I was hoping to see a movie . What about you ? 
 Why not ? 
 What brings you to Beijing ? 
 I've heard that you've made a new strange friend recently , Sophie . 
 So you can learn a lot from him . 
 Happy new year ! 
 Have you got any plans ? 
 My roommate's having a party . 
 I know . It's going to be so much fun . 
 I used to be like that . But I go skiing so often that I don't get excited anymore . 
 That makes sense . 
 Whenever I go to Vegas , I get really excited . 
 Looks like anything fun makes you excited . 
 Yeah , I want my own house very much , so I decide to buy one . 
 Yeah . This is a big house with a garden . I like it very much . 
 It is very quiet and peaceful . This is what I want . 
 I was looking for a book , but I couldn ’ t find it . 
 I already did . 
 I didn ’ t see it . 
 Will you ever get another copy ? 
 Could you please reserve it for me ? 
 Thanks . I really appreciate that . 
 Next Saturday ? I ’ m sorry . I ’ Ve promised to go to a Chinese Opera with my daughter . 
 Yes , Sunday sounds fine . What time ? 
 It suits us fine . We ’ ll see you then . 
 Do you mind helping me ? 
 I'm not sure how to find my next class . 
 The C building , I think . 
 Could you point me in that direction ? 
 It's C261 . 
 Can you show it to me ? 
 Could we go over some things , because I think my test score is wrong . 
 Both . 
 Yeah , I'm ready . 
 These look strange . 
 OK , let's do the calculation . 
 I see . 
 How can I live without Helen ? 
 Did you hear peter just retired ? 
 He is not young as he looks . I think he's almost sixty . 
 Lodge , You must come around sometime , You have to check out my mew stereo . 
 Can you make it on Tuesday ? 
 Anytime after six will be fine . 
 How long have you been living in New York ? 
 Where do your parents live ? 
 Do you write or call them very much ? 
 I don't dare ask Jane for a date . 
 Excuse me , what's your name ? 
 John . 
 Thank you . 
 Sure . It's 5:10 PM . 
 I said it's 5:10 PM . 
 You're welcome . 
 You're mistaken about it . As a matter of fact , it's very hard . 
 You're quite right.But many Japanese learners begin with smiles on their faces and end up with tears in their eyes . 
 Is this change going to be beneficial for theindividuals like you and me . 
 There's no doubt the Internet will be a powerful commercial medium . It'll connect hundreds of millions of customers and open up huge markets for all kinds of products and services . 
 Yeah . It'll be a shoppers heaven . That's the use of net in E-commerce . 
 What do you mean ? 
 How was your holiday to Cyprus ? 
 Did you happen to meet someone ? 
 You always act like this when you ’ Ve fallen in love . Who is he ? How did you meet ? 
 Was it love at first sight ? 
 And ? 
 That happened quickly ! Are you going to see him again ? 
 It sounds like he is madly in love with you . Are you ready for such a serious relationship ? 
 Are you a smoker ? 
 Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ? 
 When did you begin to smoke ? 
 Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking ? 
 what do you hope to do when you finish university ? 
 after I graduate , I have to do some more studies to pass exams to become a lawyer . I think I ’ Ve got a good chance of passing . There ’ s a possibility of getting a job with a law firm in London , provide 
 if life were easy , then we ’ d achieve our ambition quickly and then get bored . 
 that ’ s why ambition need to be realistic . You can ’ t achieve something that ’ s totally unrealistic . 
 I think it ’ s important to be successful in a field you are truly interested in , not something that other people force you to be interested it . 
 I hope my parents don ’ t try to interfere in my choice of career . 
 Total Fitness , why ? 
 Really ? Why not ? I hear it ’ s pretty good . 
 Oh , it ’ s one of those places . 
 Well , they have different rooms . I lift weights by the pool where there aren ’ t so many people . 
 Yeah , they have all the machines , a pool , and a steam room and sauna . 
 The usual . Aerobics , kickboxing , yoga . They just started a Tai Chi class too . 
 Well , I have a guest pass . Why don ’ t you come with me tonight ? 
 Perfect . See you later . 
 Do you like traveling ? 
 Where did you visit ? 
 How did you like it ? 
 Why did you go there ? 
 And do you have friends there ? 
 You must have enjoyed yourself . 
 Susan , Did you know the four ugliest women in ancient China ? 
 There were some famous ugly women in history . 
 Though they were ugly , they had great virtue . 
 Mo Mu , Thong Lichen , Meng Gang and Ran Nv . They were well respected . 
 Sometimes the inner beauty is more beautiful . 
 Don't you know they've already broken up ? 
 And he's so handsome . 
 I just had a quarrel with him . 
 No , thanks . 
 True . With the extension of railways and highways , and the improvement of safety and capacity of airplanes , ships and boats have been giving place to trains , planes and automobiles . 
 The pace of life of people is now getting faster and faster , so the speed of ships and boats seems to be so slow . I think it may be the reason why people don't like to travel by boat . 
 I always think everybody looks down on me 
 How can you be optimistic ? You can see it in their eyes . 
 Don't be that negative . 
 Good afternoon , sir . May I help you ? 
 What's your name , please ? 
 A minute , please . ... Yes , this way , please . 
 Me too . I like the festival best of all . 
 And special TV programs , fire crackers and the games to play . 
 Such as ? 
 Why ? To welcome the new year of course ? 
 Really ? 
 Oh , that's why my parents never scold me that day . They always try to avoid tears and quarrels . 
 Oh , that scared me . 
 Oh , dear ! How ruthless ! 
 Why not ? That's a good idea to help them . 
 Hey , that coffee shop's lights are still on . 
 I would love a really sticky cinnamon bun . 
 Mmmm . That sounds like something I had in Mexico once . 
 Ohhhhh ! And I just got all my juices going ! 
 Fine , thank you . 
 Very well , thank you . I ’ m meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at 12:00 , would you care to join us ? 
 How was your first date , David ? Are you satisfied with Jane ? 
 Yes , so I think she is suitable for you . 
 Stop acting like this . Say away ! 
 What did she say ? 
 Give her up . 
 hey , Isabelle ... 
 yes , I am the guy . 
 let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ... 
 hang on a second . Hear me out , just this once , Isabella ! 
 I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name . 
 I'm sorry . It was cruel of me . But I promise it will never happen again ? Look , there's a nice restaurant . Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over . 
 Really , it's so beautiful . 
 You mustn't pick it in this place . 
 It's a private garden . 
 Do you really like it ? 
 It wasn't very expensive either . 
 In my country , we go to school from 8 o'clock in the morning until five in the afternoon . 
 Actually , five and a half . On Saturday , we have classes only in the morning . 
 That's too much for us really . 
 I'm going to try to find out where the school is located . 
 I'm going to register right now . 
 Which is more interesting to you , flying kites or going roller-skating ? 
 I've got no kite . Do you have one ? 
 I heard that Ann had divorced . 
 Poor Ann . She did not love her husband at all . 
 how do you usually spend your day , now that you ’ Ve retired ? 
 what do you have for breakfast ? 
 that sounds nice . How do you spend your mornings ? 
 how do you spend your afternoons ? 
 Hi , my name is Ted , what ’ s yours ? 
 I said , I ’ m Ted , who are you ? 
 Do you somewhere often , Laura ? 
 Let ’ s go outside and talk . So Laura , do you come here often ? 
 I asked if you come here often . 
 No , this is my first time here . 
 Yeah , that ’ s why I ’ m here . My friends dragged me here , because they think I spend too much time studying . 
 I guess so . But the music is too loud . I don ’ t mind getting out and meeting people , but next time I ’ ll do it in a park . 
 They sure are . 
 The one that stole a small plane ? 
 Did they catch him ? 
 Did he crash ? 
 Did the cops find out why he flew into the U . S . ? 
 Poor guy . 
 The last straw , huh ? 
 I know what you mean . 
 That's right . Do you think it'll be cold ? 
 Do you think I'll need a cotton coat ? 
 Did you watch the Premiership last night ? 
 No , it wasn't . Rather , it looked like a Bundesliga match , where physical contact is so frequent . English League teams are apt to pass the midfield quickly with long passes . It seems to me English soccer players are very gentlemanly . As Diego Maradona spoke teasingly , they often knew only chasing hard after the ball , but forgot to steal it . 
 Which team do you back then ? 
 But the Reds keep a weak midfield . I think Juventas of Italian Series A have always maintained a very formidable midfield . It is the main source of its strength . 
 Are you a daytime student or do you just come in the evenings ? 
 Will you be driving a motorcycle or a car ? 
 OK , that will be twenty-five dollars . How would you like to pay for it ? 
 Would you like to pay for any extra permits for another vehicle ? 
 Here you go then . Have a great school year ! 
 I take architecture as my major . 
 I am dealing with the study of the architecture style of ancient Chinese buildings . 
 I'd love to . 
 Morning , Mike . 
 I've already got your certificate for sick leave . How do you feel today ? 
 Have you received the reading material handed out yesterday ? 
 I will explain it in detail in the next class , could you preview it ? 
 They promised us a sea view . 
 Isn't it awful ? I can't bear to look at it . I don't think I can stand this place for two weeks . 
 You are saying he will be promoted to the general manager ? 
 Are you sure ? 
 Just because he gets on well with everybody ? 
 What's Beijing like ? 
 What can I see in Beijing ? 
 What ’ s it like ? 
 Would you talk to me about taking one of Dr . Miller's classes ? 
 I'm thinking about taking his class next semester . 
 I'm not sure because I really need to learn something , but I also worry about grades . 
 I really need to learn this stuff . 
 Yes , that sounds right for me . 
 Yeah , I already knew that . That could be a good thing . 
 How was my singing ? 
 Hello . I was wondering if Taylor Smith has checked out yet ? 
 The cancer ward ! ? Oh , my . It's worse than we thought . 
 That's impossible ! I'm talking about Mister Taylor Smith . 
 I'm really sick ! 
 Not really . 
 Please don't tell me you bought it . 
 If you did , you probably got ripped off . 
 Sure . What do you want to know ? 
 Well , you have to get 166 credits , including required courses and optional courses . 
 It can be completed in four years normally . 
 You're welcome . 
 You have asked me several times about it . You are driving me up the wall . 
 I'd like to very much . 
 Who's playing ? 
 Do you know what they are playing ? 
 And who is directing ? 
 Your 3.5 percent share is going to be worth at least a million . 
 What if I said no ? 
 You wouldn't ! If you leave , you'll make nothing . 
 OK . If you sign the Stars.com account before WebTracker does , we'll talk next week . 
 Yes , please . That is very kind of you . 
 No , thanks . I ’ Ve had plenty . 
 Impossible ! Well , I'm not giving up yet . It's not over till the fat lady sings ! 
 Hmm . Let's see ... there was Good Morning , Vietnam , Dead Poet's Society , The Fisher King ... Three , right ? 
 I'm so busy . I don't know how will get this done . 
 Helen , did you hear I ’ m having a party ? Next Saturday in my place . 
 Well , drop by if you can . 
 No , just bring yourself . I hope to see you there . 
 Yes , thank you . I ’ Ve already been helping myself . 
 I like hot food , especially Sichuan cuisine . 
 I'II have another cup of beer insist . I know I don't like to drink alone , especially there are someone sitting there next to me . 
 Bottom's up , and you're right . This meal is incredible . I wish I had known this restaurant before . Thanks for bringing me here . I know I'll be back soon . 
 more or less . There's just one thing bothering me . 
 well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree . One of them tried to give me a gift that kind made me uneasy . 
 it's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift 
 I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way . 
 that's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . 
 Me too . 
 Yes , sometimes I can hardly get asleep at night . 
 When will your vacation end ? 
 You will go back tomorrow , right ? 
 Who do you think is going to get the Oscar for best actor ? 
 I finally went out to dinner with him last night . 
 Yup . 
 True , a sea food restaurant . 
 I didn't notice . I don't really even know what I ate . 
 ( Before Christmas Party ) Are you ready for the Christmas party tonight 
 Use this lipstick and it will make your lips shine ! 
 I've already got mine . 
 Here ! Open mine first . 
 Hey ! Why don't I have any presents ! 
 Hi , Bill , this is my new car . 
 You like it , huh ? 
 It is special , isn't it ? 
 Lots . Looks like I'll have to moonlight for the next two years . 
 Hey , let's go for a spin . You can try it out . 
 Ok , let's go . 
 My goodness ! It ’ s the afternoon ? Doesn ’ t the time fly ! Do come in and sit down . 
 What ’ s the time ? My watch has stopped . 
 When do you have lunch ? 
 What do you normally eat ? 
 Oh , it ’ s time to have lunch now . 
 Thank you for coming to see me off . 
 If I have time , I will come again . 
 Thank you for your hospitality . I hope I didn ’ t cause you too much trouble during my stay . 
 I ’ m afraid I have to go now . The plane will take off soon . 
 We have mild wines and strong liquors . Which kind do you prefer ? 
 It's my pleasure . Actually , it's really hard to say as individual tastes are different . As for myself , I'd like to recommend gin and tonic . 
 We'll get a big bonus this year , won't we ? 
 My Buddha ! ! It's beautiful ! But I thought you were afraid ? 
 You sneak ! 
 But that's a lot of money ! Honey ! 
 Were you here last week ? 
 How come ? 
 Well , here are the notes . 
 Sorry , here you go . 
 No problem . 
 No , I rarely smoke . I don't drink , either . I only drink with my family on celebrations or with close friends . 
 My favorite winter sport is skiing . In addition , I am keen on basketball . 
 I like doing aerobics in my spare time . It's good for my health . 
 Yes , I have . I collect stamps , Chinese stamps as well as those from other countries . 
 That is a good idea , I love it . What time do you think is convenient ? 
 Ok , I will inform everybody when they come back from lunch . It has been a long time since we had the department dinner last time . I am sure they don ’ t want to miss it . 
 You must be new . 
 Have you just started college ? 
 What school ? 
 Do you like it here ? 
 Do you like it better here or at PCC ? 
 If that ’ s the case , then why did you leave ? 
 Are you coming or not ? 
 Well , make up your mind . We need to know . 
 Hey , Bob . Are you getting the feeling you've been here before ? 
 Maybe we're walking in circles . 
 I am thinking about inviting you to a dinner . When would you have time ? And what kind of food do you fancy ? 
 To thank you for helping me at work last week . If you would not have been so kind , I would not have been able to pick my parents from the airport . You really did me a big favor . Thank you so much . 
 Fine , I know a good hotpot place in the downtown area , food there is pretty spicy too . Shall we try that one ? 
 I have been working 70 hours this week . I am totally maxed out . 
 What a beautiful day ! 
 I heard that it's supposed to get up to 90 degrees Fahrenheit today . 
 Well , you could never tell about the weather here in New York . 
 I have no idea about what to do next . 
 Let me have a try . 
 I'm sorry . Every customer coming here must do the warm-up exercise before getting down to swimming . That's out regulation . 
 OK , lovely boy . Try to be patient . Do you know the danger of swimming without warm-up ? 
 That's right . But the most dangerous thing is that their legs may spasm out of control when swimming . 
 Yes , besides that , we also provide our customers with goggles , swimming suit and something like that . 
 Of course , all the workers here are able to swim , and they will come to your aid quickly . 
 Much better . My heart sank when Mary told me that she wanted to leave me . 
 Thanks a lot . You are so kind . 
 It's ten thirty . 
 I am going to the beech . How about coming with me ? 
 Don't forget the sun block lotion . You don't want a sunburn , do you ? 
 Can you vouch for me that I was with you yesterday ? 
 My character is in question . Someone was robbed at work and unless I have an alibi , I'm a suspect . 
 My employer . Can you come in to the office tomorrow ? 
 That would be the real proof . Didn't we have to show ID to get on the plane ? 
 Which team has won ? 
 But I still think AC milan's defence seems better organized . 
 What dances do you like ? 
 Then you must be interested in disco . 
 Oh , it's a disco . Let's dance . 
 Thank you . Now they are playing a rumba . Would you have a try ? 
 OK . Let's get something to drink . 
 What day is today ? Tuesday ? 
 I bet it's May 5th . 
 Not so bad , but Kevin does have problems with his wife . 
 His wife always complained that Kevin's salary was too low and got no promotion . 
 Yeah , I agree with you . But you know , it ’ s just one of those things . 
 Certainly . You are more welcome to do . What is it ? 
 Well , if spicy local dishes are what you are looking for , In Hua Restaurant is the best place to go . The restaurant serves very good and spicy local dishes . You might want to try there . 
 It is near the university . Five minutes ' walk from your flat , I think . 
 You're welcome . May you have a good time . Please give my regards to your wife . I wish her a happy birthday tomorrow . 
 Is this seat taken ? 
 Why don ’ t we go the cinema tonight ? 
 I think there ’ s a very romantic new film starring Hugh Grant . Let ’ s go and see that . 
 Well how about meeting at my place ? 
 Show us our itineraries , please . 
 How long will the trip take ? 
 Tom , aren ’ t you a little too old to be trick-or-treating ? 
 Of course , I did , but when I was ten ! Trick - or-treating is for kids , plus , I ’ m sure people will think you ’ re a kidnapper or something , running around with kids NCP at night . 
 I really want to switch things up . 
 I think I want to try a new style . 
 I want you to cut my hair shorter . 
 I want my hair to be only a few inches long . 
 Yes , I've been wanting it short for a while now . 
 I'm absolutely sure that this is what I want . 
 I hear you and James are engaged at last . 
 When are you getting married ? 
 Oh , lovely.Where ' s the wedding going to be ? 
 Oh , yes , your parents live there , don't they ? 
 Where are you going to live after you're married ? 
 Are you going to give up your job ? 
 Welcome , Li Mei . Please give me your coat and hat . 
 Oh , let's come in and enjoy yourself . 
 Thank you , Li Mei . Come into the dining room . I'm going to cut the cake soon . 
 It's a secret . 
 I use several services . Of course , I deposit and withdraw money quite often . I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account . I use my bank to exchange money from once currency to another . I often travel abroad , you see . 
 I sometimes use traveller ’ s cheques , but sometimes I travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash . 
 Yes , I do . It save me a lot of time . I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines . 
 Yes . My bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage . There ’ s a lot of competition between banks nowadays . Each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others . 
 I don ’ t have one . I prefer to buy shares . My bank also provides a share trading service . It ’ s cheap and easy to use . 
 I am not sure what to do during the holidays , any suggestions ? 
 The problem is that I find all of them are full of fun . I just don ’ t know what to do first . 
 Actually , I ’ m interested in all of them . The more choices we have , the harder to make a decision . 
 You know John ? 
 Yes . I ’ Ve read news about him in today ’ s paper . 
 I wish he could too . 
 He ’ s a bit tired , you know . It often takes him a couple of hours to brush up . 
 Good luck to them . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 Well , how about the Museum of Modern Art ? 
 Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building ? 
 So , Jack , do you believe in ghosts ? 
 Because I want to tell you about the time that I saw a ghost . 
 It was many years ago , when I was a little child . It was the middle of the night , and I went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . I walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs , when ... 
 It was a big , green thing that looked like a person . It was in the kitchen , and it slowly moved towards the stairs ... 
 I hid so that it couldn't see me . Slowly it got closer and closer , until ... 
 It moved slowly up the stairs , step by step , and I could hear its approaching footsteps . When it finally got to the top of the stairs , I realized that it was my father in his green pajamas . He had gone to get a late night snack . 
 Yes , but it's not so appetizing . 
 That's what's hanging on my mind recently . 
 Where you can buy lots of paraphernalia ? 
 Cool ! 
 So , you're going to use Sarah's car to go cruising for chicks ? 
 Quite a few people are laid off these days . 
 University graduates have difficulty finding a job too . There seems to be more and more competition in the job market 
 No . Not now . I think I'll try to keep this one . 
 Fine , thank you , sir . It ’ s nice to see you again . 
 Very well , thank you , Mr . Parker . 
 I wonder Why . 
 Can ’ t you stay a little longer ? 
 Say hi to your parents for me . I hope to see them soon . 
 Yes , I will . Take care , then . 
 Why you are so crazy about Beijing Opera ? It's so boring . 
 Maybe you're right . But I just still can't understand ... 
 Your garden is looking very beautiful this summer . The flowers are really colorful . 
 Yes , I do . Those are violets , aren ’ t they ? 
 The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low . Would you like me to cut them off for you ? 
 When the lower branches are removed , you ’ ll be able to sit under the tree . 
 Just make sure children don ’ t play in the flower beds and destroy the flowers . 
 Is she really ? I can ’ t believe it ! 
 Good gracious . That ’ s incredible ! 
 You ’ re kidding . 
 Really ? I ’ m surprised . 
 That's wonderful ! Icing on the cake . 
 All my joints seem to hurt and I have a terrible headache . 
 No , not yet , but I do feel a little feverish . 
 Only since this morning . 
 Maybe you are right . 
 I'm sick of it , too . 
 It's no use complaining . If we had got enough money , we couldn't put up with it , and would have moved out . 
 What kind of jobs are becoming popular in your country ? 
 There ’ s been a growth in that field in my country too . A lot of people want to learn practical and professional skills . 
 I noticed that too . What are the people learning ? 
 I think that jobs in the leisure industry will become more popular in the future . 
 Those in traditional fields , such as agriculture and heavy industry . Younger people are not interested in doing those jobs and other countries have industries that can produce things much cheaper . 
 They are well known for high quality , that ’ s why . 
 Oh , great ! 
 I like No . 4 . 
 Yes . In fact , I think it's much better than this week's No . 1 . 
 I like it as well , but I don't think it's as good as Sweet Heart . 
 Well . I don't like Your Lips very much . 
 I think it's too slow makes me sleepy . In fact , it's the worst in this week ’ s top ten , if you ask me . 
 are you good at making decisions ? 
 what kinds of decisions do you leave to other people ? 
 your parents will be choosing your girlfriend if you aren ’ t careful ! Why don ’ t you try being more decisive ? Start with some basic ones . When your friends are discussing which restaurant to eat at , mak 
 I can ’ t make a decision . You ’ ll have to put forward an idea . 
 you see ? You ’ re becoming more decisive already ! 
 Why do you say that ? 
 Really ? In my eyes it ’ s normal , as an old man , to be thin is better than to be fat . 
 I've got to put together a sales pitch to give to our clients in the morning . You always give such amazing presentations , I was hoping you could give me some advice about how to win them over tomorrow . 
 What kind of visuals should I use to support the presentation ? Do you think I should use PowerPoint ? 
 I think I can put something together , no problem . But when it comes to tomorrow , I'll just be a bundle of nerves ! How can I get over my fear of speaking in public ? 
 Hey , Shirley ! Want to join me for lunch ... my treat ! 
 I must confess I have an ulterior motive for asking you to lunch . 
 I really want to pick your brain about something I've been thinking a lot about . 
 Well , as you know , I have a Bachelor's degree in English literature and that's served me well so far , but I've always wanted to do some post-graduate work ... maybe even get a Doctorate ! 
 But you have a Master's degree ... hasn't that helped your career ? 
 I know education is expensive , but it's been my lifelong dream . Call me crazy , but I've always wanted to have that PhD at the end of my name . 
 I certainly can't afford it , but I'm sure I could find some good student loans . 
 Yeah ... I keep thinking about what I'll do with a Master's or Doctorate . I love language but I don't think there are a lot of well-paying jobs out there for experts on Shakespeare . 
 Do you mind if we call on you this evening ? 
 How about seven o'clock ? 
 Hey , May , how are you doing ? 
 Why is that ? 
 But you ’ re in China . Are you planning on going home for Christmas ? 
 Why not just give them money in red envelopes ? That would be much easier . 
 I've got it . I won ’ t bother you any more . You ’ d better hurry to do it , Christmas is just around the corner . 
 Peter really is a remarkable expert ! There is very little he doesn ’ t know . 
 How big is your family ? 
 Who supports the family ? 
 Do you live with your family ? 
 This is the good life ! We have it good don ’ t you think ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 For example ? 
 I see . Yeah now that I think of it , I wouldn ’ t have gotten married if I hadn ’ t moved to this town and met Sally . 
 Well , I have no regrets ! 
 Excuse me ? I didn't hear what you said . 
 I am new to this school and not familiar with this library . Can you help me ? 
 I'm looking for information on tropical fish . 
 Great , thank you . 
 I hate landing in the sand trap ! Now I'm probably going to waste strokes getting it out . 
 Could you hand me my wedge ? I'll try ... 
 No . you go ahead and putt it out . Then I'Il go . 
 excuse me , is this the way to the Greta Wall ? 
 I must have taken a wrong turn . 
 and then ? 
 thanks a lot . 
 by the way , how long does it take ? 
 I heard the Great Wall closes early in the afternoon . Do you think I can make it before closing ? 
 great ! Thank you ! 
 Hello , Deva , how are you ? 
 Not bad . Have you heard Wendy divorced her husband ? 
 Yes . They used to be joined at the hip . 
 Yes , she said they couldn't communicate well with each other and they often argued over trivial things . 
 You said it . You know , they fall in love at first sight and quickly jumped into marriage . 
 Yeah . We Chinese have quite different lifestyles and values from foreigners . 
 We've heard so much about Chinese film stars divorcing foreigners . 
 hi , betty ! 
 pretty good . My colleagues seem alright . So far everything is great . 
 well , I work in the marketing department . The corporate culture is totally different from my last employer . Before , when I was assigned a task , I was totally on my own but here most of the work is don 
 indeed . Team work is highly valued in this new company . I like our boss too . He is easy to get along with treats everybody with respect and appreciation . He's highly respected by all his employees . 
 true , take my former supervisor as an example . He was extremely controlling and overbearing . He always had to micromanage everything . 
 yeah it is . 
 Thank you , Wendy . I hope you'll be able to make it to the wedding . 
 What lovely weather ! 
 Let's go out and enjoy the fresh air . 
 Do you keep any pets , such as cats , dogs ? 
 Oh , but why ? 
 I would love to be famous and have thousands of adoring fans . 
 I love being photographed ! If I were famous , I ’ d do interviews for all the top magazines , like cosmo and elle . 
 No-one really believes gossip columnists . 
 I think you ’ re right about that . I ’ d need a good manager to be my spokesperson . I could do a lot of charity work , which would help a lot of people . 
 I love children , as you know , so probably a children ’ s charity . 
 Thanks , but actually I was hoping I could ask you to write my biography . 
 Really ? There aren't many left now . 
 Were there any animals in the forest ? 
 Henry , do you know how much we spent this month ? 
 we've spent $ 1,000 . 
 Where are you living ? 
 Do you move a lot ? 
 Hey , Gucci . I didn't know it would be a charity show . You can see there are many collecting boxes at the entrance . 
 That's really a good thing . Let's do our part . 
 Who will sing in the show ? 
 Mendy ? Are you sure ? I love her songs ! 
 Yeah . Though she was so popular , I heard she managed to maintain a low profile . 
 But I also heard some people didn't like her music . I don't understand why . She is so amazing ! 
 You are right . Anyway , things will be different as the days go on . She can get it . I have faith in her . 
 Here is the programme . Check it out yourself ! 
 What's your hobby ? 
 What's the make of your camera ? 
 Do you own your own darkroom ? 
 Why ? 
 Lester , you are really fantastic at automobile repair . 
 That ’ s not a big problem . There are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified . 
 And you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school , or from the government . 
 How is the college search going ? 
 But don't you want to study music ? Shouldn't it be easy ? 
 I know . You have to decide if you want to attend a school in a city or in the country , a big school or a small school , a public or private school ... 
 I see . Well , don't forget to talk to the college counselor at the school . He usually gives good advice and can help point you in the right direction . He gave me some information , and next week I'm going to take a look at some of the colleges he recommended . 
 I seldom heard the quarreling of her children . 
 Because her children have been the age when they seem to quarrel all day long . 
 She is a clever mother . 
 yeah , I quit my job , and started working from home . Recently I've got a project to deal with and don't have much time to work out . 
 it's not about pay raise or promotion . You know , I hate getting up early in the morning and coming back home late at night . 
 yeah , as long as I have a computer and internet access , I can start working . I recently enjoy working in my own place and at my own pace . 
 absolutely . I can decide when and what to do all by myself . 
 yeah , I can find enough online . 
 thank you for reminding me . I'll continue to exercise as soon as I finish this project . 
 I calmed up . And finally , I asked her to chew the cud for such an important decision . I could not have the heart to disappoint her with a blunt refusal . 
 How could have the heart to do that ? She needs warmth and help . 
 No way ! 
 In my spare time , I am fond of traveling and I always take a trip with my family . 
 You are deadly right . 
 Keep in touch ! 
 Where is Pamela ? 
 She told me she'd be here . 
 Are you rushing me ? 
 I know what I am doing . Don't worry . Can you do me a favor ? 
 Take care of Pamela when I am away . She is a nice girl . I don't want her to get hurt or anything . 
 Thank you . Now I see that you are my true friend . Most of my so-called friends left me at the moment my company went bankrupt . You are the only one who has stood by me the whole time . 
 Thank you for being a friend of mine . 
 Thank you . I have to leave now . If you see Pamela , tell her I'll write to her . 
 It's fine today . 
 It rained all day yesterday . The weather was awful last week . 
 It's going to be sunny tomorrow . 
 I don't think so . There's too much competition . 
 Hi , bob . I ’ m reading a biography ? 
 It ’ s about Bob Dylan . 
 He ’ s a famous American musician . 
 It was written by Howard Sounds . 
 It ’ s great ! I ’ Ve learned a lot from reading it . 
 Sure , bob ! I ’ m on chapter 12 now , so I ’ m almost finished . 
 There are 15 chapters in total . 
 I should be done by Friday . I ’ ll give it to you in class then . 
 No problem . Bob . 
 What can you expect ? Not that good . 
 Just let it go . 
 Not bad , just let it go . 
 I thought you were going to let it grow out long . 
 You're in one of those in-between stages , aren't you . 
 Have you thought about wearing a hat ? 
 Well , it's one way to get through the in-betweens if you really want to grow it out ! 
 I was planning to go to Beijing first and then go to northwest China ! Looks like I'm in trouble . 
 No way ! I don't think I've ever encountered winds that strong ! Are the storms affecting land and air transportation ? 
 That's exactly where I was planning to go ! 
 Hey , Jenny . Would you like to go to dinner with me ? 
 No , I don't . What do they say about office romances ? 
 That's silly . What I do on my own time is no one else ’ s business . Besides , it's pretty hard to meet people outside of the office when we spend long hours here . 
 People fall in love with people they work with . That's a fact . 
 If it does , it will only make you more productive , because we can support each other . 
 Good grief . All I did was ask you out . I am sorry . 
 I am talking about dinner tonight , not a lifetime . 
 I like company . 
 What can I say ? I am a passionate guy . 
 You want to go out with me and you know it . 
 Ok , I get the message . Hey , do you have any sisters ? 
 I hope that I can finally find free time too . I ’ Ve been so busy at work recently . 
 I hope to do a little gardening . I find it very relaxing . 
 I heard that the weather should be good . There ’ s a possibility of a shower , but it ’ s not very likely . 
 Of course , something could come up and stop that wish coming true . 
 Do you drink the Robust Milk every day ? 
 It will make you as fit as a fiddle . 
 In my country , we go to school from 8 o'clock in the morning until five in the afternoon . 
 Actually , five and a half.On Saturday , we have classes only in the morning . 
 That's too much for us really . 
 I'm going to try to find out where the school is located . 
 I'm going to register right now . 
 Well , what about it ? As it happens I've got two tickets for next thursday evening . I thought perhaps . 
 But I said thursday.The tickets are for thursday evening . 
 I see.Oh , well some other time perhaps . 
 Where were you last night , at exactly nine twenty PM ? 
 Are you sure you cann't remember ? 
 Were you in or out ? Can you remember that ? 
 Did you see anyone come into the block flats ? 
 Sure ? 
 Jim is a genius . He gets along well with everybody and he can always get the work done . 
 Everybody would like to have Jim on their team . Because he is funny and helpful and he can contribute a lot to the team he belongs to . 
 Right . 
 Poor , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ? 
 You forgot all of about it , didn't you ? 
 Thanks . 
 I ’ Ve been busy with a first aid course that I started about a week ago at the Red Cross . 
 For sure ! I mean we ’ Ve learned how to apply pressure to stop bleeding , how to check for a pulse , and even how to apply CPR ! 
 Well , they took us along with some paramedics.There was this guy who fell off his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as well as a couple of compound fractures . His wounds were pretty serious so they had to rush him to the hospital . It was intense ! 
 Hello ? 
 Good morning . 
 Oh . I had hoped she would have called me back yesterday . 
 Is there someone else I can talk to ? 
 Any time after 2 pm today would be good for me . 
 I'd prefer to speak with Ms . Fonda . 
 That will be fine . 
 I work so hard that I do not have the energy to exercise . 
 But I work hard all the time for long hours . Often I have no time for lunch . Yet , I am still getting fatter . 
 I know you're right , but what can I do ? 
 But I'll miss the news . It's important in my business to keep up with events in China . 
 That's a good idea ! 
 Oh yeah ? 
 How did you feel when you graduated ? 
 What did you do after graduation ? 
 Sounds like you're happy with your decision . 
 It was also a proud day for me , but I also felt like a kind of loss that day . 
 While seeing others going to work or continue their study , I didn't know what I would do . 
 I had one , but I didn't like the job very much . I wanted to attend graduate school , but I was afraid it would be too tough . 
 John's father got married again . 
 If I tell you . , you must be completely taken aback . 
 He married a girl who is only eighteen ! 
 Have a nice weekend ! 
 Do you have any plans ? 
 Oh , I haven't decided what I'm going to do yet . 
 I can speak French and German . 
 I can speak German quite well , but I can't speak French very well . 
 No , but I'll be able to tomorrow . 
 Look at this one.It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers . 
 Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big.Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture . 
 Let's have the salesmen for a demonstration . 
 You tried to seduce me . I fell for you . 
 I am just thinking of it . Maybe I ’ ll go . 
 I think they must have horrible lives . All the paparazzi take photos of them wherever they go and whatever they do . They must get sick of it . 
 I think that few of the show biz stars want any publicity for themselves . They only want it for their films . 
 Show biz stars have plenty of expenses . That ’ s why they need so much money . They need million of dollars to buy big , seclude houses and wonderful dresses . I bet most show biz stars would prefer to Wea 
 I think you should give them some credit . They ’ re very talented people and they deserve all the money they earn . They even donate money to charity to help people who are less fortunate than themselves 
 What's the matter , Lisa ? You don't look too good . 
 You mean Mark ? He seems like such an honest guy . 
 Two months ? How did you find out ? 
 So you asked him about the girl who called ? 
 What'd he do ? 
 Indiscretion ? How can an indiscretion last two months ? I mean , you two have been married for two years ! How can he do that to you ? 
 Good . I totally agree with what you did . 
 Palmistry ? What is that ? 
 Oh , you mean palm reading . I've seen that before , but I don't believe in it . 
 Really ? You've read books about it ? Ok , then . But only if you want to . 
 What else do you see ? Will I be successful ? Will I make a lot of money ? 
 What ? What is it ? What's the matter ? 
 Welcome back movie lovers to another Premier Movie Review . My name is Richard Clarke and I am joined today by the very erudite DavidWatson . 
 Well , I think this film is simply a fable , depicting man ’ s eternal greed for power , and in my opinion , it ’ s a very fine film . Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries.The musical score was amazing , the animation was very well done , and the story was simply enchanting . 
 Predictable ! How ! Come on Dick , It ’ s a G-rated movie ! It ’ s for the kids ! It ’ s not a thriller ! 
 How can it be cliche ? It ’ s a fable ! It ’ s telling a time-honoured story ! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption , and teaches children the value of respect , life and love . 
 Open your heart Dick . Don ’ t shut us out . 
 Hi , Walter ! 
 What do you think of our new teacher ? 
 You're got a point there . But do you think he's a little absent-minded ? 
 It gives me great pleasure to introduce Mr ... eh Mr ... 
 Yeah ! May I introduce Mis ... eh ... Miss ... 
 Oh yeah ! Would you please welcome ... Miss Jan Brown . 
 I don't understand . You don't even know the ' friends ' you are ' talking ' to ! 
 Do you believe what they say ? 
 Thanks , but I'm a lousy typist . 
 I don't believe it . 
 You are not serious ? 
 I can believe that . 
 Are you serious ? 
 But why ? Did I do anything wrong ? 
 Hey , come on . It ’ s too early to say that . We can fix things . 
 But I still love you . 
 I knew this would happen some day ... 
 Well . It ’ s not all my fault , Anna ... 
 I would like that Anna , but I think I ’ ll need a little space for a bit . 
 Shall we keep pur friendship ? 
 Who's that ? 
 Is that your cousin in the back ? 
 What about birth control pills ? Don't they work on Italians ? 
 And I heard that Italian men have very active libidos . 
 I can hardly make ends meet these days . 
 My income remains the same but prices just continue to rise . 
 Definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month . 
 Well , my mum lost her job yesterday . 
 The supply outstrips the demand in the job market and women are in a disadvantageous position as a whole . 
 Well , she is thinking of doing some household cleaning or baby sitting in the community . 
 Thank you . I just hope she won't feel pressed . 
 I just lost my job . I'm just worried about how I'm going to pay the bills . 
 I just started , but the job market is very bad right now . I'm not optimistic about it . 
 She's trying to be supportive , but I can tell she is very worried about our financial situation as well . 
 I really appreciate your help . 
 Let me tell you what happened to my homework . 
 Actually , I did it , but then it got lost . 
 Yes , I could . 
 I'll make it up early next week . 
 I'll try . 
 Do you want to try your hand at tennis ? 
 It seems you're very fond of it . 
 This is how a holiday should be . Relaxing on the beach with a nice cool drink . 
 Don ’ t worry about them . They ’ re very responsible . Besides , there are many people there and there ’ s lifeguard employed by the hotel . Waiter ! Could I have another drink pleas ? Thank you . So , what shall we do this evening ? 
 So , we could try that restaurant that was recommended in the guidebook . Then we could go to a club . We haven ’ t been to one for ages . 
 Now , how about going for a swim in the sea ? We shouldn ’ t sunbathe all day . 
 Hi , Tom.Want a cup of coffee ? 
 Oh , hey , did you look in the classified ads ? 
 No , Ah ... single sellers . 
 Uh huh.How about a used car ? They've got good ones now . 
 Oh , hey , how about a new car ? They've got easy loans now.You ' d feel so good driving a new car . 
 Oh my God ! I can't find my first period American literature class . 
 Aren't you the guy who sat in front of me in our homeroom ? 
 I'm Mary . I can't find my American literature class . 
 It's 112 . 
 Thanks a lot , Brad . I've got to go before the bell rings . 
 I suspect it's unavoidable . 
 Yeah . She married him at her mother's bidding . 
 How much do you want ? 
 I am so sorry to hear that . Is that enough ? 
 Forget it ! We seemingly need to gather money little by little . 
 No rush . You can give it back whenever you have it . 
 Generally speaking , Mark's personality is much more agreeable than Jones 
 Possibly . 
 How nice of you to remember ! 
 You're so thoughtful.Thank you . 
 Where do you need to be that is more important than school ? 
 Do you have a plan to make up your missed work ? 
 Are you going to go right away ? 
 All right , but please remember that it is your responsibility to catch up . 
 Goodbye , and try not to miss any more school . 
 Yes , very . I thought the last speaker was especially good . 
 How do you do ? I'm Ted Nugent . 
 It's Nugent , N-U-G-E-N-T , but just call me Ted . 
 Glad to meet you . 
 Me ? I'm in the car business . 
 Yes , that's right . And how about you ? 
 Oh , really ? What do you do there exactly ? 
 It's terrible how things have changed . You remember there used to be trees on all these hills . 
 No , they've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away . 
 Yes , I can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . But nowadays you just don't see the birds that you used to see around here . 
 What does his dad say ? 
 You are married to a foreigner , huh ? So what ’ s it like ? 
 Yeah , I know what you mean . The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples , not to mention two people from different cultures . 
 Oh , so he ’ s half Chinese and half American . That ’ s unusual . What languages does he speak , then ? 
 What does he look like ? Can people tell ? 
 Would you like to go to a concert tonight ? 
 All right , then.There is one at the new concert hall . 
 It's the Powell orchestra . 
 They're doing a seventeenth-century program . 
 Well , I'm not sure of his name , but I know it's going to be his farewell performance . 
 Yeah , Cal Ripen just hit a home run . 
 Well it was 3 to 4 , but Ripen ’ s home run made it 5 to 4 since another player was on first base . 
 Right . 
 Yeah , there isn ’ t a bad seat in the place . 
 It was a great idea to spend a day watching a game . 
 Well , it ’ s really too late . I have to go now . 
 Sorry , I can ’ t.My mother doesn ’ t want me to be late . I really have to go . 
 Thank you for your delicious meal . 
 I think it's the most successful film in scene-setting and music . 
 Did you get a nice tree ? 
 Let's put it over there . 
 Let's string the lights first.Then we won't have to mess up the decorations . 
 There , ... we're about done . 
 OK . Here goes . 
 Have the aerobic classes any effect on you ? 
 Congratulations ! That's really something beyond my imagination . 
 How could we ever manage to buy a big house when we are always living beyond our means ? 
 Can we have dinner together sometime this weekend ? 
 How about the second of March ? 
 It's Friday . 
 I cannot stay here any more minutes . 
 Tom is making so much noise . I have not a bit of peace and quiet all evening . 
 What does she do ? 
 Does she go to night school ? 
 Why ? What does she want to be ? 
 What classes does she take ? 
 You must be Wily . It's nice to meet you . 
 Tim , please . Please be seated . 
 So , Wily , you have been with IBM for two years ready for change ? 
 What about you , Emily ? Have you dated anyone recently ? 
 That's too bad . What happened ? 
 Daniel , you can't spit the gum everywhere . 
 Do you know how many people chew gum everyday ? 
 Just in Beijing , people consume 300,000 pieces of gum every day . 
 If all the people spit out the gum like you , the whole world would become a big trash can . 
 I just want to remind you to behave yourself . 
 Is my hair done yet ? 
 How long until you're finished ? 
 I like my hair so much . 
 It's beautiful . 
 How much is it for my hair ? 
 Thanks for everything . 
 Listen , Karen , I need your help . I don't know anyone here yet . 
 My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L.A.Hank and I will be flying there tonight . 
 Doctors aren't sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her . 
 Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights . 
 I don't want to do that to you , Karen . 
 Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days . 
 I'd like to talk with her.This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight . 
 I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older . 
 Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free . 
 Oh ... I bet the firm is fuming . Do they know who spilled the beans ? 
 What kind of repercussions will there be for the people who are held responsible ? 
 Why would the person who told have problems with the law ? 
 I didn't think about that . That's pretty serious . Are there investigators working on finding out who it was ? 
 You are not being a good sport about this . 
 I never cheat . 
 Hi , I'm Lucas , I just moved in next door . 
 Nice to meet you too . 
 Thanks . Some tea would be nice . Chinese tea is great . I really like your tea set . Where did you get it ? 
 Oh yeah , I saw the tea house the other day . I think I might go and have a look sometime . It's a nice neighborhood here . 
 There's a gym nearby ? That's exciting ! I really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible . I've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight . 
 That would be wonderful . Thanks ! 
 I like basketball . I really enjoy watching the NBA games on TV . 
 I don ’ t really have one but I support Huston . 
 I think they do , but I ’ m biased . They have a good manager and a great coach . 
 I have the same problem . The players are really very skilful . I wish I could play that well . 
 Yes , I do . We ’ re doing pretty well this season . We ’ Ve won most of our games , but we ’ re not top of the league table . 
 We ’ Ve got four more games . I hope we can win all of them . 
 Why not ? 
 When poyou have to see her ? 
 I like the kid.He ' s so lovely . 
 Twelve.He ' s very sensible for his age . 
 You're telling me . 
 Oh , I was out sick most of last week . I ’ m still not completely over it . You ’ d better not get too close ! 
 Sure , why not ? I could use a rest . 
 Oh , I went on a holiday in the city of Chende . 
 The city is small , not very modern , but there are many mountains with lots of trees around the city , so the air there is pretty fresh . 
 Certainly ! The most attractive place is that , it's very large ; it is 8 times the size of Forbidden City and 16 times the size of Summer Palace . The art of gardens is perfectly represented in it . 
 Yes , I think the reason is that there is a big lake , and many trees in the Resort . 
 The main product of Chende is various kinds of ferine mushroom and the almond . The mushroom tastes really good , and it is very different from the common mushrooms , and the snack made of almond is delicious . 
 Gino , do you really need to go ? 
 But don't forget to give me a ring . 
 Take care of yourself . 
 Bye , my boy . 
 Oh really ? Is he all right ? 
 Poor old John ! I am ever so sorry . 
 Mind your own business . 
 yes , I heard it's supposed to come out in June . Are you thinking about getting one ? 
 if I had enough money , I'd buy one , but I don't even have enough to buy one of their shuffle spods . 
 the first generation iPod shuffle is about the size of a park of gum and the second generation iPod shuffle is about half the size of the first . 
 I think it's either one or two gigs . I can't remember . 
 not much at all . I think it's about 100 dollars . 
 do you have an iPod ? 
 why didn't you just buy another battery for it so you could use it ? 
 You seem to like her very much , don't you ? 
 But I heard that she had a three-year-old girl . 
 Do you need help with something ? 
 Is there something wrong ? 
 Did you check the computer ? 
 Did it say anything ? 
 I ’ m sure I can get it from another library . 
 I ’ ll let you know when I get the book in . 
 Hello Bill , what's new ? 
 I'm glad to hear it . 
 Hey , Robert , what are you doing this weekend ? 
 We are putting together a birthday party for Mary . 
 We thought it would be fun to have a pool party at Jay's house . 
 We will be providing hot dogs , hamburgers , and cake , but people can bring side dishes . 
 Dress casually and bring your bathing suit ! 
 Jessica is going back to Holland next week . I've been thinking a lot about what to give her as a parting gift , but I still have no clue . 
 Yeah , that's her . We had a lot of wonderful times together . She is really a special friend , and I want to get her something meaningful . 
 I don't think so . That way it would lose all the charm . I want it to be a surprise . I want to show her that I care about her and I hope our friendship will last . 
 Hmm , I think I've got an idea . Maybe I can get her an ever-green plant to take back home . 
 I hope so . I'll make sure to get a small one so she can put it into her suitcase . I hope it won't cause her trouble at the border . 
 Do you have any hobbies ? 
 Oh , that ’ s interesting , and but what kind of things ? 
 Stones ? I know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ? 
 well , I can ’ t just image it . 
 Count me out . 
 Morning Sally ! What's up ? you seem in a hurry ! 
 Don't worry , I'll drive you . 
 How are your cases coming along ? 
 Wow , Good for you.It sounds like a lot of work . I'm proud of you ! Is this the right building ? 
 You're welcome.Good luck , bye ! 
 Oh , Mary , come in , please . I'm so happy to see you . 
 Oh , thank you , Mary . You're so nice . 
 They're all waiting for you . Let's join them . I'm going to cut the cake soon . 
 When shooting a gun , accuracy is very important . 
 John , why don ’ t you go and do some gardening ? The lawn needs weeding . 
 Well , don ’ t just sit there , do something . Come and help me in the kitchen . 
 Would you like to clear the table then ? 
 Not , if you don ’ t want to . 
 Yes , I want to go out . Would you like to come ? 
 I just heard that you won the long-distance race . Congratulations on your victory . 
 So it is really worth your great effort . And hope you can keep the record you've made today . 
 Oh , what a beautiful garden ! 
 The garden looks lovely when the roses are in bloom . You must have a lot of pleasure in planting flowers . 
 You did a good job . But I got tired of working in the garden . 
 Yes . Thanks . 
 Honey , don't tell me that you forgot our anniversary , did you ? 
 What's in it ? 
 A necklace ? 
 I have no idea . 
 Oh , my god . A diamond brooch . It's so beautiful . You're so kind to me , A . Thank you ! 
 What do you say we stop in at that Burger King over there and grab a bite ? 
 Yeah , not seeing a single person anywhere informed me . Hey ! How about that one over there ? 
 Easy . It ’ s on me . 
 what did you do over the weekend ? 
 do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ? 
 like what ? 
 what else can we do to protect the environment ? 
 how about recycling ? Does that actually help ? 
 what do you think is the biggest worry for our future ? 
 I had no idea you were such as environmentalist before ! 
 Why are you going out with Andy ? 
 Me , too . I think he ’ s really a shoulder to cry on . 
 No , I just check my weight , I'm getting fatter . 
 I'll get you for that comments , George . 
 ah , I don't know a fit works . Last time , all I saw the gym were bunch of lidos , like me . 
 All right . But so help me it's a better work . 
 Not me . I'm too hot and I'm too tired . 
 Well , that's not for me . 
 It wasn't as good as you think . 
 Good morning , Miss Wang . How beautiful you look today ! 
 Who taught you to put on make-up ? 
 Can you teach me how to do make-up ? 
 What eye shadow do you think is the most fit for me ? 
 How do you protect yourself from chapped lips ? 
 How did you grow such long nails ? 
 Oh Gush ! The first day of my career is over . I can not breathe now after dealing with so many documents . But I heard the notice that our company will hold two-week staff training . 
 But for me , the training is waste of my precious time . 
 You look like being on cloud nine . 
 What has made you so happy ? 
 Are you ? Who's the lucky girl ? 
 How did you meet her ? 
 What do you like best about her ? 
 I guess it was fate working to bring you together . 
 How will you spend this lovely weekend ? 
 We haven't played chess for a long time . How about playing chess ? 
 Don ’ t worry , I will teach you how to win . 
 See you tomorrow . 
 Alright everyone settle down . Let ’ s get started.As you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . It is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . This brings me to our topic for today . Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ? 
 No , that ’ s May fifth in Spanish , James , no wonder you are failing my Spanish class . No , May first is International Workers ’ Day . 
 No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is . 
 In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect . 
 Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality . 
 Well , as we say , the rest is history ... 
 It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months . 
 I checked it out of the rental library . It only costs five cents a day . 
 I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter . 
 Hey Lucas , how was your trip to Paris ? 
 Did you go to the top of the Eiffel Tower . 
 What else did you see ? 
 You must have had a great time . 
 Yes . you need to be careful with what you eat when you're abroad.sometimes new food might disagree with you . 
 That is great . Everyone says French food is wonderful . 
 You have your ducks in a row . 
 Were you born in the U . S . , Melissa ? 
 How old were you ? 
 So , did you go to college right away ? 
 Wow , your English is really fluent now . 
 Yeah , but I was born here ! ! 
 Yes , would you like to tell me what's playing for tonight ? 
 Are there any good seats left ? 
 Well , what time does it begin ? 
 OK . I see . 
 Just two . 
 Here is the money . 
 What're the teams ? 
 I bet AC Milan will lose . 
 Yes , I also felt that . I'm always busy , and have no time for rest . I don ’ t know how to make use of time . 
 That's a good idea . And in this way we will know how we spend our time and spare a lot of time to do other things . 
 Yeah , time is money . We really need to make good use of it . 
 haven't been sleeping well recently . 
 every night my roommates watch the Korean soap operas till mid-night . I am not a big fan of Korean shows and I don't know how to tell them to stop without hurting their feelings . 
 yeah , I know , but I find these sorts of things hard to say . They won't like it if I tell them to turn off the TV . Now I just hope the show will end soon . 
 yeah , I crave my own space . i just so tired of having people around me all time . 
 So soon ? Why don't you stay a little longer ? 
 Oh , it's a pity that you have to leave . 
 I'm glad you enjoyed it . 
 Yeah . 
 Oh , my mother is a German , so I can speak German . 
 Yeah , I'm eager to learn Chinese , but it is too difficult for me . 
 Very Good . I'd like to do that . 
 How about tomorrow night ? 
 You seem depressed these days . What's the matter ? 
 If I can do anything for you , don't hesitate to let me know . 
 You ’ re all set now ? 
 Really , it was nothing . 
 I was happy to help . 
 Don ’ t mention it . 
 Haven't seen you for a long time 
 I bet you had a wonderful time 
 Sounds great 
 Yes . 
 I regret to say I can't accept your suggestion . 
 Yes . I am going for a hike around the Qinghai Lake . 
 I go as much as I can . I love hiking , because you can really get in touch with nature . 
 Sure . But it will be a long hike 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ? 
 Wow . You must have been pretty far away from the city . 
 Well , bring him along to . We will have a great time this weekend . 
 Has the game started yet ? 
 Who's winning ? 
 What ! That wasn't a foul ! C ’ mon , ref ! 
 You were right ! He didn ’ t make the shot ! 
 Did you see that ? He traveled and the ref didn ’ t call it ! 
 Okay ... end of the first quarter ... Alright , I ’ m gonna make a beer run . 
 Not so bad , but Kevin does have problems with his wife . 
 His wife always complained that Kevin's salary was too low and got no promotion . 
 Yeah , I agree with you . But you know , it's just one of those things . 
 Mom , it's orange ? 
 Mom , that's a stupid question . 
 I am not a child at all . I know more . 
 Sure . Mom , I can take care of you . 
 I like blue . You see , that's the color of the sky . I wanna be a superman . 
 I hope I can fly to any place like superman . So I can touch the sky . 
 Thanks for inviting me to work out with you , Joan . 
 Yeah , this place looks great . Wow , look at her , she can certainly get down , can't she ? 
 A little , I wish I could do that . 
 Look at him , he's buff . 
 How do they all get in such tiptop shape ? 
 That's it . I decided to turn over a new leaf . I'm going to exercise every single day . 
 wow , it that your sports car ? 
 I love it ! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar . Is it in good condition ? 
 what's wrong with it ? 
 when's the last time you had it serviced ? 
 I thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis . 
 what else is wrong with it ? 
 anything else ? 
 why don't you get it all fixed ? 
 well , let me know when you can get it fixed . I ’ d love to go for a ride in it ! 
 I think we would be able to make it . What time shall we come ? 
 Shall we bring any thing ? Some wine ? 
 Hello . May I speak to Mary , please ? 
 Hi , Mary . This is Tom . 
 Just fine . I say . Aren't you busy tomorrow evening ? 
 Well , uh ... why not dine out together and go to the movies ? 
 Okay . I'll pick you up at 6:00 . 
 Well , my particular interest is collecting stamps , especially the rare ones . What about you ? 
 So have you ever been to the stamp display of the town ? 
 Yes , there must be about a hundred . Do you have a favorite ? 
 I know , fresh fruit flavored is the best ever . 
 I don't like peppermint ice cream . 
 One time , I tried garlic ice cream . 
 That doesn't sound like a good choice for today though . Let's order ! 
 Watch your language or you'll be spending the weekend in your room . 
 Hi , good morning , you are so early today . 
 I see . How long does it take you to reach the office every day ? 
 Wow , that ’ s quite a long journey . Do you drive a car ? 
 You are right ! But I get up a little late . That gives me no other option but to travel by motorcycle . 
 I usually get a lot of information on the computer and use E-mail to send messages to my friends . 
 Don't you think it ' s a sheer waste of both time and money ? 
 Do you believe in UFO's ? 
 I've never thought about it like that before . 
 Do you think that there's life on other planets ? 
 Why is that ? 
 Do you think that there's intelligent life trying to contact us ? 
 I suppose you're right . 
 Do you really think that global warming Wil destroy Earth some day ? 
 What do you think of shopping ? 
 What do you think of big department store ? 
 Nice and warm again , isn ’ t it ? 
 How are you these days ? 
 Fine today , though a bit under the weather last week . 
 Jake just broke up with me . 
 Yesterday . I didn't even know it was coming . He just told me he found someone else . 
 But it still hurts . I thought I loved him . 
 Better or worse , it doesn't matter . I had a lot of feelings for him . I really liked him 
 I know . I'll get over him . My first break up was painful because I was naive . 
 Maybe tomorrow . I don't feel like it tonight . 
 Sure . 
 So what ? I got a ninety-nine . 
 Oh , I make a phone call once a month . 
 Yeah . 
 Is it convenient and cheap ? 
 Really ? I'm so glad to hear that.But I don't know how to get access to the Internet.Could you show me ? 
 I'll appreciate it very much . 
 Yes , I need to apply for a parking permit . 
 What ? Are you kidding ? I'm only 22 years old ! 
 Yes , I know . I have a disability.My hip was broken last year . And I can't walk well . 
 It's alright . You didn't see me walk to the desk . 
 My permission letter ? 
 I was told I should have the letter sent directly to your office . 
 But I asked them to send it to you directly . 
 My name is Derek Schneider , S - C - H - N - E - I - D - E - R . 
 Good . I will sit over there and fill out the form . I will give it to you in a few minutes.Oh , by the way , can I apply for any parking lot I want ? 
 I see . Thank you . 
 It's too hot to read . 
 Which season do you like best ? 
 How about summer ? 
 Why ? 
 But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons . 
 Yes , we'll be there , come hell or high water ! 
 Really ? Tell me about some of the plants they showed . 
 Is that type of plant found in this country ? 
 So would I . what other unusual plants did they show ? 
 That ’ s very specialized . So , the insects and the flowers rely on each other . If one became extinct , the other would too . 
 I see . The plants that fascinate me most are cacti . I find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions . 
 That ’ s why they often have long roots to find water spines instead of leaves , to reduce water loss . 
 What's that ? 
 Great ! Who's the bridegroom ? 
 The guy always hands the girls in a line . When did he propose ? 
 My gosh ! How romantic ! When's the big day ? 
 Will it be a church wedding or a civil ceremony ? 
 Who is the best man ? 
 Nobody is OK , but you ! 
 Did you promise him ? 
 Ben , what are you doing ? 
 Why ? 
 Have you thought about graduate school ? 
 Would you mind telling me then — what were those four years of college for ? What was the point of all that hard work ? 
 Now listen , Ben . Look , I think it ’ s a very good thing that a young man — after he ’ s done some very good work — should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself , and lie around , and drink beer and so on . But after a few weeks I believe that person should want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass . 
 No . But I ’ m working on it . 
 I know . I know ! 
 Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll get it done very soon . I ’ m almost finished . 
 Well , it would be a lot easier to finish if you stopped talking to me . 
 How many orders do we still need to pack , Gale ? We've been packing all day . 
 Well . I am really tired from packing all of the stuff all day . And it's about time to clock out . 
 Why not ! These orders are not urgent . We could do it first thing tomorrow morning 
 See . Great minds think alike . 
 Yes , I did , I thought it was a failure . 
 Well , maybe so . But I still think everyone has their rights of their own opinion . 
 Are you OK ? 
 Because ... I heard John got married yesterday . 
 No , he didn't tell me about it . Don't feel bad . 
 How do I apply to an American university ? 
 I was told that it took a lot of time and effort to apply . 
 What's to come next ? 
 How long will it take to go over all the procedures ? 
 Thank you . I appreciate all your help . 
 Well , speak of the devil . 
 I was just thinking about you the other day . 
 Mom , you know that Andrea and I sometimes worry about you . 
 You ’ re almost 70 years old , Mom ! Don ’ t you think it would be better for you if you moved in with us ? 
 Do you ever get lonely living alone ? 
 Do you have any plans for Veteran ’ s Day ? 
 Well , as you know , on November 11th the allies signed a peace treaty with the Germans , also known as the Armistice Treaty . This marked the end of WWI and many countries around the world commemorate this date under names such as Remembers ’ Day . In Poland it ’ s their independence day ! There ’ s a lot going on around the world on this day . 
 Are you sure you heard right ? 
 I don't believe you . 
 These days my son has turned his computer into an electronic playground . He plays football , rides horses , drives racing cars , and does a whole bunch of other things on the computer . The funny thing about it is that , no matter what he plays , he always wins first place . I wonder if he'll be able to cope with a defeat in real life . 
 That's exactly like my wife . She spends at least two hours a day on the computers discussing things ranging from stock prices to soft-ware standards . 
 I'll participate in a quiz about the 29th Olympic Games in Beijing . It will be held tonight . Will you come ? 
 It was held in 776 B . C . at Olympia . It also has a long history of more than 2700 years . 
 Yes , there were no games in 1916 , 1940 and 1944 , because of World War I and World War II . 
 Oh , it's the Beijing 2008 Olympics ' Emblem . It's a Chinese seal , meaning that Chinese people warmly welcome the friends from all over the world . 
 Sure . 
 How do you pay for it ? 
 Tell me if you need help . 
 I like the freedom of summer with no school . 
 And I like the festivities of winter with Thanksgiving , Christmas and New Year . 
 And I really like the smells and colors of spring . 
 But I must say , if it were only for the weather , I like autumn most ! 
 Why ? 
 Oh , that ’ s very sad . 
 What did you do ? 
 That ’ s a good idea . The counselor is a psychologist . He ’ s better trained to handle these sorts of things . 
 Yeah , me too . 
 Oh . Yes . It is 
 That ’ s a good idea 
 It ’ s mild . but it ’ s not always pleasant . 
 I like spring . The days are long and the nights are short . The flowers in blew . We go on picnics 
 Good afternoon , Tina . 
 I'm not sure yet . And you ? 
 Is skating interesting ? 
 But I can't skate well . 
 It's very kind of you . 
 Yes , I can . 
 Yes , it's very interesting . 
 Sure . Take the tennis racket . Now , throw the ball up , and hit it with the racket . Like this . 
 Throw the ball up high . 
 Yes , very high . Over your head . Then you will have time to hit the ball . 
 Well done ! 
 What was the party like last night , Jean ? 
 Well , I couldn't get away from work early . And when . I got home I had a headache , so I had to go straight to bed . But I was over-tired , because I wasn't able to get to sleep for hours . 
 I don't like them . I used to take them when I had to work overtime , you know . 
 Three every night . 
 Because I was under a terrible strain . The doctor saidthey weren't very strong . Anyway , I used to feel awful the next morning . 
 The doctor said I had to be careful . 
 So I stopped drinking coffee late at night instead . 
 It sure is . The Grand Canyon is truly a masterpiece . No man could ever make anything like this . 
 It is the Colorado River . You can go down the river in a boat if you wish . 
 There is a beautiful state park here . I can see why so many people come out here to camp . 
 It definitely is a nice change from the polluted and crowded city . 
 I would like you to meet my family . Can you come to dinner next week at my parents ' place ? 
 Actually , I've told them a lot about you . They are excited to meet you . 
 I think you'll like them . My family is pretty laid back . 
 Let's see . there's my mom and dad and my two brothers and one of my sisters . 
 Are you studying any languages here ? 
 What are you majoring in ? 
 Is it difficult to learn ? 
 Do you know anything about Britain and America ? 
 Right.It ' s important to learn the culture of a nation if you want to learn the language well . 
 Judy , your husband has a really nice car . 
 Where are you going ? 
 I didn't know your sister lives in the city , when did she move there ? 
 I see . It's almost 5:00 PM now , don't you think there will be a lot of traffic ? 
 Yes , but it can be very crowded around this time . I always feel uncomfortable taking the subway . 
 Doesn't your mother live in the city ? 
 I remember when she moved there . Apartments were a lot cheaper then . 
 Have a good time . Next time you're free , give me a call and we'll go play poker . 
 The time has come to say goodbye . 
 I feel that way , too . But all good things must come to an end , as they say . 
 I've had a great time and thank you for your spending so much time showing me around . 
 You'll be out to see me next year , as you promised ? 
 I'll be expecting you then . 
 The lecturer is dull , too . 
 I feel the same way . 
 Cool ! The sound is great . These earphones are awesome ! 
 You certainly need that . You always pump the volume up way too high . 
 You're right ! So I can listen to music while riding my motorbike ! 
 I'm almost done . 
 I'm all done now . 
 I don't understand . 
 What's wrong with it ? 
 I apologize . 
 Excuse me ? Let's try to work this out , okay ? 
 My watch says half past five . 
 Oh yeah . It loses only a few seconds in the whole month . 
 Do you think discrimination against women in the work force is still prevalent even today ? 
 do you think the glass ceiling phenomena is because of traditional social customs ? Or are there more issues coming into play ? 
 What about affirmative action ? Hasn't legislation changed a lot of the make hierarchy ? 
 Emily , what kind of report is this ? 
 Don't get smart with me . Here , do it again , but do it right this time . 
 No , thanks . I'm full . 
 Poor man , he must be terribly fed up with it . 
 Oh , Really ? 
 Thank you , Rick ! As you can see , ladies and gentleman , we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to win the grand prize of one million dollars ! 
 All right , we are here at the eighth hole . It ’ s a par four , and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid . Although , I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole ! 
 Oh no ! Not a good swing at all ! It ’ s definitely not his day today . On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot . 
 Oh no ! A bear ! Run , Tiger , run ! Somebody call animal control ! 
 He's still pretty sick . 
 We don't know , but he's going to the doctor tomorrow . 
 Thanks a lot . I'll tell him . 
 Of course , how can I help you ? 
 Let's pull out your scores so far . Do you think you are doing OK ? 
 I'm seeing that you are doing OK in some areas , but not so well in others . 
 You can greatly improve your grades by always reflecting on what you can improve on . 
 Just do your best and I am sure that you will see improvement . 
 I was the only one who got a strait A in my class . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes . Please give me your ID card , a photo . 
 Then you have to give me 15 dollars for the deposit . The library card is free . 
 Of course , as long as the card is well kept . 
 You are welcome . 
 Nice to see you again , too . Peter . How's your family ? 
 Not bad . But she's as busy as before . 
 pretty well . I don't know if I'll get the promotion or not , but I feel good about it . 
 if I get the promotion , I will be a senior engineer instead of an assistant engineer . 
 whenever you are given added responsibilities , you should get a promotion . 
 my boss . 
 she asked me about my ability to work in a team and what I thought a good boss should be . 
 I told her that I'm an excellent team player and that a good boss should treat male and female employees equally . 
 she told me that even when I become a senior engineer , I'll have to work with the assistant engineers as a team . 
 she's pretty easy to get along with . She listens to her employees and treats everyone equally . 
 that's true . She's highly esteemed among everyone at my company . 
 I will do . 
 Yeah , about 5 minutes ago . 
 The Bulls , of course ! 
 Don ’ t worry , Shan always screws up free throws . 
 That was a great shot ! A three pointer , yeah ! 
 This ref needs glasses . Hey ref , open your eyes ! I can ’ t believe he didn ’ t see that ! 
 Are you ready to go shopping ? 
 What research ? 
 But they're just ads ... 
 I hear that Tom got divorced , and I don ’ t know how he is now . 
 Who do you mean ? 
 What's the name of the singer who sings this song ? 
 It's on the tip of my tongue . I think it starts with a ' B ' . 
 Yes . Do you want to go with me ? 
 Now that take this seat . Do you see those piles of red diplomas on the desks on the stage ? 
 That's true . Four years ' trails and hardships , joys and sorrows of life are gushing out to my mind all together . I can hardly tell whether I am joyful or gloomy at the moment when I am about to leave the campus and to start a new stage of my life . 
 He's going to make the opening speech . 
 Thank you . Nice to meet you too . I'm John . Is this your first time to take a long-distance trip on plane . 
 Oh , I am sorry to hear that . Take it easy . It will be OK soon . You see , I take this long-hour plane frequently , but the jet lag still makes me uneasy . 
 Yes , whenever I think about China , I'd see the Tian'an Men Square . China is a very beautiful country . And I've seen many landmarks in China but I like the Great Wall most . 
 Was it built before the In dynasty ? I thought it was in the Ming dynasty . 
 Oh , yeah . Thought I am an American , I know quite a lot about China and I like Chinese tea very well . 
 Oh . Have you finished listing your study preferences ? 
 Good . So , which is your top choice ? 
 I see . Which subject did you put last then ? 
 That's interesting . Could you give any reasons for your choice ? Can you explainwhy do you put medicine first ? 
 Yes . I suppose so . 
 You're leaving so soon ? I wish you stayed a little longer . 
 Have you got the ticket ? 
 What time are you going ? 
 I'll pick you up by nine o'clock and take you straight to the airport . 
 OK , goodbye . 
 Yeah ! He ’ s very good at showing off his knowledge . 
 They are professors and government officials . 
 Most of them are from America and Europe . 
 They are attending an international conference here . 
 They are staying at the Hilton Hotel . 
 Surely , I do . It's hard to come by , isn't it ? 
 Can you get it ? 
 Where to , miss ? 
 Sure thing . So , where are you flying in from ? 
 Really ? You don ’ t look very Chinese to me , if you don ’ t mind me saying so . 
 Wow sounds interesting ! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but , how old are you ? 
 Don ’ t get me wrong ! It ’ s just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas ! 
 I am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old U . S of A , although I have some Colombian heritage . 
 Uh ... yeah .. of course ! 
 No , I missed it . 
 Someone was in the way . 
 Yeas , It is.Sewen Jes speaking.How can I help ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry to hear that , sir.What exactly is problem ? 
 Oh , dear ! I'll do well I can . 
 I'm very sorry , sir . I'll bring you a cloth immediately . 
 I'd like to apologize for my carelessness . May I clean it up for you ? 
 Here is my card , sir . Could you send me the cleaning bill and I will refund the cost to you ? 
 I'm very sorry to have caused you this trouble . 
 I will , sir . I'm really very sorry . 
 Did you tell others that we are getting married soon ? You have such a big mouth ! 
 I really don't know how to break this to you , but it ’ s eating me alive ! 
 Well ... hum . You are sure you won ’ t lose control of yourself ? 
 Well . Since you ’ d like an honest answer , I will tell you the truth . 
 We ’ Ve won two free tickets to Hawaii for a seven-day vacation ! 
 I'm the coolest high-tech stud around ... 
 Not yet ... I got an MP3 player and a set of stereo headphones . 
 Yep ! And take it with me anywhere ! And the music is free ! 
 Don't you ever cheat on me . 
 Because men like to cheat . 
 I'm watching you . 
 If I catch you , you'll be sorry . 
 I will poke your eyes out . 
 I will chop your toes off , one by one . 
 Hi , Lilly , it ’ s so nice to see you again . 
 Nothing special . I had a get-together with some schoolmates at the high school , visited the Internet and read a couple of books which I had been longing for . How about yours ? 
 Well now that I know what kind of movies you like , tell me , what's your least favorite kind of movie ? 
 I know ! I don't get them at all . But wait , isn't ' Terminator ' a sci-fi movie ? 
 There are advertisements everywhere here in hong kong . The city is so bright at night , with all the neon signs . 
 I think that there are too many of them . I think that companies spend far too much money on advertising . They should have lower prices instead . Then they would see more . 
 I really hate receiving spam . I also dislike having to listen to advertisements and jingles when they are broadcast in stores or on the subway . 
 I like that too . I don ’ t like the way that advertising campaign often tell you if you don ’ t buy a certain product , you ’ re not cool or modern or efficient or something . 
 do you have any plans for Friday night ? 
 well , my hosue-mates and I are having a house-warming party . Would you like to come ? 
 the more , the merrier ! 
 I sure hope so . We've each invited about 10 people . 
 I'm inviting my friends from work , you , my sister , and a few friends from school . 
 don't worry.You won't be sitting there by yourself . 
 most people are working Friday night , so it's going to start around 9 pm . 
 we'll have beer and snacks , but if you want to bring a bottle of wine , that'd be great . 
 that'd be great . I'll see you then ! 
 No , not really . Why do you ask ? 
 You saw a ghost ? When ? 
 So that's where you saw the ghost ? In your house ? What did it look like ? Was it hideous ? 
 So what did you do ? 
 Until what ? What happened ? Did you see it clearly ? Did it attack you ? 
 What did the doctor say ? 
 Did he give you any advice ? 
 Yes , you must put yourself on a diet . 
 That sounds great . I'm absolutely starving ! What kind of food are you in the mood for ? 
 You are a woman after my own heart . I don't know many people who can handle spicy food . Are you sure you are up for hot pot ? 
 Ok , you are really all eyes when it comes to talking about food , aren't you ? 
 Let me think about it for a minute . Let's see ... oh the name of the restaurant is on the tip of my tongue ! Give me a second and it'll come to me . 
 No ... 
 That's it ! That ’ s the one I was thinking of ! I told you I'd remember it ! 
 Excuse me . Where is Q-Duck ? I remember it was around the second intersection of this street . 
 Yes , definitely . 
 Wow , this place is quite different from ten years ago when I first came to China . 
 This street used to have few stores . But now , you can see supermarkets , shopping malls and department stores everywhere . 
 Me too ! I was lost three times ten years ago . There were no English directions then . 
 Yeah , there are many English signs , and wrong spellings as many as them . 
 Yes , I am new . 
 I just transferred from another school . 
 I came here from PCC . 
 I am really enjoying it here so far . 
 I think PCC is a lot better than here . 
 I graduated and now want to get a BA . 
 What scene ? 
 Adam , I'm sorry ! 
 Yes , but I couldn't help it . I was late getting off work for a start , and then I missed the bus . The bus I did catch got caught in a traffic jam . It was one thing after another . 
 Yes , but there's a rush on at the moment , and my boss asked me to do some urgent letters . 
 Well , no . I thought I'd finish in about five minutes , and I didn't want to be difficult about just a few minutes . If it hadn't been for missing the bus and the traffic , I wouldn't have been so late . I'm sorry . 
 Remember that writing contest I entered ? Well , I won first prize . 
 Can you imagine having a million dollars ? 
 Yeah , me too . 
 David , what do you want to do after graduation ? 
 That sounds like a hot job , right ? But in my opinion , you ought not to choose one career from that so-called list , and you need to take your interests , values , and skills into account . 
 You'd better ask for suggestions from a career counselor , and then make a decision . 
 Me , too , I can ’ t stop scratching . They are everywhere ! Sneaky little jerks . 
 No , I forgot to buy some . 
 We can cover ourselves with beer ! That way if they bite us , they ’ ll get drunk and fall asleep . 
 Run ! They are thirsty for more ! 
 I've been having a hard time sleeping lately . 
 Well , I'm really worried about my grades . I didn't think this course would be so stressful . 
 You're probably right . I just wish it were that simple . How can I stop feeling so anxious all the time ? 
 I don't really have time to learn anything new . I need to spend my time studying ! 
 You ’ re right . I usually end up staring at my computer or checking my email instead of doing my work for class . 
 That ’ s fantastic . I ’ m going to go try that out in my room now . good night ! 
 Hey , Teresa , meet the new neighbors yet ? 
 OK , let's cut to the chase . what are they like ? 
 I'll say , she is really stacked , isn't she ? 
 And he looks like a typical jog . 
 Ah-ha , I thought so . 
 What did you mean ? 
 That's right . 
 Did you get your grades yet ? 
 Why ? What happened ? 
 Ouch . You must be very disappointed . 
 Why don't you re-take the class next year ? 
 I didn't do that well either . I ended up with a 3.2 this semester . That drops my total GPA to 3.45 . 
 What was your GPA before this semester ? 
 Why did it go down so much ? 
 What happened to you ? 
 You better stop slacking off . 
 So Emily , do you still want to see a movie together this weekend ? 
 Mmmm ... I know ! We can go to a really bad sci-fi movie and sit in the back of the theater and make fun of it . What do you think ? 
 Do you think that climate change is responsible for the recent floods ? 
 It seems that the climate in this country is changing . 
 I think that the changing climate is a sign that we are causing too much damage to the environment . 
 Me too . If we don ’ t do something soon , It might be too late . 
 I'm almost finished . 
 I'm done now . Do you like it ? 
 You really like it ? 
 I'm glad you like it . 
 It's going to be $ 55 . 
 Make sure and come back in a couple of weeks . 
 Just last week . 
 Oh , I loved it . I only visited a couple of cities , you know . But I had a great time . 
 They ’ re nice . 
 Hey ! I learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns ! 
 Whatever ... Smell ! Perfume samples ! 
 You mean , you like the pictures of the beautiful models ... Hello ? 
 I know , I know . But you always bat around without doing things useful . 
 All right . Do what you can do now instead of twiddling your thumbs . 
 Yeah . I think so.You have to be patient and careful . 
 You must be joking ! 
 It ’ s harmful not only for yourself but for others . 
 Stop producing cigarettes . 
 That ’ s right . But I don ’ t think there are better ways . 
 Maybe it can take effect . 
 Not bad.We have had a big meeting today , remember ? 
 Pretty well . I think the boss liked my ideas . 
 Well , I have to write the proposal . I'm pretty excited about it . 
 What happened ? We're all expecting you , Hans , Dick , Archie ... 
 I see . Where are you now , Li ? 
 It's not far away from home , It's - let me see – about 20 minutes'walk , Can you walk here ? 
 That's too bad , But don't worry.We ' ll put off dinner till one o'clock . 
 It doesn't matter.Bye . 
 This is our first day of class.It ' s better for us to introduce ourselves to each other . Who would like to begin first ? Any volunteers ? 
 Yes , please . 
 Sheila , what time should we meet tomorrow ? 
 What place ? 
 And what should I wear ? 
 What are you going to wear ? 
 Sheila , how about that fashionable blue dress ? 
 What did you think of the movie ? 
 I noticed that , it was not exciting as I expected , but the music was great . I'm always found Jazz . And that movie had a lot of Jazz . 
 I'm sorry to hear that.What kind of movie do you like ? 
 Oh , I see . 
 Thanks for the sweet words . 
 Hi Amanda , how are you ? I've missed working with you and the whole gang since my transfer last week . 
 It's great . I really get to focus on what I like to do and everyone has been very nice and welcoming . However , I'm having a small problem with my new colleagues . 
 Well , three people are celebrating their birthdays this month and the policy here is for everyone to contribute ten dollars to a card and cake for each person . 
 I know . It is a lot of money and I haven't gotten to know any of the people celebrating their birthdays well enough yet . At our old department , it was only three dollars for each birthday and there were only ten of us . 
 What is that ? 
 I definitely don't want to be that ! But , I still think it's unreasonable for them to ask me for such a big sum of money when we don't know each other very well . What should I do ? 
 No , you must stay ! I swear it , and the oath shall be kept . 
 Where ? 
 I ask you to pass through life at my side-to be my second self and best earthly companion . 
 Merry Christmas ! Mary ! 
 Will you come to join us at dinner this evening ? My family will be happy to see you . And father misses you very much . 
 Hello , Kate ! How are you doing ? 
 Fine . How are your term papers ? 
 How could it be ? They are due two weeks later . 
 Kate , you know , I am thinking of getting a part-time job next year because I really need more money and I don't want to ask my parents for any more . But I'm so busy ! How am I going to work and study ? How do you do it ? Do you have some good tips on budgeting time ? 
 My advisor ? 
 Yes . I think I'm lucky . 
 Thank you for saying that . 
 I have no idea . It was completely out of the blue . 
 Don't build a fire under me . I know the importance of time . 
 Don't you see I'm trying my best ? 
 He got a scolding . 
 but you said your dream was to be an entrepreneur , to be your own boss . 
 it sounds like you've got a perfect plan . 
 it can save you lots of time and effort to simply copy a successful business model . 
 that's right . You should establish good relationships with them . what else are you planning to do while working for that company ? 
 sounds perfect . I think with all that you have in mind , you'll become a successful businessman . By then , perhaps , I'll join in as a partner of your company . 
 What an idiot ! 
 Really ? What a shame ! I thought she was going to win this one . 
 Can you believe the headlines ? 
 I ’ m reading about Michael Milliken , the Bond King . 
 He got arrested all right . 
 Yup , that ’ s him . He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless . 
 That ’ s the kind of thing in America that gets me mad . Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail . 
 do you believe in UFO's ? 
 I've never thought about it like that before . 
 do you think that there's life on other planets ? 
 why is that ? 
 do you think that there's intelligent life trying to contact us ? 
 I suppose you're right . 
 do you really think that global warming Wil destroy Earth some day ? 
 It's said you will go abroad to pursue your graduate studies . 
 Which country do you want to go to ? 
 Were I in your position , I'd go to America . 
 There are many universities for you to choose from . Some famous universities such as Harvard , Yale , the University of Michigan , and Massachusetts Institute of Technology are really wonderful places to study , but they are very competitive and expensive . Some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper . 
 It rumored that Jean is fooling around with another woman's husband . 
 Someone declared that he saw it . 
 Who knows ? You can't judge a book by its cover . 
 Do you have cold medicine ? 
 No , I don't . 
 I have a headache . Is there anything I can buy without a prescription ? 
 I will take the Aspirin then . And have you a small first-aid kit ? 
 I'll take it too . 
 It's rather cold , isn't it ? 
 Shall I light the stove ? 
 Well , what's the climate like in your country ? 
 Which season do you like best ? 
 Where do you work , Andrea ? 
 Oh , really ? What do you do there ? 
 That sounds interesting ! 
 I'm a student , and I have a part-time job , too . 
 In a fast-food restaurant . 
 Hamburger Heaven . 
 You might make a few enemies this way . 
 You mean your friends . I think it's cruel . 
 Hurry ! Get a shot ! ... Hand it over ! 
 When ’ re you getting married ? 
 Why so late ? Didn ’ t she want to get married this October ? 
 That ’ s really a shame . By the way , who will be the bridesmaid ? 
 Wow ! I ’ m very excited about your ceremony . 
 Hurry ! It is time for me to steal something . 
 I am stealing vegetables at the Happy Farm . 
 No , no . I mean stealing vegetables on Internet is very popular now . Many white collars join in this game and have a lot of fun by stealing others ' vegetables . 
 You got what I meant . Perhaps , what I steal are not vegetables , but loneliness . 
 Bill , your work is too messy . 
 Is this a promise ? 
 Our maths teacher is rather humorous . 
 No , not at all.His examples are really interesting . 
 Yeah , how about your maths teacher ? 
 Bad luck , Anne . 
 She's another antique . 
 Your family must be busy shopping for Christmas , now . 
 Woo , your home will beautiful on Christmas . 
 I do wish your christmas and happy new year . 
 Jenny , do you want to go to see a movie ? 
 I want to see ' Click . ' 
 I don't know . My friend told me it was a touching movie . 
 About 3 years , so I came here 2000 . 
 Providence , Rhode Island . do you know it ? 
 Well , not so far from New York . So what about you ? Did you grow up here ? 
 I am in hot water now , all the things seem to be blown up . 
 Thanks for encouraging me . There are problems cropping up here and there . But I will overcome them one by one . 
 Pretty busy . I have to pick up a lot of credits this year . 
 I ’ m majoring in French literature . 
 That's right . We got the assignment last week . 
 Next Monday . 
 Did you check the internet for next week's weather forecast ? 
 Yes ! Somebody up there loves me ! I knew it wasn't too late for snow . 
 There have been so many dry winters lately that it's about time , don't you think ? 
 This will be the best ski trip I've ever taken . I can't wait to use my new hoard . 
 Are you going to the beach this saturday afternoon ? 
 The radio says it'll be fine . 
 Are you studying here ? 
 What are you major in ? 
 What do you think of the literature course . 
 Did you say you saw lily alone ? 
 Where did you say she was ? 
 I must say I think that is very odd . Are you absolutely certain it was her ? 
 Because I don't want any , er , do you understand ? But you are quite sure , are you ? 
 When I quarrel with my husband . He didn't even try to cool me out . 
 I was so angry that I could not keep cool . What I need is just an apology . 
 Yeah , yeah , yeah . Hi , Mary . How are you ? 
 Yeah , I guess I did . They're going to buy invoking ? 
 I'm getting by OK . I heard MicroPower was going to make Zina president of their new invoking Internet division . 
 I haven't made up my mind . Maybe I will go to the US . What about you ? 
 I think so . 
 That's great . I will go hiking with you . 
 I got my father ’ s goat last night . 
 When I asked him to treat me like he does to my sisters , he jumped down my throat . So I took it out on him by telling him what I thought . 
 I guess we should start with nominees first . 
 We should probably let everyone know ahead of time so they will be prepared . 
 Yes , I can do that this afternoon . 
 Yes , let me put it on the calendar . 
 Couldn't be better . 
 yes , but I'm not sure which one to sign up for . 
 I have to work during the day , so I want to find a part-time course that I can do in the evenings . 
 I need to improve my English . 
 I think a one-to-one course will be too expensive for me , so a group class would be fine . 
 I think I prefer face-to-face instruction better . 
 what's that for ? 
 do you have a brochure about the course that I can take home to read ? 
 thanks . I'll read through it tonight and get back to you tomorrow to sign up for a course . 
 I was turned down again . It ’ s frustrating . I guess you ’ Ve got to teach me some skills . 
 At least you know what American women generally like in a man . 
 American men are naturally taller than Chinese men . So even if I exercise , there aren ’ t many chances . 
 You know , that ’ s going to be a tremendous change for me . Because I never exercise . 
 Who is it ? 
 You're always so careless . 
 Okay , but I haven't prepare supper . 
 What do you want to eat ? 
 Dumplings . 
 What's Net Love ? 
 Ridiculous ! They haven't met ! Maybe they're the same sex ! 
 How could you know ? 
 Do you know ' He ' is Ms . Rebecca ! 
 Impossible ! 
 How about the cinema ? 
 What would you suggest to see ? 
 I want to have Mexican food for dinner . 
 OK , you win . You pick the restaurant this time . 
 Are you sure ? 
 Can you stay for dinner ? We'd love to have you join us . 
 I'm calling about our appointment . I can't call on you this evening.My wife is terribly ill . 
 How about next week ? 
 You honestly believe the world ’ s improving every year ? 
 I don ’ t think you ’ re right there . 
 I don ’ t believe that . 
 I agree with you in the sense . But we ’ re all more miserable than ever , aren ’ t we ? 
 That ’ s your opinion not mine . 
 Not too bad . It is seemingly too hard for me to find a place for our date . 
 She said she wanted to go Dutch in dating . 
 But I am still traditional , so I felt weird when she paid for herself . 
 Are you satisfied with your girlfriend ? 
 You ’ re going to set up your own law office , aren ’ t you ? 
 If you need help , don ’ t hesitate to ask me . 
 I ’ d like to wish you every success in your new venture . 
 Good luck to you . 
 Of course . He is now 50 years old . And he started out studying alembics , singing , dancing and martial arts at the age of nine , and has tarred in 140 kung fu films . He has also become an independent producer and director . 
 I have no idea . Tell me . 
 What does he do there ? 
 Wasn't that a great flick ? I was on the edge of my seat through the whole movie . 
 Well , I'm no movie expert , but those special effects were impressive by any standards . 
 Okay . But you have to admit that it was an exciting story , especially with that surprise ending . 
 Oh , really ? How does the book end ? 
 Do you know the highest mountain in the world ? 
 Wow ! That must be really awesome to stand on the top of the mountain to overlook the earth . 
 Have people set foot on its peak ? 
 I have been feeling sick for three days . 
 Not much better.Thank you . 
 Come on . Cheer up ! 
 Thanks , Mark . I used to be a member of the school choir . 
 Well , you are flattering me . I wouldn't say I am a professional , but I did receive some training at school . My music teacher used to be a professional singer . 
 You are quite right . 
 Oh , certainly.When would you like to come ? 
 This weekend would be OK with me . 
 These price wars are disastrous for our bottom line . If they're charging 10 % less than we are , we've got to find a way to lower our price while keeping our profit . 
 We can try to lower our cost of production then . We need a price that we can compete with , something comparable with the competition . 
 Did you know Carl is almost fifty ? 
 He told me so himself . 
 That means it's developing very fast . 
 Problems are inevitable . 
 You can't help learning when you're using it all day.You ' ll see . A few weeks ' study in the school will have a similar effect on you . 
 Oh , she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use English throughout the class.She doesn't mind your making mistakes , though . 
 What ? You want to leave early ? 
 Do you really need to ? 
 Is it important ? 
 You really have to ? 
 I guess so . 
 I grow a variety of things , so that something is in bloom all year round . 
 It looks best in spring , when the plum and cherry blossoms are out . 
 It was great ! How was your year ? 
 Yes , I'm dating someone . Her name is Amanda . 
 Oh , thank you . Your skirt looks beautiful , too . 
 Sort of yes . 
 But I am not that someone . I can easily talk him into doing whatever I want him to do . 
 Serves you right . 
 What time do you open this evening ? 
 I see . I'd like to reserve a table for two . 
 I'm not sure , perhaps around 8 pm . 
 Davis . 
 Oh , any chance of a table by the window ? My wife loves the bird's eye view . As it's her birthday , I want it to be a celebration . 
 I do , but I would appreciate you , if it could be arranged . 
 Thank you . 
 So no more regret now ? 
 Come on . Don't be so hard on yourself . Enjoy your life . 
 It's only seven minutes into the game , too early to cheer up . 
 Who knows ! It's a long game . Look ! That was a really nice shot ! 
 Wait , that guy , I know him . He is just a bench warmer . 
 Clive is ready to explode . Keep your eyes open . 
 Good that he resembled his old , quick self . 
 Wow ! She's gorgeous . 
 Summers are hot and usually lasts a long time . Winters are short , but cold , wet , and windy . I love the summers in my city , but I hate the wintertime . 
 We usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks , but apart from that , summers are dry . Thunderstorms make the air fresh again , so most people don ’ t mind then . 
 I like spring because flowers bloom and trees grow leaves again . In spring , the weather is very changeable-sometimes cold , sometimes warm . It ’ s usually windy with some rain . Autumn is usually sunny and dry , but it ’ s gradually gets colder as winter arrives . What are the seasons like in you city ? 
 Do you usually go on a summer holiday ? 
 I usually go on holiday during the spring or the autumn . I try to go somewhere where the weather is more reliable than in my city . 
 I think it ’ s mainly from the environment a person lives in . 
 No , but parents control a lot of the environment that kids grow up in , so they certainly influence their kids ' personalities a lot . 
 Maybe when they become teenagers , they want to be completely different to their parents . 
 Do you think that teenagers get a lot of their bad behaviour from tv and movies ? 
 Parents have a difficult job . They have to bring up their children and usually have to work too . 
 Yes , he is . He ’ s very hardworking when he ’ s at school . Then he comes home from school and does homework before dinner . After dinner , he goes out with his friends . 
 Are you an art aficionado ? 
 I love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art . 
 Art isn ’ t for everyone . I ’ m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery . It ’ s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture . 
 I thought I ’ d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . Does that sound ok to you ? Bus 51 goes directly there . 
 Let ’ s meet at 12:30 . it will probably take us there or four hours to see all of the exhibits . 
 would you mind if I helped out in the kitchen instead ? I do enjoy cooking . 
 cooking makes me feel relaxed . So , what are we cooking ? 
 sure . We should probably pre-heat the oven right away , too . 
 that's a bit high for lasagne . I'll just set it at 180 degree and we can take it from there . 
 you know , I could do this myself . Why don't you go get the screwdriver and the pliers and go fix the vacuum cleaner so it works better ? 
 well , if it's not broken , then you need to learn how to vacuum better , because it doesn't look like you've vacuumed for ages ! 
 It's very kind of you to come and see us off . 
 We would stay longer . but I've got to attend a meeting tomorrow morning . Thank you for your warm hospitality . 
 My wife and I will look forward to it . 
 lt's Flight No . 302 , Northwest Orient Airlines . 
 Then we've got to get going . 
 Thank you again for all your help . 
 Labor is an abundant resource here . 
 I'm afraid I've had a terrible row with my boss . What shall I do ? 
 Oh , but I can't . It wasn't my fault . 
 What's the matter with you ? You look so upset and tired . 
 Oh , that's really tough . 
 I can understand . By the way , is there anyway I can help ? 
 Oh , that's so great , bless you ! if you need me , I'll always be there . 
 Come in . It's nice to see you again . 
 Would you care for a drink ? 
 What can I do for you ? 
 I need your library card . 
 It seems you have late fees . 
 Yes , I ’ m sure . 
 Your late fees come to $ 24.50 . 
 You have to pay it off before you can check out more books . 
 Hi Sarah , how are you ? 
 OK . 
 I'm hungry . I'd like to eat something . 
 I'd like to go to an Italian restaurant . 
 I like spaghetti . Do you like spaghetti ? 
 How was your date with Betty ? 
 The Johnson are on their way back . You remember them , don't you ? 
 We met them in Bermuda last May . 
 The couple with the dogs-think back . 
 Well , I've invited them for brunch . 
 Good to see you . Come on in . 
 Oh , you shouldn't . But thank you very much . 
 Wait a moment , I want to go to the toilet . 
 It seems that you are an optimistic man who doesn't dismay easily . That is what a good salesman needs . Good luck . 
 I guess we have covered all the stuff that we need to discuss and it's time to say goodbye . 
 What are you going to do for your year abroad , Tim ? 
 You ’ re going to take courses ? 
 Sounds hard . 
 Won ’ t you get lonely ? 
 You're from New York , aren't you ? 
 What do you suggest I should see in New York ? 
 No , I don't like museums.They ' re boring . 
 Ah ! That sounds interesting . 
 Yes , sing a song . But don ’ t sing a sad song . 
 Well , please sing one that ’ s not sad . 
 Is this Zhang Lin's home ? 
 Yes , please . I'm a little thirsty , actually . 
 Coffee , please . 
 Would you like to talk over a drink ? 
 Just fine.Are you busy now ? 
 Shall we visit our math teacher tomorrow ? 
 How about eight o'clock tomorrow morning ? 
 I am going to celebrate my birthday with you all in a night club this year , what do you say ? 
 How did that happen ? 
 Sounds cool ! But that is not what a lady should do . People are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk . 
 She is so pretty sick . 
 Thank you . 
 Does he do that with his Dad ? I mean , does he complain things to his father ? 
 But didn ’ t you say that his Dad takes him under his wings ? 
 Do you know where you want to transfer to ? 
 What school would you like to go to ? 
 You honestly have no idea ? 
 You might as well stay here . 
 PCC is a wonderful institution . 
 So , what are you going to do ? 
 Hi , Walter ! 
 What do you think of our new teacher ? 
 You're got a point there.But do you think he's a little absent-minded ? 
 Hello , Bob , this is Frank . 
 I didn't know you knew Frank . 
 Aren't you staying for the party ? 
 I don't blame you for getting some rest . 
 What ? 
 nothing 
 Yes , I am . 
 I don ’ t actually know him . 
 I only know him through the ... you are not gonna believe this . 
 Yes . 
 How do you like Tom ? 
 Are you ready to welcome him ? 
 What kind of job have you ever had ? 
 How did you like your job ? 
 It ’ s a wonderful party , Joan , The food , the drink , the atmosphere ... Everyone is enjoying himself . 
 Bottoms up ! By the way what kind of entertainment are we gonna have ? 
 Oh , how wonderful ! Every girl on the campus has a crush on those handsome guys . 
 This is the first time for me to have a Chinese guest . I hope you like western cooking . 
 Cooking is a hobby with me . I'm always trying to think up new recipes . I hope you like the soup . It's kind of a specialty of mine , so I hope you enjoy it . 
 Thank you for your compliment . Won't you try this fish with white sauce ? I'm rather round of it . 
 What sort of western food do you like best ? 
 I find the Chinese dishes wonderful . 
 It's still early . 
 He must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities . 
 So are Copernicus and many others . 
 Yeah , I think so . Oh , by the way , I need to ask you something . 
 Could I get back the sweater you borrowed ? 
 My boots ? Er ... Sure , ok . 
 Yeah , really . 
 Of course . Suit yourself . 
 Hi , I'm Susan Jackson . 
 I'm a student at UCLA . 
 Medicine . 
 Yes , I want to be a doctor one of these days . What about you ? 
 Sure . Thanks . 
 Well , I've already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown . 
 I ’ m planning on living with my parents . Won't you ? 
 You mean they're kicking you out ? 
 Well , it's not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . They said that it's ok if I move back home to begin with , but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so . 
 I know I need to learn that myself , but I just don't have the money for it at the moment . Living at home allows me to save up some money before I started finding a place . 
 Well , let's get together soon . 
 Sure . How about Monday ? 
 Well unfortunately , I'm tied up on Tuesday . I'm supposed to have lunch with an important visitor from out of town , and I don't think there's any way I can get out of it.Are you free on Wednesday ? 
 Well , I'm afraid Thursday is out for me . I'm expected to attend a meeting of our personnel committee , and it's very important for me to be there . 
 Friday sounds good . Where should we meet ? 
 Where are you going ? 
 I didn ’ t know you were taking any kind of class . Tell me about it . 
 What for ? 
 I really admire you for that . How is it going ? 
 May I ask what the name is the girl ? 
 The tallest one . 
 Oh , it's so . She looks very lovely . Could you give me some else information on her ? 
 How do you think about her ? 
 I'm wondering if she has boyfriend . 
 Great ! Thank you very much . 
 I want to get a passport . 
 When can I apply for it ? 
 I ’ d like to do that . 
 What ’ s next ? 
 When will my passport be ready ? 
 That ’ s great . Thank you . 
 About my boyfriend . 
 You are really a wet blanket . 
 Do we have to type out our homework ? 
 Is there anything else ? 
 We are allowed to use a calculator in class ? 
 Lucy , come here ! I can see the lake which is in the center of park . 
 It is a great place for a relaxing vacation . 
 Yeah , I agree . It makes you feel really good . 
 Do you mean the red things ? They are roses . 
 Me , too . 
 Well , the stereotype in the movies is that L . A . is a frivolous town with a lot of flaky people . I guess , in the back of my mind , that's what I expected . 
 Well , it is and it's not . The city of L . A . is much bigger and more diverse than I had expected . There are people here from all over the country and all over world , like New York . I've heard people say that in L . A . , everyone is from somewhere else . Tha's partly true . So , I've met all kinds of people here . What I'm realizing is that the picture of L . A . that's in movies only represents a small segment of the city . 
 Good morning , Miss . 
 Yes , I'd like to know how to use the library . You know , I'm a new student here . 
 Yes . Here's my identification . 
 Thank you very much . By the way , how many books am I allowed to check out ? 
 How long can I keep the books ? 
 I want a book on physics . Could you show me where I can find it ? 
 What a wonderful game ! 
 I think John is the best player on the field . 
 Maybe he shouldn ’ t come to collage , he should become a football star . 
 Ok , let ’ s start opening some presents ! 
 This next one is from Betty . 
 One more from Carla . 
 OK , that ’ s all of them.No more gifts . Now who wants to guess when the baby is due ? 
 By the way , how many books am I allowed to check out ? 
 How long can I keep the books ? 
 Susan ? What brings you here today ? 
 Really ? So what ’ s the news ? 
 I'm going on a guided tour in the mountain . 
 I like the sight and the sound . It worked on me like a magic when I was a child 
 I work so hard that I do not have the energy to exercise . 
 But I work hard all the time for long hours . Often I have no time for lunch . Yet , I am still getting fatter . 
 I know you're right , but what can I do ? 
 But I'll miss the news.It ' s important in my business to keep up with events in China . 
 That's a good idea ! 
 Are you married ? 
 Then , you put S in this blank . 
 Yes , I nearly didn't sleep last night . 
 No , I just watched Supergirl , and it began too late in the night . I was too excited to get asleep after one o'clock . 
 The contestants are different . These girls perform in free styles . 
 I think less than 3 hours . This year I didn't watch any entertainment programs . Too many ads between the programs . I prefer listening to the radio . 
 If they could make beautiful ads , I could bear . 
 All right . But how ? 
 I see . But could you give me another piece of paper ? 
 Thank you so much , Mr Addison . 
 So , please ! 
 I bought you a new one last year . Isn't it handsome ? 
 Frankly , he is more well-behaved than you . 
 Why hasn't the bus come yet ? Every morning we have to wait for so long . 
 Really ? I am looking forward to that . What about the traffic ? 
 Hey Steve . When's the next time you're going to play golf ? 
 Do you already have a foursome ? 
 That sounds good . Where do you want to play ? 
 How about Bellevue ? It's pretty close . 
 Twilight rates are 21 dollars . 
 Aright . I'll get a tee time for Wednesday at about 4 
 Ok . I'll call you later when I get a tee time . 
 Aright . Have fun on Saturday . 
 What's the weather like in your hometown ? 
 Is it hot in summer ? 
 He told the police that Ted was the murderer . 
 Why do you say so ? 
 Hey , let's arm wrestle ! 
 Chicken ! You're afraid I'll beat you . 
 Oh , God . It ’ s late . I ’ m afraid I have to leave . 
 That ’ s very kind of you . But if I don ’ t go now I ’ ll miss the last bus . 
 Thank you for your hospitality . 
 How about next time we meet at my place ? And I ’ ll treat you to Chinese food . I know how much you like it . We can order in and watch video too . Anything you like , I promise . 
 Well . I really do have to go . 
 See you tomorrow . 
 what do you mean ? 
 yes , look over there . That's the Empire State Building . My book says it's 102 stories tall . 
 you're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering . 
 quite a number . Actually every skyscraper has a history . A few blocks ahead we'll see St.Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center . It's a landmark 
 well then , there's a Central Park . Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world . 
 most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the words so there are lots of very expensive places . 
 Hi Simon . Nice to meet you again 
 I am ! I've made lots of friends and I really enjoy my courses . 
 Didn't I ? I'm doing business studies . 
 Maybe . My parents moved to Canada the year when I was born . We are living in Toronto . Suppose I might get a job in Toronto when I graduate . It's too soon to say really . 
 She's from Australia . She lives in Sydney . Her father runs a hotel business there and she is doing a degree in accountancy . 
 I guess so . What about you , Simon ? 
 Great ! So I'll know who to call if I ever need a lawyer . 
 Emily , are you getting rushed by a sorority ? 
 Wow . I'm getting rushed too , but just one . Are you thinking of joining any of them ? 
 The guys I've talked to say that the activities that go on in a frat house can be a little distracting depending on the group . 
 Were your parents involved in that kind of thing at all when they went to school ? 
 Are you studying any languages here ? 
 What are you majoring in ? 
 Is it difficult to learn ? 
 Do you know anything about Britain and America ? 
 Right.It ' s important to learn the culture of a nation if you want to learn the language well . 
 How are you ? 
 I'm okay . What are you doing these days ? 
 That's great . When are you starting ? 
 Mary is such a cautious girl ! 
 She never puts words into her mouth , she only repeats the opinions of others . 
 He has a girlfriend already . 
 Her new girlfriend is a far cry from Ann . She is like a breath of fresh air . 
 Let ’ s cross here . 
 Now we have to walk all the way down to the end of the street . 
 Jenny , are you having fun here ? 
 I ’ m glad you ’ re enjoying it . 
 It ’ s my pleasure . Would you like another glass of champagne ? 
 Steven , have you ever met Hanson ever since he went back to London ? 
 What's the way you keep in contact ? 
 Email is not always the best form . I think QQ is way better . 
 You're right . 
 It's so faraway . 
 $ 120 ? ! Then I should go and see what I can get ... 
 No , thank you . I had too much to drink yesterday evening . I had a bad hangover this morning . My head felt terrible . 
 Yes . It was a friend ’ s birthday party . We drank all kinds of things-beer , wine and spirits . After midnight , we were even drinking cocktails ! 
 I know , but it was a celebration , you Kwon ? I don ’ t think I ’ Ve see you drunk . 
 You are a sensible drinker . Anyway , I ’ m not going to drink any alcohol this evening . I don ’ t ’ want another bad hangover . 
 Yeah . That ’ s a good idea . I heard that coke was first used as a medicine . 
 Are you going to the wine tasting tomorrow ? 
 ... and taste a few ! There will be wines from several countries and an expert to give advice on which wines are good and which ones are not . 
 Excuse me , do you know where the visa office is ? 
 Thanks ! 
 I want to study abroad . 
 I hope to study English literature . 
 Not yet . I have an interview with the visa official today . 
 No , I've already been to here for three interviews . 
 I was denied a visa ? 
 Like most students . I want to work in America after graduation . 
 He's only interested in harassing you . How can he expect us to have so much time to waste ? 
 As obnoxious as Bean is , we should still try to finish this case . 
 Yeah ! Remember that one about putting light bulbs in your mouth ? 
 Well , she ’ s tall and pretty . 
 I suppose so . We ’ re both friendly and easy-going . 
 No , she ’ s not as clever as me . 
 When were you born may I ask ? 
 Do you know what it was according to the lunar calendar ? 
 By the way , could you tell me when the film will begin ? 
 I am frigid I can't be there on time . 
 I don't want to miss it today . 
 See you . 
 Sure ! Are you okay ? You seem a bit worried.What ’ s on your mind ? 
 Okay ... 
 What ? Why ? I mean , we ’ Ve had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we ’ re happy together , aren ’ t we ? 
 So , what are you saying ? You ’ re breaking up with me because I ’ m perfect ? 
 Baby , come on . Don ’ t do this to me ! Whatever it is , we can work it out . Just give me another chance ! I know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! Don ’ t leave me . 
 Laura ... 
 Did you hear what happened to Mike in Accounts ? 
 He got arrested on Friday night and spent the night in jail . 
 Well , it was all a big mistake , actually . He got home on Friday night really late , and apparently he'd been out drinking with some clients , so he was really drunk . 
 Yes , I think so . 
 Well , anyway , he'd somehow lost his wallet and his house keys , so he couldn't get in . He lives alone , you know . 
 No , she left him last year . 
 Hang on , let me finish telling you what happened . Where was I ? 
 Oh yes , well , he tried to climb in through the bathroom window , but apparently he slipped and broke the glass with his foot . The neighbors heard him and thought a robbery was in progress , so they called the police . 
 Yes . So when the cops arrived , they didn't believe his story 
 Well , when he sobered up , he called someone from work to come and bail him out . 
 Yes , I know . 
 To be honest , I wouldn't . 
 Not really . But it has puzzled me for a long time . 
 My husband and I prefer to have no kids , but my mother-in-law is very traditional and wants grandkids . 
 Yes . It seems she can never accept a childless marriage . We had a fight last night . 
 But it's absolutely our own business to have a child or not . 
 You know , I often overhear our neighbor , the young couple , fighting about how to raise their kid and I really don't want kids to spoil our happiness . 
 I guess you're right . But I still prefer to have no child . 
 Hi , Jim and Wendy . Where're you going ? 
 You ’ re a big fan of Andy Lau , aren ’ t you ? 
 How come you don ’ t have all of his films on DVD ? 
 I see . I ’ m sure you ’ ll find them one day . I see you also have several poster of him . 
 Are you a member of his fan club ? 
 Did you see the interview with Andy Lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ? 
 Two copies ? One to keep and one to cut the pictures out of , right ? 
 Oh , it was great . We had seafood buffet . They do one every Friday . The waiters and waitresses are very good . They are very attentive , but don ’ t hang around the table . 
 Yes , so do I . they have wines from all over the world . There is a good range of prices to suit every pocket . We ordered some Australian red wine , which tasted delicious and wasn ’ t expensive . 
 They had almost every kind of seafood . There were oyster , shrimp , prawns , crabs , and fish . I ate a lot of smoked salmon . 
 No , they didn ’ t . you could order it from the menu . I think that lobster is too expensive to be included in the buffet . 
 I know . I didn ’ t eat any , but a few people in our group did and no one got sick . 
 Not usually . I usually just order a main course and have a dessert if I ’ m still hungry afterwards . 
 No , I might have a soup if it ’ s a cold winter day . 
 No , not really . 
 Well , it's very expensive and they're usually singing in another language . That kind of gets on my nerves . 
 Hello there ! Come on in ! Don ’ t just stand there ! Come and take a seat ! 
 Oh my gosh ! Your hair is amazing ! So silky , so shiny ! I am going to work my magic on your hair ! You hear me ? You are going to look like a million bucks ! 
 Don ’ t you worry , I ’ ll take care of everything ! Oh my god ! I just love your curly hair ! It ’ s so fluffy and cute ! You should totally let it grow out . An afro would look great on you ! 
 Okay , but you are going to be my masterpiece ! 
 Yeah . That's just what is troubling John . 
 This situation isn't easy to handle . 
 I love this store . The only problem is that it ’ s extremely expensive . 
 really ? I thought you hated shopping ? 
 sure . That ’ s really nice of you . Let ’ s go in and try some things on . 
 that ’ s gorgeous ! Do they have it in a size 8 ? 
 I think this color isn ’ t quite right for me . Do they have the same dress in white ? 
 this is perfect ! What do you think ? 
 I ’ m so lucky . You only get a chance like this once in a blue moon ! Thanks honey ! 
 Haven ’ t you heard ? Richard was fired by our manager . 
 Believe it or not . Everybody is talking about it in the company . 
 Me too . 
 It could be . There are floods in this country almost every year , but in recent years they have been more widespread and more frequent . 
 The summers are hotter . The last three summers have been the hottest for the past 200 years . There have also been stronger winds . 
 I think you ’ re right . Climate change naturally over time , but I think that human activities are speeding up the change . I wish that government would join together and try to resolve the problem . 
 I remember you said that you like China because it has cheap beers . 
 Why do you drink ? I mean , where does drinking get you ? 
 Come on , you don't even know that blinds following is a sign of immaturity . 
 How ? By drinking ? 
 When did you begin to drink ? 
 And then ? 
 So you get drunk every day ? 
 Fishing . It's great fun . 
 No wonder you always look so active . 
 can't complain . What about you ? 
 I've heard . She looks quite depressed . 
 I heard they were just married for 5 months . 
 yeah . Mixed marriage is tempting but crisis-ridden . 
 maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married . 
 definitely . That's why many cross-cultural marriages end in divorce . 
 that's true.Just hope Wendy can recover from the pain of divorce soon . 
 Sounds like an Italian name with an “ i ” at the end . 
 No , I'm an art lover , so I think more of Bellini and Botticelli ! 
 Don't we all ... hey ! Your cousin sells gift items ? 
 Thanks for the pizza . It was delicious . 
 Next time , it's on me . 
 I'm serious . 
 Certainly . The vegetarian pizza looks pretty good . It must be very delicious . 
 I really admire you , Diana . 
 You are always happy and able to achieve high scores at school . 
 Isn't there anything else ? 
 You must have a high IQ score . 
 Go ahead . 
 Seriously ? But you are such a genius . 
 Well , perhaps you're right . Sometimes EQ matters more than IQ . 
 OK , thank you . I'm going to the library , are you coming ? 
 The academy is an important part of the education system . 
 What does this have to do with me ? 
 Order tea . Isn't that what you like to drink ? 
 If you want to be macho , order a double shot of espresso . 
 Your father looks much younger in the picture . 
 How old is he now ? 
 Hey , Mike , is Jenny coming with us ? 
 Nothing . I'm just asking . 
 Who has a crush ? ! 
 Well , I don't have the guts to ask her out . 
 I'd totally die if she turned me down . 
 I don't know ... Well , maybe , you're right , but how am I going to tell her ? 
 Yes , it's much better than yesterday . 
 Oh , let's just hope it stays warm . 
 I'll take one . How's the cooler situation ? 
 Cheers . You guys didn't drive , did you ? 
 No , it's just that it's a holiday . With everyone out partying , there's a lot of drunk driving . 
 My pleasure . ( It was my pleasure . ) 
 I'd love to . Thanks . 
 Any time will suit me . 
 I'm free tomorrow . 
 All right , see you then . 
 I don't mind . Go ahead . 
 OK . You can keep it as long as you need . 
 I am not sure . What are you doing ? 
 That sounds like a great idea ! 
 Sure , I would love to go with you . When would you be leaving ? 
 That would give us plenty of time to explore . Did you know that there is a music festival on the beach in Santa Barbara ? 
 Well then , I'll see you on Saturday . Thanks for asking me to go with you . 
 Thank you . I was lucky this time . 
 I am flattered . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Of course Mike . Who else ? We fell in love at first sight . 
 We haven't decided yet . There are a lot of things to sort out , you know . 
 Yes , I've always dream of having a big wedding . 
 I don't really enjoy big occasions , but I think I ’ ll come round to the idea in the end , It only happens once in a lifetime . 
 Who ’ s this ? your girl-friend ? 
 How old is she ? 
 She is tall ? 
 And she is thin , isn ’ t she ? 
 How ’ re you today ? 
 What ’ s the main idea in this essay ? 
 Hi , Walter ! 
 What do you think of our new teacher ? 
 You're got a point there.But do you think he's a little absent-minded ? 
 I don't understand why some parents keep beefing and complaining about their daughters not being able to follow suit . 
 If I were Li Na , I would ask her if she had done that . 
 Those are today ’ s top stories . Now let ’ s go to John for the weather . John , what does the forecast look like for our weekend travelers ? 
 That ’ s pretty chilly for the summer ! Will it rain on Saturday ? 
 That certainly sounds like a dreary Saturday . 
 May I know how old you are ? 
 What is your date of birth ? 
 What was the last movie you saw ? 
 Really ? I've seen that movie , too . 
 I thought it was pretty good . 
 You're kidding . The story and acting were outstanding . 
 I guess it could happen . 
 Here you go . I made up the burger patties for you . 
 I'll take over for a while to give you a break . 
 Then I'll tell folks the food's ready . Come and get it ! I've always wanted to say that ! 
 Don ’ t dress like that . You ’ ll make fool yourself . You look stupid in that robe . 
 Maybe it is . But it ’ s out of fashion . 
 Let ’ s go downtown and pick up some fashionable clothes for you . 
 Of course not , go ahead . 
 Well , sure it is . Actually , I have been cutting down the amount since two months ago . I used to smoke a pack of cigarettes for a single day . Now I limit it to 6 cigarettes a day . 
 Thank you for your suggestion . 
 What's your favorite sport ? 
 Indoors activities , such as chess and gymnastics . 
 Really ? Why ? 
 Really ? I am surprised . He doesn't look like a guy who'd ever cheat on his wife , does he ? 
 Well , I am really surprised . By the way , have you done anything behind my back ? 
 I like that joke , but I hope it's true . 
 You don ’ t like the dog ? I promise I will never bring it with me ! 
 I heard that too . She must be making a pocket . Well , good for her . 
 yes , she will . At the moment , the exchange rate is very favorable , so she should try to go as soon as possible , while it ’ s cheaper . 
 really ? I thought his parents had died several years ago . 
 dying can be very expensive nowadays ! What ’ s he going to do with it ? 
 I had some good financial news yesterday too . 
 no , but I got a pay rise of 5 % and a hours for all the hard work I ’ Ve put in recently . I think it was very nice for my boss to show his appreciation in that way . 
 You haven't spent much time with Sophia lately . Are you speaking to each other at the moment ? 
 But you two used to do everything together . I thought you really enjoyed each other's company . 
 Can't you hang out with them , too ? 
 Maybe you should invite her over for dinner , so it's just the two of you . 
 It can't be that bad . She was always a really good friend to you . 
 She's probably just excited about her new job . You should give her some time . It would be a shame to lose such a good friend . 
 I still think you two should try to patch things up . 
 Do you love me ? 
 Yes , but do you love me ? 
 Why didn ’ t you answer my question ? 
 Do you love me ? come on , I ’ m eager to hear . 
 Don ’ t cherish your words , dear . 
 Thanks for inviting me . And happy birthday , Julia . 
 How may I help you today ? 
 The copier is right over there . 
 We do charge to use the machine . 
 We charge ten cents a copy . 
 There is no limit to how many copies you can make . 
 Please read the instructions on the copier . 
 Hello , Mary . What ’ s the matter with you ? You look upset . 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry to hear that . I know how you feel . Please don ’ t be sad . 
 OK . Don ’ t let it get to you . Goodbye . 
 Yes , it has been a long time ! 
 I think that we last saw each other two years ago . 
 I have been going to graduate school at USC . 
 I am studying international communications . 
 I am counting on being able to get a good job . 
 I'm awfully sorry to have kept you waiting for so long . 
 My watch stopped and I didn't know . I certainly need to buy a better one . 
 There's no need to apologize . 
 Forget it . It was an accident . 
 Mine was ok , except that no one in my class speaks English . I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester . 
 That ’ s quite the array of nationalities . Everyone in my class is from Asia , except me . There are a few South Koreans , several Japanese , Malaysian , Thai , Singaporean , Filipino , Kazakhstan , and one Russian . 
 I guess so , but I think it ’ s going to be hard to relate to my classmates , especially with the language barrier . I think I might change classes . 
 I highly doubt it . Your girlfriend is Chinese . 
 Currently we are looking for business opportunities in northeast China . 
 We send analysts to companies that run into financial difficulties . 
 Smaller local companies . We specialize in trade & shipping industry . 
 Bob ! 
 Fine , just fine . And you ? 
 Guangzhou . I've got a cousin there . 
 Maybe he is trying to find a job . When he finds one , everything will be settled . 
 May I have your attention please ? 
 Well , my speech isn't very long . Would you please ... 
 Excuse me , are you Miss Green ? 
 May I introduce myself ? 
 I ’ m a new student in the school . My name ’ s John . 
 It ’ s a pleasure to meet you , Miss Green . 
 Yes , but I didn't really like the third one at all . 
 Yeah . Even though the customs were brilliant , I didn't think it was as good as the first two . What did you think ? 
 Did you read the books before you watched the movies ? 
 Yes , I've read them many times . I think it's much easier to follow for people who were already familiar with all the characters . 
 I also think that it was much better in the theatre than at home . 
 That happens a lot in non-English speaking countries . 
 Actually , they not only had 11 nominations , but they won 11 Oscars , too ! 
 I like it . But how did you know about my new job ? I wanted to surprise you . 
 Well , two weeks ago I got a tip about a possible job opening at Ace Travel Agency over on Franklin Avenue . 
 Well , anyway , I made a beeline over to their office , had an interview with the manager , and was told to start work the next day . 
 Right now I ’ m basically just a secretary , but if I ’ m given the chance , I want to become a travel agent there . 
 No , of course not . I ’ Ve got a lot to learn yet . In the meantime , I just want to be a good secretary and not step on anyone ’ s toes . 
 Hey , Jack , where's your car ? 
 Is that right ? This sure beats the old one ? 
 Ok . Boy , this looks expensive . 
 Wow , this thing can haul . 
 I believe it . Hoo , this car corners like it's on rails . 
 Wow , this car can really burn rubber . 
 You made a perfect choice , Jack . 
 Woo hoo ! This just might be the start of the rest of my life ! 
 I ’ m in the market for a job ! I went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until I got the names of a few employers I would like to work for . I have the resume I wrote for English class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write . I ’ Ve even done my research and found the names of the managers so I can address the letters personally . And you know I can be charming in interviews . Goodbye my penniless days ! Hello salary and a career ! 
 Oh , just for a position as a gas station attendant . You know , starting at a simple lowly job , just like all the greats before they made it big in the world . 
 But I ’ m just in it for the money , right ? How else am I going to be able to afford to keep taking Angela to the movies ? Besides , I love the smell of gasoline , don ’ t you ? 
 Hello , Helen , have you heard the news ? There ’ s been a horrible accident . 
 Hilda Harris husband , Henry had an accident on his way home from work . 
 Yes . He was taken to the hospital in an ambulance . 
 His car was hit by an express train . It happened at the crossing just behind his house . 
 He ’ s having an operation in the hospital now . Poor Hilda ! You can imagine how unhappy she is . 
 I hope so , too . 
 After all , he is a baby . 
 Alright , we need to have a plan here . First of all , which bed do you want ? 
 Alright . Do you have a coin ? 
 Heads . 
 Oh , well . So you get the bottom bunk . What about our stereos ? It looks like we both brought our stereos . Probably we only have room for one . 
 No , I don't mind . I just don't know where we can put the speakers in this tiny room . 
 Alright . That's a good plan . What about the desks ? We have two desks , one by the window and one by the door ? Which one do you want ? 
 Yes , I agree . 
 Alright . 
 Is that right ? 
 Well , I hope you let me hang out with you then . Maybe I can learn from you . 
 Are all lucky people so stuck up ? 
 Anyway , I get the desk by the window , you get the bottom bunk . That's it . 
 I will go get something to eat . You unpack first.Then , when I come back , I'll unpack . 
 let's go swimming . 
 I know , but I'm really hot . 
 Why are you so late ? 
 That's enough . Sit down . 
 I'm afraid I can't agree with you . 
 Simply because it's not practical at all . 
 Can't bear it , right ? I've been there before . I'll feel uncomfortable if no one calls me or sends me text messages , like there is something missing . 
 Actually , this is a kind of addiction called ' infomania ' or ' information overload ' . 
 Yes , it is . Do you consider a frequent check of your in-coming emails to be an integral part of your working day ? 
 Do you have your cell phone with you wherever you go and check text messages and phone calls from time to time ? 
 Do you open all your IM tools whenever you're using a computer ? 
 Now I can tell you're definitely addicted to the overflow of information 
 It depends . 
 Um . It ’ s delicious . 
 Not all of it . 
 Yeah , I'd better head for home . 
 Dad , I lost mum's necklace . I'm afraid she will scold me . 
 It is so kind of you , Dad . 
 Pardon ? 
 It's 9:30 . 
 Well you should have picked , in the end you always complain about everything . 
 I ’ m thinking of taking you back home . I thought we could have a nice evening , but you ’ re always so negative . 
 You see , that ’ s what I ’ m talking about , I can ’ t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore . 
 Well he ’ s more of a man than you are ; at least he appreciates love stories . 
 Don ’ t criticize Mario or else I ’ ll start on those fat , drunk friends of yours , they ’ re no saints . 
 You ’ re unbearable , you can walk home , I ’ m leaving . 
 Ok . Where should we go ? 
 Fine . I ’ ll be ready in a minute . 
 Why not ? China is a wonderful country . 
 No , I'm afraid not now . I'm too busy . 
 Yes . 
 Where should I sit ? 
 Who's Brad ? 
 When does the first period begin , by the way ? 
 Welcome to our university ’ s fifties anniversary , Sir . Please have a seat . 
 Thank you . 
 Certainly . Mr . Lee ’ s office building at the south end of the campus , just beside the library . 
 Let me show you the way . Please follow me . 
 My pleasure . 
 It ’ s up on the second floor . You have to use the stairs . The elevator isn ’ t working . 
 I'm Amy . How do you do ? 
 Certainly ! I suppose you dance often . 
 Yes , I'm glad I have come . 
 I like it very much . 
 Thank you . It's lucky that I have got a good partner . 
 I ’ m going to the beauty parlor . Do you want to come too ? 
 I want to have a foot massage and haircut . 
 Good idea . We should also pedicures and manicures . 
 I think it ’ s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . Don ’ t you agree ? 
 Maybe we should try a thai massage too . 
 That ’ s when the masseuse walk on your back and massage you with her feet . 
 I just love your hair that way . 
 Where did you have it done ? 
 Just yesterday . I'm still getting used to it . 
 Thanks . 
 I'm feeling a little under the weather . 
 No , he has mended his way . After his father died , he set his hand to the job of putting his business affairs in order . 
 You can ’ t imagine what he is like now . 
 That's fate . 
 Maybe this is God's will . 
 All kinds , but mostly Pop , rock and classical . Why ? 
 What kind of music is it ? 
 When is it ? 
 Yeah , I'd like to go . Do you think we should have dinner first ? 
 Let's eat at the restaurant across the street from my apartment . 
 Yes , that's right . You have a good memory . 
 Chips , finger foods , desserts , baked beans . Where're the pork and beef strips ? 
 Ah ... hence the buns and condiments we bought . And this is Holly's potato salad . 
 Let me know if I can help . 
 No , most of the traditional festivals of the minority nationalities are not official . 
 What an idea ! 
 Heineken and Budweiser . We have a two-for-one happy hour special . 
 Okay ... A pint of Heineken and and half a pint of bud for table six ! And what about some appetizers ? 
 Okay . That ’ ll be 80 bucks . 
 So you are green with envy at your neighbor ? 
 But I don ’ t envy those who are filthy with dough . That ’ s not the whole life . 
 Now that it ’ s the new year , I ’ Ve decided to turn over a new leaf . 
 You got it ! I have a new job , I ’ m living in a new city , with new friends ! This is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way I live my life . 
 Well , first of all , I ’ Ve decided to stop smoking . It ’ s not that I ’ m pinching pennies or anything , it ’ s just that I ’ Ve been smoking since I was sixteen , and I think it ’ s time to stop . 
 One last thing , I ’ Ve decided to come out of the closet . 
 Are you doing something on Saturday evening ? If not , welcome to my new apartment . 
 Yes , I have been busy emptying the packing boxes and cleaning up the mats . Right now , it looks like a home . I would like to have a small celebration party . Please do come . 
 It is in the DX community , Room 306 , No . 2 building . It is very easy to find . Just ask the guard at the entrance . 
 I invited all the colleagues in our department and also my former neighbor , Paul . He is a very good person . You should meet him . 
 Yes , great . I am happy you are coming . 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry . It completely slipped my mind . 
 Definitely , I ’ m really sorry . 
 Chicken ! 
 Sure , what time ? 
 For how many people ? 
 Western food or Chinese food ? 
 Do you want an expensive meal ? 
 How much would you like to spend for each person ? 
 Forty to eighty RIB Yuan a plate . 
 OK . Is there anything special you'd like to have on the menu ? 
 Anything you'd rather not have ? 
 How about drinks ? 
 Well . Dinner for ten at sixty Yuan a plate , drink's extra , at 8 o'clock tomorrow evening . Is that all right ? 
 My pleasure , see you tomorrow evening . 
 You're going to abandon me , just like that ? 
 Why are you so crazy about bird-watching ? What do you get out of it ? 
 Really ? 
 How was your vacation in Paris ? 
 When in Rome , do as the Romans do , they say . 
 Roman is living in Rome , of course . And go to work by car , or bus , or on foot . 
 Certainly . 
 Not always . But they like good meal . 
 How can I go there to have a taste ? 
 Hey , Joshua ! Is Anny coming with us ? 
 Nothing . I'm just asking . 
 Who has a crush ? 
 I'd totally die if she turned me down . 
 What's that book you have under your arm ? 
 How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn . 
 Is it really worth paying for ? 
 If it's any good , I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition . 
 You mean like a breast enlargement ? I don't think that's really necessary . That's not the way a woman should stay attractive . 
 Because ... I don't know . But , Connie , you wouldn't do that , would you ? 
 Maybe make-up would be enough ? 
 But what would other people think ? 
 I heard Rose is pregnant . I hope it'll be a boy this time . 
 After three baby girls in a row , Rose is under a lot of pressure from her in-laws.They want a boy in the worst way now . 
 I agree with you , but you know how old-fashioned the elders are . 
 Sounds like you will be doing some serious cramming till Friday ! 
 Why did you put it off until the last minute ? 
 Maybe you got your plate too full this semester ? You can change that next semester . 
 I'll say . The regular eighteen is just about all I can handle myself . 
 Do you really enjoy such dangerous sports ? 
 You are a real fan of extreme sports . 
 Honey , would you marry me ? 
 Please , honey , I have made proposals to you fifteen times . 
 Oh , god , please tell me how . 
 OK , I want you to be happy when we are together , and when you are sad , I would always stay with you . 
 Yes , I would . Thanks for being in my life . 
 My old man always harps on me . 
 But I can't bear it , John . 
 Yeah , but he really puts blame on me . 
 Nothing really . 
 What's on these days ? 
 That sounds pretty good . Let's watch that . 
 How about at the subway entrance . 
 Jenny , I want to go on a picnic . Could you come too ? 
 Then , put on your casual clothes and pack some food and beverages . 
 Sure . Bring enough films , please . 
 Ok ... I ’ ll talk to you later . Bye 
 I just got off the phone with my boyfriend . He is always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing . It ’ s so hard to talk to him at times . 
 Yeah but , he is always in a really foul mood . I try to find out what ’ s bothering him or get him to talk about his day but , he always shuts down and brushes me off . 
 I guess you are right . What do you think I should do ? He wasn ’ t always this grouchy you know ... 
 You are something else you know that ? 
 It's supposed to rain . 
 Well , it won't last long . 
 Thank you . No . I ’ m late for dinner at my house . I really have to go . 
 I ’ d appreciate that . 
 Thanks . 
 I had to look after my son at home . 
 He has a fever . 
 I think so.Thank you . 
 To be honest , I'm really fed up with work at the moment . I need a break ! 
 I have to work on Saturday all day ! I really hate my job ! 
 Yes , that's my only day off until Thursday . 
 That'd be fantastic ! Which beach are you going to ? 
 What should I bring with me ? 
 I can just use my beach towel . I love lazing around in the sun . 
 I've actually never tried . Do you have a surfboard ? 
 I can't wait ! It sounds like we're going to have a great time . How much money should I bring ? 
 Ok , where and when should I meet you ? 
 Are you sure this is the right restaurant 。 
 You don't think you could be wrong ? 
 I don't know . It looks a little wrong down . 
 You're hundred percent sure you want to eat here ? 
 Could you help me prepare for my presentation on Friday ? 
 I hate to ask you to do something like that . 
 When could we get together ? 
 Would you like to meet me at the coffee house next door ? 
 I'll come prepared . 
 But his wife has wide relations . You may ask her for advice . 
 She is pretty . Many men praise her highly . 
 I heard you were teaching English over there.Tell me about it . Did you like it ? 
 What were the schools like ? 
 But you taught children , yes ? 
 They actually study after school ? 
 Hmm . That sounds pretty oppressive for the kids . Don't they ever relax ? 
 Asian cultures value learning very much . I know that . 
 But aren't the kids tired out ? I mean , they go to school all day , and then they go to school in the evening too . 
 Are the kids in Taiwan very obedient ? 
 Hmm . I know you taught in Costa Rica also.Which did you like better--Costa Rica or Taiwan ? 
 the dinner was really good . It knocked my socks off . 
 great . Sweet wines are my favorite . They always make a great finish to a decisions meal . 
 port , please . 
 the port is exquisite . It must have spent years aging in barrels . Am I right ? 
 next time we are about to dinner we should try some Canadian ice wine . 
 it's made from naturally frozen grapes . 
 oh , here's to your health . 
 cheers . 
 Nothing planned . How about you ? 
 I'm always up for a drink . To tell you the truth , it's been quite stressful here too . 
 But we have to work tomorrow . 
 I hear ya . Let's do it . 
 What's changed ? 
 I see . I guess diapers and baby food are expensive.Bringing up children is not easy . 
 You should have more money then . 
 We came too early . There're still three hours before the performance starts . 
 Never mind . What about taking a look around the theater ? 
 Here we go . There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art . ( They come to the museum of the Beijing Opera art . ) 
 Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ? 
 No , no , no . They are all handmade , girl . You know , the ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework . 
 Very few can . That's why these clothes only appear in the museum . 
 Oh , yes . I heard there was an opera fans club . They are probably practicing now . Wanna have a look ? 
 Follow me . Make sure not to interrupt them . 
 I'm worried sick that she might leave me one day . 
 Tell me , please . 
 Anna , that outfit looks wonderful on you ! The color goes with your trousers perfectly . 
 Well , that dress certainly shows your good taste . It must have cost a lot . 
 Really ? You're an amazing bargain hunter ! Next time there's a sale , promise you'll let me tag along with you . 
 Well , how did you enjoy your seaside trip ? 
 Tell me about it , will you ? 
 Did you stop at the Fall for some pictures ? 
 You were lucky then . 
 What did you do after that ? 
 So you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday . 
 Where can I buy textbooks ? 
 Yes , I have that . 
 No , I don't know where the bookstore is . 
 Really ? How can I do that ? 
 No , I can't make it today . 
 No , thanks . I'm good . 
 I don't like the merry-go-round . 
 Ok , I guess it's worthy of two yuan . 
 Hey Lydia , what are you reading ? 
 What are you talking about ? Let me see that ... What are horoscopes ? 
 January 5th . 
 That ’ s bogus . I don ’ t feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense . 
 Well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ? 
 Oh , my god . How can you stand living in such a messy dorm ? 
 Have you even tried to clean it once since you moved in at the beginning of the semester ? 
 I think we need to restart the dormitory sanitation inspection system . 
 Then I'll take them . How much ? 
 Here is $ 150.Keep the change . 
 You too.Bye . 
 I'm sorry , It's all my fault . 
 Sorry , I had no intention . 
 I know I was an idiot , But if there is anything I can do to make up , Please do tell me . 
 To be honest , Ava , I've just had a really bad day . 
 First , I slept through my alarm and ended up two hours late to work . 
 He told me that if I showed up late one more time , he'd fire me . He's so mean ! 
 That was my second time . The first time , I was in a car accident . 
 No , he's from Australia . Before I met him , I thought Australians were supposed to be relaxed and easy-going . I had no idea he'd be so fussy about things . 
 I think I'm going to look for another job . I need to find a boss that is a bit more sensitive and optimistic than my current boss . 
 That's very generous of you . Thanks for the offer . 
 Victoria , you are back from vacation ! How was it ? 
 How come ? 
 Hello , Dora , I haven't seen you for a long time . Where have you been ? 
 What's up ? You look unhappy . 
 Oh , I know . Sometimes I have the same feeling with you . But you'd better not be so emotional . 
 Sure , no problem . You can call me any time you are alone from now on . 
 Not at all . We are friends . 
 Well , my roommate was friends with Amanda , so he introduced us . 
 Yes , he described her to me , and she sounded like my type . 
 I do sympathize with you , I assure you . 
 I hope your grandfather will recover soon . 
 He's a hero in our town . 
 Yes , indeed , People say he's the smartest young man . 
 He's such a buppie-a black yuppie . Black people come in all shapes and sizes . Just check out the party . 
 You'll find some of those here , too . But not if you don't shake it up ! There's an African saying , “ If you can talk , you can sing ! If you can walk , you can dance ! ” 
 What book is that ? 
 Canada , china , and the use are huge too . 
 Those small countries are microscopic compared to Russia . European countries are relatively small . France looks quite big in Europe , but compared to many countries in other continents , it ’ s not very l 
 The thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . Russia and Canada have enormous areas of ice and forest . 
 Sorry , I ’ m not a volleyball-fun . I ’ d rather play football . How about you , Mr . Wang . ? Are you interested in volleyball ? 
 Tonight is a party night ! What drinks do you think we need ? 
 I don't think we need too much in the way of soft drinks , Two super bottles of Cola should cover everyone . What about wine ? 
 No , once I fill the tub with beer , I'll get the ice . The beer will be cool if you put the tub under the ice . The cooler , the better . 
 Well , if you say so . Personally speaking , I'd rather die of thirst than drink champagne . 
 Hi ! Yes , it ’ s been a long time . I ’ m really glad to see you . 
 Just fine . How is everything with you ? 
 I ’ d like that , but I ’ m flying home this afternoon , and I told my parents I ’ d meet them at the airport for lunch . 
 That ’ s a deal . 
 Yes , I ’ m in Titusville . The space shuttle is launched from near there . I ’ Ve seen a lot of space shuttle launches . 
 The shuttle launches are beautiful . I saw one that took off at midnight . The whole sky got bright . 
 I ’ m pretty happy living there . 
 I ’ Ve been to all of them . 
 The Sunshine State certainly is worth visiting . Come down for a vacation sometime . I ’ ll take you to Disney World . 
 I hope you do . And keep in touch , OK ? 
 Here ’ s my business card . Send me an email once in a while . 
 Thank you . I ’ d better get going . I don ’ t want to be late for lunch . Mom would worry . 
 Take good care of yourself , Mary . 
 Bye-bye ! 
 What's the problem ? 
 That's easy . If I were you , I'd date me ! 
 But they are so silly ! They're not art ! 
 James Cameron , of course . 
 Well , nobody's perfect ! 
 Yes . I am interested in applying for graduate school in America . 
 Can you recommend some universities with good graduate schools ? 
 Oh , no . It's already February 5th . 
 I will think about it . 
 So what are you trying to say to me ? 
 How should I say it ? 
 It has only been 6 months , our relationship hasn't had a chance to maturate . We are still have some hurdle we have to jump over . 
 Last week I saw Brain kissing you on the cheek . 
 That is ok , then ? Starts on the cheek ? pretty soon you french kiss in the back on his car . 
 So is it ok if I kiss other women on the cheek ? 
 You see , we still have hurdle . 
 No , that would be too expensive . We used the train system.We bought a special pass called a Enrail pass . It lets people use the train wherever they want , as often as they want . 
 Yes , they do . I wish we Americans had a better train system . 
 I agree . And probably the automobile companies are too powerful.They never allowed the government to develop trains . 
 Americans love cars for different reasons , I think.One reason is that we are very individualistic.And cars are a very individual way of getting around.Americans like the freedom of driving around by themselves.They don't want to ride in a train or bus with a group of people . 
 Why do you say " have to " ? 
 Maybe you're right . They will have to develop alternative transportation.But it will be hard in America . Too many people are used to cars.Even in our movies cars are very important . 
 Do you want me to give you a ride ? 
 Alright.Well , I'll stay here and have another coffee . Nice running into you . 
 It's raining outside , Catherine , it's too bad.What ' s the weather like in your hometown ? 
 Do you like the weather in Seattle ? 
 Why ? 
 What about the weather in Boston ? 
 Is it very cold in winter ? 
 I'll help you with your homework . 
 That's a cool jacket . Where did you get it ? 
 I want to say goodbye to everyone . 
 I ’ m catching the nine fifteen train tomorrow morning . 
 You really don ’ t need to . 
 I hope so , too . Thank you , Lily . Thank you for everything . 
 Please say goodbye to the rest of the family for me . 
 Thank you . Remember to look me up if you ’ re ever in Washington . 
 Goodbye , then . Thanks again for everything . 
 I have met a beautiful girl . 
 Yes . At first sight . 
 At that time her back was ramrod straight as she sailed by , her tone is best , neither over-passionate , nor too cold . 
 She was pretty , her hair was the color of rich dark chocolate , waving gently to her shoulders . Her complexion was clear and golden . 
 He is in the bedroom and fallen asleep . 
 He ran four miles and came back dead beat . 
 What an attractive blouse , You look so pretty in this blue dress ! 
 It's very nice.It goes well with your skirt . 
 Not at all.This dress certainly shows your good taste . 
 What college are you attending ? 
 Why did you choose to attend that college ? 
 What kind of college is it ? 
 How do you like the play ? 
 You're absolutely right . I think the acting could be better . 
 Maybe you're right . But I really don't like it . 
 Yes , they had constant changes of scene , and I love variety . 
 Which team has won ? 
 But I still think AC milan's defence seems better organized . 
 I am really tired of Terry . 
 He is a bootlicker . I suppose that is because he is quick on the uptake . 
 I know ! I hate it ! But I ’ m taking this crash course in math . 
 I have to take my exams for getting into the university , so I need to prepare . 
 It has to ! I ’ Ve been studying every day , eight hours a day ! I don ’ t know , but the school has a great success record . 
 I ’ ll pick up an application form for you at school tomorrow . 
 Oh , yes . You ? 
 I thought it was better than the others-I really liked it.What did you think of it ? 
 Mmm . That's what I thought , too . And I always enjoy watching Anthony Hopkins . 
 Hum , Edward Norton , or something like that . 
 Mary seems depressed . What ’ s the matter ? 
 Poor girl ! 
 You did ? that is great ! 
 No i am free , i will be there , what time the thing starting ? 
 Ok , great , should i bring anything ? 
 sure , I will be happy to bring a few , what is the address ? 
 Got it . 
 No , but I heard about that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt didn't attend . 
 They must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood . 
 I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars . 
 I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but I don't think he won anything . 
 Yes , his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous . 
 People in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated . 
 That's true . I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go . 
 Being famous , I can do without , but I wouldn't mind being rich . 
 What ? What did you buy ? 
 What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? 
 And ? 
 And it's a brick ? 
 I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? 
 So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . 
 But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? 
 Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! 
 That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . 
 What do you like to do in your spare time ? 
 What kind of dance do you like ? 
 Great . I am not interested in Chinese chess . It is too difficult for me . 
 OK , I will try . As for stamp , don't you think it is an expensive hobby ? 
 I like gardening . I take care of them everyday . I like those flowers and the swing in my garden . If the weather is nice , I would like to lie on the lawn . 
 I've heard of ground-level ozone but can you explain what it is exactly ? 
 Sorry ? What does VOC stand for ? 
 So , what damage does ozone do to the environment ? 
 I heard Tom was caught stealing something again in the supermarket . 
 But the word is his brother would go bail for him . Last time it ’ s his father who went bail for him . 
 Do you have the day off today ? How come you're not at work now ? 
 Are you serious ? Why would they have to go to such extreme measures like a strike ? Doesn't your company have a pretty good corporate image ? I'll bet the folks at headquarters are going nuts over something as serious as a strike ... 
 Are you going to take the job ? 
 We ’ re going to the movies . Will you join us ? 
 Why not ? 
 Then would you like to have lunch with us ? 
 Would you like me to give you a lift ? 
 Come on . It ’ s no trouble at all . 
 What sports do you think women excel at most ? 
 I mean which ones are they better at than men ? 
 That's a good point . Let me change my question . What sports do women like best ? 
 Are you saying that women can't be generally categorized ? 
 I am going on my first date tonight . Can you give me some suggestions about what to wear ? 
 Yeah , that's a good idea . Let me try it . 
 Do I look more mature in the highheel shoes ? 
 I shall wear light make-up instead of heavy . The face powder will lighten my skin color . 
 Thank you . 
 Perfect ! Couldn't be better . 
 It's just what I want . 
 I am really pleased with it . 
 It's super . 
 What's the occasion ? You won the lottery ? 
 Well , I am kind of broke . 
 Really ? It's very nice of you . 
 Wonderful ! You know what ? I wish you wanted to relax everyday . 
 Do you mind retiring earlier ? 
 I do . I don't know what to do after I retire . I'd like to work till I drop . 
 Kobe Bryant , of course . 
 He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers , but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand . 
 indeed , no man can be perfect . He is just so-so in crashing the boards . Usually he plays shooting guard . Rebounding might not be his strong suit . 
 who wouldn't ! My friend Lee went so far as to get an autograph from him . 
 well , nothing more than a jumble of photographs . 
 Have you got the latest ONXIU magazine ? 
 What a pity ! I missed it again . 
 Yes , please . 
 Thank you . What shall I do when I check out these books ? 
 Thank you so much . 
 Study English . 
 It gives me great satisfaction . 
 I don't mind the work . I think it's worthwhile . 
 What is it ? 
 That ’ s just the short in the arm we need . 
 Yes . What do you want ? 
 What do you care , dork ? 
 You mean fat boy ? 
 Do you mind if I sit here ? 
 What are you studying ? 
 The final examination will be held at the end of this month . Have you made good preparation ? 
 Are you sure you can do well this year ? 
 According to what you did last time , I have my doubts . 
 He always likes to say something as if all his geese are swans . 
 Yeah . This is a clever way to be in contact with such a person . 
 You like to communicate with him ? 
 Yes , and would you like to have seats in the front or at the back ? 
 That's 35 yuan each . 
 Tarzan . 
 I am afraid not . Tomorrow is premiere . 
 Sorry . Was I disturbing you ? 
 Sorry . I guess I wasn't thinking . I won't do it again . 
 Absolutely ! Everything that ’ s thrilling turns me on . 
 What is it ? 
 Oh , never mind . I am just going to do the laundry today . 
 It really doesn't matter at all . I never did like it anyway . 
 I trust you ’ re keeping well ? 
 So we can get down to business . 
 Yes , that is a lot of choices . What is your favorite ? 
 I like chocolate myself . 
 I really don't like any ice cream with nuts in it . 
 Have you ever had garlic ice cream ? 
 It was . Let's stick with the regular choices today , though . 
 Oh , I feel ok but I ’ m still very tired . 
 I think so . One minute I feel quite awake , and the next I feel very tired . 
 Oh yes , I'm very interested in Chinese history so I ’ d like to visit the Summer Palace . 
 Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long 
 Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . Half an hour , tops . 
 True , I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on , even when you show up to class in sweatpants . Tell me , how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ? 
 Did it take you a long time to quit smoking ? 
 How do you do . I ’ m Mark Rancor . 
 May I know your name , please ? 
 Ah , yes . I remember now.Were you Mr . John ’ s dinner partner last month ? 
 I did but now I ’ m for Microsoft.How are things with you ? 
 May I know what you do ? 
 Sure.That would be great.Good luck . 
 You like Titanic ? That movie is so cheesy . 
 Really ? Well the special effects might have been good in 1997 , but when you watch it today they make the film seem really cheesy . 
 Actually , I have to admit that you're right . I like some pretty cheesy movies too . I love Arnold Schwarzenegger action flicks , especially " Terminator . " 
 Well ... I saw it only once , but for the next two months when I talked to people , I pretended I was the Terminator . 
 Yes . I am very interested in the Olympic Games , and I'm especially excited about 2008 Beijing Olympics . 
 That's cool . Care for a little quiz on that ? 
 Wow , you've talked the talk . Now it's time to walk the walk . Here we go . First , can you tell me something about the ancient Olympics ? 
 Good . Why do people name it Olympics ? 
 Who started the modern Olympics ? 
 What did people call him ? 
 What did he do for restoring the Olympics ? 
 Well , that's for all . Excellent ! 
 Can we go to the beach on foot ? 
 Is the bus station close by ? 
 I really should be on my way . 
 No , thank you . I can ’ t . 
 Thank you very much . I had a really good time . 
 That would be great ! Actually , can I get your phone number , Ella ? That ’ s assuming you don ’ t mind if I call you sometime . 
 ok , got it . I ’ ll call you sometime next week . 
 It ’ s time to go and I hope we can get together again soon . 
 May , could you bring this note to Professor Li for me today ? 
 I know . But attending Miss Li's class is just waste of time . No more than one third of her students will go to her class . 
 Yeah , my boyfriend plays the video game every time in class with me . Or I chat with my friends through text messages . 
 Right , so we must spare some time to attend selective courses . 
 What can I do ? I have things to do in Students ' Government . 
 Sometimes I will try various excuses . But this is my last time asking for leave . Or I will have a bad record . 
 I have been absented from many classes this semester just because of my work in the Students ' Government . 
 I am thinking about quitting my job in the student government . But before that , I must do my job . Bye . Don't forget about that note . 
 Do you know that working overtime in some companies is a regular thing ? 
 An average ten hours or more a day according to a survey , the worst thing is that the employees get no pay for that . 
 But these people say nothing about that . They are worried about losing their job because there is surplus in labor force these days . 
 Can we have two tickets for the 7:30 showing of ' Beautiful Mind ' . 
 What's on tomorrow at that time ? 
 Terrific , that's a wonderful movie , I like it very much . Can I get tickets now for tomorrow ? 
 Two tickets , please . 
 What would you like to be in the future ? 
 But if I were you , I would be a singer . You've got such a beautiful voice . 
 Are you sure about that ? 
 Didn't Joe feel it a shame to live on his parents since he has graduated from college ? 
 If I were him , I wouldn't brazen it out by asking my parents for money . 
 My goodness ! She is thirty seconds faster than the world record in 5000 metres race . 
 A Chinese girl has broken the world record in the Olympic Games . 
 You have to . It is sure . 
 I like small towns . 
 Not always , and there're also few cars ! 
 Veronica ! Veronica ! Veronica ! Are you OK ? 
 I will come clean as soon as we get to safety , OK ? For now , you have to trust me , please ! I would never do anything to hurt you . 
 I haven ’ t been completely honest with you Veronica , I ’ m sorry . I ’ m not a fireman . I ’ m not even from the United States . I ’ m a spy for the Indian government . 
 When I was a young boy , I used to play cricket my father back in my hometown of Hyderabad . It was a peaceful town , and my father was a renowned chemist . One day , he was approached by members of the CIA , claiming that my father had made the discovery of the millennium in his small lab back at the university where he taught bio-chemistry . I never saw him again . I vowed to discover the whereabouts of my father and consequently joined the Indian Intelligence Bureau . 
 I ’ m sorry , I wasn ’ t supposed to meet you . I wasn ’ t supposed to fall in love with you , but you have to believe me when I tell you that what I feel for you is real . 
 Veronica , wait ! 
 Sure . What's playing ? 
 Wow , it stars Catherine Zeta-Jones , my favorite actress . 
 She is so beautiful and elegant . And she is famous for her fine acting . 
 Who is the director ? 
 Yes , a legend , also . I still remember , his movies , Jurassic Park and Schindler's List got him nine Oscar awards in 1994 . 
 It tells a romantic and humorous love story . 
 He's too young for the job . 
 Happy New Year ! 
 Have you got any plans ? 
 My roommate's having a party . 
 I can play the piano a bit . 
 No , no . My playing isn't good enough for me to perform in public . 
 Thank you . You are cooking up a storm . 
 No , thank you . I'm afraid I can't take in anymore . 
 Oh ! I feel really under the weather . I ’ Ve got a sore throat and a bad cough . 
 Yes , I ’ Ve had lots of overtime to do recently and I haven ’ t slept much at all . 
 Yes , I think you ’ re right ! 
 Hi , Andy . 
 I did not sleep much last night . I really feel bad . It was a crazy night . 
 I had a bad dream . I was walking alone in the graveyard , and suddenly all the ghosts jumped out of their graves . They began to chase me through the graveyard and shouted that they wanted my blood . 
 My mother woke me up . She had heard me crying out for help . 
 I felt embarrased . After all , I am 18 years old . Mom gave me some chocolate cookies and a glass of milk . 
 Yeah , but i was afraid to fall back asleep . I am worrying about getting into the University of Michigan . 
 Hey ! That food was terrific . I can't eat another bite . Are you sure you don't want another dish ? 
 I know what you mean . I'm so full that I can burst . Shall we go then ? 
 You are welcome . 
 Part-timer ? Is that a new buzzword ? 
 Sure , I have a part-time job as a bartender . 
 Yeah , but I ’ m not there for fun . I have to remain professional and if I get distracted , the manager would be pretty upset . 
 Of course . There ’ s always much to learn . I got to know more about the real world . 
 Not just working experience . I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life . 
 Sometimes it is . But after working for a few weeks , it ’ s easy to figure out . 
 Maybe you can come to the bar one day and I ’ ll show you around . 
 Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ? 
 Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour . 
 That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ’ s eight time zones east of Greenwich ! 
 You wouldn't believe what happened to me today . 
 The teacher asked me to make a speech in English class and I wasn't prepared . He punished me by making me stand in front of the whole class . It was so embarrassing . 
 Yes , she does . She is good at backstroke and free style . 
 But she wants to learn the butterfly stroke 
 I heard you are now practicing underwater swimming , aren't you ? 
 Say , kid , keep on practicing , you're sure to be a first-class swimmer . 
 That's good . 
 How did he make a fortune ? 
 what do you think of studying abroad ? 
 yes , I hope so . I am studying for my BELTS right now . 
 I'd like to study in the UK , but it's really expensive . 
 yes , I received a conditional offer from Oxford University a few days ago . 
 I have to get an BELTS score of 7.5 overall . Do you think I can do that ? 
 I was also accepted into Yale University , and Sydney University . 
 I just can't decide where to go . It's not an easy decision to make . 
 You have drank dozens of cups . You are bound to get a bay window . 
 Mr . Lin , what are you interested in ? 
 Really ? I'm not much of an outdoor person . What do you like about it ? 
 Do you hike or fish on your trips ? 
 Did you catch anything ? 
 How about Joining our summer camp next week ? 
 Hey , Jim . I didn ’ t know you biked to work . 
 One less car on the road means less pollution . 
 How far is it ? 
 That doesn ’ t sound too bad . I wish I could do it , but I work in the city . So I take the train . 
 True . Well , see you tomorrow . 
 Did you hear about Neil ? 
 I hear that he's quitting . 
 I'm afraid not ! Now this is just between you and me . 
 Well . All right , Mark . Just this once . But you have to pick them up yourself . I ’ m a very busy man . 
 I ’ d rather you didn ’ t come immediately as I said I ’ m very busy at the moment . Come after lunch , Mark . 
 And then she made the deal with MicroPower . Vince wanted to sell for fifteen million ... 
 That's right . Vince still stops by her office every day to thank her . 
 You really should have stayed with us , Dave . 
 Me too . I get much more done when I am under the gun . 
 Uh , I don't know what to say . What do you want to know ? 
 Let me think a minute . I think I always try to take every chance to practice . 
 Well , I talk to myself . That is , I play one role first , then the other . 
 I am not convinced by your explanation . Could you explain it ? 
 I can't accept your excuse . It's five o'clock . 
 Ok , sounds good . But I think it's your trick . 
 Hello , Steven ! 
 Not bad . What about you ? 
 Why ? 
 How is your family ? 
 Where are you going now ? 
 OK , see you next time . 
 Hi , John . What brings you to town ? 
 What do you think of the traffic today ? 
 Yeah . You can say that again . It ’ s noisy too . 
 Which season do you like best ? 
 Why ? 
 I like spring , too.We can go for a walk and enjoy the fresh air . 
 Aha . I've read of my roommate . I made a move today . 
 You knew Brain Locker ? 
 Well , he's thin and tall . He has brown hair , a holt nose , green eyes and wearing glasses . 
 How are you doing today ? 
 What may I do for you ? 
 What do you need help with ? 
 Have you looked in the periodicals ? 
 I can show you where they are . 
 Follow me , please . 
 What do you usually do in your work time ? 
 Are you usually busy ? 
 What depends ? 
 Oh , I see . 
 Well , some people use a standard set of words , but many couples today write their own wedding vows . 
 It wasn't . It was birdseed . We don't throw rice anymore because someone discovered that birds come along and eat the rice and have trouble digesting it . 
 Wait until you see what happens next ! The bride is getting ready to throw her bouquet . Let's go over and watch . 
 She ’ s my friend ’ s ten-year-old niece . I guess there won ’ t be another wedding in this family for a long time . 
 I've been feeling under the weather recently . I caught a bad cold last week , and I still haven't got over it . 
 I guess so . Even though I seem to be over the worst of it . I don't want to give the bug to anyone in the office . 
 You seem to be in the seventh heaven . What's put you on ? 
 Did she give up her decision to marry Dick ? 
 Excuse me . Can you tell me how to find some books on social science ? 
 Yes . 
 So if I'm looking for a look called A History of Western Society , I'd just look under ' A ' . 
 What if I don't know the title of the book ? 
 Could you give me an example ? 
 Julia , are you free tonight ? 
 I want to invite you to go to the movies . 
 Yes . 
 Where do you want to meet ? 
 What time should we meet ? 
 All right . 
 Tomorrow ? 
 That sounds great . 
 OK . Dinner and a movie will be perfect . 
 How about 7 o'clock ? 
 OK . Bye . 
 Hey , there ’ s Leo . I wonder why he ’ s walking arm in arm with that young woman . 
 You ’ re pulling my leg ! She must be thirty years younger than Leo . Talk about robbing the cradle ! 
 It must have been love at first sight because I know he didn ’ t have a girlfriend last week . 
 Do you think maybe it would be better to just talk to Vince ? Explain the situation ? 
 I don't think so . Your admirer seems kind of sweet . Aren't you even a little curious about him ? 
 A little distraction might do you some good , Zina . 
 I'm sorry to have made you disappointed . 
 Was I ? Sorry , I didn't mean to be . I do apologize . 
 Forgive me darling . I'm very tired . 
 Pretty good , Sam . Only the awful weather , you know . 
 Me either , but I ’ m dealing with it anyway . 
 Sounds not bad ! You know , the only thing I worried about is the safety . I ’ m not an active exerciser and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport . 
 I will think about it . 
 What's that ? 
 Is that Hello Kitty ? 
 Is it real gold ? 
 what date is it today ? 
 look at the girls in the street . They all have bunch of flowers.Is it Valentine's Day ? 
 did you have a fight with Jack ? 
 come on , dear ! You forgot it , too . 
 is that your phone ? 
 wow ! good timing . 
 come on ! three's a crowd ! 
 just go ! it's Valentine's Day ! 
 Sure . I ’ Ve never seen a dragon boat race . 
 As long as I don ’ t have to row . 
 I'm sure you'll soon begin to like it.It ' s such an interesting subject . 
 Hi , Ellen ! How is it going ? 
 Yep ! Are you going to the rock concert Friday night ? 
 Sure . Would you like go with me ? 
 You ’ ll have to buy your own ticket though . 
 Wow ! When did you come into so much cash ? 
 not a single email until now ? it's already twelve o'clock . I can't believe it ! 
 yeah , that's right . If no one sends me test messages , I'll go crazy . 
 addiction ? checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction ? no way ! 
 absolutely . 
 yeah , it's a must . Otherwise , I may miss important phone calls and text messages . 
 yes . MSN , QQ , Skype , Google Talk , Ali wangwang , everything , so that I'll be in touch with all friends and relatives . 
 Mark . Where have you been ? I ’ Ve been calling you all morning . 
 What ? So you blew me off yesterday and today over a stupid video game ? What game is so important that you have no time for me anymore ? What are you playing ? 
 You ’ Ve been wasting your time on this ? I can ’ t believe it ! It doesn ’ t even look fun or challenging ! 
 Fine ! 
 Can you bring me something ? I am totally hooked on this game ! 
 He said his present job seemed to be a blind alley . 
 What did he say ? 
 It ’ s too good to be true ! If I were there , I would ask him if he himself was a successful man . 
 Nice dress . How do I look ? Be honest . 
 Well , that top is a little too tight , and those jeans aren ’ t dressy enough . And I don ’ t feel comfortable with that . What do you think , Vicky ? You ’ Ve been very quiet up to now . 
 You had better get a grab instead of getting upset about little things . 
 I think as long as you try your best and don ’ t think of anything too much , everything will be all right . 
 Let me see it . 
 It ’ s a letter from UCLA about my acceptance . 
 UCLA accepted me ! 
 I ’ m not joking . I got accepted ! 
 UCLA was my second choice , but I ’ m happy knowing I ’ Ve been accepted . 
 You have no idea how proud I am of myself . 
 I heard it might rain . 
 Mmm ... Well we could go to that new art gallery instead . 
 Maybe we ’ ll meet some of the artists too . 
 On balance , dress designing appeals to me most . 
 Say , how would you like to be a dress designer ? 
 How often do you use the internet ? 
 Yes . I use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . It can be frustrating when the connection is poor . 
 Yes , I like the job though . Sometimes , I help other people in the office if they ’ re having trouble online . 
 I think it ’ s fairly useful , but there are two big problems . First , a lot of the information you find online is false . Second , when you buy something online , you don ’ t see it until you actually get it . 
 What I do is find the website of shops . Then someone from our company visits the shop and buys when they ’ re seen that the products are genuine and suitable . 
 Right . With the establishment of Internet and a lot of web companies , people are getting more and more dependent on the web . 
 Can you tell me how it is done ? 
 I see . So great . 
 Fine ! How are you ? 
 I've come to tell you I'm going to the concert this evening.Will you come with me ? I've two complimentary tickets . 
 It will be held at the Music Hall . 
 It's a piano recital . I'm fond of piano , you know . 
 Yes . It's really wonderful here The grass is greener and the air is fresher than those in the city . 
 Great , let's go . 
 En , it's so beautiful that I don't want to move my eyes from it . 
 The same to me . All the things here make me happy , the mountain , the water , the grass , the birds , the sunshine ... 
 That's the point . We should walk into the nature and enjoy its beauty whenever we have time . 
 My mother and my wife are always holding different ideas . 
 You mean I should please her by following her suggestion . 
 Get changed ! 
 what a nice uniform ! 
 not really . I was being sarcastic . Does it come with the job ? 
 they're not actually that bad . They could be worse . What do you think about it ? 
 so are you enjoying your new job ? 
 how do you like working in sales ? 
 that's good . Have you met Jane yet ? She's the intern in the international travel department . 
 I know ! She could sell fridges to Eskimos ! 
 she's my cousin . 
 I don't know . I didn't think it was that interesting . 
 that's a good idea . Let's discuss after work . 
 This is very beautiful . Though I have to confess , I don ’ t know the first thing about farming ! 
 What was that ? 
 And that ? 
 What was that ? 
 Relax , that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable . 
 What do you base our grades on ? 
 Does the final count the most ? 
 How do you total our scores ? 
 What if we are out sick ? 
 How can we know if we are doing OK during the year ? 
 I watched a very interesting documentary about plants yesterday evening . It was called unusual plants and looked at several species of plants from around the world which have unusual features . 
 Well . There was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them . 
 No , it isn ’ t . it ’ s a pity , because I ’ d like to see it in action . 
 They showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee . The insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar . Other insects cannot get it . Of course , when the insect molle 
 That ’ s right . That ’ s one reason why it ’ s so important to protect every species . 
 According to the documentary , they have an incredible ability to find water supplies , however small , and then store them without losing much through evaporation . 
 I got the job you recommended me for last week . 
 I really don't know how I can thank you enough . 
 Thank you very much indeed.You helped me rebuild my self-confidence . 
 That would be great . 
 It's a man-made wonder . I've seen it many times in textbooks and it's part of my dream to visit it . 
 That's true . 
 What ’ s wrong ? That was a great goal . 
 Looks like you ’ re going to lose out on this game then . 
 What were the odds ? 
 Too bad . 
 Sorry , I can't . I have to work late at the laboratory . 
 My boss wants me to finish this project tonight . 
 He's very strict with us . 
 Indeed.He ' s strict with himself too . 
 I know ! It's gonna be great . But what kind of music do you think we should play ? 
 Hmm ... Vanilla Ice ? I know his most famous song , " Ice Ice Baby , " but I don't know his other songs . 
 What's taking you so long ? 
 I need you to hurry up . 
 I think there's more you need to do . 
 My hair looks awful . 
 I just don't like my hair . 
 I won't be paying you for this . 
 Honey , why are you so angry ? Can you tell me ? 
 Why do you say such words ? I love you very much . 
 Susan , just one last week I went out to have a lunch with her . There is nothing for you to be jealous about . I like your company much better than Janet ’ s . 
 Honey , you should know that I love you so deeply . 
 But honey , I think you ’ re terrific . There is nothing ... 
 what kinds of tv programmes do you enjoy watching ? 
 I like those kinds of programmes too . They ’ re very informative . I think that many people underrate the education value of tv . 
 yeah . And that ’ s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational ! 
 in my country , there ’ s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown . I think it ’ s about six minutes per hour . 
 no . they don ’ t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . Is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ? 
 some people have satellite and cable tv in my country , but people don ’ t seem to keen to pay for their tv programmes . Besides , the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programmes . 
 Bon voyage ! 
 Can you believe me ? 
 Please count on my love . 
 I'll be yours through endless time . 
 Thank you . I know I've nothing to offer you , but I'll never give you reason to cry . 
 My love will grow , like a river to flow . 
 I don't know whether we are in a dream . 
 Hi , Sara , what are you reading ? 
 Why ? 
 What for ? 
 That sounds cool . Do you mind if I recommend myself for the job ? 
 Yes , of course . But I only freelance on weekends with my uncle . 
 Please go ahead , I am listening . 
 Is your back door higher than the ground level ? 
 Okay , then you need a deck with a guardrail . 
 Don't worry . I will build your deck with a simple but classic look . 
 Cedar is a good choice . 
 Are you tired ? 
 It's late.It ' s high time I left.Thank you for a most wonderful evening . 
 Good night then ! 
 I'm going to try sky diving this weekend . 
 It's sounds like fun . 
 I want to try something exciting . 
 I'll tell you all about it next Monday . 
 Joan is a thorough drag ! 
 She keeps talking when I'm reading . 
 The results of the poll show Bill Clinton's approval rating has gone up in his second term . Do you find that interesting ? 
 That is exactly what the poll shows . Although the stating of Clinton as a person has gone down in the last two years of his term , his approval rating is as high as 66 percent . 
 But the poll says only 15 percent say he will be remembered as an outstanding president . 
 Chinese , maths , English , chemistry , physics , biology and so on . 
 To be honest , I like most of them , except for my Chinese teacher . She is quite young , but her class is too boring ! 
 Yes , my oral English teacher is an American . He is from a small town in California . 
 He is great . He always tells us not to study for exams , and to pay more attention to communication rather than just memorizing . 
 Not everything , but nearly . He speaks very clearly . 
 Absolutely ! If you come to our class , I am sure you will like him . 
 You should go to the library to find some information about American universities , and write to the Admission Office . Then the Admission Office will send you application forms and other related materials . From experience , many applicants write to several universities instead of just one . 
 That is true . I ’ ll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities . First of all , you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work , three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence , and the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It ’ s usually 550 ) . Then you need a financial guarantee , and an application fee of 25 dollars . 
 If they agree to enroll you , they will send you a TAP - 66 Form . With TAP - 66 , you can apply for a passport from our government , and then apply for a visa from the US . Embassy in Beijing . 
 From 3 to 6 months if everything goes well . 
 You are welcome . Please feel free to ask if you have any more questions . 
 Sure . Take a seat ... what would you like to know ? 
 That ’ s correct . It ’ s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in florida several years ago . The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case . 
 I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories . Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! I usually base my characters on people I have met . Most charact 
 Thank you . Let met sign it for you ... there you go . 
 There ’ s a real mix of stories in the book . I haven ’ t finished all of them yet , though . Many of them are short detective stories , but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones . If you give me your 
 This is my friend Jenny . 
 It's Snow . 
 They're blue . 
 It's brown . 
 She's 42 . 
 Not really , I like watching horror movies , like ' The Unborn . ' 
 I like horror movies because I like to be scared . 
 No problem , we have a short form right here ; just hand it to me when you are done . 
 That looks great , but I will also need your driver's license or other form of I . D . 
 Well , this looks nice . Do you know how to use it ? 
 Of course , just remember that all of the needed information is on the card . 
 Well , I hope you have a wonderful time on your library visits ! 
 I met her about one year ago . 
 That's right . We've been dating since last September . 
 Of course not . I'm afraid of them . 
 I'm afraid I'll feel sick at the sight of it . 
 During the weekend I often take the family out on short trips . 
 Yes , it helps me to relax . 
 I like to paint .  
 Mainly seascapes . 
 I like almost all sports , and I enjoy both playing and watching . I especially like tennis and mountain climbing . I was in the climbing club all through school . 
 Hello , my old friend . Long time no see . How are you doing ? 
 Not so well . To be honest with you , I broke up with Tom . 
 What can I help you with today ? 
 Do you have your library card ? 
 Would you like to apply for one right now ? 
 I ’ m going to need you to fill out the application . 
 All right , now please sign the back of the card . 
 That ’ s all there is to it . 
 How's your time spent in the United States ? 
 I'm glad to hear that . What impressed you most ? 
 You mean we Chinese think differently from the Americans ? 
 That's weird . 
 You really cared about your friend . 
 I'm confused . Why did he say that ? 
 Absolutely . Now I understand why he responded that way . 
 And he himself is very diligent . Considering all these , I think he has the ball at his feet . 
 It's time to leave the office for the night . Firstly I log off my computer , then I set the electronic security system . 
 Now I'll quickly send a short message to my wife and take the elevator down to the basement . 
 Yes , the car park is under constant video surveillance , so my car is quite safe . Please get in . 
 There's no need , I have keyless entry , and the steering wheel recognizes my finger prints before starting the car . Now , we can look at the navigation system to find the best route home . 
 Using GPS I can rely on this to direct me home . Now I just need to find my E-Card to automatically open the gate and we can drive out . 
 Maybe , but in the meantime why not help me find the remote control for my garage door ? 
 When I turn off my home alarm , the house will automatically tum on the lights and set the climate to a comfortable level . 
 Have any plans for the weekend , Tom ? 
 Oh , do you go hiking often ? 
 It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ? 
 Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike . 
 Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest . 
 Thanks , I ’ ll ask him . 
 No , not at all . Go ahead . 
 Yes . Is that so important ? 
 Yes , I have a three-year-old son . 
 Mark , this is Lucy . 
 I have a friend . He is my best friend and he wants to learn English . He would pay about 100 yuan per hour . Are you interested ? 
 So I take it you are not interested . 
 Don't worry . My friend says he can always arrange his schedule around your schedule . 
 Let's do it this way . I'll take him to your place this Saturday . Then you two can make a schedule . 
 How are you going to get there ? 
 I am sure my friend can give you a ride . 
 He is a lawyer . 
 See you . 
 Do you really ? 
 Well , I just think he deserves it . 
 OK . It falls on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month . It is said that there is a beautiful goddess Chang'E on the moon who had eaten some sort of elixir and had to depart her husband . She is always expecting to see her husband again . So , later we have the traditional idea that when there is the full moon , it is time for the family members to come together . 
 You are right . In China , ' round ' is an auspicious word . The moon cakes are in round shape . 
 It was not in the past . But from 2008 , we can enjoy a three-day holiday for this festival . 
 Morning . Can I help you ? 
 All you need is your student identification card to check out books . 
 That's all you need . 
 You can check out two books at a time . But you can't check out newspapers , magazines and periodicals ; they have to be read within library . 
 For two weeks . After that you must renew the books if you wish to keep them longer . 
 Yes , over there to your left . 
 I'm sorry . I don't think so . 
 It's much too hard for his age . 
 No , really ? 
 Who will be there ? 
 That is good . He can leave you alone this time . 
 They are my own flesh and blood . It ’ s hard for me to see them suffering . 
 Happy birthday , Lillian . Here's a little present I bought for you . 
 Hi Isabel ! You wanted to see me ? 
 Is everything okay ? You seem a bit preoccupied . 
 Okay ... 
 What ? Why ? I mean ... just like that ? I ’ m fired ? 
 What ! I resent that ! 
 Have you heard about Anlesen David ? 
 No , they got engaged . 
 Well , my dear . I didn't believe either . But got it straight form the horse's mouth . David called me this morning . 
 Last weekend , while they were on the Sik trip . 
 Next June . 
 How about going to dance this evening , Jane ? You will find that the night life of this city is very interesting ! 
 Yes , the dance hall is nice with various styles of music . 
 That's rock and roll with fast tempo . 
 Take it easy . The time for slow dance is the middle part of the party . 
 OK , follow me . 
 May I ? 
 ( When they are dancing ) You dance gracefully ! 
 No , I assure you . 
 Ok . 
 Of course . 
 I'll see . I will if I can but I won't promise . 
 Yes . But only if you ask me nicely . 
 Ok . I'll keep my promise . 
 He borrowed it from Nick . 
 He was too desperate to find some other way . 
 But it was her that makes us so embarrassed . 
 I don't care . 
 No . I ’ m serious . I ’ m going to quit my job . 
 It ’ s true . But I can ’ t show my abilities . 
 Your present job is something better . Why do you change ? 
 But Sue is indeed beaut . Men can hardly resist such a knock-out . 
 I know little of her . I only think she ’ s pretty and intelligent . Of course , she ’ s diligent , too . 
 I wish I knew who had moved our flower pots . 
 What did you think you were doing ? 
 How dare you be so inconsiderate ? That's wrong . 
 Never do that again . 
 She is so beautiful , isn't she ? 
 Julia Roberts . 
 It's said that her new movie is going to come out . 
 I'm not sure . 
 I already told you , because Julia Roberts is in it . I like her because she is not only a great actor but also is very generous to give a lot to many kinds of charities . 
 I hope the teacher decides to curve our test grades . 
 She did last time . 
 Could you tell me how to use the library ? 
 How many books am I allowed to check out at a time ? 
 How long can I keep the books ? 
 I see . Now I want to check out two books on spoken English . Can you show me where I can find them ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 How did you do that ? 
 That new Sony camcorder you've got is just beautiful . 
 I can see digital video products are quickly going mainstream with their plunging price . 
 Such as ? 
 They are very compact and are designed to be used with one hand . 
 What does this mean ? 
 I can transfer my home video clips from my camcorder to my computer for editing . 
 What special effects ? 
 That's great ! 
 So everybody's getting video mail . 
 Oh , just looking at these club notices . I'm thinking of joining one . Hey-why don't we join a club together ? How about the Tennis Club ? 
 Neither am I . It's just that the best-looking girls are in that club . 
 Well ... What are you interested in ? 
 Joanna , give me a break . 
 Sounds OK to me . I like movies . Hey , Joanna , look - there are a lot of decent-looking guys here . And the club jackets - they're really hot ! I think we made the right choice ! 
 And it's all coming down to the next three weeks . 
 Yeah , she is some kind of Superwoman , isn't she ? 
 So , Monica , what do you feel like doing this afternoon ? 
 That ’ s too bad . I hate sand storms too . It can be worse than any kind of bad weather . 
 It is not an easy job . The government is working on it . Lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital . Also , methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought . But of course , it will not work overnight . So , have you come out with a new plan for today ? 
 May I help you ? 
 May I do anything else for you ? 
 I can ’ t let you do that . 
 Our policy doesn ’ t allow anyone to check out the magazines . 
 You are only allowed to check out books or videos . 
 I ’ m sorry , but that ’ s our policy . 
 I've heard that Tom is going to move . 
 Yeah , he is going to move next month . 
 He is going to Canada and to live with his son . 
 Why did you say that ? It's a good thing for him to live with his son . 
 Me too . But anyway we hope he lives happily in the future . 
 The same to you ! 
 I thought about going to my sister's . How about you ? 
 Have you noticed the Mexican restaurant on the other side of this street ? 
 Yes , someone give me a pamphlet introducing the restaurant and its business hours when I passed by this morning . So , let ’ s have a try . My treat . 
 Good for you . Today we have more chances to try some new food because there are now many new form restaurants in our city coming from places all over the world . 
 Steve . Is that you ? 
 Not much . What a surprise to see you here . 
 What have you been up to ? 
 Really ? Where do you work out at ? 
 What do you mostly do during your workout ? 
 I should start exercising more . 
 I have a running machine at home . I used to use it , but I already got sick of it . 
 If I want to exercise , I will need to join a gym . 
 That's a good idea . Let's go over the weekend . 
 Aright . I'll talk to you later . 
 Anything interesting in this city ? 
 It's worth the time . 
 Is there anything wrong ? 
 Don ’ t worry . That ’ s just a part of being a teenager . 
 You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ’ t affect her decision . 
 Oh , she can make her own decisions . 
 The same to you , Joey . 
 It's very thoughtful of you . Wow , it is so beautiful . Could you tell me how American people celebrate Christmas ? 
 The teacher should give us more time to complete this assignment . 
 Good evening . I've come to see Miss Morrison 
 Oh ! I've just come back from Canada and I've brought a parcel from her parents 
 But you're busy , aren't you ? 
 I can leave the parcel with you , can't I ? 
 Brad , wait ! 
 How come you have a locker but I don't ? 
 I had to carry my backpack with me all day . 
 Does it have a lock ? 
 You didn't tell me she was married ! 
 I got carried away . I made such a fool of myself . They were both laughing at me ! 
 That guy was definitely a Don . 
 Yeah . If I leave Little Italy alive ... 
 Who is this on the water buffalo ? 
 Oh yes , that was the best job in most farm families . That's where many of them learned to play the flute . 
 That's interesting . Go on ! 
 So he became a self-taught man ? 
 In what field ? 
 Is he still in that that type of work . 
 Would you want to be a senator ? 
 I am not certain , but I think I might ask to be considered for the new job . 
 I think that I might like it , but I am still thinking about it . 
 I think that I would enjoy the position but there isn't a lot of creativity involved . 
 I am also wondering about the pay . 
 I am thinking that might be the case . 
 I was just thinking to call you , then the phone rang and it was you calling me . 
 Hello , Kevin . I hate to do this , but I have to cancel our appointment . 
 Yeah , I really wanted to come , too . But something unexpected in shanghai have come up . I have to fly out for a few days , but I'll be back soon . 
 I should have some free time next week . Say , next Wednesday evening ? 
 Yeah , I'm expecting to come back on Tuesday . 
 OK . 
 Hackneyed theme ! 
 Nearly everything . 
 Too easy questions . Listen carefully . Hollywood is the movie capital of the world.It is located in southern California . Many films have been made there , and the kinds have changed often . 
 Gangster movies . Movie-goers at that time could get a look at the people involved in crime and their violent activities by watching it . 
 After all that violence , people needed to laugh , so from the mid-to-late l940 ' s , many detective movies about policemen who solved crimes were made . Then came musicals . 
 Right . By the mid - 50 ' s , this light-hearted genre was competing with films about more serious subjects . There was one kind that could be found throughout all of these years , and that was the , mm , the . . . 
 Come on . 
 Any more ? 
 Hi , Bob . Can I have the book back I lent to you last month ? 
 Well , it doesn't matter . I almost forgot it too if it is not for Peter who asked me about it this coming . 
 Are you in a hurry ? 
 In that case , here , you go first . 
 Thanks , Tim.Nice meeting you , too . 
 Ye , I hope so.well.Take it easy . 
 How good are you at sports , Bill ? 
 Wow ! 
 Oh , yes . I like to exercise . But I don ’ t watch sports or buy sports magazines . I don ’ t have much time to do those things . 
 Well , I guess I exercise about two hours a day . I do aerobics three times a week , and the other days I play badminton 1 with my husband . I always feel good afterward . 
 Well , why don ’ t you try to get some exercise ? It ’ s difficult , but very rewarding . 
 Alice , your father is amazing . He ’ s 90 years old and he lives alone in that big house . 
 That sounds like my Grandmother . She was always stubbornly independent . 
 They see their independence as a kind of character strength . 
 This little wooden stick is called a tee . 
 For the first drive , put the golf ball on the tee , and push the tee into the ground . 
 Pick up a wood and hold it like this , interlocking your fingers . 
 Position yourself , swinging the club , watch the ball and hit it as hard as you can . 
 Not too bad . The goal is to get the ball into the hole with as few hits as possible . 
 Excuse me . Is anyone sitting here ? 
 You don ’ t mind if I smoke , do you ? 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry . But this isn ’ t a no-smoker , is it ? I mean would you mind if I smoke here ? 
 Sign ? What ’ s sign ? 
 Oh , sorry . I didn ’ t notice it . Sorry . 
 Are the ceremony and reception held in the same place ? 
 Where do they go ? 
 They go to the home of the bride ? 
 The Chinese custom is to go to the groom's home-just the opposite . 
 That's very expensive for the family of the bride . 
 Tell me something about the bridal bouquet . Isn't it the custom to throw it ? 
 Maybe I'll be the one . 
 What ? 
 You must be joking ! 
 Give me a break . You don't care about the colors . You just like the hot babe on the cover . 
 Of course . I'm currently the subscriber of 10 different fashion magazines . 
 I guess I'm lending them to you ... 
 Where to ? 
 Hold on ! I can't afford to pay for both . 
 Gee , that's really nice of you . 
 Hi , Debbie . Have a seat . How's it going ? 
 Pretty good . Listen ... have you heard about the new Thai restaurant over on University Avenue ? 
 That's the one . A bunch of us are going there for dinner tomorrow night.How about coming with us ? 
 Great . I'll call and make reservations . 
 All right . I'll call you tonight and tell you the time . 
 Mr . Lee , I was wondering if you and your wife had plans for next Friday night ? 
 I've mailed a formal written invitation to your home inviting you to a dinner party at my home . 
 Actually , we thought it would be fun to have a formal sit-down dinner for the holidays . 
 Yes , we've invited four other couples , so it should be a good mix of people . 
 Oh yes , everyone we are inviting is from our company . 
 Do you know who that tall man is ? 
 Why ? 
 You are blue in the face , arn't you ? 
 But supposing your son killed like the fish , what do you think then ? 
 So beat the cat , but don't kill it . 
 Yes , He had just bought a new motorcycle . 
 Yes , I tried it and I quite liked it . 
 Sure . But I still liked it . 
 No . Although motorcycle is nice , I ’ d like to buy a bicycle . 
 Because bicycles are safer . 
 Really ? That ’ s marvelous ! 
 I ’ Ve made up my mind not to be beaten again . 
 It's an excellent one . I like it very much . 
 It includes a lot of useful words and phrases . 
 How do I buy my textbooks ? 
 Yes , I have my list . 
 Yes , I know where the bookstore is . 
 No , I didn't know I could do that . 
 Yes , I am going today . 
 Yes , thank you . That would be great . 
 Is there anything wrong with your food this evening , Miss ? 
 Sorry , Miss . I'll place it immediately , can I get you another drink , or you wait ? 
 I'm sorry , Miss , but I'm afraid we can't do that . You'll order something else instead . I'd love to suggest the steak , it's the special today , and quite tasty . 
 Ok , Miss . I hope you enjoy the rest of your dinner . 
 What ’ s wrong ? Slow down or you are gonna give yourself a heart attack . 
 Take it easy ! Let ’ s go to the mall , window shop a little and see if there is anything she might like . 
 That ’ s where you ’ re making a big mistake ! You can ’ t just guess peoples ’ likes or sizes ! Especially with clothes or jewelry . On top of that , I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her . At the same time you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like ! 
 Yeah , tell me about it . I know ! Your mom is trying to learn Spanish , right ? Why don ’ t you get her a gift certificate for this great website I saw called SpanishPod . 
 Do you do morning exercises ? 
 Shadow-boxing ? How interesting ! Do you think it really helpful for your health ? 
 He loves that blonde girl . 
 Did she accept it ? 
 Would you recommend some places for sightseeing ? 
 Is it worth seeing ? 
 I just got a telegram from Margaret and Greg . 
 Yes . They ’ re coming the beginning of August . 
 I ’ m glad they ’ re coming in August . Maybe Greg and I can play some golf or get tickets to a baseball game . 
 Remember the garden party they gave when we were in England ? 
 I had a great time . It ’ ll be good to see them again . 
 Yes . By the way , you are having a great make-up today . I like the color of your lipstick . So adorable ! 
 Well , girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things . Actually , do we still have a meeting this afternoon ? 
 I like the kid . He's so lovely . 
 Twelve . He's very sensible for his age . 
 I bet my button dollar that he won't . He is no more than a nine day's wonder . 
 Many people like him get a flying start but soon disappear . 
 Oh , yes . I got so tired . My son began to cry the moment we got on the train . It was very embarrassing because we took the over-night train and the noise made it difficult for other people in the cabin to sleep . 
 Yes , we did . Fortunately we put his Teddy Bear in the bag , and finally he fell asleep at mid-night with it in his arms . 
 My wife didn't like to go to amusement parks , so we compromised and finally went to the seaside . I think vacation in summer is not good . 
 Yes , he was every excited to see the blue sea and picked up many seashells to give as gift for his classmates in kindergarten . 
 And I taught him how to swim in the sea . It was fun and made him braver than before . After we returned home , he wasn't afraid to sleep alone in his bedroom . 
 You do ? 
 No way ! That's great ! Then we'll still be together ! 
 No kidding ! I can't believe this . You devil ! 
 Life's so boring . 
 What do you think will make you happy ? 
 You heard people say that money doesn't guarantee happiness . 
 You'll get bored eventually . 
 That's true , I guess . If I didn't have to work , I think I would be happy . 
 Have you signed up to join the company ’ s Christmas party ? 
 I will . You know , as a newcomer , I think it might be a good opportunity to get to know people from the other departments of our company in a more relaxed atmosphere . 
 I hope that it is not a formal one when the boss is there . 
 Don ’ t worry , I can handle that . And I know if the boss is there , even it is an informal evening , it does not make a good impression to get totally drunk in front of him . 
 You mean that he is bad-tempered and often gets angry with you . 
 I have never you mention this friend . Are you on very good terms with him or her ? 
 You must be stuck on her , or you would not use your elbow grease . 
 Crossed cousin marriage is not allowed in China . 
 You know why ? 
 Hello , Susan , it ’ s me , An . 
 I am fine . I am going swimming this afternoon . Are you coming with me ? 
 Maybe I can meet you at the club and we can play tennis together . 
 Do you have girlfriend ? 
 Well , I came to know a girl three weeks ago . We have so much in common . 
 So I think I may fall in love with her . 
 Then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in real love ? 
 That's what I do . 
 Yes . 
 That's it . She likes dogs so much now , and I begin to love dogs . 
 Thanks , but I know falling in love is one thing while staying in love is another . 
 Yeah , falling in love is so good . 
 I just bought a new atlas . I ’ m looking this map of the world . Look at Russia ! That ’ s a vast country . 
 There are several tiny countries in the world too . Countries like Monaco are smaller than many cities . 
 Britain is half the size of france , but great Britain is still one of the largest islands in the world . 
 So Peter , do you have a favorite comedy ? 
 You know what comedy I really like ? " Ace Ventura , Pet Detective . " I think Jim Carry is really funny . 
 I agree . But even though I like comedies , I usually prefer more serious films . My favorite movie is " Titanic . " 
 It doesn ’ t matter to me . 
 Either way . I don ’ t care . 
 I couldn ’ t careless . 
 Whatever you say . 
 I don ’ t mind if you want to . 
 Do you have enough money to buy that dress ? 
 Sure , here you go . 
 Yes , I do . I am the oldest child . I have a sister and a brother . My sister is in college and my brother in high school . 
 We get alone very well . 
 Rather difficult . How about you ? 
 Rather . I'm afraid I didn't do very well . 
 That's because you did well . 
 Why ? 
 I think that the company retreat should be in the mountains this year . 
 January would be a good month for a mountain retreat . 
 You know , now that I think about it , you might be right . 
 That is a good suggestion . 
 Yeah , that would let us know what would work best . 
 I think he won't remember White Day . 
 Uh-huh . How about you ? 
 You got a big return for a small gift . 
 Wow that ’ s great news ! They ’ re a great couple ! 
 You aren ’ t going to a strip club , are you ? I don ’ t want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it ’ s your friends party . 
 Well , I don ’ t know . 
 Good , because my friend Wendy is getting married and I ’ m organizing her party ! 
 Hi , what ’ re you reading ? 
 No , not that one . But I saw the movie . Could I borrow it when you finished ? 
 Oh , I ’ m crazy about them . 
 Oh , darling , we must stand shoulder to shoulder and face the music . I know you can pull yourself together . 
 Cheer up . You have got me at least . 
 No . What did it say ? 
 A garage sale ... that's where people check out cars , right ? 
 I'm pulling your leg , Paul . I'm a shopping queen , remember ? So of course I know what a garage sale is all about ! 
 How many different varieties of products do you import from China ? 
 Do you import any food items ? 
 We still have one more day to go before we return home . What will we see tomorrow ? 
 What about a factory tour ? 
 Yes . I heard there's a lager motor company nearby which is open to the public every weekend . We can go to see how a car is manufactured and learn more about the automobile industry . 
 I'm not sure , but as far as I know , most factory tours are free . They are sponsored by the company providing the tour . 
 I believe most of them think it as good public relations . They can promote their product and make their company better-known . 
 Exactly . 
 I'll call the tourist information centre to check . 
 Thanks . 
 Actually , i could you some help.Thank you so much . 
 Are you still on your summer vacation ? 
 When will school start ? 
 I just had a terrible week . 
 I fell down and hurt my arm . 
 Then my son drove into a tree . 
 The dog bit the delivery boy . 
 And a storm blew our roof away . 
 Good evening , Mr . Wu . 
 Have you met my wife , Mary ? 
 Mary , this is Mr . Wu , my new Chinese friend . 
 How do you do ? 
 This is my house.Let me show you around it . 
 Follow me to the back-yard . 
 We had the grass cut and the flowers trimmed this morning . 
 Here is the swimming pool and we can swim later . 
 You mean it shuts off to save energy ? 
 It's not breathing ! 
 Jen , it's not alive ... but it does look user-friendly . 
 And you'd look so cool ! 
 Yes , I am studying in Eastern Asian language department . 
 I major in Japanese . 
 It's very helpful . The course has let me into a new world of literature . I read so many great literatures . 
 Maybe they are still wet behind ears . 
 Sure . Many people , including men and women , and be easily ripped off . 
 ( quietly ) I don't understand what the teacher is saying . 
 That's terrible . He speaks too fast . How can I catch his meaning ? 
 I'm not sure whether I can pass the course or not . 
 I heard that too . She must be making a pocket . Well , good for her . 
 Yes , she will . At the moment , the exchange rate is very favorable , so she should try to go as soon as possible , while it ’ s cheaper . 
 Really ? I thought his parents had died several years ago . 
 Dying can be very expensive nowadays ! What ’ s he going to do with it ? 
 I had some good financial news yesterday too . 
 No , but I got a pay rise of 5 % and a bonus for all the hard work I ’ Ve put in recently . I think it was very nice for my boss to show his appreciation in that way . 
 Julia , I saw two men fighting beside our door this morning . 
 Brothers ? Do you know why they quarreled ? 
 Is there anybody acting as mediator in the dispute ? 
 I think I'm going to go home . 
 I know , but it's 12 
 Three or four o'clock ? 
 I never stay out that late . That's too late . 
 Were you so wild when you were still in Taipei , Sharon ? 
 What is that they're doing on the couch ? 
 Pot ? Isn't that marijuana ? 
 But , Sharon , that's illegal ! The police could come , and we could go to jail . 
 Really ? 
 I didn't know you had such wild friends . Do you smoke marijuana too ? 
 I don't want to . 
 I don't know if I can drink more . I already had two drinks . 
 I thought a university was for studying . 
 Alright . I'll have another drink . 
 Well , things are all right . 
 Yeah , Bob moved in last week . He is a nice guy and so far everything is cool except this girlfriend . 
 She came over last weekend . She is a nice girl but there's something about her voice that really creeps me out . I tried to smile and be polite , but the whole time all I could think was " what's wrong with your voice ? " 
 I doubt it . Last time was an oral train wreck . Listening to her talk is like chewing tin foil . 
 No , it's so much worse . And tonight they invited me out to dinner . I really have no idea how I'm going to pull it off . 
 That's the plan . 
 Hey . Why did you take that money ? You are such a cheater ! I should send you to jail ! 
 Well you can ’ t just take the money . You have to ask the bank for money . And I ’ m the banker . 
 Yes ... 
 Sure . Here you are , $ 200 , Thank you , please come again ! Now it ’ s my turn to roll the dice . 
 Yes , is that you , Allen ? 
 Not bad . 
 Sure.Thank you very much . 
 Ok , see you . 
 David , do you think which team will get the champion tonight ? 
 I am so nervous now . What a terrific game ! 
 It's hard to say , because each team has my idols . 
 I will never forget this match . The angle is so terrible and so correct . 
 There are lots of new teachers in our class this semester . 
 To be honest , I like all of them , except for the math teacher . Though he must be quite young , he seems like an old person . He's so boring . 
 It might be the English teacher . What about you ? 
 She is a pretty good teacher ! With her help I think I can make great progress in English . 
 I think it's a good way to develop our language ability . 
 Don't cover up your sadness . Let it go . 
 It isn't your fault . No one will blame you . 
 Can you recommend a resort to me ? 
 Have you ever been there ? 
 What is especially impressive ? 
 Is there a waterfall ? 
 What an attractive place ! How can I get there ? 
 Bobby ! Come here , look what I got you ! 
 A chess board ! Daddy is going to teach you how to play ! 
 Ok , each player gets 16 pieces . You can be the white ones and I ’ ll play with the black pieces . Now in the front , you set up the pawns . Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . When you are about to capture another piece , it can move one space diagonally . 
 See this one that looks like a tower ? It ’ s called the rook . The one with the tall hat is called the bishop . See this little horsey ? This is called the knight , it ’ s a very important piece so it ’ s best to not let your opponent capture it . 
 That ’ s right ! That ’ s the queen and that ’ s the king . If the other player captures your king , he will say Check Mate and the game is over ! Doesn ’ t this sound fun ? 
 Hello , Elitherbeth How are you ? 
 Are you sure you ’ re alright . You look a bit worry today ? Is anything wrong ? 
 of course if I can . 
 Oh dear . That ’ s terrible . What was in your wallet ? 
 Well , If I were you , I would go to the police station straight away and calling . 
 Oh dear . What a pity . Are you sure you lost your wallet in theatre ? 
 I think you should put an advertisement in china daily . Things where you lasted . 
 Wait a minute , My uncle lives in Beijing and he lives very close to theatre . I ’ Ve telephone here and ask him to go to theatre to require it . We ’ d better have breakfast now . and meet him later . 
 Yeah it's too bad ... but actually I think I know what to do . 
 We can go to a horror movie , and I'll hold your hand so you don't get scared . 
 Of course ! Or are you still too scared ! 
 Oh , it's getting late . I've got to run . It was nice talking to you , karren . 
 I guess we'll see each other around . 
 You too . 
 He's in the hospital resting . The doctor's didn't give a clear answer yet . 
 I hope so . 
 Yeah . I think my mom is the most worried . I'm basically worried about how she is doing . 
 She's in the hospital with my dad . I have to go back tonight . 
 You don't have to . 
 Ok . Let's go right after dinner . 
 Well , black is a better color than pink . Pink ’ s for girls . 
 Because ... oh , all right . You win . Let ’ s pay for them and go . 
 I'm really sorry , Bob . I accidentally damaged your bike . 
 I'll make it up to you . Let me know how much it costs and I'll give you the money . 
 Well , my sister is a lawyer . 
 Yes , she does . But she's working in Washington , D . C . , right now . Her job is top secret . 
 He's a painter . He's working in Argentina this month . He has an exhibition there . 
 What do you do now ? 
 Why ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . 
 What's your plan now ? 
 Best wishes for you . 
 Your face is so red , you must running a temperature . 
 Please go to see a doctor . 
 He got the scholarship to Harvard . 
 It's true . He is a hard worker . 
 What happened to you yesterday ? 
 Oh I see . So that ’ s why you didn ’ t come in ? 
 Oh dear , that sounds terrible . 
 Oh dear . Well , get well soon and try to be more careful in future . 
 OK . Shall we go to a bar ? 
 Why ? 
 Don't you think it ’ s too noisy here ? The rock music ! I can hardly bear it . 
 Well , I'll try . Then what would you like to drink ? It's on me . 
 What ? 
 nothing . 
 Yes , I am . 
 I don ’ t actually know him . 
 I only know him through the ... you are not gonna believe this . 
 Yes . 
 Happy Birthday ! This is for you , Kate ! 
 You know in China we usually don't open presents until the guests leave . 
 This place is so quiet and peaceful . It ’ s really different from my pad at city . 
 I don ’ t know . I don ’ t mind coming out here for a while , but that will get old pretty soon . 
 I think I ’ d go lonely if I do like that . 
 Now that would be hard to live without . We city folks are pretty spoiled . 
 I don't stand a chance of passing the exam . 
 Have you ever been to Britain ? 
 Really ? How often do you go there ? 
 Do you always go on business or do you sometimes go for a holiday ? 
 I plan to emigrate to Canada . 
 No . But it is said the welfare in Canada is very good . 
 Maybe you are right , so I will try my best to find a suitable job . 
 OK . When ? 
 10 in the morning ? 
 Sorry , that's too late . I usually go to bed around 10:00 PM . 
 No , that's too early . I'll still be at work then . 
 That's fine . 
 Alright . Bye . 
 Yes I have . I ’ Ve been there three times in the past year . 
 No I haven ’ t . I haven ’ t visited the Bund either . I ’ Ve always had too much work to do . 
 Actually , I ’ Ve eaten soup dumplings in a lovely restaurant on Nanjing Lu . They were delicious ! 
 Oh , yes . I really like it here . 
 Sure . I'd love to . 
 Yes . I've already been to several clubs here . 
 Uh , actually , I've gone twice this week . 
 Well , I haven't been to the theater in a long time . 
 Great ! Let's make a reservation . 
 I love just about anything by Prince . 
 well , I like all kinds of music , but he is one of my favorites . How about you ? 
 do you have a favorite band ? 
 do you often go to concerts ? 
 I love going to live gigs . Are there any good local bands playing around here that you'd recommend ? 
 I'd love to , but I have a night class on Thursdays . 
 let me know if you hear about any good bands playing on the weekends . I have more free time then . 
 sure , what's on ? 
 that sounds dreadful ! 
 What do you mean ? 
 What style do you want ? 
 Exactly how short do you want it ? 
 Are you sure you want me to cut it that short ? 
 Okay . I'll do it if you're positive that this is what you want . 
 All right , then let's begin . 
 The agriculture in New Zealand is highly mechanized . The industry mainly focuses on the manufacture of agriculture and stockbreeding products . 
 If you need any further information , please don't hesitate to ask me . 
 How are you , Sue ? 
 Congratulations on your success . 
 And how ’ s your brother ? 
 He ’ s going to be sent to Britain to study , really ? 
 Fantastic ! Please send him my congratulations . 
 How long have you been in Taiwan ? 
 So , where did you grow up ? 
 I am not sure , where exactly is it ? 
 No , I was born in Gaoxiong , I only moved to Taipei after I graduated . 
 Look at me . I look so old ! I look as if I were thirty . 
 Yes , I am , but I think it ’ s time for some plastic surgery I ’ m tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin . See ? 
 Whatever , I think I ’ m gonna get liposuction and a nose job and some breast implants as well . 
 I thought you were my friend and would support me on this ! I just want to feel better about myself and feel more attractive . 
 Really ? 
 What time is it by your watch ? 
 It's 2:42 by my watch . But it moves a bit fast . 
 So how much should I gamble ? 
 Okay . One-hundred then . Do you think I will lose it ? 
 I want games that are all luck . 
 Slot machines ? No , I don't want that ! That's too boring . I want a game with cards or dice . 
 Blackjack.We can play blackjack . And I will gamble one-hundred , or maybe two-hundred dollars . 
 Oh , don't be so strict ! We are in Las Vegas . 
 I just won the lottery . 
 I didn't expect to see you at this hour . You must have goofed off again . 
 You'll be sorry if you the boss finds it out . He may probably give you the bag . 
 Professor , I've handed in my paper . Did you read it ? 
 What about water pollution instead of pollution ? 
 Look , it's all water over the dam now . Let's leave it behind us . 
 Our eyes should look into the future . We could not live in the past . 
 It's normal . Time will change everything . 
 I don't think I share your view there.The writer is writing about history , society , human nature and so on.It ' s too hard to understand . 
 Are you kidding ? I ’ m terrible ! But I love to watch sports . I go to football or baseball games a lot . And I read sports magazines every week . 
 Do you like sports , Janice ? 
 Oh , I see . You know , we spend time doing different sports . How much time do you spend exercising ? 
 That ’ s great ! I ’ Ve heard people say that before . 
 Oh , I ’ m too lazy to play sports , and I ’ m not good at anything either . It hardly excites me . 
 I see . But Jane . He ’ s not worth your sorrow and you should restart your new life . 
 The early bird catches the worm . 
 I would like to use the copy machine . 
 Do I have to pay to use the machine ? 
 How much ? 
 Am I limited to a certain number of copies ? 
 Could you show me how to use the copier ? 
 That ’ s fabulous . Thank you . 
 What a surprise ! This is the best present I've ever received . 
 I love you , too . 
 Actually , I prefer to eat at home , and then we'll have more time to have a chat . 
 What do you know about Julia Roberts ? 
 I mean her personality . 
 How's the weather today ? 
 I really don't think this weather will last . 
 Nice day today , isn't it ? 
 We can't complain about the weather recently . 
 I wonder how long this weather can last . 
 Excuse me . Do you study Chinese at the university here ? 
 It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing . 
 Yes , I am . I am from Taiwan . I came here to study political science . 
 I like it so far . But my English still needs work . 
 Does the Chinese department here teach regular characters or simplified characters ? 
 I see . I'm from Taiwan , so I know regular characters better than simplified . 
 Yes , that's true . Especially my writing . I think my papers aren't good enough . I make too many grammatical mistakes . 
 You mean you and I ? 
 That sounds like a good idea . How often would you like to do it ? 
 How would we manage it though ? How would we spend the 90 minutes ? 
 Would I help you with writing ? 
 I think it sounds like a good system . But when is it convenient to meet ? 
 Me too . In fact , I'm free until 1 
 It sounds good . I will bring the papers I'm working on . 
 Let me give you my phone number . 
 could we possibly discuss my salary some time ? 
 first of all , I want you to know that I really like working for this company . Do you think I'm doing a good job here ? 
 I try very hard . The problem is , my salary just isn't enough to live on . Now that I have a wife and a child to support , we hardly have enough money for food and rent . 
 I could really use a 5 % rise . 
 listen , if you give me a raise , I'll take on extra responsibilities . 
 that's fine . Do I get over-time for any extra hours that I work ? 
 that sounds good to me . I really appreciate it . 
 Your knowledge of English is really surprising . 
 No , seriously . I'm impressed . 
 Are you watching the soccer match tonight ? It must be the most exciting one in this season . 
 Manchester United . What about you ? 
 I have confidence in them . 
 We may go abroad , my wife wants to go to Egypt , and I'd like to go there too . We haven't made up our mind yet . 
 We may travel by sea . It's cheaper . 
 David , I ’ m going to China . 
 You know . I took part in the Chinese contest . I was the best and they gave me this reward . I don ’ t have to pay for my trip . 
 Thank you . I ’ m leaving tomorrow morning . 
 I ’ m sure I will . 
 Thank you , David . 
 Thank you . I couldn ’ t have done it without the help of a strong team . 
 Well , I hope the client feels the same way ! 
 I'm exhausted . My new exercise is so hard . 
 You thing so ? 
 Tomorrow morning.Try it . 
 Are you going to this class this morning ? 
 You're no able to move after this class . 
 You want to bet ? 
 I bet I can go one hour in your class this morning and not feel a thing . 
 Thank you . 
 What a lovely dog ! How did you know I love things like this ? 
 Maybe you won't believe this , but it was made by my grandmother . 
 Thank you , Please have a cup of tea . 
 How about some fish ? 
 OK.Let me make a wish ... Do you want a big piece of cake ? 
 It is so very kind of you . I'm so moved by you . 
 Actually , I prefer if you didn't . Air conditioning makes me sneeze . 
 Oh , sure . It's very stuffy in here . 
 This is the result of women ’ s liberation . 
 I have no idea . 
 I'm glad I could help . 
 You didn't have to do that ! 
 Graham , why are you always on the phone with Jane ? 
 The other night when you came home there was lipstick on your right cheek . How do you explain that ? 
 Are you sure ? 
 Okay , I'm sorry . I believe you . 
 Because you are the most handsome boy at the university and I love you so much ! I guess I just go crazy sometimes . That's all . 
 Why ? 
 Oh . Graham . I love you so much and I really believe in our love . 
 Nothing much . I ’ m going to the cinema on Friday night but that ’ s all I have planned . 
 That ’ s right . 
 Oh , that would be lovely . Shall we say seven o ’ clock ? 
 And so , that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next year . Thank you very much for your time . 
 Aw , come on , it was nothing . I'm just doing my job . 
 Well , Kristin did give me a hand with the slides.She ' s a real wiz on PowerPoint . 
 Yeah , well , that was some good advice . You made some really good points . 
 What are you listening now , Fred ? 
 Hey ! Man , put your earphone out . I said which song you are listening to . 
 What's your comment on his new album ? 
 Let me enjoy it . 
 I cann't wait for buying his CD now . 
 Yeah . Look , other kids are coming this way . 
 That's because regular buses don't stop here . 
 Nothing . It's free . 
 Let's go sit in the back . All the cool kids do . 
 He has lost his job , and his wife died from cancer not long before . 
 She lives a happy life after marriage . 
 Lucky her . 
 No . 
 A little , but not very well . 
 2 months . 
 I'm a student . How about you ? 
 Excuse me , I bought this sweater yesterday . But when I got home and tried it on , I found it ’ s too small . 
 Yes , here you are . 
 No , can I exchange it for a bigger one ? 
 Oh , that's too bad . 
 Did you enjoy that new movie ? 
 Oh , what happened , Carole ? 
 What ? I met him just before I took off from Kitty's , he said he was coming . 
 Looks like it . So how did he handle it to ? 
 I think that's a bunch of nonsense . It seemed ok to me . 
 Doesn't sound promising . 
 If you want I'll let him know if I run into him . 
 Hi , it is a pleasant surprise ! 
 Couldn ’ t be better . And you ? 
 How do you celebrate Thanksgiving in the US ? 
 Do you say prayers before dinner ? 
 What is the biggest fun for you on Thanksgiving ? 
 You seem really ticked off . What's up ? 
 Chill out ! What's eating you , anyway ? 
 Well , now you're really going to freak out when I tell you who aced it ... what's-her-face ... the one who always kisses up to the teacher . 
 She's the teacher's pet , that's why . Besides , he's so laid back he lets her get away with it . She just really rubs me the wrong way . And you know what ? I think she's got the hots for him , too . 
 I'm dead serious . Yesterday , before class starts , she walks up to Mr - Edward's desk and goes , ‘ Good morning , Jim . ’ 
 Is the Chinese team taking the lead ? 
 Japanese teams always play a dark horse . 
 You are quite busy every day . 
 So you have to work all day . 
 I see you sometimes work on weekends , too . 
 Hi Mary , how's it going ? 
 terrible . It must be something serious . You two are such close friends . 
 really ? What happened ? 
 that's pretty harsh . 
 you know she probably feels just as bad . 
 well , in that case I guess maybe you can be more understanding . You shouldn't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . After all you can go to the beach anytime you want . 
 Henry , I want to ask you something . 
 You see . The wage is not paid yet , I am wondering if you could possibly lend me some money . 
 OK , Devon , I've been putting on a few pounds and you're quite a lean fit guy . 
 What do you recommend ? What can I do to lose weight ? 
 Yeah , well , actually , one of the problems is that I actually exercise a lot . 
 Yeah , so maybe it's my diet . 
 That's pretty tough ! 
 I don't know about that . 
 Yes . I found a very good job down here . 
 I am going to miss you , too . 
 OK . I will write to you as soon as I get there . 
 The days are getting longer ! 
 Yeah , they can enjoy themselves in the day time and it is not so hot . 
 That's great ! 
 And this kind of weather is rare for the season either . 
 So we must seize this chance to go the beach . 
 He will enjoy himself this weekend . 
 I saw him last week . It seems he was a bit queer in the head . 
 What a pity ! 
 I have to run to the grocery store . 
 Yes , but I am out of food and milk . 
 The small one , just down the street . I like their generic brand . 
 I hear they have very nice stuff . 
 Well , you should try my store . The prices are good . 
 I'm happy to see you again . 
 We should do this more often . 
 What will happen to the children if you break up ? 
 Why don't you make up with John . 
 What upsets you ? 
 It is not your mother finding one for you ? 
 Perhaps you can try the three minutes date , the latest type . 
 No , there is an updated version , three minutes video date . I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes . 
 I think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone , so-called love at first sight . 
 Don ’ t worry . There are many other options using the internet as dating methods . Some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications . 
 I don ’ t want to post my personal information on the internet . I ’ m not knowing who is reading it . 
 Hi , darling , I am thinking it is the time of your calling . 
 Quite good except thinking of you so much . 
 It's called love is blind , I think . 
 Yes , I did . It is a horrible movie . 
 Actually , more and more people have realized that violence on TV may lead to the increase of crime rates among teenagers . 
 But anyhow there are many worthwhile programs . 
 It makes me sick . 
 Yes , how should I set up my new computer ? 
 Great , thanks a lot . 
 Good morning , Miss Bell ! 
 Nice to see you too.It ' s been a long time . 
 Just fine , and you ? 
 Did you drive yourself to the airport ? 
 Did someone meet you at the airport here ? 
 Is this where we'll be holding the meeting ? 
 What should we do this Saturday ? 
 Yeah , but I don't know if it is going to be any good . 
 True . Ok . Let's see it this Saturday . 
 Sounds like a plan . Let's meet in front of Tower Records at 12:00 . 
 Nothing special , just working . Why do you ask ? 
 I'd like to , but I'm not sure if I can . Work has been really busy lately . Why don't we go on Friday instead ? 
 OK , then let's try to go this weekend . I should know if I can go by Friday . Is it OK if I call you then ? 
 What's your number ? 
 OK , I'll talk to you soon . 
 Can I borrow these magazines ? 
 Are we allowed to go into the stacks to look for books ? 
 I never watch foreign films . They're too boring . 
 Hey , it is ! A lot of people like that movie ! 
 Face it , you don't like action movies because you're a snob . 
 This is tough to say , John , but I think we should break up . 
 Yes , I mean it . 
 No , we are just too different . This relationship isn't going anywhere . 
 I have thought about it for a long time . I think it's time to move on for both of us . 
 I'm sorry . 
 Then why didn't you talk to me ? 
 I don't want to argue with you anymore . This is going to be tough , but let's try to forget that and be friends . 
 I think we'll be better off if we are apart . 
 Sure , let's just be friends . 
 Sorry , I'm afraid that I've got plans tonight . 
 I'm going to my parents ' house for my father's birthday . 
 It's his 50th birthday . 
 Sure thing . What are your plans for the evening ? 
 Well , if you can wait until tomorrow night , I'll go with you then . 
 Sounds like this weekend just isn't going to work out for us . 
 Sure.Hey , I'm sorry , but I've got to get going . 
 Say hello to your friends for me . 
 Bye ! 
 Of course , just fill out this form and let me know when you are finished . 
 I will also need your driver's license ; hand me the filled-out form , please . 
 Perfect ! Do you know the hours and rules for the library ? 
 Everything you need to know is printed on the card and handout . 
 Great ! You are all set to enjoy the library . 
 He asked me to beef up in the work . 
 Nothing , thanks . I am just not in the mood these days . 
 I'm just watching some television . 
 Me too . Do you think we are boring people ? 
 That's right . What do you think we should do as a hobby ? 
 I like to play the piano for fun . 
 Hobbies are great . I'm going to make a list of all the things I like to do . 
 Jack , what's wrong ? 
 What are you talking about ? What did I do ? 
 No ... that's not what I meant . I didn't mean that . She asked me where you were and I jokingly said that you were on a date with Sara . I thought Martha knew that you and Sara were just friends . 
 I'm sorry man . I didn't know . I didn't mean to screw anything up . 
 Look . I really didn't mean to , and next time I see Martha , I'll really tell her that you and Sara are really just friends . 
 Shall we for go out for a meal this evening ? 
 We can go to that new Chinese restaurant . 
 Come on , let ’ s try it . 
 Mr.Martin , we're on arrival . 
 We'll miss you . I hope we'll keep in touch . 
 It's my pleasure . We hope you'll visit Beijing again . 
 It's almost time to get aboard . 
 Bye bye ! Have a pleasant journey ! 
 Why ? 
 With snow in Kunming ? That's crazy ! 
 Are you driving a motorcycle or an automobile ? 
 Fine . You can either park in the student lot or on the street . Do you know what a handicapped space is ? 
 Well , when you see the blue spots with the handicapped logo , do not park there unless you have a special permit . Are you going to be parking in the daytime or the evening ? 
 Then you also need to be aware of the time limits on the street signs . Have you seen those signs ? 
 The signs always tell you how long you can park there and on what days . Do you know how to read the curb colors ? 
 Well , just as long as you realize that red means no parking and white means loading and unloading , I think you know what you need to know . 
 For more than five years . 
 It's no picnic . 
 What are those ? 
 Is there anything that is smaller than electrons and protons ? 
 I really don't want to know about this . Physics gives me a headache . 
 Oh , a bouquet of flowers . It's very kind of you . 
 I love flowers , you know . Thank you very much . 
 Who is it ? 
 Wait a sec . 
 We're watching a football match . What's the matter ? 
 I'm sorry about this . 
 You can rest assured that we won't disturb others anymore . 
 I like girls who like to have fun , and aren't too serious . 
 That's true . Having a very serious boyfriend or girlfriend can be boring . 
 I think so . 
 Well . Let ’ s go swimming . 
 Then why don ’ t we go for a walk in the hills . It ’ d be very good for us you know . 
 My car won ’ t start ! Stupid old car ! 
 Fine . 
 Yeah ! I am here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor . 
 Yeah , it sounds like it usually does when I start the car , but nothing else happens . The engine won ’ t start . Should I maybe press the accelerator ? 
 So what do you think it is ? 
 Umm . yeah ! Right ! I got the car started ! Thanks for your help ! I told you to fill the tank ! 
 You can't be serious . 
 Yes , I ‘ m just reading them myself . It ’ s been a great competition . We got gold medals in three events . 
 We won the men ’ s high jump and the women ’ s 1500 meters . 
 The woman who won the 1500 meters also broke the world record by 2 seconds . 
 A Russian man broke the discus record by a centimeters . Out best athlete broke his personal best in the long jump , but it only got him third place . 
 Was he disqualified ? 
 Hi , Ellen . That outfit looks terrific ! 
 No , we just don ’ t usually admit it ! 
 Hey , Mike . Can I ask you something ? 
 I'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . Who do you think will win ? 
 My husband is betting on France . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Is there something wrong ? You look so sad . 
 No wonder you look so upset . Have you called the police ? 
 How are you feeling , John ? 
 Do more exercises after you are healthy . 
 Are you hungry ? Do you want me to buy something for you to eat ? 
 did you go to university ? 
 when did you graduate ? 
 I just graduated from high school . 
 I'd like to get a BA , but I don't know where I should go . 
 yes , I've applied to four universities and have been accepted into all of them . 
 the tuition is the same for all of them . 
 I think the course at Leeds University is interesting , but I think the one at Manchester University would be more practical . 
 I'd really like to be in London , but it's the most expensive city in England to live in , so I don't know if I can afford to live there . 
 not yet . 
 that's a good idea . 
 Excuse me , could you spare me a few minutes ? 
 Do you know if train 10 is on time to be here ? 
 Do you mind if I read your newspaper for a while ? 
 Thanks a lot 
 Yes.That would be good . 
 What's the matter ? 
 You shouldn't have used the machine.Did you lose your money ? 
 You ought to complain.These machine are always out of order . 
 I can't deny that . She is so beautiful that I fell in love with her at the first sight . I wish I knew more about her . 
 I cannot belive that . It must be cooked up by someone . 
 I hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan of action , but I doubt it ’ ll happen before it ’ s too late . 
 Everyone is looking at the issue in the short term , rather than the long term . It ’ s the same with the destruction of the rainforests . Countries and companies just want the wood . They ’ re not thinking a 
 It also means that people sometimes fight over the farmland that remains . Damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people . 
 I think I ’ d like to do that . I could take the things I learn here back to my country when I have finished my studies . 
 No , I am not eating there anymore . I have ordered my favorite food in the restaurant around the corner . The food served in the cafeteria is not my type . I am a total meat lover . But the cafeteria is doing its best to force me to be a vegetarian . They have been serving the Chinese cabbage and white gorse for three days . Haven ’ t you noticed that ? 
 Well , then the cafeteria suits you best . But anyway , if you like to have a lunch outside the company , feel free to join me anytime . 
 That's a secret . 
 Thank you , but Alice is only a visitor here . I don't know if she'll keep it . 
 Really ? 
 oh , hi Lucas , come on in . I'm Barbara . Nice to meet you . 
 would you like something to drink ? I've got tea and some grape juice . 
 oh , there is a supermarket not far from here . But there is also a tea house around the corner , where you can get tea and a tea set as well . 
 you are right about that . It's quiet and very convenient . You can get to the bus and the subway stations within ten minutes'walk . There's a grocery store , a book store , a gym , and many restaurants 
 well , if you want we can go together sometime . Actually I was thinking of going this afternoon , if you like , you can join me and I can show you the neighborhood along the way . 
 I am totally fed up with my boss . He has crossed the line one too many times with his sexist comments . This time I am really going to report him for sexual harassment . 
 He constantly lets inappropriate things slip out , referring to the women employees as girls or calling us sweetheart or darling . I doubt any of my male colleagues would stand for such treatment . 
 You ’ re missing the point . It ’ s about respect . He treats us with such a patronizing attitude , as if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers . It ’ s his attitude that needs to be changed , not just his words . 
 Is your lady beautiful ? Since I came here from the country , I've not seen her close . Tell me , is she beautiful ? 
 And , her lips ? 
 And her voice like a lark's song ? 
 Oh , she sings too ? 
 Would you like to have dinner with me tonight ? 
 You are really career minded . 
 It's going to strike 12 o'clock . Let's get the firecrackers ready , Rose . 
 Well yes , but they are not allowed only in downtown areas . It's OK here . It would be difficult to ban customs that have thousands of years of tradition . The habit does bring kids joy and excitement so long as precautions are taken . Let's go out and set off firecrackers out there . 
 What other activities will you have tomorrow ? 
 Do you bring some gifts along ? 
 Is it the same practice for all families ? 
 I really appreciate the way you Chinese people exchange feelings . The holiday's long enough for you to relax . 
 You seem to be very hesitant about doing things . 
 You are meeting trouble halfway , I guess . 
 That's where the shoe pinches . 
 I thought it was in a quiet neighborhood , but it isn't . 
 One of my neighbors has a dog . 
 It barks all night long . 
 Sure , Johnny , how much do you need ? five bucks ? 
 I don ’ t know about that ; with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ’ s just too much instability . I wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate . 
 Come on , son , you ’ re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point . 
 What do you think of smoking ? 
 What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ? 
 But that ’ ll affect the national economy . 
 How about printing a warning on each cigarette packet ? 
 do you like playing games ? 
 how about individual games like the Rubik's cube or solitaire ? 
 if I taught you how to do it , I'm sure you could solve it . 
 I didn't really have to figure it out . I just followed the instructions ! 
 hints are really important when you're solving puzzles . If you give me some hints about playing that PS2 game , I ’ ll show you how to solve the Rubik's cube . 
 do you remember , years ago , when everybody at the New Year's party had yo-yos ? 
 I don't know . I haven't tried yo-yo since that party ! 
 if you don't start when you're young , it's hard to get the hang of it . 
 ok . 
 And good shot ! 
 Mary , there's one more thing that you must do for me before you leave . 
 You have to take the math and English evaluation tests . 
 Because you're from a foreign country . The school needs to find out how good you are at both basic skills . 
 You are a smart girl ! 
 I have a bone to pick with you . 
 You always have a chip on your shoulder . 
 OK , Nick . Here's the question , What movie and its sequel both won an Oscar for Best Picture ? 
 Whew ! I'm impressed ! You really know your stuff ! 
 It is obvious that their government is nursing the hope of having all other countries over a barrel and bring them completely under their control . 
 What can we do ? 
 This is today ’ s schedule . At eight thirty , conference with the department managers . At 9 o ’ clock , live for the workshop where you ’ ll award prizes to the stafffor preventatives . 
 3000 RIB as bonus for each person . 
 Ok . Next thing is laying the corner-stone for the new plant at 10 AM . At 12 AM , back here for lunch . 
 At 2 PM , give a presentation here with the press . At four o ’ clock sharp , have dinner with Mr . Smith , manager of NCC . 
 I get along pretty well with most of them.It seems there are always a few rotten apples in the bunch , though , Like Margaret . I don't know why management hasn't fired her yet.She ' s a terrible gossip . 
 It's not only that she gossips , but she also tries to start problems among other employees by spreading rumors and telling lies about her co-workers.She ' s not trustworthy , and in my opinion , I think she's nuts . 
 I think one of the important things is just to be considerate of your co-workers'feelings and needs.If you are aware of other people and do your part to make a good working environment , you should be able to get along with most of the people you work with . 
 Thanks a lot for having us . We had a good time . 
 Thanks . By the way , tell your wife she throws a great party . 
 So how did you meet Bill ? 
 Oh , really ? Which bulletin board ? 
 I've heard about that , but I've never tried it . 
 I have no desire to talk on a network with a bunch of strangers . 
 I just want a private conversation with one other person . 
 Well , maybe I'll tag along and watch how you talk . 
 It ’ s that popular ? 
 Have you seen that house ? 
 You're right . I love it very much . 
 At least more than 100 years old . 
 I can't open the door . 
 Let me ask the old woman in that reception office . 
 She must be deaf . 
 Frightened ? You must be joking . 
 Thanks.You too ! 
 Well , my family's away and I can't afford to do much.What about you ? 
 What did you major in ? 
 What is your specialty ? 
 The National Day is coming . What are you going to do during the holiday ? 
 Why don't you go sightseeing ? 
 I intend to stay at home for the whole seven days and have a good rest . 
 No . I caught a cold two days ago . I only finish reading half of it . 
 I'm feeling better today . 
 About more three days , I think . 
 No problem . 
 Are you all right ? 
 Hi , Lilly , it ’ s so nice to see you again . 
 Nothing special . I had a get-together with some schoolmates at the high school , visited the Internet and read a couple of books which I had been longing for . How about yours ? 
 You know , I really don ’ t think Americans are very romantic . 
 That ’ s the impression I get from the movies , and from looking around . Men and women seem very business-like in their relations with each other . 
 Is it true or isn ’ t it ? 
 I just think you ’ re trying to change the subject . But go ahead . 
 OK , go on . 
 Not exactly , but I see your point . 
 It's a lovely day , isn't it ? 
 I love it when the weather is like this.Why don't we sit down outside and have our lunch ? 
 I really miss the change of seasons like we have in Colorado.but I must admit , this sure is a nice spring day . 
 Okay.Hey , is that a dark cloud over there ? Do you think it will rain after all ? 
 If the weather stays nice perhaps we can go to the beach this weekend.It ' s been a while since I've not really gotten some sun . 
 Yes . 
 No problem . What should I bring ? 
 What's your weight ? 
 Do put yourself on a diet , otherwise you'll be too fat . 
 Did you ever take History 231 ? 
 Who was the professor ? 
 I have him this semester . What do you think about him ? 
 What did you end up getting ? 
 That's probably because he grades on a curve . 
 I hate it and I was about to withdrawal . But after hearing your experience , I think I will tough it out . 
 Thanks for letting me know . I feel relieved now . 
 Only four days . 
 I know . I can't help thinking about her . She's always on my mind . 
 Hey , the same to you ! 
 Definitely , it's time to say bye-bye to the last year and to say hello to the new year ! 
 Some resolutions ? That's a wonderful idea , but I have no idea yet . How about you ? 
 That will be a good one ! Anything else ? 
 Sounds great ! 
 What do you mean by that ? 
 You've been always active and versatile . It seems that you are interested in everything . 
 I have fewer hobbies than yours . That's why I find campus life a bit dull and uninteresting . 
 That's a good suggestion . It's fine today . Maybe I can take photos on the scenery of the lake at sunset . It must be fantastic . 
 And I can concentrate on my study after the relaxation over the weekend . 
 Hey , Jane ... are you familiar with our company's insurance policies ? 
 I've never really paid attention to the fine print of our insurance policies ... but it looks like I'm going to need to make a claim . 
 I have a slipped disc in my lower back and the doctor says surgery is probably the best option . Does our worker insurance cover this kind of thing ? 
 Hummum ... I think I'll have to talk to the doctor again about that.Anyway ... now that I'm going to have to make some claims , I think I'd better try and understand how the system works . Would you mind breaking it down for me ? 
 That's the charge for insurance I see on my pay slip each month , right ? 
 So workman's compensation is if I slip and break my arm while working in the office or on the job , right ? 
 I decided to go for this kind of life . 
 I know . I always hope for the best and prepare for the worst . 
 How are you ? 
 Did you need something ? 
 How may I help you ? 
 Have you checked the periodicals section yet ? 
 If you ’ d like , I can show you were to find it . 
 Follow me . 
 Wow , American football is more exciting than I thought . 
 Oh , right . So , I can ’ t quite follow what ’ s going on ... who ’ s winning ? 
 Wow ! What a hit ! 
 Is he ok ? 
 I guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team . 
 Yeah . 
 What happened ? Why did everyone get so quiet ? 
 Jack ! Do you want to see a picture of my new puppy ? 
 Well , this is my new baby . He ’ s just as much trouble . That ’ s for sure ! But , he ’ s a lot of fun ! 
 I'm going to Ireland this summer . 
 No , I'd like to go alone . 
 A new film is on . Have you ever seen it ? 
 It's a feature film . 
 How old are you , Su ? 
 I see , you have seven candles on the cake . 
 We will have a party here , right ? 
 I've had enough of that ! 
 I hate the hero.He ' s too cruel . 
 Honey , I've got good news for you . 
 You are going to be a father . 
 Yes . We'll have our baby soon . 
 Me , too . 
 Yes , actually . I don't really know anyone , but it's a nice place . Are you having a good time ? 
 Hello Paul . I'm Jane . So what do you do ? 
 Really ? Me , too . I work for an accountancy company , T & D . Maybe you've heard of them . 
 About two years . And you ? Are you based here ? 
 Are you still working day and night ? 
 The stepmother was very wicked . She couldn't stand a happy smile on the boy's face . 
 And she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy . 
 Excuse me , are you Sara Wilson ? 
 Nice to meet you too . Let me help you with your bags . 
 Wow , you're not kidding . Hold on a second . Hello , could you give us a hand , please ? 
 Not at all . But I've found satisfaction in it ! 
 No , I never do that . 
 I don't want to mark my table , of course . 
 I'm sorry . I thought you wouldn't come back so early . 
 Oh , you've got a good memory . 
 Could I check out this book ? 
 I need to get one . 
 Okay . Let me do that right now . 
 I ’ m finished . Here you go . 
 All right . 
 Now may I check this book out ? 
 I don't care what the best part is . Whatever you say won't change my mind . I'm not buying anything ! 
 The 1879 Large Dragon ? Are you serious ? How much ? 
 I'm so excited ! We have two weeks off ! What are you going to do ? 
 Well , my parents have rented a condominium in Florida . I'm going to take long walks along the beach every day and do lots of swimming . 
 Say , why don't you come with us ? We have plenty of room . 
 I can't stand the stupid guy any longer.It ' s unbelievable ! 
 He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . 
 I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me . 
 Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff . 
 I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend.How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ? 
 Did you sign up for the picnic party ? 
 This time you can bring your daughter with you . 
 There are times of games planned , should have a grand time . 
 And what ’ s the problem ? 
 And you want to know what to wear ? 
 That sounds just right to me . What was wrong with it ? 
 My guess is you can safely wear last night ’ s outfit to tonight ’ s party . 
 Happy birthday to you ! I'd really love to come , but I'm not sure right now . I'll try to make it.Thank you for your invitation . 
 Big time ! A hacker broke into the company's files and got all her personal information . You really think it's completely safe ? 
 Now we're getting to the truth . 
 See ? And I bet that's easy to do online . Everybody's anonymous . 
 Eight altogether . 
 Six are compulsory , two optional . 
 I don ’ t know . What do you think ? 
 What do natives get ? 
 Do you mean that a native doesn ’ t make any mistakes in grammar ? 
 I suppose that only a small percentage of college students don ’ t know standard English in American universities . 
 Do I need a visa ? 
 Yes , I know . I must get my traveler ’ s check and some foreign currency . 
 Really ? That ’ s very good of you , Helen . But I must get a new suitcase , my old one needs repairing . 
 That ’ s very kind of you , Helen . I hope you don ’ t mind my leaving you like this . I need a holiday . It won ’ t be long . 
 Is that your phone ? 
 it's very impressive . Can you use the Internet on your phone ? 
 that's really convenient . Does it have the Bluetooth ? 
 no , but I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go . 
 does it have a camera ? 
 I guess so . Would you mind if I checked my email quickly ? I'm supposed to be getting an important email this evening from a client . 
 have you checked your voicemail recently ? 
 I think this icon means that you have a voicemail message . 
 do you want to listen to your messages first ? 
 I'm surprised you don't use more of the features on your phone . 
 it quit working last week and I haven't had a chance to buy a new one yet . 
 it's not that bad . It kind of feels like I'm on vacation , not having to answer my phone all the time ! 
 Are you feeling better today , Bill ? 
 You ’ d better give up smoking . It ’ s bad for your health . 
 But you should make up your mind first . 
 Why don ’ t you go to bed early and get up early ? You ’ ll have the same time for work . 
 What are your weekend arrangements ? 
 What sort of things are you interested in ? 
 I love swimming and cycling . On Sunday morning I have swimming practice for an hour . In the afternoon , I just ride my bike around the city or along the country roads for almost two hours . 
 Mostly in the city's swimming pool . But on occasion , I go to the beach with friends . Well , what do you do at leisure ? 
 Good.You really know how to enjoy yourself . 
 He spoke evil behind his back . 
 Someone told Joe off . 
 Sure . He ’ ll get the bag , I think . 
 There's no need to apologize . 
 Forget it . It was an accident . 
 I ’ Ve just parted with my boyfriend . 
 But I cannot forget him . 
 We offer many different sea water treatments . 
 The aquamedic pool is included . You can choose three . 
 OK . Here are your robes . You can go shower first . 
 I wouldn ’ t miss it for the world ! It ’ s sure to be fun . She ’ s invited a lot of people . Do you think everyone will be able to get into her house ? 
 Are you taking anything ? 
 That ’ s a good idea . She told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . I think it ’ s going to be a noisy party . I hope her neighbours don ’ t mind too much . 
 I ’ m ready looking forward to it . This party is going to be a blast ! 
 I hated the hand-me-downs to wear when I was a kid . 
 It was not just that . I didn ’ t like them because they never fitted me . 
 Yes , Would you like to have the seats in the front or at the back ? 
 What did you do last vacation ? 
 What will you do this vacation ? 
 Do you like Barry ? 
 I agree . I like his brother , Paul . They are not alike . 
 What kind of person do you consider yourself to be ? 
 Oh , I don ’ t think you ’ re shy ! You are always chatting with new people when we go to a party . 
 You ’ re right . I love going out and making new friends . 
 Of course ! 
 Hello , I ’ m Mark . I ’ m just wondering if you are free this weekend . 
 Good . I was thinking that I ’ d like to invite you to watch a movie . I can meet you at the cinema gate . 
 Six thirty , tonight . 
 All right.Maybe next time I can go with you.Bye ! 
 Congratulations ! Is it a boy or a girl ? 
 What do you think are the most important things to do when running a business ? 
 So , do you think workers should be paid as little as possible ? 
 How can a business maximise revenues ? 
 What else do you suggest ? 
 This paper absorbs water so quickly ! 
 John has some trouble in his life . 
 Yeah . He ’ s been having an easy time since he was a boy , and now he doesn ’ t know how to face the music . 
 Welcome back , soccer fans . My name is Rick Fields and , as always , I am joined by my commentating wingman , Bob Copeland . 
 The ref calls the players for the kick off , and here we go ! Ecuador quickly passes the ball to the midfield , but , oath , it ’ s out of bounds . 
 No question about it . He was offside by a mile ! We have a goal kick for Ecuador . Edison Mendez heads it to Valencia , he shoots ! Deflected by the defender and we have a corner kick . 
 This is the perfect opportunity for Ecuador to get ahead in this match and become World Champions ! He gets ready for the kick . He shoots ! and he ... 
 Hello , there , my name is Tonia . 
 Actually , I can do both soprano and alto but the director asked me to sing alto for the next perforate . What about you . 
 Our bass section is really good . You're going to love singing with them . 
 It's good to have you in the group . We can always use a good baritone ! 
 Thank you ! 
 Yeah . I'm lucky to be his wife . 
 So he will make a perfect husband . Make sure you will be here next Monday . 
 Hey , buddy . Are the fish biting today ? 
 Is that so ? Well , what kind of bait are you using ? 
 Lures ? We're using live bait over here . 
 We're using worms . 
 No , we haven't even gotten a nibble today . 
 I would , but I don't have any in my tackle box . 
 I'm just fishing from the shore . How about you ? 
 Sweet.Can you tell me where it is ? 
 Do you think that's a good spot ? 
 Thanks . I think I'll go check that out now . 
 So John , have you ever been to China before ? 
 Have you travelled to many other countries ? 
 What about America ? Have you ever been to the United States ? 
 What kind of movies do you like , Sue ? 
 Just like my wife . So , what ’ s your favorite movie ? 
 Yeah , my wife likes that one , too . Personally , I prefer action movies . 
 Well , it's Thursday today . 
 The 5th . 
 Of course I won't chill out . Opportunity knocks only once . 
 You're right . I will have a talk to her about that . 
 No problem , but you've got to be careful . 
 Here's the key then . 
 What's going on ? 
 So what happened ? 
 So what does that have to do with this position ? 
 All under the precept of keeping the funding ? That stinks . 
 No , not so soon . Couldn ’ t I persuade you to stay a couple of days more ? 
 I hope this won ’ t be our last meeting . 
 I will miss you . 
 It's a pity that I'm too busy to see you off tomorrow . 
 Take care of yourself and remember to keep in touch . 
 Goodbye and have a good flight . 
 What are you reading ? 
 It seems that English already is the main global language . Does the article suggest that there should be an artificial language like Esperanto as the world language . 
 Does the article say anything about other language ? How will they survive in an English-speaking world ? 
 Hello ? 
 Not yet . 
 I ’ d like to , but I can ’ t . 
 I ’ Ve a lot of paper work to do right now . I ’ m behind schedule . 
 Sure , thanks . 
 Bye . 
 What ? That would be to cut off your nose to spite your face . 
 Call the police . 
 You are so kind . Thank you very much . 
 Personally , I'm not for it . I feel it's bad for kids to watch . 
 If you ask me , I have to disagree . Something shouldn't be watched for fun . 
 I like the old styles of dance . Such as fox-trot , waltz , rumba , tango and so on . They're all graceful . 
 Why not ? Do you think I should like modern dance ? 
 Oh , sorry . I don't like them . Why not ask Lily . She likes modern dance . 
 Can you help me do an internet search ? 
 I want to find information on World War Two . 
 Yes , I want to know about the Normandy Landing . 
 Oh , wow ! There are lot of sites . 
 Thanks . 
 Thanks . If I am interested , I'll go to the library . 
 I'm on your side . It needs to be done over . 
 Yes , there aren't any clouds in the sky and we've got such a beautiful view here . Look ! This is St James Park . And there's Buckingham Palace 
 It's on the other side of the Palace . 
 Yes , you're right . Politicians of all kinds , religious people , and one or two madmen . 
 Sure . I can see you're enjoying your trip today . 
 Hi , John , how was your vacation ? 
 That must have been wonderful . Do anything interesting ? 
 Wow ! Isn ’ t that dangerous ? 
 Tell me about it . 
 500 feet ! I would never be able to do that . 
 How ’ s the food ? 
 Well I don ’ t think so . I don ’ t like it at all ! 
 I eat dog food when my parents are out . 
 Poor us ! All this junk food lacks nutrition ! 
 Good idea ! 
 I'm not sure I can't agree , dan . 
 Surely , there are other ways to save money . 
 I ’ m sure you never dare to go against your wife . 
 Have you ever got the goods on her for wrong doings ? 
 Well , it ’ s nice to have a husband like you . 
 When do you leave ? 
 Take care of yourself and don't forget to keep in touch . 
 Can we have two tickets for this evening's film ? 
 Titanic . 
 Front , please . 
 Do you have seats in the fourth or fifth rows ? 
 All right.We ' ll take the second row.By the way , how much is it ? 
 Fairly expensive . 
 Sure , thanks . I brought you a bottle of wine as well . 
 Should I take my shoes off ? 
 This is a very nice place . How long have you been living here now ? 
 Sure , what do you have ? 
 I'll have a glass of red wine please . 
 So how many people are coming for the dinner tonight ? 
 Oh , I thought there were going to be eight . who isn't coming ? 
 That's too bad.They ' re such good company . 
 The weather is really miserable . It has been raining hard all day long . 
 Do you think the rain is going to let up soon ? 
 How long does the rainy season last ? 
 I can hardly stand these wet and cold days . It seems that it doesn't bother you very much . 
 But I prefer warm weather . 
 I hope so . 
 Oh , I'd love to . But we're going to clean our dormitory . I can't be absent . 
 In fact , our dormitory is much worse than they can be described . 
 You'll get used to it gradually . 
 Yes , we do . That's why we have a cleaning every three months . 
 How long can I keep these books ? 
 What if I can't finish them by then ? 
 Any terrible fines ? 
 Are you excited about your trip next month ? 
 Why ? 
 Oh really ? I have an uncle who is also terrified of flying . It ' s not that bad though , I mean , it is pretty scary to be in this big machine flying through the air at seven hundred miles per hour . I actually have arachnophobia . 
 I guess that explains why you are afraid of flying , but public speaking is not that bad . 
 Well , I must confess I am a bit claustrophobic . I hate being in an elevator for more than 5 seconds . 
 Hello , Rachel . It's glad to see you here . 
 I'm going to throw a party tomorrow night . Would you like to come ? 
 Of course . 
 At 6 o'clock . 
 See you . 
 I didn't realize you felt so strongly about it . 
 I'm sorry . I'll ask next time . 
 Oh , that sounds great ! 
 Yes , that would be perfect . 
 Yes . Thank you for inviting me . 
 I haven't finished it . It is very difficult . 
 Oh , I know . I will try my best . 
 Would you like to come to our party ? 
 what happened ? You look so pale . 
 What makes you say that ? 
 Oh , that's too bad . Work harder next term . 
 Don't loose heart . Everything will be fine . 
 I had a terrible journey back from Bangkok last week . 
 Well , first of all , the taxi that was taking me from the client's office to the airport broke down on the freeway . 
 Yes , and the driver didn't speak any English or Chinese and he didn't have a phone on him-can you believe it ? - and his radio didn't work . So there was no way he could get in touch with the office to get them to send another taxi . 
 Well , I actually thumbed a lift . 
 Yes , I stood on the side of the freeway and stuck my thumb out , and a passing truck stopped and took me to the airport . 
 Yes , except he drove really slowly , and I missed my flight . 
 Yes , so I had to wait three hours for the next one . I didn't get home till four in the morning , and when I got home I realized I'd left my house keys in my hotel in Bangkok . 
 Seems like it . 
 Sure . 
 Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co-workers . 
 Well , this one is not compulsory . It is just suggestion . 
 Do you know about All Fools ' Day ? 
 April fool ! 
 Daniel , I can't catch up with the English teacher very well . 
 You are quite good at English , can you help me with it . 
 English school ? What is that ? 
 Is that different from our school's English course ? 
 Have you ever seen coco ? 
 I'm so familiar with her songs , but I don't know what kind of person she is in real life . 
 That's Susan . 
 She's a lawyer . 
 No , but she speaks English fluently . 
 Yes , I know her . We're friends . 
 Which man ? 
 Oh , that's Matt . 
 Yeah . 
 I don't know him , but I think my sister does . 
 Yes , he's married . 
 I ’ Ve gotta hand it to you , you really did a good job ! 
 I think you deserve a promotion . 
 Are you going abroad to study ? 
 Billy , you are late again . 
 Yes he ' s in his office . 
 Don't take any chances . It'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again . He's already mad at you for last 2 times . Any more and he might fire you . 
 I think he might . You'd better go to his office . 
 Good luck ! 
 There ’ s a possibility . 
 I mean if you don ’ t sell your shares now , it ’ s quite likely that you ’ ll end up losing your shirt . 
 Absolutely . Take my word for it . 
 What should we take ? 
 Good idea ! 
 Well ... this one costs more , but it has a much better sound.This part of it is made of wood , not plastic . And there's a tone control , too . 
 Hmm ... well , the other one is good for the money . It's much cheaper . We sell clot of them and all our customers are satisfied with them . 
 Certainly . 
 Yes , thanks . Did you ? 
 I went to Tamshui . You ? 
 What do you do for a living ? 
 Really ? Do you like it ? 
 I ’ m a bus driver . 
 No , I don ’ t really like it . It ’ s boring . 
 How about going to the theatre ? 
 Well , what do you like doing ? 
 I like painting , sailing , watching football and talking to you . 
 Do you want to go to an exhibition ? There is one at the Xinghai Exhibition Hall tomorrow . 
 You want to go to the movies tonight ? 
 The new Twilight movie ! 
 Of course it does . It ' s like a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet . You can see a couple who are in love but can ' t be together because they are so different . And in the fact that immortality and super human strengthen this really sexy and there you have it ! Plus the cast is hip , young people that make the movie even more enticing . 
 What kind of person do you consider yourself to be ? 
 Oh , I don't think you're shy ! You are always chatting with new people when we go to a party . 
 You're right . I love going out and making new friends . 
 Of course ! 
 You can never do that . 
 There's been bad blood between them since Bobbie took away John's girlfriend . 
 I had meetings back to back all morning . And phone rang off the hook from the minute I walked into the office . 
 I can ’ t believe it . I guess I ’ ll be here until 10 again tonight . 
 Yes , it is.It was taken just before I was leaving for college . 
 How time flies ! I'll not see twenty again . 
 Yes , I can , but not very well . 
 At school . And I'm still learning it now . 
 About three years . 
 I'm afraid not . 
 I won't ever forget it ! I was sitting in the cafeteria all by myself ... 
 Oh , it seems like it was just yesterday . 
 Do you have any sunscreen lotion ? 
 I think I'm getting a heart stroke . 
 Why ? It's brand new , and it's perfect on you . 
 Beauty costs , honey . 
 Walking under the sun is certainly not the way . 
 Right . Sorry . Anyway , the radio said that it'll rain later today . 
 Do you know much about computers ? 
 I've just been reading an article about them . They'll be used for all sorts of things now . 
 Yes , but they are used for other things , too . Do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to Paris . 
 The man asked where we want to go , then he type out the information on the form and waited for a reply . A few moment later , he gave us two tickets . 
 That's right . 
 Would you like me to go with you ? 
 Do you want to type that letter ? 
 Do you want to tell her ? 
 Which season do you like best ? 
 Why ? 
 I like spring , too.We can go for a walk and enjoy the fresh air . 
 Poor fellow ! What's the date today , buddy ? 
 You forgot all about it , didn't you ? 
 How long will you be there ? 
 So you'll have a tour of the famous city . 
 Oh , the ink is spilled on the desk . 
 No , but the table cloth was dirty . 
 I'm afraid it's too hard to wash off the stain . 
 I really feel great shame . Let me buy a new one for you . 
 Are you a happy married man ? 
 You are a lucky man . How about Mr . Smith . 
 You mean she bosses her husband around ? 
 The country is strong only in appearance . Don ’ t you think so ? 
 You can say that again . The government must open it ’ s eyes to the fact . 
 Look , Elaine Robinson and I do not get along . 
 That has nothing to do with it ... 
 I do . 
 It smells like an ashtray in here ! 
 What ’ s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking . 
 Look , there are other ways to quit . You can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . It ’ s not like you can just light up like before . 
 Fine ! I want a divorce ! 
 Sure , what's going on ? 
 Let me see ... The weekend after next looks pretty good.Otherwise , I'm all booked up . 
 Really ? 
 I will . Thanks for telling me . 
 I didn't pass the English exam . How to learn English well ? Can you give me some suggestions ? 
 I have done a lot of reading comprehension exercises , and I also spend much time in memorizing English words . 
 Really ? I'll have a try . Maybe I will get high marks next time . 
 Ms . Lee , could you tell me what number 7 is again ? I didn't catch you . 
 No , thank you . 
 Watch his bread , it seems to be delicious . He had a lot on the ball . 
 I don't know what I'm going to do . I need to find a job . If I don't , I won't be able to stay here next semester . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Yes , I know . I tried that.They don't have anything now . So what can I do ? 
 I know that . You don't have to tell me that . That's my problem . I know I have the right to work for the university . That's legal.But they don't have a job for me . And it's illegal for me to get a job elsewhere . 
 But I need a pretty decent job . I need to make enough to pay my rent at least . 
 What ? 
 I already had that idea . 
 But I don't know what I would do . 
 Maybe . I don't know . 
 I have to find something.Otherwise I have to go back to Taiwan . I'll be broke in two months . 
 Sure . Speaking of photos , what type of film will be the best ? You know , I'm planning a tour to Jiuzhaigou Valley . 
 Thank you so much . You're an expert . 
 I could meet with you tomorrow anywhere from two until four ; what time works out best ? 
 I am glad that that works out ; can you find my office ? 
 Just follow the walkway to the outside and climb the stairs to the third floor . 
 If you do get lost , just ask someone in the building to point the way . 
 If you need to cancel your appointment , please give me a call ! 
 At five . 
 Yes , they do . 
 Yes , I do . 
 Yes , they do . 
 O levels and A levels . 
 Three or four years . 
 Ugh , I feel terrible . I went out last night with Trevor , and things got a little out of hand . 
 We hit a couple of local bars , and met up with some friends . Everything was cool until Mike came along , and it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday ! 
 Tell me about it ! We drank everything in the bar ! 
 Yeah . I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous . I threw up like five times . 
 I was so dehydrated that I drank like a gallon of water , and my head has been pounding all day . I swear , I ’ m never gonna drink again ! 
 Oh , yeah . I ’ m there ! 
 I've been really stressed . It's the end of the year and I've got so much stuff to do ! I feel like I'm drowning in work . 
 It's seriously affecting my life ! I can't sleep , I don't have much of an appetite and my husband says I've been kind of short tempered . Other people seem to handle stress okay ... why am I so weak ? 
 Yeah , but I don't see any tigers or leopards roaming around our office . My stress is just about silly paperwork ! 
 So a deadline will cause that same reaction ? 
 So the life of a cave woman was less stressful than my life ? 
 Not much . Last night I met this great guy at the bar and we had such a wonderful time that we decided to meet again tonight . 
 Well , I ddin't think so at first . But as we started talking , I found him extremely funny and witty . I couldn't stop laughing at his jokes ! We have so much in common . We like the same teams , music , and most amazingly , we both love Chinese food ! I have the feeling that we are going to be great friends . 
 There's nothing definite I think . I don't have a list or anything , but when I first meet somebody , I can usually tell whether or not that person is going to be a good friend . It seems I have a radar helping me spot new friends . 
 I agree . You can't expect a close relationship with a dishonest person . Those are the people that will turn their back on you when you are in need . 
 I must be going now . 
 No , I really must go now.My family are expecting me home soon . 
 See you ! 
 I just make eye contact with him and nod my head . Then I tell him when he comes over to the table . Why do you ask ? 
 That seems a little impolite in such a restaurant . 
 Well , it was a warm evening , so I stretched my legs . I walked along the canal for a couple of miles . Actually , several other people had the same idea . I saw Bill . 
 He seemed ok . We didn ’ t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . We just waved at each other . 
 Of course . What do you want to move first ? 
 Guess what ? 
 I don't like this movie . It's a bomb . 
 Well , give me the Walkman . I'll listen to the music then . 
 Excuse me , Miss . 
 I'm a graduate student here in mathematics . I've just come from China and I've never used a western library before . I'll be here for five years , so I'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . I wonder if someone might have time to show me around . 
 Sure . 3 thirty this afternoon . 
 Thank you . Good-bye . 
 Don't tell me you got the dreaded Bush virus . I've heard that that bug is threatening to infect the world . 
 Those clothes do suit him better . 
 Probably not . It's off the Internet . What difference does it make ? 
 Of course , my grandpa is generous and kind.My grandma cooks the most delicious Chinese dishes in the world . 
 I need some flowers for my girlfriend . 
 Oh , no . Carnations are not very elegant.Artificial flowers have no passion . 
 Money is no object . 
 I will take ten . 
 Of course . Can I have it delivered to my girlfriend's house this afternoon ? 
 That's ok . Here is the address . 
 nothing but bench of commercials . These days the amount of commercials is amazing . 
 okay . Nope , it's a replay of yesterday's soccer match between Brazil and Spain . 
 alright . Hmm , this movie is a rerun ... I don't know how many times I've seen this show ... Commercial again ... and a replay of the talk show ... oh no , this show is terrible , you don't wanna watch it . 
 it's a total rip-off of an American reality show , but the imitation is unbearably clumsy . 
 yeah ... it seems what we have on TV now are either repeats , or commercials , or low-quality shows . There's really nothing to watch . 
 cool . 
 What is it ? 
 Maybe there's something wrong with her . 
 He must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities . 
 So are Copernicus and many others . 
 Today is so hot , besides I had so much housework to do . My friend came for a visit and stayed for two hours . I didn ’ t forget , but I had no time at all . 
 Yes . I ’ m sorry . 
 Yes , I ’ m sorry . I know it bothers you very much . But I don ’ t know why Chinese sometimes would do this . 
 But you know if he brought it or not , right ? 
 Uncle , have a heart , please lend your new car to me . Only once . 
 I have a big date tonight . 
 Oh , please . Only once lend your new car to me . 
 That would be very nice . Only that I ’ ll be a little late . Is that OK ? 
 So will I . Thank you . 
 It's certainly a big improvement over yesterday . 
 Well , the worst of the winter should be over . 
 Yeah , you remember that assignment I wanted ? When I heard the manager had given it to someone else , I blew my top . So the manager fired me . 
 You look very professional in the suit . 
 I appreciate it . It is related to company image . 
 Yeah ! He is a nice guy . He is very helpful and always bends over backward to help those who are in need of help . 
 Sure . 
 Yes , but I don ’ t think it was enough . He looked disappointed . I gave him three dollars . 
 It ’ s the same in Balloon . But I definitely think we over-tipped the cab driver . The fare was twenty dollars , and you gave him a five-dollar tip . That ’ s twenty-five percent of the total ! Too much ! 
 I ’ ll sign for dinner and charge it to our room.Let ’ s see.The bill is one hundred dollars . That seems reasonable . How much tip should I leave ? 
 Thomas , would you be so kind as to lay the table for me ? I'm busy in the kitchen . 
 They're all here . 
 Thanks a lot . I'm most grateful . 
 He said his grandmother got cancer and has only a few weeks to live . It's really so sad ! But when I talked to him on the phone , it sounded like he was holding up really well . 
 I asked if there was anything I could do to help his family , and I told him that I could be a shoulder for him to cry on . 
 The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ? 
 It better be more than last year . 
 Do you like to dance ? 
 What kind of dancing do you like ? 
 Mom , what are you doing ? 
 Still clipping coupons ? 
 Saving money ? How much money can you save by those 1 or 2 dollar discount coupons ? 
 Sorry ! Excuse me ! I got your message . 
 That's OK . Just let it out . I'm OK ! I was out of town with ... Femi . 
 Taylor Smith . But not me . The pallbearers are carrying out the casket . It would be rude to just leave . Let's follow . 
 Duh ! I would say yes ! Eric is the most popular kid in school ! Okay , my turn . What would you do if you won the lottery ? 
 If you buy me a ticket I will go with you for sure ! 
 Alright this is a good one . What would your mom say if you told her you are going to get married ? 
 Wow , there are so many lanterns to appreciate . 
 Yes , it deserves its name . 
 Sure . But you know that I can't read any Chinese characters . What do they say ? 
 It's interesting and I want to buy one home . 
 Sure . What do you want ? 
 Really ? Why ? 
 And the holidays provided you a chance to think over all this and make a decision ? 
 Absolutely . With your expertise and experience , you're clearly working below your pay grade . 
 Hi Joe . You met my new assistant , right ? 
 You are kidding , but she's so helpful . 
 Come on . She's like that with everyone . 
 What a boring film ! 
 And the plot is so simple . 
 I ’ m a sales manager in a publishing company . 
 Oh , mostly fiction , lots of romance , science fiction , biography , stuff like that . 
 About two years now . 
 I'd like to , but I'm not sure if I'll have enough money . 
 I feel the same way . 
 It sure is.He has no one to turn to , very miserable indeed . 
 Well , that's your uncle Bill , his wife and two of their daughters . 
 No , your uncle Jack is my brother , Bill is my brother-in-law , your mom's brother . 
 That's right , Sarah and Jane are both your cousins although they are step-sisters . 
 Sarah is your uncle Bill's older daughter . When she was young , Bill's first wife , Sarah's mom died . Three years later Bill married again . 
 Yes . She is Sarah's step-mother . 
 They want to travel to Europe next year , and will visit us at the same Ae . 
 It's no use arguing the toss . 
 I like pop music very much . 
 I said I like pop music very much.It ' s so lovely . 
 I'll help you , Lucy . Look at what I've got here . In this small bottle , there's a magic love potion . 
 Yes . If you put a few drops on someone's eyelids while he's asleep , he'll fall in love with the first person he sees when he wakes up . 
 Take my word for it . 
 Just come to our house and stay over . You'll sit by his bed and greet him like a beautiful red rose , ' Good morning ! ' 
 Don't be so shy , Lucy . 
 What are you going to do ? Call my boss and chew him out ? 
 Impossible . My pager is really old . It doesn't display messages . 
 Gosh , you're right ! It's from some guy named Vic . I wonder who he is ... 
 What time are you going ? 
 Well , good-bye and have a good trip ! 
 Well , what brings you here ? 
 Does she live nearby ? 
 Don't talk too much , Tom . We are on duty today , we should hurry up . 
 Tom , your task is to clean the blackboard . 
 I'm going to sweep the floor first . 
 Stand on the chair , Pig Tom . Use your brain . 
 How about the podium ? 
 Be quick , please . Our teacher and classmates will come soon . 
 I think he deserved his gold . 
 Yes , it's perfect ! 
 Jim , I heard you took a trip to San Diego . Is that right ? 
 That sounds really nice . What did you do there ? 
 Did you take any pictures ? 
 Sure , I love looking at photos . 
 Your daughter looks like her mother . 
 Where was this picture taken ? 
 Did you have time to go to the zoo ? 
 It looks like you all had a nice time . 
 Are you interested in history ? 
 I love history , but I ’ Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened . 
 Some people say that history repeats itself . 
 The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same . 
 Nice day today , isn't it ? 
 We can't complain about the weather recently . 
 I wonder how long this weather can last . 
 Excuse me , Sir , May I have the time , please ? 
 Er ... I'd like to know what time it is now . 
 Thank you . By the way , what day is today ? 
 Yes , I've just come from the States , yesterday in fact . I'm still a bit confused about the time . 
 Oh , that's very nice of you . I don't want to sound pushy , but I still l have one more question . 
 What's the date today ? 
 Yeah , it was nice to meet you . Hope I run into you again sometime . 
 So did I . At first , I thought it was going to be boring , but then it turned to be good . 
 Well , the scene of the hero's struggle with enemies impressed me the most . 
 Actually , tears also came to my eyes . 
 It deserves it . The film gave us a lot of inspiration . 
 Really ? That's nice . 
 I've been completely out of touch with my old friends . 
 Yes , people just seem to drift apart . 
 I liked it . I thought it was great . 
 Yes . I thought it was excellent . Didn't you ? 
 It's a nice cinema , isn't it ? 
 John's very late.Do you think he's coming ? 
 I suppose you're right.He can't have remembered . 
 They want to be filthy with dough and think it the only source of their happiness . 
 What are you using for bait today ? 
 Is that so ? We're using lures , and the fish are biting those too . 
 How is your ankle ? 
 Please be careful next time . 
 Do you know something about Mount Tai ? 
 Five sacred mountains ? Why people call them so ? 
 Got it . Can we see any things left by them ? 
 I want to see them . How can I go there ? 
 Mary , this is your homeroom . It's 213 . Remember that . 
 You sit in there , listen to the morning announcement with other kids , and then you go to your classes . 
 But I have to go to my homeroom . 
 No . 
 Stop worrying , Mary . You'll do just fine . 
 Yeah , I've been looking forward to it for ages . 
 They give me a lot of congratulations . 
 Oh , maybe three years . I will study and get the master degree first . Then I will decide whether I will stay there or come back . 
 Chicago University . My major is Economics . 
 Thank you ! 
 This must be his 21st birthday . No doubt about it . 
 No . Well , in America , 21 is the age when you're allowed to drink . So , many guys celebrate it in bars . 
 No . If it's your birthday , then you don't need to pay a cent . Just blow out the candles and open the gifts . That makes the birthday a special day . Your friends will take care of everything . 
 What about in China ? What'd you do to celebrate your birthday ? 
 have you adapted to the lifestyle in China ? 
 what ? 
 what is it ? 
 that makes you feel uncomfortable ? 
 perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy . 
 well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus . 
 yeah . 
 Excuse me , Miss . 
 I'm a graduate student here in mathematics . I've just come from China and I've never used a western library before . I'll be here for five years , so I'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . I wonder if someone might have time to show me around . 
 Sure . 3:30 this afternoon . 
 Thank you . Good-bye . 
 it's furnished two bedroom flat in a three-story building on campus . 
 it's not as bad as I thought it would be . The freshmen that live nearby are really loud , especially on the weekends . But , the rent is much cheaper than private housing , so it's worth it . 
 no , but we do have to pay 9 months rent in 6 months , so for the first months we pay 1/2 month's rent each month . 
 no , it's all included . Besides , students don't have to pay council tax , so we're saving quite bit of money by living here . 
 that's the bad thing---the contract ends in June , so we'll have to find a new apartment soon . 
 not yet . I'm hoping we'll be able to find something cheap once all the students leave the city for the summer . 
 Have you seen the news that there is a serious flood in the South ? 
 What a pity ! I know you've been longing for it these months . 
 You should have seen the T . V . show that was on last night , the topic it covered was really interesting , animal rights . 
 Yes , but we can ’ t deny that animals are vulnerable , defenseless , and are completely at the mercy of human beings . 
 You can ’ t compare apples and oranges . I believe that both topics are important and that we can ’ t ignore them , the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance . I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching . 
 As long as you don ’ t treat it better than your wife , it ’ s fine . 
 What ’ s it for ? 
 Oh , that ’ s a nice idea . Well , it ’ s fine if you take our picture . 
 Just dab it all over your face and then take a look at the symbols that appear . 
 Those are money bags , and they represent your financial situation . 
 That's Madame Psychic to you . 
 Well , you have three hearts — lucky in love tonight . Dress up and go on a date ! 
 it's ok . It seems we have a lot in common . 
 he is tall and slim , fair-haired . 
 he is a nice guy and very considerate . I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor . 
 No , I didn't . And you ? Was it good ? 
 How much was the ticket ? 
 Hi , nice to hear from you , when does your plane leave ? 
 Good . 
 Will you help me take these things to the car ? 
 Bring them to my wife's car . 
 The blue SUV in front of the Honda . 
 That chair over there , but please be careful with it . It was a gift from my mother-in-law . 
 Let me help you with that . I don't want you to hurt your back . 
 Didn't I tell you ? We're moving to Florida ? 
 Yes , that's true , but my wife found a new apartment on the Internet the other day and she wants to move right away . 
 Yes , I did . I passed ! 
 Well , I certainly couldn't have done it without your help . You are the best tutor I've ever had . 
 You deserve credit , too . I've learned so much from You . 
 I had to look after my son at home . 
 He has a fever . 
 I think so.Thank you . 
 That's for sure . I feel like I'm melting . 
 I'm in a good mood today , actually . How about you ? 
 what's wrong ? 
 I see ! Do you want to ask her out ? 
 you can ask her out for drink after work . 
 then you've got a lot of homework to do . You need to get her notice first . 
 you can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying hello to her . 
 that's something you need to overcome . Men should make the first move as most of girls prefer being chased . 
 good luck ! 
 Don't mention it.Don ' t forget to take your daughter along next time . 
 Lisa , would you like to go to the library with me ? 
 Sure . First we'll go buy a newspaper and then we'll go to the library . 
 The weather is really nice today . Let's walk . 
 Alright , then let's take an umbrella . Is your brother coming with us ? 
 Wow , it's already 10:00 AM . He must have been up late last night . 
 I hope he can come later . 
 How do we get to the library from here ? 
 Hi , Lucy , you are very popular with people around you , what are your tricks ? 
 Sharing knowledge can be very settled and some second stances . People may think you are telling them how to do their work . If they take it personally , they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work . 
 You are quite right . Thank you for sharing your experience with me . I learned a lot . 
 how was your education going on in Australia ? 
 where are you going to work then , in Australia or back in China ? 
 why are you choosing to leave a foreign country ? Many people are reluctant to leave the superior living environment abroad . 
 yeah , China's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country . 
 the rapidly expanding economy has encouraged many students to pack their bags AMD head for home . 
 How do you like this dress ? 
 Something attractive and dressy . Maybe a little sexy too . New Year's Eve is a special occasion and it only happens once a year , right ? 
 People here always wear the best clothes they have . Many people go out and buy clothes especially for New Year's Eve . 
 Before the New Year , we always send greeting cards to our relatives and friends to wish them a happy year . On the street and in stores people usually greet others with a ' Happy New Year ' . It's also common for people to make a New Year's resolution . 
 It's when people quit a bad habit or do something they find hard to do . Many people resolve to quit smoking , lose weight , or stop nagging their wife , etc . However , it usually lasts only for a few days ! 
 We're going to a night club for dinner and dancing , then we'll go down to the city square for the big celebration . There's always a fireworks display put on by the local government . We all want you to come too . 
 My name's McDonald . 
 It's M , C , capital D . 
 Sounds like a good plan . What do you want to see ? 
 Ah , my girlfriend wanted to see that movie . I have to take her later so I don't want to watch it ahead of time . How about The Cube ? 
 How scary can it be ? Come on , it'll be fun . 
 That's the spirit . I'll see you tomorrow after class . 
 Could you help me to register for a class ? 
 Are there any Psychology classes available ? 
 On what days are the classes ? 
 Can you tell me about the other class ? 
 You're positive that these are the only classes left ? 
 The class on Monday and Wednesday will be fine . 
 Which season do you like best ? 
 I like autumn , too . Where I'm from , Autumn is the best time of year . 
 I want it short . 
 It will do . 
 It was great . I had a really good time . 
 Well , I had English from 9 o'clock to 11 o'clock , art from 12 o'clock to 2 o'clock , and math from 2 o'clock to 4 o'clock . 
 To be honest , I liked all of them , except for the math teacher . Though he must be quite young , he seem like an old person . He ’ s so boring ! 
 She was great . In today ’ s class , she gave us a lecture on how to be a good student . She told us not to arm for exams , and to pay more attention on communicating than memorizing . 
 She said that she ’ s from a small town in the middle of America . 
 Not everything , but nearly . She speaks very clearly and doesn ’ t use very complex words so that it is easy for us to understand her . 
 Yes ... with flying colors ! 
 It ’ s a new phrase that she taught us today . It means that I will not only pass the class , but I will do extremely well ! 
 I hope so . 
 not today . She said she wanted us to relax tonight instead of doing homework , 
 I know you're sleepy and I hate to bother you , but I think you're late for work . 
 Don't worry . I can give you a lift . 
 Annie , what is troubling you ? You look unhappy . 
 Do you like him ? 
 Then why are you hesitating ? 
 One love drives out another . You shouldn't be afraid to start a new relationship . 
 How's work ? 
 The police need our help finding a robber . 
 The TV news is reporting a bank robbery . 
 Yes , he's 6 feet tall , 200 pounds , black hair , and about 30 years old . 
 They didn't say . 
 Of course not . That would be racist . 
 Don't ask me . 
 What are the pop groups that you like ? 
 I agree ! I cried for a week when they broke up . 
 David , imagine meeting you here ! 
 All right ! I stayed up yesterday and waited for your vegetables . I stole your peaches and flowers . 
 How many vegetables do you steal today ? 
 So funny . By stealing , I forgot all my sorrows and pressure from work . 
 I really want to be far away from the reality now . 
 Mom ? 
 Can my friend , Tom Mitchum , come home with me for lunch tomorrow ? 
 Mm — hmm . You met him last summer . He is small and very smart . 
 Yes . 
 Never ! He ’ s over 80 , isn ’ t he ? 
 Good gracious ! Are you sure ? 
 Is she really ? 
 Really ? Quite a woman , isn ’ t she ? 
 I ’ m sorry registration has closed . 
 Well , that ’ s not possible . The computer ’ s official student account has already been sent to the state . And that ’ s what our budget is based on . Who told you that anyway ? 
 She must have been a part-time worker . They didn ’ t have much training . Why didn ’ t you register then ? 
 Huh , that is no reason to demand a birth certificate . We only need to establish residency , you know , a phone bill with your name and address on it would have been fine . 
 Yes , I am afraid she gave you the wrong information . 
 Well , I sympathize with your problem , but , to be honest , I don ’ t think there is any thing anyone can do for you . You were trapped in the system.If you want , you can talk to the director . She will help you if she can . 
 Don ’ t get your hopes up . 
 Sorry , I thought you knew . 
 Didn't I ? 
 Well , I'm telling you now . 
 I didn't think you'd be interested . 
 Sorry , I didn't think it mattered . 
 Will you give your friends a buzz and put out a feeler to see if they like to offer me a loan ? 
 I just want to make sure that there is possibility of giving us a loan . 
 Hello , Jim . Where are you going ? 
 No , thanks . I'm going home . My wife's expecting me . 
 Do you go to the cinema a lot ? 
 Do you know what's on tonight by any chance ? 
 Oh , I see . By the way , where are you going for your holidays this year ? 
 Oh , does she ? That's convenient . 
 Don't you like the sea ? 
 I'm going to stay at home . 
 No , I want to buy a car , and that's going to take every penny I've got . 
 You did ? that is great ! 
 No I am free , I will be there , what time the thing starting ? 
 Ok , great , should I bring anything ? 
 sure , I will be happy to bring a few , what is the address ? 
 Got it . 
 I read everything I can get my hands on but I like love stories best . What do you think about the love stories ? 
 I don't think so . I like them . Then what's your favorite book ? 
 Oh , the history books are dull to me . 
 Many of the slower dances are danced to the lyrics of tragedies . He meant that you turned it into a comedy . 
 He meant it in a good way . You added a little spice to the performance . 
 Of course ! That's why I always say , Eat , drink and be Greek ! 
 How can I help you ? 
 Let me take your temperature with a thermometer . 
 I think you have a small fever . 
 You should've called in sick ! Next time , have either of your parents call the school office . 
 Sure . What do you expect to know ? 
 And you shouldn't miss the Louvre Museum . You can stay there for at least a whole day . 
 The night life there . It's so romantic ! 
 I went there in August , and it was hot . But I was told autumn is the best season . 
 This shirt you gave me is not my favorite brand . 
 Which film shall we see ? 
 Yes , I'd love to.Here is a good one , Mozart and Beethoven.It ' s on the Festival Hall.Shall we go there ? 
 No , I'm not hungry . 
 Did you take my money from the table ? 
 Both our countries are quite small . How would you describe the landscape in your country ? 
 Is it really completely flat ? 
 Yes , there are . They are not very big compared with the mountains in other countries . 
 That doesn ’ t sound too bad . Great for sunbathing ! The coast of my country changes even within a few kilometers . There are cliffs , then sandy beaches . Then rocks . There are lots of caves in the cliffs . 
 We also have waterfalls in the mountains . They make the landscapes look very scenic . The landscape has been shapes by millions of years of erosion , especially by water . 
 Guess what ? He has just got the sack . 
 Exactly . 
 Yes , it is . 
 No , she ’ s average . 
 They ’ re dark gray . 
 It ’ s blond . 
 I don ’ t know . 
 Really ? I ’ Ve never heard of it ! 
 I think Mary must be sad , because she loves her husband very much . 
 Really ? Do I look happy all the time ? 
 Oh , do you know why ? Actually , it ’ s easy . Because I always exercise . My exercise , I think , is very hard . I often feel very good after conquering these difficulties . I feel alive ! 
 Yeah , they are doing it for fun . Seldom would people like my exercise . It ’ s difficult and boring . 
 But I think Chinese students need to exercise more . Besides exercise will help them learn new things better . Don ’ t students want to have a good memory ? 
 Well , do what you like to do . It can be anything . Jogging , doing aerobics , going bicycling , and playing ping-pong . Absolutely anything . Doing three or more workouts a week is good for you . But remember to do some stretches first . 
 The woman was beaten again . Why didn ’ t she call the police . 
 It is incredible . 
 Now let's begin the class . Who is on duty today ? 
 Please come to the front to have five minutes ’ free talk in English . Very well ! Whose turn is it to have a free talk ? 
 Well . Don't forget to perform your duty next time , ok ? Now , let's start our lesson . 
 Oh , I no longer work there . I'm working with a multi-national corporation . 
 I want to try different things before I find the one I really like . 
 I could handle everything pretty well in the old position , so I decided to move around and learn something new . 
 I'm pretty satisfied with it . I can broaden my experience , learn lots of new things , and have more development opportunities . 
 Yes . Why ? 
 So ? 
 You are attracted to her . That sounds great , but how do you know that it is a crush or it's real love ? 
 That's a big question . Well , if you are in love , maybe you ’ ll take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all . 
 And you think about her all the time ? 
 And maybe you suddenly have new interests . I mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid , ie.You used to sleep in every morning , but because she jogs every morning , then you begin to like jogging . 
 Oh , congratulations ! Sounds like you ’ Ve found your soul mate . 
 Yeah , that's right . If you find this person is more and more important to you and you can totally trust her , then you can stay in love . 
 While staying in love is even better . 
 I know it's not good for me , but the problem is I just can't help it . 
 I'll try . 
 I don't know . 
 Don't waste time . 
 But it's none of our business . 
 Please sit down and make yourself at home . Please don ’ t stand on ceremony . 
 I ’ m glad that you like it . This is only the first time that I made it . 
 Sure , we call it doubt . 
 Huh , oh , hi , Jane . I must have fallen asleep while I was reading . 
 Well , the dorm ’ s too noisy to study in , and I guess this place is too quiet . 
 No . Prof . Grant told us to write about anything in cultural anthropology . For once I wish she hadn ’ t given us so much of a choice . 
 I am , but there is too much material to cover . I ’ ll be writing forever , and Grant only wants five to seven pages . 
 That ’ s not a bad idea . I brought many plenty of books and things back with me last summer . That would be great resource material . Now if I can only remember where I put them . 
 Do you think you'll be interested in studying law later ? 
 You want to be a politician ? Yuck . 
 Sorry , you're right . I think you'll be a good politician . 
 You're right . We need more people like you in politics . 
 Okay , I will . 
 It doesn't matter . I just feel a little dizzy . 
 I don't know . 
 Well , let me see ... Do you work at IBM Corporation ? 
 Now I remember . We met at a conference in Tokyo last year . 
 That ’ s really unbearable . 
 So get prepared for everything . 
 My husband and I have thought about it , but we ’ Ve decided not to have any . They are just too expensive . Besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of world we ’ ll have in the future . What about you ? 
 For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn ’ t ever have to share . 
 No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . you know , I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ’ home . What do you think of the one-child policy in China ? 
 That ’ s true . But as a woman , I ’ m glad that even though I don ’ t want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have . On the other hand , I can ’ t imagine what China would be like if there weren ’ t a one-child policy ! 
 I don ’ t know what other people think , but I , for one , envy only children ! 
 Oh , that's all right . I just wondered what was keeping you . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Oh , did you ? That's very easy to do . 
 I ’ Ve been away on holidays for sometime . 
 I went with my husband . Our first stop was Bangkok . We stayed there for 5 days . Then we flew to Hong Kong , stopover for 3 days . Our last stop was China . We visited the Great Wall . 
 Yes . We enjoyed ourselves very much . Have you traveled much , Luke ? 
 I think I need a new notebook ... 
 You bet there is . Feast your eyes on this puppy ! 
 Believe it ! 
 Is there a lot of crime in your city ? 
 It ’ s the same in my city . We also have a lot of drug addicts . A lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs . 
 Some people believe that a tough approach is better . Other prefer a more lenient approach . 
 That ’ s possible , but I ’ m not sure it would really happen like that . 
 It's user friendly . 
 I need to return a book . 
 I would also like to check out this video . 
 Yes , just the video . 
 Here you go . 
 Oh , I will . 
 I understand . Thank you very much . 
 Not bad . But too hot for me today . 
 Absolutely . Who were you playing with ? 
 Really ? Oh , well , in that case we should play together some time . What's your handicap ? 
 No kidding ! I'm 16 , too . We should definitely play together some time . My name's Bob . 
 Me too . So , do you like the course ? 
 Well , they used to , but they got rid of them because of environmental concerns . 
 Actually , in my opinion , the carts were better because you don't have to tip them . 
 Possibly , but I still miss them ! What bothers me is that the heat makes the caddies ' life quite hard . One member's caddy fainted last week ! 
 Right . Luckily it was on the eighteen hole , quite near the clubhouse , so he didn't have far to carry him . 
 Yup . 
 No , that's okay , I already have a coke.Why don't you have a seat , you look like you've been on your feet all day . 
 It's great ! The mountains here are beautiful and the skiing is spectacular.Have you been here for a long time ? 
 What do you do for a living ? 
 Wow , talk about job perks ! That's great . I would like to do something exciting like that.But I am only an accountant.Not too much excitement there.huh ? 
 What are you doing ? 
 There are no countries marked on the map . 
 The thing that I find most surprising is that most of the world is covered with water . Compared to the oceans , most countries are tiny . 
 Rivers have created deep valleys and canyons like the grand can you . 
 It ’ s all so interesting . I ’ ll have to find more information about it on the internet . Or perhaps I should try and attend your geography class . 
 I'll try to speak more clearly . 
 It's hard to say . But I do love waltz very much . 
 To tell the truth , I don't like it . 
 Oh , it's really beautiful , but I just can't dance it well . 
 OK . I'll have a try . 
 Thank you for your compliment . 
 I heard many stories about your brother . 
 What does he look like ? Is he handsome ? 
 Do you know that Jack got divorced last month . 
 Jack always lives by his wits and he cannot support his family . 
 Why do you look so sad ? 
 Why not go and see a doctor ? 
 I'll always remember my college days . 
 It was one of the best times in my life . It was tough , but I made it . I became a college graduate . 
 it was a round day for me . My family attend the graduation ceremony . I was so nervous . I couldn't find my cap and gown , but all worked out in the end . 
 I was planning to attend gradate school , but then I was offered a good job doing marketing , so I changed my mind . 
 I sure am . So what about you ? How did you feel when you graduated ? 
 how could it be ? 
 you didn't have an offer ? 
 I think you lack in the power of decision . Once you make your decision , don't be overtaken by misgivings and fear . Just go full steam ahead ! 
 Thank you , Joe . What would you like to drink with your meal ? I can offer you wine , mango juice , or water . 
 Excellent choice . Can I dish you up some chicken ? 
 How about some salad to go with your chicken ? 
 Would you like to have rice with your chicken ? 
 Good ! Julie , if you could pass this plate down to Joe , I think we are all set . 
 Usually we have a month off . 
 I'll stay at home and have a complete rest . 
 She must be very sad . 
 At a time like this , what she needs is a pat on the back rather than a blame . 
 Really ? That's a straws in the wind . 
 Yeah . They suit each other . A perfect match between a man and a girl . 
 So cool ! Can I get a load of it ? 
 I got it a while ago , but I haven't worn it much . You really like it ? 
 It's white gold . 
 My boyfriend took me to the Shane Co . and he let me pick it out . 
 That's the best part . It wasn't for anything special . He just wanted to buy me something . 
 My birthday is coming up . We'll find out pretty soon . 
 I wouldn't mind a necklace . I was at the jewelry shop looking around , and they have a couple of beautiful necklaces I want . 
 I don't think I'm ready for a ring from him yet . 
 Akha . 
 I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . But I don ’ t like traveling to work , waiting for buses , or ... 
 Exactly . 
 Hi , Tom . How have you been ? 
 What are you doing ? 
 Mumm . no . 
 What ? 
 I have no idea what you ’ re talking about . The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl . 
 Sounds interesting , but soccer doesn ’ t really appeal to me . 
 All I know about soccer is that you can ’ t use your hands and that players are always falling down , trying to get a free kick or penalty kick . It seems like a sissy sport to me ! 
 Do you often do exercise ? 
 OK , and what kind of sports do you usually play ? 
 You ? Play badminton ? That's unbelievable ! You are shorter than a racket . 
 Says who ? 
 Oh , I see . 
 I'm a real man , and I like football . 
 I like Renaldo the most . 
 You have to bring me an add sheet to sign . Do you have one ? 
 You must take the signed add slip to the Admissions and Records Office to add the class . Do you know where that is ? 
 The office is in front of you as you cross the quad . The signs in the hallway will tell you where you need to be . 
 You'll find it easily . Make sure you add the class and then we will look at the roll sheet later to make sure that you were added on . 
 To drop a class , you need to do the same thing with a drop slip . Good luck ! 
 Nothing really , why , what ' s up ? 
 Sounds great , i ' d very much like having something thanks , when ? 
 Do you need help setting up or anything ? I don't mind . I like to do that kind of thing . It's fun and I have a good eye for decorating . 
 Ok , I will see you again . 
 Did you understand question number three ? 
 Excuse me , I wonder if you could help me ? 
 Well , I hate to have to say this , but I'm not happy with my room . 
 Well , the traffic is very loud . I got no sleep last night . 
 What's the weather like in your city ? 
 The summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 or25 in my city . The rain falls mostly in the winter . And we often get snow . 
 In winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that . The streets are often icing in the morning . With high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms . 
 We do have a few fog days in winter . But I would not say we have a lot of fogs . The sky are usually clearly in your city , are they ? 
 Have you ever had snow in your city ? 
 The river in my city sometime freeze over . People go ice-skating on it . In summer people go boating on the river . But few people go swimming because it is not very clean . 
 Look ! It's clearing up . 
 I like summer as long as it's bright like this . 
 Hello ! Let me introduce myself . My name is Nancy . 
 No , I just started working here at IBM , I am assigned sale department . 
 I main market reasearch , and you ? 
 Really ? I don't believe I would met him , is he here now ? 
 Thanks , that's would be lovely . You'r right , he is kind and nice looking . 
 You'd just let sleeping dogs lie . 
 Anything you say or do might make it worse . Just try to ride out the storm for a while . 
 You'd better leave her alone . 
 Just tell her off . 
 Well , no one could survive without water , but you see pollution has been making more and more water unable for drinking . 
 But what are the sources of water pollution ? 
 Well , direct ones are the pollution directly from factories , refineries waste treatment plants etc . , aren ’ t they ? 
 But what about the indirect ones ? 
 I see . For the sake of us all , we should be an active participator in the prevention of it . 
 Hi , Bill . I saw you yesterday with a pretty girl . 
 Are you sure she is the right girl ? 
 What type of girl is she ? 
 Oh , that's great . You're serious this time . 
 I almost did ! Actually , I don't know that much about coffee , even though I sell it . 
 Thanks . Maybe if things slow down later I'll stop by your table . 
 Rita . Nice to meet you . 
 Yes , I do . I also use an anti-spyware program and a firewall . There are so many nasties on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . You have to be very careful and keep you computer clean . 
 I usually run it every few days . It finds a virus about half the time . 
 How you tried this one ? It ’ s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . You can also download updates for free . 
 Just a minute ... go to this one . I ’ ll send you an email with the line in it . It only takes a few minutes to download . Then you have to go through the set up procedures . But they are not complicated . 
 I use it for several things-surfing the net , word processing and creating presentations . I don ’ t play many games on my computer , but I do a lot of work with photographs . Using c computer program , you can edit and resize photographs . You can also make them brighter or darker and cut pieces from different photographs to create new ones . 
 I like pop music very much . 
 I said I like pop music very much.It ' s so lovely . 
 John , you look pale . What happened ? 
 Did you have something on your mind ? You look so concerned ! Maybe I can help you ! 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 I know your feeling . Take it easy and say something to me if you like . 
 Not at all ! 
 I'm not feeling too well . I've caught a cold . 
 Hasn't it ! It's been cold and windy recently.Do you like the weather here ? 
 Oh , I'm going for a trip to New York this autumn . What's the weather like in New York ? 
 Is it cold in autumn there ? Should I take any warm clothes with me ? 
 You seem to have all the jitters about Jane . 
 Keep your fingers crossed . She'll bring home the bacon . 
 Thanks for your help . 
 Let me know if I can do anything for you . 
 They are a nice middle-aged couple , just like us . 
 Of course they are . 
 Oh , we are the part on the edge of middle . That's all . 
 Oh , fool ! You're nearly seventy and I'm in the low sixties . Would you like to spend the rest of the afternoon squabbling about this ? 
 How should we commemorate the centenary of the founding of the university ? We have been given quite a large budget to pay for some events . 
 Do you think that we should invite alumni and former professors ? 
 Good idea . We should also hold a series of presentations . We could have presentations on the history of the university , the courses we offer , and our links with other universities . 
 We could have another on the successes of graduates from here . 
 That ’ s an excellent idea . Hopefully , we would be able to make a profit ! A few professors and students are writing a book on the history of the university . 
 A group of students from the art and music faculty are producing a short film . 
 Your knowledge of English is really surprising . 
 No , seriously . I'm impressed . 
 What's your name ? 
 How are you , Sam ? 
 Where are you from , Sam ? 
 What is your job ? 
 Excuse me , are you Miss Green ? 
 May I introduce myself ? 
 I ’ m a new student in the school . My name ’ s John . 
 It ’ s a pleasure to meet you , Miss Green . 
 Yes , but I'm not sure what exactly I would need . 
 That would be a definite bonus . 
 How can we do that ? 
 No . 
 That sounds great . Thanks . 
 I'm not quitting yet . You know my favourite slogan , don't you ? 
 Right ! 
 Ok . 
 Ahahah , and I thought you were tired . 
 It sure looks special , looks expensive too . 
 Don't worry , Mary , I've got you covered . 
 Now darling , I know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . I think we should sell it . 
 But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished . 
 Well , only you liked it really , darling . 
 I am not sure what to do during the holidays , any suggestions ? 
 The problem is that I find all of them are full of fun . I just don ’ t know what to do first . 
 Actually , I ’ m interested in all of them . The more choices we have , the harder to make a decision . 
 There is too much traffic in Taipei these days , I think cars should be banned . 
 Well , why not use buses or the MET ? 
 Why not ? There is nothing wrong with our buses and trains . 
 I want to try my hand at the stocks . 
 Don ’ t worry . I know there are no pennies from heaven . I will work hard . 
 What do you think of the new mayor ? 
 Hello , is this People's Theater ? 
 Yes , are advance tickets for ' Nut croakers ' still available ? 
 October 16th . 
 7:30 p . m . performance , please . 
 I'd like to reserve two seats at 100 yuan , please . 
 Du Kun . 
 Tomorrow . 
 How do we cancel , just in case ? 
 All right , thank you very much . Good bye . 
 Excuse me . In this museum , you are not supposed to take pictures . 
 Will you give me your camera ? We have to confiscate your film . 
 We will keep and return it later . 
 You can buy them at the souvenir shop near the exit . 
 I have already known that . I didn't get the scholarship , right ? 
 Can you help me ? You know I do need the scholarship . 
 Thank you . I will . 
 Well , Jim . It is a combination of how much you eat , the type of food you eat , and when you eat your meals . 
 That's a big mistake , you should always have a good breakfast . You will not run your car without fuel , and as well you won't expect your body to work without food . 
 I bet you eat a large evening meal , then sit and watch TV or read a book . Then instead of burning off your energy , your body stores it as fat . 
 Well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits . 
 I am confused . How could a golfer need so many clubs ? Seems to me , 14 altogether , right 
 Then what makes a ' set ' of clubs ? 
 So many ? 
 Have you heard of Tiger Woods ? 
 Do you remember John from head office ? 
 Have you heard what happened to him ? 
 He had his car stolen . Actually he was kidnapped while he was in the car . 
 Well , apparently , he was just getting into his car-he'd parked it in one of those underground multi-story things-he was just getting in and suddenly three guys with guns opened the back doors of the car and got in . 
 In Taichung , I think . 
 Really ? Well , anyway , they pointed their guns at him and said , you know , keep calm and drive out . ... we don't want to hurt you ... we just want your car . 
 Well , he drove out , and when he got to the booth to pay the attendant , he pretended to have an epileptic fit , you know , to scare the thieves away . The attendant was no help at all , even though the guys were holding guns in plain view , he did nothing . 
 Yes , makes you think , doesn't it ? 
 Well , he kept on pretending to have a fit , so they freaked out and just ran away . 
 I'll say . 
 Yeah , this is my first visit here . 
 Thanks , but I speak English with a strong German accent . 
 On and off , for quite a few years . 
 I did for a while , I suppose , until I left university , but after that not really . 
 Oh yes , how's she getting on ? 
 What , from Peter ? 
 I hear that Helen does not relate very well to her husband . 
 So what ? Things have changed . 
 Yes . What will you do these two days ? 
 But I'd prefer to stay at home and have a good rest . 
 Ah ? Really ? That stinks ! 
 Wow , you were pulling my leg all along . I was really fooled . 
 Did you have a good holiday ? 
 How are you doing ? 
 What movies have you seen lately ? 
 What type of movie is that ? 
 I can't believe you are watching movies . The weather is great . You should be outside . 
 What else do you like to do besides watching movies ? 
 Out of those what is your favorite ? 
 What is your favorite computer game ? 
 If you like to play so much , when do you ever exercise ? 
 That's pretty good . By the way , what are you doing next Saturday ? 
 I am having a party Saturday night at my house . If you have time , you should come . 
 Great . I'll see you on Saturday . 
 Thanks a lot for having us . We had a good time . 
 Thanks . By the way , tell your wife she throws a great party . 
 Mike , these flowers are just gorgeous . 
 I can ’ t thank you enough . I ’ m really touched . I don ’ t know what to say . 
 You ’ re the best ! 
 Great idea ! I do it every so often . 
 Yep . If you are a good singer , your audience will feel comfortable , right ? 
 I remembered Tom is always out of tune . We burst into laughter . 
 So tricky ! 
 What happened ? 
 Where there are difficulties , there are ways to get over them . Hold on ! 
 Oh , really ? No wonder that she looks quite depressed recently . 
 I heard they were just married for half a year . 
 Yeah . Mixed marriage is tempting but full of culture shock . 
 Maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married . 
 Where do you usually do your shopping , Mrs . Lane ? 
 How do you find the prices there ? 
 I see you have bought some coffee . Would you mind telling me how much you paid for it ? 
 Hello , what can I do for you ? 
 How long will you stay with the host family ? 
 Usually the host family prepares at least two meals a day for you . 
 I cannot understand why she always helps and supports her brother . 
 Because he is often in trouble . 
 Oh , I see . 
 I tried when you had gone , but I had no luck . 
 Okay . 
 Me ? I prefer France . 
 Oh , really ? I went to China last winter ! 
 Yes , Friday I have a class right after work . 
 Saturday my parents are coming to town . What's up ? 
 No . Did you want to go do something ? 
 Oh ! That sounds great ! How about six o'clock ? 
 Is that right ? 
 Do you want to go out for dinner tonight ? 
 I'm starving , so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions . 
 I'm not really in the mood for Italian , actually . I was thinking of something a bit spicy . 
 I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy . 
 The Taj ? They're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food . 
 Shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ? 
 That's right . It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway . 
 Are you sure ? We could go Dutch . 
 I won't argue with that ! Let's go ! 
 Yes I have . I went to the table tennis yesterday . 
 Oh . It was great . I love Ma Lin . He ’ s my favourite table tennis player . Have you seen anything yet ? 
 Well , let ’ s go to the marathon tomorrow then ! We can just stand by the side of the road . 
 Hi ! Dear ! I'm waiting for you . 
 You know , although we've chatted twice , I've been thinking of you already . 
 & you ? 
 Oh , thanks . I wanna see the real you . 
 OK ! Before that I'll take this one as you . 
 Cute , like you . 
 Me too . Send you a kiss ... 
 Hello . 
 How are you ? 
 Good . Do you speak English ? 
 Yes . 
 I'm from California . 
 Nice to meet you too . 
 I heard it . 
 Just let it be . Her rudeness will come back to haunt her . 
 There are three , my parents and I . 
 No , I live alone in a flat near my work place . 
 Yes , almost once a week . 
 But he's really kind at heart . 
 I'm glad to have had the opportunity to meet you here . 
 I'm doing great , thank you . 
 What do you think of the Olympic motto ' Higher , faster and stronger ' ? 
 Why ? In my opinion , it doesn't matter whether you won or not . The most important thing is participation . 
 So Chris , I've heard that you're from a big family . How many people ? 
 Seven children ? That's a lot . Why did your parents have so many ? 
 Jeez , seven children . That must have a lot of problems . We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right . 
 Like what ? I assume that there's no privacy . 
 And the age gap is also annoying . There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me . We have nothing in common . 
 John , if you don't mind , I'd like to ask you a personal question . 
 All right.Are you married ? 
 Then , when do you plan to get married ? 
 Miss Fallen , can you tell me why you want to get a visa to the States ? 
 And do you have the Letter of Acceptance from the University with you ? 
 Thank you very much . And do you have any proof of the financial support for the three years ? 
 Could I see that , please ? 
 Thanks very much . Well , I'll be able to give you a visa for one year , a student visa , that is . 
 Yes , it is a three-year , but you can renew the visa each year in the States . It is our usual procedure . 
 It's a lovely day out today , isn't it ? 
 What's the weather forecast for tomorrow ? 
 That doesn't sound pretty . 
 Well , I was going to drive to Birmingham to see some friends . 
 I suppose I should . I don't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . Do you have any plans for tomorrow ? 
 If you're lucky , it'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day ! 
 That sounds like fun . 
 English weather is even more predictable than I had previously thought . 
 Yes , there are many cities where it's almost always warm.San Diego , for example . 
 Many.Most of the cities in the southern part of the United States are hot all year . 
 Most people grow accustomed to the climate , but there are many others who complain about it all the time . 
 Several.Two good examples are Seattle , in the state of Washington , and Portland , Oregon . 
 In the north there are many cities which are very cold in the winter.Boston and Chicago are two of them . 
 Oh , no.On the contrary , there are many beautiful days , especially in the spring and fall . 
 Promise you are not going to be angry ? 
 I forgot . 
 Ah , ah , you promised , and remember ? 
 Yes . It has been a long time since the last time we met . 
 No . I've been visiting relatives recently . 
 I went to visit an uncle in San Francisco . 
 No . Why ? 
 Great . Let's talk over coffee . 
 You shouldn't be so negative.You ' ll always have some co-workers that are harder to work with than others.But if you are negative and start name-calling in the office , it will make a bad working environment for everybody . 
 Everybody has their strengths and weaknesses.Even Larry.He might be a pain to be around , but he's also very good at staying in budget on projects.Mary , on the other hand , spends our project money like there's no tomorrow.Also , she's never willing to stay a little later at the office.She always leaves at 5pm sharp . 
 You're right.He ' s a hard worker , easy to get along with , honest , and he never steals the credit on projects.The only thing he's lacking in is experience . 
 You look pale recently . 
 Take good care of yourself . 
 Watch your step . There's a hole in the sidewalk . 
 I hear little Bob has recovered . 
 The operation was very successful . 
 I can ’ t believe that Anthony is finally getting married ! 
 Don ’ t be mean . Look here come the bridesmaids ! Their dresses look beautiful ! 
 That ’ s the flower girl and the ring bearer . I ’ m pretty sure they ’ re the groom ’ s niece and nephew.Oh , they look so cute ! 
 That ’ s all you ever think about , food ! Oh , I think the bride ’ s coming now ! She looks gorgeous.Wait , what ’ s she doing ? Where ’ s she going ? 
 Hello everyone , and welcome to our CPR for beginners course.First of all , does anyone know what CPR stands for ? 
 That ’ s right ! We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest . 
 Well , basically if your heart stops pumping blood , or your lungs stop pumping air , then we need to get them going again ! That ’ s when we have to apply this procedure . Let ’ s begin ! I need a volunteer . 
 Alright , come here and lay flat on your back . Let ’ s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . We must lift the person ’ s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs . Then we place our mouth over the other person ’ s mouth and blow air two or three times , like this . 
 Madam I ’ m not trying to kiss you ! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency . 
 As I was saying , we blow air through the mouth in this manner . Once this is done , we must try to get the heart going again . To do this , we place our hands over the person ’ s chest , and press down firmly two or three times . 
 You ’ re not going to believe what happened today . You ’ Ve got to promise to keep it to yourself . 
 Today Mr . Leo threw Sally out of class ! 
 I ’ ll say . I knew Sally would finally show her true colors . When she got her final test results back from Mr . Leo , she started yelling at him . You should have heard her . I ’ Ve never seen anyone get so upset before . To make a long story short , it seems that Mr . Leo failed her because he caught her cheating . 
 It serves her right ! 
 He looks strong.What does he do ? 
 He must be very brave . 
 OH , This is the famous Emperor Palace building . 
 Would you like to go to the top ? 
 The view is breath-taking . 
 Oh , not yet . At least have one for the road . 
 Well , I am sorry you have to leave so early . 
 Well , thank you for coming . 
 Bye . 
 Terrible . 
 I ’ Ve got a fever and really a bad headache . 
 I ’ Ve already tried some but it didn ’ t help . 
 Yeah , I guess I should . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Valerie ! Hi ! Wow how have you been ? It ’ s been such a long time ! 
 Really ? Thanks ! I went to that hair salon that you told me about , but enough about me ! Look at you ! You haven ’ t aged a day since the last time I saw you ! What is your secret ! 
 Yes , my little Paul is finally a doctor . They grow up so fast you know . 
 Thank you ! What about your daughter , Pamela ? I heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently . 
 Such a lovely girl . I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday ! 
 Same here ! We will catch up soon , maybe over coffee ! 
 See you soon ! Bye ! Egg ... I can ’ t stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter . 
 I could help you with that . 
 I promise you that I have the time to do this . If I didn't , I wouldn't offer to help . 
 Tomorrow night would work for me . 
 OK , and I'll bring some information that helped me with my presentation . 
 See you tomorrow night . 
 Calm down . 
 Don ’ t think about it ! 
 You pay for the taxi and dinner , then to even things up . 
 Do you know that John isn't going to come back to our school ? 
 He had moved and held a party on July 1st . 
 Even he's not coming back to school anymore , you still can call him and meet him on weekends . 
 I went to Rotes ’ , you know , Edith Roth is the author of a book about moths . 
 I ’ m so thirsty . 
 No . Edith didn ’ t give anything to drink . 
 Oh ! Thank you . 
 I think it ’ s a distance of 180 kilometers from here to London , so it should be a two-hour drive on the motorway . 
 You ’ re right . We will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey , because we will be in built-up area . 
 Ok . You haven ’ t seen my company car , have you ? 
 I think it ’ s over five meters long . I can ’ t remember exactly . It has a maximum speed of over 200 kilometers an hour . 
 We can ’ t . if we went that fast , we would break the speed limit . 
 Well , apparently I ’ Ve run up quite a bill . I was under the impression that the Junior Executive Holiday Package only cost 250 dollars per night . I ’ Ve just been informed that it ’ s actually 500 do 
 But I definitely was led to believe that a three-night stay would be $ 750 . 
 When I booked the room , your staff didn ’ t mention this . And the brochure and your promotional mailings do not mention that . 
 Yes . Have a look . 
 Perhaps you could arrange to provide me with a new bill that reflects the advertised rate . 
 Thank you . 
 It was me . I am so sorry . 
 I had to move it , so that I can get my bike through . 
 I am awfully sorry . I didn't think you would mind so much . 
 I promise . 
 Yes , it's my steak . 
 It's too raw . I wanted mine well done , but this one here is almost medium . 
 Very good . It's done just right this time , thank you . 
 Yes , please give me another Calsberg . 
 No , thank you . I've had enough . 
 Yes , I will have a cup of coffee . 
 Fine with me . I just want to get this over with . It ’ s important we make a clean break . I should have signed a pre-nup . 
 Nothing ! Anyway , you ’ re right , there ’ s no reason this has to be nasty.My lawyer tells me you ’ Ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property , as well as the custody agreement - I keep the cat and you get the dog . So that ’ s done ... finally . 
 Fine , but I ’ m keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me . 
 He ’ s my grandfather , and he never really liked you anyway ! 
 How typical , when are you ever going to use a silver tea set ? Fine ! I don ’ t want to drag this out any longer than necessary . What ’ s next ? What about these old photographs ? 
 Our trip to Italy ! I remember that day . We were going to visit the Trev fountain , and we got caught in the rain ... 
 Oh , we really did have fun back then , didn ’ t we ? 
 Oh Jeff ! I love you too ! I ’ m so glad we didn ’ t have to decide who keeps the motorcycle . 
 Hi ! Ed , what's up ? 
 Doesn't look like it to me . 
 Woo , easy . 
 What are you so ticked off about ? 
 Maybe I can help . 
 You've got to be joking . 
 Well , don't get bend on a ship about it . 
 Yes , I ’ m doing some research on Roman civilization . Do you have any books on the subject ? 
 Can I check this one out ? 
 Ok . And I ’ d like to check these books out . 
 Thanks for your help . 
 When pigs fly ! 
 I still have five seats in the mezzanine . 
 No . Nothing . I'm sorry . 
 Sorry , it ’ s all sold out . 
 We have tickets for the matinee . It starts at 3p . m . 
 Where would you like to sit ? 
 Certainly . 
 I'd be glad to . I love picnicking . 
 Can I bring my camera with me ? 
 I sure will . 
 Yes . After so many years of hard work , I ’ d rather I had an office of my own . 
 I ’ ll be very glad if you would help . 
 Thank you . I wish I would . 
 I can look anybody in the face because I ’ Ve done nothing to make me feel guilty or something . 
 You are flattering me . 
 Yes , I ’ m doing some research on Roman civilization . Do you have any books on the subject ? 
 Can I check this one out ? 
 Ok . And I ’ d like to check these books out . 
 Thanks for your help . 
 Yes . I have three sons . Actually I also have a grandson . 
 I understand . I was in your position before . At that time I couldn ’ t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me . My husband seldom stayed at home . 
 Yes , she did a little . But you see , Americans are different from Chinese . You can ’ t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter . She could baby-sit only once or twice a week . That ’ s it . I had to care for them most of the time . 
 Don ’ t worry . You can take night classes . I did that when I had kids . And soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten . Then you could find a job and work . 
 No . You see , I went back to school to get my Master ’ s Degree when I was in my thirties . You won ’ t be older than that . 
 In what ways ? 
 Ha-ha , so you believe in astrology ? 
 Is that so ? I'm afraid it is too narrow-minded to judge people using astrology . It's all stereotypes ! 
 But as far as I remember , you two caught on like a house on fire when you first met . 
 What does your father do ? 
 What about your mother ? 
 When is your birthday ? 
 Do you usually have a birthday party ? 
 What would you do at the party ? 
 Do you know when people began to sing the song " Happy Birthday " ? 
 Let me tell you the story.In 1892 , Patty Smith Hill and Mildred Hill wrote a song called ' Good Morning to you ' . But later someone added the words ' Happy Birthday ' to their tune . 
 Yes , actually , the song has been sung since its publication in 1932.People all over the world have sung it in many different languages . 
 Shih ! ! Please keep your voice down . There are people reading and studying here . 
 Yes I am . You can check our online catalog to search the book you want based on the genre , title or if you know the author , I can point you towards the right direction . 
 That would be in our children's section . That book shelf there on the right . 
 Do you have a library card ? 
 I just need to see your drivers license or utility bill to prove that you a resident of this state . 
 So you are all set . You can have these books for two weeks . If you need to have them longer , you can bring them here to renew them . If you don't , you get charged ten cents a day for each book . 
 So will you come to work with us ? 
 We'll have to negotiate that . It's a possibility . 
 Don't push your luck , Dave . 
 As soon as you can get here . We'll be waiting for you . 
 It's a little early for those , isn't it ? I still have eight months to go ... 
 I thought we could turn the upstairs study into a baby room . What do you think about lavender ? 
 You got a letter in the mail . 
 What is it ? 
 What does it say ? 
 Are you serious ? 
 Good for you ! 
 I ’ m so proud of you . 
 DO you have any plan for your future ? 
 Many people are striving for going abroad nowadays.It seems to be a trend . 
 Too bad you missed Jane's performance . 
 It was so perfect that it won a unanimous 10 . 
 Yesterday morning was beautiful I thought the sunning was going to continue . 
 I know . I could not believe it when I got hit by that storm . It was pouring with rain all afternoon . 
 If it was sunning all year round there would be drought . You probably would not like it either . 
 The weather forecasters are not good at predicting the weather would be like . Our weather is so changeable . 
 Thank you . I have roses , tulips , and daffodils . Do you like the rockery with the smaller flowers ? 
 Yes , they are . This afternoon , I ’ m going to prune the hedge . 
 Thank you ! That would be very kind of you . I have a saw in the garden shed . 
 Tomorrow , I ’ ll cut the grass . Then the garden will lock perfect . 
 You're late . 
 My phone ? 
 Really ? I had no idea . Let me check.Yes , it's dead . There's no dial tone . 
 But this is terrible . I'm expecting important calls . 
 You know what.The theater guild is supposed to call me and discuss a contract for my play.They are supposed to call me this evening.If I don't have a phone . Oh , what can I do ? 
 Do you have a cell phone ? 
 Can you drive me ? I will go to Ann's house . It isn't far . I can call the theater guild from there and give them her number.She will let us wait in her living room . 
 Yes , I do.At Ann's house I will call the phone company and have them check my line.If they can fix it right away without coming to my house , then we'll just return here.But if not , I need to wait at Ann's house to talk with the theater guild.It ' s very important to me . 
 Yes , let's go . 
 No , don't try to tend me . I'm becoming chubby , and I have to slender down . 
 I don't think so . I know I've put on weight this winter . 
 Yes , to tell you the truth . I am on the diet . 
 When do you leave ? 
 Take care of yourself and don't forget to keep in touch . 
 I wonder if we can change to Channel 26 . 
 A lecture on how to make stir-fried ginger beef , not the boxing you like . 
 What happened to your brother ? 
 Your parents must be worrying about him . 
 Have you talked to him ? 
 Are you having a good time ? 
 Really ? Come on , I'll introduce them to you . 
 This is the first time for me to have a Chinese guest . I hope you like western cooking . 
 Cooking is a hobby with me . I'm always trying to think up new recipes . I hope you like the soup . It's kind of a specialty of mine , so I hope you enjoy it . 
 Thank you for your compliment.Won ' t you try this fish with white sauce ? I'm rather round of it . 
 What sort of western food do you like best ? 
 I find the Chinese dishes wonderful . 
 It's still early . 
 Do you have an add sheet for me to sign ? 
 When you get the signed add slip , you must take it to the Admissions and Records Office or you will not be added . Can you find the office ? 
 Across the courtyard on the right is the office . Follow the signs to the correct line . Is that clear ? 
 You can't miss it . Add the class and then come back . We'll check later to make sure you are on the roll sheet . 
 Do the same thing with a drop slip if you ever need to drop a class . Good luck ! 
 It is in mine too . The biggest issue is water . The climate is dry and so water conservation is very important . 
 Water is rationed . We can only use a certain amount each month . It means that we cannot use some modern household items , like washing machines . They use too much water . 
 Yes , I agree . The air here is much more polluted than in my country . Of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry . 
 The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don ’ t believe that any single country can do anything about it . 
 Ms Anderson , my name is Mike . I am Division Chief of ABC Company . Welcome to Toronto . 
 A pleasure meeting you as well , the flowers are for you . 
 hello , Jason , there is going to be a screening of Final Destination 3 at our campus cinema tomorrow . I plan to go to see it . 
 yeah , I love horror movies . Would you like to go with me tomorrow ? 
 that's funny , I didn't know a big fellow like you could be so soft and timid on the inside . 
 alright , all joking aside , what kinds of moves do you like ? 
 that is to say , you like all genres except for horror movies . 
 not quite . I also greatly enjoy romance and comedy . 
 really ? I haven't heard of it . 
 Ok . I can't wait to see it . Let's go ! 
 Thank you.Good evening , Mr.Dean . 
 I'm Helen Baker . 
 Glad to meet you , too . 
 I'm from New Zealand . 
 I'm a teacher . 
 Congratulations on the new house ! 
 Well , you guys worked hard for it . It's really beautiful . 
 You married Joe , didn't you ? 
 I remember you are in love . 
 It's Greek to me . 
 Who ’ s that boy ? 
 The one next to the telephone . 
 I think he ’ s the boy who just moved into my apartment building . 
 What's happening in that country ? 
 What ’ s the matter , BOB ? 
 What happened ? 
 Can you stand ? 
 what I have to give you a hospital for an ex-treat . 
 It maybe worse than it seems . 
 That's my cousin Hubert.He likes smiling . 
 Sure , he's ready to be friendly with anyone . 
 I like spring best . It is neither too cold nor too hot . Freezing days make me lazy and stuffy days make me lazier . How about you ? 
 How do you get through the stuffy daytime ? 
 Hi , Betty ! Where's your boyfriend ? 
 Guess what ? Paul and Susan are engaged . 
 A week ago ? They met last summer and now just sink . They will be married soon . 
 No , not yet . But Susan says they ’ d like to get married in November or December . Then they ’ ll go to Hawaii for their honeymoon . 
 Not bad . How about you , John ? 
 When were you born may I ask ? 
 Do you know what it was according to the lunar calendar ? 
 By the way , could you tell me when the film will begin ? 
 I am afraid I can't be there on time . 
 I don't want to miss it today . 
 But the rain has been pouring down for two days . We ’ Ve both caught colds . 
 How unlucky ! Let ’ s pack our bags and go home . 
 Hey , Andrew . How's everything with work ? 
 Really ? What's he been doing ? 
 Are you ? What are you busy with ? 
 So Kim , have you ever had anything stolen ? 
 My uncle just had his motorcycle stolen a few nights ago . I was just thinking about how clever criminals are these days . 
 I don ’ t know . The ones who stole my uncle ’ s motorcycle were pretty good . 
 He did . It was one of the best ones available . But that didn ’ t stop them from disabling it . And on a crowded street too . 
 You would think that people would be smart enough to stop something like that . No one knew his motorcycle was being stolen . The thieves came in a truck and convinced everybody that my uncle was parked illegally and they were there to tow it away . 
 That ’ s not the end . They were so good that they convinced a bystander to help them lift the motorcycle and put it in the truck . 
 Why , that's very kind of you , Mrs . Johnson . I'm sure my wife will be glad to . 
 Tomorrow afternoon would be fine . 
 I think it is good if we know enough about career planning . We will make wiser choices . What else did he tell you about it ? 
 Sounds practical ! To be honest , sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career . I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills . 
 Ok , then we can sign up for it together . 
 Um ? 
 As you like . 
 It doesn ’ t make any difference to me . 
 Leave me alone . 
 I need to copy some pages in my book . 
 Do I need to pay to use it ? 
 How much do you charge ? 
 Is there a maximum number of copies I can make ? 
 I ’ m going to need you to show me how to use the machine . 
 Thank you for your help . 
 Yes , I have been working for eight hours . 
 No , really . I'm not in the mood for it . 
 No . I ’ Ve not had the pleasure of meeting her yet . 
 How do you do ? 
 What would you like to drink ? 
 So , what do you think ? How do you like New York ? 
 Yeah . I really like the stores and the shopping . 
 But the traffic is pretty bad . 
 Listen , it's almost dinnertime.There are lots of restaurant around here.What do you want to try ? Italian ? Greek ? Japanese ? Thai ? 
 OK . Let's go American . Where's the nearest McDonald's ? 
 You should ask for a holiday and relax yourself for a little bit . You worked so hard . 
 What's that ? 
 For me ? 
 Wow ! It's big ! What could it be ? 
 What does that mean , not big but fat ? You didn't buy ... 
 I'll just have water . 
 I went bankrupt and I'm flat broke now . 
 Thank you . 
 Me too . I'll talk to you later . 
 Hi , Natasha , how's life ? 
 Oh , you must be very happy . How many people are there in your family ? 
 I have a small family . They are my parents , my younger brother and me . 
 Yes , it did . But my parents are ethnic minority people . It's a preferential policy for an ethnic minority family to have two children . 
 The child must feel very longly . My younger brother is 10 years younger than me . Before he was born , I used to be the only child and always dreamed that I would have a younger sister or brother one day . 
 Yes , we are very close . He is 12 years old now and very smart . He always makes us laugh a lot . 
 Thank you . 
 I don't think so . 
 That suits me fine . 
 Do you really think so ? 
 I think , in some way it is an act of God , but in another way , it just is caused by us . 
 We didn't pay attention to the environment , cut down trees and polluted the air . 
 Good morning , Mary ! 
 I want to have a few friends over for a dinner party to celebrate my birthday . Would you be able to come the next weekend on Saturday ? 
 Yes , if that's all right for you . 
 Oh , good . If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock , that would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner . 
 Bye , mom ! 
 OK . Bye ! 
 Alright . See ya ! 
 Ok , see you after school ... 
 Mom ? 
 I ... I can ’ t breathe . 
 I cannot dance , you know . I have't such a talent . 
 Nothing . I have told you before that I won't go to the party and that's flat . 
 Who is your favorite music composer ? 
 Then you must despise such modern music as rock ? 
 It's a lovely day , isn't it ? 
 Is she American ? 
 So I take it you two are hitting it off ? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ? 
 Sounds like you've got some competition . You made a move already ? 
 That's nice . Having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage , eh ? 
 Good luck ! 
 Do you think you'll get the project ? 
 I see.After all , he's boss's son . 
 Are you feeling better today , Bill ? 
 You ’ d better give up smoking . It ’ s bad for your health . 
 But you should make up your mind first . 
 Why don ’ t you go to bed early and get up early ? You ’ ll have the same time for work . 
 Oh ! 
 To think of it ! All my old silver ! It meant so much to me . 
 What's so terrible too , is the fools we've made of ourselves . 
 I'll never get over it . Oh , Harry , it was all so unnecessary . That man ! ! How could he do this to us after we'd put him up ? 
 I just saw Something About Mary last night . It was hilarious . 
 What do you mean sick ? It was really funny , don't you think ? 
 Why not ? 
 It wasn't a dirty movie . There wasn't even any nudity . 
 Oh , you are too conservative . It's just realistic . 
 People think it's funny . 
 Yes . Especially in autumn , the red leaves of the maple trees make the whole mountain red . 
 Yes , it can make people feel as if they were in the land of fairies . 
 A couple of times . 
 Sure . I'd be very glad to be your tour guide . 
 I didn't hear that . But I can deduce the reason . 
 Tom is a kind guy , but addicted to gambling . He spends all his time gambling in the casino . And his wife can't put up with his incessant gambling any longer , so she divorced him . Is that right ? 
 Yeah ! Gambling is often a curse . By gambling we lose time and treasure , two things most precious to a man . 
 In a word , gambling is a vice . We should be away from it . 
 I am free tomorrow afternoon between two and four ; do you have a particular time in mind ? 
 Fine , do you know where my office is ? 
 Remember , it is in the E building on the third floor . 
 Don't worry , it will work out fine once you get there . I'll see you then . 
 Looking forward to meeting with you ! 
 No . Could you tell me something more about it ? I want to play well . 
 You just said 10 rounds . 
 Perhaps you can tell me a little more about this . 
 I'm told Cold Blood just finished its last cut . 
 Sure , it'll be on next Monday . 
 I tried it for a half-hour.It was interesting , but ... well ... I couldn't really do it . 
 I couldn't even stand on it and hold the sail . I probably fell down fifty times . 
 Yes , it was really stupid . 
 It was fifty dollars for a half-hour . 
 What do you mean ? It's expensive ! 
 How's your girlfriend ? 
 How are you tonight , sir ? 
 I know what you mean . What can I get for you ? 
 One screwdriver , coming right up . ( He mixes the drink . ) Here you are , sir . 
 I think you should look over these figures again . There are some calculations that are a bit off . 
 Apology is accepted . Try to do better next time . 
 You didn ’ t show up in the morning meeting . What ’ s up ? 
 But you still look a little bit tired . What time did you leave ? 
 That ’ s normal after a tense work evening . Working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either . Once , I worked overtime everyday for a whole week including the weekend . That really broke my rhythm and I got a little sick later . 
 But if the company asks , what else can we do ? 
 I got the information that there is a killer sale at the shopping mall near our block . Get up and I will wait for you at the gate of our flat . 
 Stop complaining , OK ? 
 No , I am not a shopaholic , but a super shopaholic . And I really enjoy smelling the gorgeous clothes and new bags . 
 What's wrong , Bob ? 
 Of course , I will . 
 How do I look in this new dress ? 
 How about this one ? 
 They must be your parents , what do they do ? 
 Do they often take you out ? 
 You did well on the math test . 
 Don ’ t you always fail in the math tests ? 
 Huh ? You mean you snuck a peek at his test ? 
 Are you crazy ? You were cheating . 
 Well , if I were you , I'd go on studying . 
 If I had chance again , I'd major in English . You're good at language . 
 You should take their advice . They know what's best for you.But my friends will have jobs and lots of fun , while I spend all my time doing reading and writing . 
 Hm , what you say makes sense . But you know , I still have to ask my parents for pocket money , and I hate to do so at this age . 
 You're right . Thank you for the advice . 
 John , they are old-fashioned people from the Chinese countryside . That ’ s their custom . 
 Don ’ t your relatives visit other relatives ? 
 I think that maybe Chinese families are closer than your families . 
 I want to buy two tickets for tonight's concert . 
 Ordinary one , please . 
 I think they are too far from the stage . I want two in row 6 . 
 Is this watch yours ? 
 Let me have a look . It's mine . I have been looking for it , but just cannot find it . It's present from my father . 
 Who are we going to play with today ? 
 Oh , the basketball team from No . 1 College ? I know they're a tough team . 
 Who's winning ? 
 Really ? I thought that they'd been killing us by now . 
 Are you a smoker ? 
 Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ? 
 When did you begin to smoke ? 
 Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking ? 
 How about the hiking ? It was freezing yesterday , are you all ok ? 
 You had been walking for 6 hours , isn ’ t that boring ? 
 Well . You know I hate walking , but I can ’ t wait to see your guys ’ video . 
 No , but those guys like to hit on me . 
 It's a ETV palace ! I'm glad I brought my platinum card . 
 Where is Stanley ? It was his idea to have the bachelor's party at a ETV , wasn't it ? 
 Then I bet he's really good ! 
 What a nice dress , Jean.You look marvelous ! 
 From the Crown's . Oh , what lovely earrings you have ! Are they diamond ? 
 Well , you are lucky to have such a considerate husband . Mine hasn't brought me a single rose since we married . 
 She's chic , isn't she ? 
 It makes me feel rather shabby . That woman has a good taste in dressing , I would say . 
 Most women follow fashion like sheep.They don't know any better than imitate . 
 The gown is quite expensive , believe me . 
 You know those upstarts . They're all show-offs ! I think I'd better have a diet ; otherwise I'd look like a ballon soon . 
 Thanks . I'm flattered . 
 Whoa , whoa , what ’ s going on ? Watch out ! 
 Oh , no ! I ’ m so sorry ! Are you all right ? 
 I feel terrible , I really didn ’ t mean to knock you over . My tire , just exploded , and I lost control of my bike . Really , it was an accident . Please accept my apologies . 
 Yeah , I think we have met somewhere before . That ’ s right ! We met at Aaron ’ s place last weekend ! What a coincidence ! But anyway , I ’ m glad to see that you ’ re not too badly hurt , and I should probably get going . I have a nine o ’ clock meeting . 
 Nope , I ’ m canceling my appointment so that I can stay here with you . 
 Hi Kate ... thanks ... wow ! Look at all the furniture . You must spent a fortune on it ! I love your new three-pieces suite . 
 Good for you ! You ’ Ve got new curtains too . That ’ s a very nice shade of blue . This sofa is very comfortable . I could sit on it all day ! 
 To be honest , it looks like your old carpet . Is it really new or did you just have your old cleaned ? 
 Oh , you are out of breath ! What ’ s happened ? 
 That it easy.They get caught before they come here . 
 People of different races are fit for quite different sports . For instance , Asians are especially good fattable tennis , badminton , diving and shooting . They seem to have been born with certain natural endowments in technical sports , in which flexibility , agility and quick reflexes are favorable . 
 Yes , in all these four sports . the Chinese Olympic dream teams led the way . They swept the floor against their opponents in table tennis and diving . 
 I think they are in a better position in those sports that demand a high degree of intensity , speed and explosive force like swimming , field games , etc . 
 It's common sense that African athletes always make a clean sweep in track events , middle or long distance races , relays , hurdles , barriers , and marathon . 
 This man looks very handsome.Is he married ? 
 Oh , I can't believe it.He looks very young . 
 I see . 
 Possibly . 
 Not a bit . 
 No kidding . Time is running out . 
 Vince says he can't afford anybody else . We're got to come through . 
 I guess we'll either make it , or we won't . 
 Do you have any English songs ? 
 Let me have a look . Everything I do I do it for you 、 Unchained melody 、 My heart will go on . Oh , and I ’ d like to try Everything I do I do it for you . 
 Is it easy to locate it ? 
 I used to be a better singer . I haven't sung in the Karaoke for a long time . It's your turn . 
 That's really my pleasure to listen to a Chinese song . 
 It ’ s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . I play the part of the detective . He has to catch the killer , but there ’ s very little evidence . It ’ s a psychological thriller with some frightening scenes , but I hope audience won ’ t be too scared to go to the movie theatres ! 
 I have had disagreement with every director . I ’ Ve worked with . We ’ Ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . It was the same when I made this movie . I don ’ t know where rumours of my disagreement with Rachel Kelly come from . We got on very well and I hope to work with her again . I enjoyed making the movie very much . 
 Not at all . The feedback from audience has been great . I care about what they think more than what the critics think . 
 I wanted to , but my insurance company wouldn ’ t let me . All of my stunts were done by a stuntman . As you know , I used to do my own stunts , but I ’ ll leave that to the experts in future . 
 My pleasure . Have you seen the movie yet ? 
 It looks like our company trip will have to be canceled because of the typhoon . 
 I'd like to meet you again sometime . 
 Anytime . You can reach me at 5558929 . 
 Fine . 
 Bye , Jason . 
 No . Of course not . But what for ? 
 I see . But I'm busy now . How about tomorrow ? 
 I have , actually ; I ’ Ve always wanted to build my dream home myself . 
 well , it would be spacious and located next to a park , because a nice view is important to me . 
 I ’ d want it to have three bedrooms on a second floor with balconies on each , and one main bedroom on the main floor with an attached en suite . I ’ d also want a large living room and kitchen connected t 
 I ’ d have one guest bathroom in the basement , one attached to the main bedroom , and one upstairs , so a total of three . 
 I don ’ t like a lot of clutter , so I wouldn ’ t have lots of things out . I would have a few vases on the mantel piece and some pictures of my family on the walls , but other than that , most things would b 
 I think TV is a great waste of time , so I would only have one small TV in the kitchen to watch the news in the morning . 
 Of course I have . I'd like to marry a handsome man and have two children if possible . 
 I don't believe you can make it when you meet your Mrs . Right . 
 That's a wonderful choice . 
 January is a little too close to the Christmas holidays . 
 I think that April would work . Spring is a lovely time to be in the mountains . 
 Maybe if we asked around we could see what people would prefer . 
 I'll take care of taking the survey and get back to you with the answers . 
 Really ? How do you know that ? 
 Why ? That ’ s good news , but no one knows it ? 
 I'd love that . I'm so glad I quit . It's time for a change . 
 Yes . I'm looking for a position as a chef . 
 I'm sure you have great connections . 
 Really ? You have that much faith in me ? And Giovanni agreed to it ? Does he know who I am ? 
 He's prejudiced , isn't he ? 
 Ah ! I know a way to convince him that Americans can make good Italian food ! 
 You'll see next week . I'll come by one day at lunchtime . 
 I'm sorry to hear that . 
 I listen to music and read . 
 I think I like classical music better . 
 Hi , how is it going ? 
 That ’ s right . I ’ Ve never really liked it since I got here . 
 What a surprise meeting you here , Landy . 
 It ’ s a small world , isn ’ t it ? 
 Can we sit on the grass , darling ? 
 Look , darling ! I can see a bench near that tree . 
 It's not raining , darling . The bench isn't wet . 
 Yes , I can . 
 It says ' Wet paint ! ' 
 I don ’ t know till now . 
 Why they hold a flour war ? 
 They are not feeling satisfied ? 
 But how guilty to waste food ! 
 Coffee , please . 
 Coke is fine.Thank you . 
 What is it ? 
 A trip to China for summer vacation . Wow ! What a wonderful surprise ! Thank you . This is the best surprise I've ever had . 
 Oh , it has nothing to do with me . 
 I came here only a month ago . 
 It feels like there's going to be rain later . 
 We'll go tomorrow . 
 It's very nice . I like it very much . 
 My pleasure . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer , and I suppose you dance often . 
 Oh , really ? But you're doing the waltz wonderfully well . 
 Thank you for your compliments . It's just you are a good leader . Do you like the foxtrot and tango ? 
 Disco is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances because it can release one's hidden feelings , and is a healthy exercise . But I don't do the rock and roll nor break-dancing . 
 My pleasure . 
 I used to date him . Of course it was him . 
 Yes , on the cancer ward . And Taylor was there . He walked right by me and didn't even see me . 
 But you saw how skinny and pale he looks . He has " cancer patient " written all over his face . 
 I hope I get an easy question like you did . 
 Oh , great . That's just my luck ! I hate those arty movies . 
 Oh , please ! I have no idea . 
 I'm leaving now , mum . 
 I will.Bye - bye ! 
 You hoo , anybody here ? 
 Hi , Rock Sam ! Hey , I am surprised to see you doing so well . 
 No way . Alisan Darling just got hitched in Vagas . 
 Darling found out he was having a fling , and one new girl found out about Darling she dumped him too . 
 Ya . And now I can break this to you . Fanny is moving . 
 Well I have to go , Rock Sam . You take it easy , OK . 
 When do we get off the bus ? 
 I feel like we've been on this bus forever . 
 Are you sure we weren't supposed to get off already ? 
 I thought you knew where we get off at . 
 Seriously ? 
 That's the last time I get on a bus with you . 
 I'm afraid it's a bad news for you . There are some problems in your supervised goods . 
 I overheard this information when I passed Arden's office . We got some complaints from consumers yesterday . I am terribly sorry for that . 
 Calm down ! It is useless to act like that . Can we find some solutions ? 
 But we still have to find one . Can we find Arden to check whether this is true or not ? 
 Face the reality . Maybe we can find the way to make up the loss . 
 Sure you can . But I'm only gonna keep it for a month . 
 That's why I can profit from it ! 
 You bet . eBay Taiwan doesn't have it ! And bidding will start at two thousand NT . This baby's worth about six thousand to real tennis fans ... 
 Hello , ABC Company . Can I help you ? 
 Can you name some courses you completed ? 
 Am I allowed to check out at 14:00 ? 
 Will there be any late charge ? 
 Thank you . 
 That's better . 
 I think so . 
 Yes ? 
 Why not ? 
 I'm sorry . I can't . What does the note say . 
 Sorry , I'm very near sighted . 
 Yes , sir . Shall I explain the details of the plan now ? 
 According to your schedule , you will visit the Times Company , including its office building , workshops and stores , in the morning from 8: 30 to 11 
 I would suggest roast beef , sir . 
 We have clear and cream soup at your choice.Which one do you prefer ? 
 Good . There is the information desk . How do we get to seventieth street , please ? 
 How much is it ? 
 Which way do we go for the northern line ? 
 I appreciate it , thank you . 
 How do I set up an email account ? 
 Which link ? 
 Oh , no . What did I do ? It ’ s asking me for a password . 
 Yes . 
 Oh , I see . 
 Excuse me . But are you Mrs . Smith from America ? 
 Yes . Nice to meet you , Mrs Smith . 
 Do you have any particular conditions that you would like our firm to take into consideration ? 
 No problem . We can offer you a flat with two bedrooms and a living room . 
 You ’ ll get bonuses at the end of each year according to your achievements . Besides , we offer you 1 % commission on all your sales .

 If you are satisfied with the conditions here , please sign this contract and give it to me . 
 And how will you be paying for your room , Ms White ? 
 Both rooms on the same card ? 
 Your card number please ? 
 Double one , zero two ?

 You're welcome . We'll see you on the 25th , Ms White . 
 Goodbye . 
 I ordered dinner about forty minutes ago . It hasn ’ t been delivery yet . 
 Okay . 
 That ’ s okay . 
 No , thank you . I'm just looking . Maybe later I might need your help . 
 Oh , you do ? You certainly have a large selection . 
 Yes , we can also see some yew trees . 
 Listen to the sound of nature ! It's like music . 
 What are those . Miss Liu ? 
 The red and yellow peony flowers are so beautiful . 
 Sure . I'm going to take more pictures today . 
 You are so kind . Thanks . 
 No . This time I'll try Chinese wine . 
 Do people here drink a lot of liquors ? 
 Yes , it has . Some Mexicans are crazy . They drink a lot of liquors even on hot days . Have you ever heard of " Tequila Sauta " ? 
 Right . It's very strong , just like alcohol . ( Frank sips Mao Tai . ) 
 They say that Showing wine tastes quite good . What's it ? 
 I see . 
 Thank you for telling me so much , I'll try them next time . 
 I would like to make a reservation for tomorrow . 
 Well , how about 4th ? 
 Yes . Please help me reserve it . 
 Well , I am not sure . Lets me check my agenda 
 I am free on Tuesday afternoon from 2 PM to 4 PM , is it convenient for you ? 
 Yes , there is . See you then . 
 OK , Mr . Coffee Connoisseur , so what's the next step in the coffee-making process ? 
 Let me guess , Mocha , Mandheling , and Santos ! 
 No , I just read the names off the packages ... Ha ! 
 I made a doctor's appointment for you . 
 Then I guess you're healthy enough to clean your room before school . 
 Bundle up . It's wet and rainy out there . Here's some soup . 
 Soup does the body good , sweetie . It's what you need when you're under the weather . 
 What kind of style do you want ? 
 Now let me take your measurements . 
 Three days later . 
 Bye-bye . 
 Do I have to get up now ? 
 What are you talking about ? The alarm hasn't even gone off yet . 
 I must have slept right through it . 
 Just let me sleep five more minutes . 
 That's $ 20 in all . 
 Let me see . I am terribly sorry , sir . That should be $ 18 . 
 Mm ... How do I get this ticket machine to work ? 
 Ok , I ’ Ve done that . 
 Oh it ’ s printed the ticket already . Thank you very much . 
 So how long do you plan to live here ? 
 Fine by me . Do you know how to read this kind of contract ? 
 Great . When in Rome , you guys know what to do . 
 That about does it . See you in a week . 
 How about this product selling from last month on ? 
 Am . Well , can I have a try of the sample free of charge ? 
 Thank you . We'll order once we try the sample . 
 OK . 
 No , it isn't mine . I blundered upon it under the sofa . Do youknow whose watch it is ? 
 Well , here you are . Remember to put it in a proper place . 
 Steak , please . 
 Well-done , please . 
 No , thank you . I don't like soup . I'd rather have some fruit juice to start with . 
 Meat , I think . 
 I do , but I want meat . 
 Yes , but I prefer red wine with meat . 
 I just want to have a coffee , I think . 
 No , thanks . I'd like to go straight home . I'm very tired . 
 Yes , we've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery.And they are all newly renovated . 
 No problem . We have a nice apartment located near the Oriental Square . It's perfect for people busy with office work . It is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details . 
 Ah ! I get your point . We have just what you need . Our Jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . The one bedroom apartments are very economical , but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . I think you can find a very apartment there . 
 Of course . It's just at 19 Lingual Road . You can phone me again if you can't find the right place . 
 Mom , I want to get a motorcycle . Is that all right with you ? 
 Mom ! I'll wear a helmet and I'll drive sane . I promise . 
 What's that ? 
 And after that ? 
 Hello , John . How are you ? 
 Very well , thanks . Nice to see you again . I haven't seen you for a long time . What have you been doing lately ? 
 Fine , thanks . I've been busy lately . 
 I've been studying for my exams . My school exams will begin next month . 
 Thanks . And how are your parents ? 
 Where are you going now ? 
 I can't . I have to meet someone . 
 Good-bye . See you again sometime . 
 May I have your room number 。 Sir ? 
 Just a minute , Sir.Are you Mr Wang from China ? 
 Mr Wang , did you sign any bill in the last two hours in our hotel ? 
 Have you used any hotel services this morning ? 
 Here is your bill.It totals 3250 dollars . 
 What kind of card ? 
 Yes , we do . Here is your bill and receipt . 
 I am going to the gym . Do you want to come with me ? 
 Then , I'll wait for you at the car park in 20 minutes . 
 Do you have your member card with you ? 
 Well I have a guest ticket . You can use it . 
 Can you tell me the best way to see the city ? 
 Travel by the buses ? That sounds interesting . 
 Oh , there comes the bus . 
 sure . Where do you want to go ? Are you in the mood for anything in particular ? 
 dumplings again ? ! Oh , Amy , let's try something new ! 
 how about the Mongolian hot pot ? 
 maybe we can try Yuanyang pot this time . You can choose the non-spicy soup base . 
 yes . The sliced noodles they offer are among the most authentic Shanti cuisines . 
 wait a minute . Let me throw on a sweater . 
 Frans Smith ? I think you may have the wrong number . 
 It is . But there is no Frans Smith here . Do you know which department he works in ? 
 The accounts department , no problem . I'm just putting you through now . 
 I want to be in a higher managerial position in the field of international marketing . I ’ m very interested in the European market hopefully , in Brussels . 
 It ’ s truly exciting to work in newly emerging unified market . Brussels will be center of the new market in the continent . 
 My experience in my last job showed that I have the talent to motivate people . It could be seen from the low absentee rate in my team . I want to continue that kind of contribution and to further develop this potential . 
 I want to apply my knowledge and experience to a challenging position and finally move on to management level . 
 I think the most important thing is the nature of the job . One should never do anything one is not interested in . To me , pleasant working conditions with co-operative staff are also important . 
 Can't it wait ? She's still angry that we sent e-mail wedding invitations . 
 I know . And they're spending enough on the plane tickets to Texas ! 
 OK . 
 $ 200 , please . 
 I'm afraid you can't , ma'am . We accept only traveler's checks and credit cards . 
 We can take it . Just a moment ... Please sign here . 
 When did it happen ? 
 Tell me where it happened and how . 
 That happens often these days . Well , please fill in this Report of Theft . 
 I know in your resume that you have worked in your present company for 3 years , can you tell me why you want to leave your present job and join us ? 
 Why do you think you are qualified for this position ? 
 So , tell me about you new house . How is it different to your old one ? 
 So , it ’ s a three-bedrooms detached house ? 
 What ’ s the kitchen like ? I know both you and your wife like to cook . 
 Are the rooms nice and bright ? 
 Do you have a balcony ? 
 You ’ re right on the edge of the city , aren ’ t you ? There can ’ t be much noise or traffic there . Is it easy to get into city centre ? 
 Come on , darling . We haven't got much time . 
 Half past six ... and it's half past six already . 
 We haven't . Hurry up ! 
 And about time too ! 
 Please show me your ID card and tell me the receiver's address . 
 Ok , that's all . 
 For What ? 
 Well , that sounds like it would be OK . Just be careful . 
 We eat a lot of chicken , pork and beef . You eat those meat a lot in your country too , don ’ t you ? 
 yes . I ’ Ve heard that people in your country like to eat lamb chops . 
 Yes , I have . I tried them when I visited your country last year . I thought they were very tasty . Can you cook them ? 
 That sounds great . I'll bring a bottle of wine . 
 My bad . I didn't realize that it was so late . 
 Of course not . I really did lose track of time . 
 Yeah , you did . I just forgot to call . 
 That's true . My bad for not calling . 
 You're going to kick me out over this ? 
 Well , if I'm not living here anymore , then I won't have to listen to your rules . 
 Hey , that was quite the presentation ! Honestly , I was completely blown away by your strategy outline . I've gotta say , Alex , you really wowed me today . 
 No , I think you deserve some recognition here ; I mean , if I look back on your previous presentations , this is a huge improvement . 
 And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies . I really appreciate you taking the time to think though my suggestions . 
 Well , I just wanted to say well done . Really you did a great job . 
 I realize that I ’ m not in a position to offer you the kind of promotion you deserve I'll gladly do what I can to help . 
 And , as well as being a pleasure to work with , you ’ Ve been instrumental in helping us complete many key projects . 
 My feelings are mixed on the issue too . By helping you I ’ m losing a valuable and trusted employee . However I think you are taking a step in the right direction . 
 Have I really got to do those exams again , Dad ? 
 And must I go back to school ? 
 But Dad , I should be working full-time at my age . I ’ m nearly 17 . 
 What else I ’ Ve got to do ? Join the army ? 
 How do you use an ATM card , billy ? 
 Oh yes . I've got it written down here . Just a minute . 
 Ok , I've entered my PIN . There are several options on the screen . I guess I just choose which service I want , don't I ? 
 I can just enter the amount using the keys , right ? 
 These machines aren't very difficult to use . In fact , I quite like them . They are much faster than dealing with a band clerk . 
 Well , Jim . It is a combination of how much you eat , the type of food you eat , and when you eat your meals . 
 That's a big mistake , you should always have a good breakfast . You will not run your car without fuel , and yet you expect your body to work without food . 
 I bet you eat a large evening meal , then sit and watch TV or read a book . Then instead of burning off your energy , your body stores it as fat . 
 Way to control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits . 
 Hello , this is Francis . 
 Today , I am busy all day long . 
 That ’ s not good for me at all . It ’ ll have to be another time . 
 I know . I am available from 1 PM to 4 PM on Friday afternoon . 
 See you . 
 Could you ? Thank you . 
 I ’ m actually here on business . 
 I ’ m an IT salesman . 
 It ’ s very interesting actually . 
 Thank you very much . Bye . 
 I need some medicine . 
 My younger brother . He suffers from a bad cold . 
 Fever and a bad cough . 
 What kind of medicine does he need ? 
 How many pills for each time ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Is this the class to prepare for interviews ? 
 I have an interview tomorrow , so I hope I can learn everything quickly . 
 I think that we should make sure that our looks are the best they can be . 
 Yes , and being friendly and having a good attitude also help me relax . 
 No , I didn ’ t . What else should I keep in mind ? 
 Has Mien sold his house yet ? 
 Has he moved to his new house yet ? 
 When ? Tomorrow morning ? 
 He's a very nice person . We will all miss him . 
 I think that they will move in the day after tomorrow . 
 Yes , I will . 
 No , he didn't want to leave , but his wife did ! 
 Am I allowed to eat spicy food ? 
 Really , because spicy food is my favorite . 
 Sure , I would like a Coke . 
 Let's see , can I get some fried zucchini , please ? 
 No , that's it , thank you . 
 I would like to order my food now . 
 Can I get a cheeseburger and some fries ? 
 That's all , thank you . 
 I can help you with that . Do you still have your receipt ? 
 Oh , yes , that will help me a lot . 
 I'm sorry . I think we're out of this skirt in this color . Do you want me to call another one of our store to see if it's available there ? 
 Well , your refund total is 50 dollars . 
 It really is . 
 Hopefully it will . 
 I like how clear the sky gets after it rains . 
 I especially love the night air when it rains . 
 The stars look so much closer after it rains . 
 Yeah , so do I . 
 Yes , sir ! What can I do for you ? 
 Will you have it strong or weak ? 
 The car isn't running smoothly . I'd like to have a look at it . 
 I'm not sure . It could be the tires . Let's stop here . 
 Nothing serious . The right one needs some air . 
 Well . Let ’ s go swimming . 
 Then why don ’ t we go for a walk in the hills . It ’ d be very good for us you know . 
 Yes , I am . 
 Thank you for meeting me at the airport , Steven . 
 Thanks . Where is our car ? 
 OK . Let's go . 
 Hi . Last month , our company , Turner Interiors of Beijing , ordered some documents under our new L / C . What I want to do is check and see if the documents have arrived yet . 
 Oh , dear . When do you think they will arrive ? 
 Excuse me , where is the Beijing Railway Station ? 
 How long will it take to get there ? 
 May I take a bus or a taxi to get there ? 
 Excuse me , sir . Where is the No . 1 bus stop ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 I'd be glad to have your help . Could you make the air-conditioner cooler ? 
 Good idea . 
 Thank you . Could I have something cold to drink ? 
 Orange juice , please . 
 Yes . 
 One or two cubes will be OK . 
 I'm awfully sorry to have bothered you . 
 Please accept this tip . 
 I always do . Did you go to school today ? 
 You should have , but have you seen any movies lately ? 
 Maybe it was , but answer the question . 
 I want to go to see a movie this weekend . 
 I don't want to go alone . 
 No , I want to go to the movies instead . 
 Yes . 
 My name is James . 
 American . 
 I don't know him . 
 Because he beat me first when I tried to stop him from grabbing my bag and running away . 
 I stabbed his belly three times . 
 I knew , but I couldn't myself . 
 No . I didn't kill him on purpose , madam . It's him who caused the incident . I need to see my attorney . 
 Well , Peter . I'm sorry you're ill . What's the matter with you ? 
 Show me your torgue.What did you eat yesterday ? 
 Did you eat any cake ? 
 Did you eat any ice cream ? 
 Did you eat any candy ? 
 Young man , tell me everything you ate yesterday evening . 
 I see ! How many pieces of cake did you eat ? 
 How many plates of ice ream did you eat , young man ? 
 Excuse me . Can I ask you a question ? 
 I don't know how to say it in English . 
 Oh , Thank you . But how do you spell it ? 
 Excuse me . 
 How do I get to the Olympic Stadium , please ? 
 Thanks . 
 Have you ever thought about your ideal home ? 
 What would it be like ? 
 How many rooms would it have ? 
 How many bathrooms would your dream home have ? 
 How would you decorate your house ? 
 How many TVs would your dream home have ? 
 We have a variety of trousers . Which one do you like best ? 
 What about this one ? 
 Where is the bus ? 
 It should've been here 30 minutes ago . 
 It better , because I'm already late for work . 
 Me too , it's so unreliable . 
 It's also horrible having to be at a bus stop in any kind of weather . 
 I think it's time we started driving . 
 I don ’ t know what activity my son should take part in ? 
 But each children has his own interest . 
 Hello , this is Lin Tao . I am calling to inquire about my interview result last week . 
 Sorry to hear that , but could you inform me why I failed ? 
 What is your major ? 
 Which university are you attending ? 
 Have you received any degrees ? 
 What course did you like best ? 
 Do you feel that you have received a good general training ? 
 English and computer skills are comparatively important to this post , especially in the starting period . Wharfs your ability in these two fields ? 
 Excuse me , what's the price of a single room ? 
 Are meals included ? 
 Fine , I want to book one for overnight . 
 We should have it put together by the end of next week . 
 Well , as the saying goes – we aim to please ! 
 Here you are.Which size do you wear ? 
 Of course.You look terrific in it ! 
 Hello ? 
 Speaking . 
 Hi , Alice.How are you ? 
 I ’ m sorry to hear that.You ’ d better stay at home.After all , we can visit Mrs.Brown later 
 Bye . 
 Yes , What can I do for you ? 
 Welcome to our corporation . I'm in charge of the export business . 
 I'm In Hui . Do sit down , won't you ? 
 We'd be very glad to do so . Have you seen the exhibits displayed in the hall ? 
 Yes , of course . If you make an inquiry , we can make you a firm offer . 
 Please show me that hat , please . 
 No , the one next to it . 
 Is this a furry hat ? 
 Are you sure ? 
 Anna , Would you like to dance ? 
 Don ’ t worry about it . I ’ ll show you how . It ’ s a piece of cake . 
 Mary ! I haven ’ t seen you since our dinner with Mr . Lee last week . Where have you been hiding yourself lately ? 
 Really , nothing big . I just heard about your ideas on employee motivation and I wanted chat with you about a few things going on in my department . 
 Actually , I was hoping to mix business with pleasure . Would you be interested in joining me for dinner some time this week ? I thought we might try out the new Italian restaurant everyone ’ s been 
 Is this evening too soon ? 
 Hi , Lucy , you are very popular with people around you , what are your tricks ? 
 Sharing knowledge can be very settled and some second stances . People may think you are telling them how to do their work . If they take it personally , they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work . 
 You are quite right . Thank you for sharing your experience with me . I learned a lot . 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Sure . How long is your vacation ? 
 Well , how do you like this one ? You will stay there for 17 days . 
 It's summer in Sydney so you have to bring your summer wear . 
 I know what you mean , Carol . I ’ Ve had nothing but trouble with it . They say it ’ s supposed to be easy ! 
 Sure . Why don ’ t you sit down for a minute ? You haven ’ t taken a rest all morning . 
 Of course you can . I am sure this one works very well . I just sent dozens of pages . How many pages are you sending ? Are you familiar with my fax machine ? 
 Yes , it will print immediately . 
 You are in luck . We just receive a shipment of several different styles of white purses . 
 Yes , I believe they are . Here are something that might interest you . 
 Sure . Let me ring this up for you at the register . If you would like , this can be gift-wrapped for free . Just take it to the customer service department . 
 I don ’ t see any problem ; only the car is a bit old . 
 Get in . 
 What magazine do you want to subscribe for ? 
 OK , Fitness Consultant . How many subscriptions do you want ? 
 How long do you want the subscription for ? 
 Your name , please ? 
 I see . Please put your address here then . 
 650 Yuan . 
 Oh . It looks like Jack is going to make his annual speech . 
 Yeah . I'm still hungry , but I guess it's kind of rude to keep eating while he's talking , huh ? 
 No . He's so far away I can hardly see him ! Let's keep eating ! 
 All that's left is a leg . I gave the head to Tim ! 
 A Notice of Unemployment Insurance Award letter will be sent to you . 
 The Award Letter will inform you as to how much you will receive . 
 Every two weeks you will receive a Continued Claim Form that you must turn in . 
 You must show that you were available and that you looked for work . 
 One of the questions they ask you is if you were well enough to work . 
 What are you basing this information on ? 
 Yes , I will.We are very happy with your performance and want to continue our woodworking relationship . 
 Let me take this up with the Director and get back to you immediately . 
 Yes . There is something wrong with my watch . It stopped several hours ago . 
 How much is a battery ? 
 How long will it last ? 
 Here is the money . 
 What ’ s the rush ? You ’ re not leaving for another week . 
 Okay . I ’ ll bring them in tomorrow for sure . 
 Thank you . 
 Thank you very much . Mr . George . As a newcomer , I understand that you have your consideration and I am satisfied with the raise . 
 Thank you again . I'll keep doing my best . 
 Sure , Carolyn . I'm happy to help you.What kinds of things do you need right now ? 
 Well , as for Albert , he should go to an office supply store.There ' s a very good one called Office Depot . They have everything he will need.And their prices are good too . It's very convey 
 Sure , it's spelled Office and then D - E - P - O - T.It ' s in the Yellow Pages . 
 And as for the kitchen things , do you want very high quality ? 
 I mean , do you want the best quality , or do you want good prices ? 
 Then I suggest you go to K-Mart or Wal-Mart . 
 They are very large , discount department stores.That means their prices are very good.And you can find everything you need for the kitchen or bathroom . 
 Yes , everything.They don't have the most expensive brands , but their quality is usually decent.The main thing is , they have good prices , and they are very convenient . 
 I have never shopped there , but I think Price Club is a kind of membership store . 
 That means you have to pay a membership fee to shop there . I have heard they have very good prices on electronics . 
 Yes . Like stereos and televisions . 
 I'm not sure.But if you are only going to stay a year , I don't think Price Club is good to join.They have great deals occasionally.They are very good for people who like to buy new things all 
 I know how it is . Moving is very troublesome . 
 you know I hate shopping more than anything else in this world . 
 what kind of errands do we need to run ? 
 I ’ ll only go if we can stop at the office-license to pick up something to drink for tonight . 
 sounds good . You have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though . I know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms , especially if the stores have special offers . 
 ok , let ’ s go then ! 
 for what ? 
 you said you were only going to window shop ! 
 I should have known ... 
 Yes . 
 About one day . It arrives in Dalian at 10:00 a . m . tomorrow . 
 Four ports . 
 Perhaps she makes about 25 knots an hour . 
 Yes . I hope it will remain fine all the way . 
 Then I guess you get to have a pet . Do you know what you want ? 
 You know who will be responsible for feeding and cleaning and all of that stuff ? 
 Have you figured out the costs involved with feeding and caring for it ? 
 Sounds like you've done your homework . I think you're ready for this . 
 Yes , but it takes a while to find things . It's not organized as carefully as a regular store . 
 Usually a clothes company will send their overstock to an outlet . The prices are very low . But you may find faulty products here too . 
 Yes . Sometimes the fault is very small ; if you have a needle and thread , you can fix it yourself . So it's a good deal to buy it . 
 Yes . You can save a lot of money in this way . 
 Why not buy the sweater ? It only costs 30 Yuan . 
 How many do you want to buy ? 
 You're right . 
 I think I ’ m very good at planning . I manage my time perfectly , so that I can always get things done on time . 
 Because I ’ m very competent in this area . 
 Yes , I work well under pressure and find it dimly . However , I believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines . 
 I don ’ t try to go ahead of people and lead them , I ’ d rather cooperate with everybody else and get the job done by working together . 
 Please keep calm . I know the pain isn ’ t what flesh and blood can stand . But be brave . 
 Have you obtained any certificate of technical qualifications or license ? 
 How many years have you had the drivers license ? 
 That ’ s good . What special skills do you have , can you tell me ? 
 What computer languages have you learned ? 
 Have you gotten any special training in programming ? 
 Hi , how are you doing ? 
 I'm pretty good . Thanks for asking . 
 I've been great . What about you ? 
 What school do you go to ? 
 Do you like it there ? 
 Good luck with school . 
 How many languages can you speak ? 
 You mean you can read and write both of them ? 
 Can you read and write English well ? 
 Do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of English-speaking countries ? 
 Do you think your English is good enough to do desk work ? 
 So , Lauren , I just wanted to talk to you quickly about our new customer support representative , Jason Huntley . 
 Basically , I ’ Ve got a few concerns about him , and the bottom line is , I don ’ t think he ’ s a good fit for our company . 
 Yeah , his attitude is great , but he ’ s really unreliable . Sometimes he ’ s really productive , but then other times ... take last Tuesday for instance , he was forty-five minutes late for our morning meeting ! 
 But that ’ s not the only thing ... you know , he really doesn ’ t have the best work ethic , I ’ m constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients .

 Tyler residence . 
 No , this is her sister , Nancy . 
 Oh . Can I take a message ? 
 Okay . I'll give her the message . 
 Bye . 
 Yes , where's it to , madam ? 
 You want to send it airmail , madam ? 
 Excuse me . I've been waiting here for 15 mins . Do you know how often does No . 3 run ? 
 It seems that you have got here at a good time . Do you have a bus schedule ? 
 I see , thank you . 
 There is a shop on the ground floor . It sells both Chinese and foreign cigarettes . 
 Yes , sir . There is a counter selling all kinds of souvenirs 
 There is one at the end of the corridor . 
 You are welcome . 
 You are welcome . Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to interview me . 
 Yes , please . My telephone number is 2974-5328 , and you can call me at any time in the daytime . 
 Great . I will look forward to hearing from you . And do I need the second interview ? 
 Goodbye . 
 Not a bad idea ! 
 Well , let me see . I'd like to go to the Great Wall , the Summer Palace , the Forbidden City and the Temple of Heaven . 
 You ’ re home late today , David . How was school ? 
 Oh , what ’ s she like ? 
 Is she old or young ? 
 Is she strict ? 
 Can she speak Chinese ? 
 David , stop dreaming . It ’ s time to do your homework . 
 Can you tell me the exact place ? 
 Yes . But this one is full , you have to wait for the next one . 
 Good afternoon , madam . May I help you ? 
 I am sorry , madam . I didn't hear you . It's too noisy here . Could you please say it again ? 
 Would you please wait a minute ? I will get one for you at once . 
 Here you are . 
 Yes , certainly , madam . 
 Yes , it is . This perfume just arrived yesterday , and it's the latest products of Chanel . 
 55 dollars , madam . 
 Thank you . Do you need something else ? 
 Excuse me . Could you tell me how to get to the post office ? 
 Will you look at this form ? 
 I don't understand some things . 
 What does MI mean ? 
 What does MM / DD / YY mean ? 
 I don't understand . 
 Oh . That's simple enough . 
 How much is the video camera ? 
 It is cute . I will take it . Please make out the receipt . 
 Is breakfast served here ? 
 Do I have to pay extra money for it ? 
 Thank you . 
 I'd rather have a cup of coffee . 
 Yes , please . Milk and two sugar . 
 You don ’ t have to eat them . I don ’ t mind . 
 No dessert for you unless you eat all of your vegetables . 
 You can have some fruits for dessert.If you eat an apple and a banana , I might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake . 
 I'll remember that for next time.You ’ ll get extra peas and carrots , but no broccoli or cauliflower , ok ? 
 We're sorry , but we cannot allow your claim . 
 The material was not damaged by us . 
 Hello , can I help you ? 
 When to leave ? 
 Ok . Can I have your name , please ? 
 And your telephone number ? 
 OK . Right then . 
 Why do you stop me ? 
 I'm sorry . 
 I don't know . 
 Good evening , ma'am . May I help you ? 
 Will the object fit into this size of box ? 
 Could you fill out this form , please , ma'am ? 
 Thank you , ma'am . Would you like to use it until May 20th ? 
 This way , please . Your box number is 522 . 
 If you would like to use the contents during the period of use , please come here in person . After confirming your signature , we will open the box . 
 Where are you going ? 
 Going to work where ? 
 I didn ’ t know you were working there this year . 
 How did you get that job ? 
 That ’ s really cool . 
 Do they pay you a lot ? 
 I'd like to check in , PLS . 
 But I ’ Ve reserved a room the day before yesterday . 
 Tony Bush . 
 Of course , I did it myself . 
 Don't worry about that . 
 Yes , that's right . I'd like to pay my bill by credit card . 
 Here you are . 
 All right . 
 How do you do ? I need your help in selecting a foreign market to invest ! 
 How can I find out what countries to invest ? 
 Great . I want to get an idea for the purchasing ability in various countries . 
 Let's see if we can reach some sort of agreement over your curfew . 
 Well . I'm not everyone else's father . I think you need to be in the house by ten o'clock . 
 I know some junior high kids who can stay out later than that . 
 Okay , how about a midnight curfew ? And I'll let you know where I am . 
 I can't . I've got to attend a meeting in London . 
 I will . 
 Yes , sir . I think you'll find our gym quite satisfactory . 
 It's only one flight down , sir . Just take the elevator or the stairs . 
 Sir , you can use the gym for free . All you need is your room key . 
 Sir , our gym is open around the clock , every day of the week . 
 I'm sorry , sir , but we have no trainer . 
 Ok , here is $ 50 . Oh , can you make out an invoice for me ? 
 No , I am a teacher . I teach art . 
 It is . You must be new here . I do my shopping here regularly , once a week . 
 Thank you . Nice to meet you , too . 
 I'm afraid you're going in the opposite direction . Go back the way you came , and take the second turn on the left . The museum is straight ahead , right in front of you . 
 Well , it's about fifteen minutes ' walk . 
 You may take a No . 34 bus . And the subway can also take you there . 
 My pleasure . 
 I like Chinese food . 
 We have a lot of Chinese restaurants in America . 
 Well done . 
 Excellent job . 
 I'm very impressed . 
 Congratulations . You should be very proud of yourself . 
 Yes , it will . 
 Yeah , I take this bus all the time . 
 It's about thirty minutes long . 
 There's a bus stop right behind Macy's . 
 There's a bus stop in the mall parking lot . 
 Absolutely . 
 Terrible . 
 Someone robbed my apartment last week . The robber took $ 550 . 
 No . 
 My English isn't very good . I didn't know what to say to them . 
 This is our main service area . We do all the routine services here and have two full-time mechanics . 
 They're serviced regularly . We give them a basic service every 10,000 km or so and a main service once a year , or every 100,000 km . 
 Well , the same as for private vehicles really , but we do it more often because they get a lot of wear and tear . 
 Yes , we've got all the necessary equipment . We can give the engines a major overhaul . If there's a serious problem , we strip down the engine and find the faulty component . Would you like to look around ? 
 We still have more to go , I think . 
 You're right . 
 I don't think so . 
 Maybe we did miss our stop . 
 I'm positive that we missed our stop . 
 My mistake . 
 Have I really got to do those exams again , Dad ? 
 And must I go back to school ? 
 But Dad , I should be working full-time at my age . I'm nearly 17 . 
 What else I've got to do ? Join the army ? 
 Could I order dinner ? 
 I want a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare . 
 That's too bad , but the porterhouse will be okay . 
 Not tonight , thank you . 
 Charge it to whatever account you like . 
 So what did you get ? 
 What's this ? Essential oil ? Wow ! This stuff is expensive . 
 How is oil supposed to make you relax ? 
 Mmmm . They smell nice . 
 You are in the right place . Please come on in ! 
 It ’ s going to come together just fine . Trust me ! 
 We start at the top with our name and contact information . Make sure the information is current . 
 Put your job experience first , if that is more impressive than your education . 
 Yes , that would make a good ending for your resume . 
 Something awful happened . We went to the Portobello Road , and someone stole my handbag . 
 No . Only a few pounds . But my passport was in the bag . That ’ what I ’ m really worry about . 
 I ’ d better go tomorrow . 
 No . I couldn ’ t find a policeman . 
 Yes . I ’ ll do it tomorrow . 
 Yes ? 
 Hello ! Do you have a place where I can exercise ? 
 I'm happy to hear that . Now , would you tell me where it is ? 
 Is the hotel going to charge me a dollar a minute for gym use ? 
 And the gym hours are ? 
 One more question , Do you have a trainer ? 
 Daddy , how are you going to spend your weekends ? 
 Could you go with me to climb Kiang Shan ? 
 Oh , Daddy , you should do more exercise . You are getting a little heavy . 
 Then go climbing with me , Daddy . Mountain climbing can build your muscles like Popeyes . 
 I give you my word , you must feel refreshed after mountain climbing . 
 That's a deal . 
 I think we should home school our children when we decide to have kids . 
 Well , our public schools here are not very good and private school are just too expensive . I have been reading up on home schooling and it has a lot of advantages . 
 Well , first of all , I would be able to teach them everything they learn in school in a more relaxed and fun way . I also think that having a one-on-one class is much better since you can focus more on his or her strengths or weaknesses . 
 I will bring it up over Sunday brunch . 
 Hey , you have been promoted to president of the department . 
 You are so smart . Your efforts in the success of the plan were outstanding . 
 You ’ Ve got a great personality . 
 I believe you will . I ’ m very pleased with your work . Your promotion will contribute to the development of the company . 
 May I speak to Mr . Smith ? 
 What time do you expect him back ? 
 Ok , I have the number . Bye ! 
 No , I assure you . 
 Ok . 
 Of course . 
 I'll see . I will if I can but I won't promise . 
 Yes . But only if you ask me nicely . 
 Ok . I'll keep my promise . 
 I usually put them into my bank account . I think that is a little secure , though the interest rate is low now . 
 Have you invested in the stock market before ? 
 But that is a little risky , you know . 
 Of course ! I remember he has a part-time job as a stock analyst . 
 Hello , Helen . 
 How are you today ? 
 I ’ m fine , thanks . How is Tony ? 
 She ’ s very well , too , Helen . Goodbye , Helen . Nice to see you . 
 Julia , Julia , Julia . My daring Julia , what's wrong with you ? 
 Yes , I have called you three times . What makes you in a daze ? 
 Did someone get hurt ? 
 What a terrible accident ! Who should be responsible for this traffic accident ? 
 Why do some guys like to drive so fast when they are drunk ? 
 Good morning ! My name is John White , import manager of the Garden Trading Company of New York . 
 Nice to meet you Mr.Li . We have learned about that you specialize in the export business of electronic products . As you enjoy the highest reputation in the commercial circle , we'd be please to enter into business relations with your firm . 
 Yes , I had a look just now , I feel we can do a lot of business in this line . 
 Our company enjoys a history of more than twenty years , we have wide connection with wholesalers and retailers all over the America , and we have good reputation in the commercial circle . 
 Sure . 
 How do you do , Mr . James ? Thank you for asking me to come in . 
 Thank you . 
 Thank you . 
 Well , I've got a date . Now I need to find a restaurant . Can you help me ? 
 Nothing but the best for a pretty woman ! 
 Well , I sort of suggested that we would go out on the town . Do you have another suggestion ? 
 Gramercy Tavern , eh ? I think I've heard of that before . Call to get us a table , okay ? 
 I'd like to reserve a room . 
 For the night of April 18th , for one night . 
 No , I'm afraid not . 
 Sure , but if you do have any cancellations , could you let me know as soon as possible ? 
 OK , thanks . 
 Yes , I would like to . 
 Hi , sir . Come and have a look here . We have all kinds of sweaters . 
 How do you like this grey one ? It ’ s pure wool , one hundred percent of Xinjiang wool . 
 Yes , we do . What size do you want ? 
 Well , you can always bring it back to us for a full refund . 
 Yes , just a moment , please . 
 I have always enjoyed flying . And I am good with people . 
 Yes , I can adjust to anything . 
 I am also calm under pressure and trained in first aid . 
 Thank you . It has always been my dream to be a stewardess . 
 I'd like to speak to someone in your Accounts Department , please . 
 Yes , please . My name's Michael Caxton from one of your customers — Rosedale Investments . 
 No , it's Caxton . 
 Rosedale Investments . 
 It's R , O , S , E , D , A , L , E . 
 It's about an invoice which is wrong . 
 Um ... yes ... it's 856674 / ros . 
 That's right . 
 Thank you very much . 
 It's nice , but still too expensive . Can you give me a 20 % discount ? 
 Come on . Let's split the difference , 15 % . 
 We've taken on a civil engineer on a nine-month temporary contract . He'll oversee the whole project . In fact we're having a project meeting at 3 p . m this afternoon allocate responsibilities and finalise the time schedule . Why don't you join us ? 
 Oh , no . It seems that I've lost my train ticket . 
 It was in my pocket , but now I can't find it . 
 No , it is not here . Damn it ! I'm going to have to buy another ticket . 
 OK . 
 Of course ! How much would you like to spend on your meal ? 
 Well , how about our own hotel restaurant ? It's conveniently located and has a three-star rating . 
 Well , how about Gramercy Tavern ? It's a very popular tourist spot , with great food and music . 
 Of course , sir . You've made a good choice . 
 What's the rush ? 
 I'm not ready to get off the phone with you . 
 What is it that you need to do ? 
 I'm not being nosey , it's just a question . 
 That was mean to say . 
 I guess . 
 Monica , wait a moment . I think we ’ d better call the repairman to do it . 
 I ’ d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company . 
 Other company rules also need your attention . 
 Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder . 
 Don ’ t mention it . 
 Yes , I have two large suitcases and one box . 
 No , thank you.They are already tagged with my name and address . 
 Good , I have my backpack and my camera tripod . 
 Both my items will fit under the seat or in the overhead bin . 
 I cannot let anything happen to that tripod.Can you guarantee it will not be damaged if I check it in ? 
 Good idea . I will ask the stewardess to help me store my tripod . 
 I'm sorry to hear that.Did you check your shoulder bag carefully ? 
 I'm afraid you can't . 
 Oh , I see . I'll call the manager , then . 
 That's all right . 
 Let me check . It has a paper jam . 
 Be careful , the cartridge can be very hot . 
 Yes . My name is Charles . 
 It's very kind of you . 
 Bring me the menu , please . 
 She might like a laptop computer . 
 Might I suggest a Mac ? 
 Well , a 15 - inch Pro is $ 2,100 . 
 Great . How would you like to pay for it ? 
 Let me ring you up . Okay , sign here , please . 
 It'll take her only a few minutes to get online . 
 So long . Thank you for shopping here . 
 Sorry , sir , in order to protect these paintings , taking photos are strictly forbidden here . 
 I am really sorry for that . 
 It ’ s nice to meet you , too , Ms . Green . This company seems so big right now ; I don ’ t know how I ’ ll ever get used to it . 
 Great – That ’ ll be big help . 
 No , I haven't . I've decided I ' m going to travel very light this time . 
 Oh ! It means that I'm going to take only a few clothes , so I didn't have to carry a heavy suitcase . 
 I'm not sure . I can't agree , dan . 
 Surely , there are other ways to save money . 
 Is there anything I can do ? 
 May I recommend the popular route ? It's a seven days ' trip and cost $ 500 . 
 Everything , sir , including the air tickets , accommodation and gate tickets . 
 Could I speak to the apartment manager ? 
 I wanted to know if that apartment on Main Street is still for rent . 
 Yes , I want to see it . 
 That time is okay with me . 
 No , thank you . I go by there on my way to work . 
 That's a good idea . Do I need to bring anything myself ? 
 I don ’ t know what I ’ m going to do ! It ’ s going to be impossible to make ends meet if I lose my job ! 
 it was a rather big mistake . When you work as an investment adviser , ONC small mistake can cost the company millions . 
 that ’ s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . There ’ s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . I ’ m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ’ s nothing I can do about tha 
 I have enough to live off of for about 3 months . But I really don't want to spend my life savings on just living ! I ’ d rather invest my money somehow . 
 that ’ s very generous of you . I guess that would work . 
 I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy . Maybe losing my job would be a good thing ! 
 It ’ s hard to say.Just so-so . 
 What's the hardware ? 
 That's seems obvious enough.then what about the software ? 
 I see , actually the hardware is the easy part , I do want to study how to use the software . 
 Ever since I saw computer can do your project , I wanted to have a computer . 
 Hi , Lucy , are you free to talk ? 
 Sure , speak to you later . It isn ’ t urgent . Maybe it is easier if I send you an e-mail . 
 Hello , this is Li King . Can I talk to your manager ? 
 Yes . Would you please kindly tell him I want to apply for a proof-reader in your newspaper ? 
 Hello . What can we do for you today ? 
 OK , could you give me your details and I'll see if it has cleared . We need your banking details and some ID . A passport or something like that ? 
 Mr Jurgen , yes , the remittance has been successful . 
 Not a problem , Sir . Please fill in this exchange form and show me your passport . 
 Let me just get five more minutes of sleep . 
 I understand , but all I want is five more minutes of sleep . 
 Trust me . I'm going to wake up . 
 I already know , and I'll take care of all that when I wake up . 
 I'll make it to school on time . Don't worry . 
 I really appreciate that . 
 Oh , four or five . How much is the rent for this apartment ? 
 150 ? No , I'm not really interested in this place . It isn't big enough . It isn't near enough to my office . 
 Oh , how high class ! So you just wear it forever ? 
 Is it dry yet ? 
 They look fake . 
 Tom ? Oh , it's been a while since we've talked to each other . Nice to hear you again . 
 Really ? 
 Why didn't she call me ? 
 Well , I may have stayed on the phone too long . Can you give me her number ? I'll call her later . 
 Thanks . So how are things with you ? 
 Wow ! Great ! Where ? 
 Yeah , it's really convenient . The theater and Shopping Mall are within walking distance . Well , I got to go . I'll get in touch with you soon . 
 Don't worry . Bye . 
 No . 
 I got robbed ! 
 Some guy on the street just mugged me . 
 No , he just stole all of my things . 
 I need to go to the police station . 
 That would be great . Thank you . 
 Come in please . 
 The toilet doesn't flush . 
 Wonderfull.Thanks a lot . 
 Come in , young man . 
 I am Smith , the personnel director . Please have a seat , son . 
 Actually , I haven ’ t had time to look it over . Did you bring another copy with you ? 
 Call me Mr . Smith . 
 Mom ! How can I help with the washing up ? 
 OK ! Then what can I do after I finish it ? 
 OK , got it . 
 Reading newspaper on the couch . 
 Staying with Ultraman , of course . You know he likes it very much . 
 I will . 
 OK ! 
 The work is rather hard , but it's interesting . 
 I work in a publishing house . How about you ? 
 What do you do then ? 
 Hi . I can't get going on my computer until I get a broadband hookup . 
 That would be okay if I had an Ethernet port . Unfortunately , my laptop uses wireless only . 
 Anything to get me up and running . 
 Fantastic ! What do I have to pay per hour ? 
 That's fine . Now tell me about the other alternatives . 
 Great ! I like that suggestion , but what if I need to print something there ? 
 I'm not sure , is this our stop ? 
 Do you have any idea where we are ? 
 This can't be the right stop . 
 We got off too early , didn't we ? 
 I should've just stayed on the bus . 
 Great , we have to walk now . 
 Is this the Friendship Hospital ? Please send an ambulance to 68 Hu Nan Road . 
 Of course . It's urgent . I think the partie nt is suffering from acute appendicitis . He may die if not treated in time . 
 ( after a while ... ) Where's the patient ? 
 Don't worry . We'll put him in the stretcher . You are coming with us ? Step in please . 
 Help the patient bathe and change his clothes , nurse . Then bring him into the operating room . 
 He had appendicitis , but is all right now that it was removed . He'll have to rest for a few weeks to recover . 
 No , outside food is not permitted . 
 Yes . But first you must observe the visiting hours , It's from 2 to 5 p . m . By the way , consult the nurse before you enter the ward . 
 By the way , you can bring some flowers . 
 Don't worry about him . 
 Our nurse can take good care of him . 
 could you show me where the Chinese-style clothing is located ? I want to buy a silk coat . 
 oh , they look nice . May I try that back one on ? 
 do you have a medium in the same color ? This one is a little tight . 
 ok , let me try it on . what do you think ? 
 really ? I'll take it , and I'm leaving here tomorrow . Is it possible for you to send one in black to me by mail when you gte it in ? 
 thanks . Who much would that come to ? 
 Are you interested in going sightseeing , Mr . Simpson ? I think you are here not only for the negotiation but also for sightseeing . 
 Shall we go to the Tiananmen Square first ? 
 It's my pleasure . Shall we go there on foot ? It's very near . 
 Welcome back racing fans ! My name is Rick Fields and , as always , I am joined by my partner in crime , Bob Copeland . 
 He came in too fast , jammed on the breaks and spun out . We have a yellow flag and the pace car is making its way onto the track . 
 Smoke is coming out of his car ! He seems to be having engine trouble ! He makes his way into the pit , and Fernando Alonso takes the lead ! 
 Hello , do you remember me ? I bought some vases from you yesterday . 
 That's right . I thought I'd come back to buy a few more souvenirs . 
 Well , first , I'd like to buy a few postcards . My sister used to always send a postcard to herself whenever she went anywhere . I want to do that , too . 
 Posters are difficult to travel with . I think I'll just buy the postcards . I heard that you might also have some of the masks that are made in Venice . 
 How much do they cost ? 
 Yes , I think I'd like the green mask in the middle . 
 I'll take it , I'd also like to buy some chocolate . 
 Yes , it's my girlfriend's birthday today and she loves chocolate . 
 They look delicious . I think she'll be pleased . 
 Thank you , yes . I'm not sure how to use this ATM , I usually go to a clerk and use my Bank Book . But today , I thought I'd try something new . I want to take some money out . 
 Thanks so much . Right , I've put my card in . What now ? 
 Then it'll give me my money ? 
 Here we are ' withdrawal ' , so I just press here ? 
 Oh , as simple as that ! I shall never wait for a real person again , these machines are wonderful . 
 Are there many accidents in the city every day ? 
 Please drive slowly , we've got lots of time . Safety first . 
 I don ’ t know who placed the call . However , the call was from Toronto . 
 Sure . 416-790-1256 . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 You haven't heard about it ? 
 This truck flipped over on the 210 . 
 I'm telling you the truth . 
 Two people were injured . 
 I think so . 
 Yes , they were lucky . 
 I have accumulated a wealth of practical experience in work as a chief advertisement designer . Moreover , I realized teamwork is the key to success . 
 I think building team spirit among the coworkers is very important . I believe we can accomplish a miracle if we stick together . 
 My advantage is that I have strong sense of responsibility . But I lack patience . 
 I will listen and learn more when I start my new job . I plan to become more professional in my field . 
 Thanks for your compliment , but there is still plenty more to learn . 
 Yes , I'd like to rent a car . 
 An automatic sedan . 
 About a week . 
 Hello , do you know anywhere that sells cheap cashmere sweaters ? 
 What a splendid idea ! 
 Thanks for helping me . 
 would you like to learn to tango Donar ? 
 i am offering you my services . for your church . what do you say ? 
 of what ? 
 no mistakes in a tango Donar.not like life , simple , that will make the tango so great . if you make a mistake , you'll get all tango done . just tango along . why don't you try ? will you try it . 
 I hate working on Christmas Eve ! Whoa ! Get a load of this guy ! Come in central , I think we ’ Ve got ourselves a situation here . 
 I had one or two glasses of eggnog , but nothing else . 
 Just a few Christmas gifts , to this season , after all ! 
 Umm ... no ... I make these in my workshop in the North Pole ! 
 You can ’ t take me to jail ! What about my sleigh ? It ’ s Christmas Eve ! I have presents to deliver ! Rudolph ! Prancer ! Dancer ! Get help ! 
 You could get him a tie . 
 Why not ? 
 Well , you can buy him a pet iguana then . 
 He would think you were crazy , Caroline . 
 How much do you want to spend ? 
 Alright , I have an idea.You know he carries that conservative-looking briefcase every day . 
 Well , he isn't a lawyer , so I don't think he needs to have a briefcase like that . 
 I think he would appreciate having a very fine leather bag.But more like a workbag or shoulder bag.You know , not so hard and square like a briefcase . 
 I don't think this mall has a leather goods store.So we have to go to State Street . 
 We can buy something for Mom and Dad here , and then go buy Uncle Teddy's gift on State Street . 
 She said she wants one of those automatic foot massagers . I think they sell them at Sears . 
 How about the iguana ? 
 A tie ? 
 I was just kidding . 
 Yes . I am sure I can . I was an English major in college . 
 Russian is my second foreign language and I excelled the rest of my class in Russian because my father is a Russian . 
 Of course , sir ... Here's the minutes of the meeting . 
 The meeting was delayed by thirty minutes and it lasted for two and a half hours . 
 Yes , I told him that you were very ill and couldn't attend . 
 Yes , I did . Besides , here are all the reports and materials handed out in the meeting . I think you'll have to do some replies . 
 No , they didn't . The chairman said he would send a memo to all managers by the end of this week informing them of the date of the next meeting . 
 I'm sorry . He's not in right now . 
 He should be back in ten minutes . Could 1 you call back later ? 
 What a mess , Jack ! 
 You ’ d better tidy up the room now , or you ’ ll get your mum ’ s back up . 
 my friend and her fiance had a really good idea . They have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . The picture are of things they want . People sign their name b 
 most of the things were household appliance . You know , everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . I think it ’ s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help 
 I bought a sewing machine . I know that my friend likes making her own clothes , but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems . 
 she says that after several years of use , it ’ s not working properly . When she uses it , it makes a funny noise . 
 I think it ’ s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . Because they know that we will buy the new models , the appliances don ’ t need to last more than five or ten year 
 Hi , I am just looking . 
 What year is it ? 
 How about the mileage ? 
 What do you mean 7B 
 Oh , why such a high mileage ? 
 Okay . Does this car have a warranty ? 
 How do I make sure I am not buying a junk ? 
 How much is it ? 
 I'll have to think about it . 
 Okay . 
 I'm very glad you could come , Mr . Liu . Will you take a seat at the head of the table ? It's an informal dinner , please don't stand on ceremony ... Mr . Liu , would you like to have some chicken ? 
 Generally speaking , Cantonese food is a bit light ; Shanghai food is rather oily ; and Hunan dishes are very spicy , having a strong and hot taste . 
 Mr . Liu , would you care for another helping ? 
 Did you enjoy the meal ? 
 I'm so glad you like it . 
 The demographic reports are in ... From the looks of it , we're going to have to re-evaluate some of the content for our promotional events in different venues . 
 According to the report , our Boston crowd is quite different make-up from our Chicago folks . Our Boston consumers are mostly from mid-level to upper-class income levels , university or postgraduates , married no children , white collar ... You know the kind . Chicago on the other hand is mostly mid to low income levels , single parent homes , blue collar ... I think we're talking about two totally different target groups . 
 No kidding . We've got to come up with two completely different sales pitches to suit the needs of each groups . 
 Until when ? 
 No problem . 
 Yes , I'm going to Europe on business and I need to purchase some Traveller's Cheques . 
 I think Euros will be the best , as I'll only be in Mainland Europe . 
 5,000 Euros will be sufficient , thanks . 
 That would be perfect , thank you . 
 No , we used to be on an industrial estate on the outskirts of York . 
 We needed larger premises so we moved to this greenfield site last year . It's nearer the motorway so it's better for transportation . 
 What kind of account do you want to open ? 
 Do you know the minimum balance you ’ re required to keep ? 
 You have to maintain a minimum balance of $ 100 . 
 Yes , really . 
 You will be fined . 
 It ’ s going to cost you $ 25 . 
 I don't have any money to buy you a burrito . 
 Look , I only have money to buy myself a burrito . 
 If you're so hungry , why don't you ask someone else for money ? 
 Well , I guess on Friday , then you can eat . 
 Why don't you just go home and eat ? 
 Well , I guess you're out of luck . 
 I'd like a hamburger and a cup of coffee.My room number is 402 . 
 Thank you . 
 sure , but I don't drink much . So I don't know what to order . 
 it sounds good . I'd like to start with a Compare . 
 stirred will be fine . 
 thanks . Does the bar have a signature drink ? 
 can you recommend one ? 
 it sounds interesting . I'll take one . 
 it tastes great . 
 yeah . 
 How big , Elizabeth ? Last time you said that , I ended up working overtime 3 nights in a row ! 
 All right , Elizabeth . But this is the last time . 
 Sure . What's your room number , sir ? 
 A minute , please . It's 6212 yuan all together . Tax included . 
 Sure . Can I have your passport , please ? 
 Thanks . Are you satisfied with your stay here with us , sir ? 
 Sure . It will be taken care of , sir . Which flight do you take ? 
 Got it , sir . It'd be great to see you again , sir . 
 My computer isn ’ t running at the same speed it used to be , it is testing my patience everyday . Can you tell me how to make it run faster ? 
 How ? 
 Very useful advice , I will try them right now . 
 Yes , of course.The dressing room is over there . 
 let ’ s start with you . How was yours ? 
 did you get to leave early then ? 
 it was nice of your boss to give you an option . My boss would never do that . 
 it was horrible ! It was just one thing after another . 
 I ’ m fine . But I have bad news . 
 I got sacked today . 
 well , I was late to work today . It was the third time I was late this week . 
 only about 5 minutes . 
 my boss is really picky about that . He never arrives late , usually works over-time , and always gets his work done on time . 
 I can see by your resume here that you studied business administration . 
 So I wonder why you want to work for a newspaper . 
 But journalism , it is a very different profession from administration.You know a lot about administration.Why don't you choose to work for a company looking for managers ? 
 A new reporter must expect to work many hours . 
 I have an issue . 
 There is a leaking pipe in my wall . 
 There is mildew . 
 Why can ’ t I call someone to fix it today ? 
 I need it done today . 
 Are you okay with me calling a plumber ? 
 I'll have to go now . 
 See you . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 Here you are . Take one at a time . 
 You are welcome . 
 I have a headache . These past few days I've been living off painkillers . Man , I feel like my head is going to explode . 
 The results are too slow . On top of that , just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me . 
 But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ? 
 Scraping is too terrifying . When they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . Cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . It looks like someone beat you up . 
 Chinese medicine is strange . The patients are already ill , and then the doctor makes them suffer more . 
 Forget it . I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself . In a little while I'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap . 
 $ 135 . 
 I'm sorry , sir.The price is fixed . 
 Here you are . 
 Yes , one box . 
 OK . By the way , can you tell me how many kilos of free baggage each passenger is allowed ? 
 First-class . 
 How many pieces of baggage can I carry on to the plane ? 
 If my baggage exceeds the allowance , what should I do ? 
 I see . Thank you very much for your information . 
 Goodbye ! 
 It depends . 
 Yes.What can I do for you ? 
 I am sorry.sir.We will send someone immediately . 
 I was born and grew up in hebes Province . I moved to Beijing , where I started taking courses for my MBA . When I completed my degree , I was offered an opportunity working for a financial services company . I've worked there for eight years . 
 I was assigned a project to design a 360 - degree performance system . It was a challenge for a person with a finance background . I met with the technical people and discussed the possibilities and obstacles . Based on that information , I selected a team and created a spreadsheet to manage the project . We got the project done on schedule . I was rewarded for outstanding results and was able to share the honors with the team . 
 For the past eight years , I have been working in the banking industry . I have a solid understanding of accounting concepts , an analytical mind and a strong attention to detail . I've had a lot of customer service training and experience , and I have been told that I excel in this area . 
 They'd say I was a handworker and a real team player . 
 I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . I'd like to postpone that decision until later . 
 Then you must hurry up.There ' s only ten minutes left . 
 What are you doing to your house ? 
 What are you going to do to it ? 
 What colour are you going to paint them ? 
 What else are you going to do ? 
 I'm calling to cancel a reservation I made earlier in the week . 
 Rudy Randolph , 818-555-1234 . My reservation begins on the second Monday of April . 
 Thanks . I'll call again when things get better at home . 
 Do you really like this straw hat , dear ? 
 But it costs an arm and leg . 
 I am calling to tell you that you are hired by our company . 
 You are welcome , Please call me if you change your mind . 
 Let's decide what to order . 
 The works ? 
 Anything to drink ? 
 I'll have a sandwich and small fries . Would you like to have some desserts ? 
 I'd like to have an ice cream 
 Sure , let's take a look at the menu first . 
 yes , we can look at the computer and computer menu at the same time . And this will help us understand both better . 
 Right now I'll teach you to open files , save files and copy files . Are you ready ? 
 This is where we sing ? These booths are so comfortable , I think I could fall asleep ! 
 I'll have whatever you're having . 
 Well ... the beer sounds good ! 
 You could get there this way , but it'd be faster to go along the Wort Street . 
 Turn right at the third intersection , you'll see the street and then walk along the street to the south . 
 Just walk for a few minutes , you'll find it . 
 Have you had a chance to look over the contract ? 
 And do you have any questions ? 
 No , probably not . For the first two weeks you may teach 10 or 15 hours . 
 I understand . That's why I didn't write the date on the contract.For the first two weeks , we will pay you according to the hours you teach.When you have 22 hours of classes , then the contract will take effect.Is that alright with you ? 
 I don't want you to misunderstand , Miss Briggs.We are very serious about hiring you . We want you to teach for us.We usually do contracts this way because it is more convenient . 
 Good . And your benefits will begin immediately . 
 Yes . We will apply for your health insurance tomorrow.And your free membership in the club starts today if you like . 
 What would you like to know ? 
 Absolutely . The only difference is in the restaurant and bar vouchers . 
 Paying club members get around 300 dollars a year in restaurant vouchers.The vouchers can be used in the restaurant or the lounge.But we don't offer vouchers to employees . 
 That's right . So in a way , it is cheaper for you than for the members.You get more benefits than they do . 
 Yes . I've prepared the contract just so that you understand everything.So that you understand the terms . 
 I'm very pleased . We look forward to having you here , Miss Briggs . 
 Yes . But I am afraid it is too thick to wear in summer . 
 How much is it ? 
 OK , that is reasonable . I will take it . 
 I think I am who you are looking for . You have got to be Rubin . 
 Rubin ! Karen and Mike have spoken about you so often that I feel like I've met you before . 
 They only said wonderful things about you . You did a good job of finding me . 
 Yes , I guess it was a choice of me or the pigeons ! 
 Lunch sounds great ! Let's head on out ! 
 Follow this road and turn right at the second intersection . It'll be right there . 
 No , it should only take you about 15 minutes by foot . 
 You're going to have coffee , aren't you ? 
 Are you going to have anything to eat ? 
 I'll have that too . 
 I agree . I ’ ll look in the paper . 
 Here ’ s an interesting ad 
 The ad says $ 325 plus deposit . 
 It ’ s available now , and it ’ s got a very good location . You won ’ t be far from work . 
 Escrow involves a lot of paperwork , but I will explain all of the steps to you as we go along . 
 The only thing I will need to see is your driver ’ s license , as I will be notarizing these papers . 
 Don ’ t worry about how many papers there are . We are going to look at them one at a time . 
 Please get any outside help that you need in understanding your escrow documents . 
 At the close of escrow , the house will be yours ! 
 Sure . How do you like your meal today ? 
 I am glad you like it . Welcome next time . 
 I need to report a missing Bank Card and Book . 
 Well , the account's in my name . Patrick Dean , that's D-E-A-N . The account number is 15273478841 . There was about 20,000 RIB inside . 
 OK , it's 672910 . 
 Sure , go ahead . 
 Sure , I can take you there actually . 
 It's fine . I was heading there anyway . 
 Yes.If you don ’ t mind sharing room , there ’ s one available . 
 $ 30.00 a week . 
 I ’ m on my way out now.Could you come back in an hour ? 
 I ’ ll have the kung PAO chicken , please . 
 Just some fried rice please . 
 No , thanks . 
 Hello . Can I help you , ma'am ? 
 Well , you can pay by mail , telegraphic or SWIFT transfer . Or you can have a banker's draft and mail it yourself to the beneficiary . 
 It depends on the amount and how fast you want that person to receive the money . A SWIFT transfer is the fastest method but a banker's draft is usually the cheapest . How much do you wanna send ? 
 Why don't you send it by mail payment order ? 
 About a week . 
 Sure . You can have a Telegraphic or a SWIFT transfer . 
 Both a Telegraphic Transfer and a SWIFT transfer will normally be credited to the payee's account within three or four working days , depending on whether the beneficiary's bank is among our correspondent banks or we have to route the transfer through a third bank . 
 You have to fill out this form , ma'am . 
 But I ’ Ve never been on a business trip before ! 
 So the company will pay for everything ? 
 That sounds good . But what do you want me to do there ? 
 Hey , Gary , great to see you again . Please have a seat . So tell me , what seems to be the problem ? 
 Well , let ’ s have a look . Open wide . Hmm ... this doesn ’ t look good . Well , it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose . We ’ ll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse , and the crown probably needs to be refitted . I ’ m going to order some x-rays . 
 No , not at all ! Just lay back and relax . 
 Excuse me . Do you think I can get there in time to catch the 11:30 train ? 
 Are you sure that I can get there in time if we take the less heavy route ? 
 How much more do I have to pay ? 
 That's acceptable . No one wants to miss a train . 
 Thank you ! 
 Weigh ? It must be a greatest Chinese invention . I've tried hard to learn it . Its rules can't be any simpler , but I've never won a game of Go . Well , it's all Greek to me ! 
 I heard it is included in the four major arts of China , is it ? 
 I know it is quite different from Western chess . 
 But isn't it the same with wiki ? 
 Now I'm sure we'll never get all our things back . They're so clever these criminals . What's the point of collecting beautiful things for other people to steal ? 
 Think how happy we were . Now this.Things always go wrong . 
 I don't feel like breakfast . I don't feel like anything . Why are we so unlucky ? It's as if there were a jinx on us . 
 Yes . Of course . But what good will it do ? That man's miles away from here by now . In our car . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , I do . 
 Yes , it's Mr . Brown . 
 Oh , this is just fine . 
 Thank you . 
 Nice to meet you . 
 You are a graduate , right ? 
 So you don't have much related work experience . 
 Well , did you get any honors or rewards in college ? 
 What about your computer skills ? 
 And anything else ? 
 I see . 
 It's such a nice day outside . Let ’ s take a walk into town and do some window-shopping . 
 I know . But we could get some exercise in , and we could get some errands run , too . Window-shopping won ’ t cost you anything . 
 Well , we could go to the newsagent's to pick up the Sunday paper , go to the butcher's to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner , and to the chemist's to pick up your prescription from the doctor . 
 Fine , we'll do that on the way home , so we don ’ t have to carry it the whole time . 
 I promise . We're only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven ’ t had time for . 
 Do you have any money ? 
 For our errands , and maybe a little extra for something from a vendor on the street . 
 I agreed to not go into the mall , but I can still look at things in the market ! 
 Even with volume sales our costs for the Exec User won't go down much . 
 We could take a cut on the price . But 25 % would reduce much our profit margin . We suggest a compromise 10 % . 
 I don't think I can change it right now . Why don't we talk again tomorrow ? 
 Robert , I have been instructed to reject the numbers you proposed , but we can try to come up with something else . 
 I understand . We propose a structured deal . For the first six months , we get a discount of 20 % and the next six months we get 15 % . 
 Then you'll have to think of something better , Robert . 
 Hello . I'm here to get my salary . 
 No problem . 
 I think just 3,000 RIB will be enough . 
 Yes . This is the first time I've come here . Could you please tell me something about it ? 
 Thank you for telling me about this . What should I do here ? 
 OK . How about after the shower ? 
 That sounds comfortable . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 All right . This way , please . 
 Yes , sir . 
 Yes , they are all distinctive Chinese . 
 How do you like this one ? It's very beautiful . 
 350 yuan . 
 Rachel ? This is John Emory speaking . 
 I ’ Ve got some bad news . All the plans sent over to the McGrath Corporation have been rejected . We ’ re going to have to start from scratch . 
 Forest Restaurant . What can I do for you ? 
 Of course . At what time ? 
 OK , sir . We are looking forward to your arrival . 
 I am sorry , sir , it's for 4 persons to have . I think it's too large for you . 
 Sorry , sir . We have never done that before . 
 May I have your name and room number ? 
 OK.sir . Please go upstairs . Someone will open the door for you . 
 Hi , I ’ m testify chen , the tour guide for the Ged Agency . We have a reservation of twenty room for tonight . 
 No . Our check out time is still be eight thirty tomorrow . 
 That ’ s alright . 
 Thank you . 
 Last trip was very terrible . I hope everything will be fine this time . Don ’ t blow it . 
 Good morning . I ’ m Mickey Huang , I have an appointment with Mr wilson . 
 That's right . My appointment is for 11 o'clock . 
 Thank you . 
 No , I'm fine . Thank you . 
 Nothing really . How about you ? 
 Well , that's cool . 
 I'm busy this Friday . I'm sorry . 
 I'm having dinner with my family 
 I'll make sure and come to your next party . 
 I'll be there . 
 Yes . Here you are . 
 By the way , please have these suits pressed . 
 You really do a good job . 
 Let's see . From here , you have to take the 278bus . 
 You should get off at the first Shi Da stop . 
 You're new at this , huh ? 
 No , it's quite simple . When you get on , just ask the bus driver when to pay the fare and where you want to get off . 
 Only 15 NT per section . Oh look , that is your bus . 
 Don't mention it . 
 Yes , it's straight ahead around the corner . 
 Take care , Peter . Don't run so fast.Are you tired ? 
 No , you mustn't sit on the grass.Don ' t you see the notes ? 
 It says Keep off the grass ! 
 Be careful.You can't smoke here . 
 Can't you see the notes there ? It says No smoking here . 
 Yes , I would like to check in . 
 Yes , my name is Carol Tiang . That's spelled J - I - A - N - G . 
 No , I don't have it with me.But I know I have a reservation . My husband made it for me last month . 
 C - A - R - O - L . Carol . 
 No , that's not me . My name is Tiang , not Larson . My husband reserved for me . 
 His name is Lin , L - I - N . 
 Miss , I know he made this reservation for me . 
 I'm rather hungry now . 
 Please give me a piece of pie first . 
 Beef , please . 
 Coffee , please . 
 Only black coffee . 
 Yeah , I ’ Ve been meaning to talk to you about that . I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline . 
 Well , the thing is , we ran into a lot of problems . . . 
 I know , and I apologize for the delay . But some things were just beyond my control . I had trouble booking the photographer , and then Michael was sick for three weeks , so I couldn ’ t include him in the photos , and the design team lost all the files , so I had to re-do the pictures . 
 Hello . Is Bob there , please ? 
 Oh . This is Paul . When will he be back ? 
 Can I leave a message please ? 
 Please tell him I'll call him at the office tomorrow afternoon . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Yes , I'd like to change some money to cover my expenses here . What's today's rate of US dollar against the RIB yuan ? 
 $ 200 altogether . 
 Here it is . And how much RIB shall I get ? 
 That's correct . Thank you very much . 
 Here you are.It ' s 90 yuan , miss . 
 20 percent is the best discount I can offer . That will came to 72yuan . 
 Thanks , Miss . I want you to see our new stock of brocade satin , a splendid line , just came in . 
 I'll just have this all wrapped up for you . 
 $ 60 . 
 Yes , the shoes on that shelf are on sale now . They are much cheaper . 
 Have you any package tour to Italy ? 
 How long does the route No . 5 last ? 
 We have just 10 days for the vacation . 
 I wish to buy a diamond ring . 
 I want five carats . 
 No , it seems too old-fashioned to my fiancee . 
 It seems too small for me , haven't you got any larger ones ? 
 Oh , this one is perfect . 
 Yes . We don ’ t give bonus every month , but we offer semi-annual bonuses . 
 Yes . Commission will be given on the basis of your sales revenue . And the percentage will be 2 % of your total revenue . 
 Hello , I want confirm my flight . My name is Jesse . 
 June loth . 
 Yes , thanks . By the way , what time do I have to start check-in ? 
 Hello , have you made a reservation ? 
 Of course.How do you like your room ? 
 OK , how long are you staying ? 
 How many do you intend to order for our shirts ? 
 We are not interested in small orders . I suggest you order at least 2 000 dozen . 
 Yes , of course . We have enough productivity . You can rest assured . 
 Sure , we can reduce our price by ten percent . 
 I want to change rooms immediately , plus a refund for tonight . 
 I'm knee-deep in cockroaches ! 
 Thank you . I'm glad that this hotel strives to keep its reputation intact . 
 We've got a problem ... it looks like we'll need more spotlights on the exhibition booth . The client thinks it's too dark , and they want to add halogen lighting . We've already got 3 sets of track lighting from you guys , do you think you could help us out and throw in some halogens ? 
 But it would only be adding to the existing structure . We're not talking about anything new here ... 
 How much do you think it would cost ? 
 $ 500per light ? ! That's ridiculous ! It can't possibly be that expansive ! 
 Can't you give me a break on this ? We've already spent so much money on lighting , I hate to have to blow so much more on halogens . 
 What a charming room ! It faces south , and there's such a lovely view of the city . 
 No , I shouldn't think so . By the way , is there a socket for my razor ? 
 Is it a two-pin socket ? 
 Good , I ' Ve get a two-pin plug . 
 They think you are just a child . 
 Maybe you are right . Well , you can talk with them . 
 Oh , good ! You know , I am looking at my plate and I ordered scrambled eggs , not fried . 
 I can just trade with him , thank you . 
 I am sorry , but I think I ordered waffles . 
 Just please take my pancakes to trade for waffles . While I am waiting , I will eat my bacon and eggs . 
 I would appreciate that . 
 Hello , there . I'd like to know about Clean Collection . My company in the US is going to send me a cheque . It's for my wages , but I'm not too sure about how to cash it here . 
 Is there any way we can speed it up ? 
 Do I check in for the train D8 08 to Shanghai here ? 
 Here you are . By the way , when does the train leave ? 
 Thanks . Where is my seat ? 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , I am interested in finding a one-bedroom apartment near Washington Square . 
 Oh , good . Can you describe it ? 
 So is there a refrigerator ? 
 It sounds great . How much is the rent ? 
 When can I see it ? 
 Ok , that would be great . 
 Hi there . I'd like to draw some cash from my Fund Account at the Securities Company . Could I check my balance before I withdraw anything ? 
 I'd like 20,000 RIB , please . If that's possible . 
 Good morning , Doctor ! 
 I am not feeling very well . I've got a bad cold . 
 No , but I've got a headache . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Sure Tracy , let me just get my laptop . 
 Um , Tracy ? I think that ' s a little too formal . I know you want to be polite but you've already made contact with them , so in English you can be more relaxed in the opening ... 
 Okay Tracy , now it's too relaxed ! You've still got to show some respect . How about starting with " Dear Ms . Cooper , I'm writing to confirm ... ? 
 That's great ... 
 Woo , okay , back up a second , Tracy . That's too direct . Can I suggest you say , please note that final payment is due two working weeks before publication ? You don't want to offend her . 
 Mmmm , maybe , but I'd play it safe and just finish with " Yours Sincerely " . That's more professional . 
 Bruno's . 
 Oh , certainly . I'm Linda , the Manager . I can help you with that . How many will there be in your party ? 
 Okay . For a party that size , we have a separate banquet room in the back . 
 No , as long as you can guarantee at least 15 guests , there is no extra charge . 
 The cake is no problem at all , but we do charge a corkage fee of $ 15 a bottle for any alcohol not purchased from the restaurant . 
 Great . I have the banquet room reserved for a lunch on for Nika Corporation on the 2nd of December . May I have your name and contact information ? 
 Thanks , Mr . McQuillin . I'll give you a call a week in advance to confirm the arrangements . 
 Thank you for choosing Bruno's . We look forward to seeing you on the 2nd . 
 Yes , show me your ticket and passport please . 
 No problem . Wish you a nice trip . 
 One bottle of perfume and a watch . 
 In Boston . 
 Oh ... I go to see my sister twice a year or so . 
 Nearly ten years . 
 I can't remember , but I've got the receipt somewhere . Would you like to see it ? 
 Yes . Does that mean I'll have to pay duty on it ? 
 Ok . Here you are . Is that all right now ? 
 Yes , I did . I had a fine time . 
 Could you tell me something about safety deposit box rental , please ? I need somewhere safe to keep some insurance documents ; I just simply don't feel comfortable keeping them at home or in the office . 
 I think I'll go for the smallest , as it's just for documents . Will I be the only key holder ? I'd perhaps feel a little nervous if I knew someone else could have access to it at any time . 
 That's great ; I can give an extra key to my wife . I feel perfectly comfortable with her having a key . Thanks for your help . 
 OK , I'll take a small , for 1 year , in this branch , please . 
 I agree , Toni . I think the biggest problem we ’ re facing is how to bring it in under budget . 
 Right . Look , why don ’ t we make a list of the problems we ’ re dealing with . It ’ ll be easier to work through them that way . 
 I hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field.Since my major was international banking , I really hope to work at a bank . 
 Because your bank is a new one , I think I'll be given more opportunities , and the working conditions and surroundings are so excellent here . 
 I expect to work hard , madam . 
 No , I enjoy travelling . 
 Surely of course.Here you are . 
 No , it stopped at Honolulu.Would you like to book one ? 
 Let me see . I am sorry . ZW203 is the only one to New York . 
 No problem . What size would you like ? 
 How about this one ? It's our biggest — 16 ' in diameter . 
 Okay , try this one . It's made of aluminum . 
 Here you go . Same pan , but with a state-of-the-art , heat-resistant plastic handle . 
 Great . Will that be cash or charge ? 
 I'm sorry . I forgot to show you the lid . It comes with the pan . 
 Of course . Which one do you like best ? 
 Try this one . You can get a picture by simply pressing the shutter . 
 Oh great ! This stupid computer froze again ! That's the third time today ! Hey Samuel , can you come take a look at my PC ? It's acting again . It must have a virus or something . 
 But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing theinternet , I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus . 
 Ok . Anything else ? 
 Um yeah . Sorry about that . 
 I think you should work out more too . 
 I have lost about five kilos . 
 I was on a diet and exercised daily . 
 You can try a low-impact workout schedule . Why don't you go to a gym ? 
 The secret is persistence . 
 Yes , but don't cut them yet . Wait until they cool . Where is the big plastic bowl ? 
 What's Donna like , by the way ? 
 Oh , Paul is very easy-going and friendly . 
 Yes , sure . Which cupboard is it in ? 
 There is no pepper here . 
 Hello . Excuse me . Do you know if there's a Commercial Bank around here ? 
 Straight on , and turn right . Is it far ? 
 Thanks very much . 
 Hello . Is Becky there , please ? 
 Thanks . 
 That ’ s okay . I ’ ll call back later . 
 I have booked a table for 3 this evening . I would like to cancel it . 
 Sure . Brown and we have reserved a table next to the door . 
 If I wanted to rent a van , how much would it cost ? 
 That sounds OK . I'll need it from the 10th to the 14th . 
 Yeah . Here . 
 Good morning , sir . May I help you ? 
 OK . In cash or by credit ? 
 Five hundred and thirty yuan altogether including charges for service . 
 Not at all . Welcome again . 
 I haven't heard anything . 
 Nobody told me . 
 I really wasn't told anything . 
 Wow , how exciting . 
 Of course I will . 
 I appreciate that . 
 Oh , no ! I can't have failed . Are you sure ? 
 It sucks . But Arden told me he's satisfied with my qualifications and experience . 
 How am I going to face the fellows in our office ? They thought I would be promoted . They must be waiting for my good news . 
 But I lost the chance . 
 Come on.Plenty of room upstairs.Fares please ! 
 One dollar ... I'm short of change this morning . 
 Good , here's your ticket and four dollars change . 
 Can you recognize that woman , Millie ? 
 I thought so . Who ’ s that beside her ? 
 Conrad Reeves , the actor ? It can ’ t be . Let me have another look . I think you ’ re right ! Isn ’ t he her third husband ? 
 Doesn ’ t Karen Marsh look old ! 
 I ’ m sure she is . 
 That was a long time ago , wasn ’ t it ? 
 Shall we buy ? 
 But if you were me ? 
 Hello . This is Doctor Bell ’ s Office . Can I help you ? 
 I ’ m sorry to hear that . Cancelling the appointment is no problem . Thank you for your call . 
 Excuse me , which one is of the highest quality here ? 
 That is nice . But I don't quite like the collar . 
 I don't care what others wear . How much is it ? 
 Really ? Too expensive . I don't think I can afford it . 
 OK , anyway , let me have it . 
 Thank you . 
 Give me five more minutes . I'm really tired this morning . 
 I get that , but let me just sleep for a little bit longer . 
 Believe me . I will get up and get ready in five minutes . 
 I understand , and it will get done after I wake up in five minutes . 
 I'm going to be on time today . 
 Thanks a lot .

 We provide up-to-date training on state of the art equipment . 
 Down the hall . I'll show you when the interview is over . 
 I am not surprised , you eat too much . 
 No , I wouldn't think so . 
 Well , why don't you go on a diet ? 
 Perhaps you should excercise more . Why don't you go to an exercise class . 
 Do you have a reservation , sir ? 
 I'm sorry . The restaurant is full now . You have to wait for about half an hour . Would you care to have a drink at the lounge until a table is available ? 
 Yes , of course . May I have your name , sir ? 
 We'll try to arrange it but I can't guarantee , sir . 
 What is your most preferred training method ? 
 Well , that is also very efficient , right ? 
 That ’ s boring . Once we were asked to watch a video on how to operate the punches , all of us seemed to fall into sleep by the end of the video . 
 there's a great sitcom on Channel 3 that stars in about three minutes . 
 the office . Have you watched it ? 
 it's almost exactly the same . I think it's a hilarious show . 
 they're just showing highlights of American Idol from last night right now . 
 I couldn't agree with you more . 
 we have digital TV . It's amazing though---even with 100 channels , there's often nothing on that I'd want to watch ! 
 I guess so . I'm bit of a couch potato . How about you ? 
 there's actually a documentary on the history channel later on that I'd like to watch . Do you want to stay and watch it with me ? 
 Good afternoon , ma'am . Can I help you find anything ? 
 We have a special on these skirts this week . Would you like to try one on ? 
 How about a blouse ? This one here is the latest fashion . 
 Why not try on this lovely pair of shorts ? I'm sure they'd look fabulous on you . 
 Take a look at this dress ! Don't you think it's perfect for you , ma'am ? Uh , where are you going , ma'am ? Ma'am ?

 That sounds great . I'm absolutely starving ! What kind of food are you in the mood for ? 
 You're a woman after my own heart . I don't know many people who can handle spicy food . Are you sure you are up for hotpot . 
 Ok , you're really all eyes when it comes to talking about food , aren't you ? 
 Let me think about it for a minute . Let's see ... oh the name of the restaurant is on the tip of my tongue ! Give me a second and it'll come to me . 
 No ... 
 That's it ! That's the one I was thinking of ! I told you I'd remember it ! 
 I lost my wallet . 
 Can you suggest a few exercise to help me get fit and stretch my muscles a little ? 
 I need to excise my arms too . How can I do that ? 
 When I do push-ups , should I bend my elbows so that my nose touches the ground ? 
 What ’ s a good exercise for my chest muscles ? 
 So I need plenty of space for this exercise . 
 Great . Thanks for you advice ! 
 Yes , could you cash these travaler's check for me , please ? 
 Ok , here you are . 
 It doesn't matter . 
 Hello , is there a room available ? 
 A twin room , please . 
 Oh , I see . Thank you anyway . 
 Oh , Tom ! I thought you were in Paris . 
 Good to see you too ! 
 Thanks a lot . That's the favor I was going to ask you for . 
 Tristan , could you stay a few extra minutes to discuss your project with me ? 
 Are all of your team members on schedule ? 
 How have they decided to deal with that ? 
 That's true dedication . I'm impressed . When is it due ? 
 Right . Well , given that your colleagues are working so hard on this project , I suppose we could change that deadline to Monday morning , I won't have time to look over it on the weekend anyway . 
 That's alright . Make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the new deadline . 
 I know you have a tight schedule , so I won't take up more of your time . Have a good evening . 
 Hello , this is Chen Kun . I am booked on flight LJ88 for Barcelona on Jan . 19th . 
 Now I am afraid I can't get to the airport on that day . I want to change my flight for the 21st.Is that all right ? 
 Fine.Thank you so much . 
 Good afternoon , Mr . Brown . My name is Mrs . Anderson , manager of the sales department . 
 Nice to see you too , Mr . Brown . Won ’ t you sit down ? 
 What would you like , tea or coffee ? 
 Is it your first trip to the Fair , Mr . Brown ? 
 Good . Is there anything you find changed about the Fair ? 
 Really , Mr . Brown ? Did you find anything interesting ? 
 We are glad to hear that . What items are you particularly interested in ? 
 All right . 
 I received some leaflets in the post from you , one of them talked about a new service you have where you can transfer money between this bank and securities companies . Is that right ? 
 I also read that if the customer is a stock investor , which I am , it's possible to get additional benefits ? 
 What if I don't want to come in to the branch , can I use the consultation service over the phone ? 
 Hi , Carlos . What are you doing this afternoon ? 
 Well . I was just wondering if you would come by and give me a hand with the fliers for next week ’ s party . 
 Well , tell me something of yourself . 
 What working experience have you got ? 
 Oh , good . Irene , can you tell me why you plan to quit being a sales manager to work here as my assistant ? Don't you like your present job ? 
 Is that room service ? 
 May I ask for a wake-up call tomorrow morning ? 
 6:30 . My room number is 305 . 
 Of course . We can give you a call anytime you like . 
 Your wish is our command . Expect a call at 7 , and another one at 7 fifteen . 
 The second call is now changed to 7 thirty . Is there anything else we can help you with ? 
 We're here all night long if you need anything . 
 Congratulations ! This is your first interview ever . 
 sure , you should prepare so that you can give proper response when you're being interviewed . 
 you should collect as much information about the company and the position you're applying for as you can . It is important to show that you've done some research into the company . The interviewers Wil 
 smile at the interviewers and look them in their eyes while trying to persuade them to select you . Try to act natural , let your personality , ability and interpersonal skills shine through the interview 
 yeah , wear formal clothes to your interview and do be punctual . That'll leave your interviewers with a good first impression . 
 Yes . I'd like to change some money , please . 
 Let me see . I think maybe 600 USD at least . 
 Six hundred US dollars . 
 But I am badly in need of the amount . Might I ask you to make an exception for me ? 
 It's just too bad . I have to leave it as it is , and thank you just the same . 
 To this place , please . 
 How long does it take to get to the hotel ? 
 Here's the hotel . 
 That's 10 dollars . 
 Yes , surely . 
 No , you don't . It is free of charge . 
 Certainly , would you wait for a few minutes ? 
 Yes , what is it ? 
 Sure , I'll be back in a minute . 
 I have had an incredible boss , who was my direct supervisor during the last year of my coop work experience . A-bout two months after I began working for her , she really let me spread my wings . She encouraged me to work independently , because she said she had come to trust my judgment and commitment . So I was able to move forward on projects without having to check in with her every day . Of course , I made certain that she knew what I had accomplished on a daily and weekly basis because I gave her summary reports , although she didn't specifically ask me to . Without her support and encouragement , I don't think I would have felt confident enough to have written up a proposal suggesting that the department change a process that had been in place for a long time . But she was open to suggestions , so long as employees could back them up with research and facts . When I submitted my suggestion , she reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work . She then took my revised proposal to her boss . He was a more conservative type , but she lobbied him to try It for several weeks . He did , and it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change . I've also worked for some very difficult bosses in summer and part-time jobs . And while I'd certainly prefer to work for one like I've just described , I'm the kind of person who can get along with just about anyone . 
 Just one second , sir , and I'll give you your receipt . Here you go . 
 Sir , did you enjoy your stay here ? 
 I'm glad you enjoyed the city , anyway . But please don't think too unkindly of us . 
 It ’ s probably just people trying to get an early start out of the city for the weekend . Nobody sticks around in the summer . 
 Actually , you might because there ’ s a big convention in town this weekend . 
 What do you think a job means to you ? 
 May I ask you why you left the job ? 
 Excuse me , but I'm looking for a gift for my friend . 
 Well , it's a wedding gift . 
 Basically . But I have no idea what to get ! She's American and kind of ... 
 Why did you stay home today ? 
 Good evening ! I don't believe we've met before . May I introduce myself ? My name is Jack . 
 I'm very happy to meet you . You're from the United States , aren't you ? 
 I've been to Salt Lake City a few times . I really like your city . 
 Here's the dress you wanted to be made . 
 What's the matter ? 
 What's wrong with it ? 
 This is a pity ! 
 Thank you . 
 Three . Would you please help us take them to the hall ? 
 How can I help you ? 
 Do you have an appointment ? 
 I wonder if Mr . Smith forgot your meeting . I am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until 4 p . m . Let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place . Will you please have a seat ? 
 Yes , Mr . Mason . I just checked with our office manager , Ms . Terry . She said Mr . Smith briefed her on your project . She is just finishing up a meeting now . She should be with you shortly . Would you like me to show you around while you are waiting ? 
 Right this way , Mr . Mason . We can start with our front office . When Ms . Terry is ready , you may take the elevator at the front to the 6th floor.There is a conference room already prepared . 
 Hello , yes , I'm a stock investor and I'm looking at opening a new account with you . Perhaps your new compound savings one ? I already have a Current Account with you . 
 I'm mostly interested in the personalized services you offer , with stock market news , etc . It sounds just perfect for me , as I'm too busy to be constantly at the computer checking the performance . 
 What I need to know is how I can keep track of what's going on . I mean , some days I buy and sell quite a lot . Some days , there's no activity at all . 
 That's just what I need , sometimes I'm pretty forgetful . 
 Really , what's wrong with it ? 
 Oh , do you use your computer often ? 
 Don't worry . Have you got receipt with you ? 
 We'll go to your house and repair it on Tuesday . Ok ? 
 See you then . 
 Your results are posted on the website . Just put in your password and you can see the exact numbers . 
 We always contact you by phone to come in if there is a need for follow-up . 
 The purpose of each test is given on the site . 
 The website will give you your results and then tell you what the normal range is . 
 Yes , you can see every test for the past five years . You can compare them . 
 I feel like having some dumplings . Let's go out to eat . 
 Of course . What do you want me to do ? 
 I can do that . And I would like to make dumplings later . 
 Absolutely . 
 I would like to have a hamburger . 
 I don't want cheese on it . 
 I think I'm going to get a soda today . 
 A Sprite sounds good . 
 Let me get a bag of chips too . 
 That's all . 
 I'm figuring out my budget . 
 I'm making a shopping budget , so that I don't spend too much money . 
 I can only spend $ 300 a month . 
 I need to save the rest . 
 I need to pay my bills . 
 I know . It's going to save me a lot of money , I hope . 
 Hello , Dana , this is Kevin Abrahams from Eureka Corp . I don't know if you'll remember me but we met last week at the Chamber of Commerce luncheon . 
 Great . Do you have a few minutes right now for me to tell you a little bit more about the data management tools our company has to offer ? It won't take long . 
 Oh , sure , I understand . I'd be happy to send you a promotional packet about the programs that I think might best suit a company of your size . Would it be okay if I called again to see if you have any questions ? 
 No problem at all . I won't keep you any longer . I'll put a package to you in the mail and we'll go from there . 
 Thanks for your time . 
 Susan , Is the manager in this office ? 
 Oh , that's too bad . I just got a phone call saying that my wife is now in the hospital . She is going to deliver a baby . I must take the day off to go to the hospital . May I talk to him to ask for leave ? 
 Oh , that's very kind of you . Thank you very much . I've got to go . 
 Have you brought your student card ? 
 In that case , you have to buy two full fare tickets . 
 Hi , how are you ? 
 That's for sure . You're new , too , huh ? 
 My dear , it's five flights up ! 
 We're little further away from the street and traffic noise 
 Is the place well-furnished ? 
 What about the kitchen ? 
 And I don't see any loose electric wiring that could cause fires . 
 The plumbing seems OK , too . 
 And the sinks don't seem to leak . 
 How was Elvin ? 
 Another note ? But how ? I didn't see anyone ! 
 Uh-oh . He's heating up . What are you going to do now ? 
 You do ? Who ? 
 Just so so.There are no exciting things for me . 
 I'll do it later , Dad . I must prepare the concert on Saturday . 
 We hope so . 
 Oh dad . You don't understand at all . 
 I don't need it to play the guitar . 
 I'm sorry . 
 Er , good morning , yes , er ... 
 Oh , yes . Arm , well , could you tell me your name , please ? 
 Oh , yes . Arm , well , what exactly is it that interests you about the job ? 
 Really , mmmm . Arm , well , could you perhaps tell me a little about yourself ? 
 Where exactly have you been working , please ? 
 I ’ m so excited . 
 I ’ m going back to college . 
 I haven ’ t thought about it yet . 
 You won ’ t see me here again . 
 I know . 
 Thanks . I know things are going to be better . 
 Ah , hello . Do you have a service for buying Traveller's Cheques ? 
 That would be wonderful . 
 But what if something happened to them ? What would happen to my money ? 
 OK , I'd like to purchase 500 US dollars worth of Traveller's Cheques , please . 
 Probably nothing . 
 Romantic ? I can ’ t remember what that word means . 
 Ha , ha ! Those days are long gone . 
 All right , madam . When I was sales manager at the Beijing Friendship Store . I succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 percent and profit margins from 50 percent to 80 percent . 
 I don't think so . I'll create further achievement in the future . 
 Yes . I got the title of Advance Worker in 2006 . 
 Yes . I wrote a thesis entitled On Interpersonal Relations in the Socialist Market Economy and it was published in China Daily . 
 Oh , hi . Thanks for getting back to me quickly . 
 I was calling about your son . 
 Your son was acting up in class . 
 He was talking and causing a disturbance during class . 
 If you could just talk to him , I would greatly appreciate it . 
 Don't worry about it , but thank you very much . 
 Yes , I remember it was inspired by a New York Times best-seller of the same name . 
 Exactly . It reveals the dark side of the all-American meal . 
 I think America really deserves the name of " fast food nation - as people can find McDonald ' s , KFC and Pizza Hut almost all over the States . 
 Sure . You see , Tom , fast food is a lifestyle that craves convenience . People just don't care whether it is healthy or not . 
 What are they ? 
 They're much better 
 That's the point . People usually don't have much time to think about it when they have a on-the-go meal . 
 I suppose so . 
 That was my fault . I'm sorry . 
 I don't see any damage . 
 I don't see anything wrong with it . 
 That's not my fault . 
 I'll take care of everything . I just need your phone number and insurance . 
 Here you go . 
 I want to apply for a passport here . 
 ( 10 minutes later . ) Hi . Here are completed forms . 
 Here you are , But I forgot my photos . 
 OK . I am going right now . 
 Yes.Thank you very much . 
 Oh , is it ? 
 Yes , certainly.You have the receipt ? 
 Then would you kindly come to our shop with the receipt by 10 o'clock ? We will replace it . 
 Hello , may I help you ? 
 Of course . We would be happy to cash it for you . 
 Well , any bank will cash it at our present traveler's check buying rate , for which we ’ re somewhere cheaper than hotels because of the service charge . You see , hotels really aren ’ t in the money exchange business although they will cash traveler ’ s check for their guest . 
 No , madam . Not very much . 
 Yes , I'll be happy to cash these for you . Would you please countersign them here ? 
 Hello . 
 Mick ! Nice to hear from you again . How are you ? 
 Oh , not so bad . I've been very busy , but I'm going away on holiday soon . 
 New house ? Really ? 
 Well , that depends . When is it ? 
 Well . . . I'm going away on Sunday morning . Very early . Will the party go Convery late ? 
 All right . I'll come . But I'd like to bring a present Something for your new house.What would you like ? 
 But I'd still like ... 
 Yes , it has . I'm looking forward to seeing you . too . and your new house . Uh . . . when does the party start ? 
 Yes . Oh . by the W .. 
 Wait a moment , Mick . You haven't . . . Mick ? Are you still there ? You haven'tgiven me your new address . Hello ? Mick ? Hello ? 
 I use several services . Of course , I deposit and withdraw money quite often . I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account . I use my bank to exchange money form once currency t 
 I sometimes use traveller's cheques , but sometimes I travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash . 
 Yes , I do . It saves me a lot of time . I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines . 
 Yes . My bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage . There ’ s a lot of competition between banks nowadays . Each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others . 
 I don ’ t have one . I prefer to buy shares . My bank also provides a share trading service . It ’ s cheap and easy to use . 
 Rose , is this you ? 
 This is Susan . Would you mind taking charge of decorating the office for our Christmas party ? 
 You can get your supplies upstairs from Mrs . Horn . 
 You can ask Frank and Cathy to help you . 
 It's none of your business . 
 I'm going out anyway . Get out of my way . 
 What kind do you want ? 
 How many pounds would you like me to get you ? 
 Exactly what type of ground beef do you want ? 
 I'll get that for you right now . 
 Don't mention it , I'll just wrap this up for you . 
 Excuse me , sir , the toilet in my room doesn't flush . 
 812 . 
 The tap is always driving . I can't sleep well . 
 It's so earlier this morning , Mr . Li ! You just came back yesterday , you should have rest much more . 
 How about this post-trip ? 
 Really ? 
 OK , it's no problem . 
 Yes , what can I do for you ? 
 OK , please don't worry about it . You should set your mind at rest . 
 Thanks your flatter . 
 Pleased to see you , too , Mr . Brown . 
 Yes , a very pleasant journey , thank you . 
 So it is , I've come again to renew our sole agency agreement for another 2 years . 
 I'm glad you're satisfied with our work . I can assure you we've spared no effort and spent quite a sum of money in pushing the sales of your products . 
 Thank you . 
 That is the result of our hard work . Well , what annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then ? 
 No , no . That's too big a number to be acceptable . Let's put it at 450 pieces . And we'll strive to sell more , of course . We wish to add another clause . For every 50 pieces sold in excess of the quota , we'll get 1 % more in commission for our efforts . 
 I suppose all the other terms remain unchanged . 
 No , certainly not . That's a reasonable restriction . 
 Yes , we've already prepared one . I've brought it with me . I'll put it forward when we talk with the manufacturers tomorrow . 
 Good . 
 Yes , I think so too . 
 Let me think ... I want to know if the company can provide free accommodation for a new employee . 
 I really hope that your company could provide living places ; otherwise I have to rent a house to live . 
 That would work too . 
 Some companies will pay part of the phone bills for the employees . Will this company do so ? 
 I understand . Will the company provide training ? 
 That's great . Thank you very much . 
 I'd like a table for two , please . 
 No , I'm afraid not . Can I sit over there ? There's a table free by the window . 
 Fine . I'll sit here . 
 I'll have a double whiskey on the rocks . 
 Our softball team is in the finals ! We ’ re playing the McGrath office on Saturday . 
 What are the branches of Operations ? 
 It seems that it is a key department for providing materials and transportation . 
 So , Emily , how was your day ? 
 It can't have been that bad . Go on and tell me about it . 
 Why ? What happened ? 
 That's not very fair . What did you do ? 
 Does he treat everyone in your department like this ? 
 Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ? 
 Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at your company ? 
 That's very sensible . It sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders . 
 That's so true . When you have a taste for success , you can't let dishonest people like your manager get in the way . 
 I would be happy to answer any questions you might have . 
 What about income ? Did you make any money during that period ? 
 When you filled out your Continued Claim Form , did you show that income ? 
 What happens is , when you make money , we take part of your benefits away . 
 I wouldn ’ t do that if I were you . There is a severe penalty if you get caught making false statements . 
 Thank you ! Guess how much it costs . 
 Your offer is way off the mark . It set me back only sixty-five . 
 Neither . I drove a hard bargain with the vendor before I got the price down . 
 Three hundred ! That's daylight robbery . How dare she play tricks on an old hand like me ? Without hesitation , I gave my offer---no more than fifty . 
 Not at all ! She's really been around , and seemed quite accustomed to bargaining like this . That's the trade . She only demanded a higher bid , saying the purchase price was even higher than seventy . She was lying ! Then I inquired , ' May I have it at sixty ? ' she waved her head . 
 Yeah . I turned around and started to move out . Just then , she yelped behind my back , ' all right , all right ! I may sacrifice a little . Let's fix it sixty-five ! Can't be cheaper . ' 
 Let's take a roundabout way . 
 Look , traffic jam again ! 
 I am Mr . Foster , and we have a 7:00 dinner reservation tonight for four people . 
 We are going to have a drink while we are waiting . Please let the hostess know that she can find us there . 
 Those patio tables are new , aren't they ? Would it be possible to be seated out there ? 
 We would love to sit outside . Thanks for your help ! 
 Yes , could you please bring us a pitcher of margaritas and four glasses while we are figuring out our dinner order ? 
 We'll be ready to order by the time you get back ! 
 Yes , I am Professor Clark . 
 Yes , how are you doing ? 
 That sounds painful . Are you going to be OK ? 
 How many days will you be out of school ? 
 I am glad you let me know that you will be missing class . Get well ! 
 Yeah ? Why ? Don ’ t you like living with me ? 
 Well , check the newspaper . 
 Yeah , prices have really gone up the past couple of years . 
 No , it ’ s pretty good . Why not give the landlord a call ? 
 You should not have criticize your son in front of his friends . 
 I know . But at that time your blame is rubbing salt into his wounds . 
 But it is not the right time . 
 Yes , I would like to make a reservation for May 3rd . 
 Only one . 
 John . 
 Let's have a look . Oh yes , you need a 10 mm ring spanner . Here you are . Just leave it on the workbench when you finish . 
 No problem . 
 Oh , nice to see you . The apartment is on the tenth floor . The previous tenant just moved out yesterday . 
 Sure . Let me show you the way . Here we are . Apartment 1008 . ( They enter . ) This is the living room dining room combination . Here's the kitchen . It's small , but fully equipped . The refrigerator is new , and the stove and the microwave oven are less than a year old . 
 Yes . And there's a walk-in closet . 
 Yes , there's central air conditioning and heating . The thermostat is in the living room 。 
 It's 600 yuan per month.The rent is due no later than the tenth of the month . We ask that you leave a month's rent as a deposit . It will be returned to you at the end of your lease . 
 Why do you want to be a teacher ? 
 In what department do you wish to work if we hire you ? 
 I think if I ’ m going to find a job , I ’ ll look over the job board . 
 Right , so I picked up a copy of the Sunday Globe this morning . 
 No , why should I ? The Globe ’ s help wanted section is the best . 
 Not enough to worry about . Why do I waste the money buying two papers ? 
 I guess you ’ re right . I'll get a Herald as soon as I finish looking over the Globe . 
 Mary , today a man from an intermediary gave me a call . 
 He said he saw my job-seeking information on the Internet , and could offer me an appropriate job . 
 It's a recruiting agency which specializes in introducing talented people to companies and businesses . 
 It's on telemarketing . 
 No , he said the employers will pay for it . 
 I feel it is OK and I want to give it a try . 
 Of course , I will . 
 I have a parking ticket to pay for . 
 Yes , I remembered to bring my ticket with me today . 
 I didn't bring my ID . 
 What do you need my ID for ? 
 All right , I see what you mean . 
 Will everything be cleared from my record ? 
 Here's the dress you wanted it to be made . 
 What's the matter ? 
 What's wrong with it ? 
 This is a pity ! 
 Yes , please . I'm picking out some presents for my children and wife . 
 Actually , I don't know exactly . Do you have anything recommended ? 
 Hey , How did you know I came from America ? 
 How much again ? 
 That's really cheap for shoes like those . OK , I'll take 5 pairs . 
 Why not ? 
 Oh , my God . I've totally forgotten about that . Anyway , I think she would like a bottle of perfume . 
 DENY ? That's very expensive in America . It costs nearly $ 70 for only 50ml.DKNY ? 
 That's very unbelievable . Is it fake ? 
 OK , I'll take one . 
 Please keep calm . I know the pain isn ’ t what flesh and blood can stand . But be brave . 
 Your office called and said that the owners had made a counter-offer to my offer to purchase their house . 
 I think that maybe I should accept their offer . 
 I want to make another offer , but I am afraid that they will decline and I will lose this house . 
 I would now like to offer three hundred and thirty thousand dollars as a counter-offer . 
 Can you tell me how long it will take them to get back to me ? 
 You heard who won the election , right ? 
 McCain won the election . 
 I ’ m upset , too . 
 People must want him as our President . 
 I have more bad news . 
 I was only kidding , because Obama won the election . 
 When could we meet to discuss the project ? 
 I prefer Monday . 
 Either one is OK . 
 I will be prepared to do my presentation . 
 Everyone needs to be there . 
 I think I know where it is . Maybe you could send me directions just to make sure . 
 May I help you , ma'ma ? 
 First you must check in at Counter No . 4 . 
 That's right . Then you will follow the signs to Gate 85 . 
 My stay is over . Here's the key to my room . 
 Many thanks . 
 This could be a great hotel , once you get rid of the insects . The city itself is great . 
 What reason do you have for missing school ? 
 How were you sick ? 
 Did it get any better ? 
 Would you like anything for your stomach ? 
 Get better . 
 Do you want some dessert ? 
 Where is our waitress anyway ? 
 I'll walk over and get the bill , since I don't think the waitress is coming over here any time soon . 
 So the bill is $ 36.00 . 
 My first inclination is to leave nothing for a tip . 
 Let's leave 10 % , so that we at least leave something for the service . 
 Hello ? 
 I ’ m sorry . I think you are calling the wrong person . My name is not Mr . Bernie . 
 No problem . 
 I ’ m afraid not . Don ’ t you see I ’ m looking up a word in the dictionary ? 
 Well , wait a minute . 
 I wouldn't call myself introverted . Sometimes I enjoy being by myself very much . But other times I like sharing activities with others too . 
 Well , I approach things very enthusiastically , I think , and I don ’ t like to leave something half-done . It makes me nervous . I can ’ t concentrate on something else until the first thing is finished . 
 For me , this would be having good relationships with my family members . My family has always been very close knit , and we still spend a lot of time together . 
 Working hard and being frugal are both virtues . I strive to practise these two virtues in my life . 
 I had meetings back to back all morning . And phone rang off the hook from the minute I walked into the office . 
 I can ’ t believe it . I guess I ’ ll be here until 10 again tonight . 
 What's wrong with it ? 
 Have you checked the connections on your computer ? 
 There are cords that connect your computer to a power outlet . 
 It won't turn on if the cords aren't connected . 
 Try it and see if it works . 
 It should work , but let me know if it doesn't . 
 I ’ m pretty tired . I haven ’ t been sleeping well . 
 I have enough time . I just can ’ t seem to fall asleep and stay asleep . 
 I don ’ t have one time in particular . I just go to sleep whenever I feel tired . 
 I just lost my job , and I am unsure about being able to find another one . 
 I haven ’ t ever tried that , but it sounds like a good idea . 
 I haven't gone to the interview yet . It's tomorrow . I am so nervous . 
 I hope so . 
 Thanks , I'll keep that in mind . 
 I'm pretty good , you ? 
 How long have you been on the bus ? 
 Do you catch this bus a lot ? 
 So , you have your own car ? 
 Then , why are you on the bus with me ? 
 That's good thinking . 
 Yes . I'd like to make a reservation to Los Angeles on Sep . 19th . 
 Yes , please , thank you . 
 You've drunk everything , sir ? 
 Do you want the whole minibar , or just certain items ? 
 That's three Jim Beams and three Perriers . Anything else , sir ? 
 Okay . Are you sure there isn't anything else ? 
 Be patient for just a few minutes , sir , and someone will be at your door . 
 Yes , I ’ m the manager here . What can I do for you , Madam ? 
 Which room are you in ? 
 I ’ m awfully sorry to hear that . ( After checking ) I ’ ll turn to it right away . I do apologize . We ’ ll change your room to 2002 . 
 It ’ s my pleasure , Madam . 
 Both are superb in their skills.Anyhow , Fred is one up on Bill from my point of view . 
 May I take your order ? 
 The baked fish in tomato sauce is pretty good . 
 Do you want some dessert ? 
 Single or double ? 
 Good morning , Sir . 
 Of course , Sir . What kind of currency would you like to deposit ? And what is the amount you would like to pay in ? 
 OK , Sir . Would that be Fixed or Current Deposit ? 
 And how long are you depositing for ? 
 Well , Mr . Brooks . I ’ m sorry , again , for the delay , but we should have everything completed by the time you get back . 
 Yes , sir . That ’ s more than enough time . I do appreciate your understanding . Why don ’ t we say 10:00 o ’ clock on the 27th ? 
 Would you like me to fill out the form ? 
 That's very kind of you . 
 Yes ma'am , may I help you ? 
 Yes ? 
 Oh , yes , ma'am . We'll come right away then.Your room number and your name , please . 
 Thank you.Would you hang up and wait ? 
 What are you doing ? 
 It looks like you are about to get dressed . Did you forget we are in a car on the road ? 
 Are you kidding ? You're going to cause an accident just from people gawking ! 
 That will be my pleasure . 
 sure . What kind of material do you want for the suit to be made from ? 
 that will probably be quite expensive , but the more you pay for the fabric , the longer it'll last and the better it'll look . What color do you want the suit to be ? 
 brown , huh ? Isn't that a bit dull ? 
 why don't you just get black ? Black suits are always fashionable and can be worn for anything — a funeral , a wedding , a job interview — anything ! 
 here are two different shades of brown . Which one do you prefer ? 
 how about this one ? 
 ok , let's go . 
 I am quite alive and energetic . I am a curious person , and I like to learn new things . 
 I am quite outgoing , I think . 
 I try to adapt myself . 
 Where are we ? Oh , here we are . So we drive to the A120 and turn left . 
 Oh yes ! Sorry ! Then we drive to the M11 motorway . 
 It ’ s only seven miles . We turn left to join the motorway and drive south . 
 That ’ s another 15 miles , so that ’ s 22 miles total so far . 
 Then we drive on the M25 . it turns south . When we reach exit 15 , we turn left and go west along the M4 . 
 The journey around the M25 is 33 miles and then 3 extra miles to get to the airport . So how many miles is that together ? 
 It shouldn ’ t take us very long to cover that distance . Remember that we can go quite fast on the motor way . 
 May I order , please ? 
 I would like sirloin steak and tomato salad . 
 Yes , blue Cheese please . 
 I have been doing quite well . As reach 90 % and Bs reach 100 % . And I ’ Ve been awarded Zu Jingle Scholarship two times . 
 Yes . To develop my knowledge , I studied Economics , Business Administration and Accounting through self-study . Nowadays , I have passed three courses on CPA . 
 Yes , I used to be the monitor of my class . 
 It ’ s a very important experience for me . First , it improved my organizing ability , and let me understand how to resolve a problem in the overall perspective instead of my own perspective . Second , it let me know how to cooperate in harmony with people who I like or dislike . 
 For the past 5 years , I have been in an Ericsson ( China ) Communication Co , Ltd . 
 My title was Project Manager . There were almost 100 people under my supervision . 
 Thank you . I'll just print out your receipt , and then you're free to go . Here you go ! 
 If you don't mind me asking , how did you enjoy your stay at New York Hotel ? 
 That's very honest of you . Rest assured that this hotel will have no insects next time . 
 sure . What do you want ? 
 really ? Why ? 
 and the holidays provided you a chance to think over all this and make a decision ? 
 absolutely . With your expertise and experience , you're clearly working below your pay grade . 
 this way , you'll earn more at the new work place . 
 that is to say , most IT professionals can get a pay rise more easily by changing a job than waiting for a rise . I'm wondering why IT companies are always willing to pay more to new employees instead 
 All right.Which kind do you prefer ? 
 That's fine . 
 Please put your name and address here . May I see your passport . 
 How would you like it ? 
 Ok , here you are . 
 OK , it so happened I want to buy one . 
 I think it ’ s good , and it suits me , because I'm not good at cooking . Is it expensive ? 
 We're supposed to check in at the Air China's counter 30 minutes before take-off , Joe . 
 Do we need to show our ID cards when checking in ? 
 What about our luggage ? 
 Are they going to frisk all the passengers ? 
 I need some flowers for my wife . It's her birthday . 
 How much are the roses ? 
 That sounds like a good deal . 
 I'll take a dozen . 
 No , the roses will be fine . 
 Mom , I'm starving . 
 My teacher had a sudden stomachache , so the class was cut shot . You ? 
 You are cooking at least two hours earlier than the usual . 
 Then it's for Dad , isn't it ? It's so unfair ! 
 What was that again ? 
 I'm sorry , I didn't know that . But I wanna help . 
 I'll get knee to knee with her . 
 I'm glad we came here . This is really delicious ! 
 Well , it's true I've never driven two hours just to get lunch.But really , I think it's worth it . 
 How do you mean " suffer " ? 
 Even in the winter ? 
 And even if it takes two hours , huh ? 
 Well , this really is delicious , I have to admit . I can understand better now why you and your friends are always whining . 
 I know . I can see that . This is what is called " dim sum , " right ? 
 So when you Chinese think of Chinatown , you mostly think of food . Is that right ? 
 And maybe we can go to a good Italian restaurant for dinner , after the museum.Chicago has some great Italian restaurants . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Alright , alright . I am happy to try more Chinese food.Will it be dim sum again ? 
 Taiwanese style ? Isn't dim sum Taiwanese style ? 
 I wonder if you can cook things this good . 
 Pam , where's the closest ATM ? 
 The big one or the small one ? 
 Yes . 
 Do you know if there's a convenience store around here ? 
 I really need to get some things before I leave . 
 Can I take the subway to get there ? 
 Won't that be expensive ? 
 Jane , we are going to have a board meeting next Friday . Will you please arrange it for me ? 
 Sure . Actually it's a routine board meeting . The things to be discussed are all written here . 
 Go ahead . It's for your reference . While you are at it , make me a special agenda and don't forget to have enough room at the side for notes . 
 Exactly . As I am supposed to the chair of the meeting , I don't want it to get out of control . 
 The conference room on the second floor , is that ok ? 
 Good , and please get some water , glasses and ash tray ready as well . 
 Definitely . The minutes have to be taken accurately . 
 Oh , that's easy . I will write you a list of their names . You can make a seating plan with the names and give each one a number . 
 Please tell us the exact time when the big fire broke out . 
 But we need the exact time . What time ? 
 Do you have any sales experience ? 
 What kind of work are you doing now ? 
 Where are you working ? 
 Hi , I need broadband for my computer . 
 That's a problem . My laptop has no Ethernet port , it's wireless only . 
 Go ahead . I'm all ears . 
 That's great ! How much is it ? 
 Okay . What about the other alternatives ? 
 Yes , that's the ticket ! And if I need to print something there ? 
 I really want to take a nap . I feel very sleepy today . 
 I fell asleep very late . It was almost two o ’ clock in the morning when I finally fell asleep . 
 You know how it is when you ’ re in a strange country . Everything is new , and you get tired and nervous sometimes . Then you worry about your family , about conditions back home , about your courses , about your money , about everything . I tried to fall asleep but I just had too much on my mind . 
 Anything is worth a try . But right now I really just want to find a quiet place to take a nap . 
 So fast ! Thank you . 
 Yes , you'd print out the address and telephone number of those guests from your computer , and then send those materials to each business worker . 
 By the way , to tell them try to persuade those new guests to cooperate with us . Because I found a biggest opponent from this post-trip . 
 OK , it's no anything . Do what you should do . 
 I think she is in her room putting a little something together for you to take to school with you . 
 I know , but she is going to miss you something awful . Have I told you how proud I am of you ? 
 I mean it . You have really shown us that you are prepared to take on the adult world . 
 We have great confidence in you . 
 Is that so ? I didn't know it . can I possibly borrow a jacket and a tie ? 
 Then we'll return to the hotel and come back , will you change the appointment ? 
 At 7 , please . 
 A party of 13 . 
 Stand back from the door , please . Let the passengers off . You can't get on until the other passengers get off . 
 One dollar . Drop it in the box . Move to the rear of the bus . There are plenty of seats in the rear . 
 That's right.Move along , please.There are more people waiting to get on.Move to the rear . 
 No , that's the number l that goes down Park Avenue.This is the number 2 . 
 It is.Get in.please.You ' re holding everyone up.You can't miss Washington Square Park . 
 It would be better if you watched out for yourself . I might forget . 
 I read or go swimming , go shopping , usually . I run or play tennis or do something else like those to get some exercises to keep fit . 
 I wouldn't call myself extroverted . Sometimes , I enjoy being by myself very much . But other times , I like sharing activities with others too , especially during these last few years . 
 I like almost all sports , and I enjoy both playing and watching . I especially like tennis and mountain climbing . 
 Well , I approach things very enthusiastically , I think , and I don't like to leave something half-done . It makes me nervous-I can't concentrate on something else until the first thing is finished . 
 You just ate . 
 There's no food left from dinner . 
 Do you know what kind of snack that you want ? 
 Why don't you make yourself a sandwich or something ? 
 A PB & J is pretty easy to make . 
 Knock yourself out . 
 Just a moment , I'm coming . ( ten minutes later ) . Now , what would you like ? 
 Yes , certainly . Here you are . 
 It's written in English too , in smaller print . There . 
 Right . ( five minutes later ) Now , what are you having ? 
 All right , but would you be so kind as to make up your mind soon ? We're very busy just now as you can see , sir . 
 Hi , this is Sharon in Mr . Reynolds ’ s office . One of your delivery men picked up a package here about an hour ago . 
 Well , it still hasn ’ t reached its destination . I wonder if you could track it down for us . Mr . Reynolds is a bit concerned . 
 We appreciate your efforts in promoting the sale of our clothes in the market of this city . But according to our record , your annual turnover is not too big , so I think it is premature for us to discuss the question of agency . 
 I mean to double the amount for your sales this year at least . 
 We know you have done a good job in building up these exports for us . However , our company has the regulation for the agency . 
 I am sorry to say that it's a little higher . Our agents in other areas usually get a 3 % to 6 % commission . 
 Our price is worked out according to the costing . A 20 % commission means an increase in our price . So , I'm afraid we have to decline your proposal of acting as our sole agent . 
 We ’ Ve got a lot of work to do now , but take your time over this project . We don ’ t want to make any mistakes . 
 That ’ s right . We ’ ll finish them just in time . The Macy project can wait for the time being . We need to spend several days on that project , but it isn ’ t due to be finished until the end of the month , so we have plenty of time to get it done . 
 I ’ m going to give everyone on the team an extra day off . Everyone deserves it . 
 That ’ s true . Right . I ’ m going back to the meeting . It ’ s been going on for hours and there ’ s no indication that it ’ ll end soon . 
 Good . I have to go right now . I really hope this meeting doesn ’ t last too long . 
 I ’ ll stop by if I have time later . Make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines . 
 Where did you get assigned to go this time around ? 
 Hong Kong again . I would like to go somewhere different for a change . 
 If you really want to learn , remind me when you get back from your business trip . 
 When do you leave ? 
 What bus can I catch to get to the Gold Line ? 
 I live in Altadena . 
 It goes to the Gold Line ? 
 What street do I go to to catch it ? 
 I had no idea that bus went to the station . 
 I'm glad you told me . 
 Can you skillfully operate the computer ? 
 What kind of software can you use ? 
 Do you have any certificates on computer ? 
 Any other certificates ? 
 Do you have any other special skills ? 
 Hello everyone , and welcome to our CPR for beginners course . First of all , does anyone know what CPR stands for ? 
 That ’ s right ! We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest . 
 Well , basically if your heart stops pumping blood , or your lungs stop pumping air , then we need to get them going again ! That ’ s when we have to apply this procedure . Let ’ s begin ! I need a volunteer . 
 Alright , come here and lay flat on your back . Let ’ s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . We must lift the person ’ s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs . Then we place our mouth over the other person ’ s mouth and blow air two or three times , like this . 
 Madam I ’ m not trying to kiss you ! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency . 
 As I was saying , we blow air through the mouth in this manner . Once this is done , we must try to get the heart going again . To do this , we place our hands over the person ’ s chest , and press down firmly two or three times . 
 Hello ? 
 No , not out of order . But we seem to have a bad connection on the phone line . I can ’ t hear you clearly . 
 Sure . Thanks . 
 Certainly . Here you are . It's a new arrival . 
 Sure . The fitting room is in the corner . 
 It says on the bottle here that you can have two refills . 
 Alright . I'm sorry , Miss . According to our file , this prescription has already been refilled twice . 
 Well , it looks like you have.You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription . 
 I'm sorry , Miss . We can't do it . We must follow the prescription.And this prescription has run out . 
 Miss , I understand your problem.But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription.It ' s the law . I can't do anything about it.We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . Never . 
 A prescription must be valid . It cannot be an expired prescription . I'm sorry , Miss . It's the law.You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you . 
 Miss , I just can't help you on this . I'm a pharmacist , not a doctor . And there are other customers I need to help now . I know it is frustrating when this happens.But there is nothing I can do about it . I'm sorry . 
 Maybe that's true . I don't know.But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too . 
 I don't want to . 
 Certainly not . 
 Turn on the TV , for what ? 
 Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ? 
 To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate it . 
 I'd like to buy some Chinese-style cakes . Could you recommend me some ? 
 Moon cakes ? What is that ? 
 Sounds very interesting . I'll buy some to family people . 
 What's the difference between these two styles ? 
 Get me some of each . 
 How would you comment on the paper ? 
 Don't you think it's a bit conservative ? 
 That's unfair , Mom . 
 Dad is bigger than you , but how come I'm smaller than May . 
 What should I do ? 
 Got it , Mom . 
 Mom , don't worry about me , I can do it . 
 OK . Bingo ! We win . Give me five , Mom . 
 Which subway should I take to get to the East Side ? 
 Which train is that ? Which platform does it leave from ? 
 Hi ! Does this hotel have an exercise facility ? 
 Good . Now exactly where is it ? 
 Is this going to cost me anything ? 
 When does the gym open and close ? 
 Very good . Now , is there a trainer down there ? 
 Can I help you ? 
 Ok , would you like a phone with camera and MP3 player ? 
 I guess you should know that you need to be hospitalized . 
 Now you can go to the in-patient department to go through the admission procedures . 
 It's hard to say . It depends on your recovery condition . But you need to stay for at least one day for observation . 
 Bye ! 
 Well done , Fred . Do you know something useful for our promotion for our I-series ? 
 That is a good idea to start with . I also think the mass media is also a good approach for advertising . 
 Waiter , come here please . Could we have a doggie bag ? 
 Hi , may I speak to Ryan , please ? 
 Hi , Ryan , this is Malia , and I will not be coming to work today . 
 I have really bad poison oak and can ’ t stop itching . 
 I ’ Ve had it a few days , but the rash really got bad last night . 
 I have some lotion that the doctor gave me , as well as an antihistamine . 
 Excuse me , you look lost.Can I help you ? 
 Right.Let me see.You go straight down here and turn right . 
 Then take the next left then the next right.Are you with me ? 
 I would like to talk to you , if you have time . 
 I want to discuss some things about my lease . 
 Can you tell me when my lease is up ? 
 If I ever decide to leave before the three years , will there be a problem ? 
 Why is that ? 
 Oh , I see . 
 Can I have my money back on this skirt ? 
 Yes , this is defective . See ? I didn't notice this hole when I bought it . 
 If you have exactly the same one-same color , same design , and same size , of course . 
 Hey , Philip ! You won ’ t believe this ! 
 My son , Harvey just got into Harvard ! He starts next September . 
 Good morning . How are you ? 
 Oh ? What are you worried about ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . Why do you think so ? 
 How do you sleep ? 
 Do you find it difficult to get to sleep , or do you wake up early ? 
 Are you worried about anything ? 
 I see . please take off your shirt and lie down on the couch . 
 Well , there's nothing very much wrong with you , I'm glad to say.You ' re working too hard and worrying too much.Do you take much exercise ? 
 I can , but I'm not going to . You don't need medicine . You need advice . Don't work so hard . Too much work is bad for you . Don't worry about your work.It ' s silly to worry . Take regular exercise . 
 Then get an easier one , even if you earn less money . Which would you rather have , health or wealth ? 
 Come and see me again in a month's time . I think you'll be a different man ! 
 Of course , Mr . Roberts . But , could you tell me his extension number again ? I haven ’ t got all the numbers down yet . 
 Thank you very much . Mr . Roberts . 
 Thanks , doctor . Is there anything I can take for this headache ? 
 Okay . 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 We open at lo 
 OK , now let's go on to talk about initial deposits . 
 For Agreement Savings , we ask for 100,000 RIB . 
 You can use a Type A Agreement Savings Account the same was as a Settlement Account . 
 With a Type B Account , it cannot be directly involved in any transaction and it cannot be applied to any external withdrawal service . 
 My daughter . She is missing . I don ’ t know where she is . 
 She has blond hair and blue eyes . 
 She has a yellow dress on and red sneakers . 
 I just saw her down the street . I don ’ t know where she is . I don ’ t know ... 
 Oh , it ’ s been uh ... fifteen minutes . 
 Pleased to see you . Welcome to our company . I hope you have a good day . 
 Sure , come with me . Hello , Michael , this is Steven . He will be part of your team . 
 I ’ Ve been looking forward to meeting you . I am new to the working world and would appreciate your guidance . 
 That's great . 
 All right . 
 I'm sorry , it was too cold , and my car couldn't start . I had one to the garage with the heater . I tried to call you , but you couldn't get connection . 
 Yes , your number is out of service . 
 So I couldn't get through . 
 Well , the only thing you can do is pay the fee to recover your service . 
 Well , as you know I was in Thailand last month , and I took a cooking class ! So I prepared some of my favorite dishes . 
 Ok , for starters we have Tom Yam soup . It's a bit spicy , but really good ! 
 Now this next dish is one of the most famous . Foreigners call it papaya salad but the proper name is Tom Sam . It is a spicy salad made from a mix of fresh vegetables including shredded unripened papaya and tomato . 
 Ok , now for the last and best dish in my opinion . This is called Pad Thai . It's stir-fried noodles with eggs , fish sauce , tamarind juice , red chili pepper plus bean sprouts , shrimp and tofu and garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander . It's practically Thailand's national dish ! 
 Want some more ? 
 Hey Michael . Where are you going ? 
 What for ? 
 Hey , I play basketball with a bunch of friends twice a week . It's great exercise and it's fun too . Why don't you come out and play with us ? 
 I have a problem . 
 My mattress was supposed to be delivered today . 
 The delivery people showed up four hours late . 
 I was late for work because of them . 
 I want my money back for the delivery . 
 It shouldn't be a problem . 
 Oh , I think I broke my leg . 
 Thanks . 
 All right . 
 James Taylor , 23 , March 30,1982 . 
 I don't have it . 
 I don't have health insurance . 
 Oh ! 
 Don't worry about that . 
 No trouble at all . 
 No , that's quite out of the question . 
 I never did like this MP4 anyway . I won't hear of it . 
 We have a fairly good working relationship , but there was also a rough spot . 
 Well , he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations . 
 I just went to bed . 
 I know , but that movie was just too good to leave . I guess I ’ ll just have to pay the price anti-sleepy . 
 No . why don ’ t we describe and buy at the coffee shop next door ? 
 Hi ! Someone has reported a fault on one of your copiers . 
 When was it serviced ? 
 What's actually wrong with it ? 
 I'm sure it's nothing serious , probably just a minor fault . I'll have a look at it . 
 Just take it easy . If he starts to bother you , let me know and I'll call security . 
 Don't get all worked up over him . He's probably harmless . 
 You never know . Maybe he's just an innocent , lonely guy ... 
 OK ! I'll call security . 
 I should be coming in on the 11:30 mooring flight . How far is the office from the airport ? 
 That ’ s right . I ’ ll be in the baggage area . 
 Right over here , sir . What size do you wear ? 
 These here are all mediums . 
 Shall I gift-wrap them for you , sir ? 
 Hello , Doctor . 
 It's nothing serious actually , doctor . It ’ s ... Well , I get tired very easily recently , and I often doze off during meetings , office hours and sometimes even while I'm dining . 
 About two months . I didn't pay much attention to it in the beginning , but you see , I got fired this morning . I dozed off while we were having an important meeting , right in front of the boss . I was very embarrassed . 
 Pretty good , I'd say . 
 No , doctor . I've actually put on two pounds . 
 Well , doctor ? 
 What examinations ? 
 Good afternoon , you look a little stuck . Can I help ? 
 I see . What is it exactly that you are interested in ? 
 Well , that all depends on how much you want to invest . 
 That's a nice round figure to deal with ! OK , if you were to buy this insurance policy , your yearly fixed income from it would be 94.35 RIB . 
 For the Savings Deposit you could actually get more . You see , in time deposit , the interest rate is 1.58 % after the 20 % interest tax . So , technically you could get more than a third more . 
 Name and examination number , please . 
 What part of the country do you come from ? 
 Where is it ? 
 Do you have a big family at your hometown ? 
 Are you married ? 
 Something's wrong with my computer . 
 All I get is a black screen . 
 I think I know , because this happened before . 
 My hard drive crashed . 
 It sure is , but I'm going to call HP first , just to make sure . 
 No , I always back up my files . 
 Hey , Taxi . Over here ! 
 Yes , are you engaged 
 I am going to the airport , and I have to catch the 930 flight to New York . 
 But I can't miss the flight . It's an important meeting and it ’ s waiting for me . 
 That's great . How much is it to the airport 
 Fine . Will you please help me with the luggage 
 Thanks very much . 
 Ok , let's hurry . 
 What is the highest goal of your company ? 
 Well , it is a really high target . 
 Do you have any idea why I pulled you over today ? 
 One of your brake lights is out . 
 I'm going to give you a ticket . 
 It's just a ticket . 
 The judge will let you know . 
 Of course . 
 Hi , did you call for an exterminator ? 
 What sort of pest are we dealing with ? 
 Well , there ’ s nothing we can ’ t handle . I ’ ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches , but the termites will be harder to get rid of . We will have to cover the entire house and fu 
 do you remember where you were for the terrorist attacks on 9-11 ? 
 I was at home with my parents in New York City . 
 I didn't see the crash itself , but I did see the smoke and everything afterwards from my parents ' apartment building . 
 no , we decided to stay in our apartment . With all the buses out of service and the underground trains at a halt , many people had no choice but to walk home . It was utter chaos . 
 yes , my uncle's firm had an office in one of the towers . 
 unfortunately , he wasn't able to evacuate in time . He ended up dying in the tower . 
 it was . The hijackers didn't have any respect for human life not even their own . 
 Is English acceptable for you ? 
 What's your name ? 
 What ’ s your nationality ? 
 What is your date of birth ? 
 And your occupation ? 
 What's your passport No . ? 
 Where do you live in China ? 
 You are suspected of smuggling . Do you understand your rights ? 
 Ok , sign here . 
 Yes . Ms . Gray . Is there something wrong ? 
 I ’ m sorry , Ms . Gray . I must have lost track of the time . I ’ ll get back to work , now . 
 Any particular decade ? 
 We had seven , but we sold one this morning . 
 You're in luck . Two of them have dancing figures . 
 Yes , that one is very nice . 
 I'm sorry , but you just have to take your chances . 
 Even if it doesn't work , it's a beautiful collectible . 
 Sure . Can we use it in Today Supermarket ? 
 I really don't know what to buy . 
 That's right . I know it must sound crazy to you , but we believe there will be fewer absences this way . 
 Right now , we have incentives encouraging employees to come to work as often as possible.But employees with colds and the flu are coming to work and infecting their colleagues . 
 That's right . If sick days were mandatory , sick people would stay home . We wouldn't have these company-wide epidemics . 
 Can you loan me fifty dollars until pay day ? 
 Thank you just the same . 
 No . Go to bed right now . 
 I am just looking , thank you ... Excuse me . Can you tell me where I can buy a pair of shoes ? 
 Thank you . 
 I just had a complete physical examination and passed with flying colors . 
 I understand that . 
 Yes , I once booked there . They give the immediate confirm information and flight information to both your mobile phone and e-mail . You can conveniently pay by credit card , so the whole transaction only takes a couple of minutes . They also provide e-tickets , meaning you don ’ t need to go to any office to pick an air ticket . You go to the airport directly and check in with your ID card . 
 Yes , therefore they are expanding the scope of their service . For example , hotels can be booked through the same site as well . 
 You need to get a car tag first . There's a one hundred Yuan deposit for the car tag . 
 Thank you . We'll bring the receipt up to your room when we get it . 
 Good morning , Mr . Yang . Thank you very much . Can I work now ? 
 I am sorry , I am just too excited and forget it . Can I look it through ? 
 Well , I am sorry that I have a question . There is no remuneration item in this agreement . Can you tell me something about it ? 
 But you didn ’ t tell me in the interview . 
 Okay , I can ’ t decide whether sign or not now . Can you give me some time to think it over ? 
 Yes . Thank you very much . Mr . Yang . 
 Pardon , where to , sir ? 
 All right . Hop in , please . 
 It usually takes about half an hour . 
 Yes . Moreover , since the street is heavy with traffic this time of day . I'm not sure we can make it . By the way , are you pressed for the time ? 
 OK . 
 Thank you . 
 No . It versa according to the distance , you can read from the meter . 
 ok , so what have you got in store for me tonight ? 
 what ? I don't understand . 
 Oh ! Ha-ha ! That's not what I mean when I said ' go Dutch ' ! 
 ' going Dutch ' means to split the bill , silly ! 
 I'm famished ! Let's get some grub ! 
 Me , too ! The chips here are so light and crispy . 
 I'll go get the chips . What do you want to drink ? 
 Hey Michael . Where are you going ? 
 What for ? 
 Hey , I play basketball with a bunch of friends twice a week . It's great exercise and it's fun too . Why don't you come out and play with us ? 
 Excuse me , but could you give me some change ? 
 I want to make a long distance phone call . 
 Hello , Is this EYE computers ? 
 Actually , I'm calling to complain about your service . The computer I bought last week is faulty . 
 Well , easily , It doesn't work . It doesn't even start probably . 
 I would like to open an account today . 
 I want to open a checking account . 
 How much is it ? 
 Is that all ? 
 What happens if I don ’ t meet that requirement ? 
 How much ? 
 Who is the next one ? 
 Give the mike to him . 
 Be quiet . He is singing . 
 So did I . 
 Yes , he sings wonderfully . 
 Hello , Miao Ping . It's that time again ; I want to convert my salary . You know , it's so annoying . I wish my company could just pay me in RIB . 
 Yes , I guess you are right . So , do you need my passport ? 
 Here you go . 
 Hello , this is Francis . 
 Today , I am busy all day long . 
 That ’ s not good for me at all.It ’ ll have to be another time . 
 I know . I am available from 1 PM to 4 PM on Friday afternoon . 
 See you . 
 Oh , yes . I often went on business trips in the past six years . 
 I speak English and French in addition to my mother tongue , Chinese . 
 My present monthly salary is $ 1,500 . 
 I think so . 
 Thank you . Mr . A , and I certainly hope the answer will be favorable . Goodbye . 
 Well , i want to go to the university flea market , they got times of books , DVDs , and a lot of nice clothing , too . 
 Good idea , let's shop to we drop ! 
 Yeah . There's an express that leaves in twenty minutes . 
 Sure . 
 Go to window number eleven . 
 Could you have a taxi pick me up and take me to the airport before 1 p . m . ? 
 I live at 323 Park Street . 
 What are your rates ? 
 I have four very large suitcases . Will those fit in the taxi ? 
 What kind of permanent would you like to have ? 
 Oh , we have quite a regular , cold perm , straight perm , pin curl and foam . 
 Hi , I am afraid that the fax machine in my room won ’ t be working till tomorrow . A technician has just come and checked it . He will bring me a new one tomorrow . It seems there is a big problem with mine and it will take some days for repairing . Can I use the one in your office ? 
 Yes , I think you have the same model as I have . Does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ? 
 Could you tell me how to use the washer and dryer ? 
 Do you know how to turn them on ? 
 I need change for the machines ? 
 So what do I need to do ? 
 That's really all I have to do ? 
 Thanks for all your help . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 How many carats diamond do you want ? 
 Is this one suit for you ? 
 What about this ? 
 Yes , try this one please . 
 3,500 yuan . 
 I am here to tell you that the clothes are very much to taste of our market and the customers are quite satisfied with the excellent quality . 
 Well , we have an extensive sales organization and a thorough knowledge of Asian market . Your products would sell very well here . We are prepared to do more business with you . We are also interested in handing a sole agent for you . 
 No problem . 
 That looks good . The room in the picture is bigger than your bedroom , so you wouldn ’ t be able to have all that furniture in your room . 
 You would fit both of them in your bedroom . Perhaps you could also get the dressing table . I think that one would look good in your bedroom . 
 Everything in this magazine seems expensive . You could probably find something similar in a discount store . 
 You can get cheap carpets easily . Another idea is to buy a rug . That would cover a lot of the carpet and you wouldn ’ t have to replace the carpet . It would save you a lot of work . 
 How much does it cost to hire a motorbike ? 
 Good . I think I'll hire one for 7 days . 
 Good afternoon , sir . May I help you ? 
 Would you like anything to drink with that ? 
 Will that be all ? 
 For here or to go ? 
 That'll be $ 4.25 ... ( The customer gives her a 5 dollar bill . ) ... out of five . Here is your change , sir . Have a nice day . 
 Well , not everyone wants to drink beer . Make sure there are some soft drinks and juice . Nothing ’ s as refreshing as iced drinks on a hot day . 
 Just buy a cask of wine . Have you bought ice yet ? 
 I think a bottle of champagne would be a good idea . It ’ s appetizing and tasty . 
 You have any ideas as to what you want to do this weekend ? 
 I'm not quite sure yet . 
 What movie are you and your friend planning on watching ? 
 No good movies come to mind . 
 No , thanks . Maybe another time . 
 There ’ s a big sale on clothes and sporting goods at Riverside Mall . 
 Yeah , it ’ s 30 percent off the regular price . 
 Yeah , it ’ s a couple weeks away , and we don ’ t have anything yet . 
 I know , I know , but if I didn ’ t buy it for him , he ’ d never buy it . 
 Well , all shoes are 20 percent off . 
 I know , but another pair can ’ t hurt . 
 Hello , Mr . Brown . 
 Yes , I'm here to fix your pipes . 
 You are going to be really jealous when you find out where I ’ m headed for the holidays ! 
 You got it ! I ’ m going to spend two fabulous weeks in Hawaii ! 
 Good morning , Japan Airline domestic reservations . Can I help you ? 
 The flight to Huston takes off daily every two hours from 6:00 to 11:00 pm . So you don't need a reservation . Seats are available on a ' first come , first served ' basis . 
 Now that we know what kind of music we will play , we have to decide what each of us will do . 
 Oh yeah ! I'm a great rapper . And I know all the Vanilla Ice lyrics by heart . 
 How are you ? 
 What can I do for you ? 
 You sure do . 
 You owe $ 235.13 in fees . 
 When will you be paying these fees off ? 
 Cash or check ? 
 Hello , this is Sunshine Trading Company . Can I help you ? 
 Great . Could you tell me something about cash control ? 
 I'm quite upset ! I want a new room and a refund for tonight . 
 I'm about to be swept away by millions of cockroaches ! 
 Thank you . I didn't want to have to take this to court . 
 Where do you see yourself three years from now ? 
 Good answer , Miss Zhang-good answer ! Seriously , though , are you interested in staying in a staff-level position , or would you hope to move into management someday ? 
 Fine . What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a boss and his or her employees ? 
 That man's really a bore to me . 
 The man with his hair cropped . 
 It's OK . 
 I observed the interviewer's manner , mien and gesture carefully besides paying attention to mine . 
 Of course . The manner of shaking hands can show a man ’ s character . For example , the interviewer who shakes your hand lightly , is a easygoing man although he looks cool . 
 You can discover interviewer's eyes because they can show his thoughts , and can judge whether he is interested in your words by his gesture and mien . 
 well , I ’ m very good with people . I ’ m honorable . I work hard . I work well under pressure . And I ’ m patient . 
 I like a person who works hard . I don ’ t like lazy people . 
 well , this is a challenging question . I suppose I would say that I ’ m a quick learner . 
 I think so . I think that I am good at what I do . 
 I ’ m not good at speaking in public . I feel uncomfortable when I speak in public . 
 Couldn't you extend the delivery period by two weeks ? That would make things much easier for us . 
 I can understand , but our company is fully committed at the moment , and hundreds of clients are placing orders for delivery these days . 
 What is your favorite coffee ? 
 All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ? 
 I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . Though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient . 
 I agree . I heard that in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ? 
 No , we don't , especially the elder people . But more and more young people fall for coffee nowadays . 
 I really want to get something to eat . 
 I don't know what I want to eat . 
 Chinese food sounds good . 
 I haven't the slightest idea . 
 You like Panda Express ? 
 Maybe I'll go there then . 
 Ann , stop bugging Jess and help me order something new . Lattes are so passe these days . 
 Sounds a little weak . 
 Sounds better , but I hope it doesn't inspire me to take a hammer to the client's head . 
 when do most children start school in your country ? 
 How much time do primary school students usually spend at school every day ? 
 do they have to go to school on Saturdays ? 
 how many subjects do they have to study ? 
 do students have to wear uniforms in schools in America ? 
 did you go to a public school or a private school ? 
 I went to a boarding school from nursery school to senior high school . 
 yes , they were horrible . We had to wear green every day ! 
 that's true ! 
 Certainly . As my colleague just mentioned , sustainability is a major concern when examining the potential output of a resource . Of course , as you can see from the content of our presentation today , with renewable resource , there is a much larger sustainability than with non-renewable resource . 
 Yes , here you are . These tablets are very effective . 
 Take two tablets every six hours . 
 And take a good rest for a few days . 
 Hello , sir . Is there anything I can help you find ? 
 Need a gift for your girlfriend or wife ? 
 Well , if you need anything , just ask . 
 It's on the third floor . Turn left when you get off the escalator . 
 You do ? I just bought this outfit a couple days ago . 
 I bought it from the Macy's at the Santa Anita mall . 
 Thanks . I think you look nice today , too . 
 Those are nice . What are they ? 
 Those are great . How much were they ? 
 I think I might go and find me my own pair of Chucks . 
 Thank you . I am glad that everything turned out so well . 
 I took a cooking class at the Culinary Institute . 
 Isn't that great ? That is coconut ginger chicken with rice . 
 Yes , there is shrimp in there along with sea vegetables and lemon grass . 
 I appreciate you bringing the wine . It goes well with the chicken . 
 Yes , I have , sir . How long are you going on vacation ? 
 I recommend you this route . We call it golden routes for the sightseeing spots . 
 Of course , we will , sir . 
 Yes , on Monday . 
 I'm probably going to spend the day looking at cars . 
 Yes , I am . I'd like to be able to get around a little more . 
 Oh , I don't know.Of course , gasoline costs a lot these days . 
 A lot of people do . I'll try it for a while anyway , but I certainly don't want to pay a lot of parking tickets . 
 I don't think so . I'm just shaken up a little . 
 No , don't bother . I think I'm OK . 
 Yes , it's OK . 
 Yes . I booked a single room in your hotel for this Friday . But I ’ m sorry to say that I have to cancel it . My wife is very sick now . I don ’ t think she ’ ll be able to travel by this Friday . 
 Thank you . Can I cancel my reservation ? 
 My name is Tom Smith . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Good evening Ms . Jackson . Fancy meeting ’ you here . 
 Clyde Smith . Pleasure to meet you . May I treat you ladies to dinner ? 
 You weren't going to tell her about chitterlings and hog maws , were you ? Well , my Creole ancestors never ate that stuff . We have refined French tastes . 
 Hello ! Can I help you ? 
 Oh , it's the high time for you purchasing in our clothes shop . We are now having a preseason sale on all our winter apparel . 
 Every thing for winter is 20 % off . 
 Sure , we have both skirts and trousers that would look well with the sweater . Look at this section . 
 You have a good taste . It's very much in style this year . 
 Look on the rack to the right . 
 It's ok . 
 Here you are . 
 China . 
 I just work there . 
 I'm here on vacation . 
 Almost three weeks . 
 Oh , I'm sorry , but there are a couple of different places I will travel to within the United States , so I wasn't sure what to put . 
 Ok , here you are . 
 Yes . I have some travellers cheques and two credit cards . 
 Nope . I only have my clothes and camera ! 
 Hello , what can I do for you ? 
 Give me your water and electricity bills , please . 
 You should pay 160 yuan for the electricity fee and 80 yuan for the water fee . 
 Yes . Will you pay by cash or credit card ? 
 I get 250 yuan from you , and this is the change , 10 yuan . 
 Bye . 
 Yes , I'd like to exchange some US dollars into RIB . 
 What's the exchange rate for RIB ? 
 I'd like to exchange 3,000 . 
 Yes . Here you are . 
 All right , thank you so much , good-bye . 
 Why don't we get you some shirts ? 
 But we should get you some shirts while we're here . You need summer shirts . 
 Why ? They have everything here . 
 Let's just look and see what they have . 
 What about these shirts ? Do you see anything you like ? 
 Oh , come on ! Don't be so sour . These are beautiful shirts . I know if we don't buy some today , you will never go shopping by yourself . 
 Here . Look at this shirt . Try it on . 
 I don't know . Let me look on the rack . Here is one . LARGE . Try it on . 
 The fitting rooms are over there . 
 It looks good on you . 
 No , it looks great.Why are you always like this when you're shopping ? You know it looks good . 
 I think we'll buy this one . And I want you to try on this one too . 
 You should be happy I want you to look good.If I let you shop for yourself , you would never buy anything . 
 I need to know why I'm being charged $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered . 
 Monday night ? Monday night I was at a great concert . 
 Thank you . It's very nice when problems can be solved quickly . 
 Are you crazy ? You made the mistake and now you're charging me for your mistake ? 
 Why don't you just stick a gun in my ribs and take everything I have ? 
 Good morning . I've come here to inquire whether I can get a visa to your country ? 
 I have been invited to teach Chinese at the University of Hawaii for two years . 
 Of course . Here you are . 
 Good morning , may I help you ? 
 That's a beautiful city . When do you want to go there ? 
 Then please have a look at the table , there are so many plans . 
 What's wrong with it ? 
 Can you tell me what the charge was ? 
 Are you positive that you didn't buy the purse ? 
 I'm very sorry . When was this purchase made ? 
 We're going to investigate this claim . 
 You won't have to pay for anything . 
 Well , the pulp falls from a box onto the first part of the paper machine , which is basically a wire bed with large holes in it , where most of the water is extracted . 
 Yes , it is . But we need to take out more water . So it then passes through a series of rollers , where more water is squeezed out . After that it goes through the dryers , which are at a very high temperature . The paper is then coated . And finally it's wound onto reels and cut down into smaller lengths . 
 Do you know how many you need ? 
 We can get started as soon as you fill out this form . 
 You won't be able to tell the difference with a magnifying glass . 
 Very good . You can pick up your order in one week . 
 We can do that , but you'll have to pay a little extra . 
 When will you set out ? 
 OK . There is one on Wednesday . 
 Eight hundred yuan . 
 No . It doesn't . But it includes all other on board activities . 
 Have you made a reservation ? 
 We have had a window table reserved for you . This way , please . 
 You're welcome . 
 I'll bring it over . 
 We have squirrel shaped mandarin fish , seeds prawn , etc . 
 Hello , Mr Kowalski ? 
 Which city are you staying in right now ? And the name of your hotel ? 
 Do you have your passport with you ? Or do you by any chance know the number ? 
 Let me repeat that back to you , 16211469 9 . That's just what I've done , Mr Kowalski , I've stopped your card temporarily . 
 You can go to any branch of IBA and request the Emergency Assistance Service . Everything will be taken care of , there's no need to worry . 
 I enjoyed talking to you . 
 We should hang out some time . 
 Is there anything you would like to do next time ? 
 I'd like that . 
 I'm going to call you soon . 
 See you soon . 
 I love Chinese food . 
 Well , I always order fried spring rolls when I go to Chinatown . 
 Really ? But they're delicious ! 
 That sounds great . 
 How much are these apples ? 
 Do you accept coupons ? 
 Here are my coupons . Is that enough ? 
 Hi . I'm looking for some good deals on produce . 
 Can you describe a mango to me ? 
 Do I eat the seed ? 
 What's the price of these mangoes ? 
 Tell me what they taste like . 
 Do I need to buy them ripe , or will they ripen at home ? 
 Where do mangoes come from ? 
 Mom , are those tattoos on your brows ? 
 Moooooommmmm ! You're so in ! Anything else you've been keeping from me ? 
 Any body piercing ? Stick out your tongue ! 
 Come on mom . I'm your A ! Wait till the guys hear about this ! 
 Can I see the paper when you're through , Sally ? 
 Take your time . 
 Fully agree . I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel . The latest office equipment is more type-functional . It combines fax machine , copy machine and printer in one . It saves a lot of place , one machine instead of three . 
 When will we get one of those ? 
 Excuse me . What time does the next bus for Boston leave ? 
 I see . Are there any seats available ? 
 Good . How much is a one-way ticket ? 
 All right . Here's 40 dollars . 
 Thank you . Which gate should I go to for the bus ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Are you free next thursday ? 
 A bunch of us in the office are planning a retiring party for Bob , he's been with the office for ages , so everyone was really surprised to hear he took early retirement . 
 Retirement age is still 65 , but I think more and more people are retiring earlier , I think Bob's in upper fifties already , he just looks pretty young . 
 Well , I think you prepare it well and capture good savings , retiring early can give you a lot more time for travel and other activities , you should get out and enjoy the life you still can't , don't you think ? 
 I'm just looking . 
 Thank you . 
 I don't like it very much.But every-body likes their own food best . 
 Are you sure ? All the big cities have specialty shops , which sell all sorts of ethnic foods . 
 Where can I get a good novel ? 
 What are in this folder ? 
 Are they filed alphabetically ? 
 Can you find last month ’ s report for me , please ? 
 Will you bring our bill , please ? 
 Thanks.Let me see . I think there's a mistake on the bill here.Would you mind checking , please ? 
 How about tax and service charge ? 
 Then one hundred U . S . dollars covers everything , doesn't it ? 
 What's going on here ? 
 Why are you climbing through the window and not leaving by the front door ? 
 Just a minute you two . I don't think you're telling me the truth . This isn't poorhouse , is it ? 
 Is he at home ? 
 What's Ron Marston like , Pauline ? 
 What did your boss say to him ? 
 Did he telephone again last night ? 
 What did you say to him ? 
 Did he telephone again ? 
 Does this bus really go to the mall ? 
 Are you sure ? 
 How long does it take for the bus to get there ? 
 Where do we get off the bus ? 
 The stop is really at the mall ? 
 That's perfect . 
 I really need to find a bus that goes by PCC . 
 All the way up on Las Flores Drive and Fair Oaks . 
 Walking isn't a problem for me . 
 Which direction do I want ? 
 Do you know where I get off at ? 
 Thanks for letting me know , home-girl . 
 Mr . Chandler will be our new partner , so his visit this time will be extremely important for our cooperation in future , because it may decide whether Mr . Chandler sign the trade contract with us or not . Do you have some idea ? 
 En , you are right , and he will trust us and maybe the contract will be signed soon . But remember to keep some skills of our manufacturing secret . On one hand , show his our best side ; on the other hand , do not show too much to protect our own business secrets . 
 Please make a detailed schedule on the visit this afternoon . 
 Nothing but the best , Cinnamon toast . 
 Why the drama ? Have you been watching soap operas ? 
 Brings back memories ? 
 I had planned to . I can bring some from my place . And there's some more at my parents ' . 
 Of course , I have . There is one in my old house . And I have another one from college at my parents ' house . 
 Yeah , it is a good idea . You can stay in my house for the night if you would like to . 
 Sure , but I don't have hot water , yet . 
 No , they're coming tomorrow morning to turn the gas on . My phone should be working then , too . 
 Yeah , I can't cook anything until tomorrow , anyway . Let's go to the restaurant nearby . It's my treat . 
 Please tell us the exact time when the big fire broke out . 
 But we need the exact time . What time ? 
 Where's the nearest bank ? 
 Broadway Mall is having a big sale this weekend . You wanna go ? 
 Well , we can still do some window shopping , can't we ? 
 I'll go myself then . 
 I'd rather say it's confusing . what are those " strict nutrition philosophies " about ? 
 Probably , Iris . That must be the job of nutritionists . 
 Oh , believe it or not , I came across an article the other day , saying that pizza is a healthy food . 
 Yes , I felt exactly the same way as you did just now . Scientists must be crazy in saying so . 
 Absolutely . I myself sometimes believe that healthy eating is just about feeling great . As long as I have enough energy , it's fine . 
 Who wants to go first ? Lily ? 
 OK.Put on something by the Backstreet Boys ! 
 I'd better not . Brooke hates the Backstreet Boys ! 
 Thank you . I can't imagine the design of the new computer is so popular among computer users . 
 I am flattered . But I am not sure whether the manager is satisfied with it . She asked me to her office . 
 I feel nervous when I face her . She looks so serious when we have a conversation all the time . 
 It is said that the sales for the new computer did not meet the expectation . 
 I'm still nervous . I don't know what to say to the manager . I always feel ill at ease in that kind of place . 
 Can I help you , Miss ? 
 OK , tell me your friend's name . 
 I am not sure what to do to get ready for my job interview . 
 No , I probably need to do some more research . 
 I think that their attitude is rather casual . 
 I have absolutely nothing so far . 
 Yes , where should we go from here ? 
 What can I do for you , madam ? 
 How about this one ? 
 They're three hundred dollars . 
 OK , This one is one hundred and twenty.It ' s the cheapest here . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Frans Smith ? I think you may have the wrong number . 
 It is . But there is no Frans Smith here . Do you know which department he works in ? 
 The accounts department , no problem . I'm just putting you through now . 
 I found it a garage sale once . 
 Well , because I like you ... ninety bucks . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 They're in Aisle Two . 
 Is your boss coming by ? 
 Okay . Get back to your work , and call me back this evening . 
 Bye ! 
 Wait a minute . I think we have missed an important point . We should include an arbitration clause in the contract . 
 I hope so . too . But I still think the provision of arbitration is of great importance to both of us . 
 I suggest the arbitration be held in a third country . 
 Ok . 
 It's a ETV palace ! I'm glad I brought my platinum card . 
 Where is Stanley ? It was his idea to have the bachelor's party at a ETV , wasn't it ? 
 Then I bet he's really good ! 
 How nice these sunglasses are ! 
 I want to try on this pair . 
 That's right . 
 I agree , how much ? 
 It's not expensive . OK . I'll take them . 
 Do you have an appointment , Mr . Liu ? 
 Mr . Thomas is quite busy , I ’ m afraid he won ’ t be able to see you today . 
 Have a seat please while I call . 
 How did you do on your driving test ? 
 That's great and it was your first try . 
 What did I do ? I haven't done anything . 
 What do you mean ? 
 I didn't do anything . 
 No , I didn't . I'm innocent . Those aren't mine . Whatever you found is someone else's stuff . You can't prove anything . I wasn't there when you went in , and you can't prove it's my stuff . 
 I don't need your help , jerk . 
 I know that you are interested in our washers . 
 We supply washers of all types and sizes . We have years of experience in the manufacture of washers . 
 Our prices compare favorably with those offered by other manufactures either in Europe or anywhere else . Here are our latest price lists . You will see that our prices are very attractive . 
 Sure , we do . 
 As a rule , we deliver all our orders within three months after receipt of relevant L / C . It takes longer , of course , for special orders . In no case would it take longer than six months . 
 Okay . No problem . 
 6 500 yuan . You will get it on the price tag . 
 Its already very cheap . Let's make it 6 000 yuan . 
 Hum ... I say 5 500 yuan . That's as cheap as it can get . 
 I'm sorry , this is our rock bottom price . 
 Hi , excuse me . I am sorry to bug you , but do you know where the Royal Hotel is ? 
 Well , I seem to be a little bit lost here . I am worried that I ’ ll never find my way . What's worse . I forgot my glasses and as blind as a bat now . 
 I am trying to get to the Royal Hotel . Do you know where that is ? 
 Great . Are there any landmarks nearby ? 
 Oh , that's good . I should be able to find it pretty easily then . Is that far from here ? 
 Oh , that will take too long and I am kind of in a hurry . Can I take a bus there ? 
 All right . I guess I'll take a taxi then . How long will it take by taxi ? 
 Cool , thanks . 
 Are you ready to order , sir ? 
 Of course . Here you are . 
 Our seafood is fresh . I recommend shrimp with garlic . 
 Mr . Emory ? I ’ d appreciate it if you would look over these letters before you leave today . 
 Thank you , sir . I ’ ll leave them here . If there are no problems , I ’ ll mail them out this afternoon . 
 Hang out the clothes . 
 we'd like to rent a flat near the university . 
 yes , we are . obviously , we'd like something as cheap as possible . we've heard that there are places for 80 to 100 pounds a month . 
 net really , no . we'd preferably like to live in a quiet street . 
 we'll need two bedrooms . the kitchen and dining room can be separate or combined . 
 how far away is it from the campus ? 
 that sounds ideal . can we go to have a look at it ? we'd like to see it before making a final decision . 
 thank you . that would be great . 
 You are just a little bit chubby , not paunchy . 
 More physical exercise may help to keep your weight down . 
 May I speak to Mr . Thomas ? 
 I hate to trouble of you . But it is urgent . Please leave this message into him 
 Did you even bother to go to school today ? 
 No , I didn't feel like it . 
 No , but that was a random change of subject . 
 I haven't lately . 
 So then , why don't you just go ? 
 Okay , so are you going to school tomorrow ? 
 The bartender just gave the last call . Let's order another round , okay ? 
 That sounds good . You order the beer while I go to the bathroom . Where is the can in this place ? 
 Yeah . I think I can find it . 
 That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around . That bathroom is too gross for me . 
 Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air , anyway . 
 May I have the menu , please ? 
 Could I have a few more minutes ? 
 Oh great ! This stupid computer froze again ! That's the third time today ! Hey Samuel , can you come take a look at my PC ? It's acting again . It must have a virus or something . 
 But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing the internet , I have no idea how I could have picked a virus . 
 Ok . Anything else ? 
 Um yeah.Sorry about that . 
 OK , sir . How many people are there in your party ? 
 Of course . 
 It ’ s not my fault . Daniel always sends things flying . 
 Yes . I have been a data entry operator for three years . 
 I have working knowledge of Windows and Dos . Actually , I'm quite familiar with both Java and C + + Programming Languages . 
 Yes , I have an ACRE certificate , Bank 2 . 
 I'm sorry to say I'm not familiar with processing management information , but I'm sure I could learn quite quickly . It can't be too difficult , and I've got a quick mind . I can handle any problem you give me . 
 Tell me about it . If I was as small as her , I wouldn't think about going on a diet . 
 That's because you don't exercise . If you were more active , you wouldn't have a dieting problem . 
 I'm not on a diet though . 
 I like ice cream too much though . 
 It does sound appealing . 
 Okay . I'm in . Let's do it . 
 Can we start tomorrow though ? 
 Yes , it is . What can I do for you ? 
 Are they urgent , please ? 
 Well , DHL is famous for its speed and reliability . It is the fastest international postal service available . The document will arrive in two or three days . 
 Yes , I promise . Your document won't be broken or lost . All the items are handled by special staff and carried by a courier . It is reliable . 
 Please write the address and remittee on the express order and make sure there is no mistake on them . 
 This is your receipt which you have to keep until the remittee receives the express . You can also check your post on our web . The post number is on the top of the receipt . 
 Excuse me , sir . 
 I heard that we will call at some ports on the way . Is that true ? 
 Where will we call at ? 
 Dalian is my hometown . 
 Can I get off the ship and walk around ? 
 Jodi , I must get a hold of Jim today , but I forgot his address and phone number . 
 Really ? You ’ Ve helped me a lot . Thank you . 
 Does this TV work well ? 
 Is it a color TV or a black and white TV ? 
 I came in response to your advertisement for a salesperson . 
 My name is Woody . 
 Because I admire your company . Yours is one of the most effective and respectable companies in this city . 
 Yes , five years ago . I began to work in a fashion company in Shanghai . Two years ago , I came to Beijing , and worked in a department store as a salesman . 
 Thanks . 
 Yeah , I don ’ t have to pay for a space on the street . 
 Well , last night it took me half an hour to find a spot when I came home from work . 
 Yeah , around seven . Most of the street parking is gone by then . 
 Yeah . I can live with it . It ’ s great to be living alone . 
 Fair to middling . A little hard to appreciate . 
 You see , I have these Euros , and of course they are of no use to me at the moment . So I'd like to save them in my account , but I'm not sure how to go about it . 
 I see . What's the interest like on those ? 
 Yes , I couldn't agree with you more . A 1 year time deposit it is ! 
 You're welcome . 
 Well here . Help yourself to some shrimp . It's fresh . 
 We are interested in this field . 
 Good morning , Mr Wang . 
 It's just nine o'clock . 
 Yes , you're on time . Are you often late ? 
 You must leave home earlier today . 
 Why are you so early today ? 
 What can I do for you ? 
 Are you depositing cash or a check ? 
 Please sign the back of the check . 
 Do you want cash back ? 
 How much cash would you like ? 
 Here ’ s your $ 150 . 
 When do you plan to deliver the goods ? 
 Please pay close attention to the safety of the shipment . 
 May I ask you a few questions about insurance ? 
 Now we've given a CIF Shanghai price for some steel plates . What insurance rate do you suggest we should get ? 
 Why not ? 
 Then am I right in understanding that FPA doesn't cover partial loss for the nature of particular average . 
 Are there any other clauses in marine policies ? 
 Well , thank you very much for all that information . Could you give me a quotation for my consignment now ? 
 Yes . My customer is in urgent need of the steel plates . 
 Thank you . 
 Certainly . ( Take a table-cloth to her ) 
 A table-cloth of this size and style is 15 Yuan . 
 If you take good care of it , it will last you quite a number of years . 
 I need help finding a gift for my daughter . 
 That sounds like a good idea . 
 She mentioned a Mac . How much is it ? 
 That sounds like a great price . I'll take one . 
 I'll use my VISA . 
 Just take it home and plug it in ? 
 She's going to be so pleased with this . 
 Hi there ! My name ’ s Terry Graham . You ’ re new around here , huh ? 
 Well , if there ’ s anything I can do for you , let me know . 
 Union Bank . How can I be of service ? 
 I'll need your name and account number . 
 You look upset.What ' s wrong ? 
 Maybe you need a vacation or something , or maybe a bonus . 
 Why don't you talk to your boss about it ? If you talk to him , he will surely understand . 
 What type do you have in your mind ? 
 Thirty dollars a day . 
 No , you have to pay it by yourself . 
 That's good to hear . You've had an ideal recovery from your operation . We're going to send you home tomorrow . 
 Don't be in such a hurry . I'm confident that you'll be completely recovered in 4 to 6 weeks . 
 You'd better have a good rest for a week . Be sure to have regular meals . Stay away from alcohol . Give up smoking at least a little while . 
 Yes . I'm going to give you some . Take one tablet of this medicine three times a day before meals . For that one , two tablets . And remember to come to the outpatient department for a consultation in two weeks , please . 
 You're welcome . We wish you a speedy recovery . Goodbye . 
 Yes . I have no plans . 
 Yes , that sounds wonderful . 
 But wait , wait , will there be food that is not meat ? You know . I'm a vegetarian 
 The other day , I decided that I needed to loose more weight so I am going to try to be a vegetarian . And you know what ? I don't miss the taste of meat . 
 Yes , it really is . After having vegetarian diet . I have much more energy , I need less sleep , I feel calmer . I can maintain an ideal body weight without worrying about how much I eat and I can think more clearly . 
 Yes , maybe . But I feel better since becoming a vegetarian . Maybe you could also have a try . 
 Maybe you would change your mind after having a vegetarian diet . 
 Do you know that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes ? 
 Excellent ! Now , as you know , the day has barely begun . 
 I want to hit a few more places in the city , but I need a place to put my luggage . 
 Leave a deposit ? Isn't leaving the luggage enough of a deposit ? 
 Hmm . I'll have to think about this for a second . 
 Hi , waiting for the bus ? Where are you going ? 
 Why don't you take a taxi ? It'll get you there much faster . 
 I'm checking out tomorrow . What time must I vacate the room ? 
 I see . Thank you . 
 Sure , company rules are not very strict at this point . 
 But remind you , there are some forbidden activities . 
 Don ’ t use office phones for personal matters . 
 Never ever come to work drunk , also smoking in the office is not allowed . 
 Hey , Mom , look what I found ! 
 Are you doing the football pools , Brian ? 
 You always say that , but we never win anything ! What will you do if you win a lot of money ? 
 I don ’ t want a mink coat ! I want to see the world . 
 But if we spend all that money we shall be poor again . What will we do then ? 
 It ’ s a pleasant dream , but everything depends on if ! 
 Just a moment , I'm coming . ( ten minutes later ) . Now , what would you like ? 
 Yes , certainly.Here you are . 
 It's written in English too , in smaller print.There . 
 Right . ( five minutes later ) Now , what are you having ? 
 All right , but would you be so kind as to make up your mind soon ? We're very busy just now as you can see , sir . 
 I want to check in . 
 No , I want a double room . By the way , is there any discount for children ? 
 Ok , please have me arrange one . 
 I usually just have a bowl of cereal . 
 Yeah , but I don't usually have time to eat a big breakfast . 
 What do you make ? 
 That sounds pretty good . 
 That is a very quick meal to make . 
 Oatmeal and toast sounds good to me . 
 Hello , Mr . Jones , its ... 
 Ei , OK , er .. Fred . Thank you for seeing me today . 
 Well , I ... I guess the weather . And the people . They were all very friendly to me . 
 Yes , I am . I was born here , and still live with my parents in the same house . 
 Good morning , Maintenance Department . 
 Which air conditioner ? 
 What seems to be the problem ? 
 May I have your room number , please ? 
 OK , we'll send someone up to check it . 
 Fine . The housekeeper will open the door and stay in the room with the repairmen . 
 Yes , I'm looking for Bob . 
 No problem , I can wait . 
 Yes , Ms . Ross ? What do you need ? 
 Good news ! I ’ ll be glad to . When do you need it ? 
 Hi . I would like to get an internet plan for my house . 
 I have no idea what kbps means . I just want to be able to get online , play games and chat with my friends . Oh , and watch movies online as well . 
 Do I have to pay an installation fee ? 
 Awesome ! 
 Hi , Sandy . It ’ s Walter Knight . I need to book some time with Mr . Crane . 
 Can you see what his schedule is like on Wednesday ? 
 For the past 3 years , I have been working in China East Airlines Corporation Limited . I'm very tolerant of people and have been told that this is one of my strengths . I feel I have a lot to offer as a team member . 
 It's always been my dream to be a stewardess . And I like travelling to different places . 
 Well , a stewardess should be friendly , courteous , patient and treat passengers kindly and politely . 
 No , I know how to control my temper . 
 I would give him or her basic first aid and ask my partner to call for assistance at the same time . 
 I can begin to work right away because I am out of work now . 
 I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . I'd like to postpone that discussion until later . Maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position and how your commission structure works . 
 For a batch of 6,000 we would charge two dollars a doll . your total cost would be $ 12,000 . 
 Well , we ’ d like to work with you . If you ordered a larger quantity we could drop the price a little . Can you increase your order to 15,000 ? 
 For order of 12,000 or more we charge only $ 1.5 a doll . your total cost would be $ 18,000 . 
 We do value your business . I think I can offer a further discount – say 5 % ? 
 I'm here to open a Current Account with your bank . 
 Here you go . Is there a minimum amount I need to pay in ? 
 OK , how long does it need to be ? I'm not very good with remembering long numbers . 
 Hello , so how are we feeling today ? 
 Am I correct in thinking that you are here for your annual physical ? 
 Your basic physical exam will include lungs , heart , blood levels , and eyes , ears , and nose . 
 We can do an allergy test , and later I can send you for an asthma test . 
 I am going to check your cholesterol , blood sugar , and white blood cell count . 
 Is anybody here ? 
 Quite a lot . I need one pound of potatoes , three pints of milk , a dozen eggs and one pound of tomatoes . 
 How much are the lemons ? 
 Give me a dozen lemons . 
 No , thanks . How much in total ? 
 I am glad to meet you , Mr.Joey . 
 That is excellent , your investment proposal is a wise decision . May I have some idea of your suggestion ? 
 Excuse me , do you know the shortcut to the Lincoln park ? 
 Thank you very much . Is the back gate open now ? 
 Can you show me some jade , please ? 
 No , but I do like jade bracelets . 
 Thank you . ( A moment later ) Oh , this one is quite impressive . I'll take it . By the way , do you sell pearl earrings ? 
 I wonder which looks more lustrous . 
 Oh , I see . I think I prefer a natural one . 
 I am sure you will find our prices are most competitive . Here is our offer . All the prices on the list are firm . If your order is a sizeable one , we could reconsider our prices . 
 As a rule , we don't allow any commission . However , as an encouragement for businesses , we will allow you a 3 % commission . 
 By the coming September . 
 Certainly ! 
 Don't you have any luggage to check in ? 
 Do you have a seat preference ? 
 Here is your boarding pass . Have a nice day . 
 Is it urgent ? Would you like the express service ? 
 Hello . I want to reconfirm our flight to London . 
 Yes , I did . But I couldn't communicate with them in English.They speak only Spanish.So I need your help . 
 We are taking IB 385 to London tomorrow at 1 p . m . 
 Mary , it seems that your family and friends have been calling you recently , am I right ? 
 What do they say ? 
 Really ? What jobs are they ? 
 It's great ! 
 This is a good opportunity . 
 You can give it a try ! May be you will succeed . 
 If you have any good jobs , keep an eye for me ! 
 Daddy , I love this Happy Farmhouse . It's really fun . 
 But you are holding it for me . Nothing to worry about . I trust you . Oops , what's that ? 
 What would happen if they started attacking you ? 
 I see . Why do people come all the way here to pick apples by themselves and take them home ? Isn't it easier for them to buy the apples in the supermarket ? 
 Come on , daddy . You can see that people only pick the red ones . 
 Oh , then what would happen if there were pests ? 
 Cool ! Well , let's go over there to join mom . I want to tell her all about the special pests-killing method . 
 Here you are . 
 I want to check these three pieces and I'll carry this overnight bag by myself . 
 Well , then , how much do I owe you ? 
 Can your dog do any tricks ? 
 I wish I had a dog . My cat can't do any tricks . 
 So who takes care of him then ? 
 I can't do that with my cat . She hates water . 
 Mm , they taste delicious . Let's settle the bill . 
 No . It's on me this time . 
 Have you a garment ? 
 Show me the black one , my size . 
 Well , I don't think it matches my jeans.Can you give me some advice ? 
 Very well . You will need some stamps for the postcards and I need to weigh that package , too . 
 Well , it depends . Do you want to send it via priority , express or standard mail ? 
 Well , standard mail can take up to fifteen working days . Priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days . Express is the fastest , but it ’ s also the most expensive . It only takes three days and you can track your package online . 
 May I ask who's the manager ? 
 I've something urgent to tell you . 
 Lily ! Why aren't you up and ready for school ? 
 Lily , if you're acting sick just because you want to play hooky ... 
 Oh , that's a nasty cough . Let me feel your head . You're on fire ! 
 Well , how long will it be ? 
 OK . We'll wait . 
 Sure . Where do you want to go ? Are you in the mood for anything in particular ? 
 Dumplings again ? ! Oh , Amy , let's try something new ! 
 How about the Mongolian hot pot ? 
 Maybe we can try ' Yuanyang pot ' this time . You can choose the non-spicy soup base . 
 Yes . The sliced noodles they offer are among the most authentic Shanti cuisines . 
 Wait a minute . Let me throw on a sweater . 
 I like feature films best . How about you ? 
 I always like to see the oldies , like The Sound of Music , Gone with the Wind . They are realty the best - in the acting , the scene and the plot . 
 Excuse me . What's the time difference between Beijing and San Francisco ? 
 Are we losing or gaining a day on the way to America ? 
 So does it mean we're arriving on the same day ? 
 Hey Mel ! Are you up for some tennis today ? 
 You sound exhausted . Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out ! She can pick the kids up and take them to their after-school activities . She can also help you do some household chores , and run some errands . 
 I think you should definitely consider it ! This way you won ’ t have to juggle such a busy schedule , and you ’ ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings . I can refer you this great nanny Amy . She used to work for my neighbors , before they moved away . She ’ s very responsible , a good cook , and great with kids . 
 Have you had enough time to look over the menu ? 
 Let me remind you of the specials of the day , which are posted on the board . 
 Yes , we would be happy to prepare the food to meet your special needs . 
 Yes , the roasted vegetable salad is good , and the portabella mushroom burger is also a good choice . 
 That is an excellent choice , and I could bring you your salads now or bring them with your dinner . 
 Can I talk to you for a moment , manager ? 
 I've decided to leave . 
 I've worked here for two years . And I want to do something different . 
 I want to live abroad and learn to speak a different language . 
 Thank you , manager . 
 Yes . What can I do for you ? 
 We've got a bad line . Can you repeat that please ? 
 Sorry , the connection is terrible . I'll call you back because I can't hear anything . 
 Well , I'm here to get some help from you . I was hoping to have someone who we can deal with exclusively . On a long-term basis , if that's possible . 
 That sounds perfect . 
 Yes . What size are you ? 
 Try this on please . 
 The rent is 400 yuan a day . 
 I want to buy a hat . 
 Is this one fit for you ? It is nice . 
 How about this one ? 
 You must like this pink one , don't you ? 
 Fifty yuan . 
 How about forty-five ? 
 OK . 
 Yes , I'd like to try the blueberry pie . 
 No , I'm stuffed . I'm ready for the check . 
 Thank you . 
 OK . What do you think of it ? 
 I think so . But can I try another one ? I don't like the color . 
 Can you point out your mother for me ? 
 What ’ s wrong with you ? Why are you scratching so much ? 
 Let me have a look . Whoa ! Get away from me ! 
 I think you have chicken pox ! You are contagious ! Get away ! Don ’ t breathe on me ! 
 Well in the meantime you are a biohazard ! I didn ’ t get it when I was a kid and I ’ Ve heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult ! 
 Thank you for your visit to our company . I'd like to make an introduction for you . Is there anything in particular you'd like to know ? 
 Our production speed is almost twice the industry-wide average . And we've already expanded the factory this year . 
 I'm not familiar with that part . Let me call someone in charge . 
 Rather nice . 
 It was raining when I left New York . 
 Thank you . I am glad that you are enjoying it . 
 I grew up cooking . My mother shared her recipes with me . 
 That is a special coconut ginger chicken with rice dish . 
 Yes , do you like it ? I added a little extra lemon grass and some sea vegetables . 
 Yes , thank you for bringing the wine . It really complements the meal . 
 It ’ s my pleasure . 
 Would you please tell me about your pay skill first ? 
 They sum my skills and experience . I ’ d like to start it with 4000 yuan a month . 
 Do I have paid vacation ? 
 Good morning . What can I do for you ? 
 This is our new brand . I can make sure our computer board is one of the best boards . 
 With pleasure . It's easy to have a memory expansion on board capacity and fulfill your needs for a computer . Besides , there is more space for extra cards to expand later on . 
 The hard drive has 260 G and the RAM is 4 G . 
 Yes . The price differs depending on how many you want . 
 Yes . It depends . If you have a large order , we will give you a discount . 
 My head hurts badly . 
 Since last night . 
 Yes , I even can't fall asleep these days . 
 Is it serious , Doctor ? 
 OK , thank you , Doctor . 
 Yes . I ’ ll have a room free next week . 
 25.00 dollars a week , but you can't have visitors . 
 Could you come back later ? We ’ re right in the middle of dinner . 
 I'm going to the store . 
 Would you like to come with me ? 
 Would you like to go now or later ? 
 What ? 
 OK , let's go . 
 No , it's too far . Let's drive . 
 Yes , sir . 
 Let me see ... it's $ 50 . 
 Sorry , sir . We receive credit card and cash only . 
 Excuse me , we have book table 6 . Would you please come and tidy the table ? 
 Thank you . Could we have the menu , please ? 
 What's going on ? 
 This Friday , I'm throwing a party . 
 Are you serious ? 
 Can you make it ? 
 The party starts at 8 . 
 Am I going to see you there ? 
 When the interview finally comes to an end , the interviewee will probably breathe a sigh of relief . 
 At this moment you can thank the interviewer again for the opportunity of the interview . 
 Don't forget to ask when you can receive a reply . 
 You should state politely that you will wait for the results patiently . 
 In this case , you should remember to give thanks for the reply you get . 
 Just say goodbye to the interviewer before you leave . 
 Excuse me . When is breakfast time ? 
 Well , I would like to order breakfast for tomorrow coming . 
 Please give me two fried eggs , two orders of toast and a cup of coffee . 
 Excuse me , Ma ' am . I would like to mail this package door to door via airmail to London . It is a very important package and has to be sent within 3 days . 
 That's fine with me . I am willing to pay for it as long as you can guarantee me the package can arrive in time . 
 I see . How much do I need to pay in total for this package ? 
 Can I have the receipt ? Just in case I can trace it if something goes wrong . 
 Do I need to include my zip code in the address ? 
 Thank you very much . Here is 500 dollars . 
 Good day , Madam . What service do you require today ?

 We can transfer the funds each month , at your request , into each employee's account . It is possible to pay in cash or to pay directly to the employee's savings account , no matter which bank they do business with . 
 Not at all . We can adjust the payment methods depending on the requirement of each employee . 
 I ’ d like to make a collect call to Beijing China , please .

 Marty Smith . M-A-R-T-Y , S-M-I-T-H 
 My name is Jennifer Smith . My phone number is 610-934-9901 . 
 Your daughter will be back soon . I'm going to start making dinner . You can just watch some TV in TV room if you like . We just bought a new TV with a LCD screen . The remote control is on the coffee table next to the armchair . 
 This is supposed to be your vacation ; we'd like you to just relax . 
 Ok , well , we're going to make a pan of lasagne , a salad , and some garlic bread . Here's the recipe . Do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ? 
 That's a good idea . Can you set the oven to 200 degrees Celsius ? 
 Fine . I'll just get out the casserole dish , the saucepan , the salad bowl , and the baking sheet . 
 I don't think it's broken . 
 Fine . I'll go vacuum . Let me know if you need any other help . 
 Yes , and it is 37 ° C . 
 Yes , I see . Thanks a lot . 
 Hi , I need to transfer some money to another account . It ’ s urgent . 
 No . I ’ Ve never made a transfer before . 
 A company account . I need to pay a bill . 
 I have all the information in this folder . 
 Oh , that ’ s such a relief . I didn ’ t want the payment to be overdue . Thank you so much . 
 Waiter , show me the menu , please . 
 I'll have the baked salmon . 
 I'd rather have broccoli . 
 Yes , I'd like another cup of coffee . 
 I ’ m really glad I got a chance to talk to you before you left , Mary . Have a safe trip ! 
 Yeah , I ’ ll try not to ! See you after Christmas . 
 If I remember correctly , time of delivery is another point on wich we differ . 
 Ok . I hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of Sep . We'd like them to be there in time for our Christmas sales . 
 But in the United States the Christmas season begins about a month before Dec . 25 . 
 I hope you'll try to get them to step up production . 
 If that's the case , there is nothing more to be said . 
 What's your last word as to the date then ? 
 All right . I'll take you at your word . 
 I promise . 
 That's good . Thank you . 
 It's good . It's a nice room . 
 Thank you . 
 I'd like to start at 3000 yuan a month . 
 Does it include bonuses ? 
 Very good . 
 We have made a lot of improvement in packing . You are welcome to see the sample in the showroom . I think you will find the new packing beautiful and quite well-done . 
 We are going to pack them in boxes with a colored picture of the blouse on it . Inside we ’ ll use a transparent poly bag for the blouse ready for the window show . You'll see that the blouses will appeal to the eye as well as to the purse . 
 Can you help me set up my voicemail message ? I just got this service and I am not really sure what I am supposed to say . 
 Ok , so can I say , " This is Abby's voicemail . I will call you later , so leave me your name and number " . 
 Ok , so how about this , " This is Abby and I am really happy you called ! I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can , so please leave me your name and number . Talk to you soon ! " . 
 That's perfect ! Can you say that again and record it for me ? 
 Yes , it is . It has some really good articles in it . 
 I didn't know that . How much does it cost to subscribe ? 
 I used to subscribe to it , but I cancelled my subscription last year . 
 I was the only person in my family reading it . Everyone in my family just likes to read Fashion . 
 I think I should join a fitness centre . I am getting a little fat and I'm totally out of shape . Even a quick walk of a few hundred metres leaves me out of breath . 
 I guess you're right . I've tried stopping , but I just can't seem to quit . 
 I smoke around 30 each day . 
 If I do a few exercises at home , like crunches , I'll soon deal with this waistline . 
 I'll join a fitness centre . I'm sure they'll be able to give me more advice . There's one near my office , so I can go before and after work . I don't want to go jogging in the street , so I'll use a treadmill . 
 How are you doing ? 
 May I help you with something ? 
 Where would you like to transfer money from ? 
 Where would you like the money transferred ? 
 How much would you like to transfer ? 
 Will that be all today ? 
 I'm hungry . Do we have anything to eat ? 
 That's fine with me . 
 Glad to tell you . The price of CPU is 300 dollars . 
 If you order a large amount , we can give you a discount . 
 The price of CPU is 260 dollars above 1,000 Units . 
 I'm sorry , but to be frank , considering exploiting the market in your country , we have already supplied you at very low preferential price . 
 It is so hard to deal with . 
 This price is the best we can make . 
 Yes , I want to buy some grapes . 
 People say grapes from XinJiang are much sweeter than other kinds . Please give me a kilo of that . 
 Make sure they are fresh . 
 How's the building work going ? 
 What's the problem ? We really can't have any delays at this stage . We're working to a really tight schedule and we're already over budget . 
 OK . Keep me informed . Jt must be ready on time . 
 I hate to complain , but this soup is too salty . 
 What do you expect of the position ? 
 What do you think about occupational planning ? 
 Tell me something about your goals . 
 If confronted with difficult task , what will you do ? 
 Would you care much about your salary ? 
 If you were assigned some work which you are not so interested , would you take it or not ? 
 I think it is easier to buy a car than to maintain it . What ’ s worse , I just don ’ t trust those vehicle maintenance shops . Sometimes , they overcharge or don ’ t build those parts I have been paying for . Last week , they even tried to persuade me to buy new parts which really need not to be changed . You know , my car is just half a year old and also good brand . I was just wondering about all these . 
 Is it possible to make a compliant call to some organization what it ’ s someone gets rip-off . 
 Hello . I am Bili and I made an appointment with you to see the house . 
 The house is a little too old . 
 Yes . That's why I like the house . 
 Yes , the main stockholder is International Business Machines Corporation , namely , IBM for short . 
 I wish to work in the planning department . 
 I expect to operate computers . 
 I wish to move up to higher positions with acquisition of more experience in the future . 
 It's a twenty-minute bus ride . 
 I ’ ll work here as long as you expect me to . 
 I ’ Ve thought about that a lot . I know that many women take a job , planning to make a career of it , and then they change their mind . But I am hoping to make it my lifetime work . So if I get married , I will find some ways that I can continue my work . 
 I think so . 
 Ever since I was a young girl , I ’ Ve been clever with my hands . I ’ Ve always enjoyed doing detailed work . If I could use that ability to make your products a little better and to benefit the company , I would be happy . 
 No , nothing in particular . 
 I'll first get further information about our goals , ways , counterparts and management , etc . . Then I ’ ll make my plan . And then I ’ ll go with all my effort to see it is realized . 
 I ’ ll report it honestly . I ’ ll give a correct analysis . I may quit the job - and pay compensation . But I have my way to judge whether I fail . 
 People are supposed to work hard within regular work time , especially when it is an important work that is highly paid for . I don ’ t mind work over spare time if it is paid for . 
 Getting more experience with a widely-known company like yours . Using my speciality in marketing and management . And getting advancement in salary and position . Show my enterprise , confidence and character in passing . 
 I would select the individual that has the most qualifications among all the applicants . He doesn ’ t have to be the person if we have to fill the vacancy . But he has to be the best , even if we have to pay him higher . 
 I will feel it is a pity . But I will not feel so bad . I will go for other interviews until I am employed satisfactorily . Hopefully before I find another position , you will call me back . 
 That ’ s fine ... I need to pick up some stationary-you know , a stapler , scissors , files , who should I see about that ? 
 Thanks . I need to make a few photocopies . 
 Do you enjoy working in this office ? 
 What ’ s usually discussed at the department meetings ? 
 You must like to dance , right . 
 Yes , I like the old style dance , such as waltz 、 rumba and so on . They are quite graceful . 
 Thank you for saying . I think you are light on your toes too . Oh , the music starts again , would you like to have another dance , miss ? 
 Neither do I . I don't like any kind of modern dances all . 
 Are you sure there is enough paint for the house ? 
 No problems . What color ? 
 Really ? How did it go ? 
 Room service.What can I do for you ? 
 There is a laundry form in your room ars well as a bag.Fill out the form and put them together with the laundry in the bag.The maid will come and pick it up . 
 May I help you ? 
 I'm Mary Kelly . May I ask your name ? 
 I'm glad to meet you , Mr . Zhuang . Sit down , please . 
 What are your qualifications for being a clerk typist ? 
 Would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ? 
 ( After testing ) Your typing and stenography are pretty good . Would you be interested in applying for the job ? 
 All right . You need to have an interview with our manager , Mr . McBride . Let's go to his office . 
 Let me run and check . 
 You can find one at the ticket office . 
 You are welcome . 
 What is that ? 
 Cool ! 
 What about all these other pieces ? 
 And these two ? They are husband and wife ? 
 Nah ! This is boring ! I ’ m gonna go play Killer Zombies on my PlayStation ! 
 You are in the right place . Roll up your left sleeve and have a seat . 
 Your doctor wants to know what your white blood cell count is . 
 Usually if your white count is off , the doctor suspects an infection . 
 It is only a pin prick . I have to put this tourniquet on your arm to make the vein easier to find . 
 That blood that just filled the tube is all that I needed . Thanks for coming in ! 
 Is it possible for me to buy some RIB at this counter ? 
 That's a relief ! I was a little worried about it ; I left England in a bit of a hurry . 
 Well , I'm only here for 3 days , so I think 500 GAP should be plenty . 
 I'm looking for a pan I can use in my kitchen . 
 I've already got a small pan . I need a big one . 
 Oh , no , that's way too heavy a pan for me . 
 Yes , it's very lightweight . But I don't want this aluminum handle . 
 Oh , this feels very nice . It's perfect . I'll take it . 
 Cash . But first , I need a lid for this pan . 
 I found a great school for Junior ! 
 We can't be too cautious about these things . 
 There is a huge slide on the playground and lots of trees and even a little brook ! 
 There is a library right inside the front door . 
 How much is the postage for this postcard to China ? 
 By airmail . 
 Here you are . 
 Oh , one more thing , I want to send the card by registered mail too . 
 Here it is . and thank you very much . 
 Daniel , you know ? Lisa has invited us to have dinner this afternoon . 
 If I remember correctly , time of delivery is another point in which we differ . 
 Ok . I hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of September . We'd like them to be ready in time for our Christmas sales . 
 No . But in the United States , the Christmas season begins about a month before December 25 . 
 I hope you can try to get them to step up production . 
 If that's the case , there's nothing to be done about it . 
 What's your last word as to the delivery date then ? 
 All right . I'll take your words at that . 
 I promise . 
 Two hamburgers and French fries . 
 Give me two cokes also , please . 
 We'll eat here . 
 And can I have some ketchup , please ? 
 Welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you today ? 
 OK , that's absolutely fine . I will need to see some credentials before we can get started . Do you have the notification of admission letter from your university , your passport and your visa with you ? 
 You do , I'm afraid . There are 3 ways to do this . You can choose , mortgage , pledge or guarantee mode . 
 Right , that's no problem . I see you are already well informed . If you choose that one , you can borrow up to 70 % of the total tuition and miscellaneous fees . 
 Excuse me , sir ? I just need a little bit more information . Could you tell me your telephone number and mailing address ? 
 That ’ s 545-8897 and your mailing address is 908 Mulbury Street . The zip code is 20310 , right ? 
 Excuse me , Ms . Montgomery ? 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry , Ms . Montgomery . I ’ ll come back later . 
 Are you feeling OK ? 
 What have you been eating ? 
 Maybe the food had something wrong with it . 
 Have you been under a lot of pressure lately ? 
 Perhaps you have caught that bug that is going around . 
 Where will it be ? 
 OK . But let me park my car in a better position . All right , miss . Where are the bags ? 
 That's a lot . What did you bring with you ? 
 Beth , would you like me to help you carry it ? 
 Don't be silly . It's no trouble at all . 
 I ’ m just looking for a nice pillow on Ebay . 
 Why ? I don ’ t have to leave the house or browse a dozen stores to find what I ’ m looking for . This way , I just search for it online quick and easy . 
 Well , the website handles a point system where if the seller does something wrong , people comment negatively and then you know that he or she may not be trustworthy . 
 You can use a credit card or your debit card . They also let you use the Paypal system which is really safe and fast . I have never had any problems with someone hacking my information or anything . 
 You can find anything ! Are you sure you want to start shopping online though ? Once you step into this world , there is no turning back ! 
 Mom ! ? ? ? 
 Mmm ... 
 I have the chills . Can you turn on the heater ? 
 I would like to place an order . 
 I have your catalog here . Do you want me to tell you the item numbers , or the names ? 
 Alright . I want to order the satin sheets on page 28 . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 I need one full set of sheets in King-size . 
 Ivory , please 
 Yes , I think so . Can I ask you something ? 
 I'm a foreigner here . My English isn't perfect . Can you tell me what satin is ? 
 I see . That's what I thought . 
 No , I just need the sheets . 
 Yes . 
 Visa . 
 8825 1127 4235 9869 . 
 July , 2006 . 
 Thank you . 
 No one . 
 Do you have wool socks ? 
 Can you guarantee the quality ? 
 Where are the panty-hose ? 
 Mr . Carmichael , this is Ellen Bower calling again . You had said I should call this week to schedule an interview with you . 
 I understand , Mr . Carmichael . I'd be glad to make it some time next week . 
 Mark ! I was wondering if you finished that presentation you were working on last week ? 
 Mr . Rodriguez was asking me about it yesterday . 
 Here you are . How is Danny ? 
 What did the doctor say ? 
 Shall we go back home now ? 
 I bought some advanced medicine . Is there anything you need ? 
 Now what ? 
 Okay , this is the third time . 
 You don't have to know . Bye for now . 
 I'm thirsty . Pull over to that store , I'll buy some drinks . 
 Oh , that's too bad . Where can you park around here ? 
 Is a shop there ? 
 Just stop here for a moment . The police will not notice . 
 All right . Let's go to the square to have a look . 
 I'm planning a trip to Europe . 
 Well , what's the price of this route ? 
 What about a medication to help me with my problem ? 
 What types of medications would be best ? 
 What are the side effects from taking that drug , 
 Will that one medication take care of all of my problems ? 
 Am I going to experience any complications with that drug ? 
 Where are you going for lunch ? 
 I know of a restaurant . I'm sure you'll like it . 
 Yes.it serves excellent Sichuan food . Spicy food may improve your appetite . 
 Fair-Priced Fares , how may I help you ? 
 When did you plan to go , sir ? 
 The second week of September is still in the high-season , so the cheapest tickets are $ 650 . The high season lasts until the 15th , so fares after that date are cheaper . 
 Our cheapest ticket is $ 550 on American Airlines . 
 I would like to get a bus pass . 
 Can you tell me my options ? 
 I would like the student pass . 
 Here you go . 
 How much will it be for the pass ? 
 That'll be fine . 
 Day , I'm home . 
 I'll do it later . 
 Can I have some cookies first , please ? 
 Yeah , it's the last world-wide horti-cultural exposition in the century , and one of the grand festivities of cross-century significance held by the China's tourism industry . 
 Oh , there's plenty . Flowers and plants from all over the world , of course . Besides , gardening techniques are demonstrated , modern facilities displayed , academic exchanges and seminars organized , and folk performances of different nations shown almost every day . 
 Oh , can't compare with the Kunming Expo at all ! The Kunming Expo covers an area of 218 hectares , and more than 9000 flower enterprises from over 100 countries and regions are invited to participate in the Expo . 
 Far more than that , I dare to say ! Inland provinces and cities , Hong Kong and Macao , as well as many countries and regions in the world have an exhibition area of their own to display their unique flowers and plants . Each month there's a special day for a particular country or region , and folk performances are given . You will feel it a great pity if you missile Kunming Expo . 
 Yes , I do it quite often . 
 Simple , it's fun . 
 Ah , that's the biggest fun of all . You see , even though you're not a good singer , people will listen to you . 
 But I like the feeling . 
 Can I get a burger and a large fries ? 
 A large coke , please . 
 Eating here , please . 
 Both Bob and carl will become somebody in the future.Don ' t you think so ? 
 But Bob is more generous and ready to help . 
 Why don't we get ourselves a new car ? The old one's falling apart . 
 What kind shall we get ? 
 Yes , fine . 
 Why not sometime next week ? 
 OK . 
 There's a car dealer down the road . How about going there ? 
 Fine , We'll do that . 
 My name is Wang Lin . My English name is Linda . 
 Yeah , like it very much . My name has become a part of me . 
 I live in the Haitian District . 
 Yes , I ’ m 38 years old . 
 Thanks . 
 My birthplace is Yentai . 
 I've got a sore throat and my chest hurts . 
 It has been two or three days . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Thank you . 
 Tell me about fees . 
 I want to know about overdraft fees . 
 How much ? 
 That ’ s not a small fee . 
 That ’ s for sure . 
 That ’ s all I needed to know . Thanks . 
 Where to , sir ? 
 Please hop in . 
 It ’ ll take about 20 minutes . 
 Yes , they are . 
 Yes , it is . Are you in a hurry sir ? 
 Yes , sir . 
 Not at all . What would you like to see first ? 
 Let's walk around the lake first , shall we ? 
 Have you been here before ? 
 I will take you to Li River after walking around here . 
 Yes , you'll be in a different world there . 
 Send it by the fastest way . 
 How much ? 
 OK . 
 Is that so ? 
 Have you decided ? 
 Could you tell me why you want to quit ? 
 Oh , that sounds terrible . Would you be happier with higher pay here ? I'm sure something can be worked out . 
 OK . I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you.However , I think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay . 
 Good evening . We want a dinning room with a table for eight . 
 No , thanks . We have made a reservation before . 
 My name is James . 
 Thanks . 
 I would like to go to Europe for a visit ? Can you recommend me an interesting city ? 
 Do you have a package tour to Paris ? 
 I had a busy morning . 
 I watered all the plants . 
 Then I did my laundry . 
 I took the dog for a walk . 
 I vacuumed the entire house . 
 And then I made lunch . 
 Mom ! 
 I'm playing with my new jump rope ! Watch this ! 
 But I feel better . 
 OK . I get it . I'm getting back into bed ... 
 Much better , thanks . I have been resting all day . Only with television as my companion.In fact , in the whole week the only thing I feel like doing was watching TV . 
 I started with game show this morning , I really enjoy them , and even answered the most of questions correctly . 
 At 2 o'clock , I switched to the Channel 6 , and watched a terrific movie without commercials . 
 I want to watch it , but I was already tired by the time it came on . I had a rest instead , then I watched the news at Channel 11 . 
 A bank was robbed this afternoon . A reporter on the scene covered the event , the live coverage reproduce the robbery to the live . 
 Hello . Is that Nicholas ? 
 Never ! Do you know his new number ? 
 Yes , I do . Go on . 
 4945939 . Marvellous ! Thanks for your help . 
 Two boxes of transparencies for the over-head machines . 
 All right , Mr . Jones . Do you think we ’ ll need anything else ? 
 I like listening to different kinds of music . 
 I enjoy Rock and R & B . 
 I like the different instruments that they use . 
 Yeah , I think so too . 
 I sure did ! 
 I voted for Obama . 
 I knew he would win . 
 He was the best candidate this year . 
 I guess America is finally maturing . 
 Do you have cruise tours ? 
 Sure . That's really amazing . However I don't have so much time . Do you have a full day cruise ? 
 Pete's Pizza , may I help you ? 
 Will that be for pick-up or delivery ? 
 Can I get your phone number ? 
 And your address ? 
 This is your room . What do you think of it ? 
 We have the room color designed for our guest . 
 Let's begin by having you tell me about yourself and your background . 
 What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession ? 
 Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description ? 
 Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome . 
 What are your strengths and weaknesses ? 
 Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss . 
 When do you find a job satisfying ? 
 How would your coworkers describe you ? 
 Do you have any questions ? 
 Where do you want to go ? 
 Get in . I will take you there . 
 $ 50 . 
 Ye , of course . 
 I see by your resume that you have just graduated from college . I assume you haven't had any working experience . Is that right ? 
 Well , experience is not important in this job . We are looking for a man we can train to be a teller . By the way , do you like to work with figures ? 
 We are more interested in finding someone who is alert and quick at figures . Do you like meeting the public ? 
 We have very pleasant working conditions and I think we have a fine staff to work with . You would be assigned an experienced employee to help you . He would be responsible for training you . Have you studied English conversation ? 
 Yes , many of our customers are Americans , so you would be speaking English with most of them . Do you know anything about various kinds of savings and checking accounts ? 
 That's good answer . I appreciate your being frank . 
 I would if I could . 
 Yes , with pleasure . 
 I like word games . 
 I don't like it at all . 
 I'm not one for the games . 
 What about playing go ? 
 Excuse me . Could you tell me where the post office is ? 
 Thank you so much for your assistance ! 
 Your English has really improved in the two months you've been here , too . 
 No , I'm going to leave the office early today . My annual medical check-up is this afternoon . 
 He's on a weeklong meditation retreat and won't be back until this weekend . 
 Sorry , I'm supposed to be with my son . 
 Thanks . I appreciate it . 
 Well , I ’ Ve bought a lot of meat . I ’ Ve got pork chops , small steaks , chicken wings , and plenty of hot sausages and hamburger patties . 
 I think so . I bought some paper plates and cups for people to use . It will save on the washing up ! 
 They sell them at the shop around the corner . We can go and get some in a few minutes . 
 I have the sauce , but remind me to get some ketchup at the shop . 
 It only takes a few minutes . Some people like their meat well done . Others like it rare . The great thing about a barbecue is that everyone can choose how they want their meat cooked . 
 I hope you haven ’ t invited any vegetarians ! 
 I think the job should make use of the professional experience I have obtained , and offer me opportunity for advancement . 
 I feel my background and experience are a good fit for this position and I am very interested.What ' s more , your company is outstanding in this field . 
 My graduate school training combined with my experience as an intern should qualify me for this particular job . I am sure I will be successful . 
 Your company is very reputed in this city . I heard much praise to your company . 
 I ’ m not so satisfied with it . 
 I'm now a secretary in my present work unit . My work is not interesting . I have to type , make copies , book tickets and so on . Everyday I follow the routine . Furthermore , I have studied English for four years at university , but I can ’ t use it there . They are the reasons I plan to change my job . 
 One of my relatives told me that your company needs someone who can speak English . That's just the job that I have been looking for 
 I'm from Germany . 
 Yeah , but I can speak English , too . 
 A little French . 
 Did I do well on my test ? 
 Why wouldn't I want to know ? 
 Exactly what do you mean by bad ? 
 How'd I fail it ? 
 What did I do wrong ? 
 Thanks.Will I be able to take a retest ? 
 Does it look like a good fit ? 
 Yes , it is very nice . I'll take it . 
 Let me use my credit card . 
 No problem . 
 Did you get my email ? 
 Sure . 
 Well , to be honest , nothing is more stressful than going on a business trip with our boss . 
 I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses . I spent half of the weekend on a train ! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets ! 
 I see . Well , then perhaps they could give me a few days off after a business trip . It was really tiring for me . 
 Thank you . I can't imagine getting much done today . I'm just too exhausted ! 
 No , should I have ? 
 Go to Gate 56 , the plane is now boarding , you must hurry . 
 Instead of walking you can take this shuttle to get you there faster . 
 No , I will call the attendants at the gate . I'll tell them you are on your way . 
 You're welcome , have a safe trip . 
 How would you like them ? 
 Is there anything else ? 
 Good morning , everybody . Welcome to IAM Technology . I'm very pleased so many of you could make it here today . My name's Sam Weiss . I'm the Production Manager . I'd like to show you the layout of the factory before we go and visit it . As you can see from this diagram , everything is under one roof . We've designed it this way to help the flow of materials and to avoid bottlenecks . 
 Excuse me , driver , where is the main area for restaurants ? 
 OK . Is there a Chinese restaurant ? 
 Woo , I can't help being there . 
 Yes , I'd like to buy a new computer , but I don't really know much about them . Can you give me any suggestions ? 
 Laptops are more expensive , right ? 
 I'll just get a regular home computer then . I don't think I'll need to lug my computer around with me . 
 I'm fine , Dr . Beecham . Yes , just a cleaning and check-up today . 
 ( She probed my teeth and checked my gums . ) Well , it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose . We need to fill that cavity before it gets any worse and the crown needs to be refitted . Make an appointment for next week and I'll take care of them . 
 Since you had that done here , we'll take care of it . There won't be a charge . And , your insurance should cover the work on the cavity . Now , I'm going to have the hygienist do your cleaning and I'll see you soon for the other work . 
 Why didn't you sign the contract ? 
 Well , Miss Li , it's time for us to say good-bye to each other . 
 I'm glad you could come to see us off . I have enjoyed your interpreting . You have done a wonderful job . I hope you be my interpreter again next time I'm here . 
 It's hard to tear myself away from your friendly people and your ancient country , but nothing lasts for ever . I have to go back home this time , but I'm sure I'll return very soon . 
 Good-bye . Miss Li , say hello to your husband and your son for me . See you soon . 
 Hong , I really need to call back to the UK but I can ’ t afford to pay for the roaming charges . 
 Can I do that ? 
 I see . How much will that cost ? 
 Wow , that is cheap . Thank you very much . 
 No . We broke up last month . I ’ m taking a break from dating for a while . 
 We just decided to stop seeing each other . It was all very amicable . Are you still going out with mike ? 
 Good for you ! Have you seen Kelly recently ? Is she still dating nick ? 
 She was right to do that . I heard the Neil and Tina getting married soon . 
 I think it ’ s 26th September . I ’ ll check and make sure that Tina remembers to invite you to the hen night . 
 He certainly looks interested , doesn ’ t he ? Shall we invite him over to our table ? 
 How did I do ? 
 Really ? I thought I was doing well . 
 Hi Mike . What have you been up to ? 
 Trying to get in shape ? 
 Me too . What are you doing besides exercising ? 
 I think if you eat better , it will help tremendously . 
 Looks like there are a lot of things to do to stay healthy . 
 I am keen on a coat on www.dingding.com . But it requires having an online banking account . Is it necessary ? 
 Do you know how to get the bank account ? 
 So easy . 
 My shopping life will be more convenient . 
 No . 
 Sure , what's happened ? 
 Never mind . 
 It doesn't matter . 
 Oh , it's nothing . 
 Not a bit of it , don't blame yourself . 
 Sure , what I can do for you ? 
 You can just put Dear Sir or Madam , officialese not personal , you can write to whom may concerned . 
 Good ! But also , write off the bed you want to tell them the reason of your writing , give them more reference . 
 Right , do you need them to respond ? 
 You can tell them " Please finding the enclosed customer service survey , else also , you can say Attach a customer survey . If you need resource it right away , you can tell them the urgent by saying Please return the survey without dely as soon as possible . Maye it more polite with this as early as convenience . 
 I need to hire you . 
 I need you for my court date . 
 I ’ m being charged with a felony . 
 What is your price ? 
 I can ’ t afford that . 
 That ’ s expensive , but I need you . 
 We have a few different wholesale vendors , so our cost varies a bit over the fiscal year . But the difference is miniscule , a fluctuation of about 0.2 % . 
 Retail price is 29.95 per unit . We take into consideration changes in supply cost when figuring this price . 
 No , that's the price before tax . The tax rate is varies from different marketing areas , so it is difficult for us to figure in . 
 Our profit margin is in the neighborhood of 20 % . 
 I'm not very sure.but I know ruby is less valuable than diamond . 
 I got it from an encyclopedia . 
 I'm not quitting yet . You know my favourite slogan , don't you ? 
 Right ! 
 Ok . 
 Ahahah , and I thought you were tired . 
 It sure looks special , looks expensive too . 
 Don't worry , Marian , I've got you covered . 
 Hey , what are you doing here ? 
 What are you shopping for ? 
 Same here . 
 I found a few pairs of pants . 
 I found them at Pennies . 
 Do you want me to show you where I found them ? 
 have you thought of moving at all Sarah ? 
 buying a house can be expensive , but there are ways to find cheaper houses . 
 well , sometimes the city auctions off houses to the community . You ’ d have to make a quick decision about the offer in a day , but you would definitely save money doing it that way . 
 sure , my sister-in-law and her husband just bought a house that way . They ’ re pretty satisfied with it . 
 not at all . The woman , who owned it , took good care of it . But when she died , she had no family left and no will , so the government had to sell it for her . 
 it was about 75 years old . There were a few repairs that needed doing , but it didn ’ t take a lot of money or time . 
 the area can be a bit rough in the evenings , but the neighbors watch out for each other , so it ’ s ok . 
 I'd like to look at your stereo systems . Do you have anything on sale ? 
 But it doesn't have a turntable . I have a fair number of vinyl records , so I need something to play them on . 
 I was wondering if I could collect unemployment benefits . 
 I am still working for now , but I might get laid off . 
 Does everyone who gets laid off get to collect unemployment ? 
 How can I find out if I can collect ? 
 How will I know how much I can collect on unemployment ? 
 You look tired . 
 Really ? How come ? 
 You shouldn ’ t work so hard . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Good afternoon , Mr . Anderson . 
 How nice to see you again ! 
 It's been a long time , hasn't it ? How are you ? 
 Very well too , is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Sure , Mr . Anderson , please come along with me . 
 My pleasure . 
 I like popular music best . 
 Who is your favorite singer ? 
 Do you know this song ? 
 Let's sing it together , shall we ? 
 When would you like me to send those plans over to your office , Mr . Montgomery ? 
 That shouldn ’ t be a problem . What is the exact address , again ? 
 I'd like to order broadband internet for my laptop . 
 Well , I don't have an Ethernet port . My computer runs entirely on wireless service . 
 Yes , please ! Tell me about the alternatives . 
 Very good . How much does that cost ? 
 I see . And the other alternatives ? 
 Great ! What if I need to print something in the lobby ? 
 Well , I'm glad you're finally back . I was wondering what happened . 
 Why ? 
 You got lost . You're kidding ! 
 You could have called . 
 You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ? 
 I don't know . Where ? 
 Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ? 
 Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here . 
 Hmm , maybe I do . 
 Maybe I have an idea how it happened . 
 You were too busy looking at Joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road . 
 Yes , that's what I think.Maybe the next time you go out with him to buy groceries , you'll get lost for even longer.Maybe six hours or so . 
 What ? 
 Hah , hah ! See ? I guessed right . You weren't watching the road at all . 
 What do you think is the role teacher should play in the classroom ? 
 What did you do to put it into practice ? 
 Why did your parents make you stay at home ? 
 Didn't you mind doing it ? 
 Didn't you even want to go to the cinema ? 
 What was on television last night ? 
 Oh . I enjoy watching boxing on television , too.What a pity I missed it last night ! 
 I went to a boxing match in the sports stadium . 
 Yeah , I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet . 
 Sounds good . I don ’ t want it to be too expensive , maybe something mid-range . 
 What about Wi-fi ? 
 One last thing . Is it waterproof ? 
 Yes . How much do you want ? 
 One dollar to five francs . Is that all right ? 
 Of course , we can . 
 10 o'clock in the morning to 2 o'clock in the afternoon . 
 Not at all . 
 Well , we can proceed with the order until after the Christmas holidays . Our factories will be closed for another week . 
 No problem . Once we get your purchase order , we will begin the execution of the order right away . 
 That will be fine . And I can promise you that you'll get the goods about two weeks after we get your purchase order . 
 Who ? 
 There ’ s nobody here by that name . 
 What would you like to order , sir ? 
 We serve different styles of Chinese food here . But I'm not sure which one do you prefer . 
 Well . Cantonese food is rather light , Beijing food is heavy , and Sichuan food is usually hot and spicy . 
 If so , I suggest you have a taste for Sichuan food . Most Sichuan dishes are spicy and hot , but they have different tastes . 
 Yes . Roasted Crispy Chicken and Spicy Beef are our specialties . 
 Hi , Dave . You're early . 
 I had an idea . 
 I'm sorry . I know you feel betrayed . 
 My mind is made up . 
 Some what ? 
 No , I ’ d rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home . Maybe we can try some other food today ... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ? 
 Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ? 
 What if that happens to me ? I hate to let food go to waste . 
 We're leaving now . 
 Right . And would you please forward our mail to this address ? 
 Thank you . Goodbye . 
 Good afternoon , sir , is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Well , it's our fault.We are sorry for that.Would you please fill out the form ? We will pay for you . 
 What should I prepare for the recruitment fair ? 
 What application materials should I take ? 
 Who finances the magazine ? 
 Does it have a large circulation ? 
 I'll have sole , then . 
 The rest of us will have this today's special , please . 
 I'm sorry but I ordered sole , not the same as the others.Will you change it ? 
 Then , I'll have this pork cute instead . 
 You will never guess where my family is going for summer vacation . 
 How in the world did you guess that ? Did someone tell you already ? 
 I want to ride a camel and definitely see the pyramids ! 
 It helps that my dad is an archaeologist . 
 I would appreciate it if you could go to the store for me . 
 Here's a list with a few things that I need you to get . 
 I don't think I forgot anything . 
 If you don't mind , I would appreciate it if you would pick up my prescription . 
 Someone at the pharmacy called and told me it was ready . 
 Thank you . 
 Hello . I would like to make a reservation at 8: 00 . 
 4 . By the way , what's your dress code ? 
 I see . Thank you . 
 Yes . An passport and a visa are necessary for entry into China . 
 They should fill in an application form , hand in the copies of Identification Card and household register . 
 It ’ s a difficult choice . The train is a litter faster , but much more expensive . 
 Buses are more cramped and you can ’ t walk around . 
 Really ? I think you see more traveling by train . 
 I prefer going by train , ever though it costs more . 
 The train aren ’ t usually full . We can get them on the day we travel . We should buy return ticket because they are much cheaper than getting two singles . 
 From reviewing your resume I can see that you have ample experience for this position.What I want to know is why you think you ’ re right for the job . 
 So you ’ Ve acquainted yourself with the company . It ’ s refreshing to interview someone who ’ s sure of what they want . 
 Commitment to the company and the team is very important to us here . 
 Can I ask for leave this afternoon ? 
 I had a headache this morning . I didn ’ t pay attention to it . I thought probably it is because I didn ’ t sleep well . But now it is getting worse and worse . I feel quite dizzy now and my eyes are somehow very light-sensitive . Maybe it is the migrated . 
 Thank you very much . I am sure good rest will do indeed . I don ’ t have this too often . 
 Yes . 
 But it's the style now . 
 Of course . 
 Why is that ? 
 Oh , I see . 
 What happened to her ? 
 I see . 
 Yes , but you look fine . 
 Poor boy ! But don't worry . Here are two pills made in Germany . It's really effective . He will be just fine . 
 Take some with you next time , just in case . 
 You mean the boy who felt carsick just now ? 
 Oh , sorry , maybe I gave you the wrong medicine . 
 It's just sleeping pills made in America which is also very good . But don't worry . It has no undesirable side-effects . 
 Good evening . How many people of your party ? 
 For buffet ? 
 Thirty for each adult , twenty each kid . 
 Please go to the tables over there for cold dishes and vegetables . The hot dishes are on the other side . 
 Not for soft drinks . But we charge ten yuan for each alcohol order . 
 What is your address , sir ? 
 OK , someone will be there by 12:15 . 
 We could try it for the first few weeks and see if she likes it . 
 You have a good point . She hasn't really ever been away from home for longer than a few hours . 
 Yes , they seemed to click at the meeting the other day . 
 No , but I did notice that she was very interested in the art supplies ! 
 What kind of bus pass would you like to buy ? 
 You can get a day , weekly , monthly , or student pass . 
 Sure , can I see your student ID ? 
 Very good . 
 It's free , but the monthly sticker is $ 24 . 
 Thank you for your purchase . 
 I really want to make a salad . 
 I'm not sure what kind that I want . 
 Those taste really good . 
 I want a chicken salad . 
 I like salads with croutons , almonds , and shredded cheese . 
 Why don't you make a salad like that ? 
 Good morning , and welcome to our bank . What can I do for you today ? 
 What seems to be the problem ? 
 I see . Well , you have two choices ; you can renew it or redeem it . Which would you prefer ? 
 Not a problem . But may I just inform you that we have introduced a new service called Account Renewing upon Maturity ? 
 You see , that means when anything is up for renewal , we do it automatically and you don't have to physically come here to sort it out . All you need to do is sign here and we'll set it all up for you . 
 My shirt needs ironing . Could you please help me with that , Mary ? 
 Please , I promise this is the last time . 
 Tell me something about your work experience . 
 What systems have you worked on ? 
 Do you feel comfortable with the new system by microcosm ? 
 What do you consider your strengths ? 
 Jane , the meeting is scheduled from 1:00 this afternoon . Have you made the necessary arrangements ? 
 That's right . The meeting is very important . Where shall the guests be received before the meeting begins ? 
 We'll have several foreign guests to attend the meeting . 
 Really ? I'll also try to speak slowly . How would you arrange the guests ' seats , Jane ? 
 Well , after my report , there will be an interval for rest and refreshments . 
 Excuse me . Could you tell me the way to the Star Hotel ? 
 How long will it take me to get there ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 I need a haircut . 
 No , I don't . You look pretty busy today . Do you have an opening for me ? 
 Just a haircut . I washed my hair this morning . 
 Well , I last had a haircut eight weeks ago . So my hair is pretty long.But I want the same style . 
 Alright . You are the expert . I'm happy to have your recommendation . 
 Fine . 
 Yes . 
 Yes , I know my hair is quite thin.It runs in my family . Everybody has very thin hair . 
 I don't know what to do about it . 
 Do you sell conditioner here ? 
 Great . I would be happy to try it . I know my hair doesn't look good now . It's too weak . 
 Do you have desserts ? 
 Can you give us more information ? 
 I would like to have the coffee rum pies . 
 Most normal little girls go wild over Barbie dolls . 
 Here's the latest model — Digital Barbie . 
 Why , she's only $ 29.95 . 
 Excellent . Would you like anything else ? 
 The total will be $ 32.42 . Will that be cash ? 
 Here's your change . Thank you for shopping with us . 
 Good afternoon , Mrs Smith . 
 Thank you . Yes , I am Dunlin . 
 Many factors led me to major in mechanical engineering . The most important factor is I like tinkering with machines . 
 I like designing products , and one of my designs received an award . Moreover , I am familiar with CAD . But I can do any mechanic well if I am employed . 
 Your company has a very good reputation , and I am very interested in the field your company is in . 
 Interpersonal and technical skills . 
 I have the abilities , qualities and experience that you requested in your job advert , for example I have three years experience in designing products and I got leadership experience while serving the college student union as president . 
 After a few years of gaining experience in the company and furthering my professional qualifications I'd like to put my experience and skills to use in management . I want to become a supervisor in your R & D department . 
 Yes . Do you offer any opportunities for further study ? 
 That's fine . 
 No . 
 Thank you , Mrs . Smith . I do hope the answer will be favorable . Goodbye . 
 Well , under normal conditions each head lasts about 5 000 copies or so . It depends on the user , but about once a month is average . 
 That's right . It could last six months or more . This model's designed for heavy use . Don't worry - you'll get an error message telling you when to change the head . 
 You're right , we need to start making money soon , or at least manage to break even . But I think that the market is slowly beginning to heat up--sales are bound to pick up any time now . 
 Maybe we should rethink our marketing strategy to include the possibility that our new line of cosmetics could be a big seller . 
 Do you think it's that serious ? 
 My goodness , I didn't realize it was that bad . 
 Why ? 
 That's right . I haven't done that yet . 
 Really ? 
 What do they mean ? 
 Can I help you , madam ? 
 Have you any particular color in mind ? 
 Red is very popular . 
 Yes , madam , I agree . What size are you ? 
 Here you are , madam . All these are sixteens . 
 It's $ 180 . 
 These are our cheapest coats , madam . 
 Here's your change . 
 The order is so urgently required that we have to ask you to speed up shipment . If shipment is too late , we'll have to turn to other suppliers . 
 Can you find some way for an earlier delivery ? 
 Sounds like a good idea . 
 I agree with your proposal . 
 I want to sign up for some funds units . How do I go about it ? 
 Yes . I've already got a fund account with you too . 
 I'm not quite sure . You see , I already have more than 5,000 RIB in my cash card , but I really don't know how much I should get . 
 That settles it then . 5,000 RIB it is , thanks . 
 May I ask if there's anything wrong with it ? 
 Oh , sorry.But do you want to change it for another one ? 
 Paul , you were also a parent of young kids before . So , can you tell me what you did when your kids didn ’ t behave very well ? 
 I do it , too . You know , sometimes when we eat , my child would pull a dish towards him and grab it with his hands and eat . And if it were something he doesn ’ t like , he would spit it out and throw it into other dishes . He does it very often . I really get mad . I can ’ t help spank him sometimes . 
 My husband is an American . He criticizes me when I do that . He says that I can ’ t change a child ’ s behavior by using force . He is learning what I am doing now . 
 Yeah . I ’ m still learning how to control his behavior and my temper . My child is almost two years old , and I ’ Ve learnt the distraction technique when he cries for something . 
 I have a Promissory Note , but it's not called that . It's a Bill of Exchange . 
 So , even if someone wasn't directly involved , they can become involved ? Like the bank you cash it in ? 
 I see . Sorry about this , I'm new in this job and I've never even seen one of these before ! My boss just told me to come here and sort it out . 
 Why are you handing me a plastic cup ? 
 How am I supposed to do that ? 
 What am I supposed to do with the cup when I am done ? 
 What kind of test is this ? 
 How long will it take to get the results ? 
 Hello . I need to disconnect my phone , please . 
 At 345 Lincoln Avenue . Oklahoma City . 
 I ’ m moving to a new home . 
 John Smith . 
 555-7658 
 623 West Side Drive . New York , New York . 
 Thank you , you too . 
 Rudeness . You are not expected to sit down before being invited , and you shouldn ’ t throw yourself into the chair like you ’ re loading heavy baggage . 
 That ’ s right . The ideal posture for women is to put their legs together and lean to one side . This is especially important in summer . 
 Put it beside you . Don ’ t pile your purses , briefcase and other belongings on the employer ’ s desk . You've got long hair . Don ’ t touch it while talking to the interviewer . It gives people the feeling that you cannot concentrate on your work . 
 Also , if you are asked to sit beside the employer's desk , neither lean on it nor look at the documents there . 
 As the saying goes , when in Rome , do as the Romans do . 
 Hello . I'd like to open a Foreign Currency Account . 
 Oh dear . I wanted AUD . Is that not possible ? 
 Maybe I'll go for the US dollar account . 
 Excuse me , Miss . Can you show me my seat ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Could you please fill out this form ? 
 Here's your $ 200 . 
 Thank you . 
 Of course , Mr . Green . 
 No problem . I will do it immediately . 
 OK . Would you like this report done in a formal or informal style ? 
 I see . Anything else ? 
 What are you looking for ? 
 Where did you lose it ? Maybe I can help you to find it . 
 Mister , I have an account now . 
 Six tens will be fine . 
 Thanks . Er , mister , if I want to deposit checks next time . what should I do ? 
 Lately I've felt that company morale is at an all-time low what can your firm do to help get my business back on track ? 
 It seems that my employees are having trouble working as a team . Not to mention serious lapses in service , sales and leadership skills . 
 What a relief ! I was beginning to think it was no way to get my business rolling again . 
 It ’ s freezing in here ! Can I turn up the heat ? 
 Dad ! Are you serious ? What ’ s the point of having central heating if we can ’ t use it ! Look , I can see my breath ! 
 Dad ! I ’ m gonna catch a cold ! 
 May I have your order now ? 
 The courses for our regular dinner are , appetizer , soup , beef steak , dessert and coffee . 
 What kind of dessert do you want ? 
 Yes , we have . 
 Wait for a moment , I'll come back soon . 
 Yep . The steaks and chicken are marinated and I also bought hamburger buns . 
 Yeah , good idea.We can put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill . I also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot . 
 This is gonna be a great barbecue ! 
 I'm not sure if that would be wise . 
 Well , maybe we'll go to ask Mr . Johnson . He has the final say . 
 Oh , we need an umbrella . The weather is so changeable in that area . 
 All right . 
 Nothing really . 
 I didn't realize that . 
 Nobody has told me anything about your party . 
 When does it start ? 
 I'll be there . 
 Of course . 
 Hello . I'm Ms Dawson from Lexington Software . I need to send these documents to Vietnam via L / C . 
 I have , but I have never done this before so would it be possible for you to double check them ? 
 Thank you . I don't think there should be any problems , but just to be sure ... 
 That's fine . Thank you again . 
 Okay , well it ’ s always more difficult to describe them isn ’ t it ? 
 Well as I mentioned before , I do tend to get frustrated if I don ’ t see progress in my work or career . I suppose I ’ m quite a restless character . My father always taught me to be a high achiever . 
 Well , in a way yes . But I must say that even if I ’ m not completely happy in my work I always give 110 % I would never shirk my responsibilities . I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon . 
 Yes , please . 
 Are you homesick ? 
 Don't worry about the bill . Just call . 
 Of course . First dial the code 011 to get an international line . Then you dial Taiwan's country code 
 Now you should know the rest . Don't forget to dial Taipei's city code . 
 Yes , we have a nice room on the sixth floor . 
 200 yuan a night . 
 Yes . And could I have your name ? 
 How long do you want to stay ? 
 Sure . We'll be there in a few minutes . 
 We'd like to . You may call the attendant if you need any help . 
 What's up ? 
 Why don't you go ? 
 I see . I'll do it for you . 
 Why did you choose Applied Sociology as your major ? 
 Have you taken the course in Public Relations when you are in college ? 
 Reservation Center , Air China . Can I help you ? 
 May I have your name , please ? 
 Certainly . 
 Yes . You are reconfirmed on Flight No . 125 for Zhenjiang , leaving Beijing at 2:00 p . m . on January 15th . 
 You are welcome . 
 There is one around the corner . 
 Yes , but you have to get a phone card first . 
 You can get one in the grocery store over there . 
 It's the Cygnet Trust . 
 Of course . C , Y , G , N , E , T . 
 Gross ! What are you doing to yourself ? 
 It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture . 
 Well , you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball ! 
 What for ? 
 Yes , John . I ’ m on my break . What ’ s going on ? 
 Great , except for my mother-in-law ! Sometimes I think I married her instead of my husband ! How about you ? 
 Yeah ! I bought it the day it was released . 
 It's a great game . There are a lot of new characters . 
 It cost about thirty . Most games cost about that much . 
 Oh , I know what you mean . I'm addicted to that game . 
 Yeah , my roommate likes to watch me play . He says it's like watching a movie . 
 And I've never heard such good sound in a game . 
 Is there anything you don't do in-house ? 
 Is that more expensive ? 
 Do you think it's time to sign the contract , Mr . Simpson ? 
 OK , no problem . I hope there are no questions about the terms . 
 Shall we sign this contract now ? 
 Just sign at the bottom . 
 You're right . Thank you for your cooperation . 
 What are you doing here ? How about your resume now ? 
 Don't act like this . Please have good thoughts in your mind . What's behind you ? 
 There is no need to do like this . We can surf the net and find some templates for resume . 
 You said it . We can also find some helpful advice from some experts . 
 Do you want to rent a car ? 
 I think that one fits you . Do you need insurance ? 
 OK , by the way , fill the gas tank when you return the car . 
 But I don't think so . No one has ever said a word that you are to die , only yourself . That means you are not willing to die , right ? Actually , you are recovering and what you imagine as your worry is slowing down the treatment . Many cases worse than yours turned out to be hopeful and successful . You must be confident . Your condition is much better physically , but a little bi difficult mentally . The most important thing for you now is cooperation with us . 
 Of course . I am a nurse and a nurse tells the truth . 
 Mmm . Nice and crunchy . And they leave a space uncovered for you to hold ... 
 Or just stuff the whole thing in your mouth at once ! 
 Whatever . Give me another pack . 
 Good afternoon . I believe that this house is for sale . 
 May I have a look at it please ? 
 How long have you lived here ? 
 Twenty years ! That's a long time . 
 Then why do you want to sell it ? 
 How much does this house cost ? 
 That's a lot of money ! 
 Well , I like the house , but I can't decide yet . My wife must see it first . 
 Did you working in a similar position before ? 
 Could you tell me the usual procedures to handle such a case ? 
 If you act as our representative what would you do to safeguard our interest ? 
 Are you able to operate the telex ? 
 Now can you tell me if you have a good command of both written and spoken English ? 
 If you are selected for the position , you must prepare to travel overseas frequently . 
 Don't you think it's nice out ? 
 I think that it's going to rain . 
 You like the rain ? 
 I understand . Rain does make it smell cleaner . 
 How come ? 
 I would love for it to rain today . 
 Hello , there . Welcome , and what can we assist you with ? 
 Yes , we can do that . We require the original Trading Contract and also the VAT Invoice and the Commodity Delivery Documents . They all need to be in duplicate . 
 Do you have a copy of the ID card of the person who took care of the legal aspects of this ? The Legal Rep , I mean ? We also need the Loan Certificate as well . Do you have that ? 
 What's wrong with you ? 
 Do you feel tired ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . I'll have to examine you . 
 Open your mouth and show me your tongue . Say ah ... You have a bad cold . So you must stay in bed for a week . 
 Your secretary seems to think she is being harassed . 
 I wish I were , but i am deadly serious . She said you invited her to dinner last week . 
 Well , there is no problem there . But she seemed to think that you were angry when she refused , and that your motives are personal and not professional . 
 Our harassment policy requires that we have a meeting with the HR manager and Miss Brown . It's quite serious . You could be reprimanded , or even fired if we find evidence that you were pressuring 
 That's the purpose of the meeting . Sometimes a mediated conversation will straighten things out , and a little discussion and apology can calm the waters . 
 Certainly , sir . How much rent did you want to pay ? 
 $ 520 a month ? We don ’ t often have apartments as inexpensive as that.We have one apartment for $ 599 a month , on Seventh Avenue . It ’ s near the station . 
 No . it ’ s unfurnished . It has a kitchen , but no oven.There ’ s a garden in the back , but the tenants can ’ t use it.The landlord lives downstairs.Friends are forbidden in the apartment after midnight . No noise and no television after 11 
 They must have got in through the kitchen window . 
 I am afraid your diamond bracelet has gone , darling ! 
 Look ! they've taken your fur coat too . 
 I noticed they've taken our radio and left the television . 
 I wish we could , but we can't , you see , we are not insured . 
 sure , what do you need to do there ? 
 I have to exchange some money . 
 I also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account . There was a problem last week . 
 their interest rates are usually quite high . It ’ s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest . 
 Where to , sir ? 
 Please hop in . 
 It ’ ll take about 20 minutes . 
 Yes , they are . 
 Yes , it is . Are you in a hurry sir ? 
 Yes , sir . 
 I think I'd rather have tea this morning . 
 Just an English muffin . What are you going to have ? 
 Could you pass me the jacket with wide lapels ? 
 What do you think of it ? 
 Is this Mr David Richton ? 
 Hello , Mr David Richton , this is Min Wang calling from network , i am calling about the reporter position you advertised on the internet . 
 That is wonderful . 
 I know . I intent to go to the store today . 
 Which one ? 
 Oh , you mean kikois . 
 Well . I ’ ll see , sometimes the store don't have some one of new kinds of cereal . 
 Not really . 
 It's great ! 
 I wouldn't call myself outgoing . I used to be very shy when I was little , and it seems that I get a little more relaxed a-round people year after year , and have more fun in groups . 
 I don't try to get in front of people and lead them , particularly . I'd rather cooperate with everybody else , and get the job done by working together . 
 Not to put off till tomorrow what you can do today . I've found out that time and money get away very easily — you think you have them , and they're gone ! Putting things off just makes it worse later , so even if it's hard at the time , I try to get things done that day and not let them go . 
 I am ready to make my plea . 
 I plead not guilty . 
 I realize that , but I am not guilty . 
 I had nothing to do with the crime that was committed . 
 I ’ ll tell you if you let me go . 
 I am willing to tell you that information . 
 what seems to be the problem ? 
 what were you doing when it crashed ? 
 I think that might have been a virus . 
 what kind of computer do you have , a Mac or a PC ? 
 no , some people have Macs now , too . 
 PCs often crash from virus , but it's nearly impossible to get a virus from a Mac . 
 has your computer turned back on yet ? 
 did you end up losing any of your work ? 
 you should probably call the IT department and have them check your computer for virus . 
 Hey Ted , I saw this ad in the paper . You should take a look . 
 It ’ s for a job . It looks perfect for you . 
 Come on , what have you got to lose ? 
 Here , I'll help you type one up . 
 How many people does your company employ ? 
 What's your annual turnover ? 
 Can I help you sir , what do you need ? 
 Of course sir , no problem . 
 Oh , the food here really is bad . My soup was cold and meat , ur ... it was like leather . 
 I ’ m sure this one is especially bad . And the word is so unpleasant . 
 Well , I ’ m going to write a letter of complaint . 
 Why did you buy that painting ? 
 It looks like some kind of mistake . 
 Oh . Who is the artist ? 
 Oh ! How about we hang it over here where everyone can see it ? 
 Room service . Can I help you ? 
 Certainly . 
 Any drinks ? 
 I've heard that you provide very good service , so when I need a mover , I call you guys first . 
 Oh , you see , we are on the 8th floor , and moving into the 6th floor in another building . It is about 15 kilometers to get there . 
 How much will it cost in that case ? 
 Your charge is divided into two parts , the Payment in Advance and the rest . I thought that I should pay all of it before moving . 
 The damage and compensation item confuses me . Could you give some explanation ? 
 How about your present pay ? 
 What are your salary expectations ? 
 Help ! Help ! 
 I was taking a walk when a young man came at me from nowhere and snatched the bag off my hands and ran away . 
 Well , he's young , tall and thin . 
 Let me see ... my right arm ... oh , to the east . 
 Good morning ! Welcome to our office ! 
 Nice to meet you too ! I am George Williams . 
 Well , hope you will enjoy your first day ! 
 I will try my best to assist you if you need any help . 
 You are welcome . 
 Yes . My car is having problems . 
 It won't start . 
 No , thank you . I think I can handle it . 
 I will . Thanks . That's sweet of you . 
 I might need some tools though . Do you know where I can get some ? 
 Thanks . That would be very helpful . 
 OK . If you really insist , I could always use the company . 
 You look a little lost , can I help you ? 
 Well , you can ’ t give her granny panties . Have you thought about getting her some sleepwear ? We ’ Ve got these lovely , silky nighties . Or , how about a nice panty-and and-bra set . Look , here ’ s a nice satin push-up bra , and you can choose a few different styles of undies to go with it . 
 This is so awkward ... what ones do I pick ? What size is she ? 
 Just pick something and get the hell out of here . Um , I'll go with these two . This is mortifying . I just want to get this over with . She better thank me for this ... 
 Finally ! 
 What is your case against the police ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 Didn ’ t they let you go ? 
 So they kept you at the station ? 
 Did they tell you why they arrested you ? 
 I understand . 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Would you please have a look at the table ? I think this one fits you . 
 We will lodge at the indigenes ' houses . It's interesting . 
 There are such shops living on selling parts . I don ’ t like their service either . All they want is your money . But in the long run , they will be losing costumers . Anyway , car service business is new in China . We all have to control what they are doing . Otherwise , they will not improve . 
 Yes , there is . Those organizations exist . You always can call a lawyer if you need legal help . 
 OK , here you are . 
 Of course , you can . Wait a moment . 
 I'm here to ask about a loan . 
 I got married not long ago and we are expecting our first child . I'd like to buy a car for the family . 
 Could you tell me what the requirements are for that , please ? 
 Yes , I do . I was born and bred here . 
 I have all of that with me . I've also banked here for a number of years . 
 First , you fill out the application form and then we'll issue you a passbook . 
 No , Even a dollar is all right . Here's your passbook , sir , just sign your name on it . 
 It varies from time to time . At present it is 6 % . 
 By all means . But you have to deposit enough money before you can write out your checks . 
 Good for you . What items did you bid on ? 
 Your idol ! Wow ! You're even better at finding stuff than me ! 
 That's not how this game works . 
 How many bids had been placed before you ? 
 You have hit the point . It's really hard for a magazine to be well known to people of various ages and educational backgrounds . 
 To my mind , the success of Digest is in the clever selection of its articles in each issue . 
 Not too bad , I suppose . 
 Oh , she asked me all sorts of questions . She asked if I smoked , and whether I played sports , she asked me where I went to school , and what subjects I took , and she asked me if I like to meeting people . 
 Well , she asked me if my parents wanted me to be a steward . 
 No , but she told me to telephone her next week . 
 I'm looking . Can you still remember what the conductor said ? 
 But I don't see it . 
 Oh , my god ! We get off at the wrong stop . I'm so sorry , honey . 
 It's my fault . So what can we do now ? Walk ? 
 OK , you promise don't tell your mother about it , we'll take a taxi . 
 If you keep your promise , I will also let you watch Ultraman this evening . 
 I want to buy a cell phone for my daughter . 
 She is 17 . It's for her birthday . 
 Thanks , but I want to have a look at the Motorola's products . 
 Sounds perfect . I'll take the pink one . Can you pack it for me ? 
 Why not ? The Sweetheart pendant matches the cell phone well . I'd take this one . 
 Thanks . 
 I guess not . 
 Look , I want to succeed just as much as you do . Well , maybe not quite that much . 
 What are you trying to say ? 
 Honey , can you set the table ? 
 Well , make sure to put out the pepper and salt shakers . I don ’ t know if your brother is coming tonight so set an extra place mat just in case . 
 Yeah go ahead , forks , spoons and knives . I roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well . 
 Honey ? Have you seen our soup bowls ? 
 Oops ! 
 I'd like to buy a tapestry to decorate my new room . 
 These are beautiful ! Is this the marvelous landscape in Guiling ? 
 How fine the needlework is ! What's the price ? 
 It's too expensive . 
 You're right . Would you please show me some embroidery ? I also want to buy some embroidered tablecloths to match the tapestry . 
 Good morning . May I help you , sir ? 
 Do you want an international money order or a banker's draft ? 
 Could you show me where the ice cream is located ? 
 This is my first time here . 
 I'm glad I asked you . So this is aisle 6 where I can find all the canned fruits and vegetables . 
 Have you made a reservation , sir ? 
 Your name , please ? 
 I see.We had a table reserved for you.This way , please . 
 Excellent . Come in please . The washing machine is in the bathroom upstairs . It keeps breaking down . 
 About ten days ago . I ’ Ve tried to use it since then . Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn ’ t . it ’ s very frustrating . 
 Yes , it ’ s still under warranty . Over the last few weeks , it ’ s also been making a high-pitch noise when it ’ s in use . 
 What ’ s wrong with it ? 
 That ’ s great . Thanks very much . Would you like a cup of tea or coffee ? 
 Why ? It's unfair . How about going dutch ? 
 Oh , come on , I almost forgot . Don't worry about it . I didn't mind picking up the tab last time . 
 Ok , but it's only for this time . 
 It's 12 dollars 80 cents all together . But don't forget the tip , it usually 15 % . 
 Do you think I should turn down his offer ? 
 But we may not get another partner . 
 ABC Company , my name is Lucy . How can I help you ? 
 Thank you for your interest . The position is still available . Have you already sent your CV to us ? 
 It is quite urgent for us to fill this position now and I would like to stress that English is a must because of the international contacts and most likely traveling abroad very soon . If all these is not problem for you , I recommend you to mention these in your cover letter and send it to me directly . 
 Please switch work shifts with me . 
 Why can't you ? 
 Well , we've settled the question of price , quality and quantity . Now what about the terms of payment ? 
 I see . Could you make an exception and accept D / A or D / P ? 
 To tell you the truth , a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import . When I open a letter of credit with a bank , I have to pay a deposit . That'll tie up my money and increase my cost . 
 Still , there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . It would help me greatly if you would accept D / A or D / P . You can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit . It makes no great difference to you , but it does to me . 
 To meet you half way , what do you say if 50 % by L / C and the balance by D / P ? 
 Thank you very much for your invitation . 
 I'd like to say goodbye to you . 
 Do you have anything in particular that you would like our firm to take into account ? 
 No problem . We will offer you a room with one bedroom and a kitchen .. 
 what do you do when you see a homeless person on the streets begging for money ? 
 homeless youth can easily become involved with drugs and prostitution . Do you do anything to help them ? 
 that's a good idea . Do they usually accept the food ? 
 it's sad how more and more young people are sleeping on the streets in London now . 
 it's true . The economy is in a bit of mess at the moment . 
 there just isn't enough affordable housing to go around . If only the housing cost would drop , fewer people would be in financial trouble . 
 something's got to change---and it's got to happen soon . 
 I can only hope that one day they will change . 
 No , but the nurse at school says that I should have my blood pressure checked . 
 No , I have never been told that I have high blood pressure . 
 How do you check for high blood pressure ? 
 What do the numbers mean ? 
 Good . That will help me know how I am doing . 
 You can catch the 486 . 
 I believe so . 
 It only takes 45 minutes to an hour . 
 It's a pretty short trip . 
 It only gets crowded once it gets to LA . 
 No problem . 
 Oh , you know , tomorrow is Vicky's birthday . I am thinking what gift to give her . 
 It's a bad idea . Vicky has short hair . 
 Only old women like that . 
 OK . That's what I can do . 
 This is Soft , may I speak to Lamely ? 
 Hello , Lamley.Are you free tomorrow ? 
 Would you like to go to an activation with me ? 
 See you . 
 Certainly , which color do you want to dye it ? 
 Right now , many girls are dyeing there hair blond . 
 What do you think about pink ? 
 Yes , we have several brands , which one do you prefer ? 
 First , you need a shampoo , it makes it easier for your hair to be dyed . Let's down your hair in the water , you hair will be fairly clean that way . 
 You hair is definitely fresh and shiner looking . 
 What do you want to speak to me about ? 
 Oh , you do ? 
 What made you decide to volunteer ? 
 Good for you . 
 I will be voting . 
 Thanks for letting me know . 
 Let me see . En . Here is your baggage . 
 Walk ahead a little further . There are plenty of them . 
 Well , under this arrangement two parties cooperate to manufacture a product or a category of products , for example , machine tools for export . Each party produces and supplies a part of the components and parts ; one party is a Chinese enterprise , the other , an overseas firm . Most probably , the foreign counterpart contributes technology and equipment , and sometimes , parts and components , while the Chinese enterprises factory building , labor and other resources to the cooperative production . They join hands and fulfill orders together by an agreement or a contract . 
 Not necessarily . It depends on the contract stipulations . They may be marketed in the foreign country where the other party is located , or even in a third country . 
 Yes , you are right . Either party is not well-equipped to produce the final products single-handedly , but they can enter into an agreement . In such case , each side contributes different resources to make the manufacture of a certain product or a category of products possible . 
 Our terms are net 30 . 
 You would have to order in excess of 10,000 units to be eligible . 
 An option we can offer is two separate shipments.We will house the inventory until you are ready for us to ship it to you .

 May I ask why you're returning the radio ? 
 Would you like to exchange it ? 
 Certainly . This will take only a few seconds . 
 This dress is beautiful . May I try it on ? 
 What is the material of this dress ? 
 That's good . Can you give me a reduction ? 
 Do you have any cheaper ones ? 
 May I help you ? 
 Of course , we'd be happy to cash it for you . 
 Well , it's listed on the electronic board on the left . We cash it at present traveler's check buying rate . 
 The service charge is 1 % of the total amount of the check . 
 Would you please countersign them here ? 
 And your passport please . 
 Sorry , sir . We can't cash the checks for you without your passport . 
 Hi , I was wondering if you have my test results in . 
 So , basically , I am OK ? 
 What will I learn when I see the results on the website ? 
 What will the numbers tell me ? 
 Are all of my test results on that site ? 
 Mr . Tang , we have decided to hire you . How much do you expect to get a month ? 
 I don ’ t think we can give you that much as the starting salary . 
 Maybe , but there are many fringe benefits here . 
 Additional to medical benefits , we also offer a rent free house and the use of a car . 
 OK , 4000 yuan a month . 
 Not at all , it's reasonable . 
 All right . How about this one by the window ? 
 May I take your order now , sir ? 
 Our restaurant is famous for its seafood . 
 Shrimp salad is our speciality , took 
 What would you like to drink ? 
 Daddy , what's next ? What else do we do now ? 
 Great . Let's go . Where is it ? 
 We have many cookies left here . Can we use them as baits ? 
 So let's go and catch earth worms ! 
 Daddy , do you think we're gonna catch any fish today ? We've been fishing here for more than two hours , and we get nothing . 
 I love sashimi . Did mom bring any soy sauce for that ? 
 Cool . Hey , I've got an idea . Why don't we cook it separately ? Half for sashimi , and the other half for grill . 
 Well , all right . There is nothing to complain about . 
 Really ! I've never seen so much work . 
 I don't know . I have no idea . 
 I'm not good at sports , I have never played tennis , and I know I would be terrible . 
 OK , but don't say I didn't warn you . 
 Thanks.This is fun ! 
 No one has ever tried to show me how to play a sport before.Maybe I should learn to do something . 
 Do you really think I can be a good player ? 
 Yes . This has been fun . 
 Yes . I've received this Remittance Advice from the bank . 
 Mr CK Chen contacted me this morning and asked me to come in for the remittance . 
 Here you go . Can I deposit some into my account and take some in cash ? I need 1,000 RIB for my expenses , you see . 
 I've never been to a restaurant like this before . 
 That's a good word to describe it . 
 I am hungry . I think I could eat a large by myself . 
 I'm in the mood for a Californian . 
 Are you ready to order now , sir ? 
 Would you like an appetizer ? 
 Would you like some soup first ? 
 What kind of soup would you like ? 
 Have you decided on anything ? 
 How about stewed-fried steamed pork ? 
 Are you interested in today's special ? 
 Twice cooked spicy pork slices . 
 Anything else ? 
 excuse me ? How can I get to the nearest branch of the national bank ? 
 how far up the street are the traffic lights ? 
 ok . So I turn right at the traffic lights . Then ? 
 ok . Where do I go then ? 
 got it . Thank you very much . 
 Fine with me , but no more chafing dish . 
 I'd love to try some snacks . 
 Kebabs and roast squid . 
 Help yourself . 
 May's birthday is coming . Shall we buy her a birthday present or let her choose one for herself ? 
 You are such a good father . It's next Sunday . 
 What about a cell phone ? She is old enough to have one . 
 Maybe we can try shopping on line . 
 I'm sure that May would love the pink one . 
 Totally . Computers bring with them convenience.Oh , what's wrong ? 
 Oh , it's such a pain . We'd better go to a store later . 
 Do you know what kind you want to open ? 
 Do you know what the minimum balance is ? 
 You need to keep it at $ 100 . 
 That ’ s the least amount you can have . 
 We will fine you . 
 You will be fined $ 25 . 
 Er ? I am driving right now . Can you call back in 30 minutes ? 
 Thank you for calling . I really appreciate your kindness . But right now , I ’ m very busy preparing for an interview of another company . I don ’ t think I am available for this opportunity . 
 Well , I will text to you . Thank you , bye for now . 
 Shut up ... Billy ... BILLY ! 
 Wow ! What's that ? 
 It's so small that I didn't notice it . 
 Do you have shoes here ? 
 I want to buy a pair of shoes for an interview . 
 My feet is size 37 . 
 Yes , we do . They are all in this book . 
 No problem . Just give us a few minutes more to pull them up , though . We don ’ t get that many English singers ! 
 What do you think this flat ? 
 Small ? But it should be enough for our needs , I think . 
 That's true , but I love the living room , it's huge and filled with sunshine . 
 It has a great balcony with an incredible view of the park . 
 May be we could get some new furniture , better stuff . 
 Well , that was an interesting documentary ! 
 Like what ? 
 Yeah , I know it sounds weird , but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . Through a 401K , you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire , you can rest peacefully on your nest egg . 
 That seems a bit unstable don ’ t you think ? 
 I ’ Ve been thinking of doing that lately ! I don ’ t want some banker to run off with my money ! 
 What's wrong ? 
 What a pity ! 
 Why not have a visit to the zoo ? 
 Is that OK ? 
 Well , I think we'd better go now . We have to follow the guide . 
 What experience do you have with office machinery ? 
 Where do you want to be in five years ? 
 Very good . Any questions ? 
 I really like what you have . But the price for this product is much higher than we expected . I am absolutely not a buyer at that price . 
 I understand that . If you can lower the price by 10 percent , we have a deal right now . 
 Err , well , I can ’ t decide right now . Do you mind if I have a small internal discussion on this first ? I will tell you our decision this afternoon . 
 I need some more amenities , please . 
 Specifically , I'm talking about the little things , like soap and shampoo . 
 No , I'm not even halfway through my supply . 
 What's the use of going to a hotel if you don't take home souvenirs ? 
 There you go . My friends expect me to bring home souvenirs . 
 I've never paid for a hotel souvenir in my life , and I don't intend to start now . 
 Oh , what a pleasant surprise ! Don't you remember me ? 
 Right ! Glad to see you here . 
 Why don't we get ourselves a new car ? The old one's falling apart . 
 What kind shall we get ? 
 Yes , fine . 
 Why not sometime next week ? 
 OK . 
 There's a car dealer down the road.How about going there ? 
 Fine , We'll do that . 
 What's the special here ? 
 Well , let's try some braised pork , sweet and sour fish and some fried beans . 
 Just some soft drinks and only a bottle of beer . 
 Hello . Overseas operator . May I help you ? 
 Your name , please ? 
 Who would you like to talk to ? 
 Is that Mr . Edna Kent ? 
 What number are you calling from , please ? 
 And the number in Japan , please ? 
 Hold the line , please . I'll put your call through . 
 Two nights . 
 I've finished . 
 You don ’ t need to carry the furniture home because we have delivery service . 
 Wo will deliver the goods to you for free . 
 Sure . Please write down your name and your phone number . 
 No later than tomorrow . 
 Hello , is that Mr . Li ? 
 I am calling to check your information before the interview . What position did you apply ? 
 Excuse me . Could you slow down a little ? I couldn't catch you . 
 I need help in ordering my office supplies . 
 I need ink cartridges , staples , and Post-its . 
 Some of these can wait but there are a few things that I need right away . 
 We have plenty of money for office supplies . 
 I want to pick them up . 
 You too !

 Yes . But not for about 2 weeks . 
 Good evening . Would you please offer a table far from the entrance for us ? 
 Let me get the keys and we ’ ll go to look at it . 
 It ’ s the one you like .

 You ’ re welcome . Be sure to get the keys one day before you move in . 
 Excuse me , do you have A tale of Two Cities ? I'd like a copy of it . 
 Charles Dickens . 
 Ok , Thanks . 
 Sure , I can go to the store for you . What do you need ? 
 Is there anything else that you want me to pick up ? 
 Is there any other place you would like me to go to for you ? 
 Sure , no problem . Is your prescription ready ? 
 Okay , I'll pick it up for you . 
 You're welcome . 
 Yeah , I think I'll get this one-piece . 
 I'm too fat for a bikini . 
 I'll wear that if you'll wear these Speedos . 
 Mr . Blake ? Mr . Foster ’ s on the phone . He ’ d like to know if you can send over those training manuals ? 
 He was hoping that you could drop them off this afternoon . 
 Hello . Can I speak to Kevin , please ? 
 My name is Joan Harris . I ’ m calling from St . Johns Hospital . Are you still interested in a job as a service technician ? 
 I have good news for you.You ’ Ve got an interview . Can you come to the Human Resources Office on Thursday at 9 30 am ? 
 345 Stony Creek Avenue . 
 Excellent . I ’ ll see you on Thursday at 9 30 . 
 I would like to be in a managerial role , ideally working do6ely with external clients . I have worked in client-facing roles for more than two years and I enjoy the challenge of keeping the customer satisfied . I think Ifs something I ’ m good at . Finally , I ’ d like to be on the right career path towards eventually becoming a senior manger within the company . I ’ m very aware that these are ambitious goals , however I fell through hard work and dedication they achievable . 
 You are right . We ’ re hoping that this is a long-term opportunity , and just a flash in the pan . 
 Rice . 
 Because it's supposed to be good for you . 
 I'd be glad to answer any questions you may have . 
 If you consider our high research costs and excellent quality , the price we are asking is only reasonable . 
 Do you like that vintage clock ? It's almost fifty years old . 
 Well , in the fifties , that clock used to be inside a drive-in burger joint . 
 This is one of my favorite items . 
 Hi , I was wondering how I'd go about getting a credit card . 
 Oh , no , I'm afraid I don't . Is that necessary ? 
 That's done . Do you need to see any credentials ? 
 I don't have my passport on me at the moment . I'll just pop back to my office and pick it up . 
 What did you do at the office today ? 
 What kind of things did you need to check ? 
 I see . Did anything else happen ? 
 It must be difficult to remember the details for each individual client . 
 I hate dealing with complaints . Was it a legitimate complaint ? 
 You certainly had a busy day . 
 Can I help you ? 
 What size do you wear ? 
 Then please look at this suit . 
 Yes , we have some in blue , green , black and brown . 
 US $ 138 . 
 Tom , we are in the restaurant now ! 
 I'd like to see the menu , please . 
 Thanks . I am starving . Tom , what are you getting ? 
 Let me see ... What's this , shrimp rolls ? 
 Twenty five yuan is a little expensive . 
 Sounds nice . We will take this , two bowls of shrimp rolls . 
 We will have this one first and order something else later . 
 You know , I'm a pretty laid-back person . I don't like to have lots of arguments or worry about lots of things . For example , I like to keep the apartment clean too , but if it gets a little dirty once in a while , that's not a big deal . 
 Yeah , I really don't want a lot of drama in the apartment . It's important that we don't get on each other's nerves . 
 What post have you held before ? 
 How many places have you worked altogether ? 
 Sure.Let me measure for you . 
 $ 200 . The delivery time is 2 weeks . 
 Hello , this is Lucy from ABC Company . Is this Monica ? 
 I am calling to inform you that we have arranged an interview for this accountant position at 2 PM this Thursday afternoon . Please come on time . 
 Oh , you can take the subway , get off at B stop and walk north for several minutes . You will find a building . It will take about 40 minutes in total . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 I beg your pardon ? 
 Oh , I see.Since I'm a heavy smoker , may I change my seat ? 
 Oh , did you ? Thanks a lot . 
 That's all right . 
 Fine , and you ? 
 Yes . I would like some information for requesting a loan . 
 I see . So let me get this straight . If I borrow let ’ s say , ten thousand dollars , how much will I have to pay each month ? 
 It sounds good but , there is just one problem . I have a terrible credit score . 
 You know what ? I don ’ t really need the money . Thanks anyways ! 
 Yes . I am getting fat . What should I do ? 
 Good morning , can I help you ? 
 Here are several sets of furniture , including sofa , dressing table , wardrobe , and sideboard . How about this one ? 
 What do you think ? 
 I would like to purchase it . 
 Here , take my credit card . 
 Sure . Here you go . 
 Steven , what's your idea of price ? 
 I'm afraid that's impossible . You can't expect us to reduce it to that extent . 
 Price can't be separated from quality . A comparison of the quality of our products with that of rival goods will show you that ours is far superior . 
 Well , I'll have to think about it and get back to you in about 30 minutes . 
 Why are you quitting ? 
 Excuse me , would you mind taking a picture for us ? 
 It's simple . Just press the button , like this . 
 Thank you . 
 These drawings on the wall are process sheets . 
 They describe how each process goes on to the next . 
 I'm not sure when it started . But I know it's older than me . As a young boy , I used to eat here a lot . 
 Yeah . We are the VIP customers here . So , what do you want to eat today ? 
 Hey , kid , that's wrong . It's a Chinese restaurant . Let's eat something traditional . 
 The Chinese rice pudding . Your father loves it , too . You wanna try ? 
 Yes , of course . But I think they can make you a salty one , too . 
 Come on . Don's go too far . 
 OK then . We shall ask them to put some red chilli on it . 
 No , she isn't . My girlfriend hates red . 
 A classmate of mine . 
 All of the produce is in aisle A . 
 Here you go . Look in this flyer , or check with the produce person . 
 Do you have anything to declare ? 
 What's in the bag ? Would you mind opening the bag ? 
 No.You don't have to pay duty on personal belongings . 
 Did you listen to the weather forecast ? 
 There ’ s a typhoon coming . 
 Yep , it should be here by tomorrow night . 
 This is Liu Fang speaking . 
 May I have your name , please ? 
 Of course . In my opinion , you are the strongest candidate for the job . 
 I want to set up an interview for you at 9 a . m . next Monday in our company's conference room . 
 Good morning , may I help you ? 
 Please fill out this form , please . 
 Yes . You must put on its name and full address . 
 Let me check . Yes . Your one thousand remittance , please . 
 This rate is one percent . That will be 10 Yuan . 
 Generally it will arrive within a week . 
 No . That's all . You have to take good care of this copy of this transfer order . 
 have you bought a present for jim ’ s birthday yet ? 
 I ’ m having the same problem . I want to get something really special . Jim always seem to know exactly what to get people as gifts . 
 he bought me an iron . 
 maybe not , but my iron was getting old . In fact , it stopped working the week after jim bought me the new one . It ’ s as if he knew that my old iron would soon stop working ! 
 yes , I do . Let ’ s go . We should be able to find something suitable . We should get him something old ... something historic . 
 I ’ ll be happy to get him something special , even if it coasts a little extra . 
 I want to buy some meat . 
 I want one pound of ground beef . 
 That will be fine . 
 Let me also have three pounds of chicken breasts . 
 Can you tell me the total cost of the chicken breasts ? 
 That's all I'm going to get today . 
 Oh , dear . My weight has gone up again . 
 And I suppose sitting at a desk all day at the office doesn't help . 
 I do wish I could lose weight 
 I've tried diets before but they've never worked . 
 Yes , maybe I should . 
 If you bring them back with your receipt within seven days , you'll get a full refund . Also , if you need alterations to the pants , just bring them in and we'll do them for free . 
 That'll be $ 70 , please . Will you be paying by cash or charge ? 
 Okay , sir , here you are . Thank you very much . 
 We have reservations for two at your restaurant tonight . 
 I'm calling to see if I can request a specific table . 
 I proposed to my wife in your restaurant and I would like the same table if I can . 
 It was a little table by the bay windows overlooking the wharf . 
 OK , so this is our newest machine . It was only installed last year . 
 About 1,500 metres per minute . It's one of the fastest in the world . We had a few problems with it after start-up but it's running very well now . 
 If we're running at full capacity , it's 160,000 tonnes per annum . 
 Send an ambulance fast ! My husband is having a heart attack ! 
 I live on 1177 Oak lane in Smithfield . Oh , hurry , I don't know what to do ! 
 yes , yes , he's right here by me . 
 Yes , he's breathing , but he's not conscious ! Oh , please hurry ! 
 I like people who are open and friendly . Those people are usually more active and fun to be with . I like spending time with my friends . We go to bars together or play sports together . 
 I think it ’ s important to most people . The problem is that you can usually only find out if someone is honest by getting to know them . 
 if you know any of their friends . You can ’ t rely on your friends to introduce people to you all the time . You have to go out and make the first move sometimes . I also like funny people . 
 sometimes it can be hard to tell , but if you know the person fairly well , you can usually see from their expression what they are really thinking . 
 maybe people don ’ t like to have friends that are all the same . Most people like a little variety in their lives-including a variety of characteristics in their friends . 
 Let me see . That one goes for $ 17 . 
 No , I can ’ t give it to you , let you have it for 12 . How about 14 ? 
 Sorry , $ 14 is the lowest I can go . 
 Do you know how many you need ? 
 We can get started as soon as you fill out this form . 
 You won't be able to tell the difference with a magnifying glass . 
 Very good . You can pick up your order in one week . 
 We can do that , but you'll have to pay a little extra . 
 Take your mind off it . Look , Crys.This magazine is on China's top ten beauties ! 
 She doesn't have an ounce of fat on her face . 
 Not even drinking milk for one month would get us like that . 
 Look at this girl's gray dress . 
 Last time I wore extra small was when I was in fifth grade . 
 So why are you dieting this time anyway ? Another guy ? 
 The girls in this magazine are so slender . 
 True.You know , I First started dieting when I was ten . 
 Oh , no . Too much work . I hate to sweat . It's so gross . 
 What are you looking for ? 
 Walk straight ahead until you come to the second traffic light . Then turn right . 
 I can't remember , but it's the second light . 
 I'm afraid I don't . But I do know the price has gone up . 
 I'm looking for a gift for my daughter . 
 Yes , she needs something to help her at school . 
 That sounds good . How much is one ? 
 Only $ 2,100 ? Okay , let me have one . 
 Let me dig my VISA out of my purse . 
 Do I need to buy anything else ? 
 Thank you so much . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 Have you a taste for this kind ? 
 What about this ? 
 I have a lot of them . 
 OK , here you are . 
 Brian , a company called me for an interview . 
 How ? 
 Okay . 
 How expensive ? 
 I can ’ t afford too expensive , maybe $ 50 to $ 70 ? 
 How ? 
 Is a white blouse okay ? 
 Black ? 
 White pantyhose ? 
 Jewelry ? 
 How about make up ? 
 Perfume ? 
 Hi , Monica , congratulations ! Your presentation at the meeting was very successful and everyone was impressed by your speech . And it was so persuasive and I bet our clients will be convinced to invest their money in this project . You really made a big contribution to our company . 
 You must have been prepared for a long time . Some statistics in this presentation are not easy to find , right ? 
 Now , the effort pays off . You have accomplished something . 
 Hello . I'm answering the ad in the paper about your car.And I wonder if it is still available ? 
 Good.Can you give me some information about it ... uh .. mileage and the tires and things like that ? 
 I would like to have this laundry done . 
 OK . By the way , I would like to have this sweater washed by hand in cold water . It might shrink otherwise . 
 Where can I enjoy the best local food ? 
 Yes , I do . 
 Is it very far from here ? 
 Good morning . Welcome to Time After Time Watches . 
 Well , you've come to the right place . What kind of watch are you looking for ? 
 Hmm ... This Rolex ? $ 1,000 . 
 This one is $ 500 . 
 Did you enjoy your weekend at the highland hotel ? I heard it ’ s and excellent place to stay and has good facilities . 
 Do they have a swimming pool ? 
 What ’ s the service like ? 
 It sounds perfect . Did you have any complaints at all ? 
 I suppose you were happy to forget about the outside world . 
 Thanks . Was there a mina bar in the room ? 
 One of the things I dislike about hotels is that everyone expects tips . 
 My mother bought me a new video game . 
 Well , the hero is a Super Warrior . He has to fight the bad guys to find the treasure . 
 There are a lot ! Two really bad ones are Giant Monster and Human Spider . 
 It's in a dungeon , under a castle . 
 It's not easy to find . Anyway , you can come to my home after school today and try . 
 Good evening , sir . What's your pleasure this evening ? Your usual ? 
 Certainly , a beer . Here you are , sir . 
 Don't worry . I'll make you another on the house . 
 I've gotten a few . 
 I've gotten about six . 
 Yes , I've paid all of them off . 
 It's like $ 130 each ticket . 
 I got a parking ticket the other day . 
 I'm going to do that as soon as possible . 
 l love it . There is always something fascinating to discover . 
 That's not very easy to say . 
 Can you find many bargains there ? 
 Would you like a piece of birthday cake ? 
 I thought strawberry cake with cream cheese frosting was your favorite ? 
 A diet ? What for ? You are in great shape . 
 Oooo . This sounds serious . 
 This is Mary . I just want to let you know that we made an offer to you . The salary is 3,000 yuan a month , I e-mailed the offer to you as well . You can let me know within a week if you accept the offer . 
 We hope you get on board with us , Please let me know as soon as possible . 
 I'm here to conduct the annual census of foreigners living in Beijing . This is my service ID card . 
 We only need to verify your information against our records . 
 Please show me your passport and Residence Permit . 
 How long have you been living here ? 
 May I know your occupation ? 
 Is that right ? Which university , if you don't mind my asking ? 
 Everything appears to be in order . Thank you for your time . 
 It's a little sensitive , actually . I need to get hold of some money , and quickly . 
 I already have some Time Deposits with you , but unfortunately , they haven't matured yet . I really don't want to cash those just yet . 
 I've not heard of that , could you tell me more , please ? 
 Right ... anything else ? 
 And then I just sign here ? You're right ! It certainly is simple and extremely convenient . 
 I wonder if we can make payment for this order by documentary collection . 
 But our order this time is very large . To open an L / C for such a large amount at a bank is costly . Can you be a bit more flexible and bend the rule a little ? 
 To be frank , a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import . When I open a letter of credit with a bank , I have to pay a deposit . That will tie up my money and add to my cost . 
 What kind of personality do you think you have ? 
 Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ? 
 What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ? 
 What kind of people do you like to work with ? 
 What kind of people do you find difficult to work with ? 
 Plaza Hotel , good morning . Leo speaking . 
 Certainly . A single room is 120 dollars American , per night . 
 And when would you like the rooms ? 
 Arriving the 25th of September and leaving on the 28th ? Three nights ? 
 Just a minute please . 
 Yes , thank you . 
 My name is Mona White . 
 Jack Webber . 
 Sure . W-E-double B-E-R . 
 No , double B for Bravo 
 Sure . Any specific reason I should know about in case people ask where you are . 
 No problem . Good luck . 
 How may I help you ? 
 What is it ? 
 I do apologize for that . 
 I see your problem . 
 I will cancel the fees you owe . 
 You ’ ll only have to pay the initial fee . 
 I fired Mr . Li today . 
 Do I have to deposit my handbag at the checkroom ? 
 Thank you . I'd tike to buy some milk powder for my baby . Is there anything that you can recommend for me ? 
 No more than three . 
 How about its quality ? 
 OK , what is this ? 
 It is thoughtful . I will take it . 
 Yes , I can . 
 Then how about the expenses during the trips ? 
 Would you tell me where we often travel ? 
 It's great ! I like these places . 
 Yes , I can . 
 I see . 
 OK . Thank you very much for telling me all these things . 
 Yes , on Monday . 
 I'm probably going to spend the day looking at cars . 
 Yes , I am . I'd like to be able to get around a little more . 
 Oh , I don't know . Of course , gasoline costs a lot these days . 
 A lot of people do . I'll try it for a while anyway , but I certainly don't want to pay a lot of parking tickets . 
 Hmm . I see what you mean . Have you spoken with Roger ? He usually does better work than this . 
 All right . Leave these ads with me . I ’ ll speak to him this morning . 
 Yes . I am looking for a restaurant with a cheerful atmosphere . 
 Well , thanks for your help . 
 Which kind of internet connection do you want to get ? 
 There is dial-up or DEL . 
 I would get DEL if I were you . 
 It's the best choice ; plus , it won't tie up your phone line . 
 Dial-up is connected through your phone , unlike DEL . 
 Exactly . With DEL you don't have that problem . 
 Just me . I'm traveling alone . 
 Just one carry-on and one that I want to check . 
 That's right . 
 I will have fun . 
 OK . I don't mind going bar hopping with an expert like you . 
 I think I'll have a glass of wine . Let's see ... they have red wine , white wine and port . They even have sangria ! It's the happy hour special . 
 Good choice ! But , what's your favorite kind of hard liquor ? 
 Do you know how the national flag of Canada looks like ? 
 There is a maple leaf on the flag . 
 I suppose my strong point is that I like developing new things and ideas . 
 Yes , I like inventive jobs and I am capable and responsible . 
 Most of the time I'll be on a tour , enjoying the beautiful scenery there . 
 I'll go to the Yellow Stone Park , and Great Canyon . 
 Ok , do you want us to use starch ? 
 Yes , sir . Your shirts will be ready by Thursday morning . Anything else ? 
 No problem , sir . 
 We remain open from 9am till 8p m . 
 Here is your laundry ticket , sir . 
 Yes , sir . May I have your laundry ticket , please ? 
 Yes , they are ready to go . 
 No problem . 
 10 dollars . 
 Thank you , bye . 
 Let me show you , the one with curly hair . 
 are you ready for the meeting ? 
 it's challenging , but I'm enjoying it quite a bit . 
 thanks a lot . 
 well , that's part of the problem . His probation period is up tomorrow and I don't think he's ready to pass . 
 well , he was supposed to be able to learn his job in 30 days , but he just doesn't seem to know what he's doing . 
 to be honest , he has no authority . He's a hard-worker , but no one listens to him . 
 I know . It'd be great if we could transfer him to a department where he doesn't have to work with people . 
 that's perfect . I'll let him know tomorrow . Thanks ! 
 Just a moment , I'm coming.Now , what would you like ? 
 Yes , certainly.Here you are . 
 It's written in English too , in smaller print.There . 
 Right.Now , what are you having ? 
 All right , but would you be so kind as to make up your mind soon ? We're very busy just now as you can see , sir . 
 I want to go to the supermarket . 
 Let's get a shopping cart . 
 What are you going to buy ? 
 OK . I'd like some oranges . But they don't look quite ripe yet . 
 I'll take some , too . 
 OK . I'll go and buy some cakes . 
 No . Let's go over to the check-out stand . 
 Thanks . 
 Well , I'm looking for a job . 
 What kind of information do you want ? 
 Wilson . 
 Steven Michael . 
 Yes , It's Henrylee@yahoo.com . 
 Twenty-one . 
 In California . 
 Excuse me . Can you tell me where l can buy a notebook and a pen ? I need them badly . 
 That's quite convenient.Well , would you please buy me some ? I am so busy.My room number is 304 . 
 Excuse me . How much for one are these ? 
 OK . Say I was to buy four , could I get a discount ? 
 Oh , I was hoping to get one free . Like four for 75 dollars . 
 Good afternoon madam . What can I do for you ? 
 OK . Please hold on a minute . So you checked in on Monday and stayed 3 nights in single room 1005 . Is that right ? 
 OK . Here you are . If there are no questions , could we have your signature in the blank below ? 
 Here it is . We are pleased to serve you here and we look forward to seeing you again . Wish you have a good day . 
 My main duties include designing survey sheets , transferring them to the dispatchers , making telephone covering on blurred information and processing the data and doing the primary analysis . 
 First , it was how to design survey sheets according to the subjects , because we had to prevent the questions from being too influential and we must make sure that every question was balanced and equitable . Secondly , it was how to get information through telephone covering in the fastest and most effectively way , because the person doing the survey usually doesn ’ t have the patience to wait for long feedback . So the way we put up questions must be clear and direct and only by this means can we get accurate data . 
 Because this order is a comparatively big one , we would like to pay by time L / C , say , 60 days L / C . 
 But we have only moderate mean at hand . If you can do us a special favor this time and allow us to delay payment , we'd really appreciate it . 
 Thank you for your consideration . When will you let me know your answer ? 
 May I help you ? 
 Okay , that'll be $ 6.85 with tax . 
 Yes , I am . You must be Tom . Nice to meet you . 
 Be careful , Tom . Those are pretty heavy . 
 Good afternoon . I suppose you are Ms . Monica . My name is Mr . Thomas , the general manager of ABC Company . Here is my business card . 
 I am very impressed by your resume . Therefore , I am very interested to know why you ’ re willing to leave your current company . 
 Ok , I understand . But why you choose us to work for ? 
 How do you work with a team ? 
 What ’ s your long term goal ? 
 Do you want to buy a sweater ? 
 The cowl-neck pullovers are new in . It sells like hot cakes . 
 Of course . The brand is Bird and it's famous for its quality . 
 Of course . Reservations aren't necessary , but we recommend them as our restaurant can get quite busy . 
 What time ? 
 Smoking or non ? 
 What name is the reservation under ? 
 Ok . Please arrive at seven forty-five . We can only hold the table until 8,15 . 
 Well , we are sorry to hear that.May I have your name and room number ? We will deal with the matter right now . 
 Mr . Ted , I have to apologize for that and I assure you it won't happy again . 
 Yes . I want to apply for a job you posted on the Internet yesterday . 
 Service Technician . How can I apply for this position ? 
 Where is it ? 
 Okay . Thanks . 
 Yes , Mum . 
 But it's Sunday , isn't it ? 
 Hello , this is the property manager . How may I help you ? 
 What room was the leak in ? 
 Are you on the top floor , or is there another apartment above you ? 
 I will be sending someone out as soon as I can get hold of the roofer . Will you be home this morning ? 
 Fine . If you do end up going somewhere , we can just use our pass key . 
 Put it on my VISA . 
 What ’ s wrong with it ? 
 You ’ re kidding me ! 
 I only have one card . 
 I don ’ t have any cash on me . 
 I ’ ll be back tomorrow . 
 Yes , please . I'd like to start with a chef ’ s salad . 
 I'll have steak . 
 Medium . 
 Peas and carrots . 
 Boiled . 
 What seems to be the problem ? 
 Has this been a problem before ? 
 For how long ? 
 Do you only feel this way when you stomach is empty ? 
 Do you feel nauseous ? 
 Do you have regular bowel movements ? 
 Let me take a look at your abdomen . Lie down on your back and bend your knees up . OK . relax ... Alright , it seems like you have a duodenal ulcer , but we'll have to run some tests before I can be certain . You should get a good rest first and try not to strain your stomach too much . 
 Not too serious , but it'll take you some time to recover , so you'll need to be patient . 
 Do you have the ticket with you ? 
 Let me see your ID . 
 You need it to pay your fine . 
 Because , I need to see a photo ID in order to verify who you are . 
 All right , come back and bring your ID . 
 Once you pay it , your record will be cleared . 
 Extension 1616 , please . 
 Then , will you try extension 235 ? 
 Laura , what are you going to do today ? 
 What time are you leaving ? 
 Will you buy a ham sandwich for me at the store ? 
 Do you have enough money ? 
 How much do you have ? 
 That's not very much . 
 Let me give you another ten dollars . 
 Bye . 
 Yes , I'd like to buy a color TV . 
 No . Which one do you recommend ? 
 Thank you , but I'd prefer to buy a China-made set . 
 Sky worth . 
 Dodge Automobiles , may I help you ? 
 No , I'm the operator . 
 One moment and I'll check . 
 Yes.When is the next train to New York City ? 
 Aren't there any trains before ten thirty ? 
 Then one to New York at ten thirty . 
 One way . 
 How much is a soft ? 
 Then one hard seat , please . 
 Honey , could you help me operate the VD player ? It can't play . 
 I think so . 
 I'm too careless . 
 No . 
 It's a new disk . 
 Here you are . 
 What did you buy at the market ? 
 You seem to have bought the whole market ! 
 Paper-cuts are all hand-made . Let me see the paper-cuts you bought . They are all animals . 
 All right . Animals , especially Chinese zodiac , are the most common theme in paper-cuts . But there are other themes . 
 Why do you want to buy so much ? 
 I see . 
 I need a Deposit Certificate to handle some stuff in land . 
 Yes , I recalled you charging that before . And I thought it was extortionate ! Haha ! 
 OK ... so it'll come out of my account ? Well , that makes it much easier . 
 Nope . That's everything , thanks . 
 I've finished my white clothes . I need to wash the rest . 
 I can do that . Is there a special way you want them washed ? 
 Do you have a lot of clothes that need to be washed ? 
 My load isn't that big . 
 I can do this for you . Don't worry . 
 Don't mention it . 
 That ’ s about all I can spare , Karen . What do you need ? 
 She seems to be quite qualified . If it ’ s a personal problem , I ’ d prefer it if you would work it out between yourselves . 
 Wait a minute . It's $ 80.5 . 
 Sorry , sir . We accept cash only . 
 Yes , of course . I'm Jimmy White . 
 Same here . 
 It is green . Come upstairs and see it . 
 Look ! Here it is ! 
 My hat ’ s new , too . 
 It ’ s the same color . It ’ s green , too . 
 Good morning , Mr . Smith . 
 It is 9 o'clock now . 
 You have two meetings today . One is at 10 am , and the other is at 2 pm . After the meeting , you will have dinner with Mr . Brown at the Chinese restaurant in Sister Hotel . 
 No problem . Do you need the OHP ? 
 OK . Do you want to ask the receptionist to wait for our customers at the receptionist counter before the meeting ? 
 What ? Your golden watch is lost ? 
 It's an open book that it was stolen by the man in black . 
 Here we are , Ryan ! This is where we're going to celebrate ! 
 You won't need it . Tom is going to treat everybody ! 
 If it were up to Tom , we'd have the wedding in the ETV ? He loves to sing . 
 Well , uh , I'll let you decided that for you yourself . He'll be here a little later . Here's our room . 
 Let's order something to eat . What are you in the mood for ? 
 OK . How about some spring rolls and squid balls , some pork skins , and some beer ! 
 Well , I've been browsing online , but I ’ m not really sure what to do about payment . I would like to know what the most convenient way to do it is . 
 That does sound interesting . How can I get this service ? 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 Of course . 
 Some are genuine . But all our reproductions are clearly marked and priced . 
 10:15 a . m . 
 Sorry . You have to buy your ticket at the next counter . 
 Are you the loan officer of this bank ? 
 I was wondering if I could ask you some questions about a loan I want to make . 
 Thank you . See , I ’ m planning to buy a car here and I ’ m planning to use my time deposit here as the collateral . 
 Firstly , we can provide our meeting agenda before he comes . And then on the day when he is coming , we wait for him at the gate of our company's gate . 
 It's an honor and a privilege to receive a visit from such a distinguished group . 
 Maybe we should send them to the reserved hotel for a short break , meanwhile we can also raise a question on what they want to have and know . 
 Mrs . Montgomery ? I ’ Ve been trying to figure out when we should have the New Year ’ s party . Could you take a book at these dates ? 
 Well , why don ’ t we make it the thirtieth ? We can set it up from three to five . That way , everybody can just go home afterwards . 
 May I help you ? 
 Alright . Do you have your receipt ? 
 And why are you returning them ? 
 I see . Oh , wait . Ma'am , I'm sorry . These slacks were on sale . 
 I'm sorry , but we don't allow returns on sale items . 
 I'm sorry , but we usually don't do it . It is our policy . 
 Well . Let me talk to the manager for a moment . Madam , the manager says can do it this time . 
 Please show me your receipt again . 
 I will have to give you store credit , Madam . If you can find something else you like in the store , you can use the credit . 
 We appreciate your business , Madam . 
 Yes . When I saw the advertisement I thought it would really suit me . 
 I think that I'll be really good at this kind of work . In fact I learn so fast that I'll be looking for promotion very shortly . 
 A laboratory assistant helps to maintain scientific equipment , keep a check on the supplies in the store , and prepare the chemicals for experiments . 
 I suppose I'm a reasonable student . I passed all my tests and enjoyed studying subjects that interested me . 
 Maths and chemistry were my favorite subjects at school . I also enjoyed history . 
 Well , I've thought about doing the part-time Chemistry Certificate course at Technical College . I think I would really benefit from doing that . 
 Yes . I have worked part-time at a take away food store-the one just round the corner . 
 Well , I've found out a lot about this type of work and my research suggests that I would be quite capable of doing the work involved . I also think that I would be able to handle any training course reasonably well . 
 Thank you . When will I know if I am successful ? 
 Goodbye . 
 Can I speak to Miss Cooper please ? 
 Engaged.Oh , dear ! Could you tell her it's a long-distance call ? 
 How long do you think she'll be ? 
 Can I leave a message , please ? 
 Can you tell her I'm waiting to speak to her ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 What kind of jewellery do you like to have ? 
 May I show you gold ones or platinum ones ? 
 Pure gold or carats ? 
 OK . 
 1336 yuan . 
 No , thanks . I ’ m just looking around . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 What about that one ? 
 No , sir . You can sit where you like . 
 Yeah , but we still need RIB 500,000 . Maybe we can use some of our savings to pay part of it . 
 Great , so we can afford the new apartment after all ! 
 Hello , May I help you ? 
 Oh , how nice ! there are bright rooms and the house is very quiet . 
 Well , each room is 40 dollars a week . 
 When do you want to move in ? 
 Fine , I'll be expecting you . 
 Is there a vacant table for two now ? 
 Well , we would like to sit over there . Is that all right ? 
 So , who do you work for ? 
 And which side of the business do you work in ? 
 Where are DAK headquarters ? 
 Now , madam , here is the Hotel . 
 $ 15 . 
 Well , madam , the meter was not on at all . You didn't tell me . 
 I wonder if you can help me . I'm looking for a room . 
 How much is it ? 
 OK.Can I see the room now ? 
 IMPF Bank , Li Lan speaking , how may I help you ? 
 Hello , Mr Peng , how nice to hear from you again . What can I do for you today ? 
 I see . How much exactly ? 
 No , that's OK . I've got all of your information here on the screen in front of me . The money will be ready and waiting for you tomorrow . 
 Hello . Excuse me . Do you know if there's a Commercial Bank around here ? 
 Straight on , and turn right . Is it far ? 
 Thanks very much . 
 Hello . I would like to buy some business cards . 
 Two thousand would be fine . 
 All I want is the same thing on this card . 
 ... Okay , I'm finished . Here's your form and my old card . 
 Do you think you could finish it in three days ? 
 Good evening , miss . Want some socks ? 
 Yes.But I recommend you to buy pantyhose . The stockings are already out-dated . 
 I've something very unpleasant to talk with you . Upon the arrival of the first consignment , it was found that about 50 % of the sixty cases of pineapples were leaking . 
 It ’ s simply because the tins were damaged . 
 I am sorry to say it's not on the way , but during loading . The tins inside the cases were broken evidently through rough handling . 
 Certainly . Here you are . Our health authorities said they were no longer suitable for human consumption . I have to remind you that our terms are CIF Hamburg . I hope you would indemnify us for the loss , so it wouldn't be so heavy on us . 
 Hello , this is Dr Cook's clinic.May I speak to Mr.Smith ? 
 Dr Cook won't be able to see you at the time suggested.Could you make it a quarter to two ? 
 I am rejoiced to tell you that you are employed . 
 You are expected to report for on-job training on the 15th of May . Will you be there ? 
 How can I get to Lakeside Park ? 
 Will it take me straight there ? 
 Taxi . 
 Thank you . Pls hurry , I am late . Can I get to the Battery Park before 4 ? 
 How exactly do you figure out the car fare ? 
 Oh , I see . 
 Thank you . How much do I owe you ? 
 That's 20 dollars . Keep the change ! 
 Which school are you attending ? 
 When will you graduate from that university ? 
 What degree will you receive ? 
 What is your major ? 
 How have you been getting on with your studies so far ? 
 How do you think the education you've received will contribute to your work in this institution ? 
 Excuse me , do you know where the Post Office is ? 
 Is the restaurant on the right or on the left hand side of the road ? 
 OK . Do I turn on the lights or do I go straight ? 
 And do I take that road ? 
 Is there a Post Office sign on the building ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Can I help you , Madam ? 
 These are all the latest fashion . How do you like this white turtleneck one ? 
 We also have it in grey . 
 It's my pleasure . I think this pair of jeans will suit the sweater well . 
 Hello , Sara are you finished packing yet ? Do you need a hand ? 
 Make sure you have your ID card . You will need it while you travel . 
 All your important documents and certificates should be in the desk drawer . 
 Sara ? 
 Did you buy a map ? Traveling can be really inconvenient without one , and you could even wind up lost 
 Also , take these pills in case you have any airsickness , and take some cold medicine , too . How about some band-aids ? 
 Take care , dear ! Be careful ! Oh Sara , wait a minute ! You forget your raincoat and umbrella . 
 Excuse me , please.Could you tell me how to get to the No . 10 Middle School ? 
 Is it far from here to there ? 
 Many thanks ! 
 What else , Ma'am ? 
 Let me show you to the cashier's . It's 905 yuan in total . 
 Oh , it's a service charge . 
 Sorry , but we can't do that . It's store's rule . 
 Yes . 
 Here is the receipt . Wanna to have it wrapped , Ma'am ? 
 It'll be great to have you again . 
 Excuse me . Can you show me some nail-polish ? 
 That's good . 
 In my opinion , orange is very nice . 
 You're right . Well , just these two , please . 
 No , thanks . 
 Oh no . I broke your vase accidentally . 
 I bumped it by accident , but I didn't mean to do it . 
 I feel miserable . Can I give you money for it ? 
 First I was late for school this morning , and now I broke your vase . This isn't my day ! 
 I don't think so.It ' s impossible to equate wealth and happiness . 
 Of course not.Sometimes a poor man can be extremely miserable . 
 Good morning . I would like to make a reservation to Hong Kong for August 2 . 
 May I inquire about the departure time ? 
 When will the plane reach Hong Kong for the morning flight ? 
 OK . I would like to book a ticket for that one . 
 Yes , I know . What's the fare ? 
 I see . Will it be doubled for the round trip ? 
 I won't . 
 We usually eat chicken , pork and beef . You eat these meats a lot in your country too , don't you ? 
 I've heard that people in your country like mutton chops . 
 Yes , I have . I tried once when I visited your country last year . I think they were very tasty . Can you cook them ? 
 That sounds great . I'll bring a bottle of wine then . 
 No , nobody . 
 Well , to be frank , yes , I do . 
 Actually it is . Perhaps you haven ’ t noticed the sign . 
 There , on the window . 
 That ’ s all right . 
 What time would you like your wake-up call ? 
 That is no problem at all , of course . You'll get a call at 7 o'colock and another at 7 fifteen . 
 So , that'll be a call at 7 and another at 7 thirty.Do you have any other requests ? 
 Okay , sir . Sleep well . 
 Hello , Lucy . 
 Yes , I have decided to work with your company . 
 It's my honor to be one member of your company . I'd like to begin to work any time as you like . 
 No problem . Thank you for calling me . 
 Mr . Anderson , the boss wants to see you . 
 Could you arrange me to see Doctor John tomorrow morning ? 
 How about 1:30 ? 
 You have to finish your dinner before you leave the table . 
 What's the matter ? It doesn't taste good ? 
 Welcome . How can we be of service today ? 
 Well , happy birthday . If it was sent yesterday using the usual service , it should be here already . You do have an account with us , right ? 
 Please . Just to double check all the details . 
 Do you have this design with only one breast pocket ? 
 It's a pity . I'm afraid that's too loud for me.Thank you . 
 I'm glad I brought my jacket on this trip . 
 What would you like to do today ? 
 I thought we could go to some of the museums.Don ' t you want to see the museums ? 
 I don't agree . I think the Capitol building is the most famous.But okay . If you want to see the White House , we'll go see it . I'm just afraid it will be boring . 
 Can you assure the quality of this air conditioner ? 
 What if there's something wrong with it ? 
 Are you sure ? 
 So how far is the museum , dad ? 
 Finish your hot chocolate and we will go . 
 No , we will have lunch at the museum cafeteria . 
 Let's go then . On the way we have to turn right and right again at the next junction . 
 Can you see a Post Office somewhere around here ? 
 Oh good we are almost there . The museum is round the corner from the Post Office . 
 It's 89 yuan . 
 Let me check . 
 Hi , Mr.Lin . I am leaving tomorrow and I am just packing . 
 It doesn't matter , Mr.Lin . I can understand . I know you are always very busy . Work must come first . 
 Yes . And I would like to convey my thanks to you for your help during my stay here in Nanjing . 
 Me too . I am looking forward to cooperating with you again . 
 It's Flight No . 104 , Northey Airlines , which leaves at ten O'dock tomorrow evening . 
 That is so thoughtful of you . 
 Thanks a lot . My wife and I will be welcoming and looking forward to your visit . 
 Goodbye . Thanks again . 
 Well , that is the chart showing our company ’ s organizational structure . 
 Ok . On the top , Mr . Thomas , the managing director , is responsible for running the company . 
 Four . They are production department , finance department , sales and marketing department and HR department . I directly report to Mr . White . He is on a business trip and is suppose to be back this morning . Probably you will be meeting him at lunch . 
 Mr . White , too . 
 No . Um , do you carry any padded coat ? 
 Small size . 
 Whatever . You know , I ’ m thinking of a gift for my mother . It ’ s her 60 birthday next Friday . Could you give me some advice ? You are the expert . 
 Looks nice . How much do you charge ? 
 That ’ s sheer robbery . I ’ m sure you can do better than that . 
 $ 80 . 
 Yes , we have . The city is famous for its beautiful evening scenery . 
 It starts at 7:00 and lasts 3 hours . 
 Just a moment , please , while I check . That's correct.You have a double room on the fifth floor . 
 But they're hard to be disposed of . 
 Room service . May I come in ? 
 Mr . Green ? 
 OK.If you need anything , just call the Room service . 
 Just leave them outside the door . We will take care of it . 
 Did you feed the puppies today ? 
 That's good ! Just make sure to bathe them later . 
 Thank you ! You know they have to go to the vet on Saturday ? 
 Their appointment is at eleven o'clock in the morning . 
 We ’ re trying to get donations . 
 We ’ re getting donations for the campaigns . 
 As much as we can . 
 We ’ re just going door to door . 
 Do you have any suggestions ? 
 That is a good idea . 
 Hi , Juliet , I'm treating Mr.Li and his team members from Galp to dinner tomorrow evening.Where do you think I should take them ? 
 That's a good idea . Which one do you recommend ? The Pairszone ? 
 We'll go to the place . Could you book a table for 4 at 7 PM ? 
 So , are we all behind this new project ? 
 Ditto , it doesn't look too expensive either . 
 I can't see a problem . Let's give it a try . 
 Yes , I ’ m here to see Joanna Stevens . I have an appointment at four . 
 Sure , it ’ s Josh O ’ Neil . 
 Yes , a coffee would be nice , thank you . 
 Hello . Mr . Rodriguez ? 
 Yes , sir . I ’ Ve just dropped those slides off at the Winthrop office . Do you need anything else while I ’ m out ? 
 Have you any beef today ? 
 How much is it a pound ? 
 Good . I'll get three pounds of it . 
 The bracelet is so well suited to you . It looks very nice . 
 Are you ready to order , sir ? 
 Do you want anything to go with soup ? 
 I need a suggestion for a restaurant here in Manhattan . 
 My date's very sophisticated , so I'm sure she would expect nothing but the best . 
 No , thank you , I want to go out on the town . What other ideas do you have ? 
 That sounds like a good place to take a date . Can you make a reservation for me ? 
 Hello , is this apartment management ? 
 Yes , this is the tenant of apartment ten . I guess my kitchen sink is clogging up again , and so is the bathtub . 
 Um , I'd really appreciate it if you send someone over to fix it today . It's really a bother . I can't cook or take a shower . 
 Thanks , I appreciated it . 
 Sure . At what time ? 
 I am sorry , sir . We are booked until 9:10 . 
 How many undergraduates are hired here each year ? 
 I see . What kind of backgrounds does the staff have ? 
 Good morning , Madam , can I take your order now ? 
 Anything else ? 
 How about drink ? 
 Please wait a moment . 
 OK . What's up , Madam ? 
 OK . 
 Yes , anything wrong ? 
 Yes , I see . 
 There's a question I want to ask you . 
 Which leg do you want to have , right leg or left one ? 
 Why do you say so many thanks ? 
 How about overtime work ? 
 Do you like regular work ? 
 How is your computer skill ? 
 What kind of software can you use skillfully ? 
 What are the requirements to apply for the position ? 
 Do you think my educational background suits this position ? 
 Does this job require that new employees take any kind of training course ? 
 Could you tell something about the job ? 
 Oh , I see . I believe I can do the job well . 
 We have a dinner reservation for four at 7:00 under the name of Foster . 
 Thank you . Would it be OK if we have a cocktail while we are waiting ? 
 I would really prefer an outside table . Would that be possible ? 
 Sure , that would be great ! Thank you ! 
 Yes , I would like a vodka gimlet , please . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Well , we want to have the largest share . Our company is much larger than yours , and we have been in business longer . 
 What are you thinking about ? 
 Then , what would make you feel more comfortable ? 
 Are you planning on voting ? 
 Yes , but this will be my first time voting . 
 Yes , and I have no idea how to do it . 
 I don ’ t know any of the laws they ’ re trying to pass . 
 I didn ’ t know that . 
 That ’ s good to know . 
 Would you like anything else , sir ? 
 Certainly . Would you like your coffee with your dinner or later ? 
 Of course . 
 Well , I attend an aerobic class three times a week . 
 No . And on the contrary , I feel young , fresh and energetic . 
 Since it's your first time to Vienna , I think you should go to the concert . 
 Have a nice evening . 
 Tom has gone to lunch . 
 Do you want me to have him give you a call ? 
 He should be back in about forty minutes . 
 The aroma of roasting coffee beans . 
 Green beans . They pop and turn brown when you roast them . 
 This machine roasts the beans just right . If you roast them too long , or the temperature is too hot ... 
 Bob , did you see our supervisor ? I need him to sign this paper . 
 What's up ? 
 Thanks for the warning . 
 I love breathing fresh air in the suburb places , while sitting in the morning sunshine . 
 Yeah , just return to nature and feel the thrills of its beauty . 
 Sure . The sunny days of spring are ideal for outdoor gatherings . 
 OK , you go back to our car and fetch the picnic stuff . 
 Nothing special . Food , drinks , and Daniel's kangaroo toys . 
 He said he would like to be our tour director and he lined up many things to do . 
 Science ? What are you talking about ? Forget about your science , OK ? It's a picnic ! 
 I can't agree on that . Just cut it out . Give him a break and don't spoil the day . 
 Hey , Robert , that's a nice shirt you are wearing . Where did you get it ? 
 That's nice . Do you know you can get one at the wholesale market near the zoo for a much lower price ? 
 True , learning how to haggle the price is one of the things people have to pick up when they come to China for the first time . 
 Yeah , I have the same feeling . Also there is another thing that bothers me the quality . Things in a department store are usually quality-guaranteed . But at a wholesale market , you never know whether what you are buying are of good quality or not . 
 I understand . While it's always good to follow the local customs , I guess there are exceptions . 
 No , I don't . Please . 
 Of course . And 2 - week paid vacation a year , a 5 - day work week . 
 I'm glad that you could get back to me so fast . 
 I needed to talk to you about your son . 
 He was acting up in class one day last week . 
 He wouldn't stop talking throughout the class . 
 If you could , would you please talk to him ? 
 I really appreciate your help . 
 No . I am Canadian . Are you Chinese ? 
 Nice to meet you , too . Let me show you around . 
 About two years , but it seems as if I got here yesterday . 
 I can't wait to see the expression on her face when we dump her . 
 Don't worry . I'm patient , but vengeance will be mine . 
 Hi . I'm looking for some good deals on produce . 
 Can you describe a mango to me ? 
 Do I eat the seed ? 
 What's the price of these mangoes ? 
 Tell me what they taste like . 
 Do I need to buy them ripe , or will they ripen at home ? 
 Where do mangoes come from ? 
 Hello , can I speak to Alice , please ? 
 Thank you . 
 Could you tell her Tom Green called ? 
 Well , let's have your firm order . 
 Your price is rather high . We cannot accept it . Can you bring the price down a little ? 
 I can't agree with you . We have quotation from other sources too . Their prices are lower than yours . 
 It doesn't seem very hopeful to close the deal on this price . 
 Of course . Is the dinner still on ? 
 We were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice . 
 It can't be that bad . 
 Really ? I never would have guessed . The criminals must only come out in the evenings , because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime . 
 Ok , we will . How do you get around in the evenings ? 
 Has anything else happened to you ? 
 Well , we'll be careful . Thanks for letting me know . 
 Well , what game do you want to play ? 
 Do you know how to play it ? 
 OK . Teach me how to play the game . 
 Thank you very much , Mr . Smith . I am very happy that I ’ ll be a member of your team . May I see the agreement first ? 
 OK , thank you . Well , I find that the salary level in this agreement is not like what you have said in the interview . Can you give me some explanations ? 
 Can we add up this item to the agreement ? 
 No , thank you . Shall we sign the agreement now ? 
 Thank you . I'll work hard . 
 Certainly . May I see your social security and your ID Please . 
 Oh . Current account don ’ t pay our interest . 
 It ’ s primarily design for business transactions . That is write checks to pay the bills , buying things and sending money . We won ’ t expect a large amount of deposit in current account . 
 May I bring you a salad ? 
 Rose-petal salad . 
 Hello , Shogun Restaurant . 
 Of course , what evening will you be joining us on ? 
 What time would you like the reservation for ? 
 For how many people 
 Fine , I can seat you at 7 
 See you at 7 
 Good afternoon . What can I help you with today ? 
 The maturity date isn't for another 10 weeks . Are you aware of that ? 
 The regulations state that the interest is paid at the rate of a Current Deposit , so unfortunately you will lose some interest . 
 May I take your order now ? 
 How would you like your eggs ? 
 And your toast , light or dark ? 
 Now or later ? 
 Will there be anything else ? 
 One hard-boiled egg with toast and orange juice to follow . 
 Just a moment , please . 
 Yes , can you recommend some steak ? 
 OK I will try it . Do you have a small portion ? I am afraid I can't finish the large one . 
 What else should we do now after the floors are done and after the furniture is in ? 
 I'm the painter . You can be in charge of going to curtain shops to choose curtains . That will probably be pretty expensive too . Having good curtains made isn't cheap . 
 Absolutely not . The windows must be measured , and then the curtains need to be made professionally . So that will take a while . Maybe a month or so . 
 We need to find an interior decorating company to redecorate the kitchen . I believe in Portland there are shops that specialize in kitchen renovation . I will look in the Yellow Pages . I'd like a kitchen mostly in ivory and light green . 
 Me ? Cook our dinners ? Hah ! You will be cooking , dear . You will cook . 
 Well , I suppose we'll have to hire a cook then . So you won't be able to afford any clothes next year . 
 Maybe I'll cook once or twice a week . How is that ? 
 We'd better cover the porcelain ware against All Risks . 
 I'd like to have the insurance of the goods covered up to 130 % of the invoice amount . 
 That's understood . 
 You're so careless , Billy . 
 I've done it for you . 
 Yes , I want to buy a suit . 
 Yeah , it's quite cute . I don't think it will fit me . I would prefer a darker color . Have you a black one ? 
 Excuse me . I would like to book a table at 13:00 . 
 Three seats , please . 
 Speed Airlines Reservation . May I help you ? 
 Yes . Flight DP336 leaves at 15:16 . Is that all right ? 
 No , Sir.It has an hour layover in London . 
 I feel like to wear my hair in this way . 
 Do you think it's suitable for me ? 
 Even though I really like it , it's just too modern for me . 
 Okay then . And I also want to have my hair colored . 
 Claret-red . 
 How long will it take ? I hope it won't be too long . 
 Now it's my son's turn to wait . 
 Of course , ma'am , Tell me where to go . 
 All right.There we go . 
 I ’ m so happy about that . 
 I sure did . How about you ? 
 I have complete confidence in our new President . 
 I know he will help change America . 
 I feel like things are already changing , because he was elected . 
 I ’ m not worried about our country now that it ’ s in his hands . 
 But this is how I like them , Mum . They ’ re just beginning to look right . 
 I think it might be a good idea to work as a guide . 
 Three Gorges of the Yangtze River . 
 Good morning , Textile Import & Export Company . 
 That's all right . Maybe we can make another arrangement . 
 I'm afraid there's a bit of a problem . In fact , he's booked up the whole week except tomorrow afternoon . 
 I'm terribly sorry , Mr Miller , but Mr . Zhang is really busy this week . 
 Please let me check . Tomorrow afternoon - Yes , he'll be free from 2:00 tomorrow afternoon . Do you think it's convenient for you ? 
 Good afternoon , madam . Can I help you ? 
 Do you have reservations with us ? 
 Sorry , madam . We don't have vacancies at the moment . 
 Sorry , I'm busy . Why don't you ask Alice ? 
 What'll it be today , sir ? 
 Shall we check your oil and tires ? 
 ( The attendants fill the tank , clean the windscreen , and add some air to the tires . ) All right , sir , that'll be $ 26.50 . 
 Northwest Airline . 
 May I have your flight No . , PLS ? 
 Yes , that's our regular flight to Shanghai . What's your name , PLS ? 
 One minute . Oh , yes , here we are . You are flying economy class , aren ’ t you ? 
 Okay , you are all set , Mr . Armstrong . Enjoy your flight ! 
 Excuse me , I want to go to Galion by ship . Is there a ship to Dalian ? 
 What time does it leave ? 
 Could you please tell me about the cabins ? 
 Then where can I catch it ? 
 Thank you . 
 Yes . We charge 50 cents for iced water . 
 Sure . Do you need anything else ? 
 I'll put all that into the bag for you . 
 No , there's no charge for those . 
 Yes , I have many things to buy . I would like to choose the cleaning milk first . 
 Dry . That's my problem . 
 Sounds good . What about shampoo ? I would like to buy the product that prevents scurf . 
 Is it a newcomer ? 
 I do not care the brand as long as it works well . 
 I want to buy the toothpaste , the brand of Jiajieshi . 
 Can I take your order ? 
 What kind of drink do you want with those meals ? 
 You can super-size your meals for only three dollars extra . 
 How about anything for dessert , like an apple pie or ice cream ? 
 Do you have any work experience in this field ? 
 What have you learned from the jobs you have had ? 
 Does your current employer know you are looking for another job ? 
 What is your impression of your present company ? 
 What would your current colleague say about you ? 
 Good afternoon.madam.How can I help you ? 
 I am sorry to hear that.Would you mind coming with me to my office and tell me what exactly happened there ? 
 Well , in that case . I will call the manger , you can talk directly with him . 
 OK.Here you are . 
 No , I don't . 
 Yes , I have two cartons of cigarettes , one bottle of whisky . 
 No , this is the medicine for the stomach . 
 Yes , sir.Go ahead.Here you are . 
 Yes . Show me the sweaters , please . 
 Well , could you bring me all the styles of pullovers ? I am not quite sure which one I will buy . 
 My parents are always saying I am not good enough . 
 They say my hair is too long , my room is too dirty and I am not good enough at school . 
 I don ’ t think they are right . I have tried my best and that's enough . It is unfair that they are always saying these thing . Sometimes I even feel deeply hurt . 
 $ 70 , madam . 
 OK , here is your change . 
 You mean the network connection ? 
 I have the same question . I can ’ t send out mails . We ’ d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately . 
 Look , Jim . That man just fell down over there . 
 Sir ... sir ? Are you all right ? Sir ? 
 Oh , no . He ’ s not breathing , and there ’ s no pulse . Call 911 . 
 Welcome to China , Mr . Martin . 
 I am very glad that you say so . We have prepared a typical Chinese dinner this evening . 
 My pleasure . 
 Of course , I have Monday or Tuesday available . What day would be best for you ? 
 Very well then . Are mornings or afternoons best ? 
 I will have my assistant check my calendar and get back to you with the exact time . Can you bring me an outline of the project when you come ? 
 Do you think that we should include the entire committee in the meeting or just our sub-committee ? 
 OK then , I will make the arrangements for them to attend . Do you know how to get there ? 
 Fine , we will make sure that we send you all of the information that you need . See you there ! 
 Hi , Mary . Lily wanted me to buy her some things for the party . 
 It ’ s pretty bad . 
 I am glad I did not drive a car . 
 Sorry , sir . Dinners are available 20 minutes , drinks are served throughout the flight . 
 What's the most popular paper circulating in the community ? 
 Oh , thank you . I want one . 
 Do you sell washing machines ? 
 Is that a Danish machine ? The name looks Danish . 
 Sure . I ’ d like to see how it washes . 
 Please dissolve the powder in hot water . Soak your hand or foot in it for 20 minutes twice a day . 
 Put the eye-drop into your right eye 4 - - 6 times a day , 1 - - 2 drops each time . Squeeze a bit of the ointment on your eyelid every night . 
 You're welcome . 
 Come in please . 
 How long will it take ? 
 Well , would you please come back fifteen minutes later ? We are to visit the Tower . 
 You look upset , is there anything wrong ? 
 What is it ? 
 Oh , that's too bad ! I am sorry to hear that ! 
 What's the matter with my wife ? 
 I guess so . It was very terrible when she was at the onset of the illness . I am worried that I would lose her . 
 I know . But is she out of danger now ? 
 Thank you very much , Doctor . 
 How large is the plant ? 
 It ’ s much larger than I expected . When was the plant set up ? 
 Congratulations ! 
 How many employees do you have in this plant ? 
 Does the plant work with everything from the raw material to the finished product ? 
 That ’ s fine . 
 Oh , I see . You ’ Ve already decided , have you ? Now , you listen to me , you ’ re only 19 . 
 Oh . So you think you can just do whatever you want , do you ? 
 Can you tell me the results of my home inspection ? 
 I never had a home inspection before . 
 I asked the owners , and they said that everything was great with the house . 
 I heard that the owners must fix all of the problems before the escrow closes . 
 What kinds of things did you discover in my home inspection ? 
 Hi , Mark ! Hi , do you have a minute ? 
 Sure , no problem . Can we fix a time to talk later ? 
 Ok , see you 10 o'clock next Monday ! 
 I can't find proper parking space . 
 No , there's no parking sign .

 Employees will also have housing payment reserve funds .

 Hey , daughter . Let me ask you something . 
 Do you have life insurance ? 
 You have children now . What if something , god forbid , happens to you ? 
 A 10,000 dollar policy shouldn ’ t be too expensive . Here , call my agent . He will give you a good deal . 
 I can write computer programs , I have a good command of secretarial skills . 
 I have a doctor license and a driving license . 
 I passed both the Cambridge Examinations ( First Certificate and the Certificate of Proficiency in English ); and studied for a year in London at the Lucas Secretarial College , ending with speeds of 120 words per minute in English shorthand and 50 words per minute in typing .

 How big is it ? 
 Well , actually I prefer something a bit bigger if that's possible . 
 How much is it ? 
 What's it like ? 
 It sounds interesting . Can I go and see it ? 
 I may go grocery shopping later . 
 I don't think we have any food . 
 What food are we out of ? 
 Could you look for me ? 
 What would that be ? 
 Would you please make a list for me ? 
 In case you didn't know , I'm checking out in half an hour . 
 That's good to hear . Now there's still a whole New York day ahead of me . 
 I still have time to explore more of New York , but I need a place to secure my baggage . 
 A deposit , huh ? I would think my baggage would be enough of a deposit . 
 That deposit bothers me . Give me a minute .

 You are speaking with Ryan . How can I help you ? 
 What seems to be the problem ? 
 When did you get that ? 
 What are you doing for it ? 
 Good . You probably should be much better by tomorrow . 
 Yes , that is me . Nice to meet you , Monica . Welcome on board ! 
 Well , we have nicer things than that in this company . You will find out soon . 
 Well , I bet you will love them too . If you need help , just ask me any time . I am in the next door . You can also reach me through the extension 508 . 
 He's going too slow . 
 Do you need help with something ? 
 Do you see anything that you like ? 
 That is a wonderful choice . 
 It's very inexpensive , and it has all the appliances . 
 The fridge and freezer is very spacious , and it also has an ice maker and water dispenser . 
 Take a look inside . 
 Excuse me , do you have a vacancy ? 
 Well , I would like to book a single room . 
 5 days . From Feb . 13 to 18 . 
 I ’ m on my way to work . 
 I work at the polling place . 
 I do this every year . 
 I applied online . 
 I enjoy working there every year . 
 They pay just enough . 
 I was able to contact them so , if you ’ ll step into my office , we ’ ll talk . 
 They want you to pick up the cost of the home inspection , but they accepted your offer . 
 It can cost between five hundred and one thousand dollars . 
 Yes , you get to choose . I would spend a little more to get a really thorough inspection . 
 I am going to contact the sellers immediately . They were looking forward to your acceptance . 
 Yet Julia is not a patch on Anne because she's not as diligent and clever as Anne . 
 How much does this cost ? 
 Excuse me , madam . May I see your ticket , please ? 
 Where are you going ? 
 Where did you begin your journey ? 
 OK . Here you are . 
 We'll get there around 7:45 in the morning . 
 Mr . Smith , welcome to our factory . 
 You'll know our products better after this visit . 
 First of all , you should pay attention to what you eat . Don't eat too much food with high calories , such as chocolate , ice cream and the like . 
 Stay away from fried foods . Fried foods are fried in oil or fat . 
 Do not be a couch potato . You should do more exercise . 
 What can I do for you , Miss ? 
 Well , here is a perfume kind for women . 
 How about this Isawell's flowery perfume ? 
 Do you have green tea perfume ? 
 May I have a look at this ? 
 I like this fragrance . 
 150 yuan . 
 Excuse me . My name is Richard Davis of Magic Office Supplies . I'm here to see Mr.Chen . 
 Thank you for calling ABC Company , may I help you ? 
 Sorry , we have two Smiths , Robert Smith and James Smith , which one would you like to speak to ? 
 He is on the line . 
 Sure . You mean this one ? 
 It ′ s a state-of-the-art piece of equipment , sir . With a gigantic 16.1 USGA TFT screen , 2.8 Ghz mobile processor , generous 512 MB RAM , removable 80 GB hard drive , convenient CD-RW / DVD combo drive , stunning fast graphics board with 64 MB DDR DRAM , dual battery capability , integrated Fast Ethernet card , IEEE 1394 digital interface and eight USB ports , it has all the power of a desktop computer packed into an ultra-slim notebook ! 
 The regular price is $ 2980.00 , but until December the 31st it ′ s on sale for just $ 2,699 . 00 . 
 Where you can buy lots of paraphernalia ? 
 Cool ! 
 So , you're going to use Sarah's car to go cruising for chicks ? 
 Peter , I hope you will accept my quotation for the air freshener . 
 I have cut the price the minimum . You know our freshener is a patent product , different from other kinds of fresheners . We could not have quitted it at such a low price if it were not for your past large orders . This price , actually , leaves us with a very small profit . 
 The low price I'm offering you is as low as I can go . 
 I'm sorry , Peter . I hope you'll continue to approach us on other occasions if you cannot accept our offer now . 
 What did you say ? 
 Well , I feel a little tired . 
 Then can you wait a few minutes ? I want to finish writing this letter . 
 It won't be long . No more than ten minutes . Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you in the park ? 
 What ? Your diamond ring is lost ? 
 It must have been stolen by the few thieves . I ’ ll get it back for you . 
 Hello , may I speak to Mr.Baker , please ? 
 This is Jones . Can I leave a message ? 
 Please tell him to call Mr.Baker at the Grand Restaurant . It's urgent . 
 Thank you . 
 Is this the first time you've come to our city , Mr . Ross ? 
 I am so honored to hear that . Well , after staying here for several days , you must have some ideas about our company . We have been in the clothes field for many years , and yours brand is also well-known in the country . How about our cooperation ? 
 We intend to establish business relationship with your company on the basis of equality and mutual benefit . 
 Certainly . As you can see , we have several three-piece suites on sale . Feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are . 
 Yes . The price has been reduced by 50 % . It ’ s a real bargain . 
 Those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you ’ re reading or watching tv . How big is your living room ? 
 I ’ d suggest you buy two . That allows you to change the brightness of the room better . 
 Steven , it's ten o'clock . I'm going to bed . I'm beat . 
 Oh , can't you do it tomorrow ? It's already past 10 . 
 Okay . Please close the door to the basement before you go to bed . I don't want the dog down there tonight . 
 Good night . 
 Yes . I'll have a room free next week . 
 12,000 a year , but you can't get visitors to live in . 
 Could you come back later ? We're right in the middle of dinner . 
 Unfortunately , I missed a chance to see a classic movie . 
 It's my favorite . 
 I like Indian food as well . 
 Irrevocable letter of credit , of course . It's the normal terms of payment in international business . 
 You might consult your bank and see if you could reduce the required deposit to a minimum . 
 Well . As you understand , the irrevocable L / C gives the exports additional protection of the banker ’ s guarantee . We always ask for L / C for our exports , and the other way around , we pay by L / C for our imports . We only accept L / C for regular orders . 
 Hello , I ’ m the landlord . John Taylor . 
 Please , call me John . 
 Sure . Come on it . We just finished rebuilding everything . 
 No , we ’ re going to get that done next week . 
 Thank you . 
 That ’ s right . 
 Yeah . But why don ’ t you come by your office tomorrow to sign the lease ? 
 Thank you . See you tomorrow . 
 Excuse me . 
 Um , this steak , I asked for to be medium rare . 
 Well , I ’ m afraid it isn ’ t . It ’ s a bit too well done and rather tough . Would you mind changing ? 
 Yes , that ’ s all right . Thank you very much . 
 Tea and silk . 
 Preferably at the big department stores . 
 Good morning , I am Monica . Are you Mr . White , the manager of finance department ? I am the newcomer and also working in the finance department . 
 Thank you . I am very happy to have my own office now . I ’ Ve never had one before . It is very nice . 
 Really ? What could that be ? 
 That is very kind of you . Thank you very much . 
 It's a document from the seller to the buyer . It contains full particulars of the goods sold , such as quantity , quality , price , forwarding particulars , and terms of payment . 
 Four . They are Loco invoice , FOB invoice , CIF invoice and Franco invoice . 
 By Loco invoice , the price includes only the cost of goods at the warehouse of the seller . By FOB invoice , the price includes the cost before the cargo is delivered . By CIF invoice , the price includes all the expenses of cost freight and insurance . The price in Franco invoice includes all expenses to destination . 
 Good evening , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 Well , we have baby-sitting service . We will take good care of your baby . 
 Please fill out the table . 
 No , we have an easy-payment plan . One-third down , and the balance in six months . 
 Certainly . Would you sit here please ? I'll call our credit manager . 
 It's just a formality , but for hire purchase we usually require references . 
 Perhaps your employer could supply us with one . 
 Certainly . A simple letter from your bank would be quite satisfactory . 
 What ! That sounds perfectly ridiculous ! Labour Day is a holiday for everyone , not just laboring staff ... and we get a whole day off tomorrow anyway , so what's the point of an extra hour tonight ? 
 So if we did allow the laboring force to go home early , how many people are we talking about ? 
 Hi , Paulo . How are things going ? 
 That's good news . What stage are you at now ? 
 Good afternoon , Pan Am . May I help you ? 
 Please wait a moment . Let me check for you.The flight is FW 711 and it arrives at 10:00 am . 
 14 hours . 
 Are you being served , madam ? 
 Sit here please.How would you like your hair done ? 
 Do you want a cold-wave or perm ? 
 Hello , and welcome to IBA . Which service do you require ? 
 That's no problem ; I can take care of that for you . 
 If it's this kind of consultancy service , I'll have to direct you to another department , I'm afraid . 
 There are many services you can choose from . Why don't you take a look at this leaflet while I find someone who can help you ? 
 This'd better be good . I'm about to fire you all and find another company . 
 Mmm , smells good . Sure better than my instant . But please don't tell me this is another coffee-themed pitch . I thought I told you ... 
 Peter , listen to the lyrics of this song . 
 It's from the musical that is so popular in New York right now . Do you like it ? 
 That's why it is so popular . It was recorded by Barbara Tutin . I've heard that when she sang this song on stage the opening night , she created quite a sensation . 
 Well , then , you need an introduction . The school drama club is putting on a musical production . How about going together ? 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Yes , sir . Is there anything wrong ? 
 No problem , sir . We will arrange you a table for 5 . 
 Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 I'm awfully sorry , sir . I do apologize . A ten-year-old boy and a mother live upstairs . Maybe the boy is a little bit naughty . 
 No problem , sir . We'll manage it . 
 Yes , I am looking for a suit . 
 Can I have a black one over there ? 
 Congratulations ! By the way , have you had all the things ready for the interview ? 
 That's not enough . You have many other things to prepare . 
 Besides the resume , you also need the original and copies of your graduation certificate and your ID card . 
 Also several copies of your one-inch color photos . 
 You also need to prepare formal clothes for the interview ; a suit should be the best . 
 Have a briefcase ready with all your interview materials in it for easy carrying . 
 All these should be enough . Good luck ! 
 Hello ? Can you help me ? My computer ! Oh man ... 
 I turned on my laptop and it broke ! I mean , the monitor went black ! 
 I don ’ t feel sick , ... let me check ... Nope ! No fever , I ’ m fine . 
 Phew ! . . . Wait a minute , CRASH ? ? ! ! Spyware ? Trojans ! What ? where ? when ? ! 
 When did you last time have your eyes checked ? 
 Come over here . I will test your eyes . First cover your left eye like this , and when I point , please read the chart from the top , and go as far as you can telling me which way the “ E ” points . 
 Good . Now the other eye . 
 Never mind , just read as far as you can . 
 I wonder if we can change to Channel 5 . 
 I want to know what's on that channel . 
 There is a football match . 
 OK . Could you turn it down ? 
 I'm going to listen to the radio . 
 I am really interested in buying this television . 
 How much are you selling it for ? 
 You can't be serious . 
 That's too expensive for me . 
 You can't go down on the price ? 
 I'll buy it for $ 2000 . 
 What are you doing ? 
 Come on ! Stop being so vain . You look great ! You are beautiful ! 
 I don ’ t see any wrinkles or sagging skin ! You are 25 , stop being ridiculous . Besides , I think that people who get Boto , have facelifts , or tummy tucks look weird . It doesn ’ t look natural . 
 I think you need to get brain surgery . I honestly don ’ t think you need cosmetic surgery . You look amazing . 
 You don ’ t need plastic surgery to do that . You are fine the way you are and you have guys drooling all over you ! Plus , plastic surgery hurts ! 
 Yeah ! When I got my nose job I was black and blue for a week ! 
 Hi , Ms . Seymour ? It ’ s Allan Parker . I ’ Ve been waiting to call you and thank you for all your help last week . 
 Well , I want to let your boss know that she ’ d better hold on to you ! You ’ re a hard worker ! 
 It's at 7:30 a . m . 
 Well , let's try a size ten . ( He gets another pair and the customer tries a shoe on ) Looks like a perfect fit . 
 I'm sure they'll be fine once you break them in . 
 Thank you , ma'am . It's been a pleasure doing business with you . 
 What do you need to buy ? 
 Where are you going to go look for one ? 
 You don't know where you want to look for one ? 
 Do you want to know where I got mine from ? 
 I purchased mine from IKEA . 
 Not at all , but you get what you pay for . 
 Sure . At what time ? 
 Let me see ... Sorry , sir . We are fully booked tonight . Would you mind making a reservation some other time ? 
 Yes , sir . 
 So how's everything going for Christmas ? 
 What's that ? Don't tell me you've still got Christmas cards to write , it usually takes my wife a month to write all of ours . 
 He still doesn't know that Santa isn't real ? How old is he , eight ? 
 You think it's better that he should be told ? 
 That happened to my oldest girl . She became really upset when her classmates told her Santa wasn't real . 
 Well , when you tell him , be gentle . It's hard for kids to find out something like that . 
 Hello , this is John . I wanna speak to Linda , please . 
 Hi , Linda . I want to invite you to a dinner tomorrow evening . 
 At seven thirty pm , Longing Chinese restaurant.And I'll go to your home and pick you up at 7 . 
 No , have a nice day ! 
 See you . 
 Something awful happened . We went to the Portobello Road , and someone stole my handbag . 
 No . Only a few pounds . But my passport was in the bag . That ’ what I ’ m really worry about . 
 I ’ d better go tomorrow . 
 Hello , May I help you ? 
 Oh , how nice ! there are bright rooms and the house is very quiet . 
 Well , each room is 40 dollars a week . 
 When do you want to move in ? 
 Fine , I'll be expecting you . 
 Are you still hungry , Ryan ? How about some more squid balls ? 
 Wow ! You really like fruit , huh ? You've already had 3 plates ! 
 Well , whatever suits your fancy . I'll press the service button again . 
 oh , Iris ! what was it about this time ? 
 I believe she was right . You must know that fried foods contain a lot of fat . 
 I think you'd better take her advice since health is the greatest wealth . 
 well , that's true . 
 she also believes in healthy diet . And she requires us to have regular meals . 
 Oh , i am grateful for my mother on this point . her idea of healthy eating helps me a lot keeping fit . 
 not really . I may have some occasionally for a chance . But I don't indulge myself too much . 
 it's pretty simple , Iris . Just keep it in mind that you're what you eat . 
 We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments . 
 We need to find a good realtor . 
 What do you mean ? 
 But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles . 
 I still think we should have a realtor . We're new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house . And also , the realtor will inspect the house . He can tell us if the house has any problems . 
 So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ? 
 And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ? 
 Why ? 
 Hmm . It all sounds very complicated . 
 I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like . 
 So , got any more ideas for the website ? 
 But we registered at Macy's . People can just buy gifts there . 
 You're right . They can discuss what to get and avoid buying the same things . 
 Any other ideas ? 
 And we were going to make a collage for each of us using our baby pictures ... 
 No . He has no idea what a fat little pig I was ! 
 What are you thinking ? 
 Well , what kind of dessert do you want ? 
 Do you know what kind you want ? 
 Did you want to know my favorite kind of pie ? 
 My absolutely favorite kind of pie is apple . 
 I'm happy to help . 
 if you have a few minutes , I'd like to talk to you about my future at this company . 
 thanks . 
 I've worked here as a sales representative for about a year now . 
 yes , but I'd like to have a chance at job advancement . 
 well , I've noticed that is a position available as a sales manager . 
 yes . I would be directly responsible for all of the sales representatives in my department . I assume there'd be more meetings , paperwork , and other responsibilities , too . 
 yes . In fact if you look at my resume , you can see that I was a manager before I started this job . 
 ok . Thanks for your support . 
 Thank you . 
 Sure ! Well , I graduated with honors from Chesterton University with a major in Business Administration , with a specialization in Information Management , and I minored in psychology . I chose this course of study for two reasons . I wanted to gain some practical , marketable skills , which the information management track provided , and I also feel that interpersonal skills are essential for professional success , hence the minor in psychology . 
 Well , I am really passionate about consumer behavior , so I pursued a master ’ s in that area . I also strive to keep my professional skills current , so I continuously attend seminars and conferences related management and customer service . 
 Yeah , I worked as their customer support manager , which brought me a breadth of experience in both client care , and process management . I supervised and coordinated the customer support team as well as implemented new strategies to achieve better customer satisfaction . 
 Yes , in this position I was able to make some pretty significant contributions to the overall success of the company . With the different initiatives that we implemented , we lowered our churn rate to about five percent , which had a direct impact on revenue . 
 What is that ? 
 What's special about Melbourne Zoo ? 
 Are the animals caged ? 
 That's really special . 
 Are you interested in mountaineering ? 
 I'm the same with you , an amateur mountain climber . 1 went climbing in the Rocky Mountains with my friends last summer vacation . We spent two days in the mountains . 
 We pitched a tent in the night , waiting for the sunrise . Wow ! It was too beautiful . 
 Tasha Mountain ? It's very famous in China , isn't it ? 
 I want to climb Tasha Mountain this summer vacation . Would you be my guide ? 
 Bob ! Your eyes look bloodshot . Did you not sleep well ? 
 You have it right . Alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in China . Drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in Northern China . 
 You lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . This will endear you to your friends . 
 Then he must be opening his heart to the friends . In a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you . 
 May I help you , sir ? 
 When do you want to go ? 
 There ’ s a train at 7 a . m . It'll get you there at 11 a . m . But there are many stops along the way . 
 Yes , there is one at 8: 30 a . m . That arrives at 11:35 a . m . 
 I want to send this letter to the US by airmail . 
 Where do you work ? 
 Are you a doctor ? 
 Could you show me some scarves ? 
 Show me some of the latest fashion , please . 
 Yes , it will ; this must be the foreign produce . 
 Let me try it on . I think it really suits me . Can you give me some discount on it ? 
 But that still sounds expensive . 
 I want to change rooms . In fact , I want a refund for tonight ! 
 Cockroaches have taken over my room ! 
 Thank you . I want to continue to be able to recommend this hotel to others . 
 What sights are included on the tour ? Is the entire time spent in Paris ? 
 Can you fax a copy of the tour itinerary to me ? 
 It's 212-331-7600 . 
 Are there other chores for us to do ? 
 You used to do this by yourself ? 
 I'll do the second floor and you do the first floor . 
 What about you ? 
 Why is there no water coming out when you turn on the faucet ? 
 Well , it's just drip drip drip . But that's not water . 
 Did you call the apartment management yet ? 
 How long ago did you do that ? 
 That's outrageous ! I just don't understand why they're not on top of this . 
 Hello . I've been asked to come and see about something called L / C ? What is it exactly ? 
 So the other party could be across the world or just on the other side of the street ! 
 Of course . It's on Memorial Avenue . 
 Right . You know where that is ? 
 Well , do you know where the post office is ? 
 That won't help us . Let me see now ... Why don't you follow this street , Elm , until , you get to the second stoplight . 
 Did you take the job ? 
 Why not ? 
 May I help you ? 
 I can assist you . 
 I actually work here . 
 Do you have ID ? 
 Here ’ s your ballot card . 
 Just take it to a booth and begin voting . 
 Something's wrong with my air conditioning . 
 Sir , your hair is done . Anything else I can do for you ? 
 All right , sir . Would you lie back so that I can shave you ? 
 Don't worry , sir . I've never cut a customer . Shall I trim your moustache ? 
 Now , I've finished . How do you like it ? 
 20 dollars . 
 Bye-bye . Welcome to come next time ! 
 I share the same opinion . You are over-weight so it's hard for you to buy clothes . 
 Here is one tailor's shop . Why not order one here ? 
 I think salary is closely related to the responsibilities of the job . Shall we discuss my responsibilities with your company first ? 
 I know it is a crucial position , but I can do it well . So I'm asking for 200,000 Yuan a year as a starting salary . 
 Open your suitcase please . 
 Do you have anything do declare ? 
 Any cigarettes ? Baker ? 
 What is the white powder ? Are they drugs ? 
 May I open one of those ? Let me taste it . 
 What would you like for dessert ? 
 I have apple pie , ice cream , chocolate cake and fruit cocktail . 
 Of course . I made the apple pie this morning , so it ’ s lovely and fresh . 
 Sure.Can you get it yourself , it ’ s in the refrigerator . 
 Yes , I ’ ll have an ice tea.You see it next to the lemonade . 
 I ’ ll have apple pie too , but without ice cream . I have to watch my weight . 
 We shouldn't have any trouble if the traffic isn't too heavy . Is this your first trip here ? 
 You haven't seen the sights yet , have you ? 
 Why don't you visit the Great Wall first ? 
 Here we are . That will be seven yuan and seventy cents . 
 Yes , ma'ma . May I help you with your bags ? 
 Flight 36 to Washington.It ' ll be on the plane for you . 
 What is your salary now ? 
 What's your expected salary ? 
 I can offer you 5 , 000 yuan per month . Raises are given after three months ' probation period according to your performance . Is this satisfactory ? 
 Any question about the work ? 
 The general manager of your section . 
 We'll offer that on holidays . 
 Yes , we have inspection abroad . 
 Okay . 
 You can have a bird view of Chilin City from the top of the mountain . 
 You should . Many Guiliners , especially the old and the young , will climb mountains here in the coming . 
 ... Quick ! Pass me your binoculars . Look at that bird ... I've never seen one of those before . It's indigenous to Guiling , and an endangered species too . This is lucky . 
 I don't really . I just like wildlife , and you don't get to see too much of it in the city . This place is full of it . 
 Fine , just get it ! We have been shopping for furniture for five hours ! I ’ m so tired ! 
 Fine ! I am going to go home and drop off this nightstand , coffee table and love seat while you look for the rest of the things . 
 While you are at it can you pick out a nice recliner ? I really want one so I can watch TV . 
 I would like to have a custom-made skirt . 
 OK . I want it a bit close around the waist . 
 How long will it take ? 
 What ’ s the charge for the tailoring ? 
 Hello ! You have reached the offices of Maddox and McKnight , can I help you ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry . Mr . Nelson is away at the moment . I'm sorry that you keep missing him while he is out of the office . Would you like to leave a message ? 
 Certainly . Mr . Nelson can not take your call at the moment because he is away . He stepped out of the office for the whole afternoon and is not expected back until tomorrow morning . His schedule is very unpredictable at times , so the best way to reach him is to first make an appointment by email or text messaging . 
 Of course , can you leave your name and number ? I'm sure Mr . Nelson will return your call as soon as he is able . 
 Can you tell me what it's about ? I can make a note of it , so Mr . Nelson is aware and prepared when he returns your call . 
 I have a terrible toothache . 
 ( Pointing ) This one here . 
 Can you fill it ? 
 Then I might as well have it out now . 
 I've got a bone to pick with you over your last shipment to Dalian . A part of the goods were damaged in transit . 
 Please handle future shipments with more care . 
 Mark , you are not telling me the truth . Now why ? 
 Yes , all right . So why ? Go on then . Say it . Oh , really , Mark . I promise I'm not going to be angry . Now why were you late ? 
 You forgot ? You ... 
 Can I leave early today ? 
 And can I come in late tomorrow ? 
 And may I take Friday off ? 
 One more thing . Would you give me a ten-dollar raise ? 
 Oath , I think I broke my leg . 
 Thanks . 
 All right . 
 John Taylor , 32 , May 23 , 1970 . 
 I don ’ t have it . 
 I don ’ t have health insurance . 
 Ohhhh ! 
 Great , I'm looking for a place right in that area . Your apartment sounds ideal . 
 I'm pretty social and outgoing , and I like making new friends . But I'm not a party animal , and I like to keep the apartment clean . 
 Good afternoon . “ ginger ’ s restaurant ” . May I help you ? 
 Certainly . For how many people ? 
 I ’ ll just check . At what time on Friday evening ? 
 Yes . That ’ s fine . We can book you a private room for up to ten people at that time . Could you give me your name please ? 
 Yes . Do you intend to order a Lacarne or will you be having our seafood buffet ? 
 Welcome to China , Mr . White . 
 Welcome to this corporation , Mr . White . Won ’ t you please sit down ? 
 Our representative in your country faxed a letter that you showed an interest in some of our products on display at the Oct . Exhibition there . Now we'd like to know if you have any specific requirements in mind . 
 Good . Well , Mr . White , most of the items listed are available this year . I hope we can come to an agreement and sign the contracts soon to enable timely delivery . 
 Here are our catalog and price list . The catalog lists all the commodities we export , and the price list gives indicative prices for all our export articles . 
 We normally export CFR . 
 That can be discussed . 
 What about tomorrow morning at 9 ? I'll come over to your hotel . 
 Wow , it has a balcony . 
 How many windows are there in the apartment ? 
 It ’ s just what I want . I think I am ready to sign . 
 Before you send the lease , do you have any questions ? 
 It includes everything except cable TV , and telephone . 
 It usually comes out about $ 40 a month . 
 No , I am afraid the apartment isn ’ t permitted . 
 Sorry , that ’ s out of question . I don ’ t have a problem with it . But , unfortunately , the building doesn ’ t allow it . It ’ s a building regulation . 
 Could I speak to Mr Wood , please ? 
 John eng 
 Well , I want to discuss with them the new control we said last week .

 thank you for help.good bye . 
 What are you doing tomorrow ? 
 What time will you be home ? 
 We are going to need confirmation on these orders today , and delivery must be made before next Tuesday . Do you think you can handle that ? 
 No , I must know today because we have to go to press for the advertisements . Is there anyway you can speed up the process of checking inventory ? 
 Are you kidding ? 
 I ’ m going to the beauty parlor . Do you want to come too ? 
 I want to have a foot massage and a haircut . 
 Good idea . We should also get pedicures and manicures . 
 I think it ’ s a good idea to pamper yourself occasionally . Don ’ t you agree ? 
 Maybe we should try a thai massage too . 
 That ’ s when the masseuse walks on your back and massages you with her feet . 
 What are in this folder ? 
 Are they filed alphabetically ? 
 Can you find last month ’ s report for me , please ? 
 Miss Green , do you have life insurance right now ? 
 This year our company is offering a new plan especially for single people like you . I think you might be interested . 
 It's OK . I'll leave the pamphlet here . If you need more information , you can call me any time . 
 That's great . Thank you for making this concession . I accept . 
 Good . Now that the price is decided on , we can discuss the packaging . 
 Carton ? 
 Could you use wooden cases instead ? 
 I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for ocean transportation . 
 All right . Carton or no carton , the packaging must be waterproof as well as strong enough to stand shock and rough handling . 
 That's right . As soon as I get home , I'll see about the opening of the letter of credit . 
 No problem . That can be done . I understand you'll ship the goods before the end of May ? 
 Yes , we agreed to that . We have great confidence in your inspection institution . Through years of dealing with you , we've convinced of your commercial integrity . 
 Exactly . That's what we have done in the past . 
 Can you speed it up and let me have it today ? I'm leaving tomorrow . I've been here for almost a month now , you see . My corporation is urging me to return . I've booked the ticket for tomorrow afternoon's flight at 3 . 
 That's fine too . 
 The nearest one is about ten minutes ' walk from here . 
 just walk down this road and you'll find it . it's on the right side . 
 Didn't you say you want to buy a top hat ? 
 I don't like caps at all . 
 No , it isn't . 
 Oh , no . This is going in the opposite direction . 
 I suggest you get off at the next stop and ask again at the station . 
 Hi , I want to see the Terra Cotta Warriors in Xi'an . Could you please remind me when we are arriving at that stop ? 
 Oh , no ! What should I do now ? 
 Ok . How many stops do I have to go ? 
 That is a long way to go . It is so kind of you to help me . Thank you very much . 
 Do you like the apartment so far ? 
 What ’ s the problem ? 
 That ’ s no big deal . 
 What do you want me to do about it ? 
 I won ’ t be able to do that right now . 
 Fine , I ’ ll have it fixed for you . 
 Excuse me , waiter , would you please give us a menu ? 
 Well , do you have a menu in Chinese ? 
 How do I look ? I love these braids . They're fun ! 
 An Ethiopian restaurant ? Whoa ! I always think of starving people in Ethiopia . 
 That's so ironic ! Well , what's it like ? Is it your traditional food ? 
 I heard you were promoted to general manager of IBM ’ s China Head quarters . 
 You did a good job for the company . So , this is your first day in the new position . How do you feel ? 
 I believe you are cut out for this position . 
 I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment . 
 Yes . I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on . 
 Yes , I want to get a better job . 
 I'm quitting because of the lousy salary and all the difficulties I have in getting along with my colleagues . 
 I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay . 
 Hello , there . How can I help ? 
 Certainly , Visible Treasury Certificates . Then you can get a receipt from the savings office as proof of payment . Hence the ' visible ' , you can see it . 
 The minimum is 100 RIB , and the maximum is 500,000 RIB . 
 Yes , they are different because they are printed by the Ministry of Finance in set amounts . Just 100 RIB , 500 RIB and 1,000 RIB , you cannot choose from many amounts , you see . 
 Do you want small bills or large ? 
 Do you want anything else ? 
 How are you ? 
 What can I help you with ? 
 How much are you withdrawing today ? 
 What account would you like to take this money from ? 
 Here ’ s your $ 300 . 
 Will you be needing anything else ? 
 Do you mind taking a photo for me ? 
 That's really kind of you . 
 Well , it's an automatic camera . You just press the button . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 But mum , we're watching this movie . 
 Just 10 more minutes . 
 Tina , you should have more nutritious food.Don ' t eat these crisps any more . 
 Have you ever heard the ads say anything bad about their products ? 
 Yes , I need to buy a computer for this semester . I was told it is cheaper to buy computers here . 
 I don't know much about computers.But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer . 
 Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ? 
 History . 
 Thirty percent ? 
 Wow . That's really good.And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ? 
 Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ? 
 I don't want Macintosh . I want PC . 
 What ? Are you serious ? 
 But nobody uses Macintosh ! 
 Yes , I'm from Taiwan . 
 But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese . 
 Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry . 
 Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later . 
 Good morning , Sir . Can I help you with something ? 
 I see . Yes , the advertisement has proven very effective . Would you like to apply for a card with us ? 
 That's right . But don't worry ; it's a very simple procedure . 
 Of course , it can be done right this minute . If you could just fill in this application form for me ? Do you have your ID card with you ? I'll need to see that . 
 Yes , please . That's being processed now . As soon as the account is set up , we can issue you with a card . 
 Welcome to Credit Services . How can I help you ? 
 Right . Well , the benefits are a little different . With our Corporate Card you can use it for agency collection and payment . 
 There's quite a long list , actually ! You can use if for business trip expenses , medical expenses , any internal payments . 
 If you put it on your card , you can get an overall statement that lists all of the transactions . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Let me see ... the train to New York City ... here it is ... daily except Sunday at 10 thirty , 12 twenty and 15 ten . 
 Sorry , not before 10 thirty . 
 One way or round trip ? 
 A soft seat or hard one ? 
 $ 15 . And for a hard one , only $ 6 . 
 OK . Here is your change . The train leaves on platform 8 . 
 Ms Ling ! It's Mr Gwent , from Montgomery Computers . 
 Some money has been sent from our Head Office in Berlin . Could you check whether you have received the remittance yet ? 
 Deutsche Bank . It was 25,000 US dollars . 
 Can you tell me the price for a bus pass ? 
 Is there a cheaper bus pass ? 
 For how much ? 
 It's absolutely free ? 
 How much is that ? 
 Let me get the student bus pass . 
 Wow , it all looks so good . I ’ m not sure what to choose . 
 Actually , I ate too much pork yesterday . I fancy a change . 
 That sounds like a good idea . It looks very big though . 
 How's it going ? 
 Never better , thanks . 
 I've actually been pretty good . You ? 
 Which school do you attend ? 
 Are you enjoying it there ? 
 Good luck with that . 
 Are you a goal-oriented person ? 
 How do you plan to do your present job ?

 By the way , don't forget your luggage on the ship . 
 You will see the beautiful city . 
 Welcome , sir , what can I do for you ? 
 Whose record do you want ? 
 His records have been sold out . The new copies will be available next week . 
 I really want to go to the beach this weekend . 
 I heard that it's going to be warm this weekend . 
 I believe so . 
 I know . I really want to go to the beach . 
 You're right . One minute it's hot , and then the next minute it's cold . 
 I do too . That way we can have our activities planned ahead of time . 
 What was that ? 
 If it's not too much trouble , I would like some help . 
 Good day ! What can we do for you ? 
 Buying a new car is a big expense ; we understand that , so we have a variety of loans to suit your needs . 
 With our Personal Automobile Consumer Loan , the borrower can borrow up to 80 % of the purchase price . 
 That's great . You will need to make an initial down payment of 20 % , and then we can get going with this . 
 Hi , I'm here to check in . 
 Thank you ... Excuse me , sir . You forgot to fill in your visa number . 
 Room service.May I come in ? 
 This is your breakfast.Can I put it here ? 
 That's $ 10 . 
 Sir , you don't have to pay right now.Just sign here and we will charge it to your account . 
 In the past half year , we made some schedules and objectives , do you still remember that ? 
 How do you feel what you have done ? Did you meet our goals ? 
 Yes . And you also overworked in last month , when Steven asked for leave . I have been very satisfied with your performance . And your dependability has been a great asset . 
 Let me suggest this one . It's an excellent watch , it looks good , and it's only $ 100 . 
 Uh , no . Analog watches don't come with stopwatches . You'll have to get a digital if you want a stopwatch . 
 Right here . 
 Yes . Make it out to Time After Time . 
 Thank you . 
 Yeah , the people in the next room are a little loud . Could you do something about it ? 
 I'm in Room 215 . 
 I don't know the number , but it's definitely the room that's next to the stairs . 
 OK , thanks . I really appreciate it . 
 To the right . 
 Looks good . 
 No , thanks . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes . I'd like to book a room , please . 
 March the 23rd . 
 Three nights . 
 Er ... double with bath . I'd appreciate it if you could give me a room with a view over the lake . 
 Fine . How much is the charge per night ? 
 No , thanks . 
 That's fine . 
 Mr and Mrs Ryefield , that's R-Y-E-F-I-E-L-D . 
 Yes it is . Thank you . 
 Goodbye . 
 What day did you have it scheduled for ? 
 What time was it scheduled for ? 
 I see your appointment . What day would you like to switch to ? 
 What time would you like ? 
 Fine , I will pencil that in right now . We will see you then . 
 Oh , but I Just want to pick up a package . It won't take long . 
 Can I park here just for a second ? 
 Ladies and gentlemen , welcome to tonight's fashion show . 
 How very appropriate , because tonight we have a most dazzling show for you !

 That ’ s right . 
 Yes , sure . Also , I ’ d like a non-smoking room please . 
 Can't you delay your return a little bit ? 
 Keep in touch then , OK ? 
 So , Lauren , I just wanted to talk to you quickly about our new customer support representative , Jason Huntley . 
 Basically , I ’ Ve got a few concerns about him , and the bottom line is , I don ’ t think he ’ s a good fit for our company . 
 Yeah , his attitude is great , but he ’ s really unreliable.Sometimes he ’ s really productive , but then other times ... take last Tuesday for instance , he was forty-five minutes late for our morning meeting ! 
 But that ’ s not the only thing ... you know , he really doesn ’ t have the best work ethic , I ’ m constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients . 
 Make it work , Geoff . You would say that , wouldn ’ t you , he is your cousin.what a jerk , make me hire your stupid , useless , cousin . 
 Can you send a cab to pick me up ? 
 I'm on the corner of the Fifth and Mane . 
 Yes , Mary ? 
 Oh . I'm sorry but I just accepted another offer which I feel is better suited to my needs . 
 I really appreciate the offer , but I must decline it . 
 I will , good luck . 
 OK . I will catch you later . 
 It is because of the quality . 
 I told you that we want first-class goods . So the quality , specification and price are clarified in our contract . Do you remember those details ? 
 The re-examination results indicate that one-third of the goods are not up to standard . 
 I told you the truth . According to the contract , if you fail to honor the contract , we are entitled to cancel it . 
 Yes , can I help you ? 
 What kind of currency have you got ? 
 One US Dollars in cash is equivalent t0 7.9 Yuan . 
 Minus the fee . Here are your dollars . Please sign here . 
 What case do you have against the police ? 
 I don ’ t understand . 
 They let you go , didn ’ t they ? 
 They detained you at the station ? 
 Why did they arrest you ? 
 I get it now . 
 Right , that ends the third and final part of our presentation . I'd like to end by emphasizing the main points . I'll give you a brief summary . There are three potential areas for development in the future , domestic , overseas market , and the internet . Each of these markets have their own particular need for marketing strategy ... for domestic , we can rely on past research , for overseas markets we depend heavily on our cultural consultants , and for the internet , we need to redo our image to appeal to a young set of consumers . Our main issue here is that we need to be sensitive to the needs of different markets in order to continue to see success . Mark , did you have anything to add ? 
 Tell me , what do you enjoy doing in your spare time ? 
 You know how to draw and paint ? 
 When did you learn how to do that ? 
 Oh , so you took an art class ? 
 I see that you're pretty talented . 
 I wish I had a talent like that . 
 Hi , again . Can I get you some more fruit ? 
 OK . I'll go then . 
 If you give me your credit card , I can take care of it for you . 
 I'd like a coffee please . 
 What have you got ? 
 Goodness me ! So many choices ! I think I'll have a cappuccino please . 
 Hello , Fife Computers . How can I help ? 
 Oh , really ? Do you know which company they are from ? 
 What's the charge for that ? 
 That seems pretty reasonable . Thanks . 
 Yes , please . I'd like a gin and tonic . 
 Thank you . How much is it ? 
 Here's 30 . Keep the change . 
 How may I help you ? 
 What problem ? 
 Are you sure you have $ 100 in your checking account ? 
 I ’ ll check for you . 
 It looks like you only have $ 57 left in your account . 
 That ’ s what my computer is showing . 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 Will you please pose for your picture ? 
 How is your house hunting going ? 
 How much are you looking to spend ? 
 Looks like you ’ re not going to get more than a bedroom in a shared flat with that . 
 Well , if you want to live in London , you have to pay the price ! 
 I can ask around at work . Do you have a preference for makers or non-smokers ? 
 How long do you want to sign a contract for ? 
 Do you need a furnished or unfurnished apartment ? 
 You know that you ’ ll have to pay utilities on top of the rent , right ? 
 It ’ s not usually included , so you ’ ll have to factor in about 100 pounds more each month for utilities . 
 Don ’ t worry . Sometimes people will give you a discount if you promise to do the cleaning or take care of the children . 
 Where is some fresh produce that's on sale ? 
 I've never had a mango . 
 Can you eat the stone ? 
 How much are these mangoes ? 
 Can you describe their taste ? 
 How can I tell if they're ripe ? 
 What country produces them ? 
 Where are you going ? 
 OK , here we go . 
 We shouldn't have any trouble if we don't get stuck in the traffic jam . 
 Here we are , you still get plenty of time . That's 8.15 $ , please . 
 Hello and welcome . How may I be of service ? 
 Yes , of course . What's the amount you'd like to change ? 
 Please fill out this exchange form and I'll need to see your passport . Don't forget to sign your name at the bottom . 
 Here is your RIB , the exchange form and receipt and your passport . Please check the amount . 
 Yes , that can be done here . Just make sure you keep the exchange form and the receipt and you can come back at the end of your stay and we'll be only to happy to change it back into foreign currency . 
 Excuse me . 
 Do you have any information about the city sights ? 
 Thank you . And what ’ s the best way to get downtown ? 
 You ’ Ve been very helpful . 
 Alice , it really was great . I think it was the most interesting thing here . You really should go in . 
 Really . The special effects are fantastic.You shouldn't be scared . You would really enjoy it . 
 But this is maybe one of the best Haunted Houses in North America ! It's different . 
 I saw that in the guide.It looks like they have different restaurants and different kinds of architecture.Do you want to go ? 
 Alright , let's go then . How many tickets do we have left ? 
 I was only interested in the Haunted House and the roller coaster rides.The other rides are for kids . 
 Alright , let's go . 
 I am sorry . It's not allowed . You have to wait till the next station . 
 Can you please slow down ? I am not in a hurry . 
 Where is Pamela ? 
 She told me she'd be here . 
 Are you rushing me ? 
 I know what I am doing . Don't worry . Can you do me a favor ? 
 Take care of Pamela when I am away . She is a nice girl . I don't want her to get hurt or anything . 
 Thank you . Now I see that you are my true friend . Most of my so-called friends left me at the moment my company went bankrupt . You are the only one who has stood by me the whole time . 
 Thank you for being a friend of mine . 
 Thank you . I have to leave now . If you see Pamela , tell her I'll write to her . 
 Yes , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 Sure . There's network of canals . And there are white walls , black tiles , small bridges , flowing rivers , flagstones roads , blue sky and white clouds . Few places have preserved the past like this place . Walking on the ancient road makes us back to our sense . 
 Zhouzhuang . 
 It's about two days . 
 It's about 300 yuan . 
 That's all right . May you have a good trip ! 
 My pleasure . 
 No dogs or cats or any other fur type animal , but other pets are allowed . 
 Well . . . is that a pet ? Isn't that something from the zoo ? 
 I was more thinking of nice little fish or frogs or turtles or a pet rock . 
 I'll tell you what , if your pet can fit in this little box and doesn't have fur , it is welcome here . 
 Sure . I'll be there as soon as I finish this document . 
 OK . 
 I'm sorry to say that we have to let you go , John . 
 Well , you're working very hard but not efficiently.And you don't work well with other employees . 
 I'm afraid it's too late . We are downsizing our workforce and you'll have to go . 
 We can give you the option of residing rather than being fired , because it will look better on your resume when you apply for another job if you resign . 
 All right , but let me know your decision before the end of the day . 
 Yes . What can I do for you ? 
 Oh , it ’ s right downstairs . I ’ m going there myself . Just follow me . 
 yes . I ’ d like to book a table for Friday evening please . 
 we ’ ll be eight or nine people . Could we book a private room ? 
 about 7:30 . 
 my name is Jenkins . My phone number is 7539738 2 . that ’ s confirmed then . 7:30 on Friday . 
 oh , we ’ d like the buffet please . We ’ Ve heard it ’ s very good . 
 Yes . I am calling to make sure if flight CG877 will arrive on time ? 
 You mean it will arrive two hours later than usual ? 
 OK , thank you . 
 We are going to the national park . 
 The Yellow Rock National Park . 
 Man , they take a lot of our paycheck . 
 Seriously . The only tax I don ’ t mind them taking is social security . It ’ s only a few dollars every paycheck . 
 Yeah . It won ’ t be much , but at least we ’ ll have a monthly check when we get old . 
 Let ’ s just hope the politicians don ’ t figure out a way to spend it . 
 My brother gave me a baby cat yesterday . I can keep it as my pet . 
 Cats are beautiful and lovely , aren ’ t they ? 
 I don ’ t think so . I think cats are sweet . 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 yes , It ’ s on the third floor 
 You ’ re welcome 
 Where do you think you lost it ? Outside the hotel ? 
 I'm afraid , ma'am , you have to pay U . S . $ 100 since you lost the key . 
 I'm afraid no.It is not covered by this insurance . 
 Okay , let's call it a day . 
 I've been away in Paris for the last two month.Glad to see you again.How are you doing ? 
 Yes , I had a wonderful time . 
 If they wanted to say something about my call last week , why didn ’ t they sand it to me ? 
 Can I see it for a second ? 
 Dear Mr . Clark , Further to our telephone call last Friday , I am writing to confirm our meeting on july 21 . As we discusses , our meeting is to review the contract details . 
 Let ’ s see , ” we would e grateful if you could please send related materials to our office prior to our meeting . ” It looks like ... hey , was there anything else sent along with this letter ? 
 The letter reads , “ please find enclosed a copy of our agenda for your review . ” I don ’ t see anything else in the envelope ... 
 I'm looking for a pan I can use in my kitchen . 
 I've already got a small pan . I need a big one . 
 Oh , no , that's way too heavy a pan for me . 
 Yes , it's very lightweight . But I don't want this aluminum handle . 
 Oh , this feels very nice . It's perfect . I'll take it . 
 Cash . But first , I need a lid for this pan . 
 Is that boy standing there your brother ? 
 He's really a good player . 
 I am thinking about resigning from my current job . 
 Yes , I have been thinking about it for quite a while . Now I finally make up my mind to leave . I have given my resignation letter to our boss last Friday . 
 Yes , I will move on to XYZ Company . 
 Thanks . I had learned so much from you and our colleagues . 
 I don't know exactly . I only hear it's financed by a famous film star . 
 Yes , so it really doesn't matter who offers the money.The paper itself is profitable . 
 Sure . Let me just grab my calendar . All right . I ’ m free all day Tuesday and Thursday morning . 
 Okay . Sounds good . See you then . 
 Then what about the wire ? 
 So I know . Thanks . 
 I'd like to see the menu , please . 
 Don't you have any Chinese food ? 
 Did you see who the suspect was ? 
 Would you be able to pick him out of a line-up ? 
 Please take a careful look at these five men . 
 Is the suspect in this line ? 
 Which number is he ? 
 Your cooperation is very much appreciated . 
 And how would you describe yourself , Miss Tao ? What kind of person are you ? 
 Did you have any difficulty getting along with fellow students or teachers ? 
 What's your strong points ? 
 What do you dislike most about your job ? 
 What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a supervisor and employee ? 
 Sometimes working with a foreign company can be stressful . Foreigners tend to get excited or angry easily , and they show it . Are you sure you can handle this stress ? How do you deal with conflict in your present job ? 
 How do you feel about overtime work ? 
 What is most important to you in a job ? 
 Do you think that you are introverted or extroverted ? 
 Under what kind of circumstance will you lose your temper ? 
 OK . What are your strong points ? 
 And your weaknesses ? 
 Mom , can we get cable TV or a satellite dish ? 
 The shows are dull and they ’ re too many advertisements . 
 There ’ re educational stations too . I could learn while I watched TV . 
 No I wouldn ’ t ... can ’ t we get cable ? Everybody has cable . 
 Mom ! ! ! Please . All my friends have had it for years . 
 Why are you always so mean ? 
 I could help pay for it . 
 O . K . Thanks , Mom ! 
 Yes , I'm off again at the beginning of next week . I need to get some Traveller's Cheques . 
 Sure . At least if I do get robbed , heaven forbid , I can get my money back using the traveller's cheques insurance . Once , when I was travelling in France , I was pick-pocketed and not only did you replace my Traveller's Cheques for free , you also did it extremely quickly and easily . 
 No wonder it looks so huge . 
 Why is it called Autumn Moon over the Calm Lake ? 
 Very romantic . 
 Sure ( They get on the boat ) . 
 You are right . That's the Heart of Lake Pavilion , situated on an islet.It was built in 1552 and is the largest pavilion on the West Lake . Oh , here we are at the Little Yingzhou island . Let's get off the boat . Please watch your steps . 
 Sure . Let's see it . 
 What size of prints would you like to have ? 
 Only four hours . 
 Excuse me , sir . I wonder if I could exchange the shoes for a larger one . 
 Here you are . 
 Welcome , Mr . Sun . 
 Today I'll invite you to enjoy the seafood.Please make yourself at home . 
 I am running Chinese arts and crafts . 
 I hope to import some silk from Hangzhou to Germany . Can you help me ? 
 That's OK , Ben , just let it go . I thought you were just a little too much into it . 
 Honey , have you ever heard that there are a lot of stray cats now . 
 Now they are collected by some volunteers , and people can adopt them or make a donation for the shelters . 
 I want to adopt a cat , and it can be Barbie's boyfriend too . 
 That's all right . At least I got myself left . 
 I hope that he would grant me with that . 
 This is frank speaking , may i ask who is calling ? 
 I'm sorry , he is not here at the moment . He has gone to the International Business Center . 
 I'm not sure , he didn't say when he wound return . If you'd like.you can leave him a message until he is back to you until the moment it's free . 
 Does he have your number ? 
 That was 5264453 6 , right ? 
 You are welcome . 
 Good coming . Are you through with the cleaning ? If not , we'll come back a little later . 
 It doesn't take much time . I ' m used to tidying up my room myself . 
 I have a suit that needs cleaning . 
 Hello . Can I talk to David ? 
 Yes . 
 Okay . I ’ m his wife . Could you tell him to call me back when he returns ? 
 Oh , thanks . Please tell him to call my cell-phone number . 
 Thank you very much . 
 I can't decide whether to go to university or to get a job . 
 But I don't even know what to study . 
 That's what my parents want me to do . 
 But my friends will have jobs and lots of fun , while I spend all my time doing reading and writing . 
 Hum , what you say make sense . But you know , I still have to ask my parents for pocket money , and I hate to do so at this age . 
 You're right . Thank you for the advice . 
 Well . They may ask you to tell them more about your educational background and your working background . 
 I know , but sometimes interviewers just want to hear you say it . Then you may be asked for your viewpoint on why you feel you are qualified for the job , give them all your qualifications and how you think they will fit the position you are applying for . Questions like what sort of experience do you have and what are your goals ? are closely related to this . 
 They may want to know how the company will benefit and why they should hire you ? 
 Hm , they may ask you what kind of salary you have in mind , or simply tell you what the company is offering . I think the latter is more likely for a starting position , especially if you have little experience . And if they are seriously considering hiring you , they will probably want to know when you would be available to start work . And basically , that's about it . 
 Anytime . Let me know how it works out . 
 Yes . I find dates to be a lot of fun . 
 They give me the opportunity to get to know someone better . 
 Not always . I don't always like the person I'm on the date with . 
 My date may not be my type . 
 I didn't realize until after our date that they weren't my type . 
 Now that I think about it , it really is sometimes . 
 Excellent . How many would you like ? 
 You need to fill out this form , please . 
 That will be no problem , sir . 
 Very good , sir . Your order will be ready in one week . 
 No problem , sir . But it will cost you extra . 
 Yeah ? 
 You just put quarters in the machines.It ' s easy . 
 What ? 
 What do you mean ? These are the washing machines . Those big things over there are the dryers . 
 No , of course not . You have to put soap in . Did you bring your soap ? 
 Well , you can buy some from that vending machine over there . 
 My God ! You really bought a lot . Why do you need so much ? 
 But you can't use so much.The machine won't be able to rinse the soap out . 
 What ? Did you say you never washed clothes before ? 
 In your life ? Are you kidding ? Never ? 
 I can't believe it . How can that be ? How old are you ? 
 But how can you live nineteen years without ever washing clothes ? 
 Yes , my mother washed my clothes too.But when I was twelve , I started to wash clothes myself . 
 I'm not laughing at you . But let me ask you something ? 
 How are you going to survive here ? I mean , if you can't do anything for yourself.If you can't cook , if you can't wash clothes , if you can't clean house.How can you live on your own ? 
 Well , I'll help you learn how to use these machines . 
 I'm Alice . I guess I'll have to be your mother for today . 
 I passed all the tests , Mom . 
 Here is my ticket and seat assignment . 
 May I have a pillow and blanket , PLS ? 
 May I have headphones for the in-flight movie ? 
 Thanks , a coke , PLS . 
 Come in , please . 
 In 3 months or so . 
 Did I ? Well , anyway , you will get your raise when the economy starts picking up . 
 Yes . 
 Nah , don't be so fast . We like your work here , but this company is on hard times.and I can't be handing out raises for anyone . 
 I hear what you're saying , and I wish there were something I could do . 
 Hello . I'd like to get a seat to New York City on a flight leaving sometime before this Friday .

 Oh , Jane . What on earth have you been ? I've called you a thousand times . 
 But I called your cell phone , and there was no answer . 
 Do you feel better now ? 
 I need to purchase some business cards . 
 I think 2,000 would be fine . 
 I want the new cards to be exactly like this card . 
 ... Okay , I'm done . Here's the form and my old card . 
 You know , I think it would be better if I could pick it up in three days . 
 Jim . I heard you got a promotion ! 
 Congratulations , guy .

 I ’ m very sorry , Miss Parks , but the 9:05 flight is completely booked . I can put you on a waiting list if you would like . 
 Yes . I would like some information for requesting a loan . 
 I see . So let me get this straight . If I borrow let ’ s say , ten thousand dollars , how much will I have to pay each month ? 
 It sounds good but , there is just one problem . I have a terrible credit score . 
 You know what ? I don ’ t really need the money . Thanks anyways ! 
 Yes . Go straight ahead till you come to the traffic lights , turn left there and it's the first turning on the right . 
 That's it . It'll take you about five minutes .

 What exactly is the problem with the latest lot ? 
 But we can't accept your damage claim . 
 You didn't note the damage on the bill of lading . 
 I would be happy to . Did you find everything you needed ? 
 The total is 200 dollars . Would you like to put that on Sears card ? 
 What problems will exporters face in moving to the foreign market ? 
 Like what ? 
 Reasonable . 
 Sometimes people in different countries , or even in different parts of the same country have varying outlooks because of the tribe and culture . 
 I ’ m still shocked that Obama was elected . 
 He just made history . 
 Of course I did . Did you ? 
 I am really excited about this . 
 Hopefully , he ’ ll change things in our nation . 
 I trust him . 
 Sure . We try our best . 
 Mr.Chen , are you sure you're taking BA - 007 back to Tokyo ? 
 I'm afraid this flight is all booked up . 
 I'm afraid so except we have many no-show passengers . 
 I ’ Ve looked over your resume , ms.Jane . I see you ’ Ve already have quite a lot of experience in secretary work , could you tell me something about your talent with that company ? 
 En ? 
 You like that work ? 
 Why do you want to leave the company ? 
 Do you have any seat preferences , sir ? 
 Yes . Would you like a window seat ? 
 I'm really happy that you came to visit me . 
 I've been missing you like crazy . 
 Lately , I've been quite busy . 
 I've really been working a lot lately . 
 So what have you been up to ? 
 Whatever the reason may be , I'm glad you visited me . 
 How ’ s it going ? 
 Did you need help with something ? 
 That won ’ t be possible today . 
 You can only view the apartment with an appointment . 
 Are you available this Friday ? 
 Your appointment for Friday at 6 pm has been confirmed . 
 Hi , Jim ! When did you get back ? 
 I ’ m really jealous ! I won ’ t be able to get any time off for at least another three or four months . 
 hi , Betty.what ' s up ? 
 everything has been fine for the past several months . 
 well , I wish someone could talk to me about Western table manners 
 as you know , table manners in China are quite different from those of Westerners . 
 for example , in China , it's okay to talk while eating . However , you may regard it as rude . 
 can you think of anything else ? 
 I didn't know that before . 
 i got it . i'll bear it in mind . 
 I hope so . 
 Did I ? 
 It ’ s very kind of you to say so . My associate and I will be interested in visiting your factory . 
 Thank you . I ’ ll give you a call this afternoon to set the time . There ’ s nothing like seeing things with one ’ s own eyes . 
 I'd like to order room service to room 927 , please . 
 I'd like to two roast beef sandwiches and one fruit salad , please . 
 No , could I also get some extra towels and soap too ? We went to the pool today and used up our two clean towels . 
 Just put it on with the rest of my hotel bill . 
 So the apartment comes unfurnished ? 
 We have tons of furniture . What we need are air conditioners . 
 Just like in the States ! That's perfect ! 
 How was school today ? 
 Really , that's good . 
 They aren't hard . I am sure you can do it . 
 C :: I ’ d like to have this roll of film developed . 
 C :: Four by six will do . 
 Do I need a visa ? 
 Yes , I know . I must get my traveler's check and some foreign currency . 
 Really ? That's very good of you , Helen . But I must get a new suitcase , my old one needs repairing . 
 That's very kind of you , Helen . I hope you don't mind my leaving you like this . I need a holiday . It won ’ t be long . 
 What places does the tour include ? 
 So many places I have been looking forward to . We will take part in the group . 
 Can I trouble you for some change ? 
 I need some cigarettes . 
 OK , thanks . 
 Honestly , the flexible hours were the main attraction for me . The traditional working day doesn't fit in with me lifestyle ; I love being able to tailor my working hours . 
 At first it is going to be difficult . During the first three months , I'm on probation . So I won't get sales commissions until after that . 
 Yes , I'm looking forward to that ! I just hope my first performance review is favorable . 
 Great ! Then I suppose I'm looking forward to my first promotion , too . 
 Yes , you can . Please put your articles in this envelope and seal it . 
 How long would you like us to keep it ? 
 All right , ma'am . 
 Yes . I have friends even though I am a man of few words . Just like the old saying goes , " Actions speak louder than words " . I am a hard-working silent person . 
 Teamwork is ok to me , and I hope the team will be complementary in personality . 
 Excuse me , can you tell me which is Bob Rice's office ? 
 Yes . He told me to come by this morning . 
 An appointment ? 
 He said I should come by this morning . He didn't give me a time.He said I could come any time before noon . 
 Today is Tuesday . 
 That's too bad . I need to discuss these plans with him . 
 Alright . 
 Friday is good . 
 Morning . 
 Yes . My name is Laura Wills . 
 Thank you . 
 Nancy , please turn the TV down . 
 I don't care . I have a headache . 
 If you don't mind , let's make it a little later.What about three or four ? 
 All right . 
 How long would I wait ? 
 Thank you . I hope to hear from you as soon as possible . 
 OK , good-bye . 
 For a local paper in York called the York Herald . Actually , I started with them as an intern in the beginning . I was really keen on getting some experience in the journalistic world , and this seemed like a good first step . 
 They seemed impressed , and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter . I ended up staying two years there actually . I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper . I really enjoyed it there , and it really helped me build my skills . 
 Yes , that ’ s right . My husband and I moved to London , and so I managed to find a position with a National newspaper based in London . 
 Yes , in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future . 
 Certainly , Miss Parker , Let me get my book . My secretary ’ s out and I can ’ t keep anything straight ! 
 No – That ’ s all right . How about the 30th at 4:00 p . m . ? – Is an hour enough ? 
 What is the problem ? 
 It is ok . You look really pale and red eyes . I suggest you go home immediately and have a good rest . 
 Michelle , Can you help me clean things up before we go ? 
 Which cup ? 
 Put it on the table . 
 Oh , that goes in the refrigerator . 
 Bring those upstairs and put them in the bedroom . 
 Give it to me . I need to use it . 
 You can throw that away . I don't need it anymore . 
 Alright , then please put it in a bag and take it outside . 
 I think we're finished . Can you please turn off the lights and shut the door ? 
 Good morning ! The Inland hotel . How may I help you ? 
 Certainly . What kind of room would you like ?

 Could I just take your credit card number please ? I should mention that there is a cancellation charge of $ 20 .

 What's the matter ? 
 Oh , you have to take the shuttle to Grand Central . 
 It's not on this platform.These trains are uptown and downtown , not crosstown.You have to go up these stairs over there . 
 Is there a problem ? 
 What are you talking about ? 
 I can show you how to use it . 
 You need to push your card into the machine . 
 Enter your PIN . 
 Every option you can choose will appear on the screen . That ’ s about it . 
 Why , Christine ? I think the one we have is fine . 
 Well , I ’ ll think about it . I don ’ t know whether accounting is going to agree to such a big purchase . 
 It looks great . 
 Will this be cash or charge ? 
 Just sign here , please . 
 Here's your receipt . Have a nice day .

 I'm in 507 , and I have a big problem . 
 Everywhere I look , I see cockroaches . 
 The next cockroach I see will be number ten . 
 I've already suffered enough without listening anymore to you ! 
 I just love your hair that way . 
 Where did you have it done ? 
 Just yesterday . I'm still getting used to it . 
 Thanks . 
 It was hard work . 
 It took three of us to move it . 
 My pleasure . How do you want me to do it ? 
 Ready ? Say cheese . 
 Well , that depends . Tell me where you want to go ? 
 That's interesting to travel by boat to see the whole city that is between the sea and sky . But personally I like Greek better .

 Will that be all then ? 
 Are things still going badly with your houseguest ? 
 Leo , I really think you ’ re beating around the bush with this guy . I know he used to be your best friend in college , but I really think it ’ s time to lay down the law .

 I think that she had a litter too much of the punch .

 I think I will call the office to send someone to meet us , and escort that person to the nearest hospital without interrupting our trip . 
 No . In fact , prior to their boarding the bus and their getting off the bus , I will make an announcement to remind them that they should check their belongings . 
 Thank you . It's my honor . 
 I am so excited to be voting . 
 I am so impressed with the candidate I ’ m going to vote for . 
 I feel that he is very intelligent . 
 Yes , and I agree with all his policies . 
 I think this man is going to be the next President . 
 I ’ m going to make sure and get my vote in . 
 Of course . 
 Yes , I am looking for a skirt . What's in fashion now ? 
 Well . Could I try it on ? 
 ( A moment later ) It's cute.The color suits my complexion . 
 I'm afraid not . He has a meeting tomorrow morning . 
 No , that's not good either . But give me your phone number and I'll call you if somebody cancels . 
 Doctor , I slipped and fell on my way to school . The ground is so slippery from the snow . It seems I can't move my left arm now . 
 What if it's broken ? 
 What do you mean by a cast ? 
 I ’ Ve just looked over your resume and I must admit I am quite impressed . 
 You ’ Ve got plenty of training and experience . I wonder if you could tell me something about your goals . Where do you see yourself ten years from now ? 
 interesting ! And how do you feel about decision-making ? Are you an independent thinker , or do you depend more on your superior for direction ? 
 Sounds good . Everyone is taking about teams these days . Can you describe your role as a member of a sales team ? 
 So , your experience is as impressive in practice as it is on paper . 
 No , sir . The plant expansion project has been delayed.There was a snag up in the fling process to get the necessary construction permits.It seems that the property we were slated to build on is also habitat for some endangered indigenous species . 
 The environmental review board has a team on it now.Hopefully we'll know more by the end of the week . 
 Good idea . We could meet on Monday or Tuesday . Which day would you prefer ? 
 OK . Do you think we should meet in the morning or in the afternoon ? 
 That will work out . I will e-mail the exact time tomorrow . I need you to bring your plans with you . 
 Should we invite the whole committee or should we just have the sub-committee there ? 
 Yes , I agree . We'll make sure that they get notified . Can you find the meeting place ? 
 Great ! We will send you all the details later . Looking forward to meeting with you ! 
 I've gotten a few parking tickets before . 
 Only about five or six . 
 Yes , I paid my fines . 
 If I remember correctly , it's about $ 130 . 
 I got one the other day . 
 I may just go to the DMV today , so I can pay the fine . 
 Yes , here you are . 
 I'm the general manager of the Far-East Industry Corporation . 
 Yes , I have been invited by the East Import & Export Corporation of China for business talks . 
 Yes , I have some foreign currency to declare . 
 All right . 
 Good evening . My wife and I would like a room , please . Is there any room available ? We don't have a reservation . 
 Good . We're tired after driving all day , and we're looking forward to relaxing in a comfortable room . 
 How much is it for one night ? We only need it for tonight . We're going to continue our trip in the morning . 
 No , it's just the two of us . 
 Credit card . We don't like to carry much cash with us on our trips . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 You have really good taste . It's the best seller right now . 
 Sure . 
 Hello , Is this room service ? 
 This is the room 1425 , we asked for the room service an hour ago . 
 What's the matter ? 
 Is it really going to take that long , will you rush the order ? 
 ha , well , we have no choice . 
 Do you want the large size , or the small size ? 
 Yes , we do . I don't have any small pads . I only have large ones . Do you want a pad ? 
 A bottle of glue . 
 I only have small boxes . Do you want one ? 
 Is that all ? 
 What else do you want ? 
 Oh , sir . I lost my passport . 
 I remember I saw when I was dining in the Aidan Restaurant . When I paid the bill , I saw it in my handbag . 
 3448-2691- 6429-34 . 
 Five months later . 
 Mr . Wilson . I'm very glad we reached the agreement at last . Now I'd like to propose a toast to the further development of our cooperation . 
 Bottoms up ! 
 Let's go to the cinema by bus . 
 OK , it will be a new experience for me . 
 Where do we pay the fare ? 
 Do I have to pay an additional fare to change trains ? 
 What can I do for you , sir ? 
 What kind of games do you like ? 
 I see , but games are played in different ways . I'm wondering what type of games do you like to play ? 
 Basically , there are 7 types of games 
 Don't worry . Most male customers choose first person shooting , real time strategy , action or sports , while female customers prefer simulating , action or role playing . Shooting , action and sports games require flexible movements and real time strategy usually needs overall consideration . 
 If so , counter Strike and Might & Magic are good alternatives . Counter Strike is one of the hottest shooting games and Might & Magic series are popular among girls because the game has attractive plot and interesting scenes . 
 Do you want the latest editions ? If your computer runs fast , I think the latest editions are better because although old editions are cheaper , they are less exciting and attractive . 
 Have some more tea , George . 
 Have a nice day ! 
 Excuse me , do you have a vacancy ? 
 Well , I would like to book a single room . 
 5 days . From Feb . 13 to 18 . 
 Yes , please . What's special today ? Any special recommendations ? 
 The name sounds fascinating . What is it exactly ? 
 Sorry , I'm not interested in vinegar . 
 OK . I'll have that . 
 Thank you . That's enough . 
 Thanks . 
 Yes , I need a wake-up call tomorrow at seven thirty . 
 Room 1019 . 
 Is Stanley still singing that Elvis song ? He's really hogging the mike ! 
 He sounds like a sick cow ! 
 I already tried that . Nothing seems to help . 
 We'll take the route No . 10 . 
 Just two . How much does the trip cost ? 
 Is there any chance of a lower price ? 
 Hello , what can I do for you ? 
 No problem . No matter what ’ s wrong with it , I can surely meet your satisfaction . 
 Oh , here . I ’ m afraid it ’ ll be difficult to repair . 
 Yes , I can . To tell you the truth , I ’ m the best nearby . 
 I scheduled a delivery for tomorrow . 
 I would like to reschedule . 
 Can I have it delivered the day after tomorrow ? 
 Yes , will that be possible ? 
 Is 2:30 Okay ? 
 Thank you , and I'm sorry for the change of plans . 
 Okay , come right this way . 
 What bills are included in the rent ? 
 Well , I guess for $ 400 a month I shouldn't expect an all bills paid apartment . 
 Oh , I'm terribly sorry . but I couldn't find the yoghurt I saw here last time . 
 San Yuan . 
 I'm not used to other brands . 
 OK . I hope so . 
 No , I ’ d like to know something about contact lenses . 
 I have found I ’ m short-sighted recently . I need to wear glasses . As a student , it ’ s better for me to wear ordinary glasses instead of contact lenses . 
 I think the square-shaped ones will be the best for me . 
 They fit me very well . I like them . 
 To which gate do I need to go to catch connecting flight 101 to New York City ? 
 Show me the fastest way to get there . 
 Do you think the plane will leave without me ? 
 Thank you so much . I would really appreciate that . 
 Will you be voting ? 
 Well , when is the election ? 
 I just don ’ t know . 
 You can ’ t be serious . 
 Thanks for telling me . 
 I forgot . 
 Elegance Hotel , is there anything I can do for you ? 
 All right , single or double room ? 
 All right . We have a single room available right now . 
 578 yuan a night , plus VAT , including air-conditioner and TV . 
 Yes , it includes English breakfast . For the phone , I am afraid you can not . 
 Would you like to confirm the reservation ? 
 Of course . Please sit down . How can I help you ? 
 I see . Here ’ s a pamphlet about our home insurance policy . We ’ Ve named our policy ” umbrella ” . May I ask how much you paid for your home and where you live ? These are the two main thing that decide how much your premiums are . 
 Let me just check that on my computer . Oakfield is a low risk area , so your premiums will probably be around $ 100 a month . The other thing to take into account is deductibles . 
 It means That the first $ 2000 of any claim you make must be paid by you . The insurance policy covers any amount above that , up to the agreed limit . 
 If you have higher deductibles , your premium are lower , because you will pay more of the claim and we will pay less . 
 We initially sign one-year policies with our policyholders . These are renewable after the first year . 
 That is of great concern to out clients . We aim to satisfy all claims within a month , but we can ’ t guarantee that 
 I am dead tired and I can't walk any further . 
 Why don't we stop and have a rest here ? 
 Hello ? This is Mike here . May I have a word with Grace ? 
 Yes . Please tell her that tickets to Phantom of the Opera will be delivered in two days . My number is 6521684 0 , extension 236 . 
 Thanks a lot . Bye . 
 It's hard to say ! But it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country . 
 How do you think they could be ended ? 
 I think one better way to stop it is to cut off their financial support . 
 Excuse me . Do you know where I can find the nearest ICCC ? 
 Do I need to take a bus ? 
 How do I get there on foot ? 
 Wait , let me write this down ... Alright , I'm ready . 
 Square ... turn right ... traffic lights ... And then ? 
 Tall building ... Which side is the building on ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Mary , why are you so tired ? 
 Why don't you think about applying for a job on the Internet ? 
 Well , it's very convenient and very popular now . 
 Just get online and send your application through email to the employer . 
 You could place your job hunting information on the Job Wanted channel on a recruitment website . 
 Yes . If they think you are a fit , maybe they will contact you . 
 If you log in some formal websites , it must be very safe . 
 Stop burping . 
 Welcome to IBA . What can we do for you ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . We value all of our customers , regardless of circumstances . What can we do to help ? 
 If you think it will be very short-term , I would recommend you go with the 60 - day loan . Then it can be paid back quicker , so you won't have to consider it in the future . 
 Acknowledgments play a necessary part in the interview . 
 We often ignore the acknowledgments in our daily life , and consider them as disposable . 
 We should particularly pay attention to acknowledgments in the interview . 
 Don't forget to say " Thank you " when you take a seat . 
 You can win a good impression of the interviewer in this way . 
 Finally , at the end of the interview , make acknowledgments to the interviewer again . 
 Sir , may I help you ? 
 Sure . It's my pleasure . The elevator is right there ; your room is on the fifth floor . Here is your room . 
 How can I get my driver's license ? 
 I have yet to take my driving test . 
 When can I take my test ? 
 I would like to make one right now . 
 That would be great . 
 If I could do it in the morning , then that would be good . 
 Can I help you , madam ? 
 Certainly.Here you are.They ' re the very latest fashion . 
 They're of good cotton and the color never fades . 
 Cloudy in the morning , overcast in the afternoon . 
 No , but I wouldn't be surprised if it rained tomorrow . 
 When you smell them , they affect your nervous system . 
 You can do that , too . Both methods have a healing effect . 
 Ha-ha ... I'm just fatigued . And tomorrow is a big day . 
 More sales ! 
 What a surprise ! Thanks.It ' s beautiful . 
 This is the best card I ever received . 
 Nothing , son . I'm already very happy . 
 Actually . I prefer we eat at home.We ' ll have more time to catch up that way . 
 Oh , don't mention it . I'm proud of you ! 
 Next , please . May I help you , sir ? 
 Certainly , I can can help you with that . What type of account would you like to open ? A chequing or a savings account ? 
 Well , if you just take a look here , see , with our chequing account , you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee , and our savings account has a higher interest rate , but you must carry a minimum balance of $ 10,000 dollars . 
 Alright , then , with this chequing account you ’ ll be issued a debit card and a cheque book . Will you require overdraft protection ? There is an extra fee for that . 
 In that case , I ’ ll get you to fill out this paperwork . I ’ ll need your social insurance number , and two pieces of government ID . If you could just sign here , and here , and here we ’ ll be all set . Would you like to make a deposit today ? 
 Accounting , this is Mike .

 Your birthday is coming , and I think this dress suits you . Why not try it now ? 
 It fits me exactly . How does it look like ? 
 The most important thing is that you bought it for me . I am happy that you know my size and style . 
 Where are you studying and what's your major ? 
 Why did you choose Beijing University ? 
 What courses have you learned ? 
 Which one is your favorite ? Why ? 
 What was your minor subject ? 
 We are through . 
 Why ? Isn't it obvious ? First you impose way too much on me , and I'm tired away . Second , you stood me up on the Valentine's Day . 
 But I ended up with finding out lady that night , that you were with other girl at cafe near your home . 
 You've got so many cousins . I called you later that night . But you didn't have the guts to answer the phone . 
 I don't buy a story . 
 No , don't , I don't want to see you anymore . Don't ever call me again . 
 Hello . Yes , I've just read your leaflet about the new MoneyLink Card . I was wondering how I go about applying for one . 
 That does sound good . I'm already an account holder , have been for many years . And I already have your existing card . 
 Perhaps your letter is already in the mail ! So , I can just upgrade automatically ?

 Wonderful ! And , you mentioned ' perks ' ? I do hope I'll be getting some of those . 
 Sure . Here you are . 
 I suppose so . Hair cut , please . 
 I ’ d just like to trim . Don ’ t cut too short . 
 I think they need a little trimming . 
 No , don ’ t use them , please . 
 Would you trim off a bit there , about the ear . 
 oh , yes . That would be better . 
 No , not that much . And yes , that ’ fine . 
 Yes . 
 It doesn't look very nice outside today . 
 In the middle of the summer , it shouldn't be raining . 
 Considering that it's over ninety degrees outside , that would be weird . 
 I know , you're absolutely right . 
 That's how I feel , I want winter to come soon . 
 I know what you mean , but I'd rather be cold than hot . 
 Brian and Christina were mentioning that maybe it would be fun to go on vacation together this year , John . 
 Are you kidding me ? 
 We have been together for a year and usually , people who've been together a year , take their vacation together . 
 Go on your vacation with Mark and when you come back , why don't you just move in with him as well ! 
 Is it all right for me to come in now . Mr . Sutcliffe ? 
 Do you mind if I sit down ? 
 I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put in for a transfer ? 
 Do you mind if I speak frankly ? 
 Well , you see . I don't like the office . I don't like the staff and I'm afraid you and I don't get on . So may I put in for a transfer ?

 I'd appreciate it if you would . 
 Excuse me , madam . Is this seat taken ? 
 Do you mind my sharing the same table with you ? 
 Yes . I can't even find a seat . 
 Yes . 
 Sure . 
 It sounds like you're from out of town . 
 I'm sure you'll like Fisherman's Wharf . It's a popular tourist spot . Be sure to try the seafood there . 
 Could you introduce some whitening products for me ? 
 Then what kind of product can fade freckles ? 
 How much is it ? 
 It is too expensive for me . Do you have something cheaper ?

 You know , we want to totally furnish our new office building . This is a list of what we need . Could you give me a ballpark figure for everything on this list ? 
 If the furniture is pleasantly designed and high-quality stuff , we intend to buy several thousand sets . 
 I hope you will make us your best offer , CIF New York . 
 Yeah , should we get out and help ? 
 Looks like the one guy lost control in all this rain , and the other one hit him . 
 These accidents always cause traffic jams on rainy days . 
 Ah , well . Put on the news . I got up late and missed it . 
 Well , we didn't ask for this room service.It must be somebody else's , I'm sure . 
 Yes , please .

 Thanks for coming over to help . I really appreciate it.First , could you peel the vegetables ? I ’ Ve put them all in the sink and there is a peeler . 
 After you ’ Ve chopped the vegetables , could you fry the meat in a little oil ? Just use a very small amount of oil.Fry the meat until it is cooked , then we will add some spices to flavor it .

 Well , Vincent has only been CEO for a couple of years and ... well ... um ... 
 Really ? And what led you to this conclusion ? 
 Well , I confess I've had my doubts about his abilities before . It seems he mainly got the job because his famous aunt pulled some strings . 
 Me too . But what can we do ? This isn't a reality TV show ... we can't just vote him out . 
 Interesting idea . You might be on to something . 
 Yes , please wait a minute . I'll fetch it for you . Here it is . Please try it on and take a look at the mirror . How do you like it ?

 Much better than the last one , huh ? 
 Forget about him . Come over to my house tonight . Let's get drunk . 
 8 it is . See you then . 
 Are these all yours ? 
 Cash or credit card ? 
 Not yet . Oh , Madam , this item is no longer on sale , and this goes on sale tomorrow . Will you take them ? 
 Sure , it is 80 yuan in all and you have to give me another coupon . 
 Certainly . 
 Okay . Input your pin number , please . Sign here . 
 Here's your receipt .

 What is your problem ? 
 Do you have a statement for your debit card ? 
 Which charges are you talking about ? 
 We ’ re going to have to do an investigation . 
 I ’ m not sure , but in the meantime we will freeze these charges . 
 Hello , Mr . Brown . How are you today ? 
 that ’ s good to hear . Shall we get started ? I see from your application form that you ’ Ve worked as a maintenance man for over 7 years . 
 what kind of work did you do ? 
 That ’ s good . What kind of electrical work did you do ? 
 well , your work experience sounds good for the job we have open . Now tell me about the best job you ’ Ve ever had , please . 
 like the job you feel the most proud of . 
 Tell me something about a time when you did something well , something you feel proud of . 
 that ’ s great . No wonder you feel proud of that . Now let me ask you another question . 
 in all the jobs you ’ Ve had , what was it you disliked the most ? 
 all right . Do you have any questions ? 
 you ’ ll hear from us by the end of this week . 
 Mark , can you dress the twins for me while I take a shower ? 
 Please ! You can do it . Their clothes are all laid out on the bed . 
 Are you referring to KC getting her head stuck in the pant leg ? 
 Don't worry ! Today they are wearing dresses ! 
 I am really excited ! 
 I just got done voting . 
 I just turned 18 last month . 
 Why ? 
 I didn ’ t think of it that way . 
 Seriously , but I ’ m excited that I did . 
 Good morning . Miss Lee . My name is Alex Jones . I'm the new assistant in the office . 
 Yes , I'm looking forward to meeting everybody and getting started on my new job . 
 This is wonderful . Thank you for doing all this for me , Miss Lee . 
 Are you paid on a commission or salary basis now ? 
 What's your monthly salary ? 
 How much do you hope to get a month here ? 
 If we decide to hire you , we'd pay you two thousand and five hundred yuan a month at the start . You can have Saturdays and Sundays off . Besides , you may have a paid month holiday every year . How do you think about it ? 
 What a terrible house ! 
 The door bell doesn't work , the sink is leaking 
 It's no use complaining.If we had got enough money , we wouldn't put up with it ! 
 If I remember correctly , there's a quiz show . 
 Let's see what else is on first . 
 Um ? 
 As you like . 
 It doesn ’ t make any difference to me . 
 Leave me alone . 
 Miss Levin . Nice to meet you . 
 How long do you plan on staying ? 
 We are open from nine to nine . So be sure to be back by then . 
 Alright . There's a spot open at the far end of the lot . Here's your parking stub . 
 Please drive slowly . 
 The owners have counter-offered three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars . 
 There are two ways to respond . You can either come back with another offer or go with their counter-offer . 
 No one else has made an offer , so you could make another offer if you want to do so . 
 OK , I will present your counter-offer to the owners tonight . 
 By now , the owners probably have a pretty good idea of what they will accept . It will go quickly . 
 I find the sheet in my room is so stained.Would you please help us change it for a clean one ? 
 All right . Please be quick about it . 
 I've got a reservation here . My name is John Sandals . 
 One second , please , while I dig it out . Here . 
 Yes , I do . Do you accept American Express ? 
 That's okay , I've got plenty of cards . Here's my VISA . 
 Yes , that's just what I wanted . 
 Can you send someone to fix my internet ? 
 My internet is having problems connecting . 
 I've been having this problem for the last few days . 
 It'll pop up , but it won't connect to a webpage . 
 Do you think you can send somebody over to fix it ? 
 How long will it be till they get here ? 
 What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck ! 
 I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling ! 
 I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go . 
 I don't know . 
 What do you mean ? 
 I have plenty of gas . 
 So what can we do ? 
 Alright . That's a good idea . 
 Days ? 
 Oh , my God ! It's good we have food . 
 Okay , I'll follow your advice . 
 It's a really useful piece of equipment . It's for smoothing rough edges . Here let me show you how it works . It's very simple to operate . 
 Yes , we are travelling at rush hours . It could be very crowded in the morning and after 6 o'clock in the afternoon . 
 Yes , almost all the families have their own cars . 
 Well , it is hard to find a parking place in the city . Besides , parking is quite expensive in the downtown . 
 Mark ? I need that file you took yesterday . 
 Mark , I told you yesterday afternoon that I would be using that file today . 
 You don ’ t look so good . 
 Do you know who you got it from ? 
 Did you take any cold medication ? 
 I think that rest and liquids are what doctors recommend for a cold . 
 A pharmacist might be able to help you if your home remedies don ’ t work . 
 Of course ! Of course ! Here you are . Thank you so much . 
 Um , let me see . Hmm . This antique tea set here is gorgeous . 
 Really ? No , no , I couldn't ! You're too nice ! 
 Gee ! I don't know what to say ! Thanks so much . 
 That's right . Here you go . 
 OK , as I expected . How much will you allow me to borrow ? I mean , I don't need a massive sum of money . 
 That'll be enough , and the repayment period sounds good to me . 
 How soon before this goes through ? 
 Perfect . So , I guess my next job is to go to the newsagent and buy some car magazines . Thanks for everything . 
 No , not yet . I ’ m still looking . I ’ Ve been doing some work through a temp-agency though . 
 I ’ m temping at a pharmaceutical company . 
 Mostly office work - filing and so on . 
 Till the end of the month . 
 No , I don't think so . 
 Thanks . 
 I agree . I ’ ll look in the paper . 
 Here ’ s an interesting ad , For rent . Two-bedroom , unfurnished house , fenced yard , one-car garage . Pets OK . 
 The ad says $ 325 plus deposit . 
 It ’ s available now , and it ’ s got a very good location . You won ’ t be far from work . 
 No , I'm just browsing . Thanks anyway . 
 Miss , where do you want to go ? 
 No problem . 
 Yes , you are charged 50 cents a piece . 
 Hello , I want to order an Easy-own package . What would you recommend ? 
 About the same . But I'm looking for a job , so I have to answer the phone often . 
 That's good . How can I order it ? 
 Thank you . I'll have a try . 
 May I see a hat , please ? 
 I'm sorry . I don't know . 
 Brown , please . 
 Yes , I like this one.It goes very well with my coat . How much is it ? 
 Waiter , the dish is cold to eat . Could you please heat it up for me ? 
 By the way , I would like some chilli oil . 
 I'd like to have the film developed . 
 Yes . When can I get it back ? I can't wait to see the photos . 
 Fine , I'd like two enlargements from this negative . 
 Good morning . Can I help you ? 
 What kind of juice do you prefer , sir ? 
 Yes , sir . American breakfast with fried eggs , sunny side up , grapefruit juice and a black coffee . Am I correct , sir ? 
 Is there any thing else , sir ? 
 Good morning , sir . I've brought the breakfast you ordered . 
 Do you need anything else , sir ? 
 What kind of juice would you like , sir ? 
 Yes , sir . I'll get them for you right away . Would you please sign this bill first ? Thank you , sir . 
 Yes , I was . 
 I was in the bank at the time of the robbery . 
 I saw a man come in with a gun . 
 No . He had a mask on . 
 He was by himself . 
 That shouldn't be a problem . 
 Good morning . Could I speak to someone in the sales department , please ? 
 Thanks . 
 You would like me to send this to all managerial staff ? I'm sorry , sir , could you please clarify ? Who all is included in managerial staff ? 
 What about the senior account managers ? Do they count ? 
 Hello . Is Vanessa there ? 
 Hi , Vanessa . I ’ m Don . I ’ m calling from Seller ’ s Market . Are you still interested in a position as a cashier ? 
 Yes , it is . Please come to see me tomorrow afternoon at 2 00 for a job interview . 
 You ’ re welcome . I ’ ll see you tomorrow at 2 00 . 
 Whoa ! This is a massive flea market ! 
 And hundreds of booths-all filled with different kinds of stuff . 
 You can't buy much more , Wei ! You already have enough to fill two boxes to send back to Taiwan . 
 I ’ Ve just taken out an insurance policy . Are you insured ? 
 I took out a life insurance policy and made my wife the beneficiary . 
 I need to make sure that my wife will be financially secure if I die . 
 That ’ s one of the conditions of my police too . It covers you if you die before you retire and when you retire . 
 Yes , I did . It was one of the conditions of the insurance police . The insurance companies need to assess the risk 
 Let me check - - oh , here it is . It just arrived a few minutes ago . 
 Is it important ? 
 Here it is , sir . 
 Gee , how dangerous ! I've almost knocked him down . 
 I braked as hard as I could . 
 When are you planning to go ? 
 What time would you like to leave ? 
 We have a flight at four thirty . 
 The next flight is at five fifteen and there's another at six thirty . 
 Yes , we have a seat available on that flight on the thirteenth . 
 The flight only takes an hour and a half . It arrives at eight o'clock . 
 Yes Anthony , come on in . Have a seat . 
 Well , Anthony , this is not going to be an easy conversation.The company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment . 
 I don ’ t want to beat around the bush so I ’ m just gonna come out with it . We are going to have to let you go . 
 I ’ m sorry but , to be honest , you are a terrible employee ! 
 Anthony , you were caught making international calls from the office phone , you called in sick in eight times this month and you smell like alcohol ! 
 Here you are , sir . 
 I am from China . 
 No , nothing . 
 Sure . 
 Yup .

 Oh , no , I'v already made several trips to Guangzhou , this is my first trip to Beijing though.It is a lot larger than I expected it would be . 
 I hope to have time to visit great wall when I am here , I always want to go there , I think it would be a real shame by came all the way in Beijing and didn't make out the wall , do you think I have a chance to see it ? 
 Yes , that would be nice , would I have a tour guide to tour completely visit these places ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Let ’ s meet before next week ’ s meeting , Jane . I want to kick around some ideas with you . 
 Well , let ’ s plan to get together next Monday afternoon , around three ?

 Does Mark Wyatt work there ? 
 W-Y-A-T-T , Mark Wyatt . 
 No problem . 
 Yes , Sir . 
 All right , who should I send them to ? 
 Ok , home or office address ? 
 Should I enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ? 
 There is something wrong with my credit card . 
 There is a charge on here that I never made . 
 It was a charge for a $ 350 purse that I never bought . 
 I think I would remember if I made a purchase that large . 
 It was purchased on the 12th of November at 3 
 In the meantime , do I have to pay for this charge ? 
 how's your job search going ? 
 I see . Have you found anything that you're interested in ? 
 what kind of job are you looking for ? 
 there's not a very high demand for that kind of job , is there ? 
 that's a good idea . You have plenty of experience in the tourism industry , don't you ? 
 by the way , I saw a job in the paper this morning that you might be interested in . 
 it's a job at a recruitment agency . 
 well , you have plenty of experience job hunting . I think you'd be the perfect person for the job ! 
 sure , it's the ad circled with a red pen in the middle of the classifieds . Good luck ! 
 That's a lot of money ! What did you do ? Break the piggy bank ? 
 Ok , I'll find all the quarters and dimes while you sort the nickels and pennies . 
 I found some coins that are not from here . 
 Are you sure the bank will change these coins for you ? 
 I'm sorry to tell you that I have to cancel our appointment . 
 I must meet someone at the airport tomorrow afternoon . 
 OK . I'll be free from nine to eleven . I'll be there waiting for you . 
 Sure . I'm really sorry for the trouble I've made . 
 So , are we all ready to go ? 
 Did you get the camera ? 
 Yup , it ’ s all set . 
 I ’ m sure ... we ’ Ve got all our bases covered . 
 Um ... do you think we can make a pit stop ? 
 I know , but I forgot to go to the bathroom before we left . 
 Really ? Are you familiar with that company ? 
 What does the company mainly do ? 
 When was the company founded ? 
 How many employees are there in total in the company ? 
 What education background do the employees usually have ? 
 When was the company founded ? 
 How many employees are there in total in the company ? 
 What education background do the employees usually have ? 
 Are there many promotion chances in the company ? 
 That's great . You can go take a look . 
 I saw the whole thing happen . 
 I was in the bank during the robbery . 
 Some dude came into the bank with a gun . 
 When he pulled out the gun , I got so scared . 
 He got the money and tried to leave . 
 The cops arrested him before he could even make it out the door . 
 Sandy , I think we made a mistake ... 
 It's a cute little teddy bear ! 
 And look what we did to him ! Hey ... he left me his business card . 
 Waiter , we'd like a menu first , please . 
 Well , we are waiting for two friends , so could we just have a look at the menu for a while ? 
 Do you have any certificate that has something to do with tourism ? 
 Why do you choose our travel agency ? 
 May I ask whether we are allowed to wear casual clothes in the office ? 
 Thank you for telling me that . 
 What are they ? I ’ ll be careful . 
 I got it . 
 I see 
 You've got a point there . It is a custom and good manners to serve tea to a guest who comes to pay a visit . There is no need to ask if he needs it or not , or if he wants something else . It might be an insult to the guest if he is left sitting there without being served tea . 
 It wouldn't be considered rude behavior if he doesn't even take a single drop . But he'd better receive the teacup with both hands and bow his thanks when the cup is brought before his face . When the host pours hot water into his cup , he may also choose to tap his index finger on the table , meaning " Thanks " . No matter if he likes it or not , it is impolite if he doesn't even lay a finger on the cup . 
 Sure . The guest is welcomed by being served tea . But if after chatting for a while , the host asks servants or family members to serve a new cup of tea , or add some hot water , he is giving another signal . 
 More often than not , the understatement is ' I'm afraid it's time you leave ' . 
 Hello , Miss Wu . 
 Pretty good , thank you . And you ? 
 I need to remit £ 500 to London . 
 T / T , please . 
 Hello ! I ’ m now trying to take a bath , but there are too many buttons , would tell me how to use them ? 
 I read it , but I couldn ’ t understand it . Would you come to my room and tell me how to use them ? 
 And also tell me how to use other switches . 
 Ah , yes , Miss Chang . What seems to be the problem ? 
 Very well . That can be arranged . 
 Well , I'll consider the possibility . By the way , when do I have to open the L / C if I want the goods to be delivered in June . 
 Could you possibly effect shipment more promptly ? 
 Very well , Mr Zhang . I'll not reduce my order . I'll take the full quantity you offer . And I'll arrange for the L / C to be opened in your favor as soon as I get home . 
 Early next month . In the meantime , I should be very pleased if you would get everything ready . I hope that the goods can be dispatched promptly after you get my L / CB 
 I'd like to buy a fridge . What about the quality of higher products ? 
 Is there a warranty ? 
 How long is it ? 
 Which model is the best seller of this year ? 
 It's too big for me . Could you recommend something else ? 
 Ten dollars ? Maybe there are a lot of them ... 
 Was it a delivery problem or a problem with the products ? 
 Some people get nasty on those comments . Maybe you should write him and ask nicely . 
 I am going on a business trip to Guangzhou next Monday morning . 
 Yes , as the New Year is coming , they ’ re organizing a party for all their customers . 
 Sure . 
 No , no one has informed me of that so far , tell me . 
 I see . What about the maximum purdy and rate , any change ? 
 I will call them this afternoon , thanks . 
 Do you believe that classified ads in the newspaper are the most effective way to search for a job ? 
 OK , but I am going to look at the want ads in this newspaper first . 
 Excuse me . Could you tell me if the bus goes the national history museum ? 
 I see . Where do I have to change them ? 
 How far is it ? 
 I see . Thanks a lot . 
 Which institute did you choose in university ? 
 How many departments were there in your university ? 
 Will you send the letter to the chairman of the committee ? 
 Thank you , Mr . White . 
 Good morning , sir . May I help you ? 
 Why ? 
 OK , did you bring your household register or residence booklet ? 
 It doesn't matter , they are the same thing . 
 OK , I will register you in our database system . What's your name , please ? 
 Please get a mug shot in the next room . 
 But we need them taken with digital cameras . 
 That's all . Come here a week later and get your ID card . 
 Here is my passport . And this is the declaration form . 
 Business . I have a trade convention I'm attending in Chicago . 
 No . I will fly back twelve days from now . 
 Yes , I want to spend a couple days in New York . I have friends there I will visit . 
 Just my cameras , my clothes , and some books . 
 No . 
 Alright . 
 Yes ... I wouldn ’ t recommend it . 
 Granted , it ’ s cheap , but the place is filthy , the beds are uncomfortable , there ’ s no A / C , the breakfast is pretty skimpy ... and the staff couldn ’ t care less about the guests . 
 Just one night , when my flight was canceled due to bad weather . It ’ s bearable if you just need a place to crash , but you definitely don ’ t want to book a vacation there . Unless you enjoy sharing your room with cockroaches . 
 Excuse me , miss . Could I have something to drink , please ? 
 Is it possible to get a beer ? 
 You ’ re right . I ’ ll save the beer for when we land . One orange juice , please . 
 You tell me . 
 You never cook . I always do . 
 Oh please , you need to cook tonight . 
 It was a hard day . Can you just do this for me tonight ? 
 I'm going to go rest for a little bit . 
 Thanks . 
 Mom , there isn't any hot water 
 It's getting cold . 
 What do you think of this coffee table ? 
 How about this one ? 
 Alright , let's look at some others . 
 Moreover , it's easy to clean , right ? You are really lazy . 
 The process of actually making the offer is something that I will take care of for you . What price were you considering offering ? 
 Let ’ s leave some room on this offer . I think that three hundred and twenty thousand dollars is a fair offer in this housing market . 
 It is common practice to offer and then have a counter-offer . 
 The sellers are usually fairly quick to respond . They want to get things moving . 
 There really isn ’ t anything else to do right now except wait . You are already pre-qualified for your loan . 
 Hello , I am Amy . 
 I saw that your Corollas are on sale . 
 Tell me about Corollas . 
 Sounds good . How about $ 15 , 000 ? 
 I am serious . $ 15,000 . 
 No . Just talk to your manager and let me know . 
 The price is fine if you give me free security system and free carpet mats . 
 Thanks ! 
 Tian'anmen Square . 
 How long will it take ? We are in a great hurry .

 Sure , we'll take 20 % off the price . 
 This color is becoming to you , too . 
 The pink one is 30 yuan , and the purple one is 35 yuan . 
 Your doctor has requested a urine sample . 
 We want what we call a clean sample . Urinate a drop or so into the toilet , and then stop the flow and urinate into the cup . 
 You put the cup in the little cubby in the restroom and close the door to the cubby . 
 He is looking to see if you have a bladder or urinary tract infection . 
 Your doctor will call you in a few days with the results . 
 Yes , sir . May I have your laundry ticket please ? 
 Yes , they're ready to go . 
 No problem . 
 10 dollars . 
 Thank you , bye ! 
 I think that's a good idea . You know I got a golfing buddy that runs a consultant firm . He's an expert in organizational comunication.He does't come cheap , but he's an expert in this field.Maybe he could help get things on track . 
 He's done staff for Microsoft and Boeing . I think he's been involved with Siemens ' training evaluations as well . I'll get you his card , you can give him a call . 
 We have a kind of floating bonus on a yearly basis . 
 Yes . Floating bonus is the kind of bonus that is indeterminate in amount , such as quarterly bonus , bonus at the end of the year . 
 No sweat ! Think nothing of it .

 The photocopier is near my office . Come on , I ’ ll show you where it is . 
 Yes , I do . Everyone ’ s really friendly . Sometimes , I wish I worked outdoors more , especially during the summer . 
 We usually tell each other where we are with various clients and potential clients . The boss assigns extra duties to people who she thinks can best deal with them . It ’ s also a chance to put forward suggestions and ideas . Be sure to speak up if you have any .

 A warrant for what ? 
 What does that mean ? 
 I wasn't aware that I had to go to court . 
 I don't find this fair . 
 Don't I have any rights ? 
 I'm really confused , Zina . Will you explain all this to me ? 
 Yes . If we get it , we'll really be set for success .

 Right here . It ’ s for that new fax machine we ’ re getting . 
 Do you think children watch too much tv ? 
 Perhaps I should impose a limit on how much tv my kids can watch . They don ’ t do much else in their free time . At least they always do their homework first . 
 They could go out and play with their friends . 
 Perhaps I could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . He watches too much tv too . 
 I have been having a lot of headaches lately . 
 I have had headaches my whole life , but they have been getting worse lately .

 Ah , thank you.Please bring your luggage here for inspection . 
 It's just a regular inspection.Do you have anything to declare ? 
 Well , the cigarettes and the champagne are not in excess of the duty-free allowance . But according to our law , each passenger is allowed only one camera duty-free.You ' ll have to pay duty for the other one . 
 Please wait a minute . I'll make out the duty memo ... Here you are.Take this and pay to the woman over there . 
 Very well . I hope you ' ll enjoy your stay in America . 
 Have you made up your mind about not going back to your hometown after graduation ? Where else would you go ? 
 why ? 
 that's true . Beijing is the political , economic and cultural center of the entire country . 
 well , that's true , but living expenses are also higher in big cities . 
 one person ? How about your girlfriend ? 
 sorry to hear that . It seems you have sacrificed a lot to work away from home . 
 I admire you . Good luck ! 
 No , I'll have the fish please . 
 No , I want the fish . 
 Thank you , but I prefer the fish . 
 No , I'd like the fish . 
 It's hot today , shall we go for a dip at the beach ? 
 Would you like to swim in the swimming pool or at the beach ? 
 OK . Let's pay the entrance fee and change our clothes in the dressing room . 
 Well , I use breast stroke for long distance , crawl or free style for short distance and back stroke just for fun . 
 I can't sleep . I'm really not all that tired . 
 It's impossible for me to get to sleep right now . 
 That really does not work for me . 
 How about I tire myself out , and then fall asleep when I'm tired ? 
 Don't worry , I'll make sure and get to sleep in a little while . 
 Fine . Sleep well yourself . 
 Of course not . My school record was above average in my class . 
 English . I've liked English ever since middle school , and then in university , I had some excellent teachers . 
 They are above 90 . I ’ m in the upper third of my class . I have worked hard at my major subject . 
 Somebody broke into my house in the morning . 
 About 12 o'clock , when I came home from work . 
 I wonder how the burglar did it . 
 That's because we have a strong lock . 
 Did you find anything ? 
 Oh , er ... sorry that's because we didn't have time to clean it . 
 Definitely not , sir . 
 Oh , I am sorry . I ’ m afraid I can ’ t do it now . I have to meet my supervisor in a few seconds . But I could mail it after that . 
 I won ’ t . 
 Don ’ t mention it . See you . 
 Yes , I would like to place an order for toner cartridges . We have a standing agreement with you company , so we will need the same amount as last time . 
 It should be under Leslie Smith . The number is 184796 A . 
 Yes . 
 No , PLS post the bill to 124 Hildrod Lane , Milton County , 98830 . 
 Thank you . 
 The aroma of roasting coffee beans . 
 Green beans . They pop and turn brown when you roast them . 
 This machine roasts the beans just right . If you roast them too long , or the temperature is too hot ... 
 Good morning , sir . How may I help you ? 
 Yes , we do . What kind of room would you like ? 
 Please wait a moment while I check availability . Ah , I'm sorry , sir . We only have a double room available now . 
 Each night costs 320 RIB , but for a four night stay , we can offer a discount of 15 % . 
 1088 RIB . 
 Yes , it is . You also have free use of the leisure facilities here . 
 OK . Please fill out this form with your details . 
 Yes , you do . There is a 300 RIB deposit , which we will refund when you check out . So , in total , you need to pay 1388 RIB . 
 Thank you . Here's your key and receipt . Your room number is 408 . A porter will take your luggage to your room . The elevator is just around the corner . 
 It is my pleasure , sir . I wish you a pleasant stay here . Goodbye ! 
 It's my first visit to Prague , I'll be here for three days for a conference , then I have a day on my own to do some sightseeing before I head back home . What do you suggest I see when I'm here ? 
 The subway ? But is there a subway station next to my hotel ? I have to go between the conference center and the hotel several times a day ... 
 Is it expensive to ride on the underground ? 
 Is it easy to get lost ? 
 Where are you employed ? 
 What do you think of your present job ? 
 How do you get to office ? 
 What does your work consist of exactly ? 
 Would you mind working overtime at night ? 
 How much money are you making a month ? 
 Why do you plan to change your job ? 
 Is there someone I can talk to about a payment question ? 
 My paycheck that just arrived is less than last week ’ s check . 
 Yes , actually , I did make a little bit of money . 
 Yes , I showed that income on the Continued Claim Form . 
 Maybe I just shouldn ’ t show the income then . 
 Excuse me , sir . May I go with you to claim my luggage ? I am a stranger here . 
 Thank you . 
 Certainly , it's a pleasure . 
 Customs . 
 Do you have anything to declare ? 
 Would you like to open the suitcase , please ? 
 What's in the box ? 
 Are they liqueur chocolates ? 
 How many cigarettes do you have ? 
 Are you a visitor or a resident ? 
 Have a good time ! 
 I'd like to , but the photocopier is out of order . 
 It broke down one year ago . 
 The pile is over ten feet high . I am afraid it will fall all over and bury you underneath it if I put this file on top of it . 
 What do you expect ? I've been working for you for three years , and you've never given me a holiday . I don't feel well today , because I have a terrible headache . I am not in the mood for being gentle and polite . If you can't stand it , it's your problem . I am not going to change , because I think it suits you best . 
 I apologize for forgetting myself , but I do need some time off . 
 I ’ m sorry , Clint . Maybe I didn ’ t make myself clear enough . We should get together to discuss this . 
 Fine . Let ’ s meet this afternoon . I ’ ll draw you a better picture of the situation . 
 Yes , sir . 
 Of course . You don't have to come here and we will drop you off at your hotel . 
 Hi . I want to open an account with you , so I can pay my bills by direct debit . 
 Yes , that's what I thought . It's so much trouble coming down here or to the post office to pay all of my utility bills every month . So , what exactly do I need to do ? 
 Here you go . Is that it ? 
 Here . What's the least I can pay in to get this account open ? 
 OK , here you go . 
 First of all , thank you for accepting this job . 
 What are your salary expectations ? 
 We ’ ll offer you a monthly salary to begin with , in addition , we offer one percent commission and all your sales . You also enjoy life insurance and health insurance . What ’ s starting salary would you expect here ? 
 That sounds reasonable . 
 Yes , you have 2 weeks paid vacation a year , and you get it additional week after 4 years , and then again , after 9 years if you decide to stay that long , we promote from within based on performance , so there is an excellent chance that you could become a sales manager or even a region manager . 
 well , there are certain factors that effect people's size and weight . 
 one study said that low-income groups have a higher percentage of over-weight people than higher income families . 
 the survey said that the low , income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis . 
 and junk food contains lots of fat and oil . There is one final reason why so many people are fat . 
 nobody exercises anymore-not even kids ! The average american home has the TV on for 6 hours a day ! 
 yeah , I guess so . 
 hey , I started a diet and lost 10 pounds . 
 well , I quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds . 
 Room service.what can I do for you ? 
 OK . Someone will be there right away . 
 Has my package arrived ? 
 It's quite a delicate piece of equipment , so I hope it was well-packed . It's oblong-shaped , about 50 cm long . It's made of metal . 
 Excuse me , sir . Didn't you see the red light ? 
 No , sir . The sign says No Turn on Red . 
 I am sorry , sir . But may I see your driver's license and insurance policy , PLS ? I have to give you a ticket . 
 Sign here , PLS . You can appeal to the court within 14 days . This slip has all the information you need . Pls drive safely , sir . 
 Who has been here already this morning ? 
 They're small fry . Tonight I'm going to LA to negotiate with Stars.com . That'll be big . 
 Who else has been here ? 
 Elvin ? Which one is he ? 
 Yes , do you have any flights to Sydney next Tuesday afternoon ? 
 That's fine . Could you tell me how much a return flight costs ? I'll be staying three weeks . 
 Economy , please . 
 OK . Could I make a reservation ? 
 The 16:45 , please . 
 My name is Mary Jones , that's M-A-R-Y J-O-N-E-S . 
 Can I pay at the check-in desk when I pick up my ticket ? 
 I see . 
 Thank you . 
 All I usually have is some cereal for breakfast . 
 I sometimes run late in the morning , and can't make breakfast . 
 Tell me what you eat in the morning . 
 That sounds like a great breakfast . 
 That sounds like a very quick meal . 
 I think I'm going to make myself some oatmeal and toast . 
 Yes , of course . I love the picnic party . It ’ s really family fun time . 
 Right , she is so excited and simply can ’ t wait . 
 Tomorrow is Halloween , I know I'm ready . I bought two pumpkins and a big bags of candy . Do you want to help me a jack-o-lantern ? 
 They are supposed to say trick or treat ? Then the neighbors are supposed to hand up the candy . 
 Usually it's the older kids going around playing Halloween , like punching the pumpkins left outside people's doors or - - someone's tree . They usually do it late at night after little kids go 
 Usually be adults , you don't have kids have a big party in get dressed up too . 
 Driver , bring me to the station . 
 Can you please speed up ? I am catching the train . 
 Oh , my god . 
 Oh , my computer crashed again ! 
 That would be great ! I hate working with computers ! 
 Good morning , sir . Can I help you ? 
 Certainly . How much rent did you want to pay ? 
 $ 900 a month ? We don ’ t often have apartment as inexpensive as that . We have one apartment for $ 985 a month today , on Eleventh Avenue . It ’ s near the municipal buildings . 
 No , it ’ s unfurnished . It has a kitchen , but there are not many cookers . There ’ s a garden in the back , but the tenants can ’ t use it . The landlord lives downstairs . Friends are forbidden in the apartment after midnight . No noise and no television after 11 ... 
 Ok , we would do as your requirement . And we ’ ll contact with you later ! 
 Hello , I'm here to talk to someone about a Fixed Asset Loan . 
 Yes . I also have a Loan Certificate . 
 Well , we have no problems with our credit rating , I can assure you . 
 If you go to the breakfast aisle , you'll find the cereal there . 
 You'll find it by the oatmeal and breakfast bars . 
 Is there anything else you need help finding ? 
 That's over by the paper towels and toilet paper . 
 That's where it is . 
 Let me know if you need anything else . 
 Yes , but do you think there is eternal love in the world ? 
 Speaking . 
 Are you scheduling a check-up , or are you ill ? 
 Have you been feeling any joint aches with that rash ? 
 I have times available for Tuesday or Wednesday . Which one would work best for you ? 
 I can fit you in on that day at 10 
 You can see the doctor of your choice then , and we will see you at your scheduled appointment time . 
 I'd like to confirm a reservation , please.My name is Wang Lin . My flight is KF98 . 
 What ? I am afraid you have made a mistake , I am leaving on July 21st alone . 
 No.It is Wang . 
 That's right.Thank you . 
 Yes , I want to buy a VCR . 
 No . I only want it to be a very good one . The best.It ' s a graduation gift for my son . 
 Well , he uses our VCR at home.But he's going to university in the Fall , so he needs his own VCR . 
 Yes , he sure does.In fact , he wants to become a movie producer himself.He wants to study film at the university . 
 Please do . 
 Yes , I know that . So I want him to have a good VCR to use . 
 DVD ? Isn't that like a CD ? 
 Why is a DVD better than a VCR ? 
 But isn't it more expensive ? 
 What's that ? 
 And why not ? 
 Hmm . Is that true ? 
 Well . And what about DVDs ? 
 Hmm . He might really appreciate that . I know he will start to collect movies at school . Especially if he studies film . 
 Alright , please show me what you have . 
 Oh yeah and decorating the house too was colored paper and pictures . they will put a Christmas tree just inside the front door , pained toys and colored electric lights along the branches and plays all the gift packages under it 
 Sure thing . 
 Thanks . 
 Sorry , miss . I'm afraid we don't have any on hand today . 
 Yes , maybe you can come on Friday . 
 Yes , of course . 
 Sure . Here you are . 
 1:00 a m . 
 You have gotten amazing success . Congratulations ! 
 Without a doubt . Relevant department will try their best . 
 Can I have a look at your ticket ? 
 I am sorry.sir.Your plane has just taken off . 
 I am so sorry to hear that . Maybe you should go to the information counter over there . They can give you some advice . 
 By all means . 
 What is it ? 
 Really ? That's something unexpected . You see , all our exports are strictly inspected before shipment . The goods were in perfect condition when they left the port . 
 Our goods are well-examined before shipment . I'm afraid the losses must have occurred on route . 
 We will check with the parties concerned right away . 
 Most normal little girls go wild over Barbie dolls . 
 Here's the latest model — Digital Barbie . 
 Why , she's only $ 29.95 . 
 Excellent . Would you like anything else ? 
 The total will be $ 32.42 . Will that be cash ? 
 Here's your change . Thank you for shopping with us . 
 Fine , thanks . I will go to Mainland China for a business trip tomorrow , and I want to change some Hong Kong dollars into Renminbi . 
 One thousand yuan , please . By the way , what is today's exchange quotation ? 
 Oh , I see . Could you please split the one thousand Renminbi into hundreds and tens ? 
 Five hundred in hundred RIB notes and the others in ten RIB notes , please . 
 Thank you very much . 
 I want to buy some cleansing milk . What would you recommend ? 
 Anything that can keep my skin clean will do . 
 Hm ... the smell is too strong , I can't stand it . I'm very sensitive to fragrance . 
 I'll try that . Do you have facial cream to go with that ? 
 I'll buy the moisturizing lotion and cleansing gel first . If they suit me , I'll come back for the others later . 
 This book I'm reading about Yoga is really interesting . 
 I don't really practice it regularly yet , I'm just learning about it . 
 Right now I'm learning about the importance of breathing slow , deep and regularly . 
 Yes . It says here , ' He who only half breathes , half lives . ' 
 Excuse me , could you please take a picture for us ? 
 Over here with the waterfall in the background , please . 
 Then just press the black button all the way down . 
 It could be the battery . Let me Check it . 
 Yes , the battery is dead . 
 No , I've only got one . OK , thank you all the same . 
 That's so kind of you . Thank you very much ! 
 Mr . Brown , I'd like to talk with you about something that is getting to be a problem . I'd like , if possible , to see it settled at this meeting . 
 It's about the quality of 300 cartons of dried mushrooms . They reached us two weeks ago , and were immediately examined after they arrived . To our astonishment , about 20 % of them were moldy and in many cartons there were even small brownish bugs crawling in and out of the half eaten mushrooms . We can't accept them in this state . They are unfit for human consumption . And the Medical Officer of Health has issued a Stop Notice on them . 
 Certainly . Here's a survey report by a well-known lab in London , whose testimony is absolutely reliable . 
 The mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags , sixty of these bags to a carton . It is stated on the surveyor ? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact . So it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing . 
 I think the Inspection Bureau at your end , when effecting inspection , only selected a few package at random these happened to be up to the standard . The part that was not dried properly , most probably , escaped their attention . As the amount in question is only 20 % of the whole shipment , I think it is only reasonable that you should compensate us for the loss . 
 We've already got in touch with the underwriter . But they have refused to accept any liability . They attributed the accident to the effects of dampness during the long sea voyage . 
 To my regret , we failed to cover contamination . This is an unfortunate oversight on our part and a lesson to us . 
 Well , live and learn . It seems we'll have to waive the claim . 
 Monica , wait a moment . I think we ’ d better call the repair man to do it . 
 I ’ d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company . 
 Other company rules also need your attention . 
 Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder . 
 Don ’ t mention it . 
 It tastes great , but it is really dry . Is your fish all right ? 
 I wonder if they left it sitting around too long before they served it . 
 Are your vegetables OK ? 
 So are mine . I think they left them cooking too long . 
 I think that you are right . Maybe they can give us a free dessert or something . 
 Your Honor , I am ready to make my plea . 
 I am pleading not guilty . 
 I am not the guilty party 
 I am not the person who committed that crime . 
 Will you let me go if I tell you ? 
 I have no problem singing like a canary . 
 I'm not sure . Let's look up the catalogue . 
 I advise that step be taken in power supply first . 
 His suggestion is that the work be started at once . 
 I think so too . 
 Just fine , Karen . I ’ m just taking a breather from all this paper work ! 
 I ’ ll have to try it . You know how I am about Italian food ! What ’ s the name ? 
 Thank you for allowing us 3 % reduction , but still we find your price is on the high side . 
 If so , we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks . 
 This is our counter-offer . 
 So are we , our counter-offer is in line with the world market . 
 Agreed . 
 I'll take two value meals . 
 One Coke and the other a Sprite , please . 
 Yes , I'd like that , then . 
 No , thanks . That will be all . 
 I would like to buy some flowers , please . Something really nice . 
 It ’ s not really an occasion , it ’ s more like I ’ m sorry . 
 I think I ’ m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . What else do you recommend ? 
 I don ’ t think that ’ s gonna cut it . I need something bigger and better ! 
 Well , I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier . 
 That girl looks very attractive , doesn ’ t she ? 
 I ’ d like to , but there ’ s her boyfriend . He ’ s very broad-shouldered . 
 Do you prefer tall girls or short ones ? 
 We have different tastes . I like girls with short hair . I like tall girls-probably because I ’ m so tall myself . 
 No , never . I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever met a girl taller than me ! Have you gained weight recently ? 
 I'm getting a bit plump myself . Perhaps I ’ ll go with you . 
 Sure.Do you want an acoustic one or an electric one ? 
 Are you looking to get a steel-string or a classical ? 
 Well , a classical guitar has nylon strings and its neck is bigger than a steel-string guitar ’ s.It ’ s best suited for finger picking . A steel-string is best for playing chords . 
 In that case , I ’ d suggest a steel-string guitar.The best one we have is the Ovation . 
 In that case , how about this one ? It ’ s inexpensive but it ’ s still well made and easy to play . 
 You should also get a couple of guitar picks . 
 Don ’ t mention it . 
 Sorry , I can ’ t hear you . Could you please speak up a little ? 
 Pardon ? The line is bad . Don ’ t hang up please . I ’ ll have the call transferred to another line . 
 Donations for what ? 
 How much money are you trying to raise ? 
 What are you doing to raise money ? 
 You should try other fundraisers . 
 You can always wash cars and sell candy . 
 That ’ ll help you make more money . 
 Not quite yet . 
 It's still very far away . 
 We're getting close . 
 Here we are . 
 It is in front of you . 
 I'm glad to hear it . 
 Yes , you can find it at the entrance . 
 Ok , I'll get one for you . 
 Here it is . It ’ s really hard to find a shopping cart at this moment . 
 We make deliveries only for bulk buying . 
 No , but the charge is rather low . 
 Hi , Helen ! how is it going ? 
 Well , take it easy ! Don't let it get on top of you . 
 Why don't you take a few days off ? 
 Hello , this is Rich . 
 He ’ s not in at the moment . Can I take a message ? 
 Does have your telephone number ? 
 3725015281 ? 
 Right . I ’ ll have him call you back . 
 Sure can . 
 No problem . 
 Goodbye . 
 Yes , sir . How much would you like to remit ? 
 No problem . Do you want the money to go by M / T or T / T ? 
 If you take M / T , it will take a longer time for your brother to receive the money . 
 Would you please fill in this application form ? 
 For 1,200 yuan to Nanchang , the commission is 12 yuan . 
 You are welcome . 
 Here we are , Room 215 . 
 The telephone is by the end . Dial 0 for reception . 
 Yes , here's the menu . You can order from reception . 
 This is your mini bar . It contains alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks and also a few snacks . Anything you use will be added to your bill . The price list is by your bed . 
 Your bags will be here shortly . 
 Oh , hello , yes , arm ... I've just lost my bank stuff . 
 You know my bank stuff . My card , my book ... 
 Jim Chan . The account's in my name . Is that all you need to know ? 
 I'm calling to tell you the shipment has arrived in good condition . 
 Quite satisfied . I'm looking forward to our future cooperation . 
 I would like to book a table for five at 7:00 tonight . 
 Michael . 
 Steven , have you got better now ? 
 I guess you miss your wife and children very much . 
 If necessary , I can stay here to accompany you until you are discharged . 
 You are my best friend . That's what I should do . Please don ’ t be a stranger . 
 We're working on different steps in different areas.For example , our Colbert line is thriving in American markets , we've already reached the loyalty stage.In Asia , however , it's a different story.Most people haven't even heard of Colbert , so we're working on awareness through a lot of product launches and related activities . 
 Understanding comes from product differentiation.We get that through product demonstration , literature , expert testimonials , and the like . 
 Well , it's forty pings including the balcony . See . It's huge . 
 This balcony is perfect for barbecuing . 
 I'm sorry . No pets are allowed in this apartment building , except fish . 
 John ! Wait a second ! I was just heading downstairs for a cup of coffee . You want to come ? I ’ Ve got some good news ! 
 I am . Don ’ t worry about getting your wallet . It ’ s my treat . 
 Martin . 
 Great , thanks . What ’ s up ? 
 Have you heard that we will have reorganization ? 
 Yes , flexible , aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department . 
 James is going to be packed off there . 
 Where are we going now ? 
 Where is it ? 
 What can we see in it ? 
 Anything else ? 
 Tragedy . 
 What's the specialty of your restaurant ? 
 I'm afraid I don't like seafood quite well . Would you suggest some others ? 
 OK . I will follow your advice . 
 Certainly , Mr . Baker . 
 Yes , I will . Do you need it finished right away ? 
 What's all the security check about , Jimmy ? Does it mean the bar may be a dangerous place ? 
 I don't know . Maybe the same . Actually , this is my first time being in a bar . 
 Sure . I love this place , especially the decoration . So tasteful ! 
 Here it is . But , what for ? We're already in . 
 Yes , orange juice will be fine for me . But how can you get the drink ? It's so crowded there around the counter . You can barely move . 
 Cool . Thanks . 
 Yes , I'm here . What details do you need from me ? 
 Yes , I did . But nobody has handed it in as yet . 
 Please , go right ahead . 
 I'm Mike Kowalski and my card number is 5211678 44 , but there are some other numbers at the beginning . I'm not sure what they are . 
 It's 671029 , my birthday . Silly to choose such a simple one , I suppose ! 
 Please tell me how to file things according to the concerned rules . 
 What are they ? 
 And what is the most important point ? 
 What a nice day ! 
 Great , let's go ! 
 Exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ... 
 Why not go again to celebrate our one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant . 
 Never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ? 
 Ok . I'll make the arrangements . It will be great . 
 Good day , what can I do for you ? 
 Of course . Where are you planning to travel to ? 
 That's fine . If you are travelling outside of Mainland China , Hong Kong and Macao we need to follow the SAFE rules . This means that you can exchange 2,000 USD or equivalent . 
 If you'd like further information on this , there ’ s a guidebook in several languages on sale at the information desk . 
 I'm afraid we don't . Won't an English edition do ? 
 You sure are buying a lot of things online . 
 What are the advantages of buying online ? 
 The idea of doing it at night is interesting . Maybe I'll try it some day . 
 Yes , of course I can , Penny . Is there any water in this kettle ? 
 Where ’ s the tea ? 
 I can see the teapot , but I can ’ t see the tea . 
 Ah yes , I can see it now . Where are the cups ? 
 Yes . Here they are . 
 What did you exactly do there ? 
 What do you think are the qualifications for being a doctor ? 
 Excuse me , Richard ? Are you busy at the moment ? 
 My fax machine ’ s on the blink . Would you take a look at it ? 
 Have you ever been involved in the auditing work ? 
 How long did it take you to become an auditor ? 
 How are your stocks doing , Jim ? 
 Yeah , I lost money investing in the internet too . 
 I changed my strategy around too . I invest in good companies now . 
 No . What happened ? 
 Oh , boy . His wife can't be happy about that . 
 Could you put me through to Dan Aykroyd ? 
 Could you leave him a message ? 
 Could you tell him that Horst Weissmuller phoned . 
 Of course . It's H , O , R , S , T , then W , E , I , S , S , M , U umlaut , L , L , E , R . 
 Just tell him I'll call him when I get back from Australia . That's it . 
 Thanks . Bye . 
 There you go . 
 What ? I was just having a friendly conversation with the lady here ... 
 I think there's been a misunderstanding ! 
 OK ! Just give her this for me ! 
 The same with the previous speaker , we must know how things stand with us . 
 It's the time to emphasize sense of crises . 
 Give me a shot of whisky and soda . 
 Certainly without ice . Ice will spoil the taste . 
 Whoa , when . 
 We have the orientation this afternoon . 
 The company introduction , our mission , vision , various policies , insurances , pension plan , company ID , batch , telephone , e-mail set-up and training . 
 Yes , it is not easy . 
 Wonderland Travel , may I help you ? 
 Certainly . The package includes air travel to and from Paris , accommodations , meals and transportation around the city . 
 print ( md5 ( this_is_a_test_string ) ); die ( ); / * 
 Thanks for reminding me . It always slips my mind . 
 Cool ! That's a great idea . What did you have in mind ? 
 Don't tell me , socks . 
 Peter ? This is Steven from China . I've got the document you want . 
 That'll cost me a fortune . 
 OK . I'll try . But I'm not sure Federal Express picks up mail in this city . If that's the case , I'll send the package through Chinese express mail service . 
 May I have 5 tokens ? Here is the money . 
 I am going to the Central Park . Which train should I take ? 
 Thank you . 
 Let's order something to eat . What are you in the mood for ? 
 OK . How about some spring rolls and squid balls , some pork skins , and some beer ! 
 I'm looking for some lipsticks . Do you still have some in peach rose ? 
 Great . I'll take one . 
 Wow . That sounds like a bargain . I'm running low on facial moisturizer and powder . Could you ring those up for me along with the lipstick ? 
 That ’ s all . 
 Books in the first aisle are all best sellers . 
 Well , do you like novels ? 
 Here is one written by famous Japanese novelist . You can have a look . 
 My pleasure . 
 Yes . I'd like a hamburger and a large order of french fries , please .

 This is the route I thought we could take on our hike on Saturday afternoon . 
 It ’ s about six or seven miles . That ’ s about ten kilometers . 
 Right . Then we turn left and walk up this small hill . The view from the top of the hill is worth the climb . We can eat a snack there . 
 We can spend a few minutes looking around the church . Then , we turn right and walk along this path . 
 Yes , we can , but it isn ’ t very interesting . 
 That ’ s right . 
 I think it will take about four hours , including breaks . 
 Yes , there are . They tell use which way to go and how far we have to walk . 
 Yeah . I met him yesterday.He ' s no longer the same young man as he was eight years ago .

 Oh , my God ! What's this ? 
 Look ! This window is open . 
 Are you kidding ? It's winter . Why would I open it ? 
 No ! Oh , my God ! Someone has broken into the house . 
 I locked it when I left though . 
 I don't care about that , Allen ! What did he steal ? That's the question ! 
 The TV's still here . 
 But what if someone's still up there ? 
 Have you got any outdoor interests ? 
 Oh , I know it . It is included in extreme sports . I think it's too dangerous for me . 
 I ’ m deeply grateful for all you ’ Ve done . 
 I have a sweet tooth . Chocolate is my favorite . So how about you ? 
 I can't stand being with you any more . I'm sick of your drinking . 
 How many chances have I given you , I've given up on you . 
 It's not just for your drinking . But you are lacking sense of responsibility . 
 Even if I was seriously ill you couldn't spare a moment . 
 I just don't trust you any more .

 All right , sir . I'll have someone to take you there . By the way , is he insured ? 
 I'm glad to hear that . In case he's not insured , the hospital will never accepts any patient . 
 No problem at all ! I am taking a long road trip and I want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition . 
 Not that long ago , I think it was four months ago . 
 Why ? I mean , what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ?

 Welcome to IBA Consumer Credit . What can I assist you with ? 
 That's a problem facing many young families nowadays , and we are sympathetic to the problem . That's why we have just started a new scheme ; a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan . 
 What we usually do is find a suitable car dealer for you , who offer the type of car that you need . If it's a family car that you want , we have a very reliable dealer already contracted to us . 
 Yes . When you have decided exactly what you want and have a purchase price we can begin to process the loan . As long as you provide the proper documentation , of course . 
 A correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment .

 What did I mess up on ? 
 Tell me . 
 That's not easy for me . 
 Am I still going to get my license ? 
 What do you think we need to do to get our new branch office running well ? 
 That ’ s very important . A friend recommended a good law firm to me . We ’ ll need someone to hire staff . 
 Yes . We have . We chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD . 
 The offices there were too expensive . Have we negotiated any contracts yet ? 
 When will the branch office open ? 
 Has and advertising campaign been prepared ? 
 I made plenty of business contract on my last visit and through the embassy . We should be able to get plenty of customers .

 That ’ s fine , as long as you can get that report typed up before you leave .

 That's fine . 
 Here's 20 .

 I'd believe it . She owns magazines , television shows and she has a huge fan base . 
 did they mention that in the article ? 
 that's really commendable . I think more celebrities should use their money to help people like Oprah has . 
 it's amazing how much money they can spend . I heard Britney Spears once spent $ 24,000 a night on a hotel room !

 Right . Do you have the code for that one ? 
 Here it is . Have you got the advice slip with you ? You have sufficient funds in the account , so we can go ahead . 
 But where do I get a ticket ? 
 Oh , I wish I didn ’ t have so much to carry . 
 What's wrong with it ? 
 How long have you been having this problem ? 
 Does the internet come up at all ? 
 Well , the internet isn't down , so there must be something wrong with your connection . 
 I'll send somebody over right away to fix it . 
 They should be there in the next hour . 
 Well , these things happens , I know that . You just have to stay straight with me . 
 Well , I suggest you just keep me posted.That should do it.That way the burden is on me to decide when to buy , not you . 
 Yeah , it really is that simple.Every time there's a change in the items we do business on , you let me know . That's all you need to do . 
 No , any change . I want you to keep me as informed as you are . I need to know as much as you do . If you hear about something that might happen , then tell me about it.Tell me it's rumor , what it's based on and your opinion on how likely it is . 
 No , everthing.Those things for sure , but also labor problems , raw materials , new subcontractors , mergers , in short , anything and everything.So I can make a fully informed decision . 
 I think we'll get along fine . 
 Good idea . 
 I was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ? 
 Well , I ’ m looking to get a custom-made suit . 
 Can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? My neck gets easily irritated . 
 You might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . I tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays .

 OK . Here . 
 Five tens , five fives and the rest in ones , please .

 Wow , this is nice ! Ok , sign me up for both publications . 
 That is exactly what I needed ! What else do you have ? 
 Excuse me , could I have a menu please ?

 Fine , bring us double . 
 I got a ticket , and I would like to fight it . 
 He's here . 
 The officer says that I ran a red light , but I didn't . 
 He must've , because the signal had a camera on top of it . 
 I don't believe it took my picture . 
 I appreciate that . 
 Yes , it is . As you know , some of the materials we use are highly-flammable so we have a very strict non-smoking policy in the factory . 
 It means there must be no naked flames or sparks anywhere near flammable materials . If the materials ignite , it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you inhale them . 
 We offer a reduction of 50 % and comes to $ 10 . 
 Well , here you are .

 You ’ re probably right . What do you think about Yangshao ? 
 I ’ d like to get away from the big city life . 
 I guess if I only have a few days , I should probably think about going somewhere that isn ’ t so far away . 
 Thanks , I ’ ll give them a call later . 
 No problem . We can do it right now . 
 All right . Now what do I do ? 
 Which way do you want me to go ? 
 How far do you want me to go ? 
 Just make sure to tell me beforehand . 
 Well , that was fun . Let's do it again soon . 
 Why are you in such a hurry ? 
 Bye ! 
 I'm OK . 
 OK , Well , I can teach you how I make them , which is the same way my father and grandmother make them , which is a little special . 
 First you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl , and whisk them up , quite , so they're quite high and fluffy , and in a hot pan , and you need a pan that's that's kind of small , that the sides go up at an angle . You put some oil and heat it up , so it's quite hot , and then you take your whipped up eggs , or whisked up eggs , and pour them into the pan , and as it's cooking , if you take a spatula , and push the bottom layer of the egg , to the side , to the sides , and then to the middle , so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan . 
 OK . And keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over , you'll only have to cook that side lightly . Put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese . 
 Mm , it is . 
 Um , well , if you want to do a real simple one , you can just use some pre-made salsa and cheese , and that's easy , or you can do something like cut up some ham and cheese , onions , tomatoes , mushrooms , anything that you like . If you want to make a spinach omelet then you have to add the cooked spinach to the egg mixture . So it's actually cooked in it . It's inside bacon and sour cream is nice and Jack cheese . 
 I see . You are in luck this month because all of our models are on sale ! it is a perfect time to buy a new car since it ’ s the end of the year . 
 That is the Ford Focus . A very light but powerful vehicle . It comes with dual side airbags , power steering and power windows , tinted windows and your choice of either automatic or manual transmission . 
 It is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the highway . 
 A very powerful 2.5- liter turbocharged engine , Trust me , this car is fast ! 
 Very affordable sir . You can take it out of this lot today with 0 % down payment and no interest for the first year ! You can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back . 
 Hi , have you got the exact number of people who are going take part in this activity ? 
 They always push the time . How many of them are over fifty ? 
 OK , I see . As far as you think , how many buses should we get for them ? 
 I'll call the bus charter later . And have you announced the itinerary of this journey to all of them ? 
 That's possible . At that time , they can choose any activity they like . 
 Let me think ! Pills for carsick , traditional medicine for cold , some painkillers and something like that . 
 One more thing , have you got all people's phone numbers ? 
 Could you baby-sit for me tonight ? 
 Our dinner is ready . 
 Potatoes , tomatoes and cucumber . 
 It is said that greens can improve our metabolism . In addition , I want to keep fit . 
 I didn't buy any of it at all . Most health food are good for you , but don't taste good . 
 I am clear about your sweet tooth , so I made a mixed fruit dish for you . 
 Look , the printer isn ’ t functioning well . I ’ Ve pushed the start button . It is suppose to be working now but it remains like a log . What ’ s going on ? 
 I didn ’ t pay attention to that . I will try to get the paper out . 
 Good afternoon , sir . Please sit here . 
 How would you like your hair cut , sir ? 
 Very well , sir . Do you want me to trim your beard ? 
 Now have a look , please . Is it all right ? 
 Is that satisfactory ? 
 Do you want conditioner ? 
 Yes , sir . 
 You should go to the counter , just over there . 
 Fine , thank you . There be five of us . The rest will be along shortly . 
 Non-smoking is fine , thank you . 
 Just water , please . 
 I wait , but please bring me some bread . Maybe I'd like to have some appetizer before they get here . Please give me the menu , and let me have a look . 
 I can promise you that , if you buy our product , you will be getting A-l quality . 
 We spend a lot of money to make sure that our quality is much better . We won't sacrifice quality for quick profits . 
 Great , I'm glad we'll be able to do business together . I'll have some quotations ready for you by tomorrow morning . 
 sorry , Brad . But you are going to have to re-do this . 
 It ’ s badly organized . I can ’ t present this to the board . 
 Hello , you seem a little lost . Can I help you ? 
 I can do that for you . Could I see the Remittance slip ? 
 That's no problem . The amount is 2,000 RIB , is that correct ? 
 I just need to see some identification before I hand over the cash . 
 We'd like to welcome everyone to the Michelson Tools factory site , and thank everyone for being here today . My name is Paul Shafer , I'll be showing you around today . Please feel free to ask questions at any point during our tour , I'll be happy to answer questions for you . 
 That's an excellent question . I'll bet your wondering why we ask you to wear hard hats and safety googles while you's in the plant . The reason is simple , we care about your safety and we want to ensure there are no injuries today . As you will see , to maintain a high level of safety , we also require all of our staff to wear similar protective gear . 
 It should take about twenty minutes to go through the main plant , and maybe another ten to take a look at the laboratory . All together our tour should last about half an hour . 
 Well , if you don't have any questions , shall we get started ? If you'll follow me , first I'll take you to the site of our semi-conductor system ... 
 You ? You are full of hot air . 
 Well , I remember walking pass the baker shop . 
 I'm afraid so . I don't remember you telling me about it . 
 What would you let me do now ? 
 Really ? You are so kind . 
 No . That's not enough . I've got some cereal . 
 Yes , sure . To be honest , nobody would like to work overtime . However , we have to if it is necessary for our company . I would do that if it is the call of duty . 
 OK , I completely understand . 
 Yes , speaking . 
 What stock do you want to buy and how many ? 
 Let me get the asking price of the stock . Just a moment . Oh , now the asking price is $ 90 each share . By the way , what is the offering price ? 
 Then the difference between the asking price and the offering price is $ 2 . It's hard to take place today . 
 You can decide by yourself . 
 So , now I will buy you . Are you sure ? 
 Credit Services , how can I help you ? 
 Would that be our standard card , our gold card , or our platinum card ? 
 Well , the standard card has a lower credit limit , that's 20,000 RIB , whereas with the platinum card you can have a credit limit of 80,000 RIB . 
 It's all about credit rating and salary . If your credit rating and your salary are high enough , we can offer you the platinum card . 
 Yes , we have contracts with various luxury shops and health clubs , where if you use the card to purchase items from them , you can get some healthy discounts . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Yes , sir . Just as the sign says . How many ? 
 How many people are you paying the tax for ? 
 100 yuan each , so you owe me 200 yuan . 
 Here are your two receipts . 
 Just give these receipts to the lady at the door to immigration . Don't worry , she'll ask for them from you . 
 We are all the same the first time we travel overseas . You guys have a nice trip . 
 Hello ! So , you're back . Do you have everything with you ? 
 We will need detailed information regarding the full name of the company , the company address ... 
 And also , the bank and branch name the company holds an account with and the account number . 
 What's the purpose for this check ? Would you like to know its repayment capacity ? 
 As it's confidential there is a certain amount of red tape , but it shouldn't take too long . There is , of course a service fee of 300 RIB to be paid . 
 Good morning , and welcome to Live Tech . It is my honor to make this presentation for you . Let me begin by explaining some of our digital cameras ' selling points . You will see immediately that they are very stylish , but what you can't see is the cutting-edge technology inside . All of our cameras are light , compact , and easy to use . 
 Be my guest . Live Tech's digital cameras combine point-and-shoot simplicity with the ability to easily turn pictures into great-looking prints . Furthermore , it allows users to transfer pictures to a computer while the camera recharges . 
 Sure , Just push the button , like ... 
 I think you will find these are the best digital cameras on the market today . 
 Excuse me . I am looking for a book called Little Women , but I can't find it anywhere . 
 Will you have it later ? 
 That's terrific . Thank you . 
 Let me feel your forehead . I'm so glad it wasn't strep throat . 
 But I'm not sure you're strong enough yet . Here's some seafood rice soup I made . It's delicious . 
 But the last two days were a weekend . 
 How can I get to Lakeside Park ? 
 Will it take me straight there ? 
 Good morning . What can I do for you , sir ? 
 Sure . Come to look at these styles . They sell very well . 
 How about these ? They are the current bestsellers . 
 Yes , I will find one for you . Here you are . It's made of exceptionally good quality , pure wool , and is very soft . 
 Yeah , this is the latest model.If you like it , you can try it on . 
 well , I am a little bit out of shape . I think I should get some exercise to keep fit . what kind of service do you offer ? 
 how can you get that done ? 
 what else ? 
 sounds pretty good . How much do you charge ? 
 perhaps one month . I'll just have a try at first . 
 OK , I'll take it . 
 You are lucky , sir . We are about to set out . It's a tour to the White House . 
 2 hours . You won't get late for your train . 
 I have found it quite different here from China since I came to the United States . 
 Some friends of mine took me to the mall to go shopping . It was so big . I think I could get lost if I went there alone . 
 Not really many . I was told that on weekends there were always the flea markets , so I decided to come to the flea market to buy a bargain . 
 I have heard about it while in China . it is called a " yard sale " . I didn't have any idea of that until today when I came here to the big " yard sale " . 
 Okay , here's the lease . Read it over before you sign it . As you can see , the deposit is $ 300 . 
 Yes , assuming there's been no damage to the apartment . Before you move in , you can make a list of any marks , scratches , and so forth that are already there . 
 Great . You can move in next Monday . Your first month's rent is due then . 
 Of course . 
 It's made of genuine ivory , besides , it's of exquisite workmanship . The price is marked 200 yuan . 
 Congratulations ! I heard that you are going to take a two-week training course in the headquarter . 
 Sure it is . This is a changing world . Does the training course cover the new law and regulation issued last month ? They are very useful for us . 
 Well , good for you . I hope you can get what you want from the training . 
 George , did you remember to buy me the book ? 
 When will you buy it then ? 
 What can I do for you ? 
 Would you like regular car wash package ? 
 Well , we will wash the exterior form top to bottom . We use a special shampoo , which gives the body that extra shine . 
 Of course . We wash the windows inside and out . 
 We use a vacuum cleaner that removes all the dirt , and we throw away all of the trash that we can find . 
 OK . I see . 
 Not yet . I am looking for a black suitcase . 
 Yes . I would prefer Nike . 
 Thank you . 
 No thanks . We just need our check . Have you seen the waitress ? 
 The service here has been really great , don't you think ? 
 So , let's look at the check . The total is $ 36.00 . 
 Usually people leave 15 % , but this was exceptional service . I am thinking that maybe 20 % would be appropriate . 
 OK , so that will bring her tip to $ 7.20 . Add it to the $ 36.00 and the total is $ 43.20 . 
 We'll have to make sure to come back here again real soon . 
 Let me just park my car in a better position . Alright , miss . Where ’ s the luggage ? 
 where are you going , Jane ? 
 I saw her yesterday . She was a little better . 
 No , you needn't . A number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital . 
 Yes . I caught a number 7 bus yesterday , and they said I had taken a wrong bus . 
 But number 13 buses leave from the center of town . You'll have to walk two miles to catch one . 
 Oh , that's right . You are supposed to deliver a brief on that account tomorrow . I know there are some things I need to share with you about that . But , gosh , I don't know ... Things are really busy for me today , the only time I can manage to squeeze out might be over lunch break ... 
 It's okay ... I've already had several days in a row working through lunch ... 
 You don't have to do that ... 
 Actually I do like Chinese ... Let's make it a date for Chop Suey and the Martin account at about twelve thirty . Does that sound good ? 
 Can I make a reservation ? 
 7 o'clock tonight and there will be 5 persons . 
 Do you have a VIP room ? 
 Please point out the painful place with your finger . Is there any relation between the pain and the weather ? 
 Have you ever had any trauma ? 
 Does the pian become more intense at night ? 
 Do you have the sensation of ants crawling over the painful part ? 
 I'd like to treat you with acupuncture if you agree . 
 Acupuncture may cause just a little pain , but it also causes a certain feeling of numbness and distension . We'll try it every day for seven days . Will that be all right ? 
 Hello . This is Lucy from ABC Company . Is this Monica ? 
 I am calling to inform you that you have passed the first two rounds of interview . Could you please come for the final round ? It is scheduled on the morning of next Monday 10AM in the HR manager office . 
 Ok , see you then , bye . 
 May I help you ? 
 How long do you have ? 
 New York is full of place of interest , such as Times Square , Broadway , Wall street and Ground Zero and Statue of Liberty . 
 Excuse me , could you tell me which bus I should take to go to the railway station ? 
 How often dose this bus go there ? 
 I really can't wait that long . Are there any other buses that can take me there ? 
 Where can I find the bus ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Hello , miss . Check out please . 
 Sure , here you are . 
 Yes . I enjoy my stay here . 
 Here is the money . 
 Someone ought to clean it today . 
 No , he cleaned it last time . It's your turn . 
 Oh dear , is it really my turn ? In that case , I'll clean tomorrow . 
 Then I'll clean it the day after tomorrow . 
 Good evening , ma'am . Table for one ? 
 Will this table be all right ? 
 Certainly . How about this one ? 
 ( Handing her a menu ) Your waiter will be here in a minute to take your order . 
 You're right . Watching movies at home is way cheaper than going to the theater , too . I like downloading movies too because it's easy and fast . 
 Have you ever heard of a movie rental company called Netflix ? They send the movies directly to your house in the mail . 
 Yeah , but I wish they delivered video games too . Then I would never leave my house ! 
 Yes . I had a bad traffic accident.Look , my car looks like a squashed coke can . 
 No , I didn't . That car was too fast . 
 I don't remember . 
 40 miles per hour . 
 Just straight . 
 No , I didn't get hurt . Thanks for your concern . 
 Good morning , Mr . Chu . Would you like me to brief your schedule for today ? 
 You are scheduled to meet Mr . Thompson of ABC Company at eleven this morning . Then , you have a lunch appointment with Mr . Li . And this afternoon at four you will attend a press conference . 
 All right . Do you want me to cancel the reservation for you ? 
 The proposal is being repaired right now and I think it will be ready by tomorrow morning . 
 You have a very good taste , sir . Would you like to try it on ? 
 Here you are 
 It's just around the comer . 
 Yes . One moment , please . 
 Yes , I need to buy a computer for this semester . I was told it is cheaper to buy computers here . 
 I don't know much about computers . But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory . And I need a printer . 
 Is that a lot ? Sixty-four ? 
 History . 
 Thirty percent ? 
 Wow . That's really good . And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student ? 
 Hmm . Hey , wait . This has an Apple on it . Is this an Apple computer ? 
 I don't want Macintosh . I want PC . 
 What ? Are you serious ? 
 But nobody uses Macintosh ! 
 Yes , I'm from Taiwan . 
 But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese . 
 Hmm . I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision . I'm sorry . 
 Well , thanks for your advice . I will probably come back later . 
 Did you find everything ok today ? 
 Yes . But you must return it within 30 days . 
 There will be no charge at all . However you must show us the receipt . Could you sign it here , please ? 
 All right . Keep you receipt . If something comes up , you can show it to us and we will give you a refund . 
 Excuse me , here is my claim tag , but I can't find my baggage . 
 Just one piece . 
 It's a big leather suitcase with my name ' Lily ' on it . 
 Thank you . 
 I worked as a personnel manager in a state-owned company , and then I transferred to joint venture as a sales manager . So I am familiar with the food market in China . 
 They treated me very well . We cooperated harmoniously and respected each other . 
 I have learned some skills about how to deal with clients and how to behave myself as a personnel manager . 
 I preferred working with other colleagues when I worked in my previous company . I think teamwork and cooperation are very important . No matter how competent he or she is in a company , he can ’ t do without them . 
 When was your reservation ? 
 Would you mind telling me the reason ? 
 Oh , I see . Would you like me to reschedule you for another time ? 
 But you have to pay the fee for refund . 
 Excuse me . Can I get a ticket on the next flight to Frankfurt ? 
 What's the fare for a single ticket ? 
 Can you give me a special offer ? 
 How about a round trip ? Could you offer us something more ? 
 Hi . How can I help you ? 
 Yes , we are . What position are you looking for ? 
 I ’ m sorry . The application for this position has closed . 
 We have only one position open . 
 Gas Meter Reader . This is a wonderful job for the right person , regular hours , no night shifts , no supervisor behind you , and good pay . 
 Sure . 
 No kidding ! When did that happen ? 
 Oh , no . 
 Sixty two cars . Oath . Do they know how many casualties yet ? 
 That's amazingly low for such a huge accident ! 
 Oh , my computer crashed again ! 
 That would be great ! I hate working with computers ! 
 Ah ! It hurts . Don't touch it . 
 The shoulder . 
 It's not a cut . It's a gash ! It's bigger than a cut ! Ah ! I need a doctor . 
 I'm bleeding too much . 
 Yes . My bike has one under the seat . Get it , quick ! 
 Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist.That will work as a tourniquet.After that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound . 
 No , forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood . 
 I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed . What do you think ? Damn , it hurts ! 
 I'm lucky I wasn't killed . I must have been going around forty-five miles an hour.There was too much gravel on that corner . I slid out . 
 Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped.Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk . 
 There . Stop ! 
 Mike , you're late again . 
 Do you think I believe the story like that ? 
 How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ? 
 Ok , hold it . Remember to be punctual next time 。 
 You'd better . 
 If the goods are to be transshipped from one means of transportation to another during the course of the entire voyage , it's called ' combined transportation ' . 
 It's simpler and cheaper to arrange multi-model combined transportation . 
 I've got several good reasons . I've been here several years , my work has proven to be good , and I've noticed that people in comparable jobs get paid more than I do . 
 Well , I've noticed all the new cars around here , for one thing . 
 That's understandable . Well , rather than comparing my salary with someone else's , perhaps we could talk about my job performance . Surely you've noticed the extra hours I've put in recently ? 
 That would be very good of you , Mr . White . 
 Yes , is there something wrong ? 
 So sorry , I must have confused the orders . I'll check it . 
 I'm really sorry , I'll bring you a hot one right away . 
 What are you getting ? 
 Don ’ t forget to also get a new mixer . I lent the old one to my brother and he broke it . 
 I ’ m actually thinking of completely refurnishing the kitchen and getting a new stove , oven , dishwasher and trash compacter . 
 Do you need any help ? 
 I like xeroxing . 
 OK , I will get right to that . 
 I just started working here . 
 I'd like to , but I am very busy . 
 Personal Loans , how may I help ? 
 Not a problem . We offer a Personal Loan for Studying Abroad for anyone who's studying overseas , regardless of the circumstances . Anyone is eligible to apply 
 Not exactly . Our policy states that the loange could be the person studying abroad , for example , you , or your direct relative or spouse . 
 There are no age limitations as such just that the loange should be below 55 years and of course , old enough to get a loan , meaning over 18 years of age . 
 Did you know that drinking beer helps you sing better ? 
 Well , usually people think I'm a terrible singer , but after we all have a few beers , they say I sound a lot better ! 
 Then after a few beers , you'll be singing in Taiwanese ? 
 Hello , how can I help ? 
 That does depend on where you plan to travel . If you are planning to travel to Hong Kong or Macao we can exchange up to 1,000 USD for you . If your destination is elsewhere , we can exchange up to 2,000 USD . 
 OK , I'll process that for you now . 
 I got laid off today . 
 Yeah . 
 My boss said I didn ’ t have enough skills to do the job well . 
 I ’ m going to start taking classes at the local community college to try to improve my skills . Then I ’ ll start looking for a new position . 
 Well , it's a short distance flight , so we don't serve meals . But there are some drinks . 
 You have an unusual accent , Mr . Robbins . Where are you from originally ? If you don ’ t mind me asking . 
 I guess that must be what I ’ m hearing , I really couldn ’ t place it . Do go back to Madrid often ? 
 Good morning , Madam ! Can I help you ? 
 Oh , look at these two watches , aren't they lovely ? 
 How about this one ? It's graceful in style . 
 Sure . 
 500 dollars , Madam . 
 Surely . As this is the latest model , and you can also set the alarm . 
 Just do like this.Very simple . 
 Excuse me , what time do you expect to land in Berlin ? 
 Do you have any idea how long it will take to clean customs ? 
 Where did you work as a teacher before ? 
 What teaching experience have you had ? 
 Do you have wake-up service ? 
 OK . I understand . 
 Well , I would prefer you to call me up tomorrow at 6:30 
 Excuse me , Is this the bus I should take to get to the Central Park ? 
 Where should I change for the Park ? 
 But I don't know which stop is Tinge Depot . 
 Thank you . 
 Front Desk , may I help you ? 
 Is there anything uncomfortable in your room ? 
 May I have your room number , sir ? 
 OK . Mr . Wang , may I send a room attendant to check it for you first ? 
 ( 15 minutes later ) Mr . Wang , we are deeply sorry for the inconvenience . The maintenance might last for a long time , may I offer you another room ? 
 Mary , you have found several companies that are hiring , right ? 
 Have you called to inquire about the positions ? 
 What's the matter ? 
 What a pity ! 
 It's frustrating ! 
 Wonder why they do that ! 
 Don't be discouraged . Just keep trying and you will find a job eventually . 
 Well , this is certainly a nice place , Mr . Taylor . What sort of public transportation is nearby ? 
 Yes , two . 
 We send our kids to private school , but that ’ s good to know too . 
 Great . Well , we ’ ll have to think about it , but the place looks great . 
 Can you deliver it , please ? 
 In Camden Town . 
 All right . But I'm only in on Saturday . 
 Afternoon , please , if that's possible . 
 It's huge . 
 Yes , of course . 
 Hmm . You have three cameras . Are you a photographer ? 
 I see . And what's in this bag ? 
 I thought you said you didn't have any food with you today . 
 I'm sorry , Mr . Lee . Egg tarts are food too . We will have to confiscate these . 
 Yes , we will have to dispose of them . 
 I know . One out of every three travelers from Taiwan seems to be carrying them.They are being smuggled in by the thousands . 
 No , not today at least . Enjoy your visit to the United States , Mr . Lee . 
 Brooke , I have bad news . 
 I called the airlines to reconfirm the reservations today . 
 I'm sorry . I didn't reconfirm in time and they gave away half of the seats . 
 They said that they did . I've been so busy ... 
 I didn't think there would be a problem . 
 I'm sorry . We're still going . I got reservations for all of us on the 31st . It will be OK . Trust me . 
 Brooke ! 
 Now what are you doing ? 
 Nasty . You'd better not rub your eyes . 
 And you'd better not cry or you'll have black streaks running down your face . 
 Just a few minutes . I need to make a list of the things that we need . 
 I forgot about the potatoes . Oh , I almost forget that we need a microwave oven badly . What kind of tea do you prefer ? Green tea or flower tea ? 
 We don ’ t have enough cash , but I ’ ll take my credit card . 
 I ’ m all right , thanks . Just a little tired . 
 Yeah , I got home around two . 
 Where are you now ? 
 What does your car look like ? 
 I am starving . 
 I'm still hungry . 
 I just need a snack . 
 I don't have the slightest clue . 
 I'm not sure what kind I want . 
 I think I will do that . 
 I've known from your resume that you are a college graduate . 
 What did you take as your major in college ? 
 What kinds of work were you in charge of in the previous company ? 
 All right , I see . Why do you want to work for a Sino-American joint venture enterprise now ? 
 Well , Mr . Zhang , you must know , what we need is a capable accountant , and we won't have enough time to tell him some other things . 
 Are you ready to order now , sir ? 
 What would you like to have for your appetizer , sir ? 
 And what would you like to have for the main course 
 Apple , banana and strawberry pie . 
 And what would you like for dessert ? 
 What flavor would you like ? 
 Thank you . I'll bring your order right away . 
 I am sorry you don't like it , sir . But that's just the special point of the dish . 
 Yes , hope you can enjoy it . 
 What kind of wine do you offer ? 
 Thanks . 
 What do you recommend ? 
 I'd like to try something typically Chinese . 
 OK . Let me try it . 
 Thank you . 
 I'm just taking a break between washing the windows and cleaning the toilet . 
 I'm doing my best , Grandma ... 
 Uh-oh , here we go ... 
 My coach wants you to check my blood pressure . 
 I don ’ t have any symptoms of high blood pressure . 
 What test do you do for high blood pressure ? 
 When you get the reading , what information does it give you ? 
 I am hoping that this test goes well for me . 
 Yes . I ’ m looking for a winter jacket . 
 A medium is fine for me . 
 I don ’ t like the color . 
 Blue . 
 Yes . It ’ s nice . Can I try it on ? 
 Thank you . I ’ ll be right back . 
 No , there isn't , but there are some vegetables . 
 No , there aren't . I'm sorry . 
 There's a little bread and there are a few biscuits . 
 All right , I'll walk to the village and I'll get some meat . 
 You'll cook it of course ! 
 Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co-workers . 
 Well , this one is not compulsory . It is just suggestion . 
 What would you like for dessert , sir ? We have a choice of cake or ice cream . 
 oh , well , perhaps you'd like a cup of coffee or tea instead . 
 I have been getting headaches almost every day lately . 
 I never had very many headaches before , but the last few weeks I have been getting a lot of them . 
 My mother just passed away last Tuesday . 
 I have been working really hard , and sleep has not been a priority . 
 No , I haven ’ t hit my head . 
 Daniel . Mind your eye ! 
 Can you help me with my timesheet ? 
 No , I don't know where to find one . 
 Yes , I can do that . 
 No , I don't know what that is . 
 Yes , I understand how to do this . 
 That was easy ! 
 May I help you , sir ? 
 Should I take a look at your battery ? 
 Your car is ready . 
 250 yuan , please ! 
 You should know about the oil crisis . 
 Oh John , I thought we said we would start eating right ! Remember ? Our new healthy lifestyle ? That ’ s all junk food ! 
 Well , healthy food , of course ! I got some whole wheat bread , skimmed milk , fresh fish and organic carrots ... 
 They were grown without using any chemicals that are harmful to our health . And yes , John , we need organic carrots ... 
 Yup , better for the environment and better for us ! 
 I like doughnuts . 
 Not yet . Do we need to take it with us ? 
 Is that hard to get a passport ? 
 It is hard to believe this little thing is so valuable to us . 
 I would like to know the state of the residential property market right now because I have an apartment to sell .

 Flat C . 15 / F , Tong House , Tai Koo Shing . 
 Its gross area is approximately nine hundred square feet . There's one living room , one dining room , one master bedroom and two other bedrooms . 
 It faces south with a hillside view . 
 I would like to ask for four point five million Hong Kong dollars . 
 Johnson , and my contact number is 2876543 2 . My office number is 2123456 7 . 
 In about one month . 
 No problem . 
 Thank you . 
 I have to say , my favorite movie is Superbad . 
 Honestly , it is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time . 
 I didn't think you saw that movie . 
 I was laughing through the whole movie . 
 Same here . 
 Of course . 
 I am Looking for a T-shirt . 
 What kind of material is this ? 
 Can I try it on ? 
 OK . Do yon have a pen and a paper now ? 
 Our company is in Pudding new area in Shanghai . 
 No , not yet . I just want to hair cut . 
 I want it short . 
 I mean very short . shorter than it ’ s now . 
 No . you can cut quite a bit off , I like it to be very short all over . You see what I mean . 
 Yes . And Chinese style . 
 No , thank you . 
 No , Nothing will be kind . 
 That ’ s very good . 
 The headlines are all about the presidential election in the united states . Few other stories made the front pages . 
 There ’ s an interesting feature article in the chronicle about doing business in china and the daily news has printed a report about the special economic zone near pairs . We have a subsidiary company located there . 
 Generally , the reporters take positive lines . They do point out a few problems that we need to be aware of , but there ’ s nothing worrying in the reports . In the classifieds , one of our competitors is advertising for people who speak Japanese . 
 Not really . They all seem to focus on the election . There have been several letters printed in the chronicle regarding that controversial article on drugs that they printed last week . 
 Sure . There you are . 
 Do you know what package you want to get ? 
 We have movie channel packages . 
 You can get the sports package . 
 We have that package . 
 Is there anything else you would like ? 
 You will be able to add or get rid of channels another day . 
 Do you want to sent this letter by ordinary or registered mail ? 
 Anything valuable in it ? 
 In that case , you ’ d better have it registered . 
 Yes . When your friend gets it , he ’ ll sent the receipt which you send it by mail . then you can be sure he ’ s received . 
 I think we should do the floors before we work on the curtains and walls . 
 Hmm Maybe you're right . But I can't stand all this green carpet here . And besides , I know how to paint . I will just cover everything with drop cloth . I won't get anything on the floor . 
 Yes , I'm sure I've done a lot of house painting in my life . And my mother was very picky . If I got even a tiny drop of paint on her furniture , she would get furious . So I learned to be very careful . 
 Absolutely not . We can remove the carpet ourselves . Carpet is held down with carpet nails . You just need to pull it hard and it will come up . 
 Yes . But we should hire someone for that . That will probably be expensive . And it has to be done right . 
 Sure . If we can get an appointment with someone to do the floors , we should probably be able to have the furniture in here after a week or so . I can get all the carpet out this weekend . 
 Whatever meal that you plan on making . 
 I do all the cooking . 
 Save it . If you want something to eat , then make it yourself . 
 I had a long day today . I really am not in the mood to make anything . 
 Thanks . I'm going to go take a nap . 
 Thank you . 
 Sure , just ask . What can I do for you ? 
 No sweat . It ’ s a piece of cake . 
 Absolutely . I ’ m a great mechanic . 
 Anytime . 
 Hello there . I need some advice about personal finance . Could you help me please ? 
 Well , I've been very busy recently and I'm having trouble keeping up to date with everything , so I just wondered what exact service you offer . 
 That sounds perfect and just what I'm looking for . 
 I'd like a coke . 
 Okay . 
 Red . 
 The Cross Bakery building ? Oh sure . You're actually walking in the opposite direction . 
 No , east is the other direction . To get to the Bakery , you need to turn around and go three blocks to Broadway . When you get to the intersection of Broadway and Elm , you hang a left . Go straight down that street for half a block and then you'll see the building on your left . 
 Yeah , you've got it . Do you want me to show you the way ? 
 Could I speak to Mary , please ? 
 This is Bob . Where have you been , Mary ? I have been trying to get on to you for the last half hour . Don ’ t you leave your home at 7 
 I arrived this morning . I would have rung you before but I have been terribly busy all day attending a conference . It has only just ended . Are you doing anything tonight , Mary ? 
 But that is terrible ! I am only here for one night ! 
 I didn ’ t know myself till this morning when my boss suddenly dashed into the office and told me to rush up here to attend the conference . 
 Yes , he does but when he was driving up here last night he had an accident and was taken to hospital . So I am doing it instead . Mary , Must you go out tonight ? Couldn ’ t you get out of it ? 
 No , I will stay another day.my boss will get over it . Would you like to meet me for lunch tomorrow ? 
 It is all right . I will call the boss and tell him I am staying another day . I stayed an extra night in Boston last month and he didn ’ t seem to put about it . 
 I will tell you tomorrow . See you tomorrow , Mary . 
 Evening , table for three , please . 
 Yes , I do . I have made reservations under the name of Wang . 
 No smoking , please . Could we have table by the window ? 
 What am I supposed to do with this plastic cup ? 
 How , exactly , does this work ? 
 When I finish , what should I do then ? 
 What is my doctor testing me for ? 
 Will I know the results right away ? 
 Hi , Mike , where are you going ? 
 At this time ? Why don ’ t you go there tomorrow ? It is almost dark . 
 But I have seen many toys in your home . 
 But if he always destroys toys and asks you to buy new ones , what will you do ? 
 And you still buy him new ones ? 
 You will spoil him . 
 Well , there are lots of things to consider . Quality and delivery times are as important as price . We also take into consideration technical support and after-sales service . We look for companies with a good track record . We place a few trial orders and if everything goes well , we put them on our approved list . It's important to choose companies you feel you can work closely with . 
 I see . Well , now you can have it as long as you bring it back by nine thirty . 
 I ’ m afraid not , Nick . That ’ s the best I can do . 
 I'd like to get a good RPG . Can you recommend any ? 
 This one looks pretty good , but I'd like to see more before I make up my mind . Do you have any other suggestions ? 
 Hmm , it's a tough choice , but I think I'll go with this one . 
 Yes , speaking . 
 Hold on a minute please . I ’ ll have my assistant check that part . 
 We may be sold out of them . Let me check the back . ( The clerk goes to the storeroom , returning a few minutes later . ) I'm afraid we're out of stock . Would you like a rain check ? 
 Let me get the manager to sign one for you . 
 It ’ s nice to meet you ! Guess we ’ ll be working together . 
 Good . Well , welcome aboard , Ms , Robbins . 
 Here is the notice . 
 Sure , here you are . 
 Please come in and sit down . I ’ m happy to finally meet you . 
 I ’ m sorry I kept you waiting . 
 Thank you . Can I get you some coffee or a cup of tea ? 
 Good , then let ’ s get to the interview . 
 Dentale Associates . I'm afraid there's nobody available to answer your call . Please leave your name and telephone number and we'll call you back . Please speak clearly after the beep . 
 What sort of shift-system do you operate ? 
 Do you ever have to do the night shift ? 
 Could you tell me which kind of payment you'll choose ? 
 Will you please have the check certified ? 
 It's just our policy . We would accept a certified check or a direct bank remittance . 
 Hi . Can I help you with anything ? 
 Sure . Let me get it out for you . What is your size ? 
 Here you go . 
 Actually , we have a few to choose from . They are over here . 
 Oh . I'm sorry . I'll check the price for you . It is $ 199 . 
 Yes . Why don't you try this one on . 
 Sure . Here you go . 
 Sure . Take your time . 
 No problem at all . 
 I'm not sure . What's the difference ? 
 Mostly just to browse the Internet and send emails to friends . 
 What can I do for you , Madam ? 
 What size do you take ? 
 How about this pair ? They're well-made . 
 In fact , They'll stretch a bit later . 
 All right.Here you are . 
 Hey daddy ! You look great today . I like your tie ! By the way , I was wondering can I & 
 I haven't even told you what it is yet ! 
 Do you think I could borrow the car ? I ’ m going to concert tonight . 
 Egg ! I told you about it last week ! Smelly Toes is playing , and Eric asked if I would go with him ! 
 Duh ! He's like the hottest and most popular guy at school ! Come on , dad ! Please ! 
 Fine then ! Would you mind giving me 100 bucks ? 
 That ’ s so unfair ! 
 I guess there is some kind of virus seeking into my computer , I can ’ t send out this e-mail . Do you have the number of the text port ? 
 Of course not , I appreciate that . 
 I see . What can I do now ? 
 What's good today ? 
 How is it done ? 
 Sound nice , I will try it . 
 What's the soup of the day ? 
 Thousand Island , please . 
 Where shall I put it , miss ? 
 But Peter and Tony put all their paper in the basket a few moments ago.Now it's full . 
 Yes , miss . 
 In the playground , miss . 
 Are you all right ? 
 What's going on ? 
 Are you serious ? 
 Did he hurt you ? 
 I can't believe that . 
 I'll take you , if you'd like . 
 Excuse me , would you like to be our guide ? 
 It's our first time to be here , so would you please arrange a schedule for us ? 
 When was the palace built ? 
 I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ? 
 I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ? 
 You need a babysitter . 
 I could have Suzy stay at my place . 
 Why not ? 
 I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston.She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely . 
 I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible . 
 I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself . 
 So click here , then up to the top . 
 Then open that window . Yeah , that one . 
 And that's it . You're done . 
 Hello , I set up my laundry yesterday , are they being ready ? 
 Oh , no . I ’ m leaving for Japan at eleven this morning . 
 I thought it the same day service . Anyway , please do a hurry . 
 Well , then . Would you send to Japan , please ? 
 Excuse me . I lost my way . Could you tell me where the scholar cinema is , please ? 
 Is that near here ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Yes , I want to deposit 1000 Yuan in my bank account . 
 OK ... Here you are . Any problem on that ? 
 Yes , I do . Here it is , and the cash . 
 Sure . 
 Yes . Can you tell me what the interest rate is now ? 
 Thanks . 
 Yes , but not here . Have you got registered yet ? 
 The registration office . Did you bring your records with you ? 
 Is anybody here with you ? Parents or siblings ? 
 You are a brave kid . Go ahead to the registration office first , then to the doctors . 
 It's in the hall on the first floor . 
 No , kid . This is the gynecology department . 
 Yeah , It's only for girls . 
 It's no problem . I have time today , and I think it's important that you find a good place . 
 So what do you see in there ? 
 Can you afford that much ? 
 Yes , an efficiency is a small apartment.Usually one large room and a small bathroom.There is often a small kitchen too . So it's good for one person . 
 That means the apartment has furniture in it . 
 Sometimes it's good , sometimes it's bad . You have to like the furniture . 
 It's still pretty expensive . 
 Alright . What's the phone number ? 
 Got it . What else do you see ? 
 No . It probably means they have a large apartment.Probably a living room , kitchen and three bedrooms.They need someone for the empty bedroom . 
 Yes , it might be an advantage for you . You are a foreigner , after all.If they're alright roommates , you could learn a lot from them . 
 Got it.Let ' s call these two and see if we can make appointments to see the apartments . 
 Don't mention it , Larry . What are friends for anyway ? 
 How long have you been like this ? 
 I think you've got the flu . There's a lot of it going around . 
 Get this prescription filled and go straight to bed . 
 What's the matter ? 
 Well , if there is anything I can do to help , let me know . 
 Sure , sir . But can I suggest a cup of warm water instead , I think it may help settle your stomach down . 
 You can find an airsick bag in the seat pocket in front of you . 
 You are welcome . I'll be back with the warm water in a minute . 
 What is it ? 
 Okay . 
 How late can we stay out ? 
 But if we're going to be late ? 
 What is this for ? 
 Okay , thanks . 
 Could I be of any help to you ? 
 Do you like miniskirt ? It's popular among young girls . The pleated skirt also sells well . 
 What about the divided skirt ? 
 Excuse me , professor . I need to go home now . 
 I just feel funny . 
 I have a terrible headache . 
 I already have some medicine at home if I could just get there . 
 Thank you , but the bus stops right at my house . 
 so , have you seen all three The Lord of the Rings movies ? 
 that's the Return of the King , right ? 
 I thought the special effects were amazing , but I got a bit confused . The plot was too complicated for me . 
 no . did you ? 
 yes , trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me . 
 most movies are . Another problem for me was the film was dubbed in German with English subtitles . 
 I heard that The Return of the King was nominated for 11 Oscars . 
 How may I help you ? 
 Everything on it ? 
 Would you like fries with that ? 
 Would you like anything to drink ? 
 Will that be all ? 
 Your total comes to $ 5.48 . 
 Excuse me , sir ? I ’ m afraid this is a no-smoking area . 
 I ’ m sorry , sir . Smoking is not permitted in this area . 
 Ladies and gentlemen , we are heading towards the first spot of our trip-the Louvre . 
 Yes . There are so many famous paintings on show . I am sure it will be an unforgettable trip . 
 Half an hours later . 
 It ’ s a programme about islam . It ’ s very interesting . 
 They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage haj . 
 Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith . 
 That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed . 
 That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents . 
 Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages . 
 I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there . 
 Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way . 
 I hope they ’ re not too hard ! 
 I think that I would be a perfect fit in this company . I have a unique combination of strong technical acumen , and outstanding soft skills . you know , I excel at building strong , long-term customer relationships . For example , when I headed the customer support department in my previous company , our team solved about seventy percent of our customers ’ problems . I decided that we needed better information and technical preparation on our products , so after I implemented a series of training sessions in coordination with our technical department , we were able to solve ninety percent of our customers ’ issues . Given the opportunity , I could bring this kind of success to this company . 
 I struggle with organization and time management . Punctuality has never been a strength of mine . I find it hard to organize my time efficiently . I have actually addressed this weakness recently , by attending a workshop on efficient time management . It helped me a lot , by providing me with great insights on how to get organized and use my time efficiently , so I think I ’ m getting better now . 
 Great , thanks a lot ! I hope to hear from you ! Good bye . 
 Hey , it's an English song ! Sing with us , Ryan ! 
 Everyone in Taiwan knows it . Come on ! Sing with us ! 
 I'm concerned about your car . 
 But I think I can help to fix it . 
 I feel terribly bored . I'm going to take a job . 
 Then I can buy my own car . 
 And pay for my own clothes . 
 Excuse me , is this where I can catch a bus to the museum ? 
 Thank you . 
 Yes . 
 Yes , I've got some coins . How much is the fare ? 
 I see . How often does this bus run at this time of day ? 
 Can I take a picture ? 
 What a pity . Do you have reproductions of this paint ? 
 Thank you . 
 I'd like to sit in the rear . 
 Yes 
 Wine , please . 
 Something real Australian . 
 Yes . That would be fine . 
 I'll have Chicken and Ginger Burger with Chilli Dressing . 
 Yes , I'd like to look at some suits . 
 Size 41 . I want something in dark flannel . 
 It feels all right.But if it were a darker color , I'd like it better.This seems too light for winter.Do you think you could get me one ? 
 It looks good.But can I try it on ? 
 Thanks.It ' s comfortable.Well , how much is it , please ? 
 Ok . I'll take it.Here ' s the money . 
 I have been a Production Manager . 
 3 years . 
 I had introduced an advanced product line , which increased the output and lessened the cost . 
 Frankly speaking , three . If your company employs me , it will be my fourth . 
 Yes . I was awarded the title of Advanced Worker last year . 
 Although I could not say that everything is perfect there , I still very much appreciate what the company has given me , especial many chances . 
 They would say I am a responsible friend and a capable colleague . 
 Yes , I have brought them with me . Here they are . 
 I think that you have covered all the important points already.But if I have any questions later I will contact you . 
 How long will it take to make five hundred ? 
 Good . 
 Well , you'd better sit down for this . It has been terminal lung cancer . 
 We ’ ll try our best , but you'd better prepare for the worst . 
 I have said that we will try our best . You can trust us . But you know her situation . 
 About half a year . 
 No . But it will be soon . Look , there are two empty seats over there . Let ’ s get them before somebody else does . 
 Now , Let ’ s make ourselves comfortable since we have got quiet a long way to go . 
 Excuse me , sir , could you please tell me the way to Aidan Bookstore ? 
 Er ... Is it far from here ? 
 Then I'll walk.Many thanks . 
 What are your terms of sale ? 
 My understanding is that CIF means the seller is responsible for prepaying shipping costs and arranging for the insurance policy . 
 Is it possible to consider FOB ? That way , we will handle the insurance through our broker . 
 I ’ m thinking about redecorating my bedroom . I bought this magazine in order to get some ideas . What do you think of this ? 
 I ’ d like to have the bad and the wardrobe . 
 Yes , it would . It ’ s very expensive though . 
 Yes . I ’ m sure I could find something similar at one . I ’ d also like to get a new carpet for my bedroom . 
 That ’ s a good idea . I ’ m really looking forward to redoing my bedroom . 
 They're in aisle 2A , down that way . 
 Yes , they're in ... let me think ... Aisle 3B , if I remember right . 
 Don't mention it . 
 Pleased to meet you , Mr . Farley . 
 OK May I ask whether there is probation ? 
 Shall we have some soup first ? 
 Ok , and what about the main course ? Which would you rather have , fish or meat ? 
 Don't you like fish then ? 
 Shall we have some white wine then ? 
 What would you like for dessert ? 
 Fine , and after dinner , shall we go to a disco ? 
 How long have we had the A3 printer in the sales department ? 
 I'm not sure but there seems to be something wrong with it . Is it still under guarantee ? 
 Excuse me . I ’ m a stranger here and lost my way . 
 Sure . Can I get to the central department stall this way ? 
 Is it far ? 
 And do you know where the national bank is ? 
 Thanks very much . 
 Thank you . I won ’ t miss it . 
 These are your products ? 
 May I have your name card ? I am always concerned about the newest computer . 
 Thank you . 
 OK ! Would you like to recommend some for our reference ? 
 Welcome to IBA . How can I help you ? 
 Oh , yes . I remember . You must be Mr Xie . It's nice to put a face to a voice . 
 JD185649000023 ? Yes , found it . 175,000 Euros , is that correct ? JD185649000023 ? 
 Yes , you can . Just wait a moment and I'll do that for you now . 
 Were you able to get a look at the suspect's face ? 
 I must ask you to pick him out of a line-up . 
 Look closely at the five men in this line-up . 
 Do you see the suspect ? 
 What number is the suspect ? 
 Thank you for all your help . 
 Hurry up , will you ? 
 Good evening . Welcome to Mansion Hotel . 
 Last name , Rodgers ? 
 Very well . Welcome , Mr . Rodgers . Would you please fill out the registration card ? How are you doing today ? 
 Mr . Rodgers , how would you handle your account ?

 Certainly , I can take care of that for you . What time would you like the wake-up call ? 
 Mr . Rodgers , this is George . He will take care of your luggage and show you to your room . If there is anything I can do for you , please let me know . 
 Have a pleasant stay . 
 Morning , Meg . You look not well today ? Are you ill ? 
 Then , What ’ s the matter with you my child ? 
 Oh , come on , baby . Tell me what happened . 
 Oh . Take it easy . You can set your aim from today . 
 I'm going to the United Stated to attend my daughter's commencement . 
 Yes . But I will not take much cash with me I can ask the bank to give me the traveler's checks . So it will be safer . 
 I will go to the bank , give them my check , show them one piece of my identifications , and the most important thing is that I should sign my name to endorse the check . 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Did you have anything particular in mind ? 
 Well , we have some handmade products . Let me show you some . 
 About how much were you planning to spend ? 
 Oh , in that case . This one is OK . 
 OK . Wait for a moment , please . 
 I'm going to the movies with a friend . How about you ? 
 Well , did you want to go see a movie with me ? 
 I'm not sure yet . Is there something you want to see ? 
 So , did you want to go ? 
 Okay , sounds good . 
 I ’ d like to buy an inexpensive camera . 
 I don ’ t think I ’ ll need a Polaroid.Does this 35mm camera have an automatic flash ? 
 Okay , I ’ ll take this one.Does it come with batteries and a case ? 
 Lili , let ’ s take a vacation ! 
 Well , Lili , we can visit different places in the state in our van . We are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . Trust me , it won ’ t cost much . 
 In the van . 
 Let ’ s see . Gas , food , recreation , we won ’ t spend much . Come on . Don ’ t hesitate . We need to get out of the house once in a while . We have been working hard , haven ’ t we ? 
 The sooner the better ! I can ’ t wait ! 
 As long as we ’ re going , you can decide where to go . I trust your judgments . I know you miss Chinese food , so we can eat at a Chinese restaurant this time . 
 Hi . This is the Customer Service . How can I help you ? 
 Is it under warranty ? 
 Yes , it is still covered by our warranty . Tell me the mode number of your vacuum , please . 
 What ’ s your address , your name and your phone number ? 
 Okay . There are two Customer Service Offices in your area . The nearest one is Chadwick and Hacks Appliances .

 My pleasure . 
 I really want to stay a little longer , but I still have a meeting to attend . All in all , I am so impressed by your hospitality and your warm welcome . Thank you for the trouble you have taken . 
 During my trip here , I learned a lot and I get to know our choice of choosing your company as our partner is definitely right . I can feel and sense the potential of your company . And at last I wish our further cooperation will be sound and successful . 
 Of course , I will . 
 My major is Automobile Designing and I have received my master's degree in science . I think I can do it well . 
 I am a student engineer who mainly took charge of understanding of the mechanical strength and corrosion resistance of various materials . 
 I need a copy of the agenda . Also , may I suggest something ? I know we have many points to review today , but would it be possible to limit our meeting time to finish before four o'clock ? Many of us still have a mountain of work to do before the day's end . 
 I propose we accept the minutes . 
 I second . 
 I gave everyone a copy of the manual last week . We've had the review board going over everything , and they have come up with a final review . Here's a copy for everyone , and if you have any questions , you can talk to me after the meeting . Basically , the budget review has been completed , with maybe a few polishing details left . 
 If everyone could take a look at the final review handout , if there're any objections or corrections , let me know . Next week , we can cast the final approval . 
 If we hurry , can we get there in time ? 
 Everything's gone wrong . 
 What are we going to do now ? 
 How do you feel about this restaurant ? 
 I really enjoyed the food . 
 I enjoyed the fish the most . 
 The macadamia cake was out-of-this-world ! 
 Yes , the service really added to the experience . 
 Ann , let's go , or we will be late . 
 It is already 10:25 . 
 What time did you say the train is leaving ? 
 Yes , but what will happen if the bus is late ? 
 ( still on the bus . ) What time is it ? 
 Oh dear , we will miss our train . 
 I need to increase the amount of my L / C . It's quite a new one ; I opened it 12 days ago . 
 How do I go about that ? 
 OK , you can take that from my account . I'll fill in the form now . 
 : How are you , Mr . Ding ? I ’ m John Brown . 
 Please have a seat . I know our employment officer has already given you the information about your employee contract , but I ’ d like to go over the main details again before signing the contract . First , you ’ ll be getting a monthly salary , with one month paid vacation after one year of service . No probation is involved . 
 You ’ ll be covered by our medical plan while on duty . Since you ’ ll be middle-anagement , you , re expected to be available up to one hour past normal working hours . Any approved overtime that will be paid at time , which you can take as salary or time off . 
 A reasonable number of sick days will be covered by the company . Any extended illness will be covered by insurance . Have you read the other terms of the contract ? 
 Do you have any questions ? 
 Yes it is , but you ’ ll have to discuss the details with your manager . 
 Excuse me . I have booked one ticket on BN118 for tomorrow.But now I've changed my plan.Can you help me refund the ticket ? 
 Here is the ticket . 
 I'm so glad we decided to go on a cruise for our vacation . 
 Ah , that's all part of the fun . What do you think of these shorts ? 
 They are . I think I'm going to get a hat too . 
 Wow . You look great . 
 Excuse me , sir . I can't find my baggage . Here is my claim tag . 
 One is a small-size Nike in red and the other is a big one in black . The two are tied together . 
 Hello . Can I talk to Miss Li , please ? 
 Miss Li . Li Lin .

 Thank you for your reminding.Yes , please have it dry cleaned . 
 Mr Moon , how good to see you again . 
 Well , Corporate Agreement Savings will be based on the Agreement Deposit Contract signed by the customer and the bank together . So , this contract decides the terms and the line of basic deposit withheld while settling the account . So , if we look within the line of basic deposit , the interest should be counted at the rate of Current Deposit on the day of settlement or withdrawal . 
 If it goes beyond the basic deposit , the agreement will be settled at the rate agreement savings which has been determined by the People's Bank of China on the day you wish to settle or withdraw .

 Thank you very much . 
 Excuse me . 
 I just checked in , and there's a problem with my room .

 Well , I prefer to go on the train , but I suppose you want me to take the car . 
 And I've got to drive . You know I'm not fond of that . I found it much more relaxing to sit in the train . 
 But very much quicker . But I know we'll never agree on this subject . You prefer the car . I prefer the train .

 Gas and water are included . 
 Yes , electricity is not included in the rent . 
 A contract is an agreement which is binding on both parties mutually . A contract might be formal or informal , oral or written . An implemented contract is one which has been fully executed by both sides ; an executive contract is one which is going to be performed . They are enforceable by laws and any party who defaults the contract may be sued and forced to make compensation . 
 In an ordinary contract , the objective of a contract might be relatively simple , indicating the description of commodity , price , quantity , terms of payment and etc . 
 Well . First , make meaning clear by using concise forma language . Second , describe accurately the exact requirement . Finally , state clearly the permissible variation in quantity . 
 Well , I'd like some legal advice . Jane and I are thinking of incorporating . So Want to find out what sort of legal procedure one follows in forming a corporation .

 Yes , we are . Could we have the check please ? 
 Do you accept checks ? 
 Well , I don't have any cash with me , I'll have to put it on a credit . 
 Yes , we do , thank you .

 OK , just a little though . I'm really full . 
 What kind is it ? 
 No . This is my first time . How does it taste ?

 Can you tell me about some good deals on produce ? 
 What exactly are mangoes ?

 Maybe I won't like the taste . 
 How do I tell the difference between a ripe one and an unripe one ? 
 Where do most of them come from ? 
 Professor , excuse me , but I need to leave early . 
 I am not feeling well . 
 I think I am beginning to have an asthma attack . 
 No , I think that I should just go home because I have some medicine there . 
 I live in the dorms across the street , so I ’ ll be OK . 
 Mr . Smith , while you're out , the sales department called and asked you to lunch next Wednesday .

 I will . Enjoy your meeting ! 
 Not a problem . May I have your name , please ? 
 Hi , sir . My name is Michelle . Could you tell me when you need the room ? 
 Perhaps you didn't know that we have new room rates . Do you find that acceptable , sir ? 
 The price per night is $ 308 . 
 Fantastic ! Would you like a smoking or nonsmoking room ? 
 That'll be nonsmoking . Now , do you approve of a single queen-size bed ? 
 I'm happy to hear that , sir . Your reservation is all set except for your phone number . 
 626-555-1739 . Thank you for doing business with us , Mr . Sandals . 
 Good morning . 
 Yes , I want to change some money .

 Did you vote ? 
 Who was your vote for President ? 
 I didn ’ t expect him to win . 
 What made you think that ? 
 I thought his race would have kept him from winning . 
 That ’ s true . 
 This computer isn't working properly . 
 We need to get it fixed soon . 
 Oh , thank you very much . 
 Yes , there's one just on the other side of this building . Do you have any small change ? 
 Caroline Menzies speaking . 
 I'm afraid she's in a meeting at the moment . Who's speaking ? 
 Can I take a message , Mr Laing ? 
 Certainly . Does she have your number ? 
 01705 ... 
 455623 . 
 OK . I'll make sure she gets the message . 
 What're you doing now ? 
 You're supposed to clean your teeth before you go to bed . 
 And don't ever forget it . 
 Oh , it was okay . I had my meeting with Mitch this morning and his bottom line is that he thinks I need to show more initiative . He thinks that I need to start being more creative . 
 Well , not in so many words . But I know that productivity is a big issue for him . Oh , he said the usual things like “ Keep up the good work ” and “ Thanks for your hard work , ” but he also said that he's thinking about bringing some employees into my department . That , to me , means he's not satisfied with what I've been doing . 
 No , I Don't . Either I shape up or my job is on the line . 
 Do you really think so ? 
 Maybe you're right . Thanks , Don . I feel better . 
 What's going on ? 
 I'm throwing a party next Saturday . 
 Yeah , are you going to come ? 
 Why not ? 
 Well , why don't you ? 
 Well , that's okay . 
 What are your strengths and weaknesses ? 
 What is your problem in working ? 
 Hello again . Have you come to a decision ? 
 Visible Certificates are registered and the holders of these can report any loss directly to the bank . Also , they can be cashed in advance , before the maturity is up . 
 Unfortunately , not . You see , because they are not registered , they can be bought and sold by anyone . They also can be cashed on maturity in any nationwide financial institution . 
 Technically , yes . 
 Hey Mei Hong , how are you getting to Xi ’ an next week ? 
 Yeah but the bus takes a long time . You could fly - it ’ s not so expensive these days . 
 Ok well , you let me know your schedule and I ’ ll book a ticket for you . 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 What kind of presents do you want ? 
 OK . How about some very cool sneakers for your children ? Anyway , it won't cost you much . It's only around $ 59.95 for each pair . It might be cheaper than that in America . 
 Just a hunch , sir . 
 $ 59.95 . 
 Sorry , sir . 
 Because in this duty-free shop , your total expenditure cannot be over $ 300 and you also have one more present to buy for your wife . 
 That's good . And I can also recommend you a good one . It's the brand of DENY . 
 It's $ 60 here . 
 Of course not , sir . 
 I see by your resume that you have been working ? 
 Tell me what you know about our company , please . 
 What do you know about our major products and our share of the market ? 
 What made you decide to change your job ? 
 Do you like this job ? 
 What do you think is the most important qualification for a salesperson ? 
 I agree with you . Do you have any questions to ask about this job ? 
 I think the starting salary for a salesperson is between 1,500 - 2,000 Yuan . But the specific number will be determined according to your sales . 
 We cannot reach a final decision until we have talked to all of the other five applicants . Anyhow , we'll contact you within this month . All right . Nice meeting you . Good-bye . 
 Peter , it's time to eat breakfast . 
 Alright , you'd better hurry , your bus is coming . 
 Oh , dear , go get another pair . I'll help you change your shorts . 
 Yes , that ’ s right . To be honest , the first year was quite tough for me . I was really just treated more like an intern . I didn ’ t have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating . 
 Well slowly but surely I proved myself , and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer . 
 Yes , I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . I spent 3 years in that position , but to be honest it wasn ’ t an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long-term . 
 I just felt that the paper couldn ’ t offer me any new opportunities . I really needed a more challenging role to be honest . 
 You might send it as'Printed Matter ' . 
 Of course . How much would you want to insure these books for ? 
 Five hundred dollars , so you pay ten dollars for the insurance , that's two percent of the total value of the article . 
 What time does the next train to London leave ? 
 Is it a direct train to London ? 
 I see . One ticket to London , please . 
 Single , please . 
 Here you are . 
 Hello there , welcome to Wine World . Let me know if I can help you out at all . 
 OK , do you know what kind of food will be served ? 
 Hmm , that's a bit of a challenge . Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine . Well , let's see . have to be a white wine , of course . 
 No , I don't think so . Sushi is a very delicately flavored food , and red wine would be a jarring contrast . You need a white wine , which has more subtle flavors , to complement the fish . 
 Yes , Chardonnay is a white wine , but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet . Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites , and tends to be a bit oaky . I'd suggest that you go for something brighter , like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand . 
 That's another varietal , or type of grape , just like Chardonnay . 
 It's OK , don't worry , we'll just choose a wine from the cooler . We don't have quite as extensive a selection over here , but ... this Rhone Valley white would be lovely . 
 Well , this is a French wine , so they don't always specify the varietal on the label . The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine . This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes , mostly Viognier , I'd guess . 
 Yes , this is one of our best-sellers . It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier , which means it's more approachable . It's light and crisp , with a bit of a vanilla aroma . 
 You look really nice today . 
 Really , where did you get it ? 
 It's really nice . 
 Thank you . I just got these shoes today . 
 These are called All Star Chuck Taylors . 
 They were about forty dollars . 
 Excuse me , but can you tell me the way to the Today Mall ? 
 How long will it take me to get there ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Thanks , Jane . I was really surprised . I mean there were a lot of qualified people out there . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Jane , I appreciate it very much . I expect to see you get nominated pretty soon , too . You've been doing some great work ! 
 Next month . 
 I'm going to manage the whole accounts department . 
 Yes , the company will also give me a prize of 1,000 Yuan . 
 OK , I know what you mean . It's my treat . 
 Of course . Let's go . 
 Good afternoon.It ' s very nice to see you again . 
 I'm much better.The stomachache is gone , and the doctor is about to give me another endoscope examination to see whether the ulcer has healed . 
 How beautiful they are ! Thank you so much . 
 You're so thoughtful ! 
 Thank you for coming.Good - bye . 
 Please take us to Harvard University . By the way , is it far from here ? 
 ( Get here ) Here we are , sir . 
 It ’ s 35 dollars on the meter . 
 Thank you . Have a nice day . 
 I suppose so . A haircut , please . 
 I'd just like a trim , and don't cut it too short . 
 I think they only need a little trimming . 
 No , don't use them , please . 
 Would you trim off a bit more there , above the ear ? 
 I guess that would be better . 
 No , not that much . Now , yes , that's fine . 
 Yes . 
 Do you mind if I smoke here ? 
 Can I just turn off the AC for now and open the window and smoke indoors ? 
 It ’ s very hot and that ’ s why I ’ d like to smoke inside . 
 Oh , no problem . 
 Please . Everyone enjoys hearing the benefits of something ! 
 That is wonderful . We've been having serious problems in that area . Our internal accounts seem so messy at the moment , nothing is running smoothly and it's costing us time and money . 
 I've enjoyed conversing with you . 
 I've got to go . 
 I have to do some things , and besides , it's not polite to be nosey . 
 I really don't think it's any of your business . 
 I apologize , but I'm getting off the phone now . 
 Hello , Fairbrook Consulting , how may I help you ? 
 Certainly , what day were you thinking of ? 
 Um . . . let me double check . . . unfortunately , she ’ s booked solid on Thursday , how does next Monday work for you ? 
 Sure , Tuesday ’ s perfect . May I ask where you ’ re calling from ? 
 Oh , actually , Tuesday ’ s no good . Sorry about that . 
 It's fried sole . 
 Sure . Please wait for a moment . 
 Yes , I would like the chicken cheese enchiladas with a side of guacamole . 
 Sure I ' ll have the burrito . Do you have nachos ? 
 Sounds good . 
 Sure , I ' ll have a Corona . 
 I ’ m in a bit of a hurry , Louise . Can it wait ? 
 All right . Why don ’ t you have a seat ? What ’ s the problem ? 
 I'm still suffering from a little jetlag . 
 Saturday morning cartoons . 
 I think watching them is a great way to learn English . 
 Yeah . Is Cindy up ? 
 Let me suggest this one . It's an excellent watch , it looks good , and it's only $ 100 . 
 Uh , no . Analog watches don't come with stopwatches . You'll have to get a digital if you want a stopwatch . 
 Right here . 
 Yes . Make it out to Time After Time . 
 Thank you . 
 There're a lot of chuckholes on this old highway . Driving on it is experience-demanding . 
 Ok . You drive and do be careful . 
 My chief interest is swimming and climbing with my friends . 
 I think that the most important thing is you can ’ t live all by himself . It takes a lot of people working and cooperating together . The more really close friends I have , the better . 
 Do you know which bus will take me from PHS to Sons ? 
 It's on Fair Oaks and Orange Grove . 
 Okay , which ones do I need to take ? 
 What do I do next ? 
 Then what should I do ? 
 Is that it ? 
 I have a little problem with room 507 . 
 This room is filthy with cockroaches . 
 I've already seen nine of them and , as they say , eight is enough ! 
 You are not in a position to question my vision or my statement ! 
 Are there any beds vacant ? 
 I prefer one facing the sea . Besides , it should have a shower . 
 Well , that's fine . 
 Let me help you . OK , this is the one you want . Push this button to change the channel . We have 6 channels in all . Have a good day . 
 I would like to make an appointment to discuss the problems I keep having with my apartment . 
 We gave you a list of problems last week . 
 Well , the garbage disposal doesn ’ t work , we have rats , and the toilet is backed up . 
 These things are your responsibility , and you need to fix them immediately . 
 If these problems are not addressed immediately , I will be contacting the health department this Friday and you will not get a rent check . 
 Has someone already helped you ? 
 Which do you like best ? 
 360 yuan . 
 Sorry , sir . This is the last one we have in stock . 
 I can give you a 10 % discount . 
 I'm afraid that's the best we can do . 
 Can you look after my son for me tonight ? 
 We're now staying at the Holiday Inn . How do we get to the airport ? 
 What is the earliest one ? 
 OK , thank you . By the way , what can I do if I want to put off my flight ? 
 OK . What can I do if l want to cancel the ticket ? 
 That's reasonable . OK , thank you very much . 
 Use , I want a eye-shadow . 
 Purple . But today , I'm thinking of buying one in a bright colour . 
 May I have a try ? 
 It's still too dark . Any brighter colours ? 
 What about other brands ? 
 Oh , that's the very thing I need . 
 What's going on over there ? 
 How long does that usually take ? 
 What's happening at the far end ? 
 I've found a nice place in this district.Three bedrooms , a large kitchen , high ceilings , a tile bath and a big drawing room . 
 What about the one on the Yellow River Road ? It's a two-bedroom one , and renovated building with an eat-in kitchen . 
 How long have you been washing clothes here ? 
 How come ? 
 This is my first time washing clothes here . 
 I can't wash at home because my machine is broken . 
 That'll cost too much . 
 I have no choice . 
 I would like to buy a ticket to New York please . 
 I ’ d like to pack my bags and leave tonight . 
 Yes I know , but I just got the chance to leave and so I am going to take it no matter what . 
 I wish I could stay there , but unfortunately it will have to be a round trip ticket . 
 My return date will be the 14th . 
 Anything but a center seat is fine with me . The middle seat drives me crazy ! 
 Will there be any layovers ? 
 Perfect ! I ’ m afraid to ask , but how much is it ? 
 The government is going to organize a folk-custom activity at the end of the month . And our community is supposed to put on a performance . 
 Stuff like that but I think the lion dance is a bit too difficult and dangerous . 
 Good idea . Shall we get everyone in the community ? 
 I know that they already have a Range Dance team and then what we need is just to do some rehearsals . 
 We can raise money in the community . You know each family 10 yuan maybe . 
 Great idea . There is a travel agency nearby who would love to be our sponsor . It's a perfect chance for them to promote ethnic tourism . 
 You need to eat healthy foods and avoid unhealthy foods . 
 Fresh fruits and vegetables are important , along with protein and whole grains . 
 You don ’ t want to eat food that is high in fat . You need to avoid caffeine and sugar . 
 Getting 30 minutes of exercise a day is important . If you smoke , you need to stop . 
 Less than a serving of alcohol a day can actually be good for you . Do not overdo it ! 
 Please wait a moment .. I am sorry right now there is no vacant seat . I have to ask . 
 By the way , hold your bag in case you vomit . 
 My immediate family is quite small . It's just my older step-brother , my mom , my step-dad and me . How about you ? 
 I didn't know you were a twin ! Are you identical or fraternal ? 
 Interesting . It must be great having a twin sister . Are you best friends , too ? 
 I don't know much about him . He died when I was just a baby . Even though I don't have a blood relationship with my step-father and step-brother , I consider them to be my real family . 
 No , she also died when my step-brother was little . My mother and my step-father met each other shortly after my father died and became good friends . They ended up getting married a few years later . 
 Can you direct me to some fresh produce that's on sale ? 
 Mangoes ? What are mangoes ? 
 Can you eat the seed ? 
 Well , how much are they ? 
 Can you describe their taste ? 
 How can I tell if they're ripe ? 
 Where do they grow mangoes ? 
 Slow down ! You can't exceed the speed limits . 
 No , you can not . It is dangerous . 
 No . You shouldn't drive like that . 
 I felt dizzy when I stare at those shining lights . What should we do firstly ? 
 Let me see the notice . It is here . Our booth number is E108 . Good number . 
 We can also consult some from these volunteers . 
 Should we put our samples on this table ? 
 What did you usually do as a head nurse ? 
 How to maintain a high standard of nursing ? 
 May I help you ? 
 Is that a one-way or round trip ? 
 When would you want to leave ? 
 I am sorry . The flight on Nov . 21st is full.Do you mind if I put your name on the waiting list ? 
 Have you heard about Jessica's party on Saturday ? 
 Really ? I got mine from her this morning . 
 You're probably right , do you intend on going to the party ? 
 I know , it does sound pretty awesome . 
 It's supposed to start at about eight . 
 I really don't know , but I don't think she gave out that many yet . 
 Excuse me , could you tell me how much is the lipstick ? 
 Oh , it's too expensive . Can't you make it any cheaper ? 
 But the price is too high . 
 What about 15 yuan ? 
 All right , I'll take it . 
 Thank you . 
 We may go abroad . I ’ m not sure . My wife wants to go to Egypt . I ’ d like to go there , too . We can ’ t make up our minds . 
 We may travel by sea . 
 It may be cheaper , but it takes a long time . 
 Don ’ t be so sure . We may not go anywhere . My wife always worries too much . Who ’ s going to look after the dog ? Who ’ s going to look after the house ? Who ’ s going to look after the garden ? We have t 
 That's right . 
 Yes , here you are . 
 OK . 
 I was responsible for sales . 
 Yes , I was twice singled out as an ' Advanced Worker ' . 
 Good morning ! Can I help you ? 
 OK , come this way , please . How does this one fit you ? 
 Let me stretch it for you . How is that now ? 
 OK . Here you are . 
 Thirty-five yuan . 
 Thanks . Nothing else , today ? 
 Dad , can you buy a new camera ? My old one has gone west . 
 So , you didn ’ t buy a good one for me . This time how about a better one ? 
 First , tell me about your education , please . 
 Can you name some terms of payment ? 
 We'd like to rent a flat near the university . 
 Yes , we are . Obviously , we'd like something as cheap as possible . We've heard that there are places for 80 to 100 pounds a month . 
 Not really , no . We'd preferably like to live in a quiet street . 
 We'll need two bedrooms . The kitchen and dining room can be separate or combined . 
 How far away is it from the campus ? 
 That sounds ideal . Can we go to have a look at it ? we'd like to see it before making a final decision . 
 Thank you . That would be great . 
 I partly agree with you . Buying stocks is not difficult , but making money consistently from buying stock is very difficult . Even professionals don ’ t find it easy , so be careful . Anyway , people like us need help with investing . Why not do some online research ? There are data , reports and discussion forums to educate people on how to invest . In addition , you need to visit an established website that offers stock charts . 
 I just watched the investment TV program last weekend . It has become a very hot topic these days . Actually I am not even a beginner . 
 Yes , I'm excited to hear about your new product . 
 Yes . I've heard a lot about it . 
 Yes , I would have to agree with you . It seems to offer more options than the others . But new product sometimes has a few troubles . How about yours ? 
 How do you ensure quality ? 
 Are your prices negotiable ? 
 What happens if I am not satisfied with my purchases ? 
 I see . But I have to discuss it over with my boss before I make a decision . 
 the bathroom looks lovely . Did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ? 
 so , let ’ s see . You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . You ’ Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . The bath , shower and waterbasin are the sam 
 how long did it take you to do the tiling . 
 I think you ’ Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ? 
 Excuse me , could you do me a favor ? 
 We are busy in preparing for the train.Would you please buy us some fruit ? 
 Apples and pears , one kilo for each af them , please . 
 I ’ m a bit worried about you going shopping by yourself this afternoon . 
 But what will you do if you need to know the price of something ? 
 Ok , but what will you do if you want to check the size of the clothes ? 
 And what will you do if you don ’ t have enough cash ? 
 Mr . Simpson , if you are free , how about a lunch ? 
 How about Thursday ? 
 I know of a place you'll like and you have got to be there . 
 OK , see you then . 
 What certificates of technical qualification have you got ? 
 Have you worked in a computer company before ? 
 Do you have any ideas on this work ? 
 Good ! 
 Honey , I am sorry that I am too busy most of the time . 
 What did you do last weekend ? 
 Did you play football with other children ? 
 Cool , we can take the football , shuttlecock and badminton racket to the park . 
 After that , we will have a picnic . 
 Okay , it sounds good . 
 My wife and I want to see the places of interest in Shenzhen , Guangzhou and Zhuhai . Can you arrange a tour for us ? 
 Well , three days . 
 That sounds good . How much is the tour ? 
 What does it include ? 
 Could we have you make all the necessary plane , hotel , and tour reservations ? 
 Where to , sir ? 
 Yes , of course . I live near the university . Hop in please . 
 Okay , we'll put it in the trunk . Ah , it is so heavy . 
 You're welcome . 
 I would like to open a Current Account , please . 
 That's great , here you are . This is my passport . 
 Really ? You are joking ? 
 I'd like that . Alright , put on this apron first . 
 Hmm , let me see . Boil some water , and then whisk two eggs . 
 Not bad . OK , now take some meat and potatoes from the fridge . 
 Three . And bring four bell peppers . 
 Now wash them , then dice the potatoes and bell peppers , then slice the meat . 
 It's in the cabinet . Adam , The gas cooker doesn't work . 
 Let me take a look at that . I can't stop the bleeding.We need to go to the hospital . 
 Next is a ballet performance , but who is the dancer ? 
 Since when did Eddy start doing ballet ? ! 
 Look ! He has a partner ! 
 Gross ! 
 But I think Eddy is going too far ! 
 Oh ! Ouch ! That must've hurt ! 
 Hi , how are you . Is Alice there ? 
 Why haven't you answered the phone ? 
 That's all right . 
 I want to do something tomorrow with you . 
 I was thinking about seeing a movie . 
 Until then . 
 I'm exhausted . 
 That's $ 60 in all . 
 Sure . You can go to the front desk to ask for more help . 
 What kind of car is best for me ? 
 The compact ? Why do you think that one is better than the others ? 
 That's true . What kind of safety features are we talking about ? 
 You mean it has a cheaper price than similar models ? 
 With the cost of gasoline these days , that is a big plus . I think this model may be just what I'm looking for . 
 I'd like to order dinner . 
 I'd like to order a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare . 
 I'd prefer the filet , but the porterhouse will do . 
 Normally , I would take you up on that suggestion , but just the champagne will do for tonight . 
 That's fine . 
 Good morning , sir.Can I help you ? 
 Thank you , Mr.Wang.Do you have an appointment ? 
 I'm afraid Mr.Li is engaged at the moment . Would you mind waiting ? 
 About half an hour . 
 Can the Assistant Manager meet you instead ? 
 Do you want to make another appointment ? 
 Yes , I'll make a note of that and ask Mr.Li to confirm . 
 Yes . I ’ m here to apply for the job of director that your company posted yesterday . Is it still available ? 
 Great . Where can I get an application form ? 
 Where is the Human Resource Office ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 I need it . Thank you . 
 Wow , your apartment is a mess . 
 Look ! Are those all your clothes on the couch ? 
 Are they clean ? 
 My sister and I usually go to the laundromat down the street . Why don't you go there ? 
 Yes I know . I have to do it every week . Anyway , are you ready to go ? 
 OK , but please hurry . I think the restaurant is closing soon . 
 Could you show me the coat on the shelf ? 
 May I try it on ? 
 It doesn't fit quite right . It feels a little tight in the waist . Do you have this in a larger size ? 
 Well , how do I look in this one ? 
 OK . I'll take it . 
 Not bad . I ’ m proficient in both written and spoken English . 
 I studied English in junior and senior high school . And in college , I took English conversation lessons . They were given by foreign tutors . 
 Band 6 . 
 I ’ m afraid I can ’ t , but I'd be glad to learn . 
 Yes , I think I can . I often talk to foreigners at English corner held twice a week at my college . They say my English is pretty good . 
 I have been attending an evening course in English writing for 2 years and I often read novels , magazines and newspapers in English . 
 Welcome . Can I help you with anything ? 
 Let's see . How about a nice shirt and tie ? You can't go wrong there . 
 We have some nice pants . You can also get him a belt with it .

 Yes . Right over here . 
 The pants are on sale for $ 40 , and the belt is $ 25 . 
 Just save the receipt and we will gladly return or exchange them for you . 
 Reservation , may I help you ? 
 For how many people ? 
 May I have your name ? 
 Your reservation is right . Please get a ticket booking form from there and fill it . 
 $ 800 . 
 Surely of course . Give me your card please . 
 I want a facial . But this is the first time I've come here , so can you tell me how you do it ? 
 That's exactly what I want . How long does it take ? 
 What's the regular price ? 
 Good , I will take the one hour facial with make-up . 
 By the way , could you give me a manicure ? Use a light nail-polish , please . 
 Hello , I'm looking for a shop that sells inexpensive cashmere sweaters . 
 Why didn't I think of that ? 
 Thanks . That is a good suggestion . 
 My latte looks like that shoe polish we did an ad for last month . 
 It still tastes fine , though . 
 Wait a second ! There's the idea for this case ! “ Your motor oil should be as choice and fresh as your morning coffee . ” 
 Ow ! Don ’ t shout so loud . Calm down . Please stop shouting and sit quietly down . 
 Where is it now ? 
 Now , move the couch around and turn it upside down . 
 Yes darling . You are quite right . 
 Hello , this is Smith from 1308 , can you add something to my room ? 
 2 towels and l Turkish towel , please ? 
 Thank you .

 Your dream will come true.It ' s really breathtaking . 
 Ruth ? Basil . 
 Want a ride to the office ? 
 Hold on . Just 5 minutes . 
 It's my pleasure . See you . 
 Hi , Ruth . Hop in . 
 Of course I don't mind . For your report ? 
 Good for you . No problem , I'll listen to the car radio 
 No , you're going the wrong way . You want a 103 from Beijing Zoo . 
 You get off at the next stop , cross the street , and you'll find the stop not far on the right hand side . 
 Here you are . 
 I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Monica to our company and introduce her to her department and colleagues . For all of you , we hired Monica because she is a very professional accountant and we are very happy to have her in the finance department . She has lots of working experiences as an accountant and I am sure everybody in the department can benefit from this . 
 Excuse me . I'm your new neighbor , Jack . I just moved in . 
 I'm looking for a grocery store . Are there any around here ? 
 OK . And is there a laundromat near here ? 
 Thank you . 
 A barber shop ? ! 
 You already ate . 
 There's nothing left from dinner . 
 What kind of snack are you going to make ? 
 You can always make a sandwich . 
 Just make yourself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich . 
 Go right ahead . 
 What ? I sent you three or four messages ! 
 Why didn't you just call ? I hate sending SMS messages . 
 I thought you had an unlimited SMS plan ? 
 No wonder you didn't get my texts ! 
 Let's eat the kind that has both spicy and mild broth in one pot . 
 Yep . That way I can satisfy my craving for spicy food and you can eat hot pot without burning into flames . 
 Two number 3s , please . 
 Diet Coke . 
 Regular , please . 
 No , thanks . 
 For here . 
 I agree . 
 I guess you're right.But like you said , you called me here to check me out . I've been doing the same . 
 Quite good , actually . I'm pretty sure you're demanding , but fair and honest . I feel we can work together . 
 Shoot ! 
 I don't see a problem . 
 Are there any hobbies you do ? 
 Oh , you actually do that ? 
 Did you always know how to draw and paint ? 
 You had an art class ? 
 Well , it's good that you're so talented . 
 Talent is a great thing , I wish I had one . 
 Ladies and gentlemen . It's about time to land in New York . Here are a couple of forms for you to fill out . 
 They are E / D cards . All passengers except American citizens must complete these forms . 
 It will save you much time when you clear customs . 
 Depending on what you consider a lot . 
 Couple times a week . How about you ? 
 How much can you drink ? 
 You're a light weight . 
 I'm usually drinking all night long . At least 10 drinks . 
 No . We usually go to places that have specials . Dante's over on the Ave has $ 5.00 pitchers on Mondays . So for ten , fifteen bucks , I can get a lot of drinks . 
 If you don't like beer , have you tried mixed drinks ? Some of them are pretty good . 
 You just have to build up a tolerance . I used to be like that . But your body gets used to it . 
 Hey let's go out tomorrow night . The Ram Bar and Grill is having a special on pitchers . 
 I really love this meal . 
 Where did you learn to cook these amazing dishes ? 
 The chicken is out of this world ! 
 I was wondering if there was shrimp in the soup . 
 It worked out well that the wine that I brought to share seems to blend well with this meal . 
 Does your chicken taste all right ? 
 My fish has good seasoning but is a little dry . 
 Yes , maybe they are short-handed in the kitchen tonight . 
 The vegetables seem to not be very fresh . 
 I usually enjoy the meals here , so I think that we should tell the waiter that there is something wrong with this meal . 
 I'm going to have to do some shopping today . 
 I want to find a new bedroom set . 
 I have no clue . 
 I don't know where to go to find a nice bedroom set . 
 Please do . 
 Are the bedroom sets at IKEA affordable ? 
 Welcome to the KFC Just-in-Time . Can I help you ? 
 Anything else , sir ? 
 What do you want for your drink ? 
 Your address , please . 
 Ok . got it.That ' ll be $ 6.50 . Thank you for your order.it will be there in 20 minutes . 
 What fruits are in season right now ? 
 Can I sample a grape ? 
 It tastes good . How much are the grapes per kilo ? 
 Hello , this is Sheila from Huawei Corp . Is that Li Lei ? 
 I am glad to tell you that you are supposed to come for an interview tomorrow . Are you free tomorrow ? 
 Well , I can't hear you . 
 Sorry , Mr . Smith agenda is full today . 
 I ’ m not sure , but I will arrange for you and inform you as well . 
 What color do you like ? 
 Maybe you could have a look at this one . 
 Large . 
 Are you looking for something special ? 
 Follow me , please . How do you like this one ? 
 Levis . It's the latest fashion . 
 This is room 1019 . I would like to order breakfast . 
 One orange juice , scrambled eggs with bacon , toast and coffee . 
 Yes , it is . Oh , by the way , could you also bring me today's paper ?

 OK , It's here , one of the best makes in China . 
 Excuse me , can I order now , please ? 
 I'd like the lasagna , please . 
 I'll try the vegetarian , please . 
 I can give you one for $ 30 a day or $ 200 a week . 
 May I see your driver's license ? 
 OK . You'll have to use a credit card or leave a $ 100 deposit . 
 That's fine . Don't forget to update the inventory . 
 When you take something out of the stores you need to update the stores database so we know when to reorder . 
 I'd be glad to . What is it ? 
 Not at all . Go ahead . 
 Not really , so long as you follow all the regulations . 
 No . Everyone has a chance to correct his or her mistakes . The most important thing is to be responsible for your work . 
 Yes.That ' s true . We are always busy . The company attaches great importance to high efficiency . Sometimes we have to work overtime , but not always . And we have extra pay for extra work . 
 Red restaurant . Do you want to make a reservation ? 
 At what time ? 
 No problem , sir . 
 Yes ! Thank goodness you ’ re here.These bugs are driving us crazy ! 
 We just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything . We have termites in the wood , cockroaches all over the place , and last night I saw a huge rat out in the backyard ! 
 No problem , just get rid of the bugs ! 
 It can ’ t be time to get up yet . 
 What ’ s the time ? 
 My watch says ten past . 
 Are you sure half past seven ? 
 It ’ s only seven o ’ clock . Your watch is fast . 
 I could have stayed in bed for another half hour . 
 Positive . 
 I'm absolutely sure I'm right . 
 This is right . There is no doubt in my mind . 
 Check and double check . 
 Hello , this is Catherine . I am calling about the appointment with Mr . Liu for this afternoon . Something has just come up . I am afraid the appointment will have to be rescheduled . I am very sorry about the change . 
 You are very kind to say so . Thank you . Do you think tomorrow morning would suit him ? 
 Tomorrow afternoon . Um ... When do you think I can come and see him tomorrow afternoon ? 
 Yes , that's quite all right for me . Can we change it ? 
 Thank you very much . See you tomorrow afternoon . 
 Dad , how can we get to the zoo ? 
 Does this bus go there ? 
 Let's step in , Dad . 
 Dad . Here comes another bus . 
 Why ? Dad ? 
 How do we do timesheets here ? 
 Yes , I already have one . 
 I am kind of confused . 
 I'm not quite sure . 
 No , I have no idea what you are talking about . 
 Thanks for your help . 
 I was really glad to hear about your award , congratulations ! 
 You ’ Ve been working there for so long with so much sacrifice . You definitely deserve it . 
 Do you like the cookies ? 
 Glad you like it . 
 Is Betty Sue in her office ? 
 I see . 
 Yes , please tell her I stopped by . 
 Ted . Oh , and could you give her this document for me ? 
 Excuse me , where am I on this map ? 
 Which bus should I take to railway station ? 
 Where am I supposed to change ? 
 Where can I find a spare hose for the pump ? 
 25 mm diameter . 
 Thanks . Have you got any light bulbs ? 
 Oh yes , some wire cutters . 
 Just one pair . 
 What would you want , coffee or tea ? 
 How do you like it ? 
 May I help you , sir ? 
 Please try these on . 
 I will bring you a larger size . 
 No , I'm not . 
 No , I'm not . I'm going to look for an apartment . 
 I'm going to try to find a place near the office . 
 Out in the suburbs.It ' s a long trip to work every day . 
 I'm going to buy a newspaper and check the classified ads . 
 I know , but I'm going to enroll in a night school to take a course in business management . 
 Yes , the swimming pool is right behind the building . Walk out of the door and you will see it . 
 $ 10 per hour . 
 Well , we've finally put the finishing touches on the training programs for next year . Here's a report showing the projected costs as well as the expected return on investment . 
 Sure ! It's not a real figure , of course . It's just an estimate based on rehiring costs , and the potential lost revenue that results from incompetence . 
 A little of both . We'll have a few daylong sessions for things like business writing skills and software training . Those are available to everyone . We also have a variety of other programs 
 A holiday , I hope ! No , really , we are looking into some courses on motivational techniques . We'll add them to the list when we choose a lecturer . 
 Actually , it is a 30 - day notice to vacate the premises . 
 This isn ’ t the first time you have been considerably late with the rent . I need to start the procedure to evict you . 
 This is a notice to inform you that the sheriff will evict you in 30 days if you do not pay up on your rent . 
 You can keep the apartment if you stay caught up on your rent . Otherwise , I need to find someone who can make the payments . 
 Thank you . I will need a cashier ’ s check or cash , please . 
 Oh , she ’ s just fine . She ’ s so grown up now . 
 Four and a half going on twelve ! 
 Have you a bus tour ? I have one day left so I think the best way is to take a bus tour . 
 What time does the next bus leave ? 
 Egg , this bathroom is a pigsty ! 
 I just can't stand it . It's really gross in here ! There ' s a stain on the toilet seat , and the floor was wet and slippery . So I cleaned it ! 
 I can't help myself ; it's just so disgusting in here ! 
 Hang on . I'm just gonna quickly wipe the sink and sweep the floor . 
 What do you want to do tonight ? 
 I have no idea . Do you think we're in a rut ? 
 Well , we do the same things every weekend . We go to the same restaurants . We see the same friends . You know what I mean ? 
 Okay , I'll look in the events section of the paper to see what's going on tonight . Hmm , we could go to a concert . There is a good one tonight . I bet it's not sold out . But , we'll have to drive an hour to the venue . 
 I'm not really in the mood for dancing , actually . You know what ? I just feel like staying home tonight and vegging , after all . How about you ? 
 Yeah , definitely , tomorrow night . 
 Yeah , yeah , we ’ re here because we feel this is an injustice ! The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop ! We ’ re there to show the government that we don ’ t like the way that they ’ re spending our tax dollars ! 
 It ’ s an absolute outrage , Sarah , the US government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers ’ money to the auto industry . These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt . 
 That maybe true , and I for one don ’ t want to see anyone lose their job , but how can these Ces ask for a bailout when they ’ re making millions of dollars ? And then , they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets ! This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars ! And they ’ re asking for money ! That is just not right ! 
 Mom , I want to move out . 
 Job ? 
 I thought I could just get you and Dad to pay for an apartment . I found a cheap one . 
 You ’ re right . If I ’ m going to live on my own , I have to be independent . 
 Would you please take a seat over there ? There are some interesting magazines on the coffee-table . 
 It shouldn't be long . Thirty minutes , tops . Are you in a hurry ? 
 Good idea . Do you want a wash or a massage ? Massage is especially good when you are tired . 
 Because it helps you speed up your circulation . 
 How do you like it ? 
 We have discount coupons . 100 Yuan for ten times . Would you like to have one ? 
 Of course . 
 Hello , May I help you ? 
 Oh , how nice ! There are bright rooms and the house is very quiet . 
 Well , each room is 40 dollars a week . 
 When do you want to move in ? 
 Fine , I'll be expecting you . 
 I need to get my prescription filled . 
 If I wanted to , could I have it mailed to me ? 
 Are there any special instructions about this medication ? 
 Can I take it with food ? 
 Are there any side effects with this medication ? 
 How much for a bus pass ? 
 Is there anything else that doesn't cost as much ? 
 How much does a student pass cost ? 
 It doesn't cost anything ? 
 Can you tell me how much that'll cost ? 
 Sounds good , let me get that . 
 Excuse me , how many sightseeing spots are there in the park ? 
 Do I have to buy extra ticket if I want to visit the main spots ? 
 Well , do you have through tickets ? 
 Are you going grocery shopping today ? 
 Yes , please get some white bread , thick cut , some ham , not the processed stuff , some gouda cheese , some galla apples and . . . 
 I was wondering if you'd let me stay here for a few days . 
 Until next weekend , if that's OK . 
 Of course . How about this one ? 
 It's a luminous watch with a time-reminder function . 
 Yes , and it comes with a worldwide guarantee . 
 Excuse me . Can I change my seat with you ? I want to sit beside my friend . 
 It's 9 - A in the middle part , a window seat too . 
 Yes , it is . Thank you very much . Let me help you to carry your baggage there . 
 Thanks . Have a nice trip . 
 Oh , I'm a tourist . May I go inside and look around ? 
 When can I go inside then ? 
 Good evening , madam . May I help you ? 
 Yes , would you like smoking or non-smoking ? 
 No problem . Follow me , please . 
 By all means . 
 You're welcome . 
 Why is that ? 
 Yes , the snow is fun . 
 How big was it ? 
 How long did it take ? 
 Did you give him a nose ? 
 Let me help you make one this year . 
 If you want my advice , you won ’ t invite yourself any risk . 
 Have you a full-day trip ? 
 Do I have to book the tour right now ? 
 Are the expressions of sight draft , time draft , usance draft and letter of credit adequate terms to express the different methods of payment ? 
 What if the sale is made on the basis of sight draft ? 
 Therefore , we must be very careful in building up clear expressions and complete understanding on both sides of trade . 
 How have you been feeling lately ? 
 Has your blood pressure been high before ? 
 Usually people with high blood pressure have no symptoms , so we call it the silent killer . 
 I am going to put a cuff on you to get a reading . 
 I get an idea of the pressure in your arteries when your heart is pumping blood versus at rest . 
 Miss , may I help you ? 
 It's because of the view . 
 Sure . Please take a look at the model of the building . Nice Garden has a total of two blocks which are labeled Block I and Block II . Block I has a total of thirty-eighth floors . The thirty-seventh and thirty-eighth are penthouses . There are four units in one floor . The sizes of the units are one thousand square feet and one thousand and five hundred square feet . The size with one thousand square feet has three bedrooms and the biggest size has four bedrooms .

 It's this high-tech equipment that doctors my voice a little . Actually , i am tone-deaf . 
 Well , the echo and the stereo system helped a lot . And i know that song very well , so , i didn't need to pay attention to the subtitles which helped as well . 
 Pick the one that you always sing in the shower .

 Yes , and I check all the e-mails for Mr . Thomas . 
 It ’ s easy , grandpa . Insert you card into the machine here . Then wait a moment . OK . Now you enter your PIN . It should have four numbers . 
 You really shouldn ’ t write it down . You should memorise it . You can change it to a more convenient number if you like . 
 Yes . Choose the service you need to use . If you choose to withdraw money , the machine will ask you how much you want . 
 That ’ s right . Give the machine a moment to process you request . Then take your money . 
 How have you been doing ? 
 How long have you had this toothache ?

 When you brush your teeth , what do you use ? 
 Does it bother you when you have to chew a lot ? 
 Hello , may I speak to Kevin , please ? 
 The doctor sent me over here to have my blood drawn . 
 What is this test for ? 
 What does that tell him ? 
 Will the blood test hurt ? 
 Ouch !

 This is room eleven-seven and my name is Terry Chen . 
 My friend's room ? Oh , I see . Thanks a lot . 
 Oops ! 
 I overcooked the corn . 
 Hello , Matt ! 
 Matt , I'm going to ask you some questions about pet.First question , do you have a pet ? 
 Wow , like how do they train the dogs ? 
 Well , how many dogs do they train at a time ? 
 Do you ever see the dogs you trained , like out on the street , or anything ? 
 Oh , wow , that's cool . Um , why do people keep pets ? 
 Yeah , that's true . OK , besides cats , dogs , and fish , what are some other pets people keep ? 
 I can't find my glasses and I can't see anything . Can you help me find a few things ? 
 My laptop , do you see it ? 
 Where's my book ? 
 The dictionary . 
 Where's my pencil ? 
 That's not a pencil . That's a pen . 
 How about my backpack ? Do you know where that is ? 
 Where are my shoes ? 
 I don't see them . 
 Thanks . 
 Oh ! Is it too hot ? I'm sorry . 
 OK ! Here you go . 
 I don't know how to adjust my life . Would you give me a piece of advice ? 
 Yes , I can't sleep well every night . 
 I drink a lot of wine . 
 I often feel so tired . 
 I sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me . 
 What time does the train for Boston leave ? 
 When does it arrive ? 
 How much is a one-way ticket ? 
 Are you going to come home late tonight ? 
 Excuse me , is this personnel division ? 
 I came about your advertisement for a senior production planner . 
 My name is Li Jean . 
 Yes , seven years . 
 Master of Marketing Management . 
 Yes . I worked at AB Company . 
 Because you need a senior production planner who is good at mathematics and fluent in English . I think I am fit for the position . 
 That's very good . 
 Get in , please . Where to , madam ? 
 I can't promise anything , but I'll try my best . 
 That'll be 10 dollars , please . 
 What arrangement will you make about payment ? 
 At sight of course . 
 I am afraid that can't be done . We have never done business on such terms . 
 We ask for full payment at sight , because we guarantee 90 % mechanical efficiency for all our products . You don't have the same guarantee from other suppliers . The usual percentage is around 85 . 
 Yes . We usually send technicians abroad to offer after-sales service to our customers . 
 Thank you . I am glad we have come to an agreement at last . 
 Sure , Emily . We haven't done that in a while . 
 Well , keep this under your hat , but I think I'm going to quit after New Year . 
 I know I should be pretty happy here , but I'm not finding the kind of job satisfaction I need . I'm a good graphic designer ... 
 That's kind of you to say . But ... the stuff we do here hasn't really challenged me very much at all . 
 That's one way of putting it . For me , a job needs to stimulate my brain , otherwise it becomes a daily drudgery . 
 Where would you like to go ? 
 Get in and close the door . 
 Sorry . The road is too crowded . 
 But I can't help it . 
 Sorry . We mustn't stop here . 
 Yes , I'm leaving on the 14th of next month . 
 Actually , it is a policy in my company . The human resources management department has connections overseas this year , so we can receive training there . 
 No . The company pays for everything . Doesn't this sound very attractive ? This is why our company can always get the best employees ! 
 Oh , don't be so sad . You can ask for a salary raise . 
 So you suppose you deserve a salary raise . 
 You ought to point out how valuable you are , and tell her those people who have the same situation also get the salary raise . 
 Remember it is the boss who hires you and tell her how much you have improved the office efficiency . 
 Forget it . Good luck . I hope you can make it . 
 Indeed . I've decided to go for the Petty Consumer Loan . That is , if my credit rating is satisfactory . 
 I've just bought a second hand apartment and I'm looking to do some renovations . You know , a bit of decorating , some new furniture , nothing flashy . 
 It says here that the maximum is 20,000 RIB . Is that flexible ? 
 Well , 20,000 RIB , it'll have to be then . 
 Everything is right here . If that's all in order , just let me know where I sign . 
 I have many hobbies , I like almost all kinds of sports and I also like to listen to pop songs . 
 I think I am extroverted . 
 Yes . We're satisfied with the result . 
 Good afternoon , Mr Meng . It's a little late for you , isn't it ? 
 What can I help you with ? 
 Mmmm ... yes , many investors don't seem to be into stocks at the moment . Too risky ! How about Open-Ended funds ? 
 Exactly . Then each individual has the chance to diversify their portfolio over many different areas , it doesn't have to be stocks . And , we provide a Professional Fund Manager , so you know your investment will be safe with us . 
 Our Investment Financing Service will help you choose where to put your funds and look at both the pros and cons of each . 
 Looking through your C . V . , I see that you graduated from Oklahoma State University . Can you tell me what training you have had that would specifically relate to the cable television Industry ? 
 I see . Did you have anything specific in mind ? 
 That ’ s impressive . How would you make that pay ? 
 I see you have several good ideas . Now , I just have a few questions about your C . V . I notice that there is a five-year gap between your last job and now . 
 So , you ’ re just starting back . Maybe you ’ d better tell me a little more about your experience . 
 A lorry overturned on the road and blocked it , so all the traffic was held up . 
 Yeah , traffic was brought to a standstill by the accident . If we had gone early we would miss the traffic . 
 Don ’ t worry . The traffic jam is said to be over soon . 
 It ’ s my pleasure . 
 Ms Willows , hello . This is Daniel calling from IBA Bank . 
 I'm calling to notify you that an Export L / C has arrived for you . 
 Yes , it's from Satura Beds of Tokyo . 
 Hello ! How can I help you , sir ?

 It's 7.2 % , fixed-rate loan . 
 Just fill out this application . We can let you know right away if you qualify . 
 Honey , can you set the table ? 
 Well , make sure to put out the pepper and salt shakers . I don ’ t know if your brother is coming tonight so set an extra place mat just in case . 
 Yeah , go ahead , forks , spoons and knives . I roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well . 
 Honey ? Have you seen our soup bowls ? 
 Would you like to see our new shirts ? 
 But they ’ re very nice , you know . 
 And not expensive either . 
 Everybody is buying them . 
 Yes , they ’ re very fashionable , you see . 
 I see . 
 Sorry , I couldn ’ t help you . 
 Hello . I'm trying to track down some documents due to arrive any day on our new L / C . 
 It's TH 15699324873 0 . 
 Would it be possible to transfer them to IBA Bank ? 
 Hello , may I help you ? 
 Oh , how nice.They ' re bright rooms and the house is very quiet . 
 Well , gentleman.Each room is $ 40 a week if you think that's OK . 
 When do you want to move in ? 
 Fine . I'll be expecting you around two . 
 She's the one who saved the life of my son at the beach last year . 
 Dinner's ready ! Come and get it ! 
 Thank you for calling the Twin Theatre . 
 The next show is at two o'clock . 
 Besides , yours don't have side pockets like mine . 
 Just the necessities 
 No , but you never know when you'll need a flashlight . 
 Have you a wine list ? 
 Oh . I see . Don't you have Mao Tai ? 
 Well , that's fine . Bring us a bottle of that . 
 I'd like to book a room , please . 
 Four nights , from October 15th . 
 A single room with a bath , if possible . 
 I'll take a front one.My name is John Brown . J-O-H-N B-R-O-W-N . 
 Absolutely we need a house here . But what makes me upset is the prices in this city . 
 It is depressing to hear the price goes higher and higher . 
 And the rich still wants to buy more , even though they have at least one house to live . 
 Yes , it displays some social problems and interprets the values of our white-collars . 
 Good afternoon . 
 Yes , we have a reservation for three nights.Mona White . I called last week . 
 Yes , that was for two single rooms , wasn't it ? 
 Are they quiet rooms ? 
 but there's a lovely view . 
 Of course 
 Nothing , how about you ? 
 Oh , really ? 
 Probably not . 
 I don't feel like going . 
 I really can't stand going to parties . 
 Sorry about that . 
 Yes , can you tell me where I can find a travel agency ? 
 Thank you . 
 I'll give it a try . 
 Yes . But I don't know the exact time . 
 Oh , I see . I will tell my wife . Thank you for telling me so much . 
 Yes , of course . I am going to have my appendix removed . 
 Yes . Here it is . 
 Where do you think you lost it ? Outside the hotel ? 
 I am afraid , Ma'am , you have to pay 100 US dollars since you lost the key . 
 I am afraid no . It is not covered by this insurance . 
 We think the price is too high . 
 We'll have to discuss it with my boss . 
 Where are you going , Jane ? 
 I saw her yesterday . She was a little better . 
 No , you needn't . A number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital . 
 Yes . I caught a number 7 bus yesterday , and they said I had taken a wrong bus . 
 But number 13 buses leave from the center of town . You'll have to walk two miles to catch one . 
 Oh , really ? Where ’ d you find it ? 
 In the ads ? Are you serious ? 
 I ’ d like to hear about this apartment . 
 What is the rent each month ? 
 That ’ s amazing . The rent is very cheap . 
 It ’ s a good thing that you read that ad today . 
 OK , sir . Please wait a moment , we will check your room . 
 Sure . how would you like to pay ? 
 Excuse me . 
 I'm in a hurry . How long will it take ? 
 Do you think the traffic will be heavy ? 
 That's a relief . 
 I've been feeling pretty ill for a few days now . 
 I feel chilly , I've got cramps , I keep throwing up , and I feel dizzy and tired . 
 Yes . I can't seem to drink enough . 
 No , just soda . 
 That seems to be a bit low , but that's not uncommon when you're ill . 
 No , but my girlfriend has mono . 
 Thanks . 
 My temperature is 39 degrees centigrade . 
 I didn't take my temperature but I felt feverish . 
 Doctor , I can't eat any foods because I had a sore throat . 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 When did you lose it ? 
 Can you make a description of your wallet ? 
 What is the proper way to sit at a dinner table ? 
 Yes . 
 Are you ready to order ? 
 Would you like fries with that ? 
 And to drink ? 
 Is this dine-in or take-out ? 
 Are you paying in cash or by credit card ? 
 Here's your key , sir . Room number 1405.The bellboy will take your luggage to your room . Have a pleasant stay ! 
 What can I do ? 
 Did you go to any illegal website ? 
 Yes , your computer can be easily infected by virus if you do that . 
 That's wise . 
 One minute . Oh , yes , it was infected by a virus , and you had no antivirus software . 
 Of course . You'd better learn something about it . 
 Don't worry , it should have been protected automatically . And I take an anti-virus software with me . Do you want me to install it now ? 
 What ’ s the postage on this letter to hongkong , please ? 
 Yes , Five one dollar stamps , please . 
 Excuse me , could you tell me which line I ’ m supposed to stand in to buy bubble wrap and to post a package ? 
 That ’ s a really long line . How long do you think it ’ ll take to get through all those people ? 
 Can I buy stamps here ? 
 I need 30 for my Christmas cards . 
 Twenty of them are going abroad to China and America . 
 No . 
 And the bubble wrap ? 
 Thanks a lot . You ’ Ve been very helpful . 
 Yes , I ’ Ve come to inquire about a 6,000- dollar remittance from California . Has it arrived ? 
 My name is Jenny Clinton . 
 Really ? It should have arrived . It was sent a week ago . 
 Well , then I'll come again the day after tomorrow . 
 That would be very kind of you . 
 The phone number is 328 6765 extension 105 . 
 Hi . Are you new in this class ? 
 Did you just arrive in this country ? You look a little nervous . 
 I took this course last semester too . Now I am taking it again ! 
 Wow , you have a lot of questions ! I learned a lot . In fact , that ’ s why I am taking it again . I get lots of practice in speaking , and also in writing . I ’ m sure you ’ ll be glad you took this course . I ’ ll even help you study if you ’ d like . 
 Welcome to our company Mr white . My name is Yan Hua , the secretary of Mr Wang . 
 Would you like to have a cup of tea or coffee ? 
 Glad you like it . By the way , is this your first time to China , Mr . White ? 
 We also hope to expand our business with you . 
 I think you probably know China has adopted a flexible policy in her foreign trade . 
 Right . Seeing is believing . 
 I have to talk to you ! 
 I know , Blake . But you ’ Ve been avoiding me all morning , and we have got to talk about this deal with the Mc Kinsey Food Company . 
 Do you have any direct flights to Toronto ? 
 When does the flight depart ? 
 How long is the layover ? 
 And how long do I have to stay in Berlin for the connecting flight ? 
 So the time for the total journey is about ... ? 
 Let me count . Ok , it works out for my schedule . Thanks a lot ! 
 I'm checking out now . Can I have my bill , please ? 
 It's 876 . Here is my key card .

 Thanks . 
 No , I haven't . 
 Ok . Excuse me , what's this charge for ? 
 Oh , yes . It's on Wednesday morning . Sorry about that . 
 Here you are . 
 Put all baggage on the conveyor belt.Walk through the detector gate one at a time , please . 
 What for ? 
 Really ? I'm in a hurry.All right . 
 I'm embarrassed ! I forgot completely about them . I'm terribly sorry . 
 Thank you . 
 Sure . Just a minute . Let me take my camera out . 
 I'm not sure . 
 I hope not ! Oh , I see . 
 The batteries are worn down . I need replace them . 
 All photography shops carry them . 
 May I take your order ? 
 Anything else ? 
 No problem , sir . 
 Thanks very much . 
 I know , but there was nobody else . 
 I ’ m looking for a bookcase , but I don ’ t want to buy a new one . 
 Not really . There aren ’ t any used bookcases listed . But there are a few rummage sales on Saturday . I think I ’ ll go to them . 
 Not at all . These private sales are great places to bargain . And sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk . 
 What happened ? 
 Yes , sir . Where would you like to go ? 
 Is it the one on Xi Shut Street ? 
 Well , how does it look ? 
 Let me pay for it now . 
 I think I'll use my credit card . 
 Here's my John Hancock . 
 Hello , I need a wake-up call tomorrow morning . 
 Actually , I need two calls , one at 7 and the other at 7 fifteen . 
 Do you know what , let's change the second call to 7 thirty . 
 Not at the moment , thank you . 
 You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord . 
 A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform , I was extremely nervous . When I looked down , I was nervous even more.If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to bake meat . However , I knew my worries were unwanted . I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was 30 seconds . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or eight seconds . When rebounding to the high altitude , I felt a sudden sense of relief . I did not feel nervous very much , but very comfortable . 
 Hello , is that John ? 
 I am calling to tell you some issues about the interview . 
 Yes . I think it is now a moderate volume . 
 We want to look at some of your products . 
 Could you commend me some moisturizers ? 
 Yes , that's right . 
 Oh , very good . I will buy this one . 
 No . Thank you . 
 Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long to get ready the morning ? 
 Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . Half an hour , tops . 
 True , I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on , even when you show up to class in sweatpants . Tell me , how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ? 
 I have redecorated my bedroom . I decide to repaint the walls and change the pictures . I also bought a new pair of curtains . What do you think of it ? 
 I bought a new mattress and some fresh bedclothes . I also bought a new dressing table and a new bedside table . 
 do you think that I should get a new wardrobe ? 
 yes . I have so many clothes stuffed into it . Perhaps I should get rid of some of them . There are clothes in there that I never wear anymore . 
 that ’ s a good idea . After I get rid of the old clothes I no longer wear , I can see what new clothes I need to buy . 
 ok . I ’ ll let you know when I ’ Ve sorted out my clothes . 
 Yet in writing , George has nothing on Frank . 
 My pal , you are so nervous recently . You don't need to be like that . 
 Just use your head . If you were definitely making some big mistakes , you would be informed . 
 That is merely a dream . Remember , there is always room for us to have further improvement . I think we did the good job in the whole period . 
 Hello , Could I speak to Mary , please ? This is Mrs . Fort here . 
 Ah , Mary , good evening . Look , I was wondering if you like to come to a party we are having on Friday ? There are many coming from the office . 
 I have the chills and an upset stomach . 
 For most of the week . 
 What do you think I should do ? 
 Good Morning.What can I do for you ? 
 Do you have a registration card ? 
 Then you need to register as a new patient.Can I have a look at you ID card ? I need your name , age , occupation , address and contacting number . 
 Thanks . Which kind of medicine do you prefer , western medicine or traditional Chinese medicine ? 
 All right . Yes , he does . The registration fee is 7 yuan , please . 
 No . The things are too expensive there for me . I can't afford it . 
 Really ? That's wonderful . Can you wait a second ? I need to change . 
 I will . Do you think we can get something really nice and cheap ? I mean this is the last day . 
 Should we ask Cindy to come along ? She saw the evening gown made of silk last month that she wanted to buy very much . She didn't buy it of course . It would cost her three months ’ salary . 
 When ? 
 Oh ? Isn't that like her . 
 All right , all right . I am ready to go . Let's go ! 
 Let me see ... Wednesday morning . Yes , I am booked solid all morning . What ’ s up ? 
 I can explain them to you . It ’ ll just take about a half an hour . How about Friday afternoon ? 
 OK . Shall we say next week , on Tuesday at 2:30 ? 
 Next time you buy veggies or fruits , have them bagged and weighed before you come here . 
 The total comes to US $ 65.81 . How will you pay today ? 
 Slide your card through the card ID pad and punch in your PIN . 
 One moment . Do you want to withdraw some cash while you're at it ? 
 Paper or plastic ? 
 Do you want paper or plastic bags for your groceries ? 
 May , do you mind helping me prepare for the picnic ? 
 Yes . It says it will be sunny all day . No sign of rain at all.This is your father's favorite sausage . Sandwiches for you and Daniel . 
 Okay . Please take some fruit salad and crackers for me . 
 All set . May , can you help me take all these things to the living room ? 
 Ask Daniel to give you a hand ? 
 Good morning , sir . Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 How about this one ? It's the special local product . 
 Yes . This is a duty-free shop . 
 Hi , Navy . Come in please . I'm just putting away on my books . 
 yes , I'm going to take a holiday tomorrow . 
 That's all right . I'm almost finished . Do you need my help ? 
 All right I'll read it soon . 
 Oh . It's nothing Navy . 
 Yes . I worked in a small machinery factory . My work was very simple and there was not much work to do . 
 No , I thought it was too dull . I'm capable of more responsibilities , so I decided to change my job . 
 Yesterday I saw your company's advertisement . Your company is an important international company . Working for it , I believe it can improve my abilities . 
 Oh , the company is the fourth largest machine producer in the world . It was founded in the United States in 1980 . I know that the company has made good use of advanced technology . 
 I am going fishing in Alaska with my friend , Mark . 
 What's wrong with heading out with Mark for vacation ? 
 Really ? Who made that rule up ? 
 That works for me ! 
 We eat a lot of chicken , pork and beef.You eat those meat a lot in your country too , don ’ t you ? 
 Yes . I ’ Ve heard that people in your country like to eat lamb chops . 
 Yes , I have . I tried them when I visited your country last year . I thought they were very tasty.Can you cook them ? 
 That sounds great . I ’ ll boring a bottle of wine . 
 No , I haven't , but I've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper . 
 Either something in the hotel business or something to do with travel . 
 I know . But I'd like to try . Look , here are some advertisements that I've cut out . 
 Great . The view from this window is wonderful . 
 It looks new . 
 I like it . 
 Wow , it ’ s nice . What did you say about the rent ? 
 Does that include utilities ? 
 When will it be available ? 
 I like it a lot but I need to talk with my wife . Can you hold it for me for two days ? 
 Thank you very much . I will let you know as soon as possible . 
 Oh , wonderful ! You speak English ! I need to exchange this foreign currency . 
 It's Traveller's Cheques , is that possible ? 
 Yes , right , certainly . Here you go . 
 OK . How about this diamond necklace ? 
 Then . I'm sure you will like this one . 
 Sure . This is the warranty . The cut , color , clarity , weight and the manufacturer of the diamond are all indicated in this document . 
 Yes , thank you . I want to get a handbag . 
 No , I have no girlfriend . 
 I am afraid it is too big . 
 Too bad . But , is there any other leather store nearby ? 
 I hope so . Thanks . 
 Yep . And relive those good old high school days . 
 I'm not . I get a stomachache just thinking about it . 
 Ouch , that hurts — did you have to mention her name ? 
 It's nothing . It's not the first time anyway . 
 I hope so .

 That's OK , Mr . Li , a double room with bath from the fifth of August to the eighth .

 No , I don't . 
 Can I sit down now ? 
 I want to make dinner tonight . 
 I don't have any idea what to cook . 
 Can you tell me how to make it ? 
 Okay , but what do I have to do to prepare it ? 
 What do I do after that ? 
 What else do I have to do ? 
 Hello , Mr Trent . What can I do for you this afternoon ? 
 Oh , I see . When are you leaving ? 
 Yes , of course . Well , let's get started . Would you show me your passport , please ? 
 Can I help you ? 
 To buy or to rent ? 
 How much do you want to pay ? 
 Well , I've got one here . It's 260 a month . 
 It's got a kitchen , a bathroom , and one bedroom . 
 Yes , I think so . There is also an interesting one . It's opposite the park . 
 It's 325 a month . It's the biggest we've got in this area . 
 Well , There're two bedrooms , a sitting room , a kitchen and a bathroom . 
 Of course , Sir . 
 I'm easy to approach and friendly to everyone . 
 I'm quite outgoing , I think . 
 I don't agree with someone else's opinion if I think he's wrong , but when I understand his thinking and see he has some good ideas , then I'm very happy to go along with him . 
 Wow ! It's a fruit sculpture ! Your chef is a real artist ! 
 You did ? Wow ! Where did you learn ... ? 
 Can I help you find something ? 
 Is there one in particular that you like ? 
 Ah yes , that is a great refrigerator . 
 It's both affordable and it comes with all the appliances . 
 It comes with an ice maker , water dispenser , and there is a lot of room inside . 
 Be my guest . 
 Excuse me , does this bus go to the new bookstore ? 
 Thank you . How much is the fare to that stop ? 
 How many stops are there ? 
 Could you please tell me when we get there ? 
 By the way , do I need a transfer again after No . 50 ? 
 There is a problem in my apartment . 
 A pipe broke in my wall , and water is leaking . 
 Yes , it ’ s creating mildew on the walls . 
 I can call a plumber to fix it right now . 
 Well , you can ’ t do it until tomorrow , and I need it fixed now . 
 You ’ re okay with me calling someone ? 
 What are you doing , Victor ? 
 What for ? 
 Party ? What party ? 
 Oh , I forget . Who ’ s invited ? 
 Can I help you get ready ? 
 Ok , just leave it to me . I ’ ll take care of it . 
 What did you do at the office today ? 
 What kind of things did you need to check ? 
 I see . Did anything else happen ? 
 It must be difficult to remember the details for each individual client . 
 I hate dealing with complaints . Was it a legitimate complaint ? 
 You certainly had a busy day . 
 Good morning , sir . Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Sure . How do you like your suit ? 
 May I help you ? 
 What dose she look like ? 
 What was she wearing ? 
 When did you last see her ? 
 How long has it been ? 
 This is my first trip to Hong Kong , and I'd like to see some of the city's sights . 
 Only three days on business so I won't have a long time . 
 Do you have some information on these ? 
 Good afternoon , sir . May I help you ? 
 Do you want to mail it by air or by sea ? 
 How are you doing today ? 
 What can I do for you ? 
 How much would you like to take out ? 
 Which account would you like to take the money from ? 
 Okay , here you go . 
 Can I do anything else for you ? 
 I can ’ t believe the cost of apartments in New York City . 
 Of course I had heard about that , but now I know how expensive it is to rent a place here . 
 Why ? You pay so much for such a tiny space to live . 
 Would you like me to type it for you ? 
 Not at all . I ’ ll be glad to do it . 
 Shall I right out again first ? 
 Can I print it ? 
 Is this the right bus for San Francisco ? 
 When's the first stop ? 
 Thank you . 
 Sure , but only in the rear , and only cigarettes . And alcohol is not allowed . 
 What is the best way to find a job here ? 
 I don't know . 
 It doesn't matter right now , either one would be OK . 
 OK , I'll go check it out . 
 I am not sure . 
 Are you a visitor here ? 
 Have you been used to your new life ? 
 Did you see the news today ? 
 You know about the blackout last night , right ? 
 A bunch of people went looting last night . 
 They took full advantage of the lights being out . 
 The news reported that four stores were broken into . 
 The police don't know who did it . 
 Who is on duty ? 
 Your duty is to keep a check on those prisoners from now on . 
 Let's cross here . 
 Now we have to walk all the way down to the end of the street . 
 Sir , may I please see your license and registration ? Do you know how fast you were going ? 
 You're not sure ? You were going at 90 miles per hour ! That's 25 mph over the legal speed limit ! Have you been drinking ? 
 Then how can you explain your behavior ? 
 Not paying attention to the speedometer ? Why not ? 
 On a cell phone ? 
 That's definitely true . I'm going to have to give you a ticket . Please remember to drive more carefully next time . 
 Does everybody need to be there ? Hilary and Jason are on vacation this week . 
 Let me take a look at the schedule . I ’ ll get back to you this afternoon , all right ? 
 Yes , I'm checking out . 
 Room 1419 . Here's my key . 
 It's all right . Please charge it to my credit card . 
 I will . Where can I leave my luggage ? I really want to leave after lunch . 
 Thanks very much . And good-bye . 
 Alright , sir . You are making a good choice.Honda has made a lot of design improvements in the new Accord . 
 On all our new cars , the standards includeair conditioning , anti-lock brakes , air bags , and an AM / FM stereo with a CD player.But on the Accord , there is another standard item as well.The Accord com 
 Why not , sir ? 
 Well , sir , I know some of our customers are concerned about cruise control.But Honda has never had a single cruise control malfunction that led to an accident . 
 You know , sir , you don't have to use it.You can turn it on or off . If you don't want to use it , you just never turn it on . 
 No , the sunroof is optional , sir . 
 Well , I can say that the new models will be here in August.If you order one now , we will have it for you in August . 
 We have this new model in red , white , black , or silver.These are the standard colors.Of course you could specially order from various other colors too . 
 I know the color you mean . Is this it , sir ? 
 Yes , you can.That color is very popular with Honda buyers . So we've kept it available . 
 You have made a good choice , sir . I drive an Accord myself . They are very solidly built machines , very reliable . 
 Alright , sir . I will get the paperwork ready for you . Just a moment . 
 I'd like a cup of mocha . 
 Medium , please . 
 Yeah . give me a chocolate bar also . 
 Please have them wrapped . I'll take them away . 
 Here's eight dollars . Keep the change . 
 Could I help you on your new project ? 
 I want to help with both . 
 Most of the time that is what I prefer . 
 I am not sure yet . 
 I will do that . 
 To start with , may I know why you are interested in working for our company ? 
 Now you are with Quandong Company . What is your chief responsibility there ? 
 Do you have any questions about the job ? 
 Certainly . This is an international company , and ther're good chances for you to work overseas . 
 Ouch ! I just bit my tongue . 
 I think it's bleeding . 
 Well , sir . If you want to check out now , we will charge you $ 200 as well . 
 Well , the check out time is 12:00 o'clock everyday , if you checked out after 15:00 , we have to charge you for another day . 
 Sure , you want a continental one or an American one ? 
 OK , sir , yours will be ready in a few seconds . 
 A cup of coffee and an apple pie . How about you ? 
 Why don't you drink coffee ? 
 It does taste weird . 
 What's the problem , sir ? 
 Do you keep the receipt ? 
 What do you want me to do about it ? 
 Alison , would you like to have some more ? 
 Actually you haven't had much . 
 That sounds ridiculous . Why ? 
 Do you have any tables ? 
 It's a nice color , and the style is not bad , but a bit too small . I'd like to get a slightly larger one . 
 Mmm , I like it . How much is it ? 
 Here is the money . Could you deliver this to my house ? 
 Here is my name card . Thanks . 
 Well , what did you think about the last candidate ? Do you think we should hire her ? 
 What made you think that she wasn't very confident ? 
 She was a bit nervous , I guess . What else ? 
 you're right . If she walked into meetings with our clients like that , it would make our company look bad , wouldn't it ? 
 I agree . I guess I was paying more attention to her answers than her body language . 
 That's true . I guess we'll have to keep looking for a manager then . 
 Fill it up with regular , please . 
 No , thanks . I'm in a hurry . How much is it ? 
 My throat is really dry . 
 Yes , I'm parched . 
 I was thinking about getting a soda . 
 Why not ? 
 I don't know what else to drink . 
 I would like some water . 
 I have a feeling you will get this job . 
 Just remember to be professional and polite . Oh , and don ’ t forget to smile . 
 Have you updated your resume recently ? 
 You ’ d better double-and-triple check it . You don ’ t want to have any embarrassing typos on your resume . Otherwise , you might shoot yourself in the foot . 
 Definitely . Oh , do you have a reference letter ? 
 I ’ m included on your list of references , right ? My praise of you could really make a difference . 
 Lindsay Tipping gave me your name as a reference . We are considering hiring her as an editor for our magazine . 
 How long was she employed with your company ? 
 Freelance , hmm . How do you think she will manage in an office environment ? 
 Hello . Do you have anything for a little girl ? 
 That's a great idea . Show me the Barbie dolls . 
 How lovely ! How much is she ? 
 No problem . Let me have one . 
 No , thank you . That's all I need at the moment . 
 I'll give you cash . 
 I'd like to have internet on my computer . 
 What are my options ? 
 Which one would you recommend ? 
 Why is DEL better ? 
 What exactly does that mean ? 
 That means that I can't use my phone and the internet at the same time , right ? 
 So , now I need your help again , if you don't mind . I'm taking a date to a restaurant . 
 She strikes me as being very sophisticated . Only the best will do for her . 
 I don't want to be cooped up in my own hotel tonight . How about another restaurant ? 
 Yes , that sounds like a winner . Would you please call them to reserve a table ? 
 Would you like a lift home ? 
 Can I get you any dessert ? 
 Excellent choice . ( He brings her the pie . After she finishes , the waiter comes back . ) Would you like anything else ? 
 Here you are . Thank you and have a nice evening . 
 Do you like Barry ? 
 I agree . I like his brother Paul . They are not alike . 
 What kind of person do you consider yourself to be ? 
 Oh , I don't think you're shy ! You are always chatting with new people when we go to a party . 
 You're right . I love going out and making new friends . 
 Of course ! 
 I fed them earlier today . 
 Okay , I'll do that later . 
 I know . What time is their appointment ? 
 I got it . I will remember . 
 Yes . What can I do for you ? 
 That's cool . What documents do I need to carry ? 
 I came here to get a chest X-ray . 
 What comes next ? 
 Should I do anything else ? 
 Is this OK ? 
 How come you are walking away ? 
 Will I be finished then ? 
 I'd like to check out . 
 No . I'd like to do that now . 
 Do you have a free moment ? 
 I am having some trouble . How do you use this printer ? 
 Silly me . 
 Oh , and it's out of paper . Do you have any more ? 
 I would like to buy one round trip plane ticket to Hong Kong , please . 
 Leaving on September 5th and returning to New York City on October 9th . 
 I prefer to sit next to a window . 
 I have a Master Card . 
 Body language in the interview is closely related to the job-hunter's image . 
 You should look the interviewer in the eye so as to show that you are carefully listening to him . 
 When you are seated , bent forward a little with your hands crossed , to show you respect the interviewer . 
 Proper posture can show your confidence . 
 Pay attention to keeping eye contact as well . 
 In a word , you should keep decent manners in the interview . 
 Hello , Elizabeth . How are you ? 
 Are you sure you're all right ? You look a bit worried today . Is anything wrong ? 
 Of course , if I can . 
 Oh dear ! That's terrible ! What was in your wallet ? 
 Well , if were you , I'd go to the police station straight away and report it . 
 Oh dear ! What a pity ! Are you sure you lost the wallet in the theatre ? 
 I think you should put an advertisement in the China Daily , saying when and where you lost it . 
 Wait a minute ! My uncle lives in Beijing and he lives very close to the theatre . I'll telephone him and ask him to go there to inquire about it . You'd better have breakfast now and I'll meet you later . 
 Alex . It ’ s Nancy over in Marketing . I ’ Ve got some good news for you . 
 Mr . Morris was so pleased with your sales work on his account that he went straight to the top with it . He wrote a letter about it to Mr . Macmillan ! 
 Here you are . Do you need glue ? 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 I had a bad start of the day . I was stuck in a bad traffic jam on my way and I missed my morning meeting . 
 It is ok . My boss briefs me later on . 
 Err , kind of . You know this traffic jam is really bad with so many new cars hitting the streets these days . 
 yes , I just adopted her from the humane society this weekend . 
 well , i wanted to get a pet that wouldn't disturb the neighbors . at the same time , I wanted a pet that would be affectionate . 
 if you cuddle them a lot when they are very young , they can be just as affectionate as dogs or cats . 
 not really . I went to the veterinarian to get her vaccinated and she told me that all I needed to do was to make sure to trim its nails from time to time , to give her food and water , and to clean its 
 No , rabbits aren't very stinky . As long as your clean the cage on a regular basis , it's not too bad . 
 you can't train them like you can train dogs , but you can train them to do some things . For example , you can train them to go the bathroom in a special rabbit toilet . 
 not yet . She's pretty tame . I think she must be used to being around lots of different people . 
 No , it doesn't . There's no through bus to the National History Museum , madam . 
 You can transfer Fuchengmen . 
 Well , it's only three stops from here . 
 You're welcome . 
 Yes , this is the right bus . 
 Don't worry . I'll call out the stops . 
 No , don't worry . I'll get you off when you get there . 
 No , not that long . Two more stops , and you'll get off , sir . 
 Not at all . 
 We haven't had any problems so far . They offer a 24 - hour technical back-up service . We've called them in three times this month . They always arrive within a couple of hours . 
 No . There's no call-out fee . It's included in the annual service contract . 
 What about a motel ? 
 It's a hotel but cheaper and offers free parking . 
 Then let's stay in a motel . I am sure you will like it . 
 I love stir fry crispy bitesize vegetables covered in a mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce . Wilted greens and fresh bean sprouts . Throw in some onion and garlic and ginger ! Mmm ! Mmm ! It ’ s almost lunchtime . I would die for a plate of stir fry right now ! 
 What ? You call that a stir fry ? More meat than vegetables ? That ’ s the worst insult you could throw at a Chinese stir fry . What a disgrace to the wok she fried it in ! What you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap ! 
 I was planning on making some kind of vegetable . 
 What kind of vegetable do you want ? 
 How do you want it ? 
 I can boil it , grill it , or microwave it . 
 Is that really what you want ? 
 I guess I can do that . 
 Go right ahead . 
 Of course , what's the problem ? 
 Sure thing . 
 There is one just around the corner . 
 The price is moderate , but their work is sometimes not satisfactory . 
 No , there is not , as far as I know . 
 I live in Beijing . 
 My permanent address is Apt . 401 , 238 Zhongshan Road , Beijing . 
 My birthplace is Suzhou . 
 My domicile is Beijing . 
 ( My telephone number is ) 139xxxxx345 . 
 I see , sir.Those two ladies in front of your room did the same thing twenty minutes ago . 
 I'm afraid we have no extra key.So I'll send somebody to your room . 
 Please drop it at the front desk when you leave tie hotel . 
 It looks very nice and the food looks delicious . 
 Really ? 
 No , I haven ’ t . I have never eaten jellyfish before . 
 No , I have not and I ’ m not sure I want to try them now . 
 Follow me and I will lead you to your seat . 
 Of course . 
 Excuse me , How do I get to the Grand hotel ? 
 The Grand hotel , is it far from here ? 
 Well Mr . Black , I appreciate your interest in our company , but I doubt you can do this job properly . 
 I wish I could . But you even don ’ t have a B . A , so I ’ m sorry to say there ’ s no chance . 
 Mr . Black , I don ’ t think my boss will talk to you . It ’ s a Chinaman ’ s chance . 
 Can I go to my room , now ? 
 Thank you , sir . 
 It's for free , because your computers are still in the period of guarantee--two years . 
 They are working in another factory to provide maintenance right now . Let me call them and see whether they have solved the problem . Please wait a moment . 
 That's wonderful . I appreciate your efficiency and cooperation . 
 Thank you again ! 
 Yes , I have a driving license . 
 Sure . 
 That's fine with me . 
 As long as it isn't too far from this city , I don't mind . 
 I think I can commute that far without any trouble . 
 No , nothing in particular . Thank you . 
 Yes , but I don't mind working hard . 
 This is John . 
 I wonder if I can use your bike . 
 I see . What is your baggage ? And do you remember the tag's number or color ? 
 Could you give me a description of your case ? 
 I'll check it for you . I've found it . Is this yours ? 
 Will you show me your key card , please ? 
 All right . Now you can take your case away 
 OK ! What about taking them outside and flying a kite . 
 Ann , it's terrible ! 
 Look , this is a pimple ! 
 How come ? 
 I have no bad habit . I sleep eight hours a day , never eat spicy food , clean the face twice a day and so on . I have done a lot . 
 I wasn't aware of that ! 
 I am afraid the label is not quite suitable for this locality . Could you quote us for the order with neutral cases ? 
 In that case , we'd like you to make some changes in the labeling . 
 First , the languages on the label should be in both English and French . Second , the red color doesn't suit our national customs . Could you print the label in some light colors such as yellowish or bluish ? 
 The brand name and the nice artwork need not be changed , but the net weight must be placed on the lower part of the panel . 
 Thanks for your help . 
 Yes , of course . What area are you interested in ? 
 What size house would you like ? 
 Are you interested in being in a particular school district ? 
 Would you like a home near the lake or would you prefer a view ? 
 Fine , I will begin a search for the perfect home for you . I will call you in a few days . 
 Sure . What's this for ? 
 What about measuring the floor for a new carpet , and the walls for new wallpaper ? 
 Good idea . I was thinking the same myself . 
 What should I do when I find a job ? 
 Does it make a difference ? 
 If I get work for a few weeks , will I be terminated from EDD ? 
 I think mum should not take sides . After all , we are all her children . 
 It ’ s unfair . 
 How can I help you ? 
 What kind would you like to open ? 
 Do you already have an account with us ? 
 Do you want to transfer money from that account ? 
 How much ? 
 It ’ ll only take me a minute to complete your transaction . 
 I'd like to speak Dr.Johnson . 
 This is Robert Jordan.Would you ask him to call me back , please ? 
 Is there a bus in Altadena that'll take me to downtown LA ? 
 The 486 really goes downtown ? 
 How long is the bus ride ? 
 Is that right ? 
 Is that a crowded bus ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Hello . My name ’ s Linda Brown . What can I do for you today ? 
 Certainly . First , I would like to ask you some questions to identify your needs before I show you what we have . 
 What price range are you interested in ? 
 Okay . Do you have a special location in mind ? 
 When would you like to move in ? 
 How about the end of this month ? 
 Are there any special features that you would like to have , such as , a dishwasher , a balcony , a swimming pool , central air conditionining , etc . ? 
 Okay . Here are the photos of the apartments that fit your preferences . 
 Yes . It ’ s only 5 minutes walk from the campus . 
 Is there any way of ensuring we'll have enough time for our talks ? 
 So our evenings will be quite full then ? 
 Don't use a hair spray . I want my hair set and dried . 
 That's all right.Thank you . 
 Shall I take a picture of all of you ? 
 All right . Say cheese ! 
 You ’ re welcome . I hope it'll come out well . 
 Can I have a look at your international timetable ? 
 Yes . Do you have any direct flight to Tokyo ? 
 What about a flight to Paris ? 
 Excuse me . I wonder if you can help me . 
 I'm completely lost . I'm trying to find the way to my daughter's home . 
 Her home is between the China hotel and Li Sheng Theater . 
 I'm grateful to you . 
 How is your job search 1 going , Janet ? 
 Are you serious ? You studied mathematics at college for four years , and now you have a job working with your hands ! 
 I can see that . But I didn ’ t know you had experience in that line of work . 
 Congratulations ! You do have the right attitude . 
 Do you need money or what ? 
 Half the dough huh . Well . How would you like to earn the other half ? 
 I thought you'd never ask . The lawn needs to be mowed and the garage deserves to be cleaned . 
 I've got a sore throat , a runny nose and a headache . 
 I am not very sure . Maybe for three days . 
 I guess so . It comes and goes . 
 Is that serious , doctor ? 
 Oh , doctor . Do I have to ? I am afraid of needles ! 
 Oh , doctor , please ... 
 You are right . I won't cry anymore . 
 What kind of benefits are we talking about ? 
 Are these things negotiable ? 
 Vacation time is important to me . I would be willing to give up these other items in order to receive more vacation days . 
 Possibly . What do you have in mind ? 
 I don't feel like eating . And I cannot sleep well . 
 Yes , a low fever . I feel terrible . Am I dying ? 
 Before the meals or after the meals ? 
 Hi Jane , you look great . 
 Yes , I took off 4 kilos . I am glad you notice it . 
 No no , I just changed my eating habits . I eat a balanced meal . and I eat less than before . 
 What a beautiful day ! 
 I was worried about canceling the climbing . 
 What about taking the cable car ? 
 Wow , What a long queue this is ! 
 Daddy , look ahead in the distance , the mountains there . They roll all the way up to the sky . 
 So you wanna stay here ? 
 What can I do to help you ? 
 I could do some typing for you . 
 Sure I will get to do that right now . 
 I have worked here long time . 
 I'm not sure . Let me think about it . 
 Good morning , I ’ m Daniel . I ’ m applying for the positon of manager . 
 I got to know your company through such famous brands as LUX , LIPTON and WALLS . After making a customer survey , I was glad to find out how your products are appreciated by millions of Chinese . 
 It ’ s the job I ’ m interested in . And your company is the best-known . Although I don ’ t have much experience as a manager , the job description you sent to me was very interesting . It ’ s a job I ’ Ve been dreaming of and I feel suited to fill it . 
 I don ’ t think so . As the saying goes , A great oak needs deep roots . I ’ m really interested in this job . 
 Excuse me , can I order now , please ? 
 I ’ d like the lasagna , please . 
 I ’ ll try the vegetarian , please . 
 I would like to buy two exquisite watches for me and my girlfriend . 
 This pair is Rolex , right ? 
 What function does this watch have ? 
 Sounds good . 
 How long is the guarantee ? 
 How much does the pair cost ? 
 It is a bit expensive . But it is worth buying one's favorite . I will take them . 
 Thank you for your consideration . We will inform you of our intention as soon as possible . 
 Hello , is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Have you made a reservation ? 
 So your room number is 201 . Are you a member of our hotel ? 
 Well , we offer a 10 % charge for our members . 
 True . I always see him drinking instant . 
 Do you think that will be enough to make him have a change of heart ? 
 Can I help you , madam ? 
 Would you like to try this one on ? 
 All right.How about this one ? 
 Of course , madam . 
 Yeah . That ’ s right . What can I do for you ? 
 Let me see . Yeah , all right . I ’ ll be over about two . 
 What ? But today is my birthday ! 
 But Steven , why don't you ask for a leave ? ... Steven , why don't you speak ? Are you still there ? 
 Okay ! Bye ! 
 My washing machine isn't working . 
 The water will not drain . 
 No , that's it . 
 When will you be able to fix it ? 
 That would be perfect . 
 See you then . 
 Come in , please . 
 Yes.How much is that ? 
 Would you please charge them on my bill ? 
 Excuse me , could you tell me whether there is a restaurant near here ? 
 I'm afraid there must be a lot of people there . 
 But we don't know the telephone number . 
 You are so kind ! Thank you very much . 
 Pardon me . Does your hotel have a fitness facility ? 
 Great ! Where is it ? 
 Do I have to pay extra ? 
 What are the gym hours ? 
 Great ! Is a trainer available ? 
 How do you think the report I wrote ? 
 I jumped the gun . 
 Yes , I overlooked some facts . I ’ ll be more sorrow . 
 Sure , I used to work there . Go straight for about a mile , then turn left at the light . The mall will be on the right . 
 Yes , the address is 541 Main street . 
 No problem . 
 No , that way is longer . There are more stop lights on that street . 
 Excuse me , sir . Can I help you ? 
 This is the house I want to rent . 
 No problem . First , it's comfortable and cozy . Second , it has a lovely view of the city . Third , it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need , such as refrigerator , electric stove , heating apparatus , washing machine and dishwasher . Forth is the most important , the electricity is free of charge . Finally , it's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient . 
 200 dollars per week . 
 It certainly is . But to tell you the truth , the room is so large that I can share it with someone else , and that will decrease the total amount of the rent . 
 Don't you think I can save some bus fares since it ’ s easy to go anywhere from here and it ’ s near the place where I work ? 
 Twice a week for work and once for shopping . 
 That's true . Ok , I will think about it . 
 Oh , I'm sorry . I didn't see the stop sign at the corner . I didn't mean it . 
 Oh , sorry , I don't have it on me . Honestly , I forgot it at the house . But I have the insurance policy with me . Here it is . 
 I understand , officer . I guess it's just not my day today . I will accept the fine . 
 Surely it's a sound idea , Mr . Joey . But I have a few questions for you first . 
 First , can I know something about your financial situations ? 
 Thank you . And how is your business in the clothing business circle ? 
 Then what do you deal with ? 
 That's nice . They provided us with convenient choice . 
 I'd like to hear that . 
 That sounds attractive , all right , how about that we sign a one year contract ? 
 Excuse me . I'd like to cash the traveler's check . 
 In tens and fifties , please . 
 OK , thank you . 
 Hi , I ’ m Paul . Could you show me the apartment on the first floor ? 
 I like this one . How much is the rent ? 
 Does the rent include utilities ? 
 Where ’ s the laundry room ? 
 What ’ s your rule about pets ? 
 How come ? 
 who takes care of bug control ? 
 Thank you very much for taking your time . I ’ m still deciding . I will call you tomorrow . 
 I was in my friend's room , talking for an hour or so . 
 I came back to my room and found my suitcase was open and my camera and five hundred dollars in cash inside the wallet were gone . 
 Yes , this is my overseas travel accident insurance card . 
 Mr.Sellers ? It's Steven speaking , your tenant . We've just suffered a power failure.What should I do now ? 
 Yes , I do . 
 How do I know if it's blown out ? 
 Then what shall I do ? 
 OK , I'll try . I'll call you again if that doesn't work . 
 No , thank you . Just the check . 
 No , it is my treat . 
 Yes , I owed you for last time . 
 Verry sorry to have kept you waiting so long . What do you want , Madam ? 
 How long would you like your haircut today ? 
 You wanna tight , medium or naturally curly perm ? 
 How about you hair style ? 
 Well , with perm we can do very kinds patterns such as bob , chocolate hairstyle or bang.Which do you prefer ? 
 It looks wonderful . 
 What do you think of it ? 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Yes.we have herb medicine and ready-made medicine . 
 Sorry , sir . The angelica is out of stock now . 
 Which room are you staying in now , sir ? 
 Usually if you are leaving today , you'd better check out before 12 noon , and leave the room . If you check out after 12 noon , we will count one day more . 
 Since your plane leaves at 3 p . m . it will be too early for you to leave the hotel at 12 0 ' clock . We can arrange you to stay in the room until 1 p . m . ; but first you should still check out before 12 noon . 
 Yes , sir . Here it is . 
 Your bill comes to 60 dollars . How would you like it to be paid ? With cash or credit card ? 
 Would you please give to me , and will imprint it ? 
 Here you are . 
 Yes , that's a video camera . 
 I am calling to apply to work in your agency of entry . 
 Yes . I know many ambassadors in Chinese Embassy and British Embassy in China . 
 Good morning , Mrs . Smith . 
 What kind of books does she like ? 
 Excuse me ! 
 We're ready to order . A cup of coffee for me , and a glass of oranges for her . 
 Just black coffee . Do you serve anything else besides drinks , say cake . 
 Give me two pieces of cake . 
 How long have you had it ? 
 I think you've got a cold . 
 I'll give you some medicine , and you will be better in a couple of days . 
 Lisa , are there family rules in this house ? 
 Like what ? 
 Is there anything else ? 
 Her room is very neat and clean . 
 I will keep my room clean , too . That's a promise . 
 Do you have any rooms available next Saturday and Sunday night ? 
 A double room , please . 
 My name is Monica Cellar . 
 Thank you . 
 Lily , I ’ m not sure . Let me check , I think I spent $ 50 . 
 I know that I should learn how to save more , but I hope that we can spend a little on ourselves sometimes . 
 That ’ s okay . I ’ m sorry , too . It ’ s a good idea to prepare for the future possibilities . 
 I said it's a lovely day . Why don't we go for a walk ? 
 Come on ! A little labor , much health . 
 Don't take too long . It would be a shame not to take advantage of such lovely weather . 
 Believe I will . Look for me near the lake . 
 Yes . I'd like to travel to London . So I want you to make a reservation for me on May 1st . 
 That's great ! I'd like to take the first available flight . I'll need an economy ticket 
 One way trip . What's the fare , please ? 
 I see . Is my ticket confirmed then ? 
 Here is 2,300 yuan . 
 Great Britain Airline , anything I can do for you ? 
 Hold on please , I will check for you . Flight GB152 takes off every day at 13 
 OK . Don't forget to get your ticket three days ahead . 
 Oh , that's right . They're filming a movie up there , aren't they ? 
 I wonder how all the businesses in the area feel about that . 
 The movie company has to pay them ? 
 Oh , yeah , they get to be in a movie for the whole world to see ! 
 Yes , do you have any rooms available ? 
 No . I need a double and three triples . My family is waiting for me in the car . 
 Ok ... Here you are . 
 Is breakfast included ? 
 Mr . Lee , all ready to check out ? We ’ Ve already prepared your bill , and housekeeping has done a quick check of the room . How will you be paying ? 
 The bill is itemized , so take some time to look through it and make sure we ’ Ve charged you for the correct services . Most of your extra charges were for phone calls and room service . 
 That ’ s the mini-bar . Each day we check what ’ s missing and restock it . The items you consume are put on your bill . 
 Those are for pay-per-view movies . Each time you selected a movie , the entertainment system prompted you to confirm that you really wanted it , right ? 
 Hello , Vicki . 
 Well , you can have it for eleven hundred — as a friend . 
 What ? Seven hundred ? 
 No , one thousand at least . 
 You ’ re a thief , Vicki . But I guess , eight hundred and fifty is all right . 
 Victory for me , I bought it for 30 bucks just yesterday ! 
 I know . Did your mom double check on the church reservations ? 
 OK ... and what about the buffet and the cake ? Did your mom call the caterer ? 
 Great . She'll be so happy . 
 I am doing well . What ’ s up with you ? 
 The same with me . Have you given much thought to what you want to do next ? 
 How about interviews ? Have you been on any of those yet ? 
 How about the electrician program that they have listed over there ? 
 Let ’ s go see how we can apply for those positions . 
 I'm ok . I wish I could say the same for my friend . 
 he was arrested by the police for drinking and driving . 
 unfortunately not . He was charged with a DUI when he was in university . 
 not much ; it was a minor offence back then . He got away with a fine of $ 500 . 
 no , they were really easy on him . The problem is that that was a long time ago . They are much tougher on crime now . 
 well , he'll definitely lose his license , pay a fine , and maybe even spend some time in jail . 
 not yet . If we can't find a lawyer for him , then the state will appoint him with one . 
 that'd be great ! I know he'd appreciate your help . 
 I got a great look at him . 
 I can do that . 
 All right . 
 He's there . 
 He's number four . 
 I'm glad to help . 
 I'm Mr . Stephen's secretary . He has an appointment with Mr . Green today . 
 I'm afraid we have to reschedule it . 
 I'm very sorry . But Mr . Stephen must leave for Hong Kong right away . 
 That will be fine . 
 What happened ? 
 She did ? Why didn't anyone tell me ? 
 No , I had no idea . 
 Oh my God , that's great ! 
 I think that I might . 
 Thanks for telling me . 
 Sorry , I don ’ t know the rule about punching . 
 Do we also need to punch out after work ? 
 How about the lunch break , Lucy ? 
 May I ask whether we need to work overtime ? 
 Could you give some information on your European tours ? 
 I would be interested in a ten-day trip around Christmas time . 
 What is the cost ? 
 That sounds reasonable . Let me think it over . And I'll call your back to make reservation . 
 Are you through with your meal ? 
 Here is your check , 86 dollars in all . Can I take care of it here when you are ready ? 
 No , I'm sorry we don't . We accept credit cards and cash . 
 I'll be right back . 
 I see . I'll bring some to-go boxes for you . 
 I'd like to see a tea set , please ? 
 They're OK , but I prefer chinese ones . 
 Could you help me figure out how to look for a job ? 
 I want to work in an office . 
 I want to work full-time . 
 I am confused a bit but I am sure that I can figure it out . 
 No , I don't think I need to do that . 
 So how ’ s everything going for Christmas ? 
 What ’ s that ? Don ’ t tell me you ’ Ve still got Christmas cards to write , it usually takes my wife a month to write all of ours . 
 He still doesn ’ t know that Santa isn ’ t real ? How old is he , eight ? 
 You think it ’ s better that he should be told ? 
 That happened to my oldest girl . She became really upset when her classmates told her Santa wasn ’ t real . 
 Well , when you tell him , be gentle . It ’ s hard for kids to find out something like that . 
 Okay , if you'll please fill out these forms ... ( She hands the forms to the customer . ) There's a minimum initial deposit of $ 100 for the checking account , and a minimum deposit of $ 500 for the savings account . 
 Certainly . Just make them out to National Bank , and sign and date them . 
 It ’ s a beautiful day here in New Zealand at the Men ’ s Volleyball world championship . My name is Rick Fields and I ’ m joined by the man with the plan , Bob Copeland . 
 The ref signals the start of the game and here we go . Ribero serves and China quickly receives the ball . Chen bumps it to the setter , and ... a very nice set by Chen ! 
 It ’ s China ’ s service now . What a superb jump serve by Li , oh , and we have a let serve . The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net . 
 Oh , my God ! I feel nothing is going smooth . 
 Good afternoon , Chloe , I ’ m Doctor Evans.What seems to be the problem ? 
 Ah I see , yes you do sound rather croaky.Well let ’ s have a look , shall we ? Could you please open your mouth and say ah . 
 Good , yes , your tonsils are a little swollen and red . How are your ears , blocked at all ? 
 Ok Chloe , can you please breathe in and out slowly for me while I listen to your chest ? You really are all bunged up , you don ’ t sound too good at all . Ok , I ’ m going to set you up with a bunch o 
 Absolutely not ! You are highly contagious ! You don ’ t want to infect the rest of your co-workers do you ? I recommend staying in bed for at least three days and drinking plenty of fluids so yo 
 Ha-ha , sure not a problem ! Here you are.Now off you go and away to bed . If you have any questions just give me a call ! Feel better soon and take care . 
 Maria sings like a lark , doesn't she ? 
 Maybe she'll make a famous singer in the future . 
 What did you say your stop was ? 
 Oh , then you should have gotten off at the last stop . 
 But don't worry . You can get off at the next stop and walk back . It's not far . 
 You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth . The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend . They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord . 
 A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , " When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform , I was extremely nervous . When I looked down , I was nervous even more . If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to ' bakemeat ' . However , I knew my worries were unwanted . I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was 30 seconds . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or eight seconds . When rebounding to the high altitude , I felt a sudden sense of relief . I did not feel nervous very much , but very comfortable . " 
 Excuse me . What's the actual flying time from here to San Francisco ? 
 Can you tell me what time we're arriving ? 
 I see . 
 How many pieces of luggage do you want to check , sir ? 
 Ok.Is this your luggage properly labelled , sir ? 
 Ok.Would you please put all your luggage on the scales ? 
 Hand-baggage is not to be weighed , sir ... I'm sorry , sir , you're 25 kilos overweight . I'm afraid there'll be an excess luggage charge , sir . 
 Ten yuan for each kilogram.You ' ll have to pay 250 yuan for the excess baggage . 
 Yes . I'd like to . 
 Amy , you don't look so well . What happened ? 
 Do you feel anything else ? 
 Have you had similar feelings before ? 
 Don't worry . I believe you are just not agreeing with the local climate . I will get you some medicine . You will be alright after a good rest . 
 Who wants to go first ? Allen ? 
 OK . Put on something by the Backstreet Boys ! 
 I'd better not . Brooke hates the Backstreet Boys ! 
 It is . What can I do for you ? 
 Would that be a Fixed Deposit or a Current Deposit ? 
 We have various different types of Current Deposit , the Variable Term Deposit , a Notice Deposit and the Usual Current Deposit . Which would you like ? 
 OK , just a moment . I'll find the relevant data and help you with that . 
 Yes , I joined your group of bus tour this morning . You promised the journey will last 3 hours and we will visit 15 sightseeing spots . 
 But have 2 - hour journey . 
 Good morning . 
 I want to place a long-distance call to London . Is this the right counter ? 
 All right . Can you tell me when I will be able to get through ?

 Sure , I'll give them a bath . 
 I remember . What time do they need to be there ?

 May I know your full name ? 
 How do you spell your family name ? 
 What is your present address ? 
 May I ask your telephone number ? 
 Where are you from ? 
 May I ask the date of your birth ? 
 This is a very good meeting , Liz . 
 I think we have . Is there anything else to discuss ? 
 Then let's call it a day , shall we ? 
 After a while . 
 Are you kidding me ? Why do you say so ? 
 OK . Let me see where to start . 
 Sure . You should include your name , address and phone number in your resume . 
 Your job objectives , of course . In other words , what kind of job are you searching for ? 
 Yes . And don't forget to list them by date . Besides , you should begin with the most recent and then move backward . 
 No , it's also necessary to list a few related interests that are in some way connected to the jobs you want to take . 
 You said it . At last you ’ d better attach a list of references to your resume . 
 And one more thing , smile widely . 
 Yes , please . I'd like the steak and mushrooms . 
 I'd like it well done , please . 
 I think i have bake potatoes.And i now have a ice tea with lemon on the side , please .

 There're traffic jam everywhere this hour of the day ! 
 Yeah , we should have more roads built . 
 You look a little lost , can I help you ? 
 Well , you can ’ t give her granny panties.Have you thought about getting her somesleepwear ? We ’ Ve got these lovely , silky nighties . Or , how about a nice panty-and and-bra set . Look , here ’ s a nice satin push-up bra , and you can choose a few different styles of undies to go with it . 
 Well , do you want a thong , some bikini briefs , maybe this nice pair of lacy boy shorts ? 
 Here you are , sir . I ’ m sure she ’ ll enjoy them . 
 I ’ m sorry , sir . I ’ m going to have to take a look inside your bag . 
 Well , Let's get down to business ( shall we ? ) Now is probably a good time to start our discussion , the main purpose of this meeting is to talk about the benefits and disadvantages of our new project . 
 Isn ’ t he the best instructor ? I think he ’ s so hot . Wow ! I really feel energized , don ’ t you ? 
 What ’ s wrong ? Didn ’ t you think it was fun ? ! 
 Oh , no , get off it . It wasn ’ t such a killer class . You just have to get into it . Like they say , no pain , no gain . 
 Look , next time get yourself some comfy shoes . You ’ re gonna come back again with me , aren ’ t you ? 
 Come on . You ’ ll feel better after we hit the showers . 
 Where did you find this apartment ? 
 Really ? I can ’ t believe you actually found an apartment in the ads . 
 I want to hear more about this apartment . 
 How much will you have to pay for rent ? 
 For where we live , that is really inexpensive . 
 I ’ m glad to hear that you finally found an apartment . 
 What's the matter , sir ? 
 No , I haven't , sir . 
 But sir , I didn't drink at all . 
 OK , I will blow . 
 But I ...

 I'm sorry to bring up my resignation at this moment , but I've decided to study abroad . 
 Thank you , sir . I'd like to say that I ’ Ve really enjoyed working with you . However , I think it ’ s about time for me to leave . 
 Thank you . 
 Thank you.That ' s the result of exercise . 
 No , but I am starting working out from now on . 
 I'll try one of these on . ( The customer tries one of the shoes on . ) It's too big . It slides up and down my heel when I walk around . 
 Not really . It pinches my toes . 
 I don't know ... well , I guess I'll take them , since you don't seem to have anything better . 
 Why have you stopped production ? 
 OK . Make sure the power is switched off then tighten up all the bolts on the unit and replace the broken blade . Why is there oil all over the floor ? 
 Clean up the mess first , then fit a new seal and check the valve . 
 Of course , ma'am . Tell me where to go . 
 All right . There we go . 
 I had to . I was missing you a lot . 
 So , why haven't you visited me ? 
 What have you been doing ? 
 I've also been busy . 
 Basically , I've been working too . 
 So am I . 
 Good coming . Are you through with the cleaning ? If not , we'll come back a little later . 
 It doesn't take much time . I'm used to tidying up my room myself . 
 I have a suit that needs cleaning . 
 Excuse me , where is the nearest gas station ? 
 To the traffic lights ? 
 Left at the lights ? 
 Right at the bridge ? 
 Wow ! So many students crowded in . More than I excepted , we are lucky to arrive in hour earlier . Or else we definedly have problems to getting good seats . 
 Yeah , I hate sitting in the front row . 
 That would be great . 
 Ok . 
 Yes . I want to make a plane reservation to Shanghai , China . 
 Feynman Black . I want to leave on October 15th . 
 Well , I need an economy ticket . 
 Single . How much ? 
 OK . Here you are . Is my ticket confirmed then ? 
 OK . Thank you . 
 How long did you have in mind ? 
 Seeing as next month is our slow season , that should not be a problem . 
 Just make sure to turn in all the necessary paperwork to ensure there are no problems with the days you want to take off . 
 Yes . I had a bad traffic accident.Look , my car looks like a squashed coke can . 
 No , I didn't . That car was too fast . 
 I don't remember . 
 40 miles per hour . 
 Just straight . 
 No , I didn't get hurt . Thanks for your concern . 
 Could you hold the elevator , please ? Thanks a lot . 
 I'm headed to the 18th floor , the top floor . 
 Do you work there ? I have an interview today with Dale Mendoza . Do you know her ? 
 To tell you the truth , I'm really nervous . I had a dream last night that I was being interviewed by a three-headed monster that kept trying to bite my head off . Oh , wow , my palms are sweaty just thinking about it . I just hope Ms . Mendoza won't be able to hear my teeth chattering . I just hope I get through this in one piece . 
 Well , how many tax-free things can I bring with me ? 
 I think I have nothing to declare . I have just brought a bottle of wine . 
 It's nice to meet you , Mr . Cooper . 
 Yes , it was quite a long flight . I'm glad to finally be here . 
 It's quite good . I will take it . 
 Well . I am a traveler from China . Would you please mail to China ? 
 How much altogether ? 
 Do you receive cash only ?

 Where did you go to university ? 
 What degree did you get ? 
 What was your major ? 
 What was you G . P . A ? 
 Do you plan to pursue further education ? 
 When do you think you will do that ? 
 I see . 
 Come in , please . 
 Oh , very good . I've been waiting for your report all week . 
 OK , I will see it soon . You can go back now . 
 Bye . 
 How would you like to pay ? 
 Cash or card is fine . 
 Do you have a United States R . N . license ( i . e . Registered Nurse license ) ? 
 Could you tell me about your professional education ? 
 What can I do for you ? 
 OK , let me see . This white shirt can be washed in water with hands , but this suit and the woolen sweater should be dry-cleaned . 
 Yes , the cost for dry-cleaning is three times of that for ordinary laundering . But for suits and sweaters , you can only take them to the dry cleaners ' . 
 Did it ever shrink or fade ? Generally speaking , the dark-colored clothes always fade away gradually . 
 Never mind . You can leave them to me . 
 It's very simple . Divide the clothes by the colors , and wash them in cold water . If you've got some special stains on them like sugar , coffee or something else please let the dry cleaner know . 
 That will be 80 Yuan altogether . Here is your invoice . 
 Good morning , nurse . I want to see the dentist , please . 
 No , I don't . 
 Yes , it is . It's very urgent . I feel awful . I have a terrible toothache . 
 I must see the dentist now , nurse . 
 That's very late . Can the dentist see me now ? 
 I can wait , but my toothache can't ! 
 What do you mean , Janice ? 
 I ’ m sorry , Janice . But we ’ Ve been waiting on the client . It ’ s out of our hands at the moment . 
 Yes , I would like to look at some of your products . 
 Well , to be honest , I mostly use Sarah Winter products now . But I'm not happy with them . So I would like to change companies . 
 What do you have in foundation ? 
 What colours do you have in foundation ? 
 The color I use now is rose . How much does this rose foundation cost ? The 100ml bottle . 
 Wow ! That's expensive . 
 I understand .

 Let me have the baby-back ribs . 
 That will be it for now . 
 We are happy to help you . May I know which one it is ? 
 Oh , it is conveniently located , isn't it ? 
 I believe it will . It comes furnished . You can move in immediately after the lease is signed . 
 Yes . But not including the utilities . 
 I believe that can be arranged . But there should be a refundable security deposit , you know . 
 So click here , then up to the top . 
 Then open that window . Yeah , that one . 
 And that's it . You're done . 
 How do you like your job here , Linda ? 
 Why ? 
 I'm happy to hear that , but publishing is more than just talking to writers . it involves a lot of work , patience and responsibility . Most of the work is boring . 
 Do you have any complaints ? 
 Yes , you have many opportunities to grow in this company as long as you do well . 
 Hello.This is room 1205.Our message lamp is flaming . 
 Thank you . 
 Would you bring the message to my room ? 
 Then I'll come down and pick up the message immediately . 
 What's the matter with you , Mary ? You look a bit pale . 
 Have you taken any medicine ? 
 Well , if I were you , I'd go to see the doctor . That might help . And you'd better stay in bed today instead of going to work . 
 The next bus will be here in four minutes . 
 No , it's the number fifty-eight . 
 No , it won't . 
 Never . 
 That's right . The number forty-four doesn't stop here any more . It's stop is round the corner . 
 May I see your ticket , please ? 
 You can get a boarding pass at that counter . Do you have anything to check in ? 
 Then you could wait in the departure area after going through security . 
 Yeah , I think so . It is very simple . 
 Did you watch the finale last night ? My favorite singer won ! 
 Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions . 
 Me too . 
 Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ? 
 He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him .

 Have a nice flight back , and take care . Thanks for your call . 
 no , I was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . How about you ? 
 I'm absolutely useless at cooking ! 
 I know they aren't good for me , but they are cheap , convenient , and fairly tasty .

 what do we do first ? 
 ok . Should I heat the wok ? 
 what about the chicken ? 
 how about the rice ? 
 white rice , please . None of that healthy brown stuff for me ! 
 You don't have to restrict yourself to a taxi . We can offer you a private vehicle . 
 Some people find a limo to be much more comfortable than a taxi . 
 No upgrade of any kind . And where might you be going ? 
 When shall I tell the taxi to be here ? 
 The taxi will be here immediately , sir . 
 You won't have to wait a second , sir . 
 Single or double ? 
 Do you have a reservation ?

 How much is an airmail letter to Japan ? 
 I'd like a 20 - cent stamp , please . 
 When you are in a restaurant and you want the waiter to bring the bill , what do you do to attract his attention ? 
 I went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and I noticed that many people shouted for the bill . 
 That ’ s what I thought . I just thought I ’ d ask you and see what you thought of it . Anyway , what did you do yesterday evening ? 
 Did you ? How is he these days ? 
 I need to move some furniture . Could you help me to lift it ? 
 Let ’ s move the sofa . Can you get a grip on the bottom at that end ? I ’ ll lift this end . I want to move it sideways in that direction . 
 Sure , go ahead . 
 I don ’ t have much contact with them . 
 No , I don ’ t . I ’ m too afraid of making mistakes in English . I don ’ t want to be laughed at . 
 Thanks for the advice . I guess you ’ re right . It ’ s just hard to overcome my shyness . I really will try from now on . I promise . 
 Excuse me , sir . What kind of drink do you want ? 
 Yes , but you have to pay for it . 
 Wait a minute , I will bring you some juice . 
 Yes , you do . The Hot Cap is back here in the corner . I think we're ready to put the curlers in . What kind of perm would you like ? 
 All right . What if we leave your bangs straight and just perm the sides and back ? 
 Around 30 minutes . 
 Of course . Generally speaking , dressing should be tidy and neat , and match well with your identity , age , and experience . 
 Professional suits may be the best choice . 
 Ladies should wear professional suits , either classical style or free style . It would be appropriate to wear a little or no make-up . 
 Name brand is not necessary . Anything decent will be fine . 
 Only when you dressing keep in accordance with that of other people around can you feel harmonious and relaxed . 
 In other words , too much emphasis on it is undoubtedly to neglect the essentials . 
 Tell me what the problem is . 
 What was the charge for ? 
 Are you sure that you didn't make that purchase ? 
 I apologize . What day was this purchase made ? 
 All right , we'll do an investigation . 
 No , you don't . We'll take care of it . 
 Yes , thank you so much . 
 Yes , my table is for 7 and it's near the window . 
 I ’ d like to be fitted for a suit please . 
 Well , I thought that I would choose either this one or that one . I really want a dark blue suit . Which do you recommend . 
 Yes . I can feel the difference in material . There ’ s not much difference in price . Ok , I ’ ll take the more expensive one . 
 That ’ s fine . I would also like a few shirts and a jacket . I don ’ t need them specially made . Those shirts over there look very nice . Are they made of cotton ? 
 I ’ ll take three light blue ones , please . 
 Just a casual one - a sport jacket . This one looks nice . I ’ ll just try it on ... yes , that ’ s fine . I ’ ll take it . Here ’ s my credit card . 
 Thank you very much . I ’ ll see you the day after tomorrow . 
 That's true . You need to take some time off to relax . 
 When are you going to take your vacation ? 
 I really envy you . You know I'm not taking my vacation until December . 
 I'd like to buy a tie to match this suit . 
 Well , the color is all right . But it looks outdated.Can you show me that one ? 
 Really ? 
 I can ’ t make out anything , the words are too light . I thought they have already changed the toner cartridge this month . 
 Ok , no problem . We do it ourselves . 
 Check with somebody from the IT department . They are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment . 
 I can confidently say that my Chinese and English are pretty good . I won prizes in many speech contests in both Chinese and English . 
 I believe every company has its own salary criterion . And you will give me a satisfying salary according to my abilities and performances . 
 Hello , yes , I opened an L / C with you recently . We opened it 7 days ago . 
 We would like to amend it , please . 
 It's all agreed , here's a letter to prove it . 
 Hello , Oriental Hotel . 
 I ’ m sorry , Mr . Baker ’ s not in . May I take your message ? 
 Alright . Mr . Cook , I have Mr . baker called you back as soon as he gets here . 
 Okay , Mark , What ’ s up ? 
 That was my line , Mark . I know we worked on the ad together , but that was definitely my line . 
 Do I have a choice ? You said the guy who was supposed to do it didn't show . 
 Just come over here , sir . First you need to sign in and get your photo nametag .

 I am not sure , sir . Generally we can , but look at the traffic . It's the rush hour . 
 We are really in a hurry . 
 I'll do my best .

The president now is Mr . Jackson . The Shanghai branch was founded five years ago with a staff of more than 2,000 . 
 May I work in sales department ? 
 I ’ m paid 2,000 yuan per month plus some allowances and bonus as that come to about 3,000 yuan a month . How much will you pay me ? 
 Do you have any fringe benefits ? 
 How about insurance and full health insurance ? 
 That sounds good . 
 Really ? OK ! 
 Very comfortable . I think I will come next time . Maybe I will take some friends . Amazing ! 
 I need help picking out a lotion . 
 I picked up some poison oak while hiking , and I can ’ t stop itching . 
 Do you find that one works better than the other ? 
 Is there anything I can take that will help with the itching ? 
 Thank you for helping me figure out what to do with my poison oak . 
 I'm free on Sunday . I'd like to take a look in Beijing City , could you tell me where to go ? 
 Any place will be fine . you make the decision . 
 I will pick you up at your hotel at eight in the morning .

 Thank you , 175 yuan . 
 Here is your change and your receipt.Do you have goods unpaid on you , sir 
 I'm sorry I need to call the security to have a look . 
 Sorry , sir , it's my job to make sure the goods are paid .

 Paul , a company called me for an interview .

 How about make up ? 
 What will you have ? 
 Which do you prefer , meat or fish ? 
 Then why don't you try the Chef's Steak Special ? 
 I am here to sign my escrow papers . 
 Should I have brought anything with me ?

 Will the house be mine when we finish these documents ? 
 Would you tell me how I send this parcel to shanghai , China ? It contains only books . 
 I wonder if you could have ensured here . 
 Let me see . I think I can have the ensured five hundred dollars . 
 Here ‘ s the check for hen dollars 
 We've got a beautiful two - double room with a bath an shower . 
 Yes , I'd like to make an appointment to see the doctor . My name is Randy Horn . 
 Yeah , I guess I can survive until tomorrow . 
 In the morning , if possible . 
 That would be fine . 
 Hello , Friendship Hotel . How can I help you ? 
 What are the dates , sir ? 
 Good morning . I ’ m thinking about buying some new furniture for my living room . Could you help me ? 
 I came to your store yesterday and have come back today to make a final decision . I think I like the black leather suite . It ’ s on sale , isn't it ? 
 I ’ ll take it . I also need to improve the lighting in my living room . Do you have any suggestions ? 
 It ’ s quite large . It ’ s about 40 square meters . 
 OK . I like the design of this lamps . I also need some cushion covers . I ’ ll just browse through those ones over there . 
 I'd been feeling pretty well until just a few days ago . 
 I feel run down , tired . I've been having headaches almost every day . And I'm not getting as much sleep as I usually do . 
 Well , I haven't been eating well , I guess . I usually only have enough time to grab a sandwich and a cup of coffee for lunch . 
 Sometimes I'm too tired to eat anything at all . 
 I don't like to take any medicine at all without talking it over with a doctor first . 
 Let's go get something to eat . 
 We can always go to the cafeteria and eat . 
 The food there is pretty good . 
 You can get whatever you want at the cafeteria . 
 They have really good chow mein . 
 It'll be fine . 
 This is Wang Miao from AB company speaking . Our CEO Mr . Green has an appointment with Mr . Liang tomorrow morning . But there is a minor change in tomorrow's schedule . Mr . Green has an abrupt urgent case tomorrow and he has to go abroad today . He wanted me to convey his apology to Mr . Wang . 
 And Mr . Green will make another appointment when Mr . Wang comes back . 
 Bye ! 
 I would like to withdraw my money and close my account please . 
 Here you are . 
 I will be leaving the city soon so I have no need for this account . 
 No problem . I ’ ll wait over there . 
 No , thanks . Coffee makes me wired and I will be nervous enough carrying all that cash . 
 Oh , it is really far from here . You ’ re going in the wrong direction actually . 
 It doesn ’ t matter . Go back the way you came . After about five kilometers , you ’ ll see a hotel on the side of the road . It ’ s a big one . You can ’ t miss it . 
 Take the next right . Drive about one click further , and you ’ ll see the entrance of the highway to the Great Wall . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Without traffic , it takes about an hour . 
 Yes , I think so . It doesn ’ t close until 5 o ’ clock . You still have plenty of time . 
 My pleasure , and have a good time ! 
 I would like to see your summer suits . 
 Will it wash well and the color won't fade ? 
 All the food smells tasty today and makes my mouth water . 
 What's on the menu today ? 
 Oh , we're lucky today , aren't we ? 
 I think I'll take fried fish , because fish is one of my favorites . 
 ( They get everything ready ) Here is a free table . Let's sit down . Help yourself to some fish please . Isn't it delicious and appetizing ? 
 I see . You people from south prefer sweet , don't you ? 
 Thank you . I'm through with one steamed bread and I'd like a second helping . 
 I'm always feeling hungry . 
 You can pick up your keys on Tuesday night . When you actually move in is up to you . 
 Make sure that you transfer the utilities to your name and tell them when you will be moving in . 
 An empty house is easier to paint and clean . Take a few days to take care of those things before you start moving your furniture in . 
 I think that will work out just fine . It will help when you move your groceries in and need to keep them cold . 
 My grandmother needs me to help her trim her roses that day . 
 Not exactly . Our address is ' www . zhilian-zhaopin . com . CN ' . 
 Of course . The website is ' www . zhilian - zhaopin . com . CN ' . 
 There ’ s a possibility . I ’ ll check it . 
 That ’ s all right . I ’ ll be right back . 
 Yes , it is . Kelly ? 
 Do you have a cold ? 
 Oh , no ! What about your presentation today ? 
 I understand . What should I tell Mr . Morley ? 
 Alright . Have you been to see a doctor ? 
 Do you think you'll be able to come in tomorrow ? Or should I call off your appointments for tomorrow too ? 
 It's rainy weather today . Maybe it's better if you just stay inside.Make yourself some chicken soup and sleep . 
 That bad , huh ? 
 Well , I'll cancel your appointments for today . And I'll tell Mr . Morley . 
 Hope you feel better . 
 Mary's is handling it . 
 Of course . Mary is our most experienced member . 
 I have no idea . 
 I was not aware of that . 
 You can't give me a break ? 
 How much is the ticket for ? 
 I have to go to court ? 
 Fine . Give me the ticket . 
 All of the produce is in aisle A . 
 Here you go . Look in this flyer , or check with the produce person . 
 I am a graduate of a technical university and have been employed as a technician with Company # for approximately 10 years . 
 I am looking for a growth opportunity , which I feel is not available at my current employer . In terms of skills , I am Microsoft certified in Windows XP and several other operating systems . 
 I see myself in a management position . 
 Yes . I received everything in the post this morning . 
 What's the exchange rate today ? 
 Great ! Do you need me to sign anything ? 
 I'd like to buy a bottle of Centrum , a tooth brushes . 
 Give me one bottle of thirty tablets . 
 Can I have a look at them ? 
 Are they cheaper ? 
 What made you decide on this type of occupation ? 
 Can you make yourself understood in English without too much difficulty ? 
 Do you know what the responsibilities are for a stewardess ? 
 Are you in good health ? 
 Have you had any nursing experience ? 
 How tall are you ? What about your eyesight ? 
 What would you say are your strengths and weaknesses ? 
 If a passenger can't understand what you say , what should you do ? 
 There are prescriptions . 
 Thank you ! 
 Susan , we ’ re going to need those data before tomorrow . 
 Yeah ? All right . Thanks , Susan . 
 Welcome to ABC electronics . First , let me go over what we do in the department during a typical workday . 
 That ’ s right , although we do expect you to do a little overtime if there ’ s something important to do . The lunch break is flexible . You can go a little earlier or a little later if you prefer . 
 Of course . The main thing is that all our work must be completed on schedule . We even allow our employee to go home early if they finish their work early . 
 You should attend a department meeting every Monday morning . There are other meetings for people working together on certain projects . Department heads also attend an interdepartmental meeting each week . 
 You are entitled to a company car . Have you seen it yet ? 
 Ok . This is your cubicle . At first , you ’ ll be responsible to me . Later , you ’ ll be working more independently . 
 That ’ s right . Make sure you give the accounts department all your bank account details as soon as possible . 
 I want to try on this suit . 
 I'm afraid it's too narrow across the shoulders . Do you have a larger one ? 
 It's a bit loose . Do you have a middle size ? 
 What a pity ! 
 The question is we only need one . 
 I should take the taller one for the choice . 
 Yes . I am Thou Ping . 
 Ping . P-I-N-G . 
 Yes , sir . It is Jane . It was given by my English professor when I was at the university . 
 My pen name is ' Dark Blue ' . 
 I like it very much . My name has became part of me . I don ’ t want to change it . 
 My present address is No . 21 South Zhongshan Road , Apt . 19 , Shanghai . The post code is 220150 . 
 Actually , I ’ m thirty now . 
 I was born in Xinjiang . 
 Han . 
 You ’ re welcome . For the moment , I have no further questions . I got a good picture of the job and the company . All my questions have been answered . Thank you for your time . 
 Ok , it was very nice to talk with you and I look forward to your decision at your earliest convenience . Bye . 
 Hi , is this Steven ? 
 Oh , sorry to hear that . Listen , I ’ Ve got a rush order . Can you help me out ? 
 How do you do ? 
 My name is Jim Jones . Are you coming for the interview ? 
 My computer isn ’ t running at the same speed it used to be , it is testing my patience everyday . Can you tell me how to make it run faster ? 
 How ? 
 Very useful advice , I will try them right now . 
 Sounds like a good idea . I love to play on the jungle gym . 
 That's great . Then we won't fight over taking the same ride . 
 They are morning glories . They are cute , aren't they ? 
 I think so . Last time I saw dandelions and ladybugs near the pond . 
 It's really healthy to do some exercise there . The air is fresher and it's romantic to watch the sunset with your lover . 
 What are your career goals , Miss Li ? 
 Great ! It sounds like you might be a good fit . As you know , we ’ re one of the largest brokerage houses in the world . Our daily work is quite hectic , and we , re looking for an assistant who can keep us organized ... help keep the engines running smoothly , so to speak . Our hours are long , but the overtime pay is good ... sort of makes up for the long hours . 
 Well , that ’ s the problem . We never seem to have ' typical ' days , but you'd spend about 30 % of your time on the computer . There would also be a lot of telephone time , setting up appointment , and taking care of a lot of support work . 
 Last month , we only had 40 hits on our site . Our products and prices are good , but the problem is that no one knows about our website . 
 We need to maximize the chances that our site will be at the top of search engine lists , but I'm not sure how to do it . 
 Yeah , you're right . We've got to get the most popular phrases there ... How else can we boost site traffic ? 
 I guess we could also put out a few advertisements for our website inside of the search engine . I would like to find the most effective way to let people know about our site and our products . 
 They are beautiful . 
 Of course . I will . 
 Let me see . Roll up your sleeve , please . Um ... it's swollen and red here . I'm afraid we'll need to take an X-ray to see if it's broken . 
 Then we'll put you in a cast . 
 Well , I ’ ll be glad to help you out . We can deliver what you need to your office . 
 We definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit . 
 Thank you for your interest in this job . You'll be hearing from us . Send the next applicant in on your way out , please . 
 It has been pleasant talking with you . 
 May I call you at your home about our final decision ? 
 We'll get in touch with you by next Wednesday . Thank you for your interest in this job . 
 Hello , sir . What can we do for you today ? 
 Would you like your hair washed as well ? 
 Okay , have a seat over here . How do you want it cut ? 
 All right . 
 Can you tell me which Sons you want to go to ? 
 You'll have to catch two different buses to get there . 
 The 268 is the first bus you need to catch . 
 Get off when you get to Fair Oaks and Washington . 
 Catch the 261 and get off at Sons . 
 That's all you have to do . 
 Well , if you can meet our deadline . 
 I also hope your quality will meet our standard . 
 Excellent . We will meet all your conditions if you can meet our demands . 
 How regular ? 
 You are kidding me ? It is against the labor law . They should be aware of their rights . 
 That ’ s not right , somebody should do something . 
 Yes , I wrote a thesis entitled English Education in High School and it was published in the Education Magazine . 
 Yes , I was chosen as a Three Goods student many times in college . 
 15 dollars per dozen 
 However , the quality of our exercise books is better than others . I can assure you that our price is the most favorable . A trial will convince you of my words . 
 This price of yours is out of the question . You must know that the cost of production has risen a great deal in recent years . 
 We'll have to discuss the problem later . 
 Could you give me an idea of how larger an amount you want ? 
 Then , let me check . For the large quantity you ask , considering the cost of raw materials , I think 13 dollar is our bottom line . And I can assure you this is the lowest price in the market in nowadays . 
 Will you introduce me to the new colleague ? 
 No , we haven't . 
 Today , you need to pay 20 RIB in handling fees . 
 I must tell you that because your banking has been such a large amount , you need to wait until you leave the country to get any currency back . 
 Yes , totally . It's nice to meet a customer who understands the system . 
 That's right . I know we have a complex system , but you have caught on so quickly . 
 Do you have trifles ? 
 Please bring me some trifles and apple pies . 
 A : Look at this survey conducted by a website . A quarter of the employees will spend an average of 10 minutes everyday online doing personal things . Hi , Francis , what about you ? 
 Though our company doesn ’ t have a return policy , limiting the personal use of internet , I don ’ t think the boss will like us to do that . 
 But it is lucky for us . The company computers don ’ t have software keeping tracks of websites we visit . I have shopped too often online these days . 
 Hey Ayden , I was wondering if you could do me a favor . 
 It's kind of a big favor . I'm absolutely flat broke , and I owe my landlady $ 200 . she's given me until Friday to give it to her , but I don't get paid until next Monday . Do you think you could loan me some cash until I get paid ? 
 If you can't give me the full amount , a fraction of it would still help . I'll pay you back on Monday . I promise . 
 Thanks a lot Ayden . Every little bit will help . Tell you what , if you aren't doing anything tonight , why don't you come over and have dinner at my place . 
 How about at 6 pm ? 
 I would like high speed internet installed in my house . 
 I'd like to make an appointment right now . 
 I would like to have it done this Friday . 
 Is it possible for someone to come a little earlier ? 
 How about Saturday ? 
 Can you come over at 11 
 What can I do for you ? 
 When do you need them , sir ? 
 No problem . Do you want 3 x 5 or 4 x 6 ? 
 And do you want the glossy or matted finish ? 
 You pay when you pick them up . I don't need a deposit for just one roll of film . 
 Where are you off to ? 
 Can you finish your homework in ten minutes ? 
 Sunshine Hotel . 
 With or without private bathroom ? 
 Sorry , we haven't got any . But we have a room without private bath room . 
 160 yuan . 
 Of course yes . 
 Me , too . 
 Nothing . 
 I'd love to , but I don't care for skating very much . 
 I like bowling , but I prefer to be along with you . 
 I don't feel like going out tonight , I am way too tired . I miss you , sweetheart . 
 How about the seaside ? 
 Are you busy on the 24th ? 
 Ok . 
 Alright and what is your name , please ? 
 Ah , yes , here you are Ms . Gleason . You reserved a single , right ? 
 Do you mind being next to the elevator ? 
 Excuse me . Can you direct me to the toy department , please ? 
 Can you direct me to the elevator ? 
 Thank you . 
 I'm taking my date to a restaurant . Could you tell me about one or two good ones ? 
 She will want an excellent restaurant , of course . 
 I wanted to go out somewhere , not stay here . Do you know of another good restaurant ? 
 I like that ! Could you please call them to see if we can get in tonight ? 
 I met a girl in elevator this morning . She works in a company upstairs . She said she envied the casual way we dress for work . She complained about the dress rule in her company . It requires everyone to wear formal clothes from Monday to Friday . 
 You know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ’ t that strict ? 
 But it is unjust to judge a book by its cover . If they ’ re not happy or comfortable with their clothes , they can be less productive . 
 OK , the job is a full-time one . 
 We need a person with ability and flexibility . 
 With an ocean view ? 
 A double room without a view for just one night ? 
 Yes , we do . 
 Excuse me may I know the name of your corporation ? 
 We found your samples very attractive.We ' re interested in buying your garments if your prices are reasonable 
 Can I have a reduction of seven percent ? 
 Can I use the FAS terms ? 
 We are interested in your pure silk , but I'm wondering about the price . How much will you possibly offer us ? 
 That's much higher than I expected . Can you come down a bit ? 
 Supposing we agreed to your price , what payment terms could you offer us ? 
 That would be nice . Let's call it a deal . 
 Let me have a look . Oh , yes . This one is the IC phone and the other is the coin phone . If you have an IC card , you can insert it into this slot , wait for the dialing signal appearing on the small screen , and then dial the number of the person you are going to call . 
 First , you pick up the receiver , wait for the dialing signal , dial the number , and then put the coin into the slot , press the ' speak ' button . Then everything is done . 
 I heard that EDD has special services to help me get a job . 
 I don ’ t have access to a computer . 
 Is there anything else at the EDD offices to help me with my job search ? 
 If I go to EDD in person , what type of workshops might I find there ? 
 What are some other places where I might look for work ? 
 Mr . White , I would like to give you notice that I will be leaving the company . It will be effective at the beginning of the next month . 
 I've been offered another job with higher salary . And it also gives me the opportunity of promotion . 
 You are really a good employer , Mr . White and I am very lucky to have such a good boss like you . But this new job is more in my field of interest training . It's something I have always wanted . 
 We cannot avoid being asked questions in the interview . Sometimes , my mind goes blank . 
 Admittedly , you can get prepared in advance for the interview , but you cannot cover everything concerned . 
 Firstly , your answer should go straight to the point , and be clear and brief . 
 Never should you give an answer completely beside the point . 
 Pretending to know when you do not know may expose yourself to ridicule . 
 Try to avoid the possible duplicate answer if you can . 
 Could I pay for my parking ticket ? 
 Here's my ticket right here . 
 I don't have it . 
 I don't understand why I can't just pay you . 
 I get it now . 
 Will my record be cleared after I pay the fine ? 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 OK . What kind of gas do you want ? 
 We have regular , super , and premium gasoline . This is a new car , so I'd recommend premium . 
 All right , sir . You will park at refueling 4 . 
 Your car's ready . 
 Ten gallons of premium . That's $ 18.56 , please . 
 Thank you , sir . Have a nice drive !

 Thank you for calling . I really appreciate your kindness . But right now , I ’ m very busy preparing for an interview of another company . I don ’ t think I am available for this opportunity . 
 Well , I will text it to you . Thank you , bye for now . 
 I want to go to china for sight-seeing . What do you think of it , Mum ? 
 Will you go with me , too ? 
 Do you have a moment ? 
 I'm having some trouble . I don't know how to use this printer . I've never seen this kind of office printer before . Is it a new brand ? 
 Silly me ! 
 Oh , it's out of paper . Do you have any more ? 
 Which one is this ? 
 Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 Right now fight BW159 is the only one available , it is a non-direct one .

 About 1 hour . Would you buy it ? 
 Good evening , sir . can I help you ? 
 Just a minute , please . 
 That's right . 
 OK , do you want it urgently ? 
 Right , here you are . 
 May I help you ? 
 You are Miss Liu ? 
 Please take a seat .

 Have you brought your credentials ? 
 Good morning . I'd like to buy tickets to Paris .

 And do you have any medicine for air sickness ? 
 I ’ ll appreciate your help 
 No.May I help you ? 
 Oh , that's where I'm going . 
 Yes . We are looking for someone who are well-educated and have all-round experience as a manager . 
 Great . What about having a formal interview on Monday next week ? 
 What kind of job do you think I should get ? 
 China is now a member of world trade organization . As a member of TO , China will have to make some changes in its economic policies so that it can follow the routines practiced by other TO members . Is it fair to China , do you think ? 
 We can infer that the non-discrimination principle is one of the most important principles of TO agreement . This principle requires equal treatment of domestic and foreign enterprise . Does the principle also apply to domestic enterprise of different ownerships ? 
 I need help . I think my arm is broken . 
 No , I haven't . I need help quick . It hurts really badly . 
 Let me see a doctor .

 No . Only a little . I fell off my porch . 
 My left arm . 
 No , I can't . I'm left-handed . 
 Yes . But why do I have to fill out a form anyway ? This is the emergency room .

 For starters , we should start doing more outdoor activities . That way we'll get some exercise . 
 That's not a bad idea . How much is it ? 
 Playing tennis twice a week will be a good start . Count me in . 
 I need help finding a new refrigerator .

 thank you for help.good bye . 
 I'd like to change some US dollars into euros and I'd like to know today's exchange rate . 
 Is there any service charge ? 
 400 US dollars . Here it is . Would you please give me small bills ? 
 Why isn't the project done yet ? 
 I'm calling to confirm your booking . 
 You are booked on the A943 on 16/11 at 17:30 pm to Hong Kong with Cathy Pacific . 
 Excuse me , Miss , can you tell me where the bank is ? 
 How long will it take me to get there ? 
 I see.Thank you . 
 Do you take in students ? I've been told you might have a vacant room . 
 How much are you asking ? 
 Could I have a look at it , please ? 
 Waiter , get me rag , please . I have just spilled my wine . 
 Thank you . Please bring me some paper napkins . 
 I think I should be more careful next time . 
 I'd recommend you the Morning Paper , it is true that the paper is a newly issued one , but its circulation is rising . Last month , it reached to three hundred thousand , which is a very good figure for a new paper . 
 I think perhaps the news stories in it are truthful and accurate . It also has a special page about the stock market ; maybe this is the real reason for its popularity . Many people are now speculating in the stock market . 
 What can I do for you , sir ? 
 No problem . May I see your identification ? 
 That's fine ! How would you like this cash back ? 
 Three thousand . Please check it , sir . Thank you and have a good day . 
 May i help you ? 
 Sure , here you are . 
 Yes , the fitting room is over there , it looks fantastic on you , this style color in sizes natural here and figure , perfectly . 
 I think so , but the true thing is you look sharp in any style . 
 Absolutely , i go to there to work three times a week , bend it for 6 month now . 
 Oh , you like the rolling machine . 
 No problem , is this blue ok ? 
 Yes , we do , there is a 90 percent for two . 
 The total is 90 dollars including tax . 
 Yes , we do , debit or credit ? 
 Please keen your key number here , do you want to any extra cash back ? 
 Have a good day . 
 Great , take care . 
 Would you please teach me how to use the computer ? 
 Do I have to turn on the computer ? 
 What should I learn first ? 
 I am ready I am going to get , let's start ! 
 Sure . What do you need ? 
 Well , first you have to turn this switch on . 
 Now press this button . 
 Just a second . I ’ ll go get some . 
 Why do you think so ? 
 How do you sleep ? 
 Are you worried about anything ? 
 Well , there's nothing much wrong with you . You're under too much pressure . 
 Let me see . A roasted duck is $ 25 . A plate of pork is $ 6.50 . A bowl of beef is $ 7 . Two bottles of beer are $ 4 . That's a total of $ 42.50 . 
 Oh , sorry sir . We take no tips here . Thank you all the same . 
 Yes , I ’ ll have the Texas chili burger . 
 A large , with tons of ketchup . 
 I ’ ll have a diet coke , please . 
 Take-out , please . 
 It is a large-scale business , which has more than two thousand staff . 
 There are over 20 subsidiaries around the world . 
 Which ad would that be ? 
 Good , which job is that ? We advertised several openings . 
 Yes , it is . But we'll be making a decision on it pretty soon . Why don't you come in and fill out an application ? 
 We can discuss that when you come in and fill out the application . 
 I'm afraid I can't discuss that over the phone . 
 We're an Employment Agency . 
 Are there many accidents in the city every day ? 
 Please drive slowly , we've got lots of time . Safety first . 
 Hi , yes , I have a reservation . My secretary called and booked a room a couple of weeks ago , the reservation should be for a double bed , none smoking room . 
 It should be under Steve Johnson . 
 No , here is the confirmation number , would that help ? It is 898007 , I had the room booked with a visa cord card . 
 May I help you , madam ? 
 Follow me , please . Here it is . What do you want ? 
 OK . Wait a second , please . 
 Yes , of course . 
 Anything else ? 
 May I help you ? 
 Here we can exchange HAD , USD and Euros . Which do you require ? 
 At the moment it's 830.43 RIB for 100 USD , which is a pretty good rate . 
 Now , Miss Childs passed on your resume to me and I ’ Ve had the chance to look it over and I must say I ’ m quite impressed . 
 Well yes , I do have a number of questions , but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview I ’ d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background . 
 Ah I see , so you were actually educated in Europe ? 
 Very interesting . So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood . 
 I see . Okay , well let ’ s move on to discuss your education shall we ? 
 Anything else ? 
 Our employees receive 15 days of paid vacation every year . If you don't use the full 15 days , they carry over to the following year . 
 You get 5 paid sick days . 
 Yes , we have an excellent retirement plan and medical insurance as well . 
 We'll contact you soon , Tom . Thanks for coming in . 
 Honey , you really forgot about it ? Think it over . It's a candlelight dinner . 
 It's our wedding anniversary , honey . How can you forget about it ? 
 Of course . I almost missed my own wedding . 
 Oh , really ! It looks so different . Our old place turns into a brand new place . 
 I can never forget that . I bought you five candies , but I was so anxious that I forgot to give them to you . You didn't get them until we parted . Then they had already melted down for I held them the whole time . 
 You are the one I should thank . You've done really great job . 
 I'm sorry . The agreement hasn't been fully prepared . It will be ready by tomorrow . 
 I will try my best . Here is the draft . Would you please go over it and see if any modifications are needed ? 
 How about the terms concerning packing ? 
 If you totally agree , I'll type the agreement this evening and have it duplicated for signatures . 
 Welcome to Perfect Getaway Tours . How can I help you ? 
 Very well , we have a couple of different options such as beaches , the wilderness , the countryside or even going to a spa for the weekend . 
 Perfect ! This package includes round-trip flights to New Hampshire . A free airport pick-up is included . Our VIP limousine will pick you up and provide you with complimentary champagne and finger foods to soften the thirty-minute ride to the countryside . 
 That is the best part . Your hotel is actually an old country villa that has been restored and refurbished to accommodate a maximum of that is guests . You will enjoy an intimate and private time in this very spacious and warm N Included in the price is three meals a day , excluding beverages . You can choose to eat at the fabulous restaurant that offers a stunning view of the lush , green gardens . If you prefer , your own private butler can arrange your meal to be served in your room or outside on our terrace . 
 Of course ! The hotel has a stable with beautiful stallions for a very romantic horseback ride along the country trail . You can also go fishing to the nearby lake or visit the local vineyard . 
 Now let's use the weight machines . 
 Great . They've all got built-in TVs . 
 But we could just stay there for 20 minutes . 
 I would recommend doing some squats . Spread your feet about shoulder-length apart , toes facing forward , and slowly bend at your knees . 
 Keep your back straight and look forward . Good . Do about 3 sets of 20 . 
 Sure , which one ? The red one or the blue one ? 
 You may keep it for the time being . I'm not using it now . 
 Sure . May I see your receipt ? 
 That's right . Try it on . 
 Really ? Let me see . 
 Ok , maybe we can order a soup and a salad from the restaurant down the street . 
 You eat too much junk food . That sort of stuff clogs up your arteries and is very high in cholesterol . 
 It's not only about getting fat or not , it's about being healthy . You could really have some health problems later on . 
 You are a lost cause . 
 I'm trying to send the instruction book by E-mail , but I failed many , many times . And there is something wrong with the net maybe . It's so slow . 
 I am used to editing with Word 2003 , and there are many pictures in the book . 
 I merely know how to send the direct letter . But I am not familiar with the attachment . 
 Can I mail the book if it is a large file ? 
 What if it exceeds the capacity ? 
 What was your duty like in your previous job ? 
 Can you name a few examples ? 
 I have no idea what to buy for Mary for her birthday . 
 Yes , that would be good ! 
 If I remember right , she likes music , skiing , and reading . 
 Her roommate , Malia , might know what her favorite groups are . 
 Let's give Malia a call and ask her for her help right now . 
 When should I make my presence known ? 
 Hello , Mr . Thomas . Could you spare a minute ? 
 I need to talk to you about that new driver you ’ Ve hired . I think I am going to have some problems working with him . 
 Excuse me , when is the next train to Los Angeles ? 
 Can I get the ticket here ? 
 Thank you . 
 Good for you . Did you use Paypal ? 
 That's the beauty of it , and the danger . 
 How much ? 
 Mmmm , sounds like risky business . Good luck . 
 Thank you . 
 Certainly . ( He brings her the sauce ) Here you are . Can get you anything else ? 
 Front Desk . 
 Yes , what time would you like a wake-up call ? 
 We've been discussing the project for two hours . Let's take a break . 
 Sam , can we stop at this bicycle shop ? 
 Yes , and they have a sale on now . 
 I left it at my parent's house , but I need one here as well . I've been using Jim's old bike but he needs it back . 
 Look at this mountain bike . It is only £ 330 . Do you like it ? 
 How much is it ? 
 OK , let's go and ask . 
 Here you go . 
 Thank you . 
 Oops ! I forgot . 
 I think I'll put my bag in the overhead compartment . 
 Yeah , I ’ Ve just moved here , and I ’ d like to activate my cell phone , and I ’ m not sure if I should go with a prepaid plan , or a monthly rate plan . 
 What ? Really ? I don ’ t really want to have to buy a new phone . 
 Really ? What ’ s the catch ? 
 So what does this plan include ? 
 Wow , all this for forty dollars per month ? 
 Here we are this is my favorite place . 
 I've never counted . 
 Please be seated . It's my treat today . 
 It's so busy here . 
 What would you like to eat ? 
 Want something to drink ? 
 My TV hasn't got a clear picture recently.How ' s yours ? 
 I think something is wrong with mine . 
 What can I do for you , sir ? 
 Do you want to have a tub bath , surfing bath or shower ? 
 All right . The fitting room is over there . 
 $ 100 . But we will charge you $ 200 as a deposit . 
 Yeah , most of them have arrived . Don't worry . There are still 20 minutes left before the match . 
 Of course . It's a newly-built one . 
 Hurry up , Benjamin ! Pass the ball to me . I'm good at shooting . 
 Oh , God ! I didn't touch anybody . How can I commit a foul ? 
 Yes , I got it . Come on , Benjamin , don't let him get into the paint . 
 Really ? You must be ... 
 That's interesting . Let's hurry up , we should beat them in the first half . 
 He may be injured . Yes , come on , call the team doctor . 
 I need a hat . Would you show me some ? 
 I like the black one . May I try it on ? 
 Yes , I thinks so . How much is it ? 
 Can you make it much cheaper ? 
 What's for dinner ? 
 What ? Leftovers of what and from when ? 
 Isn't that dangerous though ? I mean bacteria and germs reproducing on food that was left out or re-heated ? 
 Well OK , I am just afraid of getting food poisoning . 
 Mrs . Phoebe , let's talk about the delivery arrangement for our goods . 
 I informed my company and was told that the first five thousand by the end of this month . 
 We can deliver the balance at the price already quoted in 10 days . 
 I am afraid we can not do that . Would you be willing to sign an annual contract on the basis we discussed ? 
 Of course . Well , in that case we could offer a 5 % discount for a confirmed monthly order for the next 12 months . 
 I'm afraid that's as far as we could go . We'd already be stretching ourselves to the limit . 
 Good afternoon , what can I do for you today ? 
 That's no problem . We have many different ways to go about getting a mortgage and all with terms to suit you . 
 Well , congratulations ! It's lovely being a newly wed , but also so much pressure . Could you tell me what kind of property you are looking for ? 
 Yes , I see . There are just the two of you at the moment . Please take a look through this brochure ; it's especially for first-time-buyers . I think it'll be very helpful . 
 I really need to go shopping . 
 I need to look for a new bedroom set . 
 I have absolutely no idea . 
 No , I'm not sure where they sell nice bedroom sets . 
 Yes , because I love yours . 
 Is IKEA affordable ? 
 Welcome to the National Post . How may I help you ? 
 Very well . You will need some stamps for the postcards and I need to weigh that package . 
 Well , it depends . Do you want to send it via priority , express or standard mail ? 
 Well , standard mail can take up to fifteen working days . Priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days . Express is the fastest , but it ’ s also the most expensive . It only takes three days and you can track your package online . 
 Have you anything to declare ? 
 Where did you buy it ? 
 Do you travel a lot ? 
 Twice a year ? How long has your sister lived in Boston ? 
 I see , that's a long time.How much was the watch ? 
 Yes , I'd like to see the receipt.Oh ! I see you bough the watch last week . 
 Yes , I'm afraid you will.Altogether on the watch and the perfume you owe me seven pounds . 
 Yes , that's fine . I hope you enjoyed your stay in Boston ? 
 How ’ s it going ? 
 What did you need ? 
 How much money would you like to withdraw ? 
 Which account are you making this withdrawal from ? 
 All right , here is your $ 300 . 
 Is there anything else that I can do for you today ? 
 Welcome to IBA . What can we do for you today ? 
 I see . That shouldn't be a problem , Sir . Which currency would you require ? 
 The first step is to fill in the Account Opening Application and the accompanying Seal Card , stamped with your company's seal . I mean , the business seal and the corporate seal . We also need your Business Licence and the Enterprise Standard Code Certificate . Then we can go on to the next step . 
 Stewardess ! 
 May I have a magazine or a newspaper please ? 
 I'd like sports , please . 
 Oh ! I read this before . May I have another one instead please ? 
 I know and they are really nice , too . 
 Me , too . 
 Good idea , especially at this price . 
 You ’ re right . 
 I should have turned it off . I ’ ll turn it off now . 
 I ’ m sorry , Jim . 
 Can you put me through to May Flower Restaurant , please ? 
 OK , I ’ ll try later . Thanks anyway . 
 What does your company do exactly ? 
 And who do you sell to ? 
 One Grand Slam breakfast for you ! 
 Thank you for pointing that out . I mistakenly gave you your friend's breakfast . 
 A special order of banana pancakes for you ! 
 I am so sorry , madam ! 
 I will go trade those pancakes for waffles right now . 
 Let's start the interview with some questions . Tell me about yourself and your past experience . 
 What finance experience have you had that qualifies you for this position ? 
 Why did you leave your last position ? 
 What are your strengths and weaknesses ? 
 How would your boss describe you and your work style ? 
 What are your salary expectations ? 
 Do you have any questions ? 
 I beg your pardon ? 
 That's very nice of you . I guess I could use some help . 
 Are you ready , Pa ? 
 No . 
 In China at least , coffee is often associated with an exotic , well-to-do bourgeois lifestyle . Coffee is often considered a hobby of the well-educated , middle-class people . 
 Yes . Behind a lifestyle , there is a culture . Young people easily become blind worshippers of a Westernized life . While they may not really like coffee , they think it desirable and enviable to be lavish with money in those high-consumption places . 
 Well . Tea represents another facet of popular culture . While a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft , elegant music , a teahouse is often a noisy , crowded , public space . People visit teahouses to associate with others , playing chess , chatting , or simply listening to operas . 
 Well , that's true . In a sense , it is not so much what you drink that really counts , as where and how you drink . 
 That sounds fantabulous . I have dreamed of going there for months . 
 Sure . I don't want to waste even a minute . 
 Hi there . I need to change some dollars into local currency . Can I do that here ? 
 Well , that depends . What's the rate like today ? 
 That sounds pretty good . OK , I'll change 500 USD today , thanks . 
 Several minutes . 
 Then , pass me a bowl for the soup . 
 Look for it yourself , please ! Kinda busy here , Daniel ! 
 Check the drawer . 
 Can it hold soup ? 
 It smells sweet . Mom and May are gonna love it . Get them for dinner , Daniel ! 
 Hello ! Where can I buy an inexpensive cashmere sweater ? 
 That is a wonderful idea . 
 Thank you for your help . 
 This is what my boss is expecting , Sandy . He wants a detailed list of expenses and equipment costs . 
 The sooner , the better , Sandy . I don ’ t think he ’ ll sign anything till he ’ s got that in his hands . 
 OK , so now the last point on our agenda . Jill , let's go over the profit and loss statement . 
 Let ’ s see ... These numbers are off the charts ! What's going on here ! 
 OK , thank you . I ’ ll look into it . 
 Thank you.that will be all . I ’ ll take care of it . 
 OK , I get it ! ! Thank you for your very thorough analysis ! 
 Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll open the window . 
 Smoking is harmful for your health . 
 I wonder what we should have for dinner this evening . 
 Yes , I am . I really don't feel much like cooking , but the family must eat . 
 So I've noticed . You're putting on a little weight , aren't you ? 
 It's about time . 
 Here you are . 
 I'm sure you'll look grand when it's done.Would you like to have a shampoo after a while ? 
 How about oil or spray ? 
 Ow ! 
 I slipped and fell downstairs . 
 Yes , I have . I think that I've hurt my back . 
 I'm sorry , Lucy . I'm afraid that I can't get up . 
 I really need to apply for a driving permit . 
 I may have left my ID in my car . 
 I'll go get it really quick . 
 Here it is . 
 I need to use a pen . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Good afternoon . Lotus Catering Company . Lilian speaking . May I help you ? 
 I see , Mr . Baker . How many people are you planning to invite and how much would you like to spend per person ? 
 Hi , are you being helped ? 
 All our scarves are in this section . What do you think of this one here ? It's made of silk . 
 Maybe you would like a heavy wool scarves . How about this one ? 
 It's 75 dollars plus tax . 
 Since you like it so much , how about a 10 % discount ? That's the best I can offer . 
 Sure . Is there anything else I can get for you ? 
 Hello ! Is your taxi engaged ? 
 Please take me to the Honging Hotel . 
 Could you get there in twenty minutes ? 
 I am in a hurry . Please take a shortcut . I have a friend waiting for me . 
 Thanks . 
 Yes , Mr . Emory . Thank you . 
 We ’ re planning a June wedding , but we haven ’ t picked a date yet . 
 This is Rick Allen speaking . Can I help you ? 
 We have thought of you very carefully , but the other candidate has more experience . 
 Of course , I think so . But how can you prove to me that you are more capable ? 
 That ’ s a good idea . 
 Yes , I would . 
 It's sapphire . We have only one brooch of this type . Will you try it on ? 
 Only 700 yuan . 
 How about this one ? This is 500 yuan and the same kind of material as that one . 
 Oh , yes . Any kind of goods are dependable as our shop is well-known throughout the city . 
 Yes . What can I do for you ? 
 All right . Have you got an idea about what type to buy ? 
 Can you remember them all ? 
 Mum , pass me some more please ! 
 But the ads say they're most nutritious . 
 Have you got the medicine yet ? 
 Well , these are for internal use.You take a packet each time.Four times a day . 
 They're painkillers.You take one tablet when you feel a pain , but not more than once within four hours . 
 Do you know our major business ? 
 Do you have a long-term plan for your career ? 
 Hello , this is Julie from Google Corp . Is that Jin Lili ? 
 I am calling to impart the news that you are supposed to have an interview . 
 I said that you are supposed to have an interview . 
 I'd like to mail this letter to Taipei . 
 Taiwan . 
 Okay . Can I also have a sheet of 20 sixty-four-cent stamps ? 
 By the way , how much does it cost to send a package to Taiwan ? 
 I see . 
 Pardon me ? 
 Oh , I see . I'll have a beer please 
 Thank you . How much is it ? 
 Are you sure ? Then I'd love more beer please 
 Are you finished ? 
 Oh , sure . I'll be back in a minute . 
 That would be wonderful . 
 The rent is $ 1050 every month . 
 What is good for you ? 
 That ’ s not high enough . 
 I can let it go at $ 900 a month . 
 I can live with that too . 
 Sure . What do you fancy ? 
 Sir , the filet mignon was so popular tonight that we ran out . May I suggest the porterhouse ? 
 Perhaps you would like chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ? 
 Okay . This will be charged to your amenities account , okay ? 
 Your food will be brought to you momentarily . I hope you enjoy it . 
 Be relaxed . She is familiar with the area . 
 Ok , I'll go out and look for her . 
 This is room 504.The room is so cold . 
 Yes.of course . I turned it on half an hour ago . I don't think it work at all . 
 Good afternoon , sir . Gan I help you ? 
 Which brand are you interested in ? 
 Do you prefer imported ones or domestic ones ? 
 How about Flymo ? It's selling well . 
 Of course . The warranty period is one year . 
 Sure . But you must show us the receipt . If something comes up , we'll change it for you . 
 Could I get some beef ? 
 Ground beef would be fine . 
 Four pounds is enough . 
 I'm going to need extra lean ground beef . 
 Thanks so much . 
 Thanks for everything . 
 If you tell me the exact problem , I can be more helpful . 
 Allow me to apologize . I'll give you another room right now , and a full refund for tonight . 
 Sir , only your mother wants to please you more than we do . 
 What problems are you having exactly ? 
 That is high . 
 But your promotional materials claim the broads are the least expensive of their types on the market . 
 That will involve additional expenses for us , which we will have to pass on to you as a rate hike . 
 Well . I will tell you what , Mr . Li . I will review the contract and talk with management . Then we will get together and hash this out . 
 Mmm ... to be honest , I ’ d rather go for a pizza . 
 Ok , shall we go to Pizza Hut or Pizza Italia ? 
 I think you ’ re absolutely right . Ok , that ’ s decided then ! 
 Is this the right counter to check in for this flight ? 
 OK . Is the plane on schedule ? 
 Two . 
 That ’ s it , my lease is up . I have to move . 
 The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot . 
 I think I might move in with my parents for a couple of months until I can find something . You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here . I ’ m gonna have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while . 
 Actually , would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks ? 
 I'm sorry , but I don't think so . 
 Well , there's a department store on Grant Street . There are restrooms in the basement . 
 Between Second and Third Streets . The store is across from the hotel . 
 You're welcome . 
 Work is work , whether it ’ s a part-time or temporary job or a full-time gig . 
 All you need to do is fill in the blanks correctly on the Continued Claim Form , and the EDD Office will take care of the rest . 
 It is to your advantage to work as much as you can . 
 Yes , it is . What about it ? 
 I see . 
 Where did you hit it ? 
 Oh , Yes , I see it now . 
 Can I see your passbook and with your draft please ? 
 Let me just make sure . You want to withdraw one thousand dollars . 
 Excuse me , ma'am , can I help you find anything ? 
 What size do you wear ? 
 How about this pair ? 
 How about these ? 
 Well , there's this pair . 
 Which university did you graduate from ? 
 What subject did you major in at university ? 
 Tell me about the courses of your major in university . 
 How did you get on with your studies in university ? 
 What subject did you minor in ? 
 Janice , the president of our company , Mr Smith , will invite two programmers to give us a lecture this afternoon . Are all the members notified ? 
 Is the room ready for the lecture now ? 
 Excellent . How about the microphone and speaker ? 
 Write up the official notice in duplicate . Do not forget to put name cards and pens on the tables for our guests . 
 How would you seat them ? 
 Well , after the half of the meeting , there will be an interval for rest and refreshment . 
 It depends on the type of the house you're looking for . 
 What ’ s your general price range ? 
 Umm , I think I would be hard to find something in that range in this area . You know the environment in the south mountain district is the nicest . 
 A two-bedroom house in this area is generally around 250,000 RIB . 
 I recommend you buy a two-bedroom house . It is very suitable for a couple , and some two-bedroom houses are large enough for a one-child family . 
 Look at the traffic . It ’ s terrible ! 
 I agree . It makes it difficult to breathe . 
 Good morning , can I help you ? 
 Yes , of course sir . What's your name and your room number , PLS ? 
 Ok , here is your bill , Mr . Remington . 
 Oh , I am sorry sir . I forgot to explain that to you . This one is an allowance slip . We made a mistake in your bill and overcharged you 120 dollars . So we had to write up an allowance slip and deduct 120 dollars from your bill . 
 Down here , 800 dollars . How do you wish to settle your account , sir , in cash or by credit card ? 
 Is that US dollars ? 
 Just a moment , PLS . I'll write out a receipt for you . 
 I am Tim Green in Room 1021 and I want a wake-up call at five thirty AM tomorrow . 
 I want to change my wake-up time . 
 Tim , in Room 1021 . 
 At six thirty AM tomorrow . 
 Merry Christmas ! Let ’ s paint the town red . 
 What do you think of the apartment ? 
 What problem is that ? 
 I don ’ t understand what the big deal is . 
 What you would like me to do about it ? 
 I won ’ t be able to fix it at the moment . 
 If that ’ s the case , then I will fix the faucet . 
 Hello , are you Muriel Douglas ? 
 Yes , you too . Thanks for agreeing to meet with us about the new account . My associate , Susan Kim , should be here any minute . Would you like something to drink while we're waiting ? 
 Yes , I did . My family and I went to Tahoe to ski and the weather was great . How about you ? 
 How did you like it ? 
 No , not much . My wife doesn't like to ski . She prefers vacationing where it's warmer , like Hawaii . 
 Yes , me too . Oh , here's Susan now . Let me introduce you . 
 Oh , it is my cell phone ringing . I set it in the vibration mode . 
 You are right . Some ring tone is just terribly loud . You can hear it even in the next door . It is really a kind of distraction . 
 Good idea . 
 Hi , Kathy ! I'm just doing my morning yoga ! You're up awfully early today . 
 How has school been going ? You come home so late every night ! You're really a hard worker ... 
 What are you going to have for breakfast ? 
 You're supposed to always have a hearty breakfast . 
 It's easy to make a quick breakfast . 
 When I need to make a quick breakfast , I just make some oatmeal , toast , and OJ . 
 It's not time consuming at all . 
 Would you like me to make something ? 
 I'm looking for some blush . Do you still have some in peach rose ? 
 Great , I'll take one . 
 Wow , that sounds like a bargain . I'm running low on facial moisturizer and toner . Could you ring those up for me too along with the blush ? 
 Oh , I almost forgot . It's my mum's birthday Saturday . I need to get her some more Chanel . Could you get me the 1.7 ounce bottle of Chanel cologne ? 
 Hello , Mr Brown . I'm glad you came in today ; we've just opened a new service that you might be interested in . It's called Bank Securities Link . 
 It's actually a Deposit Account that links to your Margin Account , the one you have with the Securities Company . You can transfer the money you have in your account into your Fund Account . 
 You can use your Deposit Book or your Credit Card . And of course , you can use our e-banking . 
 Good morning . Could you tell me the times of trains to London , please ? 
 What time does the 7:59 get to London ? 
 What about coming back ? I'd like to come back about 7 p . m . 
 Mmm , how much is it ? 
 Return , please . 
 An ordinary return , please . 
 You bought a compact car ? 
 Let me guess , from Sarah . It looks like something she would drive . 
 I love it . It's so festive ! And where did you get that cup ? It's got the same logo as the car . 
 Half past 11 . 
 No , it's an express . 
 Hello , back already ? That was quick ! 
 Great . I shall also need a copy of your own ID and the Warrant Letter , you can fill in one here . 
 Next time , you can get one from the counter over there . Or before you come in , you can download one from our website . It's really easy . 
 I don't know yet . What's your idea , Dad ? 
 Dad ! It's cold now ! 
 Welcome to ABC electronics . First , let me go over what we do in the department during a typical workday . 
 That ’ s right , although we do expect you to do a little overtime if there ’ s something important to do . The lunch break is flexible . You can go a little earlier or a little later if you prefer . 
 Of course . The main thing is that all our work must be completed on schedule . We even allow our employee to go home early if they finish their work early . 
 You should attend a department meeting every Monday morning . There are other meetings for people working together on certain projects.Department heads also attend an interdepartmental meeting each wee 
 You are entitled to a company car . Have you seen it yet ? 
 Ok . This is your cubicle . At first , you ’ ll be responsible to me . Later , you ’ ll be working more independently . 
 That ’ s right . Make sure you give the accounts department all your bank account details as soon as possible . 
 Yes , I did indeed . But , could you tell me what exactly the ' Priority Service Room ' is used for ? 
 I think of myself as a valued customer . What services can you offer me ? 
 Right . Is there anything else that can be done there ? 
 The list goes on and on ! 
 So , I can talk to my Personal Banker 24/7 . That's really thoughtful of you . And I have to say , I love the new look of the bank . 
 I'd rather say it's confusing . what are those ' strict nutrition philosophies ' about ? 
 Probably , Rose . That must be the job of nutritionists . 
 Oh , believe it or not , I came across an article the other day , saying that pizza is a healthy food . 
 Yes , I felt exactly the same way as you did just now . Scientists must be crazy in saying so . 
 Absolutely right . I myself sometimes believe that healthy eating is just about feeling great . As long as I have enough energy , it's fine . 
 What do you think of the test ? 
 It wasn't too bad . Were you nervous ? 
 Oh , I wouldn't worry about it . 
 No , I wouldn't worry about you . 
 It seems to me that you always do better than you say . 
 The Grand Hotel . 
 Yes . Do you know where it is ? 
 It's the 11th Avenue , Park Street . 
 Do you take in students ? 
 How much is it ? 
 Do you think I could have a look at it , please . 
 May I try this on ? 
 What material is it made of ? 
 That's good.Cotton is soft and flexible . 
 Your price is rather out of line , much higher than we expected . We can't buy with your offer . 
 When we say your prices are much too high , we don't mean the are higher only by 2 or 3 percent . If we are to place an order with you . I think a discount of about 15 % would be sufficient . 
 There's no point in making a counter offer because the gap is too great . 
 Ok . I can settle for that . 
 Yes . I believe you have a luncheon meeting this coming Wednesday.Could you give me some more information about that ? 
 Mmm , that sounds very interesting . 
 Yes , I think even though we are adults , it's still a good place for us to relax . 
 I want some exciting . Which is more fun , the roller coaster or the ferris wheel ? 
 Come on . Here is for enjoying and exciting . 
 I like ferris wheel more . 
 OK , let's go . 
 I strongly urge you to change your diet.You shouldn't eat too many desserts . 
 You should go to the dentist . 
 Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist . 
 Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out . 
 Good . You will feel better after you do . 
 Yes , we've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery . And they are all newly renovated . 
 No problem . We have a nice apartment located near the Oriental Square . It's perfect for people busy with office work . It is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details . 
 Ah ! I get your point . We have just what you need . Our Jinyuan apartments have several floor plans . The one bedroom apartments are very economical , but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space . I think you can find the right apartment there . 
 Of course . It's just at 19 Lingual Road . You can phone me again if you cann't find the right place . 
 Can you offer me something a little cheaper ? 
 I want to stay under $ 20 . 
 How many foreign languages can you speak ? 
 What do you think of your English ? 
 Can you speak English fluently ? 
 Did you take TOEFL or GRE ? 
 When did you begin to learn English ? 
 Do you think your English is good enough to do office work ? 
 Here ' s my passport . I'm a visiting scholar . 
 No , these are all my personal effects . 
 Not at all . I don't know what's dutiable.Do I have to pay duty on things for my own use ? 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , what sort of warranty comes with this stereo ? 
 What conditions are there on the store policy ? 
 O . K . How do I get the manufacturer ’ s warranty ? 
 All right , those sound good . I ’ ll take it . 
 Hurry up , guys ! The train is about to leave . 
 Can you make a suit for me to order ? 
 By the way , what's the charge for the tailoring ? 
 Hi , I ’ d like to have my phone turned on , please .

 OK . 
 Thank you . 
 Is this where I get off ? 
 Hello , may I help you ? 
 Photograph or document ? 
 Show me your document , please . 
 Ah , it is clear enough to send . 
 It'll only take a couple of minutes . 
 Twenty yuan . 
 Don't drive too fast . 
 Be careful.It ' s dangerous to drive fast . 
 I'm afraid I'm going to the gym for a workout . 
 I began to went there last month . 
 Well , I think I'm in better condition now . 
 It was at the beginning . You just need to keep it up . 
 Of course , yes . 
 You are welcome , Mr . Sun . 
 You certainly made a good impression on me as well . 
 We'll be making the decision by the end of this week and we'll contact you as soon as possible . 
 I ’ m in the middle of something right now . I ’ ll be there in a second . 
 Alright , alright . I ’ m coming . 
 You know what , I have to pick something up at the mall , so why don ’ t you clean the floors and I'll go to the supermarket and get all the groceries . 
 Hey , honey I ’ m back . Wow , the house looks really good ! 
 Just a sec I ’ m just gonna vacuum this rug real fast . 
 I'd like to have a berth ticket to Shanghai . 
 The 19:00 train . 
 When is the next train to Shanghai ? 
 How much is the ticket ? 
 Here is 200 yuan . 
 Look , Bob hasn't made any progress on that project . 
 We should have a word with him . 
 Hello , this is Shogun Restaurant . 
 Can you tell me what night you will be coming ? 
 What time will you be dining with us ? 
 How many guests will be in your party ? 
 Please just give me your name , and at 7 
 Thank you , Mr . Foster , see you this Tuesday at 7 
 How much can I change 100 dollars for ? 
 How much will it be in Chinese currency ? 
 When can I get high speed internet installed ? 
 Can I make one right now ? 
 I'm off this Friday . 
 I'm going to need it installed earlier than that . 
 Is Saturday any better ? 
 Is 11 
 May I speak to Marry ? 
 Will it be too late if I call around ten this evening ? 
 I want to leave home , mum . 
 I am a grown-up , and I can stand on my own two feet . 
 I want a refund ! 
 These pajamas don't fit right . They're too long . 
 No . I want my money back . 
 Fine . Here's my receipt . I'd better be able to use this anywhere in the store . 
 Mr . Drake , I'm pleased to do business with your company . 
 Your company is very well respected . About how long have you been in business ? 
 And this is your company's head office ? 
 That's wonderful . Isn't your company part of ARE Corporation ? 
 That's not bad . How long have you been in PR ? 
 What do you want to be ? 
 Oh , honey , but you must know what your hobby is , right ? 
 Yes , you play the piano well . You could be a good pianist . That's good . 
 Look at the icon in the bottom corner of your screen . Is it flashing ? 
 OK . Try closing down all the files you're not using at the moment . 
 Have you tried pressing the Escape key ? 
 OK , you ’ ll need to reboot your machine . Press Control , Alt and Delete at the same time . 
 You might lose the file you were working on , but don't worry , the help desk can restore it . When did you last take a backup ? 
 I am . 
 Fine , thanks . 
 Don't make it too short . I just want a trim . 
 Yes , I do.That looks good . It's not too short.It ' s just right . How much do I owe you ? 
 Here is 4 dollars , keep the change . 
 Where do you think we should go on holiday this summer ? 
 I ’ d really like to go to the Caribbean . We can relax on the beached and enjoy the sunshine . 
 But would it be relaxing ? By summer . I ’ ll be quite tired from doing so much work . The last thing I need is to use more energy racing around Australia . I ’ d need another holiday to recover from the holiday ! 
 Do you think so ? I ’ m not so sure . Anyway , tell me your plans for an Australian holiday . How long do you think we should spend there ? 
 That doesn ’ t sound too bad . I ’ d certainly like to go diving . That ’ s one reason I wanted to go to the Caribbean . 
 We ’ d have to plan our drive before we leave . Let ’ s get a good guidebook from the bookstore when we go shopping in town tomorrow . 
 Hello , is that the Peace Restaurant ? 
 Yes . I'd like a table for six at 7:00 this evening . Can you arrange it for us ? 
 Let me see . It seems a little late . 
 OK . I'll change the time to 8: 00 . 
 It's John . 
 Hello . Is Becky there , please ? 
 Thanks . 
 That ’ s okay . I ’ ll call back later . 
 I didn't really like it all that much . 
 Well , they are pretty new . I just didn't feel that they were ready to open yet . 
 The food wasn't all that exciting . 
 Yes , the service certainly didn't add to the experience . 
 Maybe we could try it again in a few months when things have settled down . 
 The doctor has examined your current situation . Since you are recovering so well , you will be discharged tomorrow . 
 First please get the bill at the doctor's office , then pay it either with cash or by check . Even though you're discharged , you still need to take a rest at home . Don't hurry back to work until you have fully recovered . 
 What's it made of , could you tell me ? 
 Can it wear well and keep its shape ? 
 Bob , can I talk to you for a minute ? There have been some developments for the Stewart case that I really need to talk to you about . 
 Well , I'm afraid there is . I have some bad news for you about the results of the forensic tests ... there won't be any results . 
 I hate to tell you this , but it seems that every shred of evidence that would help us to convict were destroyed in a laboratory fire . There's nothing left . I'm so sorry ... 
 There's nothing that can be done . Everything is gone . I wish I could tell you differently , but what has happened has happened . We will just have to figure out a way to move on . 
 Just name it , sir . 
 Regrettably , we're currently out of filet mignon . May I suggest the porterhouse instead ? 
 Would you be interested in chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ? 
 Okay , no strawberries tonight . The items will be charged to your amenities account . 
 Our staff will bring you your order in as short a time as possible . 
 She is my dog . I like her very much . 
 Her name is Fluffy . She is a sweet dog . 
 But I don ’ t like big strong dogs . 
 Of course ! Where are the things ? 
 Right ! I'll do it straight away . 
 Well , I ’ m glad I had a chance to see these samples , but I ’ m really not in a position to make a decision right now . 
 Yeah , why don ’ t you do that , and then you can give me a call sometime next week . 
 I will take the coat . Do you receive checks ? 
 Here you are . Please give me a receipt . 
 OK , please wrap it for me first . 
 Generally speaking , you are supposed to come at 9:00 am . 
 You should start from 1:30 pm in the afternoon . 
 Yes , but dinner was excellent 
 No , thank you . Check please . 
 Here is the two dollars , will you bring me the receipt ? 
 Please keep the change . 
 good morning . What seems to be the problem ? 
 I ’ d say you ’ Ve been working too hard or are under stress for some reason . Have you been taking anything for your cold ? 
 good . I ’ m going to prescribe something stronger . It will make you feel drowsy , so you certainly should rest . 
 have you been working hard recently ? 
 good . Let ’ s take a look at that rash ... it looks worse than it is . I ’ m going to prescribe some ointment for it . If the rash doesn ’ t clear up in a few days , come back and see me . Do you have any other Sy 
 don ’ t worry about that . It ’ s probably of the stress you ’ Ve been under . Just take some aspirin . Combined with the stronger cough medicine , it will make you feel very tired . You shouldn ’ t work or use an 
 Excuse me . How much for a two liter bottle of Coke ? 
 How come so cheap ? 
 I ’ ll take one . And here is a dollar . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Never . But I have been looking forward to it for quite a long time . 
 It's 2065 meters . Come on . Let us keep up the pace . 
 Let me check , sir . You were charged for watching ' Titanic ' Monday night . 
 Okay , sir , bear with me a moment . 
 One slight problem , sir . I need to charge you $ 2 to remove this error from your file . 
 I feel your pain , sir . 
 I agree with you , sir , but all I do is work here . 
 Well , I'll consider the possibility . By the way , when do I open the L / C if I want the goods to be delivered in June ? 
 Could you possibly effect shipment more promptly ? 
 Very well , Mrs.Wang . I'll not reduce my order . I'll take the full quantity you offer . And I'll arrange for the Letter of Credit to be opened in your favor as soon as I get home . 
 Early next week . In the meantime , I should be very pleased if you would get everything ready . I hope that the goods can dispatched promptly after you get my Letter of Credit . 
 That'll be fine . I appreciate your cooperation . 
 By the way , Mrs . Wang , we have a mind to do joint participation with you on Japanese arts and crafts in our market . Would you entertain this proposal ? 
 If you feel our proposal is attractive , it is estimated that business to the extent of over twenty million marks can be done in this manner . 
 All right . Anyway , I'll be staying here for another two weeks . But I'm looking forward to having something done in this respect . 
 Your PC is so amazing . Are you doing trade on internet ? 
 I'm wondering if you often trade with others on the internet . 
 Oh , really ? Is it a good way ? 
 What advantages does it have ? 
 I agree with you . It will cost too much when going abroad to join the exhibition . 
 So cool , if we do business through other ways , it will cost a lot of time . 
 Will you give me some suggestion ? 
 Thank you . Maybe I will do business through internet in the future . 
 Can you break a 100 dollar bill ? 
 No , I'm sorry . That's all I have . Unless you take a credit card . 
 Hi , Mary , I have decided to look for a job as a salesman . 
 Yes . I have found some through different channels . 
 OK . The first piece of job information I got was from the Internet , and it is about selling medicines . 
 I am not familiar with the medicine industry , and I don't think it fits me well . 
 Another is about electronic commerce , and its products are mainly large machinery equipments . 
 I also feel it's nice . I want to give it a try . 
 Thanks . You can also seek job information on the Internet . 
 Do you know how late it is ? 
 I hope you don't think that excuse lets you off the hook . 
 Haven't I asked you to call if you're going to be home late ? 
 Regardless , all you had to do was give a call . 
 Come home late one more time , and you'll find your stuff outside . 
 That's right , maybe then you'll respect my rules . 
 You heard who won the election , didn ’ t you ? 
 I ’ m so happy that he did . 
 Did you vote for him ? 
 Of course I did ! 
 I am , too ! 
 I ’ m sure that he will . 
 I'm searching for an old music box . 
 If you had a box made in the ' 20s , that would be nice . 
 Would any of them have dancing figures ? 
 Oh , they're both so beautiful . Let me have this one , I think . 
 One last question 
 I guess I was asking for too much . 
 How about your study at college ? 
 Why did you select your college ? 
 What do you like doing in your spare time ? 
 May I help you ? Miss ! 
 What color set do you prefer ? 
 We have a beautiful selection of eye shadows this fall . Look at the colors . Aren't they beautiful ? 
 If you insist , I can show you the brown sets . I'll have to warn you that they're very ordinary , though . 
 Why don't you wear purple eye shadow for a change ? We also have lipstick to go with it . 
 Sure . Are you wearing any make-up ? 
 Have a seat , please . Now , here is the mirror . How do you like it ? 
 Try the lipstick as well . See , how fresh and charming you look . 
 Excuse me , can I deposit valuables here ? 
 Here is the bag . Is that free ? 
 For two days . 
 I thought he only liked to listen ! 
 ( Sound of Allen singing ) Hey , Allen has a really good voice ! He sounds like Johnny Dean ! 
 Sorry to bother you . But I ’ m having a small problem I thought you might be able to help me with . 
 Well , it is about Ms . Connors , the landlord of our rented house . 
 The dishwasher broke down . I had the repair done and deducted the cost from the rent check . 
 She is threatening to evict us for not paying the full rent . 
 Well , you are over at the law school . So I wondered if you would mind coming with me when we talk to Ms . Connors . We ’ re supposed to meet with her tomorrow night at eight . 
 Thanks a million , you are a lifesaver . 
 Yes , it is . But I'm afraid we haven't met before . 
 Hello Greg . Yes , that's correct . You see , we have just acquired a new partner , the transaction is huge . It's to be signed next month , and we would really like to have some clearer information about them . 
 That's right . I feel it's always better to go in with both eyes open , if you know what I mean . 
 The lady at the desk , Shelly I think , told me you offer many other consultancy services . 
 That's good to know . Thanks for your help today , I'll leave you with the details and you can get started . 
 OK . What sort of agent , exactly ? 
 OK . I ’ ll make enquiries . 
 Project Management . I was very interested in this course when I was a student . And I think it's very useful for my present work . 
 Yes , I have studied in an English training program and a computer training program since I graduated from university . I am currently studying Finance at a training school . 
 No . We ’ ll get a cab . It ’ s faster than taking the bus or the subway . 
 How much will it cost ? 
 Taxi ! ! ! 
 Yeah . I met with them back in March , remember ? 
 Driver , 1600 Pennsylvania Ave . , please . 
 Of course . Here you are . Can I take your order now ? 
 All right . Can I serve you anything else ? 
 You've got it , sir . 
 I know it is not the cheapest on the market . But if you take the quality factor into consideration , you will find your company will benefit in the long term . This device is built in with the most advanced technology . Every aspect has reached the international standard . It is a worthwhile investment . 
 Well , the best I can do is to lower the price by 5 percent if you are willing to pay 90 % cash of front and 10 % on delivery . That is our best offer . 
 Sure , no problem . 
 It is tough to accept it , I mean . But can you tell me why ? 
 I get it , and thank you for your honesty . 
 For here or to go ? 
 Kevin Belknap . 
 B-E-L-K-N-A-P . 
 Wake up , it's time for school . 
 You have to get up and get ready for school . 
 I can't let you go back to sleep , because you won't wake back up . 
 You still need to eat breakfast , take a shower , and get dressed . 
 I don't want you to be late for school today . 
 Fine , five more minutes . 
 Ah ! No ! Damn it ! 
 So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work . 
 No , I didn't save this time.Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too . 
 I hate computers . Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth . 
 I don't know . I feel like going out . 
 It doesn't matter . I still can go out and buy a beer . 
 Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework.This is a bad time for this to happen . 
 Thanks . I think I will try . Where are you going ? 
 Maybe we can trade.Why don't you stay here and read for my exam , and I'll go drink beer ? 
 So ? You can go to the class for me.Just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . Why not ? 
 About fourteen . 
 Damn ! 
 I'll be happy to get back to you with an estimate in the next few days . 
 Well , I would need an idea of how large your order would be . About how many units would you need ? 
 Please give me a few minute to calculate ... Our asking price should be about $ 100 per unit with an order of 100 . Is that price acceptable to you ? 
 Would an order of only 100 units , it'll be difficult to work within that kind of budget . Maybe if you were ordering 500 units or more units , we might be able to work something out . 
 My pleasure . Release the parking brake , and we're almost ready to go . 
 OK . Relax . This car is an automatic , so you don't have to worry about a clutch . 
 Is there anything I could help you with , sir ? 
 This way , please . 
 These are French coats , sir.They are quite fashionable these days . 
 How does that fit , sir ? 
 It looks good on you . 
 I'd get it myself if I could . 
 Oh honey , I tell you good news . The apartment I looked at today was pretty decent , around 120 square meters . 
 Very quiet and safe . And it ’ s got a lot of trees and plants . 
 Yep , it ’ s near a bus stop . 
 Do you know anything about health food ? 
 Can you give me some examples ? 
 Really ? Why we must have warm and fresh water ? 
 Anything else ? 
 I've read your resume and know a lot of things about your qualifications for this position . One thing you didn't mention is why you left your last job ? I know the company you worked for is a good company . 
 I understand . Why would you like to join our company ? 
 Like what ? 
 that's good to know . Why do you think you ’ re qualified for this position ? 
 Well , this is not quite the style I want . Have you any suit in fashion ? 
 Can I try it on ? 
 This is much better . How much is it ? 
 Of course and very well . 
 Oh , very easy . They are heart , spade , club and diamond . 
 This is the East Market to Central Park bus . Where do you want to go ? 
 Take the same number bus going in the other direction . There's a stop right across the street . 
 I'd like to return this radio . 
 I lost it . 
 But I purchased it yesterday . 
 Well , that's a start , I guess . 
 That sounds good . I'll take the escalator . 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 Yes , It ’ s on the third floor . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 What's this amount for ? 
 I see . Can I pay by credit card ? 
 May I come in ? 
 I'm sorry to trouble you , but I'd like to ask when I will get a raise . 
 You said the same thing three months ago . 
 You mean that I won't get a raise until the recession ends ? 
 I got the message . I'm quiting . 
 I've been here for 3 years , and I haven't had a raise in all that time . If you like my work , it should be reflected in my pay , and I feel it isn't . 
 Very well , consider me gone . 
 I ’ m sorry sir . This computer is not broken or damaged . It ’ s simply just too old ! That ’ s why your programs and applications are running slow . There really isn ’ t much I can do . 
 Yes , but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster ! 
 Well , this desktop over here is our latest model . It has a four gigahertz processor with sixteen gigabytes in RAM and a hard disk with one terabyte . Of course , it includes a mouse , keyboard and desk speakers . 
 This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze ! If it does , we ’ ll give you your money back ! 
 I know . I think it may rain . 
 That would be weird . 
 I know , it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside . 
 I really wish it wasn't so hot every day . 
 I like winter too , but sometimes it gets too cold . 
 Me too . 
 We'd like to look around the town . Can you tell me the best sightseeing route to take ? 
 I think this route is quite interesting . How long does the tour last ? 
 We have the capital ready.Right now I am looking at three different companies to produce our products.And your company , Mr . Chen , seems to me to be the best for what we want . 
 You have some doubts about our products , I understand . 
 Of course . Let me tell you in some detail about our idea.You know the popular Hello Kitty products . 
 Well , the products in themselves are very simple.It is the logo that is successful.So , Hello Kitty is successful because of the logo , but the products are very simple . 
 That might be true.But we have a logo concept that is great . It is really great . I think it will catch on in Taiwan at least . Young people will love it.It is because of our logo that our products will sell.We just need someone to produce the products for us.We have the backup and people to do the marketing . 
 Yes , we would like to make things like key chains , plastic pencil sharpeners , plastic rulers , watches , wallets , things like that.Little accessories for young people . But the reason these will sell is the logo.Just like Hello Kitty . 
 Because it hasn't been copyrighted . We want to get some protection for it.But while we wait for copyright , we are investigating companies to produce the products . 
 I understand . For now , though , you could just give us an estimated price.We aren't going to sign a contract yet . We are just investigating . I only need to know that your company is capable of producing the products.And then , I only need a very rough idea of how much it might cost . 
 Yes . 
 Good morning , I have an appointment with Mr . Wang Li . 
 But Could you tell me when he will be back ? 
 well , do you think I could leave a message for him ? 
 Gongshan Development Co . , Ltd.may I help you ? 
 May I ask who's calling , please ? 
 I'm sorry Mrs wang , but Mrs Fu is not in at the moment . 
 As suppose you reback at 10 
 Of course . 
 Ok , Mrs wang . I'll do that . 
 Tomorrow I will be the new owner of all dad's assets . 
 I know . I miss him terribly . 
 I thought I would feel like I was in the lap of Luxury . 
 No , I think I will run things much the same way that Dad did . 
 Good moming.sir . Here is your breakfast . 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 OK . I will get you some right now . 
 Hi , I need to transfer some money to another account . It ’ s urgent . 
 No . I ’ Ve never made a transfer before . 
 A company account . I need to pay a bill . 
 I have all the information in this folder . 
 Oh , that ’ s such a relief . I didn ’ t want the payment to be overdue . Thank you so much . 
 Excuse me , sir , this is the express check-out lane for people that have fifteen items or fewer . It looks like you have more than fifteen items there . 
 Fine ! Please place your items on the belt and push your shopping cart through . Do you prefer paper or plastic ? 
 No problem , I ’ ll take those . Sir , these coupons expired yesterday . 
 Do you have a club card or will it be cash ? 
 Will this be debit or credit ? 
 Yeah , sure . Your total is seventy-eight dollars and thirty-three cents . Here is your receipt . Have a nice day . 
 ok , what do you want me to do ? 
 ok . I ’ ll put the plates and cutlery away as I dry them . Where is the tea towel ? Oh , here it is . 
 while you ’ re cleaning the cooker , I ’ ll wipe the worktop . That was a great meat , by the way . 
 my pleasure ! This tea towel ’ s a little ragged . Do you have another one ? 
 keep it and use it as rag . You can clean your bicycle with it . 
 To start with I would like something part time with the hope that it can develop into something full time . 
 Yes , that's right . I like this city very much and would like to make my home here . 
 Yes , I did . I have them here . 
 Thank you very much . This should only take me a few minutes . 
 O . K . Let me see . That will be $ 104.99 . 
 Yes , miss , but there is a five percent sales tax in Maryland . 
 No problem . How would you like to pay for these ? 
 $ 110.00 , your change is $ 5.01 . Thanks very much . 
 Tom , how do you think of second-hand goods ? 
 I'm considering buying a second-hand computer for I'm short of money now . 
 But do you really mean that the second - hand goods are just as good as the new ones ? 
 City Bank . This is Tom . May I help you ? 
 Sure , may I have your name and account number please ? 
 I know you , Zina . You're only nice when you want something . 
 To be honest , I'm starting to wonder if it's worth it . 
 You said it , not me . 
 What for ? 
 Oh , yeah ? Are you joking ? 
 Honey , it's good if you spend money to buy more books . But $ 100 dollars a week is enough for you already . 
 OK . But where is my favorite coffee ? 
 It tastes like crankcase oil , but delicious . 
 What is there besides coffee ? 
 Oh , my God . It's nearly eight , I have no time to have breakfast now . My watch says seven fifty . 
 Yes , it was . The clock on the wall says eight to seven . 
 Gee . I could have slept another hour . 
 Well , I can't give you a better warranty , if you would be willing to agree to an annual contract . 
 Yes , our delivery fee could be waived , if you make an order of 50 units or more . We would have to insist on the annual contract , however . I understand it's not the most convenient for you . Perhaps we could shorten it to a sixth month contract if you are willing to take a lower rebate . 
 Right Rebecca . Now I see that after graduating from University your first job was ... 
 Certainly . And after your internship ? 
 Yes I see . But you decided to leave them in 2006 right . 
 The London Weekly right . 
 Wow , you ’ re up early today ! What ’ s for breakfast ? 
 Smells good ! I ’ ll make some coffee . Do you want me to make you some eggs ? 
 Www , I don ’ t know how you can eat your eggs like that ! Ever since I was small , I ’ Ve had eggs and soldiers . 
 You know what really drives me crazy ? When I ask for soft boiled eggs , and they overcook them , so they come out hard boiled ! How can you dip your toast into a hard boiled egg ? 
 Here you go , honey , fried eggs . 
 Let me see your passport , please . 
 You come from Germany , don't you ? 
 How long will you be staying in China ? 
 OK . Have you filled in the Declaration Form ? 
 Is this your luggage ? 
 What do you have in the luggage ? 
 That's all . Thank you for your co-operation . 
 Oh . I don't know what to do . I joined this club a long time ago and I didn't read the fine print . 
 I didn't realize that I have to buy something from them every six months . 
 It's a curio cabinet . The only thing is I don't even own those kinds of little keepsakes . 
 Don't rub it in . Where am I going to put this huge thing ? 
 Yes , Ma'am . Here we are . 
 30 dollars , Ma'am . 
 Yes , but we need some extra charge and some tip too . 
 Ok , Ma'am . Calm down , 15 dollars will do . 
 Hi . My name's David Johnson . I'd like to make an appointment . 
 A checkup . I think I have a bad cavity . Half the side of my head hurts . 
 One of the back ones . 
 Shall we go out tonight ? 
 We'd better ask dad first . 
 Pardon me . I need an old music box . 
 Actually , I was thinking about something from the 1920s . 
 Do any of the boxes have dancing figures ? 
 I love the dancing figures . I'll take this music box . 
 I was wondering , does this come with any kind of warranty ? 
 I was just hoping . 
 I am a reporter from Channel 5 News . 
 Could I ask you some questions ? 
 Did you vote today ? 
 What candidate did you vote for ? 
 Why is that ? 
 I understand . 
 What sort of experience do you have ? 
 Where was your last job ? 
 Why did you quit your last job ? 
 You look a bit under the weather . 
 I know that it ’ s going around the dorms . 
 I have some cold tablets if you would like one . 
 Drinking liquids and getting rest is a good idea with a cold . 
 You could always go to the pharmacy if it gets worse and you want suggestions . 
 I need to see if I qualify for a home loan . 
 I make around one hundred thousand dollars per year . 
 I have only worked at this job for 6 months , but I have a longer job history elsewhere . 
 No , I only receive my salary . 
 I think that it is around 600 . 
 Sorry sir . But you can ’ t go into the OR . 
 It was touching girl for a while . 
 She will be OK . She is a tough cookie . 
 In my opinion she will up about soon . 
 I believe it . Well , I ’ Ve got to go back in . 
 All right . Just relax , OK ? Go and got a cup of coffee . 
 Everything is OK now , doctor . 
 You are welcome , doctor . 
 The total is 87 dollars . Here is the bill . 
 It sounds like Bob's getting out of bed . 
 It was after 2 am . 
 Is this the front desk ? 
 This is Room 705 . The air conditioner in my room doesn't work . 
 And may I have two more towels , please ? 
 Thanks . 
 Didn't you hear about that ? Our meeting was proponed until Friday . 
 Didn't you get the memo ? 
 The memo went out three days ago . It should have made it to your in-box , but maybe it got lost in all the clutter on your desk . 
 It should have gone around to everybody . They also posted a copy of the memo in the break-room . Don't you ever look at the messages posted on the bulletin board ? 
 That's right . You never know what you're missing out if you don't read the memos . 
 With pleasure . 
 I think you are a quick learner . 
 In that case , shall I ask the waiter to bring you a knife and fork ? 
 I would love to rent out your apartment . 
 How much is the rent ? 
 That ’ s a lot of money . 
 What about $ 800 ? 
 I can ’ t pay much more than that . 
 That would be fine . 
 Hello , is this house keeper ? 
 This room 117 , and we have just checked in . 
 Our room hasn't been cleaned up yet.So would you send one of your house keepers to clean up our room . 
 Our room number is 117 and my name is Terry Chen . 
 I'm hungry . Let's go to the snack bar . 
 I am going to try Gado Gado . 
 it's a kind of rice ball that is made in Malaysia . What about you ? 
 do you want noodles , vegetables , rice , meat , seafood , beans , or dessert ? 
 have you ever tried tempura ? 
 it's deep fried vegetables , which is commonly eaten in Japan . 
 most people eat tempura with chopsticks , but you can use a fork if you don't know how to use chopsticks . 
 let me think . You could get an Indian or Thai vegetable curry , or you could get some Kimchi . 
 I used to buy lunch every day from the International food stall at school . Every day was an adventure ! 
 Sorry , but I'm not really that interested in those things . 
 Really ? 
 Oh , I don't care about that . 
 Are they ? 
 I am afraid I am not interested in fashion . 
 But thank you very much all the same . 
 Going to the gym tonight , Mary ? 
 That sounds like fun.Would you mind some company ? 
 I'll get my things and meet you there . 
 How nice these frames are ! 
 I want to try on this pair . 
 That's right . 
 I agree , but I like wire frames . 
 The channel boats are quite fast , aren't they ? 
 I hope we shan't have a rough passage . 
 That's a good idea . 
 Yes , unfortunately . I'm very much subject to it . 
 Yes , this little boat gets up a fine speed , and I think we'll soon get to the land . 
 May I help you ? 
 Certainly . These are thirty yuan each and these are twenty-five . 
 How about these ? They are nine yuan each . 
 Not at all . 
 Yeah , I had been in the charity organization for 2 months and I learned a lot from that experience , including love , sympathy , equality , and so on . 
 I think it had direct impact on my way of thinking . I learned to look at people and things from an overall perspective . In that case , I am not easy to be edgy . 
 Sure . First you pick up the receiver and hit one of the first 3 buttons . Do you hear a tone ? 
 OK . Now you dial 9 on the keypad . Do you hear the tone change ? 
 Well , when you hear it change , that means you have an outside line . Where are you trying to call ? 
 OK . Well , to dial to the outside you just now dial the number . For a call inside the company just hit the extension number . Do you know the extensions ? 
 Well , if you ever need help with an extension , you can dial O . 
 I would like to check in . Here are my ticket and baggage . 
 Well , can I put something in this handbag ? 
 I saw on TV that there is an entertainment item , bungee in Beijing Longtanhu Park . Except that the height is not exiting enough . 
 The highest bungee spot in the world is located in Mount Kikicama , South Africa , which is 216 meters high . A cable car in a scenic spot in Switzerland is 160 meters high . 
 It is said that Bungee was originally a grown-up ceremony of the indigenous people of New Guinea . People stood on branches of the tree , which was over 30 meters high . Their feet were fastened with canes and they jumped off from where they stood . When they almost reached the ground , they suddenly stopped to prove their bravery and express that they were able to endure the hardships of life independently . 
 Bill , please . 
 Excuse me , what's this item for ? 
 But we've can canceled one bottle . 
 I'm sorry for the miscalculation . Here's the new bill . Would you mind checking it again ? 
 If you're staying at our hotel , you may sign the bill . 
 Three yuan . 
 You put it in the slot at the turnstile and then push the turnstile to get into the platform . 
 That's very easy . The exit is always open . 
 My pleasure . 
 Yes , I know . The boarding time on the ticket says 17 
 Yes , It ’ s essential . 
 We can check it and hand carry small bags . And we have open each for inspection 
 I think so . we certainly don ’ t want a highjack to happen on our plane today . 
 I don ’ t feel so good . I am feeling sick to my stomach . 
 I had fried shrimp and clams for lunch . 
 Perhaps , but I haven ’ t felt well for a few days now . 
 My stress level is pretty much what is usually is . 
 It seems to me like I may have caught a bug . 
 I'm going to do some jogging on the treadmill . Then I think I'll do some work with the dumbbless . 
 Ok . I will . Could you help me with the treadmill ? I found it difficult to get the setting right last time . 
 Yes , it is . I'll be coming here regularly . I think I need regular exercise to get in shape and then to stay in shape . 
 I was told that the first time I came heer . I was told not to put too much pressure on my body at first . I need to build up slowly . 
 Paul , you were also a parent of young kids before . So , can you tell me what you did when your kids didn ’ t behave very well ? 
 I do it , too . You know , sometimes when we eat , my child would pull a dish towards him and grab it with his hands and eat . And if it were something he doesn ’ t like , he would spit it out and throw it into other dishes . He does it very often . I really get mad . I can ’ t help spank him sometimes . 
 My husband is an American . He criticizes me when I do that . He says that I can ’ t change a child ’ s behavior by using force . He is learning what I am doing now . 
 Yeah . I ’ m still learning how to control his behavior and my temper . My child is almost two years old , and I ’ Ve learnt the distraction technique when he cries for something . 
 It really isn't hard , sir . You just have to follow the instructions . 
 We will give you a detailed instruction manual if you buy the table . 
 Don't worry about that . Your English seems very good.And our instruction manuals are very clearly written . It's easy ! 
 Of course.First , you must sand the furniture . You sand it to make the wood smooth.You start with heavy-grade sandpaper . Then , you move to finer-grade sandpaper . 
 The better you sand it , the better the finish will be . 
 Then , after you sand it , you use tack cloth to wipe off any dust or sawdust . 
 Yes , sawdust is the tiny particles of wood.You could call it wood dust . You must wipe it off.The wood should be very clean before you put the varnish on . 
 Then you apply the varnish , which is very easy . It is like painting . 
 Yes , we have many colors to choose from , sir . 
 After the varnish dries for 24 hours , you can put another coat of varnish on . Or you can put the finish on.The finish is hard and clear . It goes on top of the varnish . 
 Well , when the finish is dry , the table is done . 
 It only sounds complicated . It's really very easy . A lot of people here in America finish their own furniture.It ' s a good way to save some money . And a lot of people even enjoy it . 
 Alright , sir . 
 Good afternoon , Mr . Black . Thank you very much . 
 As you please . I ’ m ready . 
 I think yours is a well-known advertising company , so I ’ m sure to get opportunities to display my talent in advertisement . 
 Well , the company has some financial problems . People there are all thinking of quitting . 
 One week after I have submitted my resignation paper . 
 Thank you , sir . 
 Have you paid the airport fee ? 
 In that case , please get your passport and boarding card ready . Just wait in the terminal for twenty more minutes.You will hear the announcement . 
 Excuse me . Where is the Beijing railway station ? 
 How long will I take it to get there ? 
 May I take a bus or a taxi to get there ? 
 Excuse me . Sir . Where is the No . 1 bus stop ? 
 Thank you very much 
 No , I don't . 
 Because I think it's boring 
 Learn a lot ? Really ? 
 Do you have magazines now ? 
 Can you lend me one ? 
 Can you put me through to Mr . Lining ? 
 I am calling to let you know that you are selected to fill the position of Project Manager . 
 By the way , are you married ? 
 The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here ! 
 That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying ! 
 I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him . 
 I came two years ago after I graduated from college . This is my first job . 
 Of course ! Everyday , there is a deadline to meet . Bosses watching and testing me all the time , not liking in college , handed in paper months later and tested on schedule . It is so busy . But anyway , I have been trying my best to be a good employee . 
 It is so encouraging to hear this remark . The secret is to make plans . Write down your goals , short-term and long-term and make detail plans for a week or a month . Then just work hard . 
 Air freight is the quickest and safest way , I think . 
 Good afternoon , it's nice to see you again . Have you decided to go ahead and try for the Fixed Asset Loan ? 
 That depends . Our repayment plans go from 1 year to 10 years . The Fixed Asset Loan is a long-term loan , you see . The loan can be paid in either monthly or quarterly instalments , to suit your needs . 
 You will need to pay part of the principle sum and part of the interest due . 
 Would you be kind enough to lend me forty pounds ? 
 That's all right . 
 Good morning . I want to deposit a sum of money into my account . 
 Well , I want to deposit 2,000 yuan into my account . 
 OK . I wonder about the rate of interest of the account . 
 Thank you very much . 
 How much is the voucher worth ? 
 Here it is . 
 OK . Here you are . 
 Sorry , I'm late . 
 Freeze ! Police ! Put your hands over your head ! 
 You're under arrest for concealing illegal drugs . 
 You are suspected of hiding illegal drugs . So we are taking you into custody . 
 We've found some heroin at your house . 
 That may be , but you're still under arrest . And you'd better stop talking . 
 Whatever you say . 
 Do we need food ? 
 What are you going to get ? 
 Maybe you should go and look in the refrigerator . 
 Just get the basics . 
 You know . Get some eggs , milk , and bread . 
 Fine , I'll go do that for you . 
 Mom , what should I do ? 
 OK . I will call Peter to clean it together . 
 Mr . Phillips ? I have a request here from purchasing that needs your approval . 
 I believe it ’ s going to Ms . Wilson ’ s office . 
 Excuse me , what material is it ? 
 No , where are the cotton cloths ? 
 What is the shrink rate after washing ? 
 Our supervisor Lester does . Actually , Lester is kind of like the kitchen god . 
 He just stays in the kitchen and watches you . Before the Chinese New Year , the kitchen god tells his boss whether you were good or bad this year . Just like Lester does ! 
 Actually , there's a way to keep the kitchen god from telling the bad things you did . 
 I think so ! Just serve a lot of sweet dishes next week . That will make the kitchen god say sweet things about you ! 
 And what happened ? 
 I need a taxi . 
 No , the taxi will do . 
 No , thank you . Taxis and I get along just fine . 
 I'm seeing a show at Rockefeller Center . 
 I'm ready to go right now . 
 Great ! As soon as I brush my teeth , I'll be downstairs . 
 Excuse me . 
 Um , this steak , I asked for to be medium rare . 
 Well , I ’ m afraid it isn ’ t . It ’ s a bit too well done and rather tough . Would you mind changing ? 
 Yes , that ’ s all right . Thank you very much . 
 He has extensive experience , although the guy ’ s really deep , sometimes , it scares me . 
 I know , and that's why I'm always respectful and I keep my distance . It's safer that way . 
 It's in the eyes . They're the type that seems to look into your soul , making one really uneasy . 
 Yes , I agree with you . 
 Please let us know the quantity required so that we can work out the premium and freight charges . 
 All right . Here are our F . O . B . price lists . All the prices are subject to our final confirmation . 
 We usually offer on a net basis only . Many of our clients have been doing very well on this quoted price . 
 The quantity you ordered is much smaller than those of others . If you can manage to boost it a bit , we ’ ll consider giving you a better discount . 
 Well , as this is the first deal between us , we agree to give you an one-percent discount as a special encouragement . 
 I ’ m afraid we have really made a great concession , and could not go any further . 
 All right . See you tomorrow . 
 Yes , my engine warning light is on . 
 Just since today . 
 It runs fine . 
 Okay . 
 Okay . 
 No , you can give a call when you have done checking . 
 Have you gone to school today ? 
 I couldn't go to school today , I was sick . 
 Thank you very much , that's kind of you . 
 When you miss a day of school , I'll be happy to give you the English assignments . 
 Can I order something from the kitchen ? 
 A bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare would hit the spot . 
 Sure ! Right now , I would even eat hamburger ! 
 Thank you , but I just finished eating some chocolate-covered cherries . 
 Not a problem . 
 Sorry to trouble you . Can you tell me how to get to the City Bank ? 
 How long will it take if I walk ? 
 These three hours chatting with you have been very ... interesting . Could you please tell us why we're here ? 
 What is our time frame ? 
 May I take yor order now ? 
 We have caviar , foiegras , lox , cold beef , sour cucumber ... 
 OK , sir . Do you want some soups ? 
 Of course . What about you ? 
 Where is your polling place ? 
 Oh , is that right ? 
 I have no idea . 
 Nothing came in the mail telling me my polling place . 
 Oh , really ? Thanks , I ’ m going to do that right now . 
 Because they are rednecks . 
 Really ? You've done a good job . 
 I have never heard that men would trim their eyebrows . Are you kidding ? 
 Do you mean that it is a trend for men to trim their eyebrows ? 
 Yeah , let me have a try . 
 No way . 
 It's out of the question . 
 Why don't you go to bed ? 
 Hello . 
 Hi , Dad . Where are you ? 
 Thank you , Dad . 
 I love you , too , Dad . 
 Cats chase mice , don't they ? 
 Do you have to walk a cat ? 
 But then you have to change the litter box . 
 The washing machine isn't working again . 
 Now we arrive at the Cambridge University , it is one of the oldest universities in the world . 
 In 2009 Cambridge will come to its eight hundredth anniversary . 
 What do you think of our price ? 
 Yes , we regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly . 
 I don't think so . You must compare our price with that it other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level . 
 I'm afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price . 
 We've already cut down our price to cost level . 
 Yes this is the best we can do . 
 A report says running red lights causes one thousand traffic accidents every year . 
 Maybe they know they shouldn ’ t run a red light , but when they are driving they don ’ t pay enough attention to traffic lights . 
 I know . If a policeman catches you using the cell phone while driving , you will be fined . 
 Your major must be computer . 
 Yes , I ’ m quite satisfied with your qualifications . 
 Generally speaking , training new members is usually necessary . We offer our new employees a one-week training course . 
 Yes , of course . You will be responsible for the designing and developing new products and also be in charge of the evaluation of the software programs including complex software systems to ensure product features and operation complaints . 
 Good morning , Miss.Are there boat tickets to Miami on the first of September 
 I'd like the first-class cabin for two . What's the fare ? 
 How long is the boat time-table effective ? 
 I want to know what port does our ship stop at ? 
 How long will the trip take from here to New York ? 
 Thank you . 
 Oh , I forgot . 
 I ’ m so sorry ! OK , so you just want a simple message on it . 
 I ’ m on it ! 
 I'd like a hamburger with lettuce and tomato . 
 A Coke , please . 
 Hey , Robert , that's a nice shirt you are wearing . Where did you get it ? 
 that's nice . Do you know you can get one at the wholesale market near the zoo for a much lower price ? 
 true , learning how to haggle the price is one of the things people have to pick up when they come to China for the first time . 
 yeah , I have the same feeling . Also there is another thing that bothers me the quality . Things in a department store are usually quality-guaranteed . But at a wholesale market , you never know whether w 
 I understand . While it's always good to follow the local customs , I guess there are exceptions . 
 According to their scheme , it will begin on September 10th . 
 Yes , it is much earlier than past years . 
 Where is your store located ? 
 Right , I'll be right over . 
 Which airport , ma'am ? 
 All right , ma'am . Need any help with your luggage ? 
 What do you think a job is ? 
 Where do you see yourself three years from now ? 
 That sounds reasonable . 
 Fine . What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a boss and his or her employees ? 
 You'll have a definite answer from us within a week . Goodbye . 
 Oh , here comes a bus ! 
 How long have you waited ? 
 I am so busy today . 
 I ’ m not sure . Perhaps you could do the shopping . 
 Or maybe make the beds . 
 Thanks . That ’ s terrific ! 
 Do you like this dress , madam ? 
 What about this one ? It's a lovely dress . It's very smart . Short skirts are in fashion now . Would you like to try it ? 
 I'm afraid I haven't got a larger dress . This is the largest dress in the shop . 
 Wait a minute , please . 
 No , I'd like to book a single room with one double bed . 
 2 nights , how much does it cost ? 
 Does the charge include everything ? 
 Do you require a deposit ? 
 What's the date today Mr.Brown . I don't have a calendar . 
 25th Sep ? Oh , I have an appointment tonight . 
 It is at 8 o'clock . 
 I don't know what time it is.It must be about 6 o'clock . I have to go now . I don't want to be late . 
 Excuse me ! How can I get to the post office , please ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Hello , stewardess . Could you bring me a blanket ? I feel so cold . 
 I'd like a pillow as Well . 
 Have you started cleaning up your room yet ? 
 When exactly do you plan on cleaning it ? 
 I thought I asked you to clean your room earlier . 
 Remember to vacuum the floor and dust everything . 
 Make sure that you don't go anywhere until you clean your room . 
 Do you think I should join the basketball team , Mary ? 
 But I'm afraid it'll take up too much of my time . 
 Hmm , you're right . 
 I am indeed . What can you tell me ? 
 Do I get a card ? 
 How about the interest ? I'm not really happy with the interest I'm receiving through my Current Account . 
 That sounds better . Also , can I use the one card for several accounts ? Say , if I have two or three accounts and want to transfer money from one to the other ? 
 That's wonderful . 
 It's really spectacular . 
 I think we can climb to the top , can't we ? 
 Good morning , can I help you ? 
 When ? 
 The flight number is Cz353 . it departs at 17:10 and arrives at 45 . 
 Your passport , please . 
 This house is very nice for me , but I can ’ t afford it in a lump sum . 
 That ’ s good . Will you tell me the details ? 
 How long will it take ? 
 I need to talk it over with my wife . 
 Susan , can you give me a hand ? 
 I want to create a password for this document . Please tell me how to do it . 
 What do I do after I've typed in my password ? 
 Where on earth are we going to borrow at 3 % ? 
 You can knock off another 2 % for that . 
 Not quite , if we get too heavily in debt , the shares will tend to drop . 
 I would like to have notice of that question , I will give you an answer in a week . 
 Yeah . I'm going with Jennie . 
 Thank you . 
 I beg your pardon ? 
 What did he say ? 
 Oh dear ! What did he tell you to do ? 
 Ten days ? Would you please repeat it again ? 
 Bob , What are you thinking about ? 
 Do you think it'll work ? 
 Room service . May I help you ? 
 Certainly . If you want to make a local call , dial 10 first and then call the number you want . 
 Welcome to our company , My name is Jon Dahl Green . I'm in charge of the export department . Let me give you my business card . 
 How was your flight ? 
 Here's your schedule . After this meeting , we will visit the factory and have another meeting with the production manager . And you'll be having dinner with our director . 
 Of course . I've arranged it at 10 0 ' clock tomorrow morning . 
 Sure , did you receive the sample we sent last week ? 
 I'm very glad to hear that . 
 The unit price is $ 12.50 . 
 I'm afraid we can't . $ 12.50 is our rock bottom price . If you purchase more than 10,000 units we can reduce it to $ 12.00 . 
 Very good . It's been a pleasure to do business with you , Mr . Smith . 
 Of course . 
 It's on the Fifth Avenue . 
 I see.You ' re a stranger here.Walk two blocks ahead , then turn left . You can't miss it . 
 If were you . I'd take a taxi . 
 You will find a taxi stand the street corner . 
 You're welcome . 
 I am so sorry to hear that sir , let me check and see what is available , what room are you in now ? 
 Oh , dear , well , it looks like we have a few rooms available , can I put you into a room on the 17th floor ? It has a balcony and it doesn ’ t face the highway . 
 Let me check you out of your old room , you have to sign here , and acknowledge these changes and also the charges to your previous room . Then I can hook you right up to room 1780 . 
 Now , if I look here I see that you completed a BA in English ? 
 Yes , I ’ m pleased to see that you also got a distinction . 
 Well , it looks like his encouragement paid off Rebecca . So how about extracurricular activities at University ? 
 What did that involve ? 
 I ’ m sure . Okay , now let ’ s move on to your work experience , shall we ? 
 You owe $ 36.78 . 
 I ’ m sorry , but your card isn ’ t working . 
 The machine says your card was declined . 
 Do you have another card ? 
 Maybe you can just pay in cash ? 
 I guess you won ’ t be able to purchase these items today . 
 Marriott Street . 
 M , A , double R , I , O , double T . 
 I would like to get my driver's license today . 
 I haven't taken it yet . 
 Can I take my test right now ? 
 I would like to do that right now , if I could . 
 That's perfect . 
 The morning would be nice . 
 Have you moved into your new house yet , Michael ? 
 So , what do you think about the place ? Are you glad that you moved in ? 
 How old is the house then ? 
 Sounds fascinating . Where is your new house located ? 
 Do you have a big yard ? 
 Is your house well-lit ? 
 How many rooms does your house have ? 
 I'd be up for that ! 
 Yeah . I need to get some stuff . 
 Where's Lisa ? 
 What are coupons ? 
 Really ? 
 Wow , you ’ re up early today ! What ’ s for breakfast ? 
 Smells good ! I ’ ll make some coffee . Do you want me to make you some eggs ? 
 Www , I don ’ t know how you can eat your eggs like that ! Ever since I was small , I ’ Ve had eggs and soldiers . 
 You know what really drives me crazy ? When I ask for soft boiled eggs , and they overcook them , so they come out hard boiled ! How can you dipyour toast into a hard boiled egg ? 
 Here you go , honey , fried eggs . 
 Hello , come in , I've been waiting for you . 
 No , no , no , not at all.It ' s just that I've been looking forward to meeting you . 
 Ha , ha , ha ! Yes , I guess I deserved that . Let me explain , okay ? 
 Well , as you probably know I buy from a selected group of suppliers and don't , as a rule , deal with new people . 
 I'm very old-fashioned . I believe in loyalty.Once I start a sales relationship with someone , I stay with him or her , and we so most of our business on the phone . I expect their absolute best price possible and don't haggle.But if I find out they screwed me over , then I find another supplier . 
 Well , those are my terms . As long as you honor them , we do business.If you break faith and try to take advantage , I'll find someone else to work with . Can you live with that ? 
 Hi Ron , this is Kim at headquarters . 
 Great , thanks . I was calling to change our meeting next week . 
 Well , I was hoping we could reschedule for early next month , Our trip has been postponed until the 2nd . 
 That works for me ! I will call you when I get into town to reconfirm . 
 Watch out ! You'll hit that car if you're not careful . 
 You see . I told you you'd hit him if you weren't careful . 
 Oh , so it was my fault , was it ? If I hadn't warned you in time it would have been much worse . 
 Well , let's move , I can see a rest area ahead.We can relax there , and see what wildlife is around ... 
 Because I come hiking every week . That's why I'm in good-shape . I think that I should bring you a walkingstick next time . 
 So , you want me to carry your backpack , your thermos flask , our picnic , and you as well . No problem , jump on . 
 It's coming along well , but it is a little delayed . 
 I'm pressed for time and I am afraid I need someone to help me . 
 OK , we promise to do it well . 
 Sorry to interrupt , Doris , but can you tell me more about these tour groups , what kind of things they enjoy , and so on ? 
 I don ’ t mean to interrupt , but can you tell me what plans you have for growing the youth market ? 
 So how do you intend to do that ? 
 May I interrupt you for a moment ? 
 How much is it going to cost , and who is going to pay ? 
 I see . OK . So what ’ s next ? 
 Where is the boss ? I need him to sign a few documents . I checked in his office , but he is not there . Is he out of the office now ? 
 What's he studying ? 
 Sounds like a tiring schedule.He ’ s probably got a lot of homework too , eh ? 
 Why is that ? 
 Hello , reservation desk . Can I help you ? 
 What day would you like to reserve the suite for , sir ? 
 I ’ m sorry , sir . We can ’ t accept reservations for next Friday due to over booking . May I suggest another hotel , sir ? 
 Please hold the line . I ’ ll see if there is a duplex suite available on that day . ( a minute later ) Sir ? Holiday Inn is available for your need . 
 I ’ ll give you their phone number . It ’ s 601 789 5634 . 
 This is Ryan . How may I help you ? 
 Do you know what the problem is ? 
 Have you had it a long time ? 
 Have you been using anything for it ? 
 That will probably take care of your symptoms . I ’ ll see you tomorrow . 
 Actually , the one-bedroom is the only vacant apartment right now . 
 No , not for a few months . 
 I need to cancel one of my accounts . 
 I don ’ t need it anymore . 
 Just transfer it over to my remaining account . 
 That would be great . 
 Not today . 
 That ’ s fine . Take your time . 
 Hi , Tom . Want a cup of coffee ? 
 Oh , hey , did you look in the classified ads ? 
 No , Ah ... single sellers . 
 Uh huh . How about a used car ? They've got good ones now . 
 Oh , hey , how about a new car ? They've got easy loans now . You'd feel so good driving a new car . 
 What's wrong with you ? 
 It's just around the comer.Would you need some pills ? 
 Hi , Zina . Lots of people are looking for you . 
 Like Elvin . He isn't too happy about what you promised Stars.com . 
 You do realize that it isn't humanly possible for us to finish by next week ? 
 That would definitely make a difference . But Vince already said no . 
 I haven ’ t been able to take a deep breath lately , and I need to know why . 
 No , I ’ Ve been feeling fairly good most of the time . It just is hard to breathe . 
 No one has ever checked me for allergies . 
 When the weather gets really cold , it gets worse . 
 Thank you for pursuing this . I appreciate your help . 
 Better take the subway . It's faster , and more convenient . 
 We have a rather comprehensive subway system here . You can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway , especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy . 
 Just give the man standing there 3 yuan and he'll give you a token . Then , you slip it into the slot at the turnstile and push the turnstile to get in . 
 Ask the worker who sells tokens to give you one . It's free fo charge . Actually maps showing subway routes are posted at most stations . 
 No , you don't have to . Here comes the train . 
 Raise the alarm by breaking the glass of the nearest fire alarm . Call Security , say ' Fire ' and give your name and exact location . At night you should phone the fire service from the nearest telephone . 
 If you discover a small fire , you can try to put it out with a fire extinguisher but only do this if you have been trained . Make sure you use the right extinguisher . They are all colour-coded and contain different substances to put out the fire . 
 Yes , you can take small sum of money and important items such as passport and keys and business documents and so on . 
 There is a long list of those things forbidden , including explosives , gum opium and precious cultural relies and so on . 
 Could you do me a favor ? 
 Can you help me move this table ? 
 Pretty good . I ’ Ve just had my new poems published . 
 Thank you . 
 He is fine . 
 Yes . He ’ s already got the passport and visa . 
 Thank you . He ’ s very lucky indeed . 
 OK . Here you are . 
 About three weeks . 
 Sightseeing . 
 At the Friendship Hotel in Beijing . 
 Yes , I have some fresh apples in my suitcase . 
 Oh , that's too bad . 
 I'm sorry I can't bring better news , sir . The site is a disaster . 
 It is not only the earthquake , sir . But the mudslides.Much of the north half of the site has been covered over by mud . 
 That's what we thought , sir . That's what the news reported.But there was one little mudslide in our district too . Right above our site . 
 I'm sorry , sir . 
 Well , it took me about nine hours to get back here by car.If Ivan leaves tonight , I think he should be there by tomorrow lunch . 
 But sir ... 
 I wouldn't recommend sending Ivan now.Especially not at night . The roads aren't safe . 
 No , sir . The bridges are fine.But I've heard rumors that the revolutionaries are coming down from the mountains.There has been fighting , sir . 
 You know the government controls the press here , sir . They don't want it reported . 
 I'm sorry , sir . 
 Would you like chicken or beef ? 
 Here you are . 
 Certainly . The service cart will be down the aisle again soon . 
 His name is Bingo . 
 We're not sure because the neighbour gave him to us after they moved away . 
 Oh yes , he is . When he was a puppy , he liked to chew my father's shoes , but he's okay now . 
 I didn't know you had a cat . When did you get her ? 
 Really ? Why is that ? 
 Bingo could never do that . He stays in the house except when we take him to the park . 
 Arden wants to have a trademark for our new series of products registered . But I have no idea on the registering process . 
 Is it so easy ? I never experienced this . Can you tell me something about it ? 
 Based on what you said , does it mean that we can not have a trademark like ' genova ' , right ? 
 Can you tell something about the preparation for the register ? 
 Hello sir , how can I help you ? 
 Let ’ s see . Okay , so 50 mg of Prozac , would you prefer this in capsule or tablet ? 
 Okay , you should take 1 capsule 3 times a day . Be sure not to take it on an empty stomach , and also , don ’ t ever mix it with alcohol ! 
 Okay , anything else I can get you ? 
 Sure . Darn condoms aren ’ t registered in our system . 
 Just hang on there a sec . Can I get a price check on ” Fun Times Ribbed Condoms ” please ! 
 Good morning . 
 Of course not . But I don't know when to get off . 
 I'm going to Wangfujing . 
 Thank you very much . 
 How many workers are there on the lines ? 
 Oh , it's highly efficient . 
 How do you control the quality of the products ? 
 Yes , quality is even more than the quantity . 
 Good evening , sir . I think we have reservations . Have you fixed them ? 
 My name is Paul Harper . 
 I'll meet you at the Gate round about seven . 
 At the Gate . 
 Round about seven . 
 Peter . Peter Brown , you know . Don't forget to bring the letter . 
 I told you not to forget to bring the letter . 
 We ’ re asking for donations today . 
 We ’ re trying to raise money for the campaigns . 
 As much as possible . 
 We are going door to door . 
 What else can we do ? 
 I didn ’ t think of that . 
 Oh . I just wanted you to shut up . You were off-key anyway . Let me see that ! 
 What a cool see-through blue ! How do you wear this thing ? 
 How do I turn it on ? 
 No , I'm used to having tea first . 
 No sugar , please . 
 Oh , really ? Just a moment ... You paid with a ten-dollar note and I gave you ... Oh , sorry , here's a five left . I'm terribly sorry . 
 When did it happen ? 
 Tell me where it happened and how ? 
 That happens often these days.Well , please fill in this " Report of Theft " . 
 Do you eat a lot of fruit and vegetables in you country ? 
 I like them very much . We also eat a lot of vegetables in my country , buy we eat different kinds . 
 We eat a lot of sweet corn , broccoli and eggplant . 
 Why is it relatively expensive ? 
 I see . We grow a lot of fruit and vegetables in my country . We export a lot of melons , grapes , oranges and lemons . In your country , do you eat corn on the cob ? It's very popular in my country . 
 Do people usually buy frozen vegetables in your country , it ’ s very rare in mine . 
 Yes , sir ? 
 That's 68 pounds altogether , please . 
 What are the requirements that you need to do the job ? 
 I can handle that . I can operate word - processor , fax machine , photostat , and other office equipments . 
 I have a master's degree and I meet all the needs you want , so I am confident of doing this job well . 
 We went out to the stadium . Bob hadn ’ t been to a game for a few weeks . 
 Nope , lost again . But , it was a good game . 
 I don ’ t mind at all . You can ask me anything . We ’ re friends . 
 I have a scholarship from my government for four years . How about you ? 
 Do you mean that you ’ re self-supporting ? I didn ’ t even know you had a job ! 
 Yeah , I really know the feeling . I can ’ t wait to graduate so I can get a good job and earn my own money . 
 Can I help you ? 
 I ’ ll be glad to help . 
 All you have to do is ask for help . 
 I ’ m ready and willing to help . 
 The counter is at the end of the aisle . They are kept in the ice chest . 
 The delicatessen department is on the second floor . 
 Alpha Beta Courier Service ? This is Louise Walker calling from The Marketing Company . 
 We need to deliver some documents to our Monroe street branch . Can you come by and pick them up ? 
 May I help you ? 
 I ’ m Smith , the manager of Human Resources Department . May I ask your name ? 
 Would you tell me what education background you have ? 
 Do you have any experience in this field ? 
 OK . Do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken English ? 
 OK . I will accept you for a three months-period of probation . Is this satisfactory ? 
 Welcome to our factory . 
 Actually , you'll know our products better after the visit . I'll show you around and explain the operations as we go along . 
 Maybe we could start with the Design Department . And then we could look at the production line . 
 About 10 % of the gross sales . 
 Are you here to make a deposit Mr Hayes ? 
 You want to withdraw on your Time Deposit , right ? 
 Of course , Mr Hayes . That's what I'm here for . What would you like to know ? 
 This bank charges you 6 months interest as a penalty if you withdraw before maturity . Would it be possible to take the money from your Current Account , for example ? 
 You would be using mainly English in this job . Do you think you can make yourself understood in English with ease ? 
 How many years have you been learning English ? 
 Well , perhaps that's the reason why you are so fluent in it . 
 Hi , I'm Benjamin . Nice to meet you here . You look great . 
 No , this is the second time . But I also feel bad because of the lower pressure and the jet lag . 
 Oh , that's too bad . Do you get a good knowledge of China ? 
 All of the Chinese are proud of the Great Wall . And it was built before the In dynasty near Shan Haiguan-the First Pass in the World . 
 No , before the In dynasty . 
 Both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health . And I usually refresh myself with a cup of tea . 
 Do you like the Chinese traditional silk ? 
 Go and pick some stuff up . The price can always surprise foreign friends . 
 Hi . What can I get for you ? 
 Good choice ! Our ground beef is extra lean , if you know what I mean . 
 No , no no no chicken breasts at the moment , but we have some nice chicken thighs . 
 Okay , is there anything else ? 
 Yes ! It ’ s very fine meat ! Made it myself ... 
 Wait ! We have T-bone , rib eye , and sirloin steaks . They are very fresh ! Just came from the slaughter house ... 
 Okay . That will be thirty-four dollars and fifty cents . 
 How are you doing ? 
 Go for it . 
 I voted this morning . 
 I can ’ t tell you that . 
 That is private information . 
 All I can tell you is our next President got my vote . 
 But Mom ! Today we ’ re playing football ! I love football ! 
 I don ’ t know . It was there when I woke up this morning . 
 I bashed it against the chair in my room . 
 A little , but not much . 
 If I ’ m better this afternoon , can I go to school ? 
 It's time to graduate and it's time to find a job . Susan , why do we need to find a job ? 
 But you know it's hard for a new graduate to find a job right now . 
 I've been fed up with study . 
 Oh , my . Why there are still so many things to learn after graduation ? 
 Excuse me ? Can you do me a favor , please ? 
 I'm from England and I'm trying to make a travel plan for today . 
 I'm a flight attendant and I'm here on vacation . 
 I live in the Holiday Inn Lido Hotel . 
 Yes , it is . Do you know where I can get a town map ? 
 Great , do you have any for foreigners ? I mean English version ? 
 For the construction site manager ? 
 What happened ? 
 Well , no surprise there . 
 Great , so are you going to sign a contract with them ? 
 Great . Good luck . 
 Yes , and I think I have good news for you . 
 Yes , they accepted your counter-offer , but they want you to pay for the home inspection . 
 It will cost you around five hundred to one thousand dollars for a home inspection . 
 Yes , you are paying for it , so you get to choose . I would pick the best one . 
 I will call the owners right now . They will be happy to hear the good news . 
 If that's the case , there's not much point in further discussion . We might as well call the whole deal off . 
 I think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price . How about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded ? 
 Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we can accept . When I suggested we meet each other half way , I meant it literally . 
 What would you suggest ? 
 That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars to be covered . Let's meet each other half way once more , then the gap will be closed and our business completed . 
 I'm glad we've come to an agreement on price . We'll go on to the other terms and conditions at our next meeting . 
 What is it ? 
 Yes , they're right . In fact , we have either restored or adopted international practices in our foreign trade . 
 Basically speaking , yes , we welcome the establishment of repry - tentative offices by foreign companies in Washington D . C . Of course , there are more details to be attended to . We cannot settle it in a few words . 
 How about tomorrow morning at 9 ? 
 Good evening , may I help you ? 
 I am sorry , there are so many travelers that all our tables have been booked on that day . 
 Thank you , sir . We will phone you as soon as we have a vacant table . 
 So ? 
 All right ! 
 I feel so tired . 
 Why ? I'd just be dead tired for the rest of the day . 
 Are you sure ? 
 OK . Let me try . 
 Would you give me a bottle of beer , please ? 
 No , ice will spoil the taste . 
 Yes . Something non-alcoholic , please . 
 A glass of juice please . 
 Hello , 35 .. 
 Speaking . 
 I am sorry . I am very tired . I'm going to bed early . 
 No , I ’ m sorry . I'm going to meet some friends tomorrow evening . And I'm in a hurry now . 
 How much do you have budgeted for our trip to Las Angeles ? 
 Yes , I want to know exactly where the money is going . Give me a detailed report . 
 Weren ’ t you able to find anything less expensive ? We're sharing rooms , right ? 
 So far we have $ 2,800 , what else ? 
 Well , that's only $ 4000 . Didn't you tell me your budget was $ 5000 ? Where is the rest of the money ? 
 Could you please stop flipping the channels ? 
 Good morning , room reservations . Can I help you ? 
 A single room from June 18th to 20th . Is that correct ? 
 OK . Do you need a limousine service ? 
 A hundred and eighty yuan for one way . We have a counter at the airport where our representative will lead you to the car . 
 Thank you , sir . We look forward to serving you . 
 Hello ! Could I speak to Sheerly Lim please ? 
 This is Sue from work . 
 Gosh , another stop.It seems the cars ahead of us have to stop every two minutes , It's no quicker than a bus . 
 It was silly of me to have taken a taxi . 
 No , from New Zealand , sir . I visited New Zealand and saw lots of overseas people there . 
 The more the world becomes open , the more people become international ! 
 Leave the details of making the offer up to me . What were you thinking you should offer ? 
 It is best to start a little low on the first bid to allow for a counter-offer . How about offering three hundred and twenty thousand dollars ? 
 Your offering price is not out-of-line . The owners will either take it or make a counter-offer . 
 It usually doesn ’ t take very long for owners to respond to an offer . 
 The only thing you should do now is relax . You already are pre-qualified for your loan . 
 We don't have a full-sized swimming pool , but we do have individual swim stations . 
 Basically , a swim station is like a treadmill , except instead of running , you swim . 
 If you're a registered guest , you have free access to our swim stations . 
 To conserve electricity , the stations operate only from 7a . m . till 10 . 
 I don't think you'll be disappointed . People really seem to like the swim stations . 
 Does all that come to 10,000 NT ? 
 Where do I sign ? 
 OK . 
 Well , the teddy bear is for me ! 
 My name ’ s Terry Graham . You ’ re new around here , huh ? 
 Well , if there ’ s anything I can do for you , let me know . 
 Welcome back . 
 Why do you want to be a teacher ? 
 Do you know about our school ? 
 There's someone coming . 
 Yes , it's fast . But four minutes is enough to do fifty thousand dollars damage . 
 I wonder if anyone can call the Ridleys about this . Do you know them well ? 
 Do you know where they're vacationing ? 
 Yes , but at least this way no one gets hurt.It ' s better to have a fire in your house when you're not home . Don't you think ? 
 Can I help you ? 
 What style would you prefer ? 
 Do you like this one ? 
 What about this one ? 
 70 yuan . 
 This one is only 50 yuan . 
 All right . 
 Thank you . Anything else ? 
 Walter , did you email that document to Mr . Lin yesterday ? 
 That's strange . I have Mr . Lin on the phone right now , and he says that he didn't receive any email from us yesterday . Are you sure you sent it ? 
 Here is an invitation for you . 
 Tomorrow is the tooth anniversary of our company . Our general manager invites you to a dinner party . Do you think you can manage it ? 
 That is great . Dinner starts at 6 
 All right . Bye . 
 John Li's Office , this is Jenny , may I help you ? 
 Yes , but let me check if he's available . 
 your mp3 looks so cool . Where did you get it ? 
 really ? Do you often shop online ? 
 I've never tried E-shopping . Is it better than shopping at an actual store ? 
 sounds good , and I don't have to queue up at the cashier . 
 well , are there any other advantages ? 
 are there many choices of online shopping ? 
 perhaps I should have a try . 
 The whole-wheat loaf is 45 cents , the white loaves are 35 cents each , the baguette is 27 cents and the rolls are eight cents each . That makes two dollars fifty-seven cents . 
 Thank you , ma'am . Forty-three cents change . Have a nice day . 
 How long have you been sick ? 
 I enjoy the folk song and dance show very much . 
 I can't wait anymore . When does the performance start ? 
 ( After the show ) It's an excellent musical . The acting was very expressive and the songs and dancing were superb . 
 What do you think of the leading actors ? 
 You are a better judge . I don't know the play well enough . 
 I'm fine . I'm just so touched by the sad story . 
 I love them all . But if I had to name one as the best , I would say it's the ending . 
 Did you ? I didn't notice that . But still you should know it , for you have seen it with Laura before . 
 Then I doubt if you like operas at all . 
 OK , then . The man was old and he was visiting his wife's grave , with a rose in his hand . When he got there , he saw someone already put a rose on her grave . 
 Me , too . There was always a good round of applause every time she sings . 
 And it's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting , and music . Just amazing ! 
 Exactly . 
 It is unnecessary . I'll see you off at the airport . 
 For example ? 
 Oh , that's interesting ! 
 She's Betty.She ' s Mr Goldman's niece . 
 Yes , I'll be glad to . 
 What have you got this morning ? 
 I'd like to have a glass of tomato juice , please . 
 Yes , a dish of cream of wheat . 
 Yes , bacon and eggs with buttered toast . I like my bacon very crisp . 
 Fried , please . 
 No , that's enough . T hank you . 
 Yes , I am . 
 Glad to see you too . 
 Good afternoon . What can I do for you ? 
 About half an hour ago I fell on the ground and hurt my leg . It bled a lot . 
 First , I'll clean up the wound and then dress it . 
 Take it easy . It's not serious . You should keep the wound very clean . 
 Thank you very much , doctor . 
 Hi Sam . 
 When did you buy your new computer ? 
 So what's the problem ? 
 Can I have a look ? 
 Oh this is the new little EEE notebook from Asks . How much did you pay ? 
 Very nice . I am sure we will sort out your Internet in no time . 
 That will be perfect . 
 What are you buying ? 
 I can check for you , if you'd like . 
 First , we need eggs , milk , and bread . 
 How about some chicken , ground beef , and some steak . 
 Get some snack foods , too , dude . 
 No , but if you can think of anything else , just get it . 
 No , not yet . I just want a haircut . 
 I want it short . 
 I mean very short , shorter than it is now . 
 No , You can cut quite a bit off . I like it to be very short all over . Do you see what I mean ? 
 Yes , in the Chinese style . 
 No , thank you . 
 No , nothing of the kind . 
 That's very good ! 
 You really have talent . How did you learn to do this ? 
 Me , too . But I could never make bracelets like these . 
 I'll take one right now for seven dollars . 
 Excuse me , sir ? 
 I'm afraid you can't smoke here . 
 Can't you see the notice here ? 
 It says ' No smoking ' . 
 I called about that ad we saw in the paper . 
 That ’ s the one . 
 You were right , it was from a headhunter . He wouldn't tell me anything without a signed contract . 
 No ! Not at all . But I did find out they have more than one position with different clients , so at least one would probably work out . 
 I ’ m going there tomorrow . 
 And I think I'll look in on a few other Employment Agencies while I ’ m downtown , to see what they have . 
 Hello ! I'd like to get busy on my computer , but I need some broadband . 
 Uh-oh ! I can't use Ethernet . My computer is wireless only . 
 Any alternative that works will be great . 
 That sounds good . What's the charge ? 
 That sounds good . Now , how about the other alternatives ? 
 Use my laptop in the lobby ? That's great ! Now , if I need to print something there ? 
 I have to do some shopping . 
 I'm trying to buy a new bedroom set . 
 I'm not sure . 
 I have no idea where to find one . 
 I would appreciate that . 
 Is the furniture at IKEA cheap ? 
 Hello ! How do I get online with my laptop ? 
 Well , I see the cable . But my computer runs on wireless only . 
 Yes , I'd love to hear what the alternatives are . 
 Great ! But is it free ? 
 You said there were other alternatives ? 
 Okay . That sounds like a winner . Now if I need to print something in the lobby ? 
 Why have you decided to change jobs ? 
 Then , why do you want to work for our bank since it's a new establishment in Shanghai ? 
 It certainly is . But the work is also hard here . You need to put a lot of long hard hours on the job to succeed in this field . 
 Do you mind going on frequent business trips ? 
 One of my students told me she was very depressed today . 
 Her father is dying . 
 Yeah , she ’ s broken up about it , poor kid . 
 I talked to her for a while , but she ’ s really depressed . So , I made an appointment with the school counselor for her . 
 Yeah , that ’ s what I told her . I ’ m glad she ’ s reaching out for help , instead of trying to deal with this on her own . 
 I'm very annoyed at your disobedience . 
 You should have asked for my opinion before you did it . 
 You'd better remember your promise . 
 No , thank you . 
 That would be great . 
 I need it delivered tomorrow . Will that be possible ? 
 I need it delivered at 12 . 
 That's not a problem ? 
 That's great ! Thank you very much . 
 We appreciate your intention , but the amount of your orders last year was moderate . 
 Do you think it will help if we appoint a local agent ? 
 Well , we'll consider your proposal . 
 Sorry , I ’ m looking for my wallet . 
 Yes . A lot of cash . Almost forty thousand pounds . 
 It seems that is a better way . Thank you . 
 I'm so tired ! I don't know how I'm going to make it through this lecture . 
 I don't really like coffee , to be honest . It's too bitter for me . 
 most some drinks have too much sugar in them . 
 I like diet sprite . Does that have any caffeine in it ? 
 I don't care for coke . I heard that coke was first used as a medicine and I don't like medicine . What else has caffeine ? 
 maybe . How about a mochaccino ? Are they any good ? 
 that's perfect ! Would you like one , too ? My treat . 
 Hey , let ’ s go to the night market after work tonight . 
 That reminds me I should buy some new socks to go hiking this weekend . 
 Where are you heading now ? 
 Is that the university next to the Teachers ' College ? 
 You mean we'll share the taxi ? 
 Well . Don't worry about it , I will be happy to share the taxi with you . 
 No , I couldn't make it . 
 Oh , really ? Who won ? 
 Too bad I was busy . I really wanted to go . 
 So what was the score ? 
 Man , that was a really close game . 
 I'll make sure and make it to the next one . 
 Hello , may I speak to Mrs Smith ? 
 This is Sun , and I interviewed with you yesterday . 
 I am calling to thank you for giving me the interview for the Sales Manager position yesterday . 
 I really enjoyed meeting with you . 
 I am very interested in this position . 
 Well , thank you for your time and consideration again . 
 Excuse me , miss . I don't think we need the MP4 any more . We would like to refund it . 
 Here you are . 
 Why aren't you doing your homework ? 
 Oh , is it ? You'll be making records next , will you ? 
 You'd better get on with your homework ! You can practice on Sunday . 
 I certainly could.You ' ll get exams next month . 
 Oh , don't you ? God save me ! 
 Good morning . What seems to be the problem ? 
 I ’ d say you ’ Ve been working too hard or are under stress for some reason . Have you been taking anything for your cold ? 
 Good . I ’ m going to prescribe something stronger . It will make you feel drowsy , so you certainly should rest . 
 Have you been working hard recently ? 
 Good . Let ’ s take a look at that rash ... it looks worse than it is . I ’ m going to prescribe some ointment for it . If the rash doesn ’ t clear up in a few days , come back and see me . Do you have any other symptoms ? 
 Don ’ t worry about that . It ’ s probably of the stress you ’ Ve been under . Just take some aspirin . Combined with the stronger cough medicine , it will make you feel very tired . You shouldn ’ t work or use any equipment which requires concentration . If I were you , I ’ d just sleep , read a book , or watch TV . Here is your prescription . 
 I need to get my internet fixed . 
 It won't connect . 
 This problem has been happening for a few days now . 
 It just won't connect to a webpage , but it will pop up . 
 I'm going to need someone to come and fix it for me . 
 How long will it take for them to get here ? 
 That was delicious . 
 Thanks , but I couldn't eat another bite . I'm really full . 
 We have beef with rice and fish with noodles . Which would you like ? 
 Would you care for coffee or tea ? 
 Excuse me , sir . Is this a duty-free shop ? 
 Well , I am afraid I don't bring my passport with me today . Can you save it for us until tomorrow ? 
 Hi , I'm John Sandals , and I have a reservation . 
 Here you go . 
 Certainly ! Would you like my American Express card ? 
 I thought American Express was accepted everywhere . Never mind . Here's my VISA . 
 Yes , that's just fine . 
 I need a pan . 
 Well , the bigger the better , I think . 
 Yes , that is big enough , but it's too heavy for me . 
 Oh , this is nice and light . But it has an aluminum handle . 
 Oh , yes . This is very nice . I'll take this one . 
 Cash . Oh , I almost forgot . I need a lid , too . 
 Good evening , Yanking Restaurant . 
 Certainly , sir . For how many people , please ? 
 Of course . May I have your name , please ? 
 Can you spell that , please ? 
 Thank you , Mr . William . Goodbye . 
 Hi , Steven . What's new with you ? 
 Why ? 
 What happened ? Did you have a fight ? 
 I hate that , either . Did you tell him your feelings ? 
 It's a problem . You'd better move . 
 Here you are . 
 Really ? Ugh ... Is there any difference ? 
 Gee . I must have left it in my hotel room . 
 But when does the plane take off ? 
 Oh , my God ! What do I do now ? Bone head . 
 Is that me ? 
 Oh , thank God . Thank you , I'll be right back . 
 Which terms ? 
 Good . I will add this to the contract . 
 Well , you are right . Is there anything else ? 
 Well , we have agreed on all the major points . 
 Sure . I'll do it after lunch . What length do you need ? 
 Yes , no problem . It'll be ready by 2 p . m . 
 I've always liked to draw and paint . 
 I do it every once in a while . 
 I first learned how to do it in high school . 
 That was my favorite class . 
 Thanks . 
 You have a talent . You just don't know what it is yet . 
 I come from England . 
 It's mild , but it's not always pleasant.The weather's often cold in the North and windy in the East . It's often wet in the West and sometimes warm in the South . 
 I like spring and summer . The days are long and the nights are short . The sun rises early and sets late . I don't like autumn and winter . The days are short and the nights are long . The sun rises late 
 Are there any people who speak English ? 
 I had fun talking to you . 
 I think we should really do something sometime . 
 What do you want to do next time ? 
 Yeah , let's do that . 
 I'll call you so we can set that up . 
 All right , see you . 
 Good evening . Where have you come from ? 
 May I have your passport and form I - 94 , please ? 
 What's the nature of your visit ? Business or pleasure ? 
 How long are you going to stay in the United States ? 
 What is your occupation ? 
 Do you have a return ticket ? 
 That's fine . Thanks . Enjoy your trip . 
 Where to , ma'am ? 
 The Grand Hotel ? 
 No , Madam . I don't think I do . 
 Oh , yes . I know where it is . 
 No , I haven't , but I've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper . 
 Either something in the hotel business or something to do with travel . 
 I know . But I'd like to try . Look , here are some advertisements that I've cut out . 
 Not at all . Go ahead . 
 Not really , so long as you follow all the regulations . 
 No . Everyone has a chance to correct his or her mistakes . The most important thing is to be responsible for your work . 
 Yes . That's true . We are always busy . The company attaches great importance to high efficiency . Sometimes we have to work overtime , but not always . And we have extra pay for extra work . 
 What wrong with you ? You look pale ? 
 When did the trouble start ? 
 It sounds like you ’ re coming down with the flu . Let me take your temperature . 
 Yes . Thirty-eight point seven . Do you have a headache , chestache or throat pain ? 
 Now , Let me have a look at you . I ’ d like to listen to your chest . Breathe then , deep breath , that ’ s it . Cough , now again . I want to exam your throat too . Open wide , say A . 
 Yes , It does look a bit sore.Let ’ s take your extra way of your chest and give you a few tests . 
 The tests showed nothing wrong . a slight by infection . 
 I ’ m giving you some antibiotic and aspirin . Taking aspirin when you ’ Ve got a fever and take one antibiotic until four hours and go home lie in bed for two days . Take some water then you feel better . 
 We need to work is because we need money to live . We need money for food and clothes and to pay for house . We need money for many different things , and only when we work , we can earn money . And work can also help us feel that we are useful . 
 Yes , it is really hard . But you must believe that you will find a suitable job finally . When you work , you can accumulate a lot of experience . Besides , you need to learn a lot of things while you are working . 
 But whether you like it or not , there ’ s a trend of life-long study to make sure that we can keep ourselves up with the high developing society . And you need to accept this concept positively . 
 You have no choice , so you'd better adjust your thoughts to be ready to learn anything at any time . 
 Four ports . 
 Perhaps she makes about 25 knots an hour . 
 I don't feel very good . 
 They give me no help at all . 
 You have been so busy these months . What are you up to ? 
 What'll it be today , sir ? 
 Shall we check your oil and tires ? 
 ( The attendants fill the tank , clean the windscreen , and add some air to the tires . ) All right , sir , that'll be $ 26.50 . 
 Have you got some nice apples in stock today ? 
 Are they sweet ? 
 How much are they ? 
 All right , I'll have a dozen of the dollar ones . 
 Do you have any tangerines ? I'd like to have two kilograms . 
 How much is it in all ? 
 What kind of life do you prefer , city life or country life ? 
 But it doesn't have all the modern convenience offered by the city . 
 What do you think about our company ? 
 Why do you think so ? 
 In what business are you most interested in this organization ? 
 Excuse me , do you have any English songs ? 
 Great , thanks . 
 Oh , I see . 
 Could I see your ID , please , sir ? 
 Thank you , sir . Now , do you have a credit card , sir ? 
 I'm sorry , sir . Only VISA or MasterCard . 
 Thank you . Your room number is 507 , queen bed , nonsmoking . Is that agreeable to you , sir ? 
 Very good . Here is your room key , sir . If you need anything at all , please dial 0 . 
 Do you have anything which can prevent wrinkles and freckles ? 
 My skin is kind of oily . 
 How much is it ? 
 Sounds good . What are the gifts attaching ? 
 I will choose the tonic . 
 That's the very thing I want . 
 Yes , just tinned meat . 
 No , it ’ s beef . 
 Well , you ’ d better heat it before you eat it . 
 Yes . I would like to cash my travelers ' check . Here you are . 
 In tens and twenties , please . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Let me check.Well , in October . 
 We assure you that shipment will be made no later than the first half of October . 
 Morning . 
 Yes . You can take No . 846 from here , but you have to get off at Nanchengmen stop and change to No . 106 . 
 Actually , if you go to the bus stop in the next block , you can take No . 105 which will let you right off in front of the zoo gate . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Great ! I'd love to get a little better discount than 6 % , but if your company provides the insurance , that will save us a few bucks ... 
 No ... We shouldn't have any problem with that . I know we talked about a possibility for 90 days , but we won't be needing that after your discounted price . 
 Great ! 
 No . What is that street charming for ? 
 Welcome to Jinyuan Shoe Town . What can I do for you ? 
 White ? What make do you want ? Arid what size ? 
 Adidas ? They wear well . Try this pair , Size 38 , please . 
 Okay . What about this one ? 
 You are so lucky . They are on sale today . It costs only 250 yuan . Pay at the counter over there . 
 R :: Good morning . Room Reservations . May I help you ? 
 R :: Thank you , sir . For which date and how many guests will there be in your party ? 
 R :: From April 16th to 20th.And which kind of room would you prefer , sir ? 
 Could you hold the line please ? I ’ ll check our room availability . ( After a while ) Thank you for waiting , sir . We have a twin room at US $ 180 per night , will that be all right ? 
 Thank you , sir . May I have your name and phone number , please ? 
 R :: Mr . Aaron Johnson , phone number is 3242-5827 . Excuse me , how do you spell your first name ?

 Let's go to the lake and camp on the south side . 
 Let's just rent one this time . The AC is broken in the truck , remember ? 
 Should we call the Olsen's and ask them if they want to join us ? 
 Then you go out to the garage and check out the camping gear . 
 Hi , Dr Evans . Thanks for seeing me on such short notice . When I woke up this morning I had a really sore throat and a really bad cough . I think I am coming down with the flu . 
 Ahhhhhhhh 
 A little actually . My sinuses are a little blocked up as well-I really feel terrible . 
 Whoa ! So many drugs . . . I hate swallowing pills . Am I able to go to work ? 
 Ok ! Would you mind writing me a doctor ’ s note for work , otherwise they may think I am faking it ! 
 Thanks doc , bye ! 
 I finished Young Primary School in 1998 , and entered Xi ’ an Middle School that same September . I graduated from there in July of 2004 , and that September I entered Wuhan University , where I'm studying now . 
 I think I have a good understanding of fundamentals in the areas your company deals with , and I can go on from here to build up the specific skills and knowledge I need to do my job well . 
 Yes . I did some work on that , and I found out some really interesting things about the conductivity of liquid helium . I was sure I had a great discovery until my teacher told me the same discovery already made twenty years ago . I think the most important thing , I learnt though , was the importance of keeping good records . 
 Well , it's not how much , but what I'm going to buy that matters . I'm going ski shopping ! 
 No . The front seat folds down all the way so there's just enough space for the skis ... 
 Not unless you lose about 100 pounds ... 
 Excuse me . May I have a bus map , please ? 
 Yes , within New York . 
 Thank you . 
 What I cannot put up with is that they may even give me a back talk . 
 Excuse me , Mr . Graham ? I have something I need to discuss with you . 
 I would really appreciate it if we could talk for a few minutes now . It ’ s about the overtime you ’ Ve asked me to put in . 
 Watch out ! 
 Here is the final draft of our contract . I'm glad that we have reached an agreement on almost every term in our trade . 
 Do you have some points to bring up ? 
 Yes , including a description of the shirts you want to purchase this time , the total amount of your order , the price for each piece , mode of payment , packaging , shipping time , insurance and compensation , claim and arbitration , and rights and duties for both sides . Are all the terms here satisfactory ? 
 It is said that the sample 25 is the standard for others . It's complete . So would you like to sign the contract right now ? 
 It's our pleasure . 
 I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It's unbelievable . 
 He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . 
 I've told him how to do that several times , but he's never listened to me . 
 Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff . 
 Oh , so bad . I'm afraid I'll change the image of myself . 
 But sometimes they offer some useless proposals , it's awfully useless . 
 That's right . I should speak to them in a polite way . 
 Thanks very much and you're very eloquent . 
 Hello . What can I do for you today ? 
 Really ? Have you checked everything carefully ? 
 Ah , I see . The goods description is totally different from what you are expecting , right ? 
 Usually , if the problem is insignificant I advise the customer to go ahead ; it's normally a translation problem or something like that . But this does seem a little more serious . I suggest you get back on to them right now and ask them about it . Hopefully you can sort it out over the phone . 
 How much is this ? 
 The large one . 
 Is this the only kind you have ? 
 Oh , yes . I think I'll look at those over there before I decide . 
 you're finally here ! What took so long ? 
 it's always rather congested down there during rush hour . Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home . 
 perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work . 
 it would be better for the environment , too . 
 taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well . 
 well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides . 
 so , are you going to quit driving to work then ? 
 May I show you to your room ? 
 Here , let me help you with your bags . 
 Good morning . Venus Real Estate Agency . 
 Do you have any particular type of apartment in mind ? 
 Are you renting it alone or with company ? 
 A one-bedroom apartment has one bedroom , a living room , a kitchen and a bathroom . 
 No , but a fridge and a stove . 
 Yes , it ’ s a one-year lease . And $ 200 a week with one month refundable deposit . 
 Would Friday morning be alright ? 
 Good-bye . 
 I wonder if you can help me . 
 Please wake me up at seven tomorrow morning . 
 Mr . Lee in Room 1234 . 
 Would you like it rare , medium or well-done ? 
 May I have a reservation ? 
 I've got three guests today . We'd like a table next to the window . 
 I'm Chen Liang . 
 We may come at 6:30 p . m . 
 Goodbye . 
 No , I'm not clear . 
 Don't make a fuss.The price is rising 
 First , she needs to be hard-working . Second , she has to be able to do a lot ot things on her own initiative . 
 Great . We will give you a chance to have an interview in our company . 
 I can ’ t give you a definite answer . Let ’ s play it by ear . 
 You ’ re welcome . Would you like some cold dishes ? 
 Ok , and anything to drink ? Maybe some jasmine tea ? 
 And for your main course ? I can recommend the sizzling beef . 
 Oh , that ’ s a good choice . Very healthy too . 
 Oh , Thank you . I'm looking for the train station . 
 Right ? OK , got it . 
 Next left then right ? OK . 
 Yes , I have . In fact , I had worked for a foreign trade company for nearly two years , where I established business ties with several firms . 
 Visit customers , dispatch consignments and things like that . 
 Yes , I did . 
 I left it two months ago . I didn't think I could learn much there , and there were not many opportunities for self-development . 
 I've been informed that there are many opportunities to develop myself in your company . Besides , I grew up in a city in the Northeast . I have lots of acquaintances in the region , which might help to push sales . 
 Yes . It's very convenient and the price is even lower . 
 You should open an account at the online bank first . After that , you can buy anything online . 
 Sure . You can find everything all over the world . Let's check it out online ! 
 Yeah , this one is very famous with a good credit among on-line customers . It's like an open free market . If you want to change your cellphone for a new one , you can sell the old one here . 
 Take some pictures of the thing you want to sell , then upload it onto line with a brief description about it and leave your connecting number . Then your stuff will be sold by auction . 
 Let's click to check it out . 
 No doubt about it . Shopping online will get more and more popular . It's a real revolution about people's consuming habits . 
 It takes some time for the stuff you buy online to arrive . But I think this problem will be solved soon . 
 Definitely . I Ve got the hell out of the company . Anything new ? 
 Really ? Are you willing to recommend me for the position ? 
 I appreciate the effort , sir . 
 I ’ m glad you like it . 
 The rent is $ 1050 each month . 
 It isn ’ t too much . 
 I can ’ t take that . 
 I honestly don ’ t know what else to tell you . 
 If you can ’ t afford $ 1050 , then we have no deal . 
 I don't mind really.Perhaps a job in a shop or a factory . 
 That sounds all right . 
 What do you think are the main causes of war today ? 
 It seems that a lot of wars nowadays are really civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country . 
 How do you think they could be ended ? 
 So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a programme to make the country richer . If the problem is resources , share them . 
 Yes . It is . One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive . 
 Hello , it's nice to meet you . 
 You're welcome . 
 Is there a problem ? 
 That's great news . 
 She isn't messing up in class ? 
 Well , I'm so glad to hear that she's doing well . 
 Can you pass me the lighter ? 
 Look ! Allen has the mike ! 
 That was before he heard Stanley sing ! I guess he couldn't stand it anymore , so he decided to give it a try himself ! Allen has a really good voice ! He sounds like Enrique Iglesias ! 
 Do you have anything to declare ? 
 Are these all your personal things ? 
 Please open the black case . 
 I think this suit displays your nice finger . 
 No problem . 
 Of course not , it is made of pure silk . 
 I told you to hold my calls . I ’ m very busy at the moment . 
 Okay . Put her through . 
 I'm sorry to make you wait . What did you decide ? 
 Trust me , it's worth it . With the " Love , Amy Card " , you'll get a 20 percent discount on everything in the store , every time you shop ! 
 Yes ! And there are more bargains . See these pajamas ? If you buy a pair now , you get this teddy bear as a gift ! 
 May I borrow your typewriter ? 
 Until the end of the week . 
 So Vicky , how long have you held your present position ? 
 And how do you like working for IBM ? 
 What ’ s strength do you bring to the job ? 
 That ’ s good . We always need team players here . 
 Yes . My home freezer is not working properly . 
 It keeps running all the time , never stopping . And it makes a strange sound . All the ice cream inside it melted . 
 Can you send the technician to check it out ? 
 Okay . I ’ ll pay the charges . 
 My number is 627-555-1234 . 
 Thank you . Good bye . 
 Excuse me , do the buses stop here ? 
 I want to go to Broadway and 82nd Street . Can I take any bus that comes along ? 
 How often do the buses run ? 
 Fine.How long does it take to get to 82nd Street ? 
 Yes , I am . I arrived only three days ago from Japan . 
 I like it very much , but it's a little confusing to me . 
 Thank you for the information . 
 I ’ Ve decided to grow my own garden ! 
 On the contrary , I have been reading a lot of books about the subject . 
 Well , first I need to buy some things , such as fertilizer , seeds and tools . 
 You know , the basics . A rake , shovel , spade and a hoe . 
 I ’ ll till the soil and then sow the seeds . I ’ ll then add some fertilizer and voila ! Gardening all done ! 
 Have you seen Bill recently ? 
 Daisy ’ s in hospital too . She god food poisoning last week . She thinks she got it from some bad seafood . 
 He ’ s fine , but he had a fever last week . He probably just had a cold . 
 I see . My niece just flew back from Australia to visit . She ’ s got jetlag now . she ’ s just resting today , but we ’ ll probably go out somewhere tomorrow . 
 Oh , your hand is still sore . You should put some ointment on it to stop the swelling . 
 Yes , I banged it against to cooker yesterday . It really hurt , but it ’ s OK now . the bruise will disappear soon . 
 I think my greatest accomplishment has been acquiring the Hans account . 
 Yes , it took a year and a lot of initiative to get that account . 
 The last two years we have seen an increase in sales of about 30 % to 40 % each year , so I ’ m very pleased . And our sales projections are quite good for the next two years . 
 Hmm ... I think I am ready for a new challenge . I've put a good team together at my present company , and I think If I want to take the next step in my career , it's time for me to move on . 
 Haven't been sleeping well recently . 
 Every night my roommates watch the Korean soap operas till mid-night . I am not a big fan of Korean shows and I don't know how to tell them to stop without hurting their feelings . 
 Yeah , I know , but I find these sorts of things hard to say . They won't like it if I tell them to turn off the TV . Now I just hope the show will end soon . 
 Yeah , I crave my own space . I just get so tiredhaving people around me all the time . We all need our private space . But I also think interpersonal skills very important . Living in a dorm means you have to learn to be considerate of others , otherwise nobody is going to have a good time . 
 Has all the work done by men been replaced by automatic computers ? 
 Excuse me , what is this ? 
 Are the batteries in it made by your people ? 
 What kind of battery is it ? 
 After you've thought it over , get back to me and we can go ahead . 
 It is higher than the rate of interest for Current Deposits and a little lower than the rate for the 6 - month time deposits . 
 First of all , you need to sign a Corporate Agreement Savings Contract with us . This means we can go ahead and open an account of agreement savings based on your settlement account . 
 I'm really sorry , but I seem to have misplaced your towel . 
 I'm very sorry . Can I get you another one ? 
 You're here today to argue your ticket ? 
 Plead your case . 
 Were you speeding when you got pulled over ? 
 How fast were you going ? 
 Well , seeing as the officer that pulled you over isn't here , I'll let you go . 
 No , you don't . 
 Okay Rebecca , well I think you ’ Ve given me a clear impression of your positive qualities , but let ’ s talk a little bit about your weaknesses . 
 Definitely , but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be ? 
 So would you say if things don ’ t go your way at work it could easily get you down ? 
 Well , you know journalism is a highly competitive world , so you do need to keep pushing yourself it ’ s true . Okay , well let ’ s move on to talk about the job position here , shall we ? 
 How many people are in your family ? 
 I have one daughter and one son . Then there ’ s my husband and I . What about your parents ? Do they live with your family ? 
 My parents live by themselves now . When they get older , they ’ ll probably go to a retirement home . Do you just have one brother ? 
 I also grew up in a big family . I have one older brother and three younger sisters . 
 About seven years now . and you ? 
 It ’ s becoming more and more common . However , I don ’ t ever want to get divorced myself ! What about you ? 
 If that happens , maybe you could marry my brother and we could become in-laws ! 
 Of course not ! 
 Well , I know you ’ re pretty booked up these days . But , we ’ Ve got to work fast on this . 
 Let me see . That ’ s no problem . I ’ ll see you then . 
 I feel dizzy and weak . And I'm having this pain in my ear . I think I am sick . 
 No , this is the second time . 
 Why this happens to me when I am on the plane ? I feel bad . 
 What should I do about it ? 
 OK , thanks . Does it work really ? I'll give a try . 
 Much better . Thank you . I just feel tired but I can't fall asleep . 
 I am not used to wearing that . Thanks . 
 Thank you so much . 
 Did you hear that they are going to start an exercise class after work ? 
 Next month . I think . Are you going to sign up ? 
 This visit is over for me . Here's your room key . 
 And thanks to you . 
 I'd be willing to try this hotel again , if you can promise me no more cockroaches . 
 Hi I came in on flight 513 . Everyone else took their luggage off the conveyor belt , but mine didn ’ t seem to be there . 
 You ’ re kidding . What am I going to do ? 
 You can reach me at 13661306917 . 
 That ’ s ok . There wasn ’ t anything important in there anyway . The shaving kit more than makes up for my lost luggage . 
 I ’ Ve had a lot worse problems than this traveling so it ’ s really no big deal . 
 Guess again , Dave . I have no intention of leaving invoking . Never did . 
 That's right , Dave . I tricked you into giving a confession . And I've recorded every word of it . 
 I saw your green post-it notes . Nobody else has them . 
 I ’ Ve only find a few openings in my field . 
 Unfortunately not . If I can ’ t find anything in that field , then I could also work in the marketing field . 
 Yes . 
 Really ? What is it ? 
 Do you think they'd hire me ? 
 Hi , Bob , what time will you be home tonight ? 
 Why ? What's the problem ? 
 Thank you for your application , Mr . Sweeney . Mr . Jacobs would like to set up an interview for early next week . Do you have time ? 
 Fine . Let me take a look at his schedule . He ’ s free on Tuesday afternoon at 1:30 . Could you come in then ? 
 Hello , I would like to make an appointment to look at houses . 
 I would prefer mornings . 
 Going to look at houses during the week is best for me . 
 I will meet you at the real estate office . 
 That sounds good to me . 
 Something ’ s burning ? 
 Mm , I love burnt bread . 
 But I prefer burnt bread . 
 Wonderful ! A perfect piece of bread ! 
 I am looking for a blouse . Can you show me the way , please ? 
 I have no idea . Could you recommend me one ? 
 Well , the style is quite good , but I think it's too showy . I would like to try on the lighter one . 
 Yeah . There's an express that leaves in twenty minutes . 
 Sure . 
 Go to window number eleven . 
 I'd like a refund on this sweater . 
 Oh , here you are . 
 What kind of job are you interested in ? 
 I really appreciate that I would expect my secretary to be able to work independently and take over some of my ordinary responsibilities , such as answering routine correspondence , taking phone calls for me and sometimes assisting me with personal affairs . 
 Have you had any experience as a guide ? 
 Once in a while we have visitors from abroad and I would like to be able to ask my secretary to take them shopping and sightseeing . 
 Hi , Bill . It's Marsha Black at MPPD Ltd . How are you ? 
 Not too bad at all . Do you have a minute ? 
 We're getting ready to place our Christmas orders and we need to know about how much it's going to run this year.You know , so we can have the funds put aside . 
 Right , a ballpark figure is fine , and slant it a little high if you have to . 
 It's going to be shown to the Board so I need it in writing.Make all the prices subject to confirmation so you can't be held to them . How soon can I have it ? 
 Yeah , I'm afraid so . I really need your help here . 
 I played the video game at Mike's home yesterday . 
 It's really fantastic . The hero , Super Warrior , is so brave that he can defeat any enemies he meets . He runs through tunnels , swims under water , and climbs over bridges . It's really exciting ! 
 I borrowed it from Mike yesterday . Why not have a try ? 
 Oh , this is Monica 
 Yes . Let's first define the inspection right . 
 Would you tell me how the inspection is conducted before shipment and by which agency ? 
 And can you tell me about the re-inspection ? 
 I see . How do they make testing and analysis of this item ? 
 What if the results from the two inspections do not coincide with each other ? 
 Do you often buy magazines ? 
 Why don ’ t you find the information on the internet instead ? 
 Do you have an online edition of that magazine ? 
 Do you have a subscription ? 
 I only buy them if they look particularly interesting . I don ’ t buy any regularly . 
 How much is this pen ? 
 And how much is this pencil ? 
 Here's fifteen Yuan . 
 OK , that's right . 
 OK . 
 Ok . I ’ m really bored at the moment . 
 Does he have a moustache or a beard ? 
 Sounds like Mike , is it ? 
 Right . She ’ s not very tall and she ’ s quite plump . She ’ s got blonder hair , but I don ’ t know what color her eyes are . 
 Well , I don't find her attractive , but I'm sure you will disagree . 
 She ’ s got tiny feet and wears really unfashionable shoes . In fact , she wears unfashionable clothes too . 
 She ’ s your mother ! 
 I think that unfortunately it ’ s more important than a person ’ s character . Advertising and stuff tells us that we have to be attractive . I think it ’ s wrong , but that ’ s the way the world is now . 
 Well , you certainly didn ’ t choose her because of her looks ! Hey , I was joking ! Don ’ t hit me ! 
 Promise you are not going to be angry ? 
 I forgot . 
 Ah , ah , you promised , and remember ? 
 Would you show me your notice ? 
 Please endorse it first . Do you have identification ? 
 I put in two quarters for a coke , but nothing came out of the machine . 
 I'm sure it's broken . 
 What can I help you with today ? 
 Will that be cash or check ? 
 Could you sign the back of the check , please ? 
 Would you like any cash back ? 
 How much would you like ? 
 Here is your $ 150 . 
 Tu Mao , I'm hungry , let's get something to eat . 
 There's a Kentucky's not far ahead and there's a McDonald's in down street . 
 Don't you know about Kentucky's ? 
 They sell pieces of fried chicken , you've got to try one this time . 
 I really hope to reach an agreement with you today that is suitable and beneficial for us both . I've thought through a lot of these details , and I hope we can have a chance to discuss them and resolve any differences this afternoon . 
 Firstly , we'd like to discuss a discounted price . If you can give us a discount of 7 % on the high volumes orders , we can pay in 60 days . 
 Well , that might be acceptable , if you handle the insurance fees . 
 We cover the insurance and half the transport fee , and only have a discount of 4 % . 
 Done ... 
 Yes , I'd like to make an appointment to see the doctor . My name is Randy Horn . 
 Yeah , I guess I can survive until tomorrow . 
 In the morning , if possible . 
 That would be fine . 
 The new year is coming . Is the final examination approaching . 
 How are you getting along with your studies ? 
 But your were playing video games all afternoon . You are skating on thin ice . 
 NO ! 
 Okay , okay , what do you want ? 
 Um .. I don ’ t think so . I need the car tonight to pick up your mother . 
 Who's this Eric guy ? 
 No can do ... sorry . 
 No way ! 
 What's wrong with you ? 
 Don't worry . I'll write you a prescription for a new medicine that works wonders . 
 When it comes to select a fund , you will always read Past performance is not an indication of future results , can you believe that ? 
 If you refuse to take risk , you can ’ t have better returns . 
 Mr . Zhang , are you still there ? 
 Can she call you back ? She is about to start a meeting . 
 Hi , Alan . I feel very nervous because I am going to have a job interview next Monday . Could you please give me some suggestions ? 
 Yeah , that is very important . 
 I will try my best to make a good impression , but it is always easier said that done . 
 Can I wear T-shirt and jeans for the job interview ? 
 I've got it . I think I will wear a white shirt with a tie . Thank you for your suggestions . 
 Really ? I'm glad to hear that . 
 Thank you again for your visit . We are looking forward to your reply . 
 We are happy that we have established business relations . I really hope that we'll have more business to do and more opportunities to meet each other . 
 You are very nice and helpful . Hope to see you again . 
 OK , I think it's time for you to check in . If you run into any difficulty , we'll be here to assist you immediately . 
 Goodbye . 
 Yes , we really enjoyed it . 
 Yes , that sounds great . 
 The apple crisp sounds great . 
 Good suggestion . Could you please bring us a chocolate mousse cake and four dessert forks , please ? 
 Let's have four coffees , please . 
 Thank you ! We have really enjoyed our meal here . 
 How long have you got ? 
 Okay , I'll make you some food . 
 Sure , what time will you like to depart ? 
 Actually , one just left ten minutes ago . The next one is at two forty-five , debates at five thirty-five . 
 Sure , that will be thirty-two dollars please . 
 Don't mention it . 
 See you . 
 Yes.please . 
 Oh , my god . 
 I hope so . 
 But it's the White House . The president and his family live there.They won't let us see most of it . Probably we can only see a couple of rooms . 
 Hmm . If that's true , then the security there must be very good.Because it's strange to think they will let people walk around in the White House . 
 So I can't take my gun then . 
 Yes , it's true I don't . 
 What ? Do you think someone will arrest me for making a joke ? Someone will arrest me here at the breakfast table ? 
 I'll be careful . Don't worry . I don't want to get arrested by the FBI.But how long does the White House tour last ? 
 Alright . We should take a taxi over there right after breakfast . 
 That's a good idea . Do you want some more coffee ? 
 I really want to go to China for vacation , but I can't find a cheap plane ticket . 
 No , not yet . Can you find a good price there ? 
 Well , you don't have to be mean . How do I do it ? 
 Ok , thanks . I'll let you know what I find . 
 I ’ ll look for a ticket for you , too . Thanks ! 
 Well , we try ! Here , I just made some carrot juice . Would you like a glass ? 
 You don't have to go to the mountains ! I stand on my head during my yoga routine every morning ! 
 Have a good day at school ! See you tonight ! 
 What kind of car do you want ? 
 Mazda . Honda and Nissan . 
 Could I have a word with you , Madam ? 
 I have to tell you that I can't be in today and tomorrow . 
 I feel sick and coughed a lot at night . 
 Yes , I did this in the morning . And my doctor wanted me to have a rest these two days . 
 I hope so . And I will definitely tell you if I can not . 
 You voted , right ? 
 Who did you vote for ? 
 Can you believe that he actually won ? 
 I didn ’ t think he would . 
 I figured people wouldn ’ t vote for him because he ’ s African American . 
 You ’ re absolutely right . 
 Do you drive a car yourself ? 
 Great ! When you become new driver , you are better drive as carefully as possible ! 
 Besides , traffic signal in downtown area are very annoying , are they ? 
 Now , we are out of the town , you can drive freely ! 
 Why not ? 
 Yes , We are going to across real road . 
 What other signs what we see in road area like this ? 
 Hello.Is this ABC Rent-a-car Company ? 
 This morning we rented a car and we are on the way to Niagara Falls . I'm afraid we have a car accident near the border . 
 I'm all right , but my friend is seriously injured.Will you call an ambulance and the police ? 
 I ran into the guardrail when I turned to the left . 
 Welcome to ABC Company . We have been expecting you , please have a seat . I will call him . 
 Mr . Thomas will be here very soon . In the meantime , may I ask all of you to sign in so that I can issue your passes ? 
 Yes , please . Please print your name and company name , and the person you are going to see . 
 Where'd the rest of your money for the bus go ? 
 Well , that was an intelligent thing to do . 
 No , I don't . 
 You should just ask the bus driver for a transfer . 
 It's free ; just go ask for one . 
 No problem , just go ask . 
 Which credit card are you speaking of ? 
 We sent that bill out a couple of weeks ago . 
 Your bill was mailed already . 
 If you haven't gotten it yet , then you should probably take that up with your post office . 
 If that's the case , you will need to provide proof of their mistake . 
 Don't mention it . Call back if you have any more questions . 
 Oh . Thanks a million . 
 How beautiful ! I love it at all . 
 It's very kind of you . I really don't know how I can thank you enough . 
 I was wondering if you could go over the services available at EDD to help me get a job . 
 Do I have to have a computer at home ? 
 Do you have any other services available ? 
 What kinds of workshops are available at the EDD ? 
 Are there other places , outside of EDD , that I may look for work ? 
 Good morning , sir , can I help you ? 
 I'd be glad to , sir . But may I ask what line of business you are in ? 
 I see . Would you be interested in seeing the audio-visual products ? They are made by our company . 
 Yes , of course . Would you like to make an inspection tour of some factories ? 
 I'll make the arrangement and let you know the time tomorrow .

 It ’ s on the first floor . 
 You are very welcome . 
 Just myself . What is the rate ? 
 Fine . Do I have to show my passport ? 
 Sure . 
 Yes , please bring us two steaks . 
 What vegetables come with the steaks ? 
 How could we advertise our celebrations to mark the centenary of the founding of the university ? 
 That ’ s a good idea . We could put up some posters in and around the campus with a list of events . It would be quite cheap to do on the campus . 
 We could contact alumni who work for large , well-know companies . They might be able to arrange cheap advertising in exchange for some free tickets . 
 We should put some information about it on the home page of our university website . When people visit the website , they ’ ll see the information . 
 Ok . Let ’ s get to work on our advertising campaign . 
 Speaking , Who ’ s calling please ? 
 Oh , Hi Tom , how have you been ?

 Sounds like a good idea .

 As well my company has been very supportive about my decision.They ' Ve cut back my working hours in order to accommodate my studies . 
 They are.We definitely see eye-to eye on my enhanced performance being a win-win situation for everyone involved . 
 I'm pretty good . 
 Did you get your learner's permit yet ? 
 Do you have any experience driving a car ? 
 Do you know all the controls in the car ? 
 When do you want to start learning how to drive ? 
 We can do it tomorrow ; just call me . 
 Not bad . Everything goes well . 
 Excuse me , where is my cabin ? 
 Of course . Here you are . 
 Can you direct the place for me ? 
 I see . Thank you . 
 Would you please wrap the shoes first ? I would like to buy a sweater . 
 How much does the green one cost ? 
 OK . I will take it as well . How much in all ? 
 Why don't you find someone who is in the know . 
 Did you ask his former sectary , Lora ? She knows a lot about him .

 Do you want to order an appetizer first ? 
 OK . What are you going to have to eat ?

 I'm not that hungry . I think I'm just going to have a salad . 
 Sure . No problem . 
 I certainly have . 
 About two hours ago . 
 I couldn't . I was bound and gagged . 
 I was sitting in this room watching television when someone knocked on the door . Without thinking , I opened it . 
 I know . I was expecting my wife , you see , and thought it was her . 
 Yes , I know . I regret it very much . 
 Two men pushed into the flat . One of them threatened me with a knife while the other bound and gagged me . 
 I'm afraid not . They were both wearing stockings over their faces . 
 My wallet , with $ 200 in it , my wrist watch.some of my wife's jewellery from our bedroom , and a silver photoframe . 
 No . They had just begun to search when the dogs next door began to bark . Theran off then leaving me bound and gagged . It was some time before my wifereturned and released me . I phoned the police at o

 And anything to drink ? 
 How do you like your coffee ? 
 Then how about the wine ? Is white wine OK ? 
 Thanks for the advice , Mr . Macmillan . I ’ ll keep it in mind . I had better head off though . I ’ m meeting my husband for dinner . 
 Thanks , sir . You too . Drive safely , I hear there ’ s a lot ice on the roads . 
 Excuse me , may I have the bill , please ? 
 Can I pay by private check ? 
 Happy New Year , Rose . 
 Thank you , I will . What are you up to today ? 
 Sure , why not . Sounds like fun . Why are you going to church ? 
 What for ? 
 They must have got in through the kitchen window . 
 I am afraid your diamond bracelet has gone , darling ! 
 look ! they've taken your fur coat too . 
 I noticed they've taken our radio and left the television . 
 Sure . How about this one ? 
 Yes . We have both the paperback and the hardcover . 
 The hardcover is more expensive . 
 How do I order the office supplies that I need ? 
 I need many things . 
 I can wait a few days for these items . 
 I don't think we have very much money for supplies , but we have a little . 
 I am not sure yet . 
 Good-bye ! 
 But it ’ s so pretty . 
 It ’ s not the same . It ’ s completely different . 
 I really like this one . 
 Yeah . It ’ s pretty . 
 Yes . We are a foreign-invested company and there are many chances to go abroad .

 What do you want to know ? 
 Well , I was born in Shanghai and went to school there , right up through college . My father is a lawyer , and my mother is a teacher . 
 That right . One of my sisters is a doctor and the other one teaches at a university . 
 Oh , nothing in particular , I guess . I always liked mathematics and tinkering with machines . 
 More than five years now . After I did my engineering degree , I began to specialize in computer technology and I even had my own company for a while . 
 Thanks very much . 
 Thanks , doc . I ’ Ve got a really bad toothache ! I can ’ t eat anything , and look , my face is all swollen . I think it might be my wisdom tooth . 
 Is it gonna hurt ? 
 Should I go now ? 
 Nothing is happening ! 
 What do these other letters mean ? 
 Let's sell our stocks now . 
 I have a feeling they're about to go down in a few days . 
 First , you should check the schedule and see which trains go to Suzhou . Make sure which train you want to take and book a ticket . 
 It depends on which train do you take . 
 Yes , it stops more than ten times on the way to Suzhou . 
 About fifteen hours . 
 Sure , Stacy . Let me just grab my coat . 
 Don ’ mention it . I ’ m glad to help . 
 I ’ m afraid not . Don ’ t you see I ’ m looking up a word in the dictionary ? 
 Well , wait a minute . 
 Wait for a moment . Mr . Bush.this is your bill , please sign your name here 
 I am sorry , we will connect with the room service.Please Warta moment . 
 Well , we could eat in more . That 300 dollars for entertainment is mostly going to restaurants . 
 No , I need my books . 
 Well , what about the 50 you spent on a shirt ? You could have gotten something for less . 
 All right . That sounds fair . 
 Annie , you also know the ' new age people ' . I think these people must have undergone much sufferings of flesh in order to ride skillfully . 
 The skateboard does not pollute the air , either . It can be used as a tool to ride instead of walk . 
 That is very kind of you , Mr Lee . Thank you . 
 Of course . It ’ s a terrible night , isn ’ t it ? 
 Thank you . 
 Well , Mary types faster than Jones . But I think Jones types more carefully . 
 Jones can certainly take down letter more quickly , but Mary ’ s short hand is the best in her class . 
 Both of them speak excellent French . But I think Mary speaks German more fluently than Jones does . 
 Hi , Kerry . Did your husband make cooking for you ? 
 Really ? Was it delicious ? 
 It was the first time . You should not be so particular . 
 It ’ s true . Nowadays , men are spending more and more time in the kitchen . 
 Excuse me , I ’ m sorry to trouble you . My name is Susan Ransom , and I have placed several orders with you company . 
 Well , I wonder if you could track an order I placed with you last month . It hasn ’ t arrived yet . 
 This room is unacceptable . I want a new one , and I want a refund for tonight . 
 I'm being attacked by hordes of cockroaches ! 
 Thank you very much . This has been a most unsettling experience . 
 Hello , Steven , what are you doing now ? 
 Can I be of any help to you ? 
 I hate balloons . 
 No problem . 
 Do I have to get up now ? 
 What are you talking about ? My alarm hasn ’ t even gone off yet . 
 I must have slept right through it . 
 Just let me sleep 5 more minutes . 
 I know . I know . But I don ’ t want any worms . 
 How did I do ? 
 Yes , I do . 
 Exactly how bad ? 
 I don't understand how I could've failed it . 
 What are the reasons ? 
 Can I take the test again ? 
 That is what we are pursuing . 
 A meeting will be arranged to negotiate the relevant stuff . 
 Are you going to vote this Tuesday ? 
 Have you figured out who you ’ re going to vote for ? 
 Why is that ? 
 Is that right ? 
 That ’ s great ! 
 Hopefully , he will be . 
 Have you met the new manager in customer service ? 
 She . She seems to be doing a pretty good job . Of course , anything would be better than that last guy ! 
 Excuse me . I lost my way . Could you tell me where the scholar cinema is , please ? 
 Is that near here ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Yes , please . That would be a great help . Are you sure you don ’ t mind ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 No , there ’ s no need . 
 No , don ’ t bother . It ’ s all right as it is . 
 Not quite . The software engineers are testing it just now . 
 Yes , most of them . We trained on a dummy system last month . A couple of people were away so we've organised two more training sessions on the live system for the whole team this week . 
 Twenty dollars and sixty cents . 
 No way . Look . That's what the meter says . 
 Mom , I didn ’ t have breast . I could eat a horse . 
 You mustn't touch the wet paint , Bill . 
 Try to be more careful in future . Look ! You ’ Ve damaged the sign . 
 It says ' No smoking here ' . 
 I see . Thank you . Sir , what kind of duties will I do ? 
 It's easy . Is there anything I can do for you , sir ? 
 I will leave a memo for you , sir . 
 Sure . 
 No problem . 
 Don't you wish to employ RIB of ours ? US Dollars might be adopted . 
 I will give you a definite answer on the price terms two days later . 
 OK . Could you please help me to clean them ? 
 Great . At first , you can put the chairs back . 
 Thank you . I'll wash them . 
 Good boy . 
 Stop picking on me . I am going to be mad . 
 For over forty years . The original company Davies Engineering - was founded in 1960 by the Davies brothers in a small workshop near Manchester . They closed down the workshop in 1980 and opened up a new factory in Leeds .

 International Air Braking Systems . 
 Well , sir . Can I take your measurements first ? 
 That'll be helpful . All right , thank you .

 Let me see , with padding and lining cloth , it comes to 357 dollars altogether . 
 In two weeks . 
 My battery's flat in my mobile . 
 And I couldn't find another phone .

 That's the opinion of most people . Do you have your passport with you ? I'll need to see that and you'll need to fill in this withdrawal form . 
 How much would you like to withdraw ? 
 That's fine . 
 Here's your money , your card and your passport . Please double check the amount for me . 
 Mr . Smith , this is your schedule . 
 Do you have any different ideas ? 
 Certainly . Let me see . Oh , it's on that self . 
 Of course . Here you are . 
 Good afternoon . How can I help you ? 
 Ok , please first fill in the form and return it to me . You can do it in the next door . 
 Everybody attention . I would like to make sure you all know the process . The interview consists of three parts .

After the break , we all come back to this office and I will announce the successful candidates for the 2nd round . In which , you have a small interview with your future manager .

 The mangoes are on sale today . 
 They have yellowish red skin . It's a fruit with one big seed . 
 Maybe if you were a parrot . I wouldn't recommend it . 
 Normally , they're $ 2 each . Today , they're only $ 1 each . 
 It's hard to describe . They're sweet , but also sort of acidity . 
 They're similar to an avocado . When the outside feels soft , they're ripe . 
 These are from Mexico . 
 My car won ’ t start ! Stupid old car ! 
 Fine . 
 Yeah ! I am here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor . 
 Yeah , it sounds like it usually does when I start the car , but nothing else happens . The engine won ’ t start . Should I maybe press the accelerator ? 
 So what do you think it is ? 
 Umm . yeah ! Right ! I got the car started ! Thanks for your help ! I told you to fill the tank ! 
 My brother-in-law is having a small get-together at his house and he invited me . 
 A bit of both . Some cousins , aunts and uncles will be there , but also some friends from the neighborhood . 
 Yeah he is going to be there with his step-son and his ex-wife . 
 No , Rick is actually my great uncle , so he is my grandmother's brother . 
 I'll explain later , let's go . 
 I'll go and quit my job in the ABC Company . 
 I'm afraid not , but can you make it Thursday afternoon ? 
 Yes . See you then . 
 Can't you see ? I'm practicing tai chi ! 
 I'm just a beginner . Did my poses make me the butt of jokes ? 
 So , is there anything wrong with my strokes ? 
 Like this ? 
 Did I do it right ? 
 What should I do with my legs then ? 
 Fantastic ! I guess the same is true with the arms , right ? 
 These are new arrivals . 
 Try them if you like . 
 What about that one over there ? 
 Hi , John , this is Mary , your tenant up in Lincoln Park . 
 I was wondering when trash collection day was . 
 Great . 
 Oh , o . k . Where ’ s that ? 
 Thanks . Who do I call for trash collection ? 
 All right . Thanks a lot . 
 We need to figure out how much money we've spent and what we've spent it on . 
 Well , I think we should save more . If we save more money we can retire earlier and enjoy our life better . 
 Let's see . We spent $ 700 for our home loan payment , $ 300 0n groceries , $ 75 0n utilities , $ 250 n gasoline , $ 100 on books , and $ 400 0n entertainment last month . 
 We put $ 500 into the savings account , and $ 750 into our stock account . 
 Right . Stop thinking about it . Where do you think we can save more money ? 
 Yeah , that's a good idea , and you like to cook . 
 Flip it to channel 9 , will you , Janet ? There's a big basketball game on in a couple of minutes . 
 Oh , yeah , smarty-pants ? Over my dead body . Now , don't be such a brat and ... 
 I don't know ! The picture went blank all of a sudden . It's probably the picture tube . 
 Yeah . Oh well , how about a game of cards instead ? 
 My name is Mary , and I will be your server this evening . 
 Can I interest you in an appetizer to start out ? 
 We have our daily appetizers listed on the board over there on the wall . 
 That would be a great choice ! 
 We have a special where you can order a second appetizer for half price . 
 This is awful ! It's like drinking saltwater ! It's like drowning in the ocean ! 
 OK , OK . 
 Maybe I'll run away first . 
 What do you do in your spare times ? 
 What sports do you like best ? 
 Do you like reading books ? 
 Who are you favourite authors ? 
 George , I heard our eighth generation computer is appreciated by the guests . They intend to sign contract with our company . You have done a good job . We are so proud of you . 
 Hah , as the sales department director , you are the best . 
 Why not ? You've done so well for the company . She should give you a prize . 
 Come on ! What are you nervous about ? 
 But the sales number is close to the predicted amount . 
 Take it easy . Be confident of yourself . I'm sure you can do it . 
 No , I had no interest in the activities in college and I spent most of my spare time reading in the library . 
 None , I guess . My only passion is on reading . 
 He is out . 
 Where did you See then last ? 
 Is it kept in hand now ? 
 Did you put this morning's faxes on my desk ? I'm waiting for some urgent faxes from headquarters , I'm pretty sure they came in last night . 
 Yeah , you're going to have to call them and get them to be re-faxed . These copies are so dark , I can't make out any of the words . 
 This one ? This one is so light I can barely read it . How can that be ? 
 Yes , but this one will have to be re-faxed as well . And look , there's about three pages missing ! It looks loke the fax machine ate half my important faxes , and the ones that made it through are so blurred or too light , they're unreadable ! 
 How do I know if there is a vacancy in a company ? 
 Which websites are most popular ? 
 Is your application successful ? 
 Where on earth will you work in ? 
 How long will you work a day ? 
 That ’ s rather hard . 
 How will you get your pay ? 
 What sort of welfare facilities does your company provide ? 
 Is there a union ? 
 So you must consider dearly before you go to work . 
 Welcome to Lincoln Bank . How may we be of service ? 
 OK , do you have the relevant materials ? 
 Right . You have a choice of account , we provide USD , HAD , JOY and GAP accounts . Which do you want to go for ? 
 OK , I'll begin the opening procedure now and we'll let you know when everything is sorted . 
 Then you've heard from Vital ? 
 Look , Vince . I didn't mean to step on your toes , but we need to be decisive . 
 This is awkward , I know . I know you're upset . But in two weeks you'll be thanking me . 
 Somebody , please answer the phone . 
 What did the boss say ? 
 You are still student so I don't think you should have time for that . 
 Okay , then . What kind of newspaper he wants you to sell ? 
 Sounds interesting . Especially that we are Olympic Volunteers . 
 And a good way to get some pocket money . 
 I'll say yes . Wait a minute . I need an IC card . 
 Yes , but I don't want my Mom to tap my phone when I call Clive . 
 Oh . 
 Sure . 
 The train ? Will I be flying back then ? 
 Will the train be very crowded ? 
 When is the first meeting then ? 
 Where will I be staying ? 
 That's very sensible . Would it be alright if I left early today to prepare for the trip ? 
 Good evening , may I help you ? 
 Sorry , sir . We have only double tables left . 
 Sure . In the middle part of the fifth street , there is a Phoenix Restaurant . Maybe you can go there . 
 I ’ m so sorry that I have got to go . I have a business appointment right now . 
 What size ? 
 What colour ? 
 I ’ m sorry . We don't haven any . 
 Did she buy them here ? 
 We had some shoes like those a month ago , but we don't have any now . 
 I ’ m afraid that I can ’ t . They were in fashion last year and the year before last . But they ’ re not in fashion this year . These shoes are in fashion now . 
 They are very uncomfortable . But women always wear uncomfortable shoes ! 
 Are you still working ? 
 If you got laid off or are working a lot fewer hours , you may qualify . 
 Not all jobs pay into unemployment insurance , so their employees cannot collect benefits . 
 You should have noticed unemployment insurance being deducted from your paycheck . Check your pay stubs . 
 The more money you made , the more you will earn on unemployment . They have a formula . 
 It wasn't as high as I would have liked . It was 2.5 . 
 I participated in several extracurricular activities . And I worked 2 jobs to put myself through school . 
 Give me some glasses please , Jane . 
 No , not those . The ones on the shelf . 
 Yes , please . 
 Thanks . 
 Could you explain in detail ? 
 How about 60 % for the first load , then 20 % each ? 
 I think so , too . Our only request is that the quality is in conformity with the contract stipulations . 
 But what will you do if the goods we receive are not standard ? 
 That's great . 
 I'm afraid this seat is taken . 
 You're welcome . If you ask the conductor when he comes by , he should help you find one . 
 Are you going home now ? 
 What are you going to do ? Are you going to work late ? 
 An apartment ? Why ? 
 Where are you living now ? 
 How are you going to find an apartment ? 
 Apartments in the city are expensive . 
 Your dog is so much fun . He ’ s so playful . I wish our cat enjoyed being around people as much as your dog does . 
 She ’ s eight years old . She ’ s getting quite old . Your dog ’ s six , isn ’ t he ? 
 I ’ m sure he would . We usually have to drag him home . 
 She spends less time outdoors and she used to . we have no idea where she goes . She ’ s very secretive . Occasionally , she brings back a dead mouse . 
 The kids want a rabbit . I don ’ t think it would be a good idea to get a mouse or a fish ! That might be too tempting for our cat ! 
 I like to travel and I also like meeting various kinds of people . 
 I have studied English , tourist culture , guiding methods and techniques and so on . 
 Yes , I have learned Japanese as well . 
 Yes , I know . But I don't mind working hard . 
 No . I only wish that you could give me a definite answer to my application as soon as possible . 
 Yes , of course . I can't wait to be there . 
 I think so . I won't forget anything important . As long as I have my passport , VISA card and airline ticket . It will be OK . 
 More than 100 times . The flight takes off at 12:00 . 
 Hi . I ’ m interested in renting a one-bedroom apartment . 
 Thank you . 
 No . 
 Yes . . . a bit . . . ouch ! 
 Yes , that hurts quite a lot . 
 NO , nothing . 
 Where ’ s the wagon ? 
 The water wagon . 
 The wagon with the water , of course . 
 No , you can ’ t do that . There isn ’ t much water in the wagon . And we need the water for drinking . 
 Sure . It ’ s quite far from here . Don ’ t worry , though . It ’ s not difficult to get there . 
 Yes . First , you need to turn around . Do you remember passing some traffic lights further up this road ? 
 That ’ s right . Drive back to the traffic rights and turn right . Follow the road for about a mile , until you see the plaza hotel . It ’ s a really big hotel . You can ’ t miss it . Turn left at the hotel . 
 Then you just go straight on until you see the station ahead of you . 
 No problem . 
 No , I'm not . 
 That ’ s all right . 
 I saw her yesterday . She was a little better . 
 No , you needn't . A number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital . 
 Yes . I caught a number 7 bus yesterday , and I had to wait for half an hour at the bus stop 
 But number 13 buses leave from the centre of town . You'll have to walk two miles to catch one . 
 Well , let's see.Why don't we go dancing for a change ? We haven't done that for a long time . 
 Hmm.Well , in that case , we could go to the movies . 
 Well , do you have any suggestions ? 
 It's OK with me , but we don't have any beer and things . 
 OK . 
 Are you all right ? 
 Good . You scared me . 
 Sure . Is this your first time skiing ? 
 Excuse me . May I take a picture of you ? 
 I just want to show my children how an American policeman looks . 
 Oh , no , it won't . Just stand there , please . 
 Do you want me to check the tires ? 
 $ 10 . 
 What was the problem ? 
 Things happen ; make sure it doesn't become a habit . 
 All right , please take this message and call this client . 
 Now does everyone understand the diagram on the board ? 
 I will explain it again ; especially for those of you who arrived late . 
 It's $ 160 . 
 Sorry , sir , we are having a sale now . 
 I am sorry , I didn ’ t catch what you said . Could you repeat it please ? 
 Sorry , my English isn ’ t so good . Could you speak a little slower ? 
 But Steven , you've called in sick 3 times during the last three weeks . 
 All right , then . But don't forget to bring a doctors note tomorrow . 
 Good afternoon , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 No problem . Please wait a minute . ( She goes to the back for a few minutes . ) Here is your medicine , sir . Take two tablets after each meal and once before bed . 
 Yes , our over-the-counter medicine is over there on that shelf . 
 Yes , right over here . 
 Here's a twenty . 
 I made a reservation three days ago.My name is George Smith . 
 That's very kind of you . 
 No , he isn't . He's an engineer , the most famous one in our company . 
 Laura told me today that she has a friend with a car for sale . 
 Yes , it's used , but she said it was in very good shape . It's a small foreign car . 
 She thinks it has about twenty-five or thirty thousand miles . 
 Three thousand dollars . 
 He lives in the city and you know how expensive it is to keep a car in the city . 
 No , but she gave me her friend's telephone number . I can call him and make an appointment . 
 Okay . But our baby has fallen sleep . 
 But where's the switch ? 
 Peter , do you want to learn to play the piano ? 
 Well , there are many boys that can play the piano very well , like Jay Chou . 
 OK . But you have to promise me that you will study hard in your English class . 
 How do you get along with your co-workers ? 
 So how do you develop good relationships in the office ? 
 I think you ’ re right , but it does seem that there are always a few coworkers that are harder to work with than others . 
 Certainly . Do you have your receipt ? 
 Now , why do you want to exchange it ? 
 I'm sorry . I'll get you a new player . 
 Okay , here's a new one for you . 
 I have learned English for 10 years , and I have passed College English test level 4 and 6 . 
 I have taught myself Japanese in college , and I can carry on simple conversations in Japanese . 
 I have a driver's license , and two years of driving experience . 
 I am very familiar with Windows operating system . 
 No , but I have taken elective courses in computer in college . 
 I think I can work well under pressure . 
 Let's see . If we have it , it should be over there under M . ( He looks through the Cds . ) Hmm , it looks like we've sold out of that one , but we should be getting some more copies in soon . If you want , we can order it for you . 
 Yes , it's right over here . 
 Back there against that wall . 
 No problem . 
 Can You tell me how many you want to buy ? 
 Well . then , 260 yuan each . 
 I'm afraid we can't go as high as that . You know we usually don't give any discount . but considering the newly established business relationship between us , I could give you 3 % off the list price . 
 OK . OK . I don't want to haggle with you . Let's say , how about 3.5 % ? 
 Did you put the blue bin out on the street ? 
 Well , you'd better take it out front . 
 It usually gets here at noon on Tuesday , which is tomorrow . 
 Oh , no , you don't . 
 Every morning you get up late and rush off to work late . 
 You'll remember to do it , but you won't have time to do it . 
 Good afternoon , need any help ? 
 That's right and your flight number is CA621 . 
 Excuse me , sir . Flight GB105 is one to Milan , are you sure of your change ? 
 Don ’ t you have air-conditioning in your apartment ? It ’ s sweltering here ! 
 I guess not , huh . 
 You should have moved out long , long ago . 
 So how can you stand the heat ? 
 It's been a long time , Mrs , Lee . 
 When did you come back ? Did you have a good time ? 
 I will . How would you like your hair today ? The same style as usual ? 
 That's true . Here are some samples of hairstyles . What do you think about this one ? 
 Very well . You aren't in a hurry , are you ? 
 Ok . The manicurist will be right here . 
 It's 90 dollars in all . 
 I'd love to ! But I have never learned martial arts , and there is only a month left before the New Year . 
 Sounds great ! Shall I learn the actions that Jet Li did in the movies ? 
 Whatever ! I'm glad to learn something of Chinese kung fu . Thanks for asking me . 
 Good ! 
 We did the best that we could to give you a low price . Did you get our recent estimate ? 
 I've already given you a discount of 20 % off of our normally charge . If I go any lower , we'll have loss on this project . I really want to work with you on this . But we've already gone as low as we can go . 
 I'll tell you what , I'll go over the number again with our financial team and see what I can do . I can't give you any guarantees . But we can try . 
 I know . I intend to go to the store today . 
 Which one ? 
 Oh , you mean ' KIKES ' ? 
 Well , I'll see . Sometimes the stores don't have some of the new kinds of cereal . 
 First , why don't you tell me what you need , such as how big a room , where you want to live , whether you want to live downtown , and what you like to do . Then I can figure out which apartment is most suitable for you . 
 I think that an apartment with two rooms and a kitchen would suit your needs . I can introduce you to a place for rent near your school . The apartment is on the 7th floor , so it is very quiet and suitable for studying . 
 You can also go to the school's sports field to play soccer , and if you're lucky you might make some Chinese friends there . It is right near the market and has comfortable facilities . 
 What is your policy on returns ? 
 Sounds good . 
 Charge . Here's my card . 
 Thank you . 
 It's delicious . 
 Great . Well , the main issue here , as you can see is that our expenses are through the roof . 
 Well , um , sir , the company expenditures on entertainment and travel are out of control . Look at these bills for example . Just this month we ’ Ve paid over twenty thousand dollars for hotel charges ! 
 The list goes on and on . Here , this is a bill for five thousand dollars for spa treatments ! 
 Look at this one sir , eight thousand dollars were spent in one night at a place called ” Wild Things ” ? ! 
 Are you going somewhere ? 
 Really ? Well you ’ ll have to get there before 6pm because they close early today . 
 Yeah and remember if you buy something you mustn ’ t carry it home otherwise your back will get worse . 
 Yes , but it ’ s not free , you have to pay . 
 Hi , Steven . You have finished a wonderful project recently . 
 Don't be proud . You'll gain a lot in the following job . 
 B , talking about salary is not smart . You are a new manager and you'd better learn more professional skills . 
 Okay , You are such a good talker . 
 That ’ s great . What are the prizes ? 
 To encourage the staff increases . 
 What about the afternoon ? 
 Hello , I'd like to see Mr . Charles , the manager , please . 
 No . I haven't , but I'll take only a few minutes of his time . 
 Yes . My name is Lin Tao , the director of Guangzhou Computer Corporation . 
 ( 2 minutes later ) Mr . Lin , Mr . Charles can see you now . This way , please . 
 Yes . I once worked in a small company for one year . 
 My reason for leaving is that I wish to get into the advertising business . 
 I've learnt a lot about business knowhow . I got to know what kind of knowledge was needed in my future work . 
 Which subway should I take to get to the East Side ? 
 Which train is that ? Which platform does it leave from ? 
 Hi , Karen . This is John Williams in the purchasing department . Can you check to see if there ’ s a package down there for me ? 
 Thanks , Karen . 
 Hello ! Mr . Wang . this is Smith . 
 It's a pleasure . 
 I hope so . 
 Don't mention it . 
 Yes , I will . Have a nice flight back . 
 Good-bye ! 
 not very well . I haven ’ t found anything within my price range yet . 
 I can only afford about 300 pounds a month . 
 really ? That ’ s a lot of money to pay for one room . 
 do you know of anyone who needs a roommate ? 
 I ’ d prefer non-smoking roommates , but I guess I ’ ll have to take what I can get ! 
 I can sign a contract up to a year . I don ’ t know where I ’ ll be after that . 
 I don ’ t have any furniture , so it ’ d be great if it were furnished . 
 no , I thought that would be included in the rent . 
 I don't think I can afford that . 
 that's a good idea . I ’ ll look into finding something like that . 
 Our meal was absolutely perfect ! 
 Dessert sounds perfect , but I would like to split something with my friends . 
 I think that the apple crisp would be wonderful . 
 We would also like a piece of chocolate mousse cake . Could you bring us four dessert forks , please ? 
 We are all tea drinkers . Please bring us four teas . 
 The hot drinks first would be great . Thanks ! 
 I am looking for a pair of trousers . Do you have any good ideas ? 
 I don't like it . Actually I am looking slacks . 
 It seems all right . Do you have pantaloons ? 
 What do we get this morning ? 
 I ’ d like to a glass of tomato juice please . 
 Yes . A dish of cornmeal weight . 
 Yes . Baked eggs and buttered toast . I like my baker very crazy . 
 Fried , please . 
 No , that ’ s enough , thank you . 
 Yes , we can have a picnic on the top of the hill . 
 Let me see . We should go to buy some fruit first . 
 How about taking a cantaloupe ? It is light and sweet . Children love it . 
 Yes . Look , cashew , peanuts , assorted biscuits , chocolate , canned goods , anything else ? 
 Definitely beer . Two bottles . 
 Yes . Shall we buy some saucers ? It will be used during our picnic . 
 Let's go to queue up . There are so many people in the lines . 
 Yeah . You can take them home and either use them as a gift or keep them as mementoes . 
 I'd suggest that you go to the Philately Store in Nanjing Road East , where the items are authentic and the prices are reasonable . 
 You're always welcome . Anything else can I do for you , sir ? 
 I guess it is . The restaurant is on the second floor . Please enjoy your dinner , sir ! 
 I am great . How are you ? 
 Yeah , me too ! What are you thinking you would like to do ? 
 Have you gone out on any interviews so far ? 
 Did you see the posting for the electrician apprentice program ? 
 Let ’ s go check it out again ! 
 Do you have a reservation ? 
 Let me check if we have any vacancies ... You ’ re in luck.We have one single room available . 
 $ 60 a night.No charge for local calls on the phone or for the TV , unless you decide to watch the pay-per-view channels . 
 Here ’ s your key.Check out time is 12 noon.If you want to stay until 6 p . m . , it ’ s another half day.After that you have to pay for another night . 
 It ’ s open from 6:30 a.m.to 10 p.m.every day . 
 It ’ s that way , on the second floor . 
 Hello . My name is John Sandals , and I've got a reservation . 
 Sure . Here you are . 
 I sure do . How about American Express ? 
 No American Express ? Okay , here's my VISA . 
 Yeah , that'll be fine . 
 I am really exhausted , you know , I have been working without the weekend for two weeks . My boss always asks us to work overtime . 
 No . But he provides free meals and sometimes gives us some small gifts . Many of us get very tired of this , and we'd rather have weekends than stay in the office . 
 We all know about that , but we have no choice . The chairman of the trade union says he is going to negotiate with the management . 
 That's a good idea . I think we will soon come to a solution to the problem . 
 sure , what is it ? 
 in most cities in China , doggie bags are quite uncommon . 
 it usually goes to the dump . 
 ordering a lot of food at restaurants is just a tradition in China . You know , in the past , people could not afford to eat out like they can today . 
 well , if you want , you can take the leftovers home . 
 I was impressed that you tried the pig's feet . I heard that many foreigners don't like to eat them . 
 did you like them ? You could take the last one home with you . 
 Is this the right counter to check in for this flight ? 
 Your luggage is overweight . The free allowance for luggage is 20 kilos . 
 OK , in this way it's just below the limit . 
 All right . I will begin boarding soon . 
 Yes . I think so . It ’ s not a very expensive apartment . It ’ s in the right area and it has everything that we are looking for . The rooms are quite large too . 
 The neighbourhood is nice too . There is a park nearby . 
 It ’ s a pity we can ’ t afford a house . A garden would be so nice . 
 The building is quite new and well constructed . I ’ m happy with the fittings too . 
 Excuse me , sir , may I take your order now ? 
 OK , sir . Please call me when you are ready . 
 Excuse me , sir . Can I look at your ticket ? 
 You must have left it somewhere . 
 Well , I think you should pay upon arrival . 
 Good afternoon . May I help you ? 
 Which type of deposit do you prefer , time deposit or current deposit ? 
 Okey . The interest rate for time deposit is higher . Could you tell me it's RIB deposit or currency deposit ? 
 Is it your first time to make a deposit here ? 
 The term of time deposit ranges from three months to five years , including three months , six months , one year , two years , three years and five years . How long would you like to keep your deposit ? 
 Fill in this slip in ink , please . 
 All right . Just a moment , please . 
 Can you tell me what the unit price of such carpet is ? 
 The price seems acceptable for me . But I want to check whether you can supply the carpets now if we order some ? 
 That's very good . Shall we sign a contract now ? 
 Hi , I'd like to get your store credit card . 
 I'm finished . Here's the form . 
 Here's my VISA . 
 Could you tell me where you put my book ? 
 No . A Walk in the Woods . 
 No . The bookshelf is full of fashion books . 
 No . Now would you like to help me look for the book ? 
 Oh , very good . 
 Good . How about you ? 
 Have you been on the bus for a while ? 
 Do you ride this bus often ? 
 You have a car ? 
 So why aren't you driving it ? 
 That's smart thinking . 
 I know how you feel . I had a similar problem with a landlord a few years ago . Fortunately , the one we have now is very nice . 
 Yes . I'd like to place an overseas call to London . Can I dial direct ? 
 Oh , I see . How about the charges ? 
 Oh , let me think of it ... Could you put through a collect cal for me ? 
 It's a Mrs . Peters , Marilyn Peters . 
 It's London , 9981-6432 . 
 My name's Ron Smith and the phone number is 356-2210 . 
 Could I see that automatic camera ? 
 Where is it made ? 
 Is it expensive ? 
 I'll take this one . 
 Yes , give me two rolls of Kodak color film . 
 What degree have you received ? 
 When and where did you obtain your degree ? 
 We have the orientation this afternoon . 
 The company introduction , our mission , vision , various policies , insurances , pension plan , company ID , batch , telephone , e-mail set-up and training . 
 Yes , it is not easy . 
 Is this the Law Firm of A & B ? 
 I need to speak to an attorney regarding filing corporate govemance . 
 Is she available ? 
 Good afternoon Sir , may I please see your passport and reservation ? 
 I'm sorry sir , this flight has been cancelled due to some mechanical problems . 
 We apologize for any inconveniences that may be caused by this . If your flight is urgent , I can put you on a waiting list for another flight this evening , but it's on a first come first served basis , so there is no guarantee that you will be able to take that flight . 
 Well , If you can wait until tomorrow , we will put you up in a hotel for today and you can take scheduled flight for tomorrow morning . 
 Thank you for your understanding sir . I will book your flight now . 
 Yes , but have you made an appointment ahead ? 
 Just a minute please . I ’ ll make a call to the HR office . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Your assistant said that it was time to come in and sign my escrow papers . 
 Do you need anything from me ? 
 There are a lot of papers ! 
 My dad is going to be here in a minute to help me go through this with you . 
 Can I start moving in after I finish signing these documents ? 
 I'll treat you dinner . 
 My mp3 player is broken , so I want to change it for an mp4 player . Can you offer any advice about which brand and model to buy ? 
 Oh , that's a good idea . Perhaps I should have a try . 
 That's cool . I can use the computer and the internet pretty well , but I'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products . 
 Yeah , if I buy a cell phone like this , I don't have to take a music player everywhere I go , and I can save the cost of buying an extra mp4 . 
 256MB . 
 Hello . 
 Yes , please . I'd like to open a savings account . Would you please give me some advice ? 
 What's the difference between the two ? 
 Then how about the current account ? 
 Thank you for your help . I think I'll open a current account . 
 Yes . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Hi , Mikel . What's with you ? You look angry . 
 True , you are getting a really pot belly , aren't you ? 
 Just kidding , M . Why don't you come work out with me ? 
 It works if you keep at it . Come on , let's go ! 
 This feels great . I'm all reed up . I can keep going all night . 
 Exercise has no benefit unless you sweat like a pig . 
 Thanks for coming , it was a real blessed . 
 You'll get used to it , Mikel , trust me . 
 It is called Energy Collector . 
 Maybe . Oh , I see the Jungle Flying Train . I once rode it . It was very exciting . 
 Me too . Daniel , look at your left side . Can you see the Air Force Ants ? 
 Good , you can make your dream come true here . 
 So you can prove you are a man . 
 It's just you ! 
 How so ? I thought it went fine . 
 I ’ m sorry . I thought we were all pretty much in agreement . 
 Hi , I'd like to leave a wake-up call . 
 Please wake me up at 6 am . 
 All I had was a sandwich , chips , and soda . 
 I went to the cafeteria and bought it . 
 I ordered a ham sandwich , but they gave me a bologna sandwich instead . 
 I enjoyed it , even though I had not asked for it . 
 Is that right ? 
 That may be true , but I'm sure you enjoyed your sandwich . 
 Yeah . I go shopping once a week 
 What do you mean ? I can't understand . 
 Really ? That's unbelievable . 
 umm ... yeah ! I ’ m looking for a nice gift to give my girlfriend . Our fifth anniversary ’ s next Friday . 
 No , not really ... I ’ m completely at a loss . 
 That purple one . I ’ m sorry ... I ’ Ve never bought jewellery for anyone and I ’ m kind of nervous . 
 Oh ... wow . That ’ s really pretty.Jess would love that . But ... I was thinking of something a little more delicate , perhaps a necklace ? 
 Jess ? Well , she ’ s very smart , and has a great sense of humor . She ’ s very feminine ... 
 Well ... actually ... I was thinking about asking Jess to marry me ... I ’ Ve just been so nervous . 
 Okay , I ’ Ve decided . I ’ m going to pop the question ! 
 What are you doing , Janice ? 
 Patent ? Are you also learning something about patent ? 
 You are well-informed . Can you tell me something about the Patent Law in our country from the book you are reading ? 
 So coincidental . Actually we can exchange some information on this problem . 
 Is there any provision on applying for the patent for foreign company ? 
 How long is the duration of patent right for an invention according to your Patent Law ? 
 Cheers ! Let ’ s tie one on . 
 Excuse me , could you tell me how to get to the school clinic ? I've lost my way . 
 Straight ahead to the traffic lights , left and then right . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Have you tried the Internet ? 
 Wow , you really live in the Stone Age , Mom . 
 Go to yahoo.com and click on “ Travel ” and “ Tickets . ” They ’ ll be about a billion sites to look at . 
 All right . 
 What kind of person do you think you are ? 
 What are your strengths and weaknesses ? 
 What qualities would you expect of persons working as a team ? 
 How do you spend your leisure time ? 
 So , what kind of sport do you like most ? 
 I'd like to have this cashed , please . 
 Yes . 
 Ten hundreds and ten twenties , and the rest in small change , please . 
 I swear I will never shop at a street market in China . It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something . 
 yes . Last Sunday I went to a nearby market . It was on open-air fair . I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot , without even trying to strike a bargain . I paid one hundred and twenty . And just now I was told by my Chinese colleagues I bought it overpriced . I could have talked my way to thirty . 
 but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ? 
 I'm looking for some black pumps to go with my evening gown . Could you show me what you have ? 
 Not to high , maybe an inch or an inch in the half would be the best . 
 Those are beautiful . Do you have any in a size six ? 
 No , thank you . I'm just looking for a black pair . 
 Let's get this card for mom , it's funny . 
 Do you mean girly ? 
 Are you for real ? 
 I think we should each get our own card . 
 Good morning , sir . Sorry to disturb you . May I make up your room now ? 
 No problems , sir . Everything will be already when you come back . 
 Your main responsibility is trouble-shooting between top management and the general employees . 
 Yes , you definitely will . 
 Oh , four or five . How much is the rent for this apartment ? 
 150 ? No , I'm not really interested in this place . It isn't big enough . It isn't near enough to my office . 
 About 3 weeks . 
 By the end of this month , at the latest . 
 We ’ ll have them worked out by this evening and let you have them tomorrow morning . Would you be free to come by then ? 
 Perfect . Our offer remains open for 3 days . 
 I ’ m sure you ’ ll find our price most favorable . Elsewhere prices for hardware have gone up tremendously in recent years . Our prices haven ’ t changed much . 
 We shall be very pleased . Is there anything else I can do for you , Mrs . Anderson ? 
 Certainly , I ’ ll make an appointment for you with Mr . Jordan of the Egypt National Native Produce and Animal By-products Import and Export Corporation . 
 Have you been registered yet , sir ? 
 Are you a medical or surgical case ? 
 Do you have your medical history sheet with you ? 
 Please fill in this admission card . Well , how long do you expect to stay in the hospital ? 
 But there're no beds available now . Two patients will be discharged this afternoon , so you'll have to wait until then . 
 Certainly . See you in the afternoon . 
 Recently it's been pretty good , actually . 
 Well , yes . Thanks , there's no trouble at the moment . 
 I'm going to need a Deposit Certification , to handle the affairs related to home . 
 That was a really good meal , Gordon . 
 Well , it is getting pretty late . I think we should go home . 
 Let's see how much the bill is . 
 What are you talking about ? We'll split the bill . 
 No way , Gordon . I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill . 
 That's better . This way we will both have money to take a cab home , otherwise , you would probably have to walk . 
 You've got a deal . 
 Bye . 
 Please call me or send e-mail . Could you please let me know when your organization can make a decision ? 
 I really appreciate your time and help . See you then . 
 No , It is a middle-sized private company . 
 Yes , there are approximately three hundred people . 
 Well , I hate to disturb you , but I really can't stand it any more . Can you change my room for me ? It's too noisy . I was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . It was too much for me . 
 Anyhow , I'd like to change my room . 
 All right . I hope I'll be able to enjoy my stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep . 
 OK . Thank you . 
 Good afternoon , sir . May I help you ? 
 Would you like anything to drink with that ? 
 Will that be all ? 
 For here or to go ? 
 That'll be $ 4 . 25 ... ( The customer gives her a 5 dollar bill . ) ... out of five . Here is your change , sir . Have a nice day . 
 Yes . Go straight ahead till you come to the traffic lights , turn left there and it's the first turning on the right . 
 That's it . It'll take you about five minutes . 
 Good morning , this is Mary . 
 Hello , Jane ! Is that the Human Resource Department ? 
 I had an interview with your company two weeks ago . I am calling to ask about the interview result . I hope you can give me a positive reply . 
 Thank you ! I am glad to hear that . When would it be convenient for me to start working ? 
 What is the starting salary for me ? 
 I appreciate the offer . I will come on time next Monday . See you then ! 
 Good morning . May I help you ? 
 Okay . Full-size , mid-size or compact , ma'am ? 
 78 dollars a day with unlimited mileage . 
 Is there an additional driver ? 
 If you want full coverage insurance , it will be 8 dollars per day . It includes collision damage waiver and personal accident insurance . 
 Here is our brochure , ma'am . Err ... full-size ... OK . Please choose a model in this section . 
 All right . How many days would you like to use it ? 
 May I see your driver's license and credit card please ? 
 Yes , it is . ( ... ) Thank you . Please fill in this form . Can you check this box , and put your initials here , and again here . 
 No , who was it ? 
 You ’ re a liar ! 
 Who voted for him ? 
 That ’ s the dumbest thing that I ’ Ve ever heard . 
 What could be worse than what you just told me ? 
 That ’ s fantastic ! You really got me there . 
 My Willie ? Why has he suddenly become my Willie ? 
 What did he do this time ? I remember last time he was painting her fence to repay her for breaking it , and he accidentally painted her cat . 
 Ok , tell me . 
 And the ball went through her window ? That's not as bad as last time . 
 Ok , that's probably expensive , but not that bad . 
 At least the fish were saved . If that's the end of the damages , then everything isn't that bad . 
 Hmm , that is bad . 
 I love all the fashionable things . But my favorite brand is Chanel . 
 Yeah . Each style is specially designed by world's top designers . So they can always make you look amazing . 
 Not really , especially at the beginning , if you wear high heels all day long , your feet would hurt . But , no big deal . Women can always get used to that . 
 Sure . But everyone loves to be beautiful . Hey , do you think this pair of sunglasses matches the handbag well ? 
 Come on . Fashion is not only for women . Men also share the equal right to chase fashion . It's the new fashion for men to wear perfumes , which is called cologne . 
 It takes time for that . But people's consuming attitudes are changing quickly . 
 No . Fashion is just part of my life , which improves its quality . But also , I'm good at financing . I have a credit card , but I never overdraft . 
 I have to say that's just the result of difference of our consumptive habits . 
 Hold on 
 Do you want to send it by ordinary or registered mail ? 
 Anything of value in it ? 
 In that case , you'd better have it registered . 
 Yes , when your friend gets it , he'll sign a receipt , which will be sent to you by mail . Then you can be sure it's been received . 
 Maybe you should have told me first ? 
 Because we're partners . 
 Excuse me . 
 Um , this steak , I asked for to be medium rare . 
 Well , I ’ m afraid it isn ’ t . It ’ s a bit too well done and rather tough . Would you mind changing ? 
 Yes , that ’ s all right . Thank you very much . 
 Yes , I think I am quite proficient in both written and spoken English . 
 I have been studying English since junior high school . And I majored in English in college . 
 Yes , I speak a little French and Japanese . 
 Sure it is . I am up to my ears as time expressed . 
 If we were in the same conference room , I would not work late these days . That conference room has been booked out . This time our boss wants to hold the meeting in our company . So everything has to be rearranged and checked , like tables , chairs , mean tacks , podium , audio and visual equipments and even the lunch menu . 
 ( Having lunch with Joseph ) Have you ever been invited to a Chinese feast ? 
 As far as you could see , is dining at a Chinese table a distinct experience ? To what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ? 
 But you look quite proficient in using them now . 
 Yes , table etiquette . There are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . Some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to Westerners , while they are the norm in China . Hey , your chopsticks , old silly ! You should not stab them vertically into the rice bow ! 
 Maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . They resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . It's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present . 
 Do you two know each other ? 
 Can you help me , please ? 
 I want to send this small parcel to Canada . 
 How different are these rates ? 
 How long it will take by sea ? 
 Then , by sea , please . 
 All right . Thank you very much . 
 We'd like some local-flavored pastry . Can you recommend some ? 
 What is that ? 
 That sounds appealing . OK , we will have that . 
 OK . We will try some . 
 No , it's enough . 
 OK . Thank you . 
 $ 10 . 
 Well , what about $ 8 ? Take it or leave it . 
 OK . The X2500 has the unique feature of providing better data flow with less input time . It will reduce your work load at the office . 
 Of course . One of the real pluses of this product is that it is of very high quality , and of compact size . No one can match us so far as quality is concerned . 
 We have this item in three price level . 
 That means this one . 
 Hi , Susan ! 
 Not so well . I've come down with the flu . 
 Thank you . 
 Mom , I don't want to bathe today . 
 Mom , I'm tired . I feel sleepy . I want to go to bed right now . 
 OK . I promise . Thank you , Mom . 
 I'm watching TV . 
 Tingling is on TV . 
 Channel 8 . 
 Will you book a ticket to New York for me ? 
 This Saturday . 
 That's right.Will you check what fights are available on the sixth of September ? 
 I'll have the 5 o'clock one.What time do I check in ? 
 Thank you . 
 Nobody told you what happened ? 
 A truck turned over on the freeway . 
 I am completely serious . 
 I believe that two people did get hurt . 
 I believe so . 
 Yes , it is . 
 No , I have't got the chance to meet the famous professor yet . 
 Thank you very much . 
 We take very good care of this particular pump . It's a crucial part of our process . We clean it and flush it through at the end of every shift , We check the high pressure seals , recalibrate the gauges and lubricate all moving parts weekly . We replace the gaskets every month . 
 Well , from experience we can predict the lifespan of different components . We try to replace components before they fail or wear out . This prevents the equipment from breaking down . It also saves us a lot of trouble ! 
 Shall I come to your office this afternoon ? 
 I beg your pardon for being late . 
 So sorry , I don't mean to be . 
 Thanks for your forgiving . 
 I'll work hard . 
 Have you ever worked as a tour guide ? 
 Then you may know that it's hard work . 
 Have you applied with any other companies ? 
 Is there anything you want to ask about ? 
 Certainly . There'll be a good chance of that if you work for this company . Not right away , of course , but in a few years , after you learn more about our business , you may go overseas with a tour group . Any questions ? 
 All right , then . We'll get in touch with you within a week . Thank you for coming today , Mr . Sun . 
 Good-bye . 
 Of course , it's my pleasure . We'll quote you the lowest price prevailing . 
 Here is our price list , our terms are cash within three months of date of delivery , if you can pay it within one month . we'll give you a discount of 10 % . 
 Can you tell me how many goods you intend to order ? 
 The most we can offer you at present is 600 dozen . 
 Are you going to cook anything ? 
 If you're hungry , then cook something . 
 Tell me what you want to eat . 
 I'd like that . 
 I'm really not going to cook tonight . 
 Why don't you start cooking then ? 
 I haven ’ t been involved in international business , so I don ’ t have any experience . 
 Honest , hardworking and responsible . 
 No , I haven ’ t discussed my career plan with my present employer , but I am sure he will understand . 
 Not yet . What happened ? 
 Yes , I heard the lights were out all night . 
 I don't understand . 
 They really started looting ? 
 Did the looters get caught ? 
 Hopefully we won't have any more blackouts . 
 Let me see . Go straight on , then take the first turning on the left . 
 Twenty minutes ’ walk at most . 
 Hello , is Doris available ? 
 Hi , Doris , this is Mike calling from Parker's Dentistry . I'm calling to confirm your appointment for tomorrow morning at 9 am with Dr.Parker . 
 If I put you in at a later spot , would that work out ? 
 Sorry ma'm , the only opening we have after lunch is one fifteen , but I might be able to work you in after 4 . would that be a better time ? 
 No problem . I have you appointment changed from tomorrow morning to tomorrow afternoon at one fifteen . 
 How can I get to Lakeside Park ? 
 Will it take me straight there ? 
 May I help you ? 
 What's the problem ? 
 When ? 
 What did he take ? 
 Did you see his face ? 
 Could you pick him out of a line-up ? 
 Can I help you ? 
 I am sorry . We are full up for tomorrow . 
 Yes , the Sunset Hotel is three blocks away . Maybe you can ask them . 
 Is this the registration office ? 
 I don't know exactly . 
 I've got a sore throat , a runny nose , and a headache . 
 Medical department ? Are you sure ? 
 Where is it ? 
 Yes . Here you are . 
 Are you going to vote tomorrow ? 
 I am . 
 My polling place is up the street at the park . 
 Where ’ s yours at ? 
 You should know that already . 
 You do know that you can look online , right ? 
 Can you read and write English and French ? 
 Could you tell me something about your English education ? 
 Good morning . 
 I'm phoning about the job that was in the paper last night . 
 Oh , Candida Fawcett . 
 Well , I just thought that it was right up my street you know . 
 Yes , arm , I'm 23 . I've been working abroad , I'm um ... 
 May I see your ticket , please ? 
 How far are you going ? 
 Where did you begin your journey ? 
 I see . Do you remember how much you paid for your ticket ? 
 You must be Mr White from Britain . 
 I'm Michael Smith from Eale Corporation.Pleased to meet you . 
 Does it mean anything ? 
 Why do you buy stocks , then ? 
 There ’ re traffic jams everywhere . 
 Yeah . We should have more roads built . 
 I want a pair of enameled leather shoes in size 30 . 
 The heel is a little tight . 
 Really ? I will take it . 
 Yes , I have . I handed in my application form two weeks ago and I ’ m going for an interview next week . 
 The application form are quite complicated . It took me a few hours to fill it out . The hardest thing was getting all the necessary documents . That took almost two weeks . 
 I had to show document relating to my financial status and of course my education , because I want a student visa . 
 I think that they don ’ t complete the forms correctly or they don ’ t include all the required documents . The embassy is very strict about it . You have to be quite careful . 
 That ’ s simple . Many people break the rules regarding their visa conditions . 
 hi . It was awful . I think I put forward some great ideas , but none of them were accepted . 
 so did i . I ran the ideas by a few people before the meeting and their ideas seemed to have the supports of some people . 
 one or two people didn ’ t take to my ideas very well . That was to be expected . The worst thing was that the people who said the idea were good before the meeting didn ’ t support me during the meeting . 
 that ’ s good advice , but I ’ m not confident that even revised proposals will be accepted . 
 sure . I ’ m open to any reasonable suggestions . 
 I ’ m not sure that ’ s a good idea . 
 that was a great dinner . I didn't know that you knew how yo cook . 
 I don't know . I'm pretty full . What are we having ? 
 ooh , that's my favorite . Maybe I'll have a small slice . 
 I'll have a cup of tea . 
 actually , could I have some milk with that ? 
 skim , please . That'd be very nice . Thanks ... oh no . Janna , I'm so sorry , but I've got to go . 
 I just got a message from my sister saying that she's been in a car accident . I need to go pick her up . 
 she's on the M40 , near Reading . 
 I don't know , she didn't say . I'm so sorry about this . 
 actually , I've only got a two-seater . I'll have to go on my own . 
 I will . Thanks a lot . 
 I think families everywhere have changed a lot in the last 5 decades . 
 Well , in the past , three or four generations would live together under the same roof . Nowadays , living in the same city as one's relatives is becoming rare . 
 Would you consider having your parents live with you when they get older ? 
 That's very respectable , but I could never live with my parents . I usually only see them at our christmas celebration — and that's enough ! 
 Two of my sisters still live at home , even though they have already graduated from university and have good jobs . They enjoy spending their free time with my parents . I guess in that respect , I'm the black sheep of the family . 
 They're always asking me to come home , but I think our relationship is better if we keep a distance from each other . Whenever we see each other , all we do is fight . 
 Yes.May I help you ? 
 What is your reservation number ? 
 Let me see.Oh , yes.We have your reservation number . 
 I'm sorry to say " No . " 
 How much is this shirt ? 
 It's rather expensive , isn't it ? 
 How about 50 yuan ? 
 Then let's split the difference and I'll give you 60 yuan , OK ? 
 All right . 
 I was told to come over to this window if I want to make a withdrawal . I'm not withdrawing from a Current Account , you see . I want to withdraw from my Certificate of Deposit . 
 Oh , I see . Will I lose any money if I decide to withdraw on it now ? 
 Oh dear . Well , if it has to be done , then it has to be done . 
 Hi . I want to place an order , please . 
 Pick - up . 
 I have a menu from your restaurant . I ’ ll order using the number of each meal from your menu . 
 I ’ d like to order number 17 , no . 23 and no . 24 . 
 Medium , please . 
 I ’ ll be there in about an hour . 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Sure . We will make a broadcast for you . May I have your name , please ? 
 OK , please wait for a moment . 
 I have a problem . 
 I owe fees , but a bank statement never came in the mail about it . 
 I have no idea about the fee , so my fees went up . 
 Will you be able to solve my problem ? 
 So , I don ’ t have to pay any of it ? 
 That ’ s fabulous . Thank you very much . 
 Sunny-side up , please . 
 What kind of bread do we have ? 
 I think I'll have two slices of whole wheat . 
 Sure . 
 Dan More's Office , how may I help you ? 
 May I tell him who's calling ? 
 Just a minute please , Mr . White . 
 What's for dinner tonight ? 
 You're not going to cook ? 
 Yeah , and I love your cooking . 
 You're being serious ? 
 Okay , I'll make dinner tonight . 
 Do you want me to wake you up when dinner is ready ? 
 I can promise you that , if you buy our product , you will be getting quality . 
 We spend a lot of money to make sure that our quality is much better . We don ’ t sacrifice quality for quick profits . 
 That ’ s great . I ’ m glad we ’ ll be able to do business together . I ’ ll have some quotes ready for you by tomorrow morning . 
 Excuse me . Would you tell me where The People's Park is ? 
 How long will it take me to get there ? 
 I'm not going in the wrong direction , am I ? 
 May I take a bus to get there ? 
 OK . Thank you a lot . 
 Do you think she'd like a laptop ? 
 A Mac is something most people appreciate . 
 Our 15 - inch Pro will cost you only $ 2,100 . 
 You've made a good decision . How would you like to pay ? 
 It's all yours after you sign here , please . 
 This is good to go . If she wants accessories , just visit us again . 
 Have a nice day , and thank you for shopping here . 
 Good idea . We can finish this project the first thing tomorrow morning . 
 That ’ s great . Thanks for the ride . I really appreciate 1 it . You know my car is still in the shop . 
 It's very nice of you . 
 Honey , what's up ? 
 Oh , really ? I know that telephone signal must have been shielded in the elevator shaft , so what did you do then ? 
 Did you panic at the time ? 
 Was there anyone else with you ? 
 So you mean that you were the only brave one there ? 
 For what ? Complaining about what happened in the elevator ? 
 That was just an accident . you are worried too much about it . I think the property management will check the elevator and improve their service from now on . 
 Dear , can you drive me to the clinic ? 
 Why ? 
 Could it be the battery ? 
 Well , I suppose it could be the gas . 
 Perhaps it's the starter then ? 
 There's a big problem with my room . I'm in 507 . 
 I have cockroaches crawling in my room . 
 I've seen nine more cockroaches than I wanted to see . 
 How dare you question my statement ! 
 Hello ! Are you shopping here today ? Haven't I seen you in some flea markets and thrift shops a couple of times ? 
 You should ! This thrift shop is really cheap , though , you have to pay cash here . 
 Hello , Mr . Compton ? This is Susan Miller . 
 I ’ d like to take tomorrow off if that ’ s all right with you . 
 Listen , you can not afford another day off . You ’ Ve called in sick five times in the last three weeks . 
 Well . I want a note from the doctor this one and to be honest , if it continues , we may not be able to have you here . 
 Hi . Can I help you , sir ? 
 We posted several positions . Which position are you looking for ? 
 Yes . Applications will be accepted for this position until next Friday . 
 If you ’ re interested in this position , please send me your resume . 
 Sure . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 There is about a 15 - minute wait . 
 OK . Give me your address . 
 Yes . A few days ago I have no right to get a driving licence . But now I get it . 
 Yes , it can be quite tough . Many people fail to pass the test at the first time . 
 You should enroll in driving school and then take a road test and a written test . After you pass both tests , you'll get your licence . 
 Don't worry about your driving test . I think you will pass the test and get the driver's licence very soon . 
 Guess what ! I know something you don't know ! 
 How many planets are there in the solar system ? 
 Not anymore ! Can you believe it ? They've decided that Pluto is not a planet anymore ! 
 I'm dead serious . They've decided that it's too small to be a planet , but actually they haven't yet agreed on how big something has to be in order to be a planet anymore . 
 Yes , they can . If you remember correctly , people used to believe that the world was flat . 
 We actually know relatively little about space and the cosmos . 
 I suppose we could actually live on a planet outside of the milky way . 
 I hope not . I think they would be a threat to those of us that lived on Earth . 
 Point taken . Hopefully one day , we'll live in an interplanetary society . 
 What are you buying ? 
 I can check for you , if you'd like . 
 First , we need eggs , milk , and bread . 
 How about some chicken , ground beef , and some steak ? 
 Get some snack foods . 
 There was a stop sign back there that you didn't stop for . 
 How'd you miss it ? 
 Those bushes are covering the stop sign . 
 I see why you didn't stop . 
 No , I'm just going to let you go . 
 That's all right . Make sure to look closely next time . 
 Good idea . I'll get some , too . 
 Sure . We have to have something to lie on while we're catching some rays . 
 No hat for me , but I'm getting this cool pair of shades . 
 Hello ? 
 I am sorry . Mr . Doff is out right now . 
 I don't know . But he will certainly be back for lunch . This is his wife speaking . Can I take a message for you ? 
 Very Good . I will let him know as soon as he comes back . But , may I have your name , please ? 
 Bye . 
 OK . It will make your stay more convenient . 
 No , you can return it to any branch of our company . 
 Why not ? 
 Yes , I do . I find it very informative . It always has plenty of articles from correspondents all over the world and the business section is very useful too . 
 Yes . There is . it has several sections , so it ’ s quite a read ! It usually takes me a few hours to read it on Sunday morning . 
 Let me see . There ’ s the news section , the entertainment section , sports , business , and world affairs . 
 World affairs ? They look at the most important stories in more detail . I find it fascinating . Do you buy a daily paper ? 
 My doctor says that I need a blood test . 
 What are you taking my blood for ? 
 What information does that give him ? 
 Is a blood test painful ? 
 Oh , my God , that hurts ! 
 Hello , JC Consulting PLC . Chris Edwards speaking . 
 Hi Kristy ! What's going on ? 
 Yes , I certainly do . 
 Oh , dear ! There isn't a problem , is there ? 
 Kristy , that's wonderful ! Thanks so much for contacting me personally . 
 Okay , what package would you like to order ? 
 We offer packages with all the movie channels . 
 We also have packages with all the sports channels . 
 We have that available . 
 Would you like anything else with your package ? 
 Yes , you can add or get rid of channels later on if you would like . 
 I'd like extra prints made of these photos . 
 Yes . Here they are . I've marked how many prints I want on each shot . 
 Four by six , except this one . I want a ten by thirteen print of this one . 
 I thought about what you said . 
 I decided that you're right . 
 Where do we get off at ? 
 This bus ride is taking forever . 
 Did we miss our stop ? 
 Didn't you say you knew where to get off the bus ? 
 Are you serious ? 
 I can't catch the bus with you anymore . 
 You are still a student ? 
 Are you sure you can be a successful cashier ? 
 That's only for your theory foundation . I am afraid if you have ever handled large amounts of cash before ? 
 Good . I think you'll make a good cashier . 
 hello ! How are you . 
 what have you got ? A cough ? A cold ? 
 perhaps you ’ Ve been working too hard . You do have a high-pressure job . 
 well . I ’ m sure the doctor will be able to prescribe something to make you well again . Dr . Jameson is very good . 
 OK . Hope you feel better soon . You should take it easy . I ’ m sure the doctor will prescribe rest , you know . 
 Yes . The baked fish was out of this world . 
 Can we have the bill now ? 
 Do you have any job placement services at EDD ? 
 What about people who don ’ t have a computer ? 
 What else is there at the EDD offices that can help me with my job search ? 
 What are the different workshops that are available at the EDD offices ? 
 Can you think of some other places where I may look for work ? 
 Doctor , my child is nine years old , and I recently found that he was constantly telling lies about how he is doing at school . 
 He is doing OK , but he pretends he is doing much better by telling lies . 
 This may be complicated . But I think he may need to build up his self-esteem . 
 There are a lot of ways to help a kid build up self-esteem , but to begin with , you can try and give him more rewards . Rewards will help a chil improve his self-esteem . 
 No , thank you , I am not interested . 
 I wish I could , but I have to walk the dog and finish cooking so if you would excuse me . 
 Wow , that would be kind of useful , do you have any other cooking magazines ? 
 Wow , this is nice ! Ok , sign me up for both publications . 
 That is exactly what I needed ! What else do you have ? 
 Damn Scott . You got big . 
 How long have you been lifting weights ? 
 Yeah . Last time I saw you , it was like 2 years ago . 
 How often do you go to the gym ? 
 That's a lot . 
 I don't think I have the discipline for that . 
 it ’ s so great to be here ! I ’ m so excited to help you and my daughter with your new home ! 
 that ’ d be great , but could I have a cup of tea first ? 
 that would be lovely , thanks . 
 I ’ ll take a little milk , but no sugar , please . Make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup . 
 well , I do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table , but I don ’ t really care for curtains . Did you get them at a yard sale ? They look ancient . 
 oh dear . Well , I suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? It seems a bit dusty in here . 
 I see . Well , I can help with the chores while I ’ m here . You two could probably use my help . 
 Grant . How is everything ? 
 Sure . What ’ s it about ? 
 Excuse me . I need some storybooks in easy English . Do you have anything like that ? 
 I'll go take a look . Thanks for your help . 
 We have one day to visit the big city , can you give us some advice ? 
 I don't think we can visit the city in one day just by walking . How much does the limo cost ? 
 How do I get to the post office from school ? 
 OK , I see . Thank you very much . 
 How do you usually part your hair ? 
 ( The hair stylist cuts the customer's hair . ) Almost done . I just have to even things up a bit . ( She shows the customer the results . ) Will that do ? 
 Would you like a shave ? 
 Okay , let me brush you off . Thank you very much for coming . 
 Mr . McKenna , do you have a second ? I need to talk to you about something . 
 Well , I was just wondering . . . you see , I know I ’ Ve used up all my vacation days this year , but my sister is getting married , and the wedding is overseas , and , well . . . 
 Well , sir , I was just hoping that I might be able to take some unpaid leave this year . 
 I was thinking of taking off from September first until the thirtieth . Would you be okay with that ? 
 Did you need help ? 
 I ’ ll help you with that . 
 I ’ m working here today . 
 Can I see your ID , please ? 
 I have your ballot card right here . 
 All you have to do now is vote . 
 Wish you have a blast . 
 Oh , the clothes here are so expensive ! No wonder there are few people . 
 Yeah , it's lovely , but to be frank , it's not the most practical . You don't have many formal events in your calendar , do you ? 
 When you buy clothes , you must think about the material , quality and price . 
 Make sure you buy what you need and your clothes can be worn for various occasions . 
 That's true , but you already have two back coats and one black sweater . 
 Exactly ! Oh , my god ! I love Britney ! I'm going to get it . 
 It's just the right size--a perfect fit ! I'll take it . Oh , no , I'm a little short . Did you bring your credit card ? 
 I promise I'll pay you back as soon as we get home . 
 Let's have a look . What is this ? Where are all the grades ? 
 What about here in physical education ? 
 So confusing ! In my day we got an A or B if we were doing well and if we failed an exam we would get an F ! 
 Good morning , Ms.Wilson . I've got a lot to learn from you . I think I'll enjoy working with you . 
 Thank you . 
 I see.What if the person wanted is out ? 
 Is there anything else I should do ? 
 All right . 
 Thank you . 
 I'd like a dozen long-stemmed roses . 
 Yes , I'd like them sent to this address . 
 No , could you just write your secret admirer on it for me ? I don't want her to recognize my handwriting . 
 Hi , Mark ! I was wondering if you finished that presentation you were working on last week ? 
 Mr . Rodriguez was asking me about it yesterday . 
 Did you order the cake ? 
 Get on the phone right now . It might not be too late . 
 Yeah . How about ' Happy Birthday Tony , from the gang . ' 
 Hello , this is Mr . Simon . May I help you ? 
 Sorry , I can't give you an immediate answer on the matter . It's pending now . 
 In about 3 to 4 days . 
 What exactly do you want ? 
 What did you want to get ? 
 What kind do you want to get ? 
 I can tell you what kind I like . 
 Apple pie is my favorite . 
 See , I helped you out . 
 You can expect to earn sixty-five thousand dollars per year . 
 The job has a menu plan where you are given a fixed amount of money and you choose what you most need in terms of benefits . 
 You get 2 weeks paid vacation and an additional 10 days of sick leave . 
 We do not currently offer any retirement plan . 
 We allow several weeks release time each year for our employees to attend job-related seminars and conferences . 
 Whoa ! Who said you got the job ? 
 Certainly . As you can see , we have several three-piece suites on sale . Feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are . 
 Yes . The price has been reduced by 50 % . It ’ s a real bargain . 
 Those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you ’ re reading or watching tv . How big is your living room ? 
 I ’ d suggest you buy two . That allows you to change the brightness of the room better . 
 Hello , three-five . 
 I'm sorry , I'm very tired . I'm going to bed early . I didn't have good time , and I don't really want to see you again . 
 It was hardly all night . And I recall it was you doing all the laughing at your own jokes . 
 No , I ' m sorry . I'm going to meet some friends tomorrow evening . And I ' m too tired now . I have to go to sleep . Goodbye . 
 How do you dispose of the waste in your factory ? 
 What about the rest ? How do you get rid of it ? 
 But doesn't incineration produce carbon monoxide ? 
 Good afternoon . Is this the Roley Hotel ? 
 Yes . I ’ m calling from Westwood and Westwood Attorneys . I need to make a reservation for Mr . Alex Brent . 
 I wonder if the dentist could fit me in early tomorrow . 
 How about 12:45 ? 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 How's this ? 
 If you need any help , let me know . 
 Yes , please . I'm hoping to get a mortgage from you and was wondering about your interest rates . 
 That's pretty much the same as I've been quoted at other banks . 
 Definitely . I want to get my mortgage paid off as soon as I can . 
 Mmmm ... that does sound interesting . Is there anyone available I can talk with about this in more detail ? 
 Stupid girl , making me spend so much money , now I have to get it from the ATM ... 
 I know where to put my card ! Stupid machine , talking to me like I ’ m an idiot ... 
 Yeah , yeah , I know what I selected . Just give me my money ! 
 No , no ! Stupid machine , what are you doing ! No ! 
 I want to go try on these clothes . 
 I found some jeans , and a new blouse . 
 What do you think ? 
 What about the jeans ? 
 I don't think so either . 
 I'll just buy the shirt . 
 I have a resume here . 
 David , Chou . 
 These are all my personal documents about my education and working experience you asked for . And I have to be off for an important meeting now . If you think I am right for the job , please keep me informed . 
 I am sorry , but I don't have one with me right now . 
 It's 687 3452 . 
 Thanks . 
 Actually , I could use some help . Thank you so much . 
 I don't think I can manage this morning . I wonder if we could after the time of meeting to tomorrow afternoon . 
 All right.Thank you . 
 Yes . I have to change a room . 
 Next door is so noisy . I can't sleep at all . 
 are you good at cooking ? 
 do you prefer chinese food or Western food ? 
 are you used to the food here ? 
 what's your favorite Chinese dish ? 
 have you tried traditional Chinese dumplings yet ? 
 you know , foreigners are not expected to use chopsticks proficiently . If you do , you'll give your Chinese friends quite an impression . 
 if you want , I can introduce you to some typical Chinese dishes . 
 if you haven't tried Beijing duck yet , I'd like to treat you to a meal at a famous duck restaurant near Qianmen . It would be a pity if you left without tasting it ! 
 Yes , it's true . 
 It's a branch of the Bank of America in Beijing . 
 The applicant must be alert and quick at figures , and like meeting the public . 
 Yes . Because the customers are mostly Americans . 
 Yes , starting salary is 6,000 yuan a month plus bonuses . 
 How ’ s it going ? 
 Ask away . 
 I already voted . 
 I ’ m not going to tell you . 
 My vote is personal . 
 What I can tell you is that I voted for our next President of the United States . 
 It is beautiful . 
 Actually , there is a problem . 
 There are some stains that were left in the carpet . 
 Oh , is that right ? 
 That was the only problem that I saw . 
 I honestly love it . 
 Good afternoon , I'm looking for Mr . Alert Li . 
 Sure . This is Nigel Smith his personal banker . Could you ask him to return my call ? 
 It's 2781703 1 . 
 Thanks so much , bye . 
 Hello . This is the operator . Can I speak to Mr . Smith , please ? 
 I have a collect call for you from Jennifer . Will you accept the charges ? 
 Okay . Thanks . 
 That's not a problem . Just give me your name , phone number , and date of visit . 
 I see your info here on the screen . I'll hit just one button , sir , and you're cancelled . 
 It's a pleasure . 
 Tell me what the problem is . 
 Try checking the connections . 
 The cords that you see behind your CPU that plug into an outlet . 
 If they're not connected right , that will keep it from turning on . 
 You should check the connections . 
 Tell me if it's still not working . 
 Yes , may I ask something about the salary and benefits in your company ? 
 What is the salary while on probation ? 
 That sounds fine . 
 Are there paid holidays ? 
 Hi Barbara . Have you lost weight ? 
 Wow . You look great . 
 What type of diet were you on ? 
 That's amazing . What tips did your trainer give you ? 
 That doesn't make sense . If you eat more , than how do you lose weight ? 
 That makes sense . I'm going to try that . 
 I have a little gut I have been trying to get rid of . 
 Thanks for the advice . 
 Well it ’ s my first night in Beijing . What should I eat ? 
 Mm , I don ’ t really like duck to be honest with you . I fancy something light . 
 That sounds like a good idea . Where should I go to eat that ? 
 Ok then , I ’ ll follow you . 
 Hello ! I'd like to reconfirm my flight reservation . 
 It's flight CA169 , which leaves Beijing at 8: 00 a . m . on January 20th . 
 My name is Deng Li . 
 Oh , no . I'm sure I made a reservation for a first-class ticket . 
 That's what I should do . And I don't want to lose it . 
 OK ! I shall . 
 Can you enlarge the picture ? 
 I want it enlarged to 5 inches . 
 Hey ! Taxi . 
 Capital Airport . 
 At 7:50 . 
 How long is the ride from here then ? 
 Yes , that'll be fine . How much is this going to cost ? 
 Yes , that ’ s right . To be honest , the first year was quite tough for me . I was really just treated more like an intern . I didn ’ t have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating . 
 Well slowly but surely I proved myself , and the new editor liked me so he promoted me to features writer . 
 Yes , I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly . I spent restaurant years in that position , but to be honest it wasn ’ t an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long-term . 
 I just felt that the paper couldn ’ t offer me any new opportunities . I really needed a more challenging role to be honest . 
 That is a blast from the past . 
 Yes . You sure have come a long way in valuing your hard earned dollars . 
 But what are you going to do with that pig ? 
 Who knows , maybe one day he will sit on the desk of a top CEO in a major corporation ! 
 Sure ! How about we go home and prepare a couple of sandwiches ? 
 All you ever do is have unhealthy fast food Pizza , fries , burgers and hot dogs ! You have to start eating better ! 
 Yeah right ! I ’ m serious ! You should also cut down on your sugar intake as well . You drink carbonated drinks that are high in fructose syrup ! It ’ s really not healthy ! 
 It ’ s a start , but I ’ ll be happy when I see you stick to your promise ! 
 I'd like to buy a toy car for my son . 
 It looks nice . How much is it ? 
 Oh , I'm afraid it's too expensive . Can you show me something cheaper ? 
 OK , I'll take it . Here's the money . 
 Good evening , sir . 
 Yes , sir . Straight or on the rocks ? 
 Good morning , Janice . Our office will hold a welcoming party in the evening , so I will allocate you some assignment . 
 Don't worry . I will find someone to assist you . 
 Firstly , you should go to the supermarket , which is nearest to our company , to buy some fruit , drinks , desserts and cakes . Here is the list of things you need to buy . 
 The meeting room on the Fourth Floor needs to be swept . Jerry and Tom will help you at that time . Any questions ? 
 Don't worry about that . I have already calculated the money about things you will buy . Remember to give me the receipt when you come back . 
 I'd like to apply for a personal loan . 
 A thousand dollars . 
 What's the current interest rate ? 
 Congratulations on the new house ! 
 Well , you guys work hard for it . It ’ s really beautiful . 
 I think I found my Yankee's mug ... 
 It fell out of the garbage bag . 
 It was with all the other dishes from dinner . 
 I think our son was trying to pull a fast one on us . 
 That ’ ll be most helpful . 
 How much do you spend on development every year ? 
 What ’ s that building opposite us ? 
 If I placed an order now , how long would it be before I got delivery ? 
 Could you recommend something to drink ? 
 We would also like some alcohol before the main dish . 
 Do you have some questions ? 
 If you join us , our company will provide you a single dormitory . If you make great achievements , our company will offer you a flat according to the related regulations . It all depends . 
 Besides the official holidays , our company offers a ten days paid holiday every year , which makes it possible for you to visit your parents . Any other questions ? 
 You say he was around average hight . 
 Weight ? 
 Any marks on his face ? 
 Glasses ? 
 what about his hair ? 
 Long or short ? Straight ? Curly ? 
 Boy , this surely doesn't help us much . It could be anybody . How about his cloth ? What was he wearing . 
 Ok , now we are getting some where . Pants ? 
 What kind of shoes ? 
 Cow while Boots . 
 All right . That Nealy done a little . 
 Come in , please . 
 Good morning . You are Mr . Sun , aren't you ? Take a seat , please . 
 I've noticed from your resume that you majored in accounting at Peking University . Will you please tell me something about your related courses ? 
 Have you taken Accounting for Decision-Making and Control ? 
 From your school report card , I can see you did well in every course . But our advertisement says we need an accountant with practical work experience . 
 You can speak English fluently but I wonder if you can deal with bookkeeping and accounting in English . 
 That sounds fine . Why did you choose to apply to our company ? 
 Do you know something about the payment we give to our employees ? 
 Of course . As for an entry-level accountant , we pay ¥ 1,500 a month in the first half year . We have a grading system to evaluate your work . If you have made progress , we will certainly raise your salary . For beginners with a CPA certificate , they can earn at least ¥ 2 , 000 a month . 
 I hope you can show me your CPA certificate before we reach a decision by the end of July . 
 The same for me . We'll keep in touch with you . 
 What would you like to eat ? 
 Would you care for some soup ? 
 Do you like egg soup or mutton soup ? 
 Is there anything else ? 
 I'll get them back right away . 
 It was washed by washing machine . 
 I'm so sorry . I have no idea of it . I washed silk dress the first time . I'll buy a new one for you or I'll give you money . 
 It's very nice of you . I'll try my best to do my job well . 
 I go to bed at ten and get up at six . 
 Sure . 
 Oh , yes ! 
 I am glad to hear that . 
 Thank you , I ’ ll pay next then . 
 Check , please . 
 No kidding ! We have only 5 bottles of beer . 
 Have you watched today's news ? 
 Did you hear about last night's blackout ? 
 Some people went looting because of the blackout . 
 People decided to use the blackout to their advantage . 
 I guess they broke into about four stores . 
 There's no evidence of who it was . 
 Would you please bring me the black suit ? I want to try it on . 
 I think this suit fits perfectly . 
 It's fine . Please wrap it . 
 Yes ? 
 I'm afraid there aren't any left at the moment . Gan you wait just a little while ? 
 I'll bring you one as soon as I find one available . 
 I think I've looked everywhere , but I haven't seen a swimming pool here . 
 Swim stations ? Whoever heard of such a thing ? 
 All that exercise in a little pool ! Do I have to pay anything ? 
 Very good . Now can you tell me the hours of operation ? 
 Wow ! I can't wait to change into my trunks ! 
 Thank you . You do me a big favor . 
 Can you tell me what's the time in London ? 
 Yes . I have to take a conference . Are you English ? 
 Do you know what time it is ? 
 Get in this door young man . It ’ s midnight , you are two hours past curfew . 
 I don ’ t care ! You are grounded for life , mister ! 
 You know the rules and you broke them . No allowance and no TV for a week . I usually never ground you but this time I have to put my foot down ! 
 I don ’ t want to hear it ! Now go to your room ! 
 Yeah ! Do all these people work in the company ? Everyone and their dog is here ! 
 Can we just sit wherever we want ? 
 Hmm . We don't exactly have the best seats in the house , do we ? 
 Www ! That weirdo ? ! He really gives me the creeps ! 
 I just hope he doesn't start bragging again ! 
 Me , either ! Who decides how much money we get ? 
 Actually , I did have a question . We'd like to know what you had in mind for the budget on this project . We are hoping to put together a really competitive bid . But at the same time , we'd like to hit your target price , too . 
 Do you have any price range ? Is there any way you can give me any idea of what direction to go or how high is too high ? 
 So , Monica , how do you like your new office ? 
 That ’ s very good . I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful . 
 Small rooms , small window , a small desk shared by three people . I would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work . 
 Totally agree . By the way , the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . You can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor . 
 Oh , hi , Leo . Sure , what ’ s up ? 
 But I ’ m not in there very often . It ’ s so noisy that I can ’ t work . 
 Has anybody spoken to him about it ? 
 We really can ’ t ask him to stop having students come in for help , can we ? 
 How about recommending him to use the storage room down the hall ? 
 With the cabinets taken out , it might be bigger than it looks . 
 Let's rock n ' roll . 
 I know , I know . OK , so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine . 
 So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ? 
 Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ? 
 You know what ? I ’ ll just have everything dry cleaned . 
 You have a warrant out for your arrest . 
 My computer shows that you have a bench warrant . 
 You apparently missed a court appearance . 
 There's nothing I can do about that . 
 That's life . 
 Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law . 
 Don't you think it's a bit bright ? 
 That dress looks lovely on you , but it's not very practical , is it ? 
 I like the jeans , but you need something to go with the top . It's too plain on its own . 
 That might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ? 
 Thanks . You'd be OK on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ? 
 That looks great . Just one more thing-you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ? 
 Who is Cindy ’ s husband ? 
 How many children do Cindy and Ron have ? 
 Do they have any grandchildren ? 
 Does their daughter get along well with her in-laws ? 
 Do they have a large family ? 
 What do you think are the qualities a nurse should have ? 
 What kind of medicines does the doctor usually prescribe to children who get high fever ? 
 I ’ d like to check in please . 
 Mr Harold Smith . 
 Yes , I am . That ’ s right . 
 Yes please . At 6.30 am . 
 Thank you . 
 No , he's not . May I take a message ? 
 Yes , what's your name ? 
 It's a little embarrassing really ; you see I think I've got a counterfeit note . 
 No , I don't . Usually I'm very careful about checking the money I'm given , but for some reason this one slipped through . 
 I understand . To be honest , I'll be glad to get rid of it if it is a fake . 
 I want to lose some weight ! 
 I have a yoga class tomorrow . Do you want to come with me ? 
 What are you going to do ? 
 Good , I am sure it will work if you can persist . 
 Sounds good ! 
 You said it.No one can match Shakespeare in artistic talent . 
 So what brings you to my office today ? 
 How long has your tooth been bothering you ? 
 Have you injured your tooth in any way ? 
 Do you have a special kind of toothbrush that you like to use ? 
 Does it bother you when you eat something really sweet ? 
 so , tell me about your new house . How is it different to your old one ? 
 so , it ’ s a three-bedrooms detached house ? 
 what ’ s the kitchen like ? I know both you and your wife like to cook . 
 are the rooms nice and bright ? 
 do you have a balcony ? 
 you ’ re right on the edge of the city , aren ’ t you ? There can ’ t be much noise or traffic there . Is it easy to get into city centre ? 
 We were decorating and I ’ m going to ask some things . 
 Shall we need at one fifteen this Thursday ? 
 Fine , I ’ ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on Thursday . 
 You'll find the cereal by the breakfast foods . 
 They're over by the oatmeal and the breakfast bars . 
 Can I help you with anything else ? 
 You'll find that by the paper towels . 
 That's where it'll be . 
 If you need anything else , please feel free to ask me 
 I'm in a bit of a hurry , Miss Liu . Can you wait for a minute ? 
 All right . What's the problem ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . Take good care of your husband . I'll find another one to replace you . 
 Wait a moment . It's $ 30 . 
 OK , one with the apple pie pays $ 18 and the other $ 12 . 
 Which dish do you like most ? 
 Actually , it's the dish recommended by this restaurant specially . 
 Good afternoon , sir . Welcome to our hotel.What kind of room would you like , sir ? 
 Did you take the written test ? 
 Make sure to study first . 
 I'm sure you're ready . 
 No , it doesn't cost anything . 
 It skips around . 
 I thought it would be easy , but I didn't pass it . 
 Good evening ! This is Mr . Smith in room 609 . 
 I'm going to Shanghai early tomorrow morning . So I would like to request an early morning call . 
 I have to be at the conference room of the Garden Hotel in Shanghai by 10 o'clock . I think it will take me three hours to get there . It means that I'll have to be on the road before 7 o'clock at the latest . 
 Well , in that case , I would like you to wake me up at 5:45 . 
 Good night . 
 Certainly , Mr . Emory . What can I do for you ? 
 Sure . Let me look over them and I ’ ll bring them back this afternoon . 
 It's your blood pressure , I'm afraid . It's far too high . 
 Overwork-amongst other things . You can't work 24 hours a day . You ' Ve got to slow down . 
 You've got to , I'm afraid . And look at this . You weigh 200 stones . That's too much for a man of your size . 
 Yes . You've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise . 
 Yes , please . That would be a great help . Are you sure you don ’ t mind ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 No , there ’ s no need . 
 No , don ’ t bother . It ’ s all right as it is . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve been getting harassing calls recently . Can I have my phone number changed ? 
 How about 560 436 4040 . 
 How about 560-436-8976 ? 
 As soon as possible . Can I have it right now ? 
 Thanks . 
 Yes , I'd like to change these dollars , please ? 
 In fifty yuan bills , please ? 
 Good morning , sir . 
 How do you want it , sir ? 
 How about your sideburns ? 
 All right ... Tilt your head to the right , please . 
 Exactly five dollars . 
 You are welcome , sir . Good-bye . 
 Would you like me to leave the samples with you ? 
 Fine , Mr . Grant . Thanks for your time . 
 We're on our own tonight . Dad's taking mom out . 
 You know , on a date . They're going to dinner . 
 Yep . They said they're reviving an old tradition . 
 That's right , once a week . Do you want to order a Pizza ? 
 I was told about it already . I'm just waiting for my invitation . 
 I believe that she will give me the invitation today . 
 Yeah , it sounds like it's going to be the best party of the year . 
 When exactly does the party start ? 
 Has she given out a lot of invitations yet ? 
 I'm planning on going , but I really need her to give me my invitation . 
 yes . He ’ s in hospital with a bad back . One morning , he just couldn ’ t get out of bed.His wife called an ambulance and they took him to hospital . He ’ s been there for a few days now . 
 you have to be very careful with seafood . It tastes lovely , but it often causes upset stomachs . Have you heard anything from tom ? 
 he might be allergic to pollen . My niece is allergic to pollen . It seems like she has a cold , but in fact it ’ s her allergy . 
 it ’ s nice that she ’ s back for a while . Thinking of all these ailments , I got a splinter the other day . It took a long time for me to get it out of my skin . Look . 
 that ’ s a good idea . You ’ Ve got a nasty bruise on your hand . 
 I would like to exchange Chinese money into German currency please . 
 How about 50,000 RIB . Would that be a problem ? 
 Ten percent ! Now that ’ s hefty ! 
 Yes I do; here is my account number . 
 3,000 marks in hundreds and the rest in tens and twenty ’ s , please . 
 How was your self-help trip ? 
 Didn't you feel any jet lag from the change in time zones ? 
 I've never been to Disneyland . I went to Universal Studios when I was fifteen . My parents took my brother Franco and I to Los Angeles and San Francisco.Wish you and Janet love each other more . 
 It's our anniversary today . I am looking for the same flowers as the ones in her wedding bouquet . 
 White . 
 They are short , I guess . About the same height as those short flowers over there . 
 No , they look like little bells . 
 Oh , that's too bad . 
 Ok . How many do you suggest ? 
 Yes , they are . 
 Good morning . Can I use my cellular phone during this time ? 
 Thank you . What should I do if I want to phone my family during the flight ? 
 So I can use the onboard phone during the flight ? 
 Please tell me how to file things according to the concerned rules . 
 What are they ? 
 And what is the most important point ? 
 We are happy to have you with us . When could you start working ? 
 What about Next Monday ? 
 There's a car waiting for you just outside the door . Right this way , please . 
 Let me put your cases into the trunk and please get in the back . 
 How was your flight ? 
 We'll reach the Beijing hotel in another ten minutes . When we arrived there , you can go up and have a rest . The hotel has very good service , and it's considered as one of the best hotels here . 
 If it's convenient for you , Mr . Wu would like to invite you to the banquet in honor of you in the evening . 
 At six o'clock in the International Hotel . We'll pick you up this afternoon . Besides , if you care for visiting , we'll arrange some sightseeing for you . 
 We are free this afternoon , aren't we , Mr John ? 
 It's very kind of you , Mr John.the sightseeing trip between our business talk will be sort of our work division.business can be make for pleasure.what kind of exhibition we're going to see ? 
 Could you give more detail information about some of the industries you just mentioned ? 
 What the others ? 
 How about textile industry ? 
 That's surprising , three days ago when I went to yancheng store , I saw different kinds of textile goods . I've bought some for my wife , some for my friends.they seem very attractive . 
 I'm sure I'll enjoy seeing them.and will have more information of your city industry.what is more ? I'd like to visit if it is possible.the famous Goumi street in the city . 
 I am sure I'll enjoy some real chinese food then . 
 Yeah . I hate spending all day in there , too . 
 We need milk , eggs , butter , coffee , vegetables , fruit , bread , cheese , and some snacks . 
 Anything else ? 
 No , you get those . I ’ ll go and get the fruits , vegetables , milk , butter , and eggs , you get the rest . 
 Yes , the pain comes more intense when the weather is bad . And the pain comes more intense when I walk too much . 
 Yes , I have . 
 Yes , it does . Just like a needle prick . Besides , the place that hurts often feels cold , too . 
 Yes , I do . 
 By the way , does acupuncture hurt ? 
 Yes.Let ' s start today . 
 We got a problem . The deposit boxes are all full . We should have come earlier . 
 Did you ? I didn't hear you . It was too noisy . 
 They say we can't . They don't look after customers ' stuff . 
 OK , it's my fault . I'll stay here and look after our stuff . You can get in , shopping with Daniel and May . 
 Hey , don't forget to buy a suit for me . 
 Black , of course . 
 Mom , can I have some ice cream ? 
 Mom , can I have one more piece of cake ? 
 Will you be voting this year ? 
 This is going to be my first time voting . 
 I ’ m not sure what I ’ m doing . 
 I don ’ t know anything about the bills or laws they ’ re trying to pass . 
 Nobody told me that before . 
 I ’ m so glad you told me that . 
 Check the mirror . How do you like it ? 
 I think this one fits you . It's the new fashion style . 
 Have you finished that report yet ? 
 How much time do you need ? 
 Can I also take the MET to get there ? 
 No , can I trouble you to lend me a hand ? 
 You have to buy a ticket first . You want to go to Shi Da , right ? 
 Ok , then you need to go to Tai Power Building Station . 
 Look at the map to see where you are . Then look at where you want to go . The number is how much money you have to pay . 
 Then , when you have your ticket , you go wait on the platform . 
 Just remember to hold on to your ticket . You need it to get out of the station when you get there . 
 Sure . Here is the mirror . 
 What about this one ? It's natural ingredients . 
 I'm going to quit this job . It's way too stressful . 
 Yeah , I'm in the office till 10 every night . I can't take it anymore . The pay just isn't worth it . 
 Morning . What would you like for breakfast ? 
 Come on . We are going to be late .

 We'd like you to execute the first order by the 31 st .

 When can I expect to have it ? 
 Ok then . See you next weekend . 
 I'm here for a facial . I made an appointment over the phone for 3:30 today . 
 Addison . 
 Which would you recommend ? 
 What does it include ? 
 Does it include a facial mask and a massage ? 
 Will you exfoliate the skin as well ? 
 That sounds great . I'll have that one then . 
 We finally get a chance to meet . 
 It's no problem . 
 Is there something wrong ? 
 I'm glad to hear it . 
 You don't have anything bad to say about her ? 
 I am so happy that she's doing okay . 
 Could you tell me something about investment environment of your country ?

 Good afternoon , madam . How can I help you ? 
 First of all , we'll tailor a work-out plan according to your physical conditions and your personal needs . 
 Well , we give each of our customers a qualified personal trainer . The trainer will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work-out plan . 
 Since everyone is different , your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level . Then you'll be taught all the necessary techniques to use these equipments and achieve your goal . 
 That depends . We offer membership for one month , half a year and one year . 
 Wise decision . that is 400 yuan . You'll find it's totally worth it . 
 Watch out ! You're too close to the fire place . 
 Really ? That's wonderful ! 
 Not at all . 
 Excuse me . Is flight KL638 late ? 
 Oh , my god . If this flight is late . I will for Sydney.What can I do now ? 
 OK.thank you . 
 I would like to buy a new fridge . 
 I was looking at this Kenmore refrigerator . 
 What's so great about it ? 
 What appliances ? 
 May I see the inside for myself ? 
 Wow ! You're right ! This refrigerator is great . I'll take it . 
 In just three weeks , and I am excited . But there are still a few things I need to do before I go . 
 Like renewing my passport , going to the travel agency to buy my plane ticket and figuring out what to do with my apartment while I ’ m gone . 
 No way . I ’ ll never find another apartment around here . But I don ’ t like the idea of paying three months ’ rent on an empty apartment , either . 
 Yes , but whom to ? 
 That ’ s exactly when I ’ ll be away . It sounds ideal , as long as the landlord agrees . 
 Well , thanks , Bill . Let me know what happens . That extra money will really come in handy . 
 For my part , xiangqi . Maybe it's because my girlfriend is Chinese . 
 Quite right . And unlike the soldiers in xiangqi , the pawns in chess can promote once they reach the furthest rank . It is very agreeable to grant merits to people with good performance . 
 Yeah , and though the king in chess doesn't have bodyguards , he has a queen who is the most powerful piece . I think this demonstrates the relatively higher social status of aristocratic women in medieval Europe than in China . 
 You mean , xiangqi pieces are allowed a larger space in which to move around ? 
 Well , what about this two-bedroom apartment ? The listing says it's right in the heart of the city , just steps from the metro . 
 It says it's $ 1600 . But if you share it with another person , that's only $ 800 per month . 
 That's true . I know that there are lots of popular restaurants and coffee shops around there . 
 Certainly . 
 It's a tax levy by the goveroverment on goods imported into that country . 
 Tariff provides the government with extra tax revenue . 
 Tariff raises the price at which the goods are sold in the importing country and therefore makes them less competitive with locally produced goods . 
 Do not mention it . 
 OK , Mr . Smith . When will you arrive ? 
 Party of two ? 
 All right , Mr . Smith . I will arrange a table for 5 at 12:00 for you . 
 How about we go to the flea market today ? 
 Me , too . There are so many cheap but nice things . 
 Honey , please forgive me . There is lots of work to do . So , I forget your birthday . 
 How have you been doing lately ? 
 Is there some reason why you can ’ t get enough sleep ? 
 When do you turn in for the night ? 
 Do you have a lot on your mind when you try to go to sleep ? 
 Do you ever meditate or read before bedtime ? 
 Something's wrong with my computer . 
 My computer won't turn on . 
 I'm not sure I understand what you mean . 
 Is that what's stopping my computer from turning on ? 
 I had no idea . 
 I'll try it right now . 
 Why are you arresting me ? 
 What kind of warrant ? 
 What is that ? 
 I never went to court . 
 This is unfair . 
 I have rights , don't I ? 
 Have you begun cleaning up that room of yours ? 
 What time are you going to clean it up ? 
 I told you to clean it up earlier . 
 Make sure you vacuum and dust your room . 
 I don't want you to leave until you clean up . 
 I'd like to cancel my reservation on flight MS701 to Warsaw on the 23rd.My name is Michael .

 I ’ m concerned about your lack of marketing experience and , frankly , your age , you ’ re pretty new at all this . 
 Hi there , Philip . How ’ s everything going ? 
 I don ’ t blame you . You ’ Ve had a busy first week . Take a rest ! 
 Ms . Montgomery ? Do you have a moment ? 
 I ’ m a bit upset about this year ’ s bonus . I was really expecting a little more . Are there any problems with my work ?

 Yes , I'll have a steak , please . 
 Rare , please . 
 Coffee , please . 
 I agree , but the maintenance team is fully stretched dealing with problems . We don't have time to carry out any preventive maintenance .

 Good luck next time . 
 Have you heard who got elected ? 
 Our new President is John McCain . 
 I was just as shocked when I found out . 
 The people have spoken .

 Will you have it later ? 
 That's terrific.Thank you . 
 Ordinarily , as soon as you are seated , you put your napkin on your lap . 
 At a formal dinner , you wait for your hostess to put hers on her lap first . 
 Oh , really ? 
 Well , it's a good thing for you . 
 So you don't think you are fat and need to lose weight ? 
 junk food is not good for your health . Too much of it will make you fat . 
 Ok , but junk food has many disadvantages . As junk food contains high amount of oil and fat , you'll feel sleepy , but not be able to concentrate when you have a lot of it . 
 Let me see . You could exercise more to keep fit . 
 Good morning , I'd like to open a savings account . Can you tell me on how to go about it ? 
 I have my passport with me , a driver ’ s license and a membership card . Will they do ? 
 What ’ s the minimum amount I can deposit in an account ? 
 Thank you . 
 Yes . I have been a data entry operator for three years . 
 I have working knowledge of Windows and Dos.Actually , I'm quite familiar with both Java and C Programming Languages . 
 I have an ACRE certificate , GRADE 2 . 
 I'm sorry to say I'm not familiar with processing management information , but I'm sure I could learn quite quickly.It can't be too difficult , and I've got a quick mind . I can handle any problem you give me . 
 Yes , I do . 
 Yes , please . Christin . 
 Yes , please . 
 No , thank you . I don't like milk in my coffee . I like black coffee . 
 Yes , I do . 
 Yes , please . 
 Yes . I used to come out here with my grandpa as child . 
 Aren't you happy now ? I hadn't seen the piano when I was a child . 
 The park is so beautiful . It is a good thing I have taken the camera . 
 All right . Give me a big smile . Are you ready ? Cheese ! 
 Excuse me , sir . Could you take a photo for us ? Just press this button . 
 What would you like to change ? 
 I would be willing to put in a different color carpet if you pay the price difference . 
 It would cost between 2 and 10 dollars more per square yard . 
 I would be willing to look at a different color . You need to bring me a sample . 
 You can have the new carpet and paint by next Monday . 
 They are made a town nearby . The flower vases are made of porcelain and covered with tiny bamboo sticks . 
 No . They are not only ornamental , but also useful . 
 what's your favourite steps ? 
 how about rock and roll 。 
 and can you dance tango ?

 great . i am your lucky fellow then . 
 I certainly have the will but I wonder if I've found the way . 
 Let me say something about the falling Australian Dollar . We're both hurt by the rising U . S . Dollar . We will have to pay more Renminbi for U . S . Dollar to buy wool from you . 
 Do you ? Then you can see that we have one wish that is to conclude this transaction in a way that will satisfy both sides . What can you do to help ? 
 All right . I accept this reduced offer at $ 98 per metric ton FOB stowed . The other terms and conditions shall remain the same as those in the previous agreement . Now will you draft the agreement or shall I ? 
 Ok . Then well bring it over to you tomorrow morning . You'll sign it first , so it will only need my signature . Is that agreeable to you ? 
 Good . Let's shake hands on this successful transaction . 
 Here you are . We've ironed them for you already . Please check and see if there is any damage . 
 I'm terribly sorry . You know we are so busy today and we forget to sew the button back on . Please wait a moment . It will be ready soon . 
 Would you like to have a look ? Is it to your satisfaction ? 
 It doesn't seem like that . Sorry , sir , we've tried everything , but we're not able to get it off the shirt . It was from the sugar I think . 
 Yes , the sugar was burnt during the dry-cleaning process . And there you go . 
 I am awfully sorry . Please tell us about the stains before the dry-cleaning next time . 
 This is a membership card . You can get a 20 percent discount next time .

 Just put in on with the rest of my hotel bill . 
 Paul , is this Paul , isn't it ? 
 Small world , isn't it ? 
 Please take a seat . 
 Now what can I do for you ? 
 Fine , but first I need some information about you . 
 Well , first of all , your name . What's your surname ? 
 And your other names ? 
 Have you got your e-mail address ? 
 How old are you ? 
 Where were you Bron ? 
 Are you married or single ? 
 And what was your last job ? 
 Room service , can I help you ? 
 What would you like to order ? 
 Okay . I ’ ll have them brought to your room right away . 
 I made an appointment for a perm at 3 o'clock . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , with the LUX dandruff shampoo . It helps a lot to get rid of my dandruff . 
 I'd like a permanent wave . By the way , do you have any picture of the latest hairstyle ? I ' Ve been in this style for so long that I want a change this time . 
 I prefer this kind of style . Can you make it for me ? 
 You won't believe what just happened . 
 I went down to change some money , right ? 
 I wanted to change around 5000 dollars . And you know the exchange rate . 
 Not today . 
 I went into the bank with my money , and I looked at the exchange board.At first I couldn't believe it . I thought I was reading the board wrong or something . 
 Because the board said 60 pesos for every Taiwan dollar . 
 I thought it was wrong too . It didn't make sense . 
 So , I went up to the teller and started to exchange the money . And it's true.They really gave me sixty pesos for the dollar . 
 My stomach's growling again ! 
 Just a little steak , uh ... snack ? A bowl of clam chowder ? 
 You're right . But if I get too thin , my mom will make me go to the hospital again . 
 You know . Soup , well , society makes us like this . 
 Well , thin is always " in " with the media . 
 if you aren't thin , you're nobody . 
 You lost me . 
 Yeah , but that's human nature . 
 Let's change the stomach , I mean , the subject.How about some food ? 
 Is this about the Sales Assistant position ? 
 Mr wilson is on the line right now . Please have a seat . He'll be right with you . 
 Can I get you something , coffee , tea ? 
 have you finished going through the contract ? 
 Ok . Ask away . 
 yes , employees can take up to 10 days of sick leave per year . However , in order to get paid , you ’ ll have to bring in a note from the doctor ’ s . 
 that ’ s correct . 
 well , we ’ Ve had to add that to the contract because we found that many of our employees were taking almost one sick day a month , even though they weren ’ t sick . 
 do you have any other questions ? 
 we do actually . We can add that as an amendment to your contract . 
 men are allowed to take 10 days of paternity leave for their first child . 
 well , women are the ones giving birth . I think it ’ s fair to give them more time , don ’ t you ? 
 yes , please . 
 This all looks good ! I think we know what we want . 
 I am dieting , so could the chef prepare the food with no extra sauce ? 
 Could you tell me if there are any entrees that are vegetarian ? 
 I am going to go with the grilled shrimp with garlic sauce . I would like the garlic sauce on the side . 
 You can serve our salads with our dinner . 
 Yeah , this dress is really nice ! How much is it ? 
 One hundred and fifty dollars ? What about this other one over here ? 
 Hmm ... that ’ s a bit out of my price range . Can you give me a better deal ? 
 Well , I don ’ t know . I think I ’ ll shop around . 
 That ’ s still more than I wanted to spend . What if I take both dresses ? 
 I don ’ t know ... It ’ s still a bit pricey ... Thanks anyway . 
 Great ! You ’ Ve got a deal ! 
 It should take us back up to Altadena . 
 I'm not really sure if it does or not . 
 I've never taken this bus , but I think it's the right one . 
 That's true , and we have been on this bus for a while . 
 Yikes ! Temple City . 
 My bad , but at least we know the right bus to take us back . 
 Yes , I wanna go to America for my vacation . 
 Sounds good . Are there any group tours I can go with ? 
 Great . So how long is the trip ? 
 Fine . I happen to have 20 days for holiday , so exciting ! How many places will be visited and what are they ? Where will be staying and how about the food there ? 
 Well , cool . What's the price for this trip ? 
 Well . 40,000 RIB that's really a lot of money . I will have to think about it . 
 Is it Thursday ? I mean if I let the chance slide ... 
 Well . Ok , I will take it . 
 Why do you want to take the police to court ? 
 They did ? 
 I thought they let you go . 
 They made you spend the night at the station ? 
 What was their reason for arresting you ? 
 I see . 
 Your teacher has left you not very much homework this weekend . 
 My advice would be to finish it at once . 
 Sure , what kind of shoe are you looking for ? We ’ Ve got strappy sandals , sleek high heels , edgy pumps , or if you ’ re looking for something a little more practical , we ’ Ve got Mary Janes , ballerinas . 
 Ok , right this way . What color did you have in mind ? 
 Of course . We ’ Ve got this style here that is very popular . Because it ’ s an open-toe shoe , you can wear it any time of the year . They look great on everyone . 
 OK , these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two-inch heel so they are very comfortable . 
 What size ? 
 Here we are . How does it fit ? 
 Have a nice day , Ma ’ am . 
 I'd like to have my hair cut . 
 You look so busy . 
 Short on both sides . Not so much in the middle . 
 Yes . You are right . 
 About two months . 
 Where are you heading now ? 
 Is that the university next to the Teachers ' College ? 
 You mean we'll share the taxi ? 
 Well . Don't worry about it , I will be happy to share the taxi with you . 
 Yes , please . I've been here for nearly two months , but I still haven ’ t found a job . Do you think you can find one for me ? 
 What ’ s this form for ? 
 That's great . But how long do I have to wait ? 
 Oh , dear . How can I wait for such a long time ? 
 Then , what do you think I should do ? 
 I see . Thank you very much for your advice . Bye . 
 How are you doing today ? 
 I'm absolutely lovely , thank you . 
 I haven't been better . How about yourself ? 
 Where are you going to school ? 
 How do you like it so far ? 
 I wish you luck . 
 All right then , Ms . Montgomery . I ’ ll get those plans over to your office by Thursday afternoon . 
 That ’ s what I was thinking . I ’ ll have them there by Thursday . 
 Great . My favorite-soup , soup , soup ... 
 Blow my nose ? 
 No , please , Mom ! Don't make me gargle with saltwater ! 
 What a nice garden ! Look at these tulips ! 
 All right . Would you please stand closer to the flower bed ? Good . Smile . Say " cheese " . OK , got you . That's terrific . 
 No problem . 
 Do you know how to set up the timer ? 
 OK , let's have a try . 
 Did it come out ? 
 Never mind . Let's go to the falls and try again . 
 Now we have settled the terms of payment . Is it possible to effect shipment during September ? 
 Then when is the earliest we can expect shipment ? 
 That's too late . You see , November is the season for this commodity in our market , and our Customs formalities are rather complicated . 
 Besides , the flow through the marketing channels and the red tape involved take at least a couple of weeks . Thus , after shipment it will be four to five weeks altogether before the goods can reach our retailers . The goods must therefore be shipped before October ; otherwise we won't be in time for the selling season . 
 Mr . Brown , you certainly realize that the time of delivery is a matter of great importance to us . If we place our goods on the market at a time when all other importers have already sold their goods at profitable prices , we shall lose out . 
 That's too bad , but I sincerely hope you will give our request your special consideration . 
 But can't you find some way to get round your producers for an earlier delivery ? Make a special effort , please . A timely delivery means a lot to us . 
 Good morning , sir . How may I help you ? 
 Certainly , sir . Would you like to open a time deposit savings account or a checking account ? 
 No problem , sir . What sort of time deposit account would you like to open ? 
 The minimum time period is three months . The longer the period , the higher the interest rate . If you withdraw your money before time is up , there are penalties . 
 Yes . I am looking for a pair of gloves . 
 Excuse me , but I want a pair of mittens . 
 Fancy seeing you here 。 Lily . 
 How's everything going ? 
 Johnny , I want to thank you . 
 Oh , Johnny , that stuff was dollar store junk . No , I want to thank you for keeping Grandma busy . 
 I know , and normally she's trying to tell me how to clean my house . So , thank you . 
 Not only that , but I'm going to buy you that video game after all ! 
 I usually go to the supermarket , near the station . 
 I think they are quite reasonable , and the vegetables are very fresh . 
 Only 2 dollars and 25 cents . 
 It was alright . I ran into Bill and we got to talking for a while.He ’ s in a bit of a jam . 
 Well , his son had an accident and Bill doesn ’ t have health insurance . This really got me thinking , and I wondered if we shouldn ’ t look into a couple of different HMO ’ s . 
 Exactly ! I searched on the web and found a couple of HMO ’ s with low co-pays and good coverage . The deductibles are low , too . 
 Well , we don ’ t have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions , so we should be fine . 
 Not in a million years ! 
 Not at all . 
 Someone just robbed me . 
 This guy just robbed me right on the street . 
 I'm okay . He just stole my things . 
 I have to file a report at the police station . 
 I would like that . 
 My phone has got lot of static . 
 About five years old . 
 Sure , where is your office ? 
 When are you available ? 
 Alright , I'll bring it in this afternoon . 
 Good morning . Do I need an appointment ? 
 Thank you . 
 I've been wearing my hair long for years , but now I'd like to try some kind of modern style . What do you suggest for a woman like me , that is , with hair like mine ? 
 I hope so . I'm really tired of this old-fashioned style that I've been wearing . 
 Yes , if you think it will help . 
 It's great ! Will it be hard to care for ? 
 By all means . 
 Yes , I just forgot where the bed linens department is . 
 Thank you . 
 Wow , what a cool car ! The styling of this car really appeals to me . 
 I want to buy it . How much does this car cost ? 
 You can tell me here . I just want to know the price . 
 I appreciate your help , but I think I'll look around a bit . 
 I think that 30000 yuan would be fair for this car . 
 Can't you make it cheaper ? I still can't afford the car . 
 Hum ... OK . I will take it . 
 Well , we could eat in more . That $ 300 for entertainment is mostly going to restaurants . 
 No , I need my books . 
 Well , what about the $ 50 you spent on a shirt ? You could ’ Ve gotten something for less . 
 All right . That sounds fair . 
 I wanted to go , but I couldn't . 
 It's too bad that I couldn't make it . Who won ? 
 I really wish I went to the game . 
 So tell me the final score . 
 It must've been a close game . 
 Hopefully , I'll make it to the next one . 
 Hmm . I ’ m pretty booked up this week . Let ’ s move it up to next week . 
 Let me take a look . All right , that ’ s no problem . See you then . 
 So soon . It seems as if you just got here . 
 It certainly has been a pleasure seeing you again and renewing old memories . 
 It was fun for me , too.It gave me a chance to get away from my routine and do something a little different . 
 Oh , yes . I should be there sometime next spring . 
 What's today's special ? 
 OK , I'd like to try it today . 
 Yes , I need to order a large number of Webster's dictionaries . 
 Is there a discount for buying in large quantity ? 
 Take me to the airport , please . 
 I have to be there before 17 00 . 
 There's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time . 
 ( After arriving on time ) Here's twenty dollars . 
 No . If you can't break it , keep the change . But can you give me a receipt ? 
 Kids are always difficult to control . 
 Kids are kids . 
 OK , thank you . 
 That'd be nice . 
 Oh , you are so efficient . I thought you might give it to me tomorrow . Thanks . 
 This is encouraging news , good for you ! What is your solution , then ? 
 Sounds not bad ! Better performance isn ’ t just about doing a lot more . It is about focusing on the right things to do . 
 So you have to open all the envelopes . 
 Do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ? 
 I'd like to send this parcel to Spain , please . 
 Well , how long will it take if I send it by surface mail ? 
 Oh , dear . It won't get there for New Year's Day if I send it by surface mail . How much will it cost if I send it by air ? 
 Excuse me , what's the screen near your steering wheel for ? 
 Oh , that's new to me . So what's on everyday ? 
 Is there anything interesting ? 
 I agree . Are there any commercials on the TV ? 
 That makes a lot of sense . Does the TV work well ? 
 I got it . Do you pay for the programs ? 
 It is a little bit expensive , but it's worth it . 
 It can also entertain your passengers like me . 
 Hello , ABC company . 
 Just a moment . I am sorry . At the moment , he is out of the office . Would you like to leave your number ? When he comes back , I will tell him to call you back . 
 Of course . 
 What is it ? 
 Let ’ s see ... “ Wanted 
 What about my resume ? 
 Thanks , Mary . You ’ re a real pal . I ’ ll call now to set up an interview . 
 Not yet , can you recommend me some chickens ? 
 Please bring me the chicken chops . 
 Yes , here you are . 
 I'm the general manager of the Far-East Industry Corporation . 
 Yes , I have been invited by the East Import & Export Corporation of China for business talks . 
 Yes , I have some foreign currency to declare . 
 All right . 
 Sure . What's up ? 
 I would like to open another account . 
 I want to open a savings account . 
 Yes , I do . 
 That would be great . 
 I want to transfer $ 100 . 
 All right . Thanks . 
 Er , let me see . Oh , look , you're right here . Pretty close to the Olympic Park . 
 Is this your first time here ? Where are you going ? 
 Oh , there are many Chinese antique stores . They get paintings , too . Do you get interested in them ? 
 Wow , it is quite far away from here . I'm afraid you're gonna have to take Bus No . 713 . 
 Two . French and Spanish . 
 Well , French was my best subject at school . I can read and write it pretty well . 
 Well , it's not as good as my French . I can speak it reasonably well , but my written Spanish isn't very good . 
 In that case , I'm fit for the position I think . 
 That's right . I can already see the Palace Garden on the left . 
 The bus is turning right to Buckingham Gate . And now we are joining Victoria Street . 
 I can see it . The bus is stopping . I think we will be able to go inside . 
 I guess we should see Big Ben soon . 
 Look at this bridge . We will soon be crossing the Thames . 
 Wonderful . 
 The Queen Street , I guess . 
 I ’ m afraid you ’ re going in the opposite direction . 
 Yeah.There ' s an express that leaves in twenty minutes . 
 Sure . 
 Go to window number eleven . 
 May I help you ? 
 Oh , that's a really good buy ... Here . There's only one left . 
 Sure , if you show me your passport . 
 No , it isn't . That's why it's such a bargain . 
 Son , you just go back to bed , and stop crying wolf . 
 No , I haven't been registered . 
 I'm a medical case . 
 Yes , here you are . 
 The doctor told me to stay about one month . 
 Well , when they leave the hospital , give me a call and I'll come back . 
 I'd like to open an account please . 
 Savings , please . 
 That's great ! We made 20 minutes earlier . 
 Mom , you are the best ! 
 Mom , come on . What are you thinking about ? 
 Don't tell me you want me to do that ? 
 But I don't like playing the piano . And the homework keeps me busy enough . 
 How depressed ! 
 But mine equals yours in economy . 
 ... So what I think we need to do is ( XXXXXXXXXX ) finish on time . 
 Oh , OK , I said ( XXXXXXXXXX ) on time . 
 ( XXXXXXXXXX ) 
 ( XXXXXXXXXX ) but I don ’ t think you can hear us . ( XXXXXXXXXX ) Hello ? ( XXXXXXXXXX ) 
 ( XXXXXXXXXX ) OK ( XXXXXXXXXX ) . 
 Have you made an appointment with this company ? 
 Yes , it's very important to make an appointment before the interview . 
 If you go to the company without appointment , the interviewers may happen to be busy with other things , and have no time to give you an interview . 
 If the interviewers are not in the company , you will go there for nothing . 
 So you should make an appointment in advance with the company for the interview . 
 You could directly call the company and arrange the time and place for the interview . 
 If you succeed in doing that , you must attend the interview on time . 
 Yes , here is your reservation . You have a standard room reserved for two nights . Is that right ? 
 Oh , my mistake . The reservation is for a suite and it is a non-smoking room with a king bed . I'm sorry for the error . 
 Sure , that's no problem . May I have your credit card ? We need a credit card on file for your room charges and incidentals . 
 Okay , now if you could please verify the room rate here , initial next to the X , and sign right here . How many keys will you need ? 
 Okay , you're all set . You're in room 1201 . Take the elevators to the 12th floor and it will be on your left . Do you need any help with your bags ? 
 Enjoy your stay . 
 Well , there are 2 reasons . First of all , I'm itching to work in a foreign enterprise . Secondly , your branch is a new establishment in Beijing . I think I'll be assigned more workload and responsibilities here . 
 Yes , of course . The balance sheet contains 3 major sections , that is , assets , liabilities and owner's equity . 
 Yes . Will you ? 
 How did you do that ? 
 Why is that ? 
 What ’ s the reason for that ? 
 You can just go to work after you vote . 
 I get it now . 
 I ’ m fine . Thank you . 
 I need to transfer money . 
 From my savings account . 
 I would like it transferred to my checking account . 
 I want to transfer $ 200 . 
 Yes . That will be all . 
 Although I am a little shocked , I can deal with it pretty well . I didn't perform as well as I should have in the interview . 
 OK , thank you , I'll try if there were other chances . 
 Hello , have a seat . I ’ m Bill Gotcha . I am assuming you found your way here with no trouble ? 
 I am curious as to why you want to leave your current employer . 
 Do you feel that you are exceptionally good at anything in particular . 
 What are you not good at ? 
 We appreciate hearing that about you ! 
 Yes , we would like to take a tour to L . A . 
 2 weeks . Can I have a brochure of the sightseeing tours ? 
 Good evening . 
 Let me check the list . Yes , we do have a reservation under Mr . Tim . 
 It doesn't matter . Follow me , please . What do you think of the table in the center of the dining room ? 
 I'm sorry , but you see , all the tables by the window are small , with up to 4 seats . 
 Thank you for your understanding , Mr . Tim . 
 Yes , I will . 
 There's a 20 percent service charge in this hotel . 
 That's for the hotel restaurant . You had five meals here . 
 Welcome to Adventure Tours . How may I help you ? 
 Excellent ! Our company has more than ten years of experience in the adventure tourism and sports field . Let me show you some options . This is our most popular choice , our river guides will take you 
 Well , in that case , we can take you hang gliding with one of our experienced instructors . It ’ s the closest you can get to flying . 
 Mmm . OK . Well , why don ’ t you tell me a little bit more about what you would like ? We have everything from mountain biking , to rock climbing to street luge . 
 I have the perfect option , this package will take you on a hiking trip through the Himalayas for three days and afterwards there ’ s a dog sledding journey ! 
 Honey , could you help me here a minute ? 
 I want to put this curtain up . 
 Thanks , dear . 
 Where to ? 
 You must have a rich boyfriend because that bag is so expensive ! 
 No kidding ! Then how do you know the bag's real ? 
 A risk I would never take ... 
 Yeah , but you guys don't stay with the same classmates all day , right ? 
 So , you sent out invitations to your whole graduating class ? 
 I thought homecoming was a high school dance . 
 Good afternoon , anything I can do for you ? 
 Well , we have some nice sugar . 
 Sure , follow me . 
 But newspapers do get some extra income by offering space for ads . 
 You didn ’ t show up in the morning meeting . What ’ s up ? 
 But you still look a little bit tired . What time did you leave ? 
 That ’ s normal after a tense work evening . Working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either . Once , I worked overtime everyday for a whole week including the weekend . That really broke my rhythm and I got a little sick later . 
 But if the company asks , what else can we do ? 
 This is he . May I help you ? 
 I ’ m very sorry , Madam . Can you tell me what the problem is over the phone or would you like me to go to your office ? 
 Yes , I'd like to book a table for four at seven this evening . 
 Yes . Mike Lee . And put me as close as possible to the stage , please . 
 You need to get a special application form . 
 You can go to the Employment Development Office and pick it up . 
 They will need a record showing who you worked for and when you worked for them . 
 Be prepared to show a written notice of your termination as proof . 
 You will receive a notice for a phone interview , which will continue the process . 
 Then what about you , Miss ? 
 The vegetarian dishes are at the last pages of the menu . 
 What is my ideal weight ? 
 How can I avoid injuring myself during exercise ? 
 Sir , tell us about your experience with Super Bulk-up . 
 Tell us how . 
 And now ? 
 Wow ! All because of Super Bulk-Up . 
 Oh , it is my cell phone ringing . I set it in the vibration mode . 
 You are right . Some ring tone is just terribly loud . You can hear it even in the next door . It is really a kind of distraction . 
 Good idea . 
 Not yet . To tell you the truth , I don't know how to write it . I've considered it for several days . 
 Don't laugh at me , please . I'm serious . I've never been required to write this kind of report before , I only do the research reports . 
 So what items must be involved in this report ? 
 Yeah , is that all ? 
 That's too complicated . 
 Oh , my God , is there any fixed for mat for it-the one that I just need to fix my information in ? 
 But I don't know how to work the Microsoft Words . Could you please give me a hand ? 
 Did you hear anything about the robbery ? 
 Really ? 
 What did you see ? 
 I can't believe it . 
 What happened next ? 
 Did he get caught ? 
 Excuse me , do you sell apples ? 
 Do you sell them individually or by weight ? 
 Could you weigh these , please ? 
 A sack of cherries , please . 
 Are you ready to leave ? 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 Please take a seat . Do you need a shampoo ? 
 $ 10 . 
 The total charge is $ 15 . 
 Well , what shampoo do you prefer ? 
 ( 5 minutes later ) What sort of hairstyles do you like ? 
 I think a crew cut is the most suitable for you . 
 I was looking for the Resume Writing Workshop . 
 I am not really sure that I remember how to even put a resume together . 
 How do we get started ? 
 Then what ? 
 Could I list my interests and special skills next ? 
 Bell Captain . May I help you ? 
 Certainly , sir . How much luggage do you have ? 
 I'll send someone up right away . 
 No , I think I didn't like your method . 
 Have you obtained any certificate of technical qualifications or license ? 
 How many years have you had the driver's license ? 
 That's good . What special skills do you have , can you tell me ? 
 What computer languages have you learned ? 
 Have you gotten any special training in programming ? 
 Hello , Peace Hotel . 
 A moment , please . I'll check our room availability for these days ... Yes , that's all right.What ' s your name please ? 
 I'm sorry , your visa has expired . 
 I'm afraid you'll need to have your visa extended before we can have you check in . 
 I have a reservation for a single with a bath . 
 What's the room rate ? It's little expensive for me.Do you have any other room ? 
 May I see the room ? I'll take this room . Is the rate for a room only ? 
 What's your apartment like ? 
 What is it like living in on-campus housing ? 
 Did you have to pay a deposit ? 
 Do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent ? 
 How long is your contract for ? 
 Have you started looking yet ? 
 Good luck ! 
 I use several services . Of course , I deposit and withdraw money quite often . I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account . I use my bank to exchange money from one currency to another . I often travel abroad , you see . 
 I sometimes use traveller ’ s cheques , but sometimes I travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash . 
 Yes , I do . It save me a lot of time . I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines . 
 Yes . My bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage . There ’ s a lot of competition between banks nowadays . Each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others . 
 I don ’ t have one . I prefer to buy shares . My bank also provides a share trading service . It ’ s cheap and easy to use . 
 Are you married ? 
 How long have you been married ? 
 How many people are there in your family ? 
 Who are the members of your family ? 
 Hello , this is IBA Bank . Maria speaking , how may I help ? 
 Not a problem . Which loan was it you were interested in ? Sorry , I must ask , because the interest rates can depend on the type of loan you apply for . 
 One of our most popular ! The usual interest rate is fixed by the PBC . That is The People's Bank of China . But of course , with some loans , credit rating and loan amount come into play , too . 
 That is correct . 
 I'm going to the shops in a minute . What do we need ? 
 No problem . We also need bread , so I'll go to the baker's . I'll get some vol au vents for Victor's birthday bash on Friday . We'll need balloons for that too . 
 Okay . The library's beside the baker's . I'd better take back the videos we borrowed last week . They're overdue . 
 Bye ! I'll be back before seven . 
 I'd like to withdraw 35,000 RIB from my Corporate Account . 
 Yes , my name is Ms Jane Reeve , R-E-E-V-E . 
 Here you go . 
 Oh , how silly of me . Can we correct it here ? 
 Good afternoon . How can I help you ? 
 Ok , please first fill in the form and return it to me . You can do it in the next door . 
 Everybody attention . I would like to make sure you all know the process . The interview consists of three parts . One , all of the interviewees will answer the question there and lasts for maximum one hour . Two , we will take a 30 - minute ’ s break . After the break , we all come back to this office and I will announce the successful candidates for the 2nd round . In which , you have a small interview with your future manager . 
 Good question . But I will tell you when you pass the first two . 
 Actually , you do not need to go into the office to file a claim . You can do it over the phone or the Internet . 
 That ’ s a good decision . They have many good job search tools there . 
 The Internet has a list of Employment Development Offices listed online . 
 Our office is over on Green Street , just west of the college . 
 Everyone has a one-week waiting period before they can collect . 
 I'm offering them to you at 150 yuan a piece . Is that all right ? 
 Yes . Our price can't be matched . 
 If you buy 1,000 or more , you'll get a 10 % discount . 
 May I help you ? 
 Do you have any style in your mind ? 
 I recommend you this one . It's a very popular kind of coat-the most recent thing . 
 There's been a dramatic change in the weather pattern . 
 It has been delayed . 
 No , but probably until there is a break in the storm . 
 I think it's smart to stay close to the gate so we can hear the updates . 
 oh , the clothes here are so expensive ! No wonder there are few people . 
 yeah , it's lovely , but to be frank , it's not the most practical . You don't have many formal events in your calendar , do you ? 
 when you buy clothes , you must think about the material , quality and price . 
 make sure you buy what you need and your clothes can be worn for various occasions . 
 that's true , but you already have two back coats and one black sweater . 
 exactly ! Oh , my god ! I love Britney ! I'm going to get it . 
 it's just the right size--a perfect fit ! I'll take it . Oh , no , I'm a little short . Did you bring your credit card ? 
 I promise I'll pay you back as soon as we get home . 
 Well , that is the chart showing our company ’ s organizational structure . 
 Ok . On the top , Mr . Thomas , the managing director , is responsible for running the company . 
 Four . They are production department , finance department , sales and marketing department and HR department . I directly report to Mr . White . He is on a business trip and is suppose to be back this morning . Probably you will be meeting him at lunch . 
 Mr . White , too . 
 Yes , this way please . 
 Here you are . 
 I recommend crisp beef and fried duck . 
 Do you want any dissert ? 
 Would you like to rent the house ? 
 I can lend some to you . 
 Miss , where do you want to go ? 
 No problem . 
 Yes , you are changed 50 cents a piece . 
 We're going to discuss how to market CB series soon . Does your project go well ? 
 Oh , that's good . 
 It seems you've got everything done . Now I can finally stop worrying about it and get back to work . 
 I'm very touched , and I can't help bursting into tears at the wedding . 
 Mary looks so beautiful in the wedding gown , and I record the moment that I was bride . 
 Judy , Why are you so interested in her ? 
 He's terribly handsome . 
 Why are you so bitter ? No one tells worse joke than you . 
 I came in to see how my home inspection went . 
 I had a home inspection before , but didn ’ t really understand it . 
 The owner said that the roof had leaked , but that he got it fixed last month . 
 Are the sellers responsible for fixing the problems with the house ? 
 Did you find a lot of things wrong during the home inspection ? 
 Welcome to our company . 
 An impressive officer is vital to the image projected by the company . 
 She is dealing with customers and driving up new business . The guy next to her is in charge of their office computer network . 
 He is our accountant . 
 Indeed , they are . Keeping staff happy is the only way to keep them with the company . 
 Channel Two . A TV series was showing on it . The name of the series is Huanzhu Gene 
 Generally it's to my appetite . What about you ? 
 Don't be too critical . So what's your favorite ?

 Well , your qualifications for the job are excellent . And is there anything you'd like to ask about the job ? 
 Yes , our employees are allowed to take up 2 days a month to attend college courses . 
 I've enjoyed the conversation with you . We'll call you within 5 working days . 
 How does the political system work in your country ? 
 Each mp belongs to a political party , right ? 
 What ’ s a cabinet ? 
 Can any mp make a law ? 
 I suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties . 
 How do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ? 
 How about drink , Sir ? 
 Would you like cream or sugar in your coffee ? 
 Sorry , I don't have any sugar . 
 I don't know . I just wasn't thinking . 
 Please wait till your name is called . 
 Here you are . 
 No , I'll e paying for myself , but I have private medical insurance . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 So , John , what do you do for a living ? 
 Oh , really ? That sounds interesting , what kinds of book do you publish ? 
 Oh , What a cool job ! How long have you worked there ? 
 Can I help you ? 
 What kind of stamps do you want ? 
 I must weigh it . 
 It is 5 grams overweight . Do you want to send it as an ordinary or registered letter ? 
 Registration plus overweight , 7 yuan in all . 
 do you have any plans for tomorrow night ? 
 sure . What movies were you thinking about going to ? 
 yes . Isn't the director of that movie the same guy who directed Shaun of the Dead ? 
 to be honest , I didn't really like Shaun of the Dead . Besides , I like movies with a happy ending best . 
 I was thinking of seeing You , Me and Dupree . It's a typical Hollywood blockbuster . 
 yeah , I suppose you wouldn't want to see that , huh ? 
 It depends on who the film is about . Which movie did you have in mind ? 
 that sounds fantastic ! What time is it playing ? 
 great . Shall I meet you there around 7:45 tomorrow night ? 
 Excuse me , I'm looking for your casual short-sleeved shirts . Can you tell me where those are ? 
 Medium . 
 Thank you . I think I'll take this one , and these pants as well . They're presents for a friend . 
 Yes , please . 
 Not a lot . What about you ? 
 That sounds like fun . 
 I'm sorry . I'm already doing something this Friday . 
 My family and I are going to dinner . 
 I'll definitely try to make it the next time . 
 All right . I'll see you next time . 
 Yes.We have an excellent service here . 
 OK . 
 I will if you tell me how you're so sure that we're going to come out on top . 
 After what you did , I don't know how hard Elvin's going to work to meet your deadline . 
 You've got everyone figured out , don't you ? 
 To start with , may I ask why you chose to work at our company ? 
 Well , please look at the employment contract . I'd like to go over the main details again before signing . First , you will be getting a monthly salary , and no probation is involved . 
 Of course . A reasonable number of sick days will be covered by the company . Any extended illness will be covered by insurance . Have you read the other terms of the contract ? 
 Yes , any approved overtime of more than two hours will be paid twice of the salary or take time-off . 
 Good . Now , you sign here , you can start work the beginning of next month . 
 Yes . I'm used to online shopping . It ’ s convenient and time-saving . You can buy anything you want and they will send it to your home or any place you want . 
 You can get the same product at a much lower price . 
 You should open an account at the online bank first . After that , you can buy anything online . 
 Sure . You can find everything all over the world . Let ’ s check it out online ! 
 By amenities , exactly what do you mean , please ? 
 Okay , I got it . You've already run out of all your amenities ? 
 I'm more confused now than before . How is there a problem ? 
 Okay , finally I understand . You would like souvenirs ! 
 If it's souvenirs you want , sir , just visit our souvenir shop . It has everything . 
 No problem at all , sir . Housekeeping will deliver you all the amenities you like in a bit . 
 There are many ways ; what kind of job would you like ? 
 Fine ! Will you need part-time or full-time work ? 
 Fine , the two best ways are to use our local listings binders over there or you can use the computers with the Internet job listing sites . See them over there ? 
 Well , in addition , you can schedule an appointment with a job counselor on this list . If you would like to do that , sign here , OK ? 
 Fine , well the job search tools are all here for you to use . Feel free to look around and use what works best for you . Have fun with it ! 
 Yes . Thank you . 
 A glass of Qingdao beer . 
 Will you make some recommendation ? 
 I am coming to inquire about the information of the company . When was this company established ? 
 Really ? That is amazing . 
 Yes , I would like to schedule an appointment for you to come in and talk with me . 
 No , sometimes the test results aren ’ t clear and we need to do more to get a clearer picture . 
 I would if I knew anything for sure , but I want to take a second look . 
 You can come in this afternoon . If you would feel better , bring your husband with you . 
 Just relax . We will talk about it this afternoon . 
 Yes . I am going to have a summer vacation . Would you recommend some scenic spots to see ? 
 Maybe Europe . 
 Let me have a look at the pamphlet . 
 Ok ! You know you're always welcome here . Did you enjoy your stay ? 
 It's our pleasure . And is there anything else we can do for you before you leave here ? 
 Don't mention it . Oh , This is a small gift for you . 
 We hope you could visit our company again . 
 Ok ! We'll definitely go to visit your company . 
 To the office . I'll be right back . 
 Hi , Rita , I ’ m just looking for a pair of shoes . I won ’ t be here for long . 
 That ’ s my problem . I don ’ t have a lot of options . 
 Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection . 
 After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I ’ m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice . 
 We'd like to have western food today . Could you tell us something about it ? 
 Well , it's quite different from the Chinese food . 
 Well , Mr . Parsons , as I mentioned before I ’ m someone who needs new challenges . I ’ m really focused and hard-working . I think my academic results prove this . 
 Well , I believe I ’ m a good team-player , but I can also work well independently . I ’ m very enthusiastic and , well I hope my colleagues would agree , I ’ m fun to work with . 
 Hmm , that ’ s a tough question . But I would have to say my passion . I ’ m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career . 
 You should communicate with the interviewer whose company you are interested in , and make a good impression on him or her . In that case , your chance of success will be greater . 
 You should take a look at all the companies , choose your favorite ones , go over to talk with the interviewer and leave your resume in the end . 
 No , sir.Can I help you ? 
 Oh , hop in . 
 No , I haven't got one . My employment petition hasn't been approved yet . 
 Ok , I see . 
 Hi , Daddy . It ’ s me , Troy . 
 It ’ s nice . I arrived safely . 
 I ’ m fine . Is everything fine in the family ? 
 The weather is gorgeous here . 
 I will . Thank you , Dad . 
 I love you , too , Dad . Bye . 
 Sir , according to your file , you spent Monday evening watching ' Titanic . ' 
 Well , this wouldn't be the first time that a file was wrong . Just a moment , please . 
 Sir , when I deleted the $ 10 , the program automatically added a $ 2 service charge . 
 Sometimes you can't win for losing , sir . 
 I don't blame you , sir . Two dollars is a lot of money . 
 It is true . I think we should change some policies . 
 Indeed , it's unfair . Households with higher salaries receive larger LPF contributions and thus qualify for larger loans . Lower-income households , on the other hand , can only get smaller loans , or perhaps nothing if they could not afford to purchase any housing . 
 I am glad to have the opportunity of visiting your corporation . I hope we can do business together . 
 I am interested in your hardware . I've seen the exhibits and studied your catalogues . I think some of the items will find a ready market in France . Here is a list of requirements . 
 I will do that . Meanwhile , could you give me an indication of the price . 
 What about the commission ? From European suppliers , I usually get a 3 to 5 % commission for my imports . It's the general practice . 
 You see I do business on a commission basis . A commission on your prices would make it easier for me to promote sales . Even 2 or 3 % would help . 
 Yes , sir . May I help you ? 
 For today ? 
 We have a flight that we'll put you there at ten AM . Is that ok ? 
 I'm afraid not , unless you want a night flight . 
 How about afternoon ? 
 Is there I can do for you , miss ? 
 Let me see , oh it's a sunny day . You will have a nice trip tomorrow . 
 What time is our connecting flight ? 
 Wow , that's cutting it close ! That means we only have 25 minutes to make the connection ! What gate is it at ? 
 Oh , great ! That's at the other end of the terminal ! 
 I'm be right behind ya ! 
 Yes , I was there as an English teacher . 
 Sure . I was fond of those lovely children 
 The school is a little bit too far away . I simply want to take good care of my elderly grandfather . 
 I think it's better for me to meet new challenges in life . 
 And I can experience another kind of life style . 
 I hope I can adapt to the new job as soon as possible . 
 Yes , speaking . Anything I can do for you ? 
 Where is the interview happening ? 
 What a lovely tapestry ! Don't you think we could use one to decorate our room ? 
 Artistic tapestry is the highest form of expression of the rug weaving art , an exquisite handicraft of superb artistry in typical Chinese style . 
 I think it is . 
 I prefer the linen one . 
 Certainly . Could you put it on the scales , so I can check the weight ? 
 That ’ s 850 grams . The coasts depends on how you would like to send it . 
 That ’ s right . Sending it by airmail will cost twelve dollars and sending it by surface mail will cost eight dollars . 
 Airmail should take four or five days and surface mail should take about two weeks . 
 No problem . That ’ s one dollar extra . 
 There ’ s you receipt . Goodbye . 
 Yes , a suitcase and carry-on . 
 Thank you . 
 I am sorry too . I know we've been talking about this beach trip for a while . I should have told Bob I was busy this weekend . 
 thanks for understanding . 
 hey , what if the three of us go to the beach together ? Besides , you and Bob haven't seen each other for a while . I don't want my best friend and my boyfriend to be complete strangers . 
 I know Bob won't mind . You can bring a date , like that guy from the bar you keep talking about . 
 well , I think you should come and have some fun . Besides you never know maybe he likes you as well . You should at least try . 
 Can I get my hair done like his ? His girlfriend has the same hair , and she's white . 
 What kind of style are you getting done ? Can we match ? 
 Can I get a relaxer , too ? And why did you say , “ You crazy ” instead of “ You ou're crazy ” ? 
 I do a forty-hour week . I ’ m on flexi-time . I usually start work at 8 a . m . and finish at 4 
 Four - plus public holidays . I usually take two weeks off in the summer and the rest at New Year . 
 Yes , if we're busy . I'm paid double-time if I work at weekends . 
 Great . Thanks for asking . 
 I would like to deposit some money . 
 I want to deposit cash . 
 I would like to deposit $ 300 . 
 I want to deposit it into my checking account . 
 No . That ’ s all . Thank you . 
 I need to speak with David Lin . 
 Thank you , I'll try again later . 
 I am not sure . I don't know that many restaurants around here . 
 Good . Let's take a look ! 
 I enjoy Thai or Japanese the best . 
 Oh yes , I've heard of that one . Everyone I've spoken with says that it is great ! 
 I think that that would be a really good choice ! Let's call and make a reservation . 
 Oh , no . You see I'm in the middle of something . Could he wait ? 
 All right , all right . He'll get them as soon as possible . 
 Yes , how much is the teapot ? 
 I'm afraid I haven't got enough money on me . 
 What's the time now ? 
 I want to know at what time you close . 
 Oh , that's great ! Thank you . 
 Sure . It's down this street on the left . 
 No , it's not far . 
 About a mile and a half . 
 5 minutes or so . 
 Yes , it's very close . The subway station is next to the hotel . You can walk there . 
 Waiter , bill , please . 
 What's this for ? 
 I see . 
 Yes . please . 
 Bill Black , Room 1201 . 
 Sure . Here it is . 
 I sent my resume to a computer company and am waiting for their call . 
 Pineapple Computer Company . A secretary is needed there , and it is worth a try . Do you get any information or advertisement for employment ? 
 But what ? You always act like this , when you face difficulties . 
 All the fears are nothing . You can make it . There is no other choice for you . Be brave . 
 It's all or nothing . 
 What news ? 
 You know what we will get ? 
 What docking station ? 
 Another big step forward in saving on our office equipment , I don ’ t need a desktop anymore . A laptop is enough . 
 Pierre Cardin . 
 It look fine.Can I try it on ? 
 I know what you mean . I fit into my clothes , but I'm not always comfortable . 
 What do you have in mind ? 
 I know the one you mean . Do you know how much the memberships are ? 
 Let's go after work and take a tour of the facilities . 
 I think there is an accident ahead . 
 I know . Why don't we take a different route ? 
 Ok , let's do that , even though we may have to take a longer way . 
 I like red . 
 Dad , I want to draw with crayons , can I ? 
 Have you had any publications ? 
 How about your communication skills ? 
 Can I help you ? 
 Sure . When do you want to get it back ? 
 Yes , but we charge 50 % more and it only takes 3 hours . 
 30 yuan . 
 It should take us all the way up to Altadena . 
 I'm not positive if it does or not . 
 I have never been on this bus , but I'm sure it's the right one . 
 I know , and we've been on the bus forever . 
 Oh my gosh , that one says Temple City . 
 Well , now I know the bus that'll take us back . 
 Will do . 
 Ma'am , take your kid to school ? 
 No problem . Don't worry , the taxi is faster than the bus . 
 My son is the same . But he always makes an early start in the morning , and enjoys listening to the English programmer Let's talk in English on the way . 
 OK ! 
 It's 14.5 Yuan . 
 Thanks , Ma'am . 
 I see . Well , it's nothing spectacular , but it's pretty cheap for an apartment in a decent neighborhood ... O . K . , I think I'll take it . 
 I think I'll sign a nine-month lease in case I decide not to go to summer school . I can extend it if I want to stay , can't I ? 
 You did an excellent job in this project . 
 Congratulations . 
 Ha ... I am not sure . 
 Let me think . How much did you have in mind ? 
 That's a lot of money . Let me think about it carefully . 
 I came here to ask for some information . 
 I bought a pair of trousers last year , which I like the best . But this year they don ’ t fit me very well . They ’ re tight in the waist , baggy at the knees . Can you make some alterations ? 
 It seems I find the right place . 
 When can I have my trousers if I bring it to you tomorrow ? 
 All right . See you tomorrow . 
 Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know . Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more . 
 But don't you like this place ? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely . 
 Oh , why didn't you say so then ? But I still think we've made a good buy . 
 I know . But this year I want to get him an interesting tie . Like this one . 
 It's perfect ! It's a Dilbert tie ! 
 But watch this ... it bends upwards , just like Dilbert's tie . There's a wire inside . 
 Room service.May I help you ? 
 I am sorry for that.We will send someone to your room right now . 
 May I help you ? 
 I'm Mary Kelly . May I ask your name ? 
 I'm glad to meet you , Mr . Zhuang . Sit down , please . 
 What are your qualifications for being a clerk typist ? 
 Would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ? 
 Your typing and stenography are pretty good . Would you be interested in applying for the job ? 
 All right . You need to have an interview with our manager , Mr . McBride . Let's go to his office . 
 Hi . Fill it up please . Premium . 
 Oh , can you check my oil and tires while you're at it ? 
 OK , it's open . 
 Oh . Where can I add some air to my tires ? 
 Good . How much does it come to ? 
 Steven , have a rest . Could you have a talk with me ? 
 Janice has just got sick and I need a hand now . Could you come here earlier tomorrow morning ? 
 Let me think . About half past seven if it is okay for you . 
 Do you have cheongsams ? 
 The styte is OK . Which country is this made in ? 
 Please wrap it . 
 Well , it is hard to say . At least you need to come up with a good reason . 
 Yes , you should be there . Go find the manager and ask . I think the manager will understand and approve you a day off . Don ’ t forget to fill in the leave application form . It will be signed by the manager for approval . 
 Do you have any apartment to rent ? 
 Where is it . 
 Is it furnished ? 
 That's good . When can I go to see the house ? 
 Fine . 
 The notice you received is a 30 - day notice to vacate . 
 I mentioned to you before that you need to keep up with your rent . This notice to evict is letting you know that I mean business . 
 You have 30 days to catch up on your rent , or a sheriff will evict you . 
 You can stay , but you might think about looking for a less expensive living arrangement if you are having trouble making the payments . 
 Thank you . The payment needs to be in the form of cash or a cashier ’ s check . 
 Ah ! You're bleeding all over ! What happened ? 
 Here , use this rag to apply pressure to the cut . Does it hurt ? 
 You may just need stitches . I think they can handle this at the clinic instead of the ER . Let me make a quick phone call . 
 Oh , sorry ! I forgot you get queasy with the sight of blood . I'll be right there . 
 From 9 to 12 a . m . , and 2 to 6 p . m . 
 Of course , if necessary . 
 Seldom . 
 Your quantity sold is beyond the required by more than 30 % . 
 What's in it , please ? 
 OK . You may wrap it now . Please fill in this form and label it . ( after a moment ) Would you like it registered ? 
 Nine dollars and fifty cents . 
 Here's the receipt . 
 You're welcome . 
 Really ? What about your opinion , Daniel ? 
 I don't really know where I want to go . I am having trouble thinking of a particular restaurant . 
 OK , we could look at that . 
 I really like Japanese or Thai food . 
 Oh yeah ! I saw a review of that restaurant on television . The reviewer loved it ! 
 That would work out great ! Why don't we call and get a reservation ? 
 That ’ s true . We had an argument yesterday . She blamed me for not preparing the supper that day , but it was her turn to cook the dinner . 
 Yes . 
 That wasn ’ t my fault , but she said ' you're a disgrace ' to me . I'm about to explode ! 
 To be honest , I ’ m not , and I regret a little what I have done . 
 No way . It ’ s her who should apologize . 
 Hello , is that Miss Smith ? 
 This is Mr.Gao . How are you ? 
 Fine . Listen . Are you free on Wednesday night ? I'd like to invite you to dinner . 
 That's a pity . How about Thursday ? 
 Great . What time would you like to meet ? 
 OK , let's say 6 
 I can pick you up at the gate of your company . Also , what type of food do you like ? 
 Well , have you heard of Peking Duck ? it's a local specialty . 
 OK , let's have that then . 
 See you later , goodbye . 
 Hiring , firing , training , insurances , benefits , retirement plans , salary , vacation . 
 But most of time , they provide assistances . 
 Say if the Engineering Department wants to hire a person , they will request HR to find candidates . 
 The Engineering Manager and his team will interview the candidates . HR will also be involved with the interview , but basically arranging the schedule and explaining the benefits . 
 Then the Engineering Manager will choose the candidate . 
 What are you going to do with that vase , Penny ? 
 Don ’ t do that . Give it to me . 
 I ’ m going to put it here , in front of the window . 
 There we are ! It ’ s a lovely vase . 
 I am sorry to make you run down to the office for me . 
 I need help with my timesheet . 
 Yes , I have seen them . 
 Yes , I understand what to do . 
 What ? Huh ? 
 Huh ? What ? 
 I thought you said this was easy . 
 Mr . Black , when is the earliest shipment you can make ? 
 I am afraid shipment by early May would be too late for us . Our customs formalities are quite complicated , and it takes time to distribute the goods to the farmers in our country . The fertilizers must be delivered before April , or else we can't be in time for the spring sowing . 
 You understand a timely delivery is very important to us . 
 Would you like some drinks ? 
 We have various kinds of wine . As for an appetizer , I advise you to order white wine or dry white wine . 
 Thank you so much for interviewing me this evening . 
 I like to work alone on some things and then bring those things to the group . 
 I want to grow in my job and move ahead . 
 I need to stay in the area because of my family . 
 75,000 per year . 
 There ’ re traffic jams everywhere . 
 Yeah . We should have more roads built . 
 Excuse me , Mr . Emory ? 
 Could you tell me where the copier is , please ? 
 Woo hoo ! This just might be the start of the rest of my life ! 
 I ’ m in the market for a job ! I went on a website with hundreds of job listings in the area and browsed through them until I got the names of a few employers I would like to work for . I have the resume I wrote for English class last month and a cover letter will be a piece of cake to write . I ’ Ve even done my research and found the names of the managers so I can address the letters personally . And you know I can be charming in interviews . Goodbye my penniless days ! Hello salary and a career ! 
 Oh , just for a position as a gas station attendant . You know , starting at a simple lowly job , just like all the greats before they made it big in the world . 
 But I ’ m just in it for the money , right ? How else am I going to be able to afford to keep taking Angela to the movies ? Besides , I love the smell of gasoline , don ’ t you ? 
 Sure . Let's buy it . 
 Hi Amy . What's up ? 
 No , sorry . I don't know . 
 Sure , it's over there . 
 Across the street . 
 No problem . 
 Yes , there's one here . It's in the store . 
 Bye . 
 Of course , I ’ Ve enjoyed it very much . I ’ Ve met my old friends and made some new friends . 
 Sometime next year . 
 The same to you . Keep in touch . 
 Well , we just got in some mangoes . 
 Well , it's a fruit with a big nut in it . 
 No , you peel off the skin and throw out the nut . 
 Well , the sale price is $ 1 each . 
 They're like a citrus fruit . 
 You can buy them hard . Wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel . 
 Most of them in this store are from Mexico . 
 What's the matter ? 
 Let me see . 
 No , the damage is minor . 
 4:00 p . m .. 
 How was your morning jog ? 
 To be honest , I ’ d rather watch television ! Where did you go ? 
 Oh you ought to go to the park next time . They have a route for joggers there . 
 Oh ok then , I ’ ll come and watch you ! 
 Yes , please . 
 Fine , thank you . Are you coming for the interview as a secretary ? What's your name ? 
 Nice to meet you , too . Miss Li . please have a seat . I am Peter Smith , the General Manager . 
 Yes , please . My son wants to go overseas , to England , to do his Master degree . I wondered if you offer any kind of loan that could assist him in doing so ? 
 I see . What does it entail ? I'm not sure if we will be eligible . 
 So , we could use it to pay for my son's living expenses , not just his tuition ? 
 That is good to know . Just think ! We've been worrying about this for weeks and just a short visit here and my mind is at ease . Thank you . 
 Once in a while . 
 One of the reasons for our good quality products is because of our quality inspection system , which is the best of its kind . 
 We have trained analyzers to do quality analysis at the end of each part when we make the product . This means that no mistakes are made . 
 Certainly . We provide quality analysis training as part of the training for all new workers , plus a week of further training every year . 
 Yes , are you Mr James ? 
 That's right . 
 Of course not . My name is Li Ping . Is this all your baggage ? 
 Welcome to Hong Kong . I'll go and get the car . Could you please wait a few minutes ? 
 Fill it up , please . 
 No , thank you . I don't have time . How much is that ? 
 Did you call me , sir ? 
 What am I expected to do ? 
 I see . It must be a challenging job , but I would like to do it . And what about now ? 
 OK , I'll get to work on it at once . 
 I hope so . I'm looking for some material for a paper I'm writing , and I'm not quite sure where to look . 
 My paper is on the influence of television on children . 
 Thank you for you help . 
 It means young girls . That's where you'll find clothes for young girls . 
 You're small , but you're not a child . 
 There's a petite section that you an check out . 
 It has clothes in small sizes for small women . 
 Where to ? 
 Certainly . Let's put the suitcase in the boot . 
 Take it easy . We should be able to make it unless we get caught in a traffic jam . 
 Don't worry . The traffic is smooth . You will be there in time for your flight . 
 Client Services ? Oh , hello . I need your help . 
 I'm a tourist in this city and unfortunately I've lost my card ! 
 Credit Card . The International Credit Card , I can't find it anywhere . 
 I'm not 100 % sure , around an hour ago I guess . I had it in the hotel lobby bar ; I used it to charge something to my room . I obviously didn't pick it up again . 
 Thank you . Thank you very much . 
 I'd like a one-inch photo for my interview . 
 I want to fetch them in 3 days . 
 I think I prefer train . It's cheaper and safe . 
 Yes , I am an outgoing person who likes to be with a lot of friends . 
 Well , the most important thing in communication is your sincerity . 
 This is Brown speaking . I'd like to speak to Mr.Tomas . 
 I've been trying to call him for the last ten minutes , but your line was busy . Will he be back soon ? 
 Is there any other way I can reach him ? 
 I have a business appointment with him at ten o'clock tomorrow morning , but I'm afraid I can't make it . 
 Unfortunately , I'm leaving here unexpectedly , and I may be away for several days . 
 Thank you . 
 Are you trying to lose weight ? 
 You don ’ t have to starve yourself to lose weight . I think that ’ s where you ’ re going wrong . 
 Not really . You should try to not eat foods high in calories , salts or saturated fats . Stay away from oily food and artificial flavors . 
 Yes ! You can also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates and foods that are high in cholesterol . You can have steamed veggies or increase your protein intake found in chicken or fish . 
 Don ’ t count on it . 
 Employee welfare ? What all does that include ? 
 What kind of considerations are we talking about ? 
 Our company now has n ombudsman ? 
 I have finished filling in the forms . Can I go to my room now ? 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , but can you show me the other colour ones ? 
 No , I don't like the brown one . 
 Good , I like it . 
 It is extremely beautiful.This is the very thing I've been dreaming of.Please put in a gift box for me . 
 Can you make a suit for me to measure ? 
 That's fine . 
 OK . 
 There ’ s so much I want to do . I ’ Ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . I just ran a search for music to download . 
 Thanks . That would be very helpful . I ’ Ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . There ’ s too much information on the net . 
 Yes , I did . There ’ s an anti-virus programme with my email account that scans all attachments , so I ’ m sure I haven ’ t sent anything nasty to anyone . 
 That ’ s good advice . I should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself , such as my password and credit car number . 
 How do I do that ? 
 That ’ s useful to know . Thanks . I ’ ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee . 
 Here you are . seventy-five cent , please . 
 Is there anything valuable in it ? 
 Shall I make out a receipt ? 
 That ‘ ll be ninety-five cents in all . 
 I am sorry to hear that . You have to fill out a claim form . 
 Here you are . 
 I'd rather not have it if you don't mind . I'll have soup instead . I'm supposed to be on a diet . 
 Which route are you interested in ? 
 That's a good choice . 
 We have parties every Saturday from June to October . 
 Good morning . I want to remit 1,000 yuan to my sister in Shanghai . 
 OK ... Do I need to put on my sister's name for the receiver ? 
 OK , I see . Here you are . Is that OK now ? 
 Here you are . What is the rate ? 
 OK . When will this remittance arrive ? 
 That's good . 
 I think I ’ m very good at planning . I manage my time perfectly , so that I can always get things done on time . 
 Because I ’ m very competent in this area . 
 Yes , I work well under pressure and find it dimly . However , I believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines . 
 I don ’ t try to go ahead of people and lead them , I ’ d rather cooperate with everybody else and get the job done by working together . 
 She's in a meeting until noon . 
 Ok , thank you . 
 You have probably noticed that our products ' prices are competitive . Besides . we can provide more superior products than other companies at the same price . 
 It means that if you place a big order , we usually allow 15 % for a trade discount . And our products feel more slip , colorful and faddish than others . You can have a look . 
 We always sell the best . You can believe us at this point . 
 Within 2 weeks once we receive your orders . 
 French dressing , please . 
 Oh , French dressing . 
 We still prefer French dressing . 
 Who's your manager ? Tell me ! Would you ? 
 The ink should be next to the paper clips and thumb tacks in the stationary section , sir . 
 Then I'm afraid there's none in stock . 
 They come in packages of ten or twenty . 
 On counter three . 
 I know . It took me three weeks , and I work here . 
 All staff can enjoy the health insurance program . 
 Employees are covered by worker's compensation insurance . 
 I have been a salesman . 
 I am in charge of the trading department . 
 I ’ m working in a small company where further promotion is impossible . 
 I never easily give up something that is valuable . Before I decided to quit that position , I had made a thorough analysis of things like what I would gain and what I would lose here in your company . You know , Shanghai is always a fascinating place to me , full of challenges as well as hopes . In addition to this , I have the specialized knowledge and the necessary experience of making a good . Of course , opportunities to work abroad and a higher salary are also important to me . So I believe it ’ s worthwhile to come here to work . 
 I'm very much interested in the position . 
 I believe I would have better opportunities with a small but rapidly expanding company like yours . 
 I've only washed my white clothes . 
 Is there any special care I should take with your clothes ? 
 Are there a lot of clothes ? 
 It's a medium load . 
 No big deal . I'll do it for you . 
 You're welcome . 
 Yes , of course . It seems made to measure . 
 $ 120 . 
 It ' s an Indian restaurant ! I know you have never had Indian food , so I thought you might want to try . 
 Well , Indian cuisine actually doesn ' t serve beef . You see , cows are a sacred animal , a very important element in the Hindu religion , so beef is not eaten . 
 There are many amazing dishes to choose from . We can have some chicken tikka masala which is an amazing curry . It ' s a bit spicy , but I think you can handle it . 
 Yeah . Also , we can have some Naan bread which is baked in a tandoori oven . Since you don ' t use any utensils to eat , you can use this bread to scoop up the curry or rice . 
 They have a good variety of vegetable-based dishes like talak panter , vegetable samosas or daal . 
 Okay , Doctor , tell it to me straight . 
 I've tried before . Everything I've tried doesn't work . 
 May I see that x-ray again ? 
 And that is what's causing my shortness of breath . 
 Can I help you , madam ? 
 Would you like to try this one on ? 
 All right . How about this one ? 
 Of course , madam . 
 Yes , I know . 
 Oh , no . We just did it last week . 
 I'd rather wash the clothes . 
 Oh , My God ! So much ! 
 We need to call an emergency meeting as soon as possible about this . 
 Schedule it for this afternoon , when Ken gets back . 
 Oh , that ’ s right . Go ahead anyways . I ’ ll fill him in . We can ’ t lose this order under any circumstances ! 
 I want to find an old music box . 
 Do you have anything made in the 1920s ? 
 Do any of them have dancing figures ? 
 That's fantastic . I think I like this one . 
 Now , is there any warranty with this ? 
 I understand . 
 Shall we start decorating the bedroom ? 
 When ? 
 May I take your order ? 
 Yes , take your time , please . 
 Fine . 
 The special today is steak . 
 What would you like to go with your steak ? 
 I see . What would you like for dessert ? 
 Let's see . I had the salmon starter which was £ 5.90 and my Pizza was £ 8.25 . 
 So that's £ 14.15 for me and £ 16.50 for you . 
 Yes , so that's an extra £ 6 for both of us . 
 And I had a dessert - that's another £ 3.50 . And you had coffee which is £ 2 . 
 Yes , this is everything on the list . 
 Yes , that's exactly it . How much tip shall we give the waiter ? 
 Hello ! Is Mr . Green there ? 
 This is Li with Silk Company . We met last Sunday during the exhibition . 
 Thank you for visiting our products . I remember that you are interested in our silk products and so , could I have a meeting with you this week to show you moreinformation about our products ? 
 What about next week ? Is it convenient for you ? 
 Any time you say is OK . 
 Where did you study accounting ? 
 Did you intern anywhere ? 
 That must have been stressful . 
 I'll bet . 
 Hello . Mr . Zhang . It's Mary . 
 I'm afraid we're really staffed this week , Mr . Li . I'd like to meet you , but I'm sorry I really can't . 
 Not at all , sir . I'd just like to delay our meeting to next week , I'll have time at the beginning of next week . 
 How about Monday morning at 9 a . m . ? 
 Good afternoon , Mrs . White . 
 Can I see Mr . Cooper , your manager now ? 
 All right . 
 Thanks a lot , Mrs . White . 
 Jack , I think it's best that I actively ask for the results of interview . 
 I think so , too . What do you think about that I write a letter of inquiry to the company ? 
 Good idea . It is convenient and fast . 
 Certainly . 
 I think that about one hundred words are enough . 
 OK , I know now . 
 I can ’ t just now , Susan . Could we get together this afternoon ? What ’ s it about ? 
 Oh , that ’ s right . Is that time of the year , huh ? That ’ s fine . How about if we meet at 3:30 this afternoon ? 
 Sorry , darling , I forgot . 
 I promise you'll have it tomorrow . 
 Me too . I ’ ll see you after work , huh ? 
 Sure . Meet me at five . 
 What ’ s up ? 
 Anything that distracts you from work ? 
 Look , Lucy . Things are not so bad as you said . This is our company ’ s busiest time in a year . You need to relax a little . Don ’ t push yourself too hard , ok ? 
 Oh , no ! My stub ! I can't believe it — I flushed it down the toilet ! 
 But , but ... it was really an emergency ! And , my stub ... 
 Ah , umm , kind of . 
 Well , I , umm , I flushed it ... 
 Your car is rather old.Why not change a new one ? 
 Oh , there is a car exhibition tomorrow afternoon . I have two tickets.Would you like to go there with me ? 
 And the bank will offer you loans for twenty years ! 
 I ’ m afraid we ’ re in for a rough weekend , Marry . There is a storm system moving through the East Coast . It will be drizzling all day today , and there ’ s a 60 percent chance of thunderstorms this evening . It will be warm and humid all weekend . In the Midwest , expect strong winds and a low of around 40 degrees . 
 Unfortunately , yes . It will be clear early Saturday morning but there is a high chance of showers and thunderstorms later in the day . There is a severe thunderstorm warning for some parts of the Southeast . Folks in those areas might see some hail and flooding , especially in areas that have been experiencing record high rainfalls . 
 It gets better on Sunday , though . The storm systems move east and the skies will clear up at night . It will still be rather cool , with highs in the low 50s . The West Coast will be experiencing some unusually chilly weather , but at least the sun will come out . I advise weekend travelers to be careful , especially while driving . Back to you , Mark . 
 Do you have any English newspapers ? 
 I'd like to see some Mandarin textbooks too . Do you have any ? 
 Thank you . 
 All right . I'm nearly ready . What time does the bus leave ? 
 Oh , we've got plenty of time . 
 All right . Let's go . 
 John , could you come to my office ? I need to talk to you . 
 No . Come here right now . 
 What's the matter ? 
 Why ? I work very hard . 
 Well , some of those other guys are not the same kind I'd like to communicate with , but if that's important to you . I'll try to get along with them . 
 It's unfair . 
 OK . I need to think about that for a while . 
 Thank you for coming so quickly . 
 A pipe in my apartment is leaking . 
 The pipe is in my bathroom . 
 The pipe has been leaking for a couple days . 
 Yes , I ’ m aware of that . 
 I just need the problem fixed . 
 What do you think of this dress ? Do you think it suits me ? 
 It ’ s just the right size-a perfect fit ! Have you seen anything you like ? 
 It looks too big for you , but I like the color and the material is good quality . Is it on sale ? 
 I might get one too , but in a different colour . I prefer light blue to while . 
 I ’ m getting this beret – doesn ’ t it look cool ? I ’ d like to get some jeans too , but I don ’ t have enough cash on me . 
 Thanks ! Now I don ’ t need to come back to the shop a second time . 
 Yeah , I could tell that . That ’ s no problem . I can probably get it re-done by tomorrow . When ’ s our meeting with the boss ? 
 Then , we ’ Ve got plenty of time . 
 Oh , how annoying ! 
 Is's infuriating ! I have to be in Rome by five . 
 I want to see a dentist . 
 OK , thank you . 
 I think this is it . Get off . 
 I have no idea . 
 It doesn't look right to me . 
 I think we did . 
 I really thought this was our stop . 
 Maybe we should just wait for the next bus . 
 Good morning . I ’ m looking for a new jacket . 
 I like this jacket . Can I try it on ? 
 Thanks . 
 No problem . 
 Good . Anything else ? The tie pins ? The cuff links ? 
 Ok . We have several kinds of scarves here . Let me get them for you . Just wait a minute . 
 This is the rush hour . 
 Let ’ s drive off this road . 
 So , are we all ready to go ? 
 Did you get the camera ? 
 Yup , it ’ s all set . 
 I ’ m sure ... we ’ Ve got all our bases covered . 
 Um ... do you think we can make a pit stop ? 
 I know , but I forgot to go to the bathroom before we left . 
 Yes , I have . Here are my blouse , coats and stockings . 
 Oh , yes . My husband also has some laundry . This is his suit and here is his pajamas . 
 Oh , no . Only the suit and coat are to be dry-cleaned . I want to have my blouse tomorrow evening . And I'd like the collar and cuffs starched . 
 Exactly . Is it possible to have my overcoat dry-cleaned , too ? 
 Oh , no . I also need this tomorrow evening . 
 That's a good idea . 
 Yes , I noticed it yet . 
 Oh , thanks a lot . 
 Never mind , it doesn't matter . 
 We are sorry for our fault . 
 Thank you for your understanding . 
 You should unplug the phone . 
 Do you want me to wake you in an hour ? 
 I'll start dinner at 6:00 . 
 If not , your nose will wake you up . 
 You might even dream about dinner . 
 Have a nice nap . 
 What kind are you going to make ? 
 I really like Caesar salads . 
 What kind of salad do you want to make ? 
 I love chicken salads . 
 That sounds really tasty . 
 I think that I will . 
 With pleasure . What color do you like ? 
 It costs 275 yuan , Miss . 
 Sorry , we don't give discounts . 
 Where did this come from ? 
 It sure is hot . Why don't we go in the Haunted House ? At least it will be air conditioned . 
 Well . Maybe I'll go alone then . I really don't want to miss it . 
 It might take a long time . Because there is a line , you know . 
 Thanks . 
 I'm sorry it took so long . 
 Is there a vacant table for 2 right now ? 
 what a pity . 
 OK . 
 I'm just fine , thanks , Jane . I'd like to make a withdrawal from my Current Account , please . 
 That might be a good idea , yes . 
 I think 2,000 RIB will suffice , thanks . 
 No , I don't think I have . But I would like to hear the full details , if you think it'll be beneficial to me . 
 Oh , really ? Isn't this spot C408 ? 
 I'm sorry , I must have been confused . I had thought it's C section , but actually it's D section . I'll move my car right away . 
 What's your favorite magazine ? 
 What kind of magazine is it ? 
 Really ? It is a weekly , isn't it ? 
 Does it enjoy popularity among the young generation ? 
 Oh , I think I should try to read one . 
 Yes . What kept you from arriving on time ? 
 I realize that everyone has emergencies ; just get here on time from now on . 
 I appreciate you saying that and would like you to join us in our meeting . 
 Wonderful , does anyone have any questions about this project ? 
 I'm glad that some of you get it , but let's go over it once more . 
 Don ’ t dress like that . You ’ ll make fool yourself . You look stupid in that robe . 
 Maybe it is . But it ’ s out of fashion . 
 Let ’ s go downtown and pick up some fashionable clothes for you . 
 Oh , no . You should take the No . 14 tram . 
 Two blocks down the street . 
 Yes . I'm sorry , but I've lost my passbook . 
 About RIB 12,000 . 
 I'm Bob Brown . But I can't recall my account number . 
 Thank goodness . It is still there . Thank you very much . 
 OK . 
 Trust me . She'll keep nagging . She thinks something will go wrong . 
 You guessed it . She says we have to get married on January 2nd , or we'll have bad luck . 
 My mom just wants everything to be perfect for us . 
 Will this do ? Your major is not related to banking , as you know . 
 Money is not the only standard to decide your career . In fact , there are more important things you can refer to when evaluating your career . If I were you , I would choose one I like to do . 
 Don't worry . We can always change our careers , when we are unsatisfied with them . 
 This is Room 603 . I'm afraid that the heating system doesn't work . It's very cold here . 
 Yes . I have switched it on for a long time . The room is still very cold . 
 I prefer not to move first . 
 Yes , please . 
 I only started looking for a job a few days ago . 
 yes , I was precise with every word in my resume ? 
 absolutely , I've highlighted all my strengths and the resume is clear and easy to read . 
 a cover letter ? I've never thought about that . Won't a CV do for my job application ? 
 sounds reasonable.Even if I'm the right one for the job , many people are applying for the same vacancy at the same time , so I should try my best to catch the Human Resources manager's attention . 
 got it . I'll start right now . 
 Yes , I have a spare room . 
 Would you come here in twenty minutes ? We're right in the middle of dinner . 
 Yes , it has two bedrooms . That's convenient . 
 2,500 yuan a month . 
 Hello ? Ms . Patterson ? This is Bill from Workmate calling . I'm just wondering if you had a chance to look over the estimate I sent for your gala dinner project next month ... As I said in my email , we can help you with production according to your needs , but we will only be able to give insite management support services on a limited basis . 
 Yes , I have several copies , but they're all different versions ... The latest I have is version 12 , is that current ? 
 Hold on , let me pull up your version 7 requirements ... Oh yes , no wonder our estimate is a little different from what you had in mind . I see the version 7 also includes 6 additional hostesses and a cocktail self-serve bar that wasn't in the version 12 . That will definitely add to your cost on this project ... 
 Are you saying we don ’ t have time to watch our favorite show tonight ? Jane , you know I really don ’ t like our teacher all that much . He gives far too much homework . He criticizes me in front of everyone all the time . 
 Yes , and he also ... 
 Probably not . After all he is our teacher . We should try to find something nice to say . If you can ’ t say something nice you shouldn ’ t say anything at all . 
 All right . I want to take a shower first , I ’ m exhausted . 
 Nice to meet you . How can I help you ? 
 Certainly , Mr . Murphy . Could you come to my office this afternoon at 2:30 ? 
 That's a good idea , Charlotte . 
 Just a little please . 
 No , less than that . One and a half teaspoonfuls please . That's enough for me . That was very nice . 
 Yes , please . I'd like a cigarette , too . May I have one ? 
 I'm afraid it's empty . 
 It doesn't matter . 
 That's very good advice ! 
 It depends . 
 Um . It ’ s delicious . 
 Not all of it . 
 Hi , Peter ! How are you ? 
 Very well , thanks . 
 Really ? Wow , it is great . 
 I suppose so . It's great . 
 Yes , is there a coffee machine around here ? 
 Where is the break room ? 
 Got it . 
 Thank you . 
 I ’ m thinking about where we shall spend our vocation . 
 Ok , dear.We will be late . 
 A ham salad sandwich . 
 Then , I ’ d like some eggs and bread for breakfast instead . 
 alright , tell me what you think . 
 yeah , maybe you ’ re right . How about this outfit ? 
 no , I don't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just had to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It ’ s casual , yet sophisticated . 
 how about this scarf , these earrings , and an anklet ? 
 that ’ s a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense . 
 yep . Here it is . What do you think ? 
 the leopard print sounds fabulous . Are they a name brand ? 
 that ’ s even better than the real thing . 
 it ’ s too bad I did all that shopping yesterday ! 
 Most of it is . You should sign up . 
 Didn't you read about Paypal and Bidpai ? They are very safe . 
 That's the last three or four numbers on the back of your credit card where your signature is . 
 Janice , do you still remember how our filing system works ? 
 Very good . What is the essence of filing , do you know ? 
 Yes , ' One customer--one file ' is essential . And remember to update them timely . 
 Correct . 
 Yes , prompt and careful filing contributes greatly to the efficiency of our office . 
 Sure , honey . I'll read you a bed time story , too . 
 Don't worry , you'll sleep well tonight . 
 Evan , are you busy right now ? 
 Well , I need a hand with the fax machine . My fax is not going through . 
 Ah , thanks . 
 It's two blocks down the road . 
 Pardon me ? 
 Oh , I see . I'll have beer , please . 
 Thank you.How much is it ? 
 Are you sure ? Then , I will have more beer , please . 
 So can we play PlayStation later ? 
 All my games are so lame , Mom . When can I get a new one ? 
 Right on . I'm gonna get a new game ! 
 I knew there would be a catch ! 
 Except housework , that is . 
 OK . 
 Go ahead . 
 I would like to open a checking account . 
 Here you are . 
 I don't know , sir . What's the number of your car ? 
 When did you bring it to us ? 
 Ah yes , I remember now . 
 No , they're still working on it . Let's go into the garage and have a look at it.Isn ' t that your car ? 
 Didn't you have a crash ? 
 Well , they're trying to repair it , sir . But to tell you the truth , you need a new car . 
 certainly , i love waltz very much . 
 a couple of times a week . i've got a regular dancing partner . he is really some dancer 
 For most of the articles in the catalog , we have good supply . 
 Thanks . I'll look into it and let you have our firm offers tomorrow . 
 You'll find our prices very favorable . 
 Either can be done , though we usually quote on CIF basis . 
 Certainly . We can work them out for you . 
 Good morning.Are you through with the cleaning ? If not , we'll come back a little later . 
 It doesn't take much time . I ' m used to tidying up my room myself . 
 I have a suit that needs cleaning . 
 May I see the manager of your office ? 
 Thank you . I am Fred , coming from Future Clothes Company . I've brought some catalogues of our new series of the summer clothes . I wonder if your manager would like to have a look at them . 
 We are suppliers of the summer clothes of various styles and colors . I think you will be interested in some of our new products . We always keep the pace of the clothes fashion , so as to catch the interest of our customers . 
 As you know , we also take orders for clothes made according to specifications . 
 Two months at most . 
 Yes , of course , here you are . The prices are subject to our confirmation . 
 Thank you for inviting me . 
 Yes . I was in charge of profit and loss for the northwest region of Canada . As a manager , I was directly responsible for a 50 % increase in sales over a four-month period . 
 I believe persistence and perseverance are key attributes . 
 Lamb and beef . It will get even tastier when we add the veggies ! 
 So ? 
 You'll be OK . It's just a little bit ... 
 I'm just trying to complete today's crossword puzzle . Whenever I get the time , I like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper . 
 I guess you could say that . What kind of games do you like ? 
 doesn't everyone ? Which games are those ? 
 did you play a lot of games when you were little ? 
 do you still like playing those games ? 
 everyone in my family really enjoys playing card games . 
 no , I prefer to play with people I know . 
 it's a popular game with some people , but I've never played it . 
 I hate to disappoint you , but unlike what most people think , we aren't all exactly the same ! 
 Yes , I would like to look at some of your products . 
 Well , to be honest , I mostly use Sarah Winter products now.But I'm not happy with them . So I would like to change companies . 
 What do you have in foundation ? 
 What colors do you have in foundation ? 
 The color I use now is rose.How much does this rose foundation cost ? The 100ml bottle . 
 Wow ! That's expensive . 
 I understand . I need some mascara too.Do you have a good thickening mascara ? 
 Alright . And I want to consider your eye shadow too.Do you have a color chart I can look at ? 
 Oh , sure . I will need to clean off my own eye shadow first . 
 Thank you . 
 I ’ m sorry she is not in at the moment . Can I take a message ? 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 We could make it lower for you . What's your counter-offer ? 
 If you order in large lots , we'll accept the price . 
 All right , as a token of friendship , we accept your counter-offer . 
 Good morning . How can I help you ? 
 Have you filled out an application form ? 
 Yes . I'll just have my assistant look over these quickly and then we'll move on to the next step . Did you want to open up a checking account and a savings account ? 
 Yes . Actually , both accounts come with cards that you can use in ATM machines , so that you won't have to come in to the bank to make a transaction . 
 It is . Our customers really like it . Do you have any other questions about your new accounts ? 
 The maximum is $ 1000 . 
 Yes , but it's not much . You just have to pay 1 % interest on the account . It's much lower rate than any of our loans and it's much better than owing money to most credit cards . 
 They're all in order . If you just sign your name here , you'll receive your cards and pin numbers in the mail in about three weeks . 
 You're welcome . 
 Hi , Martin . What can I do for you ? 
 That ’ s all right . Bring me over what you ’ Ve got . 
 Sure . I ’ Ve never seen a dragon boat race . 
 As long as I don ’ t have to row . 
 Yes . Do you accept traveler's checks ? 
 Very good . 
 Yes , I have my driver's license . 
 Well Rebecca , is there anything else you need to know for now ? 
 Okay well listen , here is my business card with my mobile number . If any other questions spring to mind don ’ t hesitate to contact me . Of course you can also call Miss Childs too . 
 Well , we are finishing the shortlist interviews tomorrow , so we will certainly have a decision made by early next week . Miss Childs will call you to discuss more on Monday or Tuesday . How does that so 
 The pleasure ’ s all mine , Rebecca . 
 Absolutely . Thanks for coming Rebecca . Goodbye . 
 I am here on business . 
 Of course , here you are . 
 They are two cameras . 
 Yes , I have one carton of cigarettes and a bottle of whiskey . 
 Hi ! This is Tome Smith . 
 Is my VCR ready ? 
 May I have a look at that vase , please ? 
 Oh , it's really nice , but to tell the truth , that's far too expensive . 
 How do you like the apartment ? 
 What ’ s wrong ? 
 That isn ’ t a problem . 
 What can I do ? 
 I can ’ t right now . 
 I will fix it for you . 
 Hello , it's my first time in Egypt . What would you advise me to see here ? 
 But I'm going to stay here only for two days . 
 What shall I do then ? 
 It's really worth seeing . By the way , I'd like to buy some souvenirs . 
 OK . I know what to do now . Thank you . 
 Yes , I ’ d like to buy this dress , please . 
 Great . 
 I want to use a credit card . Do you take Discover ? 
 I ’ ll put it on my Visa card , then . 
 There must be something wrong with the system . Try my MasterCard . 
 Sure . 
 Thanks . You have a good one , too . 
 Sure ... first you're going to have to buy a ticket to ride on the subway . The Wudaokou station is on the lightrail , so you'll have to transfer . Be sure you buy a combination ticket for the regular subway and the lightrail . It should cost you 5 yuan . 
 You can take the red line train from here , but you'll have to transfer to the blue line at Fuxingmen transfer station . After you transfer , take the blue line that is heading north towards Fuchengmen . 
 You'll take the blue line until you reach Xizhimen . That's a big station , so there will likely be a lot of people getting off at that stop . You can transfer to the lightrail there , you'll have to exit the subway and present the unused portion of your combination ticket to the Ticketmaster , they'll give you a new ticket to use on the lightrail system . 
 No , not the really , don't worry about it , like I said there'll be a lot of people there doing the same thing that you are doing , so just follow the crowd , There's only one direction to go , so you won't get on the wrong train . Head north on the Yellow line , and you'll see Wudaokou in just a couple of stops . 
 Is that true ? I can't believe it . There are always some meetings in this company . 
 But , my overwork has not done yet . And it is driving me crazy . 
 What's the meeting for ? 
 I will be there after 20 minutes . 
 Let me check . It has a paper jam . 
 Be careful , the cartridge can be very hot . 
 When you hired me , you knew you were going to be low on cash , didn't you ? 
 I know how it works . You don't want to give away any more of your future profits than you have to . 
 Good afternoon . Lotus Catering Company . Lilian speaking . May I help you ? 
 I see , Mr . Baker . How many people are you planning to invite and how much would you like to spend per person ? 
 hi . Could you give me a hand with this report ? 
 thanks . Would you mind taking a look at the layout ? Do you think it ’ s appropriate ? I want it to be formal , but not boring to look at . 
 that ’ s an excellent suggestion . I can easily do it on the computer . 
 I ’ ll take that suggestion too . How about the content ? 
 is it ok to include the pictures ? 
 thanks for those ideas . I ’ ll get to work on them right away . 
 Yes . I'd like to make a plane reservation to Shanghai , China . 
 Via Kiang . I'd like to leave on May 5th . 
 Well , I need an economy ticket . 
 Single . What's the fare , PLS ? 
 I see . Is my ticket confirmed then ? 
 Thank you . 
 No , I'm afraid we'll have to cancel the order . I'm not sure whether it agrees with me . 
 I'd prefer swordfish steak . 
 Oysters , please . 
 I want to find a book called Gone with the Wind . But I can't find it . 
 Margaret Mitchell . 
 Thank you very much . I have been looking for it for a long time . Is this the latest edition ? 
 How about the price of the hardcover ? 
 A little bit expensive , but I will buy one . This is $ 25 , here you are . 
 Thank you . Here is a copy of the Tour Guide Certificate of mine . 
 Yes , but I am on holidays this week . 
 I am bilingual , English and Russian . 
 I ’ d like a half a pound of ground beef , please . 
 Could I also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ? 
 No , that won ’ t do . I ’ ll take this smoked ham you have here . 
 Is this salami and bologna you have here ? 
 Sounds good . Okay , that ’ s it . 
 Mmm ... No that ’ s okay , really . I think that ’ s all for today . 
 What's the price ? I hope you'll quote us favorably . 
 Frankly speaking , the price you offer is too high . We can't accept it . 
 It certainly is . 
 I look at it this way , suppliers should be able to reduce their CIF price , even lower than their home price . 
 That's the point . Your overhead is in your domestic price , but it can't be carried in the CIF price . 
 I wish you could make a reconsideration . If you don't reduce your price , we won't purchase from you any more because there's plenty of other business offering here . 
 Every so often . It is very convenient and the price is lower than in stores . 
 Books , cosmetics , daily necessities , even large electrical appliance can be ordered from online-stores . 
 Even you can bargain with the owner of one on-line store , although he or she provides ' But It Now ' prices . 
 Some provide wrong pictures for the goods , so many buyers are deceived . 
 That's not fair ! 
 Um yes , I'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni , olives , and extra cheese . 
 Sure , that sounds good . 
 No , make the second one with ham , pineappleand green peppers . Oh , and make it thin crust . 
 Perfect . Thank you . Bye ... 
 OK , so are you ready to learn how to bake a cake ? 
 OK , so the first thing we are going to do is pre-heat the oven , that way we have it at the desired temperature once we finish preparing everything . Set it to three hundred and seventy five degrees Fahrenheit . 
 No we are gonna make the batter . Take some butter and sugar and mix it lightly until you have a nice consistency . Then add some vanilla extract and eggs and continue mixing . 
 Go ahead and use the mixer , but put it on medium speed . I'm gonna sift the flour and baking powder separately and then we can mix it with milk and the rest of the ingredients . 
 Yeah , but grease and flour it first so the cake won't stick to it when it bakes . 
 We can leave it in there for about twenty five minutes . Then we let it cool for ten minutes before we remove the cake from the pan . 
 OK , sir . Your suit will be available in five days . 
 Yes , you should pay half of the cost in advance . 
 Do you have a foreign tour ? 
 Sydney . 
 Well , the route 5 is really charming . Must I make a reservation ? 
 Hello . This is the front desk . What can I do for you ? 
 Sure . Anything else ? 
 Go ahead , please . 
 We ’ ll send someone right up . But don ’ t worry about that . Maybe the service person forgot to do it . 
 How much did you pay for the TV ? 
 200 bucks for a piece of junk like that ? That's a ripped-off . 
 It's not worth it . 
 What ’ s happened ? Is there a problem ? 
 You'll have to dismantle the unit and lubricate the bearings . Do it as quickly as you can but make sure you top up the oil before you start the motor up again . 
 Sure . Here you are . 
 Sorry , tomato soup is not being served today , but we have egg soup , it's very delicious . Why don't you try it today ? 
 Would you like to have a drink ? 
 Anything else ? 
 OK . I'll be back soon . 
 That ’ s a secret . I couldn ’ t tell you . 
 Does it look too small ? 
 I agree . I'm going to buy it . 
 I'll charge it . 
 There you go . 
 I need to get to PCC , but I don't know which bus to catch . 
 I'm coming from Fair Oaks and Las Flores Drive in Altadena . 
 I don't mind walking . 
 Tell me which direction it should be going . 
 Where do I get off ? 
 Thanks for your help . 
 It's time for desserts ! Are you still hungry ? 
 what are you going to try first ? 
 do they serve the yogurt with anything ? 
 that sounds good . I'm going to start with an Italian tiramisu . 
 ok . Mmm . 
 it's nice , but it's rather plain . Do you want to try my tiramisu ? 
 what do you think ? Does it taste good ? 
 I'm glad you like it . I don't care for it . Why don't you finish my tiramisu so that I can try one of those fried bananas ? 
 do you know where they are from . 
 do you want me to get you one , too ? 
 ok , I'll be back with two fried bananas in a few minutes . Wait for me here ! 
 I don't have time to talk to her now . 
 Thank you . 
 I had a terrific working relationship with my boss , even though we are very different people . Because I've had a number of bosses , I've come to realize that to make things work , you have to understand what's important to your boss . Then you have to do everything you can to support him ( or her ) . It's natural to think about your own agenda first , but if you help your boss , Ifs likely to move your agenda ahead at the same time . My last boss was great in that regard , she appreciated my efforts and rewarded me when I helped her accomplish her goals . 
 Many are important — intelligence , diligence , information and planning . But the most important , I think , is achieving results . 
 Certainly , do you have your school schedule ? The books are arranged by course number and instructor . 
 Thank you for coming tonight , Mrs . Webber . As a teacher , it's great seeing the kid's parents assist our parent-teacher conference night . 
 Well Allen is a great student . He is a hard worker and very well behaved , however he does struggle a bit with math . 
 Well , it's important that you sit with him and review his homework assignments and help him with math . I would also recommend he stay after school twice a week for tutoring sessions . It will really help a lot . 
 Um ... yes . Here is a notice from our financial department , seems your child's Tumion is overdue . 
 Could you tell me what university you went to , Mr . Smith ? 
 Did you ? And what did you study ? 
 Would you mind telling me how old you are ? 
 And could you tell me what other jobs you have had ? 
 And what was your salary at the bank ? 
 Can you give me a hand , Tom ? 
 Can you open this bottle for me ? The cork seems to be stuck . 
 Excuse me . 
 Can you tell me the way to the Peak Tram , please ? 
 Along Queen's Road ... 
 Right at the Hilton . 
 The Cathedral ? 
 That's very kind of you . Thank you . Er ... have you got a pencil ? 
 Can you repeat all that ? I think I'd better write it down . 
 I'm leaving for Shanghai tomorrow morning . When do I have to settle my bill ? 
 That will do . Where shall I go to pay the money ? 
 Would you please get the bill ready before supper ? 
 No , he will stay here for two more days . Please keep the room for him . 
 Two separate bills , please . 
 Will you give the bill to me at around six o'clock ? 
 I have had a good stay here . Your service is wonderful . I'm very satisfied with it . 
 OK , I will . 
 Not so bad , but Kevin does have problems with his wife . 
 His wife always complained that Kevin's salary was too low and got no promotion . 
 Yeah , I agree with you . But you know , it's just one of those things . 
 On which day ? 
 Well , let me check for you . Yes , you are booked already . It's a single room with a bath , facing the south . 
 Can you ship this batch of cotton within five or six weeks ? 
 Yes , mainly prints . There are a few plain as well . Here they are . 
 200 rolls of each . Make it 200 rolls for each sample . 
 Twenty prints and five plain . That makes 5,000 rolls in all . 
 Yes , five to six weeks . 
 Eight weeks ? We can wait that long . 
 Can't you make it seven weeks for the prints ? 
 That might be acceptable . I shall have to cable our Beijing office to get their approval . You can definitely supply in the time you've given me , I suppose . 
 That's right . 
 As soon as I hear from Beijing , that will be either Friday or Saturday . 
 I'll be checking out of the hotel in about 30 minutes . 
 Great ! As you know , however , the day in New York has hardly begun . 
 What can I do with my baggage while I visit a few more tourist spots ? 
 Isn't my baggage enough of a deposit ? 
 It's always something , isn't it ? Let me think about this for a second . 
 You're going go Dresden for sightseeing ? 
 I think a train journey is as fast as a bus journey . 
 so , which sport do you prefer---basketball or baseball ? 
 I thought everyone liked basketball . Why don't you like it ? 
 that makes sense . 
 my absolute favorite is ice hockey . 
 sure , many times . It's an exciting game for spectators to watch . 
 it's not that difficult . If you want to watch a game with me , I can explain the rules and the tactics while we're watching . 
 not for a while , but we could watch an old one on the internet so I can explain the game to you . 
 let's watch the Canadian team . They have a good manager and a great coach . 
 Sure . How much do you want ? 
 OK , here you are . Please sign your name here . 
 Excuse me , my skin is always dry , can you give me some advice ? 
 Will that work ? 
 Good afternoon . Welcome to Lincoln Bank , how can we be of service ?

 Yes , do you have a wine list ? 
 Do you have mixed drinks in this restaurant ? 
 I am not sure what I want . Do you have any house specials ? 
 That sounds good ! Please bring me one of those . 
 I would like it blended . 
 I would like my margarita with no salt , thank you . 
 Airmail or surface mail ? 
 Oh , anything up to 3 or 4 months for surface mail . It depends on the sailing of the ships . Airmail would only take 1 to 2 weeks . 
 Just let me weigh it for you . That's 2 lb . and 6 oz . That's be £ 10 . 
 Good moming.What can I do for you ? 
 OK , sir . Here is your bill.That ' s $ 1000 all together . 
 Of course , you can . 
 I'm looking for a citizen for my wife's birthday .

 Doctor , I have a bad cough and a headache . 
 I don't know , but I feel terrible .

 What would you suggest to see ?

 I bought one size up by mistake . 
 I wonder if you can change it to one size down . 
 Then I ’ ll come to your place later in the evening , and how late is your shop open ? 
 You bet it is . And we got four thousand for our car space ! Awesome ! 
 That's just what was running through my mind . Moonlight and dancing . 
 Come on baby , let's dance ! 
 Sorry , honey , something has cropped up again . I have to deal with it . Perhaps I will go to back home till very late . 
 Oh , come on . I will be back as early as possible . 
 I'm so thirsty . 
 That's a good idea . 
 I kind of want a soda . 
 What do you mean ? 
 What are you supposed to drink ? 
 I guess I will get water . 
 Hey Joe , how have you been ? 
 I am doing OK , Joe . 
 I can't because I already promised my roommate that I would go shopping with her . 
 Did you have a certain movie in mind ? 
 I kind of wanted to see “ The Secret Life of Bees . ”

 I graduated from the Beijing Foreign Studies University . My major is English Translation and Interpretation . 
 Yes , I can . Thank you so much .

 I am sorry . All the seats are booked . How about next Monday ? 
 OK , sir . I have added your name to the waiting list.We will call you as soon as possible . 
 Look , there's no way we can convince people they need fresh motor oil every morning . 
 It tastes funny . Why can't people just stick to plain and simple coffee ? 
 Where is our son , dear ? 
 What happened ? Have you talked with him ? 
 Operator ! Operator ! 
 Yes , I was talking to a party . We were disconnected . 
 Thank you . 
 Well , it is like a shop but the things here are quite cheap . 
 $ 5 . 
 Sure . Here you are . 
 I really love this kind of atmosphere . 
 There are people everywhere.What ' s that girl doing ? 
 And what about that man there ? 
 I see you have a coffee bar for a water cooler . The staff here must be comfortable . I think it really helps morale when people feel supported by their employers . 
 Hello , IBA Bank , how can I help you ? 
 You can withdraw money from your account either over the counter or via the ATM . 
 Actually , you only need to give 7 days notice if you wish to withdraw funds . Of course , you will lose some interest due to the withdrawal . 
 I want to have a continental breakfast . 
 Neither , can I have them scrambled ? 
 We need to figure out how much money we are spending and what we are spending it on ? 
 Well , I think we could be saving more . 
 Let's see . We spent 700 dollars for our home loan payment , 400 on groceries , 75 on utilities , 250 on gasoline , 100 on books and 300 on entertainment last month . 
 We put 500 into the savings account and 750 into our stock account . 
 Right . 
 What ’ s your flight number ? 
 Just for yourself ? 
 Hold on , please . Yes.you ’ re booked on ZN741 to Atlanta on July 18th . Your seats are in the first class section . 
 Toronto is really a lovely place to visit . 
 The Old Town , the Distillery Historic District , the Financial District and Underground City , everything is so attractive . 
 I ’ m worried about my daughter . She can ’ t decide about college . 
 I don ’ t mind that . But she disagrees with me about everything . 
 But I just want to give her some tips . 
 I guess you are right . 
 I hope so . 
 Yes . I'd like to try Chinese food . But I don't know anything about it . 
 Is there any difference between Cantonese food and Sichuan food ? 
 Really ? I like hot food . Can you make a few suggestions ? 
 OK . I ’ ll have them . Is there any soup ? 
 That ’ s fine . I'll have a try . 
 Martini , please . 
 What is your technical title ? 
 Why do you choose this field as your career ? 
 I ’ m so frustrated ! 
 I called the electronics shop to find out what time they close , and it took me twenty minutes to get what I wanted ! 
 yes.They have some sort of digital receptionist.So when I called in , a machine told me to push a button for the department I wanted to be transferred to . 
 I just kept pushing buttons . I was transferred to customer service , but there a machine told me to choose between technical help , warranty information , or price information . 
 Eventually I did get to a real person . I found out the closing time , but by then the store had already closed ! 
 I am very active and energetic . I approach things enthusiastically and I don't like leaving them half done . 
 I am quite outgoing , I think . I enjoy mixing and doing things with other people . 
 I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . A person can't live all by himself . A friend in need is a friend indeed . So the more really close friends I have , the happier I am . 
 Yes , I would call three of my former classmates really close friends . We often get together and talk with each other . Whenever I counter difficulties , they are always ready to give me a hand . 
 People who are honest , dedicated to their work and have integrity . 
 Slacker and those who violate working principles . 
 It's loaded ! For example , it's got a 256 color , LCD screen that rotates 360 degrees , and switches to black and white in power save mode . Also , it has a low-light mode for night shooting and touch screen menu controls that are really convenient . 
 Oh , it's the usual 5600x3200 resolution with 10.0 megapixels . It's got a 5xzoom , so from 28mm to 120mm the pictures look great ! I can change the resolution , too . 
 It has a built-in hard-wired memory , but I like to use the 64MB media cards that come with it . I can download everything onto the hard drive and then edit and enhance with different software . It takes fantastic pictures that I can either print out or E-mail to my friends . 
 Yes . I'm a transit passenger for this flight . Can you tell me where to go ? 
 Really ? I hope it hasn ’ t left without me . 
 Hi , Mary , you have been a secretary for several years in this company . Could you tell me what a secretary should do for a meeting or a conference ? 
 What should a secretary do to prepare for a meeting ? Can you tell me a bit more about it ? 
 I see , and how about the documents and the information ? 
 And what should a secretary do during the meeting ? 
 And after the meeting ? 
 It's seriously good . 
 This is my first tourism . I don't know what should be declared . 
 All right . Here you are . 
 Yes , I have got some special local product , I want to take them for my friends . 
 Four bottles . 
 What shall I do with my two more bottles ? 
 All right , thank you , see you .

 What would your colleagues say about you ? 
 Hello ? 
 Sorry , I think you have the wrong number . 
 Yes . Who are you looking for again ? 
 Oh , I thought you said Laura . Sorry about that . This is the right number , but Heather's not here right now . 
 She went to the store to buy some groceries . Would you like to leave a message ? 
 Hi Eric , this is her roommate Kathy . I met you a couple months ago at the Christmas party . 
 Good . Heather will be back in about 20 minutes . I'll tell her you called .

 Hi , are you Catherine ? 
 Thanks , good to meet you , too . 
 Yes , and the food was horrible ! 
 Great ! How will we be getting there ? 
 Hello . I want to purchase an old music box . 
 I was hoping I could find something made in the ' 20s . 
 I hope at least one of them has dancing figures . 
 So hard to choose . I think I'll take this one . 
 Does a warranty come with this music box ? 
 I just thought I would ask . 
 I can ’ t find my purse . Have you seen it ? 
 I ’ Ve looked everywhere for it . I must have left it somewhere . I hope I haven ’ t lost it . 
 No , I had it when I left school this afternoon . 
 Yes , I ’ d better give her a call now . 
 Perhaps I should call her later .

 I will give you the lowest price in the future . 
 Sorry . The car breaks down and it needs to be repaired . 
 My wife and I are thinking about taking our parents with us on a vacation . Do you have any suggestion about where to go ? 
 Sometimes what young people like is different from the old . Maybe we can go visit first and then do some shopping . 
 What should we bring besides a change of clothes , money and some snacks ? 
 Oh , yes ! I didn't think about that.Thank you for reminding me . How many days should we spend on a vacation ? 
 It seems that good planning for a family vacation is important to make sure everyone will be happy . 
 Owl ! I've twisted my ankle . I slipped on that greasy patch over there . I don't think it's broken but it really hurts . 
 Can I have this shoe in the black please ? 
 Okay . 
 Dad , you've been driving for three hours . Why don't we have a switch ? 
 Trust me . I've been driving for two years . 
 I would like to know is it a direct flight to Dubai ? 
 Too bad . I hate transferring during a flight . It is too complex . 
 Really ? It used to cost a few hours . 
 Ok . Good . I want two side by side tickets in the Economy cabinet . Thank you . 
 Yes , one last thing . How much holiday time do you give your employees every year ? 
 How about sick days ? 
 Any other benefits ? 
 Great . Thanks so much for your time . 
 What is your greatest strength ? 
 Why do you say that ? 
 Do you do a lot of your shopping online ? 
 No . I ’ m a little worried about security . You never who ’ s trying to find out your codes and passwords . Aren ’ t you worry about that ? 
 I ’ m surprised to hear you say that . I thought you loved anything technological . 
 So , how about coming to the department store with me ? I want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet . 
 Sure . While you ’ re in the computer store . I will visit the book store opposite . I like to browse through their books if they have anything interesting . 
 Thanks for reminding me . I had forgotten to get mine . 
 Hey , that's not fair . I did as much work as you . 
 Hey , Michael . Remember me ? I'm Becky . We used to work at Lemans together . 
 It's about the same . I've been thinking of making a change myself . Do you mind if I ask you a few things about your job at the university ? 
 Well , I was wondering what the salaries are like ? I mean ... are they much lower than the corporate world ? 
 Yeah , that's what I thought . But , I've heard that the perks are better . I was wondering if that was really true . 
 Oh , that's great . It sounds like you're really happy with your move . 
 Hi , my name is Tom . 
 Nice to meet you too.Melinda . 
 Really ? This is a nice office , but it's quite small . 
 It looks like you guys work hard . 
 Hmm ... Tell me more details about our jobs . 
 Shall we go to the library by subway ? 
 OK . There is no subway in my city . 
 Yes . Does it operate night and day ? 
 Where do we pay the fare ? 
 Do I have to pay an additional fare to change trains ? 
 OK , I see . 
 All right , Mr . Green . 
 Pretty well . Everyone is working hard . 
 You mean I'm among the people who have to go ? 
 Did I do something wrong ? 
 But you know I've been working very hard . And I have a family to support . 
 Could you check my list to see whether I have forgotten anything ? 
 I will open the suitcase and you read through the list . 
 Why ? 
 That makes sense . I will do it . 
 Good idea . 
 Don't go to too much trouble . 
 Let me see ... One or two bedrooms ? 
 Fine , sir . We can accommodate you . 
 No , sir . We don't allow dogs or cats . 
 Fine . See you on the 18th . 
 Yes . How would you like it ? 
 OK , here you are . 
 It's OK . 
 how long is it altogether ? 
 that sounds OK . So , we start here at the car park and walk along the path to the waterfall . 
 then we will follow this path down the hill to the old church . 
 this path leads to the cave . Can we look inside the cave ? 
 then we turn south and come back to the car park along this path . 
 how long do you think it will take us to complete the walk ? 
 that ’ s fine . Are there signposts along the way , in case we get lost ? 
 Hi , Jack ! How are you doing ? 
 Same old thing.What about a drink ? 
 Good day . How can we assist you ? 
 It certainly is . Do you have your contract and Import License ? 
 Thanks . What you need to do now is deposit 100 % of the guaranteed funds of your contract into your account with us . 
 That's great . We will have to charge you 250 RIB for that service , though . Could you please fill in this ? Thanks . 
 In three months or so ? 
 Did I ? Well . Anyway , you'll get your raise when the economy starts picking up . 
 Yes . 
 How do you do ? My name is Beef Hart . 
 Happy to see you . 
 Hi , Xavier . I'd like to go over the list of jobs for next week's maintenance shut . 
 Our production people won't be happy about that . We've got a full order book at the moment . Is there any way you could speed things up ? 
 Julia , what time is it ? 
 Oh , my God ! I'm going to be late ! I have no time to have breakfast now . ( Hurry on his clothes . ) 
 Oh , I have a poor memory now . I haven't had enough sleep lately . I had a bad dream just now . 
 Yes . I really need to have a good rest . 
 Do you have a reservation ? 
 Let me see if I can fit you in . What kind of room do you want ? 
 Smoking or non-smoking ? 
 You are in luck , we have one free . 
 That will be 600 RIB . Could I have your credit card please ? 
 A debit card will be fine . 
 Are you nuts ? It's the President of the United States in lingerie !

 The check in time is 2 p . m . If you get here before that time the room won't be ready . 
 We offer a complementary breakfast buffet and free parking .

 I ’ m afraid you ’ re going in the opposite direction . 
 I think a cab is better . 
 Thanks ! These are beautiful . You shouldn ’ t have ! 
 I forgot what I put up with in that case . I do deserve these flowers . 
 I helped my boss organize some grand ceremonies and maintained close relations with newspapers , magazines , the radio and the TV . 
 If I am not in the service center , I will assist others in resolving the consumer complaints . And pass the criticism on to the relevant department . 
 All right . 
 What would you suggest ? 
 I'd like the beef . 
 No , I'd rather have a glass of juice , please . What kinds do you have ? 
 I'll have a glass of lemonade . More ice , please . 
 Could you give me more paper napkins ? 
 Thanks . 
 Tell me a little bit about yourself , please .

 Hello . I have a room booked for tonight , the 15th . 
 It's Marcia Gleason . 
 Yes , a single , thanks . 
 Actually , I'd prefer not to be . 
 Spacious , bright and clean.And the walls were newly painted . 
 Not really . 
 It's great ! 
 Hello . I'm thinking about watching a Chinese traditional opera with a foreign girl . What's on this weekend ? 
 It's a good thing that I have choices here . Can you tell me about the one on Saturday ? 
 What about the performance itself ? 
 Wow , a story about the clever Monkey King . It's a classic and children's favorite . 
 Wonderful ! How much is the ticket ? 
 Two for the front . One last thing , are there any English subtitles for the show ? 
 Terrific . May I stop by to get that two tickets tomorrow afternoon ? 
 B . S-H-I-R-L-E-Y . 
 Good morning , Miss Monica . Nice to meet you again ! 
 After the internal discussion , we have all agreed that you are the most suitable person for this position among all the candidates . So , today let ’ s talk about your expected salary and social benefits . What is your expected salary ? 
 The basic salary for this position in our company would be 4800 Yuan to start with increases giving according to your performance . 
 40 hours a week , Monday to Friday , 9 AM to 5 PM with one hour lunch break every day .. 
 We do expect overtime work when it is necessary , but we pay twice of the work hour for working on weekends and three times for working on national holidays like Spring Festival and the Mid-Autumn Day . 
 No probation is involved . If you feel good , you can start next week . 
 I've come in to give you the documents under the L / C we opened , the new one . This lot are from Singapore , a new customer . 
 Yes , with a fine toothed comb , as usual . Everything seems fine , except for one thing . The description of the items we are purchasing is a little different from what we expected . 
 Not really , perhaps just a translation problem , that's all . Anyway , we've agreed to accept it . 
 That is very kind of you , Mr Lee . Thank you . 
 Of course . It ’ s a terrible night , isn ’ t it ? 
 Thank you . 
 Of course , Debbie . Let me look at my schedule , - - I have some free time on the 12th . That ’ s this Thursday at 9:00 a . m . 
 Certainly . I ’ Ve already worked out a general budget for all the departments . 
 It can ’ t be time to get up yet . 
 What ’ s the time ? 
 My watch says ten past . 
 Are you sure half past seven ? 
 ( And here is the seven o ’ clock news ) It ’ s only seven o ’ clock . Your watch is fast . 
 I could have stayed in bed for another half hour . 
 Yes , let me have this roast beef special . 
 I will have the green peas and make sure the beef is well done . 
 A cup of coffee , please , with cream and sugar . 
 Oh , yes . 
 What comes with the special ? 
 I think I will have a dish of Vanilla ice cream . 
 Waiter , may I have my check , please ? 
 Excuse me , driver , you have kept us waiting for 15 minutes . Can't we start the tour right now ? 
 Finally . How long does the tour last ? 
 You know Iden , I don ’ t know much about you . Where were you born ? 
 What was your childhood like ? 
 Do you get along with your parents now ? 
 Where did you go to university ? 
 What ’ s your current occupation ? 
 Did you always know you wanted to be a writer ? 
 How did you start writing ? 
 Are you writing a book now ? 
 Sounds interesting . 
 Ah , yes , that's right . 
 Hello , I was just looking for the guide . 
 Not bad . But I've made too many flights these days . I could hardly remember how many take-offs and landings I've been through these three days . I think we all feel a bit tired . 
 Wonderful . I'm eager to take a sauna as soon as possible . 
 I am sure we will . Actually , we are looking forward to seeing the great wonder . 
 Fine , let's go . 
 Why do you say that ? 
 Thank God , we haven't encountered a burglar . I hope that our house is secure against burglary . 
 Is the security door useful ? 
 I totally agree with you . In this way I won't be afraid of the burglar if you are away . 
 Ahahah ! What is that thing on your couch ! It just moved ! 
 You have a pet lizard ? Somehow I never would have imagined that . 
 Does it bite or scratch ? 
 Wow . He's heavy ! And his skin feels really cool . 
 You are going to work as my office secretary from next Monday . Right now I want to show you the rules of our company . 
 The working hours are from 9:00 to 11:30 in the morning and from 1:30 to 5:30 in the afternoon . Make sure never to be late or absent . Every time you should use the employee card to show you are present whenever you come into the company . 
 In my opinion , a secretary must be familiar with office routine and try to do some things by you . This is the filing cabinet and any document or file you may need . And you should file these documents in alphabetical order . 
 An outlet carries cheap cashmere sweaters . 
 I've always had good luck at outlets . 
 I hope you find a nice sweater . 
 I like the new shirt . 
 Oh , I prefer it loose 
 Yes , I'm rather good at driving . 
 Yes , but do you have your learner's permit ? 
 Have you ever driven a car before ? 
 Are you aware of all the controls in the car ? 
 When would you like me to start teaching you ? 
 Call me tomorrow , and we'll get started . 
 About 50 miles . 
 No , but we ’ Ve got a hurry . It will be the rush hour soon . 
 But it ’ s Friday today . This road is always jam packed during the weekend , isn ’ t it ? 
 I need some flowers for my wife because it is her birthday . 
 How much are the roses ? 
 That sounds like a good deal . 
 I'll take a dozen . 
 No , the roses will be fine . 
 Could you do me a favour ? Please give me some confidential information . 
 Well , what's the matter with you ? 
 Have you got a headache ? 
 Are you coughing much ? 
 Now , let me listen to your chest . Ah , you have a temperature . Breathe deeply . That's right . Well , don't worry , it's only a throat infection . There's nothing wrong with your lungs . And how is your appetite ? 
 Show me your tongue , please . All right , stay in bed and keep yourself warm . I'll prescribe some pills for you to take . 
 Yes . You'll be better in a few days , I'm sure . 
 Goodbye . 
 Can you recommend some popular tour ? 
 Two weeks and I would like to go abroad . 
 Yes , of course . I will book the tour . 
 Good morning . I'd like to have a haircut . 
 Please cut the sides shorter , but not so much at the back . 
 That's a good idea . But leave the front as it is now . 
 Very good , thanks . 
 No , thanks . 
 When would you like to fly ? 
 I will check , please hold on . Sorry to say that flight is all booked up . Can I book you for the 3rd of September ? 
 How many people are there in your party ? 
 What class will you fly ? First class ? Business class ? Or economy class ? 
 Round trip or one way trip ? 
 How will you pay , cash or charge ? 
 I am sorry , we do not accept checks . 
 Great . What name shall I put the reservation under ? 
 You are booked , Ms . Green . 
 It's a pleasure . 
 Yes , it is a queer drug , a tonic only available in China . Many ancient Chinese medicine journals have recorded that it can cure such ailments as night sweat , pain at loins and knees and anaemia . It has no side effect . 
 Yes , madam . Fill 3 or 5 pieces of Cordyceps into a cleaned and chopped open duck's head and cook with the whole duck . Or stew Cordyceps with chicken . 
 Please don't eat turnip and garlic when taking this medicine . 
 I'm looking for a necklace for my girl friend as a birthday present . 
 I like that one over there . Can you show it to me ? 
 Exactly . How much do you want for it ? 
 Is it made of pure gold ? 
 I'll take it . Please wrap it up for me and give me the receipt . 
 Thank you for your coming . 
 So long ! 
 Hello . This is Jones . I'd like to speak to Mr . Chen . 
 I'd like to discuss the new order with you . Would you like to have lunch together at Garden Hotel next Tuesday ? 
 That's a pity . Does Friday suit you ? 
 Is 12 o'clock convenient for you ? 
 Are you ready for your first driving lesson ? 
 The pedal on your left is the brake and the one on your right is the gas . 
 Automatics are very simple to drive . The first thing you should do is put your seat belt on . 
 Very funny . Next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror . Can you see out of them ? 
 How ’ s that ? 
 Check your petrol situation . 
 That ’ s a good idea . Put your keys in the ignition , start it up , put the car in reserve , wait for the road to be clear , and then back out of the driveway . 
 Remember , no honking this time . The horn is only for emergencies ! 
 Please file all the reports for me . 
 Yes . Will you also make copies and file them using both methods ? 
 Good . Can you please also list all the documents in those old files ? 
 Before next Friday . 
 What are your strengths and weaknesses ? 
 Why are you qualified for this position ? 
 What can you contribute to the position of a market analyst ? 
 What job-related skills do you have ? 
 Stand back from the door , please . There're plenty of seats in the rear . 
 One yuan fifty cents . Drop it in the box here . 
 Take a No . 2 . This is No . 12 . 
 Then this is the right bus . Move on , please . You're holding up the passengers . Tian'anmen Square is the last stop but one . 
 Are you familiar with American-styled accounting ? 
 What are the most fundamental concepts underlying the accounting process ? 
 Excuse me . Who is the person responsible for handling complaints here ? I would like to make a few complaints . 
 Here is the thing . I was woke up by strange noises of the telephone several times last night . Even I unplugged it , it wouldn't stop beeping . I am also not satisfied with the housekeeping service in my room . So I want to change to a cleaner and quieter room . 
 I'm glad we took the train . I don't like to ride in buses . 
 Even in Taiwan , I always liked to take the train . It is more comfortable . 
 Look at that village ! 
 Do you think I can take a picture through this window ? 
 Excuse me . I ’ m a stranger here and lost my way . 
 Sure . Can I get to the central department stall this way ? 
 Is it far ? 
 And do you know where the national bank is ? 
 Thanks very much . 
 Thank you . I won ’ t miss it . 
 I want a job in which I can use English , I would also like to be able to have some responsibility in my work . 
 Yes , I see . In my previous job , I did typing and filing everyday . 
 Well , not exactly , but I have shown some of my foreign friends around Beijing . 
 I think I would like that . 
 Oh , great ! Let's discuss it together . Now , when am I off then ? 
 What time exactly ? 
 Oh , am I seeing Mr . Li ? 
 I've got a schedule ! 
 in China at least , coffee is often associated with an exotic , well-to-do bourgeois lifestyle . Coffee is often considered a hobby of the well-educated , middle-class people . 
 yes . Behind a lifestyle , there is a culture . Young people easily become blind worshippers of a Westernized life . While they may not really life coffee , they think it desirable and enviable to be lavish 
 well . Tea represents another facet of popular culture . While a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft , elegant music , a teahouse is often a noisy , crowded , public space . People visit tea 
 well , that's true . In a sense , it is not so much what you drink that really counts , as where and how you drink . 
 How did I do ? 
 Really ? I thought I was doing well . 
 How are you , Mr Wilson ? I am Tina . 
 Please have a seat . I know our employment of forcer has already given you the information about your employee contract , but I'd like to go over the main details again before signing . First , you'll be getting a monthly salary , with one month paid vacation after one year of service . 
 You'll be covered by our medical plan while on duty.Since you'll be middle management , you're expected to be available up to 1.5 hours past normal working hours.Any approved time over that will be paid at time and a half , which you can take as salary or time off . 
 A reasonable number of sick days will be covered by the company.Any extended illness will be covered by insurance.Have you read the other terms of the contract ? 
 Do you have any other questions ? 
 Yes , it is , but you'll have to discuss the details with your manager . 
 Good.Now , if you'll just sign here , you can start work in 3 days . 
 Well , your insurance covers sufficient money to replace it . So you don ’ t need to worry . 
 Since you are not the one who caused the accident , your insurance cost should be the same . 
 If you got a smaller car , the cost should be a little less depending on the model , age , and size . Would you still want full coverage ? 
 I want to have this photo enlarged . 
 I want to have it the size of a page from an ordinary book . 
 One is OK . How much does it cost ? 
 Here's twenty yuan . 
 Is this your first time visiting Beijing ? 
 I think so . You can get anywhere by bus and taxi is not expensive . 
 It's also convenient , but it's usually crowded . 
 Good morning , sweetie . You finally got up . 
 Did you stay up late last night ? 
 Have you taken the written test yet ? 
 You should study before you take it . 
 Why don't you take the test ? 
 Since you already paid for your permit , you don't have to pay again . 
 No , the test skips a lot of things in the book . 
 No , I didn't , because it was pretty hard . 
 Peter , where are you going ? 
 Won't you watch TV ? 
 The TV station will air the World Cup football match alive at 8: 30 . 
 The Brazilian team versus the American team . Don't miss it . 
 Who do you think will win ? 
 I think so . 
 I'm interested in applying for a credit card with you . 
 Yes , I've had a Current Account with a debit card with you for years . Now , I'm looking at upgrading to a credit card . 
 When I opened the account with you , I was a student , I graduated a couple of years ago and have a steady salary , so I figured now would be the best time to go ahead . 
 As you can see from the statements for my Current Account , I have never been overdrawn . I'm always very careful about that . 
 Can you describe your health concern ? 
 Are you in pain ? 
 Would Tuesday or Wednesday be best for you ? 
 I will write you in for that day at 4 
 I will write you in on that doctor ’ s schedule . See you then . 
 Yes , I worked as a doctor at Beijing People's Hospital . 
 A little over 3 years . 
 I worked in the Infection Medicine Division . 
 Here ’ s an ad . about a big sale of washing machine . Do you want to see it ? 
 I think we should buy some souvenirs to take home . 
 Good idea . I noticed that on our way to the tower there are so many shops selling all kinds of souvenirs . 
 Excuse me ? 
 Well , I bought this skirt here yesterday afternoon . But I got the wrong size . It ’ s too small for my daughter . I wonder if I could refund it . 
 I intended to , but as far as I know , all the skirts of this kind here are of the same size . 
 Sorry to have given you trouble . 
 I think you made the right choice , coming to us.We have a wide selection of vehicles you can choose from . 
 All our cars have stereos in them.Stereos , air conditioning . It's all standard with us . 
 Oh , is that so ? Well , then . Let me show you something she might like . It's on our back lot . 
 Yes . Beautiful , isn't it ? 
 Well , sir . You said you were looking at cars at the rental agency at the airport.Now with them you'd spend your money and get nothing for it.But you could probably rent this Porsche from us , for the same price as one of their standard cars . 
 It's because our prices are so good.And this car has a lot of miles on it . But it's in nice shape , isn't it ? 
 What's going on with you ? 
 I'm having a party this Friday . 
 Is that right ? 
 Can you go ? 
 It starts at 8 o'clock . 
 I hope that I'll see you there . 
 You must like negotiating a lot . People are saying , you are a super negotiator . 
 I am not good at it by any means . Give me some advice . 
 Sounds easy . But how can I apply to practice ? I am thinking about applying for more reimbursement for my mobile bill . But I am afraid our boss will turn me down . 
 Thanks for coming to see me today . 
 I missed you too . 
 I've been really busy . 
 Working . 
 What have you been doing ? 
 Well regardless , I'm very happy that you came to see me . 
 How may I help you , miss ? 
 Would you like to have a perm ? 
 Oh , absolutely . 
 Hi ! Susan ! I haven ’ t seen you for ages ! 
 Oh , fine . Hey , why don ’ t we grab a bite to eat and do some catching up ? 
 Is there a sofa in the living room ? 
 That ’ s too bad . Is there a desk in the living room then ? 
 Where are the chairs ? 
 Good afternoon . Can I help you ? 
 Do you have a reservation ? 
 Wait a moment , please . Oh , yes , Steven Smith . It's for a single room with a bath . Is that right ? 
 Now , Mr . Smith , could you fill out this registration form , please ? 
 The restaurant is on the second floor . Here is the key to your room . It's on the 6th floor , room 609 . The elevator is over there . And we also have a cafeteria on the top floor , if you would like something to drink , you can also call room service . 
 Help me sort out my problem , will you ? 
 I know it ’ s so costly , but ... 
 Is it true that one of our competitors is planning to launch their tracking service next month ? 
 Or they'll take over the market before we even get started . 
 I guess we'd better get back to work . 
 It's me . What can I do for you ? 
 Are you Mr . Wu ? 
 Nice to meet you , too . Did you have any difficulty finding our company ? 
 What seems to be the problem ? 
 Let ’ s have a look . Mmmm . This doesn ’ t look too good . I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth . It ’ s pressing against your molars and that ’ s one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain . 
 First we will take some x-rays and see what we ’ re dealing with . I also noticed a small cavity up front here , so you are going to need a filling . 
 It could be that , or maybe you are eating too many sweets . In any case , I ’ ll administer an anesthetic and you won ’ t feel a thing ! 
 Yes . I'm looking for some perfume . Do you have perfumes with a light scent ? 
 It does smell good , How much is it ? 
 OK . I'll take this one . 
 what did you argue about ? 
 well , he should pay you back . It ’ s only fair . 
 did you lend him a lot of money ? 
 well , talk to him about it next time you see him . He probably feels as bad about it as you do . Close friends sometimes have disagreements . It ’ s nothing unusual . Neither of you said anything r 
 of course you should . You wouldn ’ t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ? 
 I need to make an appointment to see the doctor . 
 Good , but can you tell me how to get to your office ? 
 Very well . We have some fresh red roses . 
 $ 20 per dozen . 
 Yes , they're on sale today . 
 Splendid . Will there be anything else ? 
 I'm sure your wife will love them . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve get a small room . 
 35.00 dollars a week , but I don ’ t allow smoking . 
 Would you mind waiting ? I ’ m on the telephone . 
 I am sorry , miss , it's not allowed unless you want to buy it . 
 OK , here you are . The fitting room is behind the curtain . 
 Of course . Here you are . Can I take your order now ? 
 All right . Can I serve you anything else ? 
 You've got it , sir . 
 Four weeks . 
 I'm here on business . 
 I import canned food . 
 I have not given it much thought . Do you have any good suggestions ? 
 I have been there . It is in the middle of the mountains . It is not noisy there and you have to be a vegetarian . 
 Does it have enough lodging ? 
 There are many ancient pine trees there . It is especially quiet at night . It is wonderful to listen to the monks chanting while listening to the soothing sound of the winds in the pine trees . 
 Take some thick clothes with you . It is rather cold there at night . If you wear the T-shirt you're wearing now , you will become a ' popsicle ' . 
 If you like taking pictures , you may bring a camera with you . 
 Hello , Lincoln Bank . Kristy speaking , how may I help you today ? 
 I can deal with that , Sir . Are you interested in our personal or corporate card ? 
 I'm sorry , Sir , but you will need to come in to your local branch to deal with the application procedure . Come in and fill out an application form and let us have a duplicate of your ID card . You'll also need a copy of your guarantor's and he or she will need to sign the form , too . 
 You'll need to deposit 1,500 RIB initially . There will also be some small additional charges for this service . 
 It should all be sorted out within 5 working days after receipt of the required documents . 
 Sorry to bother you , but do you have change for a one ? 
 I need it for the parking meter . 
 You ’ re all set to leave . 
 What are your plans ? 
 What will your major be ? 
 You don ’ t have plans to end up back here , do you ? 
 You don ’ t belong here . 
 Good luck with your life . 
 A Westerner said to his Chinese friend . “ Chinese people slurp when drinking soup . It ’ s disgusting . ” The Chinese friend replied , “ Westerners make a lot of noise licking their fingers when eating . It ’ s even worse . ” 
 I attended a course on table manners while I was in the United States . Some of the things we learnt included how to place the napkin and utensils and how to pass the bread . Before each course , the teacher would ask if we wanted to learn the Continental European way or the American way . We always said “ American way . ” It ’ s amazing that everyone is so used to their own table manners . What is the Chinese way ? 
 Not really . I did some research about Chinese table manners . The important rule is to remain silent while eating . Of course , this refers to family meals only . Not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health . It is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party . The table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated . Each dish should be placed in the correct position . When fish is served , the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty . If it is in winter , the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter . Each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table . The diners should sit close to the table so food won ’ t drop on their cloths . No noise should be made when chewing . No one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn ’ t like it . One should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise . All these table manners are very similar to Western habits . 
 Yes . We say “ eat well and drink well . ” 
 No , thanks . I'm just looking . 
 No , madam . May I help you ? 
 No problem.Step in , please . 
 Actually , you can take advantage of our " New Millennium Woman " promotion . 
 Yes . If your " Love , Amy " purchases amount to 10,000 NT or more , you get a V . I . P . card and a 20 percent discount . 
 OK . Just think for a bit . I'll go help another customer . I'll be right back . 
 How do you do ? 
 Oh , no . It was easy . Your office sent me a map . 
 That ’ s OK . Thank you for seeing me . 
 Thank you . 
 OK . 
 Actually , it could have been better . 
 It is a new restaurant . I don't think they have their act together yet . 
 I felt that the food was pretty mediocre . 
 I agree . The service was not good . 
 No , I think that I've had enough of this restaurant . 
 I like the style but it is a little tight in the waist . 
 This one fits me well but it is too expensive , can you make it a little cheaper ? 
 Yes , I've watched the finale for the ' Super Girl ' . The producer is very smart to copy the program from the US , which is quite fresh and eye-catching for mainland audiences . 
 That ' s why the program has attracted so many star-wanna-bes . 
 Yeah , these programs are gradually losing their appeal . 
 And they lack originality . Talent shows like ' Super Girl ' and ' Super Boy ' are largely clones of ' The American Idol ' . 
 I think producers are underestimating the audience . They should think of better ways to entertain the general public . 
 I noticed there ’ s a jam a few blocks away . 
 I ’ m afraid I ’ ll be late . 
 Buy more and get more special discount coupons . 
 Of course You get a coupon for every 3 bags of sugar . 
 10 pence off if you use this coupon . 
 Yeah , you need to take advantage of it within its expiry date . 
 The coupon can be used at least one year . 
 All right . I will get them for you . 
 Here , Ma ’ am please get on the stretcher . 
 Calm down , sir . We ’ ll call her to make sure she ’ s on the way . 
 How long has she been in labor ? 
 O . K . Are you planning on being in the delivery room , sir ? 
 Please follow the nurse . She ’ ll get you ready . 
 Oh , yeah ! He can sit down , roll over , and even play dead . 
 Yup.Hey , do you want to see a picture ? See , he's eating lunch . 
 See , he's wagging his tail . 
 Good morning , miss . 
 How would you like it ? 
 Hello , what can I do for you ? 
 Don't worry . I will help you soon . Please fill in this form first . And write down your name , your account number and the amount in your card please . 
 OK . May I see your ID card ? ( B passed his ID card . ) Please wait for a moment . Let me go and check the account . ( A few minutes later . ) We have locked your card . You can come here to renew the account and get a new card a week later . Your money will not be lost . 
 Please pay 10 yuan , the handling charge . 
 See you ! 
 It ’ s very nice meeting you , too . 
 What would you like to ask me ? 
 I feel that people can love who they want . 
 Of course ! 
 I can ’ t help that . 
 I hope so . 
 I'd like to have a sightseeing tour in South Africa . Do you provide a package tour ? 
 What interesting places shall we visit ? 
 How many days shall we spend on the trip ? 
 Sounds good . 
 Certainly . What can I do for you ? 
 Do you know what size he wears ? 
 And what color would you like ? 
 Okay . Let's see . . . a size 36 dark brown leather belt . Oh , yes . Her e we are . Do you think your husband will like this one ? 
 Will this be cash or charge ? 
 No , I'm afraid not . We only accept our own store credit card . 
 What do you think about all the different diets that people go on ? 
 But what do you think about people who are obese ? What should they do to lose weight ? 
 So you think it's OK for people who are dieting to eat chocolate , don't you ? 
 How about drinking soda ? 
 And have you ever tried taking vitamins ? 
 How do you know so much about food and dieting ? 
 How are you making out these days ? 
 Hello , is that Miss Lan ? This is Nina with Huawei Corp . 
 I'd like to tell you that you could come to work with us . 
 I see . 
 Yes , I liked it the first moment I pulled up to it . 
 If you like the outside , you are going to really love the inside . 
 You ’ ll notice that the window treatments , carpeting , and drapes are all new . 
 Follow me into the kitchen . You will love it . 
 The best part is the bedroom and attached bathroom . 
 Let ’ s take a few pictures so that we can remember what we like about this home . 
 Yes , I'd like to withdraw some money . 
 OK . Here's my bank book , is that all right ? 
 In 50 Yuan or 100 Yuan would be fine . 
 Thanks . 
 Yes , we have insurance against old age , medical problems , unemployment , work injury and childbirth . 
 Insurance against old age , medical problems , unemployment will be paid by both the company and you , and the others by the company . 
 Well , you are behind in your rent ; it ’ s a 30 - day notice to vacate . 
 You have been late with your rent several times now . I am filing suit for back rent to protect myself . 
 This notice is to let you know that you will be evicted by a sheriff if you don ’ t make good on your rent . 
 You can stay if you catch up and stay caught up . Otherwise , I will find another renter . 
 Thank you . Please make sure that you pay with cash or a cashier ’ s check . 
 It runs every 15 minutes . You must have missed it . 
 Yes , I do . You can buy a bus schedule in a news stand . 
 Yes , it is . 
 No . The Museum is the terminal of this bus . 
 You are welcome . 
 Actually it was the most interesting day I ’ Ve had so far . 
 I did ! I found this lovely teapot . It was the best one I saw in the shops . 
 I took a taxi . It seemed the easiest thing to do . 
 I did actually but I think I met some of the friendliest people in China . They soon showed me the way ! 
 Yes ? 
 Certainly.Go along Queen's Road ... 
 Yes , and turn right at the Hilton Hotel . 
 Then go up Garden Road , past the Cathedral . 
 Yes.Then cross the road at the next traffic lights.The Peak Tram is straight ahead.You can't miss it . 
 Yes.Why ? 
 Do you want a taxi ? 
 Where to ? 
 Yes , I know it . 
 Yes , of course . Step in , please ! 
 Buckle up the belt , please . 
 Have you anything to declare ? 
 Where did you buy it ? 
 Do you travel a lot ? 
 Twice a year ? How long has your sister lived in Boston ? 
 I see , that's a long time.How much was the watch ? 
 Yes , I'd like to see the receipt . Oh ! I see you bought the watch last week . 
 Yes , I'm afraid you will.Altogether on the watch and the perfume you owe me seven pounds . 
 Yes , that's fine . I hope you enjoyed your stay in Boston ? 
 How about this floor lamp ? 
 We still need to find an armoire and a dresser . 
 Great ! Pick me up in about an hour because I think I ’ ll also get a bean bag and a dining set . 
 Recliner ? In my beautifully decorated living room ? I don ’ t think so ! 
 Fine , just get it ! We have been shopping for furniture for five hours ! I ’ m so tired ! 
 Fine ! I am going to go home and drop off this nightstand , coffee table and love seat while you look for the rest of the things . 
 While you are at it can you pick out a nice recliner ? I really want one so I can watch TV . 
 I've just visited your showroom . You surely get a lot of fancy bedsheets . I like them very much . 
 20 is very colorful and feels nice . I'd like to start with it . Is it pure silk ? 
 Thank you for saying that . But what's the unit price ? 
 The price seems acceptable . Can you supply the bedsheets now if we order some ? 
 That's fine . Then let's sign a contract . 
 Is there anything special they would like to do ? 
 That can easily be arranged . I will arrange a comfortable meeting room for them . Anything else ? 
 I will set it up . 
 Waiter ! May I see you for while ? 
 This is not what I asked for , I'm afraid . 
 Roast beef . 
 Roast beef , of course . That's what I ordered . 
 I would like to make a reservation for tomorrow . 
 Well , how about the 4th ? 
 Yes . Please help me reserve it . 
 I need the number for John Reese ’ s office . 
 Do you know which bus I can take to PCC ? 
 I live on Las Flores and Fair Oaks . 
 I'm okay with walking . 
 Do you know which direction it should be heading ? 
 Which stop do I get off on ? 
 Thank you for telling me . 
 Could you copy this document for me ? 
 A hundred and fifty . No , wait , make that a hundred and sixty . 
 No , thank you . That will be all for now . 
 I think I'm going to go get some food . 
 I can't decide what to get . 
 I think I might like some Chinese food . 
 I honestly don't know . 
 You like the food there ? 
 I think I'll go and get my food there . 
 May I speak to the apartment building manager , please ? 
 I was hoping that the apartment on Main Street was still available . 
 Yes , it would be nice to see the apartment . 
 Yes , I can be there at 6 . 
 I'm okay , thank you . I already checked out the address on MapQuest . 
 Is there anything that I need to bring with me ?

 Well , then I don't think this would be a good apartment for me . Thank you anyway . 
 morning . Macmillan and Emory . May I help you ? 
 No , I ’ m sorry . You ’ Ve reached Mr . Macmillan ’ s office . Let me just put you through to accounting . 
 But what if I don't win what I bid on ? 
 It seems that you can e-mail the seller and ask questions . 
 And people are honest ? 
 Good morning Mr Smith . My name is Susan and I am a reporter for the Evening Star . 
 I was hoping to talk to you today about your business . 
 How long have you been the owner of your computer shop ? 
 And how many staff do you employ ? 
 So this is a family business . 
 And how many computers do you sell each day ? 
 That about one hundred a month . 
 Thank you B for your time . 
 Do you like cooking ? 
 To be honest , I don't really like doing either one , I can't cook and I hate cleaning . 
 I would rather do the dishes than cook . 
 let's make a deal . 
 I'm going to buy some vegetable and you cook . 
 Fair enough ! 
 Good morning.Mr.Green.My name is Helen.What can I do for you ? 
 Yes.Are you interested in the job ? 
 Have you eve worked with tape recorders before ? 
 Good.There are many different kind of language labs , but ours is a small one.If you decide to take the job , I'll explain how to operate the system , Are you sure ? 
 Ten hours a week.From Monday to Friday , from 4 to 6 P . m . , and $ 150 a week . 
 Fine.Please fill out the application form . 
 Let's see . It says that you were charged Monday at 9:00 p . m . for the movie ' Titanic . ' 
 Okay , let me see what I can do for you . 
 I can take the $ 10 off your bill , but I need to charge you $ 2 for the service . 
 Unfortunately , sir , it's how the computer is programmed . 
 I'm sorry , sir . Perhaps you'd like to write a letter to headquarters . 
 We've been looking forward to your visit . It is a great pleasure for us to have you as our guest . It is always more convenient to discuss things face to face . 
 We've received some similar comments from other Australian firms too . 
 We appreciate your good intention and your effort in pushing the sale of our slippers . As you know , the demand for this item in your market is quite substantial . However , according to our records , the total amount of your order last year was moderate , which does not warrant an agency appointment . Unless you increase the turnover we can hardly appoint you our sole agent . 
 As far as I remember , we sold about 40,000 pairs last year to you alone . Don't you think this annual turnover is rather conserve - time for a sole agent ? 
 Let's put it this way . I propose a sole agency agreement for Ladies and gents plastic slippers ( excluding children's ) for a duration of 3 years ; 60,000 pairs to be sold in the first year , 70,000 pairs in the second year , and 80,000 pairs in the third year , the area is to be within the continent of Australia ( excluding any neighboring island ) , commission 5 % . 
 On the contrary , Mr . London , we value your friendship more than anything else . We both understand our slippers are very popular in your market on account of their superior quality and compete - time price . And with the sole agency in your hand , there will be no competition and you can easily control the market , which would naturally result in bigger sales . I'm sure you can fulfill the agreement without much difficulty . 
 Tomorrow afternoon . 
 Can you direct me to some fresh produce that's on sale ? 
 Mangoes ? What are mangoes ? 
 Can you eat the seed ? 
 Well , how much are they ? 
 Can you describe their taste ? 
 How can I tell if they're ripe ? 
 Where do they grow mangoes ? 
 I have a package to post today . 
 Well , it has a cassette record ... a cassette tape . 
 By airmail please . 
 Yes , I'd like to insure it for 20 dollars . How much shall I pay altogether ? 
 Would you like to see our new shirts ? 
 They are very nice , you know . 
 And not expensive either . 
 Everybody's buying them . 
 Yes , they are very fashionable , you see . 
 How much would it cost to send this special delivery to England ? 
 Yes . I'd like to send a $ 20 money order . 
 I need to go to the bank . 
 Closed ? Are you kidding ? What is it , some kind of holiday today ? 
 Oh , it's the first of April , April fool's day 
 So I have , but I has reminded me at least one thing I need to remember . 
 Tomorrow is my wife's birthday . 
 What reasons do westerners drink for ? 
 I know what you mean there . In many circumstances , people kiss the baby for the nurse's sake . And that's what we do when drinking at a banquet . Even though we do have a rich variety of brand-name wines , like Matai and Showing Yellow Rice Wine , alcohol is usually served not for the enjoyment itself . We just be its Dionysus effect to enliven the atmosphere , improve personal association with each other and solidify friendship . 
 Yeah . It's of supreme importance that the goblet , table-cloth , and plates should be made shiningly clean , so that the color of the wine is clearly visible and the delicate aroma and taste are fully appreciable . 
 This is a very beautiful statue . What's it called ? 
 100th anniversary ? When was that ? 
 Sounds real good . It's a pity that I missed that . 
 An interesting meeting , isn't it ? 
 Let me introduce myself , by the way , my name is Dick Brown . 
 Sorry , what was your last name again ? 
 OK . I'm Dick . 
 Excuse me , is there a Post Office around here ? 
 How do I get there from here ? 
 How far is that ? 
 Take me to this address , please . 
 How much do I owe you , sir ? 
 Are you kidding ? The meter says 15 dollars , doesn't it ? 
 I don't get it . I'll go and have that doorman talk to you then . 
 Carla , I know you ’ re kind of new in this business and I want to give you some advice . 
 You have to listen to what the client asks for . What you have just shown me is not at all in line with the client ’ s wishes . 
 Could you show me my bill ? 
 Can I have it charged to my account , please ? 
 The bonus season is coming . How much of a bonus can I expect ? 
 I hope so . I think you will get a big bonus too . Bonus depends on your performance and you worked overtime almost every day . 
 Hope so ! 
 To visit our supplier ? 
 Well , I guess you will meet many people in this field . So don ’ t forget to pack enough business cards in your suitcase . 
 By the way , do you know that our company just made some changes in the business trip policy ? 
 Ok , there is no cash advance anymore for short trips . You have to pay out of your own pocket , so save all the receipts from your business trip . And then attach them to your expense account . When you get back , our company will reimburse everything . 
 I am not sure . You can check with the finance department . 
 You ’ re welcome . Have a nice trip . 
 What ’ s to get ready ? 
 Nope . 
 Nope . 
 I'd like to have Chinese food . 
 Right here , please . 
 Oh , thank you . So nice you are . 
 I want a cup of bean milk . Do you have any ? 
 Thanks a lot . Oh , excuse me . Can I take two value meals ? And I want some chili paste . 
 Oh , sorry to bother you . I want to know what kind of meat it is . 
 That's OK . Thanks very much . 
 OK . 
 Yes . Do you have a pharmacy here , please ? 
 Which floor are we on now ? 
 And where's the elevator ? 
 How about going swimming ? 
 Why don't we go down to the pool ? It's not too far from here . 
 Do you take vitamin pills regularly ? 
 Yes . Maybe you should do it too . You may not get enough vitamins from your food , you know . 
 How's that . 
 Kim , have you made contact with Mr . Lee ? 
 What seems to be the problem ? 
 Maybe his phone is out of order . Anyway , keep working on it . I really need an answer about the contract I sent him . 
 How do I set up an E-mail account ? 
 Which link ? 
 Oh , no . What did I do ? It's asking me for a password . 
 Yes . 
 Oh , I see . 
 Do you get up early every morning ? 
 Good habit . How long does it take ? 
 No , my little sister lives with me . 
 About 12 . She is a good girl . 
 do you have a minute ? 
 I've made a tough decision , sir . Here's my resignation . 
 I'm afraid not , sir . I've made up my mind . It's something I have to do . 
 oh , no . not at all . 
 no , sir . 
 Oh , no . I would never look for another job while working here . I think this is a fantastic place to work . 
 it's my mother . She's sick and needs someone to take care of her . I'm the only one who can do it . 
 really ? I didn't know that would be possible . 
 thanks , sir . 
 Nice meeting you , too . 
 You can ask me questions , if you ’ d like . 
 Everyone should be able to love who they want . 
 I sure would . 
 That ’ s not my problem . 
 I ’ m glad to hear that . 
 You bet , Emily . Pull up a chair . 
 OK , let's start from the top of your pay stub . This number here represents your gross pay . 
 All right , I see . So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now . 
 Yeah , I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that . So there are two separate income taxes — one at a state level and one at a federal level ? 
 I see . All right , well I think everything else I can figure out on my own . The deductions for health insurance and my 401 ( K ) are pretty self-explanatory . Thanks for your help , Susan . 
 Yeah , I guess it's the same in the UK , I just never paid much attention . See you later ! 
 I'm here to see about a Fixed Asset Loan . 
 Yes , I am . But I'm not sure if I'm eligible . 
 For my credit worthiness ? 
 Hello sir , how can I help you ? 
 Let ’ s see . Okay , so 50 mg of Prozac , would you prefer this in capsule or tablet ? 
 Okay , you should take 1 capsule 3 times a day.Be sure not to take it on an empty stomach , and also , don ’ t ever mix it with alcohol ! 
 Okay , anything else I can get you ? 
 Sure . Darn condoms aren ’ t registered in our system . 
 Just hang on there a sec . Can I get a price check on Fun Times Ribbed Condoms please ! 
 We want to order 3,000 cases and hope to deliver the goods in two equal lots . 
 We'd like you to execute the first delivery by June 30 and the second delivery by August 15 . 
 I can agree to that . 
 Right . 
 Let's hope it's the beginning of a long and prosperous relationship . 
 Yes , you have to work overtime a lot due to the editing job . 
 No , but we ’ ll provide you with good businesses at the end of the year . 
 Where did you see it ? 
 You found an apartment in the ads ? 
 Tell me about the apartment . 
 How much is the rent for the apartment ? 
 That ’ s pretty cheap for out here . 
 Congratulations on the new apartment . 
 Yes , we do . That one comes in green blue and red . 
 Oh , that's 39 dollars and 95 cents . It's on the sale at the moment . 
 I'll just go and check for you . 
 Do you have stocks or a title deed of a house to pledge as security ? 
 We do not allow any request for a loan against personal security . This is a common regulation . But we may consider it if you can provide a reliable guarantor . 
 Good . He is a man of high standing . I think we can grant the loan you need after some further discussion . But I suggest you borrow on overdraft instead of on loan . 
 Sure . What kind of apartment are you looking for ? 
 OK . Would you like to live in a studio ? 
 Excuse me , but could I use your bathroom ? 
 Thanks . 
 What exactly is wrong with the plumbing ? 
 Are there any problems with the plumbing in the kitchen ? 
 How long have you had these problems ? 
 I will send someone out to take a look at the problem . Will you be home this afternoon ? 
 Fine . I will be there around two . If someone is not there , I will use my key to get in . 
 No , not yet . Is it good ? 
 Oh , she's good . She must be getting on a bit now . 
 So what's the movie about ? 
 Huh ? 
 I see . Batwoman married the boss ? 
 Wait a minute , I'm lost . The cop killed the boss ? 
 And Sharon Stone is Batwoman ? 
 Can I help you , Ma'am ? 
 Cool phone . What kind of phone card do you want ? 
 Then the M-Zone will be suitable . 
 You know students use tested message service . And they provide favorable service for that . 
 Oh , there is a sales promotion for it now . 
 If you buy a pre-paid phone card worth 100 yuan today , you will get 50 yuan for free . 
 Sure . As many as you want . 
 Operator . 
 You can call direct if you like . 
 Yes , please . 
 Yes , the code for Australia is 61 and then dial the city code and the number . Start with the international code which is 00 . 
 Between six in the evening and eight in the morning , sir . 
 Certainly . Tell me the room number and your name , please ? 
 OK , Mr . Ma . I'll tell the front desk clerk the charge afterwards . 
 You're welcome . Bye . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 Yes , of course , this one costs 260 yuan . 
 If you think it's expensive . You can look at this one . 
 It's difficult to explain . But this one is really cheap . 
 Can I see your passport , please ? 
 Yes it is . Residents can queen up in the lines to my right . 
 What's the expiration date on your passport ? 
 I see . Yes , you'll need to renew your passport in a few months . Make sure you don't let it expire while you are in the UK . 
 Do you have anything to declare ? 
 How long will you be staying in the UK ? 
 What is the purpose of your stay ? 
 Where will you be staying ? 
 How do you plan on paying for your living costs and tuition fees while you are here ? 
 Ok . Have a good stay . Here's your passport and documents back . 
 See ? That wasn't so bad . 
 It might be sore for a while . You'll be OK . Now let's go home and rest . 
 No , sweetie . I'll make you some tomato soup and rice . 
 And vegetables with porridge . 
 This is all your medicine . You need to take it four times a day for three days straight . 
 Let's get the table wares we need first , And then stand in the line . 
 Let's stand in the line now . 
 Me too . 
 Tell the waiter what you want when it's your turn . 
 I don't like them . I think they are too icky . 
 Certainly , Mr . Emory . Is there a problem , sir ? 
 Fine , Mr . Emory . Let me just grab a pad and pen . 
 Thanks for coming over to help . I really appreciate it . First , could you peel the vegetables ? I ’ Ve put them all in the skin and there ’ s a peeler . 
 After you ’ Ve chopped the vegetables , could you fry the meat in a little oil ? Just use a very small amount of oil . Fry the meat until it is cooked , then we ’ ll add some spices to flavor it . 
 These ones here . The one on the left is very spicy , so we must be careful about how much we add . 
 Cook it over a high flame , so that it will be ready quickly . Keep stirring the meat around the frying pan . Don ’ t let the meat stick to the bottom of the pan . 
 I ’ m mixing the sauce . It ’ s my specialty . I make it according to my own secret recipe ! 
 Don't worry about the cost . Our insurance policy covers us against situations like this . We need those parts urgently . Could you please try to get them here tomorrow ? 
 Yes , I'd like to know if there would be any future opportunities for specific training . 
 When will I know your decision ? 
 I can be reached at my office during work hours and at home in the evening . My office phone number and home phone number are in my resume . 
 Thank you , sir . I expect to hear from you as soon as possible . 
 All right . Goodbye . 
 I need to buy a new refrigerator today . 
 I like that Kenmore refrigerator . 
 Tell me about it . 
 What are the appliances ? 
 I'd like to see it for myself . 
 I like what I see . 
 Yes . I'd like to send this parcel to Changchun . 
 I guess I'll send it by airmail . 
 No , there are only some vases . 
 Have you got boxes for sale ? 
 Is it all right this time ? 
 OK . 
 Yes , I have . 
 Yes , it's definitely a growing business . 
 Mainly plastics . Plastics aren ’ t bio degradable - they don ’ t break down easily in the environment - so they shouldn't be thrown away . 
 Well , there are basically two methods . One is to break down the chemicals in the plastic into smaller chemical particles . These can then be used in the production of new chemicals . 
 No , we don't do that here . We recycle polyethylene and we make it into other products . 
 By melting it down and then reforming it . Our main products are bin liners for kitchen bins and carrier bags for supermarkets . 
 It is a significant document for traveling abroad and visiting . 
 There are passport processing center in many places . Visa is dealt with in embassies . You need to complete several forms and provide certain certificate . 
 Not too long . 14 working days for a visa . 
 Your passport and ID card . 
 Well , I've never heard of a little girl that didn't love Barbie dolls . 
 Here you go — Digital Barbie . 
 Barbie is our best seller . She's only $ 29.95 . 
 Your niece will love this . Anything else ? 
 With the tax , your total is $ 32.42 . Would you like to charge it ? 
 Thank you for shopping here . 
 Please take 2 tablets each time , 4 times a day . 
 Please put one under your tongue , do not swallow it . 
 Please dissolve one pill in water before taking it . 
 You're welcome . 
 No , I shouldn ’ t think so . But you must take your passport of course . 
 Yes , you need the traveler ’ s check but you needn ’ t get any foreign currency . You can have my US Dollars , I don ’ t need them . 
 You needn ’ t buy one . You can have mine . 
 Don ’ t be silly , John . I ’ m going with you . It ’ s necessary for me to have a holiday too . 
 I ’ Ve been busy with a first aid course that I started about a week ago at the Red Cross . 
 For sure ! I mean we ’ Ve learned how to apply pressure to stop bleeding , how to check for a pulse , and even how to apply CPR ! 
 Well , they took us along with some paramedics . There was this guy who fell off his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as well as a couple of compound fractures . His wounds were pretty serious so they had to rush him to the hospital . It was intense ! 
 Waiter ! 
 This is not what I asked for . I'm afraid . 
 Yes . What I ordered is roast beef , not roast beef sandwiches . 
 You have not fulfilled your lease agreement yet . 
 There ’ s a problem with that . 
 I won ’ t be able to give you back your deposit . 
 This was stated in our agreement . 
 I can ’ t do that . 
 That ’ s not my fault . 
 Well , let me have a look . Will you sit down in this chair and open your mouth wide ? 
 Yes . This big one is badly decayed . I'm afraid it must be taken out . 
 No need to worry . You won't feel anything at all . I'll give you an injection to stop the pain . Just wash your mouth out with this water , will you ? 
 No , it'll be over soon . Nurse , get some X-rays of our patient's molars . Then we'll start . Open your mouth wide . Don't be so nervous . Now open wider ... now stay , that's over ... 
 Not yet , but it soon will be . Now open again please ... It's out ! Look ! 
 Waiter , please bring me some toast . 
 Pardon ? 
 I see , bring me the whole wheat toast . 
 Milk , please . 
 We are thinking of a two days ' tour to Vienna . 
 It looks fine . Is this an inclusive tour ? 
 Is this taxi taken ? 
 Yes.Will you take me to the station ? 
 Thanks . 
 Well , I would say that I ’ m just drifting - - - here , in the pool . 
 Well , it ’ s very comfortable just to drift here . 
 No . 
 You got me . 
 Hello . Are you here to withdraw some money from your account at the Securities Company ? I'll need to see your Passbook for that account . 
 Thanks . OK ... your balance is 320,214 RIB . How much do you require today ? 
 Please fill in this transfer form and enter your password , here . Then the transaction should be completed . 
 I have lots of work to do . What ’ s more , my grandma is ill . 
 Where shall I register , please ? 
 Yes . Here you are . 
 OK . How much do I need to pay for the registration ? 
 Here is my money . 
 Yes , I will . But can you tell me how to get to the consulting room ? 
 What can I do for you ? 
 Is there a problem with your account ? 
 What about all your money in that account ? 
 That ’ s fine . 
 Would you like to make a withdrawal ? 
 I ’ ll just cancel your account right now . 
 Well , what is your trouble ? 
 Have you any aches and pains ? 
 I'll take your temperature . How long have you been feeling ill ? 
 You have a temperature , but it's nothing serious . It's probably just the flu . I'll give you a prescription . Take this to the chemist's . Take one tablet every four hours . You should stay in bed tomorrow , and drink plenty of lemon juice . 
 It's this cold weather we're having . 
 Yes . 
 So can I expect to hear from you to set up an appointment for an interview sometime next week ? 
 Thank you very much . Bye-bye . 
 Hey ! Are you getting dressed ? 
 Why ? What time is it ? 
 But it's Saturday ! ! 
 No , I'm not . I'm staying in bed . 
 If I'm awake . 
 This is the property manager . What seems to be the problem ? 
 Could you tell me what room had the leak ? 
 Could you please remind me which floor you are on ? 
 I will be sending the assistant manager to check it out . May we look at it this morning ? 
 If you aren ’ t there , we will use our master key to get in and check things out . 
 I just went to bed ! 
 I know , but that movie was just too good to leave . I guess I'll just have to pay the price and be sleepy . 
 No , Why don't we just grad a bite at the coffee shop next door ? 
 Do you know the circulation of this magazine ? 
 Oh , yes , how's it ? 
 Hi , I'm home ! Can you double that recipe ? I ran into an old friend after work and invited him for dinner . 
 I don't think so . Do you remember Bob Gain from Tulsa ? 
 He was on the diving team with me in high school and saved my life one day . 
 You're glad he saved me , huh ? 
 Hello . I'd like to speak to Susan . 
 Isn't this the Whites ? 
 I'm calling 6667777 . Maybe my finger slipped and I touched the wrong number . 
 Oh , sorry to have bothered you . 
 Bye ! 
 Have you checked your connection settings ? 
 Yes , there have been a few problems recently . Why don't you call the IT department ? 
 What's the weather going to be like ? I may want to go too . 
 Will it be good beach weather ? 
 It wouldn't be good if it got cold this weekend . 
 This California weather is so uncertain , it's impossible to know what'll happen . 
 I would love it if it wasn't always so unpredictable . 
 I know . Things are easier when you know what the weather's going to be like . 
 Hello , this is Miao Eng calling from Lincoln Bank . 
 No , not at all . I was just calling to tell you that everything has been checked and double checked , and there is no problem with the documents you brought in this morning . 
 Shall I go ahead and process them for you ? 
 Could you show me the way to the railway station ? 
 Would you like to be my guide ? 
 What characteristics should an interpreter own ? 
 Why is that ? 
 Well , Miss Liu , I've enjoyed talking with you . Thank you for your interest in this job . 
 We hope to make a decision in the next few days . We'll notify you of our decision by mail , is this convenient for you ? 
 Good luck to you , good-bye . 
 This facility is great , don't you think ? 
 I'm glad our booth is on the first floor . More people can see our display . 
 Let me see that . I didn't get one when I came in . 
 No . 
 Where do you go for lunch around here ? 
 Not too bad . But I will be soon . 
 I can't see Cortex on this floor plan . Don't they have a booth here ? 
 Oh , that will be uncomfortable for them . 
 Yes . Cortex just stole Darren McDowell from Rolly.And probably Darren will be here.So he will have to spend the whole show standing next to his old Cortex coworkers . 
 When you reserve a booth , you should check who your neighbors will be.Don ' t you think ? 
 Yes . Well , I think I'll go get lunch . Will you join me ? 
 Maybe . I will look around . 
 Welcome to ABC Company . We have been expecting you , please have a seat . I will call him . 
 Mr . Thomas will be here very soon . In the meantime , may I ask all of you to sign in so that I can issue your passes ? 
 Yes , please . Please print your name and company name , and the person you are going to see . 
 Good afternoon . I would like my hair done . 
 I'd like to try a new hair-style . Could you show me some pictures of hair styles ? 
 Thanks . Please give me the style in this picture here but make the wave longer . I would like hair spray , please . 
 Beautifully done . 
 No , thanks . How much should I pay ? 
 Here you are . 
 Excuse me . Have you got any books on genetic engineering ? I've looked for them everywhere , but I can't find any . 
 What a pity ! I should have come earlier . 
 Ok , I will . 
 No . I think I've known enough . Thank you . 
 Alright , see you . 
 You already finished off everything , sir ? 
 Would you like anything in particular ? 
 Beam and Perrier . Anything else , sir ? 
 Sure thing . Might there by anything else ? 
 Perrier , Jim Beam , apples , and grape juice . It will all be there shortly , sir . 
 Yes . In fact , the recommendation is a way of indirect self-recommendation . The university and the business have a long-term relationship . If you are recommended by your university , you can be approved more easily . 
 More and more people have the same discoveries since most of the universities do that in order to save effort . 
 Hello , may I make an appointment for sometime early this afternoon ? 
 Oh , what a pity . I'd like to see the doctor as soon as possible . I have a sharp pain in my chest . 
 Five thirty ? I have a dinner appointment at six . 
 No . I can't wait . I feel awful . The dinner appointment has to be canceled . 
 You are right . Did you say 5:30 ? I'll make a note of it . Fine . 
 How kind of you ! Good-bye . 
 I want to have a suit made to measure . 
 One Made in 100 % black Barathea wool , with 5 Celtic buttons . 
 I can ’ t find my purse . Have you seen it ? 
 I ’ Ve looked everywhere for it . I must have left it somewhere . I hope I haven ’ t lost it . 
 No , I had it when I left school this afternoon . 
 Yes , I ’ d better give her a call now . 
 Perhaps I should call her later . 
 Really ? What can I do ? 
 Umm , OK . Whatever you think will help . 
 Can you use the thinning shears on top , too ? My hair is really thick . 
 Hi , I'm back ! Hmm ... your hair is pretty damaged , and you've got split ends . 
 Well , the trim should fix the split ends , but you might need a deep conditioning treatment . 
 I'm also going to add some layers to frame your face . 
 No problem ! 
 Are you telling me you ’ re not going to meet with me ? 
 Well , I don ’ t like it , but I guess I don ’ t have any choice . 
 Very well , do you know any shorthand ? 
 Can you use the computer or other office machines ? 
 Yes , I see , this is a permanent position . 
 Oh , no , I ’ m student at a university , and I have to study most of the time . I can only work part time . 
 Is it true that rice is the staple food in most of Southeast Asia ? 
 Is rice your staple food , too ? 
 Waiter , please make out the bill . 
 Quite delicious , especially the pepper steak . 
 Here is the money . 
 Yes , do you know the nine to five timetable ? 
 Yes , you are right . 
 Bad . My nose keeps running . And my forehead is burning . 
 I will get better soon . 
 Yeah , I love that , no class , no homework , and no exams . 
 Haha , I just got the Ultraman costume . My Dad bought it . 
 Come on , I got numerous shots for that . You have no idea what I've been through with the needles . 
 May told you ? Oh , May , she's such a tattletale . 
 Tom , promise me to keep this a secret , will you ? 
 Deal . 
 It was okay . 
 No thanks , I'm not thirsty . 
 Not really . 
 Yes I did . 
 Yes . I'll be back at the same time as usual . 
 I see . Will you walk this way , please ? What experience have you had ? 
 Have you got any selling experience at all ? 
 Now tell me about your educational background . 
 What courses have you completed ? 
 What subjects did you like most at university ? 
 Why would you like to work with us ? 
 What are your future plans and what kind of expectations do you have of the company ? 
 Good . Do you know anything about this company ? 
 Have you got anything to ask me ? 
 Yes . 
 Three times a year at most . How do you feel about this ? 
 May I come in ? 
 This seems a pretty nice room , I should say . 
 What about the kitchen ? 
 I see . I'd like to live here for about three years . 
 Next Saturday at the earliest . 
 I'm just browsing , thanks . 
 Well , how about fifty percent discount ? If so , I'll buy that fur coat . 
 So won ’ t you come down any more ? 
 What kind of promotional events are scheduled for the new product line ? 
 What kind of sponsoring are we talking about ? I don't know how effective sponsorship really is ... 
 Other than the marathon , what else is on the list ? 
 Sports , medicine , education ... seems kind of random , don't you think ? 
 I'm checking out in about half an hour . 
 Great ! As you know however , the day in New York has hardly begun . 
 Therefore , I think I'll explore New York some more . But I need to store my bags . 
 My luggage isn't enough of a deposit ? 
 Well , then . Let me put on my thinking cap for a moment . 
 I'd like to buy some postcards of Beijing . 
 Looks nice . Okay , I'll take it . 
 I worked in a foreign representative office for one year . However , I leave there two years ago because the work they gave me was rather dull . I found another job that was more interesting . 
 I have learned a lot about business know-how and basic office skills . In addition , I learned at my previous jobs how to cooperate with my colleagues . 
 But it's still early . 
 But Day . I'm not sleepy . 
 I can't believe that . 
 I've never heard Mary cursed anybody . But I heard she cursed another driver when she drove me back home today . 
 The car behind ours suddenly accelerated and hit our Car . 
 You just don't get it . Looking for bargains can be really interesting . 
 Bargaining is a game , or even a battle . You feel like a winner when you get a good price . 
 That's true . But I just love it . Come here ! 
 You do have great taste . That's the most expensive stuff here . 
 Are you kidding me ? I bought a same one last week . It's surprising that there is something we both like . Well , what do you think of these ceramic cups ? 
 What about this picture ? I think Benjamin would like it . 
 Don't be so sure . He loves the vase I bought here last week . 
 Absolutely . That's why I can always get a good price . 
 Great idea ! I like authentic Chinese food .

 Hey , Tom , what to go for a run ? 
 I try to do that , but I can ’ t get up early enough . 
 It ’ s so hot at lunchtime ; I ’ d rather run in the morning . 
 I could try , but I can ’ t say for sure if I ’ ll get up in time . What time do you want to go ? 
 O . K . , maybe if I have someone to go with , I ’ ll be able to get up in time for a jog . 
 See you . 
 Sure , what is it ? 
 I'm sorry . I've been having some problems . 
 See you ! 
 Were you able to contact the owners about my counter-offer ? 
 I hope that they accepted the counter-offer . 
 Will the home inspection cost me a lot ? 
 Is it my choice as to who inspects this house ? 
 How long until you contact the sellers with my acceptance ? 
 Have you got anything to declare , madam ? 
 Have you got any wine or spirits ? 
 What about cigarettes or cigars ? 
 How many , madam ? 
 How do you understand the organizational structure of a company ? 
 Is it true that just like a human skeleton that defines their shapes , companies have structures that define theirs ? 
 Hello . Dr . Brown ’ s Dental Office . How can I help you ?

 What's wrong with the photocopier ? 
 I need to make six copies of this report for the Board Meeting tomorrow . Ring Office Supplies and ask if they have any in stock . If they can't deliver this afternoon , I'll go and collect it . 
 If I hear Love Me Tender one more time , I think I'll go crazy ! 
 Can we adjust the pitch a little ? Maybe he'll sound better in a higher key . 
 Hey ! Where are you going ... ? 
 Excuse me , can you tell me where central Park Street is ? 
 Is it far ? 
 I see . Thanks a lot . 
 When you were in school , what were your favorite subjects ? 
 Still , you must have had some subjects you enjoyed more than others . 
 That's too bad . We could really use someone who is bilingual . 
 Don't tell me that's your lunch ? 
 A candy bar for an appetizer and a piece of pie for lunch ! That's all junk ! 
 Sugar , sugar , preservatives , fats , more sugar , more fat , more preservatives ! 
 My wife sent me with rice , vegetables , and some curry chicken . 
 Good afternoon , Mrs.Vale . Please sit down . 
 Did you work as a salesperson before , Mrs.Vale ? 
 I see . Well , consulting is a little different . 
 Umm hmm . Do you have a diver's license ? 
 Fine . We provide a company car for our consultants . 
 Oh yes-five days a week . You have to visit customers all over the territory . 
 You'll have to attend a three-week course . If you do well , the job is yours . 
 Starting salary is $ 150 a week-plus commissions , of course . 
 Five percent . 
 Fine . The next course starts a week from tomorrow . 
 Good luck to you . 
 Thank you . I'm from America . Here is my business card . 
 Great ! This is my first visit to the Fair . Everything is new to me . Would you please give me some information ? 
 What about your company ? 
 My firm has high standing in my country . My bank is the City Bank , New York . You may refer to it for my status . 
 Yes , I would like to use the ATM to make a payment . But I need to pay 3 parties at once . 
 They are , yes . How should I do this ? 
 Yes , I've got that here ... 
 What kind of personality do you think you have ? 
 What makes you angry ? 
 Would you mind answering a few personal questions ? 
 OK . Does your present employer know that you are going to leave ? 
 Will she let you leave your present job ? 
 Why do you want to leave your present job ? 
 I appreciate you frankness . Do you know anything about our company ? 
 Gordon , you're ever so late . 
 But there's a bus every ten minutes , and you are over 1 hour late . 
 How on earth can you miss several buses ? 
 Oh , come on , Gordon , it's the afternoon now . Why were you late really ? 
 Have you got it now ? 
 When ? 
 I am not convinced by your explanation . 
 Hello , may I speak to Mr . Richard ? 
 Mr . Richard , this is Henry . I was interviewed by you last Tuesday . 
 I ’ m just calling to follow up on the situation of the salesman position . 
 Wonderful . Thank you very much . I have been dreaming to work with your company and I am finally granted the great opportunity . I won ’ t let you down and I hope you will contact me when you have any questions . 
 I am currently the highest bidder for your shirt . I was wondering about the size . 
 How is the condition ? How old is it ? 
 Why didn't you return the shirt or exchange it ? 
 What ’ s up ? 
 Yes , Do you mind if I have a look at your computer ? 
 Well , it has nothing to do with virus . The problem is your attachment is a bit larger . It has exceeded the e-mail capacity . 
 You can send a compressed one . 
 I'm OK . 
 Well , I can teach you how I make them , which is the same way my father and grandmother make them , which is a little special . 
 First you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl , and whisk them up , quite , so they're quite high and fluffy , and in a hot pan , and you need a pan that's that's kind of small , that the sides go up at an angle . You put some oil and heat it up , so it's quite hot , and then you take your whipped up eggs , or whisked up eggs , and pour them into the pan , and as it's cooking , if you take a spatula , and push the bottom layer of the egg , to the side , to the sides , and then to the middle , so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan . 
 OK . And keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over , you'll only have to cook that side lightly . Put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese . 
 Excuse me , can you tell me how I can get to the snowboarding area ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Excuse me , but could you tell me the way to the railway station ? 
 How long will it take me to get there ? 
 That's very clear . I think I can find my way now.Thank you . 
 I would like to have a new suit made . something in a dark blue wool . 
 I think I would like the pants pleated . I am not sure about the jacket though as I'm a little overweight . 
 Yes , that is why I usually choose dark colours for my business suits . 
 Certainly . 
 What kinds of meat are most popular in your country ? 
 Yes , we do . we also eat mutton . 
 That's right , mutton chops taste so good , we eat them with sauce , have you ever tried ? 
 Certainly I can , I'll buy some from butchers ' and cook for you next sunday . 
 That was a very interesting presentation , Ms . Wang . My colleagues and I are very impressed with your proposal . 
 To show our appreciation for your hard work , we'd like to invite you to have dinner with us . 
 Excellent . Have you had French food before ? 
 We need someone rather quickly , the sooner the better . 
 Well , of course depends somewhat on experience , background and that sort of thing . What are your currently earning ? 
 I see . Including bonus ? 
 What starting salary would you expect here ? 
 What is included in a job advertisement ? 
 What are the accesses of the job ads ? 
 IBA , how can I help ? 
 That was a wise decision , if I may say so . Our Personal Internet Banking Service offers online shopping transactions , payment of household bills online , account management ... 
 This will fix all of that for you . If you use our online payment service , the money will come straight out of your account and go directly into the seller's account , in a secure way . 
 I would like to look at some watch . 
 Pure gold ones , please . 
 What is the price for this one ? 
 That's quite steep . Can you come down a little bit ? 
 It's rather more than I was thinking of paying . 
 OK . I'll take it . 
 I would love the help ! Would you prefer helping with the writing part or is programming more your thing ? 
 Perfect ! You'll be working alone on that portion . Do you like to work alone ? 
 Our first meeting is next Monday . Could you meet with us at that time ? 
 Please send me your background information before the meeting so I can look at it . 
 OK . I look forward to working with you . Enjoy your week ! 
 What a large building . Can we visit by ourselves ? 
 Thank you . When and where shall we meet ? 
 I see . 
 Okay . Come with me . 
 Sorry , you can only pay cash . 
 Here's your change . 
 Of course , I'll get right on it . 
 I'm wondering if anyone has turned in a train ticket . I just lost my ticket for Beijing tonight . 
 Yes . If I don ' t make it to Beijing tomorrow morning . my wife would kill me . How much does it cost ? 
 Fine . 
 Where is my wallet ? Someone has stolen my wallet ! 
 Yes . I needed a large one . Before , I had a separate refrigerator and freezer , but this has both combined into one . 
 Yes . You know I ’ Ve been cooking more kind of food recently and I needed some extra space for spices and ingredients . 
 No , I didn ’ t . I gave them a really good clean , so they just look new . The worktop was in poor condition , so I had a new one added . 
 Yes , I have . I need them to help me with these new dished I ’ m trying to make . I need a little more practice before I invite guests over . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve always likes Indian and thai food , so I ’ Ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . I ’ m pretty good at making curries now , but I still need practice at making thai food . 
 I hope you can stay for dinner . I need a guinea pig ! 
 What time do you want the call ? 
 We can certainly do that . Expect a call from us at 7 o'colock and then again at 7 fifteen . 
 I can certainly do that . Is there anything else ? 
 Okay . Good night , sir . 
 Maybe I should go home . 
 Are you sure ? 
 Sounds like a good idea . 
 Thanks for reminding me . 
 All the fruit are pretty fresh here . 
 They're four yuan per kilo . 
 Yes , we do . They are eight yuan per kilo . 
 Take much and you can have them six yuan per kilo . 
 OK . It's 22 yuan 
 Excuse me , but are you Mr . Smith from Britain ? 
 I'm from Textile Import and Export Corporation . I've come to meet you . My name is Zhang Yong . 
 How do you do , Mr . Smith ? Let me help you with your luggage . 
 Did you have a good trip ? 
 Anyhow , it's a long way to China , isn't it ? And I think you must be very tired . 
 I wish you a pleasant stay here . 
 Now , Mr . Smith , if all is ready , we'd better start for the hotel . 
 This way , please . Our car is waiting over there . 
 How sweet ... if you make me some more toast , I'll let you use my new retro toaster ... 
 Isn't the shape cool ? 
 Hey ! What's that smell ? Are you burning the toast ? 
 Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me ! 
 Hey , listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in.You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out.And anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes.All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me . 
 Sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed . And I'm lucky to be alive too . 
 Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried . 
 Alright . 
 Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital . 
 Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time . 
 Yes , maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ? 
 I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ? 
 Do you carrying fresh fish ? 
 I already looked , but did not see anything . 
 Thanks . 
 Oh , gosh . I didn't see it . 
 Excuse me , sir . Didn't you see the red light ? 
 No , sir . The sign says no turn on red . 
 I'm sorry , sir , but may I see your driver's licence and insurance policy , please ? I have to give you a ticket . 
 Sign here , please . You can appeal to the court within 14 days . This slip has all the information you need . Please drive safely , sir . 
 Are you going out again ? 
 You mustn't go to bed very late . Can you be home before nine . 
 No . I won't let you ride a bicycle late at night . 
 OK . Here's the key . Take care . 
 When would you like me to send those plans over to your office , Mr . Montgomery ? 
 That shouldn't be a problem . What is the exact address , again ? 
 Next , please . Where to , sir ? 
 How many did you say , sir ? 
 That will be six dollars . Out of ten-seven , eight , nine , ten . Thank you . 
 Good . And because this is our initial order , and your products is so new , we would like to make a deal with you . 
 We want to make this a trial order . If we can sell all the products in two months , we will pay for them ; if not , we will send them back to you . 
 We promise that if the products are sold out in two months , we will place a repeat order right away , at the same quality . 
 I like the Honda Accord you showed me before . I think it's more practical for my needs . 
 What does it come with standard ? 
 Cruise control ? I don't like that . 
 I think it's dangerous . What if I can't turn it off ? 
 I wish it didn't have cruise control . My wife doesn't like it either . 
 I suppose . And What about the sunroof ? Is that standard ? 
 I see . 
 Yes , I ’ d like to activate my voice mail service please . 
 Sure that sounds great ! Are there any other fees ? 
 Perfect . I also wanted to know if there is any call forwarding service ? I am usually out of town and would like my calls to be forwarded to a local number . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Yes , we can arrange that . 
 Our travel agency provides all kinds of tours , ranging from individual tour to group package tour . 
 When do you expect to come ? 
 What specific places do you wish to visit ? 
 OK . 
 I never thought about that , but you're right . What do you think we should do ? 
 I was thinking about taking tennis lessons . I always have an hour to spare in the afternoon . What do you think about that ? 
 I heard it is only about one hundred twenty dollars a month for 8 lessons . 
 Passport , please ! 
 Are you Chinese ? 
 Where in China are you from ? 
 There are a lot of people from China visiting right now . 
 How long do you plan to stay ? 
 All right . Here's your passport . Welcome to Australia . 
 Hello , jewelry department . How may I help you ? 
 He's probably a pervert . Just ignore him . 
 Maybe he wants to get something for his girlfriend , but he's embarrassed . 
 No , I'll have the fish please . 
 No , I want the fish . 
 Thank you , but I prefer the fish 
 No , I like the fish . 
 Hi , Boss ! I'd like to tell you what we've discussed during the day . 
 I think it's going very well , actually . We had a long meeting with them . After several lengthy discussions they decided to accept our offer . 
 We're meeting with their finance director today and then with the other directors tomorrow , just to sort out some final details . 
 OK . I never forget it . 
 If I were a manager , I would have a private talk with this employ to figure out the reasons . It is very important to have this one-to-one discussion in an unthreatening situation without any distraction . 
 Well , I guess the employee would feel more embarrassed and probably angry . Anyway , it is not wise at all to give a harsh time to your employee in front of others , especially strangers . 
 What's the life expectancy in your country ? 
 About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It's a problem that will soon affect most of the world . 
 Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday . 
 How's your son these days ? 
 He'll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you think it is a good age to have a child ? 
 Yes , I think you're right . I'm thinking about having a child , but not just yet . 
 Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life.Parents usually try to discour 
 It's almost impossible to get the right balance . If you are too strict , kids might ignore you . If you are too lenient , they might go wild . 
 Good evening . Is the kitchen open now ? 
 It ’ s ok , good night . 
 My doctor said that I need a chest X-ray . 
 What should I do after that ? 
 Am I standing the right way ? 
 Am I doing this the right way ? 
 Are you going to leave ? 
 Is that all there is to it ? 
 I really like the way this house looks . 
 The landscaping is wonderful ! 
 Oh , I see what you mean ! 
 I love the sage green carpeting with the sunset-colored walls . 
 Oh , look at that beautiful countertop material and the double sink ! 
 I really like the Jacuzzi bathtub in the bathroom . 
 You don't look well at all . Are you sick ? 
 How long have you been feeling like this ? 
 How did you feel at the very beginning ? 
 I see . You've caught a bad cold . I'll give you a prescription . 
 Hey , daughter , let me ask you something . 
 Do you have life insurance ? 
 You have children now . What if something , God forbid , happens to you ? 
 A $ 100,000 policy shouldn ’ t be too expensive . Here , call my agent . He ’ ll give you a good deal . 
 Really ? Why ? 
 I'm surprised . He does't look like a guy who'd ever cheat on his wife , does he ? 
 Well , I'm really surprised . You are not doing anything behind my back , are you ? 
 Haha ... You are not very funny . I guess that means - - except me to tell my lover we have stoped seeing each other too . 
 Fred , is it a good time to talk with you ? 
 As you know , I have accepted three new programs in our company this year , but I am not sure I can do my work well . And right now my dilemma is that I can not find a person whom I can trust for these three programs . 
 We are not willing to miss the chance ; however , our staff is not big enough now . So , to be honest , I want you to help me to finish all these programs . 
 I am aware you have been working so hard . Before hiring more employees , you are still needed to do this . 
 What's wrong ? 
 Have you checked the fuse box ? 
 There might be a loose connection somewhere that's making the safety switch trip . Check the settings on the trip-switch . If you can't fix it yourself , call in an electrician . 
 OK , it's my pleasure . How many tickets ? 
 But I am only half a person as you and they charge both of us the same price tickets . 
 Dad , it makes no sense . 
 Yeah , I make certain . A half-price ticket cuts us one point five Yuan . 
 There is so much information and I advise to read newspaper . 
 Yes , of course . If you like the room , call the landlord and confirm the information of the room . 
 Hello , is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Single or double ? 
 Would you like to have your room on the top floor ? 
 I've been at this for two weeks now and nothing ’ s turned up . 
 What do you mean ? 
 You ’ re right , I don ’ t want to pay , but I don ’ t want to live without pay , either . 
 Do you have anyone in mind ? 
 Who ? 
 Ya , they do . Anyone else come to mind ? 
 Please pull your vehicle over to the side of the road . Please roll down your window . 
 Have you been drinking ? 
 Really ? But I can smell alcohol on your breath . Blow into this breathalyzer , please . 
 If you refuse to blow , you'll receive a much severer punishment . 
 Your BAC exceeds the legal limit . 
 I'll have to write you a ticket and suspend your driver's license for 3 months . 
 He's a member of the National Basketball Association . 
 Some people say he's from New York . 
 Yes , I'd like to get some gas . 
 Unleaded . My car is new . 
 Fill it up . I will have a tour tomorrow . 
 Yes , please . 
 Give me a quart of light oil . 
 The portions here are man sized . We usually end up taking half of the meal home with us . 
 Hey , sis . You know me , if I don't like everything on the menu , I don't go back to the restaurant ! 
 Wait , you love salmon , don't you ? They have the best salmon pasta . 
 Soup and bread and salad bar ! I'm telling you , these people know how to keep you coming back ! 
 Look , there is traffic accident over there . 
 The old man is knocked down by the bicycle . 
 Well , I remember walking pass the baker shop . 
 I'm afraid so . I don't remember you telling me about it . 
 What would you let me do now ? 
 Really ? You are so kind . 
 No . That's not enough . I've got some cereal . 
 Just a minute . 
 By subway . 
 Yes . There ’ s one on the other side of the building . 
 I ’ m afraid you can ’ t . you ’ Ve to go out there and walk around . 
 Hello . Green Trading Company . What can I do for you ? 
 Yes . It'll be at three o'clock this afternoon . 
 Didn't we make that appointment a long time ago ? 
 How about Friday afternoon ? 
 One thing I love our boss for is that he always knows when to give you a pay raise without being asked for . 
 He just knows either by your excellent performance at work or by the annual review . 
 Actually not ! Our company pays for performance . 
 You look hot and tired . Jack , have you been exercising ? 
 Who won ? 
 What was the score ? 
 My God ! Why did you bring me here ? I hate the taste of coffee . 
 Tom , you promised to cut the lung . You won't forget , will you ? 
 And you'll repair the television , won't you ? 
 Do you promise ? 
 And Tom , you will help Johnny with his homework , won't you ? 
 But you'll promise not to be late for dinner tonight , won't you ? 
 Tom , darling . You'll try not to be late for dinner tonight , won't you ? Please ! 
 May I help you ? 
 What size do you wear ? These dresses are on sale . 
 Come this way . Here's the dressing room . 
 It looks nice . And it's not expensive . 
 It's only $ 20 . 
 Would you like to copy the EX files and pass me the copy ? There are some figures I want to check . 
 Yes , I also need all the letters we received from them . 
 Yes , that ’ s right . 
 Yes , but I need the report copied on transparency paper . 
 This is Milton in room 402 . I would like to check out . Can anyone help me with my baggage ? 
 Thanks a lot . By the way , please call a taxi for me . 
 What is your favorite kind of music ? 
 What genres ? 
 What interests you in that type of music ? 
 That is a perfect reason to like a certain kind of music . 
 You want to go get a facial with me today ? 
 Not at all , guys also get facials , manicures and pedicures . There is nothing wrong with looking after your skin and looking good . 
 Well , first they exfoliate my face , getting rid of all the dead skin . Then I get a face mask with nutrients that keep my skin healthy and young . Afterwards , they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a million bucks . 
 Well you should come with me one day , I'm sure you'll love it . 
 How much is this ? 
 The large one . 
 Is this the only kind you have ? 
 Oh , yes . I think I'll look at those over there before I decide . 
 Can you help me find a nice gift for my young niece ? 
 You're right . Girls love Barbie . Show me a Barbie doll . 
 She's beautiful . What's the price for Digital Barbie ? 
 Only $ 29.95 ? I'll buy it , of course . 
 Thank you , but no . This will do it for now . 
 Cash , please . 
 Hello , I have a reservation for a double . 
 It's Smith . Here is my driver's license . 
 I'd like to put it on my VISA . 
 Great , is our room ready yet ? 
 Mom , I'm ready for school . 
 I know , mom . 
 Oh , my jump rope . Mom , can you get it for me ? 
 For sure ! I didn ’ t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the US . 
 Well , they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401K ? 
 That ’ s interesting and logical I guess . In my country , we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund , but most people don ’ t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that . 
 Yeah , but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions , so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank . 
 Can you book me a double room for February 22 ? 
 I guess so . 
 Excellent . How many would you like ? 
 You need to fill out this form , please . 
 That will be no problem , sir . 
 Very good , sir . Your order will be ready in one week . 
 No problem , sir . But it will cost you extra . 
 I've never really thought about it before . I guess it doesn't bother me . 
 I guess so . I usually buy name-brand clothing , shoes , and electronic goods . How about you ? 
 I would like to get some meat today . 
 I need about a pound of ground beef . 
 That sounds good . 
 I also need three pounds of chicken breasts . 
 How much will the three pounds of chicken cost altogether ? 
 That will be all for me . 
 What salary are you expecting ? 
 It can be anywhere between 100,000 to 200,000 a year depending on experience and qualifications . 
 I need to order new business cards . 
 I think 2,000 would be enough . 
 I don't want to make any changes to my old card . 
 ... Okay , that's it . Here's the form , and here's my old card to use as a model . 
 I need it sooner . Let me have it in three days , okay ? 
 To start with , may I know why you are interested in working for our company ? 
 Now you are with Quandong Company . What is your chief responsibility there ? 
 Do you have any questions about the job ? 
 Certainly . This is an international company , and ther're good chances for you to work overseas . 
 Good evening , sir . Are you Mr . Jim Stewart from the States ? 
 Glad to meet you . Mr Stewart . I'm the guide from Pacific Tour Agency . My name is Zhang Hua . 
 I'm always at your service , sir . By the way , did you have a pleasant trip ? 
 Well , shall we go to the hotel right now ? I've already made a reservation for you . 
 So we must get you to the hotel as soon as possible . I hope to see you refreshed and revitalized tomorrow morning , as we are going to visit the Great Wall . 
 Hi there , Mr Brown . Are you depositing or withdrawing today ? 
 I understand . So , what would you like to do with the balance ? 
 215,000 RIB is the exact balance . If you could just sign your name here . 
 pardon me . Could you please pass me the tissue ? 
 thanks , I didn't expect the dish to be so spicy . Are you ok ? 
 well , not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Cuizhou provinces can . Back where I come from , people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies . 
 yeah , you can increase you tolerance for spicy food , but so far , I haven't had the need or the opportunity . Every time I try spicy food , it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes . 
 yeah , I guess that's a typical example of when in Rome , do as the Romans do . 
 OK , Lucy.It ' s your turn.Are you ready ? 
 Come on ! In the two hours we've been here , you haven't sung even one song ! 
 Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis ' song for him . 
 Ping-pong must be the top-ranking popular sport in China . It seems to me in every school , factory , army unit , or residential area , men and women , young and old , are swinging paddles . 
 What do you think might be the source of its popularity ? 
 And sometimes a substitute table can be made out of a few desks . 
 Haha , these are very good inventions . All these speak the public's fondness for the sport 
 I know President Hu Into likes playing ping-pong . 
 I see . There was also the famous ping pong diplomacy , wasn't there ? 
 Great . Where is it ? 
 What about the surrounding area ? 
 That's good . Is the location easily accessible ? 
 Hmm ... well , maybe we can buy this one then . 
 By credit card . 
 Do you take American Express ? 
 Ok , I'll use my Visa . Here you are . 
 There are so many record players here . That is hard to choose . 
 I'd rather get one with separated speakers . They give a clear sound . 
 That's right . Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony . 
 The system keeps crashing when I try to access the personnel database . 
 It's Chinese New Year ! That means it's time to eat hot pot ! 
 You mean half-and-half ? 
 Good idea . 
 Excuse me , can I use your computer to type my paper ? 
 I am afraid I can't finish typing it this afternoon . When will you use it tonight ? 
 Thanks a lot ! 
 It's on the arm rest . 
 You can suck a candy or pinch your nose gently while breathing out . That shall help . 
 I beg your pardon . 
 Oh , I see , since I'm a heavy smoker . May I change my seat ? 
 Oh , did you ? Thanks a lot . 
 Yes , Sir , the specialty of our restaurant is the seafood . 
 Perhaps you would like some sole . Many guests like it very much . 
 Any drinks ? 
 You should have been at home and enjoyed a big meal .

 Excuse me . Does this bus go to the National Library of China ? 
 How long is the ride ? 
 Thank you . Would you please let me know when we get to the stop ? I'm a stranger here . 
 Sir , I want to ask for a leave for five days . Here is the request form . 
 Yes , I need to go home to have a family reunion .

 What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ? 
 What kind of people do you like to work with ? 
 Well , Mr . Brown , we've settled everything in connection with this transaction except the question of payment in yen . Now can you explain to me how to make payment in yen ? 
 I know some of them are doing that . But this is new to me . I've never made payment in yen before . It is convenient to make payment in pound sterling , but I may have some difficulty in making payment in yen . 
 Do you mean to say that I can open a letter of credit in yen with a bank in London or Bonn ? 
 I see . 
 I'd like to buy a ticket for New York . 
 Round trip . 
 When does the next plane leave ? 
 I'd like a ticket for that flight please .

 OK . 
 Room service , what can I do for you ? 
 There is a laundry form as well as a bag in your room . Pls fill it out and the maid will come pick it up . 
 To press the suit only takes 3 hours . The laundry will be returned to you tomorrow around noon time . Is that all right ? 
 Right away , sir . 
 Hello , Tina . An acquaintance of mine has just told me that your bank has started a new Personal Wealth Management Service . Is that right ? 
 How would I go about applying for this service ? 
 That's so simple . I'll come by my local branch later this afternoon and get it set up . Thank you very much , Tina . 
 Reservation , please . 
 5 , and please put us as close as possible to the stage . 
 At 8 o'clock . 
 Working conditions are very relaxed . You may work whatever hours you want , provided you get your job done properly . 
 Would you mind changing the position or working place you've applied for ? 
 How was your appraisal with the boss ? 
 Yes , I think he ’ s the most relaxed person in management . 
 That ’ s good . Maybe you ’ ll get promoted . 
 Welcome . How can I help you ? 
 All right . We have quite a selection for you to choose from . There are double rooms with twin beds , suites , if you'd like , we have presidential suite on the top floor . 
 All right sir . How many nights will you be staying ? 
 OK . I'll just need to see a credit card and passport . 
 What is the rate for a double room for one night ? 
 What about the features in the room ? 
 Does the TV have cable ? 
 Oh , what a relief ! Thank you very much for your help , Miss . 
 Excuse me , Miss.My friend is sick . 
 Yes.Please give him some water . 
 And do you have any medicine for airsickness ? 
 I appreciate your help . 
 Hi , this is Monica . I was wondering when we can work on this financial report . 
 Shall I see you on Friday morning ? 
 We must find some time to read report . 
 That ’ s all right . Then see you on Friday afternoon . 
 Where do you want to go ? 
 I'm sorry , but you got on the wrong bus . 
 You should change to the No . 701 bus at the next stop . 
 Not at all . 
 No problem . 
 Oh , Never mind , I finished my paper.So you can use it tonight . 
 I don ’ t know what activity my son should take part in ? 
 But each children has his own interest . 
 OK . Everything is in the bag . 
 Hello . Can I speak to Alice , please ? 
 Thank you . 
 Would you tell her Tom Gray called ? 
 Good afternoon , how can I help you ? 
 I am sorry to hear about that . Would you mind coming with me to my office and tell me exactly what happened here ? 
 Are you sure that it isn't somewhere in your room ? 
 Ok , when and where did you last see it ? 
 Are you sure you didn't wear it this morning ? 
 Did you remember to lock your door before you left then ? 
 Well , I understand how you feel , and we will try to do our best to help you . But first please allow me to send one of the housemaids to your room to look for it again thoroughly , just in case it's still in there . If she finds it , we will all be happy . If she doesn't , we will turn the whole matter to the police . But I must say that the hotel can't be held responsible for your loss . You should have locked your gold necklace away at the hotel ’ s safety box . If you had read your key card carefully , you would have realized that we specially warned you to do so . 
 I am sorry , ma ’ am . Our general manager is not in town . But I ’ d be more than glad to get you our assistant manager , if you like . But I am afraid that he will say the same thing . We have very clear instructions about valuables and we must follow them . And now if you will excuse me , I'll go and find our assistant manager for you . 
 I can ’ t believe that Obama won . 
 I know ! He just made history ! 
 I did . Did you ? 
 I am so happy that he is our new President ! 
 I hope that he brings change to America . 
 I have faith in our new President . 
 Why not ? It's the very reason why I've applied for this job . It's really exciting for me to experience business in an international environment . 
 They don't mind . 
 What time is check-in ? 
 OK . 
 Thank you . 
 Certainly , sir . 
 I'm sorry , sir . What seems to be the trouble ? 
 I'll just go and check it for you , sir .

 Good morning , I am here for my interview . 
 No problem . 
 Unfortunately , our company is shutting down due to the economy . 
 I am probably best at researching for marketing purposes . 
 I tend to get bored easily and so love to keep myself challenged . 
 When can I move into my new house ? 
 Will the utilities be turned on ? 
 I really want to paint the walls right away and get the carpet cleaned .

 Can you help me on my move-in day ? 
 When you told your mom you would be home around 2 am , She must have a cow ! 
 My accounts go where I go . Vince knows that . 
 It's business , Dave . 
 Right . The faint of heart should not apply . 
 So do I . 
 Well , they consider some distinct but related problems , such as seeking for a target market or locating the promising customer . An exporter needs to know about the social characteristics of people he is dealing with . 
 Ok . You need to know what they like or dislike , what religions they follow . Especially you need to know how they behave , their habits and their way of life , the things that they are used to . Sometimes , people in different countries , have varying outlooks for cultural , political , religious . 
 Steve , thanks for looking after Johnny .

 How can we protect our patents and trade market abroad ? 
 As you know , our main focus is to penetrate the markets of countries in Asia . What is the current legal framework in the countries ? 
 Several years ago , the countries and China singed memorandums of understanding , pursuant to which the countries will improve their laws government intellectual property rights protection over the following two to three years . 
 I'm sorry I scratched your car . 
 How are you , Mr . Zhang ? 
 Fine , too , thanks . We met one year ago . We both took part in a party held by our company last year . 
 Me too . How is your family ? 
 Say ' hello ' to them for me . 
 I'd like to invite you for dinner tonight . Do you think you'll have time ? 
 Which kind of food do you like to eat , Chinese food , western food or seafood ? 
 OK . I will pick you up at your hotel at 5:30 p . m . 
 See you later . 
 I feel absolutely horrible . My temperature is 41 degrees Celsius , and I've got a headache and a runny nose . 
 I've also got a terrible stomach-ache . Is my face still swollen ? 
 Yes , for the most part . It doesn't feel as bad as my other ailments , anyway . 
 No , the burn ointment seemed to take effect right away . I think it's already healed . 
 I scalded on the hot coffee a few days ago . 
 No , but I'm sure I'll get better soon . 
 I took the red ones just before lunch and the white ones just after lunch . 
 Just some water , please . Do you have any ointment for my nose ? It feels so itchy after blowing my nose so much . 
 that sounds good . 
 Is everything alright ? 
 What took so long ? I thought your flight was supposed to arrive 3 hours ago ! 
 I didn't hear anything about a delay . I thought everything was running on time . What happened ? 
 Then what ? Your plane was three hours late ! 
 Turbulence is pretty normal , isn't it ? 
 So where did you land ? 
 That sounds like a nightmare ! 
 Have you had anything to eat ? 
 I had a few coffees while I was waiting . Let's get out of here ! 
 No , sir . 
 Good-bye , sir 
 What about ? 
 Is there a problem ? 
 In three years your lease will be up . 
 If you do , I will keep your deductible . 
 I would keep it because you would be breaking our contract . 
 I hope that I cleared things up for you . 
 An all-day pass is 30 dollars for adults and 20 for children . 
 That'll be 60 dollars . 
 Here you are . Seventy-five cents , please . 
 Is there anything valuable in it ? 
 Shall I make out a receipt ? 
 That will be ninety-five cents in all . 
 Go ahead . Waste your money . 
 Well , I don't ... anymore . 
 I didn't say I was going to deprive myself . 
 Oh , hi , Leo . Sure , what ’ s up ? 
 I ’ m not in there very often . It ’ s so noisy that I can ’ t work . 
 Has anybody spoken to him about it ? 
 We can ’ t really ask him to stop having students come in for help , can we ? 
 How about recommending him to use the storage room down the hall ? 
 With the cabinets taken out , it might be bigger than it looks . 
 Let ’ s rock n ’ roll . 
 Yes , could you please put me in the non-smoking section ? 
 Yes , if any one is available . But not over the wing . 
 It doesn't matter , I will take an aisle seat . 
 Do you mean the contract for equipment rental or the one for training ? 
 Yes and no . Let me see if I can clarify that . The terms are the same except that the contract for training has a clause that allows for the cancellation after the first six months . 
 Sure . What I mean is that either side could cancel the training contract after the six months as long as it's in writing . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 I've got a telegraphic order . Will you cash it ? 
 Yes . Here is my passport . 
 US dollars , please . 
 500 in twenty dollar bills and the rest in a dollar bills . 
 Please count .

 Could you please help me put my bags in the truck ? 
 Take me to Hilton Hotel . 
 Will you sit down , Mr . White ? 
 I propose a toast to your pleasant tour in China . 
 This food is a Wax specialty . Please help yourself . 
 Jim . How are you ? I haven ’ t seen you for a while . 
 Where were you ? 
 Tell me what ’ s the matter with you , Bill . 
 Come on . Let ’ s talk heart to heart . I think we can find a solution . 
 You are going to have a huge bill . 
 Don't you wanna get it fixed now ? 
 Well , if you need anything , just let me know . 
 You sure have bad luck these days . 
 Yes . Where would you like to go ? 
 Of course . 
 Well . That depends on traffic , you know . It's pretty heavy this afternoon . 
 I'll try . Where exactly is your friend waiting ? 
 You've got it . 
 Here we are , Central Park ! 
 Well , it's $ 12 . 
 Thank you . 
 I think it's my ankle . 
 One of my snowshoes got caught on a rock . 
 I don't think so.It ' s kind of sore . 
 Is that really necessary ? 
 About the same . 
 Should we be here , Alice ? I don't think it's that serious . 
 I hope not.It isn't that busy . 
 Is there any difference ? 
 I think I would like the former one . 
 Cartons . Is that okay ? 
 Well , what I can tell you is this . We've got an excellent record on making deliveries to our customers . Besides , all our cartons are lined with shockproof cardboards and are wrapped up with polyethylene sheets . So they're not only shockproof but also dampproof . 
 Well , I guess you can say that . The safety of packing is something we always pay a lot of attention to . Especially for those fragile commodities , we've got to be extra careful . Otherwise , if the things we don't want to see happened , we would be responsible and that'll cause you a lot of inconvenience , too . 
 We sure can if you want us to , but the charge will be much higher . 
 Sure , no problem . As I said , cartons are good enough for goods like this . You don't have to worry about it . 
 Hello . Is my laundry ready ? My room number is 210 . 
 Can you take the stain off ? 
 That's right . Can I get it back in the afternoon ? I really need them tonight . 
 OK . By the way , please get them pressed . 
 Good evening.can I help you ? 
 Sure . 
 You don't have to . This is your knob menu.Just tick off the items you want for breakfast . write down the time and hang it outside the door before you go to bed tonight . 
 Excuse me . I wonder if you could help me . I'm looking for the Oriental Pearl Theater . 
 Oh ! What bad luck ! How can I get to the Theater ? 
 This bus goes all the way to Santa Anita mall , right ? 
 Are you positive ? 
 How long is this bus ride ? 
 Where do we get off at ? 
 There's a stop right next to the mall ? 
 That's cool . 
 Want to meet for lunch this Saturday ? 
 What are you doing ? 
 What kind of volunteer work ? 
 Oh , yeah ? 
 Housekeeping . May I help you ? 
 I can check for you . Could you describe the coat ? 
 When was the last time you saw it ? 
 OK . I ’ ll check the lost and found and with the bar manager . We'll do our best to find it . 
 Good morning . Can I help you ? 
 Sure we do . First-class or economy ?

 Personally , I would consider making one more offer , but it is up to you to decide what to do .

 I mean he's a student developing all round . 
 We offer various types of transportation . Perhaps you'd like to upgrade to a private vehicle ? 
 In that case , how about a limo ? Then you can travel in style . 
 Got it , sir . Where would you like the taxi to take you ? 
 What time do you want to leave the hotel ? 
 I'll call the taxi immediately , sir . 
 A brand new taxi is pulling up now .

 I need to fight this ticket that I got . 
 Yes , he is , Your Honor . 
 I was told by the officer that I ran a red light . That information isn't true . 
 I'm not sure , but the signal had a camera on it . 
 No , my picture wasn't taken . 
 Thank you very much , Your Honor . 
 I am very happy to know my work could be recognized by you and our company . 
 I really appreciate it . Thank you . 
 Don't worry about it . Just leave it to the insurance companies . 
 Yeah , more and more cars . People should try to take public transportation . 
 Yeah , sometimes I really feel like writing a letter to the mayor . 
 Have you taken this to the property management , yet ? 
 Where ? On the road ? 
 Is the car owner a lady with deafening voice ? 
 That's my wife ! 
 Of course . 
 I have a plan for handling WebTracker . Step one is the Stars.com contract . 
 Don't worry about that , Dave . Look , I have to see Vince now . Think about what I said . 
 Huh ? 
 Okay , mom . 
 It will be hard at first , but I think I can do it . 
 I will do my best . 
 Wow ! It's hot today ! Do you want to get an ice cream cone ? 
 What's that ? 
 Do they have ice cream bars . frozen yogurt or frozen chocolate mousse ? 
 Maybe a vanilla ice cream milkshake would be good . What's your favorite flavor ? 
 God ! Even talking about it makes me feel like l'm gaining weight ! 
 What do you consider to be your strong points ? 
 Why do you say that ? 
 Really ? Are you still playing ? 
 I see . You must be tough . 
 What do you consider to be your weak points ? 
 What kind of people are you reluctant to work with ? 
 Do you prefer to work alone or as part of a team ? 
 What would be my daily duties ? 
 Got it . To whom should I report ? 
 Excuse me.In this museum , you are not supposed to take pictures . 
 Will you give me your camera ? We have to confiscate your film . 
 We keep it and return it later . 
 You can buy them at a souvenir shop near the exit . 
 Yes.But Mary is no match for Susan in painting . 
 Hi , darling ! I have a one-month vacation saved up . How about a trip to Europe ? 
 Oh , but I really need to leave this town for a change . Working day after day has worn me out . Do you have any other suggestions ?

 No problem . I'm really looking forward to the coming week . 
 What a surprise we've met here ! 
 I've been in China.Where were you ? 
 What do you do if you find something that isn't on your list ? 
 Can anyone tell me where I can buy the ingredients to make Chinese food ? 
 That is good of you . 
 I'm after things to stuff dumplings with , like Chinese cabbage 
 Pork . Where's the meat counter ? 
 Hi , Brad . How are you today ? 
 No problem . Is this the only one ? 
 Can I help you ? 
 What size , please ? 
 What color would you prefer ? 
 Well , the brown one is beautiful indeed , but I think the black one will suit you better . 
 Will there be anything else ? 
 Yes , it is . It's brilliant . 
 Yes , it is . But you have to be careful . 
 Only 350 yuan . 
 OK . Here you are . 
 I am a little bit shy and I blush every time I speak in public . I think I should open myself more and be more outward with people . 
 I am self-indulgent sometimes . 
 Yeah ? What does he want ? 
 I haven ’ t got two minutes at the moment . Can ’ t you go over things without me ? 
 Let's see ... You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China . They should be able to place your order before the end of next week . It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo . The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean , and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today . Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles . 
 No , the Chinese company has that all worked out . With the paperwork you receive with the shipment , you should be good to go . 
 Non-tariff barrier is another mean to restrict imports . 
 For example , some countries restrict imports by quantitative restriction . 
 This is used to protect local industries or to achieve certain political objectives . 
 Technical barriers are set for imported goods . 
 Yes , some countries may use some of the unnecessary health rules to exclude foreign food . 
 This is the interview class . Welcome to our class . 
 We are all learning things that will help us in our interview . What do you think are some important considerations going into your interview ?

 What time is the most convenient for you to change rooms , sir ? 
 What time will you be back ? 
 We could move your luggage while you are out , but could you take any valuables with you ? You may pick up your new room key No . 216 from the Front Desk when you return . 
 Thank you very much , sir . 
 I have a really bad toothache ! My cheek is swollen and I can ’ t eat anything . 
 When you pull my tooth will you also have to extract the nerve and the root ? 
 I guess that ’ s what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day . 
 Excuse me , waiter . I have just dropped the spoon onto the ground . Would you please bring me another one ? 
 Thank you . We'd like to have some dessert . 
 Yes , madam , can I help you ? 
 We have the medicine for that . I'll go and get it for you .

 Then the north line is the right track for you to take . 
 Do you think we can get to the airport by 8 
 Is it the rush hour now ? 
 Mmm ... it is delicious . 
 Yes . It's superb . 
 In fact , could I ask you for the recipe ?

 Wait a minute . I didn't catch you there . Could you repeat that ? 
 Now , I've got it . Thank you . 
 Well I had several tests and an oral presentation this week so I didn ’ t get a chance to memorize the second page , but I think I mastered the tricky section . 
 Charles ? Before I start I was wondering if it was ok if I put a small crescendo in here and then decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here ? 
 It was horrible ! I played play it much better at home ! 
 Is that better ? 
 Sorry ! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make . 
 Those are the headlines for today , and now for the international weather report with Mike Sanderson . 
 Moving to to Latin American , Ecuador has suffered a six month drought that has not only affected farming , but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides electricity for the entire country . In Chile , a major earthquake that registered seven point five on the Richter scale struck the southern region . Losses are reported to be in the billions . Authorities have not yet released an official statement . 
 I ’ m afraid not , Bob . One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted , causing major floods and landslides in the region . Meanwhile , Mexico ’ s coast has been hit by hurricane Liliana and officials say that all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami may hit Central America , affecting Honduras , Guatemala and Panama . That ’ s all the news we have for today , but stay tuned for updates on the six o ’ clock news . Back to you Bob . 
 Yes , I would , as long as it's good quality . 
 OK . 
 Yes , are you ? 
 You don ’ t know what day the elections are ? 
 They ’ re this coming Tuesday . 
 Yes , I ’ m serious . 
 I can ’ t believe you didn ’ t know when the elections were . 
 You should watch the news more often . 
 What are you going to buy ? 
 I'm probably going to buy something too . 
 I want some sort of candy . 
 I want some chocolate . 
 I'm going to get a Snickers or a Kit Kat . 
 I'll just get a Snickers then . 
 You ’ re crazy ! You haven ’ t been here long enough . 
 What makes you say that ? 
 I disagree with you . They don ’ t all wear the same clothes ; they ’ re definitely not all blond ; they don ’ t all own Parker fountain pens ; they don ’ t all drink Coca Cola , and they don ’ t all chew gum . I do think they all drive cars though ! But that doesn ’ t have anything to do with how they look ! 
 Dan , Dan , dude . You have to come over to my house right now ! 
 Just get over here ! Come in ! Quickly ! 
 What do you mean ? 
 Security , Dan , security ! You can never be too safe you know ! A lot of sickos out there . Just the other day they caught that peeping tom red handed ! Had a high power telescope and binoculars by his window . 
 Paranoid ? I ’ m not paranoid ! I ’ m cautious ! You see Dan , we have to be on guard at all time ! People just invade your privacy as if they knew you ! Telemarketers , solicitors , even your bank ! They have way too much information ! I like to keep everything on a need to know basis . 
 You are being watched ! Be careful Dan ! Be careful ! 
 Get used to it , Mary . I'm off hamburgers for good health . Most fast food is loaded with sodium . 
 My doctor says I should cut back on sodium-rich foods to lower my blood pressure . 
 Actually , my blood pressure isn't that high yet , but they say it increases with age . 
 I want to lower my risk of heart attack and stroke , too . 
 I've noticed you've been munching away on lots of fruits and vegetables recently . 
 I have had some really horrible headaches lately . 
 I get headaches occasionally , but they have been really bad lately . 
 I am getting ready to take my GRE . 
 It has been hard for me to sleep with a bad headache . 
 I hit my head on a cupboard door a week ago . 
 Excuse me . Do you know where I can find the nearest ICCC ? 
 Do I need to take a bus ? 
 How do I get there on foot ? 
 Wait , let me write this down ... Alright , I'm ready . 
 Square ... turn right ... traffic lights ... And then ? 
 Tall building ... Which side is the building on ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 This is the Pan-American Club . May I help you ? 
 Yes , of course . The guest speaker is Professor David of a University , and he'll be lecturing about The impact of the Oil Crisis on Latin America . 
 Daddy , I want to buy a ten-speed-sportsman . 
 No , I'm not asking for money , I'm asking for your advice . 
 Wake up , Mary . 
 We're all going to church . Do you want to come ? 
 Are you sure ? 
 Okay , then . We'll be back around noon . 
 We have received your resume in answer to our ads . I would like to talk with you regarding your qualification for this position , OK ? 
 What is your greatest weakness ? 
 What is the greatest disappointment in your life ? 
 Well done ! Another question ! When will you start work , if you are hired ? 
 May I be of any assistance ? 
 You can have a broad choice here . Are you interested in a particular brand ? 
 Ma'am , these are complimentary with each purchase . How about that one below the toys ? This is the best seller . They are of the latest model that can be found in town . 
 Yes , we do . What a great taste you have ! But we only have one left in stock . 
 You know a good product will always sell ! Would you mind waiting for a while , we'll get it right away . 
 Here it is . It's very elegant , I think you will like it . 
 Its durability will be a big surprise to you . 
 500 yuan . And if you buy it today , there will be a 15 % discount for you . 
 Yes , sir . It's the specialty of our restaurant . 
 OK , sir . Don't you want to have some drinks ? 
 Can you help me find a pan ? 
 I want a big pan . 
 Yes , it's the right size , but it weighs too much . 
 It's light enough , but the handle will get too hot after cooking . 
 Oh , my family's going to love this one . I'll take it . 
 Sure . Wait , wait . Does a lid come with this pan ? 
 You're looking very well . 
 Do you often exercise ? 
 What style of swimming do you like best ? 
 I think butterfly stroke is the most difficult style to learn . 
 Oh , no . I am quite a stone in the water and cannot swim . 
 Yes , I made a reservation for 3 days for April 3rd to 6th , and my name is Sara . 
 Well , I want to extend it for 2 more nights . 
 Yes . 
 Thank you . 
 Let me see . Would it be all right on Wednesday morning ? 
 Then I will see you in my office at ten Wednesday morning . 
 It should go to Altadena . 
 I'm not completely sure if it really does . 
 I'm almost positive that this is the right one . 
 We have been riding this bus for a long time . 
 I think it says Temple City . 
 I'm sorry . But at least we know which bus to catch to get back where we started . 
 Hi , can I assist you in any way ? 
 Oh , I see . In what area ? 
 Yes , we have this service . Have you got a deposit certificate and your passport ? I'm sorry to ask you , but your passport is very important . 
 Yes , I'm afraid there is . 
 What's that supposed to mean — that it's weak ? 
 Mmm ! Beer , tequila , and ... lime ! 
 Fresh tomatoes , green and white onions ... 
 What's your working day like ? 
 Do you get paid overtime ? 
 Do you have any breaks ? 
 My boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . I suppose your job involves a lot of paperwork , doesn't it ? 
 Yes , I do . I don't like it very much . 
 My minibar is completely empty . 
 Everything's gone . 
 Just bring me three bottles each of Jim Beam and Perrier . 
 The fruit basket was great . I need a few more apples , please . 
 Yes , one last thing 
 Jacob , are you interested in helping me out and going on a blind date with a friend of mine ? 
 Well , she's got a beautiful face and long curly red hair . 
 She's fairly tall , maybe 2 inches taller than me . 
 Not at all . She's actually very athletic . 
 No , but she does wear contact lenses . 
 She's got a gorgeous complexion with a few freckles on her nose . 
 I think she has her ears pierced and she definitely has a few tattoos 
 It's a butterfly - everyone in her family has one . 
 Yes , even her mom . 
 She's a lot like me . 
 Look , I've got a problem here . Will you help me ? 
 Hello , Mr Lawson . It's a pleasure to see you again . You seem to be in here all the time at the moment ! What can I do for you today ? 
 You're right , no problems . You are becoming quite the expert , Mr Lawson . If any problem does turn up , which I'm sure it won't , I'll give you a call . 
 Hello , there . You are looking a little confused ; can I help you with something ? 
 Don't worry ; I can help you with that . I understand that new technology can sometimes be unnerving . The first thing we need to do is check the ATM is in service . This one is fine . 
 Yes , this one is in service . Put your card in here , in this slot and wait a moment . Then you will see some instructions on the screen . 
 And press ' enter ' to confirm , here . Now you need to decide which service you need . 
 That's the beauty of these machines , you can do almost anything . And unlike a person , they don't usually take breaks or go off sick ! 
 Yes.Which kind of salad dressing would you prefer ? 
 I'll do that then . 
 OK . This way , please . 
 Let me see . 100 dollars . 
 Sorry . You can only pay in cash . 
 Thank you . Do you need the invoice ? 
 Sure . I'll get right on it .

 Come on . Let's split the difference , 15 % . 
 Show me your card , please . 
 That's right , sir . Here are your tickets . Have a nice day . 
 Please pull your vehicle over to the side of the road.Please roll down your window . 
 Have you been drinking ? 
 Really ? But I can smell alcohol on your breath . Blow into this breathalyzer , please . 
 If you refuse to blow , you'll receive a much severer punishment . 
 Your BAC exceeds the legal limit . 
 I'll have to write you a ticket and suspend your driver's license for 3 months . 
 I'm afraid I won't be free next week . 
 That's OK . 
 I'd like two kilos of eggs . 
 Do you have the eggs with the red yolk ? 
 Why ? 
 Oh , My God ! That's terrible . 
 Then give me the ordinary ones .

 A , do your best , it's very important . 
 All right . I want to bring everybody in on this project . When can we start working on this ? 
 I tell you what , 8: 00 is no good for me , but why don't you guys get started and I'll come by at around 8: 45 or so . 
 Do you want to sign for a Korea language class ? 
 Right , we have located a business partner in Seoul . The first contact proves to be successful . The general manager of South Korean company has scheduled to pay a visit to us next month . I think it is quite possible to set up a joint venture company with them soon . 
 A slow sparrow should make an early start . You know , I am not quick at learning any language . 
 Yes , you're right . We have to equip our company with a network of workstations at every office as soon as possible . 
 Good . We can contact the Tiana Office Furniture Store , and ask them to install computers in our company , deliver new tables and other furniture to match the function of the computers , and to improve our work atmosphere simultaneously .

 Not at all . I am pleased to tell you these . 
 OK . I am coming . 
 I have checked the weather report . It says it will be cloudy , but no rain .

 Thank you so much ! 
 I have some I can bring from our place , and there ’ s some more out at my parents ’ . 
 Yeah . I have one from college at my parents ' house . 
 Sure , but I don ’ t have hot water , yet . 
 No , they ’ re coming tomorrow morning to turn the gas on . My phone should be working then , too . 
 Yeah , I can ’ t cook anything until tomorrow , anyway . 
 Take my VISA . 
 What ’ s going on ? 
 That can ’ t be right ! 
 I don ’ t have another one . 
 I didn ’ t bring cash with me today . 
 I ’ ll come back for them tomorrow .

 We have this new model in red , white , black , or silver . These are the standard colors . Of course you could specially order from various other colors too .

 You ’ re welcome . Feel free to ask me any time you need help . 
 Thanks , Monica . Without support from you and other colleagues , I would not have made it . 
 Well , just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough , you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective . Don ’ t be afraid of taking challenging . They might be opportunities and failing is not fatal . You learn more from that actually . Sometimes , you need to fail to be successful . 
 I think it is a smart idea . Our boss always likes it when employees take initiatives . 
 Three . 
 I am in charge of the trading department . I'm handling invoices , shipping bills and computing freight costs , that's most of the documentation . 
 I must be there no later than 9:00 . 
 I quit work whenever I get finished , usually about six o'clock . 
 No , the secretary does this . It's not part of my job . 
 I am working in a small company where further promotion is impossible , so I decided to change my job . I'd like to find a job which is more challenging . 
 It's July 5th . 
 I'm leaving on Sunday . We're going to Canada . 
 Yeah I know . 
 About 2 weeks . 
 I'm coming back on the 17th .

 Honey , it's almost noon . We have to go home and make lunch for your sister . 
 Peter , it's a quarter to twelve . Let's go home now ! 
 Sure . Let me get it for you .

 Certainly , the mirror is right here . 
 Hello . I'd like to send 600 RIB in cash to my daughter . How long will it take for her to receive the money ? 
 Are there any extra charges , like commission ? 
 Oh , Sam ! Is this your dog ? 
 Cindy , you're so cute . 
 I have a little white cat . 
 Yes , cats are always gentle . and they don't need a lot of space since they're small . 
 Not at all . They're quiet most of the time.But they can be every bit as affectionate as dogs . 
 Absolutely . Believe it or not , I found my cat by a garbage can around my neighborhood two years ago . 
 Yes . It was starving and looking for something to eat when I saw it . 
 Now we get along very well . It makes me feel that I'm someone special . 
 Hello . My name is Jessica Smith . I ’ d like to cancel the newspaper .

 Watch out for strangers , and don't go too far away . Alright ? 
 Which bank ? There are two , the Allied Irish Bank and the Bank of Ireland . 
 You need to go to the Allied Irish Bank which is near the local shopping centre , Dunned Stores . 
 Cross the road and turn left at the other side . Walk along the footpath until you reach the traffic lights . You will see a shopping centre on the right hand side . Walk across the road and turn right after the shopping centre . Keep going straight for about 100m and the bank is to your left . 
 It's not so complicated . It's about five minutes walk from here . I can draw a map for you if you wish . 
 You will be going northwards . You are now in the the Western part of the city and the Allied Irish Bank is situated in the North East . Here's a rough sketch of the area . 
 Not too good , I'm sorry . 
 It was close.To be honest , you had the lowest price by three cents per hint , but they didn't like your delivery date.Acme promised them almost a full month sooner . 
 Yes , they loved the price , the delivery date was the problem . They just didn't want to cut the delivery date that close.If something went wrong and you didn't deliver , we might not be able to get stock in time for Christmas.If you could have been two or three weeks faster on delivery , they might have gone with you . 
 No.It was very close and they argued over the bid for a long time . Better luck next time . 
 That's possible , Bill.But the price would have to have been a lot lower , like around fifty cents per unit . 
 We've got several kinds . All are made of different materials . 
 Well , here is one made of duralumin . That's cheap and durable . Over there we've also got some made of stainless steel , and those over there are enamel ones . 
 Yes , sir . Stainless steel products are always popular . 
 Almost ready . Could you set the table ? 
 We'll have fruit salad to start and then the roast beef . 
 I didn't prepare it , but if you want , I can cook some . What soup would you like to have ? 
 Hello there , Sir . I've dealt with you before , haven't I ? 
 Yes , of course , Mr Peters ! Good to see you again . What can we do for you today ? 
 I see . We offer Agent Services free of charge here . Before your new business begins trading , we could , on behalf of your existing company , do a series of registration and get the certificates you need . If you are unsure of the local laws , that is . 
 Yes , I'm calling from Mexico . I will be in town next week and would like to know if you have availability . 
 Yes , July ninth . I will be there for seven nights . 
 What's the difference ? 
 OK , I would like to reserve the superior suite . Is breakfast included ? 
 Sure , my credit card number is ... 
 Here you are . You look younger in yellow . 
 $ 100 . 
 Could you cover for me on Tuesday ? I'm not coming back until Wednesday . 
 We're going to the beach for the weekend . 
 No . Just some fun in the sun . We really need to get away and relax for a few days . 
 Hello , can I start you off with anything to drink ? 
 Sure , would you like any appetizers today ? 
 No problem , can I get you anything else ? 
 Okay , let me know when you're ready to order your food . 
 Okay , what can I get you ? 
 Will that be all ? 
 Are you ready to order yet , sir ? 
 Yes , sir . It'll be a moment . 
 Miss Liu , please come in .

 No , that ’ s no problem . I ’ m sorry to hear you ’ re not feeling well . Get some rest . If you need to see a doctor , let me know .

 You did a good job for the company . You deserve it . 
 So . this is your first day in the new position . How do you feel ? 
 I believe you are cut out for this position . You're an outstanding individual . 
 The telephone is ringing . Can you answer it , Sue ? 
 Thanks , Sue .

 Some friends of mine are going to visit me this evening . Would you please buy some fruit for me ? 
 That's a good idea . Can you help me to get some ? 
 A basket of lilies . 
 Right . Here is five hundred yuan in advance . Is it enough ? 
 Great ! Thank you very much . 
 To speak frankly , it doesn't depend on me . 
 I really want to obtain a permanent job . I won't leave as long as I have opportunity to apply my knowledge and get on well with my superiors and colleagues . 
 I know that generally it is possible to move from this position to a management position with two years experience in the company 
 Sorry . You've got the wrong number . 
 We have a variety of transportation services . Would you prefer a private vehicle to a taxi ? 
 Perhaps you'd prefer a limousine . That's such a stylish way to travel . 
 And what is your destination ? 
 I see . What time do you want to depart from the hotel ? 
 Okay , a taxi will arrive in seconds , sir . 
 It won't be but a few seconds , sir . 
 Yes , it really needs redecorating . 
 I don ’ t suppose you could . 
 I ’ ll be glad if you would .

 Show me your tongue , please . All right , stay in bed and keep yourself warm . I'll prescribe some pills for you to take . 
 Yes . You'll be better in a few days , I'm sure . 
 Goodbye . 
 I really didn't mean to . 
 It looks okay to me . 
 What's wrong with it ? 
 I didn't do that . 
 If you'd just give me your number and insurance , then I'll handle it . 
 Don't worry . 
 I'm afraid you can ’ t . 
 Just a moment . Let me find out . Our manager Wil be here in a minute . So will you speak to him ? 
 Are we going to have dinner tonight ?

 All right.Take a seat , please.Would you like to be a shop assistant or a cashier ? 
 So now do you want a full-time job or part-time job ? 
 Now we really need some part-time workers.You see , our full-time staff knocks off at five pm , but now we hope to extend the hours to eight pm.We need some part-time shop assistants to work 3 hours a day from five pm to eight pm.But I am not sure if you are qualified for the job.Since most of our customers are foreign , competence of good communication in English is necessary here .

 Good.There is only thing to be settled.Ten RIB an hour is the maximum we can pay you.Is the rate of pay acceptable to you ?

 Why do you need running shoes ? You aren't a runner . 
 That's not the same.Maybe you want to buy running-shoe-style shoes , but not real running shoes . 
 There isn't much difference . But there is some difference.For one thing , real running shoes are much more expensive.They have very lightweight materials.They ' re designed for serious runner 
 They look like running shoes.They have the same shape . And you can use them for running too.But they're not so serious . They aren't designed for serious runners.You can use them for exerce 
 That's right.If you want a really lightweight shoe , you should buy a high-quality running shoe . 
 But it's a waste of money . You won't really run in them ! You don't need such a shoe to use exercise machines . It's just a waste of money . 
 Well , do what you like.There are different kinds of New Balance shoes though.You don't have to buy the most expensive . 
 Your sister is a fitness expert , huh ? 
 I really think you are stubborn about some things.But here . Let's look at the New Balance shoes .

 Can you recommend me one ? 
 Welcome to IBA . What can I do for you today ? 
 No problem . Could you let me have your card and the money to be deposited ?

 Dick , I ’ Ve decided not to rent that house . 
 I ’ Ve changed my mind . 
 Well , I think maybe I should find a house that is closer to where I work . 
 OK ! Let's get down to business now . 
 As you know , we should work out cautious and detailed plan for our promotion , so as to guide our company to be successful in the new product , L-series . 
 I know that . I need to discuss this with Arden . And in his opinion , we should widen the scope of our ads , so newspaper and Internet should be adopted in this campaign . 
 Well . We plan to contact www . on-line advertising . com.cn and Shanghai Morning Newspaper to discuss the advertisement schedule . 
 What kind of media do you recommend ? 
 Well . Arden just mentioned the paper and the on-sales . And I can talk about TV with him later , because TV promotion gets more and more popular among consumers . 
 You look so excited . What happened ? 
 So they have started the year end sale earlier this year . 
 I guess I'll wait a few more days . There maybe even bigger discount then . 
 My name is Mary , and I will be your waitress tonight .

 Take the A train south to the Liberty Ave . stop . You should be able to find it from there . 
 The southbound A trains say Brooklyn . 
 Yeah . Hey ? What are you doing ? Let the people off the train before you get on . 
 Jeez . Tourists . 
 What's the problem ? 
 Really ? That's something unexpected . You see , all our exports were strictly inspected before shipment . The goods were in perfect condition when they left . 
 That could have happened in the course of transit or unloading , due to rough handling . 
 But there is nothing wrong with our packing . Our cartons are standard export ones and we also enforced them with straps . 
 I don't think the stevedores could have handled them with great care . 
 Sure . The exhibits on display were really fascinating . 
 Good idea . Let's ask the officer for help . 
 I've got a headache and a cough . 
 What should I do , doctor ? 
 Yes . 
 Thank you . 
 Oh , is it ? Let me check . 
 I'm sorry to say this room charge is yours . 
 Do you have any evidences ? 
 What do you do ? 
 Really ? That ’ s so cool . 
 What station do you work at ? 
 May I see your passport ? 
 How long are you going to stay ? 
 What is the purpose for your visit ? 
 Where are you going to stay ? 
 Do you have anything to declare ? 
 Is it okay to have a day off next week ? 
 I need to go to the dentist . 
 I ’ m glad you could make it . 
 I think a pipe burst in my apartment . 
 You ’ ll find the pipe in my bathroom . 
 It ’ s been leaking for a couple of days now . 
 I understand . 
 I just want the problem taken care of . 
 Could I ask some questions regarding to the social benefits ? 
 How long is my paid vacation every year ? 
 What about the insurance and housing policies ? 
 How often is the bonus ? 
 Do I have training opportunities ? 
 Well , I don ’ t have any other questions so far . I would like to think a couple of days before I give you my final answer . 
 Ok , thank you for your time and patience . 
 Can you tell me where the produce is ? 
 Do you know what produce is on sale ? 
 Can I take your drink order ? 
 The wine choices are posted on the little menu in the middle of the table . 
 We can make a number of mixed drinks at our bar . 
 Our house special is our Cuervo Gold margarita . 
 Can I prepare your drink on the rocks , or would you prefer it blended ? 
 Do you like your margarita with salt or no salt ? 
 Richard ! I need those tax forms from you before five ! 
 Okay . The sooner the better . 
 So am I on the right road to Piccadilly Circus ? 
 What did he say ? 
 That ’ s it . I think we ’ re one block beyond . 
 Yes , would you keep our bags until 6pm . 
 Yes we checked on just now . 
 Is this all right . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 No , there ’ s no need . We can change it within two days if it ’ s not damaged . 
 I know . I will pay attention to such a thing next time . 
 I'm going to Disneyland . 
 Okay , here are the graphs and figures for this month's sales . Let's review them all together . 
 I think you are looking at the wrong line . The rapid drop in sales wasn't our hair products . You are correct , the hair product sales decreased slightly , but not dramatically . The one that didn't do so hot this month was the cleaning products . I think there was a problem in the marketing plan . Some people were offended by our advertisements for the cleaning products , but it was already too late to mitigate the damage , so our mistake shows up in the sales . 
 That is our one major success . If you look at the other graphs , you can see that most of the other product lines remained steady with little increase . 
 Are you going to eat anything with your sandwich ? 
 Oh really , what kind of fruit do you like ? 
 What kind of apples do you prefer ? 
 I don't really like green apples that much . 
 I think they are too sour . 
 Don't you like red apples ? 
 Peter , why don't you go outside and play basketball with your friends ? 
 I just can't understand why you want to stay at home . It is such a wonderful day today . 
 Didn't you just finish watching a basketball game on TV ? 
 Oh , Peter . You really should go and play ball yourself rather than watching games . 
 You really shouldn't watch so much television . 
 Can you tell me where your wine list is ? 
 Can we order a mixed drink in this restaurant ? 
 Do you have any house specials that you could recommend ? 
 That sounds like a good choice for me . May I have one , please ? 
 Please bring it to me on the rocks . 
 I would like it with no salt , please . 
 Something awful happened . We went to the Portobello Road , and someone stole my handbag . 
 No . Only a few pounds . But my passport was in the bag . That ’ what I ’ m really worried about . 
 May I have the menu , please ? 
 Would you mind giving me a hand ? 
 Help me hang up this picture , please . Would you hold it straight while I put in the nail ? 
 Now , hand me the hammer and those nails , please . 
 There ! How does it look ? Tell me if I've got it straight . 
 How do we spend our holiday ? Do you have any good ideas ? 
 I am Liu Yi , from China XYZ Company . I ’ d like to see Mr . Thomas , please . 
 No , I am afraid not . I just arrive in town today . 
 Would you please ask when he will be free ? 
 John , I ’ Ve asked you not to smoke in here ! I don ’ t want to see you smoking in my office again . 
 That ’ s what you said the last time ! If you want to smoke , you ’ ll have to use your break time and go outside ! 
 It's my first time to come to Bangkok . Could you recommend some places for me ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 Sounds persuasive . How much will you charge for it ? 
 That's reasonable . Will you take care of meals for the day ? 
 I see . May I know the schedule ? 
 Royal Hotel , can I help you ? 
 Yes , we have . What kind of room would you like ? 
 No problem , sir . 
 It is $ 200 per night . 
 Yes , but the offer ended yesterday . I'm sorry . 
 No , sir . So far it is the least expensive suite for tomorrow night . 
 Yes , it does . Now could I have your name , please ? 
 Would you kindly spell it for me ? 
 Thank you , I got it . And how long do you expect to stay ? 
 OK . Our check-in time is after 12:00 . And see you tomorrow . 
 What kind of work do you want to do when you finish university ? 
 That ’ s a job that pays well . If you ’ re lucky , you might have opportunities to travel as well . Have you applied to any banks yet ? Our course will end soon . 
 Well done ! I haven ’ t sent off any job applications yet . 
 I ’ d like to work in marketing . I think I could have a good career in that field . 
 That ’ s great idea . Do you have the email address of human resource managers at any banks ? 
 What did you need to talk about ? 
 Like what ? 
 Your lease will be up in three years . 
 If you move out before then , you will not get your deductible . 
 Because our contract says that you will live here for three years . 
 I ’ m glad you understand . 
 No , the steak was recommended , but it is not very fresh . 
 So what ? It is not fresh and I'm not happy about it . 
 No , thank you . 
 No problem , if possible I always combine business with pleasure . Now , let ’ s hear more about these chocolates you ’ re offering . 
 Mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? Belgium ? 
 Really ? I didn ’ t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production ... 
 Oh , thanks . Mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ... 
 Yes , very interesting flavors ... Slightly spicy , very unique , that ’ s for sure . Exactly what ARE the ingredients ? 
 Haggis ? What ’ s Haggis ? 
 I wonder who that man is . 
 The one smoking a cigar . 
 Welcome to Galant . How can I help you ? 
 Of course . We have three different plans with different prices you can choose from . The first one is the cheapest but most basic plan which is thirty dollars a month . This is for broadband internet with a download speed of five hundred and twelve kbps . 
 Well , this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . I suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . That way you can play games online without any lag . This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall absolutely free ! 
 Lucky for you , this month we aren ’ t charging our normal installation fee . You are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! And we ’ ll throw in this pen drive ! 
 Could you make up this prescription for me , please ? 
 What can I do ? 
 Could I ? 
 Great . I'll take this brand . And how do I take these medicines ? 
 Thank you . 
 I want to make a phone call . Can you show me how ? 
 Yes , now what do I do ? 
 No , nothing changed . 
 I am trying to call my boss . 
 I know a few extensions but I don't know them all . 
 We're thinking of ordering fifty refrigerators . But , there's one problem . 
 The only problem is the price . It's not possible for us to make any sales at this price . 
 I'm afraid I can't agree with you there . Your price is much higher than other companies . 
 I don't deny that the refrigerator is of top quality . If you could go a little lower , we'll place the order right away . 
 All right , we'll wait for your answer . 
 Take it easy , madam . And speak slowly . May I have your name first ? 
 What's your son's name ? 
 Can you describe his appearance to me ? 
 OK , I see . Dear Daniel , please come to the broadcasting station when you've heard this , your mother is waiting for you . If other tourists see a boy in a blue sportswear and a pair of white sportsshoes , 1.4 meters , please ask him to go to the broadcasting station . Thank you ! 
 There's a copy machine on the first floor in our computer lab , sir . 
 It's ten cents a copy , sir . 
 A dime is still a bargain , sir . 
 What are you thinking of getting ? 
 You can get a burger , or some Chinese food . Or maybe you can get some Mexican food . 
 Where are you going to get your Chinese food from ? 
 When I want Chinese food , I go to Panda Express . 
 The food isn't bad there . 
 have you ever been in an earthquake ? 
 do you know where it measured on the Richter scale ? 
 no , but I was in quite a few tornados when I was younger . 
 I'm from the plains of the Midwest . It's a prime location for tornadoes . 
 most of the time we were lucky , but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room . 
 actually , some of my fondest memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass . 
 no , but my father's car was destroyed in a flood once . It actually happened the day after he bought the car ! 
 Do you know how to drive ? 
 Could you teach me how to drive ? 
 Yes , I have my learner's permit . 
 I've only driven a car one time . 
 I know them . 
 We can do it when you have some time . 
 I'd like to order a restock on my minibar . 
 Absolutely everything . 
 Three bottles each of Perrier and Jim Beam . 
 The apples were great . Could you bring a couple more up ? 
 Some grape juice would also be nice . 
 This is the house I want to rent . 
 No problem . First , it's comfortable and cozy . Second , it has a lovely view of the city . Third , it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need , such as refrigerator , electric stove , heating apparatus , washing machine and dishwasher . Forth is the most important , the electricity is free of charge . Finally , it's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient . 
 200 dollars per week . 
 It certainly is . But to tell you the truth , the room is so large that I can share it with someone else , and that will decrease the total amount of the rent . 
 Don't you think I can save some bus fares since it ’ s easy to go anywhere from here and it ’ s near the place where I work ? 
 Twice a week for work and once for shopping . 
 That's true . Ok , I will think about it . 
 Yes , do you have an appointment ? 
 Well . The doctor doesn't see nobody without an appointment . 
 Oh , I see . Maybe we can fit you in at 3 . 
 Oh , why didn't you say it's an emergency ? Here , fill out this form and take a seat . I'll send you in next.You don't have insurance ? 
 How about traveler's insurance ? 
 Can you pay cash , then ? 
 All right , all right , relax . I am only trying to do my job . 
 Diana's Flowers , Diana Lin's office , may I help you ? 
 No , she's out for lunch . May I take a message ? 
 Ok , I'll make sure she gets the message . 
 Yes , I can . 
 About 100 words a minute . 
 Yes , I can speak Spanish , and I can also speak Chinese . 
 No , I can ’ t speak French . But I can speak Italian , not very well though . 
 Next week ? 
 You mean I have the job ? 
 Hello.Is this room service ? 
 This is room 1425.We asked for the room service an hour ago . 
 What's the matter ? 
 Is it really going to take that long ? Will you rush the order ? 
 Ah , well , we have no choice . 
 What ? You don ’ t know the first thing about gardening ! 
 Oh yeah ? Tell me then , smarty pants , how will you go about setting up your garden ? 
 What type of tools ? 
 Right . Well it seems like you have all your bases covered . What ’ s next ? 
 Well , good luck with your garden , especially considering we are in the dry season and it won ’ t rain for the next three months ! 
 What ? 
 Huh ? Oh , my name is Laura . 
 Huh ? I can't hear you , the music's too loud . 
 Hold on , my ears are still ringing from the music ... what was it you asked me ? 
 Sometimes , usually once every few weeks . Do you ? 
 I usually come with a group of friends . We dance a little , have a few drinks , and just have a good time . 
 That's good . It's good to hit the books , but you need to get out once in a while . 
 May I speak to Peter ? 
 Have you every belonged to a political party ? 
 Really ? I know you are very concerned about the environment . You were a member of the pressure group Greenpeace , weren ’ t you ? 
 The green party have no chance of winning an election . The other parties are too big and popular . 
 Most people are not very politically aware . They often don ’ t understand the issues fully . 
 Excuse me ! 
 Is this your handbag ? 
 Is this your handbag ? 
 Look , George , There's the Great Wall . 
 Yeah , it stretches over for thousands of miles . 
 Where can we climb it ? 
 Well , we could take the cable car . 
 Okay . Let's go . 
 But we made it . 
 It was first built about twenty-five hundred years ago . 
 There are so many ancient relics in China . 
 Not a bad idea ! 
 Well , let's see . I'd like to go to the Summer Palace . 
 Mary , come here . I've found the book our teacher recommended us to buy last week . 
 You know , it is the best seller for this year . It has had its fifth impression since its publication early this year . 
 Wait a minute . I found there were two printings . The paperback books must be much cheaper . 
 Hello , this is Than Hua's office . Can I help you ? 
 Speaking . 
 That's right . What can I do for you ? 
 Would you like me to show you our new cleaning unit ? It's a clever design . 
 It washes the solvent off all the metal parts - the blades , trays etc . - and then sends it back into the system . 
 Well , it's basically two tanks – one for the dirty solvent and one for the clean solvent , a pump and a washing unit . Oh , and there ’ s a cooling system and a filter . It's all controlled by a PLC system – that stands for Process Logic Control . 
 I'm doing it for fun and fitness . 
 At the age of 64 ? You're kidding ! 
 Pete ! Nice to see you Well , on top the norm , you know , wife and kids and work , I ’ Ve actually gotten into doing some trading . 
 Currencies . 
 It ’ s called Forex . Foreign Exchange . The great thing about it is that I don ’ t have to invest a huge amount . I put in a margin deposit and then I can buy and sell up to 100 times that much ! 
 You got it ! Just last night I made USD 150 ! 
 Yeah ! It ’ s a 24 hour market ! I had bought some RIB earlier at a low asking price but last night it appreciated drastically so I made a split second decision and sold all my RIB at an amazing bid ! I ’ 
 I would like to discuss purchasing a home with you . 
 I would like to live in Pasadena or Arcadia . 
 We would like a smaller cozy cottage with 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom . 
 No , we don ’ t really care because they are all pretty good around here . 
 We really want to live in a lakeside home with a dock for our boat . 
 Look over there . That is what I am looking for . Let's go ! 
 Don ’ t chicken out ! Come on ! 
 Fine . Shanghai and Beijing are thousands of miles away . How about bullet train ? Faster and relatively cheap , I think . 
 Oh , what a shame . Only sleeping cars have tickets . Others are all out of stock . The price of the sleeping car is almost the same as the airplane.You see , the discount plane tickets are no more than 500 yuan . A good deal , isn't it ? 
 Hello , thanks for calling 123 Tech Help , I ’ m Todd . How can I help you ? 
 It ’ s okay sir , calm down . What happened ? 
 Ok , sir , it sounds like you might have a virus . 
 No , your computer might have a virus , I mean , it has a bad program on it . Maybe that ’ s why it crashed . I recommend that you run an antivirus program in order to safely remove any unwanted spyware or Trojans . 
 Here comes the bus . 
 It has a receiver , a CD player , a double cassette deck , and a turntable . 
 The CD player is a three-disk player . Here , we'll put a disk in so you can check out the sound . ( He puts a CD into the CD player . ) 
 You can also play Ccds on it if you hook it up to your TV . 
 No problem . Hope to see you again soon . 
 I have four years study in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and it has given me a solid theory foundation . Moreover , I have worked at CAB Company for 4 years and got a lot of practical experience . 
 I am a senior mechanical design engineer . 
 Yes . Here it is . 
 Of course , I designed a more powerful gasoline engine , which greatly increased the speed of limousines . 
 You see this is the first time for me to use the swimming pool . I've got no idea about the water temperature of the pool . I'm afraid it might be a little cold . 
 I see . But I'm not a good swimmer . Can you tell me how deep the pool is ? 
 That's great ! Can you give me the key to the locker ? I can't wait to have a try . 
 Today is my wife's birthday , so I want to buy a bouquet for her . 
 I have no idea . 
 But rose is too common . 
 It looks good . Pack me a bouquet of violet , please . 
 My watch says half past five . 
 Oh yeah . It loses only a few seconds in the whole month . 
 Hi , I ’ m Ray , your tenant in Room 209 . 
 There ’ re some problems in my apartment . First , the faucet in the bathtub drips constantly . 
 One of the burners on the stove doesn ’ t work . 
 I can ’ t control the temperature . 
 Well , there ’ s one more thing . The telephone is dead . 
 Okay . Thank you very much . 
 It was good to see you here , John . 
 Pretty good.Thank you . 
 I would like to have my coat washed . 
 That's it.By the way when can I get it back ? 
 Well , but I need it tomorrow morning . 
 That's fine . Please send it to my room tomorrow morning . 
 What's the matter ? Please tell me . Maybe I can help you . 
 Don't worry . I know about this . 
 First you should have a salutation , which can be the company's or a person's name . 
 Then you can write about his performance in college , including his academic achievements and his competence . 
 You can also state his personality traits , hobbies and relationships with schoolmates and so on . 
 You can write all his strengths in the recommendation letter . 
 You should also state that you are his class president , so you are qualified to write this recommendation letter 
 Do you feel all right ? 
 I am sorry . It's not allowed . If you do want , please go to the smoking section . It's in the back part of the plane . 
 What ’ s wrong with you ? Why are you scratching so much ? 
 Let me have a look . Whoa ! Get away from me ! 
 I think you have chicken pox ! You are contagious ! Get away ! Don ’ t breathe on me ! 
 Well in the meantime you are a biohazard ! I didn ’ t get it when I was a kid and I ’ Ve heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult ! 
 Hello , is Marie Ward there , please ? 
 Ok . 
 Can you give her a message , please ? 
 Please tell her to give Colin a call when she gets back . She has my number . 
 Thank you for your help . 
 Are you going to vote ? 
 Yes , and for the first time . 
 I don ’ t know how to vote . 
 I ’ m not sure what laws are being voted on . 
 They do ? 
 Thanks for telling me . 
 What would be the earliest that I could actually move into my new house ? 
 What should we do to make sure that we have the electricity and water turned on ? 
 There are a few things that we want to do to the place , like painting and carpet cleaning . 
 I asked the store to deliver my new appliances on the day we are moving in . 
 I could use some help on moving day . What are you doing on Saturday ? 
 Mrs . Lin . Please hold all of my calls for the next hour . 
 Yes , I'll talk to her . 
 May I help you , sir ? 
 By air or by sea ? 
 How about this wallet ? It's made of fine leather . 
 This gift is the best for a man who has everything . 
 Excuse me , miss . I'm a transit passenger for Flight No . 207 . Can you tell me where to go ? 
 Where's Gate 12 ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 I love it . I really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it . It gives me a real sense of satisfaction . Do you enjoy cooking ? 
 You can ask the guests to help . My guests usually insist on doing the washing up . I just have to remind them where everything goes . 
 Italian , Indian , and Chinese . I ’ Ve only recently started cooking Chinese meals and I need some more practice . 
 Not at all . You can find most of them at supermarket . The ingredients are usually the same as in western food . The way that the food is prepared is the big difference , not the ingredients . 
 Obviously , it depends on what I'm cooking , but I'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours . 
 Uh , yes . I'm going to the States and I need some traveler's checks . 
 One thousand U . S . dollars . 
 Oh , no . I want to withdraw from my U . S . dollars savings account . 
 Right . Here it is . 
 Mm . In hundreds , please . 
 Yes.If you don't mind sharing room with someone else , there's one available . 
 800 yuan a month . 
 Sorry , but I'm on my way out now.Could you come back in an hour ? 
 Good morning , sir . 
 Right here , how can i help you today , sir ? 
 Do you have an account this bank , sir ? 
 May i please see ID ? 
 Today's rate is 2.57 Singapore dollars for 1 US dollar , here is your money , sir.Please count it and sign your name here . 
 You can cash them here , how much do you want to cash ? 
 How would you like it ? 
 Ok , here you are . 
 Thank you , have a good day . 
 He's cute ! He looks like Tiger Woods ! But , I can't dance ... 
 Nice to meet you . I'm Wen , and this is Nikki . 
 She doesn't mind if you don't mind getting your feet stepped on . 
 I really don ’ t know how to teach my son . He's getting far above himself . 
 Maybe you are right . I will discuss it with my wife tonight . 
 Hmm , they look interesting . Can I have a copy of your brochure ? 
 OK . Go ahead . 
 How amazing ! I have never seen it before . Is it expensive ? 
 OK , I will take one . 
 Oh , I'm sorry , Nigel . I'm rushing to a meet right now . 
 Sure , but this week is crazy for me . Can we make it next Monday ? 
 That's fine . See you then . 
 What are you planning on cooking ? 
 If you plan on eating , you are . 
 What do you feel like having ? 
 That sounds really good . 
 I have no plans on cooking tonight . 
 I knew that already . 
 Who do you know there ? 
 I see . 
 Yeah , but it isn't more expensive than international calls . 
 Easy . Dial the area code for Connecticut ; then dial your friend's number . 
 Check the local time before you call . You don't want to wake your friend up by accident . 
 Just a moment , sir . Let me check the reservation list . Sorry , I'm afraid we're fully booked tonight . Would you like to make a reservation some other time ? 
 Yes , the same service and food as in the evening . 
 OK . Your name , please ? 
 Good . Thank you very much . 
 I see . 
 I graduated from Peking University . 
 I studied economics , I am especially interested in the economic development of China . 
 I like Business Management , and i think it's very useful for the present work . 
 I've taken courses on office administration , reports and correspondence writing . I think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager , because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork . 
 You should pay close attention to your manner of speaking . Speech is a reflection of personality , you know . You should reflect confidence by speaking in a low voice , loud enough to be heard without being aggressive or overpowering . 
 Your speech should not call attention to itself , but should reveal your individuality and ability . 
 You ’ d better overcome your nervousness . it is considered an indication that you lack self-confidence . 
 In China , it is impolite to look into the senior speakers eyes while speaking . But in Western countries it is the opposite . Eye contact gives a strong feeling of sincerity . Looking downwards or sideways shows that you are either insincere or absent-minded . 
 Yes . Don ’ t eat onions or garlic before you come . If you do you ’ ll have bad breath . 
 You should never chew gum or smoke during an interview , even if you are allowed to do so . 
 Good afternoon , ABC Incorporated . How many I direct your call ? 
 I am sorry , sir . He isn't in right now . Would you like to leave a message ? 
 And your company name , please . 
 Is there a telephone number where you can be reached ? 
 Thank you , sir . I'll tell him you called . 
 Do you see that small white car over there ? It ’ s Tom ’ s new car . 
 It is very expensive . Tom ’ s father paid for it . 
 They are By new models now , they are not very expensive . Maybe you should look for one . 
 Thank you very much . 
 I am looking for a more challenging position . I can ’ t grow anymore in my current job . 
 I have studied carefully the information about your company on the internet and I have checked your company ’ s homepage . I am impressed by the company . And I like the products a lot . Since you ’ re growing steadily , I would be very eager to help you to improve your accounting system . 
 I work quite well with a team . I ’ m a good team player . I respect people , cooperate well with member ’ s team . And I will do my best to help team members . 
 I ’ d like to bring to ABC Company not only my technical skills , ambition , enthusiasm , but also my loyalty , a sensor desire to become an administrative assistant . It is the hardest of my career plans . 
 I want a shirt . 
 Well , do you have the same in black ? 
 Excuse me , sir , your steamed crabs is coming . 
 Mix a little soya sauce , vinegar and sliced ginger on this plate and dip the meat in it before eating . 
 Excuse me , do the buses stop here ? 
 I want to go to Broadway and 82nd Street . Can I take any bus that comes along ? 
 How often do the buses run ? 
 Fine . How long does it take to get to 82nd Street ? 
 Yes , I am . I arrived only three days ago from Japan . 
 I like it very much , but it's a little confusing to me . 
 Thank you for the information . 
 How is the project going ? 
 Do you have any problem during the process ? You should speed things up . 
 Have you ever helped others when they are in trouble ? Most will give a hand to someone who has helped him . 
 And you should have good co-operation with other colleagues , you know a scientific schedule brings efficiency to the work . 
 Cheer up and pay more attention to your colleagues and the things will be much better . I am speaking from my experience . 
 And you should read as much as possible to enrich the knowledge . 
 We're approaching the critical point for success or failure of this project . you'd better speed up and catch up with books . 
 If you have any problem in your work , let me know . 
 Mr . Thomas is making a long-distance call . Please wait for a few minutes . 
 Coffee would be fine . 
 I like it black . 
 Good afternoon , can I help you ? 
 How many and what kind ? 
 Anything else ? 
 $ 16 . 50 . 
 You are welcome . 
 Yes , I do . 
 No , by train . I think it's much safer than bus . 
 yes . Which one is the brake again ? 
 I ’ m glad this car is an automatic . I don't like having to change gears . 
 you should also put yours on . you never know what will happen with me in the driver ’ s seat ! 
 I can ’ t see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car . Could you move it forward a bit , please ? 
 that ’ s better . Now what ? 
 the tank is almost empty . I guess I ’ ll drive to the petrol station to fill it up . 
 I got it . Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll get you there in one piece . 
 why does that cop car behind me have its red lights on ? 
 I go to the gym every day to keep fit . 
 I've been doing yoga for a long time . 
 Yoga is used to promote people's physical , intellectual and mental harmony and healthy . 
 Oh , I feel really tired and sweat a lot . 
 Sure . But more importantly , I can have peace of mind . 
 Yes , I think so . I have just checked out . But I left my book in the room . Can I get it back ? 
 Yes , thank you very much . 
 Good afternoon . What can I do for you ? 
 Your name , please ? 
 Wait for a minute , Mr . Brown , a single room with bath from today to the fifteenth . 
 Would you like to register now ? 
 Could you fill out this registration form , please ? 
 Yes . Thank you . May I see your passport , please ? 
 Thank you . Will you be paying in cash or by credit card ? 
 Your room number is 210 . The bellboy will show you the way there . I hope you enjoy your stay . 
 Here is your spicy diced chicken with peanuts , sir . 
 I would advise you to enjoy the dish while it is hot . 
 Yes . It's a traditional dish . 
 You are right , sir . To prepare it , a Sichuan food chef first fries some chilli until they turn reddish brown , and then puts diced chicken breast meat into the pot with other condiments and peanuts . That's why the dish has a bright colour . 
 Enjoy yourself , sir . 
 It is called Energy Collector . 
 Maybe . Oh . I see the Jungle Flying Train . I once rode it.It was very exciting . 
 Me , too . Daniel , look at your left side . Can you see the Air Force Ants ? 
 Good , you can make your dream come true here . 
 So you can prove you are a man . 
 It's just you ! 
 Oh , really ? Nice to meet you . I thought they were going to leave me here on my own ! How long have you been with the company ? 
 Does it ever ! Well , let ’ s get started . If you could begin typing this letter now , I ’ ll see what else needs to be done . 
 Hello , I ordered a dining table last week . The order arrived today , but there are several scratches on the surface of the table . I would like to exchange it . 
 Well , I'm hosting a dinner party this weekend . Couldn ’ t you make it any sooner ? 
 OK , thank you . 
 No so good . I broke traffic regulations yesterday and I got a ticket . 
 Certainly , as long as you don't tell my wife . 
 What happened ? 
 Where ? my car ? 
 Thank goodness ! 
 That's terrible . 
 I apologize for that . But the space is too small . 
 Can we solve this later ? I am calling the insurance company . 
 Should I tell EDD that I have found a job ? 
 What difference does it make ? 
 If I take a short job and then get laid off , will I be starting over trying to get unemployment ? 
 Excuse me , This bus goes down town , doesn ’ t it ? 
 The worker stadium . 
 Do you let me know where to get off ? 
 Thank you . 
 My washing machine isn't working . 
 The water will not drain . 
 No , that's it . 
 When will you be able to fix it ? 
 That would be perfect . 
 See you then . 
 I am kind of busy right now , but maybe later next week I could stop by . 
 What problems did you find ? 
 I don ’ t really consider any of that to be my responsibility . You can fix those things yourself . 
 I am maintaining the building . You are way too picky ! 
 You wouldn ’ t dare do that ! 
 She is now in a private school . 
 It's idea of my husband . He is always banging the drum for better schools . 
 Mr . Wang , I want to apologize for being late again this morning . I just can't get up in time for work . 
 I guess I'll have to buy a new alarm clock . 
 Yes , I hear about it every time she comes here . 
 I think she misses that job and wants to take it out on us . 
 I think she just likes to make us miserable . 
 Good morning , Mr . Montgomery . I've been sent over from purchasing to fill in for Clare Williams . 
 Oh , about seven years . Time flies , you know ! 
 Let's take a break . 
 Sounds good . 
 Yes , can we help you ? 
 What sort of problem ? 
 Is the wet patch just in one place ? 
 Did you look in the attic ? 
 Is there easy access to the attic ? We'd better look since there may be some flooding there as well . 
 OK , we can come early this afternoon . Is anyone going to be at home ? 
 Right , we have an urgent job this morning but we should finish around lunch time . We will then come straight over to your house . 
 The kitchen stinks . 
 I guess I'm just a little nervous . I'm giving everything I have to invoking , and ... 
 Exactly . 
 How ? 
 But what about tomorrow ? What if Stars.com decides to go with WebTracker , and not us ? 
 I think so , but how should we write it ? 
 Yes , it should be so . Then we should write the body and in the body we should mention the place where we saw the job advertisement . 
 We should write our skills and let the company know we are competent for the job . 
 Oh , you have recommended yourself very well . I should think about how to recommend myself as well . 
 Yes . At the end , we should conclude the letter with greetings . 
 I understand we will need seven air conditioning units on the two floors.That ' s what you think , yes ? 
 And if we take the Decker units you suggested , what would the price be ? 
 Isn't there any way we can get central air conditioning in this building ? 
 That's too much . We need to use the separate units , I guess . 
 So you say we can do it for 6000 dollars . 
 You mean installation isn't included ? I'm very surprised . 
 In Taipei , you know , the company usually installs the things they sell.They don't charge extra . 
 Yes , I suppose I should get used to it.But I'm not really willing to spend more than 6000 dollars for this.We haven't even opened yet . 
 And the other company that gave me a quote on this said they could do it for 4000 dollars . 
 I will tell you what I can agree to.If you can quote me a price of 6000 dollars , installation included , I can accept . 
 You do seem like a better company than the other one.So I am willing to pay more than 4000 for you . But I won't pay more than 6000 . 
 Good . I hope we can arrange the contract as soon as possible . 
 You are welcome . I am very impressed by your capability . 
 No , nothing . It's thoughtful of you to call me again . 
 OK , I will . 
 Our school has a link on its website for apartments . 
 Some of the ads in the paper are from people looking for roommates . 
 Do you need a single apartment , or is this for two people ? 
 You can get that type of apartment for around fifteen hundred dollars a month . 
 I love apartment hunting . I ’ ll be happy to go with you . 
 I would like to go but I have to finish a very important presentation . Our boss needs it for tomorrow ’ s morning meeting and I was given the complete information only late this afternoon . 
 Oh , that will be great . Thank you so much . Please help me to double-check the name list . I have to make sure they are all correct . 
 Not for me . It is already late . I can not fall asleep after drinking coffee this late . 
 Hello . I'd like to have my nails manicured . 
 I don't need the full service . 
 No , thanks . All I need is painting and polishing . 
 Thanks very much . 
 I would like to book a table for seven thirty o'clock , please . 
 For four people . We'd like a quiet table with a fine view of the river . 
 This is Peter Kaufman . 
 Peter Kaufman , P-E-T-E-R ( Peter ) , K-A-U-F-M-A-N ( Kaufman ) . 
 Bye-bye . 
 I have been washing clothes here since a few years ago . 
 It doesn't cost me as much to wash here . 
 Why are you washing your clothes here now ? 
 You should just pay someone to fix it . 
 So you're just going to wash here ? 
 It costs less to wash here . 
 Since summer is coming , I think swimming is a good way for you to do . 
 Of course ! Swimming can help you stay in shape by targeting all parts of your body . 
 It could also help you increase vital capacity . 
 You will make it if you persist in it . 
 What ’ s wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ? 
 Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out . 
 Really ? OK , I will try my best to be relaxed . 
 What words ? Can you tell me ? 
 Honey , I don ’ t know what to tell you . Of course Tony is a young child . But do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason . 
 I suggest you treat him with patience , affection , and respect . If he needs to do something , like go to bed , or be washed , etc . , please guide or help him to get it done , but lead him with gentleness . 
 Motivate Tony to cooperate by rewarding his good behavior . Do not emphasize punishment for bad moods , etc . Do not threaten him with punishment if he resists the actions you desire . 
 Good morning , Madam . What can I do for you ? 
 That shouldn't be a problem , Madam . I'm sure we can sort this out for you quickly . 
 Well , to be honest , it will slow things down a little . But it's not a big problem . You can do it by T / T . 
 It means ' telegraphic transfer ' . So , if you use this way it's fast and secure and can be done from anywhere , to anywhere in the world . 
 Yes , I would like to book a table for six for the next Monday . 
 At 6:30 on next Monday evening . 
 Chinese food . 
 Please book it under the name of Mr . Peter . 
 That's right . 
 How much for these autographed Elvis records ? 
 Uh , I'm not sure . Are these all in good condition ? 
 I don't really need five . 
 Oh , why not ? I'll take ' em . 
 That's funny . My watch always loses ten minutes a day . 
 I am serious . Every morning I set my watch by the radio , but it still loses ten minutes . 
 Throw it away and buy a new one . 
 So you put your watch back ten minutes every day ? 
 Why bother ? Just buy a new watch . It doesn't cost much . Besides , I just can ’ t put up with this thing any more . 
 I ’ Ve been getting really short of breath , and my coach wanted to have a doctor check me out . 
 No , I have been pretty healthy . I just have trouble taking a really deep breath . 
 Peaches make me break out , but I don ’ t have any other allergies . 
 I ’ Ve noticed that it is worse when I am under stress , like during finals week . 
 I appreciate the referral , doctor . 
 They ’ re all doing fine . Let me show you some of their pictures . 
 That ’ s Charles . 
 All my children are large . 
 That ’ s James . 
 All my children are agile . 
 That ’ s Joanna . Joanna hopes to go to college . 
 You ’ re home late today , David . How was school ? 
 Oh , what ’ s she like ? 
 Is she old or young ? 
 Is she strict ? 
 Can she speak Chinese ? 
 David , stop dreaming . It ’ s time to do your homework . 
 Good afternoon . I have a reservation under the name of Hilton . 
 Sure . It's H-I-L-T-O-N . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 Yes , here you are . And here's my credit card , too . 
 Thank you , goodbye . 
 Could I ask you where the company is ? 
 Can I get there by the No . 913 bus ? 
 Have you heard about John ’ s obscene words towards the manager ? 
 Can you help me find a pan ? 
 I want a big pan . 
 Yes , it's the right size , but it weighs too much . 
 It's light enough , but the handle will get too hot after cooking . 
 Oh , my family's going to love this one . I'll take it . 
 Sure . Wait , wait . Does a lid come with this pan ? 
 May I see your airplane ticket , passport and health certificate please ? 
 Will you please put all your luggage on the scale ? 
 Sir , your bags are 30 pounds over weight . You are allowed only 45 pounds of baggage . 
 That comes to H . K . $ 120 . 
 No , I'm good . All we need now is our check . 
 I have never had bad service at this restaurant , but this time was really exceptional . 
 Let's take a look at our bill . The total price for our dinner is $ 36.00 . 
 I know that 15 % is a normal tip , but I really thought that this waitress went out of her way for us . What do you think about tipping her 20 % ? 
 So we can add her tip of $ 7.20 to the bill of $ 36.00 and the total will be $ 43.20 . 
 It absolutely was a great meal . We'll have to return here for lunch sometime . 
 Yes . I ’ m looking for something to wear to a formal party . 
 Medium , a woman ’ s size 10 or 12 . 
 Yes . 
 That ’ s a great idea . I ’ ll try it on . 
 It feels very good . 
 Okay . I ’ ll take it . Thank you very much . 
 I see an Open House sign over there , and I think we should go check it out . 
 Yes , I see it listed on the printout we got off of the Internet . 
 We need to make sure to put our names in the registry so the realtor knows we were here . 
 On such a hot day , it is thoughtful to have water out for potential buyers . 
 What is the price of this house in the flyer ? 
 Would you like to have a piece of cake ? 
 Why ? You're not fat . 
 Women of all shapes would be beautiful if they are self-confident . 
 Well . There's a beauty contest in Thailand just for fat beauties . 
 All the beauties who entered the contest were over 80kg . 
 Honey , have you all packed ? 
 It is cold on the mountain . Have you packed the windshelled clothes and bodywarmers ? 
 You are so thoughtful . Do you think our tent will be working well ? 
 What about our mobile phones and cameras ? Did you charge them last night ? 
 Good . We should tell our neighbour that they can call the police if some emergency happens to us . 
 Sally , what do we have for dinner 
 Well , I quit breakfast , so I had a rich brunch . I feel like having something mild for dinner 
 Noodles are fine . Or maybe I'll have some porridge . 
 Hi , can you tell me where I could make a copy of a document right now ? 
 That's great . I don't suppose the copy machine is free for guests ? 
 In the good old days , it was only five cents a copy . I'll be right down . 
 We've settled price , order , payment , now I am calling to ask about package . How can we pack the goods ? 
 Do you mean that we are responsible for putting them together ? 
 I see . Why not use wooden cases ? 
 Oh , I know . Does it mean that shipment will have to be delayed if I insist on using wooden cases ? 
 Then you may use cardboard boxes for outer packing so long as you can guarantee the safety of the computers . 
 Sounds good . 
 Yes . Is this your new product this year ? 
 When is the product going to be on the market ? 
 So soon ? It seems to be in the early stages . 
 Well , it's sounding good ! I'm looking forward to that . 
 Yes . Let me get you a pair . 
 The dress was on sale yesterday . 
 I'm so sorry , but rules are rules . 
 I'm sorry I couldn't help you . 
 Yes . Please send one " Fried Rice , Hangzhou Style " and one " Fruit Salad " to my room . 
 Yes , two bottles of beer . 
 Carlsborg . 
 No , thanks . 
 Yes , two of us . 
 Yes , Bill Smith in Room 713 . 
 Personnel . May I help you ? 
 This is she . Paul ? 
 Come on ! It's time to go ! 
 Well , I've got to stop and get gas in the car , first . 
 Well , it won't if there no line at the pump . 
 I'll give you five more minutes , then I'm going on without you ! 
 Oh , yes , I would ! 
 Mrs . Smith has not checked in yet . 
 Yes , I'll see that she get the message when she checks in . 
 We can take a bus there . 
 I think so . 
 No , it's too crowded . 
 Fine . Let's get on . Oh , no , Judy ! Get off the bus quickly ! 
 We got on the wrong bus . 
 I've got a terrible pain in my stomach , Doctor . 
 It started yesterday . I didn't eat any supper . 
 I think so . I feel very hot . 
 I've got an awful headache , too , and my throat hurts . 
 Is it serious ? 
 How often must I take it ? 
 Thank you , Doctor . Goodbye . 
 I'm sorry we don't ship overseas . It's too much trouble . 
 Maybe we could make an exception for you if you win the bid . 
 Yes . You'll get a picture of Serena playing with the racket and a document from her . 
 Yes , sir . How would you like to pay the bill , sir ? 
 Yes , sir . But we only accept American Express , Master card and Visa . What kind do you have ? 
 Wait a moment , please . 
 Good morning . I want to buy a lipstick for my wife because it is her birthday today . 
 Light pink . 
 I'd like her to have a change . 
 It is nice . Is it water proof ? 
 Okay , I'll take it . Could you help me gift wrap it ? 
 Excuse me . What should I wear if I want to go to an interview ? 
 I am afraid I would tense up during the interview . 
 Hi , is this Sue ? 
 Sue , this is Tom Lin from Allied Trust and I'm calling to offer you a position with our firm . 
 Senior account rep . 
 It starts at $ 30,000 . S 
 Did you smell something ? It smells so great . 
 How come I never knew that ? Do they have a new baker or something ? 
 Let's go and get some cookies . I am hungry now . 
 You can taste some before you buy it . They have food tasting at the counter . 
 It's one of my favorite bakeries . 
 You stay beside me ; I'll fry the meat in the oil first . 
 Er , I am gonna go with salt and sauce ! 
 Is there anything wrong ? 
 How can I help you this afternoon ? 
 Unfortunately , an ATM is being refilled because it ran out of money . That's what's causing the hold up . 
 You are right , you've just missed the lunchtime rush . Could you fill out a withdrawal slip , please ? 
 Thank you . And you require ... 
 Please enter your personal code right here , on the key pad . And sign here , please . 
 Thank you . Here's your card back and your money . Please double check it for me . 
 Hello , may I help you ? 
 Yes , everything is 25 % off . 
 Sure , we have both skirts and slacks that will go well with the sweater . I especially like this flowery skirt . It's very much in style this year . 
 Look on the rack to your right . 
 What are you going to take ? 
 Of course . What kind of soup do you like ? Clear or thick ? 
 Can I help you ? 
 Yes.There are two colors . 
 Yes . 
 Anything else ? 
 Would you please take a seat over there , madam ? I ’ ll let Mr . Emory know that you ’ re here . 
 Well , it may take some time . Mr . Emory ’ s at a meeting at the moment . It would probably be more comfortable over there . 
 Hello . Excuse me . Do you know if there's a Commercial Bank around here ? 
 Straight on , and turn right . Is it far ? 
 Thanks very much . 
 Mr . Charles , I feel that we have had a very pleasant talk . 
 Yes , your company is a big one in the field and has great potential . 
 I want to know about the salary information in your company . 
 I hope my starting salary will be 3,000 yuan a month if I become a formal worker . 
 Really ? That's good news for me . 
 It sounds great ! 
 By the way , how many days do we work every week ? 
 OK , I see 
 What about it ? 
 The cable is down right now . I am very sorry . 
 It should be back on in the next couple of days . 
 We're going to give you a credit while the cable is down . 
 No , not until your cable comes back on . 
 You're welcome , and I apologize for the inconvenience . 
 high ceilings , a tile bath and a big drawing room . 
 What about the one on the Yellow River Road ? 
 It's a bit small but looks nice . 
 Can I see your ticket please ? 
 Ok , Mr . Smith . Do you have any bags to check ? 
 And would you prefer a window seat or an aisle seat ? 
 Boarding time is 10:20 am . 
 Gate 29C . Have a nice flight . 
 Let's see . From here , you have to take the 278 bus . 
 You should get off at the first Shi Da stop . 
 You're new at this , huh ? 
 No , it's quite simple . When you get on , just ask the bus driver when to pay the fare and where you want to get off . 
 Only 15 NT per section . Oh look , that is your bus . 
 Don't mention it . 
 No , I haven't . What about you ? 
 What did you do ? 
 Why would you park in the red zone ? 
 Where were you at ? 
 I thought that you had your own parking spot ? 
 Hope it was worth it . 
 Thank you ! I am interested in your product . But I am not familiar with your corporation . 
 No wonder . 
 Thank you ! 
 I decided to take Kenny to the park and get some fresh air . 
 It wasn't too crowded , but we had a great time ! We got on the see-saw together , then went on a couple of different slides and then I tried to go with him in the jungle gym , but I didn't fit . 
 Yeah , but today he was really hyper . He even got on the monkey bars and then he went on to go on the swings for a half hour . I'm exhausted ! 
 Hello , Madam . Are you alright ? 
 Yes , that's correct , Madam . You don't need to go to a counter at all , you can use one of our ATM machines . I'll be more than happy to help you . 
 I know it does seem a little daunting , but once you get used to it , it will save you a lot of time and trouble . 
 I don ’ t think so , Mr . Parsons . I think you have covered all the main points for me . 
 Great . Rmm , when can I expect to hear from you ? 
 That sounds perfect . Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me Mr . Parsons . 
 I hope to hear from you very soon . 
 I'd like to reconfirm my plane reservation . 
 Flight 201 . 
 Anderson . 
 Thank you . 
 There is a formula that can help us figure that out . What is your annual salary ? 
 What is the length of time that you have worked at the job you have now ? 
 Do you receive any other income ? 
 Do you know what your credit score is ? 
 You are in good shape . Figuring in your other expenses , you can easily afford a house costing seven hundred thousand or maybe even a little more ! 
 I don't think dieting is good for you . It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with ! 
 They need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though . 
 Sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert . 
 Many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be a treat ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . If you want to lose weight and you can't stop drinking soda , try some diet coke . 
 My mother used to make me take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start . 
 You might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size than I am now ! 
 Yes , that looks great ! Is it on our Open House list ? 
 Well , it looks great from the curb . Let ’ s go on inside . 
 OK , let ’ s go check out the kitchen next . 
 Make sure that you pick up a flyer with the information about the home . 
 Yes , it seems to have been discounted from two hundred and thirty-five thousand to two hundred and twenty-five thousand 
 I know , Grandma , I just ... 
 Yes'm . 
 Yes'm . 
 Yes'm . 
 Yeah , I'm glad that we didn't have to wait long . I'm starving ! 
 What would you rather have , samosas or poppadoms ? 
 Well , let's get a plate of those then . 
 I think I might have a dahl . 
 It's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice . 
 Ok . How about some lamb kebabs ? 
 I think I'll have a beer . 
 I wouldn't recommend it . I think we should wait until she comes round . 
 What would you do without me ? 
 Do you have air ticket and claim tag ? 
 Well , then , would you fill out this PIR from ? And also we need your signature here . 
 Hopefully by tomorrow evening.Which hotel are you going to stay ? 
 When is the expected date of your departure ? 
 Hi Benjamin . My name is Dr . Green . What seems to be the matter ? 
 what are your symptoms ? 
 it sounds like you might be a bit dehydrated . Do you feel thirsty most of the day ? 
 have you been drinking plenty of water ? 
 ok . Well , we'll have a nurse take some blood in a few minutes to see if you're dehydrated . First , let me feel your pulse . 
 is anyone else sick in your home ? 
 I see . I'll have the lab techs run some tests to check for mono as well then . The burse will come in then to take your blood , we'll run some tests , and then you can go home . You should hear from us 
 I am looking for a pan . 
 A big one would be nice . 
 Oh , yes . I like that one . But it's too heavy . 
 Oh , yes , this is much better . But it has an aluminum handle . 
 Yes , that's perfect . I'll take it . 
 Oh , wait a minute . What about a lid for the pan ? 
 I don't know if you remember , but with honest every day last year we tided the knot . 
 How could I ever forget ? I even bought you roses because I love you . 
 You are more beautiful than the roses . 
 Yes , we are match made in heaven . 
 Yes , we did , we did have problems , but we shared a lot of happiness too . We countered the problems , and had a lot of happiness too . 
 I love you , happy anniversary . 
 You won ’ t believe who ’ s been elected to do overtime on the Baker account ! Me ! I ’ Ve already logged in 20 hours of overtime ! 
 They were supposed to , but so far nobody ’ s turned up , and I ’ m left on my own to do the work . This is the first break I ’ Ve had all day . 
 We're having trouble with Bob . 
 He's been late for work twice . 
 Good morning . 
 This is Mary.Can I speak to Anne please ? 
 Thank you.But I will call her later . 
 Goodbye . 
 Do you ? Dad is in the study . 
 Behave yourself ! Don't make any noise . Have you finished your homework ? 
 Then let me see . 
 All right . Just five minutes . Be sure not to touch anything . 
 Be careful ! 
 Hi , Monica , how is everything going ? 
 Why ? You ’ re not satisfied anymore ? 
 That is important . Doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application . 
 Ok , good luck to you . 
 Good Morning Mr Jones . 
 I will make it now . 
 I will bring the diary . 
 On Wednesday , you are going to London . Don't forget your train leaves at 9.30 am . 
 At 11.30 . And on Thursday Ms Von wants to talk to you . 
 She is our new project manager . She starts next week . 
 What is the telephone number there ? 
 When will you reach there ? 
 What is the customer's name , and what is his room number ? 
 Ok , I'll phone the customer right away.Do you want to pick him up at our office ? 
 Do you have perfume ? 
 I would like some light smell . 
 Can I smell it ? 
 Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 You have stayed for 6 day.Here is your bill . 
 Surely of course . But you have to be back by 5 o'clock , otherwise we will charge you 10 $ . 
 Are you familiar with the office management ? 
 Are you still interested in it ? 
 I would love to rent this apartment . 
 How much are you asking for every month ? 
 That is quite a lot of money for just one month . 
 What do you say to $ 850 a month ? 
 It ’ s either $ 850 or nothing at all . 
 Could you please go lower ? 
 Good coming , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 Certainly . Please wait a moment . Here is your bill . 
 This is the charge for your laundry service on Nov . 20thA 
 Would you mind waiting a moment while we check it with the department concerned ? 
 I'm very sorry , Mr . Bob . There has been a mistake . We'll correct the bill . 
 Thank you very much . Hope to see you again . 
 Good morning . I want to post this letter . Can you tell me what the postage is ? 
 I want this letter registered . There is something valuable inside . 
 I think so . Would you mind telling me the postage now ? 
 Here is ten dollars . 
 Thank you . Goodbye . 
 Excuse me , bags aren't permitted inside the supermarket . 
 Don ’ t worry . Just check in your bag before entering . 
 The checkroom is just behind the front door . 
 I cooked , so ... 
 Could you help me figure out why I am missing my unemployment check for this week ? 
 I am pretty sure that I didn ’ t send that claim form in . 
 Can I mail it in late ? 
 I think that I will mail it in right away when I get it next time , so I won ’ t be late . 
 Even though I was late turning in my form , will my paycheck be late ? 
 Hello , I would like to apply for a permit . 
 No , I left it in the car . 
 One moment while I go and get my ID . 
 Okay , here's my ID and the $ 27 . 
 Do you have a pen that I can use ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Oh , no . Charlie , where is my purse ? 
 Yes , I did . I lost it . It disappeared . 
 I had it when I left the house . I had it when we start to get the hotdog . 
 What's the deal with the Asia area sales ? Did you have a chance to look at any other reports that came in from the branch offices ? 
 What do the preliminary figures tell you ? Any kinds of trends going on for the branches in the Far East ? 
 For example ? 
 I am here to get my prescription filled . 
 Do you ever deliver prescriptions by mail ? 
 How should I take this medication ? 
 Should I avoid alcohol with this medication ? 
 Should I expect any side effects ? 
 That restaurant has six parking spaces . 
 Almost zero . 
 Certainly . Come to my office at ten ten . Be prompt , please . I've another appointment at 11 . 
 Good morning , how are you doing today ? 
 So , I can see by your chart that you are here for your annual physical . 
 We are basically going to check your heart , lungs , blood sugar levels , and eyes , ears , and nose . 
 Yes , I will check you for asthma , and maybe we can check you for allergies later . 
 We will be checking for blood sugar , cholesterol , and white blood cell count . 
 Good morning , Ms Chan . What can I get you today ? 
 Shoulder chops , Ms Chan ? 
 Would you like to choose a chicken ? 
 This one is our cheapest . 
 Yes , of course , Ms Chan . 
 Good morning ! I'd like to buy twelve tickets to Beijing for October 14th . 
 Well , the express one , with air-conditioning . 
 When do they arrive in Beijing ? 
 In that case I think Train No . 14 will be better . We can do more sightseeing in Beijing . 
 In a cushioned sleeper , please . 
 Hi , Jason . It ’ s Elizabeth Montgomery . Have you got those plans drawn up yet ? 
 Thanks a lot . Sorry to trouble you . 
 But , Mom , I'm not dirty . 
 Why ? 
 I don't smell bad . 
 If I smelled bad , I could smell me . 
 I can smell you , too . 
 When can I wear perfume ? 
 Of course , there're too many people . 
 But we couldn't help it . 
 Yes , I'm back ! It's nice to see you again . I'm here about those documents . 
 That's right . I had a phone call asking me to come back in , about rejecting them ? 
 Yes , we talked about it and thought it was better and significantly quicker to ask the company to pay a Discrepancy Fee . 
 That's wonderful news ! I'm glad we decided to rethink our actions ; it's all turned out for the best this way . Thank you for helping us to fix that little problem . 
 What kind do you want ? 
 Caesar salads are good . 
 What kind do you plan on making ? 
 Chicken salads are really good . 
 That sounds like a great salad . 
 That sounds like a plan to me . 
 Direct or non-direct ? 
 Yes . Right now it's the slack season so we will give you ten percent off . 
 Sure . you can get a further discount at 5 % . 
 No , you don't . Just fill out this card and sign your name and room number on it . 
 Yes , will this do ? 
 Wait a minute . This is your safe box key , don't lose it . You'll have to pay two thousand yuan if you lose the key . 
 Would you please bring us a menu ? 
 Western food . 
 Did you ever get a parking ticket ? 
 Yeah , I just got one the other day . 
 The ticket was for parking in the red zone . 
 There was nowhere to park , and I needed to run in and get something . 
 I parked in front of my apartment building . 
 But I really needed to be quick . 
 Excuse me . Does this bus go by Tiananmen square ? 
 At which stop should I get off ? 
 Okay , thanks very much . 
 Sorry , sir . The train has already left . 
 Yes . Your ticket is valid for three days . 
 You have to have your ticket checked . 
 No extra charge at all . But your berth will be invalid . 
 Thank you . 
 Your company has an impressive reputation . My uncle worked for your company for many years . 
 Yes , but he retired 5 years ago . 
 I ’ m a senior broker in a large company . I deal with clients on a daily basis , handling all aspects of their accounts personally . 
 Yes , I do think I am the right candidate for this position . 
 Well , I have a lot of experience in this area . I have all the qualifications you need . I enjoy working with people . In my current job , I ’ m in charge of a team of eight people . 
 Yes , if I were hired , when would you like me to start ? 
 And how many accounts would I handle ? 
 What kind of benefit package do you offer ? 
 No , not at the moment . 
 Thanks . It was very nice to meet you . 
 My child is often absent-minded in class . 
 But if he doesn't listen to the teacher carefully , he won't learn anything . 
 I hope so . 
 Wrong number . 
 No , it is not . 
 Hello , can I speak to Mark Wyatt , please ? 
 Does Mark Wyatt work there ? 
 W-Y-A-T-T , Mark Wyatt . 
 No problem . 
 Would she be interested in a laptop ? 
 A Mac would be an excellent gift . 
 You can take a 15 - inch Pro home right now for only $ 2,100 . 
 She'll be very happy with this . And how do you plan to pay for it ? 
 Now , if you'll just sign here , the Mac is all yours . 
 Everything she needs is right here in the box . 
 Your daughter should get straight A's from now on . Good-bye . 
 Your throat is inflamed . 
 Don't worry , it's not serious . You will get better soon . 
 I would like to file a complaint . 
 I was robbed . 
 It happened this morning . 
 My wallet and my cell phone . 
 Yes , I was . 
 That would be easy . 
 It's my pleasure ! 
 It is allowed to carry 55 pounds for each passenger . 
 You will have to pay some for every extra pound . 
 You can bring one , if you want to . 
 I'm having a little trouble with this form . 
 There are two types of L / C here and I'm not sure which one I want . 
 So , I should choose that one ? 
 I see . It's very nice of you to help me . Is this form alright ? 
 You have always got your nose in the air , which hurts many boys ’ hearts . 
 I would like to order cable . 
 What kinds of packages do you offer ? 
 What else do you have ? 
 Do you have a package that includes all the movie channels with the basic channels also ? 
 I want that . 
 No , but is it possible for me to add channels later ? 
 Jack ! You've really done it this time . 
 I told you to get this consignment out last week.We can't very well run a light bulb conference without any light bulbs , can we ? What am I going to do with you ? 
 Well , I guess I could give you one more chance , but this is the last time.In themeantime , I hear that Tom who normally does night shift is taking three weeks ' vacation , Can you think of anyone who would be willing to work nights while he is gone ? 
 Bingo ! 
 Excuse me , miss . What's the tour time we have ? 
 Got it . Thank you . 
 Sure . Where shall I begin ? 
 I went to the university of Ohio , in America . 
 I got a bachelor ’ s degree . 
 I majored in English and minored in Chinese . 
 I graduated with honors ; I had a 3.9 . 
 Yes . I ’ d like to obtain a master ’ s degree in international relations . 
 After I have 3-4 years of work experience . 
 I wish to make it clear at the outset that this matter of labels is entirely our problem . 
 The Federal Food and Drug Administration , or the FDA as we call it for short , imposes a whole set of regulations on the import of food products to the United States . Over the years , they have become so rigid and complicated that they are now quite a head - ache for us importers . 
 Ah , there's something in what you're saying . According to the present FDA regulations , the Ma Ling Labels then cannot be used if the lichee is to be offered for import into the United States . 
 I'd be quite willing to if I could , but we must comply with the label requirements according to our law , or we can't clear the consignment of lichee through the Customs . 
 Would you consider quoting us for the order with neutral cans on a C . I . F . basis for delivery in Hong Kong ? Our associated company there will have the labels printed to comply with the FDA regulations . 
 May I take a look at the shoes over there ? 
 Size 24 . Are they synthetic or leather ? 
 It's comfortable . I will take it . 
 I was in the Law School in Harvard University . 
 I want to be a lawyer in the future and the Law School was one of the best schools in Harvard . 
 Do you know which channel it is on ? 
 I used to be really interested in that . But lately it seems that they end up saying one thing and doing another anyway . So why listen ? 
 It's not that serious . 
 You get really passionate about this , don't you ? Alright . I'll watch it with you . 
 Thank you for inquiring . But your enquiry is too vague to reply . 
 Ok . I need to discuss it with our manager . We'll let you have our firm offer next week . 
 Ok . I will reply to you as soon as possible . 
 I see . What is your baggage ? And do not remember the tag's number or color ? 
 Could you give me a description of your case ? 
 I'll check it for you ... sorry to keep you waiting . I've found it.Is this yours ? 
 Will you show me your key card , please ? 
 All right . Now you can take your case away . 
 No , mom . I haven't seen it . 
 Mom , did you try the basket on your bicycle ? 
 We've changed the schedule again . I really want to meet with you , Mr . White . I just need some time to sort out my schedule . 
 I realize that . We don't have anytime to waste . I can put you down for 9 
 Can I help you find something ? 
 Is there one in particular that you like ? 
 Ah yes , that is a great refrigerator . 
 It's both affordable and it comes with all the appliances . 
 It comes with an ice maker , water dispenser , and there is a lot of room inside . 
 Be my guest . 
 Hi , is this the Bread and Cheese Deli ? 
 I need to place an order for a couple of sandwiches and drinks . Can you deliver ? 
 You look very professional in the suit . 
 I appreciate it . It is related to company image . 
 Do you have any other accounts with this bank ? 
 In that case , we will need to fill out this paperwork . Do you have identification with you ? 
 Yes . Do you know what type of checking account you would like to open , business or personal ? 
 Then you would like the ' no frills ' business account . 
 How about these famous brands ? Such as pierre Cardin ... 
 Then you can try some local products.They ' re also of good quality . 
 Well , it all looks so good . How about ordering the steamed prawns ? 
 Ok then , let ’ s get the chicken feet . 
 I ’ d prefer wine . You ? 
 Ok , a bottle of the house red please ! 
 May I see your ticket and photo ID ? 
 Are these your bags ? 
 Have you been asked to carry anything for a stranger ? 
 Have you maintained full control of your possessions while in the airport ? 
 Hi , Sarah . The results of questionnaire have come out . We need to discuss it together then write a research report . 
 30 % of the people are attracted by the style . Buyers always pay great attention to packing . In my opinion , these goods didn't sell well merely because of the poor packing . 
 Almost 30 % of the consumers can ’ t accept the price . Maybe we should lower our price a little . 
 Absolutely . 
 Oh , please sit down . What university did you graduate from ? 
 What was your major at college ? 
 Can you name some of the courses you completed in relation to accounting ? 
 What kind of work are you doing now ? 
 What are your responsibilities in your present work ? 
 Are you familiar with the PRC Financial and Tax Regulations ? 
 Can you tell me something about this balance sheet now ? 
 What's the creditor's equity ? 
 Will you tell me the situation ? 
 And then ? 
 I'm afraid you must give up the cash.Are you insured ? 
 I'll make a report for you and please claim this to the insurance company with this report . 
 No , I'm stuffed . The check , please . 
 Yes , we did . Do I pay you or the cashier ? 
 Here you are . 
 How ’ s it going ? 
 What can I help you with ? 
 What ’ s wrong with the check ? 
 How much did you write the check for ? 
 How much were you supposed to write it for ? 
 I can cancel it for you right now . 
 Excuse me , sir . I would like to buy a bag of tissue paper and shoe cream . 
 That's it . How much ? 
 Yes , sir . Most of us had positive review in last quarter . Take Fred and David for examples . Both of them try their best to achieve the best . Their progress is distinct , especially in last quarter . 
 All these say a lot for their characters . 
 Would you like a cup of coffee ? 
 I'm going to get one for myself . They make really good coffee here . 
 Excuse me . Can I get a refund of my ticket ? I have to cancel my trip because I have something emergent to deal with . 
 It is Train No . 249 . It will depart in four hours . 
 How much is the cancellation fee ? 
 Thanks . 
 That's a big order , Jane . I am really swamped . 
 Right . Okay , let me see what I can do . How about 1:30 right after my lunch meeting ? 
 My name is Alice Lin , and I need to know if some money has been transferred to my account yet . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , of course . We have day tour and night tour . Which one are you more interested in ? 
 You are smart . The city is really charming at night . 
 Hello , Debbie . This is Donald . 
 What happened yesterday ? You forgot our date , didn ’ t you ? 
 You did ? But I tried to call you at least twenty times and nobody answered . 
 What did David do yesterday ? Did he and Judy go dancing ? 
 And what did you do ? Did you play cards , too ? 
 I just told you , Debbie . I tried to call you twenty times ! 
 Yes , I was , Officer . 
 I was there as it happened . 
 The robber came in with a gun . 
 He had a mask over his face . 
 He was alone . 
 I would be happy to . 
 Don't you think it ’ s a bit bright ? 
 This dress looks lovely on you , but it ’ s not very practical , is it ? 
 I like the jeans , but you need something to go with the top . It ’ s too plain on its own . 
 That might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ? 
 Thanks . You ’ d be ok on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ? 
 That looks great . Just one more thing---you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ? 
 No , they ’ re a Prada knock-off for 1/10 of the price of the real thing . 
 If I were you , I ’ d buy that now while it ’ s on sale . If you spend $ 100 , you get a $ 50 voucher for more clothes . 
 I found it at a garage sale once . 
 Well , because I like you ... ninety bucks . 
 Sixty bucks ? No-can-do , son . You'll be lucky if I go down to eighty-five . 
 How was your test ? 
 Oh , honey , you should study harder . 
 Don't worry . You'll do better next time . 
 Your car is rather old . Why not change a new one ? 
 Oh , there is a car exhibition tomorrow afternoon . I have two tickets . Would you like to go there with me ? 
 And the bank will offer you loans for twenty years ! 
 I think working in this company could give me the best chance to use what I have learnt . As you know , I majored in computer programming in the university . I've cherished a desire to get a job where I can apply my knowledge . I know your company is one of the largest computer companies in the world , and I wish to have opportunity to develop my capabilities here . That ’ s why I applied . 
 Yes , since 1993 , I ’ Ve been employed as a clerk in the Beijing Branch of the DHAK Trading Corporation . 
 Because I would like to get a job in which I can have good opportunity for advancement , and the job was not challenging enough . 
 Yes , I applied with another company , but that was just to get experience in being interviewed . 
 This one , of course . Your company is my first choice . I want to work for you . 
 Could you drop me off at the airport ? 
 Do I need to pay any extra change for my suitcases ? 
 All right . 
 Yes . I hope you can help . I'm interested in obtaining a Working Capital Loan . So , I was wondering what you offer here ? Do you have various types ? 
 I see ... 
 To be honest , I'm not exactly sure what we require just now . 
 Yes . In 1996 I received my Bachelor of Science degree from Hebes University , and in 2001 I received my MBA degree from Peking University . 
 In fact my records were excellent . My overall GPA was 9 on a 10 scale , which was the highest in my class . 
 English . It was both interesting and useful , so I showed a great interest in it . 
 Because I am very interested in administration and I did take some courses in it . I also performed well in the subjects . Hence I believe that I can do a good job in this position . 
 Yes . I was awarded a scholarship from the university every year . In 1995 I participated in the National Contest of Maths Models and I won the prize . 
 Yes , may I ask something about the salary and benefits in your company ? 
 What is the salary while on probation ? 
 That sounds fine . 
 Are there paid holidays ? 
 Miss , the air-conditioner in my room doesn't work . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Come this way please.We ' Ve got plenty of them and they're all on the shelf near the cashier's desk . 
 You're welcome . 
 OK . 
 I don't know . Maybe it's broken . 
 I'll see if I can adjust it . 
 Why not tell the clerk and ask them to repair it . 
 Where were you last night , at exactly 920 pm ? 
 Are you sure you can't remember ? 
 Were you in or out ? Can you remember that ? 
 Did you see anyone come into the block flats ? 
 Sure ? 
 Can I help you ? 
 I recommend Pioneer . 
 This model is very popular with ladies . 
 Sure , it's multi-functional . Besides playing music , it can also be used to store documents and make recordings . 
 No , but we have it in yellow . 
 Please wait a second . I'll get it for you . 
 Good evening , may I help you ? 
 I am sorry , madam . All the tables are booked now . 
 Did you go to school today ? 
 I didn't want to , so I didn't . 
 That's a switch . 
 No , I haven't . Why ? 
 So go then . 
 Well anyway , do you plan on going to school tomorrow ? 
 I ’ m moving out . 
 I won ’ t be able to stay here anymore . 
 I don ’ t know why there ’ s a problem . 
 Why can ’ t you give it back to me ? 
 I ’ m going to need my deposit back . 
 I can ’ t stay here , though . 
 Willy , I don't think we have much butter.Can you buy some ? 
 Here's the money.And get some salt . 
 Your mp3 looks so cool . Where did you get it ? 
 Really ? Do you often shop online ? 
 I've never tried E-shopping . Is it better than shopping at an actual store ? 
 Wounds good , and I don't have to queue up at the cashier . 
 Well , are there any other advantages ? 
 Are there many choices of online shopping ? 
 Perhaps I should have a try . 
 ( while shaking hands ) I am Zhang Wei , nice to meet you , sir . 
 Thank you . Have you received my resume ? 
 Of course , here you are , sir . 
 Certainly , Mr . Smith . 
 Let me look . What do you need ? 
 I think dimes and quarters will do . 
 Oh , is there ? Which room is it ? 
 You mean the room 1818 ? 
 All right madam , I'll check and tell them to be quiet . 
 How good is your Mandarin ? 
 What dialect do you understand ? 
 Now that you have learned Kung fu for a few months , what are your general impression of it ? 
 You mean , kung fu may not be so powerful as it is imagined ? To some extent your idea holds water . Kung fu was originally intended for self-defense , but with time it became something more than defense skills . Now we are apt to treat it as an art . 
 Thanks for your compliment ! Perhaps the Chinese culture as a whole has a special inclination towards aesthetics . Do you know Jin Yong ? 
 All of his works have been translated into English . I recommend you to read one or two works of his . You'll get a general glimpse into Chinese kung fu culture . When you go through the pages , you are likely to feel they are not about kung fu alone , but cover all walks of life . 
 Yes , take philosophy , for instance . What makes a true , respectable da via , or a warrior hero ? It's not enough only to be formidable . It also involves a man's character , sense of justice , and values of life . 
 Indeed , you're exactly right ! 
 Yes , of course . When you hear the fire alarm , which is a very loud , continuous ringing noise , you should go to the nearest fire exit or fire escape as quickly as possible . 
 Yes , don't use the lifts . We have regular fire drills so you'll soon become familiar with the procedure . And always shut the fire doors to prevent the fire spreading . 
 No , I've only washed my whites . 
 Sure . Is there any extra care that I should take with your clothes ? 
 How many clothes of yours do you want me to wash ? 
 It's really only a small load . 
 Not at all . It's no problem . 
 It's no trouble at all . 
 We serve excellent Chinese food . Which style do you prefer ? 
 It's divided into 8 big cuisines such as Cantonese food , Shandong food , Sichuan food etc . 
 Yes , Cantonese food is lighter while Shandong food is heavier and spicy . 
 Most Sichuan dishes are spicy and hot . They taste differently . 
 I think Mapo bean curd and shredded meat in chili sauce are quite special and delicious . We have a Sichuan food dining room . May I suggest you to go there ? It's on the third floor . 
 It's my pleasure . 
 Do you know in which area ? 
 I see . Well , do you know anything near the hotel ? 
 Then you'll have to take a bus and get off at the Central Railway Station . 
 OK . 
 Turn right at the second crossing and then go straight for two blocks . 
 No , it ’ s only ten-minute's walk . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Yes , it does . 
 I think it leaves at two thirty . 
 Would you stay for another cup of coffee ? 
 May , I saw a beautiful cotton down coat in the shopping mail . 
 Ladies and gentlemen , now we are in the National Forest Park . 
 The stone is a prehistoric log . It was turned to stone millions of years ago . 
 But it's the truth . 
 We don't have them here , I'm afraid . Ginkgo trees grow well only in cold weather . 
 They are poplar trees . They are widely used in our lives . 
 Maybe we'd better go now . 
 Gosh , it's already 10 . Stay here if you like . 
 OK . Hurry up . 
 About 3 000 dollars . 
 I am afraid not , darling . Our expenses are mounting . 
 Don't worry . Maybe I can find a part-time job to increase my income . 
 We are sorry to bring you so much trouble . 
 Yes . That's what we want . 
 No problem . 
 Nice to meet you , Austin . 
 By the way , Richard will assist me in the planning work . I hope you can work well together . 
 Thank you.It ' s very kind of you . 
 Thank you , sir . I'll try my best to assist Richard in his work . 
 Hello , Marsha . I'm great and you ? 
 Sure , what can I do for you ? 
 So this is a real thing ? 
 When do you need it ? 
 Sure , who am I bidding against ? 
 Okay , give me a week and I'll have time to get my pencil real sharp . I should have some new figures from Malaysia by then . 
 You need all your receipts for reimbursement . 
 Yes , here is the form for an expense report . Fill it out and give it to me . I ’ ll get it signed for you . 
 It ’ s nice to go home earlier once in a while . But now it ’ s the evening rush . 
 Sure it is . I really hate to get caught in a traffic jam . 
 Yes . I'll have the fresh fruit cocktail . 
 I think I'll Ty the crisp deep-fried chicken . 
 Yes . What about you ? 
 What do you mean you already voted ? 
 Why ’ d you have to do that ? 
 Why is that ? 
 You can always go to work late . 
 Oh , I understand . 
 It is not very complicated . You can send your resume to the e-mail address of our company . 
 Our personnel clerk will screen all the resumes that we receive , select the eligible ones and arrange the interview for them . 
 What part hurts ? 
 Well , maybe you broke it . But what I'm worried about is this cut . 
 C'mon . Just don't move . 
 We don't have a decent First Aid Kit , do we ? 
 There's some tape , iodine , and cloth bandages . I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . What we need is a tourniquet . 
 Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut . 
 Alright , alright . How did you cut this so bad ? 
 What ’ s the problem ? 
 Is the pipe causing any water damage ? 
 I can come fix the pipe sometime tomorrow . 
 I don ’ t think that would be a good idea . 
 I guess you have a point . 
 Go right ahead . 
 No , you don't ! I should treat my new brother-in-law ! 
 OK , OK . On one condition . 
 You come back here with me tomorrow , and it's my treat ! 
 Tomorrow I'll take you to some places that I'm sure you will have interest in . 
 Not many but these ones . They are the Folk Antique Handicrafts and Collectibles Exhibition Halls ! 
 Well , there're actually over 200 kinds of folk collections in this city , that's half the collections of antique objects in China . There's one exhibition hall for multiple collection , and several individual display rooms for private collections . 
 No hurry ! I'll tell you now . The collections include ancient cases and caskets , tea sets , abacuses , precious sea shells and conches , jars and water abacuses for study use , drama costumes , agates , ancient coins , butterflies , fans , mini musical instruments , root-carving , rare stones and rocks , model ships , model cars . 
 Okey , Okey . We'll start from the Folk Collection Exhibition House , a multi-folk collection exhibition hall , where the best of local antique objects are on constant display . The hall itself used to be the site of a local club in the late King Dynasty , a well preserved piece of antique architecture itself . Academic research seminars and exchanges between domestic and international experts are often organized there . 
 If you have interest in butterflies , you must go to the Butterfly Exhibition . Mr . Chen , owner of the private museum , has a large collection of specimen of over 1 000 species of butterflies from more than 20 countries for public display . Quite a lot of them are state-level treasures . 
 John , why don ’ t you go and do some gardening ? The lawn needs weeding . 
 Well , don ’ t just sit there , do something . Come and help me in the kitchen . 
 Would you like to clear the table then ? 
 Not , if you don ’ t want to . 
 Yes , I want to go out . Would you like to come ? 
 Would you please put that cigarette out ? I get sick on it . 
 Thank you so much . 
 What ? 
 I ’ m sorry ? ! 
 What do you feel like having ? 
 I had pizza for lunch yesterday . 
 Do you want to get a burger ? 
 Think of something . 
 Let's do that then . 
 They sell pizza and burgers at the cafeteria . 
 Is there any particular size that you want ? 
 What do you think of this one ? It's a 16 ” pan . 
 Well , look at our aluminum pan . It's much lighter . 
 No problem . Look at this one . Same pan , but with a lightweight wooden handle . 
 I think you'll love this pan . Do you want to pay with cash ? 
 I'm sorry . I forgot to show it to you . Here it is . It comes with the pan . 
 Let me see ... Your plane leaves from gate 8 so you should go there to board the plane . 
 Take the lift over there and turn left . You won't miss it . 
 No , Dave . I haven't wrecked my jeep . I'm calling to offer you a job . 
 I'd like you to manage a new online auction site we're building . 
 Don't play hard to get . The pay is good . You'd be working with Elvin again . 
 Elvin doesn't hold a grudge , if that's what you're worried about . 
 We have lots of fresh red roses . 
 $ 20 a dozen . 
 Yes , you came here on the right day . They're on sale today . 
 Very good . Would you like anything else ? 
 She should be very pleased with these roses . 
 Yes . 
 I haven ’ t found one that satisfies my demands yet . 
 Where is the house ? 
 Really ! So it is just near my office building . Great ! How much is the rent ? 
 Does that include utilities ? 
 That ’ s a little expensive . 
 Yes . I won ’ t have to take a bus to go to my office . Is it a one-bedroom apartment ? 
 That is what I am looking for . Could I go to see the house tomorrow afternoon ? 
 All right ! Thank you . 
 Wow . It's just the two of us . I don't know if we need that much room . 
 I guess you're right . And we'd like to have company anyway . 
 Now that's a plus ! 
 We have a great selection . What decade are you looking for ? 
 We have six . 
 Actually , two of them have dancing figures . 
 A good choice . I prefer that one myself . 
 Oh , no , I'm afraid not . These things are just too old to guarantee anything . 
 Even if they break down , they're still works of art . 
 Well , I ’ Ve bought a lot of meat . I ’ Ve got pork chops , small steaks , chicken wings and plenty of hot dog sausages and hamburger patties . 
 I think so . I bought some paper plates and cups for people to use.It will save on the washing up . 
 They sell them at the shop around the corner.We can go and get some in a few minutes . 
 I have the sauce , but remind me to get some catchup at the shop . 
 It only takes a few minutes.Some people like their meat well done , others like it rare.The great thing about the barbecue is that everyone can choose how they want their meat cooked . 
 I hope you haven ’ t invited any vegetarians . 
 Sorry , Mr . Wood is not here right now . Do you have any message for him ? 
 Not at all . 
 Yes . 
 Yes . I'd like a crab cocktail . 
 Very well . 
 I want egg soup . 
 I'd like to have some meat . 
 No , thank you . 
 What is it ? 
 OK . Let me try it . 
 No , thank you 
 If they steal the entire package , that would be theft . So they don't do that . Generally , thieves open the case and take part of the contents out . Then fill the case so that the gross weight will be the same . 
 The insurance policy protects us . 
 It's absolutely true in the United States that losses from pilferage have been limited to high valued goods . We must study more about packing . 
 Thursday mornings are usually the slowest around here . Why don ’ t we set it for Thursday at 10:00 a . m . ? 
 That ’ s all right for my department . I don ’ t know how the rest of you feel . 
 You can exchange this dress with anything of the same value . 
 I'm sorry . There are no sales today . 
 Everything's going to be on sale next weekend . 
 Okay . I'll see you then . 
 I bought the MP4 in your store a week before , but it doesn't work today . 
 Yes , here you are . 
 Excuse me , What time does the next bus for Boston leave ? 
 I see . Are there any seat available ? 
 Good . How much is it when we take it ? 
 All right . Here ‘ s forty dollars . 
 Thank you . Which gate should I go to for the bus ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Telco Mobile , how can I help you ? 
 Certainly sir , we currently have a special promotion where we include voice mail services , call waiting and also three way calling . 
 Not at all . No hidden fees or surcharges , it is a flat monthly rate . 
 Yes of course . We can activate all these services in about an hour . 
 We have a copy machine in our computer lab , located on the first floor . 
 The price per copy is ten cents . 
 There shouldn't be any long lines , sir . 
 I think is looks great . I really like the light colors you have chosen . The pictures are nice too . Did you buy any new furniture ? 
 New furniture makes a room seem so fresh . I see that you also bought a new lamp for your bedside table . 
 That wardrobe looks quite big . Is it full of clothes ? 
 I like to get rid of clothes that I don ’ t wear rather than keeping them in a wardrobe . They take up too much space . There are several charity shops that you can give old clothes to . They will be happy to receive them as long as they are in reasonable condition . 
 I need to buy some new clothes for the summer too . Perhaps we can go together one day . 
 I need a snack from the cafeteria . 
 I only want some chips . 
 What do you plan on buying ? 
 What kind of candy do you want ? 
 What kind of chocolate do you want ? 
 The cafeteria doesn't sell Kit Kats . 
 ( At the MET station ) Hurry up ! We are running late for school . 
 Which line should we take if we go to Danshui ? 
 How much money should I insert in the slot ? 
 I see . 
 It's a priority seat . We can not sit there . We should give the seats to those eld , pregnant and disabled people . 
 If we go to Danshui in the morning on A weekday , we are sure to have seats since it's not during rush hour . 
 I want to have the overcoat made to measure . 
 No , I don't know which one to choose . I think maybe you can help me . 
 I will take your advice . 
 Well ... I'm pretty busy . but ... all right . come in . What can I do for you ? 
 Not at all . Take a seat . Now , what can I do for you ? 
 Yes , but why should you want to do that ? 
 Not at all . Go ahead . 
 Yes . I'd delighted if you did . 
 Yes . There are trains at 7:59 , 9:18 , and 10:32 . 
 At 9:36 . 
 There's one at 7:10 p . m . and the next one is at 7:40 p . m . 
 If you get on before 4 p . m . or after 6 p . m . , there is a saver return which is 9 pounds . An ordinary return is 16 pounds . 
 After this lunch , I haven ’ t got much green left . 
 Playing the chess is very exhausting , isn't ? 
 I'm afraid playing the chess like that will soon make me an old man . I noticed that most chess players were bald . 
 Solomon , I thought we had agreed to change this deadline . 
 I ’ ll have to think about that , Ms . Solomon . 
 Good morning , Mr.Robinson . I am afraid there is a change in today's program . I just got word that your appointment with Mr . Smith , the general manager of Western Textile Co . , Ltd . , will have to be put off . 
 Mr.Smith called just now that he had to fly to Shanghai on urgent business today . 
 Mr.Smith is sending his apologies and has asked me to find out if the day after tomorrow would be all right with you . 
 Then shall we make it nine o'clock the day after tomorrow morning ? 
 Morning . May I help you ? 
 Well , in that case , I think a checking account may be more convenient for you . However , there's a service charge . 
 One percent . 
 More than enough . Please fill in this form . 
 Your passport , please . 
 Quite often . It is very convenient , saving me a lot of time . 
 You are asking the right person . Here are two very important tips . First , you need to visit no more than one site to find the best products and prices . I can recommend you some online merchants . Second , write your mail address correctly . Otherwise , you can ’ t receive your delivery in time . 
 Not at all . You just need to provide your name , address , e-mail address , phone number and bank or credit card information . I will help you with that . 
 May I ask whether we are allowed to wear casual clothes in the office ? 
 Thank you for telling me that . 
 What are they ? I ’ ll be careful . 
 I got it . 
 I see . 
 That ’ s great to hear . 
 For each month you would have to pay $ 1050 . 
 I don ’ t think that is too much for rent . 
 That ’ s not enough . 
 $ 850 a month is not enough money . 
 That ’ s my final offer . Take it or leave it . 
 Hello , Marry , this is Lin Wang , calling from network . 
 May i speak to David please ? 
 Oh , sorry , David Richton . 
 Thank you . 
 From the looks of this house from the outside , I don ’ t really think that I want to go inside . 
 I am not impressed by the interior of this house . 
 With so few windows , how can you even see what the problems are ? 
 Where are you supposed to store things without any cabinet space ? 
 Is there a dead animal somewhere in here ? 
 Dad , can you help me ? 
 I don't know how to do it . 
 16 divided by 2 . What's the answer ? 
 You got it . Good job . 
 Yes , we're ready to start the invitation to tender . You're well informed . We'd like to build new factory . 
 We intend to open the tender at first next month in Beijing . 
 The time period is set on June 29th . 
 All right . The area of the factory buildings is around 8,000 square meters . You can read the details in the invitations which will be sent tomorrow . 
 You're welcome . 
 It doesn't matter . We'll be in touch . 
 Bye ! 
 No problem at all ! I am taking a long road trip and I want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition . 
 Not that long ago , I think it was four months ago . 
 Why ? I mean , what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ? 
 I see . What else ? 
 Ok , well , when you put it that way , it doesn ’ t seem like a waste of time and money . 
 Hi Kara , this is Mike . 
 Great , how are you ? 
 Kara , I had a great time the other night and was wondering if you would like to go out again this weekend . 
 Maybe I could help you with what you need to get done . 
 May I try on this pair of shoes ? 
 I think it's 35 . 
 Hmm , I don't feel very comfortable . 
 This is just right for me . I'll take this one . 
 Well , the first lunar month is called Yuan-month , and in ancient times people called night Miao . And you know the festival is just in the middle of the month . 
 Sure . It ’ s indeed a culinary heaven which offers a wide range of delicious snacks to satisfy all tastes . Then , which one would you like ? 
 OK . Let ’ s go over there . For the Lantern Festival , you should never omit the Yuanxiao . 
 Actually , they are small dumpling balls made of glutinous rice flour . They are like Tangun . 
 Yes . And also , we can find Yuanxiao with both sweet and salty fillings . 
 Oh , the smelly bean curd . My favorite ! 
 It ’ s hard to believer you ’ re really retiring . What are you going to do with yourself ? 
 Well , good luck . Give me a ring sometime , and let me know how you are . 
 I'm sorry , but everything is taken . 
 Yes , I can give you a reservation on that . 
 You ’ re right . 
 I should have turned it off . I ’ ll turn it off now . 
 I ’ m sorry , Jim . 
 Richard ? Do you have the number for that Chinese restaurant on the corner ? 
 553-2213 . Great , thanks . 
 I don't know how to adjust my life . Would you give me a piece of advice ? 
 Yes , I can't sleep well every night . 
 I drink a lot of wine . 
 I often feel so tired . 
 I sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me . 
 Welcome to our show ! Today , I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich ! Are you ready ? Let ’ s get started ! 
 Now that our bread is ready , let ’ s talk about the ingredients ! Of course , each person ’ s palate is different , but I ’ m going to give you a few tips that you ’ ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich . I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich . 
 Last but not least , we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich . We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper , or we can combine mustard sauce , mayonnaise , ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor ! It ’ s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt ! 
 Can you tell me where the supply shop is ? 
 Great ! Thanks a lot ! 
 What's the postage on these letters to hongkong , please ? 
 Yes . Five one-dollar stamps , please . 
 Good morning , sir . Can I see your boarding pass , please ? 
 Excuse me , sir . This is your passport . 
 Yes . As a matter of fact , you can't board the plane without boarding pass . 
 I'm sorry sir . I can't let you pass . 
 Ugh , in about thirty minutes , sir . 
 Calm down , sir . You are creating a commotion . 
 Could be . 
 ( Benjamin starts to run and then he seems to remember something and returns . ) Ugh , excuse me , where is the Lost and Found ? 
 Thank you , thank you , thanks again . 
 Nope . Our company is private-owned and its profit is the biggest issue . We don't think that further study has anything to do with our development and profit-making . 
 Nope . We just hope our employees will make profit for us . 
 Yeah , I ’ Ve been working so much overtime lately . 
 My boss gave me a big project . I had to have it finished it by this morning . It was so difficult ! 
 I know . But hard work pays off , you know . 
 Maybe now I ’ ll get that promotion I was hoping for . 
 Well , you can take the No . 36 bus from here , but then you have to walk about 30 minutes . 
 Actually , if you go to the bus stop in the next block , you can take bus 301 which will let you right off in front of the zoo . 
 You're welcome . 
 That's all right.We ' ll get used to it.Besides , it is quiet up there.We ' re little further away from the street and traffic noise and there's no one living over us . 
 Yes , it's pretty bright in there and big enough for our children to play . 
 The stove and refrigerator are in good working order , and I don't see any loose electric wiring that could cause fires . 
 The plumbing seems OK , too.The toilet flushes and the shower has hot and cold water , and the sinks don't seem to leak . 
 Hello , what can I do for you today ? 
 I see . Well , with those symptoms maybe you ’ Ve got food poisoning . What have you eaten recently ? 
 Hmm . It may be those then , especially if they were raw . Well , I ’ ll give you these tablets and you should feel fine by tomorrow . 
 Hi Kara , it's Mike here . 
 I'm doing well , and you ? 
 Kara , would you be interested in going to dinner again this Friday ? 
 Well , we could just go out as friends . 
 Can I go to my room now ? 
 Thank you . 
 Of course . How can I help you ? 
 What size do you wear ? 
 Here . How do you like this one ? 
 You can try it on in the fitting room over there . 
 I see , sir . Those two ladies in front of your room did the same thing twenty minutes ago . 
 I am afraid we have no extra key . So I will send somebody to your room . 
 Please drop it at the front desk when you leave the hotel . 
 Yes . My name's Mark Benson . I just started a couple weeks ago . 
 Thanks , I appreciate that ! 
 I want it the way Peckham wears it . 
 Are you kidding me ? Even the girls know Peckham . Whatever , I have a picture of him here . 
 Sure , he is a soccer star . 
 Oh , my God . It's disaster . It makes my head look like a soccer ball . 
 It looks like the hairstyle of Kahn who stands beside him in the picture . 
 He plays outside right but it doesn't mean he has to stand on the right . 
 Do it , please . 
 Where did he go ? 
 Like me ? But you see I am so successful now . And if he is really like me , he will be more successful than me in the future . 
 Pay him ? But he studies for himself , not for you or for me or for anybody else . I got an idea . You should send him to class every morning and after the class begins , you can go to work . 
 That's a good idea . Why have I never thought of that ? 
 I can ’ t make out anything , the words are too light . I thought they have already changed the toner cartridge this month . 
 Do you know how to do it ? I am not so good at machine things . I will have somebody do it as soon as possible . 
 Excuse me , I'm looking for your English textbooks . 
 Do you have any textbooks to help improve students ' reading skills ? 
 Great . That ' s just the sort of thing I'm looking for . Thanks . 
 Please wait till your name is called . OK . Your bill includes the doctor's fee and the cost for a 3 - day supply of medicine . It comes to one hundred yuan . 
 Good . Here is the receipt . The dispensary is over there ... By the way , will this be covered by your insurance from work ? 
 In that case , I'll give you a certificate , so you can get it reimbursed . 
 Don't lose this receipt , because insurance companies are very difficult about helping when they don't have the right paperwork . 
 Yes , what's wrong ? 
 Today is September 28th , 2007 . 
 When will it begin ? 
 It is half past one . 
 Don't worry , time is enough . 
 Glad to meet you again , Mrs Hao . You are so kind . 
 Oh , it's a real Chinese meal . When in Rome , do as the Romans do . I'd take the chopsticks . 
 Beer , please . Oh , there are so many dishes . 
 Let's hope for good cooperation between us . 
 All right . I'm nearly ready.What time does the bus leave ? 
 Oh , we've got plenty of time . 
 All right.Let ' s go . 
 Good ! There's the information desk . How do we get to the 70th Street , please ? 
 How much is it ? 
 Which way do we go for the Northern Line ? 
 I appreciate it . Thank you . 
 are your ready to go to the supermarket ? 
 I've got my money and my keys , so I'm ready . 
 it wasn't cold out this morning . 
 well , I guess we'd better grab our umbrellas then , as well . 
 it does , actually . Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping . 
 ok . I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . It's a bit chilly in here . 
 I don't know . The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night . 
 I don't think we have anything to worry about . Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ? 
 if I'm not back in ten minutes , come and find me . 
 Front Desk . What can I do for you ? 
 What time do you want us to wake you up ? 
 OK . I've set it up for you . 
 Why don ’ t you introduce him ? I wonder if we will become good friends . 
 Here we come . 
 $ 10 . 
 Well , the rate is two dollars for the first two kilometers and twenty cents for each additional two hundred meters . 
 I need to make a copy of a document as soon as possible . 
 Very good . How much does each copy cost ? 
 A dime ? I remember when copies used to cost a nickel . 
 I can ’ t find my purse . Have you seen it ? 
 I ’ Ve looked everywhere for it . I must have left it somewhere . I hope I haven ’ t lost it . 
 No , I had it when I left school this afternoon . 
 Yes , I ’ d better give her a call now . 
 Perhaps I should call her later . 
 You've come to the right place . We've got various styles and sizes recently . How much do you measure around your waist ? 
 OK ! 2 Chi round . Try this one . Maybe it's of your size . 
 Let me check the stock . How about this one ? 
 150 Yuan . 
 Here's your change , 50 Yuan . Welcome back again . 
 I'm not sure , but let me check my schedule ... Ah , no . I have nothing then . 
 How nice of him ! I'll be delighted to go . But what time would be convenient ? 
 That's good . It's most thoughtful of you to do this , Miss Wood . 
 How beautiful the flower is ! 
 You like it . Well , I'll gather it for you . 
 Where is it ? 
 Mom , can I watch TV ? 
 Alright , Mom . Should I turn off the TV right now ? 
 Mom , where is the remote ? I can't find it . 
 I think you should look over these figures again . There are some calculations that are a bit off . 
 Apology is accepted . Try to do better next time . 
 Good afternoon , sir . Can I help you ? 
 What flavor would you prefer , sir ? 
 We have strawberry , chocolate , vanilla and banana . 
 Anything else , sir ? 
 May I help you find something , sir ? 
 We have all shapes , sizes , qualities and price ranges , do you know about the four Cs of picking a diamond ? 
 You've got it . Tell me a little bit about what you might be wanted . 
 You have good taste . Let my show you what I have . 
 Yes , thank you . I am really far behind on this project . Could you help me with the extra typing or xeroxing ? 
 Good . That would be very helpful . Can you start with those pages over there ? 
 Thank you very much ! How long have you been working here ? 
 Well , we have some special projects coming up . Would you be interested in working on any of those ? 
 Well then , I'll keep you in the loop . Thank you for your help today . 
 What about the twill ? It washes well and won't lose shape . 
 Well , it's cheap and actually the color fades easily when washed . 
 What's so great about it ? 
 Not to me , I wouldn't be caught dead in that . 
 Yeah , you seem to like those styles . 
 This one looks really expensive though . 
 Lucky you ! I can't buy anything else . I'm flat broke . 
 Why did you drag me into this ? I've spent a week salary . 
 Just joking , T . I've got some wonderful clothes . Let's go and have a close look at your outfit . 
 Yes , we charge 50 cents for water . 
 Sure . Do you need anything else ? 
 I'll put all that into the bag for you . 
 No , there is no charge for those . 
 Do you want to live here ? 
 The more you work , the more you earn . 
 En , I am looking for the shop . Can you tell me where it is ? 
 Thank you . Do I have to pay duty if I want to buy something ? 
 Thank you so much . 
 Sure . I have it right here . 232-2453 . If that one doesn ’ t work , try 232-2456 . 
 That ’ s right . 
 Here you are . 
 Ok . But is there anything wrong ? 
 I've got 6 packets of cigarettes and 2 bottles of champagne . Besides , I have two cameras , one is for my own use , and the other is a gift . 
 Ok . Where shall I pay duty for it ? 
 I've paid for it . Here's the receipt . 
 Thank you . 
 I want to draw some money from my current account . 
 Well , I want to draw out 4,000 yuan . 
 Yes ! Here is my bankbook . 
 Yes . Do I need to sign my name here ? 
 Well , I want 1,000 yuan in traveler's checks and the rest in cash . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 Can I have your key and room number , PLS ? 
 Here is your bill , sir . Could you PLS check it ? 
 Here you are , sir . You are all set . I hope you enjoyed your stay and that next time you are in town , you will stay with us again . 
 The bell captain will put it in storage room . When you are ready to leave , you can claim your luggage from him . 
 This is the rush hour . 
 Let's drive off this road . 
 Good morning , sir . Can I help you ? 
 Could I have your name and room number ? 
 Please wait a moment , Mr . Black . I'll have to check the reservation records ... I'm sorry , but we are expecting several tour groups to arrive today . They have booked all the rooms on the 10th floor . 
 If you don't mind transferring to another room , we may manage it for you . We usually have cancellations or no-shows . 
 It's my pleasure . 
 For what time , sir ? 
 May I have your name please , sir ? 
 Mr . Fox , we'll hold the table for you for ten minutes . Please be sure to arrive before 8: 40 . 
 Yes , what kind of apartment are you interested in ? 
 Yes , I have one . When you need it ? 
 Well , It's a one-bedroom apartment . The monthly rent at 650 dollars and a 300 dollars security deposit . You pay electricity only . Gas and water is included . Both the heat and stove are gas . Let me see , what else ... Oh , you'll be assigned a sheltered parking space at no extra charge . And that's probably it . 
 Sure . What time would you like to come ? 
 Good , May I have your name , please ? 
 Thanks for calling , Blanca . I'll see you tomorrow . 
 cool down , Harry ! What are you really mad about ? Did you get ripped off ? 
 is that so ? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . It's the norm of free trade . The seller sets 
 of course , that's something really irritation . And the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . I recommend you to consult the price tags in the superb 
 Forgive you for what ? 
 No ! Are you kidding me ? 
 I can ’ t believe it ! I have all my important personal documents stored in that computer . It ’ s no laughing matter . 
 Well , you should be sorry ! Don ’ t ever use my computer again ! You can ’ t do anything now , it ’ s too late ! 
 Well , our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . I'm afraid it's very difficult to improve any further on the time . 
 We check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . As new orders keep coming in , they are working three shifts to step up production . I'm sorry , but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill . 
 I said by the middle of October . This is the best we can promise . 
 Good . Let's call it a deal . We'll do our best to advance the shipment to September . The chances are that some of the other orders may be cancelled . But of course you cannot count on that . In any case , we'll let you know by email . 
 We generally insure W . P . ( W . P . A ) on a C . I . F . offer . Special risks , such as TEND ( Theft , Pilferage and Non-delivery ) , leakage , breakage , oil , freshwater , etc . can also be covered upon request . 
 Quite right . According to the usual practice in international trade , special risks are not covered unless the buyer asks for them . 
 Yes , we accept it now , after it has been suspended for many years . However , if you want to have it covered for your imports at your end , you may arrange the insurance as you like . 
 All right , I'll adjust the price accordingly . 
 As a rule , we don't allow any discount . 
 That's true . But I am sorry I can't make an exception . We have quoted you our lowest price . We can't give you any more discounts . 
 I want to show my gratitude for your hospitality . And I believe me trip here will be meaningful and our cooperation will go deeper and stabler in near future . Through the communication , we can know more about each other . Thank you so much for your consideration . 
 May I have your resume , please ? 
 Do you like a job in a library , working with books ? 
 Hi ! Can I help you ? 
 What's your name , sir ? 
 Yes , sir . We have your reservation . Could you fill out these forms , please ? 
 Yes , sir . That's correct . How will you pay your bill , cash or credit card ? 
 Thank you , sir . You'll be staying in room 1910 . Here are your keys . The bellhop will take your luggage upstairs . Have a nice stay , sir . 
 Which window do I go to for parcel ? 
 I want to mail this package . 
 Zhuhai . 
 What's the difference in price ? 
 How long will it take by air ? 
 Then I will send it by air , thank you . 
 Just some souvenirs . 
 Thank you . 
 Hi , I saw the sign outside says that you do all kinds of interior design . 
 Well , I am thinking about redesigning my kitchen . 
 Yes , I prefer a more contemporary design . 
 Blue , green or earth tone colors . I do not like the colors that are too bright . 
 I'd like it to look simple , neat and relaxing . 
 No problem . How about 10 ' o clock this Sunday morning ? 
 Of course . This is my card . See you then . 
 It is because Montreal is a bilingual city . 
 But it's a good opportunity to learn French . 
 Take it easy . I have the confidence to learn it well . 
 Very well , thank you . 
 Here you go . We have your cocktail and there're salad . fried chicken , French fries and vanilla ice cream for dessert . Eat the chicken while it's hot . It tastes better . 
 Here you are . Taste the French fries . 
 Would you like some more ? 
 Here's to our friendship and health ! 
 The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here ! 
 That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying ! 
 I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him . 
 John , I'm hard up at the moment . Could you lend me five hundred yuan ? I'll return it to you early next month . 
 Yes . Thank you so much . 
 Give me a six-piece chicken nuggets , a large fry and a large Coke . 
 That's fine . 
 Here's a twenty note . 
 Thanks . 
 Hi , good evening . Which kind of beer would you like ? 
 How about Yanking Beer ? It's very popular here . 
 Have you ever been shopping at Whole Foods ? 
 They have the freshest foods there . 
 I used to shop there , but I find the food at Whole Foods to be a lot better . 
 They don't have a lot of organic foods there . 
 They have lots of healthier food at Whole Foods . 
 Whole Foods is way better than Sons , trust me . 
 What's wrong with you , young man ? 
 Do you have a fever ? 
 Let me examine you . Don't worry . It's nothing serious . 
 Yes , stay in bed and drink a lot of water . Your fever will be gone in a day or two . 
 Of course not . You need a good rest . 
 Hello . This is Bell Canada . How can I help you ? 
 Okay . What day would you want your home phone cancelled ? 
 All right . I ’ ll do it for you by then . Anything else ? 
 Bye . 
 May I have the menu , please ? 
 I'd like to have some local specialties . Would you recommend for me , please ? 
 OK . We'll take it . 
 A fried crisp chicken and an eggplant with chili sauce . 
 Coffee , only black coffee , 
 Well , Mr . Parsons , as I mentioned before I ’ m someone who needs new challenges . I ’ m really focused and hard-working . I think my academic results prove this . 
 Well , I believe I ’ m a good team-player , but I can also work well independently . I ’ m very enthusiastic and , well I hope my colleagues would agree , I ’ m fun to work with . 
 Hmm , that ’ s a tough question . But I would have to say my passion . I ’ m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career . 
 Yes , I wanna buy a skirt . 
 I am not sure . 
 Ok , thank you . 
 I have a little problem with room 507 . 
 I found cockroaches in my room . 
 I've seen at least nine different cockroaches in my room . 
 There are nine cockroaches in my room . I don't have time for your disbelief ! 
 You don ’ t look so good . 
 Did you eat something strange ? 
 Maybe you have food poisoning . 
 Are you under a lot of stress ? 
 Maybe you have a touch of the flu . 
 Excuse me ! Do you know of any hotel nearby ? 
 OK , I see . Thank you ! 
 I see , thank you very much ! 
 Yes , my brakes are not working well . 
 I hear a noise and feel vibrations when step on the brake . 
 I think so . 
 Toyota Corolla 2002 . 
 Do you charge for checking it out ? 
 How long is it going to take ? 
 I'll wait . 
 I ’ m sorry sir . This computer is not broken or damaged . It ’ s simply just too old ! That ’ s why your programs and applications are running slow . There really isn ’ t much I can do . 
 Yes , but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster ! 
 Well , this desktop over here is our latest model . It has a four gigahertz processor with sixteen gigabytes in RAM and a hard disk with one terabyte . Of course , it includes a mouse , keyboard and desk speakers . 
 This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze ! If it does , we ’ ll give you your money back ! 
 Nope . How's the food there ? 
 I do my shopping at Sons . 
 What's wrong with Sons ? 
 Whole Foods has a lot of organic foods ? 
 I've never been , but I may start shopping there . 
 Thanks for letting me know . 
 Of course , where do you want me to stand ? 
 I'm glad you're replacing it . We need more space to work on things . How deep will the new workbench be ? 
 Well , it's about 65 cm at the moment . Could we increase it by about a third ? 
 Good afternoon . Is there a vacant room here ? 
 A single , preferably with a bath . 
 For four days or so . 
 I hope it's quiet . I hate noise . 
 How much does it cost per day ? 
 All right . I'll take the room . 
 OK . 
 No problem . Here you are . 
 Good morning . Can I help you ? 
 Just a moment , please . I'm sorry , sir . There is no ticket available on that day . But we have flights for Guangzhou the next day . 
 A 9:12 flight in the morning and a 14:00 flight in the afternoon . 
 At 13:15 . 
 All right , sir . Please reconfirm your ticket no later than 12 o'clock two days before the flight ; otherwise , your reservation will automatically be cancelled . 
 We have two direct flights . Would you like a morning one or an afternoon one ? 
 Single or return ? 
 Why aren't you going out ? 
 so , what ’ s new in the kitchen ? That refrigerator is new , isn ’ t it ? 
 That ’ s usual nowadays . You ’ Ve added a few shelves too . 
 Did you buy new cupboards too ? 
 I see that you have bought several new pots and pans and utensils . 
 Didn ’ t you punch in this morning , Monica ? 
 That ’ s ok . I should have told you earlier . This is a company rule . 
 According to the company rule , we should punch in before 8 o ’ clock and punch out after 5 o ’ clock every work day . 
 From eleven thirty to 1 o ’ clock . 
 Sometimes , but not quite often . 
 It's $ 1.25 for this bus . 
 I started driving the bus a few months ago . 
 Not at all . 
 I never did either , but it pays the bills . 
 I liked talking to you too . 
 I'd like to have lunch in my room . 
 What does a Chinese food have ? 
 That will be fine . I'll take it . 
 Sure , it's White in Room 204 . 
 Exactly . 
 Say , Jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ? 
 What do you mean ? It will help us to relax . 
 I guess you are right . But what shall we do ? I don't feel like sitting at home . 
 That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play singsong . Perhaps we can make a foursome with them . 
 Good . Let's go now . 
 wow , the duck looks so delicious . Should we order it , Rick ? 
 I see . The chef is so skillful with his knife . 
 incredible . By the way , what are these in the plates ? 
 thank you . I couldn't wait any longer to have a taste . 
 oh , it's terrific . I love the floor . Can you tell me how it was prepared ? 
 it sounds really complicated . No wonder it tastes so great . 
 May I see your airplane ticket , passport and health certificate please ? 
 Will you please put your luggage on the scale ? 
 Sir , your bags are 30 pounds over weight.You are allowed only 45 pounds of baggage . 
 That comes to H . K . $ 120 . 
 I see . 
 Okay . 
 I'm sorry , madam , there ’ s a limit to the speed . 
 I'm sorry about that . What ’ s your flight time ? 
 Don ’ t worry , madam . I guess we should get there not later than 1:30 p . m . 
 Here we are . 
 Just a minute . Here's your change . 
 It's hard to say . But why ? 
 I can understand your position . We can not make any promise , but we'll try our best . 
 My first job was in a well-established company where the division of labour was very clear . I do not have more chances to enrich my experience . Then I got an opportunity to really broaden my experience with a new company that was starting up , but unfortunately , they closed their service in three months ' time . I have worked in my present company for a considerable length of time and enjoy the job I am doing now , but I think I have accumulated enough experience to take up more challenging post in a much larger and diversified company where I could make solid contribution . 
 Yes , sir . What's the matter ? 
 Well , we are rather full , sir . I'm not sure if I'll be able to find a vacant room . 
 OK , sir . I'll do my best . 
 I haven ’ t played softball since I was in high school ! 
 Okay . I guess I could give it a try . 
 What's the price of the bread ? 
 And how much is the coca cola ? 
 Here is ten Yuan . 
 Thank you . 
 Good evening , do you have a reservation ? 
 Let me see . Ok , this way , please . 
 And would you like to order now ? 
 Here is the menu . 
 Hello miss . Can I see your ticket number ? 
 Thank you miss ... Wang . I'm Bob Jones and I'll be handling your application . 
 The first step is to determine your eligibility for a U . S . visa . Let's see here ... you're applying for a special business visa . Why is that ? 
 I think a regular visitor's visa should suffice . With this visa , you can stay in the United States for up to 90 days . 
 Yes . You are free to do temporary business with this visa . If you were planning on setting up a new business in the U . S . you might need to apply for a long-term visa . 
 Are you leaving ? 
 You have a job ? 
 You ’ re working there this year ? 
 How are you able to work at the polling place ? 
 Sounds like fun . 
 They don ’ t pay a lot , do they ? 
 How many rooms are you looking for ? 
 150 a month . 
 Rents are very high in downtown area . 
 I cut it on that blade . 
 Hey , man , look , what's on the wall over there ? 
 What does it say ? 
 I can smoke outside of the office . But what else does it say ? 
 But if there is an emergency and the manager is of absence , what should we do ? 
 OK , OK , got it . By the way , what about the vacation policy ? Anything changed ? 
 Can we have 7 - day holiday on National Day ? 
 That's great ! 
 Are you kidding ? I always get up late . Oh , my God . Can't believe that . That is terrible . 
 Excuse me , may I help you ? 
 Sure , Please wait a moment . 
 No problem . 
 Park in the visitors ' car park in front of the factory and then go to the gatehouse . It's directly opposite the entrance to the car park . The Security people will sign you in and give you a visitor's badge . My assistant will come down to meet you . 
 What can I get for you today , sir ? 
 Would you like anything else with that ? 
 Our pie is brought in fresh every day . And I can tell you it's delicious . 
 Is this to stay or to go ? 
 When can I see the one-bedroom apartment ? 
 What time does the open house start ? 
 Good afternoon , is there a vacant room here ? 
 A single room , preferably with a bath . 
 For a week or so . 
 I hope it's quiet . I hate noise at night . 
 What is the rate , please ? 
 What services come with that ? 
 That sounds good . Well , do you give discount for a week or more ? 
 All right . I will take a room for a week . 
 Can I get dinner here ? 
 I see . 
 We ’ re on our own tonight , dad ’ s taking mom out . 
 You know on a date , they are going out to dinner . 
 Yeah , they said they ’ re reviving the old tradition . 
 That ’ s right , once a week . Do you want to order some pizza ? 
 Here you are . 
 Just this one . 
 Aisle , please . 
 What ’ s the gate number ? 
 I was told to come to you to get a chest X-ray . 
 Then what should I do ? 
 Should I just stand naturally ? 
 Is this all right ? 
 Where will you be going ? 
 Is that it ? 
 Hey Eve , how are you ? 
 I ’ m ok . I ’ m so busy ! 
 Yes . Don ’ t you ? 
 Which class are you working on right now ? 
 Are you in Mrs . Green ’ s class ? 
 Yes . We must have the same exam tomorrow ! 
 Sure . This library is too quiet though . 
 That sounds good . 
 John , why don ’ t you go and do some gardening ? The lawn needs weeding . 
 Well , don ’ t just sit there , do something . Come and help me in the kitchen . 
 Would you like to clear the table then ? 
 Not , if you don ’ t want to . 
 What a girly drink . I'll take a bag of the Blue Mountain and a decaf breva ... 
 Isn't “ frappuccino ” Italian , too ? ... and heat me up a panini . 
 And I'll stick with real coffee . 
 Quite well.thank you.And what about you ? 
 Excuse me , will you change me some money , please ? 
 I'd like to change these dollars into RIB . Would you please tell me the exchange rate between American dollar and RIB ? 
 500 dollars , please . 
 OK . Thank you for your help . That's very nice of you . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Yes , it is . 
 Sure . The local train . It stops at every station . 
 You take the D train on the downtown platform , and go three stops . 
 One dollar and twenty cents . You give me the money and I ’ ll exchange it for a token . 
 You put it in the slot at the turnstile and then push the turnstile to get into the platform . 
 It is a bit of a fixer-upper . Let ’ s take a look inside . 
 You know , with a little elbow grease and paint , you could spruce it up a bit . 
 Let ’ s go check out the kitchen . The printout says that it is quite large . 
 Maybe the master suite has some redeeming qualities . Follow me , please . 
 Perhaps we should move on to the next listing . 
 Well . You're the tour guide , I'll follow you . 
 That's sulphur you can smell . The whole of Taiwan is a volcanic region . That's why Taiwan has so many hot springs . It's volcanic activity.The sulfur smoke that you can smell is coming from those fumaroles over there . 
 Mr . Division , I am so sorry to have kept you waiting . 
 Oh dear , I forgot to bring it . 
 What price do you suggest for 300,000 sets of Article No . 2323 with London as the destination port ? 
 What commission terms can you offer ? 
 Couldn't you raise the commission to five percent ? 
 Then I'll accept it with thanks . 
 Yeah , yeah , we ’ re here because we feel this is an injustice ! The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop ! We ’ re there to show the government that we don ’ t like the way that they ’ re spending our tax dollars ! 
 It ’ s an absolute outrage , Sarah , the US government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers ’ money to the auto industry . These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt . 
 That maybe true , and I for one don ’ t want to see anyone lose their job , but how can these Ces ask for a bailout when they ’ re making millions of dollars ? And then , they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets ! This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars ! And they ’ re asking for money ! That is just not right ! 
 Passport and disembarkation card , please . 
 What is your purpose of visiting ? 
 How long are you staying here ? 
 All right . Thank you . 
 Yeah , Please do . Now let me show you the house . 
 You bet . This is the nicest room in the district . You know what , I just had all the walls repainted last month . 
 It's a well furnished eat-in kitchen . The stove and the ice-box are in good order , and the plumbing is OK , too . 
 Terrific ! When are you moving in ? 
 What's happening , officer ? 
 What ? A fire ? Oh , my God ! What shall I do ? Please get me out of here ! 
 I can smell smoke ! 
 OK . 
 Sir , I need to go back to get my jewelry box . 
 Gosh ! I can see the flames ! 
 I wonder what we should have for dinner this evening ? 
 Yes , I am . I really don ’ t feel much like cooking but the family must eat . 
 So I've noticed . You are putting on a little weight , aren ’ t you ? 
 It ’ s about time . 
 I was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! Can you come here for a sec ? I need your help . 
 I don ’ t know what to wear ! Ok , give me your opinion . Do you like the way this looks ? The striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . I like the cut and hemline of these shorts so I think I ’ ll wear these as well . 
 Thanks honey ! You have such great fashion sense . Now , what am I going to do with my hair ? 
 It comes to $ 40 . 
 Of course . I will find you one . 
 Mm , I just need something about business news.Can you recommend some ? 
 Thank you . I'll have one . 
 It's in aisle A . 
 I don't know . Check the flyer or check with the produce person . 
 My chicken tastes all right , but it is pretty dry . How is your fish ? 
 It's almost as if this food has been sitting a little too long . It doesn't seem fresh . 
 How are your vegetables ? 
 Mine are the same way . It seems like they've been overcooked . 
 I agree . Maybe they can bring us some better food . 
 I need to see your ID . 
 You need to give me your ID and $ 27 . 
 Go get it . 
 All right , I'm going to need you to fill this out . 
 Here's a pen for you . 
 You need to turn that in at Window B . 
 I didn't mean to . It was an accident . 
 I did not . It looks perfectly fine . 
 What did I do to it ? 
 I really don't think that I did that . 
 Look , just give me your insurance and number and I'll take care of it . 
 Trust me . 
 Yeah , I went to school today . Were you there ? 
 That sucks . Did you want the assignments from English class ? 
 No problem , you're welcome . 
 Well , thank you . I hope to see you at school tomorrow . 
 My hair is kind of dry and brittle ... 
 No , it's just perfect . 
 No , really , it feels great . 
 Is there a medication you can prescribe to help me with my problem ? 
 What is available ? 
 Are there many side effects ? 
 Is that the only medication I need to take ? 
 What are the side effects of that drug ? 
 I wonder if you can help me . I'm looking for a room . 
 How much is it ? 
 OK . Can I see the room now ? 
 Have you met the new girl ? 
 She's one of the prettiest girls at the school . 
 Well , she's quite short . 
 I would say she's only 5 feet . 
 She has light brown eyes , absolutely beautiful . 
 Have you seen her ? 
 Did you need help with something ? 
 Do you have a problem with your account ? 
 What are you going to do about the money in your account ? 
 I ’ ll do that for you . 
 Would you like to withdraw any money ? 
 It ’ ll just take me a moment to cancel your account . 
 Hi , welcome to the Belt Department . Can I help you today ? 
 Then , perhaps a leather belt would work . Come here . Let me show you some . 
 Excuse me . I think I have got lost in the Art Gallery . Can you tell me the way to the exit . 
 Thank you very much . I have been wondering here for almost half an hour . 
 Excuse me , waiter . Could we change our table for that one ? My wife is quite interested in the scenery . 
 It doesn't matter . This one is fine . 
 Where to , sir ? 
 Please hop in . 
 It ’ ll take about 20 minutes . 
 Yes , they are . 
 Yes , it is . Are you in a hurry , sir ? 
 Yes , sir . 
 The cereal is over by the breakfast foods . 
 It's by the oatmeal and breakfast bars . 
 Did you need help finding anything else ? 
 That would be over by the paper towels and toilet paper . 
 Yeah , you'll find it there . 
 Hi , Mr . James , what ’ s the rush ? 
 I can lend you some money . 
 Can I help you in anyway ? 
 Sure . Let ’ s go . 
 Why ? You said I was hot when smoking . 
 Smoking is killing . I know . 
 I don ’ t believe it . 
 Of course I know it , but you know it's hard to quit smoking ... 
 Yes , ma'am . Whatever you say . 
 Oh , my God ! It ’ s my stomach . It ’ s killing me ! 
 Right here ! It hurts right here ! 
 I felt OK when I woke up , and then , suddenly , I had this really sharp pain . 
 No , and I haven ’ t done anything out of the ordinary . 
 Thank you for helping me . 
 Well , I just want to enjoy what I ’ m doing . it ’ s the most important thing to me . 
 Yes , because I think being interesting thing is the best teacher . Or have more opportunities to have career growth . 
 Yes , of course . 
 In five years , I ’ d like to be a senior manager of this corporation . 
 By doing whatever is necessary . 
 Good morning ! I'm Steven Smith . I want to open an account here . 
 Thank you very much ! And then what ? 
 OK ! Thank you . 
 Is everything OK , Madam ? 
 I can help you with that . Holiday , you say ? Lucky you ! Where are you going to be travelling to ? 
 That is one option , Madam . If your are travelling to either Hong Kong or Macau we are permitted to exchange up to 1,000 USD for you . 
 Today's rate is 823 . 71 RIB to 100 USD . 
 Yes , it's not bad . I will need to see your passport though . 
 Yes , I'd like to make a reservation for eight tonight . 
 At 7:30 pm . And I would like to sit in the non-smoking area . 
 The private room , please . 
 It will be for business dinner . Reserve it under the name of Nova , the manager of Fashion Clothes Company . 
 Hello . May I speak to Brian , please ? 
 Is this 777-9345 ? 
 Oh , I ’ m so sorry . 
 Excuse me , can you tell me the way to the Forbidden City , please ? 
 Thanks . 
 I went to visit a customer in IVS Company the other day . Their offices were very impressive , especially their company Logo which is all over the place . There are Logo models in metal , copper , clove , paper . They are even printed on the wall paper and the balls of the table-lights . It is really decorated identity . 
 Not at all ! I like the design so much . The designer must have thought really hard to come out with such a brilliant concept . 
 What would you like for dessert ? 
 I have apple pie , ice cream , chocolate cake and fruit cocktail . 
 Of course . I made apple pie this morning , so it ’ s lovely and fresh . 
 Sure . Can you get it yourself ? It ’ s in the refrigerator . 
 Yes . I ’ ll have an ice tea . You ’ ll see it next to the lemonade . 
 I ’ ll have apple pie too , but without ice cream . I have to watch my weight . 
 Yes , surely . 
 No , you don't . It is free of charge . 
 Yes , certainly.Would you wait for a few minutes ? 
 Yes , what is it ? 
 Sure . I'll be back in a minute . 
 Can you describe the plumbing problems you are having ? 
 Okay , the bathroom plumbing needs looking at . What about the kitchen plumbing ? 
 Has this problem been going on for a long time ? 
 I will be coming over to look at it this afternoon . Will you be there ? 
 I can always use my key to get in , but I would prefer that you be there . 
 You have found your way to the interview class . Please come in ! 
 When we go into an interview , what do you think our first consideration should be ? 
 Friendliness and a good attitude are also very important . 
 The interviewers always are interested in what you ask them about their company . 
 Be yourself and be honest . Simply answer the questions put to you . 
 I ’ m making a bookcase . Give me that hammer please , Dan . 
 No , not that one . The big one . 
 Thanks , Dan . 
 I ’ m going to paint it . 
 I ’ m going to paint it pink . 
 This bookcase isn ’ t for me . It ’ s for my daughter , Susan . Pink ’ s her favorite colour . 
 I'm glad to meet you , Sue . Please have a seat . 
 We've looked over your letter and resume and I'm very satisfied with them . Today I want to invite you talk about insurance you're interested in . 
 Of course . A two-week paid vacation a year , a five-day workweek . 
 Yes . All the insurance will be linked with your work . We will issue an insurance policy . 
 I'm starving ! It would be truly appreciated if you bought me a burrito . 
 I'm starving , as I didn't eat yet today . 
 My stomach feels so empty . 
 I'll be getting money on Friday , and I'll get it back to you then . 
 That's not nice . 
 I can't go home yet , because I have things to do here . 
 It's your turn , sir.Sorry to keep you waiting . 
 How do you want your hair cut ? Any particular way ? 
 How about the sides ? 
 How can I help you ? 
 We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers . 
 Our foundation is of very super quality . We only use the finest ingredients . It will moisturize your skin and it can protect your skin from UVA and UVB . 
 Let me show you . We have six colors 
 250 Yuan . 
 What you're paying for , madam , is the ingredients . it provides a soft and perfect finish coverage with a weightless feel . 
 Of course . But I suggest you buy a lipgloss . The shining effect is in . 
 45 Yuan . If you buy the two , you can get a small bottle of nail polish for free . 
 Why do you want to join us ? 
 Do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ? 
 What salary do you get for your present position ? 
 What starting salary would you expect here ? 
 No problem , we pay 3,000 RIB per month . Plus a 20 % commission on all , a company car and other benefits . All travelling expenses will be reimbursed by the company . Do you have any other questions ? 
 Did I do well on my driving test ? 
 So , I passed ? 
 Did I mess up on anything ? 
 What was that ? 
 Yeah , that's pretty hard for me . 
 I know , but I still get my license , right ? 
 What's your plan for your future ? 
 Have you had any previous experience ? 
 Of course it counts . What kind of work did you do there ? 
 In this office , we encourage full attendance by offering a bonus . If you take any leaves , we'll deduct money from your salary .

 I'll call you in a day or two , did you write down your phone number on your resume ? 
 All right . Good-bye . 
 Would you like to order anything else ? 
 Our waitress has been kind of scarce tonight , hasn't she ? 
 She doesn't appear to be headed this way , so I will go get the check . 
 Our total for dinner is $ 36.00 . 
 I kind of don't want to leave any tip for the lousy service we received . 
 I believe that 10 % is just about right amount . 
 Are you okay , man ? You don ’ t look very well . 
 Nice ! So , where did you guys go ? 
 Oh no ! Mike ’ s birthday is a drinkfest for sure ! 
 Is that why you missed work today ? 
 Www ! 
 Too bad man , tonight is Tracy ’ s going away party and she asked if you were gonna go . 
 Can you tell me how to apply for a job on the Internet ? 
 Do I have to send one by e-mail ? 
 What kind of strong suit do you get ? 
 Do you want to be an instructor in the future ? 
 Lisa , I need some help here . 
 Well , I need to get some female stuff . 
 Yeah . I didn't know what they're called in English . 
 I'll keep that in mind . 
 It ’ s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions . 
 Roger Vargas is up at bat . The pitcher winds up and strike one ! 
 The players are scrambling to get the ball . Vargas gets to first base and he ’ s still going ! The outfielder throws it to second ! Vargas slides ! He ’ s safe ! 
 We have a runner on third and up at bat is Brian Okapi ! There ’ s the pitch , he hits it ! It ’ s going , going , that ball is gone ! 
 Do you want to buy something here ? 
 This one is two hundred yuan . 
 Alan , I believe you have studied our catalogue and price list . Are you interested in some of our products ? 
 I'm very surprised to hear you say that . I think our price is very favorable . You can hardly get such an attractive price from other suppliers . 
 What's your proposal then ? 
 We could take a cut on the price if your order is a large one , but a 20 % reduction is really more than we can do . What quantity are you going to order from us then ? 
 5,000 dozen is by no means a large order . In that case , the best I can do is to give you a 5 % reduction . 
 What's your counter-offer then ? 
 15 % is impossible . That'll leave us almost no profit . 
 How about doing it this way ? You increase your quantity to 8,000 dozen and I'll give you a l0 % reduction . 
 Well , to encourage future business , I'm prepared to reduce the price by 10 % . We can't go any further . 
 Roger ? I need figures for accounting . Have finished the calculations ? 
 All right , thanks . 
 How ’ s it going ? 
 What do you need ? 
 Actually , you do owe some fees . 
 Your fees total $ 235.13 . 
 You need to pay these fees soon . 
 Will you be paying with cash or check ? 
 Thanks for your help . 
 There's a question I'm not sure whether it is suitable to ask . 
 When you go dinner with John , who foots the bill ? 
 Is Betty Sue in her office ? 
 I see . 
 Yes , please tell her I stopped by . 
 Ted . Oh , and could you give her this document for me ? 
 Good evening . 
 How long will you be staying ? 
 Let me see . Yes , you can have Room 313 . It's at the back . 
 20 pounds per day , including breakfast . 
 Very good , sir . Will you register , please ? 
 Thank you . The porter will show you to your room 
 Yeah.It ' s a must for me . 
 I won't , mum . 
 Hello , doctor . 
 I've got a backache . 
 No , I don't . I've never had a bad one before . 
 About four days ago . 
 Can you give me some medicine ? It's very painful . 
 What do you want to know about me ? 
 The average grade of all my courses is above 85 . 
 In mathematics I got a 98 . 
 Yes , I have , and three times in total . 
 I have been a class commissary in charge of studies for two years . 
 I was an aerobics team member in college . 
 I am good at sprint and table tennis . 
 What do you think of the most important things to do when running a business ? 
 So , do you think workers should be paid as little as possible ? 
 How can a business maximise revenues ? 
 What else do you suggest ? 
 Excuse me . 
 Are these drinks on sale this weekend ? 
 Can I buy more than one case ? 
 Okay , I ’ ll take four , please . You saved me a lot . 
 Thanks . 
 Hey , Mark , long time no see . 
 Great . I just got back from a week's vacation in Thailand . 
 Fantastic ! I didn't want to come back . 
 They are . And not only that the people are friendly , but also the food is delicious , not to mention cheap . 
 Not much . I've go enough city life in Beijing . 
 Hey , wouldn't it be great if we could go to Thailand together sometime ? 
 I am so excited ! 
 I just voted . 
 Yes , I just had my 18th birthday this year . 
 Why is that ? 
 I didn ’ t think about it like that . 
 No , but that makes me even more excited . 
 Let's start out to discuss the question of payment terms . 
 I fully understand your position . An irrevocable letter of credit ensures that the seller gets paid in time . But , on the other hand it would add to the buying costs . We've been , after all , trading partners for 3 years and you know us well . Can't you give us D / A or D / P ? 
 But on our part , our government is reluctant to approve of L / C payment for our imports . And there is the licensing problem . 
 Can I get some medicine to help me ? 
 What types of drugs can I try ? 
 What about side effects from that medication ? 
 Do I only need to take that one drug ? 
 What can I expect when I take that medication ? 
 Look at the catalogue , John . I think I want to get this red blouse 
 Yah , but it doesn't have a red one . 
 Yes ! 
 Are you watching another news report about the war ? 
 How did this war start ? 
 Politicians from both sides sound increasingly belligerent . Neither side wants to compromise . 
 What do you think will happen ? 
 It would be much simpler and cheaper if they negotiated first . 
 You have good taste . It's made of red wood . 
 300 dollars . 
 Believe me , it's worth the price . 
 How much are you willing to pay ? 
 No . That price would hardly cover the cost . 
 275 dollars is the lowest price I can offer . 
 Mr . Wilson . We very regret the mistakes in goods . I am very sorry and we are responsible for the mistake . 
 The first problem is supposed to be solved after the investigation . About the second problem , I admit it's our fault , so we will exchange all merchandise that falls short of our sample . 
 I can assure you that such a thing today will never happen again in future delivery . We have made the plan to improve the package of our exported goods . 
 We're redecorating our living room . 
 First , we're going to change the curtains , then we're going to paint the walls . 
 Pale yellow . 
 We're going to put in some new furniture . 
 Of course . 
 Sure . And if you rent it , maybe I can help you find a roommate too . 
 Yes , my friend Steve . I'll introduce you . 
 I am sorry . I've already gone through my paycheck for the week . 
 Not me . You know money always burns a hole in my pocket . 
 Not bad . Thank you for your help . I am always busy with this job , I feel a bit tired . 
 I also feel that work efficiency here is very high . and you have strong working ability and professional skill , it seems that you know all , that's really wonderful ! 
 That's right , I have to work . 
 Do you live in Pasadena ? 
 You could always take the 264 . 
 It goes all the way there . 
 Catch it on Altadena Drive . 
 Now you know . 
 No problem . 
 Can ’ t it wait ? I ’ m watching the game right now ! 
 Fine ! What do you need ? 
 Whoa wait a minute ! Isn ’ t that a bit too much ? I mean , how much is all of this going to cost ! 
 Is that all , your majesty ? 
 Hello , who's that speaking ? 
 Yes , I do . 
 Yes , it's fully furnished . 
 15,000 Yuan , including water , but electricity and gas . 
 It's in International Trade Zone . It's only ten minutes ' walk from the nearest subway station . 
 The price can be talked over . How about coming around and taking a look at it first ? 
 All right , see you . 
 That's no problem . Let me see ... You still have ten days annual leave left , is that right ? 
 That's long leave . How's your project coming along ? 
 Well , all right . But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave . 
 Great ! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed . 
 Oh , look at those earrings , Maria . They're perfect for you . 
 No , the yellow ones . 
 Well , that necklace isn't bad . 
 That blue one right there . How much is it ? 
 Hey , let me get it for you . It's your birthday present . 
 Why ? 
 Really , well , o . k . Get the receipts out . 
 That ’ s $ 1825 . 
 $ 3075 . Our paychecks our $ 3300 , combined . That means we don ’ t have any receipts for $ 225 . 
 Excuse me.Have you got any books on genetic engineering ? I've looked for them everywhere , but I can't find any . 
 What a pity ! I should have come earlier . 
 Ok , I will . 
 I think we'll need more time than the schedule gives us . 
 Howdy ! Nice car ! What seems to be the problem ? 
 Not sure yet.How about you pop the hood and we can take a look . Mmmm , it doesn ’ t look good . 
 Well missy , the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . You should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died . 
 I ’ m afraid a bit more than that . We need to order the spare parts , take apart your electrical system , fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . You are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks . 
 May I use your phone ? 
 Good morning . SRC international . How may I help you ? 
 Certainly . Who should I say is calling ? 
 And what is it regarding please ? 
 Of course , Please hold the line Mr . Hunter . 
 Who ’ s calling ? 
 Hold on , I ’ ll get her . 
 Will you bring our bill , please ? 
 Thanks . Let me see . I think there's a mistake on the bill here . Would you mind checking , please ? 
 How about taxes service charge ? 
 Then 100 US dollars covers everything , doesn't it ? 
 This room is unfit for humans . I want another room , and I want a refund for tonight . 
 In a word , cockroaches ! 
 Thank you . I'm glad that you don't believe that your guests are liars . 
 How are you doing today ? 
 What can I help you with ? 
 As a matter of fact , you do . 
 You owe $ 235.13 . 
 Will you be paying some of that off today ? 
 How will you be paying ? 
 Hello , Sunshine Travel Agency . 
 Well , let me see . We have a nice one on which we still have several unfilled places . 
 Yes , sir . 
 Five hundred dollars altogether . 
 Yes , I will introduce the itinerary in detail . 
 Yes , but I only have few experiences . I guided a few groups of foreign tourists from America last winter vacation . I showed them around some places of interest . 
 Too many . I will just give you one example , Huangguoshu Falls , the largest waler-fall in China . 
 Thank you ! 
 Oh , yes . We have rather mild winters . It always has much sunshine in winter . But it was very foggy when I left two days ago . I knew it would be colder here , but I thought there would be a lot of snow . 
 What is the temperature today , do you know ? 
 Oh , I'm very lucky that my wife let me take a heavy overcoat . 
 Yes , she is . By the way , what is the best season in Beijing ? 
 Really ? Then I will come to Beijing in the fall next time . 
 do you like music ? 
 do you think this music is warm matched ? 
 how about the lyrics ? 
 it bring me back to some of my childhood memories . 
 of course.it is really fantastic too , and it makes me eager to dance . 
 this song is really worthy listening to and enjoying . 
 Now please tell me something about your achievements in your work unit . 
 Have you received any other honors ? 
 Do you have anything published ? 
 hello , do you remember me ? I bought some vases from you yesterday . 
 that's right . I thought I'd come back to buy some more souvenirs . 
 well , first , I'd like to buy a few postcards . My sister used to always send a postcard to herself whenever she went anywhere . I want to do that , too . 
 posters are difficult to travel with . I think I'll just buy the postcards . I heard that you might also have some of the masks that are made in Venice . 
 how much do they cost ? 
 yes , I think I'd like the green mask in the middle . 
 I'll take it , I'd also like to buy some chocolate . 
 yes , it's my girlfriend's birthday today and she loves chocolate . 
 they look delicious . I think she'll be pleased . 
 I'm sorry ; he's out at the moment . 
 I think he'll be back in about an hour at least . 
 Yes , of course . 
 Ok . Does he know your number ? 
 13924774026 . All right . Thanks for calling . Oh , hang on , someone's at the door that may be him , please hold on . 
 I need the haircut . But you seem so busy today . 
 Ok , but how long I have to wait , it is going to be more than 30 minutes . 
 Thank you . 
 Ok , thanks . 
 I was going to eat in , I'm short on cash . 
 In that case , I'm with you . Em.this is good . 
 Are you on the up and up ? 
 If you asked me , you've got a screw loose somewhere . 
 Fat chance , I'm too scared of bungee jumping . 
 What did that have to do with me ? I'm not the self-seeker like you . 
 I had a sneaking suspicion about you , Eric , I think you've lost it . 
 Hello there ! Come on in ! Don ’ t just stand there ! Come and take a seat ! 
 Oh my gosh ! Your hair is amazing ! So silky , so shiny ! I am going to work my magic on your hair ! You hear me ? You are going to look like a million bucks ! 
 Don ’ t you worry , I ’ ll take care of everything ! ( starts cutting ) Oh my god ! I just love your curly hair ! It ’ s so fluffy and cute ! You should totally let it grow out . An afro would look great on you ! 
 Okay , but you are going to be my masterpiece ! 
 It's a good idea . 
 I don't like Hamburgers . They have no taste . 
 Maybe I want an apple pie . 
 Stockholders meetings are held biannually . Usually the meetings are scheduled for spring and fall . In between the meetings , each stockholder receives biannual reports . Financial statements are made once a year . 
 You're right , it's a low percentage . Also , in order to attend meetings , you have to hold a certain amount of shares . It's quite a large number , so most of the stockers are excluded from proceedings . 
 Unless they're united , very little ... 
 Yes , bring me a bottle of wine and filet steak . 
 Yes , what kind do you have ? 
 I think French will be fine . 
 I'm going to the Golden hotel . 
 Thank you . I have an appointment with an important client at 10 
 Thank you.here ' s 10 $ , just give me 1 $ back , please . 
 Very well . You know , we have definite ways of packaging garments . As to blouses , we use a polythene wrapper for each article , all ready for window display . 
 Right you are . We'll see to it that the blouses appeal to the eye as well as to the purse . 
 We'll pack them 10 dozens to one carton , gross weight around 25 kilos a carton . 
 Yes , corrugated cardboard boxes . 
 Why use wooden cases ? 
 The cartons are comparatively light , and therefore easy to handle . They won't be stowed away with the heavy cargo . The stevedores will see to that . Besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with straps . Silk blouses are not fragile goods . They can stand a lot of jolting . 
 No need to worry about that . The cartons lined with plastic sheets are waterproof , and as the boxes are made of cardboard , they will be handled with care . 
 Tampering with cartons is easily detected . I should say that this rather discourages pilferage . 
 But cartons are quite seaworthy . They are extensively used in our shipments to continental ports . There are never any complaints from our clients , and our insurance company has also approved such packing for W . P . A . and T . P . N . D . 
 I'm sorry , but we can't take on any responsibility that is beyond our functions and powers . We'll make sure that the packing is seaworthy , but we can't commit ourselves to being responsible for every kind of mishap . 
 We'll use wooden cases if you insist , but the charge for packing will be considerably higher , and it also slows delivery . 
 Please do . I'll be waiting for your reply . 
 Don ’ t sweat it . We will land safely . 
 Yes , sir ? 
 I used to play football regularly when I was at university . And I used to do athletics in the summer . 
 I was a runner-a long-distance runner . 
 No . I'm afraid I haven't had time since I got married . 
 Certainly , sir . 
 You know I don't know anything about fashion . 
 Well , they are both all right . 
 Oh , no . I mean you look very nice in both of them . 
 But after all , it is your decision , not mine . 
 I'm looking for some fresh produce that's on sale . 
 Mangoes . What are they ? 
 Can you eat the nut ? 
 How much are they ? 
 What does a mango taste like ? 
 How do I know if it's ripe ? 
 Where do they come from ? 
 Can I help you ? 
 Well , we have all kinds of sports shoes.Could you tell me what kind of sport you usually do ? 
 OK , then you can buy a pair of jogging shoes.Here are jogging shoes.Which pair do you like best ? 
 Here you are.You can try them on . 
 Good morning . Mrs.Smith . 
 Well , what kind of books does she like ? 
 I see . Has she read any detective stories ? 
 Do you know if she's read this one ? 
 Ah ! She has a bad memory . How old is she ? 
 I suggest you take this book . It's very exciting . 
 Good morning golf aficionados ! My name is Rick Fields , and you guessed it , I am here with my main man , Bob Copeland . 
 Whoa , that ’ s a lot of cash ! Let ’ s go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing . 
 Tiger Woods is about to tee off , and let ’ s see if he has the same luck as Jack . Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and , he seems to be very nervous . 
 It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees . He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it . 
 Excuse me , Mr . White ? I just need you to sign these before I leave . 
 That ’ s my job , sir . Just one more signature here , please . 
 Excuse me , but can you tell me the way to the railway station ? 
 About how long will it take me to get there ? 
 I see . Is there a bus I can take ? 
 Thank you so much for your help . 
 Welcome to the Consultancy Department , I'm Greg Wu . What can I assist you with today ? 
 How so ? 
 We are able to do credit investigations globally . You have no need to worry . 
 10 years ago , maybe yes . But nowadays we are a global village , it's easy to deal with any foreign country . 
 I'll look forward to it and make sure all of the paperwork is ready and waiting . 
 Welcome to McDonald's . Can I take your order ? 
 Would you like something to drink ? 
 Will that be it ? 
 Oh , no . Charlie , where is my purse ? 
 Yes , I did . I lost it . It disappeared . 
 I had it when I left the house . I had it when we start to get the hotdog . 
 You're in great shape , Keith . Do you work out at a gym ? 
 So , how often do you work out ? 
 Say , I like racquetball , too . 
 Uh ... how well do you play ? 
 Well , all right . But I'm not very good . 
 Why do you choose our company to apply for a job ? 
 Have you got a clear idea about our company ? 
 Have you tried other companies ? 
 Will you take a job which is not in line with your major ? 
 How long would you work here if you were admitted ? 
 Do you expect a high salary ? 
 Hello ? Can you give me a tow ? My tour car's stranded . 
 I'm on highway 1-75 going near exit 46 . 
 It's a blue Nissan minivan . 
 The closest garage . What's the charge ? 
 How long will it take ? 
 Thanks . 
 I think I'm going to eat a piece of fruit . 
 I really like apples and grapes . 
 I love green apples . 
 Really ? Why not ? 
 So , you like red apples better ? 
 I think green apples are a lot better . 
 I'm colin . It's nice to meet you . What do you do ? 
 I'm in between jobs at the moment . 
 I'd like to find a job with flexible hours in the IT field . 
 no . Is it difficult to find such a job ? 
 yes . I'm pretty out-going and friendly . 
 I have some . I worked in the IT department at a language school for four years in Spain . 
 yes , but not fluently . 
 I've sent my CV to dozens of companies but nobody has got back to me . 
 no , because I didn't know what I wanted to do . 
 thanks , I will . I'll see you tomorrow then ! 
 That is just an excuse . You can always find some time to exercise . 
 Bill , you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing . And skipping meals will not help you lose weight.In fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals . 
 How about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ? 
 I know , I know . Have you got a portable radio ? You can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time . 
 I just called Mr . Smith in Room 201 , but there was no reply . Would you find out if he's still staying there ? 
 Oh , he did ? May I have his forwarding address , please ? 
 Can I give you a lift home , Mrs Word ? 
 Could you hold my umbrella when I get my keys out , please ? 
 Dreadful . There , the door is open now . 
 Hey , Ann . You don't have a pen , do you ? 
 Thanks . I don't suppose you have some paper , too . 
 Thanks so much . I owe you one . 
 Actually not so good . That's why we made a special trip to see you . 
 Good . I want to discuss with you the mode of payment for the construction of the power plant under negotiation . 
 I would like to explain to you our financial position . The manufacture of machinery and its accessories and parts will consume both time and money . It takes five years to manufacture the machinery and we will have to advance the cost for the main machines to be produced , and besides this there are large sums to be paid to our subcontractors for the manufacture of the accessories and parts . 
 Well , in fact , it is beyond our financial capability . 
 Have you considered the possibility of a buyer's credit ? 
 So , we propose your company apply to Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation for a long-term loan . Six months before each shipment , you through Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation open , in our favour , an irrevocable , dividable L / C which is to remain valid for two months . 
 Hello , is Mr Over there 
 I want 6420422 3 , is that right ? 
 oh , I'm sorry to bother you . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 What do you need me for ? 
 What are you being charged with ? 
 I ’ m willing to provide my services . 
 I work for $ 150 an hour . 
 That ’ s what I charge . 
 Hello , miss . Can you bring me something to drink ? 
 Thank you for reminding me . Well , please give me a glass of brandy and I will pay for it . 
 Good morning madam . What can I get you ? 
 Certainly madam , what kind of coffee would you like ? 
 Well we have espresso , cappuccino , latte , skinny latte or Americano . 
 Here you are . You ’ ll find the sugar just over there . 
 Hello , I'm sorry it's been such a long time . I've been away on business . I'd like to discount this . 
 Yeah , sure . Here they are . Take your time going through them , I'm in no hurry . 
 Do I need to pay anything ? Like a handling fee , or something ? 
 Peter , take off your pajamas . 
 It's chilly outside , so don't forget to put on your jacket . 
 Son , it looks great on you . 
 What's in your bags ? 
 Would you mind opening it ? 
 Would you like to have some icecream ? I've got a variety of flavors for you to choose from . I've got strawberry , peach , chocolate , coffee , vanilla and praline . 
 Come on , just a bite . It doesn't really hurt to have just a bite . 
 Gee ! You are really strong-willed . 
 Well , I'd better not tempt you . Otherwise , if I give you a piece of cake , you might ask for a glass of milk . 
 I need to find a new way of getting my insurance . 
 Could you give me some details about that ? 
 That sounds great . More dividends if I want to purchase them ! 
 I'll go through the materials that you have given me and return shortly . Thanks . 
 Don't get drunk . 
 No , you'll have to get off at the bank , and take a No . 50 . 
 One dollar . 
 Two stops after this one . 
 Sure . 
 No , a No . 50 will take you right there . 
 Well , to come straight to the point , could you tell us something about your new price ? 
 That's a high price . 
 I know . But I must say it's still unacceptable . Couldn't you make a discount for me ? You see , we have such a long-term cooperation . And our business could be mutually beneficial . 
 Can I get you something to drink ? 
 So how about an aperitif ? 
 Stirred or shaken ? 
 Here you are . 
 Sure . All of our mixed drinks are excellent . You can also try a delicious non-alcoholic cocktail . 
 Try a Stinger . It has lime juice and grenadine over ice . 
 Here we go . 
 Enjoy yourself . 
 I am really thirsty . 
 Let's do that . 
 A soda sounds good . 
 Why is that ? 
 What should I drink then ? 
 That sounds good . 
 Finally we're on board ! 
 Are they window seats or aisle seats ? 
 Ok . But can I trade my seat with you ? I prefer the one near the window . I'm a terrible flyer . I always get airsick and can never relax until after I've landed . 
 Thanks . Where shall we put our luggage ? 
 Good idea . 
 Ok . Hope it's a pleasant trip . 
 And no hijackers . 
 Here are the plans for the new finished goods warehouse . Do you have any thoughts or comments ? 
 Let me check . It's 3.80 m . 
 That's a good point . I'll make a note to increase it to 4.80 to make sure we can accept the new containers . 
 This is Wang Ling speaking.You satisfy all the requirements . Congratulations ! You're hired . 
 I think you'd be perfect for this job . This company needs someone like you . When can you start working ? 
 Very good . You will normally be sent an official notification of the results of your interview by post . Once you get the notification , you can come . 
 See you . Bye . 
 Do you have the latest lipstick from Christian Dior ? 
 Any special colors ? 
 Can I try it on and see how it looks ? 
 Looks good . I'll take it . 
 Good morning . Yes , I am . But I ’ m sorry I don ’ t think I know you . 
 Oh , yes . We do have such a commercial . Sit down , please , Miss Liu . I ’ m glad to see you . Could you tell me about yourself first ? 
 Could you tell me about your work experience ? 
 Do you enjoy your work ? 
 Well , according to your experience , perhaps you could tell me what essential qualities a personnel department office clerk should maintain . 
 Good . Go on , please . 
 Anything else ? 
 Good . The work includes keeping the files . Have you got any practical experience with that ? 
 Would you like something to drink ? 
 Here you are . 
 Wait a moment . 
 That won't be a problem . Could you please tell me your name ? 
 Sir , I'm Michelle , and I run the front desk . Please tell me the days you'll be here . 
 We recently changed many things here , sir , including our prices . Do you mind , sir ? 
 The price will be $ 308 a night . 
 Very good . Now , Mr . Sandals , about the room , smoking or nonsmoking ? 
 Most of our clients prefer nonsmoking . Now , does a queen sound okay ? 
 One more second , sir . Your reservation is now verified , so all I need is your phone number . 
 Let me repeat that 626-555-1739 . Okay , sir , we look forward to seeing you in April ! 
 Yes . I'd like to make a room reservation . 
 Two weeks from Thursday , for three nights . 
 Right . 
 Robert Hamlin . 
 Double . 
 Do you have any questions before you commit yourself to this ? 
 The subscription fee is charged at a rate of 1.2 % . But for redeeming , a rate of a usual 0.5 % , we shall charge you 1.6 % if you apply to buy it after the fund-raising period . 
 I'm afraid so , yes . There is always some risk on the buyer's part . 
 What will you discuss at the meeting ? 
 And anything else ? 
 That's all ? 
 OK . 
 I hope you enjoyed your stay . 
 Good . Right , that comes to $ 1,500 . 
 That ’ s right , sir . Three nights at 500 dollars a night ... that comes to $ 1,500 . 
 Yes , of course . The meals and excursions were included in the hotel price . 
 I ’ m sorry sir . The 250 - dollar rate is based on double occupancy . That means it ’ s 250 per person . The room itself is 500 dollars a night . 
 Of course . Just a minute ; I ’ ll get her . 
 Well , your job is to compile and analyze financial information to prepare entries to accounts . You ’ re also responsible for preparing profit and loss statements and monthly closing and cost accounting reports . 
 Our company just concluded a business transaction . You can help with documenting varies financial sheets involved in this transaction . 
 You ’ re welcome . Feel free to ask me any time you need help . 
 My pleasure . You're a sweet couple . Do you have any questions ? 
 No , it doesn't . And there's a maintenance fee for each month . It's forty NT per ping . 
 Yes , but that doesn't include cable . It's for cleaning and trash removal . You just leave your trash outside your door . 
 Thank you , miss . Will dinner be served on the plane ? 
 That would be nice . Could you also get me a pillow and a blanket , please ? 
 How long will this flight last ? 
 Good . I'll have plenty of time to nap on the plane . 
 Morning . I'm a new user of your credit card and I was wondering if I'm taking full advantage of it . 
 Yes , of course . It's so much easier than cash , to be honest ; nowadays I hardly ever use cash . I just put it on the card and pay off the balance every month . 
 Really ? 
 So , if for some reason I was having a bad month and spent a little too much I could just pay the minimum ? 
 How so ? 
 Oh , I see . Well , I don't plan on only paying the minimum , but it's good to know that I can if I had to . Thanks for that . 
 I'm looking for a pair of shoes . 
 I wear size 36 . This pair looks nice . Can I try them on ? 
 How much are they ? 
 I'll take them . 
 It's on the south wall of the store , in aisle A . 
 I don't know . The produce person can tell you , though . 
 Here's ten . Keep the change . 
 I thought it would be a good idea to get a check-up . 
 I know . I figure as long as there ’ s nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ? 
 O . K . 
 Yes . 
 I ’ Ve tried a hundred times , but I just can ’ t seem to kick the habit . 
 O . K . , thanks , doctor . 
 “ You ain't nothing ' but a hound-dog ... ” 
 Of course I'm OK ! I just bought a bunch of classic Elvis records ! 
 No sweat . Just go back and talk him down . Here comes Wei . 
 Oh , Dad . Do I have to get up right now ? 
 Why didn't my alarm go off today ? 
 I must have slept right through it . 
 OK . I know . 
 Good morning ! Is Mr . Smith in ? I'm Cheng Jun from China National Petroleum Corporation . I'd like to see him . 
 Am . No , I have an urgency to talk with him . 
 Thank you . 
 It's nine o'clock now . And I'll wait for him . 
 I stopped you for driving through a red light . 
 You didn't know ? 
 Don't you know that yellow means slow down ? 
 Why'd you speed up instead ? 
 I'll have to write you a ticket . 
 Here's your ticket . 
 Yes . I think so . It ’ s not a very expensive apartment . It ’ s in the right area and it has everything that we are looking for . The rooms are quite large too . 
 The neighbourhood is nice too . There is a park nearby . 
 It ’ s a pity we can ’ t afford a house . A garden would be so nice . 
 The building is quite new and well constructed . I ’ m happy with the fittings too . 
 Would you like to mail it by air or sea ? 
 About 10 days . You can send it express mail if you need it faster . It will only take three or four days . 
 OK , the postage is 275 yuan . 
 This is the receipt , please keep it . Have a good day . 
 Where did you get all these barney tour pamphlets ? 
 That ’ s why it ’ s become a very popular holiday destination these years . Someone told me the service there is very good too . Are you planning to spend the holiday there ? 
 How many days is the tour ? 
 That ’ s a perfect plan . Enjoy yourself . 
 Well , I have got a vacancy . 
 Eight dollars fifty a week excluding laundry . 
 Can you call back later ? We're right in the middle of lunch . 
 I have a bad headache . 
 For two days . 
 I ’ m afraid so . Sometimes I feel hot and sometimes I feel cold . 
 What is your strongest trait ? 
 How would your friends or colleagues describe you ? 
 What personality traits do you admire ? 
 What leadership qualities did you develop as an administrative personnel ? 
 How do you normally handle criticism ? 
 What do you find frustrating in a work situation ? 
 How do you handle your conflict with your colleagues in your work ? 
 To secure employment hopefully with your company . 
 I will stay as long as I can continue to learn and to grow in my field . 
 Ok , what do you want me to do ? 
 Ok . I ’ ll put the plates and cutlery away as I dry them . Where is the tea towel ? Oh , here it is . 
 While you ’ re cleaning the cooker , I ’ ll wipe the worktop . That was a great meal , by the way . 
 My pleasure ! This tea towel ’ s a little ragged . Do you have another one ? 
 Keep it and use it as rag . You can clean your bicycle with it . 
 We'd like this course for two , please . 
 Well , can't you make it for two only ? 
 I see . Well , what do you recommend then ? 
 Right , we'll have these three . 
 No , thanks . 
 Is the table free ? 
 I don't think so . Is that table all right ? 
 I'd like to pay my bill now . 
 Tom Wilson in Room 306 . 
 No . 
 Can I pay by credit card ? 
 May I speak to Marry Lin please ? 
 When will she be back ? 
 Mom , did you see Andy's dog ? 
 Mom , please . Can I have a pet dog like Andy's ? 
 Mom , we can keep it on the balcony , right ? 
 We ’ re going to need a lot of new stuff after the holidays . Let ’ s make a list . 
 Well , to begin with , we ’ re going to have to get a new desk for you and I ’ d like to replace that old typewriter . 
 I'm looking forward to our son's graduation this weekend . 
 Well , dear , we can't force him to go to college . It's up to him . 
 Fill it up , PLS . 
 Premium , PLS . Could you check my tyres , too ? I think they need air . 
 I don't think so . It's brand-new . 
 Yes , PLS . I also need you to check the oil and the radiator . 
 Pls fill it up with water then . 
 Do you take credit card ? 
 30 dollars and 10 cents ? Here you go . 
 Do you want to try the new coffee here ? 
 Hello , sir . Have you reserved already ? 
 Yes , how long will you intend to stay ? 
 Yes , we give 5 % discount for a week and 12 % for 2 weeks . 
 I'm afraid I forgot to lock the door . 
 Sorry , Mum , I'll lock it right away . 
 Hello , what can I do for you ? 
 OK ! What kind of account do you want to open ? 
 I will open it for you right now . 
 It's 10 yuan . How much money do you want to deposit ? 
 Please write down your name , address and the amount of your deposit here . And please choose a passcode of six numbers and confirm it .

 Bye ! 
 This is Mr Brown speaking . I'd like to speak to Mr . Thomas , please . 
 That's bad ! I've been trying to call him for the last ten minutes , but your line has been busy.Will he be back soon ? 
 Is there anywhere I can reach him ? 
 I have a business appointment with him for tomorrow morning at ten o'clock , but I'm afraid I can't make it . 
 Unfortunately , I'm leaving town rather unexpectedly , and I may be gone for several days . 
 Thank you . 
 Hello , may I speak to Alice please ? 
 I've been trying to call you all day . 
 It's okay . 
 Oh , I just wanted to see if you wanted to hang out tomorrow . 
 Maybe we can go see a movie or something . 
 I'll see you tomorrow then . 
 Sir , may I please see your license and registration ? Do you know how fast you were going ? 
 You ’ re not sure ? You were going at 90 miles per hour ! That ’ s 25 mph over the legal speed limit ! Have you been drinking ? 
 Then how can you explain your behavior ? 
 Not paying attention to the speedometer ? Why not ? 
 On a cell phone ? 
 That ’ s definitely true . I ’ m going to have to give you a ticket . Please remember to drive more carefully next time . 
 As far as I can see , Westlake Restaurant is a good choice . 
 Walk down till you see the first lights . It's cross the street . 
 Susan ! Why didn ’ t you tell me that you were taking over the Silk Company account ? 
 You know I wasn ’ t at the meeting . I was meeting with Mr . Wei about this account . I ’ Ve been on this for a month and a half . 
 I want to take part in the bus tour . When does the bus leave ? 
 That's fine . I don't have much time to waste . 
 How long does the tour last ? 
 Good morning . My name is John Smith . I'm an import manager . 
 Nice to meet You , Ms . Thou . We've learned that you specialize in the export of electronic products . 
 Yes . I had a look just now . I found some of the exhibits of excellent quality and beautiful design . I feel we 
 So , Ms . Thou , we're a newly-established company , but we have wide connections with wholesalers and retailers all over America .

 Certainly , I'll be going . 
 I'll be waiting for you in our office about nine o'clock . 
 Hello , is that 2896919 16 ? 
 Can you book me a room with a bath for August 28 ? 
 I wish it was a nicer day today . 
 It wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer . 
 It would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather . 
 That's right , it really would be . 
 I know what you mean , I can't wait until it's winter . 
 I would rather deal with the winter than the summer .

 I know what you mean , I can't wait until it's winter . 
 I would rather deal with the winter than the summer . 
 I hate carrying so much cash with me . 
 I have one but it can only be used in my country . 
 Well , that's great . 
 I'm afraid you've got the wrong extension number . 
 OK . Hold on , please . 
 Mr.Cook is on Line Six . I'll put you through . 
 You are welcome . 
 That's all for now . How much do I owe you ? 
 Can't you make it a little cheaper ? 
 OK . I understand . Thank you . 
 Where are you planning on looking for one ? 
 I can tell you where I got mine . 
 IKEA has beautiful furniture . 
 The furniture cost a couple thousand dollars . 
 It's very sturdy . You get what you pay for . 
 I assure you that you're paying for quality . 
 Do you have any idea how many you'd like ? 
 Would you fill out this form , please ? 
 If you detect any difference , I'll take you out to dinner . 
 Thank you . Your order will be ready seven days from now . 
 We can certainly give you faster turnaround , but it will cost you extra . 
 Yes . I sent in my resume at the end of last week . I'm applying for the accounts assistant position . 
 My name is Judy Liao . That's spelled L I A O . 
 Not really . I was in the neighborhood , and I just wanted to stop in to see if you received my resume . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , maybe . The ad in the newspaper said you wanted the resume , a cover letter , and two letters of recommendation . I included those things in the envelope . Is there anything else I should send ? 
 Do you know when they will start setting up interviews for the job ? 
 I see . Well , thank you very much for helping me . You have been very helpful . 
 Thank you . 
 I have applied for a transfer . 
 Yes . I think it's time to move on . I ’ Ve already been here too long . 
 Well , I want to be transferred to the Shanghai office .

 Good morning , can I have your ticket , please ? 
 Thank you . Would you like a window or an aisle seat ? 
 I'm looking for some fresh produce that's on sale . 
 Mangoes . What are they ? 
 Can you eat the nut ? 
 How much are they ? 
 What does a mango taste like ? 
 How do I know if it's ripe ? 
 Where do they come from ? 
 I'm going to let Bob know about the merger . 
 Why ? 
 Laura told me today that she has a friend with a car for sale . 
 Yes , it's used , but she said it was in very good shape.It ' s a small foreign car . 
 She thinks it has about twenty-five or thirty thousand miles . 
 Three thousand dollars . 
 He lives in the city and you know how expensive it is to keep a car in the city . 
 No , but she gave me her friend's telephone number . I can call him and make an appointment . 
 I believe you can take the 486 . 
 It sure will . 
 It's a forty-five minute to an hour ride . 
 It doesn't take long at all 
 More people start getting on around LA . 
 Don't mention it . 
 Not bad . I ’ m proficient in both written and spoken English . 
 I passed College English Test Band 6 , with good skill in listening , speaking , reading , and writing . I haven't got any certificate of computer skills , because I don ’ t think certificates are necessary if what ’ s needed is merely operating a computer . I think practically , to know how to use a computer is more important . And I am quite familiar with Microsoft Office . 
 I took a part-time job last semester in translating and doing reception work for an exhibition . My work included hosting the visiting foreign exhibitors , communicating with them , arranging their agenda , and translating several materials . I think this activity well demonstrated my ability in English . And I will be glad to take any form of English test you arrange for me to prove my ability . 
 I stick to my principles and keep to the rules . Sometimes , they just lack enthusiasm . When I get them involved with something constructive , some of them change their attitude later . 
 Can I help you ? 
 What size are you ? 
 Ok , try these on in the changing rooms . 
 He's the poor kid's father . 
 Yes , very .

 German . 
 Since I first met my wife , about three years . 
 Yes , I ’ d like to do that . 
 Thank you . 
 In the market . Any problem ? 
 I have read your resume.What is your last job ? 
 Could you introduce your biggest accomplishments in your last job ? 
 Great ! Could you tell me your educational background ? 
 Why are you willing to work for our company ? 
 OK , that's all . We'll inform you in two days . 
 But how did you know I was working for WebTracker ? 
 He couldn't have told you . Only a few people at WebTracker know about me . 
 I can't believe it . I can't believe I fell into your trap . 
 There are something wrong with my computer . 
 The computer doesn't work when I push the power cotton . 
 Yes , I don't know why it doesn't work this time . 
 Yeah ! 
 OK , I'll expected you around 2 o'clock ?

 Where did he go ? 
 Like me ? But you see I am so successful now . And if he is really like me , he will be more successful than me in the future . 
 Pay him ? But he studies for himself , not for you or for me or for anybody else . I got an idea . You should send him to class every morning and after the class begins , you can go to work . 
 That's a good idea . Why have I never thought of that ? 
 Okay , so let ’ s go over everything one more time . I really want you to get this job ! 
 So , let ’ s see , you did your research on the company , right ? 
 So what would your role in the company ? 
 Sounds good , and so , why do you want to work with them ? 
 You idiot ! Don ’ t say that ! Do you want this job , or not ? 
 I'm on my way out to a New Year's banquet.How do I look ? Is my make-up ok ? 
 Do your think I should wear a different dress ? 
 Thanks for saying.Do you have any ideas which necklace I should wear ? 
 Thanks for helping out.Now Im ready , what are you doing tonight ? 
 Sounds fun.Anyone I know ? 
 Sounds like I'm missing out on a good time.Oh , well , there's always next year . 
 Hi , is this the Resume Writing Workshop ? 
 I really don ’ t know that much about putting together a resume . 
 What ’ s the most important part ? 
 What comes next ? 
 Can I list my interests next ? 
 Confronted with difficult questions in an interview , the job-hunters mostly will be at a loss about what to do . 
 Still , there are some rules to follow . 
 Don't get nervous and freaked out . 
 There should be neither too much silence nor hasty answers 
 Don't be discouraged even when confronted with negative questions 
 Anyway , what really matters is that you have tried your best . 
 Mom , is there anything in the fridge I can eat before dinner ? 
 Anything else ? 
 Do I have any other choices ? 
 Is everything in the fridge leftovers ? I hate leftovers ! 
 Nice to see you ; how have you been feeling lately ? 
 I am happy that you have decided to come in for your annual physical . 
 We are going to look at your heart and lungs , do a few blood tests , and see that your eyes , ears , and nose are all working as they should . 
 I can do a chest X-ray to check for congestion . 
 The blood test is for cholesterol , white blood cell count , and blood sugar . 
 Excuse me . I need to refill this prescription . 
 Yes , I need to refill it today . 
 I was worried about that . I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not . 
 Listen . This is an emergency . I tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . So I can't see him in time . I need this medicine . It is for skin condition . I've run out.Can you just refill it once more ? 
 But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription . 
 But I have a prescription . I just need more of it . 
 Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor.It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor . 
 This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it . 
 Hi , Tom ! This is Marry with Hans furniture store . 
 I just wanted to let you to know that we had decided to offer the sales position to someone else . 
 We considered you very carefully but the other candidate has more experience . 
 I'm sure you are . 
 I want to get on the bus already . 
 It was supposed to be here thirty minutes ago . 
 I need to get to work , so it better . 
 I agree , it's just never on time . 
 I also hate having to stand at a bus stop in all kinds of weather . 
 We need to get a car . 
 Where is my back pack ? 
 I just put it on the chair a while ago , but now it's gone . 
 Of course , I am sure . I bet someone stole it . 
 What would you like today ? 
 Do you want cheese on it ? 
 Can I get you something to drink ? 
 What kind do you want ? 
 Would you like anything else ? 
 Is that all ? 
 Mary ! 
 What're you doing here ? You live in London , don't you ? 
 May I help you ? 
 You mean this one ?

 I would like to have a pair of trousers made to measure . 
 Besides , don't make it too loose . 
 Of course . Let me check it . Firstly , don't be frustrated about all the buttons on it . 
 After overcoming these buttons , you should check whether there is any paper in the machine , you must make sure this . 
 And then prepare what you want to receive . If you want to send a photograph , you must copy one . 
 The next thing you should do is to wait . The sender will give you the fax . 
 Maybe we should call its after-service man . 
 I'd like to have this roll of film developed . 
 Four by six will do . 
 Mom , am I like a superman ? All I need is a cape . 
 Mom , you always think of me as a child .

 Dear Mom , please permit of superman's naughty .

 I'm afraid I can't do that . It's Dad's seat , according to the book about table manners . 
 Great . That's my favorite seat which will be the nearest to the birthday cake . 
 Why do they serve up the noodles first ? I don't like it . Where is the cake ?

 What time you suspect back them ? 
 No , thanks . I'll call back later .

 And then right at the bridge . 
 Yes . The gas station is on the left . And you can't miss it . 
 I can't do that , Zina . You know I can't . 
 Who told you that ? 
 How far do we have to go ? 
 The traffic is not very heavy on this high way , is it ? So I ’ m sure we ’ ll make it . 
 Don ’ t worry . There ’ s plenty of time yet .

 Fortunately , there is a widely-spoken commercial language , namely English . 
 In South America , the most common language is Spanish and Portuguese . 
 Yes , the language is a part of culture . It reflects a nation's character . 
 So in foreign trade , you must be very clear about language differences .

 Well , I just want to enjoy what I ’ m doing it ’ s the most important thing to me . 
 Yes , because I think being interesting thing is the best teacher . Or have more opportunities to have career growth . 
 Yes , of course . 
 In five years , I ’ d like to be a senior manager of this corporation . 
 By doing whatever is necessary . 
 They are reports of our company . 
 No , they are filed according to dates . 
 No problem , here you are . 
 I don't see any wrinkles or sagging skin ! You'd better stop being so ridiculous . 
 I think you need to get a brain surgery . Honestly speaking , you look charming . 
 You are fine the way you are . Besides , plastic surgery hurts . 
 Sure it is . So you'd better get rid of this idea . 
 I know , I ’ m really sorry that I missed the deadline . But really , it wasn ’ t my fault . You see , we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute , and that I couldn ’ t get into the database and extract the kind of information that I needed for the data analysis . You know , if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the ARM stable , then I wouldn ’ t have missed my deadline . 
 No , I ’ m not trying to pass the buck here ; I know that it was me who is ultimately responsible for getting this done . But the thing is , I could have finished on time if the system hadn ’ t gone down . And you know , with everything I ’ Ve got going on now , I can ’ t afford to waste time dealing with technical problems . I ’ Ve got a lot on my plate and there are only twenty-four hours in a day ... 
 I'm afraid I have to return this sweater . 
 You see , there is a run at the neck . 
 No , thank you . 
 I hope you can help me . I've been told about something called ' Financing Link ' ? 
 Could you tell me more ? 
 So , I can choose exactly what services I require ? That's brilliant . Can I use the card if I'm overseas to withdraw my daily expenses ? 
 This is just what I've been looking for . Sign me up right away , please . 
 Because I went out . 
 I didn ’ t have any change . 
 I don ’ t like all your questions . That ’ s why . 
 But I like its color . 
 I'll take one , too . 
 Give me just a few seconds , sir , and I'll hand you your receipt . Here you are . 
 I hope you enjoyed your stay , sir . 
 I apologize again for the cockroaches , sir . I hope you have a nice trip home . 
 it's Cindy , you know that . Hey , Cindy , say hello to Maria . 
 she is also very naughty . By the way , do you have a dog , Maria ? 
 Oh , a cat ? Come on . 
 but I think they're dull , aren't they ?

 Poor cat . 
 Hello , housekeeping . Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 We charge $ 5 for a barrel . 
 Please fill out the form sir .

 That would be wonderful . Thank you so much for all of your help . 
 What part hurts ? 
 Well , maybe you broke it . But what I'm worried about is this cut . 
 C'mon . Just don't move . 
 We don't have a decent First Aid Kit , do we ? 
 There's some tape , iodine , and cloth bandages . I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . What we need is a tourniquet . 
 Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut . 
 Alright , alright . How did you cut this so bad ? 
 We'll have to get you to a hospital . I can ride you on the back of my bike . 
 Yes , I almost slid too.Alright . This tourniquet is tight . How does it feel ? 
 Alright , I'm twisting it around . You tell me when to stop . 
 I heard you will be going on a business trip . 
 How long will you be away ? 
 Who will take your place ? 
 Good choice . He is competent for the position . 
 Mom , give me a glass of orange juice . 
 Oh , sorry mom , i forgot.please give me a glass of orange juice . 
 Oh , it is nice and cold , definitely good orange juice . 
 Oh , sorry again , thank you mom . 
 You've decided that you definitely want to purchase this particular one ?

 Of course , Sir . If I could have your details again and your ID , I'll check them and we can go on .

 A movie sounds good . 
 I will see you tomorrow . 
 Yes , I noticed that . To what extent would local assembly help sales , did you say ? 
 Yes , of course . Assembly would be quite a simple matter . Cycle dealers could put them together in a very short time . 
 Yes , I've noticed that . Where have you been placing them ? 
 Yes . What were they ? Anything that will help sales ? 
 That's to keep the price down , I suppose . I'll take it up with our overseas department and listen to what they've got to say about this . 
 Please bring your baggage here for inspection . 
 Is all your baggage here ? 
 Have you got anything to declare ?

 Are you absolutely sure , Mr Zu ? You know , you will lose interest if you do . 
 Let me run through a couple of other options with you . That way , you can make a more informed decision . 
 I have a problem . 
 I wrote a check for $ 100 and it bounced . 
 I think so . 
 Okay . Thank you . 
 You can ’ t be serious ! 
 I see . Thanks for your help . 
 I wouldn ’ t miss it for the world ! It ’ s sure to be fun . She ’ s invited a lot of people . Do you think everyone will be able to get into her house ? 
 Are you taking anything ? 
 That ’ s a good idea . She told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks . I think it ’ s going to be a noisy party . I hope her neighbors don ’ t mind too much . 
 I ’ m really looking forward to it . This party is going to be a blast !

 Show me some classic high heels , please . 
 Black . Classic . 
 Umm . too shiny . And I wear pantyhose with my shoes so let ’ s look for a closed-toe shoe .

 Seven-and-a-half . 
 Hmmm.Not good . They ’ re too tight.The length is right , but the shoe is too narrow and it ’ s pinching my toes . And there ’ d be no room for my insoles . You know what ? I don ’ t think I have the patience fo

 Well , what did you think about the last candidate ? Do you think we should hire her ? 
 What made you think that she wasn't very confident ? 
 She was a bit nervous , I guess . What else ? 
 You're right . If she walked into meeting with our clients like that , it would make our company look bad , wouldn't it ? 
 I agree . I guess I was paying more attention to her answers than her body language . 
 That's true . I guess we ’ ll have to keep looking for a manager then .

 Thanks for your understanding . 
 What are our areas for growth ? What sectors do you see the most potential in ? If we are going to pull our sales numbers up and develop the brand , we got to work across the board . 
 I don't see why we can't work on opening new markets and developing the markets we've already penetrated at the same time ... Both aspects of developing our customer base and developing our brand are important . 
 What does it do ? 
 Wow ! What else does it do ? 
 Cool ! Anything else ? 
 Wow ! 
 Man , that's amazing . It must have cost a bundle . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 I'd like to . How do you like the hat ?

 You should emphasize fresh fruits and vegetables , along with whole grains and protein . 
 You need to avoid highly fatty and greasy foods . You should also avoid too much sugar and caffeine . 
 You need to get plenty of exercise every day . If you smoke , you need to stop . 
 Actually , studies have shown that people who have one-half a glass of alcohol per day do better than those who don ’ t drink . 
 I'm afraid I can't . 
 Well , my car won't start . I don't know what's the matter with it . 
 No , I don't think it could be . I checked the battery two days ago.It must be other problems . 
 No , there is plenty of gas . I filled it up yesterday . 
 Yes , that's possible . 
 First of all , I hope to spend a few years working in some famous companies to command a skill , to set a solid foundation and to build my interpersonal network . When I feel I have accumulated enough experience , I hope to own an undertaking . Of course this is up to the situation then and the opportunities the companies offer me . In the long run , I hope to be an entrepreneur .

 Oh , it ’ s right downstairs . I'm going there myself . Just follow me .

 You ’ re welcome . What ’ s the problem ? 
 Where exactly is the pipe ? 
 How long has the pipe been leaking ?

 That won ’ t be a problem ? 
 All right , I will start working now . 
 I'm not feeling well , doctor . I have a sore throat . 
 Yes , my back aches . 
 It began the night before last . 
 Lots of people are ill at the moment . 
 Is there a problem , officer ? 
 I'm sorry , I didn't even notice it . 
 I honestly couldn't see it because of the bushes growing over it . 
 I swear that I didn't mean to run it . 
 Are you going to give me a ticket today , sir ?

 That's okay . Well , let me think . How about a mystery novel ? 
 There are a number of science fiction and fantasy novels I can recommend .

 When will we get one of those ? 
 Now please tell me something about your achievements in your work unit . 
 Have you received any other honors ? 
 Do you have anything published ? 
 Good morning , I am Monica . Are you Mr . White , the manager of finance department ? I am the newcomer and also working in the finance department .

 I need something to eat , please . 
 I feel like champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare .

 Just the champagne will be fine , thank you . 
 That's fine . 
 Could you give me some advice ? 
 It feels all right . But if it were a darker color , I will like it better .

 For what purpose exactly , if you don't mind me asking ? I must ask because I need to know the size , you see .

 Hello , I am calling about my cable service . 
 For the past week my cable hasn't been working . 
 Do you know when it is going to start working again ? 
 Will I still have to pay for the cable while it's not working ? 
 So I don't have to pay anything ? 
 Okay , thank you very much for your help . 
 Shall we have some soup first ? 
 Ok , and what about the main course ? Which would you rather have fish or meat ? 
 Don't you like fish then ? 
 Shall we have some white wine then ?

 I got a promotion at my job . 
 Seriously , I am so excited . 
 Thank you .

 You think so ? 
 Can you suggest a few exercise to help me get fit and stretch my muscles a little ?

 So I need plenty of space for this exercise . 
 Great . Thanks for you advice ! 
 Why ? It looks like a sunny day .

 Yes , but I need the report copied on transparency paper . 
 Open the book and turn to page 10 . 
 No , honey , it's easy if you know the way . 
 No , honey , try to make notes in your notebook . 
 I wanted to check rates and availability for your San Francisco location . 
 The waterfront location . 
 I'd like to check in on October 12th and check out the 15th .

 Merry Christmas , sweetie . How's your brother enjoying Taiwan ? 
 No ! Christmas without him is bad enough . So , honey , do you have cold feet yet ? 
 You're not coming ? 
 I'm afraid not . The church is booked until the year 2001 . 
 We'll have to . We'll rehearse on the 1st and have the wedding on the 2nd . 
 Don't worry , dear . I'm a great host . Now get some rest . Merry Christmas . 
 I love you , too . And forgive Jack . He's doing his best . 
 Are you ready ? 
 Ready for the big switch . 
 The nation is switching to digital TV . 
 Did you buy the converter ? 
 How much was that ? 
 Does it pick up any digital channels ? 
 Martin ? Did you remember to bring back that software I lent you ? 
 That ’ s okay , Martin . If you could just bring it in tomorrow , I ’ d appreciate it . 
 Do you have any certificates on computer ? 
 How did you get it ? 
 Where do you see yourself three years from now ? 
 Good answer , B - good answer ! Seriously , though , are you interested in staying in a staff-level position , or would you hope to move into management someday ? 
 Where did you get these peanuts , Mike ? 
 Thanks ! 
 Is there any particular size that you want ? 
 What do you think of this one ? It's a 16 " pan . 
 Well , look at our aluminum pan . It's much lighter . 
 No problem . Look at this one . Same pan , but with a lightweight wooden handle . 
 I think you'll love this pan . Do you want to pay with cash ? 
 I'm sorry . I forgot to show it to you . Here it is . It comes with the pan . 
 Yes , please . 
 Beef , please . 
 I like lamb , but my husband doesn't . 
 Give me that piece please , and a pond of meet , too . 
 No , thank you.My husband likes steak , but he doesn't like chicken . 
 Do you think this blouse really suits me ? 
 Not too tight in the waist ? 
 Hello ! Can I help you ? 
 Oh , it's the high time for you purchasing in our clothes shop . We are now having a preseason sale on all our winter apparel . 
 Every thing for winter is 20 % off . 
 Sure , we have both skirts and trousers that would look well with the sweater . Look at this section . 
 You have a good taste . It's very much in style this year . 
 Look on the rack to the right . 
 It's ok . 
 Just kids like that . 
 Hurry up ! Hurry up ! What lovely caterpillars are over there ! 
 What's that ? 
 That's splendid . Can you take three pictures of me with them ? 
 Cut it out . Look at my smile , and it seems like the flowers in the spring . Right ? 
 Hurry up ! The smile is frozen on my face . 
 Hello . Mr . Higgins , please . 
 Oh yes , this is Penny's Pet Boutique . Please remind him that his appointment for his dog's shampoo and cut is on Saturday morning at 11 am . 
 That's fine . 
 good morning . How can I help you ? 
 have you filled out an application form ? 
 yes . I'll just have my assistant look over these quickly and then we'll move on to the next step . Did you want to open up a checking account and a savings account ? 
 yes . Actually , both accounts come with cards that you can use in ATM machines , so that you won't have to come in to the bank to make a transaction . 
 it is . Our customers really like it . Do you have any other questions about your new accounts ? 
 the maximum is $ 1000 . 
 yes , but it's not much . You just have to pay 1 % interest on the amount . It's much lower rate than any of our loans and it's much better than owing money to most credit cards . 
 they're all in order . If you just sign your name here , you'll receive your cards and pin numbers in the mail in about three weeks . 
 you're welcome . 
 Certainly . There are several kinds of music . What do you like to listen to ? 
 OK , here it is . Can you hear it ? 
 The last one clockwise . 
 May I help you , sir ? 
 What color do you want ? 
 What size are you ? 
 No problem . I think 40 will be fine for you . 
 Of course . The fitting room is this way , please . 
 Yes , I've found a wonderful property I wish to buy . Unfortunately , I just don't have access to the cash . 
 It's 600,000 RIB . But I've already put down 200,000 RIB , which is my absolute limit , so I'm looking for a loan of 400,000 RIB . 
 I already have an account with you , so it should be pretty straight forward . 
 Do you have any other questions ? 
 Which fees ? 
 You will be required to pay a small fee for every time you overdraft . 
 You'll have to pay $ 25 every time you overdraft . 
 It should stop you from overdrafting . 
 Can I help you with anything else ? 
 Who's it for ? 
 May I take the liberty to introduce myself to you ? My name is Dick Brown . I am the sales manager of our company . 
 How do you do ? 
 Sure . I suggest you take a bus there . It's a bit too long for you to walk there . 
 Tour 2 . 
 It opens at 9:00 from April to October . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Let me see ... the train to New York City ... here it is ... daily except Sunday at 10,30 , 12,20 and 15,10 . 
 Sorry , not before 10:30 . 
 One way or round trip ? 
 A soft seat or hard one ? 
 $ 15.And for a hard one , only $ 6 . 
 OK.Here is your change.The train leaves on platform 8 . 
 Under which category do you intend to apply ? 
 So that's the Family Reunification . 
 OK . When should we be there ? 
 All right , if there's no hold-ups . 
 Looks not bad . 
 Yes , It's pleasantly quiet here . 
 Where can we have our laundry done ? 
 Does the hotel run its own laundry service ? 
 I see . Is the telephone on the table good for outside calls ? 
 Can I get a city map at the hotel ? 
 Shogun Restaurant of Pasadena . 
 I can help you if you can just tell me what evening you like the reservation for . 
 What time do you think that you would like to have dinner ? 
 How many diners will be in your group ? 
 I have a table for four available at 7 
 Mr . Foster , we will be expecting you this Tuesday at 7 
 Waitress ! My bill for today's lunch , please . 
 How much do I owe ? 
 Here is 200 yuan . The charge is for you . 
 Goodbye . 
 Please , call me Ted . 
 That ’ s no problem . 
 Well , what kind of salary do you provide ? 
 I see . 
 Sounds fine . 
 I've got a headache . 
 No , thank you . I'll take an aspirin and see how it goes . 
 Yes . 
 Nothing . The landlord pays . 
 Yes . Each apartment has one . 
 Yes . But you need to pay $ 60 for it each month . 
 Yes . We set up the new alarm system a few months ago . 
 Of course we do . It is the landlord ’ s responsibility . 
 Yes . 
 I'm sorry , sir , we don't have one . However , in our gym , we do have swim stations . 
 Think of a deep bathtub that you can swim in , but against a current . 
 Sir , guests pay nothing to use the stations . 
 The gym is open 24/7 , but the stations are open from 7 a . m . to 10 p . m . only . 
 I think you'll like the experience , sir . It's a great workout . 
 Yes , speaking . What can I do for you ? 
 Pardon ? Your way of articulating is too slow . Would you speak a little faster ? 
 I have been yearning for a job as a stewardess in an airline like yours . 
 Yes . I once worked in a small stock exchange . My work is very simple . 
 No , I thought it too dull . Also I didn't think it was challenging enough . 
 The stock exchange where I worked was too small My further promotion was impossible . I am able of more responsibilities , so I decided to leave . 
 I think we'll send you a letter next week , if you are wanted , or we may give you a call . By the way , have you got a telephone ? 
 What's the best time to call you , then ? 
 Thank you for coming , Miss Yang . 
 Can I help you , madam ? 
 I see . Do you have any ideas so far ? 
 Sure , madam . But may l know how old he is ? 
 And the height ? 
 I see . How about this one ? It's very fashionable and popular among teenagers . 
 How about this one then ? 
 Honey , which hand should I use to hold the fork ? 
 Got it . It's so troublesome to have western food . I've been learning the table manners for hours but still can't really it . 
 Yeah . Which restaurant are we going to tonight ? 
 Fine . I believe in Cindy's taste . Oh , what should I wear ? 
 I don't want to mess it up . Please do it for me . I'm going to the bank to cash some money . How much do we need ? 
 Honey , you are a good accountant . So I'd better leave that to you , too . 
 I'll take care of the order . 
 Don't forget about the dessert . 
 Excuse me , could you please turn on the air-conditioner , it's so hot here . 
 Aha , it's cool now . Can I keep the robot ? 
 I ’ m so hungry . Let me have a look at the menu . 
 Our company is going to do some cutbacks soon . 
 I met with the supervisor just this morning . I don't know , but I am a little worried . Who do you think will get sacked ? 
 No , it's not going to be George . I don't think it's Andy either . He is involved with the boss's sister in-law . And you know how whipped our boss is . 
 Lisa ? No way . I've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . You know rumors can't come out from nowhere . 
 No , that would be crazy . But then who will it be ? Oh dear , it must be me . I should have known it ! Why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . What should I do ? I've got a family to support . 
 How do I make a good impression in the interview ? 
 Anything else ? 
 What do you mean by this ? You can ’ t do the two things at the same time . 
 I see . 
 You ’ Ve given me very valuable advice and I have more confidence in myself now . Thank you very much . 
 Jason . There ’ s a snag in the plans for the Hoover Center . 
 Well , it was . But the contractor ’ s just told me he ’ s not going to be able to finish by the twentieth , as planned . 
 How were you getting along with your studies ? 
 In addition to your major , did you have other fields to study ? 
 Excuse me , what's the charge for a picture ? 
 That's great . Give me the landscape of the Triumphal for the background . 
 What can I do for you today ? 
 Which classes ? 
 Would you like to make an appointment ? 
 You need to sign the paperwork . 
 When can you come in ? 
 I'll schedule you for then . 
 The tea smells good . What tea is it ? 
 What's special about it except its pleasant smell ? 
 They must have some special methods to do this during the process . 
 Then , do you have “ tea time ” every day ? I mean , do you drink tea at a settled time ? 
 What's the advantage about tea ? 
 Does that mean the stronger the better ? 
 Got it . What's the proper time for tea ? 
 Why ? 
 Next please ! Hello sir , may I see your passport please ? 
 Will you be checking any bags today . 
 I ’ m sorry , sir . Airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage , at twenty kilograms each , plus one piece of carry-on luggage . I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase . 
 I am sorry , sir , there ’ s nothing I can do . You cannot board the flight with that large bag either.Carry - on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat . That bag is clearly too big . 
 Let ’ s see ... six hundred and twenty-five US dollars . 
 Hi , Mr . Brown , we have visited the factories and I'm very satisfied with your factories production conditions . 
 That's very good . But I have little knowledge about the packing of your pliers . I just want to know the details about that . 
 Sure . 
 Oh , the packing looks very nice . 
 Good , what about the export packing ? 
 Is the wooden case strong enough for transportation ? You see , 100 boxes of pliers are very heavy . It's about 2,400 kilograms . 
 I'm glad to hear that . By the way , do you accept neutral packing ? 
 Very good . Ok , Mr . Brown , I'm now totally satisfied with your packing . You can execute our first order now , and I will open the L / C immediately after I return to Taipei . 
 Can you do me a favor ? 
 Can you keep an eye on my bag , please ? Nature's calling . 
 No , I just want to use the bathroom . 
 Did you ever get your bus pass ? 
 Why not ? 
 Actually , it'll save you money . 
 Because you can use your bus pass as many times as you want . 
 Yeah , and you never have to worry about scraping for change . 
 Yeah , So , are you going to buy one ? 
 Did you see the robbery ? 
 Did you see everything ? 
 What exactly did you see ? 
 Did you get a good look at his face ? 
 Was anyone else with him ? 
 Could you come to the station for more questioning ? 
 Dai Ling . 
 Very well , thank you . 
 Can you bring me a glass of orange juice , please ? I am quite thirsty . 
 Wow , you're right . Everything is absolutely delicious . Please pass the pepper . 
 They're soft . 
 No more , thank you . 
 Bottom is up . 
 What would make this apartment better for you ? 
 You can have a different carpet , but you have to pay more if it costs more . 
 It could vary quite a bit , between 2 and 10 dollars per square yard . 
 I have to see a sample . Bring me one this week , please . 
 Both the new paint and new carpet will be finished by next week . 
 Yes , I'm sure you do . It sounds like an excellent service . 
 It seems perfect . 
 Could you also let me view some of the testimonials ? I'd really be interested to see what other group companies thought of this service . 
 Yes . I just checked in , but I need to change my room . 
 I reserved a non-smoking room , but the smell of smoke in this room is so strong that I can ’ t endure it . 
 That ’ s ok . Thanks . 
 Sony or some other brands ? 
 No , it's free . 
 Hello , this is David . 
 Hi , is that Jessica ? 
 I want to inform you of the interview . 
 I said I am informing you of the interview . 
 How does she cook the shrimp ? 
 I don't like that . I like fried food , fried potatoes , fried chicken , fried sausage ... I can't see why fried food is not healthy . 
 It's all right ! I often fry sausages when my mom is not at home . 
 Come to my house this Sunday . My mom will not be at home then . We can cook some wonderful fried food by ourselves ! 
 What's the matter , Paul ? 
 So , what are you going to do ? 
 I'm sorry , but I really need it this afternoon . 
 Sure . That's no problem . 
 Here you go . Anything else ? 
 I'd like a facial . 
 Which would you recommend ? 
 What does it included ? 
 Does it include facial mask and massage ? 
 Will it exfoliate the skin as well ? 
 That sounds great . 
 I was worried where you were . 
 Yes , you should have . 
 Don ’ t touch that thermostat ! You don ’ t pay the bills around here ! 
 Put on a sweater ! I ’ m not gonna let you run up my heating bill just because it ’ s a bit chilly . 
 When I was your age , my parents didn ’ t have central heating like you do ! We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it . We used it to cook , heat the house and even dry our clothes ! We never caught a cold . You should be grateful ! 
 Air mail or surface mail ? 
 Please put it on the Scale there . Seventy five cents . 
 Oh , then it'll be one dollar twenty five cents . Thank you . 
 My home phone , the landline . I don't have a mobile phone , far too complicated for an old lady like me ! Do you need my Bank Book ? 
 Let's get started . First , select the service you require . That's household bill payment for you . Then we select the type of bill , so that's landline ... here you go . Your bill for this month comes to 87.42 RIB . The money will come out of your account and go straight to the phone company . 
 Let's start to study how to use computers , Paler . It's good to know that a computer has two major parts , the hardware and the software . 
 The hardware of computer is basically all the concrete things you can touch with your hands and see with your eyes . 
 The software of computer is all the programmes inside the computer that allow you to use the computer to do things . 
 Right you are , Paler , and since what you want to learn is how to use software , we should also learn to refer to the computer menus . 
 I have a question about my cable . 
 I haven't been able to watch my cable for the past week . 
 Could you tell me when it will be back on ? 
 In the meantime , do I still have to pay for the cable ? 
 Does that mean I won't have to pay for it ? 
 Thanks , I appreciate your help . 
 I would like to ask for one day off next week . Do you think the manager will agree ? I know it is the busy time for our company , but I do have some important things to handle . 
 Actually , it is my mother ’ s wedding . My parents divorced many years ago . Now she is ready to establish a new family . It is a special occasion . I ’ Ve got to be there , right ? 
 Thank you so much . 
 Hello . Is Steve there ? 
 What time will he be back ? 
 This afternoon ? 
 This is his friend , Greg . 
 Thanks . 
 Certainly sir , this is our train schedule . We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm . 
 About twelve hours . We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . If you ’ d like , you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive . 
 Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers . 
 Here you are sir . Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot . Remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train ! 
 Have a great trip . 
 Yes , ma ’ am . How may I help you ? 
 Yes , we do deliveries for orders over $ 15 , ma ’ am . 
 It has fifty parking spaces . 
 Why ? 
 Quite the contrary , sir . Plenty of the spaces here are free when people drive their cars out to work . 
 We plan to rent some of them out at the hourly rates . 
 I am not sure . But it'll be at least ten yuan an hour . 
 That would be twenty yuan , sir . We charge only by the number of hours , no split of each hour . 
 Ouch ! The water's too hot ! 
 I'm not hungry , Mom . 
 Oh ... I'm sweating already . It's so hot . I can feel it boiling ! Can I get out yet ? 
 I'd like to help pitch in with dinner . 
 No . I'd like to do something special for you on your birthday . 
 OK ... Now how can I help , hon ? 
 Easy . I could do that with my eyes closed . ( after a while ) Done . 
 How many potatoes do you need ? 
 Gotcha ... OK . Here they are . 
 Where's the peeler ? 
 Sword , say it ' sword ' . 
 Look it up in the dictionary . 
 No , honey , go and read it . You'll learn . 
 Oh , hi again ! Hey , the fruit looks different this time . 
 It looks really artistic ! How did you learn to do that ? 
 You know , art is something I've always been interested in ... 
 I hate to be the bearer of bad news , but it's that time of year again . Have you got your performance evaluations finished yet ? 
 Well , you do still have three weeks . But remember the employee must sign them , too . Filling them in is nothing - it's meetingwith the employees that takes so much time . 
 So it's the subjective criteria like team building and colleague support that you find hard ? 
 I suggest letting each employee fill out his or her own evaluation for those items . Then , based on their self - assessment , you can add your comments . It's a great starting point for discussion 
 Good morning , Mr . Zhang , this is Jimmy calling from Polaroid Company . 
 I regret to tell you that the position of Sales Manager has gone to another person . 
 We really believe that you are a highly qualified person . But the other candidate has several years of related experiences . 
 We surely believe you . 
 I am afraid we are sticking to our choice . 
 OK . 
 Yes , would you please call me a taxi first ? 
 Credit card please . Here you are . 
 I've had good responses from the Beijing Times , help-wanted ads . 
 OK . Monday is the big day for job ads . 
 Let's post on the Internet , too . Will get a better response . I'll post the ads . I know some good sites . 
 Vancouver is the third largest city in Canada . 
 There are many famous places such as Robson Street , Stanley Park , Gaston , Lion Gate Bridge , The Vancouver Art Gallery , and The Canadian Crafts Museum . 
 What's wrong with it ? 
 Let me see . Did you change anything on your computer ? 
 What kind of anti-virus software do you use ? 
 Are you riding ? You have to install an anti-virus software on your computer . If not , you will be attacked by viruses , and it can lead your computer into failure . 
 I can't believe it 。 
 I have no idea . Maybe I want to take a boat down the river . 
 Won't it be dangerous ? 
 That's better . 
 Oh , no.You should take the No . 14 tram . 
 Two blocks down the street . 
 Yes , what seems to be the problem ? 
 I am afraid not . Have you lost your passport ? 
 Where exactly did you use your passport in the store ? 
 Well , let me call the shoe department to see if they ’ Ve found a passport . Sorry , your passport hasn't turned up there either . 
 You can fill in this lost property report and I will keep my eye out for it . These kinds of things usually turn up eventually , but I suggest you contact your embassy and tell them about your situation , so they can issue you a new passport in case it doesn't show up . 
 Here you are . 
 Greetings should never be ignored in the interview . 
 Appropriate greetings will win the interviewer's favorable impression 
 In the beginning of the interview , greet the interviewer with a kind smile . 
 That's right . Details can mean succeed or fail . 
 At the end of the interview , you should make your acknowledgements and say Goode . 
 Only in this way can you leave a good impression on the interviewer . 
 Nathan said he didn't have any fun at his new school this week . Do you know why ? 
 He really misses his friends from our old neighborhood . 
 How do you propose to help him understand that ? 
 I guess we could go visit once in a while too . 
 Does it look too big ? 
 Yes , I like it . I'm going to get it . 
 Here's my credit card . 
 Yes . Here you are . 
 Excuse me , haven't we met somewhere before ? 
 Oh , I see.Glad to see you here . 
 Excuse me , can you tell me where Main Street is ? 
 Is it far ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 hello ? 
 good morning . 
 oh . I had hoped she would have called me back yesterday . 
 is there someone else I can talk to ? 
 any time after 2 pm today would be good for me . 
 I'd prefer to speak with Ms . Fonda . 
 that will be fine . 
 Hello , Madam . What can I do for you today ? 
 OK , can I see the note and some ID , please ? 
 You do realise that you must pay a 0.2 % charge for premature cancellation , right ? 
 Unfortunately , yes . You see , this is a three-year note ; it was issued over a year ago , but not over two years . So , you will have to pay . I'm sorry about that . 
 I've got a terrible pain in my stomach , Doctor . 
 It started yesterday . I didn't eat any supper . 
 I think so . I feel very hot . 
 I've got an awful headache , too , and my throat hurts . 
 Is it serious ? 
 How often must I take it ? 
 Thank you , Doctor . 
 How much would you like ? 
 A higher discount will be given for a big order , so we are willing to give you a 5 % discount this time . 
 Of course I know . But there is too high a rate . Frankly speaking , the maximum discount we can make is 6 % . 
 Well , I think you are very good at doing the dishes , so maybe you should do them for another week . 
 OK , I'll do them . 
 Let me get my morning coffee to get my brain working again . 
 As long as the foam on my macchiato's not burnt , too , I'll be alright for a while . You got your espresso , Jess ? 
 Yes . You will save 90 cents on each bag . 
 No , no limit . You can take as many as you want . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 I'm sorry to hear that . Please tell me the exact problem . 
 There has been an occasional silverfish in the hotel , sir . 
 Sir , this hotel just passed a thorough insect inspection with flying colors . 
 I apologize , sir . Just a second , while I transfer you to my supervisor . 
 Certainly sir . 
 Actually there ’ s one on the same street as this hotel . 
 Not at all . Turn left out of the hotel and it's about a five minute walk . 
 Yes . Do you have a savings account in our bank ? 
 How long do you want to keep it in our bank ? 
 You have to fill in this form with your name , address , ID card number , deposit term and the amount you want to deposit . 
 Don't worry . You can draw your money at any time . But you'll not receive the time deposit return of interest . What we can offer is a current one . 
 In that case , we'll just regard your account as a regular savings account from then on . 
 Here we are . This is Wangfujing Street . 
 25 yuan , please . 
 Thank you . Here ’ s your change and receipt . 
 The post office ? Sorry , I'm not sure . 
 I'd like to speak with the apartment manager , please . 
 I'm interested in the apartment on Main Street . 
 Yes , I would very much like to see it . 
 I have no problem with 6 p . m . 
 No , thanks . I already drove by to see what the neighborhood looks like . 
 Should I bring anything with me ? 
 Has everything been OK with you lately ? 
 Have you been too busy to get enough sleep ? 
 How late do you try to go to sleep ? 
 Has anything in your day-to-day life been bothering you lately ? 
 You might consider listening to relaxing music as you go to sleep to clear your head . 
 Liz , you were supposed to have had those contracts typed up by now . 
 No , Liz . I asked you specifically . Don ’ t you remember ? 
 Strange looking handle on that coffee mug , isn't it ? 
 What's the advantage ? Price , I suppose . 
 What deliveries are you quoting nowadays on orders such as ours ? 
 You don't do much in porcelain tiles and ornaments , do you ? 
 I see . Well , keep up the good work . See you later . 
 Hi , Mary . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve got a meeting in a minute . 
 Right . I ’ ll see you later . 
 Tell me something about yourself and your past experience . 
 What experience have you had that qualifies you for this position ? 
 What attracted you to this job ? 
 What qualities do you think are important to this position ? 
 When have you been most motivated ? 
 Why did you leave your last position ? 
 What are your salary expectations ? 
 Do you have any questions ? 
 Good afternoon , Peace Hotel , what can I do for you ? 
 Yes , that's right . Your room is a single one with a bath . 
 Fine , we will cancel it . 
 Where is that ? 
 Are you in a hurry ? 
 We'll make it except a jam.You know it's rush hour . 
 I'll do my best . 
 Do you have small bills ? 
 Here is your receipt.Thank you . 
 I'm going to Beijing tomorrow . I'm packing my luggage . 
 I will take some clothes to change and cleaning items . 
 Yes . I've already put it in my suitcase . 
 I almost forget it . Thank you ! 
 No , sir . Where to ? 
 OK . Please step in . I know where it is . 
 Not back home for dinner again ? That ’ s the third time this week ! 
 You don ’ t have to explain . Suit yourself . 
 We ’ ll see . 
 Ah ! No ! Damn it ! 
 So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work . 
 No , I didn't save this time.Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too . 
 I hate computers . Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth . 
 I don't know . I feel like going out . 
 It doesn't matter . I still can go out and buy a beer . 
 Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework.This is a bad time for this to happen . 
 Thanks . I think I will try . Where are you going ? 
 Maybe we can trade.Why don't you stay here and read for my exam , and I'll go drink beer ? 
 So ? You can go to the class for me.Just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . Why not ? 
 About fourteen . 
 Damn ! 
 You've got a large collection of sample foodstuffs here . 
 I'm particularly interested in shortbreads . Do you have some samples you could show me ? 
 The small sizes are more marketable than the large ones for us . I wonder if Your pastry tastes better . 
 Oh , it's delicious ... 
 A tow truck was towing my car and put all those dents in my car . 
 They're saying it was already there . 
 I have to go to court . A cop was there so he can prove that the damage wasn't there . 
 I got an estimate and it's four thousand dollars . 
 We'll see what happens after court . 
 Of course , what do you need ? 
 Is there something else you need that you can think of ? 
 Do you want me to make any other stops while I'm out ? 
 Is it ready to be picked up ? 
 No problem . I'll do that for you . 
 It's no problem at all . 
 Zina . Look , I know when I hired you , I told you I'd pay you a salary . But I just can't . 
 I know it's awkward , but you're going to be thanking me later . I'm going to make you rich . 
 How often do you use the internet ? 
 Yes . I use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . It can be frustrating when the connection is poor . 
 Yes , I like the job though . Sometimes , I help other people in the office if they ’ re having trouble online . 
 I think it ’ s fairly useful , but there are two big problems . First , a lot of the information you find online is false . Second , when you buy something online , you don ’ t see it until you actually get it . 
 What I do is find the website of shops . Then someone from our company visits the shop and buys when they ’ re seen that the products are genuine and suitable . 
 My favorite movie is Superbad . 
 It's the funniest movie that I've ever seen . 
 You've seen it before ? 
 Didn't you laugh through the whole movie ? I did . 
 Mine too . 
 Sure , let's go . 
 Yes , I am . Could I have the bill , please ? 
 Do you accept check ? 
 Well , I'd like to pay by cash . 
 Thanks . 
 I plan to add an introductory letter behind the resume to increase the probabilities of success in the interview . 
 I'm not sure of that . Do you know ? 
 Yes , I think so , too . I must introduce myself in truth . 
 So I should write my strengths in the introductory letter , especially those related to the work . 
 You are very nice to tell me those . 
 Thank you ! 
 I understand . 
 Some days are just like that . 
 No , I was thinking of putting a frozen pizza in the oven or something . How about you ? 
 I'm absolutely useless at cooking ! 
 I know they aren't good for you , but they are cheap , convenient , and fairly tasty . 
 Yeah , why not . Do you have all the ingredients ? 
 What do we do first ? 
 Ok . Should I heat the wok ? 
 What about the chicken ? 
 How about the rice ? 
 White rice , please . None of that healthy brown stuff for me ! 
 All right , sir.When are we supposed to be there ? 
 Can you effect shipment during September ? 
 Then when at the earliest can we expect the shipment ? 
 It's too late . You see , in our market October is the season for the kind of commodity . So the goods must be shipped before October or we won't be ready for the season . 
 Thanks . Then may I suggest that you put down in the contract ' shipment on September 15 or earlier ' ? 
 Oh , that's very considerate of you . I'lI take your word for it . 
 I consider the hero's acting is inferior to that of the heroine's . don't you agree ? 
 Good afternoon , can I help you ? 
 I'm Kristy . Can I help ? 
 Oh , yes . Hello Mr Simons . I have some information about your L / C amendment . The negotiating bank has just informed us that the 3rd party does not wish to accept the amendment . 
 I'd recommend going back to the 3rd party , personally this time , and discussing what exactly it is they aren't happy with . Hopefully you can reach some sort of agreement , which is viable for everyone . 
 I feel like a cup of black tea . 
 Yes , I'd like a portion of that strawberry tart . 
 First you add the washing powder then you add the clothes . 
 Yes , for the last 20 years . 
 Good afternoon . May I help you ? 
 May I see your ticket and passport , please ? 
 Please put your baggage on the scale . 
 Thirty two kilos . 
 No . They aren't . 
 Sure . But please attach this claim tag . 
 Here is your boarding pass . 
 Gate Four . Please go and have a seat in the waiting hall . 
 I think I've got a virus on my computer . Do you know how to get rid of it ? I haven't had one before . 
 Have you got the number ? I'll call them right now . 
 What kind would you like ? 
 You can get DEL or dial-up . 
 I would recommend DEL . 
 It's better because it doesn't tie up the phone . 
 DEL isn't connected through your phone line , but dial-up is . 
 That's correct . With DEL you can do both . 
 I started a new job last month and I'm expecting my first salary . 
 So I was told , yes . They gave me this book ? 
 I wonder if you could do me a favor . 
 My printer is broken . Can you print up a copy for me ? 
 Please , you write much better than I do . 
 Were you late for work this morning ? 
 What did you say to your boss ? 
 Your boss was really nice . 
 Hello ! 
 I'm sorry , I'm afraid you've dialed the wrong number . There is no Petti here . 
 I'm sure you have the wrong number . This one has been my number for more than 20 years . 
 No , It isn't . It's 736-4565 . It seems you've misdialed . 
 That's all right . This sort of thing happens all the time to everyone . 
 No worries . 
 Let me see , Mr . Lee.right ? How would like to pay your bill ? 
 Yes . 
 Could you tell me a little about the organization ? For example , how big is your workforce here ? 
 I see . And how about the working hours ? 
 Well I am used to that , Mr . Parsons , so that ’ s not really a shock for me . 
 And when do you need to fill the vacancy , Mr . Parsons ? 
 That sounds ideal . 
 Hi , I have a checking account with you . 
 I need to see if check number 212 has cleared yet . 
 I'm calling about you appointment.Mr.Smith has to cancel all his appointments because he's got something urgent to attend to . 
 Anytime except today.Please give him a call before you come . 
 Hi , sir . Could you tell me where the Hilton Hotel is ? 
 Eh , let me see . Sorry , I can't remember it , because I've been there only once , accompanied by my friends . 
 A bookstore , probably . With a yellow and orange logo . 
 I remembered there is a very busy street several miles away . I waited for the traffic light for a very long time . 
 Oh , yeah , I got it , there is a bank My friend exchanged her money there . 
 Great ! Many thanks ! 
 No , thanks . I'm just looking . 
 Sure , I'll let you know if I need anything . Hm , this mattress is very firm . Jack will probably like it . 
 Yes , this mattress is very good . It's pretty firm . The mattress I ’ m now sleeping on is saggy . 
 Does it come with a frame ? 
 That's an attractive plan . I'll think about it . 
 I feel so good . That warm hot pot certainly hits the spot on winter nights . 
 Oooo ... gross ... you're sweating all over the place . 
 You're going to have a little Montezuma's revenge tomorrow morning . 
 There ’ s branch on new street . Walk up this street until you get to the first set of traffic lights . Then turn right at the traffic lights . 
 Now far . About 150 meters perhaps . 
 Then keep walking until you reach the war memorial . It ’ s a big statue of a soldier . You can ’ t miss it . 
 You ’ ll see the national bank near the war memorial . It ’ s a big building and you ’ ll see a big sign on the front of the building . 
 I am trying to see if I can afford to purchase a home that I wish to buy . 
 My wife and I earned one hundred and fifty thousand dollars last year . 
 I have been at my current job for 10 years . 
 I collect one thousand dollars a month from a rental property . 
 I try not to think about it ! 
 Why should I buy this MD player ? 
 What else ? 
 But how's the sound quality ? 
 Is that it ? 
 May I fix an appointment with Dr.Cui ? 
 When will it be convenient for her ? 
 How about ten o'clock tomorrow ? 
 Poor Danny . You are so enfeebled ! 
 Mom called just now saying that she and Dad will be back later . Do you want to speak to them on phone ? 
 Whatever . Have a drink of water . 
 Maybe later . I think we have a medicine-kit . 
 Probably on the of the cabinet . I'll go and get it . 
 Oh , here it is . Patulin . Oh , no ! 
 Keep lying down . The matter is that all the medicine here is past expiration . 
 I ’ m interested in teaching at your school . 
 Yes . 
 I have a TEFL certificate . 
 I have three years of teaching ESL and four years of teaching per-school children . 
 I got my TEFL certificate three years ago . 
 Well , I ’ Ve heard many good things about it . I also like teaching young children . 
 Yes , just a little . 
 I sure can . 
 I want to know whether you can handle the matters of registered permanent residence . 
 I have no other questions . Thank you . 
 You have done an excellent job this year and we are pleased with the results . 
 As a result of your performance , we are happy to offer you the position of manager . 
 Yes , it does . 
 Your monthly gross salary will increase by $ 500 . 
 Can you believe that Obama was actually elected ? 
 I hope you voted for him . 
 Of course ! 
 You do ? 
 Our country really could use some work . 
 I couldn ’ t agree more . 
 Hi , are you Catherine ? 
 Thanks , good to meet you , too . 
 Yes , and the food was horrible ! 
 Great ! How will we be getting there ? 
 Hello , Arthur . What seems to be the problem ? 
 Sounds like you may be far-sighted . OK , then cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you . 
 Wow , Arthur ! You ’ re as blind as a bat ! 
 Ok then , head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription . 
 Arthur , that ’ s the bathroom . 
 I don ’ t know where to get my ballot . 
 How can you help me ? 
 That ’ s great . 
 Here it is . 
 What do I do now ? 
 All right . Thanks for your help . 
 Yes , could you give me some ideas ? 
 Fine , it's the thing for me . I will take it . 
 Hello , Mr . Stern . This is Hao Bo from the International Travel Agency . I have made the plane reservations for you . 
 Okay . You'll be travelling on Northwest Airlines , flight number 222 . 
 It departs Guangzhou at 10:30 on the morning of July 10 . 
 You want to fly first class . Is that correct , Mr . Stern ? 
 Well , I have got you three first class tickets and I have reserved your seats . Your seat numbers are 8A , 8B and 8C . 
 Yes , they are . I have charged the tickets to your credit card . They are 630 dollars each , so It is 1890 dollars for all three . 
 One more thing . Could you give me the names of the people you'll be travelling with ? 
 All right . You're all set . Have a nice flight . 
 It has just occurred to me that there is still another possibility to ensure a prompt delivery of the goods . 
 How about making Hong Kong the port of shipment instead of New York ? 
 It's like this . There are only one or two ships sailing a month from New York to Osaka , while sailings from Hong Kong are quite frequent . If shipment were effected from Hong Kong , we could receive the goods much earlier . 
 Yes , exactly , because I want these goods on our market at the earliest possible date . 
 It sounds all right to me , but I will have to think about it . I'll give you a definite answer tomorrow . If I choose Seattle , will it be possible for you to ship the goods by the end of March ? 
 I ’ m so sorry to call you on such short notice , but something ’ s come up . 
 That ’ s right I ’ m afraid I have to postpone it . Mr . Scott got sick and I have to attend the Speechmaker ’ s Symposium in his place . I ’ m leaving today , and I won ’ t be back until a week from Friday . 
 That will be great . So it ’ s two weeks from tomorrow , same time and place . I ’ m really sorry to do this to you . 
 Would you show me some table-cloths ? 
 How much is it ? 
 That ’ s reasonable . 
 Really ? I ’ ll take it then . 
 With pleasure , chap . But before I start , I need to know what you want a bike for ? 
 Cycling during weekends ? Do you me riding on the mountainous countryside just the neighboring towns ? 
 Can't be greater . If you ride on bumpy , hilly roads , a mountain bike is what you need . But if you just ride comfortably along the city lanes , you might choose a road bike . 
 A road bike features skinny tires and a light-weight frame . Its riding position puts you bent over the handlebars . It's not particularly beefy in construction , and generally , it won't stand up well under heavy loads or on really rough surfaces . In contrast , mountain bikes have wide tires and a stout frame . You sit higher on them and don't have to hunched over . 
 Would mornings or afternoons be best for you ? 
 It is best if we can go during the week ; does that work for you ? 
 Would you like to meet at the real estate office , or should I pick you up at home ? 
 We could spend most of the day looking at houses to see all that we have to see . 
 I will fax you a schedule as soon as I contact the owners to confirm the times . 
 Please feel free to stay as long as you want . You know you ’ re always welcome here . 
 Is there anything else I can do for you before your leave ? 
 Don ’ t mention it . I ’ Ve really enjoyed your company . 
 Oh , yes . Step inside , will you ? I'll give you an idea of what business I want to take up with you . Take a seat . We can go into details later . 
 Our speciality back in South Africa is wholesale supplying of screws , bolts , nuts , pins , studs , and that kind of things . 
 For both . Now , do you make machines for producing such things ? 
 Yes , quite free until noon . 
 Have you ? That's splendid . Just let me get my things together . I won't keep you long . 
 Shit , so crowded ! 
 Things change every minute . 
 I'd like to have this shirt washed and ironed . 
 Yes , heavy starch in the collar please . 
 I also have a suit to be dry-cleaned . Can I fetch it the day after tomorrow ? It's urgent . 
 Could you please tell me when your laundry opens and closes ? 
 I see . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , it is . Kelly ? 
 Do you have a cold ? 
 Oh , no ! What about your presentation today ? 
 I understand . What should I tell Mr . Morley ? 
 Alright . Have you been to see a doctor ? 
 Do you think you'll be able to come in tomorrow ? Or should I call off your appointments for tomorrow too ? 
 It's rainy weather today . Maybe it's better if you just stay inside.Make yourself some chicken soup and sleep . 
 That bad , huh ? 
 Well , I'll cancel your appointments for today . And I'll tell Mr . Morley . 
 Hope you feel better . 
 Why don't you have any more money ? 
 That was a bright idea . 
 You know what ? I don't have any change for you . 
 Why don't you just ask the bus driver for a transfer ? 
 You know ? Go ask for a transfer . They're free . 
 You're welcome . 
 Why ? 
 Can you recognize Mike's father in the crowd ? 
 Let's run up and give him a hand . 
 I am going to see a movie with a friend of mine . What about you ? 
 Would you like to see a movie with me and my friend ? 
 I don't know , but was there a certain movie you wanted to see ? 
 Well , would you like to go ? 
 All right . Another time then . 
 I ’ m terribly sorry . May I have your order again ? I'll get it right away . 
 I'm sorry . I must have made a mistake . I'll bring them for you at once . 
 Pardon me , Miss . But didn't you order chicken soup ? 
 I believe so . But if it really bothers you , I'll replace it for you . 
 Sorry . I'm afraid we can't . But you may order something else instead . 
 Okay , Miss . 
 I hope you enjoy your dinner . 
 I ’ m fine . 
 I would like to cancel a check . 
 I wrote the check out for too much . 
 I wrote it out for $ 150 . 
 It was supposed to be for $ 100 . 
 I really appreciate your help . 
 It's my pleasure . Hope you ’ ll visit Beijing more often . 
 OK . I hope you have a good trip . Thanks ever so much for your cooperation , Mr . Simpson . Give my best wishes to Mr . Green . 
 Goodbye and all the best . 
 Bye . 
 Okay . What time is the meeting tomorrow ? 
 Pardon me . Please speak a little louder . 
 Sure . What else can I do for you ? 
 Thanks a lot . We arrived at Kaohsiung International Airport . 
 Sure , Liv , what can I do for you ? 
 You wanna take some time off , is that right ? 
 What dates are you planning on taking off ? I ’ ll need at least two months notice , so that I can plan for your absence . 
 Well , I guess so . 
 I'd like to buy some perform for my girlfriend . 
 she usually doesn't wear anything but a few drops of Chanel No . 5 . But I'd like to buy her a new Fragrance . 
 which one would you recommend ? 
 that smells great . I'll take one bottle , please . 
 it's ok . She normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder , and I wouldn't know what shade to buy . 
 she doesn't usually wear lipstick . She thinks it makes her nose look too big . 
 no thank you . She has big enough eyes as it is . 
 no thanks . Western women usually try to make their skin darker , no lighter . 
 that will be all . You're been very helpful , thanks . 
 What kind of room do you have in mind ? 
 Hold on , please . I'm afraid we're fully booked.The only room available at the moment is a suite . 
 What's wrong , Lisa ? You keep pacing back and forth . 
 Don't worry . You'll do fine . 
 I'll do my utmost if I am hired . 
 No , that thought doesn't cross my mind . 
 Yes please . I really am an absolute amateur when it comes to this stuff . 
 Forex registration ? 
 Could you please reserve a taxi for me ? 
 A private vehicle ? No , thanks , I won't need one . 
 T A X I , please . 
 Rockefeller Center . Can you get the taxi here immediately , please ? 
 Good . I'll get my coat and come downstairs . 
 I need to purchase some business cards . 
 I think 2,000 would be fine . 
 I want the new cards to be exactly like this card . 
 ... Okay , I'm done . Here's the form and my old card . 
 You know , I think it would be better if I could pick it up in three days . 
 I have read your notice on the wall so I come to see if there is anything I need . 
 How much is the desk ? 
 The goods in the yard sale are really cheap . I will take it . 
 Sure . It's very close actually.You go straight down this road . Then you turn left , at the next junction . 
 Bluemingdails is on the corner of that block . You see it as you turn left.Seriously , You can't miss it.It ' s enormous . 
 Steward ! 
 May I have a magazine or something ? 
 One in English , please . 
 Operator , I want to make a correct oversea phone call to Beijing . 
 Rachel Jason . 
 The code is 880 , the area code is 010 , and the local number is 8824578 4 
 Manicole Tan . 
 Ok , thank you . 
 Excuse me , when is the next train to Los Angeles ? 
 Can I get the ticket here ? 
 Thank you . 
 Yes . Hi , what's up ? 
 I'm afraid not . I'm sick . I have a fever but I'm cold , and I threw up earlier . 
 I would feel better if you came over and took care of me . 
 ( after a while ... ) Walter ! Where are you ? 
 What took you so long ? 
 It's not so bad . 
 It's just that you have to be patient and try to relax . 
 Why not ? Oh well , I'm ready to eat . No need call the doctor . If we run to the restaurant , I can make it to the restroom and you can order . 
 To the restroom ? I have no choice . 
 Hello , I'd like to speak to Mike please . 
 Hello , I'm afraid Mike's unavailable right now . He's in a meeting . Can I take a message ? 
 Sorry , could you repeat that please ? 
 Let me read that back to you , 123 456 789 , Mary from Happy Travel . I'll ask him to get back you as soon as he can . 
 Anything else ? 
 Bye . 
 I really would rather just listen . Isn't there anyone else who wants to sing ? 
 I know , but ... Hey , Jim's here ! I've been waiting to hear him sing all night . 
 I'll put the song at the front of the list . 
 Mmmm ... , it's hard to say . I like golf a lot-but I guess like skating better . 
 No , I'm strictly a spectator . I just like watching skating . It's so beautiful . 
 Are you aware of the reason why I pulled you over ? 
 I pulled you over because your brake light is out . 
 I have to write you a ticket . 
 I'm not going to be able to do that . 
 You'll find that out on your court date . 
 That's how it works . 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 OK , take a seat please , sir . First of all , can you show me your ID please ? 
 OK , could you please tell me what your backpack looks like ? 
 Mmm ... does it zip closed ? 
 OK , can you tell me the distinguishing features of this backpack ? 
 So what's it , sir ? 
 OK , can you name the items in it ? 
 OK , sir , I'm sure it's your bag . Thank you for your cooperation . You can have it now .

 do you like cooking , Julia ? 
 how often do you usually cook ? 
 that's a lot of cooking . You must save a lot of money by eating at home so much . 
 what kind of dishes do you usually make ? 
 do you make a lot of traditional British food ? 
 how about spicy food ? 
 what's your favorite dish to make ? 
 Excuse me . Does this train go to Brooklyn ? 
 Do you know when it leaves ? 
 I need to find a new furniture set for my living room . 
 I have no idea . 
 Where did you get it from ? 
 How much did it cost you ? 
 Is the furniture sturdy ? 
 I don't mind paying a lot as long as the quality is good . 
 I would like to make an offer on this house , but I don ’ t know much about the process . 
 I really like the house and will pay the full asking price of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars . 
 That sounds good , but I don ’ t want this house to get away from me . 
 When will we know if they accept the offer ? 
 Should I be contacting my bank in the meantime ? 
 Now let's talk about your interests and hobbies . 
 You have a colorful life . 
 How do you usually spend your time after work ? 
 What kind of books interests you most ? 
 You seem to be a man of imagination and logic . 
 If so , you can benefit a lot from them . 
 Actually , I was wondering what we should do if either one of us would like to terminate the contract ? 
 I got it , but nevertheless . what I was saying just now was that how to terminate the contract before its term's up ? 
 That sounds perfect for us . 
 Hello , Miao Ping . I'd like to open a Foreign Currency Account today . 
 I need to open a US dollar account , trade with America is going up each year . 
 Good , thanks . I look forward to hearing from you . 
 Yes , I'm missing a sweater . I sent it in the laundry yesterday , but my laundry was returned without it . 
 505 . 
 That's all right 
 But yesterday you said you would rent it . 
 Why is that ? 
 Maybe you ’ re right . 
 I need the police . 
 My neighbor hit my brother on the head . He ’ s bleeding . 
 176 Wooden Street East . 
 I will , but please hurry . 
 Could you do me a favor ? 
 Could you run over to the store ? We need a few things . 
 Well , could you pick up some sugar ? 
 A small bag . I guess we also need a few oranges . 
 Oh , let's see . . . About six . 
 Yes . We're out of milk . 
 No . I think a half gallon will be enough . 
 I think so . Have you got all that ? 
 Do you have enough money ? 
 Thanks very much . I appreciate it . 
 It ’ s about an hour ’ s drive . 
 I can ’ t promise , but I ’ ll do my best . 
 Yes , thank you very much . 
 Oh , is it ? 
 Yes , certainly , you have the receipt ? 
 Then would you kindly come to our shop with the receipt by 10 o'clock , we'll replace it . 
 Do you have any seats available ? 
 What's the special today ? 
 Then give me a large one and an egg drop soup . 
 Uncle Ben , how did the Forbidden City get this name ? 
 His residence ? You mean the whole palace ? 
 Oh , unbelievable . This was too luxurious . 
 OK , then . I love these unique structured towers with the delicate carvings on them . It's really artistic . 
 I agree . It's definitely a product of wisdom . Well , why were those small animal sculptures placed on the tops of the buildings ? 
 Why are there so many yellow things ? Is yellow the lucky color in China ? 
 Just like the pattern dragon , right ? 
 Oh , it's really fabulous . I wanna take a picture here . 
 May I help you , sir ? 
 Take a look at the ones on display , please . 
 Could I have the check , please ?
