Waiter ! 
 This is not what I asked for . I'm afraid . 
 Yes . What I ordered is roast beef , not roast beef sandwiches . 
 Mind your own business . 
 A month . Don't forget to return them by the due date . 
 Bring them back to the circulation desk and renew them . 
 Sure . 
 Sure , let's take a look at the menu first . 
 yes , we can look at the computer and computer menu at the same time . And this will help us understand both better . 
 Right now I'll teach you to open files , save files and copy files . Are you ready ? 
 Julia , look at me ! I'm gaining weight . How could I lose weight ? Do you have any good ideas ? 
 Are you sure ? 
 Really ? Does swimming have other advantages ? 
 That ’ s great . Okay , from now on I would swim three times a week . I hope I can get rid of the weight . 
 Has anyone told you about Jessica's party coming up ? 
 Is that right ? I already got my invitation from her earlier . 
 Are you even going to go ? 
 Exactly , it seems like it's going to be loads of fun . 
 The invitation says it starts at 8 
 I have no idea , she hasn't given out many though . 
 I got a promotion . Lunch is on me . 
 Bob refused all his classmates ' invitation . 
 He is surely a hard nut , nobody likes approaching him . 
 Excuse me . I wonder if you can help me . 
 I'm completely lost . I'm trying to find the way to my daughter's home . 
 Her home is between the China hotel and Li Sheng Theater . 
 I'm grateful to you . 
 Ok , let ’ s go through this one more time . I don ’ t want anymore ruined or dyed blouses ! 
 Right . You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . For example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . Also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing . 
 Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick . 
 No ! Since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes . 
 Will it be all right to visit you this evening ? 
 It's fine with me . 
 Well done . 
 Excellent job . 
 I'm very impressed . 
 Congratulations . You should be very proud of yourself . 
 I got a perfect look at the suspect . 
 That'll be easy . 
 Okay . 
 I see him . 
 The suspect is number four . 
 I'm happy to be of assistance . 
 I see . When are you travelling ? 
 Is that a return journey or just one-way ? 
 Ok . That will be 1400RMB please . 
 It ’ s about three hours . 
 sure . What kind of material do you want for the suit to be made from ? 
 that will probably be quite expensive , but the more you pay for the fabric , the longer it'll last and the better it'll look . What color do you want the suit to be ? 
 brown , huh ? Isn't that a bit dull ? 
 why don't you just get black ? Black suits are always fashionable and can be worn for anything — a funeral , a wedding , a job interview — anything ! 
 here are two different shades of brown . Which one do you prefer ? 
 how about this one ? 
 ok , let's go . 
 Ok I ’ Ve found it . Checking out on the 27th ? 
 Can I take a credit card for the deposit ? 
 Certainly madam . Here ’ s your key . Your room is on the 7th floor and on the left . Room 781 . Check out is at 12 noon . 
 Generally speaking , we provide bikes for both gentlemen and ladies , size 19 , 21 , 23 , 25 and 27 inches . We can vary the colors according to the buyer's requirements . Here are the catalogues and the pattern books . They will give you a rough idea about our products . 
 To be reliable is the strong point of our products . As a matter of fact , it's always our practice to supply high quality goods at reasonable prices . Flying pigeon is the best of its kind at the price . 
 Frank , I want your advice on something . Some scientists I met at the conference 6 this afternoon have invited me to a party . Actually , they called it an informal get-together . 
 When I asked how people were going to dress , Dr . Lite said it was casual . 
 Well , last night I went out with some journalists for a casual party , but I was overdressed . I wore what I consider casual - - an outfit of skirt , blouse , scarf , and medium heels ... you know . 
 Everyone else there was wearing blue jeans . Several of the women had on running shoes . I felt out of place . So I have no idea what to wear tonight . 
 Good evening , madam . May I help you ? 
 Yes , would you like smoking or non-smoking ? 
 No problem . Follow me , please . 
 I was supposed to do that ? I thought Sharon was responsible for that . 
 I ’ m really sorry , Mr . Samuel . I really don ’ t remember that . 
 She is going to get married . 
 I don ’ t know . 
 It's none of your business . 
 I'm going out anyway . Get out of my way . 
 The apples are 30NT each . How many would you like ? 
 They're 250NT each , but they're not edible . They're only used for worship . 
 Wait ! Don't go just yet . These bananas are pretty cheap--only 35NT for this bunch . 
 They're also good for your digestion ! Would you like some kiwis , too ? 
 They're imported from New Zealand . Four for 50NT . Nine for a hundred . 
 Laura , what are you going to do today ? 
 What time are you leaving ? 
 Will you buy a ham sandwich for me at the store ? 
 Do you have enough money ? 
 How much do you have ? 
 That's not very much . 
 Let me give you another ten dollars . 
 Bye . 
 I can't agree more , honey . We need to get away from work from time to time . 
 We are nor alone here . So many other families ! 
 Well , let's go over there and put a blanket on the lawn . 
 Oh , so heavy ! What have you put in here ? 
 Toys ? Why do we need toys for a picnic ? 
 Sure , then . May it really be a day of enjoyment . Other than that , we can also teach him something about science . 
 I mean we can inspire him for a deeper understanding of the natural world . 
 Well , OK . you are always right . 
 Well ... I told them not to come . I made a reservation just for the two of us . I thought we could have an quiet evening all to ourselves . 
 Jennifer , there ’ s something I wanna ask you . 
 Hmm ... okay , here ’ s the thing . I ’ Ve always seen you as more than just a friend , and I can ’ t take it any more . I know you better than anyone , I know the pros and cons of your personality , I even know what side of the bed is yours ! I think we would be great together , don ’ t you ? 
 I know ! I never had the guts to tell you ... until today . So , what do you say ? Are you willing to give me a shot ? 
 Hey Sandra , what's wrong ? You look furious ! 
 But Sandra ... you love your job ! You spent months trying to get this position . It's perfect for you ! 
 What kind of power struggles are you talking about ? 
 So he talks about you behind your back ? 
 I had a worker like that once . She was always taking credit for my ideas . 
 My co-worker had a whole bunch of bad office habits . She liked to name-drop ... we would be in a meeting and she would say , yesterday I was chatting with Tom . She meant Tom Solomon ... our CEO . 
 Yes . What's the problem ? 
 Oh , I am very sorry about that . It's our fault . I will arrange someone to correct it immediately . 
 Anyway , we apologize for the inconvenience we have brought you . Please just wait for a moment , and it will be fixed . 
 Matthew , do you know much about body language in countries around the world ? 
 Well , I had a meeting today with a woman from Japan and she wouldn't stop bowing ! I didn't know what to do ! 
 No , I tried to shake her hand , but her hand was so limp I was a bit offended . 
 But she was in America ! Shouldn't she have known that strong handshakes in America signify confidence and respect ? 
 Is that why she wouldn ’ t look at me in the meeting ? 
 The meeting really didn ’ t go down well at all . I think I need to read up about intercultural communication before I have another meeting with someone from another country . 
 That's so true . It's great that we see eye to eye on this . 
 Yes , May I help you ? 
 When did that happen ? 
 Is anything lost ? 
 OK , we will send some men as soon as possible . 
 OK , we will . What's your name and address ? 
 OK , got it . Please don't worry sir . We will be there soon . 
 Where should I sit ? 
 Okay . 
 It's Lin . It's spelled L-I-N . 
 My pronunciation is not very good . It's L-I-N , Lin . 
 Lin is a common Chinese last name . 
 I'm not sure . I promised to help my sister move Saturday . 
 I might be able to do that . But I don't think I can do it well . 
 OK . I'll talk to you later . 
 Surely not . Life in the university is fun . Why did you ask ? 
 Studying in the university is not easy , but it's not as arduous as you think . 
 Of course I know . I once attended Lisa's class , sitting quietly at the back of the classroom . 
 Of course not . You are allowed to attend any lecture , only if there are empty seats for you and you don't disturb the class . In universities , you study in a free and creative environment . 
 This question has really been bothering me . I like Chinese literature , you know . But economics is really hot now , and it has a very good career prospect . 
 Though I like Chinese literature very much , I'm also interested in economics . It's a tough choice to make . 
 Right . I have lots of time to think carefully before I make my final decision . 
 I'm number seven . What about you ? 
 Hah hah ! You have to go before me . 
 Don't worry . It's safe . 
 You are the one who wanted to come here , Sandy . You should enjoy it . 
 I'm not too scared . But I've done sky diving before . 
 I would like to make a deposit . 
 I ’ m depositing a check . 
 All right . Here you go . 
 That would be great . 
 I would like $ 150 . 
 Thanks for everything . 
 Of course we have . It's on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month . 
 It is said that the Cowherd and the Spinster , the lover stars in heaven , can only meet on the seventh Eve , so this day has become the Lover's Day . 
 I am not feeling all the great . I think I have that crud that is going around . 
 My boyfriend hasn ’ t been feeling so well . Maybe he passed it on to me . 
 Mostly , I feel like I need some rest and hot soup . 
 My grandmother thinks that honey and whiskey is a good cure for a cold . 
 If things don ’ t get better in a few days , I will look for some other solutions . 
 I'll try Chinese wine . 
 OK . Give me one , please . 
 Thank you . 
 Mike has changed much after marriage . 
 It ’ s unbelievable . He used to be such a rough guy . 
 Thank you for your consideration . We will inform you of our intention as soon as possible . 
 Michelle , Can you help me clean things up before we go ? 
 Which cup ? 
 Put it on the table . 
 Oh , that goes in the refrigerator . 
 Bring those upstairs and put them in the bedroom . 
 Give it to me . I need to use it . 
 You can throw that away . I don't need it anymore . 
 Alright , then please put it in a bag and take it outside . 
 I think we're finished . Can you please turn off the lights and shut the door ? 
 I just saw Something About Mary last night . It was hilarious . 
 What do you mean sick ? It was really funny , don't you think ? 
 Why not ? 
 It wasn't a dirty movie . There wasn't even any nudity . 
 Oh , you are too conservative . It's just realistic . 
 People think it's funny . 
 You mean the one with the yellow bricks ? But last time I saw it , it wasn ’ t really in business yet . I saw some people inside furnishing the rooms . Is it open now ? 
 Great , I like the idea of trying some new food . 
 Also some traditional Chinese food , like noodles and dumpling are marketed in modern ways with improved food quality . I heard this year , the government has imposed very stringent inspection on the hygiene conditions restaurants and suppliers of food are also under tighter control . 
 Mary , could you please come in for a short while ? 
 Mary , I'd like you to meet Richard , Our new executive in the marketing . 
 Welcome to our department . I hope you'll like it here . 
 Sure , if you've got any problem you can ask me . 
 Richard , Mary is a very helpful and experienced secretary indeed , and I'm sure you will find out . 
 How's everything , Janice ? 
 Which company ? 
 Yep ! I got some , in which I am interested . But ... 
 YOU GET ME ! 
 Seemingly there is no turning back . I have to face it somehow . 
 Excuse me , where is the nearest gas station ? 
 To the traffic lights ? 
 Left at the lights ? 
 Right at the bridge ? 
 Hello ! Is your taxi engaged ? 
 Please take me to the Honging Hotel . 
 Could you get there in twenty minutes ? 
 I am in a hurry . Please take a shortcut . I have a friend waiting for me . 
 Thanks . 
 Yes , it is . 
 Take it easy . There is still one more week left before the exam begins . Have you prepared for it well ? 
 Then shall we make preparations together ? 
 All right . But I am very poor at math . Would you like to help me with my math ? 
 Does he know that he has already at his wits ' end ? 
 He might be driven up a wall . You should not handle your relation with him with kid gloves . 
 Hello , Sara are you finished packing yet ? Do you need a hand ? 
 Make sure you have your ID card . You will need it while you travel . 
 All your important documents and certificates should be in the desk drawer . 
 Sara ? 
 Did you buy a map ? Traveling can be really inconvenient without one , and you could even wind up lost 
 Also , take these pills in case you have any airsickness , and take some cold medicine , too . How about some band-aids ? 
 Take care , dear ! Be careful ! Oh Sara , wait a minute ! You forget your raincoat and umbrella . 
 How is he ? 
 Did he see the doctor ? 
 Why ? 
 Miss Wang , would you mind my asking you a personal question ? 
 Are you married ? 
 Frankly yes . We like to employ married people . By the way , do you have any children ? 
 Excuse me , waiter . Could we change our table for that one ? My wife is quite interested in the scenery . 
 It doesn't matter . This one is fine . 
 Have you any package tour to Italy ? 
 How long does the route No . 5 last ? 
 We have just 10 days for the vacation . 
 Creativity , the ability to organize , the entrepreneur's spirit , comprehensive knowledge of human studies , ability of gathering information , expert competence of communication and deep professional skills . 
 If I'm in the service center . I'll listen to the client patiently , and accept the criticism objectively . Then I will have the claim reasonably settled . 
 He has been keeping bach after divorce . 
 Once bitten , twice shy . He said he would rather keep bach than to live in disgust . 
 Just the two of you ? 
 Where did you go ? 
 True ? The food is terrible . 
 Really ? 
 I'm Mr . Bob , Room 309 . I'm checking out today . Can I have my bill now ? 
 What's the 30 yuan for ? 
 But I did't take any laundry service during my stay here . I think you have added someone else's . 
 I don't mind waiting as long as we get this straightened out . 
 It doesn't matter . Here is the money . 
 Do you like cooking ? 
 Why do you like it ? 
 That's wonderful ! 
 Really ? I hope I can have a chance to taste it . Don't forget to tell me . 
 I just heard that you won the long-distance race . Congratulations on your victory . 
 So it is really worth your great effort . And hope you can keep the record you've made today . 
 Matthew ? Hi ! 
 it's got to be almost a year now . 
 I'm pretty good . I've been looking for a place to live recently . My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it . 
 not yet . I am still looking through the classifieds . Wish me luck . 
 Mrs . Thou ? 
 great . It's a lovely neighborhood . And it would be nice to be neighbors again . It would be just like the old days ! 
 We are interested in placing a large order for your wool carpet . 
 10,000 sq . m . You should give us a discount for such a large quantity . 
 The Iranians will give us a 10 % discount if such a high order is placed with them . No doubt you know an incentive discount encourages the buyers and helps expand seller's business . 
 Do Mona and Jim need a new house ? 
 Does Jim make a lot of money ? 
 Does Jim need to make more money ? 
 What do they need all that money for ? 
 Do they have any children ? 
 What does Jim like to do ? 
 What does Mona like to do ? 
 Wow ... She sounds like a high maintenance wife . 
 Politics can be an expensive hobby . 
 Politics is a hard game to play . 
 I passed history test . 
 And then you ’ re old man won ’ t be beaten this time . 
 First National Bank . 
 How can I help you ? 
 What's your name and account number ? 
 Sure . 
 6 hours . If you are in a hurry we can develop it in 3 hours . 
 What are you doing , Janice ? 
 Patent ? Are you also learning something about patent ? 
 You are well-informed . Can you tell me something about the Patent Law in our country from the book you are reading ? 
 So coincidental . Actually we can exchange some information on this problem . 
 Is there any provision on applying for the patent for foreign company ? 
 How long is the duration of patent right for an invention according to your Patent Law ? 
 Excuse me , sir . Didn't you see the red light ? 
 No , sir . The sign says No Turn on Red . 
 I am sorry , sir . But may I see your driver's license and insurance policy , PLS ? I have to give you a ticket . 
 Sign here , PLS . You can appeal to the court within 14 days . This slip has all the information you need . Pls drive safely , sir . 
 May I speak to Peter ? 
 I have a good feeling about this house . 
 I love the paint job ! 
 What a beautiful home ! 
 I like the way the blinds give you privacy from the street . 
 I love that they put a wine storage area in the kitchen . 
 I love the relaxing colors in the tile and floor covering ! 
 Room service.what can I do for you ? 
 OK . Someone will be there right away . 
 Would you cash these travelers ' checks , please ? 
 In ten dollar bill , please . 
 Yes , I'd like to know how to send money to France . 
 About 3 000 dollars . 
 I am afraid not , darling . Our expenses are mounting . 
 Don't worry . Maybe I can find a part-time job to increase my income . 
 Honey , I have something important to say . 
 Yes . I have just booked two tickets . 
 Two air tickets . 
 Yes . We will fly to Paris the day after tomorrow . 
 Today is June 18 , isn ’ t it ? 
 Think about it ! 
 Yes . Think about it carefully . 
 Oh , honey ! Don ’ t you remember this important day to us ? 
 It is our 10th wedding anniversary this June 20 . 
 Of course . You completely forgot it . 
 I have made a mistake ? 
 July 20 ? But I think it should be June 20 . 
 Yes . I remember now . We put it off . I did make a mistake . But how shall we deal with the tickets ? 
 Anne , would you please come in for a while ? Please also bring along the minutes of yesterday's management meeting . 
 How long did the meeting last ? 
 Did the chairman ask for me ? 
 All right . Have you handed in my report to him ? 
 Thank you , Anne . You've done an excellent job . Did they mention the date for the next meeting ? 
 Dad , may I have a room of my own ? 
 Dad , but I don't want to share a room with Peter . He snores every night . 
 Alright . Maybe it's the only way to do it . 
 Nice to meet you ! 
 Thank you . I'd like Chinese tea very much ! 
 Yes , as a representative of IBM . I hope to conclude some business with you . 
 This is our common desire . 
 Yes , I have read about it , but I would like to know more about it . 
 Sure . 
 I think that we have a pretty good idea of what we would like to order . 
 I was wondering if the chef could leave off the sauce . 
 I am a vegetarian . Do you have any vegetarian selections ? 
 I think that we will split the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza . 
 You can bring us our salads when you bring us our entree . 
 Not if you pay for it . For example , if you download from iTunes and pay with your credit card , it's legal . 
 Awesome . You'll see that they are really catchy . 
 He quit 
 It's so quiet . I'm not really used to it . 
 It's a little eerie . I'm sure the silence will begin to grow on me . 
 That is a relief . It's a good thing we moved . 
 I think the file is too big . You'll need to expand your memory . First , close down all the files you have open , and then ... 
 Would you have my baggage sent up , please ? 
 Thank you very much . This is for your help . 
 I have confidence in you . Believe in yourself . 
 Business couldn't be better . 
 Welcome . I could use the help . 
 Would she be interested in a laptop ? 
 A Mac would be an excellent gift . 
 You can take a 15 - inch Pro home right now for only $ 2,100 . 
 She'll be very happy with this . And how do you plan to pay for it ? 
 Now , if you'll just sign here , the Mac is all yours . 
 Everything she needs is right here in the box . 
 Your daughter should get straight A's from now on . Good-bye . 
 110 pounds . 
 No , you know I can't bear eating less . 
 I've quit it already . I go to aerobics class everyday instead . 
 You see . I've lost my weight in spite of my good appetite . 
 I don't think so . You look full of energy every day . Time has stood still with you . 
 Mom , I don't feel well . 
 I feel dizzy . 
 Mom , I don't want to go to see a doctor . 
 Robin , what are you going to do tomorrow ? 
 And later ? 
 It seems that you will have a nice day tomorrow . 
 I have a lot of work in the office and a lot of chores in the house.How I envy you , Robin ! 
 Are you looking for anything else ? 
 That was a thirtieth birthday present . You can have it if you want . 
 And these old Dutch candle holders would go nicely with the tea set . Have them . 
 Excuse me , sir . I can't find my baggage . Here is my claim tag . 
 One is a small-size Nike in red and the other is a big one in black . The two are tied together . 
 May I take your order ? 
 Oh , I'm so sorry . I thought you had one . Here you are . 
 I'm afraid we don't . But I'm sure you'll enjoy our lunch special . 
 You look a little lost , can I help you ? 
 Well , you can ’ t give her granny panties.Have you thought about getting her somesleepwear ? We ’ Ve got these lovely , silky nighties . Or , how about a nice panty-and and-bra set . Look , here ’ s a nice satin push-up bra , and you can choose a few different styles of undies to go with it . 
 Well , do you want a thong , some bikini briefs , maybe this nice pair of lacy boy shorts ? 
 Here you are , sir . I ’ m sure she ’ ll enjoy them . 
 I ’ m sorry , sir . I ’ m going to have to take a look inside your bag . 
 Right . I'd like to deposit 2,000 RIB into my Current Account . 
 What ? What's wrong ? 
 It does look a little strange , I didn't notice that before . 
 He must be courageous enough to fly in the face of established authorities . 
 So are Copernicus and many others . 
 I used to be an atheist . But in recent months , I couldn't but form a more favorable opinion of horoscope . 
 Not exactly , except that I find horoscope predictions increasingly accurate . I came upon a website which sends me an up-dated message by e-mail each day forecasting my experience in detail . It is amazing to find these forecasts largely in line with my daily life . 
 For example , the message for the day before yesterday notified me that I , as a Leo guy , was to have some " unusual experience in food and drink . And as it turned out , the reality matched this prediction well . Lasi night , I was treated to a dinner party by Mr . Lee . 
 Oh , no . You can never tell whether such-and-such is science or sheer fraud.If horoscope is really something deceptive , how come quite a size of proportion of young people think highly of it . 
 Look ! This picture of Mom in her cap and gown . 
 Yes , we are very proud of her . 
 Surely , I'll have one made for you . You want a print ? 
 I'd like to see that myself . 
 Certainly . 
 I'd like reading books best . 
 Literature and economy . 
 That's OK . 
 I like to play golf , play badminton or crack jokes . 
 That's a bad habit . 
 Sorry , sir . That table has been booked . 
 Actually you can have a window seat if you don't mind a ten-minute wait . 
 We will go to Luoyang for a vacation next month . 
 About one week . 
 In the hotel . 
 Yes , we have . 
 Good afternoon , may I help you ? 
 May I have your name , please ? 
 Yes , I see . We will cancel your order . 
 No , thank you . I don't like soup . I'd rather have some fruit juice to start with . 
 Meat , I think . 
 I do , but I want meat . 
 Yes , but I prefer red wine with meat . 
 I just want to have a coffee , I think . 
 No , thanks . I'd like to go straight home . I'm very tired . 
 How can there be a traffic jam on a 16 - lane highway every day ? 
 I wonder if there was an accident . 
 Well , let ’ s put on some music . We ’ re going to be stuck in this for a while . 
 How about some Beatles ? 
 Hi . Have you got a personal computer ? 
 I wonder if you often trade with others on the internet . 
 Great ! It's just like viewless stores . But how can you shop or order on line or trade on line ? 
 Is the service charged ? 
 Really . I'll get a computer at once . 
 Really ? You are joking ? 
 I'd like that . Alright , put on this apron first . 
 Hmm , let me see . Boil some water , and then whisk two eggs . 
 Not bad . OK , now take some meat and potatoes from the fridge . 
 Three . And bring four bell peppers . 
 Now wash them , then dice the potatoes and bell peppers , then slice the meat . 
 It's in the cabinet . Adam , The gas cooker doesn't work . 
 Let me take a look at that . I can't stop the bleeding.We need to go to the hospital . 
 Did you see Victor on Wednesday , Wendy ? 
 Wasn ’ t it cold on Wednesday ? 
 It ’ s so nice and quiet in the woods . 
 It sounds wonderful . Did you take lunch with you ? 
 Balista , I'll have a frappuccino . 
 You and your fancy Italian names . 
 I'll be fine with just my girly drink , thank you very much . 
 By the way , can you tell me where I can find a restaurant not ? 
 How can I get there ? 
 Thank you . 
 It ’ s a typical of them to do so . 
 We must keep developing our economy and unite with other developing countries to fight against it . 
 Look at this one . It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers . 
 Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture . 
 Let's have the salesmen for a demonstration . 
 You are so old-fashioned . I have already watched it last week in cinema . 
 Its 3D animation is attractive and its colorful scenes are also unforgettable . 
 Well , its theme is moving and profound , so from the academic aspect , this is its advantage to win the award . 
 How old is your friend and why doesn't he know how to read ? 
 Does he even know how to speak English ? 
 That was very thoughtful of you to volunteer me . 
 Oh , all right . Have him come over here for dinner . But you get to make dinner ! 
 Yes . I need some ice water delivered . 
 No , I have some , but not enough for the long weekend . 
 Thank you . 
 I'd like a double room . 
 Yes , I called you last week from New York . My name is George Lee . 
 Probably two days . My wife will join me tomorrow . Then we will decide when to leave for Seattle . 
 By the way , does my room have a private bath ? 
 Does my room have twin beds or a double ? I prefer a room with twin beds . 
 Thank you . One more thing , where is your restaurant ? 
 Thank you , you are very kind ! 
 What do you think of this one ? 
 And this one ? Too flashy ? 
 Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ? Isn ’ t it hideous ? 
 Are you even listening ? I ’ m trying to have a conversation with you . 
 Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon ! 
 Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals ! 
 I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game ! 
 I'm sorry . I won't do it again . 
 I shall . I wasn't as careless as John Sampson . He walked across that wet cement over there . 
 The headmaster asked them not to do so . 
 They went to their stores to get one . Here they come with it now ! 
 Have you made up your mind about not going back to your hometown after graduation ? Where else would you go ? 
 why ? 
 that's true . Beijing is the political , economic and cultural center of the entire country . 
 well , that's true , but living expenses are also higher in big cities . 
 one person ? How about your girlfriend ? 
 sorry to hear that . It seems you have sacrificed a lot to work away from home . 
 I admire you . Good luck ! 
 No , I think Harry will get it . 
 OK , loser buys pizza tomorrow night . 
 No , I don't think so . I think the Internet would be better . 
 well , there is no doubt that many people have found jobs through the want ads in the newspaper . 
 Yes . 
 No , what ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 Crikey . Where did this happen ? 
 Oh , right , I hear they have a lot of this kind of problem down there . 
 So what happened ? 
 That's terrible . 
 So what happened next ? 
 Well , he sure was lucky . 
 I need to stop eating such unhealthy foods . 
 What foods do you eat now ? 
 Those are the only things you eat ? 
 Why aren't you eating anything else ? 
 And the chicken ? 
 I guess that does sound a lot healthier . 
 Oh , what ’ s he like ? 
 Yes . 
 Um , that ’ s good . 
 Good morning ! I am a new comer in our office . 
 Nice to meet you ! My name is Grace Williams . 
 Today is my first day at work ! 
 Thank you . It's very kind of you . 
 Come in , please . 
 Good afternoon . Have a seat , please . You are Mr . Sun ? 
 I have read your resume . I know you have worked for 3 years . Why did you choose to major in mechanical engineering ? 
 What are you primarily interested in about mechanical engineering ? 
 Why did you decide to apply for this position ? 
 What do you think determines an employee's progress in a company such as ours ? 
 We have several applicants for this position . Why do you think you are the person we should choose ? 
 That sounds very good . How do you see your career development ? 
 Have you anything to ask about the job ? 
 Yes . If you undertake additional courses , provided these are approved , and you complete them successfully , you can claim back part , quite a large part , 75 % of the costs you incurred . Not just the fees , - traveling and other expenses too . 
 Anything else ? 
 Well , thank you very much , Mr . Sun . I'll let you know the result of the interview as soon as possible . Goodbye . 
 Excuse me . Do you know where I can find a pay phone ? 
 Can I make an international call from that pay phone ? 
 Where can I get a phone card ? 
 Oh , I see it . Thank you . 
 No , what ? 
 Why ? 
 Why on earth would she do that ? You mean that she intentionally did not eat any food for days ? That's crazy ! 
 I can't believe that there are girls who are willing to do that to their bodies . And all for a certain look . 
 True , but there are limits . Being thin is one thing ; starving oneself to death is another . No one forces them to do this . 
 I changed my diet recently , and I eat a lot healthier now . 
 My diet consists mainly of fruits , veggies , and chicken . 
 Just about . 
 You know that fruits and vegetables are very healthy foods ? 
 I bake chicken because it's a healthy way to eat it . 
 You should try it . You won't be disappointed . 
 About what ? 
 Oh , really ? 
 I am very impressed . 
 That is very nice of you . 
 Yes , I am going to vote . 
 Thank you and good luck .

 What can I do for you ? 
 Here you are . Take one at a time . 
 You are welcome . 
 No , there isn't , but there are some vegetables . 
 No , there aren't . I'm sorry . 
 There's a little bread and there are a few biscuits . 
 All right , I'll walk to the village and I'll get some meat . 
 You'll cook it of course ! 
 Yeah . It is incredible ! Is it the work of Qi Bakshi ? 
 Well , Qi is famous all over the world , isn ’ t he ? Besides I am quite interested in Chinese painting . 
 I prefer free sketch , especially the landscape paintings . I can always feel peace and harmony from those landscape paintings . 
 I love this art exhibition ! 
 OK . 
 I asked you if you wanted some help . 
 Certainly . What's your topic ? 
 All right . You can use the computer over there , enter ' tropical fish'under subject . If you know the title of the book , enter it under ' title '

 Yes , I do . I have a Current Account , a credit card and a mortgage with you already . 
 I plan to repay it within 2 years . And the interest ? 
 So the rate is variable ? OK , that's fine . How about the frequency of repayment ? 
 That's nice and easy . Thanks for your time . 
 Excuse me , madam ! You parked in the handicapped spot . 
 Don't tell me you lost it . 
 That was quick . 
 Hello . Front desk . 
 Hi , Bob . What can I do for you ? 
 Could you please tell me why ? 
 So you need a quiet side room on the lower floor . 
 Okay . Let me check for a room on the first floor .

 Sure . I ’ ll send the bellman to help you . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 I'll have a hamburger . 
 No , just tomatoes , please . And large fries . 
 A small cola . 
 Apple pie is my favorite dessert . 
 Do you think discrimination against women in the work force is still prevalent even today ? 
 do you think the glass ceiling phenomena is because of traditional social customs ? Or are there more issues coming into play ? 
 What about affirmative action ? Hasn't legislation changed a lot of the make hierarchy ? 
 We have received your resume in answer to our ads . I would like to talk with you regarding your qualification for this position , OK ? 
 What is your greatest weakness ? 
 What is the greatest disappointment in your life ?

 I don't care how much it costs . I'm rolling in it . 
 I got a replace my party outfit , I trashed it last week .

 Any time between 8 a . m . to 9 p . m . 
 You are very welcome . Anything else I can do for you today ? 
 This apartment is great , but could I upgrade a few things ? 
 I want to have a different color carpet . 
 Would it cost a lot more ? 
 I was also wondering if it would be possible to pick a different paint color . 
 When can you finish with the new carpet and paint ? 
 Hi , Jason ! 
 With the greatest pleasure ! Where is the concert held this evening ? 
 What is on the program ? 
 Hah ! OK . Let ’ s go together ! 
 See you then .

 I am going to add a second drug for now , Lisinopril , which is an ACE inhibitor . 
 You will feel much better except for the fact that you might have a little cough . 
 Not at all . 
 Someone just robbed me . 
 This guy just robbed me right on the street . 
 I'm okay . He just stole my things . 
 I have to file a report at the police station . 
 I would like that . 
 I'd like some info about your Payroll Services , please . 
 I see . How is it paid ? I mean , what payment methods are possible ?

 You have a warrant . 
 Apparently , you have a bench warrant . 
 You missed a court appearance . 
 I don't know what to tell you . 
 Life isn't fair . 
 You have the right to remain silent . 
 I don't think so . Why ? 
 sure . Would it be alright if I brought a few friends ? 
 will there be a lot of people there ? 
 who else is going to be there ? 
 I know your sister . She's very nice . 
 what time is it going to start ? 
 should I bring anything ? 
 I could also bring some music if you want . I've got loads of songs on my new iPod . 
 It's time for your bath , young lady . 
 You need a bath every day . 
 Because you don't want to smell bad . 
 That's what you think . 
 I can smell you . 
 That's my perfume . 
 Today more and more families have personal computers . People have wider range of choice to communicate with the outside world . 
 One of the common uses of PC is that people can buy goods through it without going out to the physical stores . 
 If a customer is interested in some certain goods , he can ask the web company to have the specimen of the goods shown on the color screen , and then the customer can place an order online to the sales company . And then the goods you want will be delivered to your home . The service is perfect and the delivery is free of charge . 
 Hello , housekeeping . Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 We charge $ 5 for a barrel . 
 Please fill out the form sir . 
 Well , it's just that she put a lot of makeup on her face . Actually , natural beauty comes from within . 
 She has nothing that deserves my jealousy . I don't have to put things on my face and I still look pretty . Don't you think so ? 
 They are cucumbers . They are natural skin soothers , natural healers of the skin.Haven ' t you heard them say on TV that ... eh ... they soften the skin , wipe out the roughness , counter irritation and build strength and resilience ? 
 That's right . You have learned a lot , haven't you ? 
 Thank you . 
 I do yoga twice a weeks 
 It was hard at the beginning , but now feel it's really relaxing . It makes me flexible . 
 Yes , I often go swimming . 
 Yes , I like it very much . 
 Working under pressure is exciting and challenging . I don ’ t mind working under pressure . I work well under that circumstance . People can , I can . 
 No , nothing in particular . 
 I need about two to three weeks for necessary formalities . I will quit then transfer to your company . 
 What do you mean ? 
 We'd better take it up with them , in that case . 
 What's wrong ? We have been working overtime recently . 
 Must we finish our task before the holiday ? 
 OK . I know . But Bob wanted to change shifts with me tonight . 
 He said he would celebrate his girlfriend's birthday . 
 It is convenient for me to work overtime tonight . 
 I thought about what you said . 
 I decided that you're right . 
 I want to reserve rooms for my colleagues . 
 A single room with a bath and one double room facing the lake . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes . I am . Actually my wife is a teacher . 
 German . 
 Since I first met my wife , about three years . 
 Yes , I ’ d like to do that . 
 Thank you . 
 French dressing , please . 
 Oh , French dressing . 
 We still prefer French dressing . 
 Who's your manager ? Tell me ! Would you ? 
 Could I reserve a table for Saturday , September 16th at 8: 00 p . m . ? 
 For two people . We would like a quiet table , please . 
 This is Mr . William . 
 William . W-I-L-L-I-A-M . 
 Good morning . Are you ready to order ? 
 Would you like anything to drink ? 
 Anything else ? 
 Sure . Coming right up . 
 And I must thank you again for your generous help . 
 I promise I will take the first chance to call on you . Please send your wife with my best regards . 
 Sure , I love curry . Who else is coming ? 
 I have no plans for Friday , so curry would be great . Which restaurant do you have in mind ? 
 Which one is that ? 
 Oh yes , I know which one you mean . I have never been there , but I looked at their menu once and it did look good . 
 What time ? 
 That's good . See you on Friday . 
 An exporter needs to know the social characteristics of people he is dealing with . 
 What do they like or dislike . What languages do they speak , what religions do they follow . 
 Especially he needs to know their behavior , their habits , their way of life and the things they are used to . 
 just don't understand why we have to take the subway . Look at this place . It's modern enough . But it's far from lively . 
 This isn't network , Frida . We are in San Francisco . 
 We haven't come here in business but for pleasure . We should go out exciting . What can you see in the subway ? Nothing ! 
 I can see people who are walking on the sidewalk . I can see cars driving on the streets . I can see the sun shining and beautiful flowers dancing in the wind . I can even smell the scent of flowers and the freshness of the air . 
 You miss the point ! We are not in a hurry to go anywhere . 
 I'm so glad you can finally see things in my way . Can we leave this dull place now ? 
 Just throw them away ! 
 All wet.You are such a fool . 
 What do you mean ? 
 That is called a nuclear family . 
 What kind of family are you like ? 
 It's a traditional family . It may be too large to live well . 
 Hello ? This is Steven . I'd like to speak to Mr . Brown , please . 
 Then what time do you think he will be in ? 
 I'd like to leave a message . Please ask him to give me a call as soon as he returns . He has my number . 
 Thank you . Bye-bye ! 
 I'm calling to tell you the shipment has arrived in good condition . 
 Quite satisfied . I'm looking forward to our future cooperation . 
 No , never . I prefer to actually see and touch what I'm buying before I pay for it , especially for clothes and shoes . 
 I've heard some friends say when they get the article , it's quite different from what they see on the website advertisement . 
 What's more , it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password . 
 I can't agree more . that's why I only do street shopping . 
 That's a good idea . 
 Did you notice that stop sign you ran through ? 
 You didn't see it ? 
 That's true . Those bushes are a problem . 
 I can understand why you didn't stop for it . 
 Under the circumstances , I think I'm just going to let you go with a warning . 
 No problem . Next time , just pay closer attention . 
 Yes , it's been marvelous . It really was very kind of you to invite me . I hope it hasn't been too much trouble . 
 Can I help you ? 
 What kind ? 
 Sorry , madam . We have stopped selling those kinds of eggs for a week . 
 You know , red yolk is proved unnatural . It's artificial , and may lead to cancer . 
 Yes , so they are no longer being sold . 
 Do you like climbing ? 
 How about climbing up the Fragrant Mountain tomorrow ? 
 It is located at the east foot of Western Mountain of Beijing , in a park with the same name . There are some huge stones within the mountain which look like the censer , so it is called ' Fragrant Mountain ' . 
 Many times . Except climbing , there are many attractions worth visiting . 
 It is the best season to view red leaves from the Mid-October to the first ten days of November . During the period , thousands of hectares of maples on the sloping field are so red that you would recognize them as fallen petals by mistake if looking from a further area . The bright red , pink , scarlet , and peach-puff leaves are distributed in different layout , with some green pines and cypresses dotted in between . 
 You can take a bird-eye view at the glorious picture when you arrive at the top of the mountain . 
 Fill it up , PLS . 
 Premium , PLS . Could you check my tyres , too ? I think they need air . 
 I don't think so . It's brand-new . 
 Yes , PLS . I also need you to check the oil and the radiator . 
 Pls fill it up with water then . 
 Do you take credit card ? 
 30 dollars and 10 cents ? Here you go . 
 Hey , Mr Brown . How are you ? Look at that smile on your face ! 
 That's what we like to hear , a profitable business . 
 So , what can I do for you today ? Are you needing to withdraw or transfer ? 
 Oh , domestic things ? Yes , of course , we can help you with that . 
 I guess not . 
 Look , I want to succeed just as much as you do . Well , maybe not quite that much . 
 What are you trying to say ? 
 What's the time now ? 
 You've simply forgotten to wind it up , have you ? When do you usually wind it up ? 
 You got up so late today . You have , I think . Turn on the TV and set your watch by it . 
 All right . It's just four o'clock . 
 You are welcome . 
 how long is it altogether ? 
 that sounds OK . So , we start here at the car park and walk along the path to the waterfall . 
 then we will follow this path down the hill to the old church . 
 this path leads to the cave . Can we look inside the cave ? 
 then we turn south and come back to the car park along this path . 
 how long do you think it will take us to complete the walk ? 
 that ’ s fine . Are there signposts along the way , in case we get lost ? 
 Li Lei , can you tell me what the origin of Easter is ? 
 Oh , then when do you celebrate Easter ? 
 How do you celebrate it ? 
 That sounds interesting . 
 I look at myself in the mirror . Sometimes , it ’ s not a pleasant sight , especially if I have been out late the late before . 
 I usually don ’ t have time for a bath in the mornings , so I just take a shower . Sometimes I need a cold shower to wake me up and sometimes I need a hot one , especially if it ’ s winter and I need to warm up . 
 I shave every workday , but I only shave at weekends if I ’ m going out somewhere . If I ’ m staying at home , I don ’ t shave . 
 Yes . I brush my teeth in the morning , just before I go to work . It ’ s actually the last thing I do before leaving . Then I brush again before bed . 
 How can I help you ? 
 What ’ s your destination ? 
 Ok . When is your train supposed to leave ? 
 OH , dear . What ’ s your last name , please ? 
 And your passport number ? 
 Let me see ... it doesn ’ t look like we have any information about your ticket here . 
 Oh dear . I ’ m really sorry , sir . But you don ’ t have any proof of purchase . You ’ ll simply have to purchase another ticket . 
 It depends on how you want to travel . If you want a soft sleeper , it will cost 610 RIB , if you want a hard seat , it will only cost 100RMB . 
 looks like you might like the soft sleeper then . 
 ... sir ? 
 Perhaps it ’ s in your other pocket . 
 You ’ re just 4 mao short for the hard sleeper , but I ’ ll let it go . Anything for love ! 
 Can you direct me to Holiday inn ? 
 Thanks . 
 Yes , I do . 
 No , by train . I think it's much safer than bus . 
 Okay . Say when . 
 I was turned down again . It ’ s frustrating . I guess you ’ Ve got to teach me some skills . 
 At least you know what American women generally like in a man . 
 American men are naturally taller than Chinese men . So even if I exercise , there aren ’ t many chances . 
 You know , that ’ s going to be a tremendous change for me . Because I never exercise . 
 I was meaning to ask you if you saw the basketball game on Friday . 
 It was a great game . 
 Our team played hard and won . 
 It was the best game ever . 
 The other team lost by three points , 101-98 . 
 It really was . You should've gone . 
 I see you have bought the latest copy of beauty and fashion . Are there any interesting articles in it ? 
 I like to take the tests that they print in this magazine . 
 You know . Tests like how jealous are you ? and are you a fashion victim ? 
 Of course not , but sometimes the results make you think about yourself and what you do . According to the jealousy test , I ’ m quite a jealous type of person . Perhaps I need to control my jealousy . 
 I wish to order 100 sets of hifi.Do you have this service ? 
 Sony please.Do you have extra charge for delivery ? 
 We are going to the concert this evening . Will you join us . 
 Why not ? 
 What can I do for you , sir ? 
 No problem . May I see your identification ? 
 That's fine ! How would you like this cash back ? 
 Three thousand . Please check it , sir . Thank you and have a good day . 
 How's your work ? 
 Not bad . But we have lost a few of staff lately . 
 Because of the low salaries . 
 I don't know why . 
 May be I can have a try . But I'm on vacation now . 
 Well , I like others very much , but I really don't think much of this one . 
 Yes , but I don't like the story . 
 I need some advice about my fixed deposits . 
 No , no problem . It's just that one of them is due and I'm not sure how to deal with it . 
 Mmmm ... well , I am happy with your service so far , so I'd like to renew it , please . 
 Yes ... 
 That's just perfect for me . I live pretty far from the centre and it can be a chore getting in . 
 Overtime work is very common in companies . I can work overtime if it's necessary , but I don ’ t think we will work overtime everyday . 
 No , I don ’ t like regular work . I am interested in different projects with new opportunities and new challenges , but I can do regular work if the company needs me to do so . 
 Un .. Those are 25 dollars each . 
 Well , I could offer you maybe 10 percent off . 
 This one I'd better chat with the manager . Could you give me a second ? 
 Yes , why ? 
 Just asking ? But why is your face burning like mad ? Aha , someone has a crush on Anny , doesn't he ? 
 Come on , Josh , don't be such a chicken . If you like her , you've got to tell her . Maybe she likes you . 
 You've got to let her know . Come on ! You've got to take a chance ! 
 I'd like to have lunch in my room . 
 What does a Chinese food have ? 
 That will be fine . I'll take it . 
 Sure , it's White in Room 204 . 
 Exactly . 
 Excuse me . What's the actual flight time from here to San Francisco ? 
 Can you tell me what time we're arriving ? 
 I see . 
 Hey , Ann , I am really sorry about last night . I shouldn't have said those things to you . 
 don't be silly . You guys should spend as much time together as you can . Besides we can go to the beach anytime . 
 well that's what being friends is about , isn't it ? 
 Nah , I wouldn't worry about that . But I don't want to be the third wheel . You two should have some quiet time to yourselves . 
 maybe ... I'll think about it . 
 Mr . : Yes ? 
 Mr . : Would you like to go to the nurse's ? 
 Mr . : Here's a hall pass for it . Do you need someone to walk you there ? 
 Mr . : I'll drop by later to check on you . 
 Good for you . What items did you bid on ? 
 Your idol ! Wow ! You're even better at finding stuff than me ! 
 That's not how this game works . 
 How many bids had been placed before you ? 
 Okay , come right this way . 
 What bills are included in the rent ? 
 Well , I guess for $ 400 a month I shouldn't expect an all bills paid apartment . 
 Aisle A is where you'll find all the produce . 
 I'm sure something is on sale . Please check with the produce person . 
 What exactly seems to be the problem , Mr . Sandals ? 
 Cockroaches , sir ? That's unbelievable . 
 Sir , are you sure you haven't seen the same silverfish nine times ? 
 I apologize . One moment , please , while I transfer you to my supervisor . 
 No , I don't like it very much . Do you ? 
 Oh , does he play the piano ? 
 I like rock a lot . 
 The Cranberries . I love their music . How about you ? Do you like them ? 
 A funny thing happened to me the other day . 
 I was just thinking about someone I went to school with , this boy I was quite friendly with in third grade . We used to hang out together - he lived next door - but then my parents moved and I changed schools and never saw him again . 
 Well , I was walking down Nan Jing Dong Lu ( Nan-Jing E . Rd . ) during my lunch break thinking about this boy-I have no idea why I was thinking about him . 
 Yes . And suddenly I heard someone call my name . I turned around and there was this man looking at me . I didn't recognize him at all , but he obviously knew who I was . 
 You got it . Well , he walked up to me and said my name again and then I realized it was the boy I had been thinking about , the one from third grade ! 
 Hold on ! I can't afford to pay for both . 
 Gee , that's really nice of you . 
 What ? Why ? 
 Like what ? I think that by doing something like that we would be isolating our children from social interaction . 
 I think neither your parents or mine would agree to such an idea . 
 Good luck with that ! 
 Well , my whole family is in the United States now , but we're from Costa Rica originally . 
 Actually , Costa Rica isn't in South America . It's in Central America . 
 It's awfully quiet around here . 
 I have a feeling that we're not supposed to be in here . 
 What did you say ? 
 How can I live without Helen ? 
 It's snowing outside . 
 Let's go out and have a look . 
 Look at the snow , it's so beautiful . 
 I love winter , I love snow . 
 But I like cold more than hot . 
 I'm really confused , Zina . Will you explain all this to me ? 
 Yes . If we get it , we'll really be set for success . 
 OK , I'm with you so far . 
 Can I take your order , sir ? 
 Certainly sir , would you like some rice or noodles with that ? 
 Ok , would you like some soup as well ? 
 Thank you very much . Your food will be ready soon . 
 Good morning . I'm interested in antiques . Do you have any ? 
 What do you have ? 
 I'd like porcelain . 
 Oh , it looks well . I like it very much . 
 How much is it ? 
 It's not expensive . I'll take it . 
 Could you explain in detail ? 
 How about 60 % for the first load , then 20 % each ? 
 I like the new shirt . 
 Oh , I prefer it loose 
 Yeah , I know , but it's too hard to do . 
 Only sometimes when I think about it , I feel very sad . 
 Don't tell me that's your lunch ? 
 A candy bar for an appetizer and a piece of pie for lunch ! That's all junk ! 
 Sugar , sugar , preservatives , fats , more sugar , more fat , more preservatives ! 
 My wife sent me with rice , vegetables , and some curry chicken . 
 Hi , Cole . What can I do for you ? 
 sure , have a seat . 
 let me just grab your file . How long have you worked for us now ? 
 one year already ? It's amazing how time flies like that . Are you enjoying your job ? 
 I see . What job did you have in mind . 
 do you understand what duties that job would entail ? 
 that's right . Do you have any experience in management ? 
 well , I think you'd be the perfect candidate for the position . According to company policy , you'll still have to go through the formal application procedures though , so fill this application form in 
 How dare you accuse me of stealing your computer ? 
 Do you like cooking ? 
 To be honest , I don't really like doing either one , I can't cook and I hate cleaning . 
 I would rather do the dishes than cook . 
 let's make a deal . 
 I'm going to buy some vegetable and you cook . 
 Fair enough ! 
 Luckily we got the last two . 
 Gunpowder , compass , the paper making , and the printing . 
 May , I don't see why they are great . They are just simple things . 
 Milestones ? May , you must be kidding . 
 Well , I suppose the ancient inventors made a lot of money out of them . 
 Why ? Didn't you say that they were milestones ? 
 Well , their inventors were not as clever as Bill Gates . 
 Yes . I'd like to make a reservation to Los Angeles on Sep . 19th . 
 Yes , please , thank you . 
 Yes , certainly . How can I recognize him ? 
 Is there anything else ? 
 How old is he ? 
 Well . I shouldn ’ t have any trouble recognizing him . What time does his flight arrive ? 
 Well , it's illegal to bring food and drinks into the theater . 
 No wonder you brought such a big bag today . 
 Those are the ones that are pre-dipped in sweet coating ! 
 Yes , sir ? 
 That's 68 pounds altogether , please . 
 Do you have a free moment ? 
 I ’ m having some trouble . How do you use this printer ? 
 Silly me . 
 Oh , and it ’ s out of paper . Do you have any more ? 
 Good morning , welcome aboard . 
 Yes , you can use your cell phone during the boarding process until the aircraft door is closed . 
 The aircraft is equipped with onboard phones . They do not interfere with the communication and navigation of the aircraft . 
 Of course . They will be used at anytime before or during flight . 
 I've got some documents here that go with the L / C our company opened 10 days ago . I think there is something wrong . 
 Very carefully , that's when I found the problem . 
 Yep , you've got it ! What should we do ? 
 That's a great idea ; thanks for your help . 
 The doctor has examined your current situation . Since you are recovering so well , you will be discharged tomorrow . 
 First please get the bill at the doctor's office , then pay it either with cash or by check . Even though you're discharged , you still need to take a rest at home . Don't hurry back to work until you have fully recovered . 
 What's this then ? 
 But this should have been handed in last Thursday . 
 Well , what's your excuse then ? 
 Oh , Yes ? 
 Hello , this is the admissions office . Can I help you ? 
 What would you like to know ?

 They would like to visit our factory and have a look at the new type computer products . Besides , they will introduce their technique in computer manufacturing . 
 They would also like to have a meeting with our designers . And this time , their visit to our company will lay the basement for our cooperation , so you need to pay more attention . 
 They will stay for two days . Try to work out an efficient schedule . 
 Hello , I would like a room please . 
 A double room sounds great . 
 A few nights , I'm not quite sure of my schedule yet . 
 Here you are . 
 Since it is low season , we are running a special rate right now of 150 yuan per night . 
 Our rooms include television set , air-conditioning and a bathroom . 
 Yes , sir . 
 Come on , Brenda ! Never say die . 
 It wasn't as high as I would have liked . It was 2.5 . 
 I participated in several extracurricular activities . And I worked 2 jobs to put myself through school . 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Certainly . Here you are . 
 Four hundred yuan . 
 I'm sorry . Ours is a fixed price shop and I can assure you this is the best price you can get for a mural like this . 
 Well , I'll have it wrapped for you . 
 Thank you . Please come again . 
 Much better , thanks . I have been resting all day . Only with television as my companion.In fact , in the whole week the only thing I feel like doing was watching TV . 
 I started with game show this morning , I really enjoy them , and even answered the most of questions correctly . 
 At 2 o'clock , I switched to the Channel 6 , and watched a terrific movie without commercials . 
 I want to watch it , but I was already tired by the time it came on . I had a rest instead , then I watched the news at Channel 11 . 
 A bank was robbed this afternoon . A reporter on the scene covered the event , the live coverage reproduce the robbery to the live . 
 Surely of course.Here you are . 
 No , it stopped at Honolulu.Would you like to book one ? 
 Let me see . I am sorry . ZW203 is the only one to New York . 
 Would you like me to go with you ? 
 Do you want to type that letter ? 
 Do you want to tell her ? 
 Wow ! It ’ s packed . 
 Good morning . May I help you ? 
 Okay . Full-size , mid-size or compact , ma'am ? 
 78 dollars a day with unlimited mileage . 
 Is there an additional driver ? 
 If you want full coverage insurance , it will be 8 dollars per day . It includes collision damage waiver and personal accident insurance . 
 Here is our brochure , ma'am . Err ... full-size ... OK . Please choose a model in this section . 
 All right . How many days would you like to use it ? 
 May I see your driver's license and credit card please ? 
 Yes , it is . ( ... ) Thank you . Please fill in this form . Can you check this box , and put your initials here , and again here . 
 It sure is . 
 I've been chosen to plan the next family reunion . 
 Yep . And I should start planning now . 
 Just about . There are at least a few hundred in our immediate family alone . 
 Usually it's at least five days and four nights . 
 Can I give you a lift home , Mrs Word ? 
 Could you hold my umbrella when I get my keys out , please ? 
 Dreadful . There , the door is open now . 
 Hello , is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Have you made a reservation ? 
 So your room number is 201 . Are you a member of our hotel ? 
 Well , we offer a 10 % charge for our members . 
 One dollar . 
 Actually , you can only have four . 
 Okay . Thanks . 
 Thank you . Nice to meet you too . I'm John . Is this your first time to take a long-distance trip on plane ? 
 Oh , I am sorry to hear that . Take it easy . It will be OK soon . You see , I take this long-hour plane frequently , but the jet lag still makes me uneasy . 
 Yes , whenever I think about China , I'd see the Tian'an Men Square . China is a very beautiful country . And I've seen many landmarks in China but I like the Great Wall most . 
 Was it built before the In dynasty ? I thought it was in the Ming dynasty . 
 Oh , yeah . Thought I am an American , I know quite a lot about China and I like Chinese tea very well . 
 Yeah , many of my friends like Chinese tea and whenever I go back to China , I'll take some Dragon-well green tea for them . 
 I heard about it , but I don't have any clothes made from silk . 
 Oh , I'm eager to have a try . 
 Sure . Take a seat ... what would you like to know ? 
 That ’ s correct . It ’ s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in florida several years ago . The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case . 
 I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories . Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! I usually base my characters on people I have met . Most charact 
 Thank you . Let met sign it for you ... there you go . 
 There ’ s a real mix of stories in the book . I haven ’ t finished all of them yet , though . Many of them are short detective stories , but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones . If you give me your 
 I'm just calling to see if you have made any decision about the position . 
 Do you have any idea when you might arrive at a decision ? 
 I'm willing to wait until you have come to a decision . 
 I ’ m glad you like them . Happy birthday ! 
 Forget it . It ’ s my pleasure . You mean a lot to me . 
 What kind of life do you prefer , city life or country life ? 
 But it doesn't have all the modern convenience offered by the city . 
 I was anxious to find out what the sellers had to say about my counter-offer . 
 Did they go with the proposed counter-offer ? 
 Is a home inspection very expensive ? 
 Do I get to choose who inspects the home ? 
 Can you call the owners with my acceptance right away ? 
 Hello , Mr Trent . What can I do for you this afternoon ? 
 Oh , I see . When are you leaving ? 
 Yes , of course . Well , let's get started . Would you show me your passport , please ? 
 Excuse me , Don ? I hate to bother you , but I need your help on something . Do you have time to brief me on the Martin account today ? 
 I hate to make you work through your lunch break with how busy you are ... 
 How about this ... We can make it a working lunch this afternoon , and I'll order some Chinese food for delivery . It'll be my treat . 
 I insist . I really appreciate you taking time to work with me in . What is your favorite fast food ? I'll cater to your taste . 
 Great . I'll bring the food . 
 Just fine , Mr . Emory . Could you please sign this memo ? I want to get it out to everybody this afternoon . 
 Yes . That ’ s for today . Thank you . 
 But I'm not sleepy , Mum . Can I stay and watch more TV ? 
 I know . But I promise I won't be sleepy tomorrow . I work really hard . 
 Oh , I nearly forgot the exams . 
 Yeah , I guess so . Maybe I can go to sleep now and get up early to review the lessons tomorrow . 
 I know you're right . School is more important than TV . Can I watch one more show , then go to bed . 
 Hi , there . Look at these . I have collected some ads here . There is a special promotion for Mother's Day this weekend . 
 Of course . I want to buy some night cream for my mom , and some masques for myself . 
 How much is it ? 
 What's included in the gift package ? 
 Sounds not bad . 
 Yes , I ’ d like to book a single room with a bath from the afternoon of October 4th to the morning of October 10th . 
 Yes , it is Smith . 
 Oh , good ! You know , I am looking at my plate and I ordered scrambled eggs , not fried . 
 I can just trade with him , thank you . 
 I am sorry , but I think I ordered waffles . 
 Just please take my pancakes to trade for waffles . While I am waiting , I will eat my bacon and eggs . 
 I would appreciate that . 
 Great ! This calls for a celebration . 
 What makes you say that ? 
 But everything has been so easy . 
 Yeah , you never look at the positive side of things . 
 Good afternoon . Can I help you ? 
 Do you have a reservation ? 
 Wait a moment , please . Oh , yes , Steven Smith . It's for a single room with a bath . Is that right ? 
 Now , Mr . Smith , could you fill out this registration form , please ? 
 The restaurant is on the second floor . Here is the key to your room . It's on the 6th floor , room 609 . The elevator is over there . And we also have a cafeteria on the top floor , if you would like something to drink , you can also call room service . 
 Hi ! Is that the new laptop you brought last week ? It looks very nice . 
 Here ? In this cafe ? How can you do that ? 
 That ’ s great . Can you do it anywhere ? 
 So , what programs do you have on your laptop ? 
 I know you are keen on photography . It ’ s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone , anywhere , at anytime ! 
 Passport and Embarkation card please . 
 Where are you from ? 
 Did you have anything to declare ? 
 Would you open this suitcase , please ? 
 Let me take a look at this bag . Can you open it ? 
 Is this camera a gift for someone ? 
 You have to pay tax for this camera . 
 You have a lot of gifts , so you have to pay for the camera . 
 The train is leaving . Hurry up ! Which car are we in ? 
 Here we are , Car 11 . Let's get in . 
 Let's put our suitcases on the rack . 
 All right . 
 We want one vegetarian supreme and one double pepperoni . 
 No , thanks . 
 Thanks . 
 It ’ s a difficult choice . The train is a litter faster , but much more expensive . 
 Buses are more cramped and you can ’ t walk around . 
 Really ? I think you see more traveling by train . 
 I prefer going by train , ever though it costs more . 
 The train aren ’ t usually full . We can get them on the day we travel . We should buy return ticket because they are much cheaper than getting two singles . 
 Are you going to the annual party ? I can give you a ride if you need one . 
 The pleasure is mine . 
 Yeah , I really wanted that Chanel bag , too . But just in case you should bid low . 
 I bid on a Chanel watch at the last minute , and got it sixty percent off ! 
 Don't count on it , Babe . eBay is always full of surprises . 
 Hey Kevin , what are you doing here ? Don't you usually spend Tuesday nights at home studying ? 
 What did she tell them ? Is she dropping out of college ? 
 And your parents took it badly ? 
 Ouch , that sounds bad . What did your sister do ? 
 How long has your sister been with her boyfriend ? 
 Really ? Then I guess living together would be a good idea . 
 Well , these days too many people are getting divorced . If they live together , then at least they're finding out if they're really compatible or not . 
 I plan to buy a car this year . 
 I'm going to work in holidays and pay by installments . 
 Hello , Who's that speaking ? 
 Yes , I do . 
 Yes , It's fully furnished . 
 15,000 yuan , including water , but not electricity and gas . 
 It's in the International Trade Zone . It's only ten minutes'walk from the nearest subway station . 
 The price can be talked over . How about coming around and taking a look at it first ? 
 All right , see you . 
 You've got no guts ! 
 I like the style but it is a little tight in the waist . 
 This one fits me well but it is too expensive , can you make it a little cheaper ? 
 Doctor , I have a bad cough and a headache . 
 I don't know , but I feel terrible . 
 Do you think I should lie in bed ? 
 OK.Do you think I can play football tomorrow ? 
 OK , I'll listen to you . 
 Way to go , Mary . A lot has happened during the last few months , hasn't it ? 
 What's up with Vince and Elvin ? 
 And they're happy with that ? 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 How's this ? 
 If you need any help , let me know . 
 Thanks , June . But I think I need to be certified as a mechanic before I ’ m allowed to repair cars for a living . 
 I guess I never thought of that before . 
 Wow , you ’ Ve inspired me to do something ! 
 Can you help me with Comprehensive Credit Granting ? 
 Well , everything really . 
 Willy , I don't think we have much butter.Can you buy some ? 
 Here's the money.And get some salt . 
 Do you have cruise tours ? 
 Sure . That's really amazing . However I don't have so much time . Do you have a full day cruise ? 
 Excuse me , could you tell me where Peking University is on this map ? 
 Could you tell me how to get there ? 
 Oh , thanks all the same . 
 Good evening , sir . Welcome to our restaurant . 
 Do you have a reservation ? 
 May I have your name , please ? 
 Mr . Brown . We were expecting you . This way , please . Will this table be fine ? 
 Please take a seat . 
 Here is the menu . 
 Don't be so dramatic . You're such a baby . Now sit down and finish your soup . 
 And when we get back from the doctor's , you'll gargle again . 
 Well , the only free food on the streets is from a soup kitchen , and their soup isn't as tasty as mine ! 
 Yes , here's our confirmation slip . 
 No reservation ? Well , then , do you have any rooms available ? 
 You mean we can't stay in this hotel tonight ? 
 Then , would you recommend any other nearby hotel ? 
 what do you hope to do when you finish university ? 
 after I graduate , I have to do some more studies to pass exams to become a lawyer . I think I ’ Ve got a good chance of passing . There ’ s a possibility of getting a job with a law firm in London , provide 
 if life were easy , then we ’ d achieve our ambition quickly and then get bored . 
 that ’ s why ambition need to be realistic . You can ’ t achieve something that ’ s totally unrealistic . 
 I think it ’ s important to be successful in a field you are truly interested in , not something that other people force you to be interested it . 
 I hope my parents don ’ t try to interfere in my choice of career . 
 What's the big deal ? 
 First , you should check the schedule and see which trains go to Suzhou . Make sure which train you want to take and book a ticket . 
 It depends on which train do you take . 
 Yes , it stops more than ten times on the way to Suzhou . 
 About fifteen hours . 
 It is not very complicated . You can send your resume to the e-mail address of our company . 
 Our personnel clerk will screen all the resumes that we receive , select the eligible ones and arrange the interview for them . 
 All right . Our insurance coverage is 110 % of the invoice value , up to the port of destination only . 
 Ok , this premium for the difference between 130 % and 110 % of the invoice value should be borne by the buyer . 
 Excuse me . Are these chips on sale ? 
 Is there any limit ? 
 That ’ s good . Thanks . 
 I'm afraid I've got to go . I have another appointment at five . 
 No problem . 
 I will . 
 Pardon ? 
 University ? Why ? You asked me last year . 
 I went to Harvard University . 
 God save me ! Is there anything wrong with you ? Didn't I tell you ? 
 I did a B . A . in economics.Remember ? 
 Julia , I would like to have a word with you . Have a seat . 
 According to your performance , I decided to give you a salary increase . From next month , there will be a 2,000 yuan raise to your salary . Although your first raise might not sound considerable , the company believes that with your ability , sooner or later you'll get a better raise . 
 I think you deserved this . 
 Welcome to China , Mr . Martin . 
 I am very glad that you say so . We have prepared a typical Chinese dinner this evening . 
 My pleasure . 
 Yes . Today is Tuesday , so the boss went off to his MBA seminar class . He is out of the office every Tuesday and Thursday mornings , and he has classes all day Saturday and Sunday . 
 He is finishing up a special continue education program for executives . He can continue working , taking a few of classes here and there , and in 2 years he will complete his MBA . 
 The classes have him out of the office , so that is stressful for him . But as far as homework goes , it is a breeze for him . 
 He just has his secretary do his homework for him . 
 I would be happy to answer any questions you might have . 
 What about income ? Did you make any money during that period ? 
 When you filled out your Continued Claim Form , did you show that income ? 
 What happens is , when you make money , we take part of your benefits away . 
 I wouldn ’ t do that if I were you . There is a severe penalty if you get caught making false statements . 
 Hello there . I need to buy some foreign currency for a business trip . How much can I exchange ? 
 OK , well , I'm going to Europe . I guess 1,000 USD will be sufficient for now . 
 What are you going to do next year ? 
 Do you have any where in mind ? 
 Hello Mr . Jones , please have a seat . Thank you for coming in today . I have read your resume . You completed University in England ? 
 So , what experience do you have ? 
 I can see that from your resume.Your last position was marketing director for a pharmaceutical company , is that right ? Later , why did you decide to leave your former post ? 
 I see . Do you want to work full-time or part-time ? 
 I'll make note of that . Now , what are your salary expectations ? 
 Hello Gina ! We've spoken so many times on the phone but's it's so good to finally meet you in person ! 
 Oh , please don't call me sir . Just call me Jason . 
 Pretty good . There was a bit of turbulence while we were over the Pacific Ocean but it wasn't too bad . The worst thing was the guy behind me . He snored all through the night ! 
 The stewardess said it's not company policy to wake people up for any reason . 
 Not much ... but that's ok ... I'm a night owl anyway . 
 I'd love to squeeze in a trip to the Great Wall . 
 How many people are there in your family ? 
 Is your brother older or younger than you ? 
 I ’ m so sorry to call you on such short notice , but something ’ s come up . 
 That ’ s right I ’ m afraid I have to postpone it . Mr . Scott got sick and I have to attend the Speechmaker ’ s Symposium in his place . I ’ m leaving today , and I won ’ t be back until a week from Friday . 
 That will be great . So it ’ s two weeks from tomorrow , same time and place . I ’ m really sorry to do this to you . 
 Yes , sir.May I help you ? 
 For today ? 
 We have a flight that we'll put you there at ten AM.Is that ok ? 
 I'm afraid not , unless you want a night flight . 
 How about afternoon ? 
 Sir , are you alright ? Just try to calm down , Sir . What's happened ? 
 OK , just take a deep breath , Sir . Everything is going to be fine . Here's a form to report missing Traveller's Cheques , whatever the reason . Please fill it in and we can get moving on this . 
 Yes , Sir . Do you have that information with you ? At this bank , we always recommend our customers write down the reference number of each Traveller's Cheque and keep it in a safe place away from the Traveller's Cheques . 
 I have eight years of experience working in the IT industry . For the past two years , I have been working as a project manager for a dotcom . I am also MI certified . I'm looking for a team environment where I can join the excitement of building a company . 
 I have worked on a variety of projects and jobs in the high tech industry . I wanted to have the experience of working for a dotcom and have learned something about being in on the ground floor of a business . 
 I've been searching for a while now to find a company that had a business model and corporate philosophy like yours . I am interested in working for a company that provides products and services to the K - 12 education market . My background is in this field , and my strength is in building relationships and solving problems . I am excited and interested in the idea of developing business relationships through e-commerce . 
 To have a combination of technical and business knowledge and to be very results-oriented . My past record shows that I have those qualities and more . Because of my business acumen and technical know-how , the teams I have managed accomplished outstanding results , including booking more than $ 50 million in online revenue . 
 When I have a specific project to complete , I like to know the specifics of a project from beginning to end . I like definite deadlines and I like to meet those deadlines . I expect some deviation from the original plan , but I try to stay focused and not let myself drift too far . I have great attention to detail and like to take my time and do it right the first time . 
 I've set some goals for myself and my career , and unfortunately I'm at a standstill in my current situation . I have begun to explore options available before I spend too much time in a job where I can't advance . My goal is to continue to take on new responsibilities and be a key contributor to the success of an online venture . 
 I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . I'd like to postpone that discussion until later . 
 Yes , I do . Who are your financial backers ? Who are the key competitors ? Does the company have a plan for the IPO ? What would you say is the best thing about your product or service ? 
 Oh , my dear lady . Take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him . 
 I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems . 
 Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss . 
 Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper . 
 I disagree . All you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions . 
 He's with someone right now , would you hold ? 
 Doctor Butcher . 
 No , not at all.it ' s about how to keep fit . 
 Please keep calm . I know the pain isn ’ t what flesh and blood can stand . But be brave . 
 What are you doing ? 
 Come on ! Stop being so vain . You look great ! You are beautiful ! 
 I don ’ t see any wrinkles or sagging skin ! You are 25 , stop being ridiculous . Besides , I think that people who get Boto , have facelifts , or tummy tucks look weird . It doesn ’ t look natural . 
 I think you need to get brain surgery . I honestly don ’ t think you need cosmetic surgery . You look amazing . 
 You don ’ t need plastic surgery to do that . You are fine the way you are and you have guys drooling all over you ! Plus , plastic surgery hurts ! 
 Yeah ! When I got my nose job I was black and blue for a week ! 
 Do you ? 
 Do you watch it or do you still play it ? 
 Good afternoon , Chloe , I ’ m Doctor Evans.What seems to be the problem ? 
 Ah I see , yes you do sound rather croaky . Well let ’ s have a look , shall we ? Could you please open your mouth and say ” ah ” . 
 Good , yes , your tonsils are a little swollen and red . How are your ears , blocked at all ? 
 Ok Chloe , can you please breathe in and out slowly for me while I listen to your chest ? You really are all bunged up , you don ’ t sound too good at all . Ok , I ’ m going to set you up with a bunch of antibiotics . You will need to take these orange pills twice a day and these blue pills every evening . You will also have to take this cough medicine three times a day after meals . Finally , I am giving you an inhaler to use every time you feel breathless . . . just to clear up your lungs ! 
 Absolutely not ! You are highly contagious ! You don ’ t want to infect the rest of your co-workers do you ? I recommend staying in bed for at least three days and drinking plenty of fluids so you don ’ t get weak and dehydrated . You can catch up on all the latest TV shows and movies ! 
 Ha-ha , sure not a problem ! Here you are.Now off you go and away to bed . If you have any questions just give me a call ! Feel better soon and take care . 
 Now people are talking about world recession which started more than a year ago . Can you give us your personal assessment of the situation of the global economy ? 
 What is the direct impact of the terrorist attack upon your country's economy ? 
 What challenges is your country's economy facing at the moment ? 
 I love Chinese food . 
 Well , I always order fried spring rolls when I go to Chinatown . 
 Really ? But they're delicious ! 
 That sounds great . 
 Do you know how to go to the Fragrant Hills in Beijing ? I heard that they are very famous in China . 
 That must be very beautiful . 
 Really ? Have you ever been there ? 
 Can you go there with me ? I'd like someone who is familiar with that area to go with me . 
 What kind of permanent would you like to have ? 
 Oh , yeah , It ’ s quite of variety . Regular , cold perm , straight perm , pink curl and form . 
 Hello , this is United Airlines . 
 When is your flight ? 
 One first class seat on flight YW132 , is that right ? 
 You are supposed to check in at least one hour beforehand . 
 It's loaded ! For example , it's got a 256 color , LCD screen that rotates 360 degrees , and switches to black and white in power save mode . Also , it has a low-light mode for night shooting and touch screen menu controls that are really convenient . 
 Oh , it's the usual 5600x3200 resolution with 10.0 megapixels . It's got a 5xzoom , so from 28mm to 120mm the pictures look great ! I can change the resolution , too . 
 It has a built-in hard-wired memory , but I like to use the 64MB media cards that come with it . I can download everything onto the hard drive and then edit and enhance with different software . It takes fantastic pictures that I can either print out or E-mail to my friends . 
 It really isn't hard , sir . You just have to follow the instructions . 
 We will give you a detailed instruction manual if you buy the table . 
 Don't worry about that . Your English seems very good.And our instruction manuals are very clearly written . It's easy ! 
 Of course.First , you must sand the furniture . You sand it to make the wood smooth.You start with heavy-grade sandpaper . Then , you move to finer-grade sandpaper . 
 The better you sand it , the better the finish will be . 
 Then , after you sand it , you use tack cloth to wipe off any dust or sawdust . 
 Yes , sawdust is the tiny particles of wood.You could call it wood dust . You must wipe it off.The wood should be very clean before you put the varnish on . 
 Then you apply the varnish , which is very easy . It is like painting . 
 Yes , we have many colors to choose from , sir . 
 After the varnish dries for 24 hours , you can put another coat of varnish on . Or you can put the finish on.The finish is hard and clear . It goes on top of the varnish . 
 Well , when the finish is dry , the table is done . 
 It only sounds complicated . It's really very easy . A lot of people here in America finish their own furniture.It ' s a good way to save some money . And a lot of people even enjoy it . 
 Alright , sir . 
 Yes , I'd like to rent a car . 
 An automatic sedan . 
 About a week . 
 Where do you work , Andrea ? 
 Oh , really ? What do you do there ? 
 That sounds interesting ! 
 I'm a student , and I have a part-time job , too . 
 In a fast-food restaurant . 
 Hamburger Heaven . 
 Do you really think so ? 
 Think , in some way it is an act of God , but in another way , it just is caused by us . 
 We didn't pay attention to the environment , cut down trees and polluted the air . 
 Is there any ticket for New York left ? I want to go coach . 
 Yes . What's the fare ? 
 Well , I thought it was $ 83 . 
 see . Here is the money . 
 Yes . I am interested in applying for graduate school in America . 
 Can you recommend some universities with good graduate schools ? 
 Oh , no . It's already February 5th . 
 I will think about it . 
 Do you have a hotel card or something ? 
 Oh , you're staying at the downtown Hilton.Then , you go down two blocks this way and turn left.You ' ll find it on the right . 
 Could you do me a favor ? 
 Could you possibly give me a lift home ? 
 Are you sure ? I don't want to inconvenience you . 
 Thanks . I really appreciate it . Thanks so much . 
 My present pay is 100,000 Yuan per year . 
 I like to be paid more than that . Hopefully , 120,000 Yuan per year . 
 I think you'll find I'm worth that . 
 Yes , it is quite reasonable . 
 Perhaps you'd be interested in red roses . 
 They're only $ 20 a dozen . 
 Yes , that is today's sale price . 
 Is there anything else you'd like to get ? 
 These roses should make your wife very happy . 
 I'd like to book a room for three nights . 
 From July the seventh to the ninth .

 Guess what ! 
 I am going to the mountains with my family this weekend . 
 Hi , Tina , I ’ Ve got good news . I have successfully passed the first two rounds of interview with ABC Company . They informed me to go to the final round next Monday . It looks very promising . 
 Thanks . Let ’ s go for a celebration this evening . Are you free ?

 I see . Including bonus ? 
 What starting salary would you expect here ? 
 Your boyfriend is so considerate to you . When do you plan to marry ? 
 Could you talk to me for a few minutes about my grades ? 
 Am I failing ? 
 I am pretty sure that I am in trouble . 
 I missed a few classes ; I need to make sure I come to school on a regular basis . 
 I'll try ; it's hard ! 
 Do you know a bus I can take from Altadena to downtown LA ? 
 Will that bus really take me to LA ? 
 Is it a very long ride ? 
 Really ? 
 Do a lot of people ride that bus ? 
 Wow , thanks a lot . 
 Hi , Bob . I heard that you had passed your driving test . Is it true ? 
 Is the driving test difficult ? 
 What does the driving test require ? 
 Oh , I see . I need more practice before I take the driving test . 
 Hopeful ! Thank you . 
 Yes.We ' re interested in seeing the rooms for rent . 
 A nice quiet house is exactly what we're looking for . 
 That sounds just wonderful to us . 
 How about this afternoon ? 
 I want to buy a black suit . 
 I prefer single breasted suit . 
 That looks great . Do you have ties here ? 
 Thanks , Carla . That's quite a compliment coming from you . You always dress so tastefully . 
 No , not much . I got it on sale at the mall - 60 % off . 
 It's a promise . 
 Hold on for a moment . ( a few minutes later ) I have cancelled your reservation.Shall I make another one for you ? 
 I see . Please call us again for any further reservation.Thanks for calling us . 
 Yeah . I was so happy , because my favorite singer , Ricky Martin won ' Best Latin Pop Performance ' . 
 He is really great . He has sold millions of records worldwide . He is especially known for his rocking performance at the football World Cup song-the Cup of World . 
 That's right . His voice ranges from the smooth sound of ballads to the highpowered rhythms of the Spanish Caribbean where he grew up . He has fan clubs across the world , from America to Russia , from England to Taiwan , from Norway to Australia . 
 I'm going to Bill's house . 
 I'm going to help him . 
 He's fixing his roof . 
 Well , a lot of the games were pretty silly . I don't know how much it helped us to be a better team , but i think everyone had a good time . 
 Yeah , I guess you're right . I think the trust game was my favorite . I think in order to have a strong team , we've all got to learn how to trust each other more . 
 Good morning miss . Wang 
 It ’ s a beautiful morning isn ’ t it ? 
 I hope it won ’ t be too hot , I can ’ t stand the heat 
 I'd like to talk to you about my grades . 
 I am worried that I messed up on a test . 
 I think I am doing great , except for that one test ! 
 I think that I could study a little harder for tests . 
 Yes , I know . 
 I see myself as being honest , diligent , persevering and creative . And I have a strong sense of responsibility . 
 I think I can work well under pressure , if necessary . 
 I will just be sincere and friendly to others , and I believe they will treat me the same way . 
 Thank you . I simply believe the goodness of human nature . 
 I should admit that sometimes I care too much about the details . I am always in pursuit of perfection . 
 Can ’ t it wait ? I ’ m watching the game right now ! 
 Fine ! What do you need ? 
 Whoa wait a minute ! Isn ’ t that a bit too much ? I mean , how much is all of this going to cost ! 
 Is that all , your majesty ? 
 Here ' s my passport . I'm a visiting scholar . 
 No , these are all my personal effects . 
 Not at all . I don't know what's dutiable.Do I have to pay duty on things for my own use ? 
 Thank you . 
 excellent . Come in please . The washing machine is in the bathroom upstairs . It keeps breaking down . 
 about ten days ago . I ’ Ve tried to use it since then . Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn ’ t . it ’ s very frustrating . 
 yes , it ’ s still under warranty . Over the last few weeks , it ’ s also been making a high - pitch noise when it ’ s in use . 
 what ’ s wrong with it ? 
 that ’ s great . Thanks very much . Would you like a cup of tea or coffee ? 
 I'm Amy . How do you do ? 
 Certainly ! I suppose you dance often . 
 Yes , I'm glad I have come . 
 I like it very much . 
 Thank you . It's lucky that I have got a good partner . 
 How ’ s it going ? 
 What did you need ? 
 How much money would you like to withdraw ? 
 Which account are you making this withdrawal from ? 
 All right , here is your $ 300 . 
 Is there anything else that I can do for you today ? 
 How's your girlfriend ? 
 Do you have these shoes in a size 7 ? 
 Sir , may I help you ? 
 Sure . What kind of room do you like ? 
 Ok . What about this one ? 
 I am glad you like it . 
 Number 7 and 9 of the Row 11 in the stalls , aren't they ? 
 What a nice theatre ! I guess it can seat hundreds of people . 
 Look . It's begin . 
 It's so interesting , I like it very much . 
 You look lost . Can I help you ? 
 Yeah . I'm Brad . 
 What room is it ? 
 It's on the first floor by the nurse's office . 
 This is how you turn on the computer . 
 How was your test ? 
 Oh , honey , you should study harder . 
 Don't worry . You'll do better next time . 
 Good evening . Would you please offer a table far from the entrance for us ? 
 How was your business trip ? 
 What ’ s your working day like ? 
 Do you get paid onetime ? 
 Do you have any breaks ? 
 My boss gets annoyed if we take coffee breaks . I suppose your job involves a lot paperwork , doesn ’ t it ? 
 Yes , I do . I don ’ t like it very much . 
 Cindy . We were going to try to surprise you for your birthday . But you ’ re just too busy ! Can you tell me when you ’ ll be free ? 
 Great ! What time ? 
 Andrew's Hair Salon , this is Andrew . 
 Hi Linda , what can I do for you ? 
 For what day ? 
 How do you like these dishes ? 
 Did you enjoy your dinner ? 
 Would you like some more rice ? 
 Another piece of meat pie ? 
 How about the dessert ? 
 I cannot ignore her suggestion . In fact I always value her suggestion . 
 Well , it takes two to to make a happy marriage . 
 Will you be voting this year ? 
 This is going to be my first time voting . 
 I ’ m not sure what I ’ m doing . 
 I don ’ t know anything about the bills or laws they ’ re trying to pass . 
 Nobody told me that before . 
 I ’ m so glad you told me that . 
 The company is selecting three employees to attend the marketing seminar next month . Did you put your name in for it ? 
 It's not just about the things that you learn , you know ... seminars are a really great opportunity to mingle and network with professionals in our industry from all over the nation . You can learn a few things , but more importantly , you rub shoulders with the business leaders and make contacts that could lead to potential sales or partnerships in the future . The social mixers are always more important than the seminars anyway . 
 Well , what if I told you the seminar is going to be held in Hawaii ? Does that perk your interest ? 
 Are there pets allowed in this apartment ? 
 What about a boa constrictor ? 
 If I had one , could I rent this apartment ? 
 What about a Gila monster ? 
 Mary , I will have an interview tomorrow . I am so excited ! 
 I only typed several copies of my resume . 
 What are they ? 
 I see 
 Yes , I have those . 
 I will get it soon . 
 Ok , I will remember . 
 Thanks a million . 
 Hello , Pauline ’ s Furniture Store , Faye speaking . How may I help you ? 
 I ’ m terribly sorry about that . We could take it back and deliver a new one to you early next week . Would that suit you ? 
 Please hold on , I'll just check with the delivery department . 
 Thanks for helping me move into my new house . 
 Excuse me , I'm looking for the Holiday Inn . Do you know where it is ? 
 Is it far from here ? 
 How far is it ? 
 How long does it take to get there ? 
 Is it close to the subway station ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 I'm just looking . 
 Thank you . 
 That is true . I hope it doesn't rain . 
 It wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now . 
 Any rain right now would be pointless . 
 I want it to cool down some . 
 Winter is great . I wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though . 
 I feel the same way . 
 That is true . I hope it doesn't rain .

 Winter is great . I wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though . 
 I feel the same way . 
 I know , Grandma , I just ... 
 Yes'm . 
 Yes'm . 
 Yes'm . 
 Yes , it really needs redecorating . 
 I don ’ t suppose you could . 
 I ’ ll be glad if you would . 
 Hello , Finn . I did a wonderful job and I was employed . How about you ? 
 Why ? You are so excellent . I think you are the most suitable person for the job . 
 What ? Then what did you do ? 
 You are so careless . You know they are the basic rules you should follow before you attend an interview . Do remember not to smoke any more , otherwise , you can ’ t find a job . 
 Good luck next time . 
 Now , Miss Childs passed on your resume to me and I ’ Ve had the chance to look it over and I must say I ’ m quite impressed . 
 Well yes , I do have a number of questions , but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview I ’ d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background . 
 Ah I see , so you were actually educated in Europe ? 
 Very interesting . So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood . 
 I see . Okay , well let ’ s move on to discuss your education shall we ? 
 You went out on a date last night , didn't you ? 
 How come ? 
 Why don't you phone her for a date again ? 
 Don't jump to conclusions . Look at the bright side , try to make another date again . 
 Do you even know where this bus is supposed to go ? 
 Don't you know ? 
 Is this the right bus , or not ? 
 Where are we ? This is not Altadena . 
 Tell me what the street signs say . 
 Next time , I'll look for the bus myself . 
 We've got a problem ... it looks like we'll need more spotlights on the exhibition booth . The client thinks it's too dark , and they want to add halogen lighting . We've already got 3 sets of track lighting from you guys , do you think you could help us out and throw in some halogens ? 
 But it would only be adding to the existing structure . We're not talking about anything new here ... 
 How much do you think it would cost ? 
 $ 500per light ? ! That's ridiculous ! It can't possibly be that expansive ! 
 Can't you give me a break on this ? We've already spent so much money on lighting , I hate to have to blow so much more on halogens . 
 Did you see May today ? 
 I don't have the foggiest idea . 
 Yeah , especially since she got a promotion recently . 
 Hi , why do you look so depressed today , Mike ? 
 How come ? 
 I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood . But why not take it easy ? 
 Does anyone need a drink ? 
 It's still stocked , and there's plenty of ice . Here you are-cheers ! 
 No , we walked . Why , do you need us to carry some stuff home later ? 
 Welcome to our show ! Today , I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich ! Are you ready ? Let ’ s get started ! 
 Now that our bread is ready , let ’ s talk about the ingredients ! Of course , each person ’ s palate is different , but I ’ m going to give you a few tips that you ’ ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich . I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich . 
 Last but not least , we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich . We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper , or we can combine mustard sauce , mayonnaise , ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor ! It ’ s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt ! 
 Is Tom here ? 
 Can I help you , madam ? 
 I see . Do you have any ideas so far ? 
 Sure , madam . But may l know how old he is ? 
 And the height ? 
 I see . How about this one ? It's very fashionable and popular among teenagers . 
 How about this one then ? 
 What are you doing , Victor ? 
 What for ? 
 Party ? What party ? 
 Oh , I forget . Who ’ s invited ? 
 Can I help you get ready ? 
 Ok , just leave it to me . I ’ ll take care of it . 
 What's your little caper ? Come home so late ! We are all worried about you . 
 Singing ? At the subway exit ? Oh , it sounds like someone needs some money . 
 It is just pop song , you could have sung there too if you want it . 
 Honey , just do it next time . Have you heard of the real art in the subway station in Russia ? 
 Many oil painting exhibitions are there . That is a kind of Museum Exhibition . 
 I am sure you will . There are some works , and some students who major in painting interpret the meaning for visitors . And people can enjoy the paintings while waiting for the train . 
 Both the pop music and the oil painting ate arts , but with different aesthetic values . 
 Not well enough , but I'm learning . 
 Mine . It's My Heart Will Go On , the theme song of Titanic . Isn't it of strong character ? 
 No , not yet . 
 You needn't ask anyone . You can get on line to search for one . 
 Yeah . Web sites provide many melodies for handsets like my ERICSSON . 
 Numerous . It's time that everybody is particular about personality.Find one and change yours . 
 Yes , that is a lot of choices . What is your favorite ? 
 I like chocolate myself . 
 I really don't like any ice cream with nuts in it . 
 Have you ever had garlic ice cream ? 
 It was . Let's stick with the regular choices today , though . 
 Really ? How did it go ? 
 With tomorrow being Labor Day and all , I think it would be a nice gesture to let all the members of laboring staff leave work an hour early . What do you say ? 
 Well , we all get Labour Day off as a holiday , the real purpose of the holiday is to remember all the people who do manual or other hard labor . It's to celebrate those who work doing what other people might not be willing to do . I think we ought to do something in honor of the common worker . 
 In our company , the loborial force makes up 60 % of our workers . We'd just be letting slightly over half the folks out a little early . 
 Yes , I ’ m looking for a pair of trousers . 
 I ’ m a large . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 How would you like your hair cut ? 
 Well , how about like this ? 
 Okay . How about this style ? 
 Can you give me some idea of what you'd like ? 
 OK , I see . 
 Hi Mike , how are you doing ? 
 Everything is going great . 
 Mike , I had a good time too , but I am getting ready to move back to the east coast , so I think I shouldn't get too involved right now . 
 Right now , I think I need to really focus on matters at home , but thanks for a nice evening . 
 Hello , may I make an appointment for sometime early this afternoon ? 
 Oh , what a pity . I'd like to see the doctor as soon as possible . I have a sharp pain in my chest . 
 Five thirty ? I have a dinner appointment at six . 
 No . I can't wait . I feel awful . The dinner appointment has to be canceled . 
 You are right . Did you say 5:30 ? I'll make a note of it . Fine . 
 How kind of you ! Good-bye . 
 It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up . 
 Neither am I . So a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area ? 
 Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us . 
 How much do you think the rent will be ? 
 Say , what's your favorite sport ? 
 Do you play much tennis ? 
 Sorry . I'm strictly a spectator-football , baseball , basketball , golf ... I watch them all . 
 You mean the large one or the small one ? 
 They're on special this week . They've been reduced to five dollars . 
 No . We have some that are different in style but not in color . They're over there . Do you see the sign ? 
 Very well . Just take your time . 
 I'd love to . Thanks . 
 Any time will suit me . 
 I'm free tomorrow . 
 All right , see you then . 
 He's still pretty sick . 
 We don't know , but he's going to the doctor tomorrow . 
 Thanks a lot . I'll tell him . 
 I'm here to pay my telephone bill . I usually go to the post office , but I was told that I could take care of it here . Is that right ? 
 I don't usually like to use Atms , I like dealing with a real person , you see . 
 Hello ! I'm Penny , I moved here just now . 
 Nice to meet you , too . I thought I should come and say hello to you . I haven't known anybody . 
 Yes . Would you like to come here later to have a coffee ? Bring all your family . 
 About 4 . 
 No , just come here . 
 Bye . 
 hey , Isabelle ... 
 yes , I am the guy . 
 let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ... 
 hang on a second . Hear me out , just this once , Isabella ! 
 I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name . 
 I'm sorry . It was cruel of me . But I promise it will never happen again ? Look , there's a nice restaurant . Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over . 
 That's good , but I think it's too late . She hasn't studied all semester , and I doubt she can catch up in one week . 
 There's some leftover pizza from last night . 
 Um , I think there may be some leftover lasagna from the other day . 
 There might be some birthday cake left in the freezer . 
 You can wash the vegetables and cut the chicken and I'll make dinner ! 
 OK , boy . I will buy it for you . 
 Well , I haven't made such arrangements with the factory yet . So I'd like to make sure if it is acceptable to the factory before making a commitment to you . 
 I won't be too long , I suppose . Just let me ring them , will you ? 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , it is . What can I do for you ? 
 Are they urgent , please ? 
 Well , DHL is famous for its speed and reliability . It is the fastest international postal service available . The document will arrive in two or three days . 
 Yes , I promise . Your document won't be broken or lost . All the items are handled by special staff and carried by a courier . It is reliable . 
 Please write the address and remittee on the express order and make sure there is no mistake on them . 
 This is your receipt which you have to keep until the remittee receives the express . You can also check your post on our web . The post number is on the top of the receipt . 
 Bruno's . 
 Oh , certainly . I'm Linda , the Manager . I can help you with that . How many will there be in your party ? 
 Okay . For a party that size , we have a separate banquet room in the back . 
 No , as long as you can guarantee at least 15 guests , there is no extra charge . 
 The cake is no problem at all , but we do charge a corkage fee of $ 15 a bottle for any alcohol not purchased from the restaurant . 
 Great . I have the banquet room reserved for a lunch on for Nika Corporation on the 2nd of December . May I have your name and contact information ? 
 Thanks , Mr . McQuillin . I'll give you a call a week in advance to confirm the arrangements . 
 Thank you for choosing Bruno's . We look forward to seeing you on the 2nd . 
 Yes , sir , I'll be there in just a moment . 
 Gosh sir , thank you , sir ! I had no idea there were any positions opening up in our department . 
 Management ? Wow , I had no idea I could move so quickly from entry level to managerial staff . 
 I beg your pardon for being late . 
 So sorry , I don't mean to be . 
 Thanks for your forgiving . 
 I'll work hard . 
 How long have you been in America ? 
 Do you think it's easy for a Chinese to get accustomed to the western culture ? 
 One thing I love our boss for is that he always knows when to give you a pay raise without being asked for . 
 He just knows either by your excellent performance at work or by the annual review . 
 Actually not ! Our company pays for performance . 
 Is this the right bus for the Grand Hotel ? 
 Where can I take it ? 
 Good afternoon , Ma ’ am , My name is Mike and I am selling subscriptions to all sorts of periodicals . 
 Please ma ’ am , if you could spare five minutes of your time , I am sure we could find something that interests you ! 
 We have a great variety of magazines all about cooking ! This one for example , is a bi monthly publication with recipes from all over the world ! 
 Sure do ! This one is a quarterly publication , but each issue has over 200 color pages of recipes and also many home decorating ideas ! 
 You mentioned you have a dog , most pet owners sign up for this weekly newsletter that has information on dog care , pet shops and even pet sitters ! 
 Well , I also have ... 
 Really ? I have a weakness for coffee . 
 No , I can't . I've really got important business . 
 OK . 
 There are some seats in the rear mezzanine . 
 No , the show is almost sold out . 
 Are you kidding ? It ’ s summer . 
 Yes . Is this your new product this year ? 
 When is the product going to be on the market ? 
 So soon ? It seems to be in the early stages . 
 Well , it's sounding good ! I'm looking forward to that . 
 Go to gate 18 . The plane is now boarding . You must hurry . 
 Instead of walking , you can take this shuttle to get you there faster . 
 No , I ’ ll call the attendants at the gate . I will tell them you ’ re on your way . 
 You are welcome . Have a safe trip . 
 I haven ’ t been involved in international business , so I don ’ t have any experience . 
 Honest , hardworking and responsible . 
 No , I haven ’ t discussed my career plan with my present employer , but I am sure he will understand . 
 She wears her heart on her sleeve . 
 I dare you to say that again . 
 Which train do you want ? 
 Sorry . There aren't any tickets available for the 19:00 train . 
 The next train will leave at 20 : O5 . 
 180 yuan . 
 Here are your ticket and change . 
 This is Ryan you are speaking with . What can I do for you ? 
 What is wrong with you ? 
 How long have you had it ? 
 How have you been treating it ? 
 That should work . I ’ ll see you tomorrow when you return to work . 
 No , thanks . I have got to work overtime . 
 Well , I am . I'll have to finish this report for next Monday's meeting . Is Tom coming to pick you up ? 
 That's nice . Where is his villa ? 
 Sometimes I envy you a lot . Tom is a good guy . 
 I know , but I am a work maniac . 
 Have a nice weekend . 
 Did she mention anything else ? 
 See you . 
 Well , under normal conditions each head lasts about 5 000 copies or so . It depends on the user , but about once a month is average . 
 That's right . It could last six months or more . This model's designed for heavy use . Don't worry - you'll get an error message telling you when to change the head . 
 Happy to meet with you . Now , do you prefer group projects ? 
 Do you value a steady job more or one that offers a chance to move ahead ? 
 Could you work for us in another state , if need be ? 
 How much do you need to make per year ? 
 Yikes ! Thanks for your interest in this job . We ’ ll be getting back to you . 
 Sure , for how many ? 
 May I have your name ? 
 Yes , I like it , because it's convenient . 
 First , you should open an account at the online bank . After that , you can buy anything you want online . 
 Sure . You can find everything all over the world . Let's check it out online ! ( They log in a shopping website . ) 
 Let's click to check it out . 
 Say , how about having Chinese food for a change ? 
 Let's see what we'll take . 
 That's it ! 
 I've come in to give you the documents under the L / C we opened , the new one . This lot are from Singapore , a new customer . 
 Yes , with a fine toothed comb , as usual . Everything seems fine , except for one thing . The description of the items we are purchasing is a little different from what we expected . 
 Not really , perhaps just a translation problem , that's all . Anyway , we've agreed to accept it . 
 Just a minute . I ’ m putting on my clothes . 
 Yes . Oh , dear , I can ’ t find my hairbrushes . Can you help me ? 
 I put it in the dressing room . 
 Yes , quite sure . 
 Yes , I ’ Ve looked everywhere downstairs . 
 Where ? 
 I received an eviction notice from you , and I don ’ t understand what it means . 
 You can ’ t make me move just for being late with my rent . 
 Are you throwing me out ? 
 If I catch up on my rent , can I stay ? 
 I will go get the money right now . 
 Are you sure it was him ? 
 You're a nurse at New York General Hospital ? 
 Maybe he was just visiting someone . 
 I want to make a reservation under the name of William Smith . 
 Around 12:00 . 
 No , we have five persons . 
 Thank you . 
 My head hurts badly . 
 Since last night . 
 Yes , I even can't fall asleep these days . 
 Is it serious , Doctor ? 
 OK , thank you , Doctor . 
 You are right , look at the crowd . Do you think we will be able to get tickets ? 
 No way . I'd rather go to another movie house . 
 All right . Let's see when the next movie is playing ? 
 Shall we take a chance ? 
 It's moving so slow . 
 I don't think anyone will . 
 What do you need today ? 
 What kind of classes would you like to take ? 
 Okay , you're going to need to make an appointment . 
 You need to make one to come down and fill out your paperwork . 
 Sure you can ; when would you like to come in ? 
 That'll be fine . 
 How do you get paid ? If you don't mind my asking . 
 And in the meantime , how do you pay the rent ? 
 What ? In your cubicle ? 
 so ... what kind of things do you do in your free time ? 
 I like to do just about anything outdoors . Do you enjoy camping ? 
 have you ever been camping in the Boundary Waters ? 
 it's fantastic . My family and I are very fond of the place . 
 sure , would you like to see them ? 
 I have a Canon SLR . 
 I'd call it one of my hobbies . Do you know much about photography ? 
 have you heard about the photography exhibit that's going on at the art gallery this weekend ? 
 yes.In fact , maybe we could go together . 
 how about at 11:00 ? 
 What ’ s “ pi ” ? 
 I see . What is that ratio exactly ? 
 It ’ s 10 centimeters , so the circumference should be 31.4 centimeters . 
 According to the newspaper , the exchange rate is 1.85 dollars to the pound . 
 What ’ s the next question . 
 I can help you there . Those are numbers that cannot be created by multiplying two whole numbers , apart from the number itself and 1 , together . 
 Exactly . Anything else ? 
 You ’ ll be a mathematician one day . 
 Sorry to interrupt , Doris , but can you tell me more about these tour groups , what kind of things they enjoy , and so on ? 
 I don ’ t mean to interrupt , but can you tell me what plans you have for growing the youth market ? 
 So how do you intend to do that ? 
 May I interrupt you for a moment ? 
 How much is it going to cost , and who is going to pay ? 
 I see . OK . So what ’ s next ? 
 Hello , could I speak to Allison , please ? 
 When do you expect him back ? 
 Well , may I leave a message ? 
 Would you please ask him to call Chris when he gets back ? 
 I'm afraid he doesn't . My mobile is 139- 2477 - 4026 . 
 Have you made up your mind ? 
 We have roast chicken , grilled chicken , chicken curry and chicken chops . 
 Dad , can I have a pet ? I did what you said and passed all of my exams . 
 I want a dog . My friend Mindy's dog just had puppies and she said I can have one . 
 I know , I know . I will do it all by myself . 
 Yes . It will cost me about $ 50 a month . And I make a little more than that already . 
 The principal just announced that Dr . Smith is going to take over as dean of our department . 
 Why are you so calm ? Are you not surprised to hear this ? 
 Do you think he can do well ? 
 I'd like to order a restock on my minibar . 
 Absolutely everything . 
 Three bottles each of Perrier and Jim Beam . 
 The apples were great . Could you bring a couple more up ? 
 Some grape juice would also be nice . 
 Then I'll have to borrow it . 
 Why ? It's in mint condition ! 
 You're going to re-sell it on eBay Taiwan ? 
 I've created a monster ... you're a better bayer than me ! 
 Yes , I have , Mr . Thomas . We'll pack them two dozen to one carton , and the gross weight is around 25 kilos a carton . 
 Do you have any seats for September 16th ? 
 The 17th will be fine . 
 Hmm , I guess on the 28th . 
 Sounds good . Thanks a lot . 
 Is he doing very well at school ? 
 What's his problem ? 
 How can his he do that ? 
 Could I ask you where the company is ? 
 Can I get there by the No . 913 bus ? 
 I would like to buy a black suit . 
 No , I never wear suit in my everyday life . I just want one to take part in my sister ’ s wedding ceremony . 
 but it looks good . Let me try it on . 
 May I speak to Mrs . Liu , please ? 
 Oh , good morning , Mrs . Liu . I'm calling to see if you have received my resume that I sent to you by Email . 
 My name is Steven . May I ask whether I can have an interview ? 
 When is it most convenient for me to visit you to talk about the position ? 
 Thank you very much . See you then . 
 Do you need a spot here or off campus ? 
 There's a parking structure for students . 
 Go to the western side of the campus , and you'll find it there . 
 When I went up there , it wasn't full at all . 
 Sometime this morning . 
 I am really not sure . 
 Someone has stolen my cell phone . 
 OK . I left my cell phone in my room this morning before I want out.When I come back it was gone . I have looked every where in my room and I can't find it . 
 Would you like to introduce me to Mr.Johnson ? 
 thanks a lot . 
 When you hired me , you knew you were going to be low on cash , didn't you ? 
 I know how it works . You don't want to give away any more of your future profits than you have to . 
 Can I see the paper when you're through , Sally ? 
 Take your time . 
 A quarter past five . 
 See you . 
 Nothing but the best , Cinnamon toast . 
 Why the drama ? Have you been watching soap operas ? 
 Brings back memories ? 
 But this is how I like them , Mum . They ’ re just beginning to look right . 
 Do you live with your parents ? 
 How often do you go back to visit them ? 
 Are you being served , madam ? 
 Sit here please.How would you like your hair done ? 
 Do you want a cold-wave or perm ? 
 I hear that Tom got divorced , and I don ’ t know how he is now . 
 Who do you mean ? 
 I really don ’ t understand my parents . They always make light of my worries . 
 But the child has his own feeling . 
 I'm sorry , ladies . Mr . Smith's viewing is over . It ended an hour ago . 
 I'm afraid not . But at tomorrow's funeral , the family requested an open casket service . 
 I'm sorry . I know it must have come as a great shock . 
 Look at this , A Brief Introduction of Hollywood . 
 What ? How much do you know Hollywood ? 
 You are full of boasts . I can examine you by question and answer . What is Hollywood ? Where is it ? What is the function of it ? 
 Not bad . What kind of film did it produce from the ready to mid 1930 ' s 
 Mm . What came after that ? 
 Pretty good . Please continue . 
 The western films about America's cowboys , Indians and early settlers . 
 Since the early 1960 ' s , there are horror movies about people who encounter frightening , unnatural situations , and serious films such as documentarist about events that actually happened , and science fiction movies about possible friture and future worlds . Some people have also enjoyed watching psycho-dramas about the everyday problems that people have . 
 Of course , no list of film would be complete without animated movies . These are especially popular among children . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Did you know Carl is almost fifty ? 
 He told me so himself . 
 I am doing well . What ’ s up with you ? 
 The same with me . Have you given much thought to what you want to do next ? 
 How about interviews ? Have you been on any of those yet ? 
 How about the electrician program that they have listed over there ? 
 Let ’ s go see how we can apply for those positions . 
 Of course not . I'm afraid of them . 
 I'm afraid I'll feel sick at the sight of it . 
 O . K . We offer a few different kinds . 
 That would be our Saver's Plus account .

 No , don ’ t worry . Just follow me . 
 I am hurrying . 
 I can't figure out which dress to wear . 
 I know . But my life seems super stressful . I really don ’ t know how to get a better grab on things .

 Hey , John ! I haven ’ t seen you in ages ! What ’ s new ? What have you been up to ? 
 Trading ? You , big guy ? What are you trading ? 
 Currencies ? As in Euros , Dollars , Pounds and Rupees ? 
 I don ’ t understand . You ’ re buying and selling money ? 
 Last night ? 
 You ’ re kidding ! I ’ m on ! Where do I sign up ? 
 It goes all the way there . 
 I know it does . I catch this bus a lot . 
 The bus ride is only thirty minutes or so . 
 Right behind Macy's is a bus stop . 
 It's in the middle of the parking lot . 
 I know it is . 
 I just bought a new atlas . I ’ m looking this map of the world . Look at Russia ! That ’ s a vast country . 
 There are several tiny countries in the world too . Countries like Monaco are smaller than many cities . 
 Britain is half the size of france , but great Britain is still one of the largest islands in the world . 
 Hello , is that Miss Lan ? This is Nina with Huawei Corp . 
 I'd like to tell you that you could come to work with us . 
 I see . 
 What's the matter ? 
 Yes . 
 Dalian . 
 Really ? 
 Sorry . I'm afraid you couldn't . 
 You should communicate with the interviewer whose company you are interested in , and make a good impression on him or her . In that case , your chance of success will be greater . 
 You should take a look at all the companies , choose your favorite ones , go over to talk with the interviewer and leave your resume in the end . 
 Yes , I would be happy to answer a question about payment . What do you need help with ? 
 Did you generate any income during that time period ? 
 Did that income show up on your last Continued Claim Form ? 
 When you are able to find work and get paid , we always take away part of your check . 
 Don ’ t do it ! If you get caught making false statements , you can have your claim closed . 
 Yes , here you go . 
 Yes , I ’ d like to check three pieces . 
 What ? Why ! I am taking an intercontinental flight ! I ’ m flying sixteen thousand CMS ! How am I supposed to only take two , twenty kilo bags ? That ’ absurd ! 
 Now I see . You charge next to nothing for an international ticket , but when it comes to charging for any other small thing , you charge an arm and a leg ! So tell me , miss , how much will I have to pay for all of this . 
 That ’ s more than my round-trip ticket ! 
 The movies . 
 Yes , I do . 
 As you know I serve as a secretary in my present company , I really want to look for a more challenging opportunity . 
 Just as you advertised in the newspaper . 
 Yes , what's more , your company is one of the largest and best trading companies in this line of business . 
 Yes , Miss , what can I do for you ? 
 I'm sorry for that , I'm going to check with the chef right now . Miss , I just checked with the kitchen , and they said your order will be coming right up next . Oh , here comes . 
 Miss , I'm very sorry for the delay , please enjoy this . Free a glass of wine for inconvenience . Again I'm terribly sorry to make you wait so long . 
 Have a nice Thanksgiving ! 
 Are you going anywhere ? 
 Oh , I'll probably just stay at home . 
 Morning , Lee . How are you ? 
 Hi , Michelle . Do you need to use the photocopier ? 
 Oh , I'm fine , thanks . I'm super busy with work actually . Did you hear about the Lawson contract ? 
 Well , I was discussing the contract with Bill and he said that they met the head of Lawsons last week . 
 And hopefully they are going to confirm the deal on Wednesday , fingers crossed . 
 I will , Michelle . Speak to you soon . 
 Usually it's 60 dollars for a manicure , and 80 dollars for a pedicure . But with this special discount , the total for both is only one hundred and 20 dollars , and you can get them painted . 
 Alright.Do you want your cuticles cut , too ? 
 Would you like the shapes square or round ? 
 All right , it's done . Please follow me to the drying section . 
 Ten or about five minutes . You'll be all set . 
 Hello , sir . Have you anything to declare ? 
 OK . Please open your luggage , and I'll tell you what you should declare . 
 You should declare the camera and the film . Do you have alcohol ? 
 How many bottles have you got with you ? 
 I'm sorry . According to the regulations , a passenger can only take two bottles on to the aircraft . So you cannot take so many . 
 You may give them to your friends who come to see you off . This is the Customs Declaration Form . Please fill in it . And then you can go through the other formalities . Be sure to keep the form safe . 
 See you . Have a good journey . 
 Can you tell me where your wine list is ? 
 Can we order a mixed drink in this restaurant ? 
 Do you have any house specials that you could recommend ? 
 That sounds like a good choice for me . May I have one , please ? 
 Please bring it to me on the rocks . 
 I would like it with no salt , please . 
 It runs every 15 minutes . You must have missed it . 
 Yes , I do . You can buy a bus schedule in a news stand . 
 Yes , it is . 
 No . The Museum is the terminal of this bus . 
 You are welcome . 
 Sure . How do you like your meal today ? 
 I am glad you like it . Welcome next time . 
 Hi.It ' s a wonderful wedding , isn't it ? 
 Mary's father is a rich man , isn't he ? 
 Will Mary and her husband be ready to leave for their honeymoon ? 
 Oh , I'll try to catch it . 
 As far as I'm concerned , staying at home is more comfortable than going to the movies . 
 Hello , is that Mr . Li ? 
 I am calling to check your information before the interview . What position did you apply ? 
 Excuse me . Could you slow down a little ? I couldn't catch you . 
 Hoo , I'm getting tired , Jeanine , been a long day . 
 Yeah , I know . Shop till you drop . 
 I'm getting a little short on cash . Let's just window shop a little . 
 Hey , Jeanine , get a load of that . It's beautiful . 
 You know .. I have a weakness for long dresses . 
 Sure does . Hey , can I sponge a little cash of you ? 
 Thanks , Jeanine , you are a real pal . Let's go in . 
 No problem . 
 Oh , Never mind , I finished my paper . So you can use it tonight . 
 I was supposed to meet with you at half past one . 
 There's a problem with my schedule . 
 Two of my classes occur at the same time . 
 Is it at all possible for you to fix that error ? 
 I want to keep both of them , if that's possible . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Thank you , but Alice is only a visitor here . I don't know if she'll keep it . 
 Really ? 
 Unbelievable ! I remember her husband is her former classmate . They fell in love with each other in college . 
 How may I help you . sir ? 
 Let me see . I'm sorry . Nothing's been turned in . Do you want to buy another one ? 
 150 yuan for hard seats . 
 Sir ? 
 Where on earth are we ? 
 What did I do wrong ? Did I take a wrong turn ? 
 Well , now we should turn back a few kilometres . 
 Well , we've finally put the finishing touches on the training programs for next year . Here's a report showing the projected costs as well as the expected return on investment . 
 Sure ! It's not a real figure , of course . It's just an estimate based on rehiring costs , and the potential lost revenue that results from incompetence . 
 A little of both . We'll have a few daylong sessions for things like business writing skills and software training . Those are available to everyone . We also have a variety of other programs 
 A holiday , I hope ! No , really , we are looking into some courses on motivational techniques . We'll add them to the list when we choose a lecturer . 
 Where exactly are you coming from ? 
 Do you have a problem walking a little bit ? 
 If you walk down Fair Oaks to Altadena Drive , you can catch the 267 . 
 Make sure to catch it going west . 
 You get off on Del Mar and Hill . 
 Don't mention it . 
 I am proud to know that he is our President . 
 Did you vote for him , because I know that I did . 
 I have nothing but faith in Obama . 
 I ’ m sure he will help better America . 
 Our country is already changing as it is . 
 I trust that he will take good care of our country . 
 Let's get the table wares we need first , And then stand in the line . 
 Let's stand in the line now . 
 Me too . 
 Tell the waiter what you want when it's your turn . 
 I don't like them . I think they are too icky . 
 If that happen to me , I ’ ll take them back to the shop . 
 That ’ s terrible . But if they wouldn ’ t change them , I know what I would do . 
 certainly , i love waltz very much . 
 a couple of times a week . i've got a regular dancing partner . he is really some dancer 
 As I said before , your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid . We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap . 
 So do we . Certainly it's a step forward on your side . But the gap is still too wide . 
 To make your offer workable , I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken . 
 I hate to disappoint you , Mr . Brown , but if that's the case , we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere . Do think it over , please . We sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion . 
 Not at all . Shall we meet again , say , on Friday morning ? 
 Good evening Ms . Jackson . Fancy meeting ’ you here . 
 Clyde Smith . Pleasure to meet you . May I treat you ladies to dinner ? 
 You weren't going to tell her about chitterlings and hog maws , were you ? Well , my Creole ancestors never ate that stuff . We have refined French tastes . 
 What would you like to have in your breakfast , bread , egg or sandwiches ? 
 And milk or orange juice ? 
 What would you like for lunch , pork , mutton or beef ? 
 What kind of drink do you like most , red wine , beer or champagne ? 
 And among apples , oranges and bananas , which is your favorite ? 
 Do you always have meals outside or in your house ? 
 What's the problem , sir ? 
 Do you keep the receipt ? 
 What do you want me to do about it ? 
 I am checking out . Here is the key to my room . 
 Thanks . 
 This hotel could use some insecticide , but my time in New York was thoroughly delightful . 
 Would you like to play golf with me ? 
 It doesn't matter . I will teach you . 
 Borrow morning . 
 Just take your golf club . I will pick you up Borrow . 
 See you Borrow . 
 We have a great variety of Chinese antiques and porcelain . Do you like them ? 
 You are right . How about paintings and embroidered handkerchiefs ? 
 Of course . These paintings have many designs , such as animals , flowers , landscape , aquatics and so on . 
 All right . Chinese embroidery is one traditional art with elaborate design and high quality . 
 This is a series of animals , called Chinese zodiac . 
 OK , I will wrap them for you . 
 Sure , let me give you an application . You can fill it out right here at the counter . 
 Let me take a look at this for you . May I have your driver's license , please ? 
 You seem to have filled the form out all right . Are you familiar with our rules and fines ? 
 The hours and limitations are printed on the card and this handout . 
 Thank you for joining the library ; we look forward to serving you . 
 Oh , not yet . At least have one for the road . 
 Well , I am sorry you have to leave so early . 
 Well . Thank you for coming . 
 Bye . 
 Yeah . That ’ s right . What can I do for you ? 
 Let me see . Yeah , all right . I ’ ll be over about two . 
 Oh , how do you to Mr . White ? My name is Li Ming , here is my card . 
 We share the same desire . Have you seen the display of our products in the exhibition hall downstairs ? 
 Sure , we can . You know , we are been in the line for more than twenty years , and I think our price are competitive comparing with those in the world market . 
 Thank you for your information , we can hold more talks later on business details . 
 Is that your phone ? 
 It's very impressive . Can you use the Internet on your phone ? 
 That's really convenient . Does it have the Bluetooth ? 
 No , but I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go . 
 The city has got a traffic problem . 
 You said it . 
 How wonderful it is to be in love ! It's love at first sight ! Oh . he's my Romeo ! 
 Oh , Mary . You've surprised me ! 
 Um — I was just thinking aloud . 
 Come off it , Mary . 
 You certainly do like teasing me , Mary . Well I'm in love with someone . The question is , how do I get his attention ? 
 I guess I asked the wrong person . 
 All the fruit are pretty fresh here . 
 They're four yuan per kilo . 
 Yes , we do . They are eight yuan per kilo . 
 Take much and you can have them six yuan per kilo . 
 OK . It's 22 yuan 
 Bob , did you see our supervisor ? I need him to sign this paper . 
 What's up ? 
 Thanks for the warning . 
 Ah , Bob . Just the person I wanted to see . 
 You gotta help me out this time , buddy . 
 I will be accompanying you on your tour today to visit our company . This is the assembly line . These drawings on the wall are process sheets . They describe clearly how each process goes on to the next step . 
 About 200 . They can assemble at least 3,000 computers every day . 
 Yes , since I came to this company , I was told that high efficiency is essential for the further development . 
 Well , all products have to go through five checks in the whole process . We believe that the quality is the soul of an enterprise . There fore , we always put quality as the first consideration . 
 Mr . Chandler , this way please . I will show you a five-minute multivision about the history of our company . 
 Sorry , all the tables for three are reserved . 
 Yes , smoking or non-smoking ? 
 Come with me , please . 
 But not as good as your mother's , right ? 
 What ? Are you kidding ? 
 Oh , Uncle Giovanni . That's wonderful ! Thank you ! Thank you ! 
 Can I help you ? 
 What size do you want ? 
 Here you are . 
 It's already on sale now . 
 When is it ? 
 Could you tell me the origin of the two festivals ? 
 Why do people eat rice cakes on that day ? 
 It sounds so moving . 
 That ’ s right , Ms . Bower . How are you ? I ’ m not sure if I ’ ll be able to fit you in this week , I ’ m afraid . 
 All right , then . Why don ’ t we say next Tuesday at 11:30 a . m . ? 
 I want to show my gratitude for your hospitality . And I believe me trip here will be meaningful and our cooperation will go deeper and stabler in near future . Through the communication , we can know more about each other . Thank you so much for your consideration . 
 Do you have any luggage ? 
 Here's your boarding pass . Have a nice flight . 
 Do you like flowers ? 
 What's your favorite flower ? 
 Peach blossom is really beautiful . 
 I like lotus . 
 But there aren't any lotus now . 
 That's not bad . Let's go . 
 I'm paid on a salary . 
 At present I get 1,800 yuan per month . 
 That's not the problem I care about . You can decide on my capacity and experience . 
 Thank you , Mr . Brown . I really appreciate your assistance . 
 What's the matter , Andy ? 
 Have you hurt yourself ? 
 Try and stand up . Can you stand up ? Here . Let me help you . 
 I think that the doctor had better see you . I'll telephone Dr Carter . The doctor says that he will come at once . I'm sure that you need an X-ray , Andy . 
 Oh , hello , yes , arm ... I've just lost my bank stuff . 
 You know my bank stuff . My card , my book ... 
 Jim Chan . The account's in my name . Is that all you need to know ? 
 John , I ’ Ve asked you not to smoke in here ! I don ’ t want to see you smoking in my office again . 
 That ’ s what you said the last time ! If you want to smoke , you ’ ll have to use your break time and go outside ! 
 How should we commemorate the centenary of the founding of the university ? We have been given quite a large budget to pay for some events . 
 Do you think that we should invite alumni and former professors ? 
 Good idea . We should also hold a series of presentations . We could have presentations on the history of the university , the courses we offer , and our links with other universities . 
 We could have another on the successes of graduates from here . 
 That ’ s an excellent idea . Hopefully , we would be able to make a profit ! A few professors and students are writing a book on the history of the university . 
 A group of students from the art and music faculty are producing a short film . 
 Why didn ’ t you call me last night ? 
 Why didn ’ t you phone me from a callboy ? 
 Tell me why you didn ’ t come to see me tonight then . 
 Welcome to IBA . What can we do for you ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . We value all of our customers , regardless of circumstances . What can we do to help ? 
 If you think it will be very short-term , I would recommend you go with the 60 - day loan . Then it can be paid back quicker , so you won't have to consider it in the future . 
 John , I was talking to the travel agent about where we might be taking our vacation this year . 
 What are you talking about ? 
 You and I have been together for a whole year , and our vacation time should be about the two of us ! 
 With that attitude , I don't really think we have much more to discuss here . 
 Can I still catch T107 for Xiamen ? 
 That's too bad . Can I take another train ? 
 That's great ! I will take the next train . 
 Shall I pay extra charge ? 
 Is the view going to be ok ? 
 I ’ ll do my best . 
 Mary , I heard you moved again . 
 You mean noise ? How could it be ? 
 Mary , this is your homeroom . It's 213 . Remember that . 
 You sit in there , listen to the morning announcement with other kids , and then you go to your classes . 
 But I have to go to my homeroom . 
 No . 
 Stop worrying , Mary . You'll do just fine . 
 Let me see . Your plane leaves from Gate 12 . You should go to Gate 12 to board your plane 
 Take the escalator over there and turn left , you'll see the sign . 
 I think mum should not take sides . After all , we are all her children . 
 It ’ s unfair . 
 I'd like you to do me a favor . 
 Can you mail this at the post office for me ? I have to go to the doctor for an appointment and I don't have enough time to go to the post office . 
 Are you telling us a lie again ? 
 All right . But what was the trouble ? 
 The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ? 
 It better be more than last year . 
 Check out , sir ? 
 No problem.How would you like to pay ? 
 Hello ! How do I get more amenities ? 
 I'm talking about the free stuff , like soap and shampoo . 
 No , no . I've got plenty left . 
 What am I going to do about souvenirs ? 
 Yes , I've got enough soap for my use , but no extra soap for souvenirs . 
 Please ! Free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs . 
 Do you know who Ammo Hung is ? 
 You know only one aspect of him . Do you know what he would do in the kitchen ? 
 In the kitchen , with his wife by his side he still puts on quite a dinner time show . 
 Imagine a chef chopping vegetables on fast forward . Picture a man making a stir-fry , tossing the mixture up in the air , and then catching it , every last bit , in his work . And his culinary motto is ' Enjoy the moment . ' If you want to know hey theycook , visit www.StudioClassroom.com.tw for the recipe . 
 Oh , blonde , she's very blonde ... quite short hair ... 
 No , not at all . Very straight . Her hair comes down like this ... just over the ears . 
 No ... no . I think you're thinking of someone else . 
 Er ... what else can I tell you ? Er ... she's got ... er a ... round face , a very round face , and a very big mouth , sort of wide mouth , when she laughs , her face is all mouth . 
 Hello , sir . Can I help you ? 
 What ’ s the job title ? 
 You need to fill out an Application Form . 
 It is on the desk over there . Be sure to fill out everything . Don ’ t leave any blank spaces . When you ’ re done bring the application to me . 
 Good afternoon ! 
 Fine , thanks . I am Wang Lin . 
 Is this your first time in Beijing ? 
 Here is my phone number . If you need anyone to show you around , call me . 
 Haven't run into you for ages ! 
 Really ? 
 I'd like a one-inch photo for my interview . 
 I want to fetch them in 3 days . 
 Are you driving a motorcycle or an automobile ? 
 Fine . You can either park in the student lot or on the street . Do you know what a handicapped space is ? 
 Well , when you see the blue spots with the handicapped logo , do not park there unless you have a special permit . Are you going to be parking in the daytime or the evening ? 
 Then you also need to be aware of the time limits on the street signs . Have you seen those signs ? 
 The signs always tell you how long you can park there and on what days . Do you know how to read the curb colors ? 
 Well , just as long as you realize that red means no parking and white means loading and unloading , I think you know what you need to know . 
 Hey , Pat ! Yeah , I haven ’ t seen you in ages ! How is going ? 
 Yeah ? How ’ s he doing ? 
 Oh yeah ? 
 Ha ha , really ? 
 What kind of account do you prefer ? Checking account or savings account ? 
 Ok , please just fill out this form and show us your ID card . 
 Tell me about how you work here . 
 Do you like our new history teacher ? 
 You can't say that ! He's a very knowledgeable person . 
 How ’ s the food ? 
 Well I don ’ t think so . I don ’ t like it at all ! 
 I eat dog food when my parents are out . 
 Poor us ! All this junk food lacks nutrition ! 
 Good idea ! 
 Hello . I'm thinking about watching a Chinese traditional opera with a foreign girl . What's on this weekend ? 
 It's a good thing that I have choices here . Can you tell me about the one on Saturday ? 
 What about the performance itself ? 
 Wow , a story about the clever Monkey King . It's a classic and children's favorite . 
 Wonderful ! How much is the ticket ? 
 Hello . May I help you ? 
 Don ’ t worry , we ’ ll try to help you . Will you please fill out this form ? 
 This is for registration . After you have given us your personal details , we'll match these against new jobs as they come in . And we ’ ll contact you when there is a job that suits you . 
 Maybe several weeks , maybe several months . It's hard to tell . 
 Actually , many jobs are filled by people who select vacancies from the display boards there . 
 My advice is to keep looking for jobs yourself . Check the job boards at the job center regularly and check the newspapers daily . If you have friends or relatives here , ask them for help , too . 
 Keep in touch . 
 I am sorry , you have the wrong number . 
 Can you help me do an internet search ? 
 I want to find information on the American Civil War . 
 Yes , I want to know about the battle of Gettysburg . 
 Oh wow , there are a lot of sites . 
 Thanks . 
 Thanks . If I ’ m interested , I ’ ll go to the library . 
 Excuse me , miss . What's the tour time we have ? 
 Got it . Thank you . 
 That's the new teacher . 
 She's very nice . 
 English , of course . 
 Yes . She teaches our class three times a week . 
 Not very much . 
 I'm taking a date to a restaurant , so could you please direct me to a good one ? 
 She deserves nothing but the best , of course . 
 I promised her I would take her out to a restaurant . Do you have another one in mind ? 
 Great food and lots of patrons ? What more could I want ? Please reserve a table for me . 
 OK ... well , then how much is one jin ? 
 30,000 NT for ginseng ? ! Do I have to buy a whole jin ? 
 Whew ! That sounds more like my price range . I'll take two liangs . 
 This little red fruit looks good . What's it good for ? 
 Uh ... , I'm not even married yet . How about this brown dried fruit ? 
 And how about these little brown chips ? 
 I'm going to need a taxi . 
 A private vehicle , huh ? No , a taxi is okay . 
 No , I wouldn't be caught dead in a limo . 
 I'm headed to Rockefeller Center . 
 Right now . 
 Good , I'm leaving my room in about one minute . 
 Why not go to the supermarket today , the coupon will be past due in three days . 
 Let me check . Yes , we can .

 That is so nice of you . If I like the service and the training equipment , I think I well join the club . 
 It wasn't me . 
 No , I'm Mary . 
 No , I'm in Class There . 
 Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it . 
 Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy . 
 It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress . 
 I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team . 
 What's your name , please ? 
 Oh , yes Mr.Chou . We have been looking forward to this . 
 Ok , I will call you if you give me your name card . 
 In that case , just tell me your phone number . 
 Is your website address ' www . zhilian . com . CN ' ? 
 I am sorry , could you repeat it please ? 
 I'm looking for a gift for my daughter . 
 Yes , she needs something to help her at school . 
 That sounds good . How much is one ? 
 Only $ 2,100 ? Okay , let me have one . 
 Let me dig my VISA out of my purse . 
 Do I need to buy anything else ? 
 Thank you so much . 
 Which service offered by your bank do you use most ? 
 Do you ever ask you bank for traveller ’ s cheques ? They are much safer than carrying lots of cash around . 
 Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills ? I use direct debit . 
 That ’ s good idea . You don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . I suppose you have a mortgage too . 
 I have a deposit account with my bank . There are some restrictions on withdrawing money , but the interest rate is much higher . 
 That ’ s great . But I prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain . 
 I am washing clothes . Are you hungry now ? Wait for a moment , I'll cook dinner for you . ( Steven bends his brows ) 
 I can do all the housework . We don't need a maid . 
 We really don't need to . 
 Give me some time to think about it . 
 Good afternoon.It ' s very nice to see you again . 
 I'm much better.The stomachache is gone , and the doctor is about to give me another endoscope examination to see whether the ulcer has healed . 
 How beautiful they are ! Thank you so much . 
 You're so thoughtful ! 
 Thank you for coming.Good - bye . 
 Dad ! I don't have time ! I'll be late for school ! 
 Dad , I never eat breakfast . 
 Uh ! Dad ! 
 Alright . You win . Please pass the brain food . 
 I get along pretty well with most of them . 
 I think the key point is to be considerate of your co-workers ' feelings and needs and make a good working environment . 
 Tony , could you tell me if there are any special rules about the job ? 
 Is there anything else ? How about my salary ? 
 Wow , thank you for telling me these . Do you mind telling me something else , like attendance record , holiday , and how to ask for leave ? 
 Okay , that's good . I get it . 
 Let's see , sir . According to your file , you watched ' Titanic ' Monday evening . 
 Well , your word overrules the file , sir . One moment , please . 
 Sir , I deleted the $ 10 , but I had to add a $ 2 service charge to your bill . 
 Please don't blame me , sir . Blame the computer programmer . 
 If it makes you feel any better , other guests feel the same way . 
 How do you do , Mr . James ? Thank you for asking me to come in . 
 Thank you . 
 Thank you . 
 This room is unfit for humans . I want another room , and I want a refund for tonight . 
 In a word , cockroaches ! 
 Thank you . I'm glad that you don't believe that your guests are liars .

 Where do they come from ?

 The Ukraine team took the lead by 3 to 1 at the end of the first half . 
 It doesn't seem to be so easy . 
 What's your flight number ? 
 Are you a transfer passenger , sir ? 
 Then the north line is the right track for you to take . 
 Hey ! A real cook gets down and dirty . Besides , I think I look good covered in baking mix ... 
 Well , your making cinnamon toast inspired me to go out and buy a waffle maker . 
 I know . You just add milk , eggs and a little oil to the baking mix and stir ... 
 When I quarrel with my husband . He didn't even try to cool me out . 
 I was so angry that I could not keep cool . What I need is just an apology . 
 Yes , I am . What's wrong ? 
 OK . No problem . 
 But it's said that you dance wonderfully well . 
 No . Just occasionally . 
 I love rumba and waltz . 
 To tell the truth , I don't like it . It's too fast . 
 OK . See you then . 
 Hi ! I'm happy you could make it . 
 What can I get you ? 
 I have here our price sheet on a F . O . B . basis . The prices are given without engagement . 
 Take your time . 
 I ’ m surprised to hear you say so . You know that the cost of pro - duction has been skyrocketing in recent years . 
 Well , to get the business done , we can consider making some concessions in our price . But first , you ’ ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us , so that we may adjust our prices accordingly . 
 Well , as I ’ Ve said , if your order is large enough , we ’ re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent . 
 How much do you mean then ? Can you give me a rough idea ? 
 Impossible . How can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ? 
 Very well , I will . 
 Well ... uh ... how about a glass of juice instead ? 
 Oh , yeah . Well , uh , about your mug ... 
 May I help you ? 
 Let me see your library card . 
 You can apply for one right now , if you ’ d like . 
 Could you fill out this application ? 
 Could you please sign the back of the card ? 
 That ’ s it . 
 When you told your mom you would be home around 2 am , She must have a cow ! 
 John Li's Office , this is Jenny , may I help you ? 
 Yes , but let me check if he's available . 
 Excuse me ? Is this where I register ? I ’ d like to sign up for my courses for next semester . 
 Here you are . 
 Yes . I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology . 
 Yeah . Here ’ s my list . I ’ m not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them though . 
 Oh yeah ! Almost forgot ! I need to take fundamental linguistics , consumer psychology and neuroanatomy . 
 Good morning , sir . May I help you ? 
 Why ? 
 OK , did you bring your household register or residence booklet ? 
 It doesn't matter , they are the same thing . 
 OK , I will register you in our database system . What's your name , please ? 
 Please get a mug shot in the next room . 
 But we need them taken with digital cameras . 
 That's all . Come here a week later and get your ID card . 
 Stop talking about her . She gives me goose bumps . I never wish to be in her sight . 
 Many people , many tastes . She looks pretty , but the way she speaks gives you goose bumps . I feel sick of it . 
 Yeah , it ’ s pretty nice , but its so red because of air pollution . 
 Yeah , the smog from all these cars gets into the air and turns the sunlight red . 
 Yeah , more people need to take public transportation or carpool . 
 Yeah , it ’ s your turn to drive next week . Don ’ t be late picking me up . 
 Well , give me a call if you can ’ t make it for some reason . 
 Yeah , I just need to make the final touches . 
 I'm finished . What do you think ? 
 Do you really ? 
 Well , thank you very much . 
 You owe me $ 55 . 
 You are very welcome . Come back again . 
 Oh , it ’ s the latest novel by ray blue . It ’ s a sic-fi thriller . 
 He does . He ’ s good at this genre too . It ’ s a captivating read . 
 Yes , I would . I need to buy a textbook for my course and , as you know , I love browsing through the latest paperbacks . 
 I want to look at nelson Mandela ’ s autobiography . 
 Hey , Rose , how are you feeling ? 
 Oh , Look at the baby.It ' s so beautiful.Is it a boy or a girl ? 
 Can I hold it for a moment ? 
 Oh , how adorable ! She's got your eyes . 
 When are you returning home ? 
 You can use some time off.You ' Ve been working too hard anyway . 
 No , It is a middle-sized private company . 
 Yes , there are approximately three hundred people . 
 I ’ m waiting for a bus and going for a walk in the park . 
 I always like to go for a walk before a supper . 
 Would you excuse me ? 
 I ’ Ve got a business call that I really need to take . 
 Dad , when will you finish your cooking ? 
 So what should I do now ? 
 Where's the bowl gone ? 
 Dad ? 
 OK , got it , but its shape is so strange . I don't like it . 
 Maybe . 
 Mommy , dinner , please ! 
 Well , let's get together soon . 
 Sure . How about Monday ? 
 Well unfortunately , I'm tied up on Tuesday . I'm supposed to have lunch with an important visitor from out of town , and I don't think there's any way I can get out of it.Are you free on Wednesday ? 
 Well , I'm afraid Thursday is out for me . I'm expected to attend a meeting of our personnel committee , and it's very important for me to be there . 
 Friday sounds good . Where should we meet ? 
 Excuse me , Mr . Emory ? Mr . Macmillan , would like to know if you have the completed schedule for next week ? 
 Thank you , sir . Sorry to trouble you . 
 What do we need for the barbecue ? 
 I can ’ t wait to start cooking . I ’ Ve bought the grill and charcoal.Do you have enough plates and utensils ? 
 And if people drop them , they won ’ t break.We ’ ll need to buy some buns to make hot dogs and hamburgers . 
 I brought some cheese to make cheeseburgers and some onions for the hot dogs.We ’ ll need some tomato catchup and some barbecue sauce . 
 How long does it take to cook meat on the barbecue ? 
 They can cook them themselves to make sure exactly how they like it . 
 So do you think you can get to the office alone ? 
 Do you think the taxi driver will understand you ? 
 Ok but how will we know if you are going to be late ? 
 Jack , what do you think about the election ? 
 How many people have flung their hats into the ring ? 
 Who do you think will be elected ? 
 I think Mr . White would be elected , you know he has spent millions in this campaign and he blasted the opposition in his campaign speech . 
 I love ice cream . 
 I like both strawberry and coffee ice cream . 
 May I help you ? 
 Yes , madam . There's one in the seat pocket . Here you are . 
 Should I bring you some water ? 
 Can I help you ? 
 May I have your name , please ? 
 OK . Let me see . Air China has a flight on October 15th at 10:00 in the morning . 
 Single or return ? 
 Economy fare for single ticket from New York to Beijing is 400 dollars . 
 Yes . Please arrive at the airport one hour before departure . 
 Did Roll win the race ? 
 But anyway , he won at last . 
 It's a fine day today , isn't it ? 
 How nice seeing the sun back again ! The air is so fresh . 
 Well , the weather is so unpredictable this time of year . 
 Look ! It looks as if it is going to rain . 
 The weather is often quite different from the weather forecast . 
 Okay . 
 You did ? that is great ! 
 No I am free , I will be there , what time the thing starting ? 
 Ok , great , should I bring anything ? 
 sure , I will be happy to bring a few , what is the address ? 
 Got it . 
 I think you'd better take the No . 16 bus . It can take you right there . 
 Every fifteen minutes . 
 The No . 2 bus also goes to the railway station . You may take it . 
 The bus stop is not far from here . Go straight on and you can easily find it . 
 You are welcome . 
 I think meeting people . There are people from all over the country , all over the world , all walks of life which is the most interesting part of my job . 
 Well , I work very long hours , ten hours a day is quite normal . And if something important comes up , I ’ m often in the office until 8 or 9 in the evening . 
 O . K . Let me see . That will be $ 104.99 . 
 Yes , miss , but there is a five percent sales tax in Maryland . 
 No problem . How would you like to pay for these ? 
 $ 110.00 , your change is $ 5.01 . Thanks very much . 
 Do you need a ticket ? 
 Yes , it is . 
 You can be assured of it . 
 I haven't seen her yet . 
 Tell me how she looks . 
 What height is she ? 
 That's nice , but tell me what she looks like . 
 I think I might've bumped into her before . 
 I believe so . 
 Hello . Yes , I'm here to redeem a Treasury Note . It's not at the maturity date yet , but it is an emergency . 
 There you are . As you can see , the maturity isn't up yet . 
 Oh , really ? No , I wasn't aware of that . 
 Right , that ends the third and final part of our presentation . I'd like to end by emphasizing the main points . I'll give you a brief summary . There are three potential areas for development in the future , domestic , overseas market , and the internet . Each of these markets have their own particular need for marketing strategy ... for domestic , we can rely on past research , for overseas markets we depend heavily on our cultural consultants , and for the internet , we need to redo our image to appeal to a young set of consumers . Our main issue here is that we need to be sensitive to the needs of different markets in order to continue to see success . Mark , did you have anything to add ? 
 Mom , did you see Andy's dog ? 
 Mom , please . Can I have a pet dog like Andy's ? 
 Mom , we can keep it on the balcony , right ? 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 That's a good place to go at this time . How about this route ? 
 No , sir , you have to deal with your own meal since we charge you only $ 80 for the trip . 
 I love you , too . 
 Oh . My God ! Are you serious ? 
 No ! I have been expecting this moment for a long time . I mean my answer is ' yes ' . 
 I trust you . We'll be happy . 
 It's so beautiful . 
 What do I do with it ? 
 Please . 
 So I don't have to worry about them . 
 I'll take home economics . 
 Who was the best teacher that you ever had ? 
 What was she like ? 
 What kind of things did you learn ? 
 Anything ? Do you really believe that we can do anything ? 
 You said she was strict . Did she have a lot of rules ? 
 I see . She sounds like she really cared about her students . 
 Really ? Doesn ’ t every teacher have a teacher ’ s pet ? 
 Do you know what she is doing now ? 
 Have you ever read one of the books ? 
 Why don ’ t you recommend one to me ? 
 What's the matter with my throat , doctor ? 
 Is it serious ? 
 Excuse me . can you tell me where Main Street is ? 
 Is it far ? 
 Thanks a lot 
 Excuse me , can you tell me where I can take a taxi ? This is the first time I have been in England , so I don't know where I can do at all . 
 Thank you very much , by the way , is it quite expensive to take a taxi ? 
 All right . I only hope to get a skillful driver , and drive me to my stop safe way . 
 Thanks a lot , bye bye . 
 Grant . How is everything ? 
 Sure . What ’ s it about ? 
 Could you show me the T-shirt on the model ? 
 What's the price ? 
 Can you make it any cheaper ? 
 I'll take it if you give me a discount . 
 OK . I'll take the blue one . 
 Yes . I graduated this past June . 
 Guangzhou University . 
 I received a bachelor's degree in Economics . 
 My major courses were Microeconomics , Macroeconomics , International Trade , International Finance , World Economy , Psychology and Business English 
 Because I was quite interested in Economics then . 
 I can also speak a little Japanese . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Great ! 
 Yes , there ’ s a department store in Wang Fu Jing . 
 It ’ s to the east of Tiananmen Square . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Umm ... I think so . What's up ? 
 Really ? Are you OK ? 
 If the injury is workplace related I'm sure it's completely covered . 
 Sure . Basically we have two insurance policies for employees ... workman's compensation and medical insurance . The company pays the premiums for workman's compensation , and for a significant part of the medical coverage , but you pay part of that premium , too . 
 Yep . Every country in the world has a different system , but here we buy insurance from a private provider . 
 That's right . The company pays for all your medical bills and there is also some financial compensation if you have to take days off to see doctors or spend time recuperating . 
 Oh I ’ m enjoying myself but it ’ s so hot here 
 Well it can be but Shanghai is much warmer than London . 
 Actually I think the buses and trains here are more modern . 
 Oh , I think Shanghai is much more crowded than London . 
 A house warming party ? 
 Congratulations ! That ’ s wonderful . I bet both of you are quite happy . 
 I understand . That ’ s why Christopher and I want to find a place in a small town , far from the city . 
 I agree . That ’ s why Christopher is already looking for a job in Maine , or Wisconsin . 
 Mom , I don't want to bathe today . 
 Mom , I'm tired . I feel sleepy . I want to go to bed right now . 
 OK . I promise . Thank you , Mom . 
 Look into the mirror and see if it'll do . 
 Welcome here again . 
 What do you mean ? 
 She is a grow-up . She can make her own decision . 
 Peter , it's time to eat breakfast . 
 Alright , you'd better hurry , your bus is coming . 
 Oh , dear , go get another pair . I'll help you change your shorts . 
 Non-tariff barrier is another mean to restrict imports . 
 For example , some countries restrict imports by quantitative restriction . 
 This is used to protect local industries or to achieve certain political objectives . 
 Technical barriers are set for imported goods . 
 Yes , some countries may use some of the unnecessary health rules to exclude foreign food . 
 Thank you . I ’ Ve worked pretty hard to be able to list those accomplishments . 
 To be honest , I don ’ t plan in that much detail . My goals tend to be general ; I define success according to the job at hand . I see myself advancing as I succeed , but I don ’ t necessarily dwell on 
 That depends a bit on the problem at hand . There are certain situations in which a manager can give a general directive , and expect his employees to know how to take the initiative on the detail 
 I see myself as an encourager . Of course , sales can be quite competitive and sometimes people in this field have a secret desire for others to fail . In my last job , each representative handled 
 I wish you would not be so selfish . 
 But you should at least consider your son's future . 
 Oh , my god . How can you stand living in such a messy dorm ? 
 Have you even tried to clean it once since you moved in at the beginning of the semester ? 
 I think we need to restart the dormitory sanitation inspection system . 
 Can you play tennis ? 
 It is interesting , isn't it ? 
 Can you teach me ? 
 Let me try . Oh , I missed ! 
 High ? 
 Oh ! I hit it . 
 Thank you . I think I like playing it . 
 My pleasure ! How much would you like to spend on your date ? 
 You should know that our hotel chef was trained in Paris . The service and food are world-class . 
 You can't go wrong with Gramercy Tavern . It's famous for its food , service , and live jazz . 
 At once , sir . You'll love this place , I assure you . 
 Oh , yes , it was very interesting . 
 Oh , I didn't actually teach in the schools . I taught after school . I taught in English institutes . 
 Yes . That's right.But children in Taiwan are very different from children in America.At least as far as studying is concerned.Many children in Taiwan go to special institutes after school . 
 That's right.After their school day is over , they go to a special institute to study math or English.They are very serious about learning over there . 
 Of course they do.You know , Eliza , before I went over there I thought the same thing . I thought that maybe kids in Taiwan study too much.But now that I've worked there , and taught them , I feel it is a good thing.Their parents are very concerned about their education . More than American parents are . And that is good . American kids don't study enough . 
 So it was interesting for me to see parents very concerned about education.They would come to me after the class and ask how their son or daughter was doing . I don't think that's a bad thing . I think it's a good thing.In America , too many parents don't pay attention . 
 As an English teacher , I tried to make the lessons as fun as possible . I tried to have a good time with my classes . The students often enjoyed it.And if the students enjoyed it , they learned more . So it was a good experience . 
 That's a stereotype we Americans have.We think that Asian kids are very obedient and quiet.But it's not true . There are plenty of naughty kids too . 
 I don't know . In Costa Rica , I taught adults.So it was a very different thing . So I really can't compare . 
 After going through an episode like that I'm not surprised . How's her headspace ? 
 I'm proud of you for standing by her . I think you've helped make a big difference in her life . 
 No , why ? 
 She doesn't need to do that , I didn't do anything . 
 Good morning , sir . Are you checking out now ? 
 Fine . This is your bill , Mr . Smith . Four nights at 100 dollars each , and here are the meals that you had in our hotel . That makes a total of 660 dollars . 
 Certainly . May I have your card , please ? 
 Please sign your name here . 
 Yes , we'll keep it for you . How many pieces of your luggage ? 
 That's fine . Have a nice day ! 
 How much are these apples ? 
 Do you accept coupons ? 
 Here are my coupons . Is that enough ? 
 Ms . Montgomery ? This is Richard Thomas . I ’ m sorry to bother you at home , but I ’ Ve got a bit of a problem . 
 My daughter ’ s just banged up her knee pretty badly and I ’ m going to have to take her to the hospital . I ’ ll be about two hours late . 
 It seems that he has gone ape over the girl . 
 Yes , he ’ s been like this for two weeks . We don ’ t know what to do . 
 Yeah . But he just didn ’ t listen . 
 Of course , here is the catalogue and the price list . You can have a look . We also have many other kinds of carpets . 
 Of course we can . We can provide the quantity you ask for . 
 No problem . Let's check the terms of contract . 
 Not really , Betty . What do you need ? 
 Sure . I just need to do one other job first . How about if I come up around 11:30 ? 
 Yes , what do you want to know ? 
 Yes . Copywriters are supposed to design and write articles for the advertising company . 
 Hi . 
 I'm not sure yet . 
 Yes . When ? 
 Sorry , I didn't hear you . Can you say that again please ? 
 Oh , I'm busy then . Can we meet a little later ? 
 OK . Where ? 
 Oh , Where is that ? 
 OK , I'll meet you there . 
 I need to speak with David Lin . 
 Thank you , I'll try again later . 
 Dad , I haven't thought about it . I'm still young . 
 I like playing the piano . 
 What's wrong , Dave ? You look down today . 
 Well , English is a " paper tiger " . Its natural enemy is adequate practice . 
 I suggest you read English texts aloud every day , and try to speak more . That will be beneficial to cultivate your sense of the language . 
 Good evening ! This is Mr . Smith in room 609 . 
 I'm going to Shanghai early tomorrow morning . So I would like to request an early morning call . 
 I have to be at the conference room of the Garden Hotel in Shanghai by 10 o'clock . I think it will take me three hours to get there . It means that I'll have to be on the road before 7 o'clock at the latest . 
 Well , in that case , I would like you to wake me up at 5:45 . 
 Good night . 
 Could you ? Thank you . 
 I ’ m actually here on business . 
 I ’ m an IT salesman . 
 It ’ s very interesting actually . 
 Thank you very much . Bye . 
 Yes , fine . I had something wrong with my stomach . I won ’ t go into detail , but it wasn ’ t serious . 
 I think most people are a little nervous about it . I was really very , very nervous just before I had the operation , but the anaesthetist gave me an anaesthetic and the next thing I remember was waking up after the operation . 
 Well , the nurse game me plenty of painkillers , but it did feel uncomfortable . I wasn ’ t permitted to eat anything for 48 hours . That was the worse thing . 
 I certainly was ! However , the doctor gave me a list of food I couldn ’ t eat for another 72 hours , and steak was on the list ! 
 No , not at all . I stopped taking painkillers after a couple of days . 
 Oh , yes . The nurse were very kind , though they were strict about what I could drink . In the end , I just drank water and nothing else . Everyone was very professional and I actually enjoyed some aspects of my stay . 
 Sorry to hear that . Could you tell me what were in your purse ? 
 When did you come to America ? 
 Could you recall when and where you lost it ? 
 OK . I have written it down . Who is your emergency contact person in America ? 
 OK . We will contact you as soon as we have any clues . 
 He used to be a policeman . 
 Yeah . He's a private eye now . 
 Certainly . 
 I often play badminton with my parents . 
 Hey , I'm good at playing it . 
 My parents . 
 How about you , Daniel ? 
 Well , who is your favorite football player ? 
 This is a good basic computer package . It's got a good CPU , 256 megabytes of RAM , and a DVD player . 
 Yes , it has a built-in modem . You just plug a phone line into the back of the computer . 
 A 15 - inch monitor is included in the deal . If you want , you can switch it for a 17 - inch monitor , for a little more money . 
 Hi Mike . What have you been up to ? 
 Trying to get in shape ? 
 Me too . What are you doing besides exercising ? 
 I think if you eat better , it will help tremendously . 
 Looks like there are a lot of things to do to stay healthy . 
 Hello . May I speak to David ? 
 David Bush . 
 Sorry , I dialed the wrong number . 
 We , I ’ d like to go to Australia . I know it ’ s far to go , but I think it would be something different and special . 
 There are beaches in Australia too , but I would prefer a more active holiday this year . We could visit Ayers rock and the great barrier reef . It would be so exciting . 
 Oh , come on ! A tour of Australia would be relaxing because you ’ d be doing something different and not working . 
 I think we should go for two weeks . We could spend a week in the bush and a week at the great barrier reef-including a few day on the beach for tired office workers ! 
 We could hire a car and travel around the interior of Australia for several days . If we hire a car , we can go where we like . 
 It looks like I might have convinced you to go to Australia ! 
 Yes . Let's go Dutch . 
 You are always so hospitable . 
 Well , it depends . You see , there are eight famous Chinese for instance , the Sichuan cuisine , and the Hunan cuisine . 
 That's right . If you like hot dishes , you could try some . 
 Then there's the Cantonese cuisine and the Kiangsu cuisine . Most southerners like them . 
 There's the Beijing roast duck . 
 You can find it in most restaurants , but the best place is certainly Quanjude Restaurant . 
 Not too near but not too far either . A taxi will take you there in 15 minutes , If the traffic is not too bad , I mean . 
 Let me write it down on this slip of paper for you . You can show it to the taxi-driver . 
 May I take your order now ? 
 I recommend the roast pork chops . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 For whom ? 
 What symptoms does she have ? 
 I see . Don't worry , just a common cold . 
 Patulin will be enough . 
 Nine pills per day , and three pills after each meal . 
 It's my pleasure . 
 We have two direct flights . Would you like a morning one or an afternoon one ? 
 Single or return ? 
 Can you show me how to use chopsticks ? 
 Oh , it is not easy to learn ! 
 Well , I don't think I can manage with it . 
 That's good , thank you . 
 You shouldn't grab someone else's shirt . That's a foul . 
 You can touch them only between the shoulder and the knees . 
 Before we start , let's have a moment of silence for our fallen men . 
 What's the route ? 
 If only I could join it ! 
 What about that one ? 
 No , sir . You can sit where you like . 
 What's the trouble , ma'am ? 
 What did the young man look like ? 
 To which direction did he run ? 
 Hi , long time no see . How have you been ? 
 Tell me all about it . 
 Oh , I see . What makes you think that ? 
 Really ? What happened ? 
 I see what you mean . I understand why you're concerned . Have you tried talking to your son about it ? 
 You may be right , but it doesn't hurt to find out more about what's going on in his life . 
 I don't know about that , but my door is always open . Stop by anytime . 
 No , she's wearing my Chinese zodiac sign . 
 Yeah , are you surprised ? 
 Can you tell me the differences between a letter and a memorandum , Miss Thong ? 
 Should we use the layout we use for a letter when we write a memorandum ? 
 Of course , let me find one for you . 
 What about a motel ? 
 It's a hotel but cheaper and offers free parking . 
 Then let's stay in a motel . I am sure you will like it . 
 I haven't heard anything . 
 Are you serious ? 
 That's great . Congratulations . 
 You have no idea how happy I am for you . 
 I believe you were the best choice for that promotion . I really do . 
 Centrum ? We have bottles of thirty and one hundred tablets . Which kind do you want ? 
 And what kind of toothbrushes would you like ? 
 Sure . This brand is supposed to be very good , but they're expensive . Those are new products . They come in several colors and sizes . There is also hard , soft , and medium . 
 This one is 10 % off . That one has no reduction , but you can get a free tube of toothpaste with six toothbrushes . 
 That's right . 
 And here is your aspirin . What else did you say you want ? 
 Anything else ? 
 Sure . Here you are . This one is excellent . Just mix one drop of it with milk . 
 The man behind your mother must be your elder brother . 
 He looked his age . 
 Yes , sir . My name is Ellen . How may I help you ? 
 Certainly , sir . There ’ s a flight at 8: 35 a . m . and one at 10 . 
 Sure . 
 It's very exciting . I think . 
 I don't think I share your view there.The writer is writing about history , society , human nature and so on.It ' s too hard to understand . 
 Hey , watch where you ’ re going ! 
 Oh ... I don ’ t know . 
 Oh , wait a second , you seem really familiar , I think I know you from somewhere . 
 Ouch ! My ankle ! I think it ’ s broken ! You can ’ t just leave me like this ! Are you calling an ambulance ? 
 Tyler residence . 
 No , this is her sister , Nancy . 
 Oh . Can I take a message ? 
 Okay . I'll give her the message . 
 Bye . 
 OK , it's my pleasure . How many tickets ? 
 But I am only half a person as you and they charge both of us the same price tickets . 
 Dad , it makes no sense . 
 Yeah , I make certain . A half-price ticket cuts us one point five Yuan . 
 Sure . What kind of apartment are you looking for ? 
 OK . Would you like to live in a studio ? 
 I want to buy two tickets for tonight's concert . 
 Ordinary one , please . 
 I think they are too far from the stage . I want two in row 6 . 
 Excuse me , sir . Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 All right . How much would you like to change ? 
 Pardon ? 
 I'm sorry , sir , after 7 
 I'm afraid we cannot help you , sir , because that would be violating the regulations . I owe an apology for doing nothing about it . 
 Could I speak to Mr . Wu , please ? 
 This is Kevin . 
 Uh-oh . We don't have a flashlight . 
 I sure hope so . 
 What is your address , sir ? 
 OK , someone will be there by 12:15 . 
 Well , Brad from school asked me out just today . 
 But I don't know what to do . 
 My mom says no boyfriend until I'm in college . 
 Actually , that's what a lot of parents in Taiwan say to their kids . 
 Total Fitness , why ? 
 Really ? Why not ? I hear it ’ s pretty good . 
 Oh , it ’ s one of those places . 
 Well , they have different rooms . I lift weights by the pool where there aren ’ t so many people . 
 Yeah , they have all the machines , a pool , and a steam room and sauna . 
 The usual . Aerobics , kickboxing , yoga . They just started a Tai Chi class too . 
 Well , I have a guest pass . Why don ’ t you come with me tonight ? 
 Perfect . See you later . 
 What kind of lease is it ? 
 Can I have a month-to-month lease ? I only want to rent the apartment for five months . 
 Well , then I don't think this would be a good apartment for me . Thank you anyway . 
 It's quite cold this early morning , isn't it ? 
 Time sure flies , doesn't it ? 
 I ’ m sure we could get one or two tv companies to come in . Perhaps the president could invite them and do an interview . 
 It will be expensive to do outside the campus . Perhaps we could arrange for some sponsorship . 
 Good thinking ! We should also print some leaflets for students to distribute . 
 We could take out some advertisements to local newspapers . I checked the prices and they are reasonable . 
 Stop running around in front of the TV , will you ? Why don ’ t you just sit and watch ? 
 Then stay away . Nobody's keeping you from doing that . 
 All right , I will explain it to you later on . Now scram . 
 That's exactly what I want , thank you . 
 Oh , I can't . I have a date ! 
 This girl I've been chatting with for the past couple of months . She's really cool and she's driving over here this weekend . 
 Yeah ! I signed up for a website called match @ . com and it is great ! You fill in all your details and preferences , like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets . Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat . 
 It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them ! I am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends ! I think this is a really cool alternative , especially if you are a bit shy . 
 Jim , what do you think of that first interviewee ? 
 Okay , what about the first woman ? 
 All right , and what about the older gentle ? 
 Ohhhh . I hate this part of my job . 
 I had a big argument with david yesterday . I hope he ’ s not still mad at me . 
 he borrowed some money from me and I needed it back . He said he didn ’ t have the money yet . 
 yes , but is got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ’ t have got angry . 
 not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back . 
 no , we didn ’ t . I guess you ’ re right . We should patch things up . 
 Excuse me . Mr . Li . May I ask you some questions ? 
 Can you tell me how many credits would be enough for a Bachelor's degree ? 
 How long does it take to earn a Bachelor's degree ? 
 I ’ d like to apply for a personal loan . 
 A thousand dollars . 
 What ’ s the current interest rate ? 
 Front Desk , may I help you ? 
 Is there anything uncomfortable in your room ? 
 May I have your room number , sir ? 
 OK . Mr . Wang , may I send a room attendant to check it for you first ? 
 ( 15 minutes later ) Mr . Wang , we are deeply sorry for the inconvenience . The maintenance might last for a long time , may I offer you another room ? 
 Excuse me . 
 I bought this circulator here yesterday but it doesn't work . 
 Give me a pack of first-class stamps , please . 
 Yes . I want some post cards and some airmail stamps . I want to send some letters to South America . 
 Can you tell me how much it will cost to send a package to Colombia ? Also , I what to know how long it will take . 
 Do you insure package ? 
 Is there a way that I can be sure that the people in South america receive my package ? 
 One last question-what are your hours ? 
 Thank you , you helped me a lot . 
 Yes , G stands for General Audiences , PG means Parental Guidance suggested , R is restricted to audiences under 18 and X means explicit content . 
 Remember when we were kids ? Theaters wouldn't let kids in to PG moves without a parent . 
 Now with video rentals it's all a personal matter . 
 Now we have to make a choice about what we will see and what we won't . 
 Yes . I gotta review all of them for the final exam . It is just around the corner . 
 That depends . Some semesters have many , some don't . And some courses don't have exams but only ask for papers . That's easy . 
 Honestly speaking , most students prepare it one month before the exam . 
 Of course , it's useful . And it's very crucial to have the copies of teacher's notes , because most questions in the exam are based on them . 
 But the exam is not as simple as you may imagine . We have to stay up late . 
 Yes , some people even pack up his bed quilt and sleep there . That's a little bit crazy . 
 What's changed ? 
 I see . I guess diapers and baby food are expensive.Bringing up children is not easy . 
 You should have more money then . 
 Hmm . You have three cameras . Are you a photographer ? 
 I see . And what's in this bag ? 
 I thought you said you didn't have any food with you today . 
 I'm sorry , Mr . Lee . Egg tarts are food too . We will have to confiscate these . 
 Yes , we will have to dispose of them . 
 I know . One out of every three travelers from Taiwan seems to be carrying them.They are being smuggled in by the thousands . 
 No , not today at least . Enjoy your visit to the United States , Mr . Lee . 
 Did you go camping last Saturday ? 
 How many members were in your party in all ? 
 Did you get caught in the bad storm ? 
 We are planning to go to Beidaihe for vacation . Do you want to go with us ? 
 Where can I find information on this subject ? 
 Will you give some advice on this experiment ? 
 What's his suggestion for this work ? 
 The way I see it is that they'd join us . 
 Peter , have you finished your English composition ? 
 Class starts in twenty minutes . You have to turn it in at the beginning of class today . 
 Do you think you can finish it on time ? 
 You ’ d better hurry ! 
 Sorry ! 
 I scheduled a delivery for tomorrow . 
 I would like to reschedule . 
 Can I have it delivered the day after tomorrow ? 
 Yes , will that be possible ? 
 Is 2:30 Okay ? 
 Thank you , and I'm sorry for the change of plans . 
 Maybe you can't be so sure . 
 But some people use this occasion to create trouble . Have you heard of the Black Friday Virus on the computer ? It is designed to break out on every Friday the Thirteenth . 
 My computer isn ’ t running at the same speed it used to be , it is testing my patience everyday . Can you tell me how to make it run faster ? 
 How ? 
 Very useful advice , I will try them right now . 
 Yes.You can use the computer to seta tima.Dial 10 and then time.For example.if you want to get up at 7:15 , you can dial 100715 . 
 Or we can call you tomorrow coming . 
 No problem . Good night . 
 She works as a teller in a bank . 
 Yes . She goes three times a week . 
 She wants to be a manager . 
 She takes classes in accounting and business . 
 I cut it on that blade . 
 Miss Liu , please come in . 
 Copy this report for me . 
 You should use the A4 paper is all right . 
 It is unnecessary . 
 Hello . I would like to buy some business cards . 
 Two thousand would be fine . 
 All I want is the same thing on this card . 
 ... Okay , I'm finished . Here's your form and my old card . 
 Do you think you could finish it in three days ? 
 Your garden is looking very beautiful this summer . The flowers are really colorful . 
 Yes , I do . Those are violets , aren ’ t they ? 
 The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low . Would you like me to cut them off for you ? 
 When the lower branches are removed , you ’ ll be able to sit under the tree . 
 Just make sure children don ’ t play in the flower beds and destroy the flowers . 
 sure , what would you like to discuss ? 
 well , I have to tell you that I'm quite surprised . Is there any possible way to change your mind ? 
 can I ask why ? Were you unhappy working for us ? 
 are you planning on studying abroad ? 
 have you been given a better offer ? 
 well , what's the problem then ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that , but you don't need to quit over that . Why don't you just take a leave of absence ? We can hold your job for you until your mother gets better . 
 sure , we'd be carry to lose a good worker like you . 
 Would you mind if I ask you whether you are married or not ? 
 Do you mean you got a divorce ? 
 911 . What can I do for you ? 
 When did it happen ? 
 Where did it happen ? 
 What was taken ? 
 How do you know there was a break-in ? 
 I will send a squad car to your house right now . 
 What is included in a job advertisement ? 
 What are the accesses of the job ads ? 
 Look , Forest Gump is on at six thirty . 
 Yeah , I am very impressed with Tom Hanks ' performance in the movie . 
 Life is like a box of chocolates , you never know what you're gonna get . 
 You know , it also won 6 Oscar awards in 1995 . Unbelievable ! 
 Yes , the Forrest's experience can encourage the people in trouble . 
 Gucci , I have an idea . Do you want to see this movie together ? 
 Good afternoon . What can I do for you ? 
 Your name , please ? 
 Wait for a minute , Mr . Brown , a single room with bath from today to the fifteenth . 
 Would you like to register now ? 
 Could you fill out this registration form , please ? 
 Yes . Thank you . May I see your passport , please ? 
 Thank you . Will you be paying in cash or by credit card ? 
 Your room number is 210 . The bellboy will show you the way there . I hope you enjoy your stay . 
 How much do you make a month ? 
 Hello , hot water overflowed from the bathtub . Would you help me ? 
 I did it . 
 Ok , I will . 
 I am sorry , I was too tired to fall asleep . 
 Right . Can I compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance ? 
 If you want to live much longer you have to give up smoking . 
 Maybe with the choice of life or death before you , you will find it easier . 
 See all these black areas ? That's tar built up in your Lungs . 
 Look at it this way , when you quit , you will save money , time and your life ! 
 Haven't seen you for ages.Where have you been ? 
 In Thailand . I taught English there . 
 Hmm ... I'll tell you what . I'll lend you four thousand dollars , but you have to pay me back next week . 
 I just got laid off . The awful business , you know . 
 Yeah , I ’ m better after talking to you . 
 Your knowledge of English is really surprising . 
 No , seriously . I'm impressed . 
 A table for two , please . 
 Thank you . It's fine . 
 What do you recommend ? We'd like some of your local specialities . 
 One cream of fish soup and two portions of prawns . 
 No , I think it's enough . 
 A juice and a coke . 
 They're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 . 
 No way , if it still has 21 . 
 20/350 . 
 Oh , yes , it is . 
 You'll find out when we're in the woods and you have to go to the bathroom ... 
 Let's just say I'll have it easy ... 
 I think the four days ' tour from New York to Atlantic City will be fine . 
 What is the departure date ? 
 Mike , what are you doing tonight ? 
 I don't feel like drinking tonight . I'm gonna hang out at YY's . 
 Yeah , but it's expensive . Nah , I'm going to YY's . 
 They ' Ve just renovated the place . You may be surprised . 
 Quite a difference , huh ? 
 Ah hah.Thought you were't drinking . 
 Professor , I will not be here for our next class meeting . 
 I tried to work something out , but I really do have to miss one class . 
 I'm going to be doing a lot of extra reading . 
 Yes , I remember . 
 Sure , no problem . 
 I often recalled the days when Tom and I were madly in love . 
 Yeah . He always tickled my finny bone with his college stories . 
 Definitely not . The most important thing was we loved each other . 
 From Vancouver , we bike along the border all the way to Winnipeg . 
 Relatively , once we're out of Alberta , anyway . Then it's hills again in Aitoba . 
 That's right . And up in to Quebec . And that's where we stop . 
 Are you ready for the cross country of a lifetime ? 
 I'd be glad to have your help . Could you make the air-conditioner cooler ? 
 Good idea . 
 Thank you . Could I have something cold to drink ? 
 Orange juice , please . 
 Yes . 
 One or two cubes will be OK . 
 I'm awfully sorry to have bothered you . 
 Please accept this tip . 
 I'm sorry . Something is wrong with my taxi . 
 Let me stop my car for check . Oh , my god . I got a flat tyre . 
 Sorry . You'd better get off for taking another taxi . 
 For what ? 
 If you don't know it by now , you might as well not bother studying . 
 Yes , I know . 
 At least I ’ m the one who rates with her . I ’ m glad we can still be friends . 
 You are interested in other people ’ s business , aren ’ t you ? 
 Yes . 
 Kobe Bryant , of course . 
 He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers , but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand . 
 indeed , no man can be perfect . He is just so-so in crashing the boards . Usually he plays shooting guard . Rebounding might not be his strong suit . 
 who wouldn't ! My friend Lee went so far as to get an autograph from him . 
 well , nothing more than a jumble of photographs . 
 I have been a salesman . 
 Welcome to my birthday party , I am so happy you can come . 
 Thank you , shall I open it now ? 
 Wow , a remote car model and my favorite brand . I really like it . That is so nice of you . 
 Typical you , always wanting to keep the best things for yourself . The more I appreciate the gift now . 
 Hello . I'm hoping to buy some Treasury Certificates today . Are they available ? 
 Ah , right . How much do I need to spend ? 
 How about Bearer Certificates ? Are they different ? 
 Here we are this is my favorite place . 
 I've never counted . 
 Please be seated . It's my treat today . 
 It's so busy here . 
 What would you like to eat ? 
 Want something to drink ? 
 Can we talk about the working overtime issue ? What ’ s on your mind ? 
 Glad to hear that . Generally , it is 2 to 3 hours more than your working hours . 
 What's wrong , Jerry ? You look so upset . 
 Oh , I'm sorry to hear that . You can go on a holiday cheer you up . 
 Come on . A trip will do you good . Are you doing anything this weekend ? 
 Well , my friends and I are planning on going to Shangri-La on Saturday . Do you want to come with us ? 
 Not very far from here . We'll fly . It's about one and a half hours . 
 There is a large canyon , vast grasslands , ancient forests and mountain lakes . 
 Yes , the scenery there is breathtaking . I have some pictures at home . You can come over and take a look if you like 
 Hey honey ! Where were you ? 
 How was it ? Were there a lot of kids ? 
 Sounds like fun ! When we go he always just likes to play in the sandbox . 
 You should go to the park more often since you don't go to the gym anymore ! 
 Hi , Randy . What are you doing right now ? 
 I ’ Ve got two tickets for a newly released film . Would you like to see it with me ? 
 The film will start at 2 
 In my parking lot , at 2pm . 
 It's wonderful to be in the mountains after a hustle bustle week . 
 Can we stop here for a while ? My backpack is very heavy . 
 Let me see . It's not an eagle . I think it's a vulture . 
 I don't think so . Let's walk by the stream . I am sure we can find the waterfall on the map . 
 I also brought a bottle of water and some provisions . If you are hungry , you can let me know . 
 Well , it is a birch tree.It is not as old as you think . 
 Because its trunk is not thick enough to be like a thousand-year-old tree . 
 You did spend too much , and most of the expense was kind of unnecessary . 
 No , you don't have to spend every penny you make , you could save some every month , like a lot of other people do . 
 You should save in case of an emergency , you need to have more self-control , what things did you spend money on ? 
 Let's bygones be bygones , start saving right now . 
 Yeah , how do you like him ? 
 Can you give me a touch of his character ? 
 I can't find the price tag . 
 But I heard other stores were having great mark-downs on this item . 
 I see , please wrap it . 
 We went out to the stadium . Bob hadn ’ t been to a game for a few weeks . 
 Nope , lost again . But , it was a good game . 
 Not really . It's a dull one , and the production isn't satisfactory , either . 
 To be fair , though , both the costumes and scenery are marvelous . 
 All right . Do you have the receipt ? 
 May I ask why you're returning the radio ? 
 Would you like to exchange it ? 
 Certainly . This will take only a few seconds . 
 Well , I'm afraid your father's not interested in modern films . 
 That sounds fine . 
 Don't drive too fast . 
 Be careful.It ' s dangerous to drive fast . 
 Yes , please . I'd like to start with a chef ’ s salad . 
 I'll have steak . 
 Medium . 
 Peas and carrots . 
 Boiled . 
 I need my minibar restocked . 
 There's not a drop left of anything . 
 Yes , the Perrier and the Jim Beam hit the spot . Let me have three more of each . 
 I really liked the apples . Bring me a couple of apples , please . 
 Oh , yes , one more thing 
 Mom , I'm ready for school . 
 I don't have a fever , and I'm ready for my test . 
 I'm fine , Mom . I feel so much better . I want to go to school . I'm missing out on all the fun . 
 Let me go to school , please ! I'm sick of medicine , sick of soup , and sick of being sick ! 
 No , I first came here 1995 . 
 Well , I am from Canada . Actually . 
 That ' ok . That's happens all the time . 
 Oh , just looking at these club notices . I'm thinking of joining one . Hey-why don't we join a club together ? How about the Tennis Club ? 
 Neither am I . It's just that the best-looking girls are in that club . 
 Well ... What are you interested in ? 
 Joanna , give me a break . 
 Sounds OK to me . I like movies . Hey , Joanna , look - there are a lot of decent-looking guys here . And the club jackets - they're really hot ! I think we made the right choice ! 
 The news goes so fast . Ah , yes , I haven't decided yet . 
 Maybe you are right . But the major is not fit for me . I like architecture more than computers . 
 Well , I know . So I am thinking now . 
 Thank you for your kindness . I will think about it carefully . 
 I've said you will enjoy your life here ! 
 Oh , I've forgotten to tell you . The party is held every other week . And every family gives their own performance each time . 
 That's good ! 
 Oh , my God ! That's my husband , Benjamin . 
 He likes American Idol very much , and he always imitates the contestant at home . I can't believe he got on the stage himself . 
 OK , just ignore him . I've noticed there are lots of exercise facilities in our community . After dinner you can go there for a walk with your family ! 
 Yes , there is one behind our building . And you can play tennis there . But if you want to play tennis there , they will change you 30 Yuan per hour . 
 You are welcome ! We are neighbors ! 
 Yes , they are shy and gentle but very powerful . 
 How wonderful it would be if I had such smiles ! 
 l love it . There is always something fascinating to discover . 
 That's not very easy to say . 
 Can you find many bargains there ? 
 Elegance Hotel , is there anything I can do for you ? 
 All right , single or double room ? 
 All right . We have a single room available right now . 
 578 yuan a night , plus VAT , including air-conditioner and TV . 
 Yes , it includes English breakfast . For the phone , I am afraid you can not . 
 Would you like to confirm the reservation ? 
 I'm sorry . Am I keeping you awake ? 
 I'm sorry . I thought you wouldn't mind . 
 Yes , I'm looking for a new winter coat . 
 I don't know really . What's the fashional color this year ? 
 Good . Red suits me very well . It's a cheerful color , isn't it ? 
 Well , I used to be size fourteen , but I've put on a bit of weight recently , so may be sixteen . 
 I quite like this one . How much is it ? 
 Oh , that's too expensive . Aren't there any cheaper ones ? 
 Yes , I see . I'll take it . Here's $ 200 . 
 Thank you . 
 What's going on ? 
 So what happened ? 
 So what does that have to do with this position ? 
 All under the precept of keeping the funding ? That stinks . 
 That's right . I thought I'd give it a shot . 
 Good evening , sir , and welcome to Chez Attitude . 
 Yes , Mr . Foster , if you would please be seated over in the waiting area , our hostess will be with you in a moment . 
 Of course , I will tell her . 
 Sure , if you would like one of those tables , I could seat you right away . 
 Here are your menus and the wine menu , and would you like to order your drinks now ? 
 Sure , no problem , sir . 
 Everybody , I'd like to propose a toast to Mary Johnson , Teacher of the Year . She worked hard all year . She really deserved the honor . 
 Here's to you , Mary ! 
 I am sorry . I ’ Ve left my disk at home . 
 Didn't you say you were planning a trip to China ? I heard the northwest and north of China are experiencing severe sandstorms ! 
 Definitely . I heard Beijing was experiencing seven degree strong winds ! That is nearly a record high ! 
 Absolutely ! I don't think any planes are going anywhere . The sand being blown around has cut visibility in Beijing to less than 100 meters . But inseems Gansu Province is being hit the hardest . 
 Well , this storm originated in the plateaus in northwest China . At the moment , that area is calmer . 
 What's the problem with your internet ? 
 How long has this been happening ? 
 The internet doesn't come up at all ? 
 There's obviously a problem with your connection . 
 I can send somebody right now to fix it . 
 They'll be there in about an hour . 
 She might like a laptop computer . 
 Might I suggest a Mac ? 
 Well , a 15 - inch Pro is $ 2,100 . 
 Great . How would you like to pay for it ? 
 Let me ring you up . Okay , sign here , please . 
 It'll take her only a few minutes to get online . 
 So long . Thank you for shopping here . 
 I'm afraid he's away from his desk at the moment . 
 He's away on a business trip . He won't be back until some time next week . 
 The best way to reach him is by cell phone . I'll give you his number . 
 Sure . His cell phone is 09112223 33 . And his e-mail is lower case t , smith--that's one word , at , c , c , w , dot , com , dot , t , w . 
 Yes . He usually replies immediately . 
 My pleasure . I hope you get a hold of him . 
 Oh . I don't know what to do . I joined this club a long time ago and I didn't read the fine print . 
 I didn't realize that I have to buy something from them every six months . 
 It's a curio cabinet . The only thing is I don't even own those kinds of little keepsakes . 
 Don't rub it in . Where am I going to put this huge thing ? 
 Hi , Karen . This is John Williams in the purchasing department . Can you check to see if there ’ s a package down there for me ? 
 Thanks , Karen . 
 you can buy the bubble wrap here , but you ’ ll have to stand in line over here to post your passage . 
 it takes about 3 minutes per person , so it ’ ll probably be about an hour ’ s wait . 
 sure . How many would you like ? 
 are you sending them abroad ? 
 do you have any going anywhere in the EU ? If you do , those are less expensive . 
 ok , here you go . That will be 18 pounds and seventy two pence . 
 that ’ s another quid . 
 Hello . Do you have anything for a little girl ? 
 That's a great idea . Show me the Barbie dolls . 
 How lovely ! How much is she ? 
 No problem . Let me have one . 
 No , thank you . That's all I need at the moment . 
 I'll give you cash . 
 Hello , this is Rich . 
 He ’ s not in at the moment . Can I take a message ? 
 Does have your telephone number ? 
 3725015281 ? 
 Right . I ’ ll have him call you back . 
 Sure can . 
 No problem . 
 Goodbye . 
 Here you go .

 Nothing . Just that I don't care for these carrots.Hi , sis . , I saw you buy some chocolate cakes . I am done with the main course . It's about time for some dessert . 
 No , no , I'm just thinking of some dessert . And I have had enough carrots .

 Thank you . 
 Yes , I think so . I ’ d like to have one medium steak , and a bottle of wine .

 Well , you've been working on this assignment for five hours . 
 What are you doing for Christmas this year ? 
 That's great . M OST of my family is coming home too . 
 My sister.She is going to her in-law's house this year . 
 I asked Santa to bring me a new sweater and some computer games . 
 I hope that I get what I asked for .

 Good morning . Could I speak to Frans Smith please ? 
 Is this Taiwan 8234342 2 , DS engineering ? 
 The accounts department , I think . 
 Mary sings much better than Susan , doesn't she ? 
 Maybe it's because Susan's parents are both painters . 
 If you gotta go , you gotta go . 
 87 cents . 
 It ’ s on sale this week . 
 Here ’ s your change . 
 Ms.Dawson , I need you to take a dictation for me . 
 This should go out as an intra-office memorandum to all employees by this afternoon.Are you ready ? 
 Attention all staff ... Effective immediately , all office communications are restricted to email correspondence and official memos.The use of Instant Message programs by employees during working hours is strictly prohibited . 
 It should apply to all communications , not only in this office between employees , but also any outside communications . 
 They will just have to change their communication methods . I don't want any - one using Instant Messaging in this office.It wastes too much time ! Now , please continue with the memo.Where were we ? 
 Yes.Any employee who persists in using Instant Messaging will first receive a warning and be placed on probation.At second offense , the employee will face termination.Any questions regarding this new policy may be directed to department heads . 
 Yes.Please get this memo typed up and distributed to all employees before 4 pm . 
 Serves you right . 
 Sure , let me take a look ... Personal Information , Education , Experience , Training ... I think you should add another section for language . You speak three languages , so you might as well put that on your resume . 
 Not necessarily . I think people would be impressed by your language abilities . It says something about your level of intellect and experience . Also , I think human resources directors want to see more of a well-rounded person in a resume . 
 Well , you're right , the resume is limited in how much it can tell someone about a person . That's why job interviews are important to let people know the real you that they can't see from a piece of paper . But resumes can be helpful in explaining things and giving a good impression to a potential employer . 
 Oh , is there ? Which room is it ? 
 You mean the room 1818 ? 
 All right madam , I'll check and tell them to be quiet . 
 Well , it's too bad that we like different kinds of movies . Maybe we're just different kinds of people . 
 What's that ? 
 You mean ... like on a second date ? 
 No way ! That sounds great ! 
 Have you ever been to it before ? 
 Let's go . It sounds interesting . 
 No problem . How many are you thinking about ? 
 If you'll just fill out this form , please . 
 We can do that very easily . 
 Great . Your order will take only one week . 
 We can do that . It'll just cost you extra . 
 Yes , it's a way to commemorate a great ancient romantic poet , and the race is a symbol of the attempt to save him . 
 Of course not.He drowned . 
 There are various choices of blood pressure medication that we can try . 
 We could start with Hydrochlorothiazide , which is a diuretic . 
 There really are not many side effects . You need to drink a lot of water when you take this pill . 
 It might be , but for a while I also want you to take an ACE inhibitor , Lisinopril . 
 You may have a little bit of a dry cough , but you will feel much better . 
 What are you going to get ? 
 Well , do you want burgers , Chinese food , or Mexican food ? 
 Where are you going to get it from ? 
 I usually get my Chinese food from Panda Express . 
 The food there is actually pretty good . 
 You should . I know you'll like it . 
 To be honest , Ava , I've just had a really bad day . 
 First , I slept through my alarm and ended up two hours late to work . 
 He told me that if I showed up late one more time , he'd fire me . He's so mean ! 
 That was my second time . The first time , I was in a car accident . 
 No , he's from Australia . Before I met him , I thought Australians were supposed to be relaxed and easy-going . I had no idea he'd be so fussy about things . 
 I think I'm going to look for another job . I need to find a boss that is a bit more sensitive and optimistic than my current boss . 
 That's very generous of you . Thanks for the offer . 
 Did you get Bean's ten different good luck forwards , like that one from the Dalai Lama ? 
 I figured I might as well send one or two of them out . Maybe my luck will get better . 
 It's worth a shot . Maybe we'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case . 
 Miss Levin . Nice to meet you . 
 There has been talk at school about canceling the concert . 
 Just word of mouth . 
 I tried when you had gone , but I had no luck . 
 Okay . 
 What's your trouble ? 
 I got it . 
 We can borrow from a bank , the gross interest rate will be something like 7 % . With corporate tax at say 30 % . We are only paying on 50 % of this . There is still inflation to consider . 
 We can borrow as much as we can . 
 How much loan capital can we safely raise then ? 
 Hello . This is the Holiday Inn . Can I help you ? 
 Yes . There is a 20 % to 40 % discount . It depends on the season.During the summer the discount is 20 % . During the winter it is 40 % . 
 Our summer season ended in September . So the discount will be 40 % . That ’ s a good deal . Would you prefer rooms with a front view or rear view ? 
 What date and time will you be checking in ? 
 We need you to send a deposit for 1/3 of the bill . You can send the check , or you can use the credit card . 
 Could you tell me your name , address and phone number , please ? 
 Thanks . 
 Two nights . 
 I've finished . 
 I am sorry to hear that . Why do you want to quit ? 
 All right . Welcome back anytime . 
 I am glad to work with you , too . Good luck ! 
 May I help you , sir ? 
 Certainly . Here's a mirror . 
 Yes . This one must fit you . 
 I'm afraid not , sir . 
 I am wondering if you have a room with twin bed . 
 That's wonderful . I want to stay for 2 days . 
 Thank you . 
 so do i . I don ’ t like cats . 
 I can ’ t bear being near cats . They don ’ t seem to like me either . 
 I ’ m fond of snakes . I think they ’ re great . I agree with you about spiders though . I think spiders are horrible . I think it ’ s because they have so many legs . 
 I agree . I ’ m carry about mice . I think they ’ re so cute ! 
 How can I travel by air ? 
 No , this is the first time . 
 Yes , I know . 
 Is that all ? 
 What's an ID card ? 
 Can I board the plane now ? 
 Thank you . Now I know how to travel by air . 
 I don't think the exam will be very hard . 
 Maybe you're right . I have been too lazy lately . 
 It's our anniversary today . I am looking for the same flowers as the ones in her wedding bouquet . 
 White . 
 They are short , I guess . About the same height as those short flowers over there . 
 No , they look like little bells . 
 Oh , that's too bad . 
 Ok . How many do you suggest ? 
 Yes , they are . 
 You too . 
 Break it up ! I will not permit fighting in this campus . 
 I'd like to , but I'm not sure if I'll have enough money . 
 Here you go . 
 Cancelled ! So what am I supposed to do now ? 
 What's my other option ? 
 That's fine . I'll do that then . 
 David , do you think which team will get the champion tonight ? 
 I am so nervous now . What a terrific game ! 
 It's hard to say , because each team has my idols . 
 I will never forget this match . The angle is so terrible and so correct . 
 Good morning . Madam . What can I do for you today ? 
 What seems to be the problem ? 
 Oh ? You mean , the ATM machine has eaten it ? 
 You said you received your card this morning , am I right ? 
 Did you receive your PIN number yet , Madam ? You see , unless you have your new PIN number , to match your new card , you cannot use it . We usually send that separately , around one day after the card , for security reasons . 
 Yes , I think there is something wrong with my car . 
 When I tried to back it , I found it was out of order . I can't see where the trouble is . 
 Is it serious ? 
 And when will it be OK ? 
 OK . Thank you . 
 Yes , madam . I graduated from Tianjin College of Finance and Trade three years ago . 
 I took Accounting as my major . 
 I was in charge of cost price and sales revenue . 
 There are two reasons for me to do it . First , I'm sure that there will be more opportunities for advancement If I enter your enterprise . Secondly , I'd like to acquaint myself with American culture if possible . 
 Yes , madam . I know that I'll be expected , first of all , to work hard if I'm hired . 
 I allocate different patients with their consent to different nurses . And I supervise the primary nurses and help nurses carry out their work . 
 To maintain a high standard of nursing , we should take experience and education into consideration while considering a nurse's level of expertise in caring for various patients . 
 It's a great pleasure to meet you , Mr . White . I believe you have seen our exhibits in the showroom . What is it that particularly interests you ? 
 Thank you for your inquiry . Would you tell us what quantity you require so that we can work out the offer ? 
 Here are our FOB price lists . All the prices in the lists are subject to our confirmation . 
 As a rule we don't allow any commission . But if the order is sizable one , we will consider it . 
 We'll discuss this when you place your order with us . 
 My first grandchild . 
 Do you think so ? Well , I guess . He does look a lot like me . Oh , he ’ s got Richard ’ s eyes though . 
 Well , children usually resemble their parents . 
 You often like comparing children with their parents . 
 When did you and Amanda meet each other ? 
 So you met her right after you got to school ? 
 May I have a word with you ? 
 When will you be free ? 
 Shall I say around ten o'clock ? 
 Hello , ma'am . Can I help you ? 
 Sure , ma'am . Here you are . 
 25 yuan . 
 Thank you very much , ma'am , but we don't take tips in China . 
 Why do you say that ? 
 Think a little . I think he means well at the bottom of his heart . 
 Yes , I've been given so much , that I simply don't know what to do with it all . 
 What about these ? 
 I see.Thank you , doctor . 
 I am returning something that I bought yesterday . 
 I'm returning a cellphone . 
 It's defective . 
 It keeps turning off on it's own . 
 I have it right here . 
 Thanks for your help . 
 My name is Liu Wei . I have booked a ticket to Boston three days before . 
 But now I want to make a change . Please cancel this flight and transfer me to flight GB105 . 
 Yes . 
 I'm going to a disco with my friends . 
 Didn't Joe feel it a shame to live on his parents since he has graduated from college ? 
 If I were him , I wouldn't brazen it out by asking my parents for money . 
 David , would you like something to eat ? 
 Do you want something to drink ? 
 Sorry , I don't have any coffee . 
 A small glass , or a big one ? 
 Here you are . 
 You're welcome . 
 But they are closed today . 
 Have you already forgotten ? What's the date today ? 
 You forgot all about it , didn't you ? 
 What's that ? 
 Better not forget that , so kill you if you don't get her something . 
 I'm on a diet . So I have to avoid food containing too much fat . Do you have vegetarian dishes ?

 No . It isn't . 
 But I can't move the cursor at all . My screen is frozen . What should I do ? 
 Yes , but nothing's happened . 
 I've never done that before . Will I lose all my files ? 
 Can you pass me the lighter ? 
 Can I be of any help ? 
 Yes , of course . How about this one ? It's a new route . 
 First class , sir . 
 I'm from Canada . 
 I would like to be in a managerial role , ideally working do6ely with external clients . I have worked in client-facing roles for more than two years and I enjoy the challenge of keeping the customer satisfied . I think Ifs something I ’ m good at . Finally , I ’ d like to be on the right career path towards eventually becoming a senior manger within the company . I ’ m very aware that these are ambitious goals , however I fell through hard work and dedication they achievable .

 Have you ever witnessed any crimes or accidents ? 
 I was taking a walk in the park early this morning when suddenly I heard someone calling " help " . I rushed over and saw a man beating a woman . 
 I guess I was stunned for a moment , then I quickly ran away to get help . 
 Yes . Fortunately , I had my cell with me this morning . I called the police as I was running to get people to come to help .

 No , I don't know where that is . 
 I think I can find it . 
 Thank you for letting me add your class . 
 Let's start to study how to use computers , Paler . It's good to know that a computer has two major parts , the hardware and the software . 
 The hardware of computer is basically all the concrete things you can touch with your hands and see with your eyes . 
 The software of computer is all the programmes inside the computer that allow you to use the computer to do things . 
 Right you are , Paler , and since what you want to learn is how to use software , we should also learn to refer to the computer menus . 
 Good morning golf aficionados ! My name is Rick Fields , and you guessed it , I am here with my main man , Bob Copeland . 
 Whoa , that ’ s a lot of cash ! Let ’ s go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing . 
 Tiger Woods is about to tee off , and let ’ s see if he has the same luck as Jack . Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and , he seems to be very nervous . 
 It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees . He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it . 
 Hi , Mikel . What's with you ? You look angry . 
 True , you are getting a really pot belly , aren't you ? 
 Just kidding , Mikel . Why don't you come work out with me ? 
 It works if you keep at it . Come on , let's go ! 
 This feels great . I'm all reed up . I can keep going all night . 
 Exercise has no benefit unless you sweat like a pig . 
 Thanks for coming , it was a real blessed . 
 You'll get used to it , Mikel , trust me . 
 He's awful ! He telephoned me four times yesterday , and three times the day before yesterday . He telephoned the office yesterday morning and yesterday afternoon . My boss answered the telephone . 
 He said , Pauline is typing letters . She can't speak to you now ! " Then I arrived home at six o'clock yesterday evening . He telephoned again . But I didn ’ t answer the phone ! 
 Yes , he did . He telephoned at nine o'clock . 
 I said , This is Pauline's mother . Please don ’ t telephone my daughter again ! 
 No , he didn't ! 
 Aren't you the pot calling the kettle black ? You're wearing my pants right now ! 
 No , that's not true.The White House is very big . And there are a lot of historical exhibits there.The tour will take us through many different rooms . I read about it in the guide . 
 I'm sure the security is very tight.Probably they will make us walk through metal detectors like at the airport . 
 Don't always joke like that ! You don't have a gun . 
 You shouldn't say things like that . You could get arrested ! 
 No . But if you say something like that in the White House , they may take it seriously . Sometimes I think you joke too much . 
 I'm not sure . I think it lasts about one hour . 
 First I want to look in the travel guide.Maybe they don't have tours in the morning . 
 No , I'm fine . 
 Where you can buy lots of paraphernalia ? 
 Cool ! 
 So , you're going to use Sarah's car to go cruising for chicks ? 
 Hey , John . Nice car . 
 What is this , the new Ford ? 
 True . How much did you pay ? 
 Does that mean you ’ re not going to take the train to work anymore ? 
 Yeah , sure . 
 Sit down , please . What's wrong with you ? 
 How long have you been like that ? 
 Let me have a look at your throat first . Please open your mouth and say " ah " . 
 And show me your tongue ... Thank you . That'll do . You have slight tonsillitis , and your throat is inflamed . How is your appetite ? 
 Now , let me take your temperature . Please put this thermometer under your armpit and let me feel your pulse ? 
 Do I have a temperature , doctor ? 
 do you mind if I sit here ? 
 don't I know you ? 
 you're right ! How are you ? It's been a long time ! 
 I went straight to university afterwards . What about you ? 
 that sounds exciting . Where did you go ? 
 I went to a small school in Connecticut . It has a very good reputation for its languages department . 
 yes , I got a grant to study Chinese . 
 it is , but it's very rewarding . 
 I can , but not as well as I'd like to . I'll be studying Chinese until the day I die ! 
 My Chinese friends told me that the Spring Festival is coming soon . Can you tell me something about it ? 
 What happens on the holiday ? 
 Do people cook a lot of special dishes for the holiday ? 
 What good sunshine ! Let's go and get a suntan on the balcony . 
 It's different in my case . I work in the office , so only rarely do I get the chance to get any sun . 
 Hello . This is the Directory Assistance . Can I help you ? 
 I ’ m sorry . There is no listing under that name . Are you sure of the name ? 
 Do you have her address ? 
 That ’ s an unlisted number . I ’ m sorry , but I can ’ t give it to you . 
 No problem . 
 Well , I'm trying to buy some foreign currency for my holiday . 
 We are going to Macau to visit my niece . She said it's better for me to bring US dollars , is that right ? 
 OK , I see . What's the exchange rate ? Is the dollar up or down ? 
 To be honest , I have no idea about these things ! But I'm sure that's alright .

It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo . The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today . Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles . 
 No , the Chinese company has that all worked out . With the paperwork you receive with the shipment , you should be good to go . 
 Right . You're right . But she's just evil . Someone should drive a stake through her heart . 
 I'm OK . I'll be fine . I'v cool . I'm cold . I'm like ice . She won't know what hit her .

 OK . I'll try a Pinto . I want to rent a car for one week . 
 Here you are . 
 Sure , what ’ s up ? 
 I don ’ t know anything about it . Soccer isn ’ t as popular in my country as it is here . 
 Is it anything like American football ? 
 I ’ ll come down and watch you play some day , and see what it ’ s like . 
 I am dropping off my prescription to get it filled . 
 If I couldn ’ t wait , could the prescription be mailed to me ? 
 When should I take this medication ? 
 Should I take this medicine on an empty stomach ? 
 What are the side effects of this medication ? 
 You will never guess where my family is going for summer vacation . 
 How in the world did you guess that ? Did someone tell you already ? 
 I want to ride a camel and definitely see the pyramids ! 
 It helps that my dad is an archaeologist . 
 Who's that striking woman over there ? 
 Really ? Why not ? She looks great . 
 Really ? Tell me more . 
 Wow , crikey . So what happened ? 
 Wow . 
 I have no idea what you're talking about . 
 Could you excuse me a moment ? I have to make a phone call 
 I plan to emigrate to Canada . 
 No . But it is said the welfare in Canada is very good . 
 Maybe you are right , so I will try my best to find a suitable job . 
 Good morning , Mr . Thomas , it is nice to see you too . 
 I ’ Ve worked in the field for more than 4 years . Depend on my work qualifications and experience , I would like to have 5000 Yuan to start . 
 It is a bit lower than I expected . But I can accept that . What are the working hours ? 
 Do I have to work on weekend ? If so , how do you pay for the overtime ? 
 Is there probation ? 
 Hello , Tom ! 
 How are you doing ? 
 I'm just a little tired . 
 I have a lot of work to do in the company recently . 
 Pretty fine , thanks . 
 I am going to buy a new air conditioner for my parents . Oh , it ’ s two o ’ clock . I must go now . 
 See you . 
 My car won ’ t start ! Stupid old car ! 
 Fine . 
 Yeah ! I am here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor . 
 Yeah , it sounds like it usually does when I start the car , but nothing else happens . The engine won ’ t start . Should I maybe press the accelerator ? 
 So what do you think it is ? 
 Umm . yeah ! Right ! I got the car started ! Thanks for your help ! I told you to fill the tank ! 
 The next bus will be here in four minutes . 
 No , it's the number fifty-eight . 
 No , it won't . 
 Never . 
 That's right.The number forty-four doesn't stop here any more.It ' s stop is round the corner . 
 I wouldn't count on it . 
 Yes , but I'll bet she won't again . 
 Open the door . It's me . I can't find the key . 
 Oh , thank you . I am exhausted . Will you bring me a cup of tea ? 
 So let's eat out . 
 Noodles . How about you ? 
 Mr . Dick . Does the recommendation of the university play an important role ? 
 But I find that most of the recommendation letters written by universities are the same . So I doubt its authority . 
 Could you tell me whether or not I send out my resume with it ? 
 What do you say to eating out , Maggie ? 
 Do we need to book a table in advance ? 
 What time shall we go ? 
 Hello , Miss , what can I do for you this afternoon ? 
 Yes , it is , busy today . We usually have a lot more clients on the weekend . Would you like to take a sit , and wait for a while , please ? 
 It should be around that , if you like , please for a free to read the magazine while you are wait . 
 Sorry to keep you waiting , Miss . I'll have a dresser Mr.Li is just finish with a client in a moment or two . Would you have a shampoo first ? I'll get it on for you . 
 Good evening , ma'am . Table for one ? 
 Will this table be all right ? 
 Certainly . How about this one ? 
 ( Handing her a menu ) Your waiter will be here in a minute to take your order . 
 Tom , aren ’ t you a little too old to be trick-or - treating ? 
 Of course , I did , but when I was ten ! Trick - or-treating is for kids , plus , I ’ m sure people will think you ’ re a kidnapper or something , running around with kids NCP at night . 
 I've got a complaint about the noise next door . 
 Some people aren't very considerate . 
 Yes , I think so . 
 We'll play the CD loud , is that all right ? 
 What should we do ? 
 Good idea . 
 I hope so . I'm not actually a customer here , but I saw an advertisement in yesterday's newspaper about your new bank card . 
 Yes , please . But I suppose I'll have to open an account with you first , right ? 
 Could I open an account with you today ? 
 Yes , here you go . And sign here ? 
 So quick and easy ! Thanks very much . 
 Why are you trying to rush me off the phone ? 
 Why ? I still wanted to talk to you . 
 Like what ? 
 I'm not . I just want to know . 
 That's harsh . 
 Fine . 
 I'm sorry for hero . I dont think there's any excuse for his acting in some parts . 
 Good morning , sir . Can I help you ? 
 Certainly . How much rent did you want to pay ? 
 $ 900 a month ? We don ’ t often have apartment as inexpensive as that . We have one apartment for $ 985 a month today , on Eleventh Avenue . It ’ s near the municipal buildings . 
 No , it ’ s unfurnished . It has a kitchen , but there are not many cookers . There ’ s a garden in the back , but the tenants can ’ t use it . The landlord lives downstairs . Friends are forbidden in the apartment after midnight . No noise and no television after 11 ... 
 Ok , we would do as your requirement . And we ’ ll contact with you later ! 
 Don't bother . those are a dime a dozen where we are going . 
 Good morning . Could I speak to someone in the sales department , please ? 
 Thanks . 
 Let me look . What do you need ? 
 I think dimes and quarters will do . 
 Fine . How many people are there in your party ? 
 $ 200 for double . 
 I am afraid not . Right now it's the tour season . 
 I am sorry , sir , it's not allowed . 
 Of course . You can get it at the entrance . 
 Excuse me . I'd like to cash the traveler's check . 
 In tens and fifties , please . 
 OK , thank you . 
 Really ? I thought the exhibition showed that he had real talent . What did you think of it ? 
 I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever read a good review of an exhibition by that critic . He doesn ’ t seem to like anything . Which kinds of paintings do you prefer ? 
 Yes , I do . I like painters who use rather than watercolors . The colors appear richer . What do you think ? 
 Yes . Good artwork is very expensive nowadays . When I was in china , I bought some calligraphy by famous artists . You should come and see it sometime . 
 I know what the characters on the paintings mean . I think Chinese characters look very artistic . It ’ s said that the way they are written can give insight into the artist ’ s character . 
 Could I speak to the apartment manager ? 
 I wanted to know if that apartment on Main Street is still for rent . 
 Yes , I want to see it . 
 That time is okay with me . 
 No , thank you . I go by there on my way to work . 
 That's a good idea . Do I need to bring anything myself ? 
 You'll soon graduate from your university . Do you have any plans for the future ? 
 Do you have a clear career path to follow ? 
 what kind of job do you want after graduation ? 
 wait ! You can't do so many things at the same time . What exactly do you want ? 
 yeah , you should first decide what kind of career you really want , plan your career path , and then try your best to achieve your goal . 
 no , you can't waste your time wandering around . If you want a job that requires a higher degree or diploma , you should focus on your graduate school entrance exam ; if you want a job that needs working 
 We ’ Ve been over this a thousand times . The data is irrefutable ! Look , we ’ Ve done extensive research , built studies , and read the literature , and there is conclusive evidence to support my theory ! 
 That is preposterous ! 
 I am not wrong ! The chicken came first ! 
 Listen , Christine , you can not afford another day off . You ’ Ve called in sick five times in the last three weeks . 
 Well , I want a note from the doctor on this one . And , to be honest , if this continues , we may not be able to employ you here . 
 Do you speak English ? 
 Can you tell me how to get to the Jade Buddha Temple ? 
 Good coming . room service.What can I do for you ? 
 OK.sir . We will bring it to you as soon as possible . 
 My watch always gains ten minutes a day . 
 No kidding . 
 You know what you can do ? 
 No , you don't have to . You only need to put your watch back ten minutes every day . 
 Yes , that's what I am doing . 
 Hi , Lucy . What are you going to do this weekend ? 
 Would you like to play tennis with me ? 
 Be sure to get to the sports hall at nine o'clock on Sunday morning . 
 Hello ? 
 Sorry , I think you have the wrong number . 
 Yes . Who are you looking for again ? 
 Oh , I thought you said Laura . Sorry about that . This is the right number , but Heather's not here right now . 
 She went to the store to buy some groceries . Would you like to leave a message ? 
 Hi Eric , this is her roommate Kathy . I met you a couple months ago at the Christmas party . 
 Good . Heather will be back in about 20 minutes . I'll tell her you called . 
 Bye bye . 
 I used to work as a mechanic and I was responsible for the maintenance of all the company vehicles . 
 I worked in Hanson Paper Company . 
 Because the company is far away from home , and I have to study after work so I can't afford to waste time on the road everyday . 
 What for ? 
 It is really a hot potato . 
 It ’ s hard to say . Language isn ’ t like other studies . 
 I ’ m not kidding . Learning a language is a question of forming language habits and that takes time . 
 No . You just have to stay here long enough to get some orientation . Then you go on practicing and learning outside . A lot of learning depends on your personal motivation . 
 You said it . 
 Do you have any other symptoms ? 
 Just a little . Has your toothache gone now ? 
 How about your tongue ? Does it still hurt ? 
 How did you get that burn again ? 
 You haven't had much luck lately , have you ? 
 When's the last time you took your tablets ? 
 I think it's time you took another dose of each . What would you like to drink with them ? 
 Sure , I'll just go and get it now . what would you like to eat ? Some soup ? 
 soup always makes me feel better when I'm sick . I hope it makes you feel better , too . 
 Your doctor wants to test your urine and needs a sample . 
 We need you to urinate like you normally would , and then stop and finish into the cup . 
 Leave the cup in the cubby in the restroom . Just close the cubby door and walk away . 
 He wants to know if you have bacteria in your urine , which could signal an infection . 
 We will send your doctor the results , and he will contact you . 
 I enjoyed talking to you too . 
 I think that would be nice . 
 Do you want to go out to eat ? 
 So I'll see you next time . 
 I'll talk to you later . 
 Goodbye . 
 I ’ m sorry , Clint . Maybe I didn ’ t make myself clear enough . We should get together to discuss this . 
 Fine . Let ’ s meet this afternoon . I ’ ll draw you a better picture of the situation . 
 No , what ? 
 Oh , no . What kind of trouble ? 
 Mary , today a man from an intermediary gave me a call . 
 He said he saw my job-seeking information on the Internet , and could offer me an appropriate job . 
 It's a recruiting agency which specializes in introducing talented people to companies and businesses . 
 It's on telemarketing . 
 No , he said the employers will pay for it . 
 I feel it is OK and I want to give it a try . 
 Of course , I will . 
 Is there anything I can dor you ? 
 Why not go the youth restaurant ? You will have a happy lunch there . 
 I feel like going for a drink , it's been a long day . 
 How about the new bar across road ? 
 I agree , I had lunch there last week . 
 I was surprised to see how few people you have on-site . You provide a wide range of goods and services but have a very small workforce . 
 Do you handle the recruiting yourselves ? 
 It's raining outside , Catherine , it's too bad.What ' s the weather like in your hometown ? 
 Do you like the weather in Seattle ? 
 Why ? 
 What about the weather in Boston ? 
 Is it very cold in winter ? 
 Sometimes you look like brains , and sometimes you are simple a Barbie Doll . 
 Maybe I am a Barbie Doll , but I won ’ t do Barbie Doll things . 
 What do you know about our company ? 
 Very good . If you enter this company , what department would you like to work in ? 
 OK . Oh , how much do you make at your current job , if you don ’ t mind my asking ? 
 Well , the starting salary for a clerk in our company is 2,500 yuan monthly and after three months he would get a raise if his work is satisfactory . 
 Sure , we provide semi-annual bonus , a small bonus at Spring Festival , four weeks paid vacation a year . 
 We can buy that for you . 
 are you ready for the meeting ? 
 it's challenging , but I'm enjoying it quite a bit . 
 thanks a lot . 
 well , that's part of the problem . His probation period is up tomorrow and I don't think he's ready to pass . 
 well , he was supposed to be able to learn his job in 30 days , but he just doesn't seem to know what he's doing . 
 to be honest , he has no authority . He's a hard-worker , but no one listens to him . 
 I know . It'd be great if we could transfer him to a department where he doesn't have to work with people . 
 that's perfect . I'll let him know tomorrow . Thanks ! 
 Just fill out this form , will you ? 
 How would you like it ? 
 Here you are . Thank you . 
 I see . What is your baggage ? And do not remember the tag's number or color ? 
 Could you give me a description of your case ? 
 I'll check it for you ... sorry to keep you waiting . I've found it.Is this yours ? 
 Will you show me your key card , please ? 
 All right . Now you can take your case away . 
 Yes , I ’ m enquiring about your advertisement for a sales manager in today ’ s newspaper . Is this position still open ? 
 Yes , I have a lot of previous experiences in sales . I worked in sales departments for two companies since I finished my university . 
 Yes , my name is Brian and my phone number is 5294870 . 
 It's crunch time , isn't it ? I wasn't nervous before the meeting , but now I am . 
 It would help to bring in a couple more troubleshooters . 
 Do you think we'll make it ? 
 Hi , what can I get for you ? 
 With everything on it ? 
 Did you want fries with your order ? 
 Did you want something to drink ? 
 Would you like anything else ? 
 No problem , that'll be $ 5.48 . 
 Can you pick up some things from the store for me ? 
 I need a few things , I'll give you the list . 
 Everything I need is on the list . 
 Since you asked , would you pick up my medicine from the pharmacy ? 
 I believe so . 
 I really appreciate you doing this for me . 
 I find Beijing Opera is quite a bore . 
 It's just like listening to a language which you know nothing at all . 
 Good evening . 
 Let me see . Yes , we have one room left . You're lucky . It's the last one . 
 This room has two double beds . It's number 56 at the rear of the motel . It's quite a comfortable room . 
 It's forty-five dollars a night for two . Is anyone else traveling with you ? 
 Would you like to pay for the room in cash or with a credit card ? 
 Please fill out this registration card . Here is your key . You can park your car in front of our room.Check - out time is noon . 
 Thank you , sir . Enjoy your stay with us . 
 Sure . What do you want to know ? 
 Well , you have to get 166 credits , including required courses and optional courses . 
 It can be completed in four years normally . 
 You're welcome . 
 Yes.Let ' s hold a birthday party for him , shall we ? 
 We'd like to have a look around your house ? 
 Thank you . 
 It's so spacious , about 40 square metres , right ? 
 Are these corn ears hanging on the tree branch ? 
 Very beautiful and very interesting . But why do you hang them in the tree ? 
 Very good idea . Sometimes such pictures can show the house's richness . 
 What ? I gave it to you only 3 months ago . 
 Ok , son . I think I ’ Ve go to tell you the truth . My company has gone out and I ’ m now out of job . If you want a new camera , go and earn money yourself . 
 If I remember correctly , there's a quiz show . 
 Let's see what else is on first . 
 Yes , we do . The most popular vegetables are potatoes , carrots , peas , and cauliflower . The most popular fruit are apples , bananas , pears , peaches , grapes , and oranges . Do you like vegetables ? 
 Which kinds of vegetables do people in your country usually eat ? 
 I love eggplant ! Unfortunately , it ’ s quite expensive in my country , so I don ’ t eat it often . 
 Because we don ’ t grow it much in my country . We import a lot from other countries . 
 We eat it in my country too , but I wouldn't say it ’ s very popular . Most people buy frozen sweet corn from their local supermarket . 
 A lot of younger people like to buy large packets of mixed frozen vegetables . Peas and sweet corn have been sold frozen in my country for many years . I prefer to buy fresh vegetables . 
 $ 200 , please . 
 I'm afraid you can't , ma'am . We accept only traveler's checks and credit cards . 
 We can take it . Just a moment ... Please sign here . 
 Yes , here you are . These tablets are very effective . 
 Take two tablets every six hours . 
 And take a good rest for a few days . 
 Do you have a family tradition at Christmas time ? 
 What is it ? 
 That's it ? That's the tradition ? 
 I guess the spirit of it is what really makes any tradition fun . 
 Well , I ’ Ve looked over your resume , Mr . Peepers . 
 Well , Ted , this is a very impressive resume . However , we do have several other applicants to finish interviewing before we can make a final decision . We ’ ll call you by Friday , if that ’ s all right . 
 Do you have any other questions ? 
 Salary is based on experience as well as time spent with our company . 
 Salary can be negotiated once we officially offer you the job . 
 Anything else ? 
 Our employees receive fifteen days of paid vacation every year . If you don ’ t use the full fifteen days , they carry over to the following year . 
 You get five paid sick days . 
 Yes , we have an excellent retirement plan and medical insurance as well . 
 We ’ ll contact you soon , Ted . Thanks for coming in . 
 Well , I have been in the computer engineering field for 6 years now . I am familiar with both hardware and software and with hands-on experience in system development including system analysis and design . 
 I have worked on about every system that is out right now . 
 I am not as familiar with it as I am with some of the older systems . But I am a fast learner and I can master it in a short time . 
 I am knowledgeable and levelheaded . 
 Yes . My name is Charles . 
 It's very kind of you . 
 Bring me the menu , please . 
 Yes , I would like to book a room for my wife and myself . 
 We will be arriving on Tuesday next week and staying for two days . 
 Yes , that would be great . How much is the room ? 
 Does the bathroom have a bath or a shower ? 
 Does the room have an Internet connection ? 
 Excellent . Do you serve breakfast in the hotel ? 
 That's great . Can I book the room ? 
 The client you're meeting tomorrow likes to ask a lot of questions , so you have to be well prepared . 
 Can I ask a favor of you ? 
 Would you mail this letter for me when you go to the post office ? 
 I made a reservation earlier this week , but I have to cancel it . 
 Great ! I'm Rudy Randolph , 818-555-1234 , and my reservation was for April 9 to 15 . 
 That was nice and fast . Thanks . 
 Look , Mary ! There are so many people over there ! 
 I have never been to the personnel market . 
 Are there many employers ? 
 So there will be many large companies in the personnel market , right ? 
 When will there be a job fair ? 
 Do I need to pay to go into the personnel market ? 
 How about going there to have a look now ? 
 Hello , can I help you ? 
 What color and what style do you like ? 
 Well , you can have a look at our skirts hanging there . 
 You are welcome ! 
 Yes , I'd like to reserve a table for dinner . 
 Six couples . 
 That sounds like a good idea . 
 My name is Ron Kollwitz . 
 What's the weather going to be like ? I may want to go too . 
 Will it be good beach weather ? 
 It wouldn't be good if it got cold this weekend . 
 This California weather is so uncertain , it's impossible to know what'll happen . 
 I would love it if it wasn't always so unpredictable . 
 I know . Things are easier when you know what the weather's going to be like . 
 Didn't you hear about that ? Our meeting was proponed until Friday . 
 Didn't you get the memo ? 
 The memo went out three days ago . It should have made it to your in-box , but maybe it got lost in all the clutter on your desk . 
 It should have gone around to everybody . They also posted a copy of the memo in the break-room . Don't you ever look at the messages posted on the bulletin board ? 
 That's right . You never know what you're missing out if you don't read the memos . 
 Do you want small bills or large ? 
 Do you want anything else ? 
 Watch out , Patrick ! 
 I like chess better than xiangqi . And you ? 
 I think chess is more reasonable . You see , each side has eight pawns , a larger number than that of the soldiers in xiangqi . A true battle should be like that . Soldiers should outnumber the commanders . 
 Correct ! Another contrast is the rules for the general and the king . It seems the general or marshal in xiangqi is much too incompetent . They are required to stay in the palace , waiting to be checked and fleeing for life under the cover of the guards . Look at the king in chess , he is much more capable . 
 There's another distinctive contrast . Both board games use a total of 32 pieces , but xiangqi is played on a 9 - by - 9 board , bigger than the 8 - by - 8 board used in chess . 
 Sure . On a chessboard , fire is much more intensive . It has a smaller board , while those bigger pieces-chariots , horses and bishops-can cover longer distances . 
 What kind of style do you want ? 
 Now let me take your measurements . 
 Three days later . 
 Bye-bye . 
 This is room 504.The room is so cold . 
 Yes.of course . I turned it on half an hour ago . I don't think it work at all . 
 I think I'm going to go to the market today . 
 Yeah , I think so . 
 I'm not sure what we need . 
 Could you do it for me , and write out a list of things that we need ? 
 Like what ? 
 Just go and make a list for me , please . 
 The question is easy for everybody.Don ' t you think so ? 
 Why do you say so ? 
 Let's invite Bobbie and John to our party , OK ? 
 Why ? 
 Welcome back racing fans ! My name is Rick Fields and , as always , I am joined by my partner in crime , Bob Copeland . 
 He came in too fast , jammed on the breaks and spun out . We have a yellow flag and the pace car is making its way onto the track . 
 Smoke is coming out of his car ! He seems to be having engine trouble ! He makes his way into the pit , and Fernando Alonso takes the lead ! 
 What day is today ? 
 What's the date today ? 
 Oh , today's International Labour Day . Is it our working day ? 
 Hello . This is the front desk . What can I do for you ? 
 Sure . Anything else ? 
 Go ahead , please . 
 We ’ ll send someone right up . But don ’ t worry about that . Maybe the service person forgot to do it . 
 Did you go and buy your bus pass ? 
 When are you going to go get it ? 
 Why didn't you just ask me ? 
 You can get one from student services . 
 I already knew that . 
 You're welcome . 
 Hey , Jeff , where's your stereo ? 
 You must have been really hurting for cash to have done that . 
 It sounds like you weren't expecting that . 
 Well , if you need some money to tide you over until payday , I can loan you some . 
 Excuse me . My name is Dan Ford . I have an appointment with the dentist at 3:30 . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , we do . We like it very much . 
 Thank you so much . 
 I need you to tell me what the problem is . 
 Is the kitchen plumbing messed up also , or just the bathroom plumbing ? 
 Did this just start happening , or has it been going on for a while ? 
 Are you going to be home so I can come by and take a look at the problem ? 
 I will be coming by around 10 this morning . If you aren ’ t there , I ’ ll just use my key . 
 I'm feeling very sad . I just read the newspaper . 
 According to the newspaper , the town was razed by an earthquake and more than 10 thousand people died in the earthquake . 
 Yeah , we have to do something to help the people in the stricken area . 
 It's a good idea . But where can we donate money ? 
 Yes , let's do it now . 
 You don't know what you are asking ! 
 Remember what happened last time ? 
 Yes . That was a bit terrifying for both of us . 
 Oh , in that case , sure ! Uh ... what are these long sock-looking things ? 
 We go way back.We ' Ve known each other since we were toddlers . 
 Yeah , We're buddy-buddy still . 
 Well , he is , but he can be conniving at times . 
 Well , I know that he would never stab me in the back.But I've seen him double cross other people . 
 Don't get me wrong , I'm not saying he's like that all the time . 
 Well , I think you should decide for yourself . 
 Okay , Okay.You can trust him . I was just trying to give you a hard time . 
 Actually , he's the most dependable person I know , and he would never turn on anyone . 
 I'm an apprentice with a local engineering firm . My training lasts for two years . Two days a week I study Engineering at a local college . If I pass all my exams , I hope the company will take me on as an engineer . 
 These are your products ? 
 May I have your name card ? I am always concerned about the newest computer . 
 Thank you . 
 OK ! Would you like to recommend some for our reference ? 
 Let me take care of the check today . 
 You paid the last time , because I didn't have any money , remember ? 
 But you really should let me treat one time , I feel like I own you one if I didn't . 
 What's the damage ? 
 Check , please . 
 No problem . Would you like some artificial carnations ? 
 How much did you want to spend ? 
 Our most elegant flower is Golden Lily . 
 Do you want to add some baby ’ s breath for that ? They are equally popular now . 
 Yes , but there is a five dollars delivery charge . 
 I am fed up the ready-made suit . Can you recommend me some stuff for me to make one ? 
 It feels good . 
 Yes.Thank you very much . 
 Oh , is it ? 
 Yes , certainly.You have the receipt ? 
 Then would you kindly come to our shop with the receipt by 10 o'clock ? We will replace it . 
 What are our areas for growth ? What sectors do you see the most potential in ? If we are going to pull our sales numbers up and develop the brand , we got to work across the board . 
 I don't see why we can't work on opening new markets and developing the markets we've already penetrated at the same time ... Both aspects of developing our customer base and developing our brand are important . 
 I haven't shopped there . How is the food ? 
 I go to Sons for my groceries . 
 Is there something wrong with Sons ? 
 Do they offer organic foods at Whole Foods ? 
 Maybe I'll try that store out . 
 You're making me a believer . 
 I thought it would be a good idea to get a check-up . 
 I know . I figure as long as there ’ s nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ? 
 O . K . 
 Yes . 
 I ’ Ve tried a hundred times , but I just can ’ t seem to kick the habit . 
 O . K . , thanks , doctor . 
 Is it urgent ? Would you like the express service ? 
 Hi ! May I help you ? 
 In fact , in the past we only attended local exhibitions . 
 Here is our brochure . It'll help you get acquainted with our products and company . 
 Hello ! This is Air China Booking Office . 
 May I know your flight number , please ? 
 Oh , yes . That's our regular flight to Nanchang . Would you please tell me your name ? 
 Yes , here you are . You're flying in economy class . Is that right ? 
 Let me check . Now , your ticket is in order . Thank you for calling to reconfirm . 
 Quite right . If you don't confirm , the reservation will be cancelled 72 hours before the departure time . In order not to miss your flight , I think you should pick up your ticket as early as possible . 
 Well , your qualifications for the job are excellent . And is there anything you'd like to ask about the job ? 
 Yes , our employees are allowed to take up 2 days a month to attend college courses . 
 I've enjoyed the conversation with you . We'll call you within 5 working days . 
 Excuse me.Have you got any books on genetic engineering ? I've looked for them everywhere , but I can't find any . 
 What a pity ! I should have come earlier . 
 Ok , I will . 
 What's up ? Honey ! 
 Honey , it doesn't matter . The key to play volleyball is to cooperate with each other . 
 You go figure it out yourself . 
 OK , Ben and May , here we go . Be careful , Danny , the ball is coming . That is the green one . 
 Danny , back to your position . Move ! 
 Would you mind if I ask your health status ? 
 That is good . We hope each of our future employees will be healthy and happy . 
 Francis , what ’ s that ? 
 Could you tell me something about it ? 
 How many departments do we have ? 
 Ok . Who should I report to ? 
 Could you tell me your education background ? 
 Where did you go to university ? 
 What degree did you get ? 
 What was your major ? 
 What was you G . P . A ? 
 Do you plan to pursue further education ? 
 When do you think you will do that ? 
 I see . 
 I'd like to book a room , please . 
 Four nights , from October 15th . 
 A single room with a bath , if possible . 
 I'll take a front one.My name is John Brown . J-O-H-N B-R-O-W-N . 
 No , don't try to tempt me . I'm becoming chubby , and I have to slender down . 
 I don't think so . I know I've put on weight this winter . 
 Yes , to tell you the truth . I am on the diet . 
 No , ma'am , there's only one person ahead of you . You won't have to wait long . 
 All right , madam , it's your turn . What will it be today ? 
 Come here , please . We'd like to wash your hair first . That way it will be easier to cut and style . I think you'll like this style . It's very fashionable . 
 Would you like me to blow-dry your hair ? 
 What do you think of it ? 
 Not at all . When you wash it , it will fall into place naturally . You'll probably need another cut in about a month . Shall I make an appointment for you ? 
 Do you mind if I smoke here ? 
 Can I just turn off the AC for now and open the window and smoke indoors ? 
 It ’ s very hot and that ’ s why I ’ d like to smoke inside . 
 Oh , no problem . 
 Sure . 
 Any time is all right , except Sunday . 
 OK . I'll tell her . 
 Where are we ? Oh , here we are . So we drive to the A120 and turn left . 
 Oh yes ! Sorry ! Then we drive to the M11 motorway . 
 It ’ s only seven miles . We turn left to join the motorway and drive south . 
 That ’ s another 15 miles , so that ’ s 22 miles total so far . 
 Then we drive on the M25 . it turns south . When we reach exit 15 , we turn left and go west along the M4 . 
 The journey around the M25 is 33 miles and then 3 extra miles to get to the airport . So how many miles is that together ? 
 It shouldn ’ t take us very long to cover that distance . Remember that we can go quite fast on the motor way . 
 How far is this address from here , please ? 
 So how long does it take ? 
 hi , how are you doing ? 
 same here . Have you seen any new films recently ? 
 oh , really ? I saw it two years ago . It's worth seeing and it's thought-provoking . 
 it reflects some of our difficulties in this ever-changing world . 
 well , it's said that a lot of young people favor getting married quickly which tend end quickly too . 
 oh , that's too short-lived . 
 I can't agree more . The only-child generation in China tends to know little about marriage . 
 in their mind , love is nothing but passion and marriage is over once the passion is gone . 
 Foreign Currency Deposits Counter , yes . What can I do for you ? 
 OK . We offer 2 types of saving systems , Time Savings and Demand Savings . With Time Savings your money cannot be withdrawn for a certain period of time , but with Demand Savings your money is ' on demand ' , you can withdraw at any time . 
 There's quite a large difference . I mean , if you were to use demand deposit we could give you 0.13 % interest , but for a time deposit , of say , 1 year we would offer 0.82 % . 
 Hi . Can I help you ? 
 Okay . Please let me know if you need any help . 
 Here is the song list . 
 Yes , here you are . 
 Let me play it for you . 
 It's very easy . Here it is . Ready ? Excellent ! You are a good singer . You sing the bass so well . 
 I'll sing a Chinese folk song Love song of Hanging , first in Chinese then in English . 
 What do you think of the play showed last night ? 
 Yes , I turned it off when the fight got heated in it . 
 I have a package to post today . 
 Well , it has a cassette record ... a cassette tape . 
 By airmail please . 
 Yes , I'd like to insure it for 20 dollars . How much shall I pay altogether ? 
 How do you like it ? 
 Sure . We can deliver it to your home . 
 Of course . You have to fill out the form first . 
 I want haircut and perm . 
 Just cut a little off . 
 I'd like to have medium . 
 Can you tell me my choices ? 
 I want the chocolate one . I want to have it the big waves . 
 Turn the chair I can see myself in the mirror . 
 Beautifully done , many thanks . 
 Yes , of course . I can't wait to be there . 
 I think so . I won't forget anything important . As long as I have my passport , VISA card and airline ticket . It will be OK . 
 More than 100 times . The flight takes off at 12:00 . 
 I think we'll need more time than the schedule gives us . 
 How have you been ? 
 Excuse me , could you tell me whether there is a restaurant near here ? 
 I'm afraid there must be a lot of people there . 
 But we don't know the telephone number . 
 You are so kind ! Thank you very much . 
 May I have a look at that vase , please ? 
 Oh , it's really nice , but to tell the truth , that's far too expensive . 
 Aren ’ t you interested in watching the Olympics ? There have been some excellent performances by athletes from all over the world . 
 I think it ’ s wonderful to see people from all over the world taking part in such a great event . 
 I think the Olympics help to promote world peace . 
 You are so pessimistic ! The Olympics is a great opportunity for athletes to demonstrate their speed , skill , agility and strength . Most people hope to see someone from their country win , but I think that they are just happy to see good performances by any athlete . 
 Now there we are in agreement ! 
 No , I'm not . 
 That ’ s all right . 
 Hello , I'm here to talk to someone about a Fixed Asset Loan . 
 Yes . I also have a Loan Certificate . 
 Well , we have no problems with our credit rating , I can assure you . 
 Are you on a tourist visa or a student visa ? 
 What is the reason for extension ? 
 We ’ ll need a letter from your university and a financial statement from you . 
 Well , Let's get down to business ( shall we ? ) Now is probably a good time to start our discussion , the main purpose of this meeting is to talk about the benefits and disadvantages of our new project . 
 My husband goes out drinking with his friends every night . I'm fed up with it . 
 That restaurant has six parking spaces . 
 Almost zero . 
 Oh , never mind . I am just going to do the laundry today . 
 It really doesn't matter at all . I never did like it anyway . 
 Hello , Candy . My name is Jim White . Nice to meet you . 
 I'm from New Orleans . What about you ? 
 Really ? This is a beautiful town . 
 OK . Can I have your phone number ? 
 I will . Bye . 
 Yes , the nearest one is at the third cross of this road . 
 Just walk down the road for a few minutes , and you'll find it on your right . 
 What can I do for you today ? 
 What is your problem ? 
 Do you have a statement for your debit card ? 
 Which charges are you talking about ? 
 We ’ re going to have to do an investigation . 
 I ’ m not sure , but in the meantime we will freeze these charges . 
 Have a nice weekend ! 
 Do you have any plans ? 
 Oh , I haven't decided what I'm going to do yet . 
 Oh , no . You see I'm in the middle of something . Could he wait ? 
 All right , all right . He'll get them as soon as possible . 
 I don't really like sci-fi movies because they're always really weird . 
 Hmm ... you're right . Well , I guess ' Terminator ' is an exception to the rule . 
 That's true . Her husband is a fat cat . 
 She is only after his money . 
 But many girls nowaday do want to marry a man filthy with dough . 
 Yes . It was sunny and warm yesterday but the wind is really blowing hard now . 
 I'm going to put on more clothes , too . 
 I don't know . Do you like snowing ? 
 You can read the newspaper . Maybe it will tell you whether it will snow or not . 
 Oh Gush ! The first day of my career is over . I can not breathe now after dealing with so many documents . But I heard the notice that our company will hold two-week staff training . 
 But for me , the training is waste of my precious time . 
 They must have got in through the kitchen window . 
 I am afraid your diamond bracelet has gone , darling ! 
 Look ! they've taken your fur coat too . 
 I noticed they've taken our radio and left the television . 
 I wish we could , but we can't , you see , we are not insured . 
 I was born in London , but I spent most of my childhood in Hongkong . 
 I had a pretty strict up-bring , and my parents and I were always fighting about it . 
 Oh , sure . Once they reached middle age , they became a lot less uptight . 
 My parents wanted me to stay in Hongkong , but I decided to go back to England , I graduated from Oxford University with a degree in English literature . 
 I ’ m a freelance writer . i write magazine articles and fiction books 
 No , I didn ’ t . I was an english teacher for about five years , but by the time I was thirty , I decided I want a fresh challenge . 
 I started writing margin articles for fun , and eventually was asked to write a book , so I was pretty lucky . 
 Yes , it ’ s about a group of friends living in a foreign country , and all the strange experiences they have 
 Hello , may I help you ? 
 Yes , everything is 25 % off . 
 Sure , we have both skirts and slacks that will go well with the sweater . I especially like this flowery skirt . It's very much in style this year . 
 Look on the rack to your right . 
 Well , that's it . 7 appointments in Paris at beginning of next week , and 4 in Frankfurt at the end of the week . 
 Now it's a question of getting there . I need a flight to Paris on Sunday evening and a hotel in Paris for 3 nights . I have to be in Frankfurt by 11 on Thursday morning . And I will need a hotel for one night . I will head home on Friday . 
 My last appointment is at 3 , so I should be free by 5 at the very latest . I think I could get to the airport by 6 . 
 No , not really . 
 No , but I am sure it won't take more than an hour . 
 You are a pessimist . 
 Excuse me . I'm afraid you're in my seat . You've moved my books . 
 You must have realized somebody was here . 
 Will you introduce me to the new colleague ? 
 No , we haven't . 
 Hello ! 
 Sure , just a second.Who ' s calling ? 
 Ok , sue , I will just go in get her . 
 Most of it is . You should sign up . 
 Didn't you read about Paypal and Bidpai ? They are very safe . 
 That's the last three or four numbers on the back of your credit card where your signature is . 
 Let ’ s go to the seashore on Saturday . 
 It ’ s expensive , too . Let ’ s just sit in the sun and go swimming instead . 
 Good morning . I want to apply for a library card . 
 But I hear that the card is free . 
 There will be a refund when I return the card , right ? 
 OK , here you are . 
 Where ’ s what wagon ? 
 What water wagon ? 
 That ’ s my wagon . I need the water to water my flowers in the yard . 
 So what do you feel like doing this evening ? How about going to the cinema ? 
 That's good ! I've also heard there will be a party held by the Students ' Union tomorrow evening . Would you like to go with me tomorrow night ? 
 Why ? Do you have to prepare for your examination ? Oh , come on , girl , relaxation is also very important . 
 Oh , God , I've forgotten it . 
 Oh , no , I don't want to know any more geeks like you . 
 Really ? Is there a foreign teacher for every class ? 
 So you just talk all the time ? 
 That sounds interesting . I'll go with you tomorrow evening . 
 Diane Grant ? I haven't seen you for ages ! 
 Pretty good . Say , you've really changed ! 
 Well , you look great ! How are you ? 
 That's terrific ! 
 haven't been sleeping well recently . 
 every night my roommates watch the Korean soap operas till mid-night . I am not a big fan of Korean shows and I don't know how to tell them to stop without hurting their feelings . 
 yeah , I know , but I find these sorts of things hard to say . They won't like it if I tell them to turn off the TV . Now I just hope the show will end soon . 
 yeah , I crave my own space . i just so tired of having people around me all time . 
 I was worried where you were . 
 Yes , you should have . 
 Yes , could you put me in the non-smoking section ? 
 If one's available , please . But not over the wing . 
 Where did you see it ? 
 You found an apartment in the ads ? 
 Tell me about the apartment . 
 How much is the rent for the apartment ? 
 That ’ s pretty cheap for out here . 
 Congratulations on the new apartment . 
 Hi , this is Monica . I was wondering when we can work on this financial report . 
 Shall I see you on Friday morning ? 
 We must find some time to read report . 
 That ’ s all right . Then see you on Friday afternoon . 
 John hasn't turned up and Stefan is ill . Do we have anyone on stand-by ? 
 Could you show me the way to the railway station ? 
 Would you like to be my guide ? 
 OK , now let's go on to talk about initial deposits . 
 For Agreement Savings , we ask for 100,000 RIB . 
 You can use a Type A Agreement Savings Account the same was as a Settlement Account . 
 With a Type B Account , it cannot be directly involved in any transaction and it cannot be applied to any external withdrawal service . 
 I am not in the mood . 
 I was told my girlfriend was speaking ill of me . It's a real letdown . 
 But she did and it made me disappointed . 
 But she means a lot to me . 
 Oh , I just can't forget it . 
 Yes , I'm now working in a company . 
 Right . I enjoy what I'm doing . 
 Really ? I ’ m not sure that I would like all the attention . There have been numerous cases of paparazzi interfering with star ’ s private live in recent years . 
 I wouldn ’ t mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice , but it would get tedious after a while . Imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you . 
 I think you ’ ll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns . You ’ d also have to be very careful about every word you said . If you appeared on a chat show and said something silly , it 
 That ’ s a great idea . Which charities would you support ? 
 You ’ d have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity , so you ’ d really need to be very careful . Anyway , I ’ d be the first to buy your posters and I ’ d attend your first book - 
 First of all , thank you for accepting this job . 
 What are your salary expectations ? 
 We ’ ll offer you a monthly salary to begin with , in addition , we offer one percent commission and all your sales . You also enjoy life insurance and health insurance . What ’ s starting salary would you expect here ? 
 That sounds reasonable . 
 Yes , you have 2 weeks paid vacation a year , and you get it additional week after 4 years , and then again , after 9 years if you decide to stay that long , we promote from within based on performance , so there is an excellent chance that you could become a sales manager or even a region manager . 
 Thanks , Jane . 
 What are we eating for lunch ? 
 I kind of want pizza . 
 So , what do you feel like eating then ? 
 I already had a burger yesterday . 
 We can just each get what we want to get . 
 Do you know a place that sells pizza and burgers ? 
 I have a reservation for a single with bath . 
 What's the room rate ? It is a little expensive for me , do you have any other rooms ? 
 May I see the room ? I ’ ll take this room . Is the rate for the room only ? 
 I am sorry , but I can't stay until the end of class . 
 I have an appointment . 
 No , but I'll make sure someone helps me out this week with my missed work . 
 I am leaving right now . 
 Thanks , Professor . I'll make sure everything gets taken care of . 
 There is a new restaurant opening up in town next month . 
 My favorite , Mexican . And I've heard that the head chef is from San Paulo . 
 I can hardly wait ! 
 I'll double check the announcement . 
 Hello ! My name is Sandals , I have a reservation . 
 Here you are . 
 Of course . Will American Express do ? 
 No problem . Here's my VISA . 
 Yes , that sounds like what I want . 
 I want to check out today . My plane leaves at 3 p . m . 
 I am in Room 205 . My name is Bill Smith . When shall I check out ? 
 Oh , I didn't know that . 
 That's very considerate of you . May I have my bill ? 
 How much is it ? 
 I'd like it to be charged to my credit card . 
 do you have any plans for tomorrow night ? 
 sure . What movies were you thinking about going to ? 
 yes . Isn't the director of that movie the same guy who directed Shaun of the Dead ? 
 to be honest , I didn't really like Shaun of the Dead . Besides , I like movies with a happy ending best . 
 I was thinking of seeing You , Me and Dupree . It's a typical Hollywood blockbuster . 
 yeah , I suppose you wouldn't want to see that , huh ? 
 It depends on who the film is about . Which movie did you have in mind ? 
 that sounds fantastic ! What time is it playing ? 
 great . Shall I meet you there around 7:45 tomorrow night ? 
 There is a tornado warning on . My mother just told me she heard it on the radio . 
 It means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area . 
 No . Not necessarily in town . But in southern Wisconsin somewhere . A tornado has been spotted . They have two stages here.This is what is called a " tornado watch . " That means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado . 
 Yes . People should look out , because maybe there will be tornadoes coming.So it's called a " watch . " 
 Yes . If a tornado has been spotted , they announce a " tornado warning " . So if there's a tornado warning on , it means a tornado is out there somewhere . 
 Well . Tornadoes can be dangerous , it's true.If we hear something like a loud train coming , then we have to go in the basement . 
 That is what tornadoes sound like . They sound like trains . They're very loud . 
 Maybe . It depends on the tornado.Some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour.That is very fast . Others aren't so fast . 
 I've only seen one in my life . I was looking out the window . It was around two miles away . It was very interesting to watch.But it was heading toward my friend's house . So I quickly called them on the phone . 
 No , it didn't . But they are glad I called them . 
 They were all sitting in the living room watching TV.They had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house.If it had hit them , they could have all been killed . 
 Not so many really . But a lot of houses are destroyed sometimes . 
 May I have your flight number , please ? 
 And your name , please ? 
 Yes , sir . You're booked on Flight 201 , leaving in one hour . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Ten Yuan . 
 One Yuan . 
 And here's your change . Please check if it is correct . 
 Welcome to come again . 
 Excuse me , how can I get special discount coupons ? 
 Can I get a discount coupon if I buy these goods ? 
 But how much discount can I get if I use it to buy goods next time ? 
 Can I buy everything in the supermarket by it ? . 
 How long can I keep it ? 
 I see . I will take 9 bags of sugar so that I can get 3 coupons . 
 Is supper ready ? I'm hungry . 
 Ok . What are we having ? 
 I'll have my beef well-done , please . By the way , don't we have soup tonight ? 
 Let me see . Well , I'd like onion soup . Thank you . 
 I think so . Why did you ask that ? 
 Congratulations ! Why do people hold parties before the baby is born ? 
 In any case , I like baby showers , because they allow friends and family to share the joy and excitement of welcoming a new life into the world . 
 Of course . I will prepare a good gift for the new arrival . 
 Now , you are to board the plane.We ' re sorry that we haven't done much to help you when you stayed in China . 
 We are ready to help you . 
 I'd like to . I'm sure your visit will help to promote the friendship and understanding between both of us.Welcome to China again . 
 Thank you . I will if I have chance.Goodbye and happy landing ! 
 Why aren't you doing well in the class ? 
 Is everything alright ? 
 What took so long ? I thought your flight was supposed to arrive 3 hours ago ! 
 I didn't hear anything about a delay . I thought everything was running on time . What happened ? 
 Then what ? Your plane was three hours late ! 
 Turbulence is pretty normal , isn't it ? 
 So where did you land ? 
 That sounds like a nightmare ! 
 Have you had anything to eat ? 
 I had a few coffees while I was waiting . Let's get out of here ! 
 Oh , but I Just want to pick up a package . It won't take long . 
 Can I park here just for a second ? 
 May I help you ? 
 Do you have any style in your mind ? 
 I recommend you this one . It's a very popular kind of coat-the most recent thing . 
 You look like a basket case . 
 What's the problem ? 
 Yeah , and ? 
 Why ? 
 I guess you think twice next time he comes . 
 So how long has he here for ? 
 Well , I know you do the right thing . 
 Hello , Miao Ping . I'd like to open a Foreign Currency Account today . 
 I need to open a US dollar account , trade with America is going up each year . 
 Good , thanks . I look forward to hearing from you . 
 Willing to help , maybe , but not as helpful as you think . 
 Last night he told the children a cliff-hanger story and both of them were scared out of sleep . 
 But Steven , you've called in sick 3 times during the last three weeks . 
 All right , then . But don't forget to bring a doctors note tomorrow . 
 Looks like a good party , I probably know about half the people . 
 Where ? 
 I don ’ t know . Never saw him before . Why ? 
 so , which sport do you prefer---basketball or baseball ? 
 I thought everyone liked basketball . Why don't you like it ? 
 that makes sense . 
 my absolute favorite is ice hockey . 
 sure , many times . It's an exciting game for spectators to watch . 
 it's not that difficult . If you want to watch a game with me , I can explain the rules and the tactics while we're watching . 
 not for a while , but we could watch an old one on the internet so I can explain the game to you . 
 let's watch the Canadian team . They have a good manager and a great coach . 
 Definitely . I Ve got the hell out of the company . Anything new ? 
 Really ? Are you willing to recommend me for the position ? 
 I appreciate the effort , sir . 
 How about the languages . 
 That's more convenient . 
 Yes . But I am afraid it is too thick to wear in summer . 
 How much is it ? 
 OK , that is reasonable . I will take it . 
 No . Could you tell me something more about it ? I want to play well . 
 You just said 10 rounds . 
 Perhaps you can tell me a little more about this . 
 Where is it ? 
 Get in , please . 
 Don't worry , you'll be there plenty of time . That is it . 7.15 $ , please . 
 What happens if we make a deal and thirty to sixty days after delivery the price goes down and you didn't get the best possible price ? How do I handle that ? 
 Right ! So how do I do that ? What will make you happy ? 
 Excuse me ? 
 What kind of change , just in prices ? 
 You mean on product availability , reliability and price ? 
 So it's like you want me to be your eyes and ears into the industry . I can do that , provided the company I'm working for isn't hurt . 
 You look really wiped out ? 
 Not a good day . I hate to tell you that Mr . Thomas wants to see the profit ’ s statement for new project tomorrow morning . 
 Do you mind if I get a lift in your car , please ? 
 Oh you ’ re so kind ! 
 I want to meet you . Are you free this evening ? 
 No , I just want to meet you . 
 Hmm , that's all right . Shall we meet at the bar near the beach ? 
 How is your business on the Internet , Steven ? 
 I am sorry to hear that . It shows that you should buy companies , not ideas . 
 Yes , I agree with you . I am going to find a good company and invest in it soon . 
 Yes , I will . I should learn more from you . After all I am green hand on it . 
 OK . My wife sent me a message and asked me to go home just now . I am leaving . 
 Bye . 
 Yeah . Whatever became of him ? 
 That's great . We should visit him some time . 
 No , I assure you . 
 Ok . 
 Of course . 
 I'll see . I will if I can but I won't promise . 
 Yes . But only if you ask me nicely . 
 Ok . I'll keep my promise . 
 Yes , what style do you prefer ? 
 OK , here you are . 
 Good morning , Mr . Zhang . 
 How are you ? How nice to see you again . How is everything going ? 
 Not bad , thanks ! Our company has sent me to pick you up here . 
 Tom , how do you think of second-hand goods ? 
 I'm considering buying a second-hand computer for I'm short of money now . 
 But do you really mean that the second - hand goods are just as good as the new ones ? 
 Have you ever found yourself in a situation when you have to lie to people who trust you ? 
 Yes . Is it wrong to lie to them even if it is for their good ? 
 But sometimes it is so hard to tell the truth . 
 Would you like anything else , sir ? 
 Certainly . Would you like your coffee with your dinner or later ? 
 Of course . 
 What have you done ? 
 Why don't you go shopping online ? 
 Why not ? Let me recommend a website . 
 It sells almost everything you can see in the department . 
 Is everything ready for the Christmas party ? 
 I like the big star on the top of the tree . I ’ ll put the presents under the tree later , how ’ s the food . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve bought all the things to go in it . It won ’ t take long to make . How many people are coming to the party ? 
 Do we have Christmas pudding ? 
 Yes , I did . I send most of them a week ago . I ’ Ve brought some with me to the party to give to people in person . 
 I hope you didn ’ t forget mine ! 
 Are you nuts ? What would my friends think if they see me in a hired car ? 
 Oh this is hard ! Well , I ’ ll see what I can do . 
 Yes . I would like some information for requesting a loan . 
 I see . So let me get this straight . If I borrow let ’ s say , ten thousand dollars , how much will I have to pay each month ? 
 It sounds good but , there is just one problem . I have a terrible credit score . 
 You know what ? I don ’ t really need the money . Thanks anyways ! 
 I'm in a bit of a hurry , Miss Liu . Can you wait for a minute ? 
 All right . What's the problem ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . Take good care of your husband . I'll find another one to replace you . 
 ... Who you were with ? I didn ’ t know whom you were with . 
 Sorry , it ’ s from the Godfather . It ’ s when the , when the movie producer realizes Tom Higgins had emissary of Vito Corleone , it ’ s just before the horse ’ s head ends up in the bed with all the bloody sheets , you know , wakes up , and AAAL ! Never mind . 
 Why would I spy on you ? 
 The entrance to our store is around the corner . And there ’ s no other way of saying that . It ’ s not the name of our store . It ’ s where it is . And you do not own the phrase around the corner . 
 Look , the reason I came into your store is because I was spending the day with Annabell and matt . And I was buying them presents . I ’ m the type of guy who likes to buy his way into the hearts of children who are his relative . And there ’ s only one place to find a children ’ s book in the neighborhood . That will not always be the case . And it was yours . And it is a charming little bookstore . You probably sell what 350,000 worth of books in a year . 
 I like fishing too . I usually fish near the lake . 
 What a shame . 
 What are you planning on making ? 
 The only way you're eating tonight is if you cook . 
 I don't know . What do you want to eat ? 
 That sounds delicious . 
 I already told you that I'm not cooking tonight . 
 I already know . Start cooking . 
 That's a good idea . You'd better hurry up before they've filled all classes . Many people are learning how to drive now . 
 I am not sure . You can search for them on the Internet . 
 Let me see . teetee Training School , summer program , 3,000 Yuan , learn how to drive within one month , and get driver's license within three months . 
 I think so . Let's see the next one , 3,500 Yuan , summer program . Forget it . 
 Search on the Internet then , see if we can find something more about it . 
 Don't worry . Let's check out some other schools . 
 Well , I'll consider the possibility . By the way , when do I open the L / C if I want the goods to be delivered in June ? 
 Could you possibly effect shipment more promptly ? 
 Very well , Mrs.Wang . I'll not reduce my order . I'll take the full quantity you offer . And I'll arrange for the Letter of Credit to be opened in your favor as soon as I get home . 
 Early next week . In the meantime , I should be very pleased if you would get everything ready . I hope that the goods can dispatched promptly after you get my Letter of Credit . 
 That'll be fine . I appreciate your cooperation . 
 By the way , Mrs . Wang , we have a mind to do joint participation with you on Japanese arts and crafts in our market . Would you entertain this proposal ? 
 If you feel our proposal is attractive , it is estimated that business to the extent of over twenty million marks can be done in this manner . 
 All right . Anyway , I'll be staying here for another two weeks . But I'm looking forward to having something done in this respect . 
 We have to pick up Conrad before the party . 
 We're supposed to meet him at Cal's Bar at 10 
 Yes . 
 Yes , it is . Conrad is gay . Didn't you know ? 
 Why not ? We're supposed to meet him there . 
 Why should he do that ? It isn't illegal for us to go in . 
 You sound like you're afraid . 
 You've never been in a gay bar before ? 
 But it's just a bar . There's no danger.You shouldn't be so homophobic . 
 Listen . If you refuse to go in , Conrad will be offended.You don't hate gay people , do you ? 
 Don't worry about it . There is nothing strange about it.If Conrad's there , we'll leave for the party.If he's not , we'll sit down and have a drink . 
 I'm glad you feel that way.We ' ll leave in about ten minutes , alright ? 
 You missed the film.That ' s a shame . 
 Yes . I got very excited . 
 Say , Anna , what are you doing tonight ? Would you like to go out ? 
 Well , how about tomorrow night ? Are you doing anything then ? 
 I'm going to see a musical . Would you like to come ? 
 All right ! Thanks ! 
 I sure am . How about you ? 
 Do you know where your polling place is ? 
 Oh , really ? 
 I ’ m not sure . 
 I didn ’ t receive my polling place in the mail . 
 I didn ’ t know that . I ’ ll go look right now . 
 Where are you going ? 
 Again ? You just went last week ! You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! Honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ? 
 Why ? I don ’ t want to have nail polish or anything like that ! 
 Yeah , sounds like something I should definitely do . 
 Yes , show me your ticket and passport please . 
 No problem . Wish you a nice trip . 
 That ’ s great . He ’ s the best runner I ’ Ve seen this season . I ’ m sure he ’ ll win a medal at the Olympics . 
 I really don ’ t know . I don ’ t think we ’ ll win many gold medals , but I think we should win several silver and bronze ones . 
 In the last Olympics , we did very well in swimming , cycling and ball sports . I think we ’ ll do well in those same events . 
 I think we can expect to get between 30 to 40 medals in total . 
 Look ! It is not working well . Did you try out the bike when you bought it . 
 But it would save a lot of trouble if you had taken it for a test ride . 
 What's the matter ? 
 Can I have your keys , please ? Thank you . Here's your statement . 
 Oh , these are the phone charges and these are for something from the bar . 
 I know , sir . Those aren't telephone company charges . Those are hotel charges . 
 I'm sorry , sir . It's our policy . 
 Thank you . Welcome to our hotel again . 
 How are you ? I haven't heard from you in ages . 
 Pretty busy.So are you back for good ? 
 Well , I'm not working on the weekend , so we could grab some beer , ice and our fishing rods , and head out to the river . 
 Same here . 
 Her name is Laura , isn't it ? 
 How old is she ? 
 What does she look like ? 
 Pretty , is she ? 
 Besides salary what kind of allowance can I expect ? 
 Can you elaborate it more concretely ? 
 I have been feeling sick for three days . 
 Not much better.Thank you . 
 Good morning , I'd like a haircut . 
 Just a trim will do . 
 Did they finally fill that post , how come I haven't seen her ? She must have not been inducted yet . 
 Is she just working temporarily ? What are they going to do when Maggie comes back from leave . 
 I need to get my prescription filled . 
 If I wanted to , could I have it mailed to me ? 
 Are there any special instructions about this medication ? 
 Can I take it with food ? 
 Are there any side effects with this medication ? 
 What's your email address ? 
 Bulldog 123 . Are you sure that's all ? 
 No . That's incomplete . 
 What's your mailing address ? 
 That's correct . 
 Bulldog 123 is just the street . You have to give me the city , state , and ZIP code . 
 Excuse me , do the buses stop here ? 
 I want to go to Broadway and 82nd Street.Can I take any bus that comes along ? 
 How often do the buses run ? 
 Fine.How long does it take to get to 82nd Street ? 
 Yes , I am . I arrived only three days ago from Japan . 
 I like it very much , but it's a little confusing to me . 
 Thank you for the information . 
 This is a great meal ! 
 Who taught you how to cook this well ? 
 Wow , what is in this chicken dish ? 
 Is the soup a shrimp soup ? 
 I think I got lucky in choosing a wine that blends with this meal . 
 She is , like , mega-intense , isn't she ? 
 What's it like to work with her ? 
 Tell me about it . 
 Vince wants us to have everything debugged and ready to go by the end of the month . 
 You are kidding . 
 Although we have many things in common , we'are not soul mates . 
 I don't think you can . In China , our currency is not freely convertible yet . 
 No . You can go to the Bank of China to exchange some US dollars at the current exchange rate of the day you exchange them . The maximum amount you can exchange is $ 2,000 . 
 The only official way is to go to Bank of China . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 You begin by applying for a corporate charter . And then stockholders hold a meeting to organize the corporation , an individual has limited liability and the right . 
 OK . 
 Can I help you ? 
 This is the new style.Two hundred and twenty-eight . 
 Of course , please . 
 Two hundred and ten yuan . It is the lowest price . 
 Well , two hundred yuan . 
 OK , I'll wrap it for you . 
 He prefers suits to jackets . 
 As a matter of fact , he is . 
 Not really , I like watching horror movies , like ' The Unborn . ' 
 I like horror movies because I like to be scared . 
 I know . Did your mom double check on the church reservations ? 
 OK ... and what about the buffet and the cake ? Did your mom call the caterer ? 
 Great . She'll be so happy . 
 yes , but I have a few questions for you . 
 first , I ’ d like to know if you offer employees sick leave . 
 even if I ’ m only sick for one day ? 
 that ’ s pretty strict , if you ask me . 
 I see . I guess that makes sense . 
 yes . Maternity leave is mentioned in the contract , but there ’ s nothing in the contract alout paternity leave . Do you offer anything to fathers ? 
 how many days of paternity leave do you offer ? 
 why are women allowed so much more time for maternity leave ? 
 I guess so . I don ’ t have any other questions . Should I sign here then ? 
 John , if you don't mind , I'd like to ask you a personal question . 
 All right . Are you married ? 
 Then , when do you plan to get married ? 
 Do you have anything to declare ? 
 You can take 100 cigarettes and 2 bottles of wine with you free of charge . 
 Hello , can I help you ? 
 When to leave ? 
 Ok . Can I have your name , please ? 
 And your telephone number ? 
 OK . Right then . 
 You got a letter in the mail . 
 What is it ? 
 What does it say ? 
 You can ’ t be serious ! 
 Are you all right ? 
 I ’ m sorry that you didn ’ t get in . 
 I'm not comfortable about this , Sandy . I don't understand most of these games . 
 I don't want to lose all my money . 
 I guess you're right . 
 Yes , I remember.You must decide how much money you will gamble before you start to play . 
 I know it's true , Sandy . But still some people lose control.They start to gamble , and they can't stop . 
 Okay . 
 Maybe 500 dollars . 
 I don't want people to think I'm stingy . 
 What type of movies do you like ? 
 That's an interesting combination . How about western movies ? 
 Why don't you like horror ? They're entertaining . 
 Ha ha . I know what you mean . But it's just a movie . They need for the characters to do that . 
 Just tor three days . I won't need these luggages.CouId I put them here ? 
 Well , maybe I can put them in the airport storage there . 
 Is Bob home ? 
 The winter in Ottawa is freezing . 
 I think I will be adapted to it . 
 Yes , that's the reason why I remain here . 
 I'll throw out the garbage . 
 No , you can't , darling . The grass is wet . 
 No , you can't . The bench is wet , too . 
 Can't you see a notice on the bench ? 
 What does the notice say ? 
 The Canada Day is on the 1st of July . 
 The national anthem of Canada is ' O Canada ' . 
 Yes , I could sing it when I was very young . 
 Can I use my green pad again to write you admiring notes ? 
 You miss me , don't you ? 
 OK , I'm in . When do I start ? 
 I think it's high time we had lunch . 
 I am sorry for that . I was so attracted by the beautiful scenery . 
 I suppose the local one . 
 Employee welfare ? What all does that include ? 
 What kind of considerations are we talking about ? 
 Our company now has n ombudsman ? 
 I was wondering if you could go over the services available at EDD to help me get a job . 
 Do I have to have a computer at home ? 
 Do you have any other services available ? 
 What kinds of workshops are available at the EDD ? 
 Are there other places , outside of EDD , that I may look for work ? 
 Hello , is Marie Ward there , please ? 
 Ok . 
 Can you give her a message , please ? 
 Please tell her to give Colin a call when she gets back . She has my number . 
 Thank you for your help . 
 I'd be a basket case if you think of me that way . I need your understanding . 
 Can ’ t you be more considerate ? I need your encouragement . 
 Excuse me . Do you have this in blue ? 
 And sorry . I can't find the price . How much is it ? 
 OK . Do you have it in extra small ? 
 Where are you from ? 
 Where in China is Guangzhou ? 
 Do you know that working overtime in some companies is a regular thing ? 
 An average ten hours or more a day according to a survey , the worst thing is that the employees get no pay for that . 
 But these people say nothing about that . They are worried about losing their job because there is surplus in labor force these days . 
 Excuse me , miss . Can I have my dinner please ? I am so hungry . 
 Then please give me a cup of coffee . 
 No , I was way too busy studying all the time . How about you ? 
 What was that like ? 
 What did you do ? 
 Did you get any perks on the job ? 
 How do you like this dress ? 
 Something attractive and dressy . Maybe a little sexy too . New Year's Eve is a special occasion and it only happens once a year , right ? 
 People here always wear the best clothes they have . Many people go out and buy clothes especially for New Year's Eve . 
 Before the New Year , we always send greeting cards to our relatives and friends to wish them a happy year . On the street and in stores people usually greet others with a ' Happy New Year ' . It's also common for people to make a New Year's resolution . 
 It's when people quit a bad habit or do something they find hard to do . Many people resolve to quit smoking , lose weight , or stop nagging their wife , etc . However , it usually lasts only for a few days ! 
 We're going to a night club for dinner and dancing , then we'll go down to the city square for the big celebration . There's always a fireworks display put on by the local government . We all want you to come too . 
 What courses did you major in ? 
 What courses did you minor in ? 
 How may I help you ? 
 Is that all you need ? 
 Is that all you would like to check out ? 
 Do you have your library card ? 
 Make sure to take proper care of this video . 
 If you damage the video , you will be fined . 
 What are you going to take ? 
 Of course . What kind of soup do you like ? Clear or thick ? 
 Good morning , John . Have you finished reading the novel by Dickens borrowed from the library ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . How are you feeling now ? 
 How many days do you plan to finish reading it ? 
 OK . After three days , I will come to you for it . 
 Do you know much about computers ? 
 I've just been reading an article about them . They'll be used for all sorts of things now . 
 Yes , but they are used for other things , too . Do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to Paris . 
 The man asked where we want to go , then he type out the information on the form and waited for a reply . A few moment later , he gave us two tickets . 
 That's right . 
 You just ate . 
 There's no food left from dinner . 
 Do you know what kind of snack that you want ? 
 Why don't you make yourself a sandwich or something ? 
 A PB & J is pretty easy to make . 
 Knock yourself out . 
 Yes . But I'm not used to eating American-style breakfast . 
 I saw yesterday that they rent windsurfers at the beach . I want to rent one . 
 No , but it looks fun . I always wanted to try it . 
 Sure . What ? 
 But I always wanted to try it . 
 Well , I will see . How was your day at the office ? 
 Well , you know , the traffic in Beijing is sometimes dangerous . Therefore , I have to remind you of something . First , you should obey the traffic rules , don't break in the red light . Second , don't play a joke with your friends when riding on the bike . Third , do not hurry up when riding , or would make an accident . Finally , remember come on the left and go on the right ! 
 I'd like to buy some postcards of Beijing . 
 Looks nice . Okay , I'll take it . 
 Didn ’ t I tell you ? It ’ s over ! 
 It was a few things . The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary , but she stood me up ! 
 No , but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her with another man at a club near my home ! 
 I wanted to , but I knew that if I spoke to her , I'd just blow up at her , so I decided to just go home . I called her later that night , but she didn't answer the phone . 
 I know . I still haven ’ t heard from her . The good thing is that I ’ m so angry with her that I don ’ t feel sad about not having her around . 
 I guess so . It would be nice to know why she did this though . 
 Hi , Lilly , it ’ s so nice to see you again . 
 Nothing special . I had a get-together with some schoolmates at the high school , visited the Internet and read a couple of books which I had been longing for . How about yours ? 
 What can I do for you ? 
 Would you like regular car wash package ? 
 Well , we will wash the exterior form top to bottom . We use a special shampoo , which gives the body that extra shine . 
 Of course . We wash the windows inside and out . 
 We use a vacuum cleaner that removes all the dirt , and we throw away all of the trash that we can find . 
 OK . I see . 
 Yes , sir . It's the specialty of our restaurant . 
 OK , sir . Don't you want to have some drinks ? 
 Oh ! ! ! I have a horrible toothache . 
 I hate dentists . 
 It always hurts . I hate going . 
 O . K . , O . K . , I ’ ll go . 
 When do we get off the bus ? 
 I feel like we've been on this bus forever . 
 Are you sure we weren't supposed to get off already ? 
 I thought you knew where we get off at . 
 Seriously ? 
 That's the last time I get on a bus with you . 
 Hey Nick , what are you up to ? 
 Seriously ? You mean to fire a real weapon ? I don ’ t know man . 
 Yeah that would be cool ! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! Or what about a flame thrower ! 
 Wow , I didn ’ t know ! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies ! 
 Let ’ s do it ! 
 It ’ s quite an interesting place to live . The best thing to do in my city is go shopping . There are several indoor and outdoor markets , department stores and shopping malls . 
 Not really . Cars are not permitted in several parts of city centre , especially in the main shopping areas . The public transport system is pretty good . 
 There are restaurants with food from all over the world . We have a small china-town near the city centre . There are many Indian , thai , and Italian restaurants all over the city centre . There are many s 
 There are several good clubs near the city centre . Many people in my city prefer something more cultural , so we several theatres and venues for classical music concerts and operas . 
 It is . I hope you ’ ll have time to come for a visit soon . You really should come during the summer , when the weather is better and there ’ s more happening outdoors . 
 Over there . 
 I ’ m very pleased with their performances . Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . That ’ s very fast for a kid his age . 
 He ’ s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ’ s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ’ s fine for someone hi 
 The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes . 
 They ’ re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ’ s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ’ re not very fast , but that ’ s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape . 
 I ’ d be afraid to jump from that height ! 
 It seems that they really enjoy to go faster , higher and further . 
 I live in an apartment downtown . 
 Not much . But there is a lot of traffic . I can't stand the noise sometimes ! Where do you live ? 
 Oh , I bet it's really quiet . But is there much to do there ? 
 Hey . Let's trade places one weekend ! 
 Have you received any degrees ? 
 How about your academic records at college ? 
 That's very impressive . Which course did you like best ? 
 Can you tell me why you changed your major when you were a graduate student ? 
 Did you get any honors and awards at college ? 
 You ’ re going to set up your own law office , aren ’ t you ? 
 If you need help , don ’ t hesitate to ask me . 
 I ’ d like to wish you every success in your new venture . 
 Good luck to you . 
 Yes . 
 So can I expect to hear from you to set up an appointment for an interview sometime next week ? 
 Thank you very much . Bye-bye . 
 There ’ re traffic jams everywhere . 
 Yeah . We should have more roads built . 
 Do you know that Mary ’ s marriage is on the rocks ? 
 I saw her husband have it out with her yesterday . 
 it ’ s such a nice day outside . Let ’ s take a walk into town and do some window-shopping . 
 I know . But we could get some exercise in , and we could get some errands run , too . Window-shopping won ’ t cost you anything . 
 well , we could go to the newsagent ’ s to pick up the Sunday paper , go to the butcher ’ s to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner , and to the chemist ’ s to pick up your prescription from the doctor . 
 fine , we ’ ll do that on the way home , so we don ’ t have to carry it the whole time . 
 I promise . We ’ re only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven ’ t had time for . 
 do you have any money ? 
 for our errands , and maybe a little extra for something from a vendor on the street . 
 I agreed to not go into the mall , but I can still look at things in the market ! 
 Fred , have you made the plan for April 28th ? 
 You go ! 
 Is there anything after the meeting ? In that case , would you add one plan ? I want to visit our guest Mr . Ross after the meeting . Can you arrange it for me ? 
 Well ... I'm pretty busy . but ... all right . come in . What can I do for you ? 
 Not at all . Take a seat . Now , what can I do for you ? 
 Yes , but why should you want to do that ? 
 Not at all . Go ahead . 
 Yes . I'd delighted if you did . 
 Dear , let ’ s drop the subject . 
 What's that ? I thought our negotiation went very well . 
 $ 1500 is almost the lowest price we can offer . 
 You get what you pay for , considering the high quality , our price is very reasonable . 
 Sorry , I can't give you an immediate answer for this problem , let me talk to our general manager first . 
 Good day ! What can we do for you ? 
 Buying a new car is a big expense ; we understand that , so we have a variety of loans to suit your needs . 
 With our Personal Automobile Consumer Loan , the borrower can borrow up to 80 % of the purchase price . 
 That's great . You will need to make an initial down payment of 20 % , and then we can get going with this . 
 They promised us a sea view . 
 Isn't it awful ? I can't bear to look at it . I don't think I can stand this place for two weeks . 
 Hello Mike ! Would you like a drink ? 
 Were you celebrating something ? 
 It ’ s a bad idea to drink a combination of alcoholic drinks . You should stick with one for the whole evening . 
 I usually only drink beer and I rarely drink more than a few pints . 
 Let me buy you a soft drink then . How about a coke ? 
 Rally ? ... barman ! ... a large coke with ice and lemon , please ... thanks . Here ’ s the money . 
 Yes . I thought it might be interesting to learn a little about wine ... 
 Yes . I ’ m looking forward to it . 
 I hate to admit it , but they're good . And fast . The Filipino kid is a genius . 
 It'll be close , but we'll make it . 
 And if we don't need them , we won't need Zina , either . 
 Turn right outside the school ; go along until you come to the main road ; turn left ; go straight ahead , straight on at the roundabout , down the hill , and turn left at the bottom . 
 You are welcome . Hope you can find it soon . 
 I don't really know where I want to go . I am having trouble thinking of a particular restaurant . 
 OK , we could look at that . 
 I really like Japanese or Thai food . 
 Oh yeah ! I saw a review of that restaurant on television . The reviewer loved it ! 
 That would work out great ! Why don't we call and get a reservation ? 
 Yes , I'll have a steak , please . 
 Rare , please . 
 Coffee , please . 
 Red cooked carp and rape with fresh mushrooms . 
 Sour-peppery soup . 
 I'll use ginger , garlic scallion , hot pepper and vinegar . 
 No , don't need , I can do myself . 
 But you must cook that dinner next time . 
 Sorry , I have to rush off and catch the 9 o'clock train to Paris . 
 Until we meet again . 
 Good idea . Is there a good movie on ? 
 All right . But it'll be difficult to buy tickets I suppose . 
 What time does it begin ? 
 I'll come for you at about eight . 
 Hey , David . Would you like some drinks ? 
 Good idea . I like hanging out in bars at night . 
 For killing time and making new friends . 
 Calm down ! My little guy ! You'll get used to that after you come here several times . 
 I'd like a gin and tonic . 
 I'd like to buy some milk powder . What would you recommend ? 
 My son . He is two years old . 
 Is it ? 
 May I have a look at the introduction ? 
 How much is this shirt ? 
 It's rather expensive , isn't it ? 
 How about 50 yuan ? 
 Then let's split the difference and I'll give you 60 yuan , OK ? 
 All right . 
 Most people were living form hand to mouth . How could they ? 
 Fortunately , things are changing these years . 
 Which train do you like ? 
 May I have your name ? 
 How will you ship the order ? 
 But the freight cost will be higher and that will affect the retail price . 
 sure , but I don't drink much . So I don't know what to order . 
 it sounds good . I'd like to start with a Compare . 
 stirred will be fine . 
 thanks . Does the bar have a signature drink ? 
 can you recommend one ? 
 it sounds interesting . I'll take one . 
 it tastes great . 
 yeah . 
 I know that . 
 Me too . I want to know more about you , eg , what's your real name and what do you look like ... 
 Look , I am playing the piano for you . 
 Sorry , I have no photo in my computer . And I have no scanner . I will show you later . 
 Ha ! She is too little . 
 I want to tell you that I like you 
 Thx . 
 May I have the menu , please ? 
 I'd like to have some local specialties . Would you recommend for me , please ? 
 OK . We'll take it . 
 A fried crisp chicken and an eggplant with chili sauce . 
 Coffee , only black coffee , 
 Yes , there are . What cabin would you like ? 
 It is 150 dollars each . 
 The boat time-table is effective from the first of August till the first of November 
 The ship will stop at New York . 
 It will take 5 days . 
 Do you have any plan to buy a house in this city ? 
 Our monthly salary can not buy one square meter of the house here . 
 More and more people need to buy houses , but the market can not meet the needs , so this caused the bubble in real estate industry . 
 Have you watched the TV series , Humble Abode ? 
 I really , really want a house , even though it is small like a snail house . 
 Yes . This is the first time I've come here . Could you please tell me something about it ? 
 Thank you for telling me about this . What should I do here ? 
 OK . How about after the shower ? 
 That sounds comfortable . 
 Scientists have found a second solar system in the universe . 
 It's just a system like ours , with a star and a number of planets going around it . 
 It's exciting news ! If we find a second solar system , we might find a second earth ! 
 Yes ! Isn't that exciting ? 
 He won the decathlon in the 1976 Olympics , right ? 
 I can think of better things to dream about ... 
 That's crazy . 
 You are kidding ! He just broke up with Ann . 
 I hope I will meet her soon . 
 A Korean film called Friends , starring Sang Dong-gun . 
 How did you like the movie ? 
 Really ? I can't say I agree . 
 I guess I expected too much from the movie , so I was a bit disappointed . 
 A friend of mine is now in the big house . He was caught red-handed for selling cocaine . 
 He must be regretting about having done the business . 
 How long have you been living in New York ? 
 Where do your parents live ? 
 Do you write or call them very much ? 
 Hello , I was wondering if I could talk with the apartment manager . 
 I was wondering if the apartment on Main Street is still available . 
 Yes , I would love to see the apartment . 
 Yes , I can be there at 6 . 
 Yes , I have a friend who lives in that neighborhood . 
 OK , should I bring anything with me ? 
 Jack , do say good-bye for me to the host . I've got to run . 
 My old man does not allow me to go back later than 11 p . m . Bye ! 
 Hi , Steven . You have finished a wonderful project recently . 
 Don't be proud . You'll gain a lot in the following job . 
 B , talking about salary is not smart . You are a new manager and you'd better learn more professional skills . 
 Okay , You are such a good talker . 
 Well , I'll consider the possibility . By the way , when do I have to open the L / C if I want the goods to be delivered in June . 
 Could you possibly effect shipment more promptly ? 
 Very well , Mr Zhang . I'll not reduce my order . I'll take the full quantity you offer . And I'll arrange for the L / C to be opened in your favor as soon as I get home . 
 Early next month . In the meantime , I should be very pleased if you would get everything ready . I hope that the goods can be dispatched promptly after you get my L / CB 
 Do you play cards ? 
 What's the English for Hongtao , Leitao , Meihua and Fangpian ? 
 I would like to pick a time to look at houses with you . 
 It is easier for me to take off work in the afternoon . 
 Because of work , I can only go look at houses on the weekend . 
 If you could pick me up at home , that would be great . 
 That might be a little too much , but we ’ ll see how it goes . 
 You look pale , you must have poor health . 
 Why not go to see the doctor ? 
 Well , to come straight to the point , could you tell us something about your new price ? 
 That's a high price . 
 I know . But I must say it's still unacceptable . Couldn't you make a discount for me ? You see , we have such a long-term cooperation . And our business could be mutually beneficial . 
 I came here to get a chest X-ray . 
 What comes next ? 
 Should I do anything else ? 
 Is this OK ? 
 How come you are walking away ? 
 Will I be finished then ? 
 Good morning , this is Mary . 
 Hello , Jane ! Is that the Human Resource Department ? 
 I had an interview with your company two weeks ago . I am calling to ask about the interview result . I hope you can give me a positive reply . 
 Thank you ! I am glad to hear that . When would it be convenient for me to start working ? 
 What is the starting salary for me ? 
 I appreciate the offer . I will come on time next Monday . See you then ! 
 Could you tell me the right time , please ? 
 You have to go and fix it . 
 Excuse me . Can you direct me to the toy department , please ? 
 Can you direct me to the elevator ? 
 Thank you . 
 So how was your interview ? 
 Don't worry . You should do fine . You have the experience . 
 Remember , they want someone who works well with people . You've got to show them how easy-going and personable you are . 
 I'll be late because I have waited so long ! 
 I'd better take a taxi . 
 What a police officer ! 
 It ’ s really unimaginable . The police officer screamed at the driver and used bad language , but the driver took it on the chin . 
 Bourbon , please . 
 With iced water , please . 
 Thank you . Now how much do I owe you ? 
 That is OK . Here is 20 dollars and you can keep the change . 
 Ashley , what a great dinner party ! 
 Just water would be fine . 
 Yes , the chicken looks wonderful ! 
 Sure , I love salad ! 
 Yes , I think that rice will go perfectly with my chicken ! 
 I'm in heaven ! A Whirlpool dryer ! 
 This is too good to be true . 
 Yes . We've lived in Taiwan for a while . I had a gas stove in the States , too . 
 We love it . But we'd like to know about the neighbors . 
 Yes , do I have to work a whole year before I can take a vacation ? 
 Only three days ? 
 What happens if I use up my sick days before the end of the year ? If I ’ m sick an extra day or two , will my pay be deducted ? 
 It was the same as the last place I worked at . I was hoping you ’ d be different . 
 Sure . 
 It costs money , dear . What ’ s wrong with the regular television stations ? 
 Well , you already watch too much TV instead of doing your homework , anyway . 
 Well , that ’ s true , but you ’ d probably only watch cartoons and action movies . 
 Well , if everybody jumped off a bridge , would you jump too ? 
 Get new friends . 
 Because you ’ d end up spoiled rotten if I wasn ’ t . 
 Let ’ s see how your grades are this semester , and maybe I ’ ll talk to your father about it . 
 Is there a lot of crime in your city ? 
 It ’ s the same in my city . We also have a lot of drug addicts . A lot of the crime is committed by drug addicts who need money for drugs . 
 Some people believe that a tough approach is better . Other prefer a more lenient approach . 
 That ’ s possible , but I ’ m not sure it would really happen like that . 
 Where are you heading now ? 
 Is that the university next to the Teachers ' College ? 
 You mean we'll share the taxi ? 
 Well.Don ' t worry about it , I will be happy to share the taxi with you . 
 I like playing computer games , but I'm not really into board games . 
 the Rubik's cube is so difficult to solve that I think it should be banned ! 
 how did you figure out how to slove the Rubik's cube ? 
 I had no idea there were a set of instructions . I thought everyone who could solve it were all geniuses ! 
 it's a deal . 
 yeah . That was a strange party . Can you still do any of those yo-yo tricks ? 
 I could never figure out how to use my yo-yo . 
 let's get started with this game then . 
 Let ’ s call it a day . 
 It ’ s hard to commute a long way . 
 Good evening ! I don't believe we've met before . May I introduce myself ? My name is Jack . 
 I'm very happy to meet you . You're from the United States , aren't you ? 
 I've been to Salt Lake City a few times . I really like your city . 
 Here we are , Room 215 . 
 The telephone is by the end . Dial 0 for reception . 
 Yes , here's the menu . You can order from reception . 
 This is your mini bar . It contains alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks and also a few snacks . Anything you use will be added to your bill . The price list is by your bed . 
 Your bags will be here shortly . 
 Me , too . 
 Nothing . 
 I'd love to , but I don't care for skating very much . 
 I like bowling , but I prefer to be along with you . 
 I don't feel like going out tonight , I am way too tired . I miss you , sweetheart . 
 How about the seaside ? 
 Are you busy on the 24th ? 
 Ok . 
 I wasn't quite prepared for the view of the Earth as we left . It was just awe-inspiring . It emerged from just a slightly curved horizon to a whole Earth , where you could look across oceans and continents in a single glance . I wasn't quite prepared for that . It's inevitably etched in my memory . 
 Detached . You're literally detached from one planet , captured by another . Your only link to reality is the Earth out there ; fortunate - 1y , it stays in view the whole time . 
 I believe it's certainly for real . It without question has suffered a lot of delays . But there's hardware sitting on the pad right now and it's due to go off in December . It is a reality . It has just taken longer to get literally off the ground . 
 I hope this flight is not just a one-time affair , that it does re-ignite people's interest to push on . But only time will tell . 
 If I were the man making the decisions , you could get in line tomorrow . I strongly support ordinary people going into space . Unfortunately , I don't think it will be in the near future . 
 Sure . May I take your measurements ? 
 I see , sir . Can you come back for a fitting on the 10th , that's in a week's time ? 
 Well , a business suit usually takes ten days ' time . But in your case , we'll try to have it ready sooner . How about coming for your fitting on the 8th ? Then your suit will be ready for you on the 10th ? 
 Do you know the highest mountain in the world ? 
 Wow ! That must be really awesome to stand on the top of the mountain to overlook the earth . 
 Have people set foot on its peak ? 
 Hey , Robert , that's a nice shirt you are wearing . Where did you get it ? 
 that's nice . Do you know you can get one at the wholesale market near the zoo for a much lower price ? 
 true , learning how to haggle the price is one of the things people have to pick up when they come to China for the first time . 
 yeah , I have the same feeling . Also there is another thing that bothers me the quality . Things in a department store are usually quality-guaranteed . But at a wholesale market , you never know whether w 
 I understand . While it's always good to follow the local customs , I guess there are exceptions . 
 Is that spelt M , A , C or M , C ? 
 How much is a ticket to Edinburgh ? 
 A return ticket , please . 
 Excuse me . Have you got the time ? 
 Does your watch keep good time ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 It's July 5th . 
 I'm leaving on Sunday . We're going to Canada . 
 Yeah I know . 
 About 2 weeks . 
 I'm coming back on the 17th . 
 Well , I've got a date . Now I need to find a restaurant . Can you help me ? 
 Nothing but the best for a pretty woman ! 
 Well , I sort of suggested that we would go out on the town . Do you have another suggestion ? 
 Gramercy Tavern , eh ? I think I've heard of that before . Call to get us a table , okay ? 
 I'm calling today about a bill that I never received . 
 It was for my Master Card . 
 I haven't got it in the mail yet . 
 What am I supposed to do about my bill then ? 
 But if it's their mistake , can I get an extension on my bill payment ? 
 Okay , thank you very much for your help . 
 Whatever we do , we should do it above board . 
 Well , since you agree with me , we should put the issue above board instead of talking about through other channels . 
 Yes , I'd like to buy a new computer , but I don't really know much about them . Can you give me any suggestions ? 
 Laptops are more expensive , right ? 
 I'll just get a regular home computer then . I don't think I'll need to lug my computer around with me . 
 Do you want to buy a new bicycle ? 
 What happened to your old one ? 
 I've been using Jim's old bike but he needs it back . 
 Look at this mountain bike . It is only £ 330 . Do you like it ? 
 How much is it ? 
 OK , let's go and ask . 
 Of course not . 
 Laura . 
 I don ’ t think it ’ s very nice . And my father doesn ’ t like it . But my mother likes it very much . So we often come here . 
 Well , we come here almost every month . 
 It ’ s my mother . She ’ s fond of swimming . And the man beside her is my father . 
 No , I hate swimming . I prefer playing tennis . 
 My bad . I didn't realize that it was so late . 
 Of course not . I really did lose track of time . 
 Yeah , you did . I just forgot to call . 
 That's true . My bad for not calling . 
 You're going to kick me out over this ? 
 Well , if I'm not living here anymore , then I won't have to listen to your rules . 
 No , what ? 
 You're kidding . 
 Oh , I don't believe it . He is only being with the company for two years . 
 Well . Good for him . 
 Sure , what's going on ? 
 Let me see ... The weekend after next looks pretty good.Otherwise , I'm all booked up . 
 It's a hard question , but I'm sure the reexamination of China's economic policies in the past may lead us to a right answer to the question . After the establishment of new China , our government employed numerous economics policies to stimulate the growth of China's economy . These policies , however , favored our domestic enterprises and protected them from international competition and these policies have contributed a lot to the rapid growth of both China economy and our domestic enterprises . After China's entry into TO , Chinese domestic enterprises will have to compete with their foreign counterparts . This new situation entails some changes of Chinese economic policies . These changes will spur Chinese enterprises to strengthen their competitiveness in the long run . 
 Yes , it does . Domestic enterprises of different ownerships enjoy equal rights for the non-discrimination principle grants equal rights to enterprises , regardless of their nationality and ownership . I have found that although changes of China's economic policies are numerous , these changes are largely based on the most important economic principle ot TO agreement-non-discrimination principle . Such an understanding of principle of the changes may help us not only to have a good insight into the changes but also to foresee the tendency of the new changes of China's economic policies . 
 Robert is not available at the moment . 
 Around 3:30 . 
 What are the allowances ? 
 Well , I see . And what about the vacation in our company ? 
 Will our company have some recreational activities ? 
 You ’ re new here , right ? 
 Is this your first semester ? 
 What school did you transfer from ? 
 Do you like it here so far ? 
 Which is better , here or PCC ? 
 Why didn ’ t you just stay at PCC ? 
 How may I help you ? 
 Everything on it ? 
 Would you like fries with that ? 
 Would you like anything to drink ? 
 Will that be all ? 
 Your total comes to $ 5.48 . 
 I have never you mention this friend . Are you on very good terms with him or her ? 
 You must be stuck on her , or you would not use your elbow grease . 
 I think your speech was excellent . 
 Sure it was . 
 But you did it and did it well ! 
 I don ’ t think so , Mr . Parsons . I think you have covered all the main points for me . 
 Great . Rmm , when can I expect to hear from you ? 
 That sounds perfect . Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me Mr . Parsons . 
 I hope to hear from you very soon . 
 you haven't spent much time with Sophia lately . Are you speaking to each other at the moment ? 
 but you two used to do everything together . I thought you really enjoyed each other's company . 
 can't you hang out with them , too ? 
 maybe you should invite her over for dinner , so it's just the two of you . 
 it can't be that bad . She was always a really good friend to you . 
 she's probably just excited about her new job . You should give her some time . It would be a shame to lose such a good friend . 
 I still think you two should try to patch things up . 
 My aunt told me one of her secrets--cellophane tape . 
 Let me know how it works . 
 I know what you mean . I'm like a yo-yo . 
 Hello , Mr . Compton ? This is Susan Miller . 
 I ’ d like to take tomorrow off if that ’ s all right with you . 
 Great party , isn ’ t it ? 
 By the way , my name is Liu Wei . 
 What do you do , Susan ? 
 I work for the Bank of China , in the International Section . 
 It is true . I think we should change some policies . 
 Indeed , it's unfair . Households with higher salaries receive larger LPF contributions and thus qualify for larger loans . Lower-income households , on the other hand , can only get smaller loans , or perhaps nothing if they could not afford to purchase any housing . 
 This is the rush hour . 
 Let ’ s drive off this road . 
 Are you going to vote ? 
 I plan to , but what day is the election ? 
 Can you just tell me ? 
 Are you serious ? 
 It ’ s a good thing I asked you . 
 I couldn ’ t remember . 
 I just love your hair that way . 
 Where did you have it done ? 
 Just yesterday . I'm still getting used to it . 
 Thanks . 
 It was nice to have you with us . 
 Not at all . It was a pleasure . Perhaps you will come out with us again while you are here . 
 Goodbye . 
 Yes , but I think I'll have orange juice first . 
 Well , I think I'll try the pancakes . How about you ? 
 Lily ! Why aren't you up and ready for school ? 
 Lily , if you're acting sick just because you want to play hooky ... 
 Oh , that's a nasty cough . Let me feel your head . You're on fire ! 
 Yeah , I think so . Oh , by the way , I need to ask you something . 
 Could I get back the sweater you borrowed ? 
 My boots ? Er ... Sure , ok . 
 Yes . I'd like to make a room reservation . 
 Two weeks from Thursday , for three nights . 
 Right . 
 Robert Hamlin . 
 Double . 
 Could I ask you for a favor ? My laser printer is out of ink and I need to print out something urgent . If you don ’ t mind , I would like to send you these files . Could you then print these for me ? 
 Thanks , Vivian . 
 Cheer ! 
 So what time tomorrow ? 
 Where to meet ? 
 OK . Bottoms up . 
 It's on me . 
 I think we have everything in the contract . Shall we sign it ? 
 I believe we can solve disputes through an amicable negotiation . 
 All right . I agree with you . But where do we hold arbitration ? 
 It sounds reasonable . The clause should be like this - any disputes arising from the execution of this contract shall be settled in a friendly way . If no settlement can be reached through consul - nation and conciliation , the disputes shall be submitted for arbitration by a mutually nominated arbitrator . The arbitrator's decision on the dispute is final and binding on the both parties . 
 What day is today ? 
 Tomorrow is Friday . It's going to be the weekend . 
 We'll meet again in a few days . 
 Yesterday morning was beautiful i thought the sunning was going to continue . 
 I know . i could not believe it when i got hit by that storm.it was pouring with rain all afternoon . 
 If it was sunning all year round there would be drought.you probably would not like it either . 
 The weather forecasters are not good at predicting the weather would be like.our weather is so changeable . 
 That would be nice . How are you getting there ? 
 Oh , I much prefer to go by car , then we don't need to get to the station with our luggage and ... 
 Which is more expensive ? 
 Now , have you ever thought of going by express bus ? 
 Hello , is that Miss Smith ? 
 This is Mr.Gao . How are you ? 
 Fine . Listen . Are you free on Wednesday night ? I'd like to invite you to dinner . 
 That's a pity . How about Thursday ? 
 Great . What time would you like to meet ? 
 OK , let's say 6 
 I can pick you up at the gate of your company . Also , what type of food do you like ? 
 Well , have you heard of Peking Duck ? it's a local specialty . 
 OK , let's have that then . 
 See you later , goodbye . 
 Really ? That's really wonderful . I'm so happy for her . 
 Honey , cheer up . 
 I'm sure you'll do fine if you try your best . 
 Be confident , and never give up . 
 Keep your chin up . Remember ? Nothing is impossible to a willing heart . 
 I have had some really horrible headaches lately . 
 I get headaches occasionally , but they have been really bad lately . 
 I am getting ready to take my GRE . 
 It has been hard for me to sleep with a bad headache . 
 I hit my head on a cupboard door a week ago . 
 How do you do ? 
 My name is Wang Liang , I ’ m from Beijing . Where do you come from ? 
 You're from Tangshan ? I can't believe my ears . I was also born in Tangshan , but I was brought up in Beijing . 
 Just over 4 years now . Since this is your first day here , I'm sure you don't really know too much yet . Let me show you around , so you can introduce yourself to everyone . 
 Hello . Can I speak to Kevin , please ? 
 My name is Joan Harris . I ’ m calling from St . Johns Hospital . Are you still interested in a job as a service technician ? 
 I have good news for you.You ’ Ve got an interview . Can you come to the Human Resources Office on Thursday at 9 30 am ? 
 345 Stony Creek Avenue . 
 Excellent . I ’ ll see you on Thursday at 9 30 . 
 Is that true ? I can't believe it . There are always some meetings in this company . 
 But , my overwork has not done yet . And it is driving me crazy . 
 What's the meeting for ? 
 I will be there after 20 minutes . 
 Thank you . I was operated on for gastric ulcer . 
 Yes . I hope so . 
 You already ate . 
 There's nothing left from dinner . 
 What kind of snack are you going to make ? 
 You can always make a sandwich . 
 Just make yourself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich . 
 Go right ahead . 
 I went shopping . 
 Yes , I bought a few things . 
 I bought this coat . Do you like it ? 
 At the mall on 5th street . 
 No , it wasn't expensive . It was on sale for 20 dollars . 
 I know . It was a really good deal . 
 Hello , Room Reservation Service . May I help you ? 
 Let me see . Yeah , There are two such rooms left . May I have your name please ? 
 OK . I've got it . 
 Good-bye . 
 I love going out into the countryside for walks or bike ride . I love being out in the fresh summer air . How about you ? 
 What do you do in winter ? 
 I think most people do . I like wearing nice , colorful clothes in summer-you know , a nice dress or skirt . It ’ s too cold for those kinds of clothes in winter . 
 Do you think we ’ ll have a nice summer this year ? 
 Hey , check out this new game I bought today . 
 I know you love the Oscars . This game has some great questions about all types of movies . 
 Yes . In fact , one of the categories is on foreign language films . 
 No , I haven't , but I've seen several interesting advertisements in the paper . 
 Either something in the hotel business or something to do with travel . 
 I know . But I'd like to try . Look , here are some advertisements that I've cut out . 
 I have been a salesman . 
 I am in charge of the trading department . 
 I ’ m working in a small company where further promotion is impossible . 
 I never easily give up something that is valuable . Before I decided to quit that position , I had made a thorough analysis of things like what I would gain and what I would lose here in your company . You know , Shanghai is always a fascinating place to me , full of challenges as well as hopes . In addition to this , I have the specialized knowledge and the necessary experience of making a good . Of course , opportunities to work abroad and a higher salary are also important to me . So I believe it ’ s worthwhile to come here to work . 
 I'm very much interested in the position . 
 I believe I would have better opportunities with a small but rapidly expanding company like yours . 
 Shih ! ! Please keep your voice down . There are people reading and studying here . 
 Yes I am . You can check our online catalog to search the book you want based on the genre , title or if you know the author , I can point you towards the right direction . 
 That would be in our children's section . That book shelf there on the right . 
 Do you have a library card ? 
 I just need to see your drivers license or utility bill to prove that you a resident of this state . 
 So you are all set . You can have these books for two weeks . If you need to have them longer , you can bring them here to renew them . If you don't , you get charged ten cents a day for each book . 
 Hi , Kate . 
 Yeah , I saw someone walking like you , but I wasn ’ t sure . We haven ’ t seen each other for how long ? Almost three months ? But you look quite different now . 
 Oh , you look quite slender and more vivacious . What have you been taking ? Are you on a diet ? 
 Wow ! That ’ s great . I sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals , but it ’ s difficult for me to keep up the exercise . Also you know , old habits are hard to break . 
 Dance ? You only go dancing ? That ’ s not hard . I can do that . 
 Excuse me . Have you forgotten our drinks ? 
 Why is it taking so long ? 
 There is something wrong with this dish . 
 I don't think this is fresh . 
 Would you please ask the manager to come over ? 
 What did she say ? 
 What's your plan ? 
 Right , then you'd better send an E-mail to tell her . 
 I went to the tutoring service centre on campus today . And I got a job . 
 They got me a part-time tutoring job , teaching an Australian businessman Chinese . 
 It's very simple actually . You can go to the service centre and have your name and job interest resisted . They will give you a call if any job comes up . 
 We're having a sixties party next week . Do you want to come ? 
 You come dressed in anything from the sixties . 
 Check out your mom's closet . I'll bet she still has something . 
 That will be great ! Do you have LPs or Cds ? 
 Good morning , welcome to Bank of the USA . How may I help you today ? 
 Okay , have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ? 
 It ’ s alright , I will take you through the procedure . Are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account ? 
 Okay , I ’ ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank ’ s address and phone number . 
 Well . You ’ Ve come prepared.You have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now . It ’ s a simple transaction , and we can process it today . 
 It ’ s my pleasure . 
 We design and assemble a wide range of electric generators for hospitals , hotels anc small factories . We specialise in medium-sized generators but we're hoping to diversify into larger models next year . 
 We export to Eastern Europe and the Far East . The domestic market accounts for about 40 percent of our total sales . 
 I do . Why , do you want me to change the channel ? 
 I think they have pretty good programmes . But I'll change it if you really want . 
 Oh , I hate Channel 5 . I'd rather just listen to the radio . 
 What's on today ? 
 Really ? I'm interested in it . 
 You are from the travel agency , aren't you ? 
 Yes , I am . Are you Miss Li from the travel agency ? 
 Do you mind telling me your name ? 
 Yes , it is . I usually travel light . 
 Sure , and I'm glad to meet you . Thanks for your help . 
 Don't worry about it , Lin.That ' s no big deal.You know , Americans appreciate China's rich culinary culture . Just excuse me for a second while I check the number here and figure out how much to give the waiter.Hmm , by the way , what do you do about tipping in China ? 
 No tipping ? Now that's what I call a civilized system . 
 What about cab drivers and porters ? 
 You'd have a revolution on your hands if you tried to introduce that sort of system here . 
 Yes . In fact there are quite a large number of people who have no food to eat and no place to live in . 
 Hey Mike . What are you doing tonight ? 
 Work is kicking my ass . I'm so stressed . Let's go grab a drink . 
 I say we get drunk tonight . I don't want to think about all this stuff . 
 We won't stay out too late . I just need to forget about work . 
 What's the matter , John ? you seemed to be restless today . 
 Oh , that's easy . If it's better than the one you are doing now , go for it . That's my advice . 
 Then what about the salary ? Would you get more ? 
 Have you discussed it with your wife ? 
 As I say it the work is well worth try . After all you can get a higher salary . 
 Welcome to China , Mr . White . 
 Welcome to this corporation , Mr . White . Won ’ t you please sit down ? 
 Our representative in your country faxed a letter that you showed an interest in some of our products on display at the Oct . Exhibition there . Now we'd like to know if you have any specific requirements in mind . 
 Good . Well , Mr . White , most of the items listed are available this year . I hope we can come to an agreement and sign the contracts soon to enable timely delivery . 
 Here are our catalog and price list . The catalog lists all the commodities we export , and the price list gives indicative prices for all our export articles . 
 We normally export CFR . 
 That can be discussed . 
 What about tomorrow morning at 9 ? I'll come over to your hotel . 
 Julia , what time is it ? 
 Oh , my God ! I'm going to be late ! I have no time to have breakfast now . ( Hurry on his clothes . ) 
 Oh , I have a poor memory now . I haven't had enough sleep lately . I had a bad dream just now . 
 Yes . I really need to have a good rest . 
 I am just casting pearls before swine . 
 There's no power . 
 Yes , the fuse had blown and I've changed it but now the motor keeps cutting out . 
 If this coat doesn't fit , may I bring it back later ? 
 Do you know what E-commerce is ? 
 That's right 
 Sure , but you must have access to the Internet . 
 I saw him last week . It seems he was a bit queer in the head . 
 What a pity ! 
 They asked me to go to Paris to check on the new office that was just established there . And you ? 
 Teach me Cantonese and I'll pull some strings to get a trade with you next time around . 
 You're on . 
 I'm scheduled to fly out on the tenth . 
 When do you plan to travel ? 
 Are you aware that without two weeks advance notice prices will be very high ? 
 I understand . So that ’ s one ticket to New York , and you ’ ll be departing tonight . Will that be one-way or round trip ? 
 When would you like to return ? 
 OK . I have several seats available . Would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ? 
 OK Mr . Lee . I have you booked on flight 513 leaving on the 5th at 11:00 pm and arriving in New York on the 6th at 6 
 No , all flights are direct . 
 $ 800 dollars . 
 Why don't you ask your husband to help you with it ? 
 There's a concert in Capital Theatre this Sunday . 
 Look , I have two tickets.Will you go with me ? 
 Hello . Is this Ann ? 
 Yes , it's me . 
 No . Worse than that . I have a flu . I'm in bed with a fever . 
 I'd like to do it , of course . But I just can't . I'm afraid I'd fall down in the middle of it . 
 Why not just tell him I'm sick ? I'll ring him myself this afternoon . 
 Not yet . I feel too lousy to go out.Anyway , I have a flu . I know what it is . I don't need a doctor to tell me that . 
 I'm not sure yet.Maybe this will all be gone in a day . So it's probably better if you don't call off my appointments . I will call you later this afternoon and tell you what I think . 
 Yes , that's what I plan to do . Except I won't make the chicken soup.Right now I don't think I could swallow more than a spoonful of it . 
 Yeah , I'm very nauseous . It's mostly nausea and a fever . 
 Thanks , Ann . Talk to you this afternoon . 
 Grandpa , this seat is for you , for you are the eldest person here and also it's your birthday today . 
 I'm afraid I can't do that . It's Dad's seat , according to the book about table manners . 
 Great . That's my favorite seat which will be the nearest to the birthday cake . 
 Why do they serve up the noodles first ? I don't like it . Where is the cake ? 
 I see . Then I'll try it . 
 Oh , I feel ok but I ’ m still very tired . 
 I think so . One minute I feel quite awake , and the next I feel very tired . 
 Oh yes , I'm very interested in Chinese history so I ’ d like to visit the Summer Palace . 
 Did you enjoy your meal ? 
 May I interest you in some dessert ? 
 Well , we have chocolate mousse cake , homemade fresh strawberry shortcake , and a spicy rum apple crisp for our specials . 
 Since there are four of you , would you like to split a second dessert ? 
 Would you like coffee or tea with your dessert ? 
 OK . I will be right back with your desserts and drinks . 
 Please come in and sit down . I ’ m happy to finally meet you . 
 I ’ m sorry I kept you waiting . 
 Thank you . Can I get you some coffee or a cup of tea ? 
 Good , then let ’ s get to the interview . 
 Hi ! Peter . How are you ? 
 Pretty good . 
 my husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . But then we had three parties to celebrate . 
 well , since my husband and I are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . It wasn't actually that expensive . 
 I would have liked them to be there , but they couldn ’ t afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them , so they understood . 
 my husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed t 
 we waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa . 
 not at all , but we don ’ t have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly ! 
 That's the best there is . 
 That'll be $ 200 , sir . 
 Yes , you're right . We have to equip our company with a network of workstations at every office as soon as possible . 
 Good . We can contact the Tiana Office Furniture Store , and ask them to install computers in our company , deliver new tables and other furniture to match the function of the computers , and to improve our work atmosphere simultaneously . 
 I'd like to get some details about a Personal Housing Loan , please . 
 You see , I've just got married and we are looking at getting on the property ladder with our first home . 
 Yes , just a simple apartment , nothing too big . 
 That's great , exactly what I need to know . Thanks . 
 I ’ d like to buy an inexpensive camera . 
 I don ’ t think I ’ ll need a Polaroid.Does this 35mm camera have an automatic flash ? 
 Okay , I ’ ll take this one.Does it come with batteries and a case ? 
 Excuse me . My bag was stolen , will you help me ? 
 Just about half an hour ago . 
 Yes , it was just when I was walking in the park . I saw some children with a newspaper . 
 I want to get in touch with the Chinese Embassy because my passport was in the stolen bag . 
 Let's order something to eat . What are you in the mood for ? 
 OK . How about some spring rolls and squid balls , some pork skins , and some beer ! 
 Hey , Jenny . Would you like to go to dinner with me ? 
 No , I don't . What do they say about office romances ? 
 That's silly . What I do on my own time is no one else ’ s business . Besides , it's pretty hard to meet people outside of the office when we spend long hours here . 
 People fall in love with people they work with . That's a fact . 
 If it does , it will only make you more productive , because we can support each other . 
 Good grief . All I did was ask you out . I am sorry . 
 I am talking about dinner tonight , not a lifetime . 
 I like company . 
 What can I say ? I am a passionate guy . 
 You want to go out with me and you know it . 
 Ok , I get the message . Hey , do you have any sisters ? 
 Not much . 
 Oh really ? I didn't know that . 
 I haven't heard anything about it . 
 What time does it start ? 
 Yeah , I think I'll go . 
 You will . 
 I've never gotten one . Have you ? 
 Really ? What did you get one for ? 
 Why did you do that ? 
 Where did you park at ? 
 Don't you have your own parking spot ? 
 That was very lazy of you . 
 We'd better stay in the hotel , because the tour will begin tomorrow . 
 What an excellent idea ! 
 OK . 
 Yes , some exercise is necessary for us . 
 Your resume mentioned that you had been the surveyor , which was a concurrent job , of a certain market survey company . What was your main work content ? 
 What had you gained mainly from this survey activity ? 
 Hello ! 
 I'm sorry , but I'm afraid you've dialed the wrong number.There is no Stefan here . 
 Yes . I'm sure . You have the wrong number . I have used this number for more than 20 years . 
 No , it isn't . It's 1199866 . It seems that you have misdialed . 
 It doesn't matter . It happens to everyone . 
 That's all right . 
 It's ten after six.We ' re late.But dinner is at six thirty . 
 I'll call the lost and found office . 
 Well , what is your trouble ? 
 Have you any aches and pains ? 
 I'll take your temperature . How long have you been feeling ill ? 
 You have a temperature , but it's nothing serious . It's probably just the flu . I'll give you a prescription . Take this to the chemist's . Take one tablet every four hours . You should stay in bed tom 
 It's this cold weather we're having . 
 I would like to have that new style Gl Joe . 
 Yes and I've written him a letter . 
 Thanks . 
 Actually , I could you some help . Thank you so much . 
 Toronto is really a lovely place to visit . 
 The Old Town , the Distillery Historic District , the Financial District and Underground City , everything is so attractive . 
 I don't think Joe has done such a thing . Don't believe things in haste . 
 Are you free tonight ? 
 Lousy weather , isn't it ? 
 Look at the ice there hanging from the eaves . 
 Do you know what the temperature is today ? 
 It feels like ten degrees below zero at least . I don't mind the cold weather but I do hate it when it gets slippery . 
 That's great . Let's go skating together tomorrow . 
 Well , I was born in Ohio , but I grew up in Texas . 
 In 1978 . I went to college here . 
 Drama . I was an actor for five years after college . 
 Because I needed the money . And because I was good at it . Look ! What do you think ? 
 Good morning , Emma ! A lovely day , isn't it ? 
 It is the best season for a picnic right now . Have you decided the place for your picnic ? 
 What did the whetherman say ? 
 Well , I will think it over . 
 Mike ? How can you trust him to help us ? 
 He is too unpredictable . He says anything that pops into his head . And then he forgets it all . 
 There are not so many people like you . 
 Excuse me , can I order now , please ? 
 I ’ d like the lasagna , please . 
 I ’ ll try the vegetarian , please . 
 Yes , could you give me some ideas ? 
 Fine , it's the thing for me . I will take it . 
 What about ? 
 You have done a lot of traveling . I'll bet you've learned quite a bit . 
 Because you can see the results with the general public ? 
 I would buy that kind of book ! 
 What was the problem ? 
 Things happen ; make sure it doesn't become a habit . 
 All right , please take this message and call this client . 
 Now does everyone understand the diagram on the board ? 
 I will explain it again ; especially for those of you who arrived late . 
 Sorry . I was too worried . 
 Absolutely . By the way , do you sell any traditional Chinese medicine ? 
 I heard Chinese medicine has a better lasting effect in cure . 
 Next , please . Hello , may I help you , sir ? 
 Ok , it comes four dollars twenty cents . 
 Here is your change . Please wait for your receipt of the registered mail . 
 Let me see . En .. just a minute . Here it is . I need your signature on this note . 
 Drop it in the mail box mark out of town . at that corner . 
 You ‘ re welcome . 
 Have you thought about the cost ? 
 I believe it'll be very expensive . 
 Yes , I finished last Friday . 
 Well , yes . I don't mind admitting that I am . I enjoyed school , but I did object to having to go in every day once we've done all our exams . 
 Yes , I intend to go to university.That ' ll be in September.But it all depends on my A level results . 
 Oh , yes . 
 Pleased to see you . Welcome to our company . I hope you have a good day . 
 Sure , come with me . Hello , Michael , this is Steven . He will be part of your team . 
 I ’ Ve been looking forward to meeting you . I am new to the working world and would appreciate your guidance . 
 That's great . 
 All right . 
 I ’ m a firefighter . 
 I ’ m really lucky to do something I really love . 
 I work downtown at station 24.It can get a little crazy sometimes but that ’ s what makes it challenging . 
 Hi Marry , this is Tom . 
 I need to see if we can get together today . 
 It means young girls . That's where you'll find clothes for young girls . 
 You're small , but you're not a child . 
 There's a petite section that you an check out . 
 It has clothes in small sizes for small women . 
 We may be sold out of them . Let me check the back . ( The clerk goes to the storeroom , returning a few minutes later . ) I'm afraid we're out of stock . Would you like a rain check ? 
 Let me get the manager to sign one for you . 
 I got the short end of the stick . 
 Nope ! It's the latest generation of PAD ! You won't believe what it can do . 
 It has a built-in camera unit that takes digital color stills . It also plays MP3 files , which I can save on media cards and then transfer to the hard drive of my computer . 
 This one comes with its own folding keyboard . It has a pre-installed handwriting recognition program . I can use the stylus to write on the screen . 
 Just plug in a peripheral CD or floppy drive and you're ready to go ! 
 All right , Sis ! 
 I really wish Mom and Dad were here with us . 
 Me ? Er , I like hot weather , just like today . 
 I like to watch Barbie sticking her tongue out . 
 By the way , what's your favorite weather ? 
 Look , is that Tom ? 
 Yes , I am . Could I have the bill , please ? 
 Do you accept check ? 
 Well , I'd like to pay by cash . 
 Thanks . 
 I'm so glad I bought this watch ! 
 I think this is the coolest watch I've ever owned . 
 Isn't that a silly question ? You know how much of an athlete I am . 
 Well , surfing , scuba diving ... 
 This is very beautiful . Though I have to confess , I don ’ t know the first thing about farming ! 
 What was that ? 
 And that ? 
 What was that ? 
 Relax , that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable . 
 I'm really glad that you came to see me . 
 I was missing you too . 
 I've actually been busy lately . 
 I've just been working really hard . 
 Tell me what you've been doing . 
 Well whatever , I'm glad you came . 
 Hi , Jim and Wendy . Where're you going ? 
 Hi , Dan . What's new ? 
 I went to Salt Lake City on business . What's up ? 
 How come ? Last time I saw you . You told me it was a good job , and you'd like to take it as a career . That was only one month ago . Why this sudden change ? 
 What are you going to do now ? 
 That's not the way to solve the problem . Did you look in the classified advertisements column ? 
 Listen . I will see what I can do , ok ? You go home and tell Lily about this problem you have now . She is your wife and I am sure she will understand . 
 I wouldn't dare go bungee jumping . 
 I want to keep a pet , but I don't know which one to buy ? 
 Having a dog would probably be too much work for me , then . 
 Actually , I was thinking of something a little more exotic . I don't want a common pet like a dog or a cat . 
 Yeah , are they easy to look after ? 
 Honey , do you have a second ? 
 We need to talk . 
 I ’ Ve been thinking , and well , I think we need to start seeing other people . 
 That ’ s just it , I ’ m not happy anymore , Tim . It ’ s not you , it ’ s me . I know that I can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! You are the type of guythat any woman would kill for ! 
 Tim , you are too good for me . You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . Oh , I could say that I ’ ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . I know I ’ d only hurt you , I know I ’ d only make you cry . 
 I can ’ t , Tim . I hope someday you can find some way to understand I ’ m only doing this for you . I don ’ t really wanna go but , deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do . 
 Here are your keys . I ’ ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . I ’ m sorry , Tim . I wish you all the best , and I hope that one day we can meet again . I ’ ll always love you . Goodbye . 
 You know , next week , we ’ ll hold a football match . Our cheering squad is busy rehearsing the programmes for it 
 Which kind would you like ? We have five different varieties of facials . 
 Well , since it's summer , and I had looked that you had quite a bit sun , I'll recommend our summer special , it's specially suited for individuals with sensitive skin . 
 The facial will start with thorough cleansing . 
 Yes , the reviving mask will promote blood circulation and tighten your skin . You can also choose to get hand or back massage as well . 
 Yes , we also apply a special day cream that protect the skin from the sun and the night cream that moisturize to the skin . 
 Did you watch the old-fashioned wrestling game last night ? 
 You bet . The wrestlers had got sound defences and they simply couldn't make it . 
 Yeah.And I'm going by bus . 
 But both my wife and I prefer taking a bus . 
 Thank you . I couldn ’ t have done it without the help of a strong team . 
 Well , I hope the client feels the same way ! 
 Oh ! 
 To think of it ! All my old silver ! It meant so much to me . 
 What's so terrible too , is the fools we've made of ourselves . 
 I'll never get over it . Oh , Harry , it was all so unnecessary . That man ! ! How could he do this to us after we'd put him up ? 
 Good morning , Madam . How can I be of service ? 
 Yes , I'm sorry about that . One of our Atms is down and we are waiting for it to be repaired , but it should be up and running again very soon . 
 You need to fill out the deposit slip as well . Here you go , Madam . 
 Excuse me , is this where I can catch a bus to the museum ? 
 Thank you . 
 Yes . 
 Yes , I've got some coins . How much is the fare ? 
 I see . How often does this bus run at this time of day ? 
 Hey , Ted . What are you up to this Friday ? 
 That ’ s great ! Do you have any plans ? 
 Sounds nice . 
 Can I stop by ? 
 What date is it today ? 
 Oh , the day after tomorrow is Christmas . 
 Mom , look ! My first piggy bank and it still has money in it ! 
 Remember when I used to beg you to break it so I could go buy ice cream ? 
 Thanks for not giving in to my childhood tantrums , mom . 
 I think I'm going to keep it as a monument to what I've learned about money . 
 Welcome to Game World . What can I do for you ? 
 Sure . This one here just came out . It's got great 3D graphics and a cool story line . It's also got a multiplayer function so you can play against other people on the Internet . 
 This one is also really cool . It's a sci-fi game in which you have to stop an alien invasion . The graphics on this one are spectacular . 
 I need to cancel my reservation . I have personal matters that need fixing . 
 Rudy Randolph , 818-555-1234 , April 9 through 15 . 
 Thank you . I'm glad that wasn't too much of a bother . 
 Mary , do you remember when we met ? 
 And I came up and asked to sit by you ... 
 What sports do you like to play ? 
 How about football ? 
 It's a very popular game in America . 
 For me , it's one of those games that are fun to both watch and play . 
 No , I just for fun with my friends . We play two hand touch or flag football . We're too old to play tackle football . 
 Instead of tackling somebody , you just have to touch them with two hands , or if it is flag football , grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing . 
 Exactly . We play every Saturdays on the field by the tennis courts . If you want to learn and play a little , you're welcome to join us . 
 Ok . I'll call you Saturday morning . 
 Do you like playing tennis ? 
 Maybe you haven't found the magic . 
 Hello . I have a room booked for tonight , the 15th . 
 It ’ s Marcia Gleason . 
 Yes , a single , thanks . 
 Actually , I ’ d prefer not to be . 
 I was thinking about it . Are you ? 
 Really ? Well , what time does it start ? 
 Well , who all is going to be there ? 
 How do you know it's going to be so fun ? 
 Wow , that does sound like it's going to be fun . 
 Yeah , I will be there . 
 I like studying English , and I can read well , but speaking can be difficult . 
 Can I ask you a question ? 
 I have my book from class here . How do you say this word ? 
 Sorry , I don't understand . What does that mean ? 
 Yes , I think so . Can you say it again ? 
 Laptop . Did I pronounce that correctly ? 
 Thanks . And this word ? How do you pronounce this ? 
 Thanks so much . You're a good teacher . 
 Would you mind doing something for me ? 
 Would you please explain the meaning of the word ? 
 Will you sit down , Mr . White ? 
 I propose a toast to your pleasant tour in China . 
 This food is a Wax specialty . Please help yourself . 
 Who has been here already this morning ? 
 They're small fry . Tonight I'm going to LA to negotiate with Stars.com . That'll be big . 
 Who else has been here ? 
 Elvin ? Which one is he ? 
 Hello , I ’ m Mark . I ’ m just wondering if you are free this weekend 
 Good . I was thinking that I ’ d like to invite you to watch a movie . I can meet you at the cinema gate . 
 Six thirty , tonight . 
 All right.Maybe next time I can go with you.Bye ! 
 So , what do you think ? How do you like New York ? 
 Yeah . I really like the stores and the shopping . 
 But the traffic is pretty bad . 
 Listen , it's almost dinnertime.There are lots of restaurant around here.What do you want to try ? Italian ? Greek ? Japanese ? Thai ? 
 OK . Let's go American . Where's the nearest McDonald's ? 
 My daughter . She is missing . I don ’ t know where she is . 
 She has blond hair and blue eyes . 
 She has a yellow dress on and red sneakers . 
 I just saw her down the street . I don ’ t know where she is . 
 Oh , it ’ s been uh ... fifteen minutes . 
 Sorry , darling , I forgot . 
 I promise you'll have it tomorrow . 
 I'm looking for a pair of shoes . 
 I wear size 36 . This pair looks nice . Can I try them on ? 
 How much are they ? 
 I'll take them . 
 Give them a buzz ? What can I say to them ? Say that you want a loan ? 
 And they , too , want to make sure their loan is worthwhile . 
 You ’ re leaving so soon . When are you off ? 
 How about I come and see you off ? 
 Ok . I ’ ll miss you . I hope we can see each other again soon . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Ok . Take care . I hope you have a good journey . 
 Of course . I will . 
 Look ! That man who is baking bread is so handsome . 
 Oh , my god ! He ’ s so perfect . 
 I'd love to , the movies are smash hit . 
 I can't . I'm waiting for Paul , but he's late . 
 I know . I wonder what's keeping him . 
 Yeah , a number of times . 
 I don't know . But this is definitely the last straw . 
 You said it . Ok , let's go in , Sandy . 
 No , Mum , I'd rather stay inside . 
 I prefer staying at home and watching TV . 
 Yes , but a football game is next . 
 I just enjoy watching games . 
 Er ... Alison ? 
 I just wanted to congratulate you ! I mean , it was a good race and you deserve to win . 
 It was that final sprint ! You were great ! Really ! 
 What will happen to the children if you break up ? 
 Why don't you make up with John . 
 He has a long head , I bet he will do well in his business . 
 When we were students , he was no good in any subject . 
 Drop me at the Manhattan Post Office . 
 Oh , I'm visiting a friend there . 
 Excuse me , Miss , can you tell me where the bank is ? 
 How long will it take me to get there ? 
 I see.Thank you . 
 Good afternoon . Lotus Catering Company . Lilian speaking . May I help you ? 
 I see , Mr . Baker . How many people are you planning to invite and how much would you like to spend per person ? 
 Was there an accident on the freeway today ? 
 No , don't you know what happened ? 
 Are you serious ? 
 Did anyone get hurt ? 
 Are they going to be okay ? 
 Well , that's a miracle that no one was killed . 
 I'm famished ! Let's get some grub ! 
 Me , too ! The chips here are so light and crispy . 
 I'll go get the chips . What do you want to drink ? 
 Hi , Mr . Smith . what's new ? 
 What's the matter ? 
 Go ahead . It's nothing serious . We are good friends , aren't we ? 
 I'd like to check out . 
 No . I'd like to do that now . 
 Steven , have you ever met Hanson ever since he went back to London ? 
 What's the way you keep in contact ? 
 Email is not always the best form . I think QQ is way better . 
 You're right . 
 Why don't we go shopping ? 
 Let's go to Julian Store . 
 No , I haven't . 
 Describe her to me . 
 Well , how tall is she ? 
 What does she look like , though ? 
 I may know which girl you're talking about . 
 Yes , I have . 
 Come on , you think about what to wear almost every day . There are thousands of clothes in your wardrobe . 
 I have and I can prove that is 100 % true for you . 
 No kidding ! Again ? ! You just went shopping yesterday . You really are a shopaholic . 
 OK . Do you have the receipt with you ? I think they will ask you to show them the receipt first . 
 Actually , I don't think I can eat another bite ! 
 Actually , I think we want to pay our bill . 
 Excuse me.May I see the manager of your store ? 
 Oh , great , I saw a job ad outside your store . I am interested in the job advertised . I am coming to see if there is any opportunity available for me . 
 I can do the work of shop assistant and I worked part time in a small department store during my summer vocation last year . 
 At present , both are OK for me.What do you need most , then ? 
 I think I can . I have been learning English for almost 5 years and especially I am fluent at speaking English.Also , I have made some foreigners friends during the experience of learning English . 
 It quite suits me . I am free in the evening these days , I will have no difficulty starting at five pm . 
 It seems reasonable.By the way , I can get my earning raised with a excellent performance , can't I ? 
 I see . I will try my best to do the job well . 
 How about next monday ? 
 Thank you for your kindness , ma'am . See you next Monday . 
 Hmm . That's not too bad . Does it have a stopwatch ? 
 Oh . I see . Where are your digital watches ? 
 I don't like this kind as much . Never mind the stopwatch then . I'll take that other one . Do you take checks ? 
 Here you are . 
 Are there any beds vacant ? 
 I prefer one facing the sea . Besides , it should have a shower . 
 Well , that's fine . 
 Yeah , clearly blue sky.But it is a bit too hot for me . I don't like heat and humidity . 
 That's a thought . It's still early , and the beach isn't crowded at this time of the day . If we don't stay too long , we won't get sunburned . 
 There won't be anyone there to appreciate how cute you are . 
 If you are going to husband hunting in a bikini , then I want to wear one , too . 
 Thanks , how about the green and black one ? 
 do you need a hand ? 
 are you sure you don't need any help ? 
 I swear , the overhead compartments on these planes just keep getting smaller and smaller ! 
 yes . What about you ? 
 oh , I guess I'll let you through then . 
 that's alright . I notice you have a few newspapers there . Would you mind lending me one ? 
 I prefer the British paper , but I'll read whatever one you aren't going to read right away . 
 thanks a lot . That's really nice of you . Would you like a piece of gum ? 
 Good afternoon , CCL press.Jennisse speaking , How can I help you ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry . Mr.Li is in a meeting right now . Can I take a message ? 
 Nigel Smith . Does he have your number , Mr . Smith ? 
 2781703 1 . Sure . I'll make sure he gets the message . 
 I see there are some workmen on the site . When is the building work due to start ? 
 How long will the sub contractors be on site ? 
 I'm sure it will . So , we should be able to start moving the machinery in during week 34 . I'll confirm that date with our suppliers . 
 Nothing really , you ? 
 Is that right ? 
 I'm sorry , I can't . 
 I don't really want to . 
 I hate going to parties . 
 Yeah , sorry . 
 I'd like a hamburger with lettuce and tomato . 
 A Coke , please . 
 When can we expect you and your daughter for dinner ? Next Saturday ? 
 How about Sunday then ? 
 Does 6 thirty suit you ? 
 Thanks , goodbye . 
 Nowadays , they offer so many services , you hardly know which one to choose . Take mailing for example . Do you send something first class or second class or do you use EMS ? 
 You can buy things at post office that were never sold there before . You can buy sweets and chocolates , newspapers , birthday and Christmas cards ... 
 My son likes going to the main post office . They have a philately counter where he can buy stamps for his collection . 
 I think it ’ s better for some things , like sending and receiving money , but if you need to post something it sometimes takes longer than it used to . 
 Where to , madam ? 
 I think you'll make it if we don't get stuck in a traffic jam . 
 Thank you . How much is the fare ? 
 Here you are . Keep the change . 
 By the way , could you tell me what day it is today ? 
 And the date , please . 
 How old are you , Su ? 
 I see , you have seven candles on the cake . 
 We will have a party here , right ? 
 Zina , can I talk to you about something personal ? 
 My boyfriend says I work too much . That I spend more time with you than with him . 
 He said not to bother coming back . And I said , fine , I won't . 
 How much do you have budgeted for our trip to Las Angeles ? 
 Yes , I want to know exactly where the money is going . Give me a detailed report . 
 Weren ’ t you able to find anything less expensive ? We're sharing rooms , right ? 
 So far we have $ 2,800 , what else ? 
 Well , that's only $ 4000 . Didn't you tell me your budget was $ 5000 ? Where is the rest of the money ? 
 What should I do if I notice a fire ? 
 Should I try to put the fire out ? 
 Excuse me.In this museum , you are not supposed to take pictures . 
 Will you give me your camera ? We have to confiscate your film . 
 We keep it and return it later . 
 You can buy them at a souvenir shop near the exit . 
 Tom , the new sales representative ? Nice to meet you ! I'm Melinda . 
 Now let me show you around . This is our reception area , and our conference room is right over there . Over there is the sales department . 
 Yeah ... You can make photocopies and send faxes over there . 
 I tell you what just between you and me , we just mess things up so that it looks like we work hard.Just kidding . Oh , your cubicle is over the . And this way . Those are all private offices--the managers ' offices . 
 Sure thing . 
 Not a bad idea ! 
 Well , let's see . I'd like to go to the Summer Palace . 
 I need help figuring out how to use this phone . 
 Yes , I hear the tone . 
 Yes , it changed . 
 I am trying to call home . 
 Yes , I have a list of extensions . 
 I'm afraid we can't increase salary this year , money is just too title . 
 Why not ? 
 What are you talking about , we tried everything ! 
 Yes , it would be my first trip overseas . Actually , it's going to be my first time leaving the country . 
 No , I have never vacationed anywhere exotic . But even if I don't get a chance to travel on my personal time , at least I can travel on company time ! 
 Yes , it wasn't too hard to get . All I had to do was fill out the paperwork and pay the application fee . 
 My flight departs at 7 am . I have everything except for my luggage ready . 
 That would be great ! Thanks a lot ! 
 Not at all . 
 You're welcome . 
 I am reading a book about money management . 
 Everyone wants to earn a lot of money . Don't you think so ? What's more , I am interested in money management . 
 Oh , I see . But a proverb says " Money makes the mare go . " I think it will be better if you have more money . 
 Thank you for your caring . I will . 
 I haven't seen this machine before . What's it used for ? 
 What do you charge for the sports shoes ? 
 Well , that's a bit stiff . Do you have some cheaper ones ? 
 Excuse me , how long is the flight to Phoenix ? 
 Is that Phoenix time ? 
 I can't find my glasses and I can't see anything . Can you help me find a few things ? 
 My laptop , do you see it ? 
 Where's my book ? 
 The dictionary . 
 Where's my pencil ? 
 That's not a pencil . That's a pen . 
 How about my backpack ? Do you know where that is ? 
 Where are my shoes ? 
 I don't see them . 
 Thanks . 
 How do Mark and Jones compare , in your opinion ? 
 May I venture to ask if you've decided to employ Mark ? 
 Can I borrow this magazine from you ? It's really interesting and I can't put it down . 
 That would be very kind of you . By the way , is it a monthly magazine ? 
 May I help you ? 
 I'm afraid you can't . 
 It's 100 % cotton . 
 It's already reduced 20 % . 
 Yes . Please come this way . 
 What are you basing this information on ? 
 Yes , I will.We are very happy with your performance and want to continue our woodworking relationship . 
 Let me take this up with the Director and get back to you immediately . 
 Sure , what's up ? 
 Really ? Why ? 
 But they wouldn't lay you off ! You are the most experienced project manager in the company . 
 Oh that's great , congratulations ! What's your new position ? 
 Sounds a great opportunity . I bet that made the decision to leave a lot easier . 
 Sure . 
 Of course . Let me check it . Firstly , don't be frustrated about all the buttons on it . 
 After overcoming these buttons , you should check whether there is any paper in the machine , you must make sure this . 
 And then prepare what you want to receive . If you want to send a photograph , you must copy one . 
 The next thing you should do is to wait . The sender will give you the fax . 
 Maybe we should call its after-service man . 
 Hi Amy . What's up ? 
 No , sorry . I don't know . 
 Sure , it's over there . 
 Across the street . 
 No problem . 
 Yes , there's one here . It's in the store . 
 Bye . 
 Hello , my old friend . Long time no see . How are you doing ? 
 Not so well . To be honest with you , I broke up with Tom . 
 I think modern painting means nothing . 
 Then why are so many crazy about it 
 Maybe . 
 I know I'm late . I'm sorry . I tried to call you to tell you , but your phone seems to be disconnected . 
 Yes . An automatic message says your phone is not in service . 
 So I couldn't get through . I knew I'd be late because my car wouldn't start.It was too cold I had to warm it up in the garage with a heater . That's why I'm late . 
 About what ? 
 Well , the only thing you can do is tell the phone company and hope they fix it fast . 
 No . I hate cell phones.But you could go to a neighbor's house and use their phone . 
 Yes , of course I can drive you.So you don't want to get your phone fixed right away ? 
 Alright , let's go . 
 Why didn't you sign the contract ? 
 May I help you with something ? 
 I ’ ll take them . 
 These books were due two weeks ago .

 Thank you very much . 
 Bob and Mary are back together . 
 Me too , they're such a nice couple . 
 This job is more challenging and I have longed to be a translator . That ’ s why I came here for an interview . 
 I think one needs common knowledge , specific knowledge , and professional codes to be a successful translator . 
 I work at a hospital . 
 No , I'm a nurse . 
 Very well . 
 I need to make a transfer . 
 I want to transfer money from my savings account .

 I'm sorry , I didn't mean to forget our wedding anniversary . 
 I know , I'm sorry . 
 I'm in favor of Maggie . 
 That's right , Nigel . I think we can keep cost down . 
 excuse me , is this the way to the Greta Wall ? 
 I must have taken a wrong turn . 
 and then ? 
 thanks a lot . 
 by the way , how long does it take ? 
 I heard the Great Wall closes early in the afternoon . Do you think I can make it before closing ? 
 great ! Thank you ! 
 Are you a goal-oriented person ? 
 Where do you want to be in 5 years ? 
 That sounds very reasonable . 
 If you are hired , how long do you plan to stay with us ? 
 Tell me about some of your recent goals and what you do to achieve them . 
 What is your long-range objective ? 
 What do you think is the most important thing when looking for a job ? 
 Darling , the airplane is going to take off . I have to go . 
 Do I have to take these books here if I want to renew them ? 
 That's so convenient . 
 Dinner ? Where ? 
 What kind of food do they serve ? 
 Oh really ! That sounds lovely . 
 Oh no ! Evaluations ! You can tell that's not my favorite job ; I haven't even started yet . When is the deadline for turning in thecompleted forms ? 
 I never know how to rate the employees ' work . Of course attendance and productivity are easy , I just look at the sales figures . 
 Exactly ! Attitude ... how do you rate attitude ? 
 Great idea . And after all , that's the whole point of an evaluation . I almost can't wait to give it a try . 
 Yes , please . 70,000 US dollars is being transferred into our account . 
 I'm the accountant with Go Thong Computers . 
 No problem . Can I withdraw all of it now ? 
 Excuse me , do you have A tale of Two Cities ? I'd like a copy of it . 
 Charles Dickens . 
 Ok , Thanks . 
 I accidentally knocked it off the table and it broke . I'm really sorry .

 $ 308 a night ? That's a fair price . 
 Nonsmoking , please . 
 I have absolutely no problem with that . 
 Not a problem . The number is 626-555-1739 . 
 It sounds like Bob's getting out of bed . 
 It was after 2 am . 
 let's go swimming . 
 I know , but I'm really hot . 
 Good Lord ! Look at that man . 
 He's swimming in the cold sea . He must be very strong .

 That's $ 400 and we will visit 4 cities . 
 Sorry , I can ’ t ! I have to go to work , pick up Jake and Maddie from school , and make them an afternoon snack , then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class . 
 Oh , I don ’ t know ... it ’ s hard to find the right nanny . You have to consider her previous work experience , the responsibilities you give her , and how she interacts with the kids . I would love to have 
 Oh , that ’ s great . Thanks Grace . Can you give me her number ? I ’ ll talk it over with Dan and give her a call tomorrow . Maybe this way I won ’ t be so tired every day , and Dan and I might even get to go 
 I ’ m going to England by flight BE987 . 
 10:00 AM . When am I supposed to check in ? 
 Here you are . 
 Yes . 
 all right . 
 How much must I pay ? 
 Here you are . 
 Thanks . 
 I ’ m a little nervous . I ’ Ve never flown before . 
 Get up , you lazybones ! 
 Has your company been affected much by government legislation ? 
 What about your use of raw materials ? 
 What happens if you exceed the limits ? 
 I'm glad we came here . This is really delicious ! 
 Well , it's true I've never driven two hours just to get lunch.But really , I think it's worth it . 
 How do you mean " suffer " ? 
 Even in the winter ? 
 And even if it takes two hours , huh ? 
 Well , this really is delicious , I have to admit . I can understand better now why you and your friends are always whining . 
 I know . I can see that . This is what is called " dim sum , " right ? 
 So when you Chinese think of Chinatown , you mostly think of food . Is that right ? 
 And maybe we can go to a good Italian restaurant for dinner , after the museum.Chicago has some great Italian restaurants . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Alright , alright . I am happy to try more Chinese food.Will it be dim sum again ? 
 Taiwanese style ? Isn't dim sum Taiwanese style ? 
 I wonder if you can cook things this good . 
 Hi , you said that you might need some help with preparing dinner.What would you like me to do ? 
 Ok , I ’ ll peel the vegetables and you chop them . I ’ m terrible at chopping vegetables . I always seem to chop them into pieces that are either too big or too small.Wow , you can chop vegetables really quickly 
 Which spices are you going to add to the meat ? 
 Yes , we don ’ t want everyone to burn their mouths and have a drink gallons.of water.Ok , I ’ m really to do the meat.Should I cook it over a low flame ? 
 Right.What are you doing over there ? 
 Mom , am I like a superman ? All I need is a cape . 
 Mom , you always think of me as a child . 
 Sure ! 
 Superman is not afraid of any danger . 
 What ? 
 Don't play on the street or make any noise . 
 Dear Mom , please permit of superman's naughty . 
 Well , let me see ... Do you work at IBM Corporation ? 
 Now I remember . We met at a conference in Tokyo last year . 
 I don't know . I'm too excited to say a word . 
 Yes , too good to be true . 
 Anne ! I haven't seen you for ages.How ' Ve you been ? 
 Not bad.It really is great to see you again.Where have you been ? 
 Is that your phone ? 
 it's very impressive . Can you use the Internet on your phone ? 
 that's really convenient . Does it have the Bluetooth ? 
 no , but I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go . 
 does it have a camera ? 
 I guess so . Would you mind if I checked my email quickly ? I'm supposed to be getting an important email this evening from a client . 
 have you checked your voicemail recently ? 
 I think this icon means that you have a voicemail message . 
 do you want to listen to your messages first ? 
 I'm surprised you don't use more of the features on your phone . 
 it quit working last week and I haven't had a chance to buy a new one yet . 
 it's not that bad . It kind of feels like I'm on vacation , not having to answer my phone all the time ! 
 Hi , Bill . 
 Where is that cool guy , Dick ? I haven ’ t seen him for two weeks . 
 Bummer , I ’ m sorry to hear that , is he better now ? 
 Honey , I need to have a talk with you . 
 No , honey , why didn't you go to cram school last night ? 
 Honey , if you don't want to go to cram school , you should tell me the reason why . 
 I have two finals this week and one oral presentation and I'm not ready for any of them ! 
 I hate this part of school . 
 I didn't mean to . Things just kept taking up all of my time . 
 I think I'd better . I have twenty four credits this time around . That might be a bit much . 
 Do you plan on voting this Tuesday ? 
 I already voted . 
 I had to mail in an absentee ballot . 
 I ’ m not going to be able to vote this Tuesday . 
 I have to work this Tuesday . 
 That same morning I have some business to take care of . 
 I am not sure what to do to get ready for my job interview . 
 No , I probably need to do some more research . 
 I think that their attitude is rather casual . 
 I have absolutely nothing so far . 
 Yes , where should we go from here ? 
 Are you here about your ticket ? 
 What is your argument ? 
 You must've been speeding . 
 Tell me how many miles per hour you were going . 
 That's fine , so I'll let you go with a warning . 
 You won't have to pay the fine . 
 I am in hot water now , all the things seem to be blown up . 
 Thank you for encouraging me . There are problems cropping up here and there . But I will over come them one by one . 
 There are parades in many cities and people fly the national flags from almost every public building . 
 The parades are usually military ones , but sometimes there are procession of people carrying flags and singing patriotic songs . What do you do on national day in your country ? 
 Really ? That ’ s unusual . 
 Actually , even though we have parades , most people just use the national day holiday to visit family or go shopping . In the evening , many people watch special TV shows which celebrate national day . 
 It's us . 
 Well , we used to talk to each other before we were married . Remember ? 
 Oh , yes , but we used to do so much together . 
 Back to live with my parents . That's something else I used to do before we were married . Remember ? 
 OK ! How about Scrabble ? 
 OK ! 
 Our cousin Pete ! My turn ! She has a pointy nose , sunken eyes and a mole on her chin ! 
 Your future husband ! 
 Has Robert ever missed coming to one of our parties ? 
 Do you know why ? 
 Hello , ladies . I'm firing up the grill . We can eat in an hour or so . 
 Yi-jun , we're in the States . Here it's all burgers , steaks , and dogs . 
 You can put stuff on the picnic table . Back to work . The grill is calling me ... 
 I hope the host team loses . 
 According to the papers , the visiting side is a strong team in America . 
 Billy , you are late again . 
 Yes he ' s in his office . 
 Don't take any chances . It'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again . He's already mad at you for last 2 times . Any more and he might fire you . 
 I think he might . You'd better go to his office . 
 Good luck ! 
 I don ’ t mind at all . You can ask me anything . We ’ re friends . 
 I have a scholarship from my government for four years . How about you ? 
 Do you mean that you ’ re self-supporting ? I didn ’ t even know you had a job ! 
 Yeah , I really know the feeling . I can ’ t wait to graduate so I can get a good job and earn my own money . 
 These price wars are disastrous for our bottom line . If they're charging 10 % less than we are , we've got to find a way to lower our price while keeping our profit . 
 We can try to lower our cost of production then . We need a price that we can compete with , something comparable with the competition . 
 How's your new work , Carl ? 
 Good for you . 
 Well , you have to take the bad with the good . 
 Do you think you will ever work at that company again ? 
 Do you have the five dollars I lent you yesterday ? 
 You don't have to go right away . 
 He was once a poor man but now he is a man of means . 
 He didn't make any effort . His aunt died and left him a fortune . 
 it's furnished two bedroom flat in a three-story building on campus . 
 it's not as bad as I thought it would be . The freshmen that live nearby are really loud , especially on the weekends . But , the rent is much cheaper than private housing , so it's worth it . 
 no , but we do have to pay 9 months rent in 6 months , so for the first months we pay 1/2 month's rent each month . 
 no , it's all included . Besides , students don't have to pay council tax , so we're saving quite bit of money by living here . 
 that's the bad thing---the contract ends in June , so we'll have to find a new apartment soon . 
 not yet . I'm hoping we'll be able to find something cheap once all the students leave the city for the summer . 
 How may I help you ? 
 What problem ? 
 Are you sure you have $ 100 in your checking account ? 
 I ’ ll check for you . 
 It looks like you only have $ 57 left in your account . 
 That ’ s what my computer is showing . 
 I need to use the ATM . 
 I ’ m not sure how . 
 I ’ Ve never used one before . 
 What do I have to do ? 
 Then what ? 
 What do I have to do next ? 
 Excuse me , miss . Could I have something to drink , please ? 
 Is it possible to get a beer ? 
 You ’ re right . I ’ ll save the beer for when we land . One orange juice , please . 
 What is it ? 
 A trip to China for summer vacation . Wow ! What a wonderful surprise ! Thank you . This is the best surprise I've ever had .

 My stomach is bothering me . 
 I had a ham sandwich with mayonnaise for lunch . 
 It could be bad food , but I didn ’ t feel so well yesterday , either . 
 I haven ’ t been under any more stress than usual . 
 I feel like maybe I am coming down with the flu . 
 Yes , the bookshop is just around the corner.Turn left and you ’ ll see the bookshop . 
 Right , if you see the bookshop , you can see the hospital . 
 Not at all . 
 How to do it ? 
 How long will it take to reach the buffet ? 
 The line sure does move fast . 
 OK . I like that green vegetable but I don't know how to call it . 
 All right . 
 No , I missed it . 
 Someone was in the way . 
 What's the problem ? 
 That's OK . But you'd better take an additional course in some English schools . 
 This kind of school is good at helping people to improve their English . 
 Yes , before you start your training , they will test you on your English first . 
 I failed my oral test . 
 I'm not practicing enough . 
 When I talk to Chinese , I always want to speak Chinese . 
 Hi , Zhengjun , what make you so happy . 
 Oh , congratulations ! 
 Thank you . Hey , do you know how espresso got its name ? 
 It's because of the way the steam and boiling water are pressed through the coffee . Es-PRESS-o , get it ? 
 You seem to be very tired . 
 Why don't you join us to go out for a walk ? 
 Wow , it all looks so good . I ’ m not sure what to choose . 
 Actually , I ate too much pork yesterday . I fancy a change . 
 That sounds like a good idea . It looks very big though . 
 It looks delicious . I will order it . 
 Would you please make it for a single person ? 
 Is this the Law Firm of A & B ?

 Just water , please . 
 I wait , but please bring me some bread . Maybe I'd like to have some appetizer before they get here . Please give me the menu , and let me have a look . 
 I know in your resume that you have worked in your present company for 3 years , can you tell me why you want to leave your present job and join us ? 
 Why do you think you are qualified for this position ? 
 I like the Honda Accord you showed me before . I think it's more practical for my needs . 
 What does it come with standard ? 
 Cruise control ? I don't like that . 
 I think it's dangerous . What if I can't turn it off ? 
 I wish it didn't have cruise control . My wife doesn't like it either . 
 I suppose . And What about the sunroof ? Is that standard ? 
 I see . 
 Would you give me a bottle of beer , please ? 
 No , ice will spoil the taste . 
 Yes . Something non-alcoholic , please . 
 A glass of juice please . 
 The central Hotel , please . I have to be there by 6:00 . 
 Yes . I've never been here before . 
 No , I'm open to suggestions . 
 That's a good idea . 
 Thanks a lot . Here's ten yuan . Keep the change . 
 It's my girlfriend . I guess she's playing the army game . 
 I saw her dating with her ex-boyfriend again . 
 Maybe . But it still gets on my nerves . 
 Do you have any form of ID ? 
 I ’ m afraid not . It has to be a passport or a valid driver ’ s license . 
 OK , just fill in this application . You can sit over there . This brochure explains our services . We have free checking , and you will be given a debit card and on ATM card . There is no service 
 Hi , is this the Resume Writing Workshop ? 
 I really don ’ t know that much about putting together a resume . 
 What ’ s the most important part ? 
 What comes next ? 
 Can I list my interests next ? 
 You have an unusual accent , Mr . Robbins . Where are you from originally ? If you don ’ t mind me asking . 
 I guess that must be what I ’ m hearing , I really couldn ’ t place it . Do go back to Madrid often ? 
 Good morning , madam . Can I help you ? 
 Our jackets are over here next to coats and accessories . 
 Of course . The changing rooms are over there . 
 Your assistant said that it was time to come in and sign my escrow papers . 
 Do you need anything from me ? 
 There are a lot of papers ! 
 My dad is going to be here in a minute to help me go through this with you . 
 Can I start moving in after I finish signing these documents ? 
 Ugh . Another advertisement . They ’ Ve added two hours of advertisements to a two hours movie . 
 Why are we watching it anyway ? 
 True . True . 
 Really ? Did Coke pay him for that ? 
 You want something to drink ? 
 Sure . 
 How should I dress for the party ? 
 Good morning , may I help you ? 
 That's a beautiful city . When do you want to go there ? 
 Then please have a look at the table , there are so many plans . 
 I was wondering if you could company me to the Ball ?

 OK . By the way , please get them pressed . 
 How do you arrange this summer vacation ? 
 Where would you like to go ? 
 That's really a good idea . Taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good . I recommend you Qingdao or Dalian . 
 Yes , that's a good place to spend a holiday . Last year I went there . It's really . 
 let's go out for a walk . 
 Well , shall we go to the cinema ? 
 Merry Christmas , Lily . 
 This is your first Christmas in the US . Here is the gift for you . 
 Ok . People decorate their houses , place a Christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a Christmas carol together . 
 I want it short . 
 It will do . 
 No , why ? 
 Sure I like shopping . Who is organizing the party ? 
 What's the occasion ? 
 That's easy , how about a cowgirl ? Oh I know even better , a Canadian Mountie . 
 Leave it to me . I know exactly where to find it . 
 Excellent , come over at ten o'clock and we will start at the shopping center , the one around the corner from my house . They have just the shop we need . 
 Don't count on it . 
 I would like to get a double cheeseburger . 
 I would like everything on it , thank you . 
 Let me get some large curly fries . 
 Sure , how about a medium Pepsi ? 
 That'll be all . Thanks . 
 Thank you . Here you go . 
 I will be all right soon . I was terrified when I watched them fall from the wire . 
 I see . 
 I have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field . My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law , where I have been able to apply my paralegal education . I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts . I really love research and analyzing facts . My major in college was English , and as a result , my writing skills are my major strength . I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used . 
 Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input . 
 There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week . Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks , my boss and I stayed until 2 a . m . for two nights before the final wrap up . It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results . My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort . 
 I remember a case that was filled with obstacles . The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch . Through some hard work and fact digging , I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done . 
 My strengths are my caring about getting the job done . I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more . 
 I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves . I asked her if I could talk with her one day , and we had a good discussion . It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure . I took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day . 
 My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job . When I first started as a paralegal , I had a lot to learn . But through hard work , advice from some good mentors and continuing education , I have come a long way . I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner . 
 First , they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm . I really enjoy working with people . Secondly , they'll say I had great customer service skills . I put the customer first . And thirdly , they'll say that I know the law . I put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal and take it seriously . 
 Yes , I do . On a scale of one to 10 , what would you say morale was in this company ? 
 Because I like him . 
 Let's start the interview with some questions . Tell me about yourself and your past experience . 
 What finance experience have you had that qualifies you for this position ? 
 Why did you leave your last position ? 
 What are your strengths and weaknesses ? 
 How would your boss describe you and your work style ? 
 What are your salary expectations ? 
 Do you have any questions ? 
 What's the weather like ? 
 Why don't you look outside ? 
 Why do you say that ? 
 Is it raining right now ? 
 How do you know ? 
 I have to go shopping today . 
 Hello , Ann ! Is that you ? 
 It's been a long time ! What's new ? 
 Not bad I guess . I just got back from Hawaii . 
 I had a good time . You seem to be in a hurry . Don't let me hold you up . 
 Ok , I won't keep you then . 
 Yes , stay in touch . Bye ! 
 Sure ! It's txyb@gmail.com . 
 Yes , I am after some sugar . 
 Can you show me the way , please ? 
 Hey , Zina . You're here early today . 
 I just wanted to say thanks for putting us on the map so fast . I appreciate it . 
 Fair enough.Keep up the good work . 
 Yes , I've been sitting here for a few minutes . I'm waiting for someone to put gas in my car . 
 Self-service ? 
 Are you serious ? 
 Yes , I'm from Taiwan . I never heard of a gas station where you fill up your own car . 
 Do I really have to do it ? I don't know how . 
 What sign ? 
 I see . 
 He makes me sick . 
 The dress was on sale yesterday . 
 I'm so sorry , but rules are rules . 
 I'm sorry I couldn't help you . 
 We see you are all dressed to the nines . 
 Yes , this runway is going to sparkle with glamour and style ! 
 And others directly from New York . 
 Because you're going to love this show ! 
 All of the major sights are included . You'll visit the Louvre , the Eiffel Tower and all of the top museums . You'll also take a day trip out of Paris to Versailles . 
 Of course . Just give me your fax number . 
 Okay . I'll fax the itinerary to you immediately . 
 Yes , please . My son wants to go overseas , to England , to do his Master degree . I wondered if you offer any kind of loan that could assist him in doing so ? 
 I see . What does it entail ? I'm not sure if we will be eligible . 
 So , we could use it to pay for my son's living expenses , not just his tuition ? 
 That is good to know . Just think ! We've been worrying about this for weeks and just a short visit here and my mind is at ease . Thank you . 
 I ’ m thinking about where we shall spend our vocation . 
 Ok , dear.We will be late . 
 A ham salad sandwich . 
 Then , I ’ d like some eggs and bread for breakfast instead . 
 Harry is so down that he won't talk to anyone . 
 What do you mean ? 
 have you ever been in an earthquake ? 
 do you know where it measured on the Richter scale ? 
 no , but I was in quite a few tornados when I was younger . 
 I'm from the plains of the Midwest . It's a prime location for tornadoes . 
 most of the time we were lucky , but once a tree from our front yard was ripped out by its roots and ended up in our living room . 
 actually , some of my fondest memories of my childhood were of spending time with my family in the basement waiting for the tornados to pass . 
 no , but my father's car was destroyed in a flood once . It actually happened the day after he bought the car ! 
 How do I know if I qualify for unemployment benefits ? 
 I got laid off . 
 Do all jobs provide unemployment ? 
 Do you think that my job pays unemployment ? 
 Will I be able to collect a lot of money on unemployment ? 
 Have you been feeling OK lately ? 
 Has anyone ever told you that you had high blood pressure ? 
 People with high blood pressure seldom know they have it , which is why we call it the silent killer . 
 We will pump air into this cuff to get a reading . 
 It tells me how hard your heart pumps blood and how much your arteries relax at rest . 
 I swear I will never shop at a street market in China . It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something . 
 yes . Last Sunday I went to a nearby market . It was on open-air fair . I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot , without even trying to strike a bargain . I paid one hundred and twenty . And just 
 but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ? 
 Here is an invitation for you . 
 Tomorrow is the tooth anniversary of our company . Our general manager invites you to a dinner party . Do you think you can manage it ? 
 That is great . Dinner starts at 6 
 All right . Bye . 
 How do you like Chinese food ? 
 What other kind of food do you like ? 
 I just finished reading this article ' Getting Old Gracefully ' . It's a very good article . 
 A lot of things . There is a part about how old people should accept being old and stop feeling restless . You really should read it . 
 Why not ? What this article says makes good sense to me . If you read it , I'm sure you'll agree with me . 
 I should tell you that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes . 
 Very good ! Now , it's still morning here in New York . 
 I'm going to spend some time exploring the city . What can I do with my luggage ? 
 A deposit ? Isn't my luggage a deposit ? 
 Okay . Let me think about this . 
 Do you object to drinking black tea , Mr.Zhang ? 
 Do you drink green tea , then ? 
 But if the tea is good and well prepared , it will do much good . 
 Not only can it appease one's thirst , but it can also refresh one when tired . 
 Why is it so ? 
 Jane , the meeting is scheduled from 1:00 this afternoon . Have you made the necessary arrangements ? 
 That's right . The meeting is very important . Where shall the guests be received before the meeting begins ? 
 We'll have several foreign guests to attend the meeting . 
 Really ? I'll also try to speak slowly . How would you arrange the guests ' seats , Jane ? 
 Well , after my report , there will be an interval for rest and refreshments . 
 This little wooden stick is called a tee . 
 For the first drive , put the golf ball on the tee , and push the tee into the ground . 
 Pick up a wood and hold it like this , interlocking your fingers . 
 Position yourself , swinging the club , watch the ball and hit it as hard as you can . 
 Not too bad . The goal is to get the ball into the hole with as few hits as possible . 
 Is the factory fully-automated ? 
 What about supply of parts to the production line ? 
 What about the smaller components ? 
 if you can choose , will you marry a foreigner or a Chinese ? 
 not yet . But I wonder if I can get my parents ’ consent . 
 you are right . It is giving me a real headache . I feel like I ’ m between a rock and a hard place . 
 oh , how did you deal with it ? 
 oh , it ’ s a pity . What was the matter ? 
 like what ? 
 Oh , I see . In their culture women should put family first . 
 so that's why it ’ s hard to have a happy marriage with a foreigner . 
 What is the movie you saw last night ? 
 How do you like it ? 
 But I heard the box office rose up to 15 million in the first week . 
 My sister has given me two tickets for tonight . It is called ' The life of Rose ' , a French movie . 
 It tells the lifetime of a lady singer from a beggar in the street to a famous singer in the world . It is a kind of tragedy . 
 Let's go . The time is coming . 
 I was wondering if I could borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend . 
 It is in the park downtown . 
 We will need it for Saturday only . 
 Mary and I will be driving the van . 
 Yes , we can do that . Can we borrow the chairs from the lunchroom also ? 
 On , darn . The grocery store is closed . 
 Alright . We are out of everything . 
 I know , our schedules are so weird . Sometimes , the little corner store is the only thing within walking distance that ’ s open when we get home . 
 I know . Three dollars for milk . 
 All right . But how ? 
 I see . But could you give me another piece of paper ? 
 Thank you so much , Mr Addison . 
 Not so bad , but Kevin does have problems with his wife . 
 His wife always complained that Kevin's salary was too low and got no promotion . 
 Yeah , I agree with you . But you know , it's just one of those things . 
 Couldn't he wait until we're finished eating ? 
 Can you even hear what he's saying ? 
 Can you turn the lazy Susan for me ? I want some more chicken . 
 Are you all right ? 
 What's going on ? 
 Are you serious ? 
 Did he hurt you ? 
 I can't believe that . 
 I'll take you , if you'd like . 
 Are you being served , sir ? 
 Artistic tapestry is the highest expression form of the rug weaving art . How about these ones ? 
 Yes , sir . 
 Ninety dollars . 
 But considering the fine craftsmanship it is worth much more . 
 Please wait a minute , sir . 
 Of course you can . I am sure this one works very well . I just sent dozens of pages . How many pages are you sending ? Are you familiar with my fax machine ? 
 Yes , it will print immediately . 
 First , I'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . He or she will know all the local laws and regulations . 
 I think that we should send one of our HR people to do that . I don ’ t think we should use an agency , because they won ’ t be familiar with the type of people we employ . Have we decide on the location of 
 Why didn ’ t we choose an office in the CBD ? 
 Yes . We ’ Ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries . We hope to sign another three this month . 
 Hopefully next month . Everything is a little rushed . We should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly . 
 Yes , it has . We ’ re going to target the business community through business magazines . 
 Excuse me , Is there a hotel nearby ? 
 how can I get there ? 
 Hello , could you tell me my test results ? 
 Are you saying that all my results were normal ? 
 How will I know what the results mean on the website ? 
 Will the numbers mean anything to me ? 
 Can I see all of my test results at once ? 
 Have you a full-day trip ? 
 Do I have to book the tour right now ? 
 Is there a vacant table for 2 right now ? 
 what a pity . 
 OK . 
 I'm quite out of thoughts recently . 
 I'm worrying about my exam . 
 This is a very beautiful statue . What's it called ? 
 100th anniversary ? When was that ? 
 Sounds real good . It's a pity that I missed that . 
 I've been told you might have a vacant room . 
 Would it be okey to look at the room , now ? 
 This apartment looks nice . 
 How much is the rents ? 
 This apartment is nice , but I'd like to find a cheaper one . 
 Yes , I'd like a cheeseburger and a large order of French fries . 
 Yes , a medium Coke . 
 Yes . 
 To go , please . ( The attendant hands the customer his order . ) 
 Good afternoon ! Where to ? 
 You are going to Tian'anmen Square . No problem . 
 Around 20 minutes , but it all depends on the traffic . 
 By this time , it's better . The rush hour is over . 
 Sure thing . Here we are . 
 Eight yuan twenty cents . 
 Thank you . Have a nice day . 
 I didn't expect to see you at this hour . You must have goofed off again . 
 You'll be sorry if the boss finds it out . He may probably give you the bag . 
 Farmer's Pet Store . 
 Sure , we are off Singing Road , close to the bank . 
 Thank you for calling ABC Company , may I help you ? 
 Sorry , we have two Smiths , Robert Smith and James Smith , which one would you like to speak to ? 
 He is on the line . 
 Good morning , Jamie . What time is it now ? 
 I see . What is today's schedule ? 
 OK . Can you prepare things for the meeting in the meeting room ? Make enough copies of the handouts . 
 Yes . I am going to show them some slides in the meeting . Can you call Mr . Brown to remind him of the dinner this evening ? 
 That would be great ! You are really a good employee . 
 Yes , it is . 
 Ok , thank you . By the way , could you please tell me how I can get there from A community ? 
 I got it . Thank you so much . 
 Taxi ! 
 Beijing International Airport . Would you please help me with my baggage ? 
 Thank you . I've got just 50 minutes to go . Can we manage ? 
 I can't afford to miss my 9:40 flight . 
 I have a problem . 
 My mattress was supposed to be delivered today . 
 The delivery people showed up four hours late . 
 I was late for work because of them . 
 I want my money back for the delivery . 
 It shouldn't be a problem . 
 Please fill out the form . 
 It's August the thirteenth . 
 Yes , Ms . Jones . 
 Manhattan Square , please . 
 I'd like to go around the city , if you don't mind . 
 Wow ! It's a fruit sculpture ! Your chef is a real artist ! 
 You did ? Wow ! Where did you learn ... ? 
 Hello . Good morning , Stately Restaurant . May I help you ? 
 Fine , sir . For how many people , please ? 
 OK . What name , please ? 
 Can you spell that , please ? 
 Oh , thanks , Mr . Kaufman . We look forward to your visit . 
 Excuse me , sir . May I go with you to claim my luggage ? I am a stranger here . 
 Thank you . 
 Certainly , it's a pleasure . 
 Customs . 
 Do you have anything to declare ? 
 Would you like to open the suitcase , please ? 
 What's in the box ? 
 Are they liqueur chocolates ? 
 How many cigarettes do you have ? 
 Are you a visitor or a resident ? 
 Have a good time ! 
 Hi , I am Liu Ming . I am calling to tell you that I have got the job . 
 I really feel grateful to you for your reference . They have mentioned this in the job interview . 
 Thanks again . I will start on next Monday . I am sure I will have good performance . 
 Do you have the same style in white ? 
 What a pity . Are you likely to be getting more in ? 
 Do you love me ? 
 Yes , but do you love me ? 
 Why didn ’ t you answer my question ? 
 Do you love me ? Come on , I ’ m eager to hear . 
 Don ’ t cherish your words , dear . 
 Right . Just take off your jacket and shirt . And lie down on that bed over there ... That's right ... Now , just hold up your right arm , will you ? ... Does this hurt ? 
 And this ? 
 And do you feel anything when I do this ? 
 And you don't feel any pain anywhere else ? In you legs , for example ? 
 Well , it's probably nothing serious.But I think we'd better have that shoulder X-rayed.We can't do the until the morning , though.So it'd be better if you stay in hospital for the night 
 Hello . I've been asked to come and see about something called L / C ? What is it exactly ? 
 So the other party could be across the world or just on the other side of the street ! 
 Do you have trifles ? 
 Please bring me some trifles and apple pies . 
 Hey . Owen ! Have you gone on your family vacation yet ? 
 Didn't you bring his favorite toy ? 
 Where did you go ? You've got a beautiful tan . 
 You must have had a great time . Most children love to play in the sand on the beach and go swimming . 
 His friends will be very happy to get the little souvenir . 
 Your dog is really cute . What's his name ? 
 What kind of dog is he ? 
 Well , he sure likes to run around a lot . Is he well behaved ? 
 That sounds like my cat . She likes to scratch the couch with her claws . 
 About a year ago actually . You've probably never seen her though . 
 She's not a house-cat . She stays outside most of the time . 
 I have to do some shopping . 
 I'm trying to buy a new bedroom set . 
 I'm not sure . 
 I have no idea where to find one . 
 I would appreciate that . 
 Is the furniture at IKEA cheap ? 
 Hi , Tony . You look unhappy . What's wrong ? 
 What happened ? 
 What on earth are you talking about ? 
 What were you thinking ? 
 But what you should do is study hard . 
 So long as you learn from your mistakes . 
 Isn't it just great ! I just knew I'd win ! 
 Not only that ! 
 OK , OK . I'll whisper it to you , but you have to promise not to tell anyone ! 
 What newspaper are you reading ? 
 Why don't you read the local newspaper ? 
 New York Times is better ? 
 We ’ re having a department meeting at 10 o ’ clock , ok ? 
 See Julie , the receptionist . She knows where all that stuff is kept . You might like a calendar for you desk . She can give you one of those too . 
 The photocopier is near my office . Come on , I ’ ll show you where it is . 
 Yes , I do . Everyone ’ s really friendly . Sometimes , I wish I worked outdoors more , especially during the summer . 
 We usually tell each other where we are with various clients and potential clients . The boss assigns extra duties to people who she thinks can best deal with them . It ’ s also a chance to put forward su 
 There is so much information and I advise to read newspaper . 
 Yes , of course . If you like the room , call the landlord and confirm the information of the room . 
 Let's go practice your driving . 
 Did you buckle your seatbelt ? 
 You need to start the car now . 
 Go left . 
 I'll let you know when I want you to stop . 
 All right , try parking here . 
 Driver , take me to the airport . 
 Driver , can you please speed up ? I m afraid I might miss the flight . 
 Damn it ! I think I'm going to miss the plane . 
 At 2:00 . 
 Really ? Great ! 
 Here is the money . 
 Hello , Mr . Gao . We appreciate your letting us have the apartment . 
 The ad said rent was thirty thousand . That includes utilities and phone , I assume . 
 That's another one thousand six hundred ? 
 Are you a goal-oriented person ? 
 How do you plan to do your present job ? 
 Wang , I'd like you to meet my friend . Dou , this is Wang . 
 Pleased meet you , too , Mr . Dou . 
 We're having trouble with Bob . 
 He's been late for work twice . 
 What's the matter ? 
 I'm calling to tell you that the merchandise ordered last month has not arrived yet . 
 Please find out the reason as soon as possible . We are in bad need of it . 
 Hello ? 
 I am sorry . Mr . Doff is out right now . 
 I don't know . But he will certainly be back for lunch . This is his wife speaking . Can I take a message for you ? 
 Very Good . I will let him know as soon as he comes back . But , may I have your name , please ? 
 Bye . 
 Get used to it , Mary . I'm off hamburgers for good health . Most fast food is loaded with sodium . 
 My doctor says I should cut back on sodium-rich foods to lower my blood pressure . 
 Actually , my blood pressure isn't that high yet , but they say it increases with age . 
 I want to lower my risk of heart attack and stroke , too . 
 I've noticed you've been munching away on lots of fruits and vegetables recently . 
 Mr . Drake , I'm pleased to do business with your company . 
 Your company is very well respected . About how long have you been in business ? 
 And this is your company's head office ? 
 That's wonderful . Isn't your company part of ARE Corporation ? 
 That's not bad . How long have you been in PR ? 
 hey , you look great ! how's everything ? 
 really ? tell me about it . I haven't gone to the club for a long time . I am too busy with work . 
 you're right . Too much or too little won't do any good . 
 sounds reasonable . 
 and fruits ! 
 I've heard that . Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ? 
 I think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track . 
 If you fall in love like him , you will go soft in the head , as well . 
 You want a bet ? 
 Hello , Could I speak to Mary , please ? This is Mrs . Fort here . 
 Ah , Mary , good evening . Look , I was wondering if you like to come to a party we are having on Friday ? There are many coming from the office . 
 I ’ m hungry , let ’ s go grab a bite to eat . 
 Will you take long ? 
 Come on ! We have been here for almost an hour ! I thought you said you were only going to get a few things ! How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish ! 
 Whoa whoa whoa ! Are you nuts ? How much is all this going to cost ? I ’ m looking at the price at each one of these little things and it ’ s outrageous ! This is basically a crayon ! 
 Fine ! Get the stupid thirty dollar crayon ! 
 There's an open house this weekend . 
 It starts at 11AM in the morning . 
 Oh really what ’ s happening ? 
 Ok but you must stay calm . Do you want me to give you a lift ? 
 Ok , wait one minute . I must remember where I left the keys . 
 What kind of performance ? A lion dance ? 
 Sure , you'll be dancing with lions . What do you expect ? Then what about Range Dance which we did before . 
 Maybe not . I think we should just focus on the retired people . 
 What about the costumes ? 
 Try something new . We can find a supporting agency . 
 How far is it from here to the airport ? 
 I need to get there before ten.Can we make it ? 
 I heard Rose is pregnant . I hope it'll be a boy this time . 
 After three baby girls in a row , Rose is under a lot of pressure from her in-laws.They want a boy in the worst way now . 
 I agree with you , but you know how old-fashioned the elders are . 
 There's still a lot left-have some more ! 
 Are you here to make a deposit Mr Hayes ? 
 You want to withdraw on your Time Deposit , right ? 
 Of course , Mr Hayes . That's what I'm here for . What would you like to know ? 
 This bank charges you 6 months interest as a penalty if you withdraw before maturity . Would it be possible to take the money from your Current Account , for example ? 
 I think it's time for me to meet my admirer and make him face the music . 
 I'm leaving him a message taped to my computer screen . 
 He'll see it . It says , I like sweets . Meet me at two thirty in the parking lot . 
 No . But I'll fill you in later . Right now I have to find Vince . 
 You can buy some of these nice butterflies . 
 What ? You feel sorry for the butterflies ? 
 Well , I agree with you . I'd rather think that the butterflies are flying around in the mountains . I just wonder if they really catch so many that it affects the butterfly population . 
 How much are they ? 
 If you want . Didn't you buy her a small vase already ? 
 Alright . Buy it then . I won't buy anything . Well , maybe I'll buy some Cognac . 
 Let's go ask about it . 
 What's the fare , please ? 
 Is this the right bus to Zizhuyuan Park ? 
 But somebody told me this was the right bus to take . I want to go to Tian'anmen Square , you see . 
 Would you please let me know when we get there ? 
 Are you sure you're using the right program ? 
 That's why you can't open it . You'll have to upgrade before you can read the file . 
 Yes , is there something wrong ? 
 So sorry , I must have confused the orders . I'll check it . 
 I'm really sorry , I'll bring you a hot one right away . 
 Yeah , it is . I come here all the time . 
 OK . 
 Sure . What are you going to have to drink ? 
 I think I'll have a glass of wine . 
 Not really , maybe we can just order some bread . 
 I'm not sure . I haven't decided yet . Can you recommend something ? 
 I think I'll have the lobster . What are you going to have ? 
 I'm gonna go to the bathroom . When the waitress comes back , will you order for me ? 
 Ladies and gentlemen . It's about time to land in New York . Here are a couple of forms for you to fill out . 
 They are E / D cards . All passengers except American citizens must complete these forms . 
 It will save you much time when you clear customs . 
 How can you be so sure ? 
 Peter , it's time to go home now ! Hurry up ! 
 Honey , it's almost noon . We have to go home and make lunch for your sister . 
 Peter , it's a quarter to twelve . Let's go home now ! 
 Good morning . I ’ m here to see Rochelle Davis , the Human Resources Manager . 
 Yes , I do . I have a 10:00 appointment with her this morning . 
 My name is Bruce Green . 
 Thank you . 
 Nice to see you with us , Anne.Please make yourself at home . 
 Emergency road service . May I help you ? 
 All right . What's your membership card , please ? 
 And your name ? 
 What's the expiration date on your card ? 
 Where is your car now ? 
 And which direction were you going ? 
 What is the make and model of your car ? 
 What color is it ? 
 What's your licence plate number ? 
 All right , Madam . I'll have a tow truck there within 30 minutes . 
 What kind would you like ? 
 You can get DEL or dial-up . 
 I would recommend DEL . 
 It's better because it doesn't tie up the phone . 
 DEL isn't connected through your phone line , but dial-up is . 
 That's correct . With DEL you can do both . 
 I'm sorry . These batteries are not on sale . 
 I'm sorry . If you look at the ad again , you'll see that the other brand is on sale . 
 Yes , many people make that mistake . 
 You're right . Many ads are like that . 
 Just one second , and I'll give you the batteries that are on sale . 
 Hiring , firing , training , insurances , benefits , retirement plans , salary , vacation . 
 But most of time , they provide assistances . 
 Say if the Engineering Department wants to hire a person , they will request HR to find candidates . 
 The Engineering Manager and his team will interview the candidates . HR will also be involved with the interview , but basically arranging the schedule and explaining the benefits . 
 Then the Engineering Manager will choose the candidate . 
 What's the problem ? 
 Let me have a look . How did this happen ? 
 Was there much bleeding afterward ? 
 Well , this doesn't look too serious . Nurse , could you please get me a suture set ? 
 Yes . Three , I think . It wont ' be too painful . Alright , we're done . That wasn't so bad , was it ? 
 You're lucky there was no lasting damage . I'll set up an appointment for you to come back in five days . We'll take those stitches out then . So long . 
 I went out with Leo last night . It was really exciting . 
 Yes , I know . He's really on the A-list . 
 Oh , Mike . How are you doing ? 
 Well , I prefer yogurt to all the other drinks . Have you ever tried a kind of yogurt with old milk in it ? It tastes great and very healthy too . 
 Why don ’ t you go ahead of me ? I have more items than you . 
 You ’ re welcome . It was good seeing you again . 
 how's your new job going ? 
 how are you finding your new boss ? 
 would you rather have her or your old boss back ? 
 how about your new co-workers ? 
 do you miss your old co-workers ? 
 do people in different departments get along with each other ? 
 do you like working in teams with people from different departments ? 
 do you like working in teams ? 
 Hello ? 
 Can I speak to Li Hong , please ? 
 Hi , Li Hong.This is Alice . 
 Not bad.Li Hong , I am sorry that I can ’ t go to see Mrs.Brown with you tomorrow morning.My mother is ill . I must take care of her . 
 OK.Bye - bye . 
 Susan has got the cancer of stomach . 
 Yesterday when I went to hospital to see her , you cannot imagine how greatly surprised when I saw her . 
 Because of atomic cocktail and other medicines , all of them have the side effect . she has lost all her hair . 
 I can help you with that . Just have a seat and roll up your left sleeve . 
 Your doctor has requested a check of your white blood count . 
 If your white blood cell count is off , it could signal an infection somewhere in your body . 
 I am putting a tourniquet on your arm to plump up the vein . It will only feel like a little pin prick . 
 That was it ! Thank you for coming in today . 
 That's better . 
 I think so . 
 How ? Do you want to play strip-trivia or something ? 
 Why don't we just make it a friendly game ? 
 Would you like a cup of coffee ? 
 Oh , no . 
 This machine is out of order . 
 I sure did . 
 Room service . 
 Right . Excuse me . Mrs . Jones ? 
 What can I do for you ? 
 Just a few minutes , ma'am . 
 It has just occurred to me that there is still another possibility to ensure a prompt delivery of the goods . 
 How about making Hong Kong the port of shipment instead of New York ? 
 It's like this . There are only one or two ships sailing a month from New York to Osaka , while sailings from Hong Kong are quite frequent . If shipment were effected from Hong Kong , we could receive the goods much earlier . 
 Yes , exactly , because I want these goods on our market at the earliest possible date . 
 It sounds all right to me , but I will have to think about it . I'll give you a definite answer tomorrow . If I choose Seattle , will it be possible for you to ship the goods by the end of March ? 
 911 emergency . What is the problem ? 
 When was this break-in ? 
 Where was the break-in ? 
 Was anything stolen ? 
 Why do you think there was a break-in ? 
 We'll send a squad car shortly . 
 Would you please bring me the black suit ? I want to try it on . 
 I think this suit fits perfectly . 
 It's fine . Please wrap it . 
 I'd really like to help you out , but I am broke myself . 
 Good morning . I ’ m Mickey Huang , I have an appointment with Mr wilson . 
 That's right . My appointment is for 11 o'clock . 
 Thank you . 
 No , I'm fine . Thank you . 
 Certainly . I prefer the winter and I love plum blossoms much more . 
 Seeking plum blossoms with stepping on the snow ? That's a good idea . Let's go ! 
 Take care ! Don't slip down to the ground . 
 Yes . Very wonderful . 
 Yes . It should be the fragrance of plum blossoms . 
 Hi , Nancy.How are you doing ? 
 Not right now . I've got to get another car and my old one is blown up . 
 You mean used car ? 
 Well , yeah , but I'd be getting somebody else's problem . 
 It's the same kind of deal though , you know , you never know what you're going to get . 
 Let's look at them all.Have you got a paper there ? 
 Yes , I want one with automatic transmission . 
 Full insurance , please . 
 I'm starving ! It would be truly appreciated if you bought me a burrito . 
 I'm starving , as I didn't eat yet today . 
 My stomach feels so empty . 
 I'll be getting money on Friday , and I'll get it back to you then . 
 That's not nice . 
 I can't go home yet , because I have things to do here . 
 The baby is crying again . 
 How can you do so ? Perhaps something is wrong with him . Let ’ s go and see him . 
 Hi , I'm John Sandals , and I have a reservation . 
 Here you go . 
 Certainly ! Would you like my American Express card ? 
 I thought American Express was accepted everywhere . Never mind . Here's my VISA . 
 Yes , that's just fine . 
 What's your favorite sport ? 
 Is the entrance charge expensive ? 
 Haha , jogging ? Perhaps it might be a bit too boring ? 
 You are really a man who knows how to enjoy being alone . 
 Quite well.thank you.And what about you ? 
 So , did you go out with Richard ? 
 Did you like it ? 
 Yeah . So did you do anything else ? 
 Did you have fun there ? 
 Where is the produce ? 
 Is there any produce on sale ? 
 I want to know whether you can handle the matters of registered permanent residence . 
 I have no other questions . Thank you . 
 Bob , how about joining the boxing club this summer vacation ? 
 So let's get registered tomorrow . 
 Jodi , I must get a hold of Jim today , but I forgot his address and phone number . 
 Really ? You ’ Ve helped me a lot . Thank you . 
 So you said you and Amanda met through a mutual friend . How did it happen ? 
 Did he tell you what she was like first ? 
 How can you keep in touch with your aunt in America ? 
 It's very expensive , right ? 
 Why not send E-mail through the Internet ? 
 Sure . You can send E-mail to each other every day through the internet . In addition , you can make a phone call through the internet , too . 
 No problem . I'll tell you . 
 When can you give me the final decision ? 
 OK . 
 Thank you for your interview with me . 
 No where special . I was just taking a walk . 
 To get a little exercise . I'm so out of shape . 
 That sounds great . Give me a call next time you guys play . 
 Yeah . It was hard . When do you take it ? 
 Mostly on the civil war . You should also study the impact Martin Luther King Jr . had on American society . 
 I only had 1 question about him . But you might get more . I dont know if he will have the same exam or not . 
 If you cant study everything , then that is probably the best way to go . 
 Good luck . 
 Are you sure this is the right restaurant 。 
 You don't think you could be wrong ? 
 I don't know . It looks a little wrong down . 
 You're hundred percent sure you want to eat here ? 
 Would you like me to fill out the form ? 
 That's very kind of you . 
 No , it ’ s my sister . 
 She ’ s 18 . 
 Yes , she is . 
 Well , just a little thin . 
 Sure.Step in . 
 No.But it's a bit strange today . 
 Certainly , sir . 
 I'm sorry , sir . What seems to be the trouble ? 
 I'll just go and check it for you , sir . 
 Will this do ? Your major is not related to banking , as you know . 
 Money is not the only standard to decide your career . In fact , there are more important things you can refer to when evaluating your career . If I were you , I would choose one I like to do . 
 Don't worry . We can always change our careers , when we are unsatisfied with them . 
 Yes , I received the scholarship 3 times on end . 
 Yes , I joined the CPC when I was a freshman 
 Oh , I ’ ll go to shanghai to practice there . 
 I think so , you know there is a great deal of opportunity for business there . 
 I think it will be very useful in many ways . Beside , shanghai is an important trade center , not only in China , but also in the world , English is useful in almost all walks of life . 
 That ’ s my wish . 
 Sorry . I didn't know . 
 I'm going to use my ATM card . 
 Done . 
 No , thanks . 
 Pardon me ? 
 Paper , please . 
 I didn ’ t go anywhere . I stayed at home . 
 Nothing . I just feel very lonely in this city . I miss my family . 
 Can you stay and accompany me for a while ? 
 Thank you so much . You are so sweet . 
 Is there anything I can do ? 
 May I recommend the popular route ? It's a seven days ' trip and cost $ 500 . 
 Everything , sir , including the air tickets , accommodation and gate tickets . 
 Why are you reading the classifieds ? What do you need ? 
 Are you having any luck ? 
 Do you mind if I go with you ? 
 I learned to negotiate 9 from my mother . I thought I was pretty good at bargaining , but I had a problem the other day at Kimble ’ s Department Store . 
 I wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend . It was priced at forty dollars , so I started by offering the salesclerk thirty . 
 Okay . Is all going well ? 
 Really ? That's great . You really did a good job . Anything else to tell me ? 
 OK . If he wants to make any changes , minor alternations can be accepted . Let me know what happens . 
 Hi , Mark ! Hi , do you have a minute ? 
 Sure , no problem . Can we fix a time to talk later ? 
 Ok , see you 10 o'clock next Monday ! 
 Good morning , sir . Can I help you ? 
 May I have your name , please ? 
 Just a moment , sir , while I look through our list . Yes , we do have a reservation for you , Mr . Bradley . Would you please fill out this form while I prepare your key card for you ? 
 Sure . Here you are . 
 You can just skip that . I will put in the room number for you later on . 
 Let me see , name , address , nationality , forwarding address , passport number , place of issue , signature and date of departure . Oh , here sir . You forgot to put that date of your departure . Here let me fill it in for you . Are you leaving in ... ? 
 Now everything is in order . Mr . Bradley , your room number is 6020 . It is on the sixth floor and the daily rate is 90 dollars per night . Here is your key card with all the information on your booking , the hotel services and the hotel rules and regulations on it . Please make sure that you have it with you all the time . You need to show it when you sign in for your meals and drinks in the restaurants and the bars . You also need to show it when you collect your key from the information desk . 
 And now if you are ready Mr.Bradley , I will call the bellboy and he will take you to your room . 
 I hope you enjoy your stay with us . 
 This is my admission card , and these are the books . 
 By the way , can I renew the borrowing ? 
 Sense and Sensibility , English version . 
 Can I just do it here ? 
 OK , thanks . 
 I was thinking of buying this from the bookstore when my father got this from the library ... anyway , how much should I pay ? 
 Here you are . Thanks . 
 Would you like to order anything else ? 
 The waitress is walking over here with our check even as we speak . 
 Yes , she really went out of her way to make this a pleasant dining experience . 
 How much money should we leave for a tip ? 
 She definitely deserves 20 % for a tip . 
 Yes , what a wonderful meal ! 
 I would love to rent out your apartment . 
 How much is the rent ? 
 That ’ s a lot of money . 
 What about $ 800 ? 
 I can ’ t pay much more than that . 
 That would be fine . 
 I wonder if you could help me find something for my daughter . 
 I think that would be perfect . 
 In fact , she prefers Macs . How much is one ? 
 She's going to be so happy . Let me have one . 
 I'll pay for it with my VISA . 
 Are there any extras that she needs ? 
 You've been so helpful . Thank you . 
 Are you a soccer fan ? 
 Which team is your favorite ? 
 I like the Brazilians . They are the real champions . 
 Yes , I'm rather good at driving . 
 Yes , but do you have your learner's permit ? 
 Have you ever driven a car before ? 
 Are you aware of all the controls in the car ? 
 When would you like me to start teaching you ? 
 Call me tomorrow , and we'll get started . 
 They're quite complex machines and they have a lot of different components . We need to check the metal casing regularly for any signs of corrosion . We also check the brushes once a fortnight to make sure they aren't worn down . It's important to make sure everything is properly aligned and we adjust it if necessary . There is a canvas belt at the end of the assembly line . If it gets wet , it might rot so we check that regularly too . 
 It ’ s big and exciting but noisy . 
 You can see the Forbidden City . 
 It ’ s beautiful but crowded . 
 You look great ! However , I think you are a little over dressed for dinner . 
 Yes , but not the Ritz Carlton , the " Ritz " is a pizza place with peanut shells on the floor . 
 I'll wait right here for you Superman . 
 Can we go to the Carlton next time and can you wear that fabulous suit ? 
 Yes , at first I felt very awkward . After Bill was demoted and then resigned , it was kind of like somebody died ! I mean the atmosphere in the office was like a funeral parlor or something . And then I was afraid people would look at me as a traitor for filling in his spot when the management asked me to ... 
 Thankful , no . I guess everyone understands the opportunity I had to step into a leadership role is so great for my career . I'm really moving up the ladder now that I'm considered a supervisor . After a couple weeks , it was like nothing happened . 
 Yeah , and they also take the blame , that's what happened to my old boss ... 
 What ? 
 You must be joking ! 
 That won't be a problem . Could you please tell me your name ? 
 Sir , I'm Michelle , and I run the front desk . Please tell me the days you'll be here . 
 We recently changed many things here , sir , including our prices . Do you mind , sir ? 
 The price will be $ 308 a night . 
 Very good . Now , Mr . Sandals , about the room , smoking or nonsmoking ? 
 Most of our clients prefer nonsmoking . Now , does a queen sound okay ? 
 One more second , sir . Your reservation is now verified , so all I need is your phone number . 
 Let me repeat that 626-555-1739 . Okay , sir , we look forward to seeing you in April ! 
 His girlfriend broke up with him . 
 Are the children all grown up now , Rose ? 
 Oh , very interesting . And what about Rita ? She was such a bright child — always reading . 
 Really ? And Chris ? She was a very pretty little girl . 
 Oh , how interesting . And what about Larry and Rocky ? 
 Really ? Where does he live now ? 
 And does Rocky drive a truck , too ? 
 Really ? Where does he fly ? Does he fly to other countries ? 
 About my driving test , did I do well ? 
 Are you telling me that I passed the test ? 
 What did I mess up on ? 
 Tell me . 
 That's not easy for me . 
 Am I still going to get my license ? 
 We ’ re going to need a lot of new stuff after the holidays . Let ’ s make a list . 
 Well , to begin with , we ’ re going to have to get a new desk for you and I ’ d like to replace that old typewriter . 
 I'm sorry , but I can't go . 
 I have to see my daughter . 
 I have an appointment at one fifteen . 
 Yes . I Would like make a reservation to Huston for tomorrow . 
 Oh , that's quite convenient . Thank you . 
 Sure , I can go to the store for you . What do you need ? 
 Is there anything else that you want me to pick up ? 
 Is there any other place you would like me to go to for you ? 
 Sure , no problem . Is your prescription ready ? 
 Okay , I'll pick it up for you . 
 You're welcome . 
 I am sorry , sir . Can you tell me your room number ? 
 Is there anything else I can do for you ? 
 OK , we will send a repairman to your room right now . 
 I'm afraid so . 
 What ’ s to get ready ? 
 Nope . 
 Nope . 
 Let me see , Mr . Lee.right ? How would like to pay your bill ? 
 Yes . 
 Mary , can you tell me how you keep in shape ? 
 Now , tell me what you often eat . 
 Do you eat a lot of vegetables ? 
 What do you like to drink ? 
 Whatever would you like to drink ? 
 How often do you exercise ? 
 It's a good diet and a regular exercise . 
 I want a pair of sports shoes , Adidas . 
 I wear size 40 . 
 Oh , I like the color . 
 I had some bread for breakfast . 
 Brunch ? 
 Actually , many Taiwanese wake up late on Sunday mornings , too . It may be a good idea for them to eat brunch instead of eating breakfast and lunch . 
 Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ’ s showing your respect to your co-workers . 
 Well , this one is not compulsory . It is just suggestion . 
 What kind of jobs have you had ? 
 How did your previous employers treat you ? 
 What have you learned from the jobs you have had ? 
 When you worked in your previous company , which did you prefer , working with other people or by yourself ? 
 Did you hear about Neil ? 
 I hear that he's quitting . 
 I'm afraid not ! Now this is just between you and me . 
 So so . 
 You're welcome . I'd like you to join us for dinner again sometime . 
 Today ? 
 Don't mention it . I am pleased to help you . 
 I'll do that.Thank you.Have a safe trip home . 
 I'm awfully sorry , I have other plan . 
 I'd love to come other time if it can be arranged . 
 Certainly , I'll be going . 
 I'll be waiting for you in our office about nine o'clock . 
 Well , I've got to go . See you later . 
 Thanks , you too . 
 Are you all right ? 
 Is this Mr.Smith ' s residence ? 
 My name is Paul.Is Mr.Smith in ? 
 Can you make a suit for me to measure ? 
 That's fine . 
 OK . 
 Don't ask such a question . You know it has no certain answer . Everyone knows it is in his heart . 
 Maybe , the whirligig of time , who knows ? 
 Where did you go yesterday ? 
 How often do you play tennis ? 
 I seldom play tennis . I prefer football and basketball . 
 I usually play with my schoolmates . 
 Yes , I went to the Than He Sports Center for a football match last Sunday . 
 Excuse me , what time is the next train to New York ? 
 Is it a through one ? 
 Well , please give me a first class ticket . 
 OK , how was everything ? 
 Would you like this to-go ? 
 Sure , no problem . Here you are . That'll be 25 dollars . 
 Yes , we accept Visa and MasterCard . 
 Thanks . I'll be right back . 
 Here's your receipt . 
 You're welcome . Please come again . 
 Really ? Let ’ s hit the road . 
 Yes , do you have any rooms available ? 
 No . I need a double and three triples . My family is waiting for me in the car . 
 Ok ... Here you are . 
 Is breakfast included ? 
 I am sorry to say this , but I seem to have lost the key to the safe . 
 Yes , I believe so.How should I compensate for this ? 
 What ! One hundred U . S . dollars.Is it covered by the insurance ? 
 I think I need a new notebook . 
 You bet there is . Feast your eyes on this puppy ! 
 Believe it ! 
 Excuse me , I'm looking for your English textbooks . 
 Do you have any textbooks to help improve students ' reading skills ? 
 Great . That ' s just the sort of thing I'm looking for . Thanks . 
 It was just a misunderstanding . 
 No , not so soon . Couldn ’ t I persuade you to stay a couple of days more ? 
 I hope this won ’ t be our last meeting . 
 I will miss you . 
 It's a pity that I'm too busy to see you off tomorrow . 
 Take care of yourself and remember to keep in touch . 
 Goodbye and have a good flight . 
 I'm starving . Let's get something to eat . 
 Sure . What kind of food do you like ? 
 How about some Korean food ? There's a place right there on the corner . 
 We want to order some of these products . 
 Can you supply us right away ? 
 Good , we'll take 500 suits . 
 Do you give me a bonus ? 
 Do you allow any commission ? 
 Hello , this is Steven . May I speak to Mr . Xu ? 
 I need to make an appointment with you today . 
 3 o'ctock this afternoon . 
 Yes . That would be better . 
 Good-bye . 
 Sorry , I just worried about him . You know , he should be here an hour ago . 
 But he still does not come back . 
 Hey ! What happened ? ! My song was only half way through and it skipped to the next song . 
 You cancelled the song , didn't you , Jack ? 
 Then , is the machine broken or ... 
 Hello , I'm sorry it's been such a long time . I've been away on business . I'd like to discount this . 
 Yeah , sure . Here they are . Take your time going through them , I'm in no hurry . 
 Do I need to pay anything ? Like a handling fee , or something ? 
 I have a little trouble , and I don't know how to deal with it . 
 Tom wants me to write a recommendation letter for him , but I don't know how to write it . 
 Really ? Tell me without delay . 
 Well , I see . 
 It's easy to write those . 
 Tom got along well with classmates . He is really a good boy . 
 What should I write except these ? 
 OK , I will remember . 
 Yes . I want to deposit some money into my Savings Account , please . 
 Correct . 
 There we go . Thanks very much . 
 Yes . Will you ? 
 How did you do that ? 
 Why is that ? 
 What ’ s the reason for that ? 
 You can just go to work after you vote . 
 I get it now . 
 Oh , it ’ s lovely . Think of the nasty weather we had last week . 
 Fine , thank you . And you ? 
 Good afternoon , Lincoln Corporate Services . Lina speaking , how may I help ? 
 That's not a problem , I'm more than happy to explain everything in laymen's terms . PIN stands for Personal Internet Banking . You can do all of your usual banking using the Internet , no need to call 
 We can take care of that for you , too . You can get all of your usual banking services plus some new extra ones . As this service is net bases , you can do it anywhere . 
 I'm hungry . Let's go to the snack bar . 
 I am going to try Gado Gado . 
 it's a kind of rice ball that is made in Malaysia . What about you ? 
 do you want noodles , vegetables , rice , meat , seafood , beans , or dessert ? 
 have you ever tried tempura ? 
 it's deep fried vegetables , which is commonly eaten in Japan . 
 most people eat tempura with chopsticks , but you can use a fork if you don't know how to use chopsticks . 
 let me think . You could get an Indian or Thai vegetable curry , or you could get some Kimchi . 
 I used to buy lunch every day from the International food stall at school . Every day was an adventure ! 
 Yes , the pain comes more intense when the weather is bad . And the pain comes intense when I walk too much . 
 Yes , I have . 
 Yes , ti does . Just like a needle prick . Besides , the place that hurts often feels cold , too . 
 Yes , I do . 
 By the way , does acupuncture hurt ? 
 Yes . Let's start today . 
 Really ? Wow , it is great . 
 I suppose so . It's great . 
 Yes , is there a coffee machine around here ? 
 Where is the break room ? 
 Got it . 
 Thank you . 
 Just for a few weeks . I need this vacation . You ’ ll be all right . You know the project we ’ re working on , and you ’ re a good scientist . Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll be back as soon as I spend or gamble all my money . 
 Las Vegas . I find gambling relaxing . I don ’ t take it seriously , the way some people do . Besides , I love the shows and the all-night atmosphere of the town . The casinos never close , you know . 
 What else should we do now after the floors are done and after the furniture is in ? 
 I'm the painter . You can be in charge of going to curtain shops to choose curtains . That will probably be pretty expensive too . Having good curtains made isn't cheap . 
 Absolutely not . The windows must be measured , and then the curtains need to be made professionally . So that will take a while . Maybe a month or so . 
 We need to find an interior decorating company to redecorate the kitchen . I believe in Portland there are shops that specialize in kitchen renovation . I will look in the Yellow Pages . I'd like a kitchen mostly in ivory and light green . 
 Me ? Cook our dinners ? Hah ! You will be cooking , dear . You will cook . 
 Well , I suppose we'll have to hire a cook then . So you won't be able to afford any clothes next year . 
 Maybe I'll cook once or twice a week . How is that ? 
 Oh , gosh ! I feel everything around me is against me . 
 Well , I am all ears . Maybe they are helpful . 
 I understand what you mean , and I will not upset myself . Face it . 
 Great Britain Airline , anything I can do for you ? 
 Hold on please , I will check for you . Flight GB152 takes off every day at 13 
 OK . Don't forget to get your ticket three days ahead . 
 I had a terrific working relationship with my boss , even though we are very different people . Because I've had a number of bosses , I've come to realize that to make things work , you have to understand what's important to your boss . Then you have to do everything you can to support him ( or her ) . It's natural to think about your own agenda first , but if you help your boss , Ifs likely to move your agenda ahead at the same time . My last boss was great in that regard , she appreciated my efforts and rewarded me when I helped her accomplish her goals . 
 Many are important — intelligence , diligence , information and planning . But the most important , I think , is achieving results . 
 Really ? Why ? 
 It's a pity that I was traveling around Europe at that time . 
 You're right ! I will call him this weekend and meet him . 
 Which train is the ticket for ? 
 It is not too late . Pass your ticket to me , please . 
 Five Yuan . 
 Look out ! A small boy is rushing out blindly . 
 You stopped just in time . Good for you ! 
 John hasn't got married up to now . 
 Really ? Does Mary know that ? 
 How silly John is . 
 I'd like to have Chinese food . 
 Right here , please . 
 Oh , thank you . So nice you are . 
 I want a cup of bean milk . Do you have any ? 
 Thanks a lot . Oh , excuse me . Can I take two value meals ? And I want some chili paste . 
 Oh , sorry to bother you . I want to know what kind of meat it is . 
 That's OK . Thanks very much . 
 OK . 
 Well , I studied French at school , but I ’ Ve forgotten most of it . I learnt some Russian while I was studying there and now I study Spanish in evening classes . Do you speak Japanese at home with your pa 
 How do you find studying a language on the internet ? 
 I bet you find the character difficult to write ! 
 So , you can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers , right ? 
 In a way , it ’ s similar to your experience of learning Chinese . Some Spanish words are very similar to English ones . But I need to practise listening to native speakers and saying the words myself . 
 Yes , I always have coffee in the morning . 
 I'm going to order scrambled eggs and toast . What about you ? 
 Good evening , sir . I think we have reservations . Have you fixed them ? 
 My name is Paul Harper . 
 We hope that this dispute can be settled through friendly negotiation without its being submitted for arbitration . 
 What did you get for lunch today ? 
 Where'd you get your food from ? 
 What sandwich did you order ? 
 Was it any good ? 
 I ordered a sandwich there before . 
 Yeah , and they messed my order up too . 
 Would you ring these up for me here ? 
 Yes , I did , thanks . 
 No , I'll pay for it in cash . 
 Good morning ! Is Mr . Smith in ? I'm Cheng Jun from China National Petroleum Corporation . I'd like to see him . 
 Am . No , I have an urgency to talk with him . 
 Thank you . 
 It's nine o'clock now . And I'll wait for him . 
 Of course . What is your size ? 
 OK . I'll get it for you . 
 Try this one , please . This is made of real leather and is very soft . How is it ? 
 We will carry out the order when the purchase order gets here . 
 Well , actually in most cases we don't talk about special deals , but since this one is so new I will listen to what you have to say . 
 I can't agree to that . My company will have to pay for both sending them and bringing them back . 
 OK , I agree . But the repeat order can't have the same terms . 
 Congratulations . That's great ! 
 When do you start ? 
 You're going to have to put in a lot of hours you know . 
 I bet . You must be stoked . 
 Sure . It's on you right ? 
 I don't know . He's a little depressed . He's having a hard time finding a job right now . 
 That sounds like a good idea . 
 I didn't know about it . What did you do ? 
 You were really lucky . 
 I hope I can go to your party . 
 You can twist his arm in order to have a control of him . 
 Do you sell washing machines ? 
 Is that a Danish machine ? The name looks Danish . 
 Sure . I ’ d like to see how it washes . 
 I'll pay attention to my handwriting next time . 
 Yes , I'm serious this time . 
 Very well . Thank you . 
 Do I have any fees to pay ? 
 How much ? 
 That ’ s unbelievable . 
 I want to pay all of it off today . 
 I ’ ll be paying with cash . 
 Certainly . As my colleague just mentioned , sustainability is a major concern when examining the potential output of a resource . Of course , as you can see from the content of our presentation today , with renewable resource , there is a much larger sustainability than with non-renewable resource . 
 Of course , what's the problem ? 
 Sure thing . 
 yes , it is . We've been dating for over 7 years . We have decided to get married on a special day and we think August 8th , 2008 is a red-letter day . 
 yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ... 
 almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive . 
 yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet . 
 that's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don ’ t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception . 
 thank you . 
 Hello , Mr . Hammer . Jack Ross here . I'm calling to confirm our appointment on Monday at ten o'clock in your office . 
 I'd like to bring Mr . Huang and Ms . Sun with me . 
 I know , but I think they may add something valuable to the discussion . 
 Yes , Mr . Hammer . 
 I don't think so . There's too much competition . 
 It tastes really great . Did you cook it ? 
 OK , just a little though . I'm really full . 
 What kind is it ? 
 No . This is my first time . How does it taste ? 
 Wow . It is good . Did you make that also ? 
 You're a really good cook . 
 That sounds good . Did you study cooking in school ? 
 Please come in , Steven . 
 Have a seat over there . How are things going out in the office ? 
 But , our business has been going down sharply the couple of months and we have to reduce some staff . 
 I'm afraid so . 
 You're the sales manager , but our sales didn't go up . 
 I feel sorry , but that's the decision of the directorate . 
 He's in the hospital resting . The doctor's didn't give a clear answer yet . 
 I hope so . 
 Yeah . I think my mom is the most worried . I'm basically worried about how she is doing . 
 She's in the hospital with my dad . I have to go back tonight . 
 You don't have to . 
 Ok . Let's go right after dinner . 
 That's right 
 Last night 
 Yes , I enjoyed it very much . 
 Let me see . Ah , yes , I've been to England , France , Germany , Italy and now I've been in Spain 
 Two weeks 
 That's right 
 Couldn't be better . 
 It looks like you have to buy tickets for us , Jason . And we're not going to see an action movie ! 
 I guess that's just the luck of the draw . 
 Sorry , not tonight ! 
 I haven't decided yet . 
 Ok , count me in . 
 I go to the personnel market every day , and put a lot of energy into it . 
 On the Internet ? I have never tried that way . 
 So how to apply for a job on the Internet ? 
 But how can I know which employer is hiring ? 
 Will the employers see my information ? 
 Is it safe to job hunt on the Internet ? 
 I will give it a try at once . 
 But it's raining . 
 Well , I think you are very good at doing the dishes , so maybe you should do them for another week . 
 OK , I'll do them . 
 I'd like to make a deposit please , into my granddaughter's account . It's her birthday on Friday . 
 Yes , right here . 
 Here ? And here ? 
 1,000 RIB . 
 It's an important birthday . 
 Why not send them short messages ? 
 Short messages will be kept in the short messages center . Once they open the handsets they will receive them , which is better than you can't find them . 
 I use short messages quite a lot . If it's not too complicated I will send a short message , which can save much phone charge . 
 I almost can't live without messages , from which I learn about weather forecasts and stock quotations . 
 Yeah , he came back from America last week . 
 He must have a good ear . 
 You mean you suspect him . 
 I hope I can do something for you . 
 You gossip ! What's the basis of your opinion ? 
 I don't believe it . Jean is such a kind lady . How could she do this ? 
 Maybe ! 
 How about these famous brands ? Such as pierre Cardin ... 
 Then you can try some local products.They ' re also of good quality . 
 Client Services ? Oh , hello . I need your help . 
 I'm a tourist in this city and unfortunately I've lost my card ! 
 Credit Card . The International Credit Card , I can't find it anywhere . 
 I'm not 100 % sure , around an hour ago I guess . I had it in the hotel lobby bar ; I used it to charge something to my room . I obviously didn't pick it up again . 
 Thank you . Thank you very much . 
 I am sorry . I can ’ t hear your very clearly . Could you say that again , please ? 
 Mark Wyatt ? I am sorry . The line is terrible.Could you spell that for me , please ? 
 W-Y-A-T-T , Got it . I haven ’ t heard of the name.Could you hold on the line when I check . 
 My computer isn't working . 
 I'm trying to turn it on , but it won't work . 
 Which ones are you referring to ? 
 Is that why it won't turn on ? 
 I did not know that . 
 I'm going to do that . 
 I got the job you recommended me for last week . 
 I really don't know how I can thank you enough . 
 Thank you very much indeed.You helped me rebuild my self-confidence . 
 That would be great . 
 Thank you.But it is too bright for me . 
 Let me try it on . I like that color . 
 But it is too loose.Do you have the smaller size ? 
 What a pity ! 
 Hello , Miss Wu , This is Dan Robson calling from OTC limited . I'd like to check my last order . When exactly was it sent out ? 
 Sure . No problem . 
 Sure . Do you have my number ? 
 No problem . I'll wait for your call . 
 How can you be so sure ? You haven ’ t been together with her , have you ? 
 Then try it yourself . 
 No , thank you . 
 On second thought , I will have a cup . 
 Good . I don't want to leave Beijing without visiting it . 
 It's about 5 kilometers . 
 I think so . We can go there in the afternoon if you like . 
 Of course . Generally speaking , dressing should be tidy and neat , and match well with your identity , age , and experience . 
 Professional suits may be the best choice . 
 Ladies should wear professional suits , either classical style or free style . It would be appropriate to wear a little or no make-up . 
 Name brand is not necessary . Anything decent will be fine . 
 Only when you dressing keep in accordance with that of other people around can you feel harmonious and relaxed . 
 In other words , too much emphasis on it is undoubtedly to neglect the essentials . 
 when I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ? 
 that's right . Why do you ask ? 
 when are you getting married ? 
 congratulations ! I had no idea . 
 do you like amusement parks ? 
 if you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you'll have a good time . 
 even those . It'll be very romantic , I think . You'll have loads of fun . 
 I'm sure he'll love the idea . Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it ! 
 Speaking . 
 Yes , I am . 
 It's a quarter to eight . I'm going to work . 
 I'm working on Saturday mornings this month.Are you getting up ? 
 OK . See you at noon . 
 I'd like to talk with you again about what happened . 
 Give me a book please , Jane . 
 No , not that one . The red one . 
 Yes , please . 
 Thank you . 
 Sounds not bad ! You know , the only thing I worried about is the safety . I ’ m not an active exerciser and my muscle may be not strong enough for such an intense sport . 
 I will think about it . 
 Could you please help me to check out the book ? 
 I can't remember that clearly . It probably be Charles ... 
 No , no , no . I'm not interested in literature . 
 Oh , sorry . I'm always absent-minded . I remember that I've put a note in my pocket . 
 I can't find it now . 
 Let me see . It's not fiction . It's biography . 
 Thanks . 
 There's a bookstore just across the street . 
 Hello . What time do you close , please ? 
 Oh . Ok . And are you open on the weekends ? 
 Wow . You guys never take a break ! I want to come in and have a look at your sale . Your sale is still on , isn't it ? 
 Ok , I'll come down tonight . Thanks . 
 OK darling , got some pizzas , potato chips , hot dogs and lots of cheese ! 
 Humph ! Right , so what did you get ? 
 Organic ? What ’ s organic ? Do we need organic carrots ... ? 
 Oh , so organic vegetables are the green option , right ? 
 Wait a minute , that ? ... Doughnuts ? They organic doughnuts , Kelly ? 
 I had a wonderful evening . 
 I will . 
 Er ... no , go ahead . 
 Nice to meet you , Karren . I'm Tim Wang . 
 Who gave my dog this cooked chicken bone ? 
 Didn't you know dogs shouldn't eat cooked chicken bones because they're bad for their stomachs ? 
 well , I finished my last final today . 
 do you want to attend the convocation ? 
 do you want to have them made or do you want to rent them ? 
 no . those you have to provide for yourself . 
 well , most of them only need a cap and gown for that particular convocation service , but some of the education majors have had them made , because they will be faculty members , and they'll need them f 
 Mary , don't move . Stand right there . It's a good shot . The background is very pretty . 
 it doesn't matter . Say'cheese ' . 
 Certainly . Ok , got you . 
 I am going to attend an interview . 
 My major is English . Of course I'll apply for an English teacher . 
 Why ? You said my skirt was beautiful just now . 
 Then what should I do ? 
 Welcome to our university ’ s fifties anniversary , Sir . Please have a seat . 
 Thank you . 
 Certainly . Mr . Lee ’ s office building at the south end of the campus , just beside the library . 
 Let me show you the way . Please follow me . 
 My pleasure . 
 It ’ s up on the second floor . You have to use the stairs . The elevator isn ’ t working . 
 Mary's is handling it . 
 Of course . Mary is our most experienced member . 
 Of course ! Where are the things ? 
 Right ! I'll do it straight away . 
 Hi , Dave . You're early . 
 I had an idea . 
 I'm sorry . I know you feel betrayed . 
 My mind is made up . 
 Wait a minute . It's $ 80.5 . 
 Sorry , sir . We accept cash only . 
 No problem . 
 Good . Anything else ? The tie pins ? The cuff links ? 
 Ok . We have several kinds of scarves here . Let me get them for you . Just wait a minute . 
 Dad , do you know where Mom is ? 
 She'd better not start crying like she usually does . 
 Dad , now don't you go getting mush on me . 
 That means a lot to me Dad . Thanks . 
 Hi , Tony . Haven ’ t seen you for a long time . How have you been ? 
 Yes , I've got a job , a waiter's job in a restaurant . 
 Well , $ 10 per hour , but I can keep the tips . That comes to roughly $ 80 every evening 
 Actually , there's still another opening . If you are interested , you ’ ll surely get it . 
 There ’ s no rush . You can see him tomorrow . I ’ Ve told him about you . He promised to give you the job . 
 Think nothing of it , Tony . I ’ m sure you ’ d do the same for me . 
 First of all , you must be punctual . You should be there before 6 p . m . so that you will have half an hour for preparation changing clothes and things like that . Then , remember you should smile . Smile to your customers all the time . Never pull a long face even If you feel awful that day . Anything else ? Oh , yes . Never argue with your boss . Learn to say ' Yes , sir . ' 
 You may put it that way if you like . Don ’ t worry . You ’ ll have no problem . 
 Who is the next one ? 
 Give the mike to him . 
 Be quiet . He is singing . 
 So did I . 
 Yes , he sings wonderfully . 
 I took them from a travel agency . Look at those nice pictures , lash forest , palm fringed , white sand beaches , crystal blue ocean , they ’ re breath-taking . It is like paradise on earth . 
 Yes , I ’ m thinking about signing up for a tour in the travel agency . Their next tour starts the same time as my holiday does next month . 
 10 days . When I get back , I still have two days to go before work . Isn ’ t that great ? 
 Lady , you look unhappy . What ’ s the beef ? 
 Good morning . I want to deposit 3,000 yuan in your bank . 
 No , I haven't . It is the first time for me to come to deposit money here . 
 Two years , please . 
 OK . What should I do if I want to draw my money before maturity date for an urgent use ? 
 I see . By the way , what if I forget to cash my money when the maturity comes ? 
 I see . 
 Just name it , sir . 
 Regrettably , we're currently out of filet mignon . May I suggest the porterhouse instead ? 
 Would you be interested in chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ? 
 Okay , no strawberries tonight . The items will be charged to your amenities account . 
 Our staff will bring you your order in as short a time as possible . 
 I don't know . Well , my contract here is for one year , and I don't know what I should do after that . Maybe going around for a while . 
 Actually , I am learning that now . But it's too hard for me . You know the four tones and the stuff . It really freaks me out . 
 You hit the nail right on the head . 
 What is it ? 
 Awesome . I've been giving this a lot of thought . When can we do this ? 
 Ok , cool . 
 No problem . 
 Let's eat out . 
 Her dress looks funny . 
 Are you kidding She is behind the times . That style went out last year . 
 Well , you ’ re really as out-dated as she is . 
 No wonder you never buy me a new dress . 
 Wrong number . 
 No , it is not . 
 Jane is going to quit her job in the bank . 
 It's true , but she says she is tired of counting others ' money . 
 Do you know what kind of internet you would like to get ? 
 You can either get dial-up or DEL . 
 DEL is the best choice . 
 It's a lot better because it doesn't tie up your phone line . 
 Well , with dial-up your internet is connected by your phone line . 
 That's right . You won't have that problem with DEL . 
 Yes . I have given all the designers notice of meeting by telephone . 
 Yes , I have prepared . I have also prepared a meeting memo . 
 I have also got them ready for the lecture . 
 Sure . 
 I have prepared name cards to be put on the conference table for everyone to sit by . What time would you like to provide the refreshment ? 
 Three other people started to bid . One called himself Buddhabuyer , so I knew he meant business . I raised my bid twice , but it kept going up . 
 I don't know . I dropped out at $ 250 . 
 No . It wasn't the super bargain I thought it was . 
 I don't know if anything terrible has happened . 
 We'd better prepare for the worst . 
 Good morning . 
 Yes , I want to change some money . 
 Thank you . 
 Did anyone call ? 
 What did he want ? 
 Hello , ma ’ am . Can I help you ? 
 What size are you looking for ? 
 How about this one ? I think it looks terrific on you . 
 Sure . The fitting room is on your right . 
 You look pretty in red . 
 $ 29.99 . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 I know ! It's gonna be great . But what kind of music do you think we should play ? 
 Hmm ... Vanilla Ice ? I know his most famous song , " Ice Ice Baby , " but I don't know his other songs . 
 Hello , Does my room have internet access ? 
 How do I use it ? 
 Ok . 
 Ok , thank you . 
 Yes . We are looking for someone who are well-educated and have all-round experience as a manager . 
 Great . What about having a formal interview on Monday next week ? 
 Good morning , sir . May I help you ? 
 Do you want it for yourself or for your girlfriend ? 
 Please excuse me for what I said just now . What do you think of this one ? 
 Sorry . It is the smallest size we have . 
 Oh , yes . There is a big one at the right corner of the street . Perhaps you will get one there . 
 I immigrated here last year . 
 I am an engineer in a mechanized farm . 
 Exercise . The morning hours are the most precious period within a single day . We should not pass them up easily . Seize the time and do something useful . 
 Usually , I run to the Black Bamboo Park as a warm-up . Admission is free . Then I start my activities . 
 No , I've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push-ups , sit-ups , bunny-hops , five-kilometer run , and so on . I alternate them over the weekdays . Sometimes , when I find myself in a bad state , I will simply idle about in the park . 
 It's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . I fear that if I fail to get up early one day , I may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . Besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . Here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . It's interesting to join them . 
 Excuse me . Is anyone in that seat next to you ? 
 Do you mind if I put my jacket there ? 
 Yes . And you ? 
 Well , there are many Chinese Americans , you know.And your English is very good . You sound like an American . 
 No , really . I can only hear a little accent . 
 Well , yes . Actually , I'm going back to visit . 
 No , I'm going back to America to visit . I'm from America , but I don't live there now . I live in Taichung . 
 Yes . Why not ? 
 Sure . I teach history in a university . Have you heard of Dong-Hai University ? 
 I have lived in Taichung for two years now.So this is the second time I am going back to states . I go back once a year to visit my family . 
 No , it isn't strange at all.Many people from Taiwan move to America too , you know.Do you think it is strange for them ? 
 I don ’ t know what I ’ m going to do ! It ’ s going to be impossible to make ends meet if I lose my job ! 
 it was a rather big mistake . When you work as an investment adviser , ONC small mistake can cost the company millions . 
 that ’ s true , but my supervisor is very dishonest . There ’ s no reason he needs to tell our boss the truth . I ’ m sure he will tell our boss that it was all my fault , and there ’ s nothing I can do about tha 
 I have enough to live off of for about 3 months . But I really don't want to spend my life savings on just living ! I ’ d rather invest my money somehow . 
 that ’ s very generous of you . I guess that would work . 
 I guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy . Maybe losing my job would be a good thing ! 
 Why ? 
 Yes , do you always gather to welcome new comers ? 
 Really ? 
 Hello , Mr . Brown . How are you today ? 
 that ’ s good to hear . Shall we get started ? I see from your application form that you ’ Ve worked as a maintenance man for over 7 years . 
 what kind of work did you do ? 
 That ’ s good . What kind of electrical work did you do ? 
 well , your work experience sounds good for the job we have open . Now tell me about the best job you ’ Ve ever had , please . 
 like the job you feel the most proud of . 
 Tell me something about a time when you did something well , something you feel proud of . 
 that ’ s great . No wonder you feel proud of that . Now let me ask you another question . 
 in all the jobs you ’ Ve had , what was it you disliked the most ? 
 all right . Do you have any questions ? 
 you ’ ll hear from us by the end of this week . 
 Do you have any certificate that has something to do with tourism ? 
 Why do you choose our travel agency ? 
 I'll always remember my college days . 
 It was one of the best times in my life . It was tough , but I made it . I became a college graduate . 
 It was a round day for me . My family attend the graduation ceremony . I was so nervous . I couldn't find my cap and gown , but all worked out in the end . 
 I was planning to attend gradate school , but then I was offered a good job doing marketing , so I changed my mind . 
 I sure am . So what about you ? How did you feel when you graduated ? 
 How could it be ? 
 You didn't have an offer ? 
 I think you lack in the power of decision . Once you make your decision , don't be overtaken by misgivings and fear . Just go full steam ahead ! 
 Non-smoking , please . 
 Certainly . When do you want to travel ? 
 Ok , no problem . What class of service would you like - soft sleeper or hard sleeper ? 
 The soft sleeper costs 600RMB one way and the hard sleeper is 400RMB one way . 
 Our supervisor Lester does . Actually , Lester is kind of like the kitchen god . 
 He just stays in the kitchen and watches you . Before the Chinese New Year , the kitchen god tells his boss whether you were good or bad this year . Just like Lester does ! 
 Actually , there's a way to keep the kitchen god from telling the bad things you did . 
 I think so ! Just serve a lot of sweet dishes next week . That will make the kitchen god say sweet things about you ! 
 And what happened ? 
 She has contributed to a new school . 
 I hear the school is very modern . It has the best equipments . 
 She said she would name it after her father . 
 Did you hear about car accident on Spring Road yesterday ? 
 Yes . I heard he had a few broken bones too , but that the doctors have set the fractures without any problems . 
 Yes . He was released from hospital yesterday evening . The other man could be there for weeks . 
 The hospital announced this morning that his condition is poor but stable . What does that mean ? 
 His family will be pleased to hear that . They must have been so worried . 
 fine , thanks . How are you ? 
 oh , my lord . I haven't really started them . 
 I know but I was busy with my part-time job the last few days . 
 to be honest with you , Jason , I don't think I'm doing a very good job of balancing my schoolwork with my job . I'm always two steps behind . I've got to get back to the dorm and continue writing tha 
 Your PC is so amazing . Are you doing trade on internet ? 
 I'm wondering if you often trade with others on the internet . 
 Oh , really ? Is it a good way ? 
 What advantages does it have ? 
 I agree with you . It will cost too much when going abroad to join the exhibition . 
 So cool , if we do business through other ways , it will cost a lot of time . 
 Will you give me some suggestion ? 
 Thank you . Maybe I will do business through internet in the future . 
 According to today's exchange rate , every US dollar in cash is equivalent to 0.75 euros . 
 We charge a 1 euro commission on each deal . How much would you like to change ? 
 No problem . 
 I have learned English for 10 years , and I have passed College English test level 4 and 6 . 
 I have taught myself Japanese in college , and I can carry on simple conversations in Japanese . 
 I have a driver's license , and two years of driving experience . 
 I am very familiar with Windows operating system . 
 No , but I have taken elective courses in computer in college . 
 I think I can work well under pressure . 
 Yes , what can I do for you ? 
 I see . Would you like me to reschedule you for another night ? 
 Certainly . 
 That's all right . I hope we can help you at some other time . Good-bye . 
 Hi , are you busy ? 
 Okay , I'm putting together a report on the Allied Marketing Co . failure , and I seem to have run into a stone wall . Can you help me out ? 
 You were there when the problem started . I was hoping you could fill me in on the details . 
 Name it . 
 All right , I can do that , and as soon as we finish this , we can both work on my problem . 
 Give me the study . I'll start as soon as I get back to my office . 
 Can you be serious for a moment , we've been dating for 6 months now , I really like you . I'd like to take a relationship to the next level . 
 It feels like you are not dedicate to our relationship . It seems like you treat it as a just casual dating . 
 I don't want to be like this . I think we should get step further . 
 Like what ? 
 It was only the cheek . 
 Oh , that is ridiculous . 
 Definitely not . 
 It's taking you forever to do my hair . 
 You should've been done already . 
 I don't think that you're done . 
 My hair looks hideous . 
 It doesn't look good at all . 
 I really hope that you didn't expect me to pay you for this . 
 Don't you have too much to do with him . 
 His father is a prisoner . 
 School has added several new courses to our grade this semester . I have more homework to do now . 
 I like science most . 
 Surprise ? 
 I do like PE , but I am interested in science . 
 Through this course , I can learn more about the world around us clearly . 
 Naughty ? I'm naughty ? I'm just clever . So I only do the things I am interested in . 
 Thanks for coming in today , did you have any trouble finding us ? Please take a seat . 
 So , let ’ s get started . tell me a bit about your educational background . 
 Interesting . And , your postgraduate studies ? 
 Very good . Now , tell me a little bit about your work experience . I see here that you previously worked at Oracle . 
 Interesting ... 
 You're here today to argue your ticket ? 
 Plead your case . 
 Were you speeding when you got pulled over ? 
 How fast were you going ? 
 Well , seeing as the officer that pulled you over isn't here , I'll let you go . 
 No , you don't . 
 Susan , we ’ re going to need those data before tomorrow . 
 Yeah ? All right . Thanks , Susan . 
 Would you care for a cup of tea before your meal ? 
 How about some Oolong tea ? It's very popular with our guests . 
 Mrs . Lin . Please hold all of my calls for the next hour . 
 Yes , I'll talk to her . 
 Do you know where you want to transfer to ? 
 What school would you like to go to ? 
 You honestly have no idea ? 
 You might as well stay here . 
 PCC is a wonderful institution . 
 So , what are you going to do ? 
 What are you grinning about ? 
 I thought mom said no dating till you are 16 . 
 All of your friends , what are you planning to do ? 
 What a party ! I hope you don ’ t expect the girls to fish . 
 Don't you ever cheat on me . 
 Because men like to cheat . 
 I'm watching you . 
 If I catch you , you'll be sorry . 
 I will poke your eyes out . 
 I will chop your toes off , one by one . 
 If I wanted to rent a van , how much would it cost ? 
 That sounds OK . I'll need it from the 10th to the 14th . 
 Yeah . Here . 
 How's your job search going ? 
 have you finished compiling your resume ? 
 that's good . Don't forget to design the format . An attractive format is as important as the content . 
 good . How about your cover letter ? 
 no , a CV is not enough . You should also attach it with a cover letter . Don't overlook it . You're faced with fierce competition in the job market . If your cover letter cannot stand out in the pile of 
 yes , you're right . All your preparation efforts are to help you land a job interview . 
 The numbers in this table don't seem to be in accord with reality . 
 I was just watching a documentary on tv about people use dogs for various purpose . It was very interesting . 
 The documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow . 
 Don ’ t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts . 
 Yes , I can . I don ’ t ride regularly though . How about you ? 
 What a good idea ! 
 You're welcome , Diane . I hope you can visit us again soon . 
 I am coming to inquire about the information of the company . When was this company established ? 
 Really ? That is amazing . 
 I feel sick . 
 Thank you . 
 No , thank you . I'll be all right as soon as the plane gets out of this turbulence . 
 I am very happy to know my work could be recognized by you and our company . 
 I really appreciate it . Thank you . 
 OK . Would you like to file them according to dates ? 
 Yes , I will . 
 When do you expect it to be finished ? 
 All right . 
 Does it mean anything ? 
 Why do you buy stocks , then ? 
 Now we have settled the terms of payment . Is it possible to effect shipment during September ? 
 Then when is the earliest we can expect shipment ? 
 That's too late . You see , November is the season for this commodity in our market , and our Customs formalities are rather complicated . 
 Besides , the flow through the marketing channels and the red tape involved take at least a couple of weeks . Thus , after shipment it will be four to five weeks altogether before the goods can reach our retailers . The goods must therefore be shipped before October ; otherwise we won't be in time for the selling season . 
 Mr . Brown , you certainly realize that the time of delivery is a matter of great importance to us . If we place our goods on the market at a time when all other importers have already sold their goods at profitable prices , we shall lose out . 
 That's too bad , but I sincerely hope you will give our request your special consideration . 
 But can't you find some way to get round your producers for an earlier delivery ? Make a special effort , please . A timely delivery means a lot to us . 
 What was that all about ? 
 Is she going to be okay ? 
 Dad , where is the Book Building ? 
 She said that when we get off the bus , the Book Building is right by the bus stop . 
 Oh , Dad , look at the sign , please ! 
 OK , Dad , it happens . 
 Come on , I'm too tired ! 
 Sure , I promise . 
 Hey , This is your order . 
 Yes . I started this part-time job just three days ago . And my internship will last 1 week . I'm still a student now . 
 Of course not . You know , there are many foreign customers like you here . And I think it's good for me to improve my oral English . 
 No , I'm not an English student . But I do like English . I'm going to be a volunteer in the 2008 Olympics where I want to be helpful with the language . So I try to improve my English . 
 Thank you , sir . But I'm not allowed to accept any tips . 
 Well , would you like something else ? The new-made cafe parfait is really good . Want some ? 
 Sure . If you want more coffee , please go over there . There is self-help coffee maker . 
 Oops . Well , wait for a while . We'll get it done quickly . 
 There's a new play tonight . 
 ' Romeo and Juliet ' . 
 It's about their great love . 
 Of course . Do you want to see it ? 
 No , I don't . 
 Good idea . Let's goa 
 Sorry , I need a trip to the bog . 
 Hello , let me introduce myself . I'm your neighbor . My name is Shirley . 
 Nice to meet you , too . 
 Here is a little gift for your family . It's a calendar with all the community events on it . I hope it can be helpful . 
 Since we are neighbors , if you need any help or anything , please come to me . 
 Oh , don't worry about that here . There are security guards on duty 24 hours a day and they patrol all over the neighborhood . You know , they are all very strong . 
 Of course . There is a Carrefour near the neighborhood . I'll show you there if you want to . 
 By the way , a party will be held for new neighbors the day after tomorrow . I hope I can see you there . 
 I'm sure he was off-side . 
 I think he favors the host team . 
 Excuse me , but I'm looking for a gift for my friend . 
 Well , it's a wedding gift . 
 Basically . But I have no idea what to get ! She's American and kind of ... 
 Doctor , here's my report for my IVP examination . 
 Oh , yes , is it dangerous ? 
 Do I have to have an operation ? 
 Good , I can still attend the Olympic Games . 
 Oh , I've heard a lot about the Chinese herbal medicine . I believe it will work . 
 If were you . I'd take a taxi . 
 You will find a taxi stand the street corner . 
 You're welcome . 
 Why not ? What about us doing it right now ? 
 So let's head there . We'd better hurry up . 
 Is it possible for me to buy some RIB at this counter ? 
 That's a relief ! I was a little worried about it ; I left England in a bit of a hurry . 
 Well , I'm only here for 3 days , so I think 500 GAP should be plenty . 
 Hey , Jim , you're 15 minutes late . What's up ? 
 Hurry up , the show is about to start . 
 Yes , I love to see the animal show . 
 I'm sure you'll love it . 
 Hello . Are you a friend of Helen's ? 
 My name is Phil . What's yours ? 
 Have you tried these little ditties ? They are really good . 
 Can I get you some punch ? I was just going to go get myself some . 
 How were you getting along with your studies ? 
 In addition to your major , did you have other fields to study ? 
 Sorry ! Excuse me ! I got your message . 
 That's OK . Just let it out . I'm OK ! I was out of town with ... Femi . 
 Taylor Smith . But not me . The pallbearers are carrying out the casket . It would be rude to just leave . Let's follow . 
 Yes . The baked fish was out of this world . 
 Can we have the bill now ? 
 Where are you going this weekend ? 
 So boring ! Shall we go out for a picnic with my friends ? 
 Fred and David , my college class mates and Rachel . 
 Your tent and enough food and water . 
 We can go fishing , chatting and camping . 
 Don't hurry . Wait for my call . 
 Let me see . We ’ ll try , but I ’ m not sure that we can remove it . 
 Any starch ? 
 Fastback Travel . How can I help you ? 
 He's on holiday for the week , I'm afraid . Can I help ? 
 Sure . 
 You'd better spell that ! 
 Right , I think I've got that . OK , what's the message ? 
 OK , will do . Bye . 
 It's getting late , Mary . 
 Why don't you sleep over ? 
 We can sleep together . 
 Don't forget to call your host mother to tell her . 
 I just heard your boy had taken the first place in the history test . He is super cool . 
 Marketing manage office , can I help you ? 
 Sorry , he's out . 
 Sorry , I am not sure , can I take a message ? 
 That's fine.please call again later . 
 Thank you for your interest in this job . You'll be hearing from us . Send the next applicant in on your way out , please . 
 It has been pleasant talking with you . 
 May I call you at your home about our final decision ? 
 We'll get in touch with you by next Wednesday . Thank you for your interest in this job . 
 Oh , Mary , come in , please . I'm so happy to see you . 
 Oh , thank you , Mary . You're so nice . 
 They're all waiting for you . Let's join them . I'm going to cut the cake soon . 
 How do you like the apartment ? 
 What ’ s wrong ? 
 That isn ’ t a problem . 
 What can I do ? 
 I can ’ t right now . 
 I will fix it for you . 
 It ’ s freezing in here ! Can I turn up the heat ? 
 Dad ! Are you serious ? What ’ s the point of having central heating if we can ’ t use it ! Look , I can see my breath ! 
 Dad ! I ’ m gonna catch a cold ! 
 Welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can I help you with , Sir ? 
 Unfortunately , no , I can't . But our specialist can . Please take a seat and our Mortgage Adviser will come out to see you . 
 No problem , Sir . He'll be with you in just a minute . Could I get you something to drink while you are waiting ? 
 Look , Bob . This is a photograph I took during my trip to Australia . 
 They ’ re people I met during the trip . That ’ s the ship we traveled on . 
 That ’ s the man I told you about . Remember ? 
 That ’ s right . 
 Guess ! 
 That ’ s right . I grew a beard during the trip , but I shaved it off when I came home . 
 My wife didn ’ t like it ! 
 Really ? Tell me about some of the plants they showed . 
 Is that type of plant found in this country ? 
 So would i . what other unusual plants did they show ? 
 That ’ s very specialized . So , the insects and the flowers rely on each other . If one became extinct , the other would too . 
 I see . The plants that fascinate me most are cacti . I find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions . 
 That ’ s why they often have long roots to find water spines instead of leaves , to reduce water loss . 
 That ’ s going to take a while to put together , Paul . 
 I ’ ll get to work on it right away . Anything else ? 
 Sure ! What kind of food would you like ? 
 I know the perfect place ! 
 It's right past that last building on the left . Do you want me to go with you ? 
 Glad you asked me to join you . This will be fun ! 
 sure . Where do you want to go ? Are you in the mood for anything in particular ? 
 dumplings again ? ! Oh , Amy , let's try something new ! 
 how about the Mongolian hot pot ? 
 maybe we can try Yuanyang pot this time . You can choose the non-spicy soup base . 
 yes . The sliced noodles they offer are among the most authentic Shanti cuisines . 
 wait a minute . Let me throw on a sweater . 
 10 fifteen a . m . 
 Sorry . You have to buy your ticket at the next counter . 
 How do you feel ? 
 You've had so long a flight . 
 Oh , I forgot about it . 
 Don't think so much . Take a good sleep and you'll feel better soon . 
 Fine , I'll take a taxi . 
 Never thought about it , I sure you are right . It's quite a short walk . 
 have you ever thought about your ideal home ? 
 what would it be like ? 
 how many rooms would it have ? 
 how many bedrooms would your dream home have ? 
 how would you decorate your house ? 
 how many TVs would your dream home have ? 
 We have a live show of a football match this Friday night . 
 Brazilian against AC Millan . 
 Hello , may I speak to Mr.Baker , please ? 
 This is Jones . Can I leave a message ? 
 Please tell him to call Mr.Baker at the Grand Restaurant . It's urgent . 
 Thank you . 
 My goodness ! What happened ? You have blood on your face . 
 How could you have the heart to kill it ? We only have one ! 
 Hello . I'd like to speak to Susan . 
 Isn't this the Whites ? 
 I'm calling 6667777 . Maybe my finger slipped and I touched the wrong number . 
 Oh , sorry to have bothered you . 
 Bye ! 
 Well , is it possible for you to effect shipment by the middle of June ? 
 Can you tell me the best way to look for an apartment ? 
 Is there any way to find a roommate to share an apartment with ? 
 What do landlords charge for rent ? 
 There are two of us , but we only need a one-bedroom apartment . 
 I really would appreciate it if you could come look at apartments with me . 
 I am thinking about inviting you to a dinner . When would you have time ? And what kind of food do you fancy ? 
 To thank you for helping me at work last week . If you would not have been so kind , I would not have been able to pick my parents from the airport . You really did me a big favor . Thank you so much . 
 Fine , I know a good hotpot place in the downtown area , food there is pretty spicy too . Shall we try that one ? 
 Are you an American ? 
 Why don't you speak English ? 
 Oh , do you like Chinese ? 
 I want to study German . Can we exchange lessons ? 
 When will we begin ? 
 That's all right . 
 Absolutely . Mm , this is really good . 
 I'd love to . 
 I want to check these three pieces and I'll carry this carry-on bag with me on board . 
 Yes , it is . 
 Sure.How about this carry-on bag ? 
 How much should I pay for the excess weight ? 
 I'm done . Can I watch TV ? 
 Uh ! I can't swallow them , Mom ! 
 Do I have to take them ? 
 Yuck ! 
 Welcome . How can I help you ? 
 This way please . We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers . 
 Your T-zone gets oily easily , but your cheeks are dry in winter . Am I right ? 
 This " Cream of Olives " is our bestseller for combination skin . You can try it on your hand . 
 All right . Anything else ? 
 My pleasure . 
 What are you reading ? 
 Didn ’ t he sell worthless stocks to people or something ? He got arrested for that , didn ’ t he ? 
 If I remember , he got off with a light sentence . Something like three years in a minimum-security prison . 
 I think the government fined him a small amount , and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts . He ’ s still a millionaire . 
 I know . And some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes $ 500 at most and ends up in jail for five to ten years . 
 Is that right ? This is a brand new outfit . 
 I went to Macy's and picked it out . 
 Well , I think you look nice today too . 
 I think that those are some really nice shoes . What kind are they ? 
 Your shoes look really nice . How much did you get them for ? 
 I'm going to go get a pair for myself . 
 Well . Have you got his permission ? 
 What ’ s your name , please ? 
 Why should I buy this MD player ? 
 What else ? 
 But how's the sound quality ? 
 Is that it ? 
 That was a very interesting presentation , Ms . Wang . My colleagues and I are very impressed with your proposal . 
 To show our appreciation for your hard work , we'd like to invite you to have dinner with us . 
 Excellent . Have you had French food before ? 
 We need to take the accounts system offline to carry out the upgrade . But don't worry , it won't cause too much inconvenience . We're going to do it over the weekend . 
 We'll be taking everything offline in about two hours ' time . It'll be down for a minimum of twelve hours . If everything goes according to plan , it should be up again by 6 pm on Saturday . 
 No-no-no , sorry ! That's a handicapped parking space . Are you handicapped ? 
 Sorry , but you'll have to park in a normal space . 
 Be patient , miss . It'll just be a second . 
 Right , let me run through your options . You can go ahead and cash your undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate if you really want to , but I'd recommend a Personal Durable Commodities Loan . 
 It's not too much trouble to do it this way and remember , your certificate is due in 2 months . If you can hold on to it , it'll be much better for your finances . 
 Not at all , Mr Zu . As the certificate is due in 2 months , you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate . 
 Exactly right . If you'd like to go ahead , I can process that for you now , Mr Zu . 
 We need to do a group report tomorrow . I need to go to the stationer to buy something for the posters . 
 absolutely . Every time when we do the reports , we love making some beautiful posters to emphasize our theme ideas . 
 No problem . I need some markers , some color pencils , a pair of scissors , some highlighter , rulers .. 
 Don't worry.In fact , it is very easy to find what you want . Can you see the sign on top of every shelf . It clearly tells you what things are displayed on every shelf . 
 I also need some thumbtacks , whiteout and paper clips . Which shelf are they on ? I can't find the number . 
 How do you like you trip ? 
 That's interesting . I will go with you . 
 Don't worry . There are so many people . We will join the touring party . 
 Good morning , sir . May I help you ? 
 Certainly sir . May I have your room key , please ? 
 Just a moment , please . I'll draw up your bill for you ... Thank you for waiting , sir . Your bill totals two thousand six hundred and fifty-eight yuan , including the phone and laundry . 
 Not at all , sir . Here you are . 
 Just a moment , sir . I'll calculate that for you . It comes to 305 dollars and 52 cents at today's exchange rate . 
 How would you like to make the payment ? 
 Thank you , sir ... Here is your change . Could you check it , please ? Thank you for choosing our hotel . I hope you enjoyed your stay . 
 Certainly , sir . We hope you have a good trip . 
 Well ! You like sea food ? 
 Then I'd like to suggest you try Anchor Inn on Seaside Drive . 
 No , you can walk from here . 
 You know , if I can keep up my workouts , I think I have a chance in 2004 . 
 In gymnastics . I'm pretty flexible . Look ! I can even touch my toes ! 
 I do back flips at the pool all the time . 
 Yes , here is my Certificate of Nurse . 
 I learnt nursing through theory and practice for 3 years at Hunan Nursing School . 
 Yes , pretty well . I have started learning English since primary school . 
 It sounds nice , but don't forget this is a seedy , run-down neighborhood . 
 It's a bit small but looks nice.What ' s more , it's only ten minutes ' walk to the company . 
 If you don't mind , I'd rather you didn't . I have a cold and feel chilly . 
 I'd appreciate it if you would . 
 Have you got some nice apples in stock today ?

 Yeah ! 
 OK , I'll expected you around 2 o'clock ? 
 Hello , this is David . 
 Sure ! How about the coffee shop right across the street from my office ? 
 Does five thirty work for you ? 
 Is it the plans for my new house ?

 For the past 3 years , I have been working in China East Airlines Corporation Limited . I'm very tolerant of people and have been told that this is one of my strengths . I feel I have a lot to offer as a team member . 
 It's always been my dream to be a stewardess . And I like travelling to different places . 
 Well , a stewardess should be friendly , courteous , patient and treat passengers kindly and politely . 
 No , I know how to control my temper . 
 I would give him or her basic first aid and ask my partner to call for assistance at the same time . 
 I can begin to work right away because I am out of work now . 
 I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . I'd like to postpone that discussion until later . Maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position and how your commission structure works . 
 Hello , yes , I opened an L / C with you recently . We opened it 7 days ago . 
 We would like to amend it , please . 
 It's all agreed , here's a letter to prove it . 
 Miss Green , do you have life insurance right now ? 
 This year our company is offering a new plan especially for single people like you . I think you might be interested . 
 It's OK . I'll leave the pamphlet here . If you need more information , you can call me any time .

 Do you think what I did to Elvin was out of line ? 
 Elvin doesn't want any programming help . He wants all the glory for himself . 
 Did you hear the names he was calling me ? 
 What shall we do tonight ? 
 That's a good idea.We haven't been there for ages . 
 Oh , I don't know.It depends . 
 Yes , I'm going to the cinema , dad . 
 Oh , I won't be back so early . The film will be over at nine . Can I have the key to the bicycle ? 
 Oh , dad , I'm not a child . I'm 17 already . I'll come back as soon as the film is over . 
 I will . Thank you , dad . 
 You're so careless , Billy . 
 I've done it for you . 
 First , you fill out the application form and then we'll issue you a passbook . 
 No , Even a dollar is all right.Here ' s your passbook , sir ; just sign your name on it . 
 It varies from time to time.At present it is 6 % . 
 By all means.But you have to deposit enough money before you can write out your checks . 
 What was wrong ? 
 I didn ’ t mean to hurt anyone . 
 Sam , we are hard up for the everyday expenses . When can you find a job . 
 You liar , I saw you again in the inn . I bet you don't want to work at all . 
 Okay.But our baby has fallen sleep . 
 But where's the switch ? 
 Excuse me , would you please tell me where I can find a telephone ? 
 How do you use a public phone ? 
 Adam , I'm sorry ! 
 Yes , but I couldn't help it . I was late getting off work for a start , and then I missed the bus . The bus I did catch got caught in a traffic jam . It was one thing after another . 
 Yes , but there's a rush on at the moment , and my boss asked me to do some urgent letters . 
 Well , no . I thought I'd finish in about five minutes , and I didn't want to be difficult about just a few minutes . If it hadn't been for missing the bus and the traffic , I wouldn't have been so late . I'm sorry . 
 What are you reading ? You've had your nose buried in that book since last night . 
 I haven't read a book like that for as long as I can remember . 
 Can I read it when you're finished ? 
 Don't tell me anything about it . I want to read it for myself . 
 Where did this come from ? 
 this bloody computer ! 
 my computer just crashed again for the third time today ! 
 i was just opening up an attachment in an email about winning the lottery . 
 oh , no ! I thought it seemed a bit strange . 
 it's a PC . doesn't everyone have a PC in this office ? 
 what's the difference ? 
 I didn't know that . 
 yes . 
 fortunately , I saved my work right before it crashed , so it should be OK . 
 that's a good idea . I'll call them now . Thanks for your help ! 
 Hi , Daddy . It ’ s me , Troy . 
 It ’ s nice . I arrived safely . 
 I ’ m fine . Is everything fine in the family ? 
 The weather is gorgeous here . 
 I will . Thank you , Dad . 
 I love you , too , Dad . Bye . 
 I think it is good if we know enough about career planning . We will make wiser choices . What else did he tell you about it ? 
 Sounds practical ! To be honest , sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career . I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills . 
 Ok , then we can sign up for it together . 
 It is ' www . job . com ' 
 No . I can text the address to you if you are not clear about it 
 Yeah . Look , other kids are coming this way . 
 That's because regular buses don't stop here . 
 Nothing . It's free . 
 Let's go sit in the back . All the cool kids do . 
 He's very strict with us . 
 Indeed . He's strict with himself , too . We can see every lecture of his is well-prepared . 
 I wouldn't say so . 
 Well , I thought he was , but he ends up to be a con man . 
 Sure . What do you expect to know ? 
 And you shouldn't miss the Louvre Museum . You can stay there for at least a whole day . 
 The night life there . It's so romantic ! 
 I went there in August , and it was hot . But I was told autumn is the best season . 
 when do most children start school in your country ? 
 How much time do primary school students usually spend at school every day ? 
 do they have to go to school on Saturdays ? 
 how many subjects do they have to study ? 
 do students have to wear uniforms in schools in America ? 
 did you go to a public school or a private school ? 
 I went to a boarding school from nursery school to senior high school . 
 yes , they were horrible . We had to wear green every day ! 
 that's true ! 
 Yes . Ms . Gray . Is there something wrong ? 
 I ’ m sorry , Ms . Gray . I must have lost track of the time . I ’ ll get back to work , now . 
 Yes , I have booked a room for 24th . It's a double room . 
 Well , now I want to change the date from 24th to 28th . 
 Good morning , can I help you ? 
 When ? 
 The flight number is Cz353 . it departs at 17:10 and arrives at 45 . 
 Your passport , please . 
 My mascara's waterproof ! 
 No . There's makeup remover for waterproof mascara . 
 Yep . See how long and curly my lashes are ? 
 Thanks ! 
 OK . It will make your stay more convenient . 
 No , you can return it to any branch of our company . 
 What a shame ! 
 How do you do , Jack . Nice to meet you . 
 Yes , you are right . After all , the quality of your air conditioners is good . The only problem is price . 
 That's why I came to your office today . We think for your model WE - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable , because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579-649 . 
 I see your point . That's to say s 611 each set . Still it's much higher than the market price . Could you see your way to reduce the price , Jack ? 
 All right . We accept it . So $ 600 for each set . 
 Can I help you ? 
 To buy or to rent ? 
 How much do you want to pay ? 
 Well , I've got one here . It's 260 a month . 
 It's got a kitchen , a bathroom , and one bedroom . 
 Yes , I think so . There is also an interesting one.It ' s opposite the park . 
 It's 325 a month . It's the biggest we've got in this area . 
 Well , There're two bedrooms , a sitting room , a kitchen and a bathroom . 
 Of course , Sir . 
 Good morning , Mr . Smith . 
 Well , thank you , Mr . Smith . But I was just doing my job . 
 It's nice of you to say so . 
 I've got a sore throat and my chest hurts . 
 It has been two or three days . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Thank you . 
 Thank you for inquiring . But your enquiry is too vague to reply . 
 Ok . I need to discuss it with our manager . We'll let you have our firm offer next week . 
 Ok . I will reply to you as soon as possible . 
 I am , as a matter of fact . Do you have any special requests ? 
 Wait . This is sounding like a major list . Why don't you just come with me ? 
 Don't be silly . Let's go Dutch . 
 Yes , speaking . Anything I can do for you ? 
 Where is the interview happening ? 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Well , I think you should go for our manger . I will call him here . 
 Why do you like this computer ? 
 I'm going to have to do some shopping today . 
 I want to find a new bedroom set . 
 I have no clue . 
 I don't know where to go to find a nice bedroom set . 
 Please do . 
 Are the bedroom sets at IKEA affordable ? 
 Were you at the scene during the robbery ? 
 Were you able to see a lot ? 
 What happened ? 
 Could you see his face ? 
 Was he with someone else ? 
 Would you be willing to come down to the station for further questioning ? 
 I have the chills and an upset stomach . 
 For most of the week . 
 What do you think I should do ? 
 Hello , Janet . 
 And what is this ? 
 And when is your son's birthday ? 
 But Mark's birthday is in April so I need to think about his present soon . 
 Oh , my birthday is in December just before Xmas so of course nobody remembers . 
 You're acting weird tonight . 
 What brought this on ? 
 Excuse me , may I help you ? 
 Sure , Please wait a moment . 
 No problem . 
 Yes . Please give me your ID card , a photo . 
 Then you have to give me 15 dollars for the deposit . The library card is free . 
 Of course , as long as the card is well kept . 
 You are welcome . 
 Don't worry , but my clothes are made of leathers . 
 Thank you for your warning . 
 Be careful of yourself . 
 I'm going to do some shopping . 
 What's on TV tonight ? Is there a football match ? 
 Really ? Who will play ? 
 That's cool . I'll watch it . 
 There is no doubt that the Brazilian team will win . 
 what did you do last night ? 
 did you watch the Barcelona versus Madrid game ? 
 what were the results of the game ? 
 what was the actual score ? 
 really ? I thought Barcelona was going to win . They are a much better team than Madrid . 
 what happened ? 
 that explains it . 
 that was the last game before the playoffs . 
 in a few weeks . Are you planning on watching them ? 
 Me , too ! Do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place ? I'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together . 
 Ok , it's a date then ! 
 Thank you , I just tried my best . I am very happy to know you like it . 
 Well , yes . Several colleagues from different departments helped me with that . They are very supportive . I consulted an economic expert last week . He was very kind to give valuable suggestions . 
 Come on , don ’ t flatter me anymore . I took the job because I love being challenged . But I can ’ t get this turned around without the support from you people . 
 Oh , yes . Beautiful . 
 No , I am from France . 
 It has been 12 years since it was founded in 1998 . 
 Yes . And it was incorporated with other businesses in 2008 due to the global financial crisis . 
 Yes . I just checked in , but I need to change my room . 
 I reserved a non-smoking room , but the smell of smoke in this room is so strong that I can ’ t endure it . 
 That ’ s ok . Thanks . 
 Sure . What's it , Yvonne ? 
 Okay , you take one end and I'll take the other . 
 Let me see it . 
 It ’ s a letter from NYU . 
 I didn ’ t get in . 
 I ’ m not lying . 
 I had high hopes for NYU . 
 Hopefully , I ’ ll get accepted to UCLA . 
 Give me a break . 
 Yes , please bring us two steaks . 
 What vegetables come with the steaks ? 
 We have successfully fulfilled our work plan . In fact , we are No . 1 in terms of market share . 
 I hope we can continue to get support from the departments concerned . 
 Now please tell me something about your past work achievements . 
 That is quite an achievement ! Do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ? 
 Have you received any honors ? 
 Do you have any publications ? 
 Okay , now I ’ d like to find out more about your last job . I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly , is that right ? 
 So , what changed ? 
 Wow , a real step up ! 
 I see , so why did you decide to leave finally ? 
 Going to the cafeteria ? 
 That ’ s fine with me . I don ’ t hate vegetables and I don ’ t eat much during lunch . 
 Welcome to our school . If you need any help , please come to me . 
 Look , how grand magnificent the Tiananmen Gate tour is ! 
 It is largest pop square in the world.you see that is monument for the people's hero , and the Chairman Mao memorial hall on the south.there is great hall of the people on the west.there are two museums on the east . 
 That's the Forbidden city on the north of Gate building . 
 At what age do children start school in your country ? 
 Do boys and girls go to school together ? 
 Do you think this is a good idea ? 
 Do some children go on to university ? 
 What examinations do they take first ? 
 How long do you usually stay at university ? 
 What about driving to Shanghai ? 
 I just thought it would be an interesting way to see lots of places . How long will it take ? 
 What a pity . 
 Here you are.That comes to 120 yuan . 
 Certainly , sir.Would you sign here , please ? ... Thank you . 
 Yes , the weather sure is nice today . 
 That sounds like a good idea.The sky is clear , the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot . 
 Hey , this spot in the shade looks really comfortable . 
 I don't think so . I say the weather report last night , and it said the weather should be fine all day . 
 Did your meal meet with your approval ? 
 How about a dessert to top off that wonderful meal ? 
 On this evening's dessert list , we have chocolate mousse cake , homemade fresh strawberry shortcake , and a spicy rum apple crisp . 
 One dessert will serve two , so would you like to split a second one ? 
 How about some coffee and tea as well ? 
 I will prepare your desserts and have someone bring you your drinks right away . 
 Excuse me , ma'am . Can you tell me where the nearest postoffice is ? 
 Do you mean that I go that way for one block , then turn right ? 
 Is it far ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Albert ? Could you co-sign this approval sheet ? Accounting ’ s getting really picky . 
 Right here . It ’ s for that new fax machine we ’ re getting . 
 Garage sale , what does that mean ? 
 How much is the tape record ? 
 That's really cheap . I will take it . 
 Sorry to bother you . But I ’ m having a small problem I thought you might be able to help me with . 
 Well , it is about Ms . Connors , the landlord of our rented house . 
 The dishwasher broke down . I had the repair done and deducted the cost from the rent check . 
 She is threatening to evict us for not paying the full rent . 
 Well , you are over at the law school . So I wondered if you would mind coming with me when we talk to Ms . Connors . We ’ re supposed to meet with her tomorrow night at eight . 
 Thanks a million , you are a lifesaver . 
 well , I spend a lot of time watching movies . 
 oh really , Frank ? What kind of movies do you like ? 
 art films are my favorite , but thrillers are cool , too . 
 sure . I enjoy both of them very much . 
 once in a while , I suppose , I usually rent movies at Movie Salon . 
 it's a movie rental store in my neighborhood . I've got a membership there . 
 yes , you can find almost all new releases there . 
 why not ? 
 It's difficult to explain . 
 Well , I had a terrible day of work , I'm thinking of quiting my job . 
 I don't know , I can't stand my job these days . 
 What did you do last vacation ? 
 What will you do this vacation ? 
 Mr . Brown is in hospital again . 
 When I went to see him yesterday , he looked rather pale . 
 Have you been taken care of ? 
 Is there any special brand you'd like ? 
 The franchised store is on the second floor . 
 It is reported that the temperature is going to drop dramatically tonight . 
 Yes . So you'd better dress warmly before you go out . 
 Brooke , I have bad news . 
 I called the airlines to reconfirm the reservations today . 
 I'm sorry . I didn't reconfirm in time and they gave away half of the seats . 
 They said that they did . I've been so busy ... 
 I didn't think there would be a problem . 
 I'm sorry . We're still going . I got reservations for all of us on the 31st . It will be OK . Trust me . 
 Brooke ! 
 I'd like a dozen long-stemmed roses . 
 Yes , I'd like them sent to this address . 
 No , could you just write your secret admirer on it for me ? I don't want her to recognize my handwriting . 
 May I speak to Marry Lin please ? 
 When will she be back ? 
 I think I need some iced water , too . Is there an extra charge for that ? 
 That's fine . Could you give me some more napkins , too ? 
 Yes . I would also like some sweet-and-sour sauce and pepper . 
 Do I owe you for the sauce , pepper and napkins ? 
 Excuse me , waiter , would you please give us a menu ? 
 Well , do you have a menu in Chinese ? 
 May I help you ? 
 Certainly . These are thirty yuan each and these are twenty-five . 
 How about these ? They are nine yuan each . 
 Not at all . 
 Yes , nobody was with her . 
 In Thailand . 
 Yes . yes , I am sure . 
 Quite sure . I mean that hair of hers and the voice of hers . 
 Here you are.It ' s 90 yuan , miss . 
 20 percent is the best discount I can offer . That will came to 72yuan . 
 Thanks , Miss . I want you to see our new stock of brocade satin , a splendid line , just came in . 
 I'll just have this all wrapped up for you . 
 I think it's my ankle . 
 One of my snowshoes got caught on a rock . 
 I don't think so.It ' s kind of sore . 
 Is that really necessary ? 
 About the same . 
 Should we be here , Alice ? I don't think it's that serious . 
 I hope not.It isn't that busy . 
 Yes , they do . It's great for them to tie the knot and get married . 
 Nothing seems to be happier for them . 
 First of all , you should pay attention to what you eat . Don't eat too much food with high calories , such as chocolate , ice cream and the like . 
 Stay away from fried foods . Fried foods are fried in oil or fat . 
 Do not be a couch potato . You should do more exercise . 
 Let's skip The X-files tonight , Fran . Okay ? Just this once ? 
 How did you know ! There's a program on ancient Egypt tonight . 
 Look , it's starting ! 
 Hello , miss . I would like to check out . 
 Why ? I have stayed for 3 nights . 
 How was your trip to Brazil ? Did you learn anything ? 
 Tell me about it . 
 Really ? 
 Are you serious ? 
 Excuse me , are you Dr . Smith ? 
 I'm David , Joanna's husband . She has to be at work late today . So she asked me to pick you up here . 
 My pleasure . 
 Ms . Yang , can you tell us in what ways the new EBB is better than the old model ? 
 Excuse me , but what are the Mbps mainly used for ? 
 Before you go on , Ms Yang , could you tell us if the original EBB sold well in the U . S . ? 
 Good evening , miss . Want some socks ? 
 Yes.But I recommend you to buy pantyhose . The stockings are already out-dated . 
 Good evening , madam . Can I help you ? 
 Anything wrong with it ? 
 Oh , how awful ! May I have a look at the invoice ? 
 Well . please accept our sincere apologies , I'll be glad to change it for another one if you wish . 
 We're sorry that this has happened , and I guarantee that the same mistake won't happen again . 
 What's Net Love ? 
 Ridiculous ! They haven't met ! Maybe they're the same sex ! 
 How could you know ? 
 Do you know ' He ' is Ms . Rebecca ! 
 Impossible ! 
 Me neither ! Would you like to go in and buy her a gift together ? 
 We need to think about what she might like . What are her interests ? 
 You know , maybe we could get her some concert tickets . Who would know her favorite groups ? 
 Yeah , Malia would be able to help us choose a concert . 
 Good ! Maybe Malia would like to go in with us on this gift . 
 Mom , can I have some ice cream ? 
 Mom , can I have one more piece of cake ? 
 Hey , The Cosby Show is on ! 
 That's right . 
 I'm watching reruns of it . 
 That means our local TV station is showing old episodes . You can watch reruns of nearly every old sitcom . 
 It bears a great many of advantages , but also some weak points . 
 For instance , the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study . 
 Actually , it's not the fault of the mobile phone . But people should have a proper attitude towards it . Mobile phone is a tool serving people , not the fetters restricting them . 
 Why ? 
 With snow in Kunming ? That's crazy ! 
 Susan , I'm sorry . Did you look up those files I requested ? 
 I couldn't find the files you request , even though I checked all the cross-references . I don't think it's there . 
 Well , let me check again under a different heading . 
 Maybe that's why I couldn't find it . All the documents on Nova are filed under ' V ' . 
 Left for the fork and right for the knife . Just remember that the stronger one is for knife . 
 Sure . Rather than eating , having western food is more about western culture . 
 Cindy has reserved a table for us at a newly opened western restaurant downtown . She said the environment there was really pleasant . 
 You should put on the black suit I bought for you last week . But I'm afraid it may be a bit crumpled . You'd better iron it now . 
 There is no need to do that . I think the restaurant accepts credit cards . But it's necessary to make a budget . 
 It seems that it's all about me . Then what do you do ? 
 OK then . Well , 50 Yuan for appetizer , 200 Yuan for dinner and 200 Yuan for wine . Anything else ? 
 OK , then 50 Yuan for dessert . 500 Yuan all together . 
 Yeah . I go shopping once a week 
 What do you mean ? I can't understand . 
 Really ? That's unbelievable . 
 No problem . Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer , and you're good to go . 
 Hmm . Well , we have some alternatives , if you're interested . 
 We have a computer lab on the first floor . 
 It's absolutely free to guests . Except for printing , of course . 
 You could use your wireless right here in our lobby . 
 Well , we don't have a printer in the lobby yet . You'll have to use the lab . 
 It sure is.Can I see your ticket ? OK , fine . 
 About two hours out of Los Angeles . Give me the bags , I'll put'em on the bus . Here's your claim tag . Don't lose it.When you get off the bus , give it to me . 
 Is it all right to smoke on the bus ? 
 I see . Thank you . 
 Hello Mike . How are things going for you ? 
 Fine . Everything is just fine . 
 Mike , I enjoyed your company , but I am getting ready to graduate soon . I really need to focus on my studies . 
 It would be better for me to just deal with getting my work done , but thank you for a lovely dinner . 
 I'd love to . 
 Sure ... what's up ? 
 Sure ... 
 Well , Vincent has only been CEO for a couple of years and ... well ... um ... 
 Really ? And what led you to this conclusion ? 
 Well , I confess I've had my doubts about his abilities before . It seems he mainly got the job because his famous aunt pulled some strings . 
 Me too . But what can we do ? This isn't a reality TV show ... we can't just vote him out . 
 Interesting idea . You might be on to something . 
 What's the trouble ? 
 What about your friend ? Did she fall for him ? 
 Now you don't have the butterflies in your stomach , do you ? 
 Hi . Fill it up please . Premium . 
 Oh , can you check my oil and tires while you're at it ? 
 OK , it's open . 
 Oh . Where can I add some air to my tires ? 
 Good . How much does it come to ? 
 How was the movie last night ? 
 Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography . 
 She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see . 
 Nothing is to your satisfaction . 
 Really ? Are you sure ? 
 Yeah but , it is something that you will have forever ! They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment . On top of all that , I have heard it hurts a lot ! 
 Of course ! They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink . 
 I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos . Also , find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles , and that the place is hygienic . 
 Hello . City News . Can I help you ? 
 Okay . What ’ s your account number ? 
 And your address , please ? 
 When do you want it cancelled ? 
 Okay . 
 It was exciting ! 
 I'm pretty tired these days . 
 I have so much house work to do . I have to take care of the kids , cook , clean , laundry , and the cycle never ends . 
 Not at all . He comes home and complains about his hard day at work . He expects me to do everything . He even wants me to feed him sometimes . Can you believe that ? 
 If he wasn't so lazy , I think I wouldn't have any complaints . He mows the lawn , but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it ? 
 Oh well . I'll have to live with it . What else can I do ? 
 Sure . If you want to stretch your legs , a good exercise is to lift your knee in front of your body , like this . It ’ s a very simple exercise , but very effective . 
 One good way is to do push-ups . Another way is to use weights . Make sure you grip the weights firmly . You don ’ t want to drop them on your feet ! 
 You don ’ t need to bend your elbows that much . Bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle . The most important thing is to remember to keep your body straight . Many people bend the 
 One that I recommend is that you lie on your back . You should have a weight in each hand and stretch your arms out side of your body . 
 Yes , you do . Lift the weight up , keeping your arms straight all the time . 
 I want to buy some running shoes . Maybe New Balance . 
 But I exercise at the club . And I use the stepping machine.So I need good running shoes . 
 What's the difference ? 
 And what are running-shoe-style shoes ? 
 But they aren't as light , right ? 
 That's what I want.For exercising at the club . I can even spend 100 dollars on them . I don't care . 
 My sister has New Balance running shoes . I want shoes just like hers . I don't care if they're expensive . And they look cool too . 
 I want the best.My sister said good shoes are very important . For support . They support your feet . 
 No , but she exercises more than me . 
 Here it is . This is what my sister has . 
 I wonder if they have my size . 
 Here in America , it's six . 
 It's none of your business . Let me try them on . 
 What do you mean ? 
 She is really something . 
 Yeah , it is ! Why is it so expensive ? 
 I don ’ t think it ’ s worth that money . 
 We have a holiday next week , don't we ? 
 What're you going to do ? 
 At cars ! You aren't thinking about buying a car , are you ? 
 But it will be expensive to have a car in the city , won't it ? 
 But what about parking ? You can't park on the street , can you ? 
 I ’ m afraid I spoke in all of the table clock . 
 I ’ m terribly sorry , Won ’ t you let me pay for ? 
 Hey , let ’ s pull over and look at that house over there . 
 Yes , it is on our list . 
 Let ’ s sign the registry . The realtor looks kind of busy right now . 
 Oh look , they have some refreshments in here . 
 Does it say how much they are asking for this house ? 
 How ’ s everything with you today ? 
 What can I do for you ? 
 Do you know which account you want to take the money from ? 
 Where are you transferring the money to ? 
 How much ? 
 Will that be all ? 
 Here comes the bus . 
 Hello ! 
 Please allow me to introduce myself . My name is Tom . 
 Yes , I did . Have you lived here long ? 
 No , not really . When I left Vietnam , I came to America and I lived with a cousin in Dallas for two years . Where do you work , Alice ? 
 I am an accountant at a company 
 It's nice meeting you too , Alice . 
 Goodbye , Alice . 
 It was funny . 
 Well , we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning . It was a magnificent sight . 
 Sure , we wouldn't miss it for anything . After that , we took a short cut to the park . There was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour . 
 We went for a swim in the sea . That was the best part of the day . Just look at my nice tan . 
 Yes , you're right . And I was so tired that I fell asleep on the way back . My arms are still stiff from the swim yesterday . 
 Though he's not the one who can get the highest score , yet , on the whole , he is comparable to the best . 
 I mean he's a student developing all round . 
 But you promised to play chess with me this afternoon . 
 So what ? 
 I don't care about baseball.You know I need to practice for the chess championship and you promised to help with me if I washed the dishes for you last Sunday , and I did . 
 When ? 
 And then , it'll be dinner time , then homework , and then your Show is on.You are going to break your promise . 
 Well , I'd rather do it the way we set up.But if you promise to give me your best game , it's ok with me . 
 Do you think we can go driving right now ? 
 Buckle up . 
 Now you put the key in the ignition and start the car . 
 Make a left on this next street . 
 Keep going until I tell you to stop . 
 That's all for today , so park right there . 
 Excuse me . May I have a bus map , please ? 
 Yes , within New York . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , I'd like to change Australian dollars for RIB . 
 I am not sure . What's the rate today ? 
 What was the rate yesterday ? 
 Oh , the rate goes down . 
 Let me think ... Will the rate still go down tomorrow ? 
 Well , I want to change 1000 Australian dollars for RIB . 
 OK . 
 Thank you very much . 
 I'm ready now . I'd like the roast chicken and a side order of corn . 
 I'll pass on the soup , but I'd like a garden salad . 
 Yes , I'd like a glass of iced tea . 
 Thank you . 
 Not particularly . I was rather disappointed . 
 I ’ d expected it to be much more exciting . 
 Really ? Why ? 
 Oh , it's unbelievable . She is such a chain smoker . 
 Oh , she is going to be a great mother . 
 We should make it , if there isn't too much traffic . 
 Yes , but don't worry . We'll make it . 
 Well , I felt like baking , so I made some muffins . 
 Sure , I'll take mine , sunny side up . 
 You know , my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for twenty years . It drove my mom crazy ! 
 You ’ re so picky sometimes . 
 I said sunny side up ! How many times do I have to tell you . 
 Good idea ! I finish work at five . Why don ’ t we meet at six ? 
 Let ’ s meet in front of the train station . 
 Ok , see you tonight ! Don ’ t be late ! 
 After you . 
 Oh , yes . 
 Yes . Thank you . 
 And ? 
 All right . 
 Thank you for your reminding . 
 I can't wait to see it . 
 Is that you , Janice ? Just speaking . 
 So sorry to hear that . What's wrong with you ? 
 Is that serious ? You ought to see a doctor . 
 That's good . Do you suppose you will be back at company the day after tomorrow ? 
 Well , take care of yourself . And hope you will be better as soon as possible . 
 Are there many accidents in the city every day ? 
 Please drive slowly , we've got lots of time . Safety first . 
 Would you please tell me what places are worth visiting ? 
 So , Lauren , I just wanted to talk to you quickly about our new customer support representative , Jason Huntley . 
 Basically , I ’ Ve got a few concerns about him , and the bottom line is , I don ’ t think he ’ s a good fit for our company . 
 Yeah , his attitude is great , but he ’ s really unreliable.Sometimes he ’ s really productive , but then other times ... take last Tuesday for instance , he was forty-five minutes late for our morning meeting ! 
 But that ’ s not the only thing ... you know , he really doesn ’ t have the best work ethic , I ’ m constantly catching him on MSN and Facebook when he should be talking to clients . 
 Make it work , Geoff . You would say that , wouldn ’ t you , he is your cousin.what a jerk , make me hire your stupid , useless , cousin . 
 Tea and silk . 
 Preferably at the big department stores . 
 It's all over . I'm bankrupt . 
 why are you so upset today , Maria ? Cheer up ! 
 it ’ s a great opportunity . You should be happy with the offer . 
 why ? It ’ s unfair . You can learn a lot from it . 
 that may be true . But I ’ m sure you ’ re able to find a balance between them . Why not try it ? 
 I agree with you but I think you really need to talk to your mother and tell her what's on your mind . 
 just let her know that the experience will be both amazing and rewarding . And more importantly , you can manage both your study and the job . 
 sure . Every cloud has its silver lining . Just try . 
 sure . Good luck , Maria ! 
 Well , let me see . What price range do you have in mind ? 
 How about this one ? This is just $ 20 . It's worth every penny of it . 
 If you ask me , I don ’ t think it ’ s guilty . 
 I mean it ’ s not his fault . 
 Yes . Don ’ t you think he should be pitied rather than accused ? 
 Yes . I promise it will not happen again . 
 We will inform you as soon as possible . 
 Oh , you are so nice . What a lovely scarf . 
 Of course , I like it very much . Thank you . 
 It's whatever you're planning on cooking . 
 No , I always cook . 
 Don't give me that . If you're hungry , then cook dinner . 
 Look , I'm really tired tonight . I don't feel like cooking dinner . 
 Thank you . I'm going to bed . 
 Yes , please . 
 I don't know why , but I think there's something wrong with my hands . I couldn't seem to be able to control it on the first ball . 
 Then why couldn't I get strike on the first ball ? 
 Really ? I will try again . 
 I hope that they have a good menu . Most coffee shops only have coffee and Danish . 
 No , so it's usually boring to join my friends in the afternoon at a regular coffee shop . 
 Maybe a fruit salad and a few different hot sandwiches at least . 
 Let's try it ! 
 That ’ s a good idea . I haven ’ t been in a while and I need to get a new backpack . The old one is hanging on by a thread ! 
 Did you hear about that accident on the 5 ? There was a sixty-two-car pile up . 
 Early this morning . 
 Yeah . And a semi jack-knifed trying to miss a stalled car in the fast lane . You can imagine what happened after that . 
 The count is up to seven right now and several are in critical condition . 
 We have settled the question of price , quality and quantity . Now I am calling to talk about the terms of payment . What are your terms of payment ? 
 I see . Payment by LC is the safest method , but could you make an exception and accept DA or DP ? 
 What about the cost of delivery ? 
 When should I make my presence known ? 
 What department did you study in ? 
 Why do you choose the Law School ? 
 May I borrow your typewriter ? 
 Until the end of the week . 
 Hello , Mr Mayhew . How are you today ? 
 Would you like a balance inquiry first , Mr Mayhew ? 
 Your balance is 21,290 RIB . How much would you like to take out today ? 
 Actually , I have a suggestion for you . We've started a new service called Entrusting Deposit Combination - Have you heard about this ? 
 Let's see if we forget anything . 
 Yes , let's go . Lock the door , please . 
 Hey , Michael . Remember me ? I'm Becky . We used to work at Lemans together . 
 It's about the same . I've been thinking of making a change myself . Do you mind if I ask you a few things about your job at the university ? 
 Well , I was wondering what the salaries are like ? I mean ... are they much lower than the corporate world ? 
 Yeah , that's what I thought . But , I've heard that the perks are better . I was wondering if that was really true . 
 Oh , that's great . It sounds like you're really happy with your move . 
 What part did you get in the play this time ? 
 I wish I had a character part . Those are my favorite . 
 I know , but I've done that so Ay times . It's getting old . The leading guy is always the same macho A . 
 Next time . You are going to love your part . I've seen the script . 
 Hey Jack . Are you excited about starting work ? 
 What was more exciting , starting college or starting work ? 
 For me , I think starting school was more exciting . 
 It's different for everyone , but because I knew school was going to be so much fun , I really got excited about it . 
 That's a great attitude to have . I don't think you'll have any problems in the workforce . 
 Morning , Zina . Just wanted to say thanks again ! 
 Oh , yeah . I'm glad you mentioned that . I think we need to hire somebody new to manage it . 
 I think he's got too much on his plate . 
 I'd like to sit in the rear . 
 Yes 
 Wine , please . 
 Something real Australian . 
 Yes . That would be fine . 
 I'll have Chicken and Ginger Burger with Chilli Dressing . 
 Yes , I did . 
 I don't think much of the film . 
 Oh , I'm not sure I agree with you . It was not a good one , but it was not the worst one . Actually , it wasn't too bad . 
 What's more , some scenes were good , much fit for the children . 
 Well , sir . We are asking all our guests to wear a jacket and a tie in our restaurant . 
 I am sorry ; you can't borrow a jacket and a tie . 
 Certainly , what time will you come back ? 
 How many in your party ? 
 Alright , we are waiting for you at 7 . 
 Irrevocable letter of credit , of course . It's the normal terms of payment in international business . 
 You might consult your bank and see if you could reduce the required deposit to a minimum . 
 Well . As you understand , the irrevocable L / C gives the exports additional protection of the banker ’ s guarantee . We always ask for L / C for our exports , and the other way around , we pay by L / C for our imports . We only accept L / C for regular orders . 
 We have various transportation services . Would you prefer a private vehicle ? 
 May I suggest a limo ? It's nice to pamper yourself . 
 I understand . And where will you be going ? 
 And what time would you like to be picked up ? 
 A taxi will be here shortly , sir . 
 A taxi it is , sir . 
 Here's your bill . 
 Certainly . 
 Goodbye . Hope to see you again . 
 No , I haven't . 
 No , I don't drink . 
 I've got some cigars . 
 Two small boxes . 
 It's definitely your size . 
 How do you prefer to pay ? 
 Now , if you'll just sign here . 
 I hope you enjoy your purchase . Good-bye . 
 I feel my greatest asset is perseverance , that is , the ability to stick to things to get them done . 
 I feel a sense of accomplishment when I finish a job and it turned out just as I'd planned . 
 Not yet . I'm not finished with my research yet . 
 Reading my fashion magazines ! How do you think I know so much about all the latest trends ? 
 Duh ... That's the point . The people in the ads are wearing what's in . Plus , there are articles on new trends . 
 Oh , I'm sorry . I didn't see the stop sign at the corner . I didn't mean it . 
 Oh , sorry , I don't have it on me . Honestly , I forgot it at the house . But I have the insurance policy with me . Here it is . 
 I understand , officer . I guess it's just not my day today . I will accept the fine . 
 Yes , I am . I really don't know anyone . 
 My name is Bill . How are your lessons going ? 
 I prefer to learn English . In my opinion , English is easier than Chinese . 
 You are right . 
 Um , okay . Well , I just want a trim . Nothing too fancy . 
 Okay . Um ... can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top . 
 Um ... no . 
 Have you ever played Making ? 
 Yes , some friends play it all day , all night , and sometimes a whole weekend . I tried to read about some basic rules online , but it is hard to understand . So I went to watch people play yesterday only to find I was even more confused . I think I have to work hard on those rules and more learning by doing . Practice makes the master . 
 It is important to keep your mind up-to-date and active . 
 There's a copy machine on the first floor in our computer lab , sir . 
 It's ten cents a copy , sir . 
 A dime is still a bargain , sir . 
 Who do you know there ? 
 I see . 
 Yeah , but it isn't more expensive than international calls . 
 Easy . Dial the area code for Connecticut ; then dial your friend's number . 
 Check the local time before you call . You don't want to wake your friend up by accident . 
 We have over sixty employees . We have about forty factory workers and technical people and the rest are admin and sales staff . We started off with only ten people , so our workforce has grown a lot . 
 It was just over two million euros last year . 
 Oh , no ! Not again . 
 You can say that again . The sunny shining and there ’ s pleasant raise . it ’ s so lovely 
 That ’ s correct . we have four seasons of spring 
 my friend and her fiance had a really good idea . They have cut out pictures from catalogues and pasted them in a notebook . The picture are of things they want . People sign their name b 
 most of the things were household appliance . You know , everything from an iron through a vacuum cleaner to a cooker . I think it ’ s an excellent way for everyone who knows the couple to help 
 I bought a sewing machine . I know that my friend likes making her own clothes , but her current sewing machine is quite old and has some problems . 
 she says that after several years of use , it ’ s not working properly . When she uses it , it makes a funny noise . 
 I think it ’ s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models . Because they know that we will buy the new models , the appliances don ’ t need to last more than five or ten year 
 How long will you be there ? 
 So you'll have a tour of the famous city . 
 I ’ d better be going . 
 I wish I could , but It ’ s already late . 
 thank you for wonderful meat . 
 Are there any hobbies you do ? 
 Oh , you actually do that ? 
 Did you always know how to draw and paint ? 
 You had an art class ? 
 Well , it's good that you're so talented . 
 Talent is a great thing , I wish I had one . 
 Excuse me , which one is of the highest quality here ? 
 That is nice . But I don't quite like the collar . 
 I don't care what others wear . How much is it ? 
 Really ? Too expensive . I don't think I can afford it . 
 OK , anyway , let me have it . 
 Thank you . 
 That's all right.We ' ll get used to it.Besides , it is quiet up there.We ' re little further away from the street and traffic noise and there's no one living over us . 
 Yes , it's pretty bright in there and big enough for our children to play . 
 The stove and refrigerator are in good working order , and I don't see any loose electric wiring that could cause fires . 
 The plumbing seems OK , too.The toilet flushes and the shower has hot and cold water , and the sinks don't seem to leak . 
 Are you going anywhere for your vacation ? 
 That'll be lovely . Where are you going ? 
 Well , you've got to prepare a lot of food and enough sleeping bags then . 
 It sounds good . You can do a lot of sightseeing , too . 
 So , you're going to have a really nice vacation . 
 Can you tell that I ’ m excited ? 
 I voted today . 
 I just turned 18 a month ago . 
 What do you mean ? 
 I didn ’ t even think of that . 
 I really didn ’ t , but I ’ m still excited . 
 What are you doing , awake ? 
 But it's almost midnight ! 
 Really ? How do you know it was Santa ? 
 Hmm ... well I know that Santa won't come down the chimney with you hiding behind the tree , spying on him ! 
 Really ! Let's go back upstairs and get back to bed . That way , we can let Santa do his job . Then when you wake up , it will be Christmas already ! 
 Hey , honey ! Is that you ? Don't eat all the cookies — I want some , too ! 
 Sure . I am free tomorrow . It sounds interesting to me . Can we buy the ticket online ? 
 I guess that is the thing we can do with we really want to visit the museum . 
 Yeah . We are lucky . Let's go buy the tickets first . We can have breakfast later . I am so hungry . 
 ( After the breakfast ) Which floor is the art exhibition we are going to ? 
 Sure , take your time . We have a whole day . 
 Look at the museum guide.It says there are also some sculptures and potteries in this area . Let's rent an audio guide . 
 I cannot , Mum . Nobody can help me ! 
 I have lots of work to do . What ’ s more , my grandma is ill . 
 Are you cold ? 
 I wonder if we can change the temperature . 
 There must be buttons . How do they turn it on and off ? 
 Well , they have it too cold in here . I want to be warmer . I won't be able to sleep . 
 What did they say about the air conditioning ? 
 That's stupid . How can I sleep in this ? 
 Who's your favorite singer ? 
 My god , it's such a lovely lake ! The lake has a water surface of 56 square kilometers . 
 We are now walking on what is in fact an island . Here we get one of the 10 sceneries of the West Lake , Autumn Moon over the Calm Lake . 
 It's so named because in the pavilion over there the great poet Bai Buyi of the Tang Dynasty would take a rest after drinking a little too much , and watch the moon over the lake . 
 Now let's board the boat and have a ride on the lake . 
 Wang , what's that building over there ? It looks like some sort of a huge pavilion . 
 Which aisle has the produce ? 
 Are cherries on sale today ? 
 I'm so glad we decided to go on a cruise for our vacation . 
 Ah , that's all part of the fun . What do you think of these shorts ? 
 They are . I think I'm going to get a hat too . 
 Wow . You look great . 
 Do you know which stop we get off at ? 
 We've been on this bus for a while now . 
 Should we have gotten off the bus already ? 
 I thought you knew . 
 Really ? 
 I'm never catching the bus with you again . 
 Shall we for go out for a meal this evening ? 
 We can go to that new Chinese restaurant . 
 Come on , let ’ s try it . 
 Hi , Alice , what are you doing this sunday ? 
 If you are free , maybe you would like to go to a small party and having for my birthday party . It will be fun , you will get to know lots of people . 
 Around six pm . 
 No . thank you . I can handle it , but thanks for the offer . 
 Great , have a good day , thanks again for the offer . 
 Oh , I'm terribly sorry . but I couldn't find the yoghurt I saw here last time . 
 San Yuan . 
 I'm not used to other brands . 
 OK . I hope so . 
 Really ? What can I do ? 
 Umm , OK . Whatever you think will help . 
 Can you use the thinning shears on top , too ? My hair is really thick . 
 Hi , I'm back ! Hmm ... your hair is pretty damaged , and you've got split ends . 
 Well , the trim should fix the split ends , but you might need a deep conditioning treatment . 
 I'm also going to add some layers to frame your face . 
 No problem ! 
 I don ’ t think so . I think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking . 
 No , you can ’ t suddenly make smoking illegal , but government could prohibit smoking in public places like movies and theatres . 
 Yes.We have in stock a variety of styles and they are in different colors.What do you think of this one ? 
 It's made in China . The quality is excellent . 
 May I help you , sir ? 
 What color do you want ? 
 What size are you ? 
 No problem . I think 40 will be fine for you . 
 Of course . The fitting room is this way , please . 
 Good evening . I'll have a Scotch . 
 On the rocks , please . 
 Yes , the food you have just sent here is cool.Would you please heat them up ? 
 That's fine . Quickly please , we are so hungry . 
 Yes , I'm teaching math at Lincoln High School . 
 Well , the salary is a little low , but the students are nice . How are things with you ? 
 Now that's an exciting job ! ! ! 
 May I see your ticket and passport , PLS ? 
 Any luggage ? 
 Your backpack is very big and today's flight is quite full . I am afraid that you will have to check your backpack too . 
 You can take that with you . 
 No problem . I'll give you an aisle seat in the center row . And here is your ticket , passport and boarding pass . Please board the plane at Gate 15 . 
 15mins before the plane takes off . The plane is scheduled to leave on time . 
 You are welcome ! Have a nice flight . 
 Well , it's a short distance flight , so we don't serve meals . But there are some drinks . 
 He is so kind . I couldn ’ t believe he murdered his wife . 
 I don ’ t understand . 
 Where were decorating and I ’ m going to ask some things . 
 Shall we need at 1 fifteen this Thursday ? We definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit . 
 I am calling to tell you that you are hired by our company . 
 You are welcome , Please call me if you change your mind . 
 How long is the warranty ? 
 How about the repairs after the warranty expire ? Are you responsible for the fixing if the machine breaks down after the warranty period ? 
 Will you supply spare parts if we want them ? 
 I can see by your resume here that you studied business administration . 
 So I wonder why you want to work for a newspaper . 
 But journalism , it is a very different profession from administration.You know a lot about administration.Why don't you choose to work for a company looking for managers ? 
 A new reporter must expect to work many hours . 
 How long does it take to get to downtown from here ? 
 What companies do we have in our neighborhood ? 
 Does the 7th floor belong to our company too ? 
 It ’ s such a large firm . Do we have our own staff restaurant ? 
 Tomorrow is my day off . I wonder if it's convenient to change our appointment from tomorrow to next Wednesday , still at the same time . 
 It's a shame.Will this afternoon be all right ? But I can only spare you an hour and a half today , from four o'clock . 
 I'd like to send this to Chicago . 
 Air mail , please . 
 Make it special delivery , please . 
 Excuse me , can you suggest a good book for me to read ? 
 Do you have an English-Chinese dictionary ? 
 I come to try my new suit . Here's the receipt . 
 Aren't the trousers a little too long ? 
 Very well . Thank you . 
 Excuse me . Could you tell me if the bus goes the national history museum ? 
 I see . Where do I have to change them ? 
 How far is it ? 
 I see . Thanks a lot . 
 I don't know why people are just mad about David Peckham . Is there really anything so fascinating with him ? 
 you mean he plays well ? Yeah , he often scores by free kicks in crucial games . But a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks . 
 In the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . After all , the majority of his fans are girls . 
 and he is English ! He makes a model gentleman when he puts on a black suit and speaks with a typical British accent . 
 I called in sick . 
 I think housing is a big problem . There are thousands of homeless people on the streets . 
 I have a good idea to solve it . The government could provide some money for homeless people to build their own homes . 
 I think the government can afford it . Besides , there are many advantages . Homeless people would find it easier to get jobs if they had an address . They would learn some useful skill for finding jobs i 
 If we are to invest more money to education , we will need to raise taxes . That wouldn ’ t be popular with voters . 
 The government should show that it is using money efficiently . Sometimes you hear about how the government has wasted money on a project . 
 Hi , waiting for the bus ? Where are you going ? 
 Why don't you take a taxi ? It'll get you there much faster . 
 Dad , I ’ d like to borrow some money . 
 Come on , Dad , I need thirty thousand . I wanna get into the market . You know , I ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . I look at this as an opportunity . This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg . 
 But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity . And anyway , I ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example , they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity . 
 Fine , then ! If that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . But you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ’ m going to go hit up Mum for the cash . 
 He spoke evil behind his back . 
 Someone told joe off . 
 Sure . He ’ ll get the bag . I think . 
 You ’ re welcome . What ’ s the problem ? 
 Where exactly is the pipe ? 
 How long has the pipe been leaking ? 
 I must tell you that in order to get to the pipe , I must tear down that wall . 
 That won ’ t be a problem ? 
 All right , I will start working now . 
 Good morning , Miss Mandy . How are you today ? 
 Have you got a sore throat , too ? 
 Yes , I see . Go home to bed and take one of these pills every three hours . 
 Hi , Bob . 
 Passed . 
 Excuse me , can you tell me the way to Holton railway station ? 
 I think I ’ m going in the wrong direction , aren ’ t ? 
 Yes , I do . They are about two miles away , right ? 
 So , right at the traffic lights two miles up the road , then left at the plaza hotel , a mile along that road . Got it . 
 Ok . Got it . Thanks for you help . 
 It is really exciting news . 
 You don ’ t know ? The company is going to replace these old computers with the latest ones . 
 We will all get a docking station on our own desk from which you can remove your laptop easily . And if you come back to office , you just reconnect your laptop with docking station . 
 This is a kind of socket mounted to your desk . The socket has all the wire connections of the company line and all the other office automation equipments , like fax , copier , a screen , printer and scanner , and it will be very convenient . 
 Why not come over to work in my company ? 
 Tell me what you need . 
 Is his father a worker ? 
 No wonder his son is so clever . 
 Yes , please . I'd like to buy a gift for my younger brother . He's going to take a trip to South America . 
 By air . So my gift should be quite light . What can you suggest ? 
 My sister already gave him one . I like something unusual . 
 Oh , a nice handkerchief . That's a great idea . I'll take it . 
 I'm at home painting . 
 I enjoy oil painting . I learned it in one of my extra classes in college . 
 Hobbies are never too late to learn . They offer a variety of classes at the local community college . You should look into it . 
 Good afternoon , Mr Meng . It's a little late for you , isn't it ? 
 What can I help you with ? 
 Mmmm ... yes , many investors don't seem to be into stocks at the moment . Too risky ! How about Open-Ended funds ? 
 Exactly . Then each individual has the chance to diversify their portfolio over many different areas , it doesn't have to be stocks . And , we provide a Professional Fund Manager , so you know your investment will be safe with us . 
 Our Investment Financing Service will help you choose where to put your funds and look at both the pros and cons of each . 
 Guess what ! I know something you don't know ! 
 How many planets are there in the solar system ? 
 Not anymore ! Can you believe it ? They've decided that Pluto is not a planet anymore ! 
 I'm dead serious . They've decided that it's too small to be a planet , but actually they haven't yet agreed on how big something has to be in order to be a planet anymore . 
 Yes , they can . If you remember correctly , people used to believe that the world was flat . 
 We actually know relatively little about space and the cosmos . 
 I suppose we could actually live on a planet outside of the milky way . 
 I hope not . I think they would be a threat to those of us that lived on Earth . 
 Point taken . Hopefully one day , we'll live in an interplanetary society . 
 Here are some biscuits . Why are you back so early today ? 
 Me what ? 
 It's not for us . 
 Don't be a smarty-pants . It's for Grandma Wang . 
 It's for Grandma Wang . She is sick and her only daughter went abroad weeks ago . So she needs our help . 
 Umm , let me think for a moment . We can meet her together after I finish cooking . 
 Good boy . I can only imagine how happy she will be to see you . 
 sure . i suppose you dance much . 
 but i can see you dance wonderfully well . 
 no , just occasionally 
 i'm afraid i can't dance well . 
 I've had enough . 
 Mark , this is Lucy . 
 I have a friend . He is my best friend and he wants to learn English . He would pay about 100 yuan per hour . Are you interested ? 
 So I take it you are not interested . 
 Don't worry . My friend says he can always arrange his schedule around your schedule . 
 Let's do it this way . I'll take him to your place this Saturday . Then you two can make a schedule . 
 How are you going to get there ? 
 I am sure my friend can give you a ride . 
 He is a lawyer . 
 See you . 
 Can you describe your health concern ? 
 Are you in pain ? 
 Would Tuesday or Wednesday be best for you ? 
 I will write you in for that day at 4 
 I will write you in on that doctor ’ s schedule . See you then . 
 Usually we have a month off . 
 I'll stay at home and have a complete rest . 
 All I usually have is some cereal for breakfast . 
 I sometimes run late in the morning , and can't make breakfast . 
 Tell me what you eat in the morning . 
 That sounds like a great breakfast . 
 That sounds like a very quick meal . 
 I think I'm going to make myself some oatmeal and toast . 
 I'm still suffering from a little jetlag . 
 Saturday morning cartoons . 
 I think watching them is a great way to learn English . 
 Yeah . Is Cindy up ? 
 I have to move . 
 I can ’ t stay here anymore . 
 What is the problem ? 
 Why not ? 
 But I need it back . 
 It will be impossible for me to stay here . 
 Waitress . 
 Please clean up the table . 
 I like a refill please . 
 Good afternoon Miss , would you be interested in buying more life insurance ? You know , you can never get enough . 
 Are you sure he ’ s purchased enough insurance for both of you ? If something terrible happened with your husband , and he doesn ’ t have sufficient insurance , my company does have a policy that could cover you and your husband if something happened to either of you . 
 Could we sit and look at the policy I mentioned and see if that ’ s something suitable for you and your husband ? 
 Do you have anything to declare ? 
 OK . You'll have to pay duty for the whisky . 
 Please wait a moment . I'll make out the duty memo . Here you are . Take this and pay the people over there . 
 Very well . I hope you'll enjoy your stay in China . 
 Are you free tonight ? 
 Tomorrow is Halloween , I know I'm ready . I bought two pumpkins and a big bags of candy . Do you want to help me a jack-o-lantern ? 
 They are supposed to say trick or treat ? Then the neighbors are supposed to hand up the candy . 
 Usually it's the older kids going around playing Halloween , like punching the pumpkins left outside people's doors or - - someone's tree . They usually do it late at night after little kids go 
 Usually be adults , you don't have kids have a big party in get dressed up too . 
 Are you ready for a second ? 
 Would you like anything else ? 
 I'm sorry.It ' s out of season now . 
 David , how is your interview ? 
 Just fine . I tried to answer every question raised by HR carefully . I found some answering skills are useful . These questions are different from exams . 
 Don't be rush . It is suggested to write a letter for the Personnel Department of Future Clothes Company . 
 Just to show your gratitude to the chance and tell them your impression on the company . And you can mention some details in your own interview to remind them of you . 
 Mister , I have an account now . 
 Six tens will be fine . 
 Thanks . Er , mister , if I want to deposit checks next time . what should I do ? 
 What can I do for you , madam ? 
 How about this one ? 
 They're three hundred dollars . 
 OK , This one is one hundred and twenty . It's the cheapest here . 
 Thank you very much . 
 I just lost my job . I'm just worried about how I'm going to pay the bills . 
 I just started , but the job market is very bad right now . I'm not optimistic about it . 
 She's trying to be supportive , but I can tell she is very worried about our financial situation as well . 
 I really appreciate your help . 
 Hi ! Someone has reported a fault on one of your copiers . 
 When was it serviced ? 
 What's actually wrong with it ? 
 I'm sure it's nothing serious , probably just a minor fault . I'll have a look at it . 
 You got a raise ? 
 You got promoted ? 
 You won a lottery ? Don ’ t beat around the bush , just tell me , please . 
 In order to extend our export business to your country , we wish to enter into direct business relations with you . 
 Our hope is to establish mutual beneficial trading relations between us . 
 I would like to return these books . 
 I dropped it , and the cover tore off . 
 How much ? 
 That ’ s not too bad . 
 Here ’ s the money for the book . 
 You are very welcome . 
 That's right . I've only had some part-time jobs working in department stores . 
 Yes , I liked math in school . 
 Yes , I enjoy working with people . 
 Yes , I had an American tutor for two years . I had two lessons under her every week . Would I be using English every day is this job ? 
 No , I'm afraid I don't . I'd be glad to learn . 
 I'll be seeing you around . 
 May I try this on ? 
 What material is it made of ? 
 That's good.Cotton is soft and flexible . 
 Yes , I want to a room for tomorrow . 
 A single one with a private bath . 
 It doesn't matter . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Yes , look over there . That's the Empire State Building . My book says it's 102 stories tall . 
 You're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering . 
 Quite a number . Actually every skyscraper has a history . A few blocks ahead we'll see St.Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center . It's a landmark in the history of architecture . 
 Well then , there's a Central Park . Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world . 
 Most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the world . And there are lots of very expensive places . 
 May I ask you something ? 
 How many hours behind the wheel do I need ? 
 I'm trying to get my license . 
 Can I do all six hours in one day ? 
 That's all I have to do ? 
 Well , that's a relief . 
 Oh , it was great . We had seafood buffet . They do one every Friday . The waiters and waitresses are very good . They are very attentive , but don ’ t hang around the table . 
 Yes , so do I . they have wines from all over the world . There is a good range of prices to suit every pocket . We ordered some Australian red wine , which tasted delicious and wasn ’ t expensive . 
 They had almost every kind of seafood . There were oyster , shrimp , prawns , crabs , and fish . I ate a lot of smoked salmon . 
 No , they didn ’ t . you could order it from the menu . I think that lobster is too expensive to be included in the buffet . 
 I know . I didn ’ t eat any , but a few people in our group did and no one got sick . 
 Not usually . I usually just order a main course and have a dessert if I ’ m still hungry afterwards . 
 No , I might have a soup if it ’ s a cold winter day . 
 Well , I am looking for some winter clothes for my fiancee . 
 Really ? What's that ? 
 I think my fiancee may favor the sweater in the shop window . Would you like to help me look for any skirts that go with this sweater ? 
 I especially like this flowery skirts . My fiancee will look very elegant in this . 
 I don't think the green one fits her complexion . Do you have any skirts in light color or tan ? 
 Oh , yes . I'll take this one . Can I pay by traveler ’ s check ? 
 Hello , are you Muriel Douglas ? 
 Yes , you too . Thanks for agreeing to meet with us about the new account . My associate , Susan Kim , should be here any minute . Would you like something to drink while we're waiting ? 
 Yes , I did . My family and I went to Tahoe to ski and the weather was great . How about you ? 
 How did you like it ? 
 No , not much . My wife doesn't like to ski . She prefers vacationing where it's warmer , like Hawaii . 
 Yes , me too . Oh , here's Susan now . Let me introduce you . 
 Oh , no . I don't think I'm in that good form . 
 To where exactly ? 
 That's still too far for me . 
 Sure . Do you think that the total is wrong or that you got something marked wrong that should have been marked right ? 
 Let's just go over all of it to double-check . 
 Here is the answer sheet . Do you see a place where I marked something wrong that should have been right ? 
 OK , now that we've gotten those straightened out , let's total the score . 
 Well , if I total that like this and divide by this number , I get this total . Do you agree ? 
 Well then , we are all straight . Have a good day and thanks for bringing that to my attention . 
 Can you recommend some popular tour ? 
 Two weeks and I would like to go abroad . 
 Yes , of course . I will book the tour . 
 We've got several kinds . All are made of different materials . 
 Well , here is one made of duralumin . That's cheap and durable . Over there we've also got some made of stainless steel , and those over there are enamel ones . 
 Yes , sir . Stainless steel products are always popular . 
 Mike , you're late again . 
 Do you think I believe the story like that ? 
 How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ? 
 Ok , hold it . Remember to be punctual next time 。 
 You'd better . 
 Good ! They have expanded and are doing better than they were last quarter . It's nice to see some improvement for a change . 
 Yes , especially with so many of our executives going back and forth from here to Japan . The only problem is , they may have trouble when they go to open up business here . 
 They aren't too familiar with doing business outside of Japan . There are a lot of cultural differences to account for . 
 Have you ever been to Japan ? 
 Tell me something about your Valentine's Day . 
 So romantic . Young people must have lot of fun . 
 Good morning , sir ! Can I help you ? 
 Yes , sir . We have many trains going to Beijing , fast train , through train , express train and tourist train . Which train do you prefer ? 
 Then you'll have two choices . Train No . 14 leaves at 6:00 p . m , and train No . 22 leaves at 8: 00 p . m . 
 They will arrive the next morning , at 8: 00 a . m . and 10:00 a m . respectively . 
 Right . Trains No . 13 and No . 14 are the best trains on the line between Beijing and Shanghai . Which seats do you prefer , cushioned seats , ordinary seats , cushioned berth , or ordinary berth ? 
 Hello , Barneys Garage . 
 He just stepped out . Can I take a message ? 
 I'll make sure he receives the message . 
 Thanks for calling . 
 But I haven't used exercising equipment before . Can you tell us some more details ? 
 Working in the gym is a very good way for losing weight . What else do you have ? 
 That's wonderful ! I like swimming . 
 No , nothing in particular . 
 As regards salary , I leave it to you to decide after experience of capacity . 
 Thank you , Mr . White . I really appreciate your assistance . 
 Oh , hi , Lee . You look great . 
 What price do you suggest for 300,000 sets of Article No . 2323 with London as the destination port ? 
 What commission terms can you offer ? 
 Couldn't you raise the commission to five percent ? 
 Then I'll accept it with thanks . 
 That's wonderful ! Icing on the cake . 
 Curry and rice . What do you think ? 
 Really ! Oh , honey , you are so sweet . I'll chop up this carrot . 
 Honey , just turn down the stove . 
 Yes , please . I'm here for an International Settlement . Our company has to effect payment , and it needs to be done today . Here's the advice slip for the payment . 
 I see . So , I need to stamp it . And sign it too ? 
 I'll go back to the office and get it sorted and pop back later . Thanks , bye for now . 
 Is Diana in ? 
 Yes , please ask her to call John Smith . 
 Can you help me find a pan ? 
 I want a big pan . 
 Yes , it's the right size , but it weighs too much . 
 It's light enough , but the handle will get too hot after cooking . 
 Oh , my family's going to love this one . I'll take it . 
 Sure . Wait , wait . Does a lid come with this pan ? 
 Hey , Mike . Can I ask you something ? 
 I'm going to gamble on the world cup tonight . Who do you think will win ? 
 My husband is betting on France . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Would you please have a look at the table ? I think this one fits you . 
 We will lodge at the indigenes ' houses . It's interesting . 
 On that day , people play all kinds of tricks on others , and the one easily taken in is called April fool . 
 April the first is coming.Be careful ! 
 No , I ’ m not sure I ’ m going to . 
 No , thanks . I am okay . 
 Well , actually , I am thinking about living off campus . 
 I know it would be more expensive . I think I could handle it though . It ’ s that this dorm is so noisy that I can ’ t get anything done . 
 I ’ Ve got to think it over some more . 
 Can we choose a time to look at houses together ? 
 Either way is good for me . 
 I can take a little time off of work , or I can go on a weekend , also . 
 I am leaving from work , so maybe I could just meet you at the first house that we will look at . 
 I would like to see as many as possible . 
 Diana , do you like the perfume I gave you ? 
 I ’ m sorry . I didn ’ t know that . 
 I don't know what to do , if I can't find the money . 
 It's a large sum of money . I can't afford to lose it . 
 Thank you . 
 We're happy together now . We both think that we're a well-matched couple . 
 The situation differs in person . 
 Yes , John . I ’ m on my break . What ’ s going on ? 
 Great , except for my mother-in-law ! Sometimes I think I married her instead of my husband ! How about you ? 
 Hello , I need a new suit . I have an important interview next week , so I really need to look sharp . 
 Great ! I want a three piece suit , preferably made from Italian cashmere or wool . 
 Sure . I ’ ll also take some silver cuff link and a pair of silk ties . 
 Hi , Mike . We're having a party tonight , wanna come join us ? You can bring your girlfriend . 
 What happened ? Did you have a fight ? 
 Yeah , she is . She is pretty , caring , getting easy-going and she is a great cook . She is a gem . 
 Oh ? ! Did you talk with her about it ? 
 So , when are you going to tell her ? 
 I know she ’ s head over heels in love with you . She will be badly hurt ! 
 Are you still at that work ? 
 What sort of job do you have in mind ? 
 But it's very tired . 
 What's your parents ' opinion ? 
 Can you tell me how to apply for a job on the Internet ? 
 Do I have to send one by e-mail ? 
 Now that you'recommending such enormous fees , producers , directors , movie-makers must see you in a completely different light . 
 Then the standard that you set yourself originally must have changed . 
 It seems to me that now you're famous . You've got to go out and be seen at the right places and go to the right parties . 
 Then fans don't see you much in public places . 
 A lot of people compare you to Julia Roberts . I wondered if there was anyone that you compare yourself to in Hollywood , that you've watched and thought , ' Well , they've got something I could use a little bit or could learn a little bit about . ' 
 Could I see the manager please ? I have a complaint to make . 
 Did you have the room checked before we move in ? 
 1808 . The toilet doesn ’ t work properly , the water doesn ’ t run in the shower . 
 Mr . : For tomorrow , read pages 12 to 20 . Then do exercises one through ten on page 21 . 
 Mr . : No . You only do that when you write reports . 
 Mr . : For those of you who don't have a calculator , get one . 
 Mr . : Yes . By the way , review today's notes this evening . We may have a small quiz tomorrow . 
 It was all right . She , tall and attractive , has stable job and source of income . 
 But , well ... what I want to say is ... 
 Her standard for selecting life partner is a little higher . I can not accept that . 
 She said she want a man with large house , luxurious car and healthy parents . 
 Isn't it past your bedtime already ? 
 It's getting late , and you have to wake up early tomorrow . 
 Try listening to some soft music . 
 I really don't care , just go to sleep . 
 You'll be up all night if I let you do that . 
 You need to go to sleep now , so go to sleep . 
 Oh ! I just want to drop in on him for a chat . 
 No , thank you.Please tell him to phone me when he comes back . 
 Only a few . 
 I've gotten six , I think . 
 Of course I have . 
 I think they're $ 130 . 
 I just got a parking ticket . 
 I'm going to pay it today . 
 I don't recall . 
 Do you have any postcards ? 
 Can I have one each ? 
 Is there anywhere I can buy some more cards with beautiful scenery ? 
 Are their cards free , too ? 
 Hello , Mr . Black , I'm calling to say goodbye . 
 I wish I could stay a little longer , but a lot of things to do back home . 
 Yes , I did . 
 At 11:00 o'clock . 
 No , I'll go by myself , thanks . 
 I ’ d like to apply for a secretarial position . 
 No , but I can write very fast . 
 No , but I ’ d like to learn how to use them . 
 Can you work every day from 9 to 5 ? 
 I couldn ’ t possibly hire you . You can ’ t take shorthand , you can ’ t use a computer , and you can only work part time . 
 Yes . I feel terrible . I have been coughing for the whole morning . 
 Yes . I feel chilly and sluggish . 
 No . This is my first Ae abroad . I am not sure what is wrong with me . 
 Thank you very much . 
 That would be terrible . 
 Oh , how were you saved finally ? 
 Hey , buddy . Are the fish biting today ? 
 Is that so ? Well , what kind of bait are you using ? 
 Lures ? We're using live bait over here . 
 We're using worms . 
 No , we haven't even gotten a nibble today . 
 I would , but I don't have any in my tackle box . 
 I'm just fishing from the shore . How about you ? 
 Sweet.Can you tell me where it is ? 
 Do you think that's a good spot ? 
 Thanks . I think I'll go check that out now . 
 Mary has really gotten under my skin . 
 I think I ’ m crazy about her . 
 that was a great party . Thanks for saying behind to help me clear up . 
 I expected that something might get broken . That doesn ’ t bother me . That spilled drink won ’ t leave a stain , will it ? 
 I ’ m going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag . 
 yes , he ’ s very good .. isn ’ t he ? He told some funny stories too . 
 I think that she had a litter too much of the punch . 
 that ’ s my little secret . Did you like the snacks and I prepared ? 
 that cake tasted so good ! It disappeared within minutes , so I think everyone liked it a lot . How ’ s that stain ? 
 Ok . Let ’ s look at our short presentation on China . What do we need to include ? 
 Ok . China is about the same size as Canada and the united states and it has a population of about 1.3 billion , making it the latest country in the world by population . 
 We need to say something about the geography and climate of china . Is there any way to divide the country into sections ? 
 That sounds very general . 
 One from each part ? Lhasa , Urumqi , Harbin , shanghai , and hongkong . The capital city is Beijing , right ? 
 We should take a large map and highlight those cities . What is each of them famous for ? 
 I have a bad headache . 
 For two days . 
 I ’ m afraid so . Sometimes I feel hot and sometimes I feel cold . 
 What degree have you received ? 
 When and where did you obtain your degree ? 
 Hey ! That food was terrific . I can't eat another bite . Are you sure you don't want another dish ? 
 I know what you mean . I'm so full that I can burst . Shall we go then ? 
 You are welcome . 
 You ’ re crazy ! You haven ’ t been here long enough . 
 What makes you say that ? 
 I disagree with you . They don ’ t all wear the same clothes ; they ’ re definitely not all blond ; they don ’ t all own Parker fountain pens ; they don ’ t all drink Coca Cola , and they don ’ t all chew gum . I do think they all drive cars though ! But that doesn ’ t have anything to do with how they look ! 
 May i help you ? 
 Sure , here you are . 
 Yes , the fitting room is over there , it looks fantastic on you , this style color in sizes natural here and figure , perfectly . 
 I think so , but the true thing is you look sharp in any style . 
 Absolutely , i go to there to work three times a week , bend it for 6 month now . 
 Oh , you like the rolling machine . 
 No problem , is this blue ok ? 
 Yes , we do , there is a 90 percent for two . 
 The total is 90 dollars including tax . 
 Yes , we do , debit or credit ? 
 Please keen your key number here , do you want to any extra cash back ? 
 Have a good day . 
 Great , take care . 
 You ’ re free to go . 
 What are your plans now that you ’ re getting out ? 
 What is your major going to be ? 
 I hope I don ’ t ever see you back in here . 
 This really isn ’ t the place for you . 
 Good luck out there . 
 I'm not sure about how to operate the washer and dryer . 
 I need help turning them on . 
 The machines take change ? 
 Where do i put the money in ? 
 That's it ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Do you watch a lot of TV ? 
 Not me . I have to have my TV and watch whatever comes on . 
 How may I help you , miss ? 
 Would you like to have a perm ? 
 Oh , absolutely . 
 Good morning . Craftsman Company . Can I help you ? 
 You must have dialed the wrong number . 
 Sorry . This is 321-9887 . 
 It's ok . 
 Yes , and I think I have good news for you . 
 Yes , they accepted your counter-offer , but they want you to pay for the home inspection . 
 It will cost you around five hundred to one thousand dollars for a home inspection . 
 Yes , you are paying for it , so you get to choose . I would pick the best one . 
 I will call the owners right now . They will be happy to hear the good news . 
 I really can't say . Both teams this year seem really good . 
 That sounds great ! 
 yes . I ’ d like to book a table for Friday evening please . 
 we ’ ll be eight or nine people . Could we book a private room ? 
 about 7:30 . 
 my name is Jenkins . My phone number is 7539738 2 . that ’ s confirmed then . 7:30 on Friday . 
 oh , we ’ d like the buffet please . We ’ Ve heard it ’ s very good . 
 Yes , I watched United play Chelsea . What a fierce battle ! allay were engaged in intensive pressing and tackling in midfield . Well , it was not like a normal English League match . 
 Haha . That's probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common , and offsides more frequent in English League matches than those on the Continent . And the ball is often kept flying overhead , drawing beautiful curves in the sky . Such games are quite pleasing to the eye . 
 I'm a firm United supporter . I like their playing style . The Reds always have several excellent wing-backs , Like Riggs , Peckham and Gary Neville . They often make wonderful crosses when they assist in attacking . 
 I ’ m so frustrated ! 
 I called the electronics shop to find out what time they close , and it took me twenty minutes to get what I wanted ! 
 yes.They have some sort of digital receptionist.So when I called in , a machine told me to push a button for the department I wanted to be transferred to . 
 I just kept pushing buttons . I was transferred to customer service , but there a machine told me to choose between technical help , warranty information , or price information . 
 Eventually I did get to a real person . I found out the closing time , but by then the store had already closed ! 
 It's the mailman , Mother . Here's a letter from Uncle George . 
 When's he coming ? 
 Let me look at the calendar . Good ! The twenty-fourth is a Saturday . Is he coming alone ? 
 Mother , I don't remember the girls . How old are they ? 
 Are they going to stay here with us ? 
 Mother , may we have a party ? 
 Prepare the list , Mother . I can go shopping . I can go to the small stores.Everyone knows me there . 
 I ’ m so sorry I ’ m late . But Henry ’ s car broke down . 
 I don ’ t like your Rose . And I do love Henry . And I ’ m going to marry him . 
 Your Rose is a fool . 
 Why don ’ t you marry Rose , then ? 
 I love it . I really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it.It gives me a real sense of satisfaction.Do you enjoy cooking ? 
 You can ask the guests for help . My guests usually insist on doing the washing up . I just have to remind them where everything goes . 
 Italian , Indian and chinese . I ’ Ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and I need some more practice . 
 Not at all.You can find most of them in supermarkets.The ingredients are usually the same as in Western food.The way that the food is prepared is the big difference , not the ingredients . 
 Obviously , it depends on what I ’ m cooking.But I ’ d say it generally takes about one and a half hours . 
 I spoke to a girl named Claire on the phone ; it's about losing my card and everything . 
 So , I can get my new card today ? 
 7 days ! What am I supposed to do for money until then ? 
 Hi Mary , how's it going ? 
 Terrible . It must be something serious . You two are such close friends . 
 Really ? What happened ? 
 That's pretty harsh . 
 You know she probably feels just as bad . 
 Well , in that case I guess maybe you can be more understanding . You shouldn't let a trivial thing like this stand in the way of your friendship . After all you can go to the beach anytime you want . 
 Do you get the news that our company is trying to find out new tactics to test us ? 
 It takes most of our weekends to listen to these boring lectures , so I can not bear it anymore . It is said that they think out some tests to check our management skills . 
 Definitely ! 
 They are professors and government officials . 
 Most of them are from America and Europe . 
 They are attending an international conference here . 
 They are staying at the Hilton Hotel . 
 No , I couldn't make it . 
 Oh , really ? Who won ? 
 Too bad I was busy . I really wanted to go . 
 So what was the score ? 
 Man , that was a really close game . 
 I'll make sure and make it to the next one . 
 Oh , that scared me . 
 Oh , dear ! How ruthless ! 
 Why not ? That's a good idea to help them . 
 Probably my parents . 
 Well , during school , they wanted good grades . Then after I got a job , they wanted me to get a better job . And finally , they want me to get married . 
 Your parents are not like that ? 
 You're lucky . 
 Not much I can do . It's always there . I sometimes go out with some friends and drink , but that's only a temporary solution . The stress always returns in the morning . 
 Sure . Sounds great . Let's go . 
 Let me see.Oh , we have the design but not the same color as this one . 
 You're welcome . 
 Channel Two . A TV series was showing on it . The name of the series is Huanzhu Gene 
 Generally it's to my appetite . What about you ? 
 Don't be too critical . So what's your favorite ? 
 Hi Ron , this is Kim at headquarters . 
 Great , thanks . I was calling to change our meeting next week . 
 Well , I was hoping we could reschedule for early next month , Our trip has been postponed until the 2nd . 
 That works for me ! I will call you when I get into town to reconfirm . 
 I want to get a snack at the cafeteria . 
 I may just get some chips . 
 What do you want to get ? 
 What kind do you want ? 
 What kind of chocolate ? 
 I don't think they sell Kit Kats . 
 I need order in the court ! 
 What do you plead ? 
 All the evidence indicates that you are guilty . 
 Is that right ? 
 Who is the guilty party ? 
 I ’ d be glad to make a deal with you . 
 Do you know something about Mount Tai ? 
 Five sacred mountains ? Why people call them so ? 
 Got it . Can we see any things left by them ? 
 I want to see them . How can I go there ? 
 I would like the two clothes washed . 
 Thank you for your reminding.Yes , please have it dry cleaned . 
 What's the matter ? 
 Oh , you have to take the shuttle to Grand Central . 
 It's not on this platform . These trains are uptown and downtown , not crosstown . You have to go up these stairs over there . 
 That's okay . Better late than never . 
 We are very glad to hear that . We are sure that there will be a bigger market for our products in this country . 
 We really appreciate your efforts . Before we go to the core of matter , can you give us some idea of them on which you would be willing to operate as our agent ? 
 When is your vacation going to start ? 
 Oh , that's only a few days from now ! How many weeks are you going to be taking ? 
 Where are you going now . 
 Have you made your hotel reservation yet ? 
 You're lucky . It's hard to find a place to stay at the beach in August 
 I'm glad I brought my jacket on this trip . 
 What would you like to do today ? 
 I thought we could go to some of the museums.Don ' t you want to see the museums ? 
 I don't agree . I think the Capitol building is the most famous.But okay . If you want to see the White House , we'll go see it . I'm just afraid it will be boring . 
 Hi , excuse me sir ? I ’ m looking for a dress shoe . My usual pair that I ’ Ve had for years have finally been stretched out of shape . They don ’ t provide any support anymore . 
 Show me some classic high heels , please . 
 Black . Classic . 
 Umm . too shiny . And I wear pantyhose with my shoes so let ’ s look for a closed-toe shoe . 
 I don ’ t like the pointed toes . Let me take a look at what else you have . Too high . That one looks like the back would cut into my heel . I have a high instep so I doubt that one will fit properly . 
 Seven-and-a-half . 
 Hmmm.Not good . They ’ re too tight.The length is right , but the shoe is too narrow and it ’ s pinching my toes . And there ’ d be no room for my insoles . You know what ? I don ’ t think I have the patience fo 
 Have you considered upgrading your system ? 
 You could consider adding a painting program to your software . It would allow you to make up your own flyers and banners for advertising . 
 You might also want to upgrade your hardware because it is pretty outdated now . 
 You'd probably need a faster processor , to begin with . And you also need a more powerful hard disc , more memory and a faster modem . Do you have a CD-ROM drive ? 
 Then you might want to add a CD-ROM drive too , because most new software programs are coming out on Cds . 
 Look , there are some words on the fish . 
 For God's sake ! It's too bloody . How can people be so cruel ? 
 You can't prick the fish to please the sick tastes of some bloody people . 
 Just an animal ? But it has life too . If you want a tattoo , get one . It's your choice because you want it . But has anyone asked the fish if it wanted one ? 
 Hilton hotel , may I help you ? 
 OK , sir . We will arrange one for you . 
 Sorry , sir . It's not allowed in our hotel . 
 Do you have any shoes like these ? 
 Size five . 
 Black . 
 But my sister bought this pair last month . 
 No , she bought them in the U . S . 
 Can you get a pair for me please ? 
 They look very uncomfortable . 
 I am so bored all day . 
 Jack borrowed a large sum of money from me and didn ’ t pay me back . 
 Excuse me , you look lost.Can I help you ? 
 Right . Let me see . You go straight down here and turn right . 
 Then take the next left then the next right . Are you with me ? 
 Alice , I never knew you had such a lovely voice . You really can sing , can't you ? 
 No wonder you can control your voice so well . You are a professional singer . 
 Well , a good teacher makes good students . 
 That new Sony camcorder you've got is just beautiful . 
 I can see digital video products are quickly going mainstream with their plunging price . 
 Such as ? 
 They are very compact and are designed to be used with one hand . 
 What does this mean ? 
 I can transfer my home video clips from my camcorder to my computer for editing . 
 What special effects ? 
 That's great ! 
 So everybody's getting video mail . 
 Yes . 
 My name is James . 
 American . 
 I don't know him . 
 Because he beat me first when I tried to stop him from grabbing my bag and running away . 
 I stabbed his belly three times . 
 I knew , but I couldn't myself . 
 No . I didn't kill him on purpose , madam . It's him who caused the incident . I need to see my attorney . 
 How big is your family ? 
 Who supports the family ? 
 Do you live with your family ? 
 Susan ? We ’ re having a farewell party for John Anderson today . 
 We ’ re starting at 12:00 and it ’ ll go on for the rest of the afternoon . 
 Why don't we get you some shirts ? 
 But we should get you some shirts while we're here . You need summer shirts . 
 Why ? They have everything here . 
 Let's just look and see what they have . 
 What about these shirts ? Do you see anything you like ? 
 Oh , come on ! Don't be so sour . These are beautiful shirts . I know if we don't buy some today , you will never go shopping by yourself . 
 Here . Look at this shirt . Try it on . 
 I don't know . Let me look on the rack . Here is one . LARGE . Try it on . 
 The fitting rooms are over there . 
 It looks good on you . 
 No , it looks great.Why are you always like this when you're shopping ? You know it looks good . 
 I think we'll buy this one . And I want you to try on this one too . 
 You should be happy I want you to look good.If I let you shop for yourself , you would never buy anything . 
 Could you hold the elevator , please ? Thanks a lot . 
 I'm headed to the 18th floor , the top floor . 
 Do you work there ? I have an interview today with Dale Mendoza . Do you know her ? 
 To tell you the truth , I'm really nervous . I had a dream last night that I was being interviewed by a three-headed monster that kept trying to bite my head off . Oh , wow , my palms are sweaty just thinking about it . I just hope Ms . Mendoza won't be able to hear my teeth chattering . I just hope I get through this in one piece . 
 It depends on the type of the house you're looking for . 
 What ’ s your general price range ? 
 Umm , I think I would be hard to find something in that range in this area . You know the environment in the south mountain district is the nicest . 
 A two-bedroom house in this area is generally around 250,000 RIB . 
 I recommend you buy a two-bedroom house . It is very suitable for a couple , and some two-bedroom houses are large enough for a one-child family . 
 It's snowing heavily . 
 The snow is so beautiful . 
 What time dose it start ? 
 Then we'd better get started . 
 We got a problem . The deposit boxes are all full . We should have come earlier . 
 Did you ? I didn't hear you . It was too noisy . 
 They say we can't . They don't look after customers ' stuff . 
 OK , it's my fault . I'll stay here and look after our stuff . You can get in , shopping with Daniel and May . 
 Hey , don't forget to buy a suit for me . 
 Black , of course . 
 He is at the warehouse this morning . 
 Sorry , I have no idea . You can call him there if you like . 
 It's Chinese New Year ! That means it's time to eat hot pot ! 
 You mean half-and-half ? 
 Good idea . 
 Hi there . I'd like to draw some cash from my Fund Account at the Securities Company . Could I check my balance before I withdraw anything ? 
 I'd like 20,000 RIB , please . If that's possible . 
 Do you know a bus that goes to the Gold Line station ? 
 My house is up in Altadena . 
 It'll really take me to the station ? 
 Do you know what street it goes on ? 
 I would've never known . 
 I appreciate you telling me . 
 Good morning . How can I help you ? 
 OK . Please fill in these forms and take them back when you are done . 
 OK . Can I have your original ID card and tw0 2 - inch photos ? 
 That is OK . We have photo taking service here . You may pay your fee , take a photo there and take it back here . 
 Will you be joining Billy and I at the Bar ? 
 We are going to try the new one that opened up on 17th Street . 
 I want to stop off at my apartment to get changed so I should be there by 9 pm . 
 Certainly . But if there are going to be four of us , I had better make reservations . 
 Then I'II make reservations for 9 pm for a party of four . 
 Not that I know of . Why do you ask ? 
 I hear the drinks and food there are moderately priced.You should be fine . 
 No , its very casual there . Leave your jacket and tie at home . 
 I'll see you there at 9pm . 
 May I help you ? 
 How long do you have ? 
 New York is full of place of interest , such as Times Square , Broadway , Wall street and Ground Zero and Statue of Liberty . 
 Happy New Year ! 
 Have you got any plans ? 
 My roommate's having a party . 
 It seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax . 
 Do you know how to do it ? I am not so good at machine things . I will have somebody do it as soon as possible . 
 Hello , this is Steven . Is that Mrs.Wang ? I'm just calling to follow up about the status of the personnel manager position . 
 I ’ m very proud to be employed by your firm . 
 Anytime . 
 Thank you for hiring me . See you then . Bye . 
 I'm feeling down . 
 Hi , I need a hotel room . 
 Certainly . My name is John Sandals . 
 Friday afternoon , April 14 through Monday morning , April 17 . 
 Please tell me the price , so I can make a decision . 
 That's a reasonable price . 
 I quit smoking , so nonsmoking . 
 A queen sounds great . 
 That would be 626-555-1739 . 
 Excuse me , i am a new student here . Could you tell me where the English Department is ? 
 Where is the school cafeteria ? 
 Where is the Computer Center ? 
 Where is the library ? 
 Thank you . I will go get one . 
 Well , hi ! My name is Eve Markowski . I am glad to meet you . With your friendly smile and helpful attitude . I am sure you will win . 
 You are welcome . I ’ d better go . Goodbye . 
 Mary , how was your date with john ? 
 Oh , really . That is great news . What does he look like ? 
 Sounds like he is pretty cute . What do you think of him ? 
 Oh , it's love at first sight . When will you see each other again ? 
 Maybe he is busy with his work . Just wait and try not to think about it too much ! 
 Come on , Mary , you're a total catch . I bet he will call you . Don't worry . 
 That's what friends are for . 
 What is it ? Maybe I can help . 
 Do you come from a country where they shake hands ? 
 It ’ s very simple . Men shake hands , women and children don ’ t . 
 Well , a good rule to follow is , for men you hold out your hand , for women and children , you wait and see what they do . 
 Sure . Once you get the hang of it , it ’ s a piece of cake ! It ’ s nothing to worry about . 
 Merry Christmas , Lee ! 
 Thank you for coming . I'm glad you liked it . 
 Brad , it's her birthday . Let's get her something really special . 
 I mean beautiful and heartfelt-something that will make her cry . 
 Women like that kind of thing , beautiful thoughts that are touching . 
 Okay , you get your funny one and I'll get my beautiful one . 
 Look at the dishes ! I have told you three times to put away these dishes . But now ... 
 I have told you that I don ’ t need them any more . The thing that really annoys me is that you played dumb with me . 
 What are you going to do ? Call my boss and chew him out ? 
 Impossible . My pager is really old . It doesn't display messages . 
 Gosh , you're right ! It's from some guy named Vic . I wonder who he is ... 
 He is an all-right guy . I have no bone to pick with him . 
 But he is not a fine wether friend who could sell you down the river . 
 Depends on with whom . He may be doing things on the sly , but he is honest with me . I trust him . 
 Excuse me . Is this seat taken ? 
 Am I on right bus to Chicago ? 
 Oh , my God ! 
 I will . Thank you . 
 Yes . I ’ d like to book a duplex suite . 
 Next Friday . 
 Oh , thank you very much . 
 How do I contact them ? 
 Hello , reservation desk . How can I help you ? 
 What kind of room would you like , Ma ’ am ? We got single rooms , double rooms , standard rooms , suites and deluxe suites . 
 $ 79 a night . 
 What date would you check in , Ma ’ am ? 
 How long do you plan to stay ? 
 Could you give me your name and phone number ? 
 Thanks . What time will you arrive ? 
 Very good . Your reservation confirmation number is NB13579 . Thank you for booking in our hotel . Can I help you with anything else today ? 
 You must be Mr White from Britain . 
 I'm Michael Smith from Eale Corporation.Pleased to meet you . 
 Oh , here you are . 
 Yes . And come here for tourism . 
 Twenty days . 
 Yes , here is the form . 
 Yes , only one travel bag . 
 Nothing but several personal effects . 
 How about this floor lamp ? 
 We still need to find an armoire and a dresser . 
 Great ! Pick me up in about an hour because I think I ’ ll also get a bean bag and a dining set . 
 Recliner ? In my beautifully decorated living room ? I don ’ t think so ! 
 Hi , Deborah ! This is John . I'm calling from Australia . 
 I'm attending a conference in Sydney this week . Remember ? 
 It's 10:00 P . M . And it's four o'clock in Los Angeles , right ? 
 4:00 A . M . ? I'm really sorry . 
 Taxi ! Taxi ! 
 I ’ d like to go to the railway station please . 
 Is it a long run to the station ? 
 The streets are heavy with traffic at this time of a day , are they ? 
 Is it the rush hour now ? 
 No , I ’ m not . Would you please drive slowly and carefully ? 
 Ah , Michelle , hi . I was hoping to see you . How have you been ? How's the family ? 
 I'm fine thanks . I got your report this morning . Thank's for that . Are you joining the conference today ? 
 Good , well we can discuss this more then , but I think the figures are looking very good for this quarter . 
 I'm planning to discuss the advertising budget at the conference . I don't think we should continue with the TV advertising . 
 What time are you leaving ? 
 Take care , and give my best to your parents . 
 For our lunch meeting with the investors , do we have to make a reservation at the restaurant or do we just show up ? 
 I've arranged to meet them at the restaurant at twelve . Can you make the reservation a little earlier ? If we start earlier , it will give us more time for a longer lunch . 
 Yes , we'll start with appetizers , follow with a soup and salad course , then main dishes of prime rib or cordon bleu chicken , and finish up with a delicious rich dessert of some sort . 
 As along as we stay away from anything alcoholic , we should be okay . 
 We can make some special arrangement if we need to . After all , it's the company who is footing the bill . 
 Certainly , Mr . Emory . What can I do for you ? 
 Sure . Let me look over them and I ’ ll bring them back this afternoon . 
 They look great ! Hey , are you hungry ? I know a good Ethiopian restaurant-Meskerem . 
 It's very “ in ” these days . Some of the places are really expensive . 
 No . Africans and African-Americans are different in many ways . Our food's different , too . 
 Hello . This is Jones . I'd like to speak to Mr . Chen . 
 I'd like to discuss the new order with you . Would you like to have lunch together at Garden Hotel next Tuesday ? 
 That's a pity . Does Friday suit you ? 
 Is 12 o'clock convenient for you ? 
 Hi , Alex . Would you come with me to supply ? I ’ Ve got to pick up a load of stuff and I ’ m afraid I can ’ t carry it all . 
 Thanks . I appreciate the hand . I ’ d have to make two or three trips on my own . 
 I am starving . 
 I'm still hungry . 
 I just need a snack . 
 I don't have the slightest clue . 
 I'm not sure what kind I want . 
 I think I will do that . 
 Have you got change for a thousand ? 
 Good morning , Helen . 
 So , what's the status of our advertising campaign ? 
 What style will the ads be ? 
 Sounds like a good idea . Will we have a new slogan ? 
 I want to go try on these clothes . 
 I found some jeans , and a new blouse . 
 What do you think ? 
 What about the jeans ? 
 I don't think so either . 
 I'll just buy the shirt . 
 Hello , I am Mr . Johnson at room 309 . I would like to have a safe box . Do I need to pay for a safe box ? 
 Here you are . Can I have a larger envelope to put my valuable things in it ? 
 Yes , it's perfect . 
 OK , I won't . 
 Well , Thanksgiving is family event.So on Thanksgiving , family members will get together and enjoy a big Thanksgiving dinner . Kids will have lot of fun . 
 Yes , we do . It is an exciting moment . 
 For me ? The football games of course , I love football games . 
 What ? 
 OK . Let me see . 
 Which season do you like best ? 
 Why ? 
 I like spring , too.We can go for a walk and enjoy the fresh air . 
 Oh , I'm fine . 
 Maybe ... but I don't think so . 
 I don't know . I'm just feeling a little sad . 
 Now that's a good idea . Thanks a lot , Brian . I'm feeling better already . 
 I'm sorry , sir . Exactly what is the problem ? 
 I'm so sorry , sir . We'll give you a new room immediately , and give you a refund also . 
 Sir , we always try to please our guests . 
 Oh , you know , tomorrow is Vicky's birthday . I am thinking what gift to give her . 
 It's a bad idea . Vicky has short hair . 
 Only old women like that . 
 OK . That's what I can do . 
 Yes , Mary ? 
 Are you telling me you're not going to meet with me ? 
 Well , I don't like it , but I guess I don't have any choice . 
 OK , I'll go to your office at that time . 
 I didn't mean to . It was an accident . 
 I did not . It looks perfectly fine . 
 What did I do to it ? 
 I really don't think that I did that . 
 Look , just give me your insurance and number and I'll take care of it . 
 Trust me . 
 This is the specialty of our restaurant , sir . 
 Thank you for appreciating it . 
 Do we have to ? 
 It ’ s not that bad , besides it really looks nice in that corner . It gives the room a good atmosphere . 
 But it makes the place feel so much like Christmas . I ’ d really hate to have to take it down . 
 I know , but it seems like such a shame to have to take it away . 
 I know , I know . But it reminds me of the great Christmas we just had . All of us were here - - my parents , your parents , the kids , and the cousins - - the food was good , and everybody got what they wanted . 
 Ok , fine . We need to take down the tree . 
 Hello , this is Helen speaking . 
 Fine , thank you . And you ? 
 Oh , how wonderful . I ’ ll be glad to . 
 Hum , don ’ t say that . Maybe you can do something useful for me . 
 I ’ ll tell you at the party . 
 good morning ! 
 I slept like a baby . I fell asleep right away last night , didn't wake up once , and didn't have nay nightmares ! 
 I feel much better , but I'm still worried about something . 
 well , I have to drive to school for a meeting this morning , and I'm going to end up getting stuck in rush-hour traffic . 
 for me , traffic jams are quite stressful , because I'm pretty impatient . How can I prevent myself from getting stressed if I get stuck in a traffic jam ? 
 Ok , I'll try that . 
 just one more thing . A school called me this morning to see if I could teach a few classes this weekend and I don't know what to do . 
 I'm supposed to work on a paper that'd due on Monday . 
 you're right . I probably should just work on my paper . Thanks ! 
 What ’ s wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ? 
 Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out . 
 Oh , Diane and I went for a drive in the country on Saturday . 
 We drove to the lake and had a picnic . We had a great time ! How about you ? Did you do anything special ? 
 That old thing ! Why don't you just buy a new one ? 
 My mom and dad insist that I be home before ten . Do you have a curfew ? 
 I wish my parents were a little more lenient . 
 You like going to bed early ? 
 Well , I still hate having a curfew . 
 Holly , I just heard some terrible news . 
 What ? No , I heard that he has stomach cancer . His ex-girlfriend said it . 
 Maybe that's why he didn't show up at the potluck . Have you seen him ? 
 How did you get the piano here ? 
 You never did it on your own . 
 Kids are always difficult to control . 
 Kids are kids . 
 I don't know . My life is a big mess . Everything is so complicated . 
 but promise me , you'll keep it a secret . 
 I've fallen in love with my boss . 
 no , of course not . He is still single . 
 I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us . 
 worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days . 
 it gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed . 
 Are you interested in mountaineering ? 
 I'm the same with you , an amateur mountain climber . 1 went climbing in the Rocky Mountains with my friends last summer vacation . We spent two days in the mountains . 
 We pitched a tent in the night , waiting for the sunrise . Wow ! It was too beautiful . 
 Tasha Mountain ? It's very famous in China , isn't it ? 
 I want to climb Tasha Mountain this summer vacation . Would you be my guide ? 
 I hear that you are going to participate in the dinner party tonight.Seen from what you are dressing , you really look like a fox . 
 Good afternoon , ma'am . Can I help you find anything ? 
 We have a special on these skirts this week . Would you like to try one on ? 
 How about a blouse ? This one here is the latest fashion . 
 Why not try on this lovely pair of shorts ? I'm sure they'd look fabulous on you . 
 Take a look at this dress ! Don't you think it's perfect for you , ma'am ? Uh , where are you going , ma'am ? Ma'am ? 
 Turn left at the second light . You can't miss it . 
 No . It's not far at all . 
 That's all right . Have a good day . 
 waiting for someone . 
 you're right . He is so funny and I think I'm in love with him . 
 I know , but I keep thinking of him every day . And I get really depressed when he's not online . 
 well , this might be silly . But I just can't get him off my mind . And I can't help missing him . 
 yes . He said I'm his dream girl . 
 I know . I can't tell whether he's serious or not so I need your advice . 
 Good afternoon , Miss . What can I do for you ? 
 Just a moment , please . Your name ? 
 Here is your balance . 
 Here you go , Miss . 
 So how did you like the restaurant ? 
 What didn't you like about it ? 
 What did you think about the food ? 
 The service wasn't that great , either . 
 Do you think that you want to try this restaurant another time ? 
 Hi , what brings you to my office today ? 
 Have you had the flu lately ? 
 Have you ever been tested for allergies ? 
 Does this happen all the time or maybe a little more in the cold weather ? 
 I feel that you should see a pulmonary specialist to check for asthma . 
 I'm so glad to meet you . 
 Fine . 
 Really ? Thank you . 
 There's an airsickness bag behind the seat that's in front of you . 
 Is this your first time flying ? 
 Oh , it's a beautiful city . I think you'll like it . 
 Sometimes if you don't think about it , that sick feeling will go away on its own . 
 I'm Frank . Nice to meet you . 
 All right . 
 Yes , here's my ID card . 
 That sounds fantabulous . I have dreamed of going there for months . 
 Sure . I don't want to waste even a minute . 
 I hate school ! 
 I messed up my mid-term exam so badly today ! 
 yes , but it's so humiliating ! I don't want my friends to know I failed ! 
 I don't know . I sat down in my seat , looked at my paper , and then my mind just went totally blank . 
 no ... 
 I watched TV . 
 no , not really . 
 tomorrow . 
 ... The rings please . May this ring be blessed so he who gives it and she who wears it may abide in peace , and continue in love until life ’ s end . 
 Honey , that ’ s my pinkie . The ring goes on the ring finger ! 
 That ’ s my index finger ! 
 Umm ... that ’ s the thumb , Nick . 
 That ’ s my middle finger , Nick . This is my ring finger ! 
 Which credit card are you speaking of ? 
 We sent that bill out a couple of weeks ago . 
 Your bill was mailed already . 
 If you haven't gotten it yet , then you should probably take that up with your post office . 
 If that's the case , you will need to provide proof of their mistake . 
 Don't mention it . Call back if you have any more questions . 
 Yes , I would like to look at some of your products . I think what I am using now does not fit me well . 
 What do you have in foundation ? 
 What colors do you have in foundation ? 
 The color I use now is natural beige . How much do you sell it for ? 
 That's expensive . 
 I understand . I need a lipstick , too . Do you have lipsticks in red ? 
 All right . How much is it ? 
 Well , I'll take them . 
 I'm doing it for fun and fitness . 
 At the age of 64 ? You're kidding ! 
 Where ? Oh , that's Henry . 
 He's very nice , actually , but rather eccentric . 
 Yes , but he may be too eccentric even for you . 
 Well , haven't you heard ? 
 Well , apparently , he's been having an affair with his secretary . 
 According to Mary , he's divorcing his wife and there's a big fight going on about the children . I thought everyone knew . 
 Oh . Thanks . Look , I must just go and say hello to someone . I'll be right back . 
 With invoking ? No , thanks . 
 I'm not interested , Zina . 
 I don't think so . 
 Did you vote ? 
 Who was your vote for President ? 
 I didn ’ t expect him to win . 
 What made you think that ? 
 I thought his race would have kept him from winning . 
 That ’ s true . 
 Good afternoon , can I help you ? 
 I'm Kristy . Can I help ? 
 Oh , yes . Hello Mr Simons . I have some information about your L / C amendment . The negotiating bank has just informed us that the 3rd party does not wish to accept the amendment . 
 I'd recommend going back to the 3rd party , personally this time , and discussing what exactly it is they aren't happy with . Hopefully you can reach some sort of agreement , which is viable for everyone . 
 Don ’ t worry about it . 
 I think you just need to get more sleep . 
 Hello , this is Than Hua's office . Can I help you ? 
 Speaking . 
 That's right . What can I do for you ? 
 Can you make out what he's saying ? 
 Is that Mr . Green ? 
 I am calling to inform you that we're happy to have you with us . Welcome aboard , I'm sure your friend would have given you a lot of information of our school and its motto , ways of teaching , etc . 
 Hello , Mr . Brown . 
 Yes , I'm here to fix your pipes . 
 Mr . Johnson ’ s office . Cindy speaking . 
 No , I ’ m sorry , Mr . Kurt . He ’ s stepped out for a bit . Would you like me to have him call you ? 
 Hello ? 
 Oh , hi . I was just watching TV . 
 I know . I was watching a re-run . I have nothing to do and I was bored . 
 I'd like to , but I have to meet my parents in an hour for dinner . How about tomorrow ? 
 Did you hear the weather forecast for tomorrow ? 
 That's great . We can do something outdoors then . 
 Yeah . I think there's a live outdoor concert by the river tomorrow . 
 Do you know what time it starts ? 
 Let's meet for lunch at eleven thirty and afterwards , we can head over there . 
 Can you help me ? This fitting has come loose and I need something to tighten it up . 
 Thanks for your help . 
 How do I make a good impression in the interview ? 
 Anything else ? 
 What do you mean by this ? You can ’ t do the two things at the same time . 
 I see . 
 You ’ Ve given me very valuable advice and I have more confidence in myself now . Thank you very much . 
 Excuse me . Where are the rice and flour ? 
 Thank you . 
 I usually go in my free time on the weekends . How about you ? 
 That's true . And sometimes the tickets are cheaper during the week as well . 
 Sure , do you think you could live out here ? You know , back to nature at all ? 
 That ’ s what I was thinking . I mean can you imagine Friday night instead of going out with your friends you ’ d have to stay in your tree house and talk to birds and squirrels . 
 And where would you get a cup of cappuccino ? 
 Maybe . But I ‘ d rather be spoiled than turn into a crazy guy with a long period to talk to the birds . 
 Are you sure ? Who told you that ? I highly doubt that they would take the step to merge into one company ... They're supposed to be bitter enemies , the strictest of competitors.It must be a rumor.It can't be true . 
 The competition must have been too stiff for U-Tunes.Otherwise why would they allow themselves to be taken over by their sworn enemy ? 
 They're very good friends , aren't they ? 
 Oh , it's unbelievable ! 
 What would you like ? 
 Anything else ? 
 Yes , sir ? 
 Who would you like to have paged again , sir ? 
 Where would you like him to come ? 
 Just a moment , please . 
 Of course , I ’ Ve enjoyed it very much . I ’ Ve met my old friends and made some new friends . 
 Sometime next year . 
 The same to you . Keep in touch . 
 Yes . Is this Paula ? 
 No , that ’ s all right . Paula . Why don ’ t you get something to eat , and I ’ ll see you this afternoon . 
 Where to ? 
 Uh ... what game ? 
 Um ... and what sport are we talking about here ? 
 Oh ... football . Football is cool . I usually try to catch the World Cup finals . 
 Oh , I understand . I can't say I'm a big fan . I'm from China , and football doesn't have a really big following over there . 
 Yes , I think so . But to be perfectly honest , I'm not really a sports nut.When I was in high school I played on the school volleyball team . Are you a diehard football fan ? 
 It seems Americans are very passionate about sports . Is this just a part of your culture ? 
 So can you fix it ? 
 What do you mean ? I bought this computer just three years ago ! 
 OK , I know where this is going . How much will it cost me to get a new computer ? 
 I have no idea what you are talking about . I just want to know if it ’ s good and if I will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time ! 
 Hello , is Sue there ? 
 Sue John . 
 Oh , I'm sorry . 
 Canada is north of here . 
 Sure . Look here . Canada is north of the United States . 
 Mexico is south of the United States . 
 Connecticut is east of New York . 
 Ohio . 
 Los Angeles is in California . It's southeast of San Francisco . 
 Boston is in the northeast part of the country . 
 Las Vegas is in the southwest . 
 I need help finding a new refrigerator . 
 That Kenmore looks nice . 
 What makes is so great ? 
 What appliances are you talking about ? 
 May I take a look inside ? 
 It's very nice . I'd like to purchase this refrigerator . 
 Yeah , who ’ s calling ? 
 Fantastic ! I can ’ t believe it ! That ’ s the biggest account we ’ Ve gotten so far ! 
 Thank you . How long it take to get my son's hair cut ? 
 No . I'm thinking that maybe I can get my hair shampooed . 
 How come ? 
 Then I won't say no to that . 
 I feel totally refreshed . 
 This time included ? 
 Then yes . 
 Yes . When is the next train to New York City ? 
 Aren't there any trains before 10 thirty ? 
 Then one to New York at 10 thirty . 
 One way . 
 How much is a soft ? 
 Then one hard seat , please . 
 Can I see some men's watches ? 
 What functions does this watch have ? 
 Is it waterproof ? 
 I'll take it . Please set the watch for me . 
 Yes , we have . Here's our CIF quotation sheet . Please have a careful look . 
 Yes . All the quotations on the list are subject to our final confirmation . 
 All these products are our best-selling lines . The prices of our products will change according to that of the international market demand . And we are always open to negotiate , especially on larger orders . What do you have in mind ? 
 I understand . Our offer remains open for 4 days . 
 Hello , I come to pay my water and electricity fees . 
 Here they are . 
 Do you mean that I should pay 240 yuan in total ? 
 Cash , please . Here is the money . 
 OK . Thank you . Bye-bye . 
 How are you tonight , sir ? 
 I know what you mean . What can I get for you ? 
 One screwdriver , coming right up . ( He mixes the drink . ) Here you are , sir . 
 I'm worried sick that she might leave me one day . 
 Tell me , please . 
 May I speak to Marry ? 
 Will it be too late if I call around ten this evening ? 
 Grand Theft Auto Three is awesome ! 
 What time is it anyway ? 
 Oh , my God , three hours already ! I have to get the chores done ! 
 OK , emergency measures . Let's throw the dishes in the trash ! Two birds with one stone ... 
 No time to worry . We have to dispose of this evidence . 
 Which terms ? 
 Good . I will add this to the contract . 
 Well , you are right . Is there anything else ? 
 Well , we have agreed on all the major points . 
 That's true . You need to take some time off to relax . 
 When are you going to take your vacation ? 
 I really envy you . You know I'm not taking my vacation until December . 
 Would you like butter or jam on your toast or do you just want it plain ? 
 Anything to drink ? 
 Hi , this is Quipu Corp . Is that Miss Zhang ? 
 I am calling to tell you the items you are supposed to bring for the interview the day after tomorrow . 
 You'd better bring the diploma , identification card and several copies of your resume . 
 Yes . Are you ? 
 What ’ s your polling place ? 
 Oh , yeah ? 
 I don ’ t know . 
 The location of my polling place never came in the mail . 
 Let me go do that . 
 Hi . I want to check out . My room is 1005 . 
 Yes . Can I have a look at my bill ? 
 OK . I would like to have my receipt report , please . 
 Mr Edgar , hello ! How's business ? Still booming ? What can we do for you today ? 
 What we can do is to assign you a customer manager , that way you can just deal with him . You don't need to deal with anyone else . 
 I don ’ t know what activity my son should take part in ? 
 But each children has his own interest . 
 I need a snack from the cafeteria . 
 I only want some chips . 
 What do you plan on buying ? 
 What kind of candy do you want ? 
 What kind of chocolate do you want ? 
 The cafeteria doesn't sell Kit Kats . 
 Hi , Charles . What's the matter ? 
 Do you have a ride home ? 
 That's good . Do you live near here ? 
 I live downtown , with my parents . 
 I don't need a car . I walk to work . 
 I ’ m hungry , let ’ s grab a bite to eat . 
 Nah ! Let ’ s go get a burger and fries . 
 What are you talking about ? I have salads some times . 
 Fine ! I ’ ll start drinking and having home cooked meals that are low in fat . Are you happy now ? 
 Is that the latest issue of Reader you're reading ? 
 I know . I have been a subscriber for the past two years . 
 I'm not exactly sure , but it's not that expensive at all . 
 Why did you do that ? 
 It's the same in my family . The coffee table in my living room is covered with copies of Fashion . 
 Quite well , Tom.And you ? 
 He's much better today . 
 See you later . 
 No.Why ? 
 Oh , really ? I go to the rye every day . 
 Any particular decade ? 
 We had seven , but we sold one this morning . 
 You're in luck . Two of them have dancing figures . 
 Yes , that one is very nice . 
 I'm sorry , but you just have to take your chances . 
 Even if it doesn't work , it's a beautiful collectible . 
 Ah ? Really ? That stinks ! 
 Wow , you were pulling my leg all along . I was really fooled . 
 May I help you ? 
 It closes at six . 
 No , not every day . 
 Absolutely . 
 Saturday ’ s hours are from nine in the morning to six-thirty at night . 
 What else can I help you with ? 
 I was trying to find the class on preparing for interviews . 
 I am so happy I found this class because I was really nervous about my upcoming interview . 
 Our dress and grooming are probably the first thing an interviewer judges us by . 
 Yes , and they help establish a friendly tone for the rest of the interview . 
 What else should I be thinking about ? 
 I can ’ t bear it . The driver is too bad . 
 Mr . Li , does the recommendation of the university play an important role in job hitting ? 
 But I doubt the authority because most of the recommendation letters of the university are the same . 
 We have the orientation this afternoon . 
 The company introduction , our mission , vision , various policies , insurances , pension plan , company ID , batch , telephone , e-mail set-up and training . 
 Yes , it is not easy . 
 What's going on with you ? 
 I'm having a party this Friday . 
 Is that right ? 
 Can you go ? 
 It starts at 8 o'clock . 
 I hope that I'll see you there . 
 Hello , Joanna . You are looking very charming in the new dress . 
 Yes , it suits you very well . It certainly is unique . I don ’ t think I ’ Ve seen anything like it before . 
 And the necklace , it matches your dress marvelously . 
 Thank you for saying so . 
 could you show me where the Chinese-style clothing is located ? I want to buy a silk coat . 
 oh , they look nice . May I try that back one on ? 
 do you have a medium in the same color ? This one is a little tight . 
 ok , let me try it on . what do you think ? 
 really ? I'll take it , and I'm leaving here tomorrow . Is it possible for you to send one in black to me by mail when you gte it in ? 
 thanks . Who much would that come to ? 
 What certificates of technical qualification have you got ? 
 Have you worked in a computer company before ? 
 Do you have any ideas on this work ? 
 Good ! 
 We've brought you a little something from the place down the street , Kitty Cafe-Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee beans ! 
 ... yes , but this one has an all-new buzz . 
 I've been looking forward to visiting your factory . 
 Is your father in the habit of having naps ? 
 Don't you feel dizzy when you have to get up ? 
 My uncle gave me this bicycle as a birthday present . Look ! 
 I can't believe the boss was absent from today's meeting . 
 I can't believe that . 
 I've never heard Mary cursed anybody . But I heard she cursed another driver when she drove me back home today . 
 The car behind ours suddenly accelerated and hit our Car . 
 My name is Alice Lin , and I need to know if some money has been transferred to my account yet . 
 Thank you . 
 What ? 
 Mr . Rogers probably forgot to assign a locker to you . 
 Remind him to give you a locker tomorrow . 
 No . You have to buy your own . You'll have to go to a hardware store to pick one up . 
 Yes . I worked in a small machinery factory . My work was very simple and there was not much work to do . 
 No , I thought it was too dull . I'm capable of more responsibilities , so I decided to change my job . 
 Yesterday I saw your company's advertisement . Your company is an important international company . Working for it , I believe it can improve my abilities . 
 Oh , the company is the fourth largest machine producer in the world . It was founded in the United States in 1980 . I know that the company has made good use of advanced technology . 
 Hi Tina , It's Joe . 
 How's the weather there today ? 
 What's the temperature ? 
 Have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow ? 
 I really don't like the winter . I wish it were summer . 
 It's not too bad , but it's pretty cold here too . It was about 45 today and it rained this afternoon . I heard it's going to be a little warmer tomorrow . 
 We all know that . Her husband always make a fuss of her . 
 How can I help you today , Sir ? 
 That's not a problem . You can use that service wherever you are , it doesn't matter which country you are in at the time . 
 Of course . It's 33234 . That will put you in touch with a Personal Banker . 
 That's the beauty of the service ; they can deal with everything , with total security . 
 Hi Jackie . You don't look too well . What's going on ? 
 Why ? What's stressing you out ? 
 The best thing to do is study as much as you can . I'm sure you'll do alright . 
 I have to study for an exam too . Why don't we study together . We can encourage each other . 
 Hello , it's nice to meet you . 
 You're welcome . 
 Is there a problem ? 
 That's great news . 
 She isn't messing up in class ? 
 Well , I'm so glad to hear that she's doing well . 
 Hey , man , look , what's on the wall over there ? 
 What does it say ? 
 I can smoke outside of the office . But what else does it say ? 
 But if there is an emergency and the manager is of absence , what should we do ? 
 OK , OK , got it . By the way , what about the vacation policy ? Anything changed ? 
 Can we have 7 - day holiday on National Day ? 
 That's great ! 
 Are you kidding ? I always get up late . Oh , my God . Can't believe that . That is terrible . 
 Come here at once , John . Will you ? 
 And bring you homework with you , please . 
 Yes , you must . 
 Sure.Do you want an acoustic one or an electric one ? 
 Are you looking to get a steel-string or a classical ? 
 Well , a classical guitar has nylon strings and its neck is bigger than a steel-string guitar ’ s.It ’ s best suited for finger picking . A steel-string is best for playing chords . 
 In that case , I ’ d suggest a steel-string guitar.The best one we have is the Ovation . 
 In that case , how about this one ? It ’ s inexpensive but it ’ s still well made and easy to play . 
 You should also get a couple of guitar picks . 
 Don ’ t mention it . 
 What magazine do you want to subscribe for ? 
 OK , Fitness Consultant . How many subscriptions do you want ? 
 How long do you want the subscription for ? 
 Your name , please ? 
 I see . Please put your address here then . 
 650 Yuan . 
 Do you often go to watch sports games ? 
 Can you recall the games ? 
 Boy , come here ! 
 Bring me a cup of coffee , please . 
 I prefer strong . 
 I want to buy a cell phone for my daughter . 
 She is 17 . It's for her birthday . 
 Thanks , but I want to have a look at the Motorola's products . 
 Sounds perfect . I'll take the pink one . Can you pack it for me ? 
 Why not ? The Sweetheart pendant matches the cell phone well . I'd take this one . 
 Thanks . 
 Let me see ... One or two bedrooms ? 
 Fine , sir . We can accommodate you . 
 No , sir . We don't allow dogs or cats . 
 Fine . See you on the 18th . 
 Ah , good morning , Mr . Smith . Nice to meet you . I'm Peter Anderson from Personnel . Do sit down . 
 Now , have you brought your curriculum vitae with you ? 
 Have you brought your certificates as well ? 
 Yes , that'll be all right . Well , please tell me about your working experience . 
 OK , so do you think you can make yourself easily understood in English ? 
 Yes , I am young , and unmarried . It's no problem for me to travel frequently . 
 Thank you very much . I'm looking forward to your call . 
 Would you ? I wouldn't . 
 Oh , I don't know . I'd buy a big house with a garden for my wife and kids , I suppose . But it's difficult to imagine having a lot of money . 
 Wouldn't you ? What would you do with all that spare time ? 
 What would you do after that ? 
 It doesn't sound very exciting . 
 I'd be happy if I got a rise . 
 Well , I'm not likely to get a rise and you haven't the money for a mink coat , so let's come down to earth and have another drink . 
 I'll have a pint of the best . 
 All right . Make it a double , will you ? 
 Oh , I ’ m not . I ’ Ve never had a music class before . 
 You ’ re having me on again . 
 How about a game of tennis ? 
 It's a deal . 
 Good morning , Miss . 
 Yes . I'd like to know how to use the library . You know , I'm a new student here . 
 Excuse me , here is my claim tag , but I can't find my baggage . 
 Just one piece . 
 It's a big leather suitcase with my name ' Lily ' on it . 
 Thank you . 
 Ah , yes , that's right . 
 Hello , I was just looking for the guide 。 
 Not bad . But I've made too many flights these days . I could hardly remember how many take offs and landings I've been through these three days . I think we all feel a bit tired . 
 Wonderful . I'm eager to take a sauna as soon as possible . 
 I'm sure we will . Actually , we are looking forward to seeing the great wonder . 
 I have a need for help with writing and also a need for help with the computer work . Which would you prefer ? 
 That would be wonderful . Sometimes we will be working together and sometimes independently . Would that be OK ? 
 We start on Monday . Can you be there ? 
 I need your background information before the meeting . 
 I'll enjoy working with you . Have a great day ! 
 OK.What do you want to know ? 
 OK . 
 Here you are . 
 Two years . 
 I'm a professor at a university . 
 I teach at Beijing Normal University , English composition and some conversational classes . 
 There are lots of new teachers in our class this semester . 
 To be honest , I like all of them , except for the math teacher . Though he must be quite young , he seems like an old person . He's so boring . 
 It might be the English teacher . What about you ? 
 She is a pretty good teacher ! With her help I think I can make great progress in English . 
 I think it's a good way to develop our language ability . 
 Could you please stop flipping the channels ? 
 Okay , can I ask you something direct ? 
 Fair enough . Give it to me straight . Did she bully you into this ? 
 I tell ya , when I got the invite , it really threw me for a loop . You've done a complete 180 . 
 I guess so . 
 Uh-oh . It'll probably cost a lot to fix it . 
 Do you shop online often ? 
 Are there many things online ? 
 Incredible . I really want to survey the on-line virtual supermarket . 
 What are the disadvantages of on-line shopping ? 
 How did I do ? 
 Yes , I do . 
 Exactly how bad ? 
 I don't understand how I could've failed it . 
 What are the reasons ? 
 Can I take the test again ? 
 Can I take your order now , Madam ? 
 I'm happy to recommend the fish , It testes delicious , and it is today's special . Our chef is from the coast , and love seafood . Today special is actually his favorite dish . so I'm sure it is a 
 Is there anything else ? Maybe I can interest you in one of fine appetizers , such as the escargot . 
 Yes , here's the menu . What would you think of your order . 
 What kind of soup would you like ? 
 Ok , is that all ? 
 what would you like anything to drink or you wait ? 
 I want to find an old music box . 
 Do you have anything made in the 1920s ? 
 Do any of them have dancing figures ? 
 That's fantastic . I think I like this one . 
 Now , is there any warranty with this ? 
 I understand . 
 Excuse me . 
 Can you tell me the way to the Peak Tram , please ? 
 Along Queen's Road ... 
 Right at the Hilton . 
 The Cathedral ? 
 That's very kind of you . Thank you.Er ... have you got a pencil ? 
 Can you repeat all that ? I think I'd better write it down . 
 Why ? 
 Oh , that ’ s very sad . 
 What did you do ? 
 That ’ s a good idea . The counselor is a psychologist . He ’ s better trained to handle these sorts of things . 
 Yeah , me too . 
 Nothing really . How about you ? 
 Well , that's cool . 
 I'm busy this Friday . I'm sorry . 
 I'm having dinner with my family 
 I'll make sure and come to your next party . 
 I'll be there . 
 Sure . Come on in . 
 Hello , Mr . lie . I would like to discuss with you the feasibilities of establishing a joint venture with your company . 
 I suggest that we set up a board of directors for the management of the company and share rights and obligations as equal . That is very important . 
 Oh ! Good evening . I'm sorry , but she is not in . She's gone out to the theatre 
 Please come in 
 I was preparing my supper but I've finished now . 
 Oh ! yes 
 I don't think so . It changes so quickly this time . 
 I think you can go to visit the museum . It's worth seeing . You can go to the square some other time . 
 I am really impressed with your presentation skills . 
 Well , your time has been well spent ! 
 Thanks , but I have to admit I am really good at bluffing ! 
 Yes , I am interested in finding a one-bedroom apartment near Washington Square . 
 Oh , good . Can you describe it ? 
 So is there a refrigerator ? 
 It sounds great . How much is the rent ? 
 When can I see it ? 
 Ok , that would be great . 
 My name is Steven . I'm the Sales Manager of this company . 
 Oh , I'm sorry about that . 
 Don't worry , we'll soon fix them . 
 I'll certainly look into that . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 May I show you the gold ones ? 
 OK . Here they are . 
 One thousand yuan . 
 I'm afraid not . The price is very moderate . 
 We brought the price down only a few days ago . This is definitely a bargain . 
 I'd like to check in . 
 Here you are . I'd like a window seat . 
 All right . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Yes . Is there anything you can give me to get rid of it , doctor ? 
 Ok , thank you ! Where should I buy them ? 
 Great ! What floor is pharmacy on ? 
 Thank you ! 
 It is . It ’ s got pictures of interesting building from all over the world , with brief descriptions of how they were build , their purpose , and so on . 
 They don ’ t now , but most of them did originally . There ’ s picture of the pentagon in the United States . It ’ s very distinctive with its five sides . 
 Yes . Usually only towers are cylindrical in shape . 
 This is the world ’ s largest sports stadium . It ’ s a massive oval . 
 It says here that it ’ s mainly used for big football matches and athletics meetings . 
 According to the book , it is . I ’ Ve never seen a building that is a perfect cube . Look at the building . From the air , it looks like a square with a semi-circle attached to each of its four sides . What kind of building is it ? 
 Is the table free ? 
 I don't think so . Is that table all right ? 
 Why do all girls appear feminine after sophomore year ? 
 I feel they all talk and behave in a different way . 
 Some even do make-up slightly . Are you aware that previous ' small potato ' Ma Xiaoxiao becomes a piece of cheese cake recently ? 
 Stop preaching your dream love Marilyn Monroe to me . I know those sexy women are your tastes . 
 I appreciate the saying ' Love consists in this , that two solitude protect , border and salute each other . ' 
 Thursday mornings are usually the slowest around here . Why don ’ t we set it for Thursday at 10:00 a . m . ? 
 That ’ s all right for my department . I don ’ t know how the rest of you feel . 
 Yeah . I need to get some stuff . 
 Where's Lisa ? 
 What are coupons ? 
 Really ? 
 Those guys thought they would never lose . But we finally beat them . And look at them crying now . 
 The car isn't running smoothly . I'd like to have a look at it . 
 I'm not sure . It could be the tires . Let's stop here . 
 Nothing serious . The right one needs some air . 
 He ’ s been on the gravy train these years , hasn ’ t he ? 
 It seems that nobody can always expect things to pan out well each time . 
 Your prescription will be ready in twenty minutes . 
 Yes , in fact , you can renew this prescription over the Internet and have it delivered to your home . 
 You should take it twice a day . 
 You need something in your stomach when you take it . Don ’ t drink alcohol with this medication . 
 Sometimes you might feel dizzy , but that isn ’ t common . 
 I'd like to apply for a credit card with you . 
 Oh , I'm not sure . What's the difference ? 
 Why such a big difference ? 
 My salary is pretty high and I've never had a problem with my credit rating in the past . Are there any perks of the platinum card ? 
 That's great ; my health club membership is about to expire . 
 Three yuan . 
 You put it in the slot at the turnstile and then push the turnstile to get into the platform . 
 That's very easy . The exit is always open . 
 My pleasure . 
 Yeah . There's an express that leaves in twenty minutes . 
 Sure . 
 Go to window number eleven . 
 Can you assure the quality of this air conditioner ? 
 What if there's something wrong with it ? 
 Are you sure ? 
 Have you started cleaning up your room yet ? 
 When exactly do you plan on cleaning it ? 
 I thought I asked you to clean your room earlier . 
 Remember to vacuum the floor and dust everything . 
 Make sure that you don't go anywhere until you clean your room . 
 I'm feeling hungry . 
 Yes , let's get something to eat . 
 Don't cover up your sadness . Let it go . 
 It isn't your fault . No one will blame you . 
 I'm going on a guided tour in the mountain . 
 I like the sight and the sound.It worked on me like a magic when I was a child . 
 Morning , Mum ! 
 No , I am not ill . 
 Nothing . 
 I ... I failed to pass the examination . How I wish I had studied hard . 
 Ok , Mum . I will not fail the examination next time . 
 We need to get food ? 
 What are you going to buy ? 
 Go and look in the kitchen . 
 You should just get the basics . 
 Get some eggs , milk , and bread . 
 Okay , I'll write it down for you . 
 Hi ! Yes , it ’ s been a long time . I ’ m really glad to see you . 
 Just fine . How is everything with you ? 
 I ’ d like that , but I ’ m flying home this afternoon , and I told my parents I ’ d meet them at the airport for lunch . 
 That ’ s a deal . 
 Yes , I ’ m in Titusville . The space shuttle is launched from near there . I ’ Ve seen a lot of space shuttle launches . 
 The shuttle launches are beautiful . I saw one that took off at midnight . The whole sky got bright . 
 I ’ m pretty happy living there . 
 I ’ Ve been to all of them . 
 The Sunshine State certainly is worth visiting . Come down for a vacation sometime . I ’ ll take you to Disney World . 
 I hope you do . And keep in touch , OK ? 
 Here ’ s my business card . Send me an email once in a while . 
 Thank you . I ’ d better get going . I don ’ t want to be late for lunch . Mom would worry . 
 Take good care of yourself , Mary . 
 Bye-bye ! 
 Of course . Did you ? 
 That's sad , but have you gone to the movies recently ? 
 I'm serious , have you ? 
 I really want to go to the movies this weekend . 
 I really don't want to go by myself . 
 No , I think I'm going to go to the movies . 
 I rather doubt it.You ' re cheated by his appearance , I think . 
 You look great ! How do you stay in such good shape ? 
 Wow , it sounds like a lot of work . I guess I'm too lazy to do all that . 
 Hi . You look excited . What's happening ? 
 And you're planning to enter ? 
 Is there a prize ? 
 Do you think you have a chance ? 
 But you haven't practised all that much . 
 Don't be too sure . You're still going to need some help . 
 Hello , I would like to speak with Ryan . 
 Ryan , this is Malia , and I am afraid that I am feeling a bit under the weather . 
 I have a horrible rash from poison oak . 
 The doctor said that I probably have had it a few days . 
 I bought some over-the-counter lotion , and I am taking an antihistamine . 
 I need to get some beef . 
 I want to get some ground beef . 
 I would like four pounds of ground beef . 
 I would like the extra lean . 
 Thank you very much . 
 I appreciate that . 
 I ’ m afraid I ’ m a poor talker . I ’ m not comfortable talking with the people whom I have just met for the first time . That is not very good for business , so I have been studying public speaking . 
 I don ’ t try to lead people . I ’ d rather cooperate with everybody , and get the job done by working together . 
 Yes , in most circumstances . 
 Yes , I like travelling . I am young , and unmarried . It ’ s no problem for me to travel frequently . 
 Hello , this is the Corporate Department of Lincoln Bank calling . We are calling to let you know that some documents have arrived for you at our bank . 
 They're from Schnitt's of Rudesheim , Germany . Would you like us to check them ? 
 It's 150 RIB for the service . 
 You must be pretty excited about your trip to Europe . When is it that you are leaving ? 
 Like what ? 
 You are not going to give it up , are you ? 
 I don ’ t blame you . Perhaps you could sublet it . 
 Mmm ... let me think . Oh , I know just a person . An old colleague of mine , Jim Thomas , is coming here to do some research this summer , from June to August . 
 Tell you what , I ’ ll be calling Jim late this week anyway , so I ’ ll mention it to him then . 
 Do you have any work experience in this field ? 
 What have you learned from the jobs you have had ? 
 Does your current employer know you are looking for another job ? 
 What is your impression of your present company ? 
 What would your current colleague say about you ? 
 How much further do we have to walk ? 
 Shall we have a rest here ? I am tired out . 
 Good idea . So we Can rest in the shadow of the tree . 
 Monica , wait a moment . I think we ’ d better call the repair man to do it . 
 I ’ d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company . 
 Other company rules also need your attention . 
 Don ’ t mention it . 
 We can ’ t break into the line . Don ’ t be so impatient . We ’ ll be at the front of the line soon . 
 Oh no , Ari . I didn ’ t mean for you to pay for me when I invited you to go tonight . Let ’ s go Dutch . I ’ ll pay my own way . I insist . 
 Me , too . It will be great to see something light and funny for a change . I ’ m tired of heavy drama . 
 They ’ re fine , but I can ’ t watch a movie without popcorn . 
 Wow , that's really interesting . So who won ? 
 I've been there ! It really is an amazing work of architecture and art . The entire complex is made of white marble and in the interior of the tomb , the walls are covered with gems and emeralds ! 
 Wait a minute ! It also says that the Christ Re-deemer statue in Brazil and the Colosseum in Rome are wonders . I would love to go to Italy and see the Colosseum , stand in the middle like a gladiator ! 
 Good idea ! 
 Yes , are you ? 
 You don ’ t know what day the elections are ? 
 They ’ re this coming Tuesday . 
 Yes , I ’ m serious . 
 I can ’ t believe you didn ’ t know when the elections were . 
 You should watch the news more often . 
 If you don't mind , let's make it a little later.What about three or four ? 
 All right . 
 Miao Ping , in your opinion , should we go for the Type A or Type B Account ? 
 Thanks for your time . I'll go and discuss everything with my partner and I'll be back later . 
 You don ’ t like the dog ? I promise I will never bring it with me ! 
 A cup of coffee and an apple pie . How about you ? 
 Why don't you drink coffee ? 
 It does taste weird . 
 All right then , Ms . Montgomery . I ’ ll get those plans over to your office by Thursday afternoon . 
 That ’ s what I was thinking . I ’ ll have them there by Thursday . 
 I heard you received a prize for you book . 
 congratulations ! You must be very proud of your achievement . 
 what was the prize ? 
 that ’ s a great prize for a person who writes books ! Have you ever won a prize before ? 
 I won $ 10 in the lottery last month . Perhaps next time , I ’ ll be luckier and win the jackpot ! 
 Yes , please . I'm looking for a sofa . 
 May it be used as a sofa in the day and a bed during the night ? 
 May I see your passport please ? 
 Are you travelling for business or pleasure ? 
 Do you have anything to declare ? Jewellery or cash ? 
 Did you bring any fruits , vegetables , fresh meats or plants into this country ? 
 Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 OK ! How much do you want to deposit ? 
 Would you please fill in a deposit form first ? Please write down your name , your account number and the amount you want to put in . 
 Interest is paid at the rate of 1 % per annum at present . And it is added to your account every year . 
 My pleasure . 
 Speaking . 
 0K . Well , I suppose I have no choice . What do you want me to do ? 
 I'm going out in about half an hour . 
 Oh , around seven o'clock , I suppose . 
 OK . I'll do that . 
 Did you hear the news ? 
 Our cousin went into labor and had her baby last week . 
 I would've thought that somebody would have told you . 
 Well , she did , her baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces . 
 Are you going to go and visit her and the baby ? 
 Good ! I just thought I'd let you know . 
 I'm really tired of my job in the bank . I'm thinking about changing it . 
 Not yet , what's your opinion ? 
 What do you think of the most important things to do when running a business ? 
 So , do you think workers should be paid as little as possible ? 
 How can a business maximise revenues ? 
 What else do you suggest ? 
 What can I help you with today ? 
 What's the problem ? 
 Is there anything else wrong with it ? 
 I can come down and fix that for you if you'd like . 
 How does this afternoon at 2 thirty sound to you ? 
 Alright , so I'll see you then ? 
 Good morning , Mr Bell . How are you today ? Are you here to sort out your L / C documents ? 
 I see , here it says KM509 . 
 Yes , I see what you mean . You need to reject these documents . 
 Many thanks for your present . I'm so glad you are able to come . 
 I think it ’ s great ! I really like the color , and it goes really well with your eyes . I ’ Ve actually been eyeing that dress at Maxine ’ s for a while now , but I wasn ’ t sure I could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment . 
 Yes , that ’ s the price they were advertising it at . I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ? 
 Of course ! Everything at Helen ’ s is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn ’ t you shop around ? 
 What can I do for you , sir ? 
 Yes , I see . five thirty AM Mr . Green , Room 1021 . 
 Ok , could you tell me your room number and your name ? 
 And when would you want us call you this time ? 
 Ok , six thirty AM . We will call you exactly on that time . 
 There you go . 
 How about 6:30 ? 
 When will I get a raise ? 
 You said the same thing three months ago . 
 You mean I won't get a raise until recession ends ? 
 I got the message . I am quitting . 
 We have a requisition form on the company web site . What type of supplies do you need ? 
 How quickly will you need your supplies ? 
 We also will have to check your department budget . Do you know how much money you have for office supplies ? 
 Would you like these supplies delivered or would you like to pick them up ? 
 Fine , well just send the form to us and we will let you know as soon as your supplies come in . Have a good day ! 
 Hello , towing service . What ’ s your problem ? 
 Where are you now ? 
 All right . I got it . What color is your car ? 
 And plate number . 
 Okay . Just stay in your car . We ’ ll be there in five minutes . 
 Hi , Celia ! How was your trip to the United States ? 
 Great . How long were you away ? 
 That's a long time ! Was the weather OK ? 
 So , what was the best thing about your trip ? 
 Are you studying any languages here ? 
 What are you majoring in ? 
 Is it difficult to learn ? 
 Do you know anything about Britain and America ? 
 Right.It ' s important to learn the culture of a nation if you want to learn the language well . 
 We're forming a study group to prepare for the finals . Do you want to join us ? 
 After you try it once this way , I don't think you'll ever put off studying till the end again . 
 We plan to get together once a week . 
 We were talking about Wednesday evenings at the library , from seven to eight . 
 What will you have ? 
 Which do you prefer , meat or fish ? 
 Then why don't you try the Chef's Steak Special ? 
 Hi , is you , John ? 
 Sorry , John . I suddenly got a severe stomachache last night , and stayed in hospital the whole day . 
 I know , I left it at home . 
 It's OK now . Don't worry , John . 
 I know . It's going to be so much fun . 
 I used to be like that . But I go skiing so often that I don't get excited anymore . 
 That makes sense . 
 Whenever I go to Vegas , I get really excited . 
 Looks like anything fun makes you excited . 
 Oh hi Jim . No I just got back . I thought you were on vacation now . 
 Oh wonderful ! Have you been there before or was it your first time ? 
 I'm so jealous of you . I've never been anywhere in Europe . I've always dreamed of traveling around and seeing the sights . 
 There will be a party in my company ; what shall I wear ? 
 I guess it is a formal one because the general director will give a speech there , and most of the staff will take part in . 
 You are right . What about shoes ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Look at that pretty girl . 
 Sorry . The car breaks down and it needs to be repaired . 
 Hello , three-five . 
 I'm sorry , I'm very tired . I'm going to bed early . I didn't have good time , and I don't really want to see you again . 
 It was hardly all night . And I recall it was you doing all the laughing at your own jokes . 
 No , I ' m sorry . I'm going to meet some friends tomorrow evening . And I ' m too tired now . I have to go to sleep . Goodbye . 
 Do you want to help me make the cookies , Anna ? 
 First , put away your toys . 
 I'll get the flour out . 
 May I take your order now ? 
 How would you like your eggs ? 
 And your toast , light or dark ? 
 Now or later ? 
 Will there be anything else ? 
 One hard-boiled egg with toast and orange juice to follow . 
 Just a moment , please . 
 What is it ? 
 Is the water causing any damage ? 
 I won ’ t be able to fix the pipe until tomorrow . 
 I ’ ll do it for you . 
 That ’ s true . 
 I ’ m all right with that . 
 I don't like it very much.But every-body likes their own food best . 
 Are you sure ? All the big cities have specialty shops , which sell all sorts of ethnic foods . 
 What are you two doing in here ? 
 I was sitting there giving out nametags and all of a sudden , there she was . 
 All these memories of prom night came back to me . I had to be alone . You remember that night ? 
 Excuse me , is there a Post Office around here ? 
 How do I get there from here ? 
 How far is that ? 
 Excuse me . Can you tell me how to get started using these machines ? 
 Yes . 
 Nice to meet you . 
 No , I don't . So I need some help . 
 Yes , I know that.Derek just led me through the warm up in the aerobics room.So I'm ready , I think . I can start using the machines . 
 What do you mean--a membership card ? I already have one . 
 I'm ready . 
 I see . So this card helps me to keep track of my progress . 
 Alright . Great . 
 Great . Why don't we start on the machines ? 
 I'm sorry . I know there are still seven machines . But I'm exhausted . 
 What can I do though ? I don't know the proper settings for the rest of the machines . 
 Yes . I suppose it's best to stop . 
 Yes , I am an outgoing person who likes to be with a lot of friends . 
 Well , the most important thing in communication is your sincerity . 
 I'm glad you came . I hope you enjoyed it . 
 Good morning , sir . Can I help you ? 
 O . K . Ticket , please . 
 Would you like a window or an aisle seat , Mr . Smith ? 
 Very well . Do you have any bags to check ? 
 Here you are , seat 12c . Please go to gate 23 after passing through the security checkpoint . 
 Have a nice day . 
 OK , let's find somebody then . 
 Wait a second , Vince . You know what ? Why don't you let me handle it ? 
 Yeah . Let me see if he'll do it , and I'll get back to you . 
 Don't sweat it . I know just the guy . 
 There were some bad misses in his defence , so he lost it . 
 I suppose he's not in top form . 
 Is he beating Mark ’ s time ? 
 I found out when Jim's birthday is . It's this Friday . 
 Can you spread the word and ask everyone to bring some kind of snack food ? 
 Will you call his wife and let her know so that if she is available , she can come too ? 
 I don't know how old he is though . 
 Do you want any meat today , Mrs Bird ? 
 Do you want beef or lamb ? 
 This lamb's very good . 
 What about some steak ? This is a nice piece . 
 Do you want a chicken , Mrs Bird ? They're very nice . 
 To tell you the truth Mrs . Bird , I don't like chicken , either ! 
 Guess again , Dave . I have no intention of leaving invoking . Never did . 
 That's right , Dave . I tricked you into giving a confession . And I've recorded every word of it . 
 I saw your green post-it notes . Nobody else has them . 
 Certainly , Miss Parker , Let me get my book . My secretary ’ s out and I can ’ t keep anything straight ! 
 No – That ’ s all right . How about the 30th at 4:00 p . m . ? – Is an hour enough ? 
 Yes , I find jogging does good to me , so I keep on doing it . 
 I think so , too . 
 I need to have some money transferred from the UK , from my company . It's kind of an emergency . 
 That would be wonderful . The problem is I don't have an account with you . That is a problem , isn't it ? 
 T / T ? What on earth is that ! ? Sorry , but I've never heard of it . T / T ? 
 Dentale Associates . I'm afraid there's nobody available to answer your call . Please leave your name and telephone number and we'll call you back . Please speak clearly after the beep . 
 Oh ! My mouth is on fire ! 
 I need more water ! 
 It's your fault for mixing the two broths ! 
 Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time ? 
 Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour . 
 That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ’ s eight time zones east of Greenwich ! 
 I'd like to talk to Mr . White please ? 
 When is a good time to catch him ? 
 Hello , again . Did you discuss everything with your colleagues ? 
 Have you decided how you would like the salaries paid ? 
 That's not a problem . 
 Thank you very much . We always welcome new customers . 
 What happened ? Did your boss say something to offend you at work ? 
 Don ’ t you think you are overreacting a little ? Calling you by nicknames shouldn ’ t be so bad ... 
 That ’ s what you get for working in a male-dominated field . I think you ’ ll find that most male bosses in your industry are already conditioned to treat females in this way . You probably won ’ t be able to change him . 
 I ’ m afraid many people would turn thumbs down on it . 
 Definitely . But I think it is too fierce . 
 What kind of car do you want ? 
 Mazda . Honda and Nissan . 
 That was a great dinner . I didn't know that you knew how yo cook . 
 I don't know . I'm pretty full . What are we having ? 
 Ooh , that's my favorite . Maybe I'll have a small slice . 
 I'll have a cup of tea . 
 Actually , could I have some milk with that ? 
 Skim , please . That'd be very nice . Thanks ... oh no . Janna , I'm so sorry , but I've got to go . 
 I just got a message from my sister saying that she's been in a car accident . I need to go pick her up . 
 She's on the M40 , near Reading . 
 I don't know , she didn't say . I'm so sorry about this . 
 Actually , I've only got a two-seater . I'll have to go on my own . 
 I will . Thanks a lot . 
 Yes . Can I help you ? 
 Yes , you could if it's kept intact . But don't you want to get a bigger size ? 
 Are they ? In that case , I'll be glad to give your money back . 
 Never mind . It ’ s just my duty . 
 Ah , hello . I'm calling to find out how I apply for a car loan . 
 Yes , I do . It's ready and waiting in my account . 
 Could I just stop you there ? Sorry to interrupt , but I have already been to your appointed dealer and selected the car I want . 
 Yes , it's 110,000 RIB . So , with the down payment done , I will need to borrow 70,000 RIB . 
 Yes , I have everything here . OK , I'll come in and see you later today . Maybe I could have my new car as early as next week ! How exciting ! 
 The dress is made on your measurement . 
 OK , maybe you can try this one on . It's yellow . 
 I ’ Ve been really busy . How is everything ? 
 Yeah , why not ? I ’ Ve got a little free time on my hands . Where do you want to eat ? 
 Like how ? 
 What did you have in mind ? 
 Do you know how short you want your hair to be ? 
 That's pretty short . Are you sure about this ? 
 I'm going to do it , but you have to be sure you really want me to . 
 Fine then . Let's get started . 
 Yes , it's my steak . 
 It's too raw . I wanted mine well done , but this one here is almost medium . 
 Very good . It's done just right this time , thank you . 
 Yes , please give me another Calsberg . 
 No , thank you . I've had enough . 
 Yes , I will have a cup of coffee . 
 I need the number for John Reese ’ s office . 
 Lisa , I'm so glad to see you . How are you doing ? 
 Me too . We haven't seen each other for years . 
 How time flies ! Now you are a college student out of a little girl . 
 Couldn't be better . 
 She's been good . She is in grade one in Joy Chain high school . And she dreams to be a volunteer in 2008 . 
 I am interested in watching TV or other relaxing games . 
 I usually read or entertain myself . 
 My favorite books are those about detectives . 
 When it comes to the entertainment , I think I enjoy dancing . There is nothing I like more than modern dance . 
 Wait a minute ! Just hold your horses ! What's your hurry , anyway ? 
 That won't take long . 
 Well , I'm not quite ready . 
 You wouldn't do a thing like that ! 
 It's your turn , sir.Sorry to keep you waiting . 
 How do you want your hair cut ? Any particular way ? 
 How about the sides ? 
 Excuse me . Do you know where I can find the nearest ICCC ? 
 Do I need to take a bus ? 
 How do I get there on foot ? 
 Wait , let me write this down ... Alright , I'm ready . 
 Square ... turn right ... traffic lights ... And then ? 
 Tall building ... Which side is the building on ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Did you hear that they are going to start an exercise class after work ? 
 Next month . I think . Are you going to sign up ? 
 I've just got the examination results . I am afraid you haven't passed . 
 I am afraid so . I am terribly sorry ! 
 Don't worry about that , I am sure they will understand . After all , it was a very difficult exam . 
 You can always take it again . 
 Is there anything good playing ? 
 Really ? I want to go , too . 
 No problem . 
 I get a lump in my throat whenever I see a tragic movie . 
 But their love is touching ! 
 I am not ! 
 It's all in the bag . 
 I need that to relax . I'm going to put a few drops in my bath water . 
 They all have essence of flowers in them . 
 Mommy , can I stay up until eleven o'clock ? 
 Taxi . 
 I am going to the railway station . 
 Thank you . Can we get there in half an hour ? 
 My train will leave at 3:00 , I'll have to arrive there before 2:50 . 
 Can't we go faster ? 
 Hello ! 
 Speaking . 
 Hello , George.What ' s up ? 
 It was a kind of sixth sense . 
 No . 
 Yeah , I didn't get the job in the end . 
 It's ok , that's life . 
 Work is work , whether it ’ s a part-time or temporary job or a full-time gig . 
 All you need to do is fill in the blanks correctly on the Continued Claim Form , and the EDD Office will take care of the rest . 
 It is to your advantage to work as much as you can . 
 Yes , I once booked there . They give the immediate confirm information and flight information to both your mobile phone and e-mail . You can conveniently pay by credit card , so the whole transaction only takes a couple of minutes . They also provide e-tickets , meaning you don ’ t need to go to any office to pick an air ticket . You go to the airport directly and check in with your ID card . 
 Yes , therefore they are expanding the scope of their service . For example , hotels can be booked through the same site as well . 
 Thanks , Frank . I ’ d love to come . When is it ? 
 Sounds like fun . You can count me in ! Just give me directions to the restaurant . 
 I did only simple things in the office , such as tidying up the office , serving tea , typing and filing , and so on . 
 I took such courses as Secretarial Principles , Office Administration , Business English , and Public Relations . 
 You're talking to her . 
 I was busy doing something . I apologize . 
 Did you need something ? 
 Is there somewhere special you wanted to go ? 
 A movie sounds good . 
 I will see you tomorrow . 
 Julie ! It's good to see you again . How have you been ? 
 Really ? How was it ? 
 I hear the beaches in Thailand are beautiful . 
 I do like Thai food . Did you see much of Bangkok ? 
 I know what you mean . I could use a vacation myself . 
 Yeah , it sure would . 
 The one with a very big nose . 
 OK . 
 No , thank you . 
 That would be great . 
 I need it delivered tomorrow . Will that be possible ? 
 I need it delivered at 12 . 
 That's not a problem ? 
 That's great ! Thank you very much . 
 This is a special adhesive for easing the pain . Apply it to the painful area and change it in every 2 days . 
 Apply some of the ointment , and rub it into the skin . 
 Not at all . 
 Sure , what time will you like to depart ? 
 Actually , one just left ten minutes ago . The next one is at two forty-five , debates at five thirty-five . 
 Sure , that will be thirty-two dollars please . 
 I'd like a table for two , please . 
 No , I'm afraid not . Can I sit over there ? There's a table free by the window . 
 Fine . I'll sit here . 
 I'll have a double whiskey on the rocks . 
 Yes , I have many things to buy . I would like to choose the cleaning milk first . 
 Dry . That's my problem . 
 Sounds good . What about shampoo ? I would like to buy the product that prevents scurf . 
 Is it a newcomer ? 
 I do not care the brand as long as it works well . 
 I want to buy the toothpaste , the brand of Jiajieshi . 
 John seems to be in high cotton . He may well become a big shot . 
 What is your idea ? 
 I don't know what I can do now . I'm down and out . 
 I hope so . But I'm always caught short . 
 Oh my god ! It's 10:00 pm . I have to go . 
 I am afraid not . 
 Thank you . Well , if you ever pass my home , please drop in . 
 Yes , sure . Have a sweet dream ! 
 Yes , Sally . I want to do some sit-ups and perhaps get in a game of singsong . 
 I'd love it.Working out is more fun with a friend . 
 Good.If you happen to see Jim and Bob on the way see if they would like a game of singsong . 
 I hope nothing is wrong . 
 What's the matter ? 
 Oh , no . Is it serious ? 
 Of course . I'm sorry for your daughter . 
 Not at all . 
 Sure . Let me just grab my wallet . You certainly do look happy this morning . 
 This is a first ! You must have won the lottery . 
 What should we take ? 
 Good idea ! 
 I think so , ‘ cause I remember the policeman told me this is the very way . 
 Just head straight up the street about two blocks and then turn left . 
 Hello , Mary . 
 Here is my friend Bob . 
 Well , I've never downloaded music before . How does it work ? 
 Alright . But why is downloading music better than buying Cds at the store ? 
 I ’ m so relieved that your ankle wasn ’ t broken ! I feel just awful about this whole thing . I wanna make it up to you . Let me take you out to dinner tonight . My treat . 
 Perfect ! 
 Me too.You look so beautiful tonight ! I wish this night would never end.There ’ s something I have to tell you ... 
 I woke up today thinking this would be just like any other ordinary day , but I was wrong . A twist of fate brought us together . I crashed into your life and you into mine , and this may sound crazy , but I ’ m falling in love with you , Veronica . 
 Could I speak to Mr Wood , please ?

 I think you should look over these figures again . There are some calculations that are a bit off . 
 Apology is accepted . Try to do better next time . 
 Are you travelling in America ? 
 What do you do ? 
 I know all the tricks of the trade . It is quite tiring and difficult to be promoted . 
 I am a reporter at a TV station . 
 Yes , I have good working conditions and I would require a salary at least 15 , 000 $ a year . 
 I report the social news which means I always interview the citizens of various professions and trades . 
 Sometimes . News happened out of expectation . Sometimes I have to get up in the early morning while I can't sleep for editing and interviewing . 
 That's right . I am still wet behind the ears . 
 She's the one who saved the life of my son at the beach last year . 
 Could I meet with you to discuss the project ?

 I think the afternoon would be best . 
 Yes , I will bring my plans with me to the meeting . 
 I feel that the whole committee needs to be there . 
 Yes , I know how to get there on my own . 
 Thank you for agreeing to come in and meet with us today . 
 I can see from your resume you were in charge of sales for Corporate World Unlimited from 1997 to 1999 . Can you please tell me about your responsibilities ?

 Hi , taxi . 
 The international airport , please . I have to be there by 8 
 Oh , that's my stop . How much do I need to pay ? 
 Thanks a lot.here . 
 I like to live here and enjoy my neighbors ' company . And I don't think I should waste money just because I have much of it . 
 Oh , the car is old but still in good condition . I just think we should be thrifty , whether you are rich or not . 
 But what ? Just remember that thrift is not only a great virtue , but also a great revenue . 
 Where are you going for your holidays , Charles ? 
 Good gracious ! You certainly are lucky . How are you going there ? 
 I once went to Singapore by air . It was very exciting-but never again . 
 For a short time . One of the engines caught fire . 
 He put it out and flew back to the airport . Then he asked the people at the airport where the emergency runway was . 
 Yes , we did . But I shall never fly again . 
 I would say it was a typical run-of-the-mill Hollywood thriller . 
 Special effects ? Baloney ! That movie was made on a shoestring budget . They've been using trick photography like that for years 
 You should read the book . The original story is much better and has a different twist at the end . 
 Read it yourself and find out ! 
 Yes , please . I'm picking out some presents for my children and wife . 
 Actually , I don't know exactly . Do you have anything recommended ? 
 Hey , How did you know I came from America ? 
 How much again ? 
 That's really cheap for shoes like those . OK , I'll take 5 pairs . 
 Why not ? 
 Oh , my God . I've totally forgotten about that . Anyway , I think she would like a bottle of perfume . 
 DENY ? That's very expensive in America . It costs nearly $ 70 for only 50ml . 
 That's very unbelievable . Is it fake ? 
 OK , I'll take one .

 I'm sorry , but no . We used to have a trainer , but then he had an unfortunate accident . 
 What kind of jewellery do you like to have ? 
 May I show you gold ones or platinum ones ? 
 Pure gold or carats ? 
 OK . 
 1336 yuan . 
 Not because I ’ m keeping an eye on the baby . 
 She is at the supermarket downstairs . She said she would be back in about half an hour . 
 I've never seen anything like it . 
 Yes , I ’ m here to see Joanna Stevens . I have an appointment at four . 
 Sure , it ’ s Josh O ’ Neil . 
 Yes , a coffee would be nice , thank you . 
 I think it's important that all people have the ability to read . 
 I'd like to purchase a pan . 
 Well , I cook a lot of big meals . 
 Yes , that's the right size , but it's so heavy . 
 Yes , this is very light . But the handle is also aluminum . 
 Great . This is exactly what I was looking for . I'll buy it . 
 Yes . Oh , wait a second , please . What about a lid ?

 I am so sorry about that . It was just a slip of the tongue . 
 No problem at all ! I am taking a long road trip and I want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition . 
 Not that long ago , I think it was four months ago . 
 Why ? I mean , what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ? 
 I see . What else ? 
 Ok , well , when you put it that way , it doesn ’ t seem like a waste of time and money . 
 Thank you . You do me a big favor . 
 Nowadays fewer and fewer people go to the movie theaters to see films . So I am afraid that the film studios are really getting hard time to survive . 
 But it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past . 
 Excuse me , is this personnel division ? 
 I came about your advertisement for a senior production planner . 
 My name is Li Jean . 
 Yes , seven years . 
 Master of Marketing Management .

 Because you need a senior production planner who is good at mathematics and fluent in English . I think I am fit for the position . 
 That's very good . 
 That would be great . Thanks ! 
 I am not surprised , you eat too much . 
 No , I wouldn't think so . 
 Well , why don't you go on the diet ? 
 Perhaps you should excercise more . Why don't you go to an exercise class . 
 Do you use an anti-virus program to protect your computer ? 
 How often do you run your anti-virus program ? 
 Which anti-virus program would you recommend ? 
 That sounds very good . Which website should I visit to download it ? 
 What do you use your computer for ?

 Yes . What will you do these two days ? 
 But I'd prefer to stay at home and have a good rest . 
 Me too .

 Surely , of course . What kind of currency have you got ? 
 How much would you like to change ? 
 Would you like to go to a concert tonight ? 
 All right , then.There is one at the new concert hall . 
 It's the Powell orchestra . 
 They're doing a seventeenth-century program . 
 Well , I'm not sure of his name , but I know it's going to be his farewell performance . 
 it was wonderful , but I was so tired . 
 yes , that was the first thing we did . We went all the way to the top . There were visitors from all over the world taking photos there . 
 art galleries , cathedrals , statues , fountains , palaces , bistros , there's really too much to say . 
 yes , at the beginning we were all excited and had lots of fun . However , on the third day of traveling in the city , I felt sick . I think I had something bad to eat , but it passed by the evening . 
 on the fouth day , we went to taste the French cuisine . That was really fantastic ! And no stomach problems .

 Well , they took us along with some paramedics.There was this guy who fell off his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as well as a couple of compound fractures . His wounds were pretty serious so they had to rush him to the hospital . It was intense !

 What's the band called ? 
 Hi , sorry to have kept you waiting . 
 How are you ? 
 Did you lock the doors ?

 Hello , Elitherbeth How are you ? 
 Are you sure you ’ re alright . You look a bit worry today ? Is anything wrong ? 
 of course if I can . 
 Oh dear . That ’ s terrible . What was in your wallet ? 
 Well , If I were you , I would go to the police station straight away and calling . 
 Oh dear . What a pity . Are you sure you lost your wallet in theatre ? 
 I think you should put an advertisement in china daily . Things where you lasted . 
 Wait a minute , My uncle lives in Beijing and he lives very close to theatre . I ’ Ve telephone here and ask him to go to theatre to require it . We ’ d better have breakfast now . and meet him later . 
 Yes . My name ’ s Mark Benson . I just started a couple of weeks ago . 
 Thanks , I appreciate that ! 
 That ’ s a matter of opinion . 
 I worked with him for two years . That was the worst time in my career .

 to tell the truth . i don't like it , it's too noisy . 
 oh , it's really beautiful . but i just can't dance it well . 
 ok . 
 Would you mind if I smoked ? 
 What are you doing ? 
 Let regive you a hand . 
 Why do you want to spend your summer days in a mountain village ? 
 I don't agree with you . It's too small to live . 
 I disagree , a big town is more lively . 
 Well , alright , I agree with you about that , but I still prefer a big town . 
 No . Have you ? 
 What does she look like ? 
 How tall would you say that she is ? 
 What about her facial features ? 
 I think I know who you're talking about . 
 I think that I have . 
 Our country is a free trade nation . She was mainly agriculture and rather a backward country and mow has developed into a modern highly industrialized state with an expanding economy . Parallel to this , her dependence upon foreign trade has increased . Increased output generates a greater need for raw materials , semi-finished products and capital goods . Thus . in many fields , our country is an important and growing market for exporters from other countries . But this doesn't mean that our country is an easy market , because of a liberal import policy and the high standard in our market is keen . 
 The price factor can be a useful instrument for exporters when trying to place their products in industrialized countries . Of course , marketing goods abroad is not only a question of price . There are also other important factors such as design , quality of goods , terms of sale , transport and insurance . 
 I am sorry , sir , the fish you ordered will take a longer time because we make it with fresh fish . 
 Sure , is dry white wine OK ? 
 We need to figure out how much money we are spending and what we are spending it on ? 
 Well , I think we could be saving more . 
 Let's see . We spent 700 dollars for our home loan payment , 400 on groceries , 75 on utilities , 250 on gasoline , 100 on books and 300 on entertainment last month . 
 We put 500 into the savings account and 750 into our stock account . 
 Right . 
 Hi there . I need to change some dollars into local currency . Can I do that here ? 
 Well , that depends . What's the rate like today ? 
 That sounds pretty good . OK , I'll change 500 USD today , thanks . 
 Everyone has his own habits , but these habits are not very good . The noise often spoils other people ’ s appetite . 
 The westerners use knives and forks to eat so it is complicated . The Chinese use a pair of chopsticks and eat out of the same plate . I assume it is less complicated , right ? 
 It seems that people share the same basic sense of etiquette regardless of their background . Apart from the different tools used for eating we seem to follow the same principles . We do not let inappropriate manners spoil other people ’ s appetite.Westerners like to say , “ bon appetite ” before meals which is one way to suggest “ mind your table manners . ” Is there such an expression in Chinese ? 
 What forms should I fill out to collect unemployment ? 
 Where do I get the application form for unemployment benefits ? 
 What information will I need to provide to apply for unemployment ? 
 What else will the Employment Development Office need ? 
 What will happen next ? 
 Can you tell me what bus to catch from Altadena to downtown LA ? 
 That bus goes all the way to LA ? 
 Is the bus ride long ? 
 That's all ? 
 Is there always a lot of people on that bus ? 
 Oh okay , thank you . 
 Do you want some dessert ? 
 Wait a moment . I will calculate it for you . Your bill comes to $ 36 . 
 Who is on duty ? 
 Your duty is to keep a check on those prisoners from now on . 
 It seems to me that you are on very good terms with him . 
 He must be all over you the first time he saw you . 
 That means he was head over heels in love with you . 
 But I think he can't hold a candle to you . I don't think he has ever popped the question . 
 Do you know that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes ? 
 Excellent ! Now , as you know , the day has barely begun . 
 I want to hit a few more places in the city , but I need a place to put my luggage . 
 Leave a deposit ? Isn't leaving the luggage enough of a deposit ? 
 Hmm . I'll have to think about this for a second . 
 Can you drive ? 
 Are you willing to drive yourself if the job requires ? 
 One more thing , if you are wanted in this position , you must prepare to travel aboard frequently . 
 Would you mind relocating ? 
 It ’ s quite far away , though it's located in another part of the city . Are you planning to find a boarding house nearby ? 
 Good . Do you have any particular conditions that you want us to take into consideration ? 
 Then you'll need to know it's a hard job . You'll often have to work overtime or even on weekends . 
 your daughter will be back soon . I'm going to start making dinner . You can just watch some TV in TV room if you like . We just bought a new TV with a LCD screen . The remote control is on the coffee ta 
 this is supposed to be your vacation ; we'd like you to just relax . 
 ok , well , we're going to make a pan of lasagne , a salad , and some garlic bread . Here's the recipe . Do you want to get the ingredients we need out of the cupboard ? 
 that's a good idea . Can you set the oven to 200 degrees Celsius ? 
 fine . I'll just get out the casserole dish , the saucepan , the salad bowl , and the baking sheet . 
 I don't think it's broken . 
 fine . I'll go vacuum . Let me know if you need any other help . 
 no idea . We've enjoyed both the natural scenery and the city sights . What else is there to see ? 
 you mean visit a factory ? 
 good idea ! I've always been interested in that . How much is the entrance fee ? 
 really ? What do the companies do that for ? 
 oh , i see . So factory tours are good for companies as well as visitors . 
 do we need an appointment beforehand ? 
 Does Tom drink a lot ? 
 That's a problem . He has sort of Dutch courage and that will egg him on in doing anything . 
 Yes , Would you like to have the seats in the front or at the back ? 
 Excuse me . Do you have a minute ? I'd like to tell you about the Bucky Card . 
 Do you know about the Bucky Card ? 
 The Bucky Card is a great way for you to save money while you have a good time here at school.It gives you discounts on all kinds of things . Movies , pizza , clothing , school supplies . 
 The Card doesn't actually give you discounts on beer.But it will give you discounts on certain club cover charges.So if you want to see your favorite band at Amy's or Cosmo's Club , you get a discount on the entrance fee . 
 Usually it's two dollars off the cover price . 
 This pamphlet shows you what restaurants and movie theaters have discounts.And twice every semester we will send you a new issue of the pamphlet.The Bucky Card has just started.Every couple months we have new businesses joining our program.It ' s a great way for students to save money ! 
 It costs only 19 dollars a year for a card . 
 But think of how much money you'll save ! You can use it for a year . 
 What's new ? 
 We have been over this a hundred times ! We are not getting a pet ! 
 Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ? 
 What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog . 
 We ’ re planning on having children soon , I don ’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house . 
 I ’ ll tell you what , I can get you some hamsters and we ’ ll take it from there . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Yes , sir . Just as the sign says . How many ? 
 How many people are you paying the tax for ? 
 100 yuan each , so you owe me 200 yuan . 
 Here are your two receipts . 
 Just give these receipts to the lady at the door to immigration . Don't worry , she'll ask for them from you . 
 We are all the same the first time we travel overseas . You guys have a nice trip . 
 If you wanna keep healthy , you must give up smoking . It's extremely bad for your health , you know . 
 Well , I've got an idea , put the label cancer sticks on each pack of cigarettes , and read it before you smoke . It may give you a feeling to reduce it . 
 Why are you so angry , darling ? 
 May I see the manager of your company ? 
 Form your company's advertisement in the TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY , I learn that you are a foreign trade company of good service . I am interested in it.Here is my resume , ma'am .

 To press the suit only takes 3 hours . The laundry will be returned to you tomorrow around noon time . Is that all right ? 
 Right away , sir . 
 Yes , Christine ? 
 Sure . You just walk down this hallway . The copy room is the second room on the right . 
 Yes , please . Can I exchange money here ? 
 To be honest , I really wanted to exchange my GAP , but I suppose USD will be fine . I have some and I just need a little local currency for expenses . Could you tell me what the rate is like today ? 
 OK , that sounds fine . I think 200 USD worth of RIB should be plenty , thanks . 
 Here it is . 
 For one week . 
 For sightseeing . 
 At the Hilton hotel . 
 No , nothing . 
 Yes . How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ? 
 Hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world . 
 Yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies ! 
 Are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short voice ? 
 Yeah , I think so . 
 Wonderful ! I'll start packing our suitcases . 
 I ’ m in need of your services . 
 I have a court date coming up . 
 It ’ s the felony charge . 
 What ’ s your rate ? 
 That ’ s too high . 
 I ’ ll hire you anyway . 
 Thank you , Mr . Cooper . I hope we get the contract . 
 Yes , there is an underground car park near the supermarket . 
 Excuse me , would you like to be our guide ? 
 It's our first time to be here , so would you please arrange a schedule for us ? 
 When was the palace built ? 
 I need to increase the amount of my L / C . It's quite a new one ; I opened it 12 days ago . 
 How do I go about that ? 
 OK , you can take that from my account . I'll fill in the form now . 
 Hi , Lander . What's wrong ? 
 Same here . I have't brought any new clothes for three months . 
 True . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities . 
 Hello , Steven . How do you get along with your job ? 
 Practice makes perfect . By the way , what do you learn from your job ? 
 Yeah , you are a good learner . I must commend you for your good performance . 
 I appreciate your effort very much . The coffee break is over ; it's about time we set to work . 
 Mr . Chandler will be our new partner , so his visit this time will be extremely important for our cooperation in future , because it may decide whether Mr . Chandler sign the trade contract with us or not . Do you have some idea ? 
 En , you are right , and he will trust us and maybe the contract will be signed soon . But remember to keep some skills of our manufacturing secret . On one hand , show his our best side ; on the other hand , do not show too much to protect our own business secrets . 
 Please make a detailed schedule on the visit this afternoon . 
 Ok , every one asks their parents let them stay out until 2 or 3 in the morning . 
 That ’ s absurd . I know some junior high kids who can stay out later than that . 
 Ok , how about midnight curfew . and I'll let you know where I am . 
 right now ? 
 i think i'll be a little afraid . 
 afraid of making a mistake . 
 all right . i'll give it a try . 
 Can I get a burger and a large fries ? 
 A large coke , please . 
 Eating here , please . 
 If one is rich , is the happy ? 
 Could I understand what you said as the poorest is the happiest ? 
 This book I'm reading about Yoga is really interesting . 
 I don't really practice it regularly yet , I'm just learning about it . 
 Right now I'm learning about the importance of breathing slow , deep and regularly . 
 Yes . It says here , ' He who only half breathes , half lives . ' 
 Oh , Ralph , I heard it is very dangerous traveling in space . Disasters have happened before . If the spaceship were out of order . . . 
 But is it possible that travelers could be hit by meteors ? 
 What do you think is the real danger man faced in space ? 
 I'd like to have a couple of complete sets of paper money and coins . 
 Ah , where can I find old paper money and coins used before and after 1949 ? 
 Good . Sorry to have troubled you so much , Miss . 
 No , thanks . I did not notice it has been dark outside . I think it is time to dinner . 
 Do you have anything to do after this ? 
 Shall we drop in somewhere for a couple of drinks ? 
 I know a very interesting place . 
 David , we have been doing business for three years , haven't we ? 
 So , I wish to apply for the sole agency of your product in our local market . If you give us the agency , that will be more substantial for our cooperation . 
 As we are a well-established company , we are very familiar with the customers ' needs . Besides , we can make full use of our good connections with the wholesalers and retailers here and develop a good market for your products if appointed as your agent . 
 To be on the safe side , and for garment of all materials , sizes , and styles , I think the amount will be 50,000 pieces a year . 
 No , certainly not . 
 It is , isn't it ? 
 I want to find a book called Gone with the Wind.But I can't find it . 
 Margaret Mitchell . 
 Thank you very much . I have been looking for it for a long time.Is this the latest edition ? 
 How about the price of the hardcover ? 
 A little bit expensive , but I will buy one.This is $ 25 , here you are . 
 Just fine , Karen . I ’ m just taking a breather from all this paper work ! 
 I ’ ll have to try it . You know how I am about Italian food ! What ’ s the name ? 
 I like it very much . 
 No , I don ’ t mind at all . I receive 3,000 RIB a month , after tax . 
 I ’ m afraid there isn ’ t . My boss only pays lip service . 
 My expectation is in the 3800 to 4500 RIB range . That ’ s the take-home pay . 
 Yes , it is . Are you looking for housing for this semester ? 
 It is , but I can put you on a waiting list , if you would like . 
 Yes , here is a catalog that is put out every year with locations that meet campus requirements for As . 
 The individual landlord's numbers are next to each entry . You can call them with any questions you may have . 
 Good afternoon , Mr . Black . Haven't seen you for a long time . Can I help you ? 
 Let me see if he is free . Would you please sit down and wait for a moment ? 
 The manager will come to see you in a few minutes . 
 You are welcome . 
 Thanks , but I don't want to put you into any trouble . 
 This house is very nice for me , but I can ’ t afford it in a lump sum . 
 That ’ s good . Will you tell me the details ? 
 How long will it take ? 
 I need to talk it over with my wife . 
 Welcome to the Consultancy Department , I'm Greg Wu . What can I assist you with today ? 
 How so ? 
 We are able to do credit investigations globally . You have no need to worry . 
 10 years ago , maybe yes . But nowadays we are a global village , it's easy to deal with any foreign country . 
 I'll look forward to it and make sure all of the paperwork is ready and waiting . 
 A report says running red lights causes one thousand traffic accidents every year . 
 Maybe they know they shouldn ’ t run a red light , but when they are driving they don ’ t pay enough attention to traffic lights . 
 I know . If a policeman catches you using the cell phone while driving , you will be fined . 
 Are you trying to lose weight ? 
 You don ’ t have to starve yourself to lose weight . I think that ’ s where you ’ re going wrong . 
 Not really . You should try to not eat foods high in calories , salts or saturated fats . Stay away from oily food and artificial flavors . 
 Yes ! You can also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates and foods that are high in cholesterol . You can have steamed veggies or increase your protein intake found in chicken or fish . 
 Don ’ t count on it . 
 I've got to be going now too . 
 See you later . 
 Oh , thank you . 
 That will be best . I'd like to have a good rest first . 
 Ok . Shall we discuss the schedule in the lobby ? 
 Where to , miss ? 
 Sure thing . So , where are you flying in from ? 
 Really ? You don ’ t look very Chinese to me , if you don ’ t mind me saying so . 
 Wow sounds interesting ! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but , how old are you ? 
 Don ’ t get me wrong ! It ’ s just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas ! 
 I am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old U . S of A , although I have some Colombian heritage . 
 Uh ... yeah .. of course ! 
 No . I'm still working on it . 
 Give me one more day . 
 It was alright . I ran into Bill and we got to talking for a while.He ’ s in a bit of a jam . 
 Well , his son had an accident and Bill doesn ’ t have health insurance . This really got me thinking , and I wondered if we shouldn ’ t look into a couple of different HMO ’ s . 
 Exactly ! I searched on the web and found a couple of HMO ’ s with low co-pays and good coverage . The deductibles are low , too . 
 Well , we don ’ t have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions , so we should be fine . 
 Not in a million years ! 
 Yes , I hear about it every time she comes here . 
 I think she misses that job and wants to take it out on us . 
 I think she just likes to make us miserable . 
 My hair stood on end when I saw the bloody scene . 
 A kitten being run over by a truck . 
 Yes . 
 Where should I sit ? 
 Who's Brad ? 
 When does the first period begin , by the way ? 
 I've heard you're going to America tomorrow . I want to see you off at the airport . 
 What time are you leaving ? 
 What airline and what flight ? 
 I'll see you at the airport at 12 thirty P . m . 
 What course did you like best ? 
 Do you feel that you have received a good general training ? 
 Hello , Mr . Hao . I am calling to tell you that you are not selected as our employee . Sorry . 
 Maybe . But you should not withdraw forever just because you failed once . 
 May I help you , Miss ? 
 OK . I'm sure you will love what this new automatic answering system can do for your business . 
 Watch our computer demonstration , please . You'll be convinced that our product is superior . ( After the demonstration ) 
 Our systems are 100 % trouble-free .

 OK . I hope you will be in touch with me shortly . 
 Direct or non-direct ? 
 Yes . Right now it's the slack season so we will give you ten percent off . 
 Sure . you can get a further discount at 5 % . 
 Don ’ t think any more about it . 
 It ’ s really not necessary . I know your intention was good . 
 Help ! I'm about to drop these books . 
 Thanks ! 
 I'm afraid you've got the wrong extension . 
 Sure , please hold on . 
 Now Mr . Tylor's on the line . Go ahead , please . 
 You are welcome . Bye ! 
 Yes , it's a family tradition dating back to my childhood . We use the same lights and ornaments , but of course we have a new tree each year.The children made some of these decorations . Here , you can hang this on one of those high branches . 
 Oh , yes . The kids are too excited to wait . After we clean up the mess all the empty boxes and the wrapping paper we have a big breakfast . Then the kids have the whole day to play with their new toys . 
 Would you like to see our new shirts ? 
 Well , they are very nice you know . 
 And not expensive either . 
 Everybody is buying them . 
 Yes , they are very fashionable , you see . 
 I see . 
 Sorry I couldn't help you . 
 Oh , it ’ s Death on the Nile . Have you read it ? 
 Sure . I didn ’ t know you like mysteries . 
 Ah ! No ! Damn it ! 
 So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work . 
 No , I didn't save this time.Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too . 
 I hate computers . Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth . 
 I don't know . I feel like going out . 
 It doesn't matter . I still can go out and buy a beer . 
 Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework.This is a bad time for this to happen . 
 Thanks . I think I will try . Where are you going ? 
 Maybe we can trade.Why don't you stay here and read for my exam , and I'll go drink beer ? 
 So ? You can go to the class for me.Just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . Why not ? 
 About fourteen . 
 Damn ! 
 Well , Administrative assistant with shorthand and typing skills are badly needed here . 
 The position calls for a person with some working experience . We must be able to benefit from your analytical and interpersonal skills . Can you deliver your resume to us first ? 
 OK . I will call you soon . Bye now . 
 We have reservations for two at your restaurant tonight . 
 I'm calling to see if I can request a specific table . 
 I proposed to my wife in your restaurant and I would like the same table if I can . 
 It was a little table by the bay windows overlooking the wharf . 
 You're going to have coffee , aren't you ? 
 Are you going to have anything to eat ? 
 I'll have that too . 
 How do you spell that ? 
 Right . Got that . 
 But it ’ s so pretty . 
 It ’ s not the same . It ’ s completely different . 
 I really like this one . 
 Yeah . It ’ s pretty . 
 Well , we have the Thompsons , the Greens , and the Anderson , about twelve people total . 
 But that makes thirteen people ! We can't have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! 
 It's an old superstition . If we have thirteen people at the table , then it means bad luck . Can Andy bring a date ? 
 But we can't have thirteen for dinner ! 
 Absolutely not ! I refuse to have thirteen people for dinner on Friday ! 
 That's better . 
 Oh , through a lot of hard work , of course . 
 Surely it was , especially when you only knew few people and little English . 
 Right . I only knew a few English sentences . 
 First , I worked as a servant . 
 I'd like to , but I must run to a meeting . 
 Good idea . How about a cup of coffee ? 
 Can I help you , Madam ? 
 These are all the latest fashion . How do you like this white turtleneck one ? 
 We also have it in grey . 
 It's my pleasure . I think this pair of jeans will suit the sweater well . 
 Daniel , have you finished your homework ? 
 Daniel , as a matter of fact , TV is bad for your health . 
 It's full of violence and you are so young . 
 Wait . What's the time , honey ? 
 It's homework time now . Go and do your homework and then go to bed.American Idol , There you go . 
 Do you still see the people we went to school with ? 
 Yeah , I've lost touch with most people as well , but I still see Rose occasionally . 
 OK , I suppose , but she's had a rough time in the last few years , She got divorced . 
 Oh , of course . 
 Can I take a look at one of those ? 
 Can I take a picture of you ? Seeing is believing . 
 I think I can figure this out . Let's see if this works as advertised . Say ' cheese ! ' 
 I think the quality of the photos will speak for themselves . 
 I have many hobbies . I like almost all kind of sports , and I also like to listen to classical musics . 
 Football . It's a very exciting game , because it keeps you alert , and I also enjoying the team spirit of football . 
 Yes . I enjoying reading biographs , especially those of well-known statesmen , militarists and artists , I can learn a lot from their life histories . 
 I like the novels of Inches very much , I have reading almost all of them in Chinese translation , I wish i can reading them in the original . 
 What are you doing ? 
 It looks like you are about to get dressed . Did you forget we are in a car on the road ? 
 Are you kidding ? You're going to cause an accident just from people gawking ! 
 That will be my pleasure . 
 By credit card . 
 Yes . 
 4434 1234 5678 9902 . 
 No , double nine zero two . 
 That's right . 
 Eleven , ... 
 November this year . 
 Thank you . 
 Thanks a lot . Goodbye . 
 This Olympic park is so big ! 
 Splendid ! When is it gonna be finished ? 
 How many seats are there in the stand ? 
 I didn ’ t know it would be so big ! 
 Ah ... I see . Hey , look the sign here , No climbing . 
 Okay , I ’ ll take it . By the way , do you have delivery service ? 
 Do you charge for delivery ? 
 Very good . Could you deliver it to this address ? 
 OK . Can you tell me the delivery time ? 
 Thanks . 
 With the fifty forwards he sent out today , maybe we'll inadvertently get inspired . 
 Who'd have thought Bean would be this kind of e-mail fanatic ? 
 Hello , back already ? That was quick ! 
 Great . I shall also need a copy of your own ID and the Warrant Letter , you can fill in one here . 
 Next time , you can get one from the counter over there . Or before you come in , you can download one from our website . It's really easy . 
 Good morning , Dr Lee . 
 Not very well . 
 I have nausea , and I am dizzy . Also I have a abdominal pain . 
 Here . 
 Sharp pain . 
 No , It is not continuous . It comes and goes . 
 All right . 
 No . 
 Not really . 
 For about a month . 
 I am eating pretty good . 
 No constipation . Everything seems OK . 
 Can I help you ? 
 I ’ ll be glad to help . 
 All you have to do is ask for help . 
 I ’ m ready and willing to help . 
 What happened ? 
 That's okay . I like it better that way anyway . 
 Of course not . If you're feeling bad and want to let your emotions out , you can just say whatever you want to me . 
 Uh , A ... you know I'm friends with William . 
 Would you mind if I use your tape-recorder ? 
 I'll give it back to you in a couple of days . 
 Are you free this Saturday evening ? 
 Would you like to go to the concert with me ? 
 At our club . 
 At 7:30 p . m . 
 I'm so pleased that you can go . 
 Me too . I like the festival best of all . 
 And special TV programs , fire crackers and the games to play . 
 Such as ? 
 Why ? To welcome the new year of course ? 
 Really ? 
 Oh , that's why my parents never scold me that day . They always try to avoid tears and quarrels . 
 If I were a manager , I would have a private talk with this employ to figure out the reasons . It is very important to have this one-to-one discussion in an unthreatening situation without any distraction . 
 Well , I guess the employee would feel more embarrassed and probably angry . Anyway , it is not wise at all to give a harsh time to your employee in front of others , especially strangers . 
 Honey , why are you so angry ? Can you tell me ? 
 Why do you say such words ? I love you very much . 
 Susan , just one last week I went out to have a lunch with her . There is nothing for you to be jealous about . I like your company much better than Janet ’ s . 
 Honey , you should know that I love you so deeply . 
 But honey , I think you ’ re terrific . There is nothing ... 
 We are going to have a picnic tomorrow at the picnic center . 
 Now let's get things ready . 
 That's much more convenient . We don't even have to bring the flavorings . 
 This is John . 
 I wonder if I can use your bike . 
 No problem . Now , do you prefer working with others or flying solo ? 
 So , what is most important to you in a job ? Do you need job security or professional growth and a chance to advance ? 
 Would you be able to relocate ? 
 What are your annual salary requirements ? 
 I ’ ll keep that in mind . Thank you for coming in today . We ’ ll be in touch . 
 Yes , sir.Just a minute , please , I'll check with the kitchen . 
 We have an appointment in half an hour . 
 Do you have anything else I can have instead ? 
 I'll take beef stew , then . 
 That's right . Let's go into the details . 
 Christmas doesn't come until almost the end of the year , right ? 
 Well . I am afraid it will be difficult for us to advance the time of shipment . Our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . 
 As new orders keep pouring in , the workers are working three shifts to step up production . 
 I am sorry . 
 I said by the middle of Oct . This is the best we can promise . 
 Good . Let's call it a deal . We will do our best to advance the shipment , but your L / C should be opened early Sep . 
 I wish you wouldn't play the TV so loud . 
 Yes , please ask when you want to borrow my records next time . 
 Did you get your bus pass ? 
 Why haven't you got it ? 
 I know where to get them from . 
 They sell them at the business office on campus . 
 I'm sure you didn't . 
 Don't mention it . 
 Good morning , ladies and gentlemen , we are happy you have all come out for our training workshop . Today we have a great line-up of speakers to talk to you . First on our program is a well-renown expert in the field of international economic development , Harvard's own Dr . James Smith . Dr . Smith has been involved in economic research for over twenty years , and has taught at Harvard since 1995 . And now , without further adieu , we'd like to welcome Mr . James Smith . 
 Hello , Jane ! 
 Pretty good . Actually , I'm quite busy with work . By the way , say ' hello ' to your husband . 
 I need to use the Internet . 
 Yes , I do . 
 That ’ s fine . 
 Then what ? 
 How do I log on to the computer ? 
 Thanks . I ’ ll be sitting over there . 
 Excuse me , where is my cabin ? 
 Of course . Here you are . 
 Can you direct the place for me ? 
 I see . Thank you . 
 You know ... I did very poorly on that test . 
 Well , you know how I am about exams . I'm a perfectionist . 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 What about this one ? It sells like hot cakes . 
 Yes , I will get you one . 
 Don't do that to me , honey . Give me a chance , please . I make a solemn promise never to drink alcohol again . 
 Have a heart , honey . You know I am trying hard to quit drinking , don't you ? Just give me one more chance , please ! 
 can't complain . What about you ? 
 I've heard . She looks quite depressed . 
 I heard they were just married for 5 months . 
 yeah . Mixed marriage is tempting but crisis-ridden . 
 maybe they were just attracted to each other but too different to be married . 
 definitely . That's why many cross-cultural marriages end in divorce . 
 that's true.Just hope Wendy can recover from the pain of divorce soon . 
 Yes . Go down the main road . You can't miss it . 
 It's only about a five-minute walk . 
 You're welcome . 
 Do you have to remember every text ? 
 Terrible . How about people's lives ? 
 That's great . It seems that Typhoon is not as bad as earthquake . 
 That's why many people died in the earthquake . 
 Oh , China does have been plagued by numerous destructive earthquakes during its long history . 
 We're all familiar with natural disasters . but we still feel weak when we face Wenchman earthquake . 
 That's the point . Love among human beings is not limited by geography . 
 Let me see , I would like to work my way up to a senior management position with a company such as yours . 
 What would a typical day be like for me here ? 
 Oh , yes , I do . My present job is similar in that respect , and I think I ’ m doing a good job . 
 I just opened my own restaurant . I'm also head chef . 
 Well , I used to hate cooking , but now I love it . 
 After I tried French food . Before that , I used to cook really boring things for my family . 
 Yeah . I went to California to study . 
 I was there between 88 and 90 . 
 Then I came back here . I worked for about three years to get some experience . 
 How do you do , Ms . Yang.You speak very good English . 
 Where did you learn it ? 
 It's amazing . 
 no , what's it about ? 
 she's very generous with her money . I think that's because she was poor when she was young . 
 I'd believe it . She owns magazines , television shows and she has a huge fan base . 
 did they mention that in the article ? 
 that's really commendable . I think more celebrities should use their money to help people like Oprah has . 
 it's amazing how much money they can spend . I heard Britney Spears once spent $ 24,000 a night on a hotel room ! 
 Can I borrow your Cds for our school dance ? 
 I promise I will personally guard every single one and they will come back in perfect condition . 
 That sounds fair . That's still cheaper than paying a band to come play for us . 
 Our class doesn't have enough money . We already checked into it . 
 I just meant that she's got different taste . 
 She's pretty conservative . 
 Yes . 
 About 30 . He's really outgoing . But why do you ask ? 
 Of course , but we aren't going out , we're just friends . 
 Do you want me to put in a good word for you ? 
 I like variety shows . 
 I prefer a variety show without a host . 
 The supreme goal of ours is to be in the leadership in marketing . 
 Yes . We can make great efforts to make it become true as long as we have a clear goal . 
 No problem . What size would you like ? 
 How about this one ? It's our biggest — 16 ” in diameter . 
 Okay , try this one . It's made of aluminum . 
 Here you go . Same pan , but with a state-of-the-art , heat-resistant plastic handle . 
 Great . Will that be cash or charge ? 
 I'm sorry . I forgot to show you the lid . It comes with the pan . 
 What ! 
 It's my new radio earphone . 
 What were you screaming at me for ? 
 I don't have one single favorite , but these days I listen to a lot of Chopin . 
 Without doubt , rock is trash . 
 I usually ride my bike . Which form of transport do you prefer to use ? 
 I think we should discourage people from using their private cars . They produce too much pollution ! 
 cars might be convenient , but they're so bad for the environment . 
 no . I used to have one though . Once I started using my bicycle to get around , I found that I didn't really need it . 
 you could try . It would save you a lot of money . 
 if you got to class by riding a bicycle every day instead of driving , you will get lots of exercise , too ! 
 let's go to a car dealership . I'll help you try to sell your car for a good price . 
 It's the Cygnet Trust . 
 Of course . C , Y , G , N , E , T . 
 Have the owners answered back with a counter-offer for my offer to purchase the house ? 
 That sounds pretty good to me , but I am not sure what to do . 
 If I make another offer and they refuse , then what ? 
 Let ’ s try going with three hundred and thirty thousand dollars for a counter-offer . 
 Do you think that this will move along fairly quickly ? 
 Beijing Hotel . May I help you ? 
 For what time , sir ? 
 From August fifth to eighth . Just a moment . Yes , we have a vacancy for that period . What's your name , please ? 
 That's OK , Mr . Li , a double room with bath from the fifth of August to the eighth . 
 By the way , how do you like to pay for it ? This hotel prefers cash . 
 Not until you have paid 10 percent margin . 
 Thank you . Bye . 
 Just a moment and I'll check . We ’ re expecting a delivery on Friday . We've only got ten in stock at the moment . I can deliver those by first thing tomorrow morning . There'll be an extra charge for special delivery . I'll have to send them by courier . 
 Oh , it ’ s fine . I ’ Ve got a very nice secretary and a large pleasant office . 
 And a company car . 
 Yes , it is . But I ’ Ve got a lot of work too . 
 Excuse me , can you tell me how I can get to the snowboarding area ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Have you heard anything about Markweed Inc . ? They have called me back for interview , and I'm considering taking a job with them . 
 The best ... huh ? With so many companies out there , how did they establish themselves in such a solid position on top ? 
 Really ? What about the pay rate ? Are the wages pretty high ? 
 Well , what about the work environment ? Not every one is motivated solely by money . 
 Hello , Mr . Jones . 
 Long time no see . How is everything at home ? 
 OK , thanks . Anything I can do for you ? 
 Yes , sir . Would you like to remit it by M / T or by T / T ? 
 Very well , Mr . Jones . 
 Yes , but he should bush it off as if it were not a big deal to him . 
 Great . I have long been looking forward to there . 
 I can't help shopping there . 
 Unfortunately , he has left for the day . 
 I ’ ll make sure he gets the message . 
 Bill ! Sure , come on in . What can I do for you ? 
 Yes . 
 A raise ? Son , I would love to give you a raise , but this is just not the right time . 
 Taking into account these factors , and considering I don ’ t want to start a brain drain , I ’ m willing to offer you a ten percent raise and an extra five days of vacation time . How does that sound ? 
 Before you go , just out of curiosity , what companies were after you ? 
 We quarreled yesterday , and he picked up and left . 
 I am not sure . 
 Guess who I saw just now ? 
 John Smith , the escaped criminal . 
 I think I must report to the cops . 
 A : Look at this survey conducted by a website . A quarter of the employees will spend an average of 10 minutes everyday online doing personal things . Hi , Francis , what about you ? 
 Though our company doesn ’ t have a return policy , limiting the personal use of internet , I don ’ t think the boss will like us to do that . 
 But it is lucky for us . The company computers don ’ t have software keeping tracks of websites we visit . I have shopped too often online these days . 
 What kind of sport do you often do ? 
 I used to swim a lot , but now I'm taking gym classes . 
 Hello , I'd like to see Mr . Baker for some business . 
 Would 9:00 o'clock tomorrow morning be alright ? 
 Hey Lisa ... want to grab lunch with me ? 
 Yeah ... actually , we haven't hung out at all recently . You seem sort of under the weather . Is there something going on ? 
 Quit this company ? Oh ... wow . 
 One of the best in the company . 
 Oh , I get it . Simply put , you're bored , huh ? 
 Can you tell me something about financial aid ? 
 How to apply for it ? 
 Then ... 
 What if not ? 
 Jim , I heard you took a trip to San Diego . Is that right ? 
 That sounds really nice . What did you do there ? 
 Did you take any pictures ? 
 Sure , I love looking at photos . 
 Your daughter looks like her mother . 
 Where was this picture taken ? 
 Did you have time to go to the zoo ? 
 It looks like you all had a nice time . 
 Are you a happy married man ? 
 You are a lucky man . How about Mr . Smith . 
 You mean she bosses her husband around ? 
 When can you start the job ? 
 Can you start on Monday ? 
 That's all right . When you come , ask for Smith , OK ? 
 I'm now on the Songshan airport getting ready for departure . I realized that I might have left my watch . 
 My name is Terry . I stayed last night in your hotel in room 132 . 
 It's a brand-new Seiko wrist watch . 
 Oh , I'm glad to hear that . Would you kindly send it to the Hilton Hotel ? 
 Oh , I see . You ’ Ve already decided , have you ? Now , you listen to me , you ’ re only 19 . 
 Oh . So you think you can just do whatever you want , do you ? 
 I am fed up with Jack . He is so weak in dealing with other people and always eats dirt . 
 How do you know that I didn ’ t try ? I just couldn ’ t manage it . 
 Wait ! Look at that board , what's on it ? 
 Then we'd better not go . 
 John , did you have a dream when you was a little boy ? 
 I had the same experience with you . When I was a little boy I dreamed to be a great scientist . But now you see , I'm just a common office clerk . 
 I do . And now I'm working hard to learn English , and I want to be an interpreter some day . 
 Thanks , I will . 
 Sure . Let's see it . 
 What size of prints would you like to have ? 
 Only four hours . 
 Excuse me may I know the name of your corporation ? 
 We found your samples very attractive.We ' re interested in buying your garments if your prices are reasonable 
 Can I have a reduction of seven percent ? 
 Can I use the FAS terms ? 
 Professor , I've handed in my paper . Did you read it ? 
 What about water pollution instead of pollution ? 
 Hi ! Nicole ! 
 Great . We can't keep up with the demand . 
 How about you ? 
 Then let me take you out to dinner to celebrate . 
 No problem . Wait a moment . 
 I enjoyed everything , as long as I was learning . 
 Yes , I did like Spanish and Music . But I don't remember much Spanish . 
 If you hire me , I'll start studying Spanish again . 
 I don't know . Can I purchase Treasury Certificates here at this counter ? 
 Two years is fine , with a value of 1,000 RIB . 
 Here you go . By the way , is it possible to cash them before the maturity comes up ? 
 What kind of job do you think I should get ? 
 You didn't ring me last night . You said you would . 
 That's all right . But why were you so rude to me at lunch . 
 And why are you yarning now ? Are you bored ? 
 I want to make a phone call . Can you show me how ? 
 Yes , now what do I do ? 
 No , nothing changed . 
 I am trying to call my boss . 
 I know a few extensions but I don't know them all . 
 Happy Birthday , Mary ! 
 Here is a gift for you . I hope you like it . 
 I had my own ways of finding out.It ' s a secret . You look so beautiful today . Your new shirt goes well with your skirt . 
 Really ? It looks so nice . 
 All right . 
 No , thanks . I've had enough.Now , Mary , before you blow out the birthday candles , you have to make a wish.After that , you may cut the cake . 
 No , just a small one.Next Let's sing " Happy Birthday " to Mary . 
 My girlfriend dumped me . 
 Jenny , Can you come and help me ? 
 It's dusty everywhere in the house . Can you help me do the housecleaning ? 
 That's my good girl . The clothes need washing . I'll do the laundry . 
 You think ? 
 But I still get stuck on the different tones.It drives me crazy . 
 Room Reservations . May I help you ? 
 In whose name was the reservation made ? 
 What was the date of the reservation ? 
 Excuse me , but is the reservation for yourself or for another party ? 
 May I have your name and phone number , please ? 
 Thank you , sir . I will cancel Mr . White's reservation from November 21st for 4 nights . We look forward to another chance to serve you . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve won the first prize in the math contest . 
 Thank you , Paul . 
 Good , happy birthday to you ! 
 Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me . 
 Hello , Sunshine Travel Agency . 
 Well , let me see . We have a nice one on which we still have several unfilled places . 
 Yes , sir . 
 Five hundred dollars altogether . 
 Yes , I will introduce the itinerary in detail . 
 I am Mormon , so I go to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints . 
 Mormons believe that , after the death of Christ and the death of the Apostles 10 , their church Christ founded became corrupt and the authority of Christ on earth was lost to men . In 1830 , a prophet named Joseph Smith was brought up by God to restore the church . 
 That means that they all have parts of the original gospel , but not all . 
 Yes . 
 We gather together to encourage each other , because we have common beliefs . We come together and call it church . 
 I'm sorry to hear that.Did you check your shoulder bag carefully ? 
 I'm afraid you can't . 
 Oh , I see . I'll call the manager , then . 
 Really ? I remember she said if she would remain single . Is the man very rich ? 
 You means she didn ’ t marry a rich man . 
 I thought she would marry a fortune . 
 What ’ s it for ? 
 Oh , that ’ s a nice idea . Well , it ’ s fine if you take our picture . 
 What is the great trait in your personality ? 
 So you may like inventive jobs . 
 Harry is a hen-pecked husband . 
 Then why does he let himself be lead by the nose ? 
 Why have you stopped production ? 
 OK . Make sure the power is switched off then tighten up all the bolts on the unit and replace the broken blade . Why is there oil all over the floor ? 
 Clean up the mess first , then fit a new seal and check the valve . 
 I have a Time Deposit here and I'd like to get the money now . 
 Yes , I know , but I need the money urgently for a family emergency , you see . I know I should apply in writing if I wish to withdraw , but I'm afraid there just isn't time . 
 Well , it can't be helped . I really must have that money . Thank you . 
 I'm really sorry , Ethan . I tried so hard , but I'm afraid I could't find a Dutch restaurant in town . The best I could do was a German one about 15 minutes from here . 
 I though you said you wanted to have Dutch food ? 
 Huh ? What were you talking about , then ? 
 oath ... that makes so much more sense ! Ha-ha . Well , great , I don't like German food anyway ! 
 There will probably be a book list in the bookstore . Do you have your class schedule handy ? 
 To get started , take that list over to the bookstore . Do you know where the bookstore is ? 
 When you pass the gym , it'll be the first door on the left . Do you know how to sell your old textbooks for money ? 
 If you give your used textbooks to the person at the booth outside the door , he will reimburse you . Can you go over there today ? 
 I am free at 1 
 I'll catch you later then . Have a wonderful morning . 
 Sounds like a good plan . What do you want to see ? 
 Ah , my girlfriend wanted to see that movie . I have to take her later so I don't want to watch it ahead of time . How about The Cube ? 
 How scary can it be ? Come on , it'll be fun . 
 That's the spirit . I'll see you tomorrow after class . 
 I think I should join a fitness centre . I am getting a little fat and I'm totally out of shape . Even a quick walk of a few hundred metres leaves me out of breath . 
 I guess you're right . I've tried stopping , but I just can't seem to quit . 
 I smoke around 30 each day . 
 If I do a few exercises at home , like crunches , I'll soon deal with this waistline . 
 I'll join a fitness centre . I'm sure they'll be able to give me more advice . There's one near my office , so I can go before and after work . I don't want to go jogging in the street , so I'll use a treadmill . 
 Mom ? 
 Can my friend , Tom Mitchum , come home with me for lunch tomorrow ? 
 Mm — hmm . You met him last summer . He is small and very smart . 
 Yes . 
 Haven't you heard that he is in prison ? 
 John is in prison now . He was copped outstealing . 
 You are seemingly upset . What's behind you ? 
 That's not as complicated as you suppose . 
 It is known that there is a time limit for trademarks . And we should not have a similar trademark with the one in the same field . 
 Correct . And our country follows the priority of use principle . 
 Some relative documents will be needed and the fee may be quite dear . So you need to learn more about the process and regulations about this issue . 
 No , I don't mind in the least . I want to do something of my own . What about you ? 
 What are the seasons like in your city ? 
 Does it ever rain in summer ? 
 What are spring and autumn like ? 
 Well , I live in the southern hemisphere , so our summertime is your wintertime , and vice versa . We get some rain in every season , but most is in winter . In winter , it sometimes gets cold , but our wine 
 No , I don ’ t . I go on a winter holiday instead . I go somewhere warm . 
 So , Jack , do you believe in ghosts ? 
 Because I want to tell you about the time that I saw a ghost . 
 It was many years ago , when I was a little child . It was the middle of the night , and I went to get a drink of water from the kitchen . I walked out of my room and was at the top of the stairs , when ... 
 It was a big , green thing that looked like a person . It was in the kitchen , and it slowly moved towards the stairs ... 
 I hid so that it couldn't see me . Slowly it got closer and closer , until ... 
 It moved slowly up the stairs , step by step , and I could hear its approaching footsteps . When it finally got to the top of the stairs , I realized that it was my father in his green pajamas . He had gone to get a late night snack . 
 Good morning . I'd like to reserve some rooms for a tourist party . 
 You see , we are tourists whose requests are different , so please tell me more about it , will you ? 
 That's great . I'd like to book four single rooms , five double rooms and three suites . 
 From tomorrow till January 8th . That's five days in all . 
 Here you are . Is everything OK ? 
 OK . Here you are . 
 Thank you . By the way , is there any preferential rate for the party ? 
 That's wonderful . Thank you . 
 Are you almost finished with my hair ? 
 How much longer is it going to be ? 
 I absolutely love it . 
 Yes , I truly do . 
 How much do I owe you ? 
 Here you go , thanks for everything . 
 I'm in 507 , and I have a big problem . 
 Everywhere I look , I see cockroaches . 
 The next cockroach I see will be number ten . 
 I've already suffered enough without listening anymore to you ! 
 Mrs . Schmidt ! What's happening ! 
 And the doctor told you to start listening to Bach ? 
 Congratulations ! 
 And they said you should play classical music ? 
 You look like in perfect condition . 
 Which sports do you participate in ? 
 Can you tell me something about yoga ? 
 How do you feel when you practice yoga ? 
 But it will help you keep fit . 
 Is this the foreign exchange department ? 
 I need some US Dollars . 
 RIB . By the way , what is the exchange rate today ? 
 And I want to change 4000 Yuan . 
 OK , thank you . 
 May I ask if there's anything wrong with it ? 
 Oh , sorry.But do you want to change it for another one ? 
 My wife and I are thinking about taking our parents with us on a vacation . Do you have any suggestion about where to go ? 
 Sometimes what young people like is different from the old . Maybe we can go visit first and then do some shopping . 
 What should we bring besides a change of clothes , money and some snacks ? 
 Oh , yes ! I didn't think about that.Thank you for reminding me . How many days should we spend on a vacation ? 
 It seems that good planning for a family vacation is important to make sure everyone will be happy . 
 Do you have a light ? 
 Good evening , sir . 
 Certainly . Oh , you have a message here . 
 No , there isn't at the moment . 
 Yep . The steaks and chicken are marinated and I also bought hamburger buns . 
 Yeah , good idea.We can put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill . I also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot . 
 This is gonna be a great barbecue ! 
 I'm ask for a pizza , please . 
 You're right , that is great . 
 Medium one will be perfect , thank you 
 I like seafood on my pizza . 
 Tuna sounds good today . 
 That would be to go . 
 No problem . 
 The crab soup is quite delicious.It ' s always a favorite with our customers . 
 Well , why not try Spaghetti Bolognese ? 
 Why did you choose Applied Sociology as your major ? 
 Have you taken the course in Public Relations when you are in college ? 
 When are we leaving for our field trip ? 
 Yes , I will write that down . 
 Yes , I will be there on time . 
 Yes , someone is coming to get me . 
 What should we bring with us ? 
 Are you feeling better today , Bill ? 
 You'd better give up smoking . It's bad for your health . 
 But you should make up your mind first . 
 Why don't you go to bed and get up early ? You'll have the same time for work . 
 Hi , Kenji . 
 I'm OK . How are you doing ? 
 Do you mean The Bangkok ? 
 Sure , I'd love to . 
 Any time after 6 o'clock is good for me.Oh ! I'm late ! I have a class . 
 Great . Talk to you then . 
 Hello , I called earlier regarding interest rates on loans . Sorry , I just have a couple more questions . 
 What if I require a loan for a short period of time ? 
 Say , 6 months ? Or less in fact . I want to repay the loan ASAP ; I don't like debt hanging over my head . 
 What if I repay it early . Any perks ? 
 So , the quicker I pay it back , the more I can save in interest ? That's excellent . Thanks so much for your information . I'll come in shortly to take the relevant steps for the loan . 
 Hello , Miao Li , Where are you going ? 
 Oh , Would you do me a favor ? 
 Please mail this letter for me on your way to the store . 
 Yes , I think so . There are some pictures in it . It would be a great pity if they were lost . 
 Thanks . 
 Julia , burglaries in our town have been on the wing . 
 I heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . The robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight . 
 I am worrying about it too . I want to install a security door . 
 Yes , I think so . The security door is so firm that nobody can break in . 
 OK , I will do it right now . 
 No , after you . Ladies first . 
 It smells like an ashtray in here ! 
 What ’ s wrong ? I thought we agreed that you were gonna quit smoking . 
 Look , there are other ways to quit . You can try the nicotine patch , or nicotine chewing gum . We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place . It ’ s not like you can just light up like before . 
 Fine ! I want a divorce ! 
 I'm sorry . Mr.Huang is quite busy right now . Could I pass him the message ? 
 Let me see . He's free from 3:00 to 4:30 tomorrow afternoon . Can you make it then ? 
 You're quite welcome . Thank you for calling . Bye-byeB 
 What's the rush ? 
 Is that the box-office ? 
 I'd like to book two tickets for the film ' Jane Eyre ' for this evening , please . 
 What a pity ! How about tomorrow evening ? 
 Wonderful , I'll take them . 
 Wang Min . Telephone number is 13811658 . Can I pick the tickets this afternoon ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 I'll look out for you about 2 tomorrow afternoon . 
 Hi , I ’ m Mary Smith . 
 Nice to meet you Mr . Taylor . 
 O . K . , John . Well , can I have a look at the place ? 
 Oh , it hasn ’ t been painted yet . 
 Well . It ’ s certainly nice . You ’ Ve done a great job . 
 The rent is $ 600 a month ? 
 Well , I think I ’ ll take it . Can I write you a check for the security deposit now ? $ 1200 ? 
 That would be fine . 
 See you . 
 So glad that you think so ! 
 Oh , really ? Thanks a lot ... well , I still have a lot to learn , I guess . 
 Yes we do . Check the meat department . There is a fish counter there too . 
 Let me show you . 
 See , it's right over there . 
 That's all right . 
 Believe what ? 
 You don ’ t believe that ? Everyone interprets the Bible in a different way . To some people , the Gospel 5 is a source of much comfort . 
 To tell you the truth , I don ’ t know if I ’ m a Christian or not . Christians don ’ t often share the same belief . But I believe that we all possess , by the grace of God , the potential to create fantastic changes on this earth . 
 No , all religions are essentially based on the same ideals , so no one is really better . 
 When I ’ m home in the States , I go , but not in China . 
 Cats chase mice , don't they ? 
 Do you have to walk a cat ? 
 But then you have to change the litter box . 
 Could you help me figure out how to look for a job ? 
 I want to work in an office . 
 I want to work full-time . 
 I am confused a bit but I am sure that I can figure it out . 
 No , I don't think I need to do that . 
 Could you drive me to the bank ? 
 Go down this road and then turn left . 
 Lily , I am terribly sorry about this . But we have to put off or cancel tomorrow's meeting . 
 Sorry to say , but nothing can be done . The equipment broke down and can't be fixed till Friday . 
 My stomach's growling again ! 
 Just a little steak , uh ... snack ? A bowl of clam chowder ? 
 You're right . But if I get too thin , my mom will make me go to the hospital again . 
 You know . Soup , well , society makes us like this . 
 Well , thin is always " in " with the media . 
 if you aren't thin , you're nobody . 
 You lost me . 
 Yeah , but that's human nature . 
 Let's change the stomach , I mean , the subject.How about some food ? 
 Yes , I know . 
 Oh , no . We just did it last week . 
 I'd rather wash the clothes . 
 Oh , My God ! So much ! 
 Hi , Mike . I am going to move on the first of next month . 
 Yes , I am trying to find good movers now . Do you know any ? 
 What did you do for your last move ? 
 Oh . that's very nice of him . 
 Yes , please . 
 That's it . I am Maria Smith . You must be Zhang Lin from Tianjin Sports Facility Co.Ltd . 
 Nice to meet you too , Mr . Zhang . 
 Don't feel like it . I'm broke . 
 Just look around ? Ah , that's boring . 
 Mr.Keller , may I call at your home sometime the week ? 
 Well , when will it be convenient for you ? 
 I'm bored and got nothing to do tonight . 
 Hey , that sounds great . 
 Why don ’ t you introduce him ? I wonder if we will become good friends . 
 Hello , Mr.Green . This is Lin Tong . How are you ? 
 Oh , sorry to interrupt you . But I am calling to say goodbye to you . I am awfully sorry to tell you that I am afraid I could not see you off at the airport tomorrow , because I will have to attend a very important meeting . 
 Thanks a lot . You have been here for almost three weeks . How time flies ! 
 It is our pleasure . It has been a great pleasure to work with you . 
 Really ? Great ! We will . Well , what's your flight number ? When are you leaving tomorrow ? 
 OK , I will send someone to see you off . 
 My pleasure . Take care and have a nice trip . 
 Let's call it a deal . Hope to see you again soon . Keep in touch then . Byebye . 
 When can I get high speed internet installed ? 
 Can I make one right now ? 
 I'm off this Friday . 
 I'm going to need it installed earlier than that . 
 Is Saturday any better ? 
 Is 11 
 Do you think chinese families have changed much in the last 50 years ? 
 What do you think is the biggest change ? 
 That's true . You know , some husbands and wives don't even live in the same city any more . 
 I guess I'm a bit old-fashioned . I'd rather have my parents live with me than live in a retirement room . 
 How about your other siblings ? Do they spend a lot of time with your parents ? 
 I see . Do your parents ever ask you to come home to visit them more often ? 
 So I'm on the fifth floor ? How come this hotel has no fourth floor . 
 I see.Oh , I know what I wanted to ask.How much should I tip this guy ? 
 Hi . You enjoying the party ? 
 Yes . The drinks are very good ! I'm Paul , by the way . 
 I'm in finance . You ? 
 T & D ? Oh , yes , sure . How long have you worked there ? 
 No . Actually , I'm based in Shanghai . I'm just here for the conference . So , T & D eh ... 
 Well , under this arrangement two parties cooperate to manufacture a product or a category of products , for example , machine tools for export . Each party produces and supplies a part of the components and parts ; one party is a Chinese enterprise , the other , an overseas firm . Most probably , the foreign counterpart contributes technology and equipment , and sometimes , parts and components , while the Chinese enterprises factory building , labor and other resources to the cooperative production . They join hands and fulfill orders together by an agreement or a contract . 
 Not necessarily . It depends on the contract stipulations . They may be marketed in the foreign country where the other party is located , or even in a third country . 
 Yes , you are right . Either party is not well-equipped to produce the final products single-handedly , but they can enter into an agreement . In such case , each side contributes different resources to make the manufacture of a certain product or a category of products possible . 
 Sounds like a good idea . I love to play on the jungle gym . 
 That's great . Then we won't fight over taking the same ride . 
 They are morning glories . They are cute , aren't they ? 
 I think so . Last time I saw dandelions and ladybugs near the pond . 
 It's really healthy to do some exercise there . The air is fresher and it's romantic to watch the sunset with your lover . 
 Here we are , Joan . This is the Palace museum , also known as the Forbidden city . 
 Sure . 
 I'm here for the backpack you announced several minutes ago . 
 Sure . Here you are . 
 Of course , it's a soft leather one , you know , not a sports one that looks childish . 
 No , it's straps closed , and it has a buckle in the front . 
 Oh , yeah , the brand name . 
 Oh , it's a Polo . It has the logo on the back and at the bottom in the left-hand corner . 
 Well , all the gifts for my family , you know , two pairs of sneakers for my children and a bottle of perfume for my wife . 
 Thank you so much . You guys are really responsible .

 Thank you so much . You guys are really responsible . 
 Yeah ? I guess so . I spent the weekend at beach . 
 Some friends of my parents live out there , and they invited me there . 
 I jogged up and down the beach and played volleyball . You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand . I couldn ’ t get through a whole game before I had to sit down . 
 I wanted to , but the water is too cold , and I just wetted in up to my knees . 
 It looks like you could use it . Don ’ t tell me you spent the weekend in the library again . 
 Hi , yes , I have a reservation . My secretary called and booked a room a couple of weeks ago , the reservation should be for a double bed , none smoking room . 
 It should be under Steve Johnson . 
 No , here is the confirmation number , would that help ? It is 898007 , I had the room booked with a visa cord card . 
 Housekeeping , may I come in ? 
 Good coming , sir . May I do your room now ? 
 Your room will be ready in half an hour . 
 Of course , sir . Have a good day . 
 I don't mind really.Perhaps a job in a shop or a factory . 
 That sounds all right . 
 What kind of car is best for me ? 
 The compact ? Why do you think that one is better than the others ? 
 That's true . What kind of safety features are we talking about ? 
 You mean it has a cheaper price than similar models ? 
 With the cost of gasoline these days , that is a big plus . I think this model may be just what I'm looking for . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Certainly . What about moon cake ? It's typical Chinese food . 
 The moon cake is round and looks like the full moon . That's why it's called the moon cake and the moon cake symbolizes family reunion and harmony . 
 All the moon cakes are generally classified into two styles , Cantonese style and Suzhou style . 
 The skin of Cantonese style cakes is soft and puffy with heavy stuffing while the skin of Suzhou style cakes is puffy filled with fragrant nuts . 
 OK , here you are . 
 Harry Potter . 
 Actually , the language itself is not so funny , but you can imagine the scene , that's funny . 
 Have you ever read this book before ? 
 It's really a good book . You will like it too . 
 Wow , that sounds like a scholar . By the way , who's your favorite writer ? 
 Me too . Pride and Prejudice is my favorite . 
 You won't believe what just happened . 
 I went down to change some money , right ? 
 I wanted to change around 5000 dollars . And you know the exchange rate . 
 Not today . 
 I went into the bank with my money , and I looked at the exchange board.At first I couldn't believe it . I thought I was reading the board wrong or something . 
 Because the board said 60 pesos for every Taiwan dollar . 
 I thought it was wrong too . It didn't make sense . 
 So , I went up to the teller and started to exchange the money . And it's true.They really gave me sixty pesos for the dollar . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 What happened ? 
 When did this happen ? 
 What was taken from you ? 
 Were you able to get a look at this person's face ? 
 Would you be able to pick him out of a line-up ? 
 I have just had my new paper published . 
 I'm going to Britain . 
 I have been accepted by Oxford University on PhD . 
 I really appreciate your kind words . 
 I was wondering if you like team projects , or projects that you work on alone . 
 Are you most interested in a good steady job with benefits or one that will allow you to quickly advance ? 
 How would you feel about relocating to another state ? 
 Do you know how much this job offers per year ? 
 OK , well , that ’ s all I need to know for now . If something comes up , we ’ ll be contacting you . 
 Yes , we do . I'll show you several kinds . 
 Sure , we'll take 20 % off the price . 
 This color is becoming to you , too . 
 The pink one is 30 yuan , and the purple one is 35 yuan . 
 My temperature is 39 degrees centigrade . 
 I didn't take my temperature but I felt feverish . 
 Doctor , I can't eat any foods because I had a sore throat . 
 Hello , how can I be of service ? 
 The first thing we do is check the feel of the paper ;d oes it feel too thick or too thin ? Then we check the watermark . In my opinion it is counterfeit . I'll just run it through the scanner to double check . 
 Well , it's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes . So , unfortunately you'll lose this 50 RIB . We'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated . 
 It was pretty bumpy , also a bit long , all together about 5 hours . 
 Actually I feel quite rested . I was able to sleep on the plane . 
 That will be very nice . You're too kind . 
 Sounds great . Thank you for your hospitality . 
 Here are all the wallets with various designs . How about this one ? It is quite fashionable . 
 Of course . 
 This one is much better , but it is also much more expensive . 
 Two hundred and thirty-five yuan . 
 Daniel , would you like to have a look at my dorm ? 
 It is a small room , just for 4 people . 
 It only has 4 beds and 4 writing desks , but it is spacious and bright . 
 Of course . They are very friendly . 
 We are on the 5th floor , and there's a very nice view from the balcony . 
 Yes , that's a good idea . 
 Let's give them a hand . 
 I hope that world leaders can get together and agree on a plan of action , but I doubt it ’ ll happen before it ’ s too late . 
 Everyone is looking at the issue in the short term , rather than the long term . It ’ s the same with the destruction of the rainforests . Countries and companies just want the wood . They ’ re not thinking a 
 It also means that people sometimes fight over the farmland that remains . Damaging the environment actually leads to conflict between people . 
 I think I ’ d like to do that . I could take the things I learn here back to my country when I have finished my studies . 
 That's all right . 
 You already finished off everything , sir ? 
 Would you like anything in particular ? 
 Beam and Perrier . Anything else , sir ? 
 Sure thing . Might there by anything else ? 
 Perrier , Jim Beam , apples , and grape juice . It will all be there shortly , sir . 
 Hi , Lily ! How is everything ? 
 I ’ m sorry to hear that.Take care of yourself . 
 Do you think I still fashionable in this dress ? 
 This style came out last year , though . I like the dress , but I ’ m not sure whether last year ’ s fashions will be same this year . 
 Yes . Only the top designer try to tell people to change fashion every year , but only rich people can do it . 
 I wish I could be one of those people , but my budget simply doesn ’ t stretch that far . I have to limit the amount of money I spend on clothes otherwise I would go on a shopping frenzy . 
 Are you ready to order , sir ? 
 We have steamed chicken , braised pork and Beijing roast duck and so on . Here's the menu . What would you like to have ? 
 Would you like anything to drink ? 
 All right . Wait for a moment , please . 
 Yes , I made a reservation for 3 days for April 3rd to 6th , and my name is Sara . 
 Well , I want to extend it for 2 more nights . 
 Yes . 
 Thank you . 
 Hi , Peter ! How are you ? 
 Very well , thanks . 
 Howdy folks , and welcome to today ’ s game ! You know , Rick , today is a key game between Russia and Canada . As you know , the winner will move on to the finals . 
 Maurice Richard has the puck now , and passes it to the center . He shoots ! Wow what a save by the goalie ! 
 What an amazing goal ! 
 I heard through the grapevine that your getting married . 
 Congratulations , I hope everything works out . 
 I would be happy to help . What would you like me to help with , food or entertainment ? 
 That will work out fine . To make sure everything goes together , do you think this party should be casual or dressy ? 
 That will work out fine . Do you think that Chinese or Continental food would be best ? 
 Yes , that will work out fine . Should we hire a band or bring in a DJ ? 
 Everything sounds great then ! I'll meet you back here on Friday to discuss the details . 
 Good morning . I'd like to have a haircut . 
 Please cut the sides shorter , but not so much at the back . 
 That's a good idea . But leave the front as it is now . 
 Very good , thanks . 
 No , thanks . 
 You've got to be joking ! It's the teacher's right to say anything wants , and if she saw Myra cheating , she certainly had the right to say so . 
 You're right.If I were the teacher , I wouldn't have done that . 
 Well , for many international students , coming to the United States and living here and studying can be quite a daunting experience , especially when finding a house on campus or off campus . 
 I think first of all for first-time students , coming and living on campus in dormitories can provide a certain level of security . 
 Uh , when you live off campus , there might be a certain amount of flexibility in choosing roommates that you might not have when living on campus . 
 Well , of course , the choice is up to you . Good luck ! 
 When do you want to have the open house party ? 
 Friday sounds good . 
 I like that . Then the adults will be more free to mingle and relax . 
 I'm so excited . Finally , a yard of my own . 
 What's the deal with the Asia area sales ? Did you have a chance to look at any other reports that came in from the branch offices ? 
 What do the preliminary figures tell you ? Any kinds of trends going on for the branches in the Far East ? 
 For example ? 
 I'm after some chinese incense burner ? How's this one ? 
 Oh , I need a small one , otherwise my luggage will be overweight . 
 Oh , this is fine . 
 Overbooked ? Give up my seat ? I don ’ t understand . 
 I know what overbooked is , I just don ’ t understand how that could happen ? 
 So who has to stay behind ? 
 Ok . I ’ ll volunteer . I could use a free ticket ! 
 Yes , I think I am quite proficient in both written and spoken English . 
 I have been studying English since junior high school . And I majored in English in college . 
 Yes , I speak a little French and Japanese . 
 Well , if I were you , I'd go on studying . 
 If I had chance again , I'd major in English . You're good at language . 
 You should take their advice . They know what's best for you.But my friends will have jobs and lots of fun , while I spend all my time doing reading and writing . 
 Hm , what you say makes sense . But you know , I still have to ask my parents for pocket money , and I hate to do so at this age . 
 You're right . Thank you for the advice . 
 yes , I just adopted her from the humane society this weekend . 
 well , i wanted to get a pet that wouldn't disturb the neighbors . at the same time , I wanted a pet that would be affectionate . 
 if you cuddle them a lot when they are very young , they can be just as affectionate as dogs or cats . 
 not really . I went to the veterinarian to get her vaccinated and she told me that all I needed to do was to make sure to trim its nails from time to time , to give her food and water , and to clean its 
 No , rabbits aren't very stinky . As long as your clean the cage on a regular basis , it's not too bad . 
 you can't train them like you can train dogs , but you can train them to do some things . For example , you can train them to go the bathroom in a special rabbit toilet . 
 not yet . She's pretty tame . I think she must be used to being around lots of different people . 
 Why should I go against her ? She always seems to have better ideas . 
 Get the goods on her ? She never allows me to go to her office . And she is a good woman . She has been faithful all these years . 
 A beautiful center ! 
 A goal ! 
 I would like to use a computer . 
 I sure do . 
 That ’ s all right . 
 Okay . Now what ? 
 How am I supposed to log on to the computer ? 
 That ’ s it ? Thank you very much . 
 good morning ! I'd like to make a reservation , please . Do you have any rooms available for the next week ? 
 Double-room , please . It's for an American couple . 
 I'd like a room with a nice view , please . 
 Good . I'll take that one . Is there a bar in your hotel ? 
 Party all night ? Hotel California ? No kidding . Anyway , what's the room charge ? 
 They turn up around 4p . m . next Monday , and they check out on next Sunday . 
 Yes . 6710121 3 . Benjamin . 
 I have a reservation . My name is Rodgers . 
 Yes . 
 0h , good . I have a long day and it's good to get here .

 7 a . m . 
 OK , I'll do that . 
 I'd like to make a reservation to Rome . 
 I'm supposed to be in Rome on the morning of the fourteenth , but I'd rather get there on the evening of the thirteenth . 
 Late in the afternoon , after work . 
 That's too early . I don't get out of work until five . Do you have a later flight ? 
 I'd better take the six thirty . It takes quite a while to get to the airport . 
 Oh , good . What time does the flight get to Rome ? 
 Can I help you ? 
 Well , we have a lot of models here.Did you want to listen to CD's or cassettes or the radio ? 
 Alright . There are several models you may want to look at.This Kreng portable cassette player is very good . 
 It's a German company.This unit has auto-reverse , recording capability , and an AM / FM radio band.It also has a built-in microphone . 
 Really ? Have you had an auto-reverse break before ? 
 Hmm . You know , the problem might be dust . Did you clean the unit often ? 
 Alright . Well . We have many units without auto-reverse.Here is a good unit . Very reliable.It has an AM / FM band , built-in microphone , recording capability , and no auto-reverse . 
 This one sells for $ 39.99 . 
 Of course . 
 Fine . I think you'll be happy with it . It's a very good unit . Very reliable . I'll go get you a new one in a box . I will be back in just a moment . 
 How was your flight from Hong Kong ? 
 10:30 . I'll pick you up at the hotel at 10:00 . : 10:30 . 
 I've got several good reasons . I've been here several years , my work has proven to be good , and I've noticed that people in comparable jobs get paid more than I do . 
 Well , I've noticed all the new cars around here , for one thing . 
 That's understandable . Well , rather than comparing my salary with someone else's , perhaps we could talk about my job performance . Surely you've noticed the extra hours I've put in recently ? 
 That would be very good of you , Mr . White . 
 Yes . I want a window seat definitely , in the smoking section . 
 What's the weight limit ? 
 Thank you . 
 yes . Which one is the brake again ? 
 I ’ m glad this car is an automatic . I don't like having to change gears . 
 you should also put yours on . you never know what will happen with me in the driver ’ s seat ! 
 I can ’ t see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car . Could you move it forward a bit , please ? 
 that ’ s better . Now what ? 
 the tank is almost empty . I guess I ’ ll drive to the petrol station to fill it up . 
 I got it . Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll get you there in one piece . 
 why does that cop car behind me have its red lights on ? 
 Heineken and Budweiser . We have a two-for-one happy hour special . 
 Okay ... A pint of Heineken and and half a pint of bud for table six ! And what about some appetizers ? 
 Okay . That ’ ll be 80 bucks . 
 How do I apply to an American university ? 
 I was told that it took a lot of time and effort to apply . 
 What's to come next ? 
 How long will it take to go over all the procedures ? 
 Thank you . I appreciate your help . 
 Hello , 332440 . 
 I'm afraid he's not in at the moment Dave . He went out about an hour ago and he's not back yet . 
 Well , he shouldn't be long . He said he was just going to get some paint . But I wouldn't be surprised if he's stopped off at the pub on the way back . 
 All right . Goodbye , Dave . 
 Would you please tell me about the Fortune magazine ? 
 Do you like it personally ? 
 Does Mr . Schmidt know he's going to become a father ? 
 Well , he has a surprise waiting for him when he gets back , doesn't he ! 
 I just saw a red van pulling into the driveway . Is that her ? 
 Thank you , Paul . 
 Yes . 
 An ordinary one will do.Would you put me under a hot dryer after that ? I'm in a hurry . 
 OK . 
 Well , they consider some distinct but related problems , such as seeking for a target market or locating the promising customer . An exporter needs to know about the social characteristics of people he is dealing with . 
 Ok . You need to know what they like or dislike , what religions they follow . Especially you need to know how they behave , their habits and their way of life , the things that they are used to . Sometimes , people in different countries , have varying outlooks for cultural , political , religious . 
 Hi Rose , what are you busy with right now ? 
 Well , Rose . 
 Are your free this weekend ? 
 Great , Is it convenient if i visit you this weekend ? 
 I'd like to call on you this weekend . I just want to a drop in for a chat . 
 Is 5 PM . Saturday a good time for you ? 
 Sure , that would be great . I'll bring the wine . 
 I'll be there on time . 
 What ? I was just having a friendly conversation with the lady here ... 
 I think there's been a misunderstanding ! 
 OK ! Just give her this for me ! 
 Yes and no . 
 Really ? I didn't realize it was so late . 
 This is Milton in room 402 . I would like to check out . Can anyone help me with my baggage ? 
 Thanks a lot . By the way , please call a taxi for me . 
 Yeah , look at all those new buildings going up ! Mr . Zhang , the traffic is pretty smooth . But we were told the roads from the airport to downtown were quite crowded and traffic jams could be as long as half an hour . 
 We've never expected that Shanghai is such a big metropolis , same as New York city . David , would it be a good idea to rent a car here ? I've got an international driver's license with a pretty good record in the States . 
 Hey , Mary , what's up ? 
 Oh , that's exciting . What's this guy like ? Is he hot ? 
 It seems you two are a good match . What qualities do you look for in a friend ? 
 Well , that's something I've never heard of . But if you ask me what I value most in a friend , I would have to say honesty . 
 Yeah , I know . A friend in need is a friend indeed . I don't need fair-weather friends either . 
 You're welcome , Bob . It was nice meeting you . 
 Excuse me , Sir , May I have the time , please ? 
 Er ... I'd like to know what time it is now . 
 Thank you . By the way , what day is today ? 
 Yes , I've just come from the States , yesterday in fact . I'm still a bit confused about the time . 
 Oh , that's very nice of you . I don't want to sound pushy , but I still l have one more question . 
 What's the date today ? 
 Yeah , it was nice to meet you . Hope I run into you again sometime . 
 I realize that I ’ m not in a position to offer you the kind of promotion you deserve I'll gladly do what I can to help . 
 And , as well as being a pleasure to work with , you ’ Ve been instrumental in helping us complete many key projects . 
 My feelings are mixed on the issue too . By helping you I ’ m losing a valuable and trusted employee . However I think you are taking a step in the right direction . 
 I'll try to speak more clearly . 
 They say he can sum up like winking . 
 Maybe he's gifted in that . 
 I've got a date . 
 I know there is a beautiful farm in the countryside near Taipei . Are you interested in going there ? 
 You can see many cows and horses there . lf you are brave enough , you can try horseback riding . it is fun . 
 Wow ! It is huge and you can do many activities here . 
 I never knew there were so many fun things to do on a farm . 
 I think we need to buy some baits and borrow some fish poles first . 
 Of course . I will . 
 It is . However , you will suffer from muscle pain for many days you are a first-time rider . 
 Hello , this is Chen Kun . I am booked on flight LJ88 for Barcelona on Jan . 19th . 
 Now I am afraid I can't get to the airport on that day . I want to change my flight for the 21st.Is that all right ? 
 Fine.Thank you so much . 
 Oh , I was out sick most of last week . I ’ m still not completely over it . You ’ d better not get too close ! 
 Sure , why not ? I could use a rest . 
 Would you like to live in the country ? I ’ m not sure I ’ d like it . 
 What do you mean ? 
 I see what you mean . I love being far away from a city , but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities . 
 I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . They ’ re so much better to look at than concrete , rows of parked cars and tall buildings . 
 The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . There ’ s so sign of pollution . The village looks so peaceful . 
 You ’ re right . I would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . I would hate living in the country ! 
 Hello . Could you give me some details about your Personal Pledge Loans , please ? 
 So , as long as I have one of those , I can apply for a Personal Pledge Loan ? 
 Mmmm ... how about the period of repayment ? 
 And the maximum loan amount ? 
 OK . I'll have a look at what I've got exactly in certificates and get back to you . Thanks for your help . Bye . 
 Would you like to make a donation ? 
 It ’ s for the campaigns . 
 It doesn ’ t matter how much . 
 We go door to door asking for donations . 
 Like what ? 
 That ’ s a great idea . 
 Hi , Juliet , I'm treating Mr.Li and his team members from Galp to dinner tomorrow evening.Where do you think I should take them ? 
 That's a good idea . Which one do you recommend ? The Pairszone ? 
 We'll go to the place . Could you book a table for 4 at 7 PM ? 
 Hi , Ben . Here are the top ten of this week's top chart . 
 Which is your favorite in this ten ? 
 You mean Sweet Heart . 
 What do you think about Cold Wind ? 
 So No . 4 is your favorite . Which one don't you like ? 
 Why ? 
 Really ? But it's my favorite . 
 Hi . I need some help with these documents under L / C . 
 Yes . My Manager sent me in , there's a problem with the shipping time . It's been delayed quite significantly and my manager is unwilling to accept it . 
 Thank you . I need to get this done as soon as possible ; my manager is tearing his hair out ! 
 Oh , I love him too . He not only sings well but also shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest . 
 He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him . 
 Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out . 
 Absolutely . That's why when he entered the final , I was so excited . 
 And the host announced that he won it all ! 
 Yeah . Can I look at this ring ? 
 I believe I am a six . 
 Would you have any necklace that would go well with this ? 
 There's no price tag on this necklace . 
 This necklace is a little short . Do you have one that is longer ? 
 This one is much better . Can I try on the ring with this necklace ? 
 Let me think about it . 
 Thank you for all the help . 
 Hello , JC Consulting PLC . Chris Edwards speaking . 
 Hi Kristy ! What's going on ? 
 Yes , I certainly do . 
 Oh , dear ! There isn't a problem , is there ? 
 Kristy , that's wonderful ! Thanks so much for contacting me personally . 
 Could you drop me off at the airport ? 
 Do I need to pay any extra change for my suitcases ? 
 All right . 
 It ’ s a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions . 
 Roger Vargas is up at bat . The pitcher winds up and strike one ! 
 The players are scrambling to get the ball . Vargas gets to first base and he ’ s still going ! The outfielder throws it to second ! Vargas slides ! He ’ s safe ! 
 We have a runner on third and up at bat is Brian Okapi ! There ’ s the pitch , he hits it ! It ’ s going , going , that ball is gone ! 
 Good morning . 
 I'm not quite hungry now . Let me think for a while . 
 Ok , Ok . Toast and egg . 
 No . 
 Hi , Mary , Hi , Ken I hate to bring this up , but that new stereo , system you got ... 
 You were playing it very late last night . 
 It kept me awake . 
 It kept me awake a couple of hours . 
 It was that loud , and it was pretty late , and check with Mary if you don't believe me . 
 I'm very sorry . I didn't realize it . I promise I'll keep it down in the future . 
 I am glad we've straightened everything out . 
 Yeah , I'd better head for home . 
 I spent the morning at the cemetery . I put flowers on the graves of my old war buddies . 
 They should . This holiday is about remembering our war dead . But people these days think it's just a holiday for summer sales and cookouts ! 
 Hi , Michael , how's it going ? 
 I heard you got a new roommate . What's he like ? 
 Oh ? What's wrong with his girlfriend ? 
 Well , I guess it might take some time to get used to . 
 Oh come on , it's not that bad . 
 Rough . Maybe you can do the most of the talking . 
 Good luck . 
 It's all yours . 
 Well , I hope it's comfortable enough for you . 
 You have a phone on the bedside table that you can use . 
 Kind of . It leads to my bedroom . 
 This is a very spacious apartment . It's forty pings , including the parking space . That's about one thousand four hundred square feet . 
 You never know when two might turn into three . 
 Exactly , which is why a three-bedroom is better . And look , there are two bathrooms . 
 Could you send up a Coke and a salad ? 
 Make them with French dressing . 
 This is the first time for me to have a Chinese guest . I hope you like western cooking . 
 Cooking is a hobby with me . I'm always trying to think up new recipes . I hope you like the soup . It's kind of a specialty of mine , so I hope you enjoy it . 
 Thank you for your compliment . Won't you try this fish with white sauce ? I'm rather round of it . 
 What sort of western food do you like best ? 
 I find the Chinese dishes wonderful . 
 It's still early . 
 Hello , Shelly , is it ? I'm here on behalf of my company , so I'll need the Corporate Banking Services . 
 I need to have a credit check done for my company . 
 That's no problem . Do you offer any other consulting services ? 
 Great . I'll wait right here , thanks . 
 About 3 years , so I came here 2000 . 
 Providence , Rhode Island . do you know it ? 
 Well , not so far from New York . So what about you ? Did you grow up here ? 
 Tu Mao , I'm hungry , let's get something to eat . 
 There's a Kentucky's not far ahead and there's a McDonald's in down street . 
 Don't you know about Kentucky's ? 
 They sell pieces of fried chicken , you've got to try one this time . 
 Oh , well . It was fun to be the winner . But ... it's too big . I must be an extra small in the States . 
 Look ! It's amazing . I can't wait to try it out ! 
 Oh ... around twenty bucks . A bargain if you ask me . Look at the picture of her playing with it ! 
 And here's her signature ! 
 You're right . I think it ’ s time to seek professional help . 
 I know you don ’ t want to pay for a job , but I think it ’ s time we consulted a headhunter . 
 Ha , ha , ha ! I agree . That ’ s not much fun . 
 Actually I do . 
 Cooke & Co . does a lot of placements in your field . 
 Not at the moment , but I ’ ll let you know . 
 Do you think that is a good idea ? 
 What are your main concerns ? 
 I know what you mean , I've thought about that myself . 
 Could you take a slight pay decrease for a chance to move forward ? 
 I think I'm convinced that trying for this position is the best choice for you . 
 Yeah . He's the most experienced athlete in the field . 
 Good boy ! 
 Yes , hello again . I would like to know the exact difference between Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit . 
 And I can purchase that here ? 
 What are you guys doing over there ? 
 I ’ Ve been waiting for a response on the Blake Building design for nearly two weeks . 
 Mom ! How can I help with the washing up ? 
 OK ! Then what can I do after I finish it ? 
 OK , got it . 
 Reading newspaper on the couch . 
 Staying with Ultraman , of course . You know he likes it very much . 
 I will . 
 OK ! 
 Sure , no problem . What are you trying to get ? 
 OK . This machine needs you to use that change machine first to get correct change . 
 First you put your money in the dollar slot or the coin slot . The dollars have to be smooth . 
 Just know that sometimes the money doesn't go in perfectly the first time and you have to try again . 
 Choose what you want and push the button . Sometimes it takes a couple of tries . 
 Hope that works for you ! 
 Yes , we ’ Ve got a reservation . The name is Ann . 
 This is your table . 
 Yes . 
 Thank you . 
 Hello , there . I'd like to know about Clean Collection . My company in the US is going to send me a cheque . It's for my wages , but I'm not too sure about how to cash it here . 
 Is there any way we can speed it up ? 
 Hi Bob , this is my friend Mary . 
 Bob is in advertising . 
 Hello , is this Professor Clark ? 
 Hello , Professor , this is Kalina , and I am in your literature class on Monday mornings . 
 I was partying hard over the weekend , fell down the stairs , and need time to recuperate . 
 I sprained my wrist , but the doctor says it will be fine . 
 The doctor said I should be good enough to return next week . 
 The dinner is really rich . 
 I like the soy sauce chicken . 
 Want to meet for lunch this Saturday ? 
 What are you doing ? 
 What kind of volunteer work ? 
 Oh , yeah ? 
 Stand back from the door , please . Let the passengers off . You can't get on until the other passengers get off . 
 One dollar . Drop it in the box . Move to the rear of the bus . There are plenty of seats in the rear . 
 That's right.Move along , please.There are more people waiting to get on.Move to the rear . 
 No , that's the number l that goes down Park Avenue.This is the number 2 . 
 It is.Get in.please.You ' re holding everyone up.You can't miss Washington Square Park . 
 It would be better if you watched out for yourself . I might forget . 
 just after 2 am . 
 nope , actually I was waiting for you . I have something big to tell you . 
 I have an offer to work for a company in your city today ? 
 I haven't accepted the position yet and with the upcoming holiday I think it's the perfect chance to visit the city and take a good look at the company before deciding . If you have time I think we c

 How nice of you to come ! 
 Just fine , thanks.And you ? 
 Here is your bill . It's $ 60 . 
 It's for the drinks . 
 Sure . 
 I know , I should wash them right away . 
 I buy a computer magazine every month . It keeps me up-to date with all the latest developments . 
 Sometimes it takes too long to find the exact information you are looking for . Besides , I like to read a magazine in a coffee bar sometimes . 
 Yes , they do . But you can only access all the articles if you have a subscription . 
 Yes , I do . The magazine arrives by post at the beginning of each month . Do you every buy magazines ? 
 How do you usually spend your leisure time ? I mean , do you have any special interests out of your job ? 
 Yeah , you ’ re quite right and what ’ s your hobby ? 
 Oh , photography , It ’ s really a good hobby . 
 You yourself have a photo studio ? 
 Mary , my friend recommend me for a job to work in a company , and I feel it's great . 
 He has introduced the company details to me . 
 The company deals in selling electronics . 
 It was founded in 2002 , has been in business for 10 years . 
 More than 2000 now . 
 The company deals in selling electronics .

 More than half of the employees have bachelors ' degree . 
 Three times every year . 
 Daniel , you can't spit the gum everywhere . 
 Do you know how many people chew gum everyday ? 
 Just in Beijing , people consume 300,000 pieces of gum every day . 
 If all the people spit out the gum like you , the whole world would become a big trash can . 
 I just want to remind you to behave yourself . 
 excuse me ? How can I get to the nearest branch of the national bank ? 
 how far up the street are the traffic lights ? 
 ok . So I turn right at the traffic lights . Then ? 
 ok . Where do I go then ? 
 got it . Thank you very much . 
 Of course ! How much would you like to spend on your meal ? 
 Well , how about our own hotel restaurant ? It's conveniently located and has a three-star rating . 
 Well , how about Gramercy Tavern ? It's a very popular tourist spot , with great food and music . 
 Of course , sir . You've made a good choice . 
 I'm not sure . What does it look like ? 
 There's a large wooden crate in the corner which I haven't unpacked yet . It might be in there . 
 Yeah , really . 
 Of course . Suit yourself . 
 Hi , I'm Susan Jackson . 
 I'm a student at UCLA . 
 Medicine . 
 Yes , I want to be a doctor one of these days . What about you ? 
 Sure . Thanks . 
 Wow ! So many people in the United States get divorced ! 
 I don't think so . In Korea some marriages break up , but most couples stay together . 
 Not really . Very few people get married beforethe age of 20 . 
 No , a lot of women stay home and take care of their families . But some work . 
 Oh , come on . You know it's a long process , you have to be patient . 
 A , whatever you do , the most important is perseverance . So you have to hang on there , the longer , the better . Then some day , you will find you've already made a lot of progress . 
 Yeah ! Where there is a will , there is a way . 
 Thanks . I'd love to . What time is the show ? 
 That sounds great . So , do you want to have dinner at 6:00 ? 
 Oh , that's OK . Let's just meet at the theater before the show , around 7:30 . 
 Shall we start decorating the bedroom ? 
 When ? 
 Good morning . May I help you , sir ? 
 Do you want an international money order or a banker's draft ? 
 Excuse me , may I have the bill , please ? 
 Can I pay by private check ? 
 Susan , good evening.Why are you so dressed up ? 
 You look great.Your make-up is perfect . 
 No , the one you have on looks fabulous , especially with your hair like that . 
 With that dress I'd like to say your white diamond necklace would look perfect . 
 Not much , Just a house party with some friends . 
 Yeah , most of the people are from my office . 
 I'm sure you will have fun no matter where you go.Remember to take your bag . 
 The order was in good shape when it left out factory . 
 We'll make it right with you , of course . 
 What kind of price did you want ? 
 That will probably be Ok . 
 Yes , I'd like to see that pen . 
 Can I get it duty-free ? 
 It's not the latest model , is it ? 
 You look bright-eyed and bushy-tailed . 
 Congratulations ! Let's get together sometime . 
 Well , I am worried to death right now ! There is still no news from the company for me . 
 Maybe they will send me e-mail to inform the result . Let me check my mail-box again . 
 Well , I've been browsing online , but I ’ m not really sure what to do about payment . I would like to know what the most convenient way to do it is . 
 That does sound interesting . How can I get this service ? 
 Have you made a reservation , sir ? 
 Your name , please ? 
 I see.We had a table reserved for you.This way , please . 
 No way ! 
 Do you have this shirt in a small ? 
 May I try it on ? 
 Can I help you ? 
 Are you a professor ? 
 Yes , I am kidding.But don't you know only professors and students with disabilitiescan apply for parking permits ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry . I didn't know . 
 Here is the application form . I also need to see your student ID and your permission letter from the university . 
 Yes , the letter that certifies you have a disability.And it must certify your disability entitles you to a parking place . 
 Yes . Or you can bring it yourself . 
 Let me look in the file then . Maybe we received it . 
 Yes , here it is.Alright . Then I just need your completed application form , and I will be able to process your request . 
 The form has a map on the back . You may specify your top four choices.We will give a spot in the lot that has an opening . 
 You're very welcome . 
 Come on . I stand behind you . 
 Barbara ! 
 Yes , that's right.But I'm having a holiday here . 
 I think you'd better apologize . 
 Maybe not , but I advice you to say it was your fault . 
 I knew there would be a shower , but I didn't realize it would rain cats and dogs today . 
 I know . I don't want to get sick , especially during finals week . 
 Why don ’ t you find a new career where you can do what you enjoy , being outside working during the day ? 
 Maybe you have two choices . You could attend school during the day , or you could get a position that provides training . 
 Don't worry about it . It's just a drop in the bucket . That car has more scratches on it than I can count . 
 Nothing . 
 I ’ m rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off . 
 I hope so . 
 I couldn ’ t find the book I was looking for . 
 I checked . 
 It should have been , but it wasn ’ t . 
 Will you be getting another copy anytime soon ? 
 Would you be able to reserve it for me ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Hmm , they look interesting . Can I have a copy of your brochure ? 
 OK . Go ahead . 
 How amazing ! I have never seen it before . Is it expensive ? 
 OK , I will take one . 
 Neither , I prefer an active job . 
 That's better . I like travelling . 
 Not too bad , I suppose . 
 Oh , she asked me all sorts of questions . She asked if I smoked , and whether I played sports , she asked me where I went to school , and what subjects I took , and she asked me if I like to meeting people . 
 Well , she asked me if my parents wanted me to be a steward . 
 No , but she told me to telephone her next week . 
 Thank you Dick . Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King . Tell me Dave , what is your impression of this film ? 
 I think otherwise . Even though the animation was technically strong , and as you say , the score and songs performed by Elton John were great , the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart . And I would dare to say , it was too predictable . 
 Well , that ’ s just it . It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes For example when Mufasal dies , or the dark , grim portrayal of Scar . Even so , the film is linear . Mufasal dies , Simba runs away thinking it ’ s his fault . Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his . It ’ s just too cliche . 
 You have always been so soft , Dave ! 
 Anyway ... That ’ s all for today folks ! Join us next time as we talk about & quot , How to lose a guy in 10 days & quot , I ’ m sure you ’ ll love that one Dave ! 
 Yes , he once gave her seven roses . 
 No way to know . 
 Hey , the same to you ! 
 Definitely , it's time to say bye-bye to the last year and to say hello to the new year ! 
 Some resolutions ? That's a wonderful idea , but I have no idea yet . How about you ? 
 That will be a good one ! Anything else ? 
 Sounds great ! 
 I ’ m fantastic ! 
 I want to make a deposit today . 
 It will be cash today . 
 I need to deposit $ 300 . 
 Deposit it into my checking account . 
 That ’ s all I need today . Thanks . 
 Not really . I like looking on the internet at what ’ s available , but I usually prefer to actually see and touch what I ’ m buying before I pay for it . Sometimes , I ’ ll look at something in a shop , but lat 
 Not really . I know that it happens , but if you buy from reputable companies with secure websites , you should be ok . Even though I use online shopping facilities , I don ’ t think it ’ s the best way to sho 
 I do . I ’ m a big fan of using new technology , but I don ’ t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . I think people need to get out and interact with other people . 
 Sure . I ’ d love to join you . Can we stop by the computer store ? I just want to see if they have something . 
 Ok . I ’ Ve finished online . Let ’ s go . I ’ ll just get some money and my credit card . 
 I only want a little off the top and the sides and back to have clean lines . 
 It's natural . My friend told me you know how to work with curls . 
 Do you have any product that controls frizz ? 
 Thank you ! 
 How much for a bus pass ? 
 Is there anything else that doesn't cost as much ? 
 How much does a student pass cost ? 
 It doesn't cost anything ? 
 Can you tell me how much that'll cost ? 
 Sounds good , let me get that . 
 Watch out , Jenny ! Be careful of the cars . 
 Did you get hit ? 
 Watch out for strangers , and don't go too far away . Alright ? 
 What ’ s going on ? 
 What aren ’ t you too sure about ? 
 Your lease is for three years . 
 If you do , I will keep your deductible . 
 If you break the contract , then you will not receive your deductible . 
 All right . I ’ m glad I could clarify things for you . 
 Yes , very . I thought the last speaker was especially good . 
 How do you do ? I'm Mary Green . 
 Green , G-R-E-E-N , but just call me Mary . 
 Glad to meet you . 
 It ’ s a pleasure to show our factory to our customers . What ’ s your general impression , may I ask ? 
 That ’ s our latest development . A product with high performance . We put it on the market just two months ago . 
 Certainly . No one can match us as far as speed is concerned . 
 Right . Here is our sales catalog and literature . 
 Excuse me . Do you happen to have a gym here ? 
 So , where do I go to exercise ? 
 Am I going to be charged extra for using the gym ? 
 Great ! Now tell me , what are the hours of this gym ? 
 Okay . Do you have a trainer to help me work out ? 
 I'm going to try sky diving this weekend . 
 It's sounds like fun . 
 I want to try something exciting . 
 I'll tell you all about it next Monday . 
 Aunt Cindy , do you shop online often ? 
 Last week , I tried to buy some books online , but I didn't know how to pay for them ? 
 Are there many things online ? 
 Oh , what's this ? Second-hand cellphone store ? 
 Really ? How to do that ? 
 That's amazing . I'd love to try it later . Oh , an on-line virtual supermarket ? 
 Oh , I got it . It simulates the real supermarket , which makes it feel so real . Mom will love it . She loves shopping in supermarkets . 
 Are there any disadvantages about it ? 
 I ’ m sorry , but I can ’ t find the book that you lend me . 
 I must apologize . I ’ ll buy you a new one tomorrow . 
 Do you know our major business ? 
 Do you have a long-term plan for your career ? 
 He ’ s got laid off again . I do feel sorry for him . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Brandy , I am supposed to participate in an interview tomorrow . 
 How ? 
 Is a white shirt OK ? 
 Good morning Mike ! 
 I am having an exam at 9 o'clock , It's already 8 thirty . 
 Thank you very much ! 
 Very well , thanks , I will probably finish next week , but this is still a lot of work , I have been worked on in for six months , and i ' m so closed to end . I can fill in . 
 Yes , It's only 8 forty . Thanks so much ! 
 Have a nice day , bye ! 
 The notice you received is a 30 - day notice to vacate . 
 I mentioned to you before that you need to keep up with your rent . This notice to evict is letting you know that I mean business . 
 You have 30 days to catch up on your rent , or a sheriff will evict you . 
 You can stay , but you might think about looking for a less expensive living arrangement if you are having trouble making the payments . 
 Thank you . The payment needs to be in the form of cash or a cashier ’ s check . 
 Yes . to our first anniversary and many more to come . Cheers ! 
 Well , it's a special day . They say if you survive the first year , the rest is smooth sailing . 
 I requested it . What do you say ? Do you have your dancing shoes on ? 
 Hello , may I help you ? 
 Of course . We would be happy to cash it for you . 
 Well , any bank will cash it at our present traveler's check buying rate , for which we ’ re somewhere cheaper than hotels because of the service charge . You see , hotels really aren ’ t in the money exchange business although they will cash traveler ’ s check for their guest . 
 No , madam . Not very much . 
 Yes , I'll be happy to cash these for you . Would you please countersign them here ? 
 Where are you going to play this weekend ? 
 I want to spend two days in the mountains with friends . The city is too noisy . Do you know Tangle Temple ? 
 Do you want to climb the mountain with us ? 
 No problem . The temple is quite large . 
 I'm getting a little excited now . What clothes should I wear ? 
 Anything else I should bring ? 
 Needless to say . 
 It's Friday . 
 No problem , sir . There's a copy machine in our computer lab . 
 Each copy will cost you a dime , sir . 
 There aren't many things you can get for a nickel , sir . 
 You're welcome . Did you have a good time on this vacation ? 
 Me too . Please write to me as soon as you get Boston . 
 OK , they begin to register . 
 Have a nice journey ! Do give my regards to your parents . 
 That's nice . 
 Of course not . We have cooperated for a long time . 
 Yes , this is the right bus . 
 Don't worry . I'll call out the stops . 
 No , don't worry . I'll get you off when you get there . 
 No , not that long . Two more stops , and you'll get off , sir . 
 Not at all . 
 Here you are . 
 I want to check these three pieces and I'll carry this overnight bag by myself . 
 Well , then , how much do I owe you ? 
 I've got to get dad a Father's Day gift . 
 This year I'm going to get him a gag gift . 
 Well , we have a tradition in my family ... 
 No , ties . And there's a tie store . Let's go ! 
 Am I ready for what ? 
 Oh . Yes , I ’ m ready to transfer . 
 I ’ m very nervous . 
 I ’ m not going to know anybody there . 
 That makes me nervous . 
 I didn ’ t think about it that way . 
 Well , little girls seem to love Barbie dolls . 
 Here you are — she's called Digital Barbie . 
 This Barbie is only $ 29.95 . 
 Very good . Is there anything else you would like ? 
 Including tax , your total will be $ 32.42 . Cash or charge ? 
 Here's your change and receipt . Thank you . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 Well , how about the Museum of Modern Art ? 
 Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building ? 
 Do you have any siblings ? 
 How do you get along with them ? 
 Is the right counter to check in for this flight ? 
 OK . Is the plane on schedule ? 
 Two . 
 Hi , Nice to meet you . 
 Mrs . Smith , what do you do for work ? 
 Oh . Where do you work ? 
 I'm a teacher . 
 I teach English . 
 At a high school in New Jersey . 
 I'm 32 . 
 I had to go get a cavity filled today . 
 I don't even wanna talk about it . It killed me ! 
 It took quite a while , but the worst part was getting numbed . They had to give me 3 shoots . 
 No kidding . Not only can ’ t I stand the pain , but man ... dentists are expensive . The bill is going to be humungous ! 
 I do , but it still does not cover everything . 
 What ? 
 Did you open it before we left ? 
 I don't know . Wait . Is this yours ? 
 It looks that way . That's probably why the door wasn't locked when we came in . 
 Yes , but the robber broke in.Then , when he left , he left through the door . So it wasn't locked . 
 Look around . 
 And your stereo too . So what did he steal ? We have to go look upstairs . 
 I don't think there will be . He left through the door , remember ? 
 Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll open the window . 
 Smoking is harmful for your health . 
 Beautiful weather , isn ’ t it ? 
 No , I ’ m on a vacation to see the famous Three Gorges . 
 Yes , it is . 
 I couldn ’ t agree more . 
 Can you recognize Mike's father in the crowd ? 
 Let's run up and give him a hand . 
 Hi , Andy . I'm Judy . It's nice meeting you . 
 Come over and visit when you have time . 
 Hi , how are you . Is Alice there ? 
 Why haven't you answered the phone ? 
 That's all right . 
 I want to do something tomorrow with you . 
 I was thinking about seeing a movie . 
 Until then . 
 You got our email with all the specifications for the project . We'll be accepting bids untill noon on Tuesday . If you have any questions between now and then , please let me know . 
 I understand . But unfortunately , it is our policy not to disclose our bottom line . You can be assured that price is a weighty consideration when we review the proposals . We also consider other elements , including design and practicality . We also give weight to the reputation of the submitting company . 
 We're just looking for a reasonable price according to the specifications in our project blueprint . That's all I can say . 
 I agree . 
 I can't believe they would play so good . 
 Do you have the receipt with you ? 
 Thank you . Do you want your money back ? 
 I am afraid this is the biggest size we have . 
 Maybe you would like to try this one with the willow pattern . The price is the same and it's bigger . 
 Yes , sir . 
 Let me see ... it's $ 50 . 
 Sorry , sir . We receive credit card and cash only . 
 It's late.It ' s high time I left.Thank you for a most wonderful evening . 
 Good night then ! 
 good morning . How can I help you ? 
 have you filled out an application form ? 
 yes . I'll just have my assistant look over these quickly and then we'll move on to the next step . Did you want to open up a checking account and a savings account ? 
 yes . Actually , both accounts come with cards that you can use in ATM machines , so that you won't have to come in to the bank to make a transaction . 
 it is . Our customers really like it . Do you have any other questions about your new accounts ? 
 the maximum is $ 1000 . 
 yes , but it's not much . You just have to pay 1 % interest on the amount . It's much lower rate than any of our loans and it's much better than owing money to most credit cards . 
 they're all in order . If you just sign your name here , you'll receive your cards and pin numbers in the mail in about three weeks . 
 you're welcome . 
 May and Danny have already grown up . 
 Look at that big tree over there . 
 Do you know that I fell in love with you at the first sight . 
 But you agreed to go out with me at last . 
 I wish the politicians would quit digging up dirt about each other's past . 
 And it takes up all the news . 
 It's so small . The fact that there is public interest , doesn't say much for us as the public . 
 I don't remember the last time I listened to AM radio . 
 Are you enjoying your trip to New Orleans ? 
 Would you like to do something tonight ? 
 Let's see . Have you been to a jazz club yet ? 
 OK . What about an evening riverboat tour ? 
 So , what do you want to do ? 
 Oh , OK . I hear there's a terrific show at the Sanger Theater . 
 I ’ m thinking about getting a pet , but I ’ m really not sure which animal would be suitable . Could you give me some advice ? 
 I ’ m fairly busy , so I really need an animal that I don ’ t need to care of very much . Actually , I ’ d like a pet that ’ s a little unusual . I don't ’ really want a typical pet , like a cat , dog , or hamster . Do you have any suggestions ? 
 Not really . By the way , I don ’ t want a pet that could be dangerous , like a tarantula or rattlesnake . 
 That sounds ideal . Could you show me some ? 
 I like the red one . What do they eat ? 
 Thanks a lot . What I ’ ll do si find out more online and drop by next week . 
 It's your turn , sir . I'm sorry that you've had to wait . 
 OK , It's here , one of the best makes in China . 
 You seemed to be fed up with Mary . 
 She is a barking dog . But she means well . 
 You are unfair to her . She is a very nice girl . 
 Can I get my hair done like his ? His girlfriend has the same hair , and she's white . 
 What kind of style are you getting done ? Can we match ? 
 Can I get a relaxer , too ? And why did you say , “ You crazy ” instead of “ You ou're crazy ” ? 
 That would be fine . Where are you going ? 
 Great . 
 Ok . I like fishing very much . 
 Hi , Paul . I haven't seen you for a long time . 
 Fine , thank you , and you ? 
 I came to see my uncle . He lives in the next block . 
 Not yet . 
 yes . I bought a scarf yesterday . It's really nice and warm . Have a look . 
 yes , I adore simple fashions . How does it look on me ? 
 how about this blue sweater ? 
 yes , but I bought it when it was on sale , 50 % off the original price . OK , what do you think ? 
 I've got a pair of pearl earrings . Here it is . 
 you have good fashion sense , Karen . 
 yes , but with our sense we'll always look good . 
 We have no pool , sir , but we do have swim stations in our gym . 
 You know how you run on a treadmill but don't go anywhere ? Well , it's the same thing . 
 The stations are absolutely free to guests , sir . 
 The swim stations are open daily from 7 a . m . to 10 p . m . 
 Be warned , sir . At certain hours the swim stations are very crowded . 
 Why ? Are you planning to stir-fry my face ? 
 You've gone bonkers , Jen . 
 OK . Let's see . Give me a sheet . 
 Well , let me have a look . Will you sit down in this chair and open your mouth wide ? 
 Yes . This big one is badly decayed . I'm afraid it must be taken out . 
 No need to worry . You won't feel anything at all . I'll give you an injection to stop the pain . Just wash your mouth out with this water , will you ? 
 No , it'll be over soon . Nurse , get some X-rays of our patient's molars . Then we'll start . Open your mouth wide . Don't be so nervous . Now open wider ... now stay , that's over ... 
 Not yet , but it soon will be . Now open again please ... It's out ! Look ! 
 Hi , I ’ m the superintendent of this building . What can I do for you ? 
 Sure . Let ’ s go . 
 $ 850 a month . 
 No . Utilities are extra . 
 It ’ s on the other side of this floor . 
 We allow one or two pets but you have to pay a $ 300 deposit . 
 If your pet ruins the apartment walls or carpet we ’ ll keep your pet deposit . If not , we ’ ll return your deposit when you move out . But be careful , we don ’ t allow pet snakes in the apartment . 
 We do . We will spray the apartments before you move in . 
 Do you really like this straw hat , dear ? 
 But it costs an arm and leg . 
 I want to give our kitchen the works . 
 No . The decoration has been out-of-date . My friends have a whole kitchen now . It ’ s modern . 
 I am not running after the fashion . I just want a very beautiful and clean kitchen . 
 Yes , I can . 
 Then how about the expenses during the trips ? 
 Would you tell me where we often travel ? 
 It's great ! I like these places . 
 Yes , I can . 
 I see . 
 OK . Thank you very much for telling me all these things . 
 Yes , and would you like to have seats in the front or at the back ? 
 That's 35 yuan each . 
 Tarzan . 
 I am afraid not . Tomorrow is premiere . 
 OK . What do you think of it ? 
 I think so . But can I try another one ? I don't like the color . 
 No . I think I've known enough . Thank you . 
 Alright , see you . 
 Yeah , I've been looking forward to it for ages . 
 They give me a lot of congratulations . 
 Oh , maybe three years . I will study and get the master degree first . Then I will decide whether I will stay there or come back . 
 Chicago University . My major is Economics . 
 Thank you ! 
 It looks delicious . Can you tell me how to enjoy it ? It's my first time to eat it . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Of course . How about you ? 
 How ’ s that ? 
 Why ? 
 Why not ? 
 Why don ’ t you go to work late ? 
 I see . 
 Yes . Dolphins have a big brain and they are very smart . They are also the fastest swimmers in the world . 
 They are . I read a story about a dolphin saving a A from drowning in the sea . 
 They sure can . Maybe they can interact with men better than monkeys and apes . 
 Take the A train south to the Liberty Ave . stop . You should be able to find it from there . 
 The southbound A trains say Brooklyn . 
 Yeah . Hey ? What are you doing ? Let the people off the train before you get on . 
 Jeez . Tourists . 
 Are you sure ? He is quite young , isn't he ? 
 Really ? He looks so young . 
 Have you got any Chinese paintings ? 
 I'd like a flower-and-bird painting . 
 Oh , they look just like live cranes . I like this picture very much . How much is it ? 
 It's a lot of money . But the picture is excellent , I'll take it . 
 Gosh , you took all the word right out of my mouth . Let's go out and get crazy tonight . 
 Sure , but what do I wear ? 
 Did you need help with something ? 
 Do you have a problem with your account ? 
 What are you going to do about the money in your account ? 
 I ’ ll do that for you . 
 Would you like to withdraw any money ? 
 It ’ ll just take me a moment to cancel your account . 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 Will you please pose for your picture ? 
 I am really thirsty . 
 Let's do that . 
 A soda sounds good . 
 Why is that ? 
 What should I drink then ? 
 That sounds good . 
 Hi , What's for lunch ? 
 I was thinking of pizza . 
 Well , what do you want to eat ? 
 I ate a burger just the other day . 
 You could always get a burger , and I can get a pizza . 
 Where can we go to get both ? 
 Why have you changed your job so frequently ? 
 Ah , here we are . 
 Would you like to sit near the window ? 
 Let's have a look at the menu . Oh , there isn't a menu . Do you think you could ask the people at the next table if we could look at their menu ? 
 Hey , Steven . What are you going to do this Saturday ? 
 Are you going with your friends ? 
 Oh , aren't you afraid ? 
 I think mountaineering is an exciting sport , but a little dangerous . 
 Jack wonders whether Linda likes him or not . 
 He is too scared to ask her . 
 You know we went great lengths to promote the sales of your products . Through our continuous effort , consumers tend to accept your product . So , there will be a potential market for your product in this area , and would you let us act as your agent ? 
 If that's the case , we can talk about it first . What's your concept of a big amount ? 
 I'm afraid that's too much for us . 
 All right , we accept the challenge . What about the commission ? You know , we usually get a 20 % commission of the amount on every deal . 
 You may have known that we have competitors from South Korea and other countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to have the market investigation and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in newspaper and TV programs . A 20 % commission will not leave us much . 
 Oh , that's pitiful . 
 Sounds good . Where are we going ? 
 Need a new . girlfriend , huh ? 
 Whew ! That getup is terrific ! 
 That too . 
 If you're lucky , that might do the trick . 
 Hold on ! What's the big hurry ? 
 I wanna finish my drink first . I'll meet you at Sammy's . 
 Ouch ! I'm hurt . 
 Yes . I'm OK . I just had a tumble . No big deal . 
 Sorry . Can you please help me up ! I have trouble standing up by myself with the skis on . 
 Yes . I tried skiing on grass before . Not very good at it , though . 
 Yes , I have been working in the Public Relations Section of a company in the past two years . I plan the advertising campaign and cooperate the work of artists and typographers . Sometimes I have to do the work of a specialist when there ’ s something urgent . 
 Yes , sir . I acted as a secretary in an insurance company . 
 Well , to begin with , I would say she needs to be diligent , and the second point is that she has to do a lot of things on her own initiative . Finally , she can make notes in shorthand and types and has the skills in report writing , summary writing , keep minutes at meetings , and so on . Most important of all is that she seems to have a better memory than average . 
 Yes , I studied in a computer training program , and can process data through the computer . 
 I can handle them without any trouble 
 Above all , I have learned that what is good for the company is good for me . So I follow the instructions strictly and always keep my boss informed . 
 I really need to lose some weight . I should go on a diet . 
 Wow ! You are much skinnier since the last time I saw you . 
 How did you do it ? 
 I hate working out . 
 Good idea . Then the trainer will help me to make a fitness plan . Besides that , what's your secret ? 
 Could you tell me something about the Mid-Autumn Festival ? I find it also very interesting . 
 So , I understand why people eat moon cakes on that day . 
 Is it official ? 
 Oh , this is Monica 
 Yes . Let's first define the inspection right . 
 Would you tell me how the inspection is conducted before shipment and by which agency ? 
 And can you tell me about the re-inspection ? 
 I see . How do they make testing and analysis of this item ? 
 What if the results from the two inspections do not coincide with each other ? 
 I am so excited ! 
 I just voted . 
 Yes , I just had my 18th birthday this year . 
 Why is that ? 
 I didn ’ t think about it like that . 
 No , but that makes me even more excited . 
 Lucy , come here ! I can see the lake which is in the center of park . 
 It is a great place for a relaxing vacation . 
 Yeah , I agree . It makes you feel really good . 
 Do you mean the red things ? They are roses . 
 Me , too . 
 Sure . Let me just grab my calendar . All right . I ’ m free all day Tuesday and Thursday morning . 
 Okay . Sounds good . See you then . 
 Oh , to tell you the truth , I love the sky . When I was a child , I imagined flying into the blue sky some day . Now , I think the day has come . My dream will come true . And I like travelling very much and I enjoy working with people . 
 Yes , I think I am quite fluent in English . I got the certificate of the Secondary English Training last month . 
 The main responsibility of the stewardess is to make the passengers relaxed and happy during the flight . And good service is also important . 
 I just had a complete physical examination and I am in top condition . 
 Yes , I have two years of nursing experience , and now I am working as a nurse in a hospital . 
 My height is one meter and sixty-eight centimeters . I've never had any vision problems . 
 One of my strengths is my friendliness and open-minded attitude and also I think I have a warm personality . But sometimes , I find it is hard to tell others when I don't like what they are doing . 
 I'll try to speak in another language or I'll try my best to use gestures and draw pictures . 
 Yeah . I'm going with Jennie . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , it seems to me we have come quite a long way . However , let me take a close look at the final draft . 
 Well , everything we've discussed seems to be here . 
 I'll need a few minutes to check over my notes again on every detail . What about the quality standard ? 
 If he promised to help you , I'm sure he will help . He's a man of his word . 
 Last year he helped me out of trouble , too . 
 You're supposed to stand here quietly until the flag - raising ceremony is over . 
 When everything is over . 
 Not yet . You should stand still for another few minutes . Late-comers must be recorded . 
 Hello , Julia , I know a party that will begin at midnight . Would you love to go ? 
 What a pity ! The party is very interesting . 
 Don ’ t complain about it . She is concerned about your safety . 
 Is our destination the amusement park ? 
 What are you going to enjoy ? 
 I like neither . 
 OK , let me think . The roller coaster looks more fun . 
 It doesn't matter . We can go to the ferris wheel later . 
 We came too early . There're still three hours before the performance starts . 
 Never mind . What about taking a look around the theater ? 
 Here we go . There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art . ( They come to the museum of the Beijing Opera art . ) 
 Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ? 
 No , no , no . They are all handmade , girl . You know , the ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework . 
 Very few can . That's why these clothes only appear in the museum . 
 Oh , yes . I heard there was an opera fans club . They are probably practicing now . Wanna have a look ? 
 Follow me . Make sure not to interrupt them . 
 I heard you are looking for a house . 
 How is this going ? 
 I can recommend an apartment for you . A friend of mine is about to move . She doesn ’ t want to rent that house any longer . 
 It is on Spring Avenue . 
 It ’ s $ 240 a month . 
 It includes water , but not gas and electricity . 
 But it ’ s very convenient for you to walk to work . 
 Yes , it is . 
 Certainly ! But I have to contact my friend first . 
 Well , tell me something of yourself . 
 What working experience have you get ? 
 Oh , good . Irene , can you tell me why you plan to quit being a sales manager to work here as my assistant ? Don't you like your present job ? 
 I ’ d like to talk to you for a second , please . 
 I ’ d like to know why you ’ re always taking credit for work we ’ Ve done together like that line in the new Ice Cream ad ? 
 How time flies ! We have been lovers for nearly a year . We hit it off instantly . 
 Don't do that . You are asking for trouble . 
 Can you please give me a hand ? I can ’ t carry the heavy box . 
 I think you are flicking through it . 
 Is there anything I could help you with , sir ? 
 This way , please . 
 These are French coats , sir.They are quite fashionable these days . 
 How does that fit , sir ? 
 It looks good on you . 
 I'd get it myself if I could . 
 Mr . Crandall , I ’ m sorry , but I really don ’ t see the value in doing this entire project over from scratch . It would take a lot of work . 
 I agree . But I think that we can handle the problem by making a few major changes . I ’ d appreciate it if you would give me a chance . 
 May I ask a question ? 
 What does mph stand for ? 
 Why don't you begin by telling me something about yourself ? 
 The usual , you know , something about your background and experience and anything personal that you feel is pertinent . 
 Sounds as if you come from a professional family . 
 What made you decide to get into computers ? 
 Now what about your experience ? How long have you been working with computers ? 
 It certainly sounds impressive . Why don't you have your credentials sent to me and I'll show them to the board ? We'll probably get back to you in a week . 
 What can I do for you , Miss ? 
 That's right.The bus tour is really efficient and cheap . 
 9 : OO . Don't worry , Miss , we have buses every 15 minutes . 
 What's happening in that country ? 
 I am really interested in buying this television . 
 How much are you selling it for ? 
 You can't be serious . 
 That's too expensive for me . 
 You can't go down on the price . 
 I'll buy it for $ 2000 . 
 Mum , pass me some more please ! 
 But the ads say they're most nutritious . 
 In foreign trade , language differences are very important . 
 Fortunately , there is a widely-spoken commercial language , namely English . 
 In South America , the most common language is Spanish and Portuguese . 
 Yes , the language is a part of culture . It reflects a nation's character . 
 So in foreign trade , you must be very clear about language differences . 
 Sure . My number is 545-8897 , and I live at 908 Mulbury Street . 
 That ’ s right . 
 Yes , speaking . 
 What stock do you want to buy and how many ? 
 Let me get the asking price of the stock . Just a moment . Oh , now the asking price is $ 90 each share . By the way , what is the offering price ? 
 Then the difference between the asking price and the offering price is $ 2 . It's hard to take place today . 
 You can decide by yourself . 
 So , now I will buy you . Are you sure ? 
 I hear you and James are engaged at last . 
 When are you getting married ? 
 Oh , lovely . Where's the wedding going to be ? 
 Oh , yes , your parents live there , don't they ? 
 Where are you going to live after you're married ? 
 Are you going to give up your job ? 
 I feel like to wear my hair in this way . 
 Do you think it's suitable for me ? 
 Even though I really like it , it's just too modern for me . 
 Okay then . And I also want to have my hair colored . 
 Claret-red . 
 How long will it take ? I hope it won't be too long . 
 Now it's my son's turn to wait . 
 Take the books out of the bookcase . Put them in this box . 
 Take the magazines out of the bookcase . Put them in that box . 
 Peter ! Pack them . Don't read them . 
 Of course . 
 Reservation , please . 
 5 , and please put us as close as possible to the stage . 
 At 8 o'clock . 
 You were showing respect and admiration for them . 
 I went to Rotes ’ , you know , Edith Roth is the author of a book about moths . 
 I ’ m so thirsty . 
 No . Edith didn ’ t give anything to drink . 
 Oh ! Thank you . 
 What happened ? 
 Ben , we ’ re fifteen . What kind of job are you looking for ? 
 Uh-huh . 
 What is your greatest strength ? 
 What is your weakness ? 
 What is your greatest accomplishment ? 
 Can you work under pressure ? 
 What are the problems you have encountered in your job and how do you solve them ? 
 How do you deal with those who you think are difficult to work with ? 
 How about the repair fee ? 
 Great ! When can your technicians come to our factory ? 
 I've just contacted our technicians . They say they can go to your factory tomorrow afternoon . Can you tell me your factory's address , so they can find you easier ? 
 To provide the As excellent after-sales service is our motto . Please wait for our maintenance staff in your factory tomorrow afternoon . They will be there on time .

 No problem , what would you need , Mr . Smith ? 
 OK , I will send them to you soon . 
 Anything else , Mr . Smith ? 
 We can't go that way , the road is blocked for the next few days . 
 Some high speed chase scene , I think . 
 I think that they get a pretty good payoff . 
 I don't know about all of that , but think about it , their business gets free publicity ! 
 Would you mind going to dinner with me tonight ? 
 OK . 
 A Notice of Unemployment Insurance Award letter will be sent to you . 
 The Award Letter will inform you as to how much you will receive . 
 Every two weeks you will receive a Continued Claim Form that you must turn in . 
 You must show that you were available and that you looked for work . 
 One of the questions they ask you is if you were well enough to work .

 Don't worry about it . I keep forgetting everyone's birthdays as well . 
 Yes , Jane invited me for dinner to this new restaurant which opened near us . 
 The food was excellent , but Jane ordered a birthday cake , which they forgot about . So as you can see , you were not the only one . 
 Yes , Jane was quite upset about it . The manager came to apologize and we did get free dessert , but still ... 
 In the end it was a nice evening and I got an iPad as my birthday present which I wanted for a while . 
 I can try , but knowing Margaret she will see through that immediately . 
 What happened ? 
 How did you find him at last ? 
 It must have taught you a lesson this time . 
 She's in a meeting until noon . 
 Ok , thank you . 
 Well , the first lunar month is called Yuan-month , and in ancient times people called night Miao . And you know the festival is just in the middle of the month . 
 Sure . It ’ s indeed a culinary heaven which offers a wide range of delicious snacks to satisfy all tastes . Then , which one would you like ? 
 OK . Let ’ s go over there . For the Lantern Festival , you should never omit the Yuanxiao . 
 Actually , they are small dumpling balls made of glutinous rice flour . They are like Tangun . 
 Yes . And also , we can find Yuanxiao with both sweet and salty fillings . 
 Oh , the smelly bean curd . My favorite ! 
 Please ask . 
 For this position we prefer e-resume at the very beginning . Please send it to our department ’ s e-mail box . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 OK . Have you seen the samples ? 
 I'm glad to hear that . We are trying to give you a favourable one . 
 150 yuan for each piece . 
 How about 130 yuan ? 
 That's too little . Well , I'll come down to 120 yuan . 
 If you order more than 10,000 pieces , we can accept 115 yuan for each one . 
 Very good . It's a pleasure to do business with you , Mrs . Phoebe . 
 Um , very nice . It's warm in spring and cool in autumn . 
 Yes , it is , but not as hot as in Beijing . 
 I'm reading a novel , The mill on the floss , written by the famous novelist gorge alias . 
 It's meanly about relationship between a brother and a sister , who live in the mill on the river floss . It describe there are childhood and disputes cause them to separate , the book ends with them ha 
 Not really , i would consider it easy . 
 I really like short stories . 
 Certainly I have . I like to read books on vary subjects , and i can read everything I can get my hands on in my spare time . I don't want to idle away and waste my time . 
 Hey ! Taxi . 
 Capital Airport . 
 At 7:50 . 
 How long is the ride from here then ? 
 Yes , that'll be fine . How much is this going to cost ? 
 It will be held on October 15th . 
 You'd better be early in case that you may be late because of traffic jam . That will put you in a insurmountable place . 
 Do you have your book list for your class ? 
 Fine . Once you have it , you can go to the bookstore . Do you know where that is ? 
 OK , so once you pass the gym , it's the first door on your left . Do you know you can also sell your used textbooks there ? 
 You just take them with you and trade them with the used textbook man just outside the door . Do you think you will be going there today ? 
 Well , if you decide to go , I could meet you over there at 1 
 Well , then , I'll talk to you later . Have a good day ! 
 My native place is Shanghai , which is a very beautiful cosmopolitan city . 
 Yes , I am a local resident . 
 Well , the stereotype in the movies is that L . A . is a frivolous town with a lot of flaky people . I guess , in the back of my mind , that's what I expected . 
 Well , it is and it's not . The city of L . A . is much bigger and more diverse than I had expected . There are people here from all over the country and all over world , like New York . I've heard people say that in L . A . , everyone is from somewhere else . Tha's partly true . So , I've met all kinds of people here . What I'm realizing is that the picture of L . A . that's in movies only represents a small segment of the city . 
 Is there a swimming pool in this hotel ? 
 What exactly does that mean ? 
 That sounds really neat . Is there an extra charge for these swim stations ? 
 Are the swim stations open 24 hours , like the rest of the gym ? 
 I'll go down there as soon as I can ! 
 What's the name of the girl that has just passed us ? 
 She's so pretty . I'd like to make friends with her . 
 Oh , I think I broke my leg . 
 Thanks . 
 All right . 
 James Taylor , 23 , March 30,1982 . 
 I don't have it . 
 I don't have health insurance . 
 Oh ! 
 No , I haven ’ t gotten over there in a few weeks . How is he ? 
 You said it ! I can't believe he lasted as long as he did . 
 Pretty good . Where are you going ? 
 Wait . We have to return to our homeroom and wait to be dismissed . 
 Our homeroom teacher has to take attendance again to make sure that we're all here . 
 Yeah . I'm going to my locker to get my jacket . Catch you later . 
 Yes , I'd like a book about law . 
 Uh , the Origin of Law . And it's written by Professor Felix of Harvard . 
 Next week ? It is too late . I need it urgently . 
 No , thanks any way . 
 Peter , listen to the lyrics of this song . 
 It's from the musical that is so popular in New York right now . Do you like it ? 
 That's why it is so popular . It was recorded by Barbara Tutin . I've heard that when she sang this song on stage the opening night , she created quite a sensation . 
 Well , then , you need an introduction . The school drama club is putting on a musical production . How about going together ? 
 What's the best way downtown ? 
 Depends ? Depends on what ? 
 Is that expensive ? 
 I am in no particular hurry . 
 That's not so bad . 
 She had a sudden heart attack . 
 Don ’ t worry . She is much better now . But you are not permitted to disturb her at the moment . 
 Yes , I think so . 
 My pleasure . 
 Linda , this is David Wang . 
 I need to talk with Marry . 
 Thanks . 
 Where do you need to catch this bus at ? 
 I can tell you what bus to catch , but you have to walk a little bit . 
 The 267 stops at Altadena Drive and Fair Oaks . 
 Get on the bus heading west . 
 Del Mar and Hill . 
 No problem . 
 Nothing special . 
 I'd like to . See you then . 
 May , just let him go . 
 I know . 
 He lives nearby and he would just glance at the newspaper headlines , read the political sections and return them later . 
 He used to be a hero during the war time and everyone respect him . 
 Yes , he has no children and his wife passed away when he was in the battle . 
 I bet . But he is always busy telling the children stories . 
 Room service.What can I do for you ? 
 I am sorry.sir . Someone will there in a moment . 
 Yes , sir . I assure you it would never happen again . 
 I want to go to Lid Hotel . 
 Which bus should I take then ? 
 Thank you so much ! 
 Excuse me . Can I get a ticket on the next flight to Frankfurt ? 
 What's the fare for a single ticket ? 
 Can you give me a special offer ? 
 How about a round trip ? Could you offer us something more ? 
 Your family must be busy shopping for Christmas , now . 
 Woo , your home will beautiful on Christmas . 
 I do wish your christmas and happy new year . 
 Excuse me , what material is it ? 
 No , where are the cotton cloths ? 
 What is the shrink rate after washing ? 
 Hi I came in on flight 513 . Everyone else took their luggage off the conveyor belt , but mine didn ’ t seem to be there . 
 You ’ re kidding . What am I going to do ? 
 You can reach me at 13661306917 . 
 That ’ s ok . There wasn ’ t anything important in there anyway . The shaving kit more than makes up for my lost luggage . 
 I ’ Ve had a lot worse problems than this traveling so it ’ s really no big deal . 
 Very interesting ! 
 How about going to dance ? There is a very good nightclub nearby . 
 I'm glad you like it.The band is called " Four and One " . They are especially good at playing rock and roll . 
 Then you must be interested in disco dancing , aren't you ? 
 OK . Let's disco . 
 That's a waltz . Would you like to try it ? 
 All right . Let me get you something to drink . 
 She ’ s in the garden , Jane . 
 She ’ s sitting under the tree . 
 Yes , he is . He ’ s climbing the tree . 
 Tim is . 
 The dog ’ s in the garden , too . It ’ s running across the grass . It ’ s running after a cat . 
 I need to know how much money is in my account . 
 Certainly . 
 I think the supermarket is closed now . 
 It closes at 7:00 on Sundays . 
 Don't worry , we can go tomorrow morning . It opens at 8: 00 . 
 Let's take a walk for a half an hour . My sister will get here at about 8: 30PM and then we can all go out to dinner . 
 She lives in San Francisco . 
 I think she's lived there for about 10 years . 
 San Diego . 
 I'm going to stay in the city . 
 I'm going to work with my father at the store . In the evening , I'll read books.On weekends , I'll go to the beach with my family . 
 No , but I can learn . What are you going to do this summer ? 
 I've never gone to camp . What do you do there ? 
 That sounds wonderful . 
 I think he's going to the mountains with his parents . 
 You too , Peter . Give my regards to John . I'll see you in September . 
 I need to see your ID . 
 You need to give me your ID and $ 27 . 
 Go get it . 
 All right , I'm going to need you to fill this out . 
 Here's a pen for you . 
 You need to turn that in at Window B . 
 I ’ m looking for a sweater for my wife . Tomorrow is her birthday . And I know she needs a woolen sweater . 
 It feels good . Are there cowl-neck pullovers with the same color ? My wife prefers a turtleneck to a V-shaped collar . 
 Size one . By the way , what if I bring home this sweater and my wife doesn ’ t like it ? 
 All right . Could I have it gift-wrapped , please ? 
 What's your ideal boss ? 
 Is there any way of ensuring we'll have enough time for our talks ? 
 So our evenings will be quite full then ? 
 Dad , you keep talking about family in New Zealand . Who are they ? 
 Is uncle Bill your brother ? 
 So his two daughters are my cousins ? 
 What are step-sisters ? 
 So uncle Bill's wife is Jane's mother but not Sarah's mother . Right ? 
 And when are they coming to visit us ? 
 Hello , I want to apply for the position of an usher in your restaurant . 
 What else do I need to do ? 
 Excuse me , sir . But please call an ambulance . My friend suddenly got a sharp pain in the stomach . 
 Oh , is there ? Will you find someone to take us to the hospital then ? 
 Yes , he is . 
 What did the doctor say ? 
 Did he give you any advice ? 
 Yes , you must put yourself on a diet . 
 Well , do you think I have to ? 
 Please look at the sky.Don ' t you see the dark clouds ? It's going to rain soon . 
 But I don't think it's so nice . 
 The weather report says it's going to rain for a whole week . 
 What do you do when you are angry ? 
 That ’ s smart . What do you usually do to relieve your anger ? 
 Oh , what kind of music do you listen to ? 
 I think that might work for me as well . 
 Like what ? 
 I feel chilly and I've got a pain in my abdomen . 
 Almost a week . 
 What should I do ? 
 Thank you . 
 Are you aware that you ran through that stop sign ? 
 How could you not notice it ? 
 You know.You ' re right . The bushes are covering the sign . 
 Now that I think about it , I can see how you missed it . 
 I'll let you off with a warning . 
 Don't worry about it . I need to have something done about those bushes . 
 Yes , but dinner was excellent 
 No , thank you . Check please . 
 Here is the two dollars , will you bring me the receipt ? 
 Please keep the change . 
 I was just about to go to bed when the telephone rang last night . 
 Kate . She said she was too excited to go to sleep . 
 It ’ s true . Guess what we were talking about last night . 
 Yeah , how do you know about that ? 
 Mr . Charles , I feel that we have had a very pleasant talk . 
 Yes , your company is a big one in the field and has great potential . 
 I want to know about the salary information in your company . 
 I hope my starting salary will be 3,000 yuan a month if I become a formal worker . 
 Really ? That's good news for me . 
 It sounds great ! 
 By the way , how many days do we work every week ? 
 OK , I see 
 John , they are old-fashioned people from the Chinese countryside . That ’ s their custom . 
 Don ’ t your relatives visit other relatives ? 
 I think that maybe Chinese families are closer than your families . 
 Who got ripped off ? 
 Well , maybe not 100 percent . I did hear about some tricks people use . 
 There are shills . A shill is someone who bids up the price of their own sale . 
 Where can I park my car ? 
 Okay . Here you are . 
 Peter , how often do you exercise ? 
 Now , tell me , what do you eat ? 
 Do you eat a lot of vegetables ? 
 What do you drink ? 
 What do you drink ? 
 Good . 
 Splendid . 
 That's an excellent idea . 
 Yes . I'd like to use a safety deposit box . 
 Let me see . I think it's OK . 
 Here you are . 
 Yes . 
 Thank you . 
 I see . Thank you .

 Do you believe what they say ? 
 Thanks , but I'm a lousy typist . 
 I'm not very sure.but I know ruby is less valuable than diamond . 
 I got it from an encyclopedia . 
 You're going out of your way for us , I believe . 
 Mark ? I need that file you took yesterday . 
 Mark , I told you yesterday afternoon that I would be using that file today . 
 How do you spend your free time ? 
 Are you introverted or extroverted ? 
 What kinds of sports do you like ? 
 What kind of personality do you think you have ? 
 Here's the picture of my family . 
 OK.She ' s near-sighted , with a pair of glasses on her nose.She is the only one wearing glasses in my family . 
 Yes , I am . What's up ? 
 With pleasure . I suppose you dance often . 
 But I am told that you dance wonderfully well . 
 No . Just occasionally . 
 It's hard to say , but I do love the foxtrot and waltz . 
 To tell you the truth , I don't like it . It's too noisy . 
 Oh , it's really beautiful , but I just can't do it well . 
 OK . 
 Tom , I married Julia last month . Have you already known it ? 
 Indeed , we got married too soon . 
 Yes . However , I believe that marriage comes by destiny . I knew I would marry Julia when I met her at the first time . 
 We're happy together now .

 What's your son's name ? 
 Can you describe his appearance to me ? 
 OK , I see . Dear Daniel , please come to the broadcasting station when you've heard this , your mother is waiting for you . If other tourists see a boy in a blue sportswear and a pair of white sportsshoes , 1.4 meters , please ask him to go to the broadcasting station . Thank you ! 
 That's not a problem . Leave it with me , and find something that you like . 
 We have nothing on sale today . But we're having a big sale next weekend . 
 Everything you can see will be on sale . 
 The savings will be worth the short wait . See you next weekend . 
 Yes , I'm in a bit of a rush . Could I have a piece of apple pie please ? 
 No , thanks . 
 Zina . Look , I know when I hired you , I told you I'd pay you a salary . But I just can't . 
 I know it's awkward , but you're going to be thanking me later . I'm going to make you rich . 
 What do you think of this dress ? Do you think it suits me ? 
 It ’ s just the right size-a perfect fit ! Have you seen anything you like ? 
 It looks too big for you , but I like the color and the material is good quality . Is it on sale ? 
 I might get one too , but in a different color . I prefer light blue to white 。 
 I ’ m getting this beret ? Doesn ’ t it look cool ? I ’ d like to get some jeans too , but I don ’ t have enough cash on me . 
 Thanks ! Now I don ’ t need to come back to the shop a second time . 
 I need to report a break-in . 
 Last night . 
 It happened at my house . 
 I'm not sure yet . 
 My front window was busted . 
 Please hurry . 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry . I forgot about those completely . I ’ ll bring them by your office . 
 You bet . I ’ ll swing by after lunch , okay ? 
 I'm doing fine.Don ' t mind me.It ' s a wonderful birthday party.Everyone is enjoying himself . 
 Don't mention it . 
 I have no idea . I have no appetite . 
 Let's go there then . Is it a Chinese restaurant ? 
 I hope so . 
 I absolutely love the apartment . 
 I do have one problem with the apartment . 
 I don ’ t like all those stains in the carpet . 
 I did not know that . 
 That was the only thing that I saw wrong with the apartment . 
 It ’ s absolutely incredible . I ’ ll take it . 
 Of course . 
 It's made of genuine ivory , besides , it's of exquisite workmanship . The price is marked 200 yuan . 
 what do you do when you see a homeless person on the streets begging for money ? 
 homeless youth can easily become involved with drugs and prostitution . Do you do anything to help them ? 
 that's a good idea . Do they usually accept the food ? 
 it's sad how more and more young people are sleeping on the streets in London now . 
 it's true . The economy is in a bit of mess at the moment . 
 there just isn't enough affordable housing to go around . If only the housing cost would drop , fewer people would be in financial trouble . 
 something's got to change---and it's got to happen soon . 
 I can only hope that one day they will change . 
 It sure was . I couldn't eat another bite . 
 you're right . I have to get up early to go to work tomorrow . 
 don't worry about it . Tonight is my treat . 
 no , I insist . I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't . 
 alright , if that's the way you are going to be , we'll split the bill . 
 just promise you will let me treat you to dinner next week , ok ? 
 great . Bye . 
 What kind of promotional events are scheduled for the new product line ? 
 What kind of sponsoring are we talking about ? I don't know how effective sponsorship really is ... 
 Other than the marathon , what else is on the list ? 
 Sports , medicine , education ... seems kind of random , don't you think ? 
 Could you help me with these books ? 
 Please , George . 
 May I help you ? 
 Is that a one-way or round trip ? 
 When would you want to leave ? 
 I am sorry . The flight on Nov . 21st is full.Do you mind if I put your name on the waiting list ? 
 Would you mind giving me a hand ? 
 Help me hang up this picture , please . Would you hold it straight while I put in the nail ? 
 Now , hand me the hammer and those nails , please . 
 There ! How does it look ? Tell me if I've got it straight . 
 How do you feel about the TV series ? 
 Yes , I agree , but still a lot of people watch it . 
 Taylor , can you tell me how to apply for a job on the Internet ? 
 Do I have to send an E-mail ? 
 But I still don't know which unit is in need of staff . 
 Can any unit see my information ? 
 Which websites offer this service ? 
 Thank you . 
 I'd like a trim . 
 No , thanks . 
 Cut it short in the front , but leave it long in the back . Leave just a little over the ears . 
 How silly of you to jump out of the window ! 
 Why not use staircases ? The terror was not so violent at that time . 
 Maybe the situation is too urgent . 
 How many do you intend to order for our shirts ? 
 We are not interested in small orders . I suggest you order at least 2 000 dozen . 
 Yes , of course . We have enough productivity . You can rest assured . 
 Sure , we can reduce our price by ten percent . 
 At their last meeting , the stockholders voted unanimously to block the merger of our company with Blycore . All the executive committee was in favor of the merger ... I don't understand how the stockholders could have so much power to throw a wrench in the plans ... 
 Is it really that simple ? It doesn't seem very efficient to run things that way ... 
 I guess I'd buy that ... 
 You don't make any prior appointment , do you ? 
 Please tell your name , company and the nature of your business . 
 I see . Wait a minute , please . 
 Would you like to go to work or continue your studies after graduation ? 
 So you will continue to study for a master's degree ? 
 How can you finance your education abroad ? It is very expensive to study abroad . 
 It could be pretty tough studying abroad . Being so far away from home ... 
 A friend and I are planing to go out , why ? what's up ? 
 I am afraid I can't I am going to be out all day . 
 I wish I could , but it's my mums birthday . 
 Much as I ' d like to , I am afraid i wont be free next week , I have a lot of work . 
 I am really sorry too , maybe I can give you a call sometime . 
 Sure 
 Oh , yes , please . But you are just closing , aren't you ? 
 I shall not keep you long then . It was about some saucepans you had in your window last week . 
 Oh , they were lovely . Sort of imitation wood , dark brown color , country-style you know , and the lids , if I remember rightly , they had a sort of leaf pattern , or was it flowers ? 
 Oh , you must know the ones I mean . They were on sale , a real bargain . Reduced to a quarter of the original price . I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them . 
 I don't think you did , you know . My neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday . 
 May I just have a look , to see if there is anything else ? 
 Yes , yes , I am sorry I won't keep you . It must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time . But they were such beautiful saucepans . I ’ d have bought them if I had made up my mind on the spot . 
 Oh , look ! That was the one there . That is the sort of thing I was looking for . But it's not quite the color . 
 There it is . That is the pattern ! The set behind you . Thank goodness , they haven't been sold . And thank you so much for being so patient with me . Yes , those are the ones . 
 Here is the notice . 
 Sure , here you are . 
 this party rocks ! 
 I'm with you on that . Check out that one over there . I think I'm in love ! 
 oh , that's Janice . She's just new in town . You have a thing for blonds , eh ? 
 I bet . Why not go over and talk to her ? She's really nice . 
 come on ! Man up ! You'll never know until you try . 
 all right . But I think you ought to move soon . 
 I can see five other guys eying her up . 
 good luck !

 This isn ’ t the first time you have been considerably late with the rent . I need to start the procedure to evict you . 
 This is a notice to inform you that the sheriff will evict you in 30 days if you do not pay up on your rent . 
 You can keep the apartment if you stay caught up on your rent . Otherwise , I need to find someone who can make the payments . 
 Thank you . I will need a cashier ’ s check or cash , please . 
 Come on ! You're pulling my leg . 
 Wow ! Congratulations ! 
 It is in mine too.The biggest issue is water . The climate is dry and so water conservation is very important . 
 Water is rationed . We can only use a certain amount each month . It means that we cannot use some modern household items , like washing machines . They use too much water . 
 Yes , I agree . The air here is much more polluted than in my country . Of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry . 
 The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don ’ t believe that any single country can do anything about it . 
 My German teacher thought it would be a good idea to have German pen friends to write to in German . 
 The only thing is that my pen friend will be writing in English . 
 That's right . And it's a B that I'll be writing too . Her name is Olga . 
 That's a great idea ! Why didn't I think of that ?

 Would you like to come ?

 I ’ m sorry to hear that . 
 Well , perhaps , another time . 
 Can't you see ? I'm practicing tai chi ! 
 I'm just a beginner . Did my poses make me the butt of jokes ? 
 So , is there anything wrong with my strokes ? 
 Like this ? 
 Did I do it right ? 
 What should I do with my legs then ? 
 Fantastic ! I guess the same is true with the arms , right ? 
 Hello , Daisy , how are you doing ? 
 I have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home , so you wouldn't have seen me . Recently , I've been obsessed with horror films . 
 Yeah , you are right I used to not watch horror films , but after seeing Silence of the Lamb with Mike last month , I fell in love with them . 
 But it's really exciting . 
 Basically . you'll watch any type of movie except horror . 
 I think you should have a try someday . Maybe you'll change your mind .

 Excellent . Well , thank you very much , Mr . B , and you'll be hearing from us in the next few days , either way . 
 Have you bought another handset 
 This is silver gray , while I remember your handset was black . 
 Can a handset case be changed ? 
 How many cases are accessible ? 
 It's really going to be fresh all the time . 
 We have a copy machine in our computer lab , located on the first floor . 
 The price per copy is ten cents . 
 There shouldn't be any long lines , sir . 
 I'm very glad you could come , Mr . Liu . Will you take a seat at the head of the table ? It's an informal dinner , please don't stand on ceremony ... Mr . Liu , would you like to have some chicken ? 
 Generally speaking , Cantonese food is a bit light ; Shanghai food is rather oily ; and Hunan dishes are very spicy , having a strong and hot taste . 
 Mr . Liu , would you care for another helping ? 
 Did you enjoy the meal ? 
 I'm so glad you like it .

 But for now , the band is playing the songs from our senior year . Get out on that dance floor ! 
 Hi , Navy . Come in please . I'm just putting away on my books .

 That's all right . I'm almost finished . Do you need my help ? 
 All right I'll read it soon .

 OK , I know what you mean . It's my treat . 
 Of course . Let's go . 
 Pork chops . 
 Why ? 
 Honey , have you all packed ? 
 It is cold on the mountain . Have you packed the windshelled clothes and bodywarmers ? 
 You are so thoughtful . Do you think our tent will be working well ? 
 What about our mobile phones and cameras ? Did you charge them last night ? 
 Good . We should tell our neighbour that they can call the police if some emergency happens to us . 
 Smith is always careless , it is his Achilles ’ s heel . 
 He will burn his fingers . 
 I hate to say goodbye , but it's late . 
 I wish I could.But I'm afraid I can't . I've got some serious studying to do . I have to go . 
 See you on Moday.Have a great weekend . 
 Can I help you ? 
 I am sorry , sir . Your baggage is 2kg overweight.You have to pay extra money for it . 
 Sure . Now it's all right . Here is your boarding pass and label . Have a nice trip .

 OK ... Do I need to put on my sister's name for the receiver ? 
 OK , I see . Here you are . Is that OK now ? 
 Here you are . What is the rate ? 
 OK . When will this remittance arrive ? 
 That's good . 
 We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also , in line with that goal , redo our image ... 
 Don't you think all of the money goes to the ads and we have nothing to read . 
 Extra income.They can get rich with sheer ads . 
 Just what are you proposing ? 
 That's a big change from 25 % ! 10 % is beyond my negotiating limit . Any other ideas ? 
 Sure . I have to talk to my office anyway . I hope we can find some common ground on this . 
 I hope so , Dana . My instructions are to negotiate hard on this deal , but I'm trying very hard to reach some middle ground . 
 Dana . I can't bring those numbers back to my office , they'll turn it down flat . 
 May , we are fools to hang out at noon . It's dying hot today . My skin is too weak to be exposed under the summer sun . 
 You know , honey , I used it all on the way over . 
 The heat is driving crazy and I hate my new hat . 
 But I bought it to get rid of the heat . Now it does nothing but burning my head . 
 Laugh all you want , whatever . We need to get out of the heat . 
 Give me a break . It's not funny . 
 Hope so ! Good thing is that autumn is just around the corner . 
 There is the Balance of Net Liabilities . This must not exceed its net assets and no business loss can be shown during the past two years . 
 And the total ratio of return on assets should not be lower than the average , for that particular industry , for the first two quarters of the year . 
 Of course we will need proof , originals and duplicate of everything . As soon as you bring in the proof and we assess it , it should be very quick indeed . 
 How do you do , Mr . Brown ? It ’ s a pleasure to get to know you . 
 I propose a toast to the health of everyone here and to the success of our negotiation .

 Why do you think you be a good fit or this job ? 
 Can you working under pressure ? 
 Are you more a follower or a leader ?

 do you have a copy of your family tree in your house ? I ’ d love to see it . 
 that ’ s amazing . Do you have a large extended family ? 
 are you very close to your first-cousins ? 
 I see . who ’ s the head of your household ? 
 that ’ s interesting . What does your grandfather think of your step-mother ? 
 that ’ s pretty much how you feel about your step-mother . Like grandmother , like grandson . 
 You can say that again . 
 Have you tried an outlet ? 
 Many of my friends shop at outlets . 
 I'm only too happy to help . 
 Hi , could I speak to Nancy please ? 
 Yeah , it ’ s me . Can you give me a lift after work ? 
 Hi . My name's David Johnson . I'd like to make an appointment . 
 A checkup . I think I have a bad cavity . Half the side of my head hurts . 
 One of the back ones . 
 I'll never ever work together with him ! 
 Will you take my materials back from him for me ? Please ! 
 Hi , good to see you . What can we assist you with today ? Going away on business again ? 
 We do always recommend people take Traveller's Cheques when travelling overseas . The world is a dangerous place nowadays , you never know . 
 Sandy , can you help me contact these people ? 
 Well , I need to confirm the time of their classes . 
 They are all listed here on this sheet of paper . 
 Unless it ’ s marked differently , it ’ s their home numbers . 
 Then , you should e-mail them with the information . 
 They should have then listed on their resumes . 
 Then send them a SMS on their cell phone . 
 Yes . I called the first three people on the list , but they didn ’ t pick up . 
 I left a voice message on one---just for the first person on the list . 
 I told her that she should call me back at my office number . 
 Yes , that sounds like a good idea . She might not get the other message in time . 
 Sure . You can use this one . The pin number is written on the back of the card . 
 Great work . I ’ m off for the weekend ! See you on Monday . 
 How would you like this order shipped ? 
 Are you going to ship this by air ? That might cost a little more . 
 I'll check the costs and call you back . 
 Any new ideas on the Mr . Fro case ? How can we give this motor oil a new brand identity ? 
 I could use one , too . I'm still burnt out from that last cigarette ad campaign . 
 Allan , I am really disappointed by your lack of effort on this project . 
 No , I ’ m sorry . I disagree . I don ’ t think you ’ Ve been working at full speed at all . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 Are you depositing cash or a check ? 
 Please sign the back of the check . 
 Do you want cash back ? 
 How much cash would you like ? 
 Here ’ s your $ 150 .

 But he always wimps out of difficulty . 
 How can we get in touch with you ? 
 About one week . 
 Hello , Tony . Fancy meeting you here . How are things going with you ? 
 Pretty good ! How are your parents these days ? 
 Oh , good . That's nice to hear . Well , I am going to a football match . I need to go . 
 Thanks , I will , byebye ! 
 I think I can , Kate . It must be Karen Marsh , the actress . 
 That must be Conrad Reeves . 
 No , He must be her fourth or fifth . 
 She does , doesn ’ t she ! I read she ’ s twenty-nine , but she must be at least forty . 
 She was a famous actress when I was still a schoolgirl . 
 Not that long ago ! I ’ m not more than twenty-nine myself . 
 I don't mind shopping for food and other daily needs . 
 It's fun walking around them , but their displays are so good I'm tempted to buy things I don't really need . 
 No , I haven't . 
 Did you really ? 
 Well , congratulations . 
 I'm so happy for you . 
 Yes . You really deserved this . 
 Yes . Good for you . 
 I haven't had a chance to see it . 
 The lights were out everywhere . 
 They what ? 
 That's crazy . 
 Were the looters found ? 
 I hope this doesn't happen again . 
 Yes , I did indeed . But , could you tell me what exactly the ' Priority Service Room ' is used for ? 
 I think of myself as a valued customer . What services can you offer me ? 
 Right . Is there anything else that can be done there ? 
 The list goes on and on ! 
 So , I can talk to my Personal Banker 24/7 . That's really thoughtful of you . And I have to say , I love the new look of the bank . 
 First of all , I need to share what the purpose of a home inspection is . Do you understand what I was doing there ? 
 I help you spot potential problems with the home before you purchase it . 
 Sellers aren ’ t really all that objective . They may have gotten used to a leaky faucet , but it is still broken . 
 The owners may wish to pay to have the problems fixed , or maybe the price of the house can be reduced . 
 The house has a very outdated electrical system . Many of the switches and outlets do not work and are unsafe . 
 They ’ re in the cabinet next to the sink . 
 They ’ re in the cabinet above the dishwasher . 
 They ’ re in that drawer . 
 No problem . 
 It's my pleasure ! 
 It is allowed to carry 55 pounds for each passenger . 
 You will have to pay some for every extra pound . 
 You can bring one , if you want to . 
 Thank you . It's a pleasure to meet you . 
 Thank you , they are beautiful . 
 Yes . It was so crowded . I'm worn-out . Let's find our seats . 
 Let me see ... yes , one window seat and one aisle . 
 That's fine . I'd like to be on the aisle anyway . It's easier to get in and out . 
 I think the smaller carry-on bag can go in the overhead compartment , and the others can go under the seat . 
 Don't forget to keep the seat belt on . 
 Yes ! 
 Oh , you have too wild of an imagination . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 Oh , yes . I remember . 
 I love to dance the fast music . 
 Yes , it's my favorite . 
 You're a good dancer . 
 Sorry . I feel like sitting out the next dance . 
 Good idea . 
 That would be a possibility . Where is this fundraiser taking place ? 
 Do you need it for the whole weekend ? 
 We will need to know who will be driving the van . 
 It needs to be back on Sunday night . Can you arrange for that ? 
 Just keep track of everything and get it all back where you took it from by Sunday evening . 
 I don't know . Maybe a pair of new shoes . 
 That's a dandy idea . Thank you for reminding me . 
 What ’ s up ? 
 America ? Did you get admit to MIT ? 
 Congratulations ! Susan . I ’ m so happy for you . 
 Really going to miss you . 
 Ok . Take care . Have a nice journey . 
 Look after yourself . Bye . 
 Good evening , sir . Welcome to the Comfort Inn . 
 Mmmm . I ’ m not sure if we have you down here . How do you spell your last name ? 
 Oh , right . You ’ re in our system . I was just looking under Li . So , we ’ Ve got you down for a Business Suite for three days . If I could just have your credit card , I ’ ll process your check-in while

 I'm fine thanks . How about you ? 
 Not a lot , actually . Busy at work of course - we've got a big project coming up in Malaysia . I may have to go to KL in a few weeks . 
 Probably in a week or two . I'll let you know . 
 Shame on you ! 
 I'd like to speak your export manager , please . 
 This is Mrs Wang , from Jane coper . 
 When will he come back , do you know ? 
 May I leave message ? 
 Please ask him to give me a call as soon as he return . he has my number . 
 thank you . goodbye . 
 Isn't that a good thing ? Having fewer bosses means having less stress , don't you think ? 
 You're right , we do need leadership . But what we don't need is too many people to lead us . You know what they say about too many chiefs and not enough Indians ... 
 Mary likes mountain climbing . 
 Yes , she's a professional climber . 
 Where is my back pack ? 
 I just put it on the chair a while ago , but now it's gone . 
 Of course , I am sure . I bet someone stole it . 
 Can I borrow these magazines ? 
 Are we allowed to go into the stacks to look for books ? 
 So will you back me up if things get ugly with Elvin ? 
 We just will.Trust me on that . 
 He'll do it . He's too proud not to . 
 Yes , I do . Everyone . 
 Is there any difference ? 
 I think I would like the former one . 
 I am sorry , sir.All the tickets have been sold out . 
 Sorry , sir . The only tickets of the same performance available are on 21st . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 The machine is over there . 
 Yes , you will have to pay to use it . 
 It costs ten cents a copy . 
 You can copy as much as you ’ d like . 
 The instructions for the copier are posted on it . 
 Hi , I want to check out . Here is my room key . 
 Thanks . 
 Well , except for one night , I enjoyed the hotel . And I loved New York , of course . 
 Can I have the menu , please ? 
 Hi , I'd like to have a beer . 
 I'd like to try a local beer . What would you suggest ? 
 Sounds good . I'll take that . 
 I advise you to take an additional course in some Chinese schools . 
 This kind of school is good at helping people to improve their Chinese . 
 Sure . You can review the lessons you have learned at school and learn something new there . 
 it seems the department still has some money left in the budget . Do you have any suggestions how to use it before the budget is renewed ? 
 but we've done that many times . We want something fresh this time . 
 sounds like a good idea , but a band sounds too expensive . 
 I don ' t think so . I don't think people are going to like it if they have to pay to come . But we certainly can cut costs in other ways , such as make the party BYOB . 
 bring your own beverage . We can provide food , but people have to bring their own drinks . 
 maybe you have a point . How about having a party on a Friday afternoon ? We'll stop early , order some pizza , and serve drinks . There'll be music but no band . Having the party in the office will make 
 Have you got any cheaper ones ? 
 That's more reasonable . I'll take this one . 
 Well , Mr . Parsons , as I mentioned before I ’ m someone who needs new challenges . I ’ m really focused and hard-working . I think my academic results prove this . 
 Well , I believe I ’ m a good team-player , but I can also work well independently . I ’ m very enthusiastic and , well I hope my colleagues would agree , I ’ m fun to work with . 
 Hmm , that ’ s a tough question . But I would have to say my passion . I ’ m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career . 
 Yes , I need a job that can give full play to my skills . 
 I like peace.As a matter of fact , I once had a job in a library . 
 Yes , Sir . 
 All right , who should I send them to ? 
 Ok , home or office address ? 
 Should I enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ? 
 Our Afghan customers wanna buy China's tea . I am thinking of placing an order with you . 
 I like both . Could you show me some samples ? 
 Oh , such a variety . All of them are excellent both in color and flavour . No wonder our people like China ’ s tea better than any other kind . Could you give me some idea of the prices ? 
 I'd like you to quote me CIF Karachi . 
 Yes . I want 500 kilograms of Black tea from Anti , 200 kilograms of Jasmine tea from Hangzhou and 100 kilograms of Crushed Black tea , first grade . 
 Yes . See you tomorrow afternoon . 
 Yeah.Especially when you have something urgent to do . 
 That's true . 
 Let me check . It has a paper jam . 
 Be careful , the cartridge can be very hot . 
 You should unplug the phone . 
 Do you want me to wake you in an hour ? 
 I'll start dinner at 6:00 . 
 If not , your nose will wake you up . 
 You might even dream about dinner . 
 Have a nice nap . 
 Why ? He did something wrong . 
 I only wanted to help him . 
 Steven , can you give us a summary about your work ? What do you get from your work ? 
 Why do you think so ? 
 Very good . Anything else ? 
 I must praise you for your modesty and diligence . What's your plan next ? 
 I've got to commend you ; you really did a good job . 
 Good evening . Can I help you ? 
 Just a moment , please . Oh , yes . One twin and one single . Is that right ? 
 Will you fill out this form , please ? 
 It must come from the bakery on the corner.They are baking cookies . Their cookies are very popular in town . 
 I think so . The bakery invited a famous baker from the USA . He is good at making cookies . 
 Look at the swiss roll over there , they look delicious , too , I am thinking about buying one . 
 I am starting loving this bakery now . 
 You should have told me earlier . I am a cookie lover . 
 You might want to try the mangoes . 
 It's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit . It has a big seed in it . 
 Maybe some animals eat the seed , but humans don't . You'd have to soak it for 10 years . 
 Today you get a 50 - percent discount . They're only $ 1 each . 
 Their flesh is soft and juicy . It has a citrus taste . It's sweet . 
 Just press into it gently with your thumb . If it feels soft , it's ready to eat . 
 These are from Guatemala , but we're going to start getting mangoes from India . 
 oh , hi Lucas , come on in . I'm Barbara . Nice to meet you . 
 would you like something to drink ? I've got tea and some grape juice . 
 oh , there is a supermarket not far from here . But there is also a tea house around the corner , where you can get tea and a tea set as well . 
 you are right about that . It's quiet and very convenient . You can get to the bus and the subway stations within ten minutes'walk . There's a grocery store , a book store , a gym , and many restaurants 
 well , if you want we can go together sometime . Actually I was thinking of going this afternoon , if you like , you can join me and I can show you the neighborhood along the way . 
 Sally , I ’ m tired of this Western food . I really miss my mother ’ s Sichuan cooking . 
 I have tried . But Americans like butter , bread , sugar , and cream too much . 
 It ’ s interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs , do not take naps during the day , and yet they can be so heavy . 
 This position demands a higher writing ability , so please say something about your writing ability . 
 Did you have any kind of punishment in your life and studies ? 
 What was the reason ? 
 Can you read and write English and French ? 
 Could you tell me something about your English education ? 
 Hey , that ’ s a very nice hairdo you ’ re wearing ! 
 You did it yourself ? Wow , you are good ! 
 He ’ s just got no idea of how good you are . 
 What's the problem ? 
 Did you see if all the connections are right ? 
 The connections between your CPU and your outlet . 
 If your plugs aren't connected all the way , the computer won't turn on . 
 Why don't you try it and see what happens ? 
 Let me know if that doesn't work . 
 We want to see the Statue of Liberty too . 
 You have never gone to the Statue of Liberty ? ! I can't believe it ! But you live here ! 
 I know . Are the subway trains easy to take here ? 
 When you flip the tie up , he's right side up . Brilliant . 
 I wouldn't mind having one myself ... 
 OK ! 
 Hi , dear , do you know what the important day is today ? 
 Please think it over . 
 Come on , dear . I know you mustn ’ t forget it . 
 Ur , you really let me down . 
 No , you haven ’ t . You just don ’ t care about me . You ’ re an indifferent husband . 
 It ’ s an anniversary of our weeding . 
 Yes , I want to buy a VCR . 
 No . I only want it to be a very good one . The best.It ' s a graduation gift for my son . 
 Well , he uses our VCR at home.But he's going to university in the Fall , so he needs his own VCR . 
 Yes , he sure does.In fact , he wants to become a movie producer himself.He wants to study film at the university . 
 Please do . 
 Yes , I know that . So I want him to have a good VCR to use . 
 DVD ? Isn't that like a CD ? 
 Why is a DVD better than a VCR ? 
 But isn't it more expensive ? 
 What's that ? 
 And why not ? 
 Hmm . Is that true ? 
 Well . And what about DVDs ? 
 Hmm . He might really appreciate that . I know he will start to collect movies at school . Especially if he studies film . 
 Alright , please show me what you have . 
 You are right . We ’ re hoping that this is a long-term opportunity , and just a flash in the pan . 
 Yes , I did some part-time jobs such as English tutor , salesman , and model . 
 I learned to be patient , professional and gained a ll of experience of direct sales . 
 Okay . Let ’ s clear the air . What are you getting at ? 
 I ’ m sorry . But I don ’ t meant to get your goat . 
 I need to check these books out . 
 Here it is . 
 Really ? 
 How much do I owe ? 
 I don ’ t have that much today . 
 I ’ ll pay it as soon as possible . 
 Good morning . I bought this vacuum here a few months ago . It doesn ’ t work now . Can I return it or get it fixed ? 
 Yes , I do . 
 Four months ago . 
 But the direction book says I will get one-year warranty . 
 Okay . I understand . I ’ ll call the Customer Service Office of the manufacturer . Thank you . 
 I would wondering if you like to stay here for a few days . 
 Until next weekend . that ’ s ok . 
 How do you do ? Nice to meet you , Ms . Smith . I ’ m Jack Stevens from the Marketing Department . Here is my card . 
 Please call me Jack . Have a seat , please . 
 When in Rome , do as the Romans do , they say . 
 They live in Rome , of course , and go to work by car or bus . But sometimes it takes too long that way because of the traffic jams , so they walk . 
 Yes , but they do it differently . Everything is different . 
 Well , the climate's different for a start . It doesn't rain so much as it does in England . The sun shines more often . 
 I know . You hate the rain , don't you ? 
 And a Roman really Ioves life . Eye knows how to enjoy himself . 
 Not always . But they like a good meal . Lots of tourists go to Rome just for the food , you know . 
 I don't know exactly , but it costs a lot of money . 
 Hi , Kathy ! I'm just doing my morning yoga ! You're up awfully early today . 
 How has school been going ? You come home so late every night ! You're really a hard worker ... 
 What bus can I catch to get to the Gold Line ? 
 I live in Altadena . 
 It goes to the Gold Line ? 
 What street do I go to to catch it ? 
 I had no idea that bus went to the station . 
 I'm glad you told me . 
 What's the name of this street ? 
 Do you know of any banks near here ? 
 Is this the right counter to check in for this flight ? 
 Your luggage is overweight . The free allowance for luggage is 20 kilos . 
 OK , in this way it's just below the limit . 
 All right . I will begin boarding soon . 
 Don't you have any luggage to check in ? 
 Do you have a seat preference ? 
 Here is your boarding pass . Have a nice day . 
 Oh , tell him I ’ ll leave them at his office tomorrow afternoon . 
 I ’ m afraid that I can ’ t do that . They ’ re at the printer ’ s being copied . They ’ ll be back tomorrow before 1 o ’ clock . 
 I would like to have an international call to Paris . Can you tell how to do it ? 
 Well , what is the operator's number ? 
 Fine . Thank you . 
 I think we would be able to make it . What time shall we come ? 
 Shall we bring any thing ? Some wine ? 
 Mr . Smith , while you're out , the sales department called and asked you to lunch next Wednesday . 
 Oh , yes , Miss Chen informed that the monthly management meeting has been changed to July 11 and I've marked your diary accordingly . 
 Here is the agenda for the meeting and that's all for the messages . 
 That is a heavy raining afternoon . I was standing under the eaves of a shop to evade the heavy rain . It's getting dark . 
 I was trembling in the wind when he ran to me with an umbrella in his hand and asked , ' Where is your home ? ' 
 Yeah . 
 He joked later that I was so poor that he had a kind of impulse to protect an ant . 
 Sandra is actually blue chipper . I don't think she could realize that she has married a fool for women . 
 I feel sorry for her . 
 I find that you spend little on handset charge every month . Have you any trick ? 
 Is it so simple ? 
 It's true . 
 That's all ? 
 Hi , nice to hear from you , when does your plane leave ? 
 Good . 
 How much does it cost to hire a motorbike ? 
 Good . I think I'll hire one for 7 days . 
 Charlotte , have you had your supper ? 
 Why ? Don't you feel well ? 
 What's up ? 
 You must not feel depressed about such a trivial thing . 
 You'd better shape up if you want to get the job done . 
 Cheer up ! Don't let me down . We all make mistakes , and that is life . 
 Be relaxed . She is familiar with the area . 
 Ok , I'll go out and look for her . 
 yes , I was in my apartment in Beijing . Where were you ? 
 really ? Did you see the hijacked planes crash into and destroy the twin towers ? 
 that must have been horrible . Did you go out at all that day to see what was going on ? 
 did you know anyone who worked in the World Trade Center ? 
 did he survive ? 
 I'm sorry . That must have really been a nightmarish day for you and your family . 
 terrorist acts are deliberate and deadly and can affect every walk of life . 
 My Willie ? Why has he suddenly become my Willie ? 
 What did he do this time ? I remember last time he was painting her fence to repay her for breaking it , and he accidentally painted her cat . 
 Ok , tell me . 
 And the ball went through her window ? That's not as bad as last time . 
 Ok , that's probably expensive , but not that bad . 
 At least the fish were saved . If that's the end of the damages , then everything isn't that bad . 
 Hmm , that is bad . 
 But whenever we play , you just sit on the sand , drink beer , and watch the girls ! 
 To be honest , I don't think you could even win a gold in hopscotch ! 
 Hey ! Ask your mom for more old pictures , OK ? 
 But we saved your parents so much money ... 
 Speaking of plane tickets , don't forget to check on the reservations ! 
 Quite a few people are laid off these days . 
 University graduates have difficulty finding a job too . There seems to be more and more competition in the job market 
 No . Not now . I think I'll try to keep this one . 
 The cereal is over by the breakfast foods . 
 It's by the oatmeal and breakfast bars . 
 Did you need help finding anything else ? 
 That would be over by the paper towels and toilet paper . 
 Yeah , you'll find it there . 
 Hello . Beijing Restaurant . How can I help you ? 
 For pick - up or delivery ? 
 What would you like to order ? 
 That ’ s fine . 
 What size ? 
 When will you come to pick up your order ? 
 That will be fine . We ’ ll have your meals ready when you arrive . Thank you for your order . 
 fantastic ! I got an overall score of eight . 
 yes . I'm just waiting until I officially get admitted to the university with a conditional offer to apply for my visa . 
 no . 
 that's not too far away . Do you think I'll get a visa ? 
 yes , I've been to Tailband , Egypt , and Japan . 
 never . 
 no , I want to come back to China after I graduate . 
 I've received a full scholarship , so I won't need any other money to live off while I'm studying . 
 that's be great . The more prepared I am , the better . 
 What kind of jewellery do you like to have ? 
 May I show you gold ones or jade ones ? 
 OK , here they are . 
 Eight hundred yuan . 
 I'm sorry , we only sell at fixed prices . 
 Do you think that climate change is responsible for the recent floods ? 
 It seems that the climate in this country is changing . 
 I think that the changing climate is a sign that we are causing too much damage to the environment . 
 Me too . If we don ’ t do something soon , It might be too late . 
 Well in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing . The news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises around 80 staff . 
 Well , as you know Rebecca , in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . You could be on call at any time . We do have to work very unsociable hours at times . 
 Good , as long as you understand that . 
 Yesterday ! But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month . 
 It ’ s very kind of you to invite me to dinner . 
 This dish is really delicious . 
 You ’ re great . Could you say it in Chinese ? 
 Why isn't the project done yet ? 
 Do you like the Harry potter books and movies ? 
 Why not ? They are very fun and exiting . 
 No , that ’ s not true . Many adults like the Harry potter books too . 
 Good moming.sir . Here is your breakfast . 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 OK . I will get you some right now . 
 I need to see your ticket . Do you have it ? 
 I'm going to need to see your ID . 
 You can't pay your fine without your ID . 
 We have to make sure that the person issued the ticket is the one paying it . 
 Just come back when you have your ID with you . 
 Only if you pay your fine . 
 You will receive a Notice of Unemployment Insurance Award letter . 
 The Award Letter will tell you how much you will receive weekly . 
 You will need to fill out a Continued Claim Form every two weeks . 
 They will need to know where you worked and how much money you made . 
 Basically , they want to know that you were available for work and not sick . 
 Certainly.Here ’ s an application form.Do you have proof of residence ? 
 A driver ’ s license or something showing that you live in this city . 
 Do you have a current electricity or gas bill in your name ?

 Room Service . May I help you ? 
 Have you switched on the radiator ? 
 We're terribly sorry for that . We'll send our staff io fix it now . Or do you want to change your room ? 
 OK . Is it convenient for us to come now ? 
 It seems that you are an optimistic man who doesn't dismay easily . That is what a good salesman needs . Good luck . 
 I guess we have covered all the stuff that we need to discuss and it's time to say goodbye . 
 I want a refund ! 
 These pajamas don't fit right . They're too long . 
 No . I want my money back . 
 Fine . Here's my receipt . I'd better be able to use this anywhere in the store . 
 How's the chicken ? 
 Yesterday was April the first . 
 Not for the others , but for me . I was in the library going over my lessons when suddenly one of my roommates came in . He told me that I was wanted on the phone in my dormitory , and that person would call me again several minutes later . 
 Yes . I went back to the dorm only to find my roommates laughing and shouting " April Fool , April Fool " . 
 Only then did I realize it was April Fools ' Day . 
 It just isn't on time today . 
 I think it'll be here pretty soon . 
 I really do hate public transportation . 
 That's right . 
 Oh , that's the worst . 
 I completely agree with that . 
 You are going to have a huge bill . 
 Don't you wanna get it fixed now ? 
 Well , if you need anything , just let me know . 
 You sure have bad luck these days . 
 He'll never do well in mathematics . 
 Well , I can't help . 
 Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks . 
 I wish you had been my history teacher ! I might have got better marks ! 
 What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ? 
 I see . I think I ’ d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again . 
 I can't do that , Zina . You know I can't . 
 Who told you that ? 
 May I help you ? 
 Why don ’ t you try looking at the database ? 
 Do we have it available ? 
 I guess it is lost . 
 Yes , we will . 
 I can do that . 
 Excuse me , I'm a little lost . Which bus do I take to get to Shi Da ? 
 Oh ok , where do I get off ? 
 Ok , thanks ... 
 No , is it difficult ? 
 How much does it cost ? 
 Wow , I can't thank you enough . 
 I am going on my first date tonight . Can you give me some suggestions about what to wear ? 
 Yeah , that's a good idea . Let me try it . 
 Do I look more mature in the highheel shoes ? 
 I shall wear light make-up instead of heavy . The face powder will lighten my skin color . 
 Thank you . 
 There are different types . Which one do you like best ? 
 Surely , of course . 
 It's there , near the mirror . 
 OK . 
 I am sorry . There is a speed limit . 
 Hello , can I help you ? 
 How long has it been on for ? 
 You can still drive , without problems . 
 Let's check it out . There'll be a $ 45 charge to check it over . If you fix it with us , we'll include the $ 45 into your repair . 
 Please write down your address and phone number , and sign here . 
 It'll be about an hour . Are you going to wait ? 
 No problem . 
 Good morning , sir ! 
 Thank you , sir . 
 My name is Du Tao , number 3 . 
 Du Tao . D-U for Du and T-A - 0 for Tao . 
 I was born on January 1st , 1988 . I ’ m 20 years old now . 
 I ’ m living at Room 222 , Building 18 , N . P . U . 
 Gladly , 8962105 2 . 
 Yes , madam . May I help you ? 
 Fine , madam . When will Mr . Brent be arriving , and how many nights will he be staying ? 
 Hello . I'm trying to track down some documents due to arrive any day on our new L / C . 
 It's TH 15699324873 0 . 
 Would it be possible to transfer them to IBA Bank ? 
 What's up , buddy ? You look so upset . 
 I'm sorry to hear that . What's your conflict ? 
 Did you think about talking to her again ? Maybe she is waiting for your call . 
 Come on , guy . Maybe she isn't your right person . 
 Fine , thank you , and how are you ? 
 Yes , a very pleasant journey indeed . Thank you . 
 Not bad . The fur market is not very brisk lately , but the selling season is advancing near . I hope there will be more buyers in the market this year . 
 Jenny , you're too lazy . You should do some exercise . See , you're getting fat . 
 That is your excuse . 
 Not just today . Go exercise everyday ! 
 You're right here , bus station , we are in the center of the city . 
 You can take a No . 2 bus here . 
 At Longing Street . 
 You , too . 
 It's my favorite . 
 Are you going to cook anything ? 
 If you're hungry , then cook something . 
 Tell me what you want to eat . 
 I'd like that . 
 I'm really not going to cook tonight . 
 Why don't you start cooking then ? 
 It was fantastic ! We had such a good time . The only problem was that because it was their high season , we spent hours queuing . 
 Yes , Florida had great weather while we were there . You look tan , too . Did you go somewhere ? 
 Wow ! Bali Islands have some of the best beaches in the world , don't they ? 
 Did you go diving while you were there ? 
 Did you take any pictures in the ocean ? 
 Have you started planning your christmas vacation yet ? 
 No , but I do like snowboarding . 
 I'll talk to my husband about it ; I'm sure he'll say yes ! He loves Switzerland ! 
 Look , I've got a problem here . Will you help me ? 
 May I take your order ? 
 The baked fish in tomato sauce is pretty good . 
 Do you want some dessert ? 
 Single or double ? 
 Tom , did you see the film last night ? 
 Do you really think so ? I don't think so . It wasn't that bad film at all . Didn't you hear the applause of the audience ? 
 Well , i don't see the point of arguing this . 
 You bet , as long as I can collect enough money . 
 Aren't you crazy ? 
 Better late than never . 
 In the market . Any problem ? 
 Doctor , may I ask my mother ’ s condition ? 
 Oh my god . Please save her life . 
 I see , D . But I plead you to help her . 
 How long do you expect her to live ? 
 Taxi . 
 Central Park , please , but can you make a stop at Union Square ? I wanna pick up my friend there . 
 How long do you think it will take to get to Union Square . 
 Can you make it in 15 mins . I am already 10 mins late . 
 On the 14th Street side . Oh , we are already at the 16th Street . You are fast . Can you make a left at the next corner ? 
 I think he is around here . Can you slow down ? Ah , there he is . 
 Thank you . How much is it ? 
 Here's $ 15 . Keep the change . 
 Hey , you have been promoted to president of the department . 
 You are so smart . Your efforts in the success of the plan were outstanding . 
 You ’ Ve got a great personality . 
 I believe you will . I ’ m very pleased with your work . Your promotion will contribute to the development of the company . 
 Excuse me . I need to refill this prescription . 
 Yes , I need to refill it today . 
 I was worried about that . I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not . 
 Listen . This is an emergency . I tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . So I can't see him in time . I need this medicine . It is for skin condition . I've run out.Can you just refill it once more ? 
 But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription . 
 But I have a prescription . I just need more of it . 
 Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor.It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor . 
 This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it . 
 Professor , excuse me , but I need to leave early . 
 I am not feeling well . 
 I think I am beginning to have an asthma attack . 
 No , I think that I should just go home because I have some medicine there . 
 I live in the dorms across the street , so I ’ ll be OK . 
 How about your study at college ? 
 Why did you select your college ? 
 What do you like doing in your spare time ? 
 We agree to give you a break on the price , all together a discount of 6 % . Good news is , I talked to my boss , he confirmed that if you take care of the shipping costs , we'll throw in insurance . 
 Now , all this is available to you , as far as you make payment within a 30 day grace period . That shouldn't be a problem , right ? 
 So , if all this is agreeable to you , I'll put it all down on paper and fax a contract to you this afternoon . If you can get a signed version of the contract we've agreed upon back to me by tomorrow morning , we can go ahead and make arrangements to ship the product on Tuesday . 
 Do you have cold medicine ? 
 No , I don't . 
 I have a headache . Is there anything I can buy without a prescription ? 
 I will take the Aspirin then . And have you a small first-aid kit ? 
 I'll take it too . 
 I would like to withdraw my money and close my account please . 
 Here you are . 
 I will be leaving the city soon so I have no need for this account . 
 No problem . I ’ ll wait over there . 
 No , thanks . Coffee makes me wired and I will be nervous enough carrying all that cash . 
 They're so much fun to eat . You can suck all the coating off first ... 
 But that way you're not savoring it . 
 Hey ! The movie hasn't even started and they're almost gone ! 
 I ’ m a doctor . 
 Yes , I do . It ’ s very interesting . What ’ s your job ? 
 Oh , do you enjoy it ? 
 We are through . 
 Why ? Isn't it obvious ? First you impose way too much on me , and I'm tired away . Second , you stood me up on the Valentine's Day . 
 But I ended up with finding out lady that night , that you were with other girl at cafe near your home . 
 You've got so many cousins . I called you later that night . But you didn't have the guts to answer the phone . 
 I don't buy a story . 
 No , don't , I don't want to see you anymore . Don't ever call me again . 
 I'm very worried , doctor 
 I'm afraid that I'm very ill . 
 Because I feel tired all the time , even when I wake up in the morning . I find very difficult to do any work . I have no appetite . My wife cooks me delicious meals but I can only eat a little . 
 Very badly , doctor . 
 Both , doctor . I never get to sleep until two o'clock and I always wake up at five . 
 Well , yes , I am . I'm worried about my work . I've just taken a new job . I earn a lot of money but it's difficult work . I'm always afraid of making a mistake . 
 Yes , doctor . ( The doctor examines the patient ) 
 No , doctor . I never have enough time for exercise . I start work very early in the morning and finish late in the evening . Then I can't get to sleep . Can you give me some medicine to help me to sleep ? 
 But I may lose my job , doctor ! It's hard to get a job like mine . 
 You're right , doctor . It's more important to be healthy than wealthy . I'll change my job . I'm grateful for your advice . 
 The music has started . 
 It's very nice . 
 Certainly . 
 Thanks . I'm glad you say so . Oh , the music has stopped . 
 I ’ d be glad to . Just leave them on my desk . I didn ’ t expect you to finish so soon . 
 Great . Good work . 
 Hello , this is Wang Li . I want to know the status of the position . 
 When can I know whether I'm accepted or not ? 
 I went bungee jumping yesterday . It was so exciting . 
 Yes , They are great fun and very challenging , too . Some day I'll want to try deep-sea diving and rock-climbing , too . 
 Yes . I love facing danger and overcoming it . It has become part of my life . 
 Yes ? Who ’ s calling ? 
 No , that ’ s no problem . I ’ m sorry to hear you ’ re not feeling well . Get some rest . If you need to see a doctor , let me know . 
 Oh , yeah ! He can sit down , roll over , and even play dead . 
 Yup.Hey , do you want to see a picture ? See , he's eating lunch . 
 See , he's wagging his tail . 
 You are late . 
 Couldn't get connection ? 
 Really ? I didn't know . Let me check . You're right . 
 It's a serious problem . I make expecting an important call . The theater is guilty . It supposed to call me this evening , and discuss my play . What were happened if they can't reach me ? 
 Can I borrow one of your pens , Amy ? 
 Has your son started school yet , Tom ? 
 He ’ ll get used to it . They always do . I still remember when my daughter started . Are you going with him on his first day ? 
 Is there any chance to further study ? 
 Do you have training program or plan for employees ? 
 Good morning , Mr Zhang , I wonder whether you have got an answer from your superior . 
 What's the answer ? 
 Let me see . I quoted your delivery in three months , didn't I ? 
 I thought you would be worried about it . So I rang Auckland last night . As you are our biggest customer , they agreed to ship the order on the first vessel available that will leave Auckland next month . 
 By all means . 
 I haver run out of gas . 
 Premium , please . By the way , please don't fill it up . Two gallons will be fine . 
 What else , Ma'am ? 
 Let me show you to the cashier's . It's 905 yuan in total . 
 Oh , it's a service charge . 
 Sorry , but we can't do that . It's store's rule . 
 Yes . 
 Here is the receipt . Wanna to have it wrapped , Ma'am ? 
 It'll be great to have you again . 
 She is so beautiful , isn't she ? 
 Julia Roberts . 
 It's said that her new movie is going to come out . 
 I'm not sure . 
 I already told you , because Julia Roberts is in it . I like her because she is not only a great actor but also is very generous to give a lot to many kinds of charities . 
 OK , so this is our newest machine . It was only installed last year . 
 About 1,500 metres per minute . It's one of the fastest in the world . We had a few problems with it after start-up but it's running very well now . 
 If we're running at full capacity , it's 160,000 tonnes per annum . 
 That's right . 
 Yes , of course . Come in . 
 I have lived here for twenty years . 
 Yes , I have been here since 1976 . 
 Because I have just retired . I want to buy a small house in the country . 
 6850 pound . 
 It's worth every penny of it . 
 Women always have the last word . 
 Don't tell me it affects our flight . 
 Did they say for how long ? 
 So we can't really go anywhere , can we ? 
 I brought some cards . Are you up for a long game ? 
 Yeah.What a surprise ! 
 Fine.thanks . 
 Oh , hi Melissa . Are you going to the conference too ? I was planning to pick up Mr . Campbell . 
 Oh I see , okay . So I heard you got married . Congratulations ! 
 That sounds so romantic ! Jack and I were hoping to get married in Europe next year , but we had to postpone our plans . We just don't have the money ! 
 I sure do . In my opinion , it's actually becoming more expensive than back home . 
 Bill , do you know when did the Chinese begin to celebrate Teachers ' Day ? 
 So , it is the 27th Teachers ' Day . 
 I am going to send Mr . Li some flowers . What about you ? 
 You're going to abandon me , just like that ? 
 I'd like to see a tea set , please ? 
 They're OK , but I prefer chinese ones . 
 Let's do something really nice for our family this Christmas . 
 I don't know yet . 
 I know what you mean . 
 Or do something that shows we have spent time thinking about them . 
 Good morning , mom . 
 I'm still sleepy . 
 No , I couldn't fall asleep last night . 
 “ You ain't nothing ' but a hound-dog ... ” 
 Of course I'm OK ! I just bought a bunch of classic Elvis records ! 
 No sweat . Just go back and talk him down . Here comes Wei . 
 Yeah , we were classmates when I was in university . 
 I would like you to be my lawyer . 
 I ’ m going on trial . 
 It ’ s a felony charge . 
 How much do you charge ? 
 That ’ s highway robbery . 
 Okay . You ’ re hired . 
 Yeah , I had been in the charity organization for 2 months and I learned a lot from that experience , including love , sympathy , equality , and so on . 
 I think it had direct impact on my way of thinking . I learned to look at people and things from an overall perspective . In that case , I am not easy to be edgy . 
 It seems to be . How about you today ? 
 OK , I'll find the time to relax soon . 
 Mike's really angry . 
 You ran into my car . 
 You messed up my car . 
 My rear bumper is messed up . 
 It's smashed in . 
 The same thing is wrong with your bumper . 
 I need your information too . 
 Shall we go to a movie tonight ? 
 Gone with the Wind . 
 Sorry , I've no idea . 
 Great . I ’ ll have a shot . 
 Not yet . What happened ? 
 Yes , I heard the lights were out all night . 
 I don't understand . 
 They really started looting ? 
 Did the looters get caught ? 
 Hopefully we won't have any more blackouts . 
 I'm not feeling well . I think I'm having a cold . 
 Yeah , I will . 
 Yes , it's one of the main air pollutants . Factories don't emit it directly into the air . It's actually formed when nitrogen oxides and VOC emissions come into contact with heat and sunlight . 
 Oh , Vous are ' volatile organic compounds ' . That's a technical term for solvents or other chemicals found in things like paint . 
 Well , it can cause smog , which can affect people's health - especially people with breathing difficulties . 
 Watch your language or you'll be spending the weekend in your room . 
 Good Morning , I have a bad cough , and I want to see an internist . 
 No , I don ’ t . I ' m a tourist . 
 Here you are . 
 I ’ d like to try traditional Chinese medicine . I heard it really works quite well if you know what you're doing . 
 I hate doing the damn laundry . 
 Can I help you ? 
 What style would you prefer ? 
 Do you like this one ? 
 What about this one ? 
 70 yuan . 
 This one is only 50 yuan . 
 All right . 
 Thank you . Anything else ? 
 I'm sorry , but I didn't catch what you said . 
 If you're sure you're not in a hurry , I can use a little help . 
 Do you want to buy something here ? 
 This one is two hundred yuan . 
 Hi , Mark , did you catch the game last night ? 
 You didn ’ t hear ? Spain won , two to zero . 
 Yeah . The final is next week . You have to watch it . 
 I want to know about fees . 
 Overdraft fees . 
 How much is the fee ? 
 That ’ s a small fee ? 
 You would think it would , but it most likely won ’ t . 
 That ’ s it for today . Thank you . 
 I like orange better . 
 Because orange is much more to my taste . 
 Off campus or on campus ? 
 Why don't you park in the parking structure for students ? 
 It's on the west side of the campus . 
 It was empty last time I went up there . 
 I went up there early this morning . 
 It might be . You'll have to go see for yourself . 
 Yes . May I help you ? 
 Yes . 
 Nice to meet you , John . 
 Could I have a refund on this ? 
 Then can I exchange it for something else with the same price ? 
 OK . I will . 
 Yes . I had a bad traffic accident.Look , my car looks like a squashed coke can . 
 No , I didn't . That car was too fast . 
 I don't remember . 
 40 miles per hour . 
 Just straight . 
 No , I didn't get hurt . Thanks for your concern . 
 Well it ’ s my first night in Beijing . What should I eat ? 
 Mm , I don ’ t really like duck to be honest with you . I fancy something light . 
 That sounds like a good idea . Where should I go to eat that ? 
 Ok then , I ’ ll follow you . 
 What does she like to do ? 
 Sounds like she has pretty pricy tastes . 
 Have you thought about going in Dutch ? 
 Not where , what . Dutch means you both pay your own way . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 OK , let me see . This white shirt can be washed in water with hands , but this suit and the woolen sweater should be dry-cleaned . 
 Yes , the cost for dry-cleaning is three times of that for ordinary laundering . But for suits and sweaters , you can only take them to the dry cleaners ' . 
 Did it ever shrink or fade ? Generally speaking , the dark-colored clothes always fade away gradually . 
 Never mind . You can leave them to me . 
 It's very simple . Divide the clothes by the colors , and wash them in cold water . If you've got some special stains on them like sugar , coffee or something else please let the dry cleaner know . 
 That will be 80 Yuan altogether . Here is your invoice . 
 They're going skiing in Colorado . 
 You're probably right . Oh , what the heck ! I'll take it all ... in maroon , like you said . 
 Yeah , what's the matter now ? We've had so much trouble with this case already . Don't tell me there's more bad news . 
 What ? What does that mean ? Why won't there be any results ? 
 Oh , no , you can't be serious . I never expect anything like this would happened . What are we going to do ? 
 Why aren't you going out ? 
 Would you like to come out with me tonight ? 
 Tomorrow night , then ? 
 I ’ m wondering if you like to go to the theatre then . 
 Ok . How about give me a ring , then ? 
 Why not ? 
 Yo , G.How are you getting along with your classmates in the English training school ? 
 So , what's on the menu for dinner tonight ? 
 You're not going to make anything to eat ? 
 I think you're a better cook than I am . 
 So you're telling me that you want me to make dinner ? 
 I'll cook dinner , don't worry . 
 I'll come wake you when it's ready , okay ? 
 Where is your dressing room ? 
 ( Person A comes out of the dressing room ) How did you like the sweater ? 
 Great . I can ring you up over here . It comes to $ 87.04 . 
 Do you have a credit card with us ? 
 If you open up a card , you can save 10 % on all your purchases today . 
 No problem . We always have this offer , so when ever you decide to , just let us know . 
 Is there anything else I can help you with ? 
 Yes . It cost $ 7 , and it takes one day . 
 Thank you , and have a great day . 
 It would be good for both if they lived separately . My parents want to live apart from us . 
 Young people ought to carry out their responsibilities . If it's needed , they would live with their parents . 
 You need a child first , and that's your duty , too . 
 I'm afraid I've a complaint to make , which is about the goods we ordered last week . 
 I will explain the problem briefly . We found in the examination that 35 % of the goods have damaged . 
 Here's the survey report issued by the China Commodity Inspection Bureau . According to the report , the damage was caused by poor packing . Our surveyors also discovered some cracks on the surface of a number of other cases . 
 Please look into the matter and solve the problem immediately . 
 it's a lovely day , isn't it ? 
 is she American ? 
 so I take it you two are hitting it off ? I know it's very convenient to be in a relationship with your neighbor , but what if you break up ? 
 sounds like you've got some competition . You made a move already ? 
 that's nice . Having been here a little while surely gives you the advantage , eh ? 
 good luck ! 
 Hi . I need more amenities , please . 
 Well , to be more specific , the free stuff , like soap , lotion , and shampoo . 
 Oh , no ! I've got all I need for my stay here . 
 I need souvenirs ! 
 Yes , yes . Souvenirs . 
 That's not the same thing . If you buy hotel souvenirs , they have no sentimental value . 
 I noticed your absence in class this morning . 
 Which team has won ? 
 But I still think AC milan's defence seems better organized . 
 Mary , why don't you come to my house this Saturday ? 
 Come on , Mary . This is America . You make your own decisions here . 
 Of course . 
 It's 555-4321 . 
 They are playing the wedding march , and I have felt tears . 
 Really ? I have seen that our wedding , but just mary's . 
 You are always be the most beautiful one in the world . What is the bridemaid's name ? 
 Don't be so sensitive , just a casual question , I caught you looking at the groomsman 
 I wonder why he is chosen to be the groomsman , and why mary doesn't marry him since he's much more attractive . 
 Administer is doing a good job . I'm not sure they'll be as happy as we are . 
 Let's have a look . What is this ? Where are all the grades ? 
 What about here in physical education ? 
 So confusing ! In my day we got an A or B if we were doing well and if we failed an exam we would get an F ! 
 How about an outlet ? 
 Outlets give good deals . 
 You're welcome . 
 $ 135 . 
 I'm sorry , sir.The price is fixed . 
 Bucharest , Romania . 
 Here you are . 
 Pleasure . I'm visiting my relatives . 
 Three weeks . 
 I work as an accountant for a Romanian telecommunications company . 
 Yes , here it is . 
 Thank you . 
 You can say that again . Susan ’ brother dropped in from out of town , so I offered to put him up for a few days . But he ’ s driving me up a wall . This guy is bottomless pit . 
 He doesn ’ t lift a finger ! I bend over backwards cleaning up all day and he sleeps in until noon . 
 You think he might stay even longer ? ! 
 That wouldn ’ t be a lie ! 
 I'm looking for an engagement ring for my girlfriend . I have an idea of what she likes , but I want to surprise her with something special , too . 
 I think so . Aren't the four Cs , cut , clarity , carat and color . 
 Well , my price range is a 5,000 dollars to 7,000 dollars , I'm looking for a marquise cut on the wide band . 
 Hi . How can I help you ? 
 Yes , we are . What position are you looking for ? 
 I ’ m sorry . The application for this position has closed . 
 We have only one position open . 
 Gas Meter Reader . This is a wonderful job for the right person , regular hours , no night shifts , no supervisor behind you , and good pay . 
 Sure . 
 Yes . The two sides declared a short ceasefire but it broke down earlier today . Several military target were destroyed by bombing . Many civilians were among the dead and wounded . 
 Bout side claim a small area of territory . Both sides tried to build border fences and began attacking each other . 
 Relief agencies report that many civilians are in desperate need of food and shelter . Several European countries have agreed to send aid , but are afraid that their planes will be shot down . 
 Both countries are very poor . Soon they will run out of money to finance the war . Then , perhaps , they will negotiate . 
 Tom . Please do not disturb me for the next hour . 
 Yes , and I don't want to be interrupted . 
 You're looking rather pale , why ? 
 You'd get plenty of sleep for you work so hard . 
 You shan't drink more wine in the evening . 
 And you'd take some exercise every day . 
 When could we meet to discuss the project ? 
 I prefer Monday . 
 Either one is OK . 
 I will be prepared to do my presentation . 
 Everyone needs to be there . 
 I think I know where it is . Maybe you could send me directions just to make sure . 
 What do you think of the apartment ? 
 What problem is that ? 
 I don ’ t understand what the big deal is . 
 What you would like me to do about it ? 
 I won ’ t be able to fix it at the moment . 
 If that ’ s the case , then I will fix the faucet . 
 Good afternoon . I come here specially to pick up my tickets . I booked it last month.This is my reservation note . 
 But I have been so busy all these days.Well , is there any other ticket available ? I want the next one . 
 That's OK . 
 Fine . If you'll excuse me , I'd like to go it over first . ( After about 15 minutes ) Hmm , you've done a pretty good job . It's well prepared . 
 Well , I suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time . 
 First , let's read Clause Two about packing . It's our usual practice to ship our products in containers . That'll save time and money , but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases . So , we'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract . 
 For shipment , you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it won't all be finished at one time . So would you allow us to make partial shipments . 
 Hey , sorry to be late . 
 My mother was ill . I had to look after her . 
 May I have a cookie ? 
 Can you direct me to some fresh produce that's on sale ? 
 Mangoes ? What are mangoes ? 
 Can you eat the seed ? 
 Well , how much are they ? 
 Can you describe their taste ? 
 How can I tell if they're ripe ? 
 Where do they grow mangoes ? 
 Come in and sit down , Jack.Now , what's the trouble ? 
 I see.When did it start ? 
 Have you got a temperature ? 
 Let's see.Yes.You ' Ve got quite a high temperature . 
 Hm .. I think you ' Ve got the flu . 
 No , not at all , but you must stay in bed for three days and take this medicine . 
 Three times a day after meals . 
 do you have any plans for dinner tonight ? 
 I was thinking maybe we could make dinner together tonight . What do you think ? 
 I could teach you how to cook something healthy . Frozen pizza are so bad for you ! 
 I recently saw a piece for spicy chicken curry in a magadize . Maybe we could try that ? 
 I bought all the ingredients this morning , so let's start ! 
 first , you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces . 
 yes . Once it gets hot , put a little oil in it , add the vegetables and stir-fry them for a few minutes . 
 that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stir-fried on its own until its cooked through . 
 I'll prepare it . Do you prefer white rice or brown rice ? 
 It's time to graduate and it's time to find a job . Susan , why do we need to find a job ? 
 But you know it's hard for a new graduate to find a god job right now . 
 I've been fed up with study . 
 Oh , my . Why there are still so many things to learn after graduation ? 
 How do I look in this new dress ? 
 How about this one ? 
 Our factory locates at a village in the east of the city . The area of it is 3,600 square meters .

 We established the strict QC standards and we have followed it for about five years with good results . 
 Most of them live in the city . We provide free commuter buses for the workers . Besides , we built the dormitory building for the workers on night shift . 
 Albert and I need a lot of things to furnish our house.But I don't know where the best place to shop is . Can you give me some advice ? 
 Well , we have most of the furniture already.We mostly need kitchen utensils , bathroom accessories , cleaning and laundry accessories--things like that.And Albert wants to set up a little off 
 Can I write that down ? 
 Thanks . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Probably good prices . You know we will only be in America for about a year . 
 What are those stores ? 
 Even silverware ? 
 I have a friend that said something about a place called Price Club.Do you know about that ? 
 What does that mean ? 
 Electronics ? 
 How much is the membership fee ? 
 I see . Thanks for these tips . We really need to buy a lot of little things . 
 Hello , welcome to IBA . What can I do for you ? 
 We certainly do . May I ask you the purpose of the rental ? 
 I see . We have various rental periods . How long would you like to rent it for ? 
 You can choose a short-term or yearly rental . 
 There are some things I miss . But I love Chinese food.And I think the people in Taiwan are really hospitable.Besides , I grew up in Los Angeles , so I'm used to living in crowded places.Why are you going to America ? 
 Why ? 
 Don't worry about it.Your sister lives there . She probably knows the places in town you shouldn't go.It ' s true there are some dangerous places in big American cities.But if your sister lives there , she must know the city pretty well already . 
 Don't believe what you see on TV . You will have a good time in New York.What things do you want to see ?

 Can you tell me why you like it ? 
 Hi , I'm home ! Can you double that recipe ? I ran into an old friend after work and invited him for dinner . 
 I don't think so . Do you remember Bob Gain from Tulsa ? 
 He was on the diving team with me in high school and saved my life one day . 
 You're glad he saved me , huh ? 
 Jim , I heard you ’ Ve bought a new computer . 
 Your office looks different with a computer . By the way , is it difficult to use a computer ? 
 A piece of cake ? 
 How can I tell her about this ? 
 There is no need to be so frustrated . 
 Don't worry , you'll find a way . 
 I know . I know . I don ’ t smoke too much , though . 
 About a pack , more if I drink . 
 No , I ’ m not . My father smoked two packs a day for forty years . 
 Yeah ... you ’ re right . I really should stop smoking . 
 Have you taken your driving test yet ?

 Generally speaking , job seekers can enter the websites either of job agencies or of some units for job advertisements . 
 You can e-mail your application materials for application to the websites of job agencies for enrollment in their database . 
 Yes , usually it takes a short time , but you have to await the choice of the units for a while . 
 $ 10 per person . 
 Turn to the next window and they will help you find one .

 Is there a cheaper bus pass ? 
 For how much ? 
 It's absolutely free ? 
 How much is that ? 
 Let me get the student bus pass . 
 Have you finished washing clothes ? 
 Well , when you do your darks , can you wash some of mine too ? 
 They need to be washed on the gentle cycle . 
 There aren't many clothes , is your load big ? 
 If it's a problem , you don't have to do it for me . 
 I greatly appreciate this . 
 Have you bought your bus pass yet ? 
 Well , why not ? 
 You should've just asked me . 
 You can get it from the student business office . 
 I know you didn't . 
 No problem . 
 Um , hello again . Are you sure you don't want to make a purchase , sir ? 
 Hush ... OK . What is it ? 
 What kind of question is that ? 
 Uh ... yeah , right ... 
 Sure . What time do you want to go ? 
 That sounds good . Today we work on Legs and forearm . 
 I'm on a weekly schedule . You're messing everything up . 
 Aright . I'll meet you at the gym at 3:30 then . 
 Yes , a very long time . 
 I'm here on vacation . 
 Yes , I ’ m off to the department store . I must buy some furniture for my new flat . 
 Ok . Thanks for that information . 
 Ok , do they have a delivery service ? 
 Ok , I ’ ll see you later . 
 There is nothing good at the moment.Let ' s do something different.Would you like to go to a concert ? 
 Fine ! Do you want anything to eat now ? 
 Well , let's go and have something to drink instead . I know a good place . It's a little expensive , but it's fun . 
 Yes ? 
 About half an hour , if there's no traffic jam . 
 I doubt it . It's not rush hour . 
 Hello , this is Mary from the Taipei new station , what can i do for you ? 
 Hi , Mr Wang , who do you wish to speak to ? 
 Davids who , we have 5 Davids in the office . 
 Please hold on a minute , offer your call to Mr Richton . 
 You are welcome . 
 So ? 
 I know . But this year I want to get him an interesting tie . Like this one . 
 It's perfect ! It's a Dilbert tie ! 
 But watch this ... it bends upwards , just like Dilbert's tie . There's a wire inside . 
 You heard who won the election , didn ’ t you ? 
 I ’ m so happy that he did . 
 Did you vote for him ? 
 Of course I did ! 
 I am , too ! 
 I ’ m sure that he will . 
 I think you're being a little naive . 
 That proves my point ! Protect yourself or you'll get burned . 
 $ 200 ? If they get a hold of your credit card number , you're going to be out a lot more than $ 200 ! I had a friend who ... 
 What kind of currency do you want ? 
 That's 680 Yuan . 
 Here it is . 
 You just missed one . 
 In an hour . 
 No , they come every hour on the hour . 
 You are welcome . 
 Gatorade . It ’ s rich in Vitamin and it gives us energy and vitality . 
 What should we do , now with Jack out of the game ? 
 That ’ s right . Spraining the ankle and breaking the leg are the common things during the match . 
 That ’ s for sure . During the back court , we should change the position we played . 
 I agree with you . I think we ’ ll play much better than before . 
 Yeah , look how passionate they are ! Are they professional ? 
 Oops ! I almost forget about it . Do you see the girl in the middle of the first line ? 
 Don ’ t you think she looks like your daughter ? 
 Good morning ! May I help you ? 
 Do you want a furnished house or an unfurnished one ? 
 Very well . How long do you want the house ? All summer ? 
 I'm afraid I can only rent it for two months . 
 Yes , it is . It was just painted and it has all the modern conveniences . 
 Yeah , I really got a lot of the session . The workshop topic was resolving personal problems . It was led by a professional human resources director . The teacher had a lot of experience , and I think we were all given a really good base to start with . 
 It depends on the topic , the teacher , and the way the course is set up . Yesterday , even though we only had a short time to discuss the issues , the workshop got us all thinking . We learned some very basic , but very useful methods of dealing with personnel issues . 
 I did ... I just hope I can implement all these great ideas that we shared . 
 You haven't told me anything yet . 
 Is that right ? 
 Congratulations on your promotion . 
 I am really excited for you . 
 I'm serious . You deserved this promotion . 
 Yes , I do . 
 I ’ d like to speak to marked Baker , please . 
 Yes , tell him Mr . Cook called and ask him to return my called as soon as he back . 
 Thank you for coming so quickly . 
 A pipe in my apartment is leaking . 
 The pipe is in my bathroom . 
 The pipe has been leaking for a couple days . 
 Yes , I ’ m aware of that . 
 I just need the problem fixed . 
 How much did you pay for the TV ? 
 200 bucks for a piece of junk like that ? That's a ripped-off . 
 It's not worth it . 
 How much did you bid ? 
 We'll see how much fun it is after they take all your money ! ! 
 What if he had his friends fake the reviews ? 
 May I have 5 tokens ? Here is the money . 
 I am going to the Central Park . Which train should I take ? 
 Thank you . 
 Yes . Which one is the latest ? 
 It's my style . Will it be resistance to balling ? 
 Do you have coffee shops in China , too ? 
 You like to go to these places , don ’ t you ? 
 Do you often go there alone ? 
 What time's your flight ? 
 I really need to apply for a driving permit . 
 I may have left my ID in my car . 
 I'll go get it really quick . 
 Here it is . 
 I need to use a pen .

 Thank you . I will . 
 I'd rather have a cup of coffee . 
 Yes , please . Milk and two sugar . 
 What kind are you going to make ? 
 I really like Caesar salads . 
 What kind of salad do you want to make ? 
 I love chicken salads . 
 That sounds really tasty . 
 I think that I will . 
 I am afraid not . We usually design the label ourselves . You know we should be responsible for the brand labels of our goods . 
 What are they ? 
 That can be easily done . Is there anything else ? 
 We'll get the factory to meet your requirements . 
 Well , it was nice meeting you . 
 Sure , I'll give you a call . 
 Look at this fair . This is my first chance to be involved in the fair . It is so gorgeous and amazing ! 
 Now we should design our booth . Do you know the number for our booth , B ? 
 Lucky number . Find its location now . 
 Here it is . Well , remember to have our cards on to tell every visitor where we come from . 
 Yes , they should be put in the most attractive place , and this can appeal to passers-by's attention . 
 Yes . That would be nice . When do you want to go ? 
 Sorry , I can't go today . 
 Ok . What time ? 
 I think that's too late . 
 Yes , that's good . Where would you like to go ? 
 Oh , I don't like that Restaurant . I don't want to go there . 
 OK , I like that place . 
 I need to return a book . 
 I would also like to check out this video . 
 Yes , just the video . 
 Here you go . 
 Oh , I will . 
 I understand . Thank you very much . 
 Certainly ! How much are you planning to spend on dinner , sir ? 
 May I suggest our own hotel restaurant ? It got three stars in the latest restaurant review . 
 There's always Gramercy Tavern . They have live jazz . The food is delicious , but very expensive . 
 As you wish , sir . You'll have a wonderful time there . 
 Of course , I have Monday or Tuesday available . What day would be best for you ? 
 Very well then . Are mornings or afternoons best ? 
 I will have my assistant check my calendar and get back to you with the exact time . Can you bring me an outline of the project when you come ? 
 Do you think that we should include the entire committee in the meeting or just our sub-committee ? 
 OK then , I will make the arrangements for them to attend . Do you know how to get there ? 
 Fine , we will make sure that we send you all of the information that you need . See you there ! 
 Good morning , sir . 
 Right here , how can i help you today , sir ?

 How much should I pay ? 
 Here is $ 50 . Keep the change , please . 
 How can I help you ? 
 Do you have an appointment ? 
 I wonder if Mr . Smith forgot your meeting . I am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until after 4 pm . Let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place . Will you please have a seat ? 
 Yes , Mr . Mason , I just checked with our office manager , Ms . Terry , she said Mr . Smith briefed her on your project . She is just finishing up a meeting now . She could be with your shortly . Would you like me to show you around while you are waiting ? 
 Right this way , Mr . Mason . We can start with our front office . When Ms . Terry is ready , you may take the elevator at the front to the 6th floor . There is a conference room already prepared 
 Hi , Peter . I didn't see you last night . Where did you go ? 
 Did you play network games the whole night ? 
 What are you going to do now ? 
 Hello , thank you for taking the time to interview me . 
 Your assistant gave wonderful directions . 
 Our Company is moving overseas and I wish to stay in the United States . 
 I am good at organizing systems that have been having problems . 
 I don ’ t like to sit around and so like to always find things to do to keep myself busy . 
 Mrs . Smith , you are always worried about your children . 
 That ’ s human nature . 
 Yes . My house is far away from here . May I ask for an apartment ? 
 That ’ s great . If you don ’ t mind my asking , does your company give bonuses ? 
 Oh , just one more thing , could you give me some idea about holidays ? 
 No problem . 
 OK . 
 Hey man ! Everything is just groovy baby ! 
 I wanted to , but I ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block ! I was chatting her up a bit and then we mellowed out at her place . 
 Gravy ! Jim is such a jive turkey man . He is always hitting me up for cash . Anyway , you wanna book and go grab some grub ? 
 You look great today . And so beautiful . I love your elegant haircut . 
 We have some quality-control problems . Mr . Zhang . We need to go to the source to work them out . 
 The complaint rate for our new product line is very high , almost eight percent . 
 Yes . We keep finding problems when testing the sound boards . 
 The least expensive , but still fully functional . And we think that your factory needs to take measures to improve quality-control . 
 I am afraid that is not acceptable . Your contract says that you will deliver a product with a reject rate of less than six percent . 
 So Vicky , how long have you held your present position ? 
 And how do you like working for IBM ? 
 What ’ s strength do you bring to the job ? 
 That ’ s good . We always need team players here . 
 Nervous ? Why ? 
 Don't worry . You don't have to do anything.All you have to do is listen . You will enjoy it . 
 Listen , Ryan.Catholics welcome people who aren't Catholics to visit the church.You don't have to pretend to be Catholic . It's okay if you just come to listen . 
 Yes . We are kind and welcoming people.It is not a secret society or something like that . 
 Yes , but you don't even have to sing . If you want to sing along , you can . 
 There is a songbook . All the words are in the songbook.Many people have to read the words . 
 No . That is something only true Catholics do.So if you come to the church as a visitor , you only listen to the service.But you shouldn't go up to the altar for the bread and wine.Only after someone joins the church , then they go up for the Eucharist . 
 That is the special word for the ritual of the bread and wine.The Catholics call it the Eucharist . 
 It's not . It's an ancient Greek word . It means gratitude . 
 Of course you are . I wouldn't ask you otherwise . 
 I'm sorry , that's bad luck . 
 You're right . We're not really into used stuff . 
 There aren't many places that sell used things in Taiwan , besides auction websites . 
 Great ! I can teach you men a thing or two about shopping ! 
 That ’ s really unbearable . 
 So get prepared for everything . 
 OK , which car do you want me to put them in ? 
 Which one is hers ? 
 What should I take first ? 
 Don't worry , I won't drop it . Wow , it's really heavy . I don't think I can move it by myself . 
 Where are you taking all this stuff ? 
 You're moving now ? I knew you were moving , but I thought you said you were moving next month . 
 Where are you going , Jane ? 
 I saw her yesterday.She was a little better . 
 No , you needn't . A number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital . 
 Yes . I caught a number 7 bus yesterday , and they said I had taken a wrong bus . 
 But number 13 buses leave from the center of town.You ' ll have to walk two miles to catch one . 
 Hmm . I see what you mean . Have you spoken with Roger ? He usually does better work than this . 
 All right . Leave these ads with me . I ’ ll speak to him this morning . 
 A one-way ticket to Chicago , please . 
 One adult , please . 
 You know who won the election , right ? 
 I couldn ’ t believe it , either . 
 I hope you voted for him . 
 I made sure to vote for him . 
 I know how you feel . 
 I know that he will . 
 May , is this the Hall of Ancient China ? 
 Why are they all in glass boxes ? 
 So there isn't air in the glass boxes ? 
 I wonder how old these things are , thousands of years ? 
 Hey , look at the three-leg cup . I've seen it on TV . 
 Yeah , it has no value at all . Who will use this cup today ? 
 Oh , it does ? 
 I am swapped with work after 10 - day holiday . 
 I went to Paris . 
 You say how high can be exciting ? 
 I know that Frenchmen installed the Bungee cord between two tall buildings . 
 Luckily there is no such kind of ' grown-up ceremony ' any more . 
 Only English . 
 I have passed CET - 6 and I am proficient in reading and translating foreign materials . I have rich translating experience because I used to be an English translator . 
 I have received an oral English training and I can communicate with others fluently . 
 Yes , I did . I got 600 in TOEFL and 2 , 300 in GRE . 
 I started to learn English when I was in primary school . 
 The amount of English I know enables me to do general desk work . I believe the amount of English I know is sufficient to work in a South Korea firm . 
 No , I haven't . 
 I have been studying . 
 Do you know if it costs any money to take it ? 
 All right . Do you know if the test covers the whole book ? 
 Did you pass it the first time that you took it ? 
 Well , I hope that I do well . 
 I feel kind of stupid . 
 We got lost coming back . I guess I don't really know this town yet . 
 No . We took a wrong turn somewhere.And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions.But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost . 
 I know I could have . But finally we asked someone where we were . 
 Guess where we ended up . 
 When we finally decided to ask someone , they told us we were in Grangerfield . 
 I don't know.The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here . 
 I know it is . I don't know how it happened . 
 What ? 
 How ? 
 Oh , that's what you think , huh ? 
 You know what , Trish ? 
 I hope so . I really hope so . 
 No , I wasn't . It's kind of hard to watch the road when Joseph is behind the wheel . 
 Yes . 
 No problem . What should I bring ? 
 Would you please show me the necklace in the window ? 
 No , the one next to it . 
 Thanks . What kind of stone is this ? 
 Yes , please . How much is it ? 
 It looks good . OK . I'll take it . 
 Yes , Mary ? 
 Oh . I'm sorry but I just accepted another offer which I feel is better suited to my needs . 
 I really appreciate the offer , but I must decline it . 
 I will , good luck . 
 You do realize that you ran a red light , don't you ? 
 You didn't see the red light ? 
 Didn't you learn that red means stop ? 
 Then tell me why you sped up on the yellow light . 
 I'm giving you a ticket for this . 
 Maybe you'll think about this before you decide to run another light . 
 You don ’ t have to eat them . I don ’ t mind . 
 No dessert for you unless you eat all of your vegetables . 
 You can have some fruits for dessert.If you eat an apple and a banana , I might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake . 
 I'll remember that for next time.You ’ ll get extra peas and carrots , but no broccoli or cauliflower , ok ? 
 Are you sure you heard right ? 
 I don't believe you . 
 What's the weather like in your city ? 
 The summer temperature usually often reaches about 20 or25 in my city.the rain falls mostly in the winter.and we often get snow . 
 In winter temperature often falls to zero at night temperature can be below that.the streets are often icing in the morning.with high such temperatures you must get some thunderstorms . 
 We do have a few foggy days in winter.but i would not say we have a lot of fogs.the sky are usually clearly over your city , are they ? 
 Have you ever had snow in your city ? 
 The river in my city sometime freeze over.people go ice-skating on it.on summer people go boating on the river.but few people go swimming because it is not very clean . 
 Excuse me . would you lend me some wreckers 
 Until Monday or Tuesday next week . 
 And lightweight , too . It'll play for 20 hours on two AA batteries ! 
 And they're really safe . They'll protect your ear from sound damage . 
 I know . And you can also hear outside noises while you listen to music . 
 Martin . 
 Great , thanks . What ’ s up ? 
 May I help you ? 
 Yes , is there a problem ? Ma ’ am ? 
 Have you given the puppies anything to eat today ? 
 Great ! Could you please bathe them later ? 
 Thank you ! Remember that they go to the vet this Saturday . 
 We need to have them there at 11 
 You still have not given me those files I ’ Ve asked you for . 
 I really don ’ t want to hear your excuses , Janet . We ’ re running a busy office here . You ’ re going to have to keep up . 
 Ladies and Gentlemen , this is the Statue of Liberty . It's one of the American symbol . 
 The statue has for a century acted as a figurehead for the American Dream . 
 Of course you can . 
 I traveled the Three Gorges . 
 Yes , we had a good time . The trip was terrific . We toured the Three Gorges by boat . Its realty exciting ! 
 Yes . There are many places where the gorge is very narrow , with steep cliffs on both sides . 
 Yes , but we have life jackets . And we got a real kick out of that . 
 Give me some glasses please , Jane . 
 No , not those . The ones on the shelf . 
 Yes , please . 
 Thanks . 
 Yeah , I ’ m going for a hike in the southern Rocky Mountains . 
 I go as much as I can . I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature . 
 Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ? 
 Wow ! You must have been pretty far away from the city . 
 Well , bring him along too . We ’ ll have a great time this weekend . 
 Which school are you attending ? 
 When will you graduate from that university ? 
 What degree will you receive ? 
 What is your major ? 
 How have you been getting on with your studies so far ? 
 How do you think the education you've received will contribute to your work in this institution ? 
 Here comes the birthday cake . 
 Be sure to blow out all the candles in one puff . 
 Yes , but I doubt if I get it . I've never get it . 
 That's right . Once the contract with Stars.com is final , we'll deal with Zina . 
 Don't jump the gun . She's in the driver's seat right now . You have to be patient . 
 Settle down , Elvin . If you're not careful , you'll give our plan away . Zina's smart , you know . 
 I am worried about that Arden will display all my drawbacks in the performance review . That will be embarrassing . 
 I had a nightmare last night and I dreamt Arden told me that my performance fell short of his expectation . I was terrified to wake up after hearing that . 
 I know what you are talking about . The performance evaluation process starts from the day we're hired . There is no surprise during the actual review . 
 On the contrary , I think he's very serious . 
 So they're easy to remember . 
 He's an old antique , very serious . 
 Hey ! How about your history teacher ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . 
 All right.Which kind do you prefer ? 
 That's fine . 
 Hi , Sean . It ’ s Mary in Mr . Emory ’ s office . I placed an order for 1,000 bound copies of a staff manual last week . 
 Well , I was hoping you would do me a big favor . That was supposed to be a rush order , I forgot to tell you . I ’ m getting a lot of flak from my boss . 
 Thanks . It's a lot better than mine , and it's new . 
 We're going to visit my sister in the city . 
 About a year ago . She lives in an apartment on 3rd street , across from the public library . 
 Oh , we're not driving . We're going to take the subway . The subway only takes about 20 minutes . 
 I take the subway to work everyday , so I'm used to it now . 
 Yes , she's lived there for about ten years . 
 I know what you mean . It's hard to find anything that's reasonable now . 
 See you later . 
 Sure , let ’ s take a look . Sweetie , this is terrific . Your ideas are so original . 
 I can tell you worked hard on it . 
 Well , it was definitely worth all the time . 
 Is this the counter to pick up parcels ? 
 I want to pick up my parcels . 
 OK . Here you are . 
 Thank you . 
 Let's start out to discuss the question of payment terms . 
 I fully understand your position . An irrevocable letter of credit ensures that the seller gets paid in time . But , on the other hand it would add to the buying costs . We've been , after all , trading partners for 3 years and you know us well . Can't you give us D / A or D / P ? 
 But on our part , our government is reluctant to approve of L / C payment for our imports . And there is the licensing problem . 
 Let's get together this weekend , is that all right ? 
 When is it convenient for you ? 
 Could you and your wife be ready at nine o'clock ? 
 Never mind . I'll be waiting for you . 
 OK . Bye ! 
 Yes . Are you going to be taking a class from him ? 
 He is very interesting and challenging . Is that what you are looking for ? 
 He is really clear on what you need to learn to get a good grade . Are you willing to study hard ? 
 What I really liked about him is that he was an understanding and friendly teacher . Do you enjoy that in a teacher ? 
 Did you know that he has 20 years teaching experience ? 
 Well , take a look at everything and figure out what is best for you . Good luck ! 
 Your dream comes true now . 
 You are really confident . 
 Yes , but I don ’ t think it was enough . He looked disappointed . I gave him three dollars . 
 It ’ s the same in Balloon . But I definitely think we over-tipped the cab driver . The fare was twenty dollars , and you gave him a five-dollar tip . That ’ s twenty-five percent of the total ! Too much ! 
 I ’ ll sign for dinner and charge it to our room.Let ’ s see.The bill is one hundred dollars . That seems reasonable . How much tip should I leave ? 
 Lucy , take my picture here , OK ? 
 What's the matter ? 
 Is it broken ? 
 What is it ? 
 Where can we get batteries ? 
 OK . Let's take a walk and look for a shop that does . 
 NO ! 
 Okay , okay , what do you want ? 
 Um .. I don ’ t think so . I need the car tonight to pick up your mother . 
 Who's this Eric guy ? 
 No can do ... sorry . 
 No way ! 
 I haven ’ t seen you in a while . How have you been ? 
 Well , I ’ m hanging in there , but I lost my job and need to find another one quickly . 
 I am just trying to find something that will pay the bills until this bad economy passes by . 
 No , I haven ’ t been out on one interview yet . 
 I think that I might be interested in that position . 
 Are you ready to order ? 
 And for your entree ? 
 May , do you mind helping me prepare for the picnic ? 
 Yes . It says it will be sunny all day . No sign of rain at all.This is your father's favorite sausage . Sandwiches for you and Daniel . 
 Okay . Please take some fruit salad and crackers for me . 
 All set . May , can you help me take all these things to the living room ? 
 Ask Daniel to give you a hand ? 
 What a lovely day . The sun is shinning and the sky is so blue . It's a perfect day to go to the beach and get a beautiful tan . 
 Come on . Getting a tan symbolizes health and wealth in western countries . 
 That is a really interesting fact . 
 Just do whatever you feel like doing . 
 Good idea . It is always cooler in a shade . 
 Hi , Bob ! How are you doing ? 
 I'm fine too , thank you . 
 With the greatest pleasure.Where is the concert this evening ? 
 What's on the program ? 
 Excuse me . What should be included in my CV ? 
 What kind of personal information ? 
 Would you mind if I make a suggestion ? 
 Maybe you should try to quit smoking . You know it is very bad for your health . 
 You have made a big progress . Quitting smoking is not an easy job . But it will be rewarding in the long run . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 On the fourth Thursday of November . 
 People cook turkeys for Thanksgiving dinner . 
 Besides the turkeys , we'll also have other delicious food . Such as pumpkin pies , puddings , mashed potatoes , bread , a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables . 
 Do you know who that tall man is ? 
 Why ? 
 Let me hold the door for you , miss . 
 May I help you ? 
 You are Miss Liu ? 
 Please take a seat . 
 We have received your letter and resume , and we thought we would like to ask you to come here for an interview . 
 Have you brought your credentials ? 
 Hello , can I help ? 
 I have it right here . 
 No , you can take it away now . I just need you to sign here . 
 Just one thing before you go , could you please prepare your documents in accordance with the L / C within the validity period ? 
 Did you watch television last night , Charles ? 
 It was a good game , wasn't it ? 
 What a pity . It was quite exciting . Both teams played very well . 
 It finished in a draw . What was the film like ? 
 Did your wife enjoy it ? 
 Would you like to ask any questions ? 
 What kind of fees ? 
 You have to pay a small fee every time you overdraft . 
 The fee is $ 25 every time you overdraft . 
 That fee should keep you from overdrafting . 
 Do you have any more questions ? 
 Honey . The cottages harmonize well with the landscape.That tourist resort is worth travelling to . 
 Did everyone fill out their entry permits ? 
 Speaking of flight attendants , they keep smiling at me . I wonder why ... 
 That's because it's time . 
 It's time to make our wedding wish come true ... 
 Why not ? I've got the rings ready . 
 Hopefully , you'll say " yes " ... 
 My what ? Oh , that , right as a trivet . 
 I will , thank you . 
 Please feel free to stay as long as you want . You know you ’ re always welcome here . 
 Is there anything else I can do for you before your leave ? 
 Don ’ t mention it . I ’ Ve really enjoyed your company . 
 What's the matter ? 
 Just relax . That's because you're new to chat . Let me take a look . 
 ZZZ means'sleepy or tired or bored ' , A / S / L is tricky , which is often used at first encounter . It's a three-word question , ' age , / sex / location ? ' 
 Wrong . lt's not a place name , but a passionate act . 
 Ahahah ... you miss her point for sure . H & K actually is an acronym for ' hug and kiss ' . 
 Yeah , seems that you have a lot to learn and memorize . 
 Hi , I'd like to leave a wake-up call . 
 Please wake me up at 6 am . 
 Oh , yes . You ? 
 I thought it was better than the others-I really liked it.What did you think of it ? 
 Mmm . That's what I thought , too . And I always enjoy watching Anthony Hopkins . 
 Hum , Edward Norton , or something like that . 
 Why don't you come round for a meal one evening next week ? 
 Which day would suit you ? 
 How about Thursday ? 
 Oh , about 6:00 . Will that be OK ? 
 See you on Thursday , then . 
 I bought some special local products . 
 Yes . I really wanted to do so . I love those handicrafts , especially the paper-cut . 
 Aren't animals the main content of Chinese paper-cuts ? 
 Then I will buy some tomorrow . 
 Because I want to send them to my friends . 
 Can I see your passport , please ? 
 Yes it is . Residents can queen up in the lines to my right . 
 What's the expiration date on your passport ? 
 I see . Yes , you'll need to renew your passport in a few months . Make sure you don't let it expire while you are in the UK . 
 Do you have anything to declare ? 
 How long will you be staying in the UK ? 
 What is the purpose of your stay ? 
 Where will you be staying ? 
 How do you plan on paying for your living costs and tuition fees while you are here ? 
 Ok . Have a good stay . Here's your passport and documents back . 
 Let's have seafood tonight and then go see the new movie at Mall Cinema.Betsy told me it's a beautiful love story and I shouldn't miss it . 
 No , we didn't . Last week we went to see that movie about a man's struggle against mental illness . 
 Oh , yeah , and I did promise to see it with you if we went to that movie last week.But you liked that movie , didn't you ? 
 It wasn't that bad , and you're the one that insisted on skipping dinner.We went to an excellent restaurant . 
 And I don't like meat that much.The only meat I eat is chicken . 
 Well , I suppose that , to be fair , you should get to pick the movie and we can go to a restaurant that serves meat . 
 Excuse me , I'm afraid you've parked in the wrong spot . 
 No , it's D408 , my parking space . I have already paid for it . 
 It's no big deal . Thank you . 
 I'd like to cash this check , please . 
 Yeah . Here's my identification card . 
 Actually , I want to buy some traveler's checks . 
 Twenties would be fine . 
 Yes , please . 
 Yes , I would like to reserve a room for next Monday . 
 By the way , I want a large room . 
 Yes , that's what I am looking for . I will take the room for 2 days . 
 Yes . I find dates to be a lot of fun . 
 They give me the opportunity to get to know someone better . 
 Not always . I don't always like the person I'm on the date with . 
 My date may not be my type . 
 I didn't realize until after our date that they weren't my type . 
 Now that I think about it , it really is sometimes . 
 Pierre Cardin . 
 It look fine.Can I try it on ? 
 Here will be OK . 
 Please put it on the scale . Where are you mailing it to ? 
 Do you want to mail it by air or sea ? 
 25 yuan by air , 13 yuan by sea . 
 About 2 days . 
 Please fill out this form , and what's in your package ? 
 OK , that will be OK . 
 I'm going to America . 
 I hope before the end of the month . 
 Any questions ? 
 Can we get in touch with you by e-mail ? Is this convenient for you ? 
 Thank you for your interest in our company . 
 May , could you tell me how to solve this problem ? 
 Don ’ t give me your attitude . Please tell me . 
 What's another Japanese art ? 
 Tea Ceremony ! Tell me about Tea Ceremony . 
 I see . 
 How do you learn that ? Is that something that your mother would teach you ? How do people learn that ? 
 You are blue in the face , arn't you ? 
 But supposing your son killed like the fish , what do you think then ? 
 So beat the cat , but don't kill it . 
 I'd like the double cheese burger meal , please . 
 Just coke will be fine . 
 That sounds good , thanks , I'd like that . Actually I'd like sprite instead of coke , thanks . 
 Yes , that's all . 
 You got it . 
 I like taking photos . 
 Yes , look at the photos I took . 
 Thank you for saying so . 
 Good morning , Star Airline . What can I do for you ? 
 I see . You are leaving for Berlin on July 23rd with Mr . Smith , right ? 
 Isn't your family name Lin ? 
 I am sonry.So you are loaving on Duty 21st and your seat is in the business section . 
 I hear that the Students ' Union is going to take new members . 
 Of course you can if you like it . 
 There will be an information session about the Students ' Union this Tuesday . You can apply for it then . 
 What do you think a job is ? 
 Where do you see yourself three years from now ? 
 That sounds reasonable . 
 Fine . What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a boss and his or her employees ? 
 You'll have a definite answer from us within a week . Goodbye . 
 How did you find your apartment ? 
 What if I need a roommate ? 
 How much do apartments cost around here ? 
 I just need a one-bedroom apartment . 
 Would you come with me to look at apartments ? 
 Yeah , but you guys don't stay with the same classmates all day , right ? 
 So , you sent out invitations to your whole graduating class ? 
 I thought homecoming was a high school dance . 
 Room reservations . Can I help you ? 
 What kind of room do you have in mind ? 
 Hold on , please . ... I'm afraid we're fully booked.The only room available at the moment is a suite . 
 I wonder if it is possible that we organize a dinner party for all the colleagues in our departments . They are working very hard these days . Maybe it is time for everybody to relax a little . 
 Well , what about this Thursday evening after we finish the weekly meeting ? 
 I hope so . Let me know how many will come . Then I will book the restaurant . 
 What's in it , please ? 
 OK . You may wrap it now . Please fill in this form and label it . ( after a moment ) Would you like it registered ? 
 Nine dollars and fifty cents . 
 Here's the receipt . 
 You're welcome . 
 My mother is ill in the hospital . 
 The disease fails to respond to drugs . 
 A tow truck was towing my car and put all those dents in my car . 
 They're saying it was already there . 
 I have to go to court . A cop was there so he can prove that the damage wasn't there . 
 I got an estimate and it's four thousand dollars . 
 We'll see what happens after court . 
 Well , I have been in a host home before . During my first year in the us , I stayed with a family . They are nice . 
 Well , that depends . If you stay for a long time . They will offer a discount . 
 Sure . What would you want to have today , Chinese food or western food ? 
 Here is the menu . Take your time . 
 Yes , what can I do for you ? 
 What's in it , please ? 
 OK . please fill in this form and label it . 
 Yeah . And would you like to mail it by air ? 
 Thirteen yuan , please . Here is the receipt and change . 
 You are welcome . 
 Yes , Mr . Emory ? 
 I thought they had already agreed to everything . That ’ s going to take weeks to rework . 
 What symptoms does he have ? 
 How long did the convulsion last ? 
 Does he have any other complaints ? 
 Have you taken his temperature ? 
 Let me examine him to see if there is any rash . No rash . 
 No , it is not meningitis . Just a high fever and convulsions , which results from a virus upper respiratory tract inflection . 
 No . No need for admission . I'll give the baby analgia nose drops to bring down the temperature first . Then I will give you a prescription . The pink tablets are used for his fever . When his temperature is over 38 ° C , give him one tablet . The other tablets are sedatives for his convulsions . The white liquid is for the cold . Give the baby plenty of water to drink . 
 Can I help you ? 
 I can't get into my room . I mean I left my room key inside . 
 Oh , did they ? Well , would you give us an extra key to the room ? 
 By the way , what should I do with the key when I go out ? 
 Good afternoon . I am Mr . Brown , the Import manager of Atlantic Industries Ltd , Sidney , Australia . This is my card . 
 Nice to see you , Mrs . Anderson . 
 Thank you . 
 I ’ d prefer coffee if you don ’ t mind . 
 No , it ’ s the fourth time . 
 Yes , a great deal . The business scope has been broadened , and there are more visitors than ever before . 
 Oh , yes . Quite a bit . But we are especially interested in your products . 
 Women ’ s dresses . They are fashionable and suit Australian women well , too . If they are of high quality and the prices are reasonable , we ’ ll purchase large quantities of them . Will you please quote us a price ? 
 Could you baby-sit for me tonight ? 
 Excuse me , sir . May I help you ? 
 What's wrong ? 
 OK , I am sorry for that . We will arrange another one for you . 
 Well , they look lovely , but they ’ re not very practical . I mean , would you wear that dress to the office or walking down the street ? 
 Maybe . I ’ m not sure why they have fashion shows like this . Hardly anyone will buy those clothes . The clothes you see are nothing like the ones that ordinary people wear . It seems like a waste of money . 
 You meant it ’ s an expression of their fantasies ? 
 Very philosophical . I think they design these clothes more for publicity . They try to see who can be the most extreme and outrageous , but still stylish . 
 I'd like to remit 5000 dollars to my friend . 
 Room 20 , Suzie Building , Beijing Road , Shenzhen , China . 
 Check out these wheels ! 
 No , I borrowed it . 
 You guessed right . Besides , the color violet is a little girly for me . 
 Have you ever been involved in the auditing work ? 
 How long did it take you to become an auditor ? 
 There is something wrong with my credit card . 
 There is a charge on here that I never made . 
 It was a charge for a $ 350 purse that I never bought . 
 I think I would remember if I made a purchase that large . 
 It was purchased on the 12th of November at 3 
 In the meantime , do I have to pay for this charge ? 
 I wonder if you can help me . I'm looking for a room . 
 How much is it ? 
 OK.Can I see the room now ? 
 Hello , John , please invite all our clients to the conference next week . 
 Get the clients ' contact info from my Rolodex . 
 How about the Holiday Inn ? 
 Well , the client is always right . 
 Please print out the meeting agenda for me to look over . 
 And make sure to return my Rolodex to my desk when you are done with it . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 How many carats diamond do you want ? 
 Is this one suit for you ? 
 What about this ? 
 Yes , try this one please . 
 3,500 yuan . 
 Sorry , I'm late . 
 This is the house I want to rent . 
 No problem . First , it's comfortable and cozy . Second , it has a lovely view of the city . Third , it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need , such as refrigerator , electric stove , heating apparatus , washing machine and dishwasher . Forth is the most important , the electricity is free of charge . Finally , it's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient . 
 200 dollars per week . 
 It certainly is . But to tell you the truth , the room is so large that I can share it with someone else , and that will decrease the total amount of the rent . 
 Don't you think I can save some bus fares since it ’ s easy to go anywhere from here and it ’ s near the place where I work ? 
 Twice a week for work and once for shopping . 
 That's true . Ok , I will think about it . 
 sure . A UFO is just a space vehicle from another planet . If you think about it , our space shuttles are UFOs . 
 I've seen photos of UFOs in America before , but they've all looked doctored up . 
 I think there must be . 
 I don't't think it would make sense if we were the only beings in this whole world . The world is just far too big for that . 
 no , but we're trying to contact them . 
 I think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet , humankind will not become extinct . 
 there's a lot of evidence that suggest it will , but I don't think it's going to happen any time soon . 
 Yes , Friday I have a class , right after work . 
 Saturday my parents are coming to town . What ’ s up ? 
 No , do you want to go and do something ? 
 Oh , that sounds great . How about 6 o ’ clock ? 
 Of course , sir . Did you have anything from the minibar ? 
 Ok , the total would be $ 367 and 65 cents.How would you pay ? 
 Of course , sir . Will you need taxi ? 
 I feel very miserable . I took the death of my wife very hard , you know . 
 I ’ Ve tried it , not a chance . 
 What's the weather forecast for today ? 
 Any rain ? 
 I wouldn't either . It's been looking like rain for several days . 
 Just one moment . I'll check with the cancer ward desk . 
 Ma'am , I'm sorry . The cancer ward said Mr . Smith passed away two days ago . 
 Yes , ma'am . He died from complications of stomach cancer . I'm very sorry . 
 Mary and I decided to ring the curtain down on our love affair . 
 Don ’ t make a fuss . Many people divorce after having living together for many years . 
 What ’ s the matter , Sally ? You look so unhappy . 
 What happened ? 
 Your bag ? Did you get it back ? 
 That ’ s too bad . I ’ m sorry to hear that . 
 As far as I know , the nearest one is next to the Willdon . 
 Yes , take the greyhound bus . It will lead you directly there . 
 It seems to me that everything is going digital nowadays . 
 Cool ! What brand 
 What about the quality ? 
 Anything I can do for you ? 
 It's on the third floor . 
 You're welcome . 
 Could I get a hamburger , please ? 
 No , thank you . 
 Let me have a soda . 
 May I have a Sprite , please ? 
 I would also like a bag of chips . 
 That's everything . 
 Don't build a fire under me . I know the importance of time . 
 Don't you see I'm trying my best ? 
 Has all the work done by men been replaced by automatic computers ? 
 Excuse me , what is this ? 
 Are the batteries in it made by your people ? 
 What kind of battery is it ? 
 Honey , can you set the table ? 
 Well , make sure to put out the pepper and salt shakers . I don ’ t know if your brother is coming tonight so set an extra place mat just in case . 
 Yeah go ahead , forks , spoons and knives . I roasted some meat so be sure to put out some steak knives as well . 
 Honey ? Have you seen our soup bowls ? 
 Oops ! 
 My roommate invited both of us to dinner . 
 Yes ! The first time I saw her I knew we would fall in love . 
 He has reached puberty . His mind and body both will change a lot . 
 Time is flying . I still remember everything when he was a child . 
 I helped my boss organize some grand ceremonies and maintained close relations with newspapers , magazines , the radio and the TV . 
 If I am not in the service center , I will assist others in resolving the consumer complaints . And pass the criticism on to the relevant department . 
 Sure . What kind of skin do you have ? 
 Then I advise you to buy the LAY cleansing milk . 
 I am sorry , I have broken my wine glass , and would you please bring me another ? 
 Thank you . Where is the washing room ? 
 Madison Suites , how may I help you ? 
 OK ma'am , can you tell me the date you expect to check in ? 
 We have a junior single suite or a superior double suite available for those dates . 
 The junior suite is smaller and has one twin bed , while the superior suite has a double bed and mini-bar . 
 Yes , a buffet breakfast is served every morning . I will need your name and your credit card details in order to complete the reservation . 
 What sort of things do you grow in your garden ? 
 When is your garden at its best ? 
 May I use your phone ?

 How are you today ? 
 I ’ m fine , thanks . How is Tony ? 
 She ’ s very well , too , Helen . Goodbye , Helen . Nice to see you . 
 Great party , isn't it ?

 Bob was late for work this morning . 
 Yes , once last week . 
 Jenny , what's your favorite color ? 
 Now , we're going to draw an apple in your sketch book . What do we use ? 
 Why not ? Let's draw the outline of an apple with your pencil first . 
 well , I am a little bit out of shape . I think I should get some exercise to keep fit . what kind of service do you offer ? 
 how can you get that done ? 
 what else ? 
 sounds pretty good . How much do you charge ? 
 perhaps one month . I'll just have a try at first . 
 OK , I'll take it . 
 I am sorry.The flight is late.Please go to the waiting room for further notice . 
 Don't worry . We will keep you well informed . 
 Oh , I am not sure I even want to look at this house ! 
 It doesn ’ t look much better inside this place . 
 There are hardly any windows in here , and that makes it really gloomy . 
 Look at those broken tile countertops and the peeling wallpaper . 
 What ’ s that smell ? 
 John , you have done a good job . Our new series computer is appreciated by the guests . They intend to sign contracts with our company . You really did a good job . 
 Hah , as the sale department director of our team , you are the best . 
 Why not ? You've done so well for the company . She should give you a prize . 
 Come on ! What are you nervous about ? 
 But the sale number is close to the predicted amount . 
 Take it easy . Be confident . I'm sure you can do it . 
 We are fishing with worms . The fish seem to like them . 
 Looks like a lucky day for everyone . 
 Who wrote it ? 
 Who're the producer , the director , the stars , heroine and the hero ? 
 Don ’ t you think that ’ s good idea to hold a party outside ? 
 How about going to a concert ? 
 The washing machine isn't working again . 
 Stupid girl , making me spend so much money , now I have to get it from the ATM ... 
 I know where to put my card ! Stupid machine , talking to me like I ’ m an idiot ... 
 Yeah , yeah , I know what I selected . Just give me my money ! 
 No , no ! Stupid machine , what are you doing ! No ! 
 Hello ! You're welcome to Guangzhou Fair . 
 Glad to meet you , Mr . Smith . My name is Wang and here is my name card . I'll be glad to do what I can for you . 
 Glad to . The Fair is a big gathering taking place twice a year , thousands of businessmen from more than a hundred and fifty countries and regions are here to trade with China . 
 Ours is a company special in exporting leather products . And what about yours ? 
 An interesting meeting , isn't it ? 
 Let me introduce myself , by the way . My name's Thomas Bradley . 
 Sorry , what was your last name again ? 
 Ok , I'm Tom . 
 And what do you do , Ted ? 
 Salesman ? 
 I work for American Airlines . 
 I'm in the Personnel Department . 
 Can you tell me which Sons you want to go to ? 
 You'll have to catch two different buses to get there . 
 The 268 is the first bus you need to catch . 
 Get off when you get to Fair Oaks and Washington . 
 Catch the 261 and get off at Sons . 
 That's all you have to do . 
 Yeah . If you are available now , let me describe your work duties , OK ? 
 As a newcomer , you are going to be responsible for some basic tasks first , including certain routine duties like answering the telephone and typing . Later , you will be assigned to the Sales Department . 
 For this is your first day in our company , you can begin with our special products . Before you do your job , it's necessary for you to be familiar with our own products . Sort these papers and file them correctly . 
 Thank you so much . I can't take this . 
 What did she mean just now about raising pigs ? 
 Ha-ha . I get it . That's funny . Your cousin's a real sarcastic lady . 
 What are you doing this weekend ? 
 I'm not sure yet . 
 What movie are you going to see ? 
 There's nothing I can think of . 
 No , thanks , maybe another time . 
 Can I help you , madam ? 
 Certainly.Here you are.They ' re the very latest fashion . 
 They're of good cotton and the color never fades . 
 I'm afraid I can't . Parking is not allowed here . 
 There is a square in front of us . We can park the car there . 
 I'm not sure , you know I'm not familiar with the city , too . 
 It's a little sensitive , actually . I need to get hold of some money , and quickly . 
 I already have some Time Deposits with you , but unfortunately , they haven't matured yet . I really don't want to cash those just yet . 
 I've not heard of that , could you tell me more , please ? 
 Right ... anything else ? 
 And then I just sign here ? You're right ! It certainly is simple and extremely convenient . 
 Uh , just for fun . Happy Easter , Mom . We got you these Easter lilies . 
 Of course I'm pale . It's just now the beginning of spring . I don't have my summer tan yet . 
 I'm fine , Mom . Remember Holly ? This is her roommate , Yi-jun .. 
 You'll find the cereal by the breakfast foods . 
 They're over by the oatmeal and the breakfast bars . 
 Can I help you with anything else ? 
 You'll find that by the paper towels . 
 That's where it'll be . 
 If you need anything else , please feel free to ask me 
 It depends If you are interested in the city.you might like to tour it by car I can be your guide , We'll leave the afternoon free.You can do some shopping in the mall if you like . 
 I suggest we visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art first , Now let's go.look people are jogging along the river.Here we are . 
 So do I . This is Broadway.There are lots of theaters . This way leads to Times Square . 
 I have been doing quite well . As reach 90 % and Bs reach 100 % . And I ’ Ve received Scholarship two times . 
 Yes . To develop my knowledge , I studied Economics , Business Administration and Accountingthrough self-study . Nowadays , I have passed three courses on CPA . 
 Yes . I used to be the monitor of my class . 
 It ’ s a very important experience for me . First , it improved my organizing ability , and let me understand how to resolve a problem in the overall perspective instead of my own perspective . Second , it let me know how to cooperate in harmony with people who I like or dislike . 
 Yes , I used to work as an assistant lawyer for Tienda Law Office . 
 Oh , really ? Nice to meet you . I thought they were going to leave me here on my own ! How long have you been with the company ? 
 Does it ever ! Well , let ’ s get started . If you could begin typing this letter now , I ’ ll see what else needs to be done . 
 You mean you want to stay at home ? 
 I thought maybe you were interested in an outing . 
 It is a large-scale business , which has more than two thousand staff . 
 There are over 20 subsidiaries around the world . 
 It's Clive of course . Where did you come from ? Every girl knows Clive ! 
 He is everybody's type . 
 Shooting guard . The same as Michael Jordan ! 
 Used to . But now he is too old to play in a fierce game like this . But Kobe is the upcoming superstar now . 
 That is not true . They are just jealous of him ! 
 You know what , he is also an outstanding football player . He is surely to be a star of tomorrow . 
 You are so not here ! His girlfriend is one of the cheer leaders . 
 Mum , can I finish my homework later ? 
 But I want to watch TV now . 
 Please . 
 Not even for an hour ? 
 Give these sales figures a look . It's pretty depressing . We're way in the red this year . We can't afford to keep going like this for much longer . 
 Deman is dropping . The problem is our competition . They are monopolizing the market ! 
 It's really too early to tell , but a lot is riding on the new products . If we don't do better after the product launch , we may have to go bankrupt . 
 Look at this numbers and see for yourself . Read'sm and weep . 
 The murderer was sentenced to life imprisonment . 
 Yeah , because he just killed a man in cold blood . 
 Have you seen any good movies lately ? 
 Why ? You were a real movie buff when you were a student . 
 I would like to order a waistcoat . 
 Yes , I want it to made of tweed . 
 When will it be available ? 
 Sorry to bother you sir , but I have some bad news . 
 Well , the stock market just took a huge plunge and we ’ Ve lost a lot of money ! 
 There are many factors that weigh in , but NASDAQ is down 200 points , the DOW JONES indicator also suffered ! Our portfolio is worth half of what it was worth points week ago . 
 I know sir ! We didn ’ t expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden . On the other hand , you still have some high yield trash bonds and government bonds that will give us enough liquidity to cut our loses and reinvest in emerging markets . We could potentially make this tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box . 
 What kind of document is an invoice ? 
 How many kinds of foreign invoices are there ? 
 What does the price in different kinds of invoices include ? 
 Oh , I see . 
 Oh , I forgot to tell you this . The show is to collect money for children in need . And all the money from ticket selling will go to the Red Cross . 
 Good idea . 
 A lot of stars , including Andy , Justin , Mendy ... 
 Me too . She is so young and talented . She is not only a singer but also a great composer herself . 
 She is a real star . Not a onetime thing . 
 Well , I suppose people have different tastes on music . Moreover , here stuff is really strong and creative . It takes time for people to accept new things . 
 Sure . That makes a good fan . Do you know what songs she is gonna sing tonight ? 
 OK . 
 Isn ’ t it wonderful here ? The kids are enjoying themselves in the swimming pool . I hope it ’ s safe . 
 The kids said that they wanted to go to a party at the hotel . There ’ s a special one just for kids . 
 That ’ s a great idea . We can really enjoy ourselves without worrying about the kids . 
 It's a lot of work running a campaign , isn't it ! 
 Hang in there . The hardest part is just about over . 
 About 15 . I've seen him work hard for a lot of good changes . 
 Did you know we're trying to talk him into considering a presidential campaign ? 
 So , you know how to drive , right ? 
 Do you think you can teach me ? 
 I have it already . 
 I've only done it once . 
 Yes , I am aware of them . 
 Whenever you have time . 
 Hi , George . I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ? 
 Yeah , that's very important . 
 I ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer . 
 It ’ s always easier to say something than to do it . 
 But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans . 
 It ’ s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes . 
 I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time . 
 It seems that ' clothes make the man ' . 
 Hey , did you hear about Jessica's party this weekend ? 
 Oh really ? She gave me mine earlier today . 
 Yeah , so are you planning on going ? 
 It really does , I can't wait . 
 It starts at 8 o'clock . 
 I'm not sure , but I don't think she's given out that many . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Let me see , the buying rate is RIB 808 per $ 100 . How much would you like to change ? 
 Would you mind showing me your passport ? 
 Let me see . $ 200 makes RIB 1,616 . Here is the cash and exchange memo . Please check it . 
 Excuse me , can you tell me which is Bob Rice's office ? 
 Yes . He told me to come by this morning . 
 An appointment ? 
 He said I should come by this morning . He didn't give me a time.He said I could come any time before noon . 
 Today is Tuesday . 
 That's too bad . I need to discuss these plans with him . 
 Alright . 
 Friday is good . 
 Morning . 
 Yes . My name is Laura Wills . 
 Thank you . 
 Thanks for coming shopping with me . 
 I've never given a speech in front of a thousand people before . 
 Thanks . Now let's decide which one of these suits looks best for this occasion . 
 The question is , can he have it done before Friday ? 
 Hi , could we have two orange juice smoothies ? 
 Sure , why not ? 
 Caterpillar fungus ? ! What the heck is that ? 
 I would like to speak to you , if you don ’ t mind . 
 I would like to talk to you about this year ’ s election . 
 I am a volunteer for this year ’ s campaign . 
 I know history is about to be made , and I would like to be a part of it . 
 Are you planning on voting ? 
 Go to your polling place early on Election Day . 
 I am Liu Yi , from China XYZ Company . I ’ d like to see Mr . Thomas , please . 
 No , I am afraid not . I just arrive in town today . 
 Would you please ask when he will be free ? 
 Your silk garments have aroused much interest in our country ever since our first order was put on the market . We have no doubt we can do better this year if you appoint us your sales agent . 
 That's true . However at the Fair last March , people were so interested in Chinese garments that the demand this year will surely increase . 
 I'm sure it will , if we are appointed your agent . Your garments are attractive , and we , a well-established importer with multiple sales channels , can boost the sales . 
 Poor Danny . You are so enfeebled ! 
 Mom called just now saying that she and Dad will be back later . Do you want to speak to them on phone ? 
 Whatever . Have a drink of water . 
 Maybe later . I think we have a medicine-kit . 
 Probably on the of the cabinet . I'll go and get it . 
 Oh , here it is . Patulin . Oh , no ! 
 Keep lying down . The matter is that all the medicine here is past expiration . 
 I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed . What do you think ? Damn , it hurts ! 
 I'm lucky I wasn't killed . I must have been going around forty-five miles an hour.There was too much gravel on that corner . I slid out . 
 Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped.Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk . 
 There . Stop ! 
 Yes , my old friend Hanson lives there 
 Yes . He's one of my best friends . Our friendship formed at college . Why did you ask that ? 
 I get it . You want to find a guide , don ’ t you ? 
 Don ’ t worry . I will call Hanson , and ask him to help you . 
 Do you wash clothes here often ? 
 Why do you wash here ? 
 I've only washed my clothes here a couple times . 
 I would , if my washing machine wasn't broken . 
 I can't afford it . 
 That's my only option right now . 
 I'm calling to ask about your apartment you advertised . 
 That sounds fantastic ! But I am looking for something closer to downtown , as I spend most of my time at the office . 
 I'm sure they are wonderful , but I need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost . 
 Great ! I'll arrange a viewing after work tomorrow afternoon . Could you tell me the detailed dress ? 
 OK . Thank you . 
 Okay , I will . 
 Well , we try ! Here , I just made some carrot juice . Would you like a glass ? 
 You don't have to go to the mountains ! I stand on my head during my yoga routine every morning ! 
 Have a good day at school ! See you tonight ! 
 Hello , Xu Hua . I'm Paula . I'm American . 
 Thank you . 
 Of course , I like . 
 Forsythia . It's also called winter jasmine which is the symbol of the spring's arrival . 
 Yes . How about you ? 
 You have a perfect taste ! 
 But it used to be ignored by many people . 
 Well , it's snowing . Let's enjoy the plum blossoms when snowing . 
 Wait a minute . I will get him here . Sorry , he is busy doing something . Why don't you give him a ring later ? 
 You are welcome . 
 How about taking a walk in the park ? 
 Oh , it's so quiet here.We have the park to ourselves , only you and me ! 
 Oh , I see them.Some are doing Taijiquan , some are performing swordplay , some are practising the Chinese Wushu . 
 Here's some dancing . See those guys stomping , clapping and shouting ? They're practicing step-dancing . 
 They basically turn their bodies into drums . There's a national step competition every year . 
 Wen ! That's only a stereotype . Like all Asians are supposed to be math geniuses . I'm not a great dancer , and you said you failed calculus . 
 Would you give me some fruits ? How much are these oranges ? 
 How about this one ? 
 Well , I'll take five of the seventy cent ones , and those grapefruits sweet ? 
 I follow you and I'll take three just for my trial . 
 That's all.Thank you . 
 Yes , I must go to Shanghai to attend a meeting about our plan . 
 Six days or so . 
 Harry . He has been assisting me on the plan . 
 Yes , he is familiar with the plan . 
 Yeah.But Bob's talent can't to be named on the same day with Carl's . 
 We cannot judge a man totally by that . 
 We can take a bus there . 
 I think so . 
 No , it's too crowded . 
 Fine . Let's get on . Oh , no , Judy ! Get off the bus quickly ! 
 We got on the wrong bus . 
 My full name is Zhang Yong . Zhang is the surname or family name . 
 Zhang , Z , H , A , N , G . 
 My present address is No . 415 Green Street . This is also my permanent address . 
 My telephone number is 4837625 . 
 I'm from Guangdong . 
 My birthday is June 14th , 1985 . 
 OK , don ’ t worry about it . I will . 
 Wow , American football is more exciting than I thought . 
 Oh , right . So , I can ’ t quite follow what ’ s going on ... who ’ s winning ? 
 Wow ! What a hit ! 
 Is he ok ? 
 I guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team . 
 Yeah . 
 What happened ? Why did everyone get so quiet ? 
 Welcome , sir . May I help you ? 
 No problem . Actually , we have some great packages . The most exciting season of Hawaii is now . How about a relaxing vacation in Hawaii ? 
 Yes . There will be one at the end of this month . For many people , a Hawaiian vacation promises languid days filled with sunbathing and poolside cocktails . For others , it ’ s all about non-stop action in one of the world's most extreme natural playgrounds . Whether you are in search of quiet relaxation or unbridled stimulation , Hawaii gives you the best of both . 
 15 days . The transportation by air will take five days . 
 Sir , let's do it step by step . First , we will visit over 25 different places . Most of the places are in Hawaii ’ s Big Island . We will stay in Arlott ’ s Lodge 
 Well , right now there's a special rate for 40,000 RIB for this package , including everything such as airline ticket , tour guides , hotels and food . All you have to do is to sign up and we will take care of everything . 
 Sure . By the way , this special price is only good through the end of the week . 
 Yes , sir . It will be a great pity ! 
 Thank you ! 
 Extension 1616 , please . 
 Then , will you try extension 235 ? 
 What's the latest fashion of evening gown ? 
 I would like to try on one in violet . 
 Thank you . Do you have some other colors ? 
 Cindy ’ s husband is Ron . 
 They have two children-one son and one daughter-as well as one daughter-in-law and one son-in-law . 
 Yes , they have three grandchildren-one girl and two boys . 
 Yes , she gets along with them quite well . 
 Their family is very similar to Cindy and Ron ’ s family . 
 Sorry . You've got the wrong number . 
 I just make eye contact with him and nod my head . Then I tell him when he comes over to the table . Why do you ask ? 
 That seems a little impolite in such a restaurant . 
 Well , it was a warm evening , so I stretched my legs . I walked along the canal for a couple of miles . Actually , several other people had the same idea . I saw Bill . 
 He seemed ok . We didn ’ t stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal . We just waved at each other . 
 Of course . What do you want to move first ? 
 Hello , there . You are looking a little confused ; can I help you with something ? 
 Don't worry ; I can help you with that . I understand that new technology can sometimes be unnerving . The first thing we need to do is check the ATM is in service . This one is fine . 
 Yes , this one is in service . Put your card in here , in this slot and wait a moment . Then you will see some instructions on the screen . 
 And press ' enter ' to confirm , here . Now you need to decide which service you need . 
 That's the beauty of these machines , you can do almost anything . And unlike a person , they don't usually take breaks or go off sick ! 
 Can I see your ID ? 
 I'm going to need to see your ID and $ 27 for your permit . 
 Make it quick . 
 Thanks . Now fill this out . 
 Use this one . 
 You're welcome . Turn the application in at Window B . 
 The best we can do is $ 120 per case . 
 I think you are well informed about the prevailing market.Some Spanish firms are offering the same at much lower prices . 
 It's true yours are of better quality . But your price is still on the high side even if we take quality into consideration . How about meeting each other half way ? 
 Take your time , please . 
 Yes , I used to have a part-time job in advertising company . 
 I mostly did advertising planning . 
 I think an advertising planner should have active thoughts , creative talent , and be sensitive to the changes in the market . 
 The most important thing I learned was that I must continuously improve my abilities . Advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact to success . If I want to make in marking in advertising industry , I can ’ t stop studying and creating . 
 Sort of yes . 
 But I am not that someone . I can easily talk him into doing whatever I want him to do . 
 I had to look after my son at home . 
 He has a fever . 
 I think so.Thank you . 
 You're kidding ! 
 I know he really deserves this . 
 Do you have reservations ? 
 Very Wang sir , smoking or no smoking ? 
 Of course , this way please . 
 Did you mail us your last Continued Claim Form ? 
 We cannot pay you unless you turn that form in every two weeks . 
 It can ’ t be more than fourteen days late for us to accept it . 
 You can ’ t possibly know in advance how much you will be working . If you mail it in too soon , we will reject it ! 
 Your check will be arriving late , but the next one will come right on time . 
 Are you certain that that is what you want to do ? 
 Why do you think that this would be a good move ? 
 Yes , there are always pros and cons to making a career change . 
 I think the slight pay decrease might be worth it . The benefits are much better . 
 I think you should definitely apply for the position . 
 Sure ! I can help you . Do you know where the timesheets are kept ? 
 Well , once you get one off the shelf over there , you first put your name on it . OK ? 
 Now you have to fill in the hours in the blanks and total the hours for the week . Do you know how to use military time ? 
 OK , so we just start counting hours at midnight and record it . Show all minutes as a dot and then write how many minutes . OK ? 
 After you total your hours , make sure you sign it and turn it in to your supervisor . 
 Good luck and let me know if you need any help later on . 
 Sure . What is it ? 
 I'm glad to help you . But what is it you want to ask about ? 
 Why ? I think the meeting went well . 
 Yes . But what are you worried about ? 
 Rude ? You weren't rude at all , Annie . Why do you think you were rude ? 
 I understand . But really you weren't rude at all.You said what you thought . I think he appreciates that . 
 Yes . 
 You mean because you are a woman ? 
 Listen , Annie . You shouldn't worry about Mr . Drummond.He is a very good man to work for . He is not sexist at all.He appreciates people for their ideas.And he is willing to take suggestions from men or women . 
 I agree with you on that , Annie . I've worked for Derek Drummond for nine years now . I feel he appreciates his employees for their work , not their gender . I would never change jobs . 
 Any time . If you have a good idea , don't be afraid to speak up.This is a company that appreciates initiative . 
 sure . Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality . 
 to begin with , I have to use chopsticks . 
 certainly . After all , I've been here for two years . It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils . Though , I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Ch 
 anything strang about that ? 
 oh , sorry ! There's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks . 
 Thank you . So pleasant to meet you here ! 
 Yes , I've brought a list of your recent products with me . We'd like to import some of your latest clothes for the second half of this year . We're ready to place an order with you . 
 That sounds good . But I have a proposal now . 
 Both of our two parties were involved in the discussion previously . Shall we also allow some of our clients to join us ? 
 Sounds like we have the same idea . 
 How long will it take to make five hundred ? 
 Good . 
 I want to buy a ticket to Sydney tomorrow . 
 What's the exact information ? 
 How long is the layover in Melboume ? 
 Yes . I want a first class single ticket . 
 good morning , Nathaniel . This is Leah calling from the International Student Office . 
 the reason I'm calling is because Ms . Collins will not be able to call you back until next week . 
 she's terribly sorry about that . She had to leave the office suddenly and won't be able to return until next week . She hopes you understand . 
 she asked me to call you to book an appointment with someone else today . When are you free today ? 
 Mr . Liu is available at 2:15 today . Will that work for you ? 
 I'm afraid she isn't available this afternoon . She has an opening at 11:30 this morning . Will that work for you ? 
 ok , we'll be expecting you at 11:30 . See you then . 
 That ’ s all right . I understand . 
 That ’ s ok . Don ’ t be sorry . We ’ ll talk later . 
 Hi , Randy . What are you going to do this weekend ? 
 How about going hunting with me ? 
 Okay . I ’ ll pick you up around 6 
 Good morning.So this is the first day for you to work here , I hope you'll like your job . 
 I hope so.Now let me tell you your duties here.This is your desk.Please sit down . 
 Your main duty is to answer the phone calls and transfer them to the person wanted . 
 In that case , you are supposed to ask the caller to leave a message . 
 Yes , you are responsible for keeping all files in order . 
 If you have any questions . I will help you . 
 Dear fellows . As you know , Mr . Ross will be leaving us very soon after his short but meaningful visit to our company . 
 Just as what I said in my welcome speech , Mr . Ross's visit to our company is meaningful for both our two companies . Thank you very much for your visiting . We will miss you all the time . 
 That's our pleasure . Mr . Ross , your visit leaves gorgeous memory here . And I hope Mr.Halmiton , the president of your company can also have the chance to visit our company soon . Remember me to him , please . 
 My latte looks like that shoe polish we did an ad for last month . 
 It still tastes fine , though . 
 Wait a second ! There's the idea for this case ! “ Your motor oil should be as choice and fresh as your morning coffee . ” 
 Fine , thanks . I will go to Mainland China for a business trip tomorrow , and I want to change some Hong Kong dollars into Renminbi . 
 One thousand yuan , please . By the way , what is today's exchange quotation ? 
 Oh , I see . Could you please split the one thousand Renminbi into hundreds and tens ? 
 Five hundred in hundred RIB notes and the others in ten RIB notes , please . 
 Thank you very much . 
 What do you mean ? 
 You are kidding . What happened ? 
 That's really surprising . I always thought they are well matched . What about the kids ? Who get custody ? 
 That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about . Well , I still can't believe it , Masha and Hero , the perfect couple . When would they divorce be final ? 
 Do you buy that newspaper every day ? 
 Is there a Sunday edition of that newspaper ? 
 What section does it have ? 
 What ’ s in that section ? 
 I buy a national newspaper sometimes , buy I nearly always buy a local evening newspaper . I find the local news more interesting than national or international news . 
 Oh , don ’ t go yet . Let ’ s at least have one more . 
 It ’ s too bad that you have to leave so early . 
 Thanks for coming ! We should meet again sometime soon . 
 Anytime . You can reach me 5558929 . 
 Fine . 
 I hope so , too . Bye ! Ben . 
 Do you attend school during the day or only at night ? 
 Do you drive a motorcycle or an automobile ? 
 Great , the price for that permit is thirty dollars ; cash , check , or credit card ? 
 Do you need to buy a duplicate permit for a second vehicle ? 
 OK , here is your permit ; enjoy the next semester . 
 First , why don't you tell me what you need , such as how big a room , where you want to live , whether you want to live downtown , and what you like to do . Then I can figure out which apartment is most suitable for you . 
 I think that an apartment with two rooms and a kitchen would suit your needs . I can introduce you to a place for rent near your school . The apartment is on the 7th floor , so it is very quiet and suitable for studying . 
 You can also go to the school's sports field to play soccer , and if you're lucky you might make some Chinese friends there . It is right near the market and has comfortable facilities . 
 Front Desk . 
 Yes , what time would you like a wake-up call ? 
 Where are you studying and what's your major ? 
 Why did you choose Beijing University ? 
 What courses have you learned ? 
 Which one is your favorite ? Why ? 
 What was your minor subject ? 
 Did you pass the test ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . 
 Of course , it's my pleasure . We'll quote you the lowest price prevailing . 
 Here is our price list , our terms are cash within three months of date of delivery , if you can pay it within one month . we'll give you a discount of 10 % . 
 Can you tell me how many goods you intend to order ? 
 The most we can offer you at present is 600 dozen . 
 Not bad . But there is more room for improvement . 
 There were some gaps in your report . Please be more sorrow . 
 I like the kid.He ' s so lovely . 
 Twelve.He ' s very sensible for his age . 
 Thank you . I was lucky this time . 
 I am flattered . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Certainly , do you have your school schedule ? The books are arranged by course number and instructor . 
 You must be feeling terrible for Mary . 
 I'm worried that she can't catch up with her class . 
 in China at least , coffee is often associated with an exotic , well-to-do bourgeois lifestyle . Coffee is often considered a hobby of the well-educated , middle-class people . 
 yes . Behind a lifestyle , there is a culture . Young people easily become blind worshippers of a Westernized life . While they may not really life coffee , they think it desirable and enviable to be lavish 
 well . Tea represents another facet of popular culture . While a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft , elegant music , a teahouse is often a noisy , crowded , public space . People visit tea 
 well , that's true . In a sense , it is not so much what you drink that really counts , as where and how you drink . 
 Sure , do you have the receipt ? 
 Ok . may I ask what is the reason for returning these products ? 
 I see , and what about the keyboard ? 
 I am sorry mam , but we can only exchange or refund defective products , we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages . 
 I left a suitcase on the train to London the other day . 
 It's a small blue case and it's got a zip . There's a label on the handle with my name and address on it . 
 No , that's not mine . 
 Let me see it . 
 David Hall , 83 , Bridge Street . 
 Here you are . 
 Hey ! 
 This case doesn't belong to me ! You've given me the wrong case ! 
 You have good taste . It's made of red wood . 
 300 dollars . 
 Believe me , it's worth the price . 
 How much are you willing to pay ? 
 No . That price would hardly cover the cost . 
 275 dollars is the lowest price I can offer . 
 Hello . 
 Yes , please . I'd like to open a savings account . Would you please give me some advice ? 
 What's the difference between the two ? 
 Then how about the current account ? 
 Thank you for your help . I think I'll open a current account . 
 Yes . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Good afternoon . How can I help you ? 
 Ok , please first fill in the form and return it to me . You can do it in the next door . 
 Everybody attention . I would like to make sure you all know the process . The interview consists of three parts . One , all of the interviewees will answer the question there and lasts for maximum one hour . Two , we will take a 30 - minute ’ s break . After the break , we all come back to this office and I will announce the successful candidates for the 2nd round . In which , you have a small interview with your future manager . 
 Good question . But I will tell you when you pass the first two . 
 I can confidently say that my Chinese and English are pretty good . I won prizes in many speech contests in both Chinese and English . 
 I believe every company has its own salary criterion . And you will give me a satisfying salary according to my abilities and performances . 
 I don't entirely agree with you . 
 Well , that's a thing . 
 Yes , it's far quicker and less complicated . 
 Really ? 
 Yes , and seven days a week . 
 Follow me , please . 
 No , you don't have to . 
 Do you rent cameras here ? 
 I want one that is easy to handle . 
 That's good . What's the fee ? 
 Don't brother me ! 
 Sorry , Sally , it's not your fault . 
 I drew a blank on ~ about the test . 
 Yeah , but nothing was clear during the test . 
 I'm thinking of dropping out . 
 I'm dead serious about this , Sally . 
 That price of ours , by the way , is for a minimum quantity of 1,000 saddles . 
 20-30 % . But we proposed the plan from the storage and delivery viewpoint . That is to say , less warehouse space and prompt delivery . 
 Sales have been exceptionally good during the past twelve months . 
 All in the local market . One or two suggestions that came in from the distribution might interest you . 
 Perhaps . General opinion is that the rear carrier should be offered as an extra . 
 Thanks . 
 My name is Liu Lichi . How do you do ? 
 Quite good , I think . I came here by bus , and it took me about 15 minutes . 
 Twenty . 
 Yes , I'm student of grade 3 in the university majoring in economics . 
 English , math , commercial and legal studies , and accountancy . 
 Well , I worked at a supermarket during last summer holidays . 
 I like sports very much.Besides that , I also like working on a computer in my spare time . 
 I have passed the CET - 4 and 6.As far as computer is concerned I can use the computer for word processing . 
 Steven , have you got better now ? 
 I guess you miss your wife and children very much . 
 If necessary , I can stay here to accompany you until you are discharged . 
 You are my best friend . That's what I should do . Please don ’ t be a stranger . 
 Good morning . 
 Nothing much — the same old stuff . A lot of bad news as usual . 
 Sunny and mild today , cloudy and rainy tomorrow . 
 Not yet . They were holding two men in Ohio , but they let them go . They weren ’ t the criminals after all . 
 Here ’ s the paper ; you can read them yourself . 
 Just a minute . It ’ s ten to nine by my watch . 
 What ’ s the hurry ? 
 It ’ s plenty of time yet . The railway station is very close . It won ’ t take your twenty minutes to get there . 
 Not tonight . I promised to go to a concert with my sister . 
 That sounds fine . 
 I'll be there . You're still a fabulous cook , aren't you ? 
 I'm ready . I'll look forward to it all Friday ! 
 Do you have an appointment ? 
 Yes , we do . I can cut your hair right now if you like.Do you need a shampoo too , or just a haircut ? 
 Alright . I will have an assistant wet your hair . Then I can cut it.Please step over there.How would you like your hair cut today ? 
 I recommend you leave it a little long on top.But we should take in the back and sides a bit more . That's more fashionable now . 
 So I will cut the sides just above the ear . Is that good ? 
 And do you usually part your hair along here ? 
 Alright , I know just what to do.Your hair seems quite dry , you know . And I see some split ends . 
 The problem is the split ends . They make your hair look even more frizzy . 
 Well , there are two things you can do.First , don't blow-dry your hair for so long after you shower . Let it dry naturally.That is easier on the hair , so you won't get split ends.Second , buy a g 
 Of course . I have one I can suggest . 
 The problem is the split ends . 
 Good morning . Yes , I am . But I ’ m sorry I don ’ t think I know you . 
 Oh , yes . We do have such a commercial . Sit down , please , Miss Liu . I ’ m glad to see you . Could you tell me about yourself first ? 
 Could you tell me about your work experience ? 
 Do you enjoy your work ? 
 Well , according to your experience , perhaps you could tell me what essential qualities a personnel department office clerk should maintain . 
 Good . Go on , please . 
 Anything else ? 
 Good . The work includes keeping the files . Have you got any practical experience with that ? 
 What can I do for you today ? 
 Can I do anything else for you ? 
 We don ’ t allow people to check out magazines . 
 It ’ s just a policy of ours . 
 You may check out books or videos . 
 You will have to just read it in the library . 
 What do you think of being a secretary ? 
 How come ? 
 Shall we go to cinema this evening ? The new blockbuster starring mel gibson is showing . It ’ s supposed to be really good . 
 It ’ s a thriller . It has Julia Roberts playing the female lead . 
 What did the critic say ? 
 The movie starts at eight o ’ clock , so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready . 
 I won ’ t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . There were a few surprises . 
 Yes . What kept you from arriving on time ? 
 I realize that everyone has emergencies ; just get here on time from now on . 
 I appreciate you saying that and would like you to join us in our meeting . 
 Wonderful , does anyone have any questions about this project ? 
 I'm glad that some of you get it , but let's go over it once more . 
 What for ? ( Why ? ) 
 Yeah . I met him yesterday.He ' s no longer the same young man as he was eight years ago . 
 I haven't met the Smiths for a long time . 
 Why ? 
 Did you need help with something ? 
 I can help you with that . 
 I work here . 
 May I see your ID ? 
 All right , here is your ballot card . 
 Go to a voting booth and vote . 
 May I take the liberty to introduce myself to you ? My name is Dick Brown . I am the sales manager of our company . 
 How do you do ? 
 Which airport , ma'am ? 
 All right , ma'am . Need any help with your luggage ? 
 Accounting , this is Mike . 
 Goodness ! It ’ s been so long I actually forgot . Let me see ... yes , it is on my calendar . 
 Right , see you then ! 
 I don't know exactly . I only hear it's financed by a famous film star . 
 Yes , so it really doesn't matter who offers the money.The paper itself is profitable . 
 I'm so relieved . I just passed the bar exam . 
 That's an understatement . I'm on cloud nine . I couldn't be any happier . 
 Not yet . I didn't get a hold of them . I'll try to call them again tonight . 
 I think so . It's turning out to be a great day . 
 Tell me where you need to get on at . 
 If you don't mind walking , I know a bus you can take . 
 Walk all the way down Fair Oaks , and catch the 267 on Altadena Drive . 
 You have to catch it going west . 
 You need to get off on the corner of Del Mar and Hill . 
 It was my pleasure . 
 Yes , please . That would be a great help . Are you sure you don ’ t mind ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 No , there ’ s no need . 
 No , don ’ t bother . It ’ s all right as it is . 
 Yes . He is an old man with a great sense of humour . Not only can he play the piano , he also draws pictures very well . 
 Yeah , he has no children , so he sometimes feel s very lonely . I often go to his house to play and talk with him . That makes him feel very happy . 
 Yeah . How's everything going ? 
 Just alive ? I guess you are some lucky guy . I heard you are going out with Jane . 
 Oh , come on . Jane is a very nice girl , someone you meet only once till lifetime . 
 Well , I really envy you for finding such a nice girl . 
 It's about two or there blocks away from here . 
 It'll take you about 15 minutes . 
 Tom , You're back , come in please.How are you ? 
 You'll recover after a good night's sleep . 
 That's all right.Would you have a cup of coffee ? 
 Don't mention it . 
 It's my pleasure . 
 Thank you.Thank you for the trouble you've taken . 
 Did you watch TV last night , Rose ? 
 What was it about ? 
 If so , we may live there someday . 
 Sure . I heard about this on the TV . On January 3rd , 2004 , Explorer Spirit landed near the so-called Guser Crater . And three weeks later , Spirit's twin explorer , Opportunity , landed on Meridian Planum named by scientists . 
 May I have two tickets for Tiny Times ? 
 2:30 , please . 
 Sorry , we have student cards . We can get discounts with these , can't we ? 
 Here is 50 yuan . 
 No , thank you . Just the check . 
 No , it is my treat . 
 Yes , I owed you for last time . 
 Hello , thanks for calling 123 Tech Help , I ’ m Todd . How can I help you ? 
 It ’ s okay sir , calm down . What happened ? 
 Ok , sir , it sounds like you might have a virus . 
 No , your computer might have a virus , I mean , it has a bad program on it . Maybe that ’ s why it crashed . I recommend that you run an antivirus program in order to safely remove any unwanted spyware or Trojans . 
 I am sorry , but I cannot stay for the rest of class today . 
 I don ’ t feel so good . 
 I feel as if I am going to be sick to my stomach . 
 I have some medicine at home that I could take . 
 Thank you , but my friend is in the library , and he can give me a ride home . 
 Okay , next question . If Eric asked you out on a date , what would you say ? 
 Let ’ s see ... If I won the lottery , I would buy two tickets for a trip around the world . 
 My dad will freak out if I even mention a trip like that ! 
 If I told her that , she would faint and have me committed ! 
 I need ten 55 cents stamps and ten 32 cents stamps , please . 
 Yes , I need to send the payment to immigration for my aunt's citizenship application . They won't accept checks.How do I send the money ? 
 Then I need a money order for 250 dollars . 
 Thank youse much for all your help . 
 You , too . 
 My pleasure . How do you want me to do it ? 
 Ready ? Say cheese . 
 Hello , have a seat . I ’ m Bill Gotcha . I am assuming you found your way here with no trouble ? 
 I am curious as to why you want to leave your current employer . 
 Do you feel that you are exceptionally good at anything in particular . 
 What are you not good at ? 
 We appreciate hearing that about you ! 
 Yes , do you have an appointment ? 
 Well . The doctor doesn't see nobody without an appointment . 
 Oh , I see . Maybe we can fit you in at 3 . 
 Oh , why didn't you say it's an emergency ? Here , fill out this form and take a seat . I'll send you in next.You don't have insurance ? 
 How about traveler's insurance ? 
 Can you pay cash , then ? 
 All right , all right , relax . I am only trying to do my job . 
 How is your appetite today ? 
 What would you like to have ? 
 Which would you rather have , beef or chicken ? 
 How about drinks ? Coffee or tea ? 
 Do you want to take milk and sugar ? 
 I am looking for a blouse . Can you show me the way , please ? 
 I have no idea . Could you recommend me one ? 
 Well , the style is quite good , but I think it's too showy . I would like to try on the lighter one . 
 I don ’ t feel so good . I am feeling sick to my stomach . 
 I had fried shrimp and clams for lunch . 
 Perhaps , but I haven ’ t felt well for a few days now . 
 My stress level is pretty much what is usually is . 
 It seems to me like I may have caught a bug . 
 Most women love red roses for their birthday . 
 You can get a dozen for only $ 20 . 
 You're in luck today because the roses are on sale . 
 Very good . Perhaps you'd like something else to go with the roses ? 
 Women love roses , so your wife will be very happy . 
 I'm still a student . 
 Boston University . 
 I'm studying English , math , and history . My major is English . 
 More than six years . 
 Yeah , I started to learn English when I was in high school . 
 Actually , it's not that good . I can read but I can't speak very well . I haven't had a lot of chance to practice . 
 Yes , but I still don't have many friends here yet . 
 Oh thanks for inviting me . I'd love to come . 
 I'd like to withdraw some money from my account . 
 Well , actually , it's quite a substantial amount . Here's my Bank Book . Will that cause a problem ? 
 Yes , that seems to be all in order . Thanks very much . 
 Things are going good today . How have you been doing , Mary ? 
 Want to go see a movie tonight ? 
 Could you go with me to the movies on Friday night , instead ? 
 There is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer . 
 Oh great ! Sounds like something I need to bring Kleenex to ! 
 What's on tonight ? 
 Who is in this movie ? 
 Have you got any outdoor interests ? 
 Oh , I know it . It is included in extreme sports . I think it's too dangerous for me . 
 Good afternoon , sir . Have you made a reservation ? 
 I don't think so . You have to wait for about 10 minutes . 
 The language used in this multinational company is mainly about English ; do you think you can manage to handle that ? 
 What about your second foreign language since you were an English major ? 
 What prompted you to apply to this company ? 
 Why do I have to hire you ? 
 Could you tell me the time ? 
 What time is it , please ? 
 I've had enough of that ! 
 I hate the hero.He ' s too cruel . 
 Can we talk ? 
 You know what I mean . 
 I want to know where this relationship is going . I ’ m in love with you and I need to know ... 
 I ’ m awesome . Well , I guess that ’ s my answer , isn ’ t it . 
 Look , if you don ’ t love me , it ’ s not a thing , alright , we ’ Ve had our laughs , but I don ’ t appreciate ... maybe it ’ s just time we ... 
 You do ? 
 Oh , I love you too ! 
 Oh baby , I ’ m so sorry . 
 Surely of course . 
 Yes . How long would you like us to keep it ? 
 Owl ! I've twisted my ankle . I slipped on that greasy patch over there . I don't think it's broken but it really hurts . 
 Have you seen that house ? 
 You're right . I love it very much . 
 At least more than 100 years old . 
 I can't open the door . 
 Let me ask the old woman in that reception office . 
 She must be deaf . 
 Frightened ? You must be joking . 
 Yeah . Dig my new pants ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 No . Mine are a soft brown . Yours are khaki . 
 I hear you're going to Tainan to visit your uncle . 
 Well , say hello to him for me . 
 That ’ s great . Is the electrician here today ? 
 You ’ re right . I wasn ’ t . I hear nothing . 
 Not a sound on the city streets , just the beat of my own heart , I think that ’ s how it goes , something like that . 
 Engaged ? 
 Are you crazy ? 
 Can you skillfully operate the computer ? 
 What kind of software can you use ? 
 Do you have any certificates on computer ? 
 Any other certificates ? 
 Do you have any other special skills ? 
 What do you think of the Olympic motto ' Higher , faster and stronger ' ? 
 Why ? In my opinion , it doesn't matter whether you won or not . The most important thing is participation . 
 Can you offer the Five Insurances for me ? 
 How are they get paid ? 
 Well , you seem to enjoy speaking English . 
 I hope so.You see , at the moment I find it difficult to get used to the teacher's speed and accent . I'm awfully worried , I can't reply as quickly as she seems to expect . 
 You know , speaking in class is a very good chance to put your English to practical use . 
 Yes , it has great curb appeal . 
 Yes , it is nice , but wait until you see the interior . 
 The carpeting and paint are all new , as well as the window treatments . 
 Come and see the kitchen . 
 Let ’ s go check out the bedroom and bathroom . 
 I am happy that you like the house . We should write down what we like so that we can remember it . 
 Thank you . How much is it ? 
 Here ’ s 30 yuan . 
 Oh , hi Pam . When did you get back from Canada ? How was it ? 
 Which city did you like better ? 
 And what's Montreal like ? What did you think of it ? 
 Which one has better nightlife ? 
 Well , I've always wanted to see Vancouver . I've heard it has the most beautiful views . 
 OK ... just grab it right out of my hands ... 
 That piece fits on to your ear . It hooks right on . And you just put the other one in your other ear . 
 What do you do now ? 
 Why ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . 
 What's your plan now ? 
 Best wishes for you . 
 Waiter , show me the menu , please . 
 I'll have the baked salmon . 
 I'd rather have broccoli . 
 Yes , I'd like another cup of coffee . 
 Excuse me , what's the charge for a picture ? 
 That's great . Give me the landscape of the Triumphal for the background . 
 Hi , I am so glad to see you . 
 You know , I'm about to graduate and I have to look for a job as soon as possible . But I haven ’ t the faintest idea of how to go about finding a job . 
 I guess first I should prepare a resume , right ? 
 Then what else should I put into my resume ? 
 I got it . Then I should mention my educating background and working experience , should I ? 
 I see . Is that all there is to it ? 
 Oh , good point . You mean here I should show off my special skills and talents to impress the boss . 
 That's easy . 
 And lots of Dear Abby sob stories ... 
 No wonder you're such a wacko ... 
 Nice . Hey , I like the layout of this page ... 
 I ’ ll need to meet with you before you go on vacation , Alex . I have a few things to clear up . 
 That ’ s fine . I can make that . 
 Come on.Plenty of room upstairs.Fares please ! 
 One dollar ... I'm short of change this morning . 
 Good , here's your ticket and four dollars change . 
 OK , so are you ready to learn how to bake a cake ? 
 OK , so the first thing we are going to do is pre-heat the oven , that way we have it at the desired temperature once we finish preparing everything . Set it to three hundred and seventy five degrees Fahrenheit . 
 No we are gonna make the batter . Take some butter and sugar and mix it lightly until you have a nice consistency . Then add some vanilla extract and eggs and continue mixing . 
 Go ahead and use the mixer , but put it on medium speed . I'm gonna sift the flour and baking powder separately and then we can mix it with milk and the rest of the ingredients . 
 Yeah , but grease and flour it first so the cake won't stick to it when it bakes . 
 We can leave it in there for about twenty five minutes . Then we let it cool for ten minutes before we remove the cake from the pan . 
 I am here to sign my escrow papers . 
 Should I have brought anything with me ? 
 Where do I start ? 
 Can I make a phone call to a friend if I have a question ? 
 Will the house be mine when we finish these documents ? 
 Come on , darling.We haven't got much time . 
 Half past six ... and it's half past six already . 
 We haven't . Hurry up ! 
 And about time too . 
 Yes , I ’ d like to buy this dress , please . 
 Great . 
 I want to use a credit card . Do you take Discover ? 
 I ’ ll put it on my Visa card , then . 
 There must be something wrong with the system . Try my MasterCard . 
 Sure . 
 Thanks . You have a good one , too . 
 Hello . I'd like to open a Foreign Currency Account . 
 Oh dear . I wanted AUD . Is that not possible ? 
 Maybe I'll go for the US dollar account . 
 They are made a town nearby . The flower vases are made of porcelain and covered with tiny bamboo sticks . 
 No . They are not only ornamental , but also useful . 
 Last week , we had a performance review on all the staff in our department in last quarter . Stevens , can you provide more information about the performance review ? 
 They are popular in and out of our department . Fred is easygoing , while David is cautious in working . 
 So , I want to recommend them for a raise . Fred is promoted to be the assistant of manager in marketing department and David to be director of office . 
 I have just checked in this afternoon . I am wondering what shall I do if I want to have some clothes washed . 
 That's convenient.Thank you . 
 Yes , I'm looking for a book on Chinese history . 
 Why don't you find someone who is in the know . 
 Did you ask his former sectary , Lora ? She knows a lot about him . 
 Bill , I have received the admission letter from Cambridge University ! 
 How about you ? Have you got any news from university ? 
 I am glad you can study something you really like ! 
 That's a secret . 
 Sure , anything else ? 
 OK . Here you are . 
 You can count on it . 
 I like him.He ' s good for her . 
 What are you waiting for ? Get on that bus quickly . 
 On the bus . The driver collects the fares . You'll have to take your luggage on board . 
 Hello . Could I speak to Justin , please ? 
 Oh , hi Justin . This is Karen Hepburn.We met at Chris and Jim's party . 
 Great . Uh , Justin , would you like to see Otis Lesley on Thursday night ? He's at the Kangaroo Club . 
 Oh ... that's too bad . 
 Actually , are you doing anything on Friday or Saturday ? He's playing those two nights as well . 
 At eight sharp.How about meeting in front of the club at about a quarter after seven ? 
 Sure ! 
 Mary , besides the resume , I think we should also write an application letter . 
 I think we should begin the letter with a salutation , and the salutation must be very formal . 
 We should say we are very interested in that job , and we hope to get that job . 
 For example , I have mastered Business English very well , and I also know a little Spanish . 
 You can say you have had a firm grasp of the professional knowledge , and you can communicate with others proficiently in English . 
 Let's write it at once . 
 No , I'll have the fish please . 
 No , I want the fish . 
 Thank you , but I prefer the fish 
 No , I like the fish . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Yes.There are two colors . 
 Yes . 
 Anything else ? 
 Good afternoon.Welcome to China.May I see your passport , customs and health declaration form ? 
 Thank you.What ' s your occupation , Mr . Smith ? 
 You are here on business , aren't you ? 
 I see.Do you have anything to declare ? 
 Would you please fill out this currency declaration form ? It's a record of the foreign currency you have brough in . 
 Excuse me . Do you mind if I try this on ? 
 Thanks . It's a little tight . Do you have any in a larger size ? 
 Yes . Also , I'm not so sure about the color . 
 Where would you like to have your dinner ? 
 You don't like Western food ? 
 Do you know where I can find old music boxes ? 
 What's that ? I've never heard of such a thing . 
 OK , Where can I find one ? 
 Mr . Smith is really a thorough drag . 
 He's endless talking about stocks almost bores me to death . 
 I'm not at all keen on this subject . 
 Yes , Madam . It is at the entrance . 
 Okay . Follow me please . 
 In aisle 3 . 
 Oh , yes please ! I'd love a gin and tonic . 
 Oh , just olives please . What music is this ? 
 It's great ! Where did you get the CD ? 
 Yes . I buy a lot of stuff from there . It's a good shop , isn't it ? 
 Why not ? I'd love to ! 
 Yes . I'm afraid so . 
 Oh . Well , it can't be helped . 
 thanks . This is my power suit . I have a dinner date tonight . 
 she's a friend of Amy . We met at Amy's birthday party . 
 yes . I hope it pans out . Cross your fingers , Lily . 
 oh ... so you buried the hatchet with Steven ? 
 then who will you meet tonight ? 
 really ? Are you sure this is a good idea ? 
 I know , but remember to meet in a public place and don't give out your personal information . 
 Yes , and I am very satisfied with it . 
 Would you please tell me about fringe benefits of the company ? 
 What do they include ? 
 That sounds great . 
 The fringe benefits in your company are excellent , and it's generous of you to offer five insurances and one fund 
 I want to know if the staff can get a vacation every year . 
 That's quite good . Thank you for telling me about those . 
 Of course . Here you are . Can I take your order now ? 
 All right . Can I serve you anything else ? 
 You've got it , sir . 
 I sure did . You're in luck ! It's supposed to snow all week in the mountains ! 
 It is kind of strange though , to have snow in April , and so much of it . 
 When you put it that way , I guess the skies can't hold out on us forever . 
 It will be the best as long as the weatherman is right . 
 Tell me about it . If I was as small as her , I wouldn't think about going on a diet . 
 That's because you don't exercise . If you were more active , you wouldn't have a dieting problem . 
 I'm not on a diet though . 
 I like ice cream too much though . 
 It does sound appealing . 
 Okay . I'm in . Let's do it . 
 Can we start tomorrow though ? 
 I've already forgiven you . Actually , I also owe you an apology . I was so rude to you that day . 
 Thanks for your understanding . 
 Marco has fallen off a ladder . I think he's hurt his back . What shall we do ? 
 You stink ! 
 What in the world is that smell ? 
 Smells like you're baking something . What are those ? 
 Cool ! But isn't that a hot air popcorn popper ? 
 The beans will burn . I know . I've tasted burnt coffee before ... yuck ! 
 I was playing a joke on you . 
 Dear , forgive me . I won ’ t do that again . 
 Oh . Hi Matt . I went snowboarding yesterday and my whole body aches . 
 Yeah . And I never want to go again . 
 That's exactly how I feel now . 
 Ha . There won't be a next time . 
 I'll think about it after I start feeling better . Right now , I don't even want to hear the word snowboarding . 
 I'd like to look at your stereo systems . Do you have anything on sale ? 
 But it doesn't have a turntable . I have a fair number of vinyl records , so I need something to play them on . 
 How old is Keith ? 
 He's a year older than Keith , but he looks younger . 
 He's fine . He retired last week . It's a turning point in his life . Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement . 
 Oh , I don't think he wants to . He wants to travel to several different countries around the world . 
 How do you want to spend your old age ? 
 Name and examination number , please . 
 What part of the country do you come from ? 
 Where is it ? 
 Do you have a big family at your hometown ? 
 Are you married ? 
 What happened ? 
 Let's stop and have a look . 
 I'm curious about that . 
 What do you think of the coming match ? 
 You are bragging again . 
 Yes , I know and I like it very much . I will take it . 
 How long is this cell phone guaranteed ? 
 Good morning , is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Yes , what size do you want ? 
 No problem . Come and get your picture on Friday . 
 I know , it's not as I had planned . 
 I'll speak to Bob , he'll be able to help us . 
 I would like to cancel one of my accounts . 
 I only need one . 
 Could you please transfer that money to my remaining account ? 
 I appreciate it . 
 That ’ s all for today . 
 I greatly appreciate your help . 
 At what address , sir ? 
 O . K . Your name please ? 
 One moment please . Very well , Mr . Smith . I need to ask you a few questions . 
 The interview will take about 15 minutes , and your phone will be turned on in 24 hours . 
 O . K . Mr . Smith . Thanks for calling . 
 Okay . I'm going to stay up a while . I've got to go over the household budget . We've sightly overspent this month . 
 But I'm not sleepy , darling . I want to finish it today . 
 Okay . Good night . Have a good dream . 
 My wife is in labor ! 
 Is Doctor Hawkins here ? She ’ s our doctor . We called her from the car . 
 Thanks . Sorry . It just came as such a surprise . The baby isn ’ t due for another two weeks . 
 About fifteen minutes . 
 Yes . 
 Hello , welcome to Credit Services . How can we help you ? 
 Are you an existing customer ? 
 May I ask why you didn't think of applying for a credit card with us sooner ? Most young people jump at the chance . 
 That's very sensible of you . We have many fresh graduates applying for credit cards , getting them and then going on a spending spree and being unable to meet the repayments . 
 I've been thinking about getting my hair cut . 
 I said that , didn't I ? But I just don't know what to do with it . 
 Yes , it's not short enough to be wash-and-go and not long enough to do anything fancy . 
 Everywhere I go ? 
 Would you mail a letter for me ? My hands are full . 
 That ’ s fine . We ’ re going to drop in and see Jimmy tonight . Don ’ t forget it . 
 Thanks . See you . 
 How can I lose weight , doctor ? I seem to get fatter even when I just look at food ? 
 I never eat breakfast though . 
 I never thought about it that way . 
 Oh doctor , I feel so foolish . 
 I know doctor , thank you so much . 
 I'm glad too . Steven , I want to tell you that I'm going to divorce my wife . 
 We don't get along well with each other and fight a lot . 
 That isn't true . Actually , we have been separated for six months . 
 Thank you , Steven . I accept your advice . 
 I'm glad too . Steven , I want to tell you that I'm going to divorce my wife . 
 We don't get along well with each other and fight a lot . 
 That isn't true . Actually , we have been separated for six months . 
 Thank you , Steven . I accept your advice . 
 yes , I can still recall the days when we were all seniors at college . I asked you whether you would go back to your hometown or not . 
 congratulations ! I hope when you hold the wedding ceremony , I ’ m still residing in Beijing . 
 no , I ’ m planning to quit this job and go back to work in my hometown after the spring festival . 
 well , I still can ’ t adjust to the fast pace of city life . 
 that ’ s right . I work extremely hard , and try my best to adapt to the lifestyle here , but I don ’ t feel any sense of belonging here . 
 yeah , I think so . 
 What kind of benefits are we talking about ? 
 Are these things negotiable ? 
 Vacation time is important to me . I would be willing to give up these other items in order to receive more vacation days . 
 Possibly . What do you have in mind ? 
 My stomach hurts , Doctor . 
 Yes . 
 I have had it on and off for the past three years . It's just gotten much worse these past two weeks . 
 After I've eaten , it goes away for a while . 
 Yes , occasionally . 
 I think so . 
 Is it serious ? 
 Are you aware of the reason why I pulled you over ? 
 I pulled you over because your brake light is out . 
 I have to write you a ticket . 
 I'm not going to be able to do that . 
 You'll find that out on your court date . 
 That's how it works . 
 Earning extra income on the Internet is easier than you might think . After I started selling traditional craft items on the Internet last year , I have really been able to make bank doing something I love . 
 To run a successful internet business , it requires a little research and relatively small investment . You've got to have a good idea of some kind of product that is in demand or would be popular . 
 After you have your great idea , then you can set up shop by registering a domain name , creating a website , an email address , and a hosting service . If you want to go all out on your website , you can put together shopping cart technology , but that can be pricey to start out with . 
 Anything worth doing takes work . Money doesn't grow on trees ... Most of us have to work for it . 
 Why don't you try an Americano ? Espresso with water . 
 Go with a hammerhead then-espresso mixed with drip coffee . 
 Don't worry , James . We'll get this case worked out in no time . 
 I know you , Zina . You're only nice when you want something . 
 To be honest , I'm starting to wonder if it's worth it . 
 You said it , not me . 
 I love just about anything by Prince . 
 well , I like all kinds of music , but he is one of my favorites . How about you ? 
 do you have a favorite band ? 
 do you often go to concerts ? 
 I love going to live gigs . Are there any good local bands playing around here that you'd recommend ? 
 I'd love to , but I have a night class on Thursdays . 
 let me know if you hear about any good bands playing on the weekends . I have more free time then . 
 sure , what's on ? 
 that sounds dreadful ! 
 Hi , Mary . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve got a meeting in a minute . 
 Right . I ’ ll see you later . 
 Peter , it's time to get up . 
 What time is it now ? 
 Well , honey , wake up , or you'll be late for school . 
 What are you thinking of getting ? 
 You can get a burger , or some Chinese food . Or maybe you can get some Mexican food . 
 Where are you going to get your Chinese food from ? 
 When I want Chinese food , I go to Panda Express . 
 The food isn't bad there . 
 Can I see your parents some time tomorrow ? 
 How about this weekend ? 
 I'm going over to the gym . I want to do some running . 
 Are you kidding ? Do you know how cold it is today ? 
 No , it's not . Not at all . I'd probably freeze my lungs . 
 You ? 
 I didn't know you could exercise . 
 Yeah , I know . But you ? I always thought you were only good at lifting beer bottles to your mouth . 
 You're going to lift weights ? Hah ! 
 I'm sorry . I just can't imagine you lifting weights . 
 It's true . If a person doesn't exercise , they get sluggish.That ' s why I keep running . Even in the winter . 
 But lifting weights isn't the best thing.You should do some kind of aerobic exercise . 
 It sounds like a good plan to me . I'm still ... I mean ... 
 I'm still just surprised you really want to do it.It doesn't seem to go with your character . 
 I don't have time to talk to her now . 
 Thank you . 
 Yeah , yeah , we ’ re here because we feel this is an injustice ! The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop ! We ’ re there to show the government that we don ’ t like the way that they ’ re spending our tax dollars ! 
 It ’ s an absolute outrage , Sarah , the US government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers ’ money to the auto industry . These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt . 
 That maybe true , and I for one don ’ t want to see anyone lose their job , but how can these Ces ask for a bailout when they ’ re making millions of dollars ? And then , they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets ! This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars ! And they ’ re asking for money ! That is just not right ! 
 Did you pack this bag yourself ? Has it been out of your possession at any time before checking-in ? 
 Are you bringing in any plants or animal products ? 
 Our sniffer dog seems to disagree . Do you mind if we look in your suitcase ? 
 What ’ s this sir ? 
 What are these red things sir ? 
 I ’ m sorry sir , but you can ’ t take any of this into the country . We will also have to check your carry-on . Please step this way . Don ’ t ’ be nervous ; we ’ ll just look through it briefly and then 
 Enough is enough . I know . 
 It was great . I had a really good time . 
 Well , I had English from 9 o'clock to 11 o'clock , art from 12 o'clock to 2 o'clock , and math from 2 o'clock to 4 o'clock . 
 To be honest , I liked all of them , except for the math teacher . Though he must be quite young , he seem like an old person . He ’ s so boring ! 
 She was great . In today ’ s class , she gave us a lecture on how to be a good student . She told us not to arm for exams , and to pay more attention on communicating than memorizing . 
 She said that she ’ s from a small town in the middle of America . 
 Not everything , but nearly . She speaks very clearly and doesn ’ t use very complex words so that it is easy for us to understand her . 
 Yes ... with flying colors ! 
 It ’ s a new phrase that she taught us today . It means that I will not only pass the class , but I will do extremely well ! 
 I hope so . 
 not today . She said she wanted us to relax tonight instead of doing homework , 
 Thanks for offering to give me a lift . I ’ m looking forward to this party , but I didn ’ t want to go alone . 
 No , this is my first.Last week I went to a cookout for new professors at Dean Barksdale ’ s home . I took a taxi because I didn ’ t want to be late.But I was the first one 
 Thanks for telling me this . 
 Why are you in such a hurry ? They said , Dinner at eight , and it ’ s only seven-fifteen . I don ’ t want to be the first one there again . 
 so , how's your course going ? Do you like it ? 
 what are you specializing in ? 
 that sounds really interesting . Can you speak Swahili ? 
 really ? How did you do that ? 
 that's amazing . Are you doing well in your classes ? 
 when did you take your exams ? 
 how do you think you did ? 
 I'm sure you'll do well . Did you study hard ? 
 don't worry . If you don't do well , no one can ! 
 Karen ? I need to go over a few things with you . 
 I was thinking about this afternoon , after the sales meeting . 
 I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment . 
 Yes . I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on . 
 Yes , I want to get a better job . 
 I'm quitting because of the lousy salary and all the difficulties I have in getting along with my colleagues . 
 I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We're going to travel south to find jobs that offer higher pay . 
 How could you handle living in such a big family ? Does everyone get along ? 
 In such a big family , there must be a head . Who's the head of your family ? 
 Is a family like yours common in South Korea ? 
 My family setup is a bit different . In New York city , there're only three people , my mother , my stepfather and me . During this summertime , I fly out to California and live with my dad . Dad's getting 
 To be blunt , maybe I won't be able to get along with his new wife or her kids . 
 But four boys ! 
 You are right , I guess.The world keeps changing , and so do families . But I like a small-sized or medium-sized family where everybody is equal to everybody else . That's what I want . 
 That's a great idea ! 
 That sounds like an excellent offer . I might take you up on that . Thank you for the wonderful invitation . 
 I'll have to sleep on it . 
 Yes , she is . 
 No , she is an English teacher . 
 You mean the man wearing jeans ? He ’ s her little brother . 
 Yes I do , usually . 
 I don't like spending time on commercials.There ' re too many commercials on TV . 
 Never . But I have been looking forward to it for quite a long time . 
 It's 2065 meters . Come on . Let us keep up the pace . 
 Of course not , help yourself . 
 I have a test tomorrow . 
 Yes , of course . There are many steps . You can apply for the job on the Internet and then send your resume to the e-mail address of the company . And wail the feedback of the company . 
 You must have over 2 years'experience first . 
 Generally speaking , you are supposed to come at 9:00 am . 
 You should start from 1:30 pm in the afternoon . 
 But I like its color . 
 I'll take one , too . 
 Here you are . 
 Thank you . Where can I put my suitcase ? 
 Everyone's attention , please . We are going to take off . Please fasten your belts . 
 Hi . Steven . I just drop in and want to have a chat with you . 
 OK . ( Sit on the sofa ) Wow ! Your house was decorated so beautiful . 
 She must have done a lot of work on it . 
 Which sports are popular in your country ? 
 Do many people like tennis ? 
 In my country , many people enjoy golf , but it is too expensive for some people . A few people like extreme sports , but I think the vast majority of people are afraid to try them . 
 I know loads of people who play it regularly . There are plenty of golf courses around the country . In the past , only a tiny number of people played . 
 There are plenty of rugby fans in my country too . 
 It fits fine . I ’ ll take it . How much is it ? 
 Do you take credit cards ? 
 Great . Here's my Visa Credit Card . 
 Thank you . 
 I'm afraid we'll be late for the party . 
 Yes , my watch says a quarter to seven . but there is something wrong with my watch ! 
 Yes , but ever since I bought it , it gains about five minutes a day , so I ' Ve got to have it repaired . 
 I think about ten minutes by bus . 
 Wait ! I think I see a bus coming now . Let's hope it's the No . 22 bus . 
 He had a lot of nerve telling us our ads sucked . 
 When did you start worrying about your weight ? 
 No , Jess , chill out ! 
 My country is well know for being very flat . There are some hills in the southeast of the country . 
 Pretty much . The land rises and falls only a few meters . The southeast , the hills rise to a height of a few hundred meters . There are mountains over 1000 meters high in your country . 
 The coast of your country is very varied . The coast of my country is just made up of sandy beaches . 
 There are many lakes and rivers in your country too . We also have many rivers , but only a few lakes . 
 I ’ m really glad I got a chance to talk to you before you left , Mary . Have a safe trip ! 
 Yeah , I ’ ll try not to ! See you after Christmas . 
 Excuse me , Sir , do you know what time it is ? 
 Thank you . 
 Yeah . I was in a hurry and I forgot my umbrella today . 
 Oh , that ’ s very kind of you . I am going to the Garden Hotel . 
 Sure . 
 What's the occasion ? You won the lottery ? 
 Well , I am kind of broke . 
 Really ? It's very nice of you . 
 Wonderful ! You know what ? I wish you wanted to relax everyday . 
 What kind of personality do you think you have ? 
 What makes you angry ? 
 This is my uncle , Charles . 
 He's a captain . 
 Exactly ! 
 Yes , several times . 
 Not bad . 
 Then , why didn't you do that ? 
 Some of them , I think , are not good . 
 No , I mean some of them are not clean enough . 
 I judge by appearances . 
 It certainly is . 
 Don't try everything at one time , please . 
 Can I reserve a room from the 13th to the 18th ? 
 I'd like a suite . What's the rate ? 
 John , it ’ s time to get up . 
 It is . Hurry up ! You ’ ll be late for school . 
 It ’ s nearly half past seven . 
 It ’ s slow . Hurry up ! The bus goes at twenty to eight . 
 Positive . I ’ ll put the radio on . 
 No , it isn ’ t . It ’ s stopped . I forgot to wind it up last night . 
 Are you ready , honey ? 
 Just dress formal . 
 It is too loud , we ’ ll handle some official business first before the dinner . 
 You can put on your white shoes , it fits every occasion . 
 That's true . During rush hours , taxis are just as quick as buses . 
 At least , it can free you from the crowd . By the way , do you come from China ? 
 Wow , like America . It receives a great number of visitors every year . 
 Well , known , Jim , I'm ... I'm pretty much in favour of your computers , I think computers teach kids to think , because they require logical thoughts . 
 What do you mean ? 
 That's not the gadgets . Creating programmes is stimulate thoughts . It engages their imagination and sharpen their mind . 
 Birds of a feather flock together . 
 What a wonderful neighborhood ! Can you find that house on our Open House list ? 
 They always make the front yards look so great for Open Houses . Let ’ s see what the inside looks like . 
 Signing the registry is a good idea . I think I want to see the kitchen next . 
 I need to pick up a flyer with the information about the house on it . 
 The asking price has recently gone down to two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars . 
 If you tell me the exact problem , I can be more helpful . 
 Allow me to apologize . I'll give you another room right now , and a full refund for tonight . 
 Sir , only your mother wants to please you more than we do . 
 Yes . I want to apply for the accountant in your corporation and I think it is not beyond attainment . 
 Yes , of course . In accounting , cash means all items that are acceptable for depositing in a bank . 
 Of course not . Just tell me how to operate it . 
 I know . Hold your position and say cheese . 
 Hey , Peter , have you had lunch yet ? 
 Not yet . Let's go to that restaurant on the corner . 
 Count me out . 
 No , I ‘ Ve been waiting for ages . 
 Yes , me too . I think I ’ Ve lost some important clients recently because of this train ! 
 Oh look ! Here it comes now ! 
 Hi , could you help me ? I need to make a dinner reservation . 
 Tuesday night is when we need the reservation for . 
 7 
 We need a reservation for four . 
 My last name is Foster . Thank you for the reservation . 
 We will be there ! Thanks for the help ! 
 Never ! He ’ s over 80 , isn ’ t he ? 
 Good gracious ! Are you sure ? 
 Is she really ? 
 Really ? Quite a woman , isn ’ t she ? 
 Yes , could you cash these travaler's check for me , please ? 
 Ok , here you are . 
 It doesn't matter . 
 Much to my regret , I'll have to meet my girlfriend at the airport then . 
 Much as we'd like to , but we've booked up already for that time . 
 So sorry . Next time we'll go , thanks anyway . 
 to be honest , I wouldn't . 
 not really . But it has puzzled me for a long time . 
 my husband and I prefer to have no kids , but my mother-in-law is very traditional and wants grandkids . 
 yes . It seems she can never accept a childless marriage . We had a fight last night . 
 but it's absolutely our own business to have a child or not . 
 you know , I often overhear our neighbor , the young couple , fighting about how to raise their kid and I really don't want kids to spoil our happiness . 
 I guess you're right . But I still prefer to have no child . 
 How about going to the cinema tonight ? 
 I am not sure about the name of the film , but I know it's a romantic one . 
 Don't you think it's too bloody ? 
 Jack , let ’ s go ! 
 Some people are wildly shooting on the next street . We must leave here as soon as possible ! 
 Can you vouch for me that I was with you yesterday ? 
 My character is in question . Someone was robbed at work and unless I have an alibi , I'm a suspect . 
 My employer . Can you come in to the office tomorrow ? 
 That would be the real proof . Didn't we have to show ID to get on the plane ? 
 Do you have some questions ? 
 If you join us , our company will provide you a single dormitory . If you make great achievements , our company will offer you a flat according to the related regulations . It all depends . 
 Besides the official holidays , our company offers a ten days paid holiday every year , which makes it possible for you to visit your parents . Any other questions ? 
 Tell me about your brother and sister , Sue . 
 Really ? Does she live here in Seattle ? 
 Wow ! ! And what does your brother do ? 
 What an interesting family ! 
 I have chosen 15 candidates . The first round interview is tomorrow . 
 Right . We'll choose the 4 best candidates and have them come back for a second interview . The top one of them will be the one we will hire . 
 Fine , thanks . 
 I have some problem with my work . 
 I can solve it , thanks . 
 Everything is Okay . And as soon as I see my son at home , all my worries vanish into the blue . 
 Yes , you can take a limo , a tour bus or just walk . 
 $ 50 a day . 
 I expect to be paid according to my abilities . 
 That's a little less than I expected . But to me , the most important thing is the job and the people I will work with . Moreover , I am sure I will get a raise quickly depending on my background and experience . 
 By the way , how long is my probation ? 
 why are there still so many people overweight despite the current fitness craze ? 
 what are they ? 
 why ? 
 that makes sense . Probably less time to make dinner and the junk food is cheaper . 
 what's that ? 
 wow ! No wonder people are so fat . Say , Carl , looks like you could be doing a bit more exercising . 
 you should consider eating healthier food and getting some more exercise . 
 so what happened ? 
 you should have kept trying . 
 Yes , certainly . I'll be back in a minute . Here you are 
 Of course , not.Let me check.Oh , you seem bo be correct . 
 Only ten percent tax is included in the bill . 
 It sure does . 
 All of your coursework is important , including everything from attendance and homework to all of your test results for the semester . 
 All of it is important ; please just do your best at all times . 
 The final and mid-term are twenty percent each ; homework , attendance , and quizzes are the rest . 
 Make sure you contact me as I only allow one unexcused absence . 
 Your grade will not be a surprise ; you will know what you need to work on . 
 Oh , over there in Pacific Pavilion . 
 Yeah , that's it . 
 Mike , you're seventeen years old , right ? 
 You look quite mature beside your cousin who is eighteen . 
 Do you like reading magazines ? 
 Why ? 
 No , you can learn a lot from them . 
 Absolutely . And it's a good way to kill time during the tour . 
 Yes , I do . 
 Sure . Here you are . 
 Oh , thank you very much . 
 Yes , there's one just on the other side of this building . Do you have any small change ? 
 I'd like to reserve two seats for tomorrow night . 
 Isn't there anything less expensive ? 
 What would you like to drink ? Tea or coffee ? 
 So , you also like Coffee ? 
 Me too , but I think we shouldn't drink too much of it , as it's not very healthy . 
 But I also heard that coffee and its caffeine content , serve as a drug on the human body that negatively affects the central nervous system , as well as other organs , and leads to addiction 
 Well , I adjust going to have to disagree with you . A healthy body wakes up without caffeine ! 
 You may try to have some alternatives and see how you feel . 
 Could you copy this document for me ? 
 A hundred and fifty . No , wait , make that a hundred and sixty . 
 No , thank you . That will be all for now . 
 Last month , we only had 40 hits on our site . Our products and prices are good , but the problem is that no one knows about our website . 
 We need to maximize the chances that our site will be at the top of search engine lists , but I'm not sure how to do it . 
 Yeah , you're right . We've got to get the most popular phrases there ... How else can we boost site traffic ? 
 I guess we could also put out a few advertisements for our website inside of the search engine . I would like to find the most effective way to let people know about our site and our products . 
 Oh , really ? 
 Well , it's a good thing for you . 
 So you don't think you are fat and need to lose weight ? 
 junk food is not good for your health . Too much of it will make you fat . 
 Ok , but junk food has many disadvantages . As junk food contains high amount of oil and fat , you'll feel sleepy , but not be able to concentrate when you have a lot of it . 
 Let me see . You could exercise more to keep fit . 
 We'd like to invite you over for dinner this Friday evening . Can you come ? 
 Yes . We hope you'll be able to join us . 
 Good ! 
 How about 6:00 ? 
 Did you hear how cold it got last night ? 
 It was so cold this morning . I could hardly start my car . 
 Don't you have a garage ? 
 How much antifreeze did you put in your new car then ? You must have to keep it well below zero . 
 Does it ever get that cold on here ? 
 Speaking of cold , how about going for a cup of coffee to warm up . 
 Yes , and it's great . What are the events at the sports meeting ? 
 Our neighbor , Bruce , will take part in the relay race . Let's go have a look . 
 The competition will begin in 5 minutes , it's tense here . 
 Other competitors have almost caught up with him . They are neck and neck . 
 Wow , Bruce crossed the line first . 
 Hi , Mr . Smith . This is Mary . Is Jenny there ? 
 Yes , please tell her that band practice has been moved to Tuesday night at eight thirty . 
 No , but if she has any questions , she can call me at 555-2345 . 
 Thank you . Bye . 
 Excuse me ! Does this bus go to the railway station ? 
 OK ! Thank you very much ! 
 Come on , John . This is my favorite show . 
 Hello . Can I help you ? 
 Yes . We ’ ll close this position posting at the end of this month . 
 Go to the Human Resource Office , please . You can get it there . 
 It ’ s on the first floor , Room 120 . 
 Good luck . 
 Well , good morning , Tom . I haven't seen you for a long time . 
 What seems to be the trouble now ? 
 Have you been eating properly ? Eating the right kind of food is important for your health , you know . 
 And what about dinner ? 
 That's not good . You don't have a well-balanced diet . Have you been taking vitamin pills ? 
 Hello , Nancy , nice to see you . 
 Yes , I ’ m satisfied with this job . 
 Pay more attention to the external expressions , because they are important for the first impression . Good manner and style of conversation can let other feel your good self-cultivation . Good gestures and mien can let other feel very comfortable . 
 Don ’ t worry about that . You just pay more attention to the details of people ’ s action in life , and you will know how to transfer information by their body language . 
 I ’ m going to Hainan . 
 Yes , actually it ’ s my second visit . I was there last October . 
 Well , the life style is much more relaxed than here in the city . And the seafood is tastier ! 
 I'd like to meet you again sometime . 
 Anytime . You can reach me at 5558929 . 
 Fine . 
 Bye , Jason . 
 Thank you , Peter . 
 Happy birthday , Peter , and many happy returns of the day . Here's a present for you . 
 What wish do you make ? 
 Let me clear away the broken glass . 
 It's very careless of me to have broken your glass . 
 Am I allowed to check out at 14:00 ? 
 Will there be any late charge ? 
 Thank you . 
 That's all tight , Mr.Smith.That ' s my job . I'm very glad he recovered so soon . 
 No trouble at all . He's very cute and brave . By the way , do remember to keep him away from sea food for at least two weeks . 
 Have you decided what you ’ re going to do during your holiday ? 
 Wow , that sounds great ! Where are you going ? 
 Oh that will be lovely . You ’ ll be able to do lots of shopping I expect . 
 Great . Make sure you buy me a souvenir ! 
 How are we going to get there ? 
 How do we do timesheets here ? 
 Yes , I already have one . 
 I am kind of confused . 
 I'm not quite sure . 
 No , I have no idea what you are talking about . 
 Thanks for your help . 
 not a single email until now ? it's already twelve o'clock . I can't believe it ! 
 yeah , that's right . If no one sends me test messages , I'll go crazy . 
 addiction ? checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction ? no way ! 
 absolutely . 
 yeah , it's a must . Otherwise , I may miss important phone calls and text messages . 
 yes . MSN , QQ , Skype , Google Talk , Ali wangwang , everything , so that I'll be in touch with all friends and relatives . 
 Tom , Christmas Day is coming . Merry Christmas to you . 
 Hey Sarah , are you all right ? You look upset . 
 What happened ? 
 Who was chairing the meeting ? 
 Well , I can tell you from experience that Bob might come off a little strong sometimes . 
 What was the meeting about ? 
 It's ironic that the meeting was anything but efficient . 
 You have to keep things short and sweet . When you get a chance to speak , try not to get into too many unnecessary details . 
 You can always bring up the main points during the meeting and speak to those who are directly involved after the meeting . Not everyone needs to know all that information . 
 What did you cook ? 
 Great idea ! As long as I don't get food poisoning ! So what is on the menu tonight ? 
 This is delicious ! The ginger and lemongrass really gives it a nice taste ! 
 This is delicious ! The combination of sour and spicy is really interesting ! I could have this everyday ! 
 Wow , this is great ! I never knew Thai food was so creative and delicious ! 
 I'm stuffed ! 
 nothing but bench of commercials . These days the amount of commercials is amazing . 
 okay . Nope , it's a replay of yesterday's soccer match between Brazil and Spain . 
 alright . Hmm , this movie is a rerun ... I don't know how many times I've seen this show ... Commercial again ... and a replay of the talk show ... oh no , this show is terrible , you don't wanna watch it . 
 it's a total rip-off of an American reality show , but the imitation is unbearably clumsy . 
 yeah ... it seems what we have on TV now are either repeats , or commercials , or low-quality shows . There's really nothing to watch . 
 cool . 
 No , he's not . May I take a message ? 
 Yes , what's your name ? 
 Yeah , the new ones can be tricky . What are you trying to buy ? 
 Are you ready to go ? 
 The money goes in the slot over there . It has to be smooth to go in . 
 Just remember that you might have to feed the money in a couple of times to get it to work . 
 Make your selection and hope for the best . Vending machines aren't all that reliable . 
 You seem to have it down . Have a good day ! 
 Sorry , I can't dance . 
 Is it difficult to learn ? 
 How should I do ? 
 All right . By the way , do you often dance ? 
 It seems a good way . 
 What is it ? 
 That ’ s just the short in the arm we need . 
 It's a big bedroom with a drawing room , facing a beautiful wood . 
 No , but there is one downstairs , which my daughter used some years ago . 
 Certainly , you're welcome anytime . 
 ( after a while ) Good afternoon , Mrs . Smith . I called you just now . 
 Yes . 
 Wonderful ! A modest , comfortable room . Ah , a beautiful window , through which I can see a beautiful scene , and hear the birds singing . How nice ! 
 Excellent ! I like it ! When can I move in ? 
 OK . 
 Two . French and Spanish . 
 Well , French was my best subject at school . I can read and write it pretty well . 
 Well , it's not as good as my French . I can speak it reasonably well , but my written Spanish isn't very good . 
 In that case , I'm fit for the position I think . 
 I'm offering them to you at 150 yuan a piece . Is that all right ? 
 Yes . Our price can't be matched . 
 If you buy 1,000 or more , you'll get a 10 % discount . 
 I need a pan . 
 Well , the bigger the better , I think . 
 Yes , that is big enough , but it's too heavy for me . 
 Oh , this is nice and light . But it has an aluminum handle . 
 Oh , yes . This is very nice . I'll take this one . 
 Cash . Oh , I almost forgot . I need a lid , too . 
 I want to buy a shirt . 
 A white one , please . 
 What's the size ? 
 I think a medium one will do . 
 That's nice of you . 
 Wonderful . 
 umm ... yeah ! I ’ m looking for a nice gift to give my girlfriend . Our fifth anniversary ’ s next Friday . 
 No , not really ... I ’ m completely at a loss . 
 That purple one . I ’ m sorry ... I ’ Ve never bought jewellery for anyone and I ’ m kind of nervous . 
 Oh ... wow . That ’ s really pretty.Jess would love that . But ... I was thinking of something a little more delicate , perhaps a necklace ? 
 Jess ? Well , she ’ s very smart , and has a great sense of humor . She ’ s very feminine ... 
 Well ... actually ... I was thinking about asking Jess to marry me ... I ’ Ve just been so nervous . 
 Okay , I ’ Ve decided . I ’ m going to pop the question ! 
 Have you decided where to go for the vacation ? 
 Woo cool . Which mountain are you going to conquer ? 
 Of course , I will . 
 Yes , I know . The boarding time on the ticket says 17 
 Yes , It ’ s essential . 
 We can check it and hand carry small bags . And we have open each for inspection 
 I think so . we certainly don ’ t want a highjack to happen on our plane today . 
 I want to see all places of renown in Suzhou . 
 By bike , of course.You don't want to miss the beautiful scenery , do you ? 
 Oh , my bread ! 
 Curse this oven ! Curse it ! 
 Curse the worst oven in the world . 
 There are thirteen of them . Oh , have another . Have a third , if you like , have them all . 
 What's the problem ? 
 I apologize , but the cable has been down lately . 
 Give it a couple days , and it should be back on . 
 Since it's not working , I'm going to give you a credit . 
 You won't pay anything until your cable starts working again . 
 No problem . Thank you for being so understanding . 
 I know what you mean , Carol . I ’ Ve had nothing but trouble with it . They say it ’ s supposed to be easy ! 
 Sure . Why don ’ t you sit down for a minute ? You haven ’ t taken a rest all morning . 
 I'm afraid Thera isn't any direct light before Friday . What about a non-direct one ? You have to make a change in Detroit . 
 Would you like to pay in cash or by card ? 
 Hi Cody , how did practicing go this week ? 
 Great ! Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first . Good , good . This week , work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note . Now let ’ s take a look at this 
 It might work . I ’ ll have to hear it.Show me what you ’ Ve done . 
 It ’ s just nerves . Just play the right hand for now . One two three four five six , ta ti tri-ple-ti . Good , good . Don ’ t forget the accidentals ! The key signature says that note should be a G-sharp b 
 Yes , much better . Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal . What was that ? 
 That's ok , keep going , you ’ re moving ahead by leaps and bounds . Watch your dynamics ! Keep your elbows lifted . Remember to stroke the keys , don ’ t pound . That ’ s better ! Remember that as a pianist or any 
 Oh my gosh , how exciting ! 
 Sure , I will . How can I miss that ? 
 Oh , don't . I'm sure you'll be the loveliest bride ever ! 
 Don't go to too much trouble . 
 No way . Do it yourself . 
 OK , I'll iron your shirt for you , but only if you make me a cup of coffee . 
 No , thanks . I've decided to give up smoking . 
 Well , it's just that I think if you don't enjoy doing something any more , you should stop doing it . 
 That's right . You should give it up , too . It's bad for your health . 
 But it's true . It's a nasty habit . I can't think why I ever started . Anyway , it's obviously got you in its grip ! 
 I mean you couldn't give it up ! 
 How do you know ? 
 That was a tough question . How did you get it right ? 
 Hi . What's up ? 
 Not too much . I've been pretty busy . 
 Gotta go . Call me tonight . 
 What's the weather like in Britain ? 
 That's great . Will I feel hot there ? I feel sensitive to heat . 
 Well , what's the matter with you ? 
 Have you got a headache ? 
 Are you coughing much ? 
 Now , let me listen to your chest . Ah , you have a temperature . Breathe deeply . That's right . Well , don't worry , it's only a throat infection . There's nothing wrong with your lungs . And how is your appetite ? 
 Show me your tongue , please . All right , stay in bed and keep yourself warm . I'll prescribe some pills for you to take . 
 Yes . You'll be better in a few days , I'm sure . 
 Goodbye . 
 There was a stop sign back there that you didn't stop for . 
 How'd you miss it ? 
 Those bushes are covering the stop sign . 
 I see why you didn't stop . 
 No , I'm just going to let you go . 
 That's all right . Make sure to look closely next time . 
 You definitely made the right move by calling . Our primary business is creating , conducting and customizing fully interactive human resources workshops for companies just like yours . 
 Well as we know nothing comes out of a can . We have years of experience tailoring workshops to the specific needs of your company . We can hone in on your problem areas and have your employe 
 That's what we're here for , the human resources help you need , when and how you need it . 
 What did I do ? I haven't done anything . 
 What do you mean ? 
 I didn't do anything . 
 No , I didn't . I'm innocent . Those aren't mine . Whatever you found is someone else's stuff . You can't prove anything . I wasn't there when you went in , and you can't prove it's my stuff . 
 I don't need your help , jerk . 
 Good morning , Miss Wu ! Can I ask you something ? 
 Tomorrow is my wife's birthday . We both love spicy Chinese dishes . I am wondering if you could recommend a good local restaurant where I can find some good spicy dishes . 
 How far is it from here ? 
 Great . We'll go and have a try . Thank you very much . 
 Thank you . The same to you . 
 Do you think you'll be interested in studying law later ? 
 You want to be a politician ? Yuck . 
 Sorry , you're right . I think you'll be a good politician . 
 You're right . We need more people like you in politics . 
 What's the fare ? 
 The fare is different from the meter . 
 But I thought it was . Anyway . I am in a hurry . Here is the money . 
 Right . Then you may think that I am not fit for this job according to my educational background . 
 But I want to be a tour guide very much because I like traveling and meeting various kinds of people . So I took an evening course at the Tourism School of Beijing after graduation and I have gotten a qualification certificate . 
 Yes , I always enjoy being with a group of people and chatting with them . 
 A tourist guide must be responsible for arranging and coordinating tour activities , and offering service of transportation , accommodation , sightseeing , shopping and entertainment . 
 Hard but interesting , I think . 
 Yes , I usually guided foreign tourists around Beijing when I was in University . 
 Yes , I have learned a little French and Japanese as well . 
 No , the galaxies sit more or less passively in the space around them . But not too much . As the space between galaxies expands , it carries the galaxies further apart - like raisins in an expanding dough . 
 Well , the universe is a chaotic place , and the gravity from one galaxy , or from a group of galaxies , may disturb the motion of its near neighbors , causing them to collide . However , on average , when you compare two large enough chunks of space , the galaxies in one are moving away from the galaxies in the other . 
 You're welcome . 
 Oh , no ! Why ? I was looking forward to seeing you at my new place . 
 No problem . Call me when you get back . 
 That's good for me , but do you think you'll be back by then ? I'd really like to see you . 
 Great ! That's settled then . 
 Bell Computers Limited , can I help you ? 
 Hold on please . 
 Yes , can you please let him know I called and ask him to call me back as soon as he can ? My name's Mary , and I'm calling from Happy Travel . My number is 123 456 789 . 
 Yes , 123 456 789 , Mary from Happy Travel . Have you got that ? 
 Great . Thanks . 
 No , that's it . Thanks . Bye . 
 Yes , I need more amenities . 
 You know , the things that are free , like the soap and the shampoo . 
 No , I still have plenty left , even if I took three baths a day . 
 I need to take home some souvenirs ! 
 Yes , souvenirs that I can take home and add to my collection . 
 Are you kidding ? Whoever heard of paying for hotel souvenirs ? 
 So , Jimmy , how does it feel to have your own money ? 
 Even though you are only twelve , it ’ s not too early to start saving a little money . 
 You know you would spend it . And also , money in the bank earns interest . 
 The bank will give you a PIN , and you can withdraw money from any ATM . 
 Not quite . You have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars . And sometimes the bank has service charges . But you don ’ t have to worry about that yet . Let ’ s go make your first depot 
 What ’ s the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ? 
 How hard is the climb ? 
 What did you do last week ? 
 Wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun . I ’ m sorry I missed it . 
 Yeah , I will . See you then ! 
 Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ? 
 But you should have told me you were in love with her . 
 You know you didn't . 
 Yes , but you might have told me before . 
 You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ? 
 Oh , you men ! You're all the same . 
 No kidding ? 
 You can't beat that . 
 That's too bad . 
 I don't think that will do . How about the one at your back ? 
 No , the other one ... yes . 
 It do look beautiful . Well . I think I'll take it.Now do you have any racket covers ? 
 How much does it come up to ? 
 Do you accept credit cards ? 
 Do you like traveling by train or by plane ? 
 But Sue is indeed beaut . Men can hardly resist such a knock-out . 
 I know little of her . I only think she ’ s pretty and intelligent . Of course , she ’ s diligent , too . 
 Good afternoon , Miss . 
 What style do you want ? 
 Sure . Here you are . 
 Yes , Miss . Is that all right ? 
 And would you like a manicure ? 
 One hundred yuan , please . 
 Thank you . 
 For almost two years . 
 Thank you . But there's still a lot for me to learn . 
 I'm going to the hospital . 
 About how much will it cost ? 
 By the way , what's the time ? 
 It's a quarter to 12 . Could you please drive a little faster ? 
 May I take your order now ? 
 Certainly . I would recommend ' Songshuguiyu ' . 
 Well , it is sweet and sour fried Mandarin fish . 
 Then , how about this one ? 
 Very good . Could I serve you anything else ? 
 My pleasure . Just a little while , your order will be ready very soon . Please enjoy your lunch . 
 Could I speak to you for a minute ? 
 I want to talk about this year ’ s election . 
 I am volunteering for the campaign . 
 I want to be a part of history . 
 Do you plan on voting ? 
 You should try and make it early to your polling place . 
 Good morning ! Can I help you ? 
 OK , come this way , please . How does this one fit you ? 
 Let me stretch it for you . How is that now ? 
 OK . Here you are . 
 Thirty-five yuan . 
 Thanks . Nothing else , today ? 
 Peter , I hope you will accept my quotation for the air freshener . 
 I have cut the price the minimum . You know our freshener is a patent product , different from other kinds of fresheners . We could not have quitted it at such a low price if it were not for your past large orders . This price , actually , leaves us with a very small profit . 
 The low price I'm offering you is as low as I can go . 
 I'm sorry , Peter . I hope you'll continue to approach us on other occasions if you cannot accept our offer now . 
 What can I do ? 
 Did you go to any illegal website ? 
 Yes , your computer can be easily infected by virus if you do that . 
 That's wise . 
 One minute . Oh , yes , it was infected by a virus , and you had no antivirus software . 
 Of course . You'd better learn something about it . 
 Don't worry , it should have been protected automatically . And I take an anti-virus software with me . Do you want me to install it now ? 
 I need to get a taxi . 
 No , that won't be necessary . I just need a taxi . 
 Just a taxi , please . 
 I'm going to Rockefeller Center . 
 I want to leave as soon as possible . 
 Thank you , I'm coming down now . 
 Excuse me , do you have a vacancy ? 
 Well , I would like to book a single room . 
 5 days . From Feb . 13 to 18 . 
 Stay away from me . 
 I'm serious , Zina . Back off . I have a bottle of pepper spray in my pocket . 
 Why are you being so nice to me ? Don't think for a second that I trust you . 
 It was great . I made some friends . 
 But the lessons this semester are a little bit hard . 
 That was heaven ! 
 Really ? 
 Well , whatever it does , I feel transformed ! 
 I'm doing business through Internet now . 
 Yes , very good . 
 It is very convenient . You know you can browse the website and send e-mails to your customers at any time . 
 Also it has low cost , and you know you only need to pay the fee of Internet , which is very cheap . 
 To be frank , sometimes it is not so safe as doing business through traditional ways . 
 Yes , but if you choose some good B2B websites , such problems can be avoided . 
 Of course , such as the Alabama , which is a famous website . 
 Hello , this is Lucie Jing calling from Lincoln Bank . May I speak to Mr Was , please ? 
 Ah , hello , Mr Was . I'm just calling about your new credit card . It has arrived with us , so you can either come to collect it , or we can send it on to you . 
 What perfect timing ! 
 Not really . But we do recommend you to read through our terms and conditions again before you sign the card , just in case there is something you aren't happy with . 
 That will be sent on to you within 2 working days . Then , you can start using your new card . 
 what kinds of tv programmes do you enjoy watching ? 
 I like those kinds of programmes too . They ’ re very informative . I think that many people underrate the education value of tv . 
 yeah . And that ’ s so funny because most people prefer watching sex and violence to watching something more educational ! 
 in my country , there ’ s a time limit on the advertisements that can be shown . I think it ’ s about six minutes per hour . 
 no . they don ’ t . they simply charge higher prices at peak times . Is there no limit on the amount of advertisements that can be shown on tv in your country ? 
 some people have satellite and cable tv in my country , but people don ’ t seem to keen to pay for their tv programmes . Besides , the terrestrial channels offer a good range of programmes . 
 Now I'm sure we'll never get all our things back . They're so clever these criminals . What's the point of collecting beautiful things for other people to steal ? 
 Think how happy we were . Now this.Things always go wrong . 
 I don't feel like breakfast . I don't feel like anything . Why are we so unlucky ? It's as if there were a jinx on us . 
 Yes . Of course . But what good will it do ? That man's miles away from here by now . In our car . 
 6 500 yuan . You will get it on the price tag . 
 Its already very cheap . Let's make it 6 000 yuan . 
 Hum ... I say 5 500 yuan . That's as cheap as it can get . 
 I'm sorry , this is our rock bottom price . 
 I think he deserved his gold . 
 Yes , it's perfect ! 
 Do you see that small white car over there ? It ’ s Tom ’ s new car . 
 It is very expensive . Tom ’ s father paid for it . 
 They are By new models now , they are not very expensive . Maybe you should look for one . 
 I'm not . 
 I trust you . 
 I'm fling , Jack . ( singing ) Come , Josephine , in my flying machine . Up she goes , and up she goes ... 
 She is now in a private school . 
 It's idea of my husband . He is always banging the drum for better schools . 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Sure . How long is your vacation ? 
 Well , how do you like this one ? You will stay there for 17 days . 
 It's summer in Sydney so you have to bring your summer wear . 
 Don't be that negative . 
 I find it there is no meaning in living this world . 
 Really , life is so boring . 
 There is some , but my country is not amongst the leading producers . The oil and coal deposits are in the north of my country . Your country is a big oil producer , isn ’ t it ? 
 We have some too . Do you have a lot of coal ? 
 There are a few in my country . We have deposit of gold , but they are very small . 
 That ’ s right . A few people go panning for gold in rivers . 
 It ’ s a natural resources that we hardly use . Government policy is to conserve those forests . 
 Is your country ’ s environment being damaged by the oil industry ? 
 I would like high speed internet installed in my house . 
 I'd like to make an appointment right now . 
 I would like to have it done this Friday . 
 Is it possible for someone to come a little earlier ? 
 How about Saturday ? 
 Can you come over at 11 
 You ’ re home late today , David . How was school ? 
 Oh , what ’ s she like ? 
 Is she old or young ? 
 Is she strict ? 
 Can she speak Chinese ? 
 David , stop dreaming . It ’ s time to do your homework . 
 Yes , of course . 
 All right . Your name , please . 
 Chen Liang , a table for four . And when are you coming ? 
 OK . We look forward to seeing you . Goodbye . 
 What happened to you ? 
 Do you have any symptoms ? 
 Do you have a fever ? 
 It's not serious . 
 Yes . 
 You should drink more hot water , and do some exercise . 
 Just one second , sir , and I'll give you your receipt . Here you go . 
 Sir , did you enjoy your stay here ? 
 I'm glad you enjoyed the city , anyway . But please don't think too unkindly of us . 
 I should say , a a ' set ' of golf clubs is restricted to no more than 14 clubs . 
 In general , a set of golf clubs 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , PW ; Woods : 1 , 3 , 5 and a putter . 
 This is not to say you have to carry all of these clubs . It depends on your preferences . 
 Of course even people who don't know anything about golf know his name . 
 Yes ? Anything I can do for you ? 
 Ok . 
 Good morning . I would like to make a reservation to Hong Kong for August 2 . 
 May I inquire about the departure time ? 
 When will the plane reach Hong Kong for the morning flight ? 
 OK . I would like to book a ticket for that one . 
 Yes , I know . What's the fare ? 
 I see . Will it be doubled for the round trip ? 
 I won't . 
 We are not seeing each other any more . 
 Yeah . I got sick and tired of her nagging all the time . 
 I don't know . There ’ s plenty of fish out there in the sea ! 
 I'm going to work in a multi-national enterprise after graduation . 
 I'll do it someday . But it's not the right time now . I have to learn a lot by working as an employee . 
 you could say so . I'll work hard in that company and try to understand as much as possible about how to run an enterprise . 
 yeah , the success stories of that company might be useful for me . And their customers may become the potential ones for my own company . 
 well , I'll come up with a detailed business plan to attract the investors . 
 Let's program your courses , since you have had English literature , you should take American literature and American prose and fiction.You transcript indicate that your english background is strong , so I don't think you have any problem with it . 
 Three , you also should take two three-credit-course in education department . 
 Operator , can you give me any information on the call I just received ? 
 Can you tell me the calling number , please ? 
 Thank you . 
 Hello , how are you ? I am Jack . 
 What brings you here ? 
 Yes , it is really a good deal . $ 1,000 discount . I've never seen a sale as good as this one . 
 Sure . It has 1.8 liter engine . This one comes with all power options , air condition , CD player , full size spare tire , automatic transmission and ABC . The window price is $ 17,000 , and I can give You for $ 16.000 . 
 You must be kidding ! You cannot get that price anywhere . 
 Can you put down a $ 2,000 deposit , and I'll talk to my manager , see what we can do . 
 Okay , I'll be right back ... Congratulations ! The manager approved the final price $ 15,000 . 
 You are really tough . You got a deal . 
 Look out ! Your tea water is running over . 
 Sure . 
 So Janet , do you do any sports ? 
 Yeah , how often do you go ? 
 Not bad ! Do you do any other sports ? 
 How do you decide what grade we get ? 
 What is the most important factor ? 
 How can we keep track of our grades ? 
 What if we can't get to school ? 
 If we have a major problem , will you let us know ? 
 What time does the museum close ? Any idea ? 
 What time is it now ? 
 I've come about your wools . According to our market survey , wools are likely to find a ready market in our country . 
 Do you quote CIF or FOB ? 
 Could you quote the price of CIF Hamburg ? 
 Okay , see you tomorrow ! 
 Sorry.We don't have a printed one . Is there anything else I can do for you ? 
 Sorry , we don't . I don't think you can find any airline which offers a non-stop flight to Tokyo . 
 Yes . It is really a place of interest and we have the direct flight everyday . 
 Yeah , you get the TV to yourself while I spend my nights surfing the Net for missing classmates . 
 I guess . Don't you have reunions in Taiwan ? 
 Ours are for everyone that graduated in the same year . 
 Sure Tracy , let me just get my laptop . 
 Um , Tracy ? I think that ' s a little too formal . I know you want to be polite but you've already made contact with them , so in English you can be more relaxed in the opening ... 
 Okay Tracy , now it's too relaxed ! You've still got to show some respect . How about starting with " Dear Ms . Cooper , I'm writing to confirm ... ? 
 That's great ... 
 Woo , okay , back up a second , Tracy . That's too direct . Can I suggest you say , please note that final payment is due two working weeks before publication ? You don't want to offend her . 
 Mmmm , maybe , but I'd play it safe and just finish with " Yours Sincerely " . That's more professional . 
 hey Ayden , I was wondering if you could do me a favor . 
 it's kind of a big favor . I'm absolutely flat broke , and I owe my landlady $ 200 . she's given me until Friday to give it to her , but I don't get paid until next Monday . Do you think you could loans 
 if you can't give me the full amount , a fraction of it would still help . I'll pay you back on Monday . I promise . 
 thanks a lot Ayden . Every little bit will help . Tell you what , if you aren't doing anything tonight , why don't you come over and have dinner at my place . 
 how about at 6 pm ? 
 It's weekend again , I'm glad I can arrange for my personal matters . 
 Oh , that means I can do whatever I like without few interruptions . 
 Oh , really ? I just have lots of hobbies in my spare time ; such as going to the concert , painting , handwriting , reading novels and reading fashion magazines . What about yours ? 
 Oh , you can't think like that . We young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas . You like taking photos and going to photography shows , why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable ? 
 I quite agree with you . With our hobbies , our life can be more colorful and exciting . 
 Yes , it's a good habit to have a life-long hobby . Those who practise calligraphy and Qigong always live longer . 
 Is your blood pressure , I'm afraid . It's far too high . 
 Overwork-amongst other things . You can't work 24 hours a day . You ' Ve got to slow down . 
 You've got to , I'm afraid . And look at this . You weigh 200 stones . That's too much for a man of your size . 
 Yes . You've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise . 
 Exactly how old a box do you want ? 
 We still have six left . 
 Dancing figures are quite popular . Two of the boxes have them . 
 Yes , I think you'll be very satisfied with that one . 
 No . But if something goes wrong with it , I know someone who repairs these things . 
 It's amazing that these things still work as well as they do . 
 Here is it . 
 The total amount is $ 185 . 
 Yes . 
 Thanks . 
 But I am still worry about them . I ’ m afraid ... 
 Well , I won ’ t put a crime into their doings . 
 I just went to bed . 
 I know , but that movie was just too good to leave . I guess I ’ ll just have to pay the price anti-sleepy . 
 No . why don ’ t we describe and buy at the coffee shop next door ? 
 Is this watch yours ? 
 Let me have a look . It's mine . I have been looking for it , but just cannot find it . It's present from my father . 
 If we give you the job , what ’ s the most important thing you except to get ? 
 Just this ? 
 Do you want to get a promotion ? 
 Where would you like to be in 5 years ? 
 How do you plan to accomplish this ? 
 Yes , sir . What'll it be for you ? 
 Is there anything else ? 
 Is this to go or to eat here ? 
 Here you are . That's eight fifty . 
 It's on the service counter over there . 
 Yeah , do you want something ? 
 No problem . Do you have any cash on you ? I don ’ t think I have enough . 
 Where shall I put it , miss ? 
 But Peter and Tony put all their paper in the basket a few moments ago.Now it's full . 
 Yes , miss . 
 In the playground , miss . 
 Where is some fresh produce that's on sale ? 
 I've never had a mango . 
 Can you eat the stone ? 
 How much are these mangoes ? 
 Can you describe their taste ? 
 How can I tell if they're ripe ? 
 What country produces them ? 
 How is your new car ? 
 Why do you say so ? Can I see your new car ? 
 Wow , this new car is dynamite ! It is a shiny , beautiful car . 
 The car has very sleek lines . I love it . 
 You made a good choice . 
 Thanks a lot for calling us . Could you tell me more about what you need us to do ? 
 OK , the cost depends on the floor to move to , the distance between two places and the amount of the furniture to move . 
 Oh , let me see . It fits the second standard rates . Have a look at the contract , please . 
 No , firstly we sign the contract ; you pay 50 % of what it costs , and the rest when we finish moving . 
 OK . If any of the articles was damaged during moving , you may make a claim for compensation with our department . 
 Thank you for meeting me here . 
 I need to speak with you about your daughter . 
 I enjoy having your daughter in my class . 
 She is a great addition to my class . 
 She is always behaving herself , and she's so smart . 
 I'm more than happy having her in my class . 
 Are you sure of that ? 
 They may have some difficulty in doing it . 
 No problem , what class would you like to take ? 
 There are two classes that are still open . 
 The first class is a Tuesday and Thursday class from two to three . 
 The other class is on Monday and Wednesday from 10 am - 12 . 
 I'm positive . 
 Okay , I'll sign you up . 
 You mean Armistice Day . 
 Wow , I didn ’ t know ! Probably because I flunked history in school . 
 Hello . Thank you for seeing me off . You actually don't need to bother . 
 Thanks a lot . I hope to see you again . 
 Thanks again for everything you have done for me . 
 What is your case against the police ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 Didn ’ t they let you go ? 
 So they kept you at the station ? 
 Did they tell you why they arrested you ? 
 I understand . 
 May I know who's calling ? 
 Glad to hear your voice , David . 
 If you would like me to , I could help you with that . 
 I have plenty of time to do this . I promise you it won't be a problem for me . 
 If we work on this tomorrow night , you could easily be ready by Friday . 
 That would work out well . Bring any concerns that you might have . 
 Don't worry . Everything will go well . I promise ! 
 Some what ? 
 Oh , umm , no thanks . 
 No , I am ok , really . 
 Do you really have all of these drugs ? Where do you get them from ? 
 Sounds good ! Let ’ s see , I want . 
 I want you to put your hands behind your head ! You are under arrest ! 
 December the fifteenth . The day after tomorrow is little Tom ’ s birthday . 
 Thirteen today and tomorrow . Fourteen the day after tomorrow . 
 And don ’ t forget Mary , Tom ’ s twin sister . It ’ s her birthday , too . 
 Long time no see ! 
 It's nice to see you again . Have you changed jobs ? 
 That's nice . Where have you been ? 
 Are you busy now ? 
 How about a coffee in that cafe ? 
 Hello ! Do you have a place where I can exercise ? 
 I'm happy to hear that . Now , would you tell me where it is ? 
 Is the hotel going to charge me a dollar a minute for gym use ? 
 And the gym hours are ? 
 One more question , Do you have a trainer ? 
 I don't know what to say . This can't be happening . Here's the obituary . 
 But it explains why Taylor isn't answering and Femi took time off from work . 
 This says the viewing is at Myers Funeral Home today until five .

 What genres ? 
 What interests you in that type of music ?

 You won't need it . Stanley , my best man , is going to treat everybody ! 
 If it were up to Stanley , we'd have the wedding in the ETV ! He loves to sing . 
 Well , uh , I'll let you decide that for yourself . He'll be here a little later . Here's our room ! 
 Sure . 
 BBS means Bulletin Board Service . 
 A lot of things ! 
 Okay . BBS , an online service , offers a wide variety of online games , files , one-on-one chat , message areas , private mail , and participate forums . 
 Why not ? 
 It should go to Altadena . 
 I'm not completely sure if it really does . 
 I'm almost positive that this is the right one . 
 We have been riding this bus for a long time . 
 I think it says Temple City . 
 I'm sorry . But at least we know which bus to catch to get back where we started .

 You're right . That movie is hilarious . 
 I went to see it the day it came out . 
 I couldn't help laughing , either .

 At the airport . OK , Miss . Wang , your Flight 8 on July 19 from Taipei to Minneapolis is canceled . Your new reservation is Trans Pacific Flight 8 from Taipei to Minneapolis at 9 thirty a . m . on August 2 . 
 That ’ s correct . 
 Is there anything else I can do for you ? 
 Julia , I have good news for you . 
 I have earned a lot of money this week , more than I do in a fortnight . 
 My wages are six hundred dollars a week . But I find a part-time job to supplement my income . 
 I know , darling . I must earn enough money to buy a car . I do a part-time job to increase my income . Don't worry , I will take care of myself . 
 T he nineteenth of June is my birthday . I'm planning to have a small party . Could you come ? 
 Hi , I need to talk with the property manager right away ! 
 This morning , when we woke up , there was water pouring in from the ceiling ! 
 There were several rooms , but the worst leak was in the bathroom . 
 We are on the second floor , one of the middle floors . 
 Actually , I have to go to school right now . 
 Life's so boring . 
 What do you think will make you happy ? 
 You heard people say that money doesn't guarantee happiness . 
 You'll get bored eventually . 
 That's true , I guess . If I didn't have to work , I think I would be happy . 
 I ’ Ve decided to go to the cinema alone this evening . 
 Helen is nice but she talks a lot . 
 It sure is . 
 How about the rowing machine 
 Cool ! We can watch Ally Mcneal ! 
 What exercises can I do to firm up my backside 
 Like this ? 
 What can I do for you today ? 
 Which classes ? 
 Would you like to make an appointment ? 
 You need to sign the paperwork . 
 When can you come in ? 
 I'll schedule you for then . 
 What an attractive blouse , You look so pretty in this blue dress ! 
 It's very nice.It goes well with your skirt . 
 Not at all.This dress certainly shows your good taste . 
 Hello ? 
 I ’ m sorry . I think you are calling the wrong person . My name is not Mr . Bernie . 
 No problem . 
 Not really . 
 Please don't tell me you bought it . 
 If you did , you probably got ripped off . 
 Not bad . We had a get-together with friends from college . I haven't seen many of them since graduation . How about you ? 
 Sounds a good weekend . You know it always amazes me that two people as different as you and Jo can become such close friends . 
 That's great . I know people who can't stand each other for even five minutes . 
 It seems you two bring out the best of one another . 
 Yeah , you are so lucky to have found each other . 
 The City Bank . May I help you , sir ? 
 May I have your name , please ? 
 Alright , what's your address ? 
 When would you like your account closed ? 
 Okay . Where would you like to have your last bill sent to you ? 
 Alright , We'll take care of that . 
 Oh , sorry about that.We ' ll get it fixed as soon as we can . 
 Yes , I saw one . Believe me . 
 Look at this headline - Elvis Baby Born on Spacecraft . Where do these tabloids get such crazy stories ? 
 It looks as though everyone in line reads them , or at least looks at the headlines . 
 Maybe our checker is faster at scanning the food . 
 I ’ m so hungry . Let me have a look at the menu . 
 Would you show us the menu ? 
 I'd like to have prawn cocktail , and tomato soup for the main course , I'd like steak with onion , with some black coffee afterwards . 
 It sounds good . I'll try it . 
 Well , I'll have a glass of mineral water . 
 No , thank you . I think it's enough for dinner . 
 May I help you , sir ? 
 Any particular colour ? 
 How about this one ? 
 Well , they come in white , pale yellow , aqua , red and green . Will a white one do ? 
 Why , of course . Let's see ... White ... Pale yellow . Here you are , sir . 
 Thank you . You are cooking up a storm . 
 No , thank you . I'm afraid I can't take in anymore . 
 How would you like to pay ? 
 Cash or card is fine . 
 Hi , Ellen ! How is it going ? 
 Yep ! Are you going to the rock concert Friday night ? 
 Sure . Would you like go with me ? 
 You ’ ll have to buy your own ticket though . 
 Wow ! When did you come into so much cash ? 
 How much was your watch ? 
 How is your English ability ? 
 English and computer skills are comparatively important to this position , especially in the starting period . What ’ s your ability in these two fields ? 
 What else do you have to prove your English ability ? 
 How do you deal with those who you think are difficult to work with ? 
 Yes , I see . 
 Are you having problems with it ? 
 Let me help you . 
 MI stands for Middle Initial . 
 That means Month / Day / Year . Use numbers . 
 For example , if your birth date is January 12 , 1987 , write 01/12 /8 7 . 
 Always print clearly , and fill in the bubbles completely . 
 Chicken , please . 
 Thank you . Oh , can I have another drink ? 
 At the Beijing Olympics , all four table tennis events were all-Chinese finals . A clean sweep again ! 
 Do you know any secrets to China's success ? 
 So , the national ping-pong team must be a highly competitive membership . 
 For example ? 
 Oh , dear ! It's an encroachment on individual rights ! 
 Do you think you can fix my computer ? 
 I'm sorry for spilling my drink on your rug . 
 But I ruined your rug . 
 How do you feel ? 
 You're really fit , Paul . Do you exercise very much ? 
 You're kidding ! 
 Wow ! How often do you exercise like that ? 
 Oh , I hardly ever exercise . I usually just watch TV in my free time . I guess I'm a real couch potato ! 
 I sat through about half of it but they lost me after that . 
 Not really , to be honest . Some of what they call fashion looks terrible to me . 
 All the rage with whom ? I never see anyone wearing these designs on the street . 
 What , it keeps coming back ? 
 Flares ? 
 It's too complicated . I'll just stick to the plain clothes . 
 Just as the saying goes , every potter praises his own pot . You should pay special attention to selling yourself properly in the interview . 
 You'd better prepare what you are going to say in advance , in order to have a good performance in the interview . 
 Only when you are aware of what the interviewer will be interested in , can you make a targeted preparation . 
 Selling yourself should go straight to the point , and the statement should be clear and brief . 
 You should particularly state your strong points which are closely related to the position you are applying for . 
 Time permitted , you could add certain examples to your description . 
 Hello , can I start you off with anything to drink ? 
 Sure , would you like any appetizers today ? 
 No problem , can I get you anything else ? 
 Okay , let me know when you're ready to order your food . 
 Okay , what can I get you ? 
 Will that be all ? 
 Can you finish your homework in ten minutes ? 
 Excuse me . I bought this shirt yesterday , but I would like to refund it . 
 Here is my receipt . 
 It's too small for me to wear . 
 No thanks . I want to have a refund . 
 Good morning . Wilson Association . 
 I'm sorry , but Mr.Thomas left the office a few minutes ago . 
 I'm afraid not . He's gone for the rest of the day . 
 I don't believe so . He's going out of town on business . May I take a message ? 
 Would you care to make another appointment ? 
 I see . I can tell Mr.Thomas that you phoned . 
 Bye-bye . 
 Were you ? your performance was excellent . 
 Have you ever sung with a karaoke ? 
 Karaoke has become a major entertainment . I wonder why . 
 How much fun is there in singing in front of other people , especially if you don't sing well ? 
 I wouldn't do that . 
 How ’ s your little girl , Debbie ? 
 How old is she ? 
 What's on TV tonight ? 
 Do you need a guide ? 
 It's $ 20 . If you are staying for more than 3 days in the city , the charge is $ 16 per day . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Have you made a reservation ? 
 How long will you be staying ? 
 A single room costs you $ 85 / day . 
 Yes . 
 No , You can pay when you check out . 
 I know ! It ’ s an amazing growth opportunity ! They ’ re true industry leaders , and it would be so interesting to be part of an organization that is the undisputed leader in business process platform development . 
 Well , I visited their website and read up on what they do . They ’ re an IT service company that offers comprehensive business solutions for large corporations . They provide services such as ARM development , and they also offer customdesigned applications . 
 Well , the position is for an account manager . That basically means that I would be the link between our and our development team . 
 Well , as I said they ’ re the industry leaders , they have a really great growth strategy , amazing development opportunities for employees , and it seems like they have strong corporate governance . They ’ re all about helping companies grow and unleashing potential . I guess their core values and mission really resonated with me . Oh , and they offer six weeks ’ vacation , stock options and bonuses ... I ’ m totally going to cash in on that . 
 You are late again , Maria . The teacher is about to come . 
 Oh , Ben has been cooking for us since I started attending this evening class . The good thing is , he has made great progress in cooking . 
 How about your one-year-old baby ? 
 How sweet of them ! I have to work in the day time , study at night , and do housework during my spare time . I really hope I have eight arms and legs , like an octopus . 
 When is your Adult College Entrance Exam ? 
 Oh , my Adult College Entrance Exam is also around then . I don't know if I can pass it . 
 I just want to study in a college , majoring in economics . I've had this dream for a long time . 
 No thanks . We just need our check . Have you seen the waitress ? 
 The service here has been really great , don't you think ? 
 So , let's look at the check . The total is $ 36.00 . 
 Usually people leave 15 % , but this was exceptional service . I am thinking that maybe 20 % would be appropriate . 
 OK , so that will bring her tip to $ 7.20 . Add it to the $ 36.00 and the total is $ 43.20 . 
 We'll have to make sure to come back here again real soon . 
 The organizational structure is the company's framework of communication and authority . 
 Yes , you are right . 
 I got a ticket , and I would like to fight it . 
 He's here . 
 The officer says that I ran a red light , but I didn't . 
 He must've , because the signal had a camera on top of it . 
 I don't believe it took my picture . 
 I appreciate that . 
 How about the soup ? 
 How nice of you to say so . 
 What're you going to buy ? 
 OK . 
 What are you doing ? Is anything wrong ? 
 Oh , yes , of course . I'm sorry-I wasn't thinking ... 
 Not rally . 200 years ago , it was just a small insignificant village . 
 Large deposits of coal were found nearly and so many industries located themselves here . The village quickly grew into a key industrial centre . 
 Yes , it did . The names of those village survive as the names of parts of the city . 
 Oh , yes . Several of the buildings from the villages still survive . Many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . There was a castle near one village , so our city has a castle too . 
 Are the ceremony and reception held in the same place ? 
 Where do they go ? 
 They go to the home of the bride ? 
 The Chinese custom is to go to the groom's home-just the opposite . 
 That's very expensive for the family of the bride . 
 Tell me something about the bridal bouquet . Isn't it the custom to throw it ? 
 Maybe I'll be the one . 
 sure . 
 well , you are a very hard-worker . 
 there are trying times for everyone . What do you propose ? 
 that's quite a bit . If I give you a raise , I'm going to have to give everyone a raise . 
 that sounds reasonable . How about this , from now on , you can be responsible for scheduling . That means that if you can't find someone to cover a shift , then you'll have to do it . 
 of course . It's be against the law if we didn't . 
 you are welcome . Come in early tomorrow and I'll show you how to do the scheduling . 
 Um ... It's wonderful to be here . Uh ... this place looks really cozy . 
 Maybe ... 
 Is that a kind of alcohol ? 
 Great . My face will turn even redder ! 
 I'm going to the store . 
 Would you like to come with me ? 
 Would you like to go now or later ? 
 What ? 
 OK , let's go . 
 No , it's too far . Let's drive . 
 Thank you ! Guess how much it costs . 
 Your offer is way off the mark . It set me back only sixty-five . 
 Neither . I drove a hard bargain with the vendor before I got the price down . 
 Three hundred ! That's daylight robbery . How dare she play tricks on an old hand like me ? Without hesitation , I gave my offer---no more than fifty . 
 Not at all ! She's really been around , and seemed quite accustomed to bargaining like this . That's the trade . She only demanded a higher bid , saying the purchase price was even higher than seventy . She was lying ! Then I inquired , ' May I have it at sixty ? ' she waved her head . 
 Yeah . I turned around and started to move out . Just then , she yelped behind my back , ' all right , all right ! I may sacrifice a little . Let's fix it sixty-five ! Can't be cheaper . ' 
 Of course . I spent the whole week to know the general process for these plans . And since I was employed , I have been working on them . Madam , how am I doing ? Are you satisfied with my job ? 
 I suppose so . I tried my best to be familiar with all these appliances and office process . Certainly without my colleagues ' help , I could not do these things in such a short period . 
 Thanks for your praise , Madam . 
 Nothing special . 
 That's great . I would love to . And when ? 
 No problem . However , maybe I should come early to help you prepare the dinner . 
 All right , see you tonight . 
 It ’ s rather cold . Isn ’ t it 
 Shall I light the stove ? 
 Well . What ’ s the climate like in your country ? 
 Which season do you like best ? 
 Do you have a moment ? 
 I'm having some trouble . I don't know how to use this printer . I've never seen this kind of office printer before . Is it a new brand ? 
 Silly me ! 
 Oh , it's out of paper . Do you have any more ? 
 Which one is this ? 
 Howdy ! Nice car ! What seems to be the problem ? 
 Not sure yet.How about you pop the hood and we can take a look . Mmmm , it doesn ’ t look good . 
 Well missy , the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator . You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission . You should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died . 
 I ’ m afraid a bit more than that . We need to order the spare parts , take apart your electrical system , fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again . You are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks . 
 I'm checking out tomorrow . What time must I vacate the room ? 
 I see . Thank you . 
 He's not doing too well . 
 About a year ago , he started feeling weak all the time . 
 Maybe a little of both . The doctor's can't point out anything specifically . I think it is because he didn't take care of himself during his youth . 
 That's what my father tells me almost everyday . 
 Thanks . I'll let him know . 
 Where are you now ? 
 What does your car look like ? 
 Where can I call a taxi ? 
 Would you like to order now ? 
 Please let me point out the chef's special , which is blackened catfish . 
 We are always happy to adjust our cooking to meet your needs . 
 The cashew broccoli noodles or the cheese and veggie enchiladas would be an excellent choice . 
 Would you like your salad brought to you with your entree , or would you like it served now ? 
 I ’ m moving out . 
 I won ’ t be able to stay here anymore . 
 I don ’ t know why there ’ s a problem . 
 Why can ’ t you give it back to me ? 
 I ’ m going to need my deposit back . 
 I can ’ t stay here , though . 
 How can I help you ? 
 Oh , it is the right time for you purchasing in our clothes shop . We are now having a low price on all our summer apparel . 
 Everything for summer is 20 % off . 
 Sure . We have both skirts and trousers that would look well with the T-shirt . Look at this section . 
 You have good taste . It is very much in style this year . 
 160 yuan . 
 What a charming room ! It faces south , and there's such a lovely view of the city . 
 No , I shouldn't think so . By the way , is there a socket for my razor ? 
 Is it a two-pin socket ? 
 Good , I ' Ve get a two-pin plug . 
 I ’ m sorry registration has closed . 
 Well , that ’ s not possible . The computer ’ s official student account has already been sent to the state . And that ’ s what our budget is based on . Who told you that anyway ? 
 She must have been a part-time worker . They didn ’ t have much training . Why didn ’ t you register then ? 
 Huh , that is no reason to demand a birth certificate . We only need to establish residency , you know , a phone bill with your name and address on it would have been fine . 
 Yes , I am afraid she gave you the wrong information . 
 Well , I sympathize with your problem , but , to be honest , I don ’ t think there is any thing anyone can do for you . You were trapped in the system.If you want , you can talk to the director . She will help you if she can . 
 Don ’ t get your hopes up . 
 Yes , I'd like to make reservation for tonight , a table for five , please . 
 Around 8 . 
 Frank London . Any chance of a table by the window ? 
 I'll appreciate it if it could be arranged . 
 I would like to buy some flowers , please . Something really nice . 
 It ’ s not really an occasion , it ’ s more like I ’ m sorry . 
 I think I ’ m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . What else do you recommend ? 
 I don ’ t think that ’ s gonna cut it . I need something bigger and better ! 
 Well , I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier . 
 What are you listening now , Fred ? 
 Hey ! Man , put your earphone out . I said which song you are listening to . 
 What's your comment on his new album ? 
 Let me enjoy it . 
 I cann't wait for buying his CD now . 
 Off hand , I'd say the Reader's Digests is my favorite . 
 It's instructive and inspiring . 
 No , it's a semimonthly . 
 Yes , it's so popular that it's sold out as soon as it reaches the bookstores . 
 Hey , Bob . Are you getting the feeling you've been here before ? 
 Maybe we're walking in circles . 
 Hey , Jack , I'd better go now . 
 Right ! And I have to finish the report by 5:30 p . m . 
 Okay , no problem . Bye ! 
 What do you plan on making as a side dish for dinner ? 
 Do you know what kind ? 
 I wouldn't mind eating some corn . 
 What do you mean ? 
 You should throw some corn on the grill . 
 That sounds good . 
 Do you have any direct flights to Toronto ? 
 When does the flight depart ? 
 How long is the layover ? 
 And how long do I have to stay in Berlin for the connecting flight ? 
 So the time for the total journey is about ... ? 
 Let me count . Ok , it works out for my schedule . Thanks a lot ! 
 Did you get a nice tree ? 
 Let's put it over there . 
 Let's string the lights first.Then we won't have to mess up the decorations . 
 There , ... we're about done . 
 OK . Here goes . 
 Here's your drink , sir . 
 Oh , I'm terribly sorry , sir . I'll go and get you cola right away . 
 Yes , sir . I'll bring your drink right away . 
 Is there , sir ? I'm very sorry . I'll change it straight away . 
 I'm really sorry . 
 Yes , I'd like to make a reservation for eight tonight . 
 At 7:30 pm . And I would like to sit in the non-smoking area . 
 The private room , please . 
 It will be for business dinner . Reserve it under the name of Nova , the manager of Fashion Clothes Company . 
 I hear your daughter graduated from high school as the valedictorian . 
 Where is she going to college ? 
 Really ? That's the icing on the cake . Congratulation again ! 
 Excuse me , How do I get to the Grand hotel ? 
 The Grand hotel , is it far from here ? 
 David , I ’ m going to China . 
 You know . I took part in the Chinese contest . I was the best and they gave me this reward . I don ’ t have to pay for my trip . 
 Thank you . I ’ m leaving tomorrow morning . 
 I ’ m sure I will . 
 Thank you , David . 
 I don ’ t know . I didn ’ t really feel like going out . I guess I ’ m feeling a little homesick . 
 I was . It ’ s just that the holidays are coming up and I won ’ t be able to home because I can ’ t afford the airfare . I ’ m just longing for some of the comforts of home , like my mom ’ s cooking and being around my family . 
 I see what you mean , but I ’ m still bummed out . 
 You know , I could really go for that . You don ’ t mind being my wingman for tonight ? 
 Great ! I must warn you though , whatever happens , don ’ t let me go on a drinking binge . Trust me , it ’ s not a pretty picture ! 
 Hi . It ’ s Tony calling from the dentist ’ s office . Is Lily there ? 
 Could you ask her to call me back when she gets in ? 
 519 367 8901 . 
 Yes . I ’ m Tony . Thank you very much . 
 Bye . 
 I'd like to have a shave . 
 Sure . But my beard is rough . 
 Yes , please . 
 Wonderful . How much is the cost altogether ? 
 Here you are . Thank you , bye-bye ! 
 Shall we buy ? 
 But if you were me ? 
 I used to think that Americans had so much money they didn ’ t know what to do with it . 
 Yes . But now I ’ Ve learned differently . Now I have a more realistic opinion . 
 There are lots of jobs , and almost everybody works . There is a high standard of living . People earn a lot , but they spend a lot to live . So there isn ’ t so much money after all . 
 That ’ s true . But Americans work hard for their money like we do . I don ’ t know why our spending habits are so different . 
 Yes . But you have to transfer to Bus No . 28 . 
 At Tinge Depot . 
 I will remind you to get off . 
 My pleasure . 
 No . Of course not . But what for ? 
 I see . But I'm busy now . How about tomorrow ? 
 I am afraid there isn ’ t . 
 There is a desk and two chairs . 
 They are behind the door . 
 Yeah , what's up ? 
 Excuse me . I want to pay the bill . 
 Here you are . 
 No , I'll e paying for myself , but I have private medical insurance . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Look ! Mom , that's amazing ! I can't believe the girls have so neat movements . 
 And all their movements are so elegant . It seems like dancing in the water . 
 There you go ! Daddy has told me that water ballet is also called Synchronized Swimming . 
 Wow , Mom is more knowledgeable than Dad . I must learn from you . 
 OK , you're the boss . Look , Mom , one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool . 
 What's the matter here ? 
 When did you find out ? 
 Apparently forced entry . The lock is battered to pieces . 
 He is so unskillful . I have never seen such an awkward burglar . 
 Probably . Let's check the inside then . 
 Yes , the house was in a terrible mess . It was almost turned upside down by the burglar . 
 You mean it is not created by the burglar ? 
 May I see the manager of your office ? 
 Thank you . I am Fred , coming from Future Clothes Company . I've brought some catalogues of our new series of the summer clothes . I wonder if your manager would like to have a look at them . 
 We are suppliers of the summer clothes of various styles and colors . I think you will be interested in some of our new products . We always keep the pace of the clothes fashion , so as to catch the interest of our customers . 
 As you know , we also take orders for clothes made according to specifications . 
 Two months at most . 
 Yes , of course , here you are . The prices are subject to our confirmation . 
 Sure . Any specific reason I should know about in case people ask where you are . 
 No problem . Good luck . 
 Hi , Sven , can you help me ? Could you hold the end of the tape measure , please ? 
 Just there by the door . I need to measure the length of this workbench . We're going to replace it . OK - 3 m 47 cm . Let's round it up to 3 m 50 . 
 Tell me what size you want and I'll order the wood . 
 Sure . So let's see . We need a piece of wood 3.5 m long by 1 m wide . I'll order it right away and I'll be able to install it next Tuesday . 
 That's right . I know it must sound crazy to you , but we believe there will be fewer absences this way . 
 Right now , we have incentives encouraging employees to come to work as often as possible.But employees with colds and the flu are coming to work and infecting their colleagues . 
 That's right . If sick days were mandatory , sick people would stay home . We wouldn't have these company-wide epidemics . 
 Have some more tea , George . 
 Have a nice day ! 
 Ahhs ! I'm beat ! 
 I just got back from fighting the crowds . 
 Yeah . For five minutes , everything was half off . It was total chaos ... 
 Grabbing , pushing and shoving ... 
 No , thank you . I've given up , you know . 
 Well , all tight . But you know , smoking does do harm to your health . 
 Why don't you try and give it up ? 
 Walter , did you email that document to Mr . Lin yesterday ? 
 That's strange . I have Mr . Lin on the phone right now , and he says that he didn't receive any email from us yesterday . Are you sure you sent it ? 
 All the food smells tasty today and makes my mouth water . 
 What's on the menu today ? 
 Oh , we're lucky today , aren't we ? 
 I think I'll take fried fish , because fish is one of my favorites . 
 ( They get everything ready ) Here is a free table . Let's sit down . Help yourself to some fish please . Isn't it delicious and appetizing ? 
 I see . You people from south prefer sweet , don't you ? 
 Thank you . I'm through with one steamed bread and I'd like a second helping . 
 I'm always feeling hungry . 
 Would you like some coffee or tea ? 
 How would you like your coffee ? 
 Coffee will be right with you . 
 We also have to vacuum the house . 
 You'd better believe it . 
 No . You're going to do the entire house . 
 I'm going to mow the lawn . 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry . It completely slipped my mind . 
 Definitely , I ’ m really sorry . 
 Yes . This is Peter calling from New York , I have to change the date of reservation . 
 By telephone and in my name . 
 Right , but the negotiation has been postponed until 5th to 7th of April . Do you think it's possible for us to change the reservation ? 
 My granny is such a kind-hearted person . She is willing to help . 
 You can say that again . 
 How long have you been sick ? 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 I am sorry , sir . Your fish will be ready in five minutes so you can't change it . 
 Excuse me , could you help me ? 
 Well . I was wondering if anyone has turned in a passport ? 
 I think so . I can't find it anywhere in my hotel room and I remember the last place I used it yesterday was in this department store . 
 In the shoe department . I had to show it to pay for these shoes with my traveler's cheques . 
 Then what shall I do ? 
 You are right . Do you have a pen ? 
 Oh , I seem to lose something every time I travel . 
 Yes , it's not like what the radio said at all . 
 As long as it doesn't snow ! 
 Who cares ? She is pretty . 
 You're just jealous . 
 At least you haven't landed in the water yet . I've done that on the last two holes . 
 Here you go . I'll wait for you to get on the green before I putt . 
 No way , Mary . I'm going to let you go first . I don't want the pressure of putting first . 
 I have no idea , any suggestions ? 
 It must be fun . But you know , I am not good at chess . I never won since I've learnt to play chess . 
 OK , settled then . 
 See you ! 
 Yes . What can I do for you ? 
 What ? I can barely hear you because your veiled voice ? 
 What salary are you expecting ? 
 It can be anywhere between 100,000 to 200,000 a year depending on experience and qualifications . 
 Susan , Did you know the four ugliest women in ancient China ? 
 There were some famous ugly women in history . 
 Though they were ugly , they had great virtue . 
 Mo Mu , Thong Lichen , Meng Gang and Ran Nv . They were well respected . 
 Sometimes the inner beauty is more beautiful . 
 There is a man-made fishing pond nearby . So , What do you think of going fishing there ? 
 Patience , boy . A watched pot never boils . We shall get out fishing stuff first and make some baits , too . 
 I don't think fish would like them . Instead , they love earth worms . 
 OK . I think that's enough for today . Let's go . 
 That's because you're talking to me all the time . Be patient , or there will be no chance to have sashimi for dinner today . 
 I suppose she did . Be quiet . There is a fish on the hook . Here it is . Look , a big one . 
 Great idea . But the fact is we have no barbecue with us . Moreover , the sashimi will be great . So why do we bother to waste time on barbecuing the fish ? 
 Let's go see pandas ! The news said that two pandas arrived at the zoo last week . 
 How can we get there ? 
 OK ! Let's go . 
 Yes , you can find hundreds of various animals here . It is the biggest zoo in Taiwan . 
 Where can find the pandas ? I think we are here to see the pandas . 
 It should take at least 20 minutes to get there . Are there any shuttle buses running place to place around the whole zoo ? 
 Thank you , Mr . Owens , for taking time out of your busy schedule to interview me . 
 When can I contact you about your final decision ? 
 Thanks a lot ! I will look forward to the good news . Please call me at this number between nine and eleven in the morning . 
 The pleasure is mine . It ’ s nice talking with you . Good-bye , Mr . Owens . 
 Recently I have been getting headache and my eyes come to see focus properly . 
 Two years ago . At that time I had no problems . Now I can ’ t even make out something ten meters away . 
 All right . 
 Well , this one is worse . 
 I can only read the first three lines . 
 Hi . I've been sent over from Turner Interiors . They said I need to collect some sort of L / C ? Do you have it ? 
 It should be from Sayuri Beds . Is that right ? 
 That's what I want ! Do you need me to sign anything ? Or fill in some forms ? 
 Perfect . Thank you , goodbye ! 
 What do you mean ? 
 What style do you want ? 
 Exactly how short do you want it ? 
 Are you sure you want me to cut it that short ? 
 Okay . I'll do it if you're positive that this is what you want . 
 All right , then let's begin . 
 Oh , hi Stacy . 
 I worked over the summer at a restaurant . Have to make tuition money , right ? What did you do ? 
 So are you officially a junior now ? 
 That makes sense . So where is Nicole ? 
 Really ? Why ? 
 Wow . She's so lucky . She doesn't have a degree and she already has a job . 
 Do you know how much they are paying her ? 
 And anything to drink ? 
 How do you like your coffee ? 
 Then how about the wine ? Is white wine OK ? 
 Waiter , the dish is cold to eat . Could you please heat it up for me ? 
 By the way , I would like some chilli oil . 
 Are you still on your summer vacation ? 
 When will school start ? 
 Hello , may I speak with the property manager , please ? 
 During that horrible rainstorm last night , my roof began to leak . 
 It was in our bedroom . 
 We are on the top floor . 
 Yes , we will be in . 
 May I know how long will it take to get some more in from the factory ? 
 When will you be able to deliver ? 
 How big is this parking lot in our community ? 
 So you guys should be always busy . 
 I bet it is always full of cars . 
 Ah ... I see . 
 What is the hourly rate for a car like this ? 
 How mush would it cost if someone parks here for one hour and ten minutes ? 
 That's expensive . 
 Yes . She believes everything about him . 
 Yes . If she doesn't believe it , Christmas won't be so exciting to her . 
 I'm not going to tell her . She will find out and understand when she grows older . 
 Yes , do you have sweaters ? 
 You have quite a range , haven't you ? I would like to see some other styles . 
 I am wondering if you do facial care ? 
 How much would it be ? 
 I'm afraid 800 is too expensive for me . Could you recommend something around 300 ? 
 What are you doing this Saturday ? 
 Do you want to go see a movie ? 
 What's playing at the Century Fox ? 
 Should we go see it ? 
 How about ‘ Run of the Mill ? ’ 
 Why don't we go to a concert instead ? 
 Do you have anything in particular that you would like our firm to take into account ? 
 No problem . We will offer you a room with one bedroom and a kitchen ..

 Exactly what kind of help did you have in mind ? 
 So if I can help you as a consultant , what is in for me ? 
 Do you really think we can beat WebTracker ? 
 How can you be so sure ? Do you know something I don't ? 
 What's step two ?

 Yes , Beijing has been grown over the last few years , there are a lot of improvements and changes being made for the Olympics . What would you like to see changing be made for Olympic , what would you like to see when are you here ?

 I would like to open an account today . 
 I want to open a checking account . 
 How much is it ? 
 Is that all ? 
 What happens if I don ’ t meet that requirement ? 
 How much ? 
 Susan , I haven't seen you in the pub for a long time . 
 That explains it . 
 Just go straight along this street , turn left at the first crossing and walk straight ahead about 100 meters . You can ’ t miss it . 
 It ’ s about 20 minutes ’ walk , I think . 
 Yes , you can take the No . 5 bus over there . Get off at the next stop . 
 It ’ s my pleasure . 
 Sure . At what time ? 
 I am sorry , sir . We are booked until 9:10 .

 Great . You can move in next Monday . Your first month's rent is due then . 
 You have much patience . 
 Thank you . Today I'm writing a kind of poem called a Chinese couplet . 
 This is an especially famous one . It says " May the passing days bring you health and longevity . May this season of renewal find you basked in riches . " 
 No . I never sell my artwork . 
 I give it away . Here , this one is for you . 
 Remember , real luck must be created ( by ) yourself , and then it cannot be given or taken away ... 
 Todd , I am so happy you called ! 
 Boy , Todd , that was one great movie you picked out ! Thanks for asking me to go with you ! 
 A hike would be great ! Let me pack us a nice picnic lunch , OK ?

 thank you ! 
 bye ! 
 And a typical example has been the Chinese athletes at the Beijing Olympics , right ? 
 Then what are the Westerners fit for ? 
 Where do you think the edge is for black athletes ? 
 I got you . Their competitive edge lies mainly in endurance and stamina . They are creatures from the savannah , and take to running like antelopes . 
 Oh , what's up ? 
 Well , the best thing to do is to go down to the front desk and ask for a duplicate key . 
 Yes . I am very interested in the Olympic Games , and I'm especially excited about 2008 Beijing Olympics . 
 That's cool . Care for a little quiz on that ? 
 Wow , you've talked the talk . Now it's time to walk the walk . Here we go . First , can you tell me something about the ancient Olympics ? 
 Good . Why do people name it Olympics ? 
 Who started the modern Olympics ? 
 What did people call him ? 
 What did he do for restoring the Olympics ? 
 Well , that's for all . Excellent ! 
 Come on in . Make yourself at home . 
 Good morning , sir.Can I help you ? 
 Thank you , Mr.Wang.Do you have an appointment ? 
 I'm afraid Mr.Li is engaged at the moment . Would you mind waiting ? 
 About half an hour . 
 Can the Assistant Manager meet you instead ? 
 Do you want to make another appointment ? 
 Yes , I'll make a note of that and ask Mr.Li to confirm . 
 Take it easy . I have to cut my losses . 
 I see . Well , now you can have it as long as you bring it back by nine thirty . 
 I ’ m afraid not , Nick . That ’ s the best I can do . 
 I'm not feeling too well . I've caught a cold . 
 Hasn't it ! It's been cold and windy recently.Do you like the weather here ? 
 Oh , I'm going for a trip to New York this autumn . What's the weather like in New York ? 
 Is it cold in autumn there ? Should I take any warm clothes with me ? 
 We are here . 
 The total is 45 yuan . 
 It is 45 yuan on the meter . 
 No . I am sure about that . 
 Yes . This is your receipt . 
 I want to check in . 
 No , I want a double room . By the way , is there any discount for children ? 
 Ok , please have me arrange one . 
 I've seen her on TV but not in the flesh . 
 Can I have a look at that digital camera please ? 
 How much does it cost ? 
 It looks pretty good . I think I'll take it . 
 That's all thank you . 
 It comes to $ 40 . 
 Of course . I will find you one . 
 Working . Why ? 
 I ’ m sorry , Melissa . I really can ’ t today . I ’ Ve just got too much going on . Maybe tomorrow . 
 Our price will be not less than $ 5000 . 
 This is already our best price . 
 Well , what would you suggest ? 
 I'm afraid that there is no room to negotiate the price . This is the best price we can quote . 
 What do you mean ? 
 You drive a hard bargain ! OK , that's a deal . 
 Darlene ! Indeed , it ’ s been a while ! How have you been ? Wow , you look amazing ! I love what you ’ Ve done with your hair ! 
 Ha ha , come on ! Well , I ’ Ve been watching what I eat , and working out three times a week . By the way , I heard your son recently graduated ! 
 He is such a handsome guy . He gets his looks from his mother of course ! 
 Oh yes . She had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel Mexico and we all attended . 
 But of course ! Well , it ’ s been great talking to you , but I have to get going . 
 That would be great ! Give me a call ! 
 Wow , that terrible movie is finally over . Next time I ’ m picking the film , because I don ’ t want to end up seeing a chick flick . 
 Not everything , just this film . Even the title is ridiculous , and it ’ s so long , those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life , so much so that I ’ m thinking about asking them to give me my money back . 
 I ’ m only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage . 
 Next time , go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings . 
 Love stories ? More like one-night-stands . 
 My friends ? Fat ? What about those whales you call friends ? 
 OK class , so today we are going to continue with our anatomy class , today we will review everything we have learned . Can anyone tell me what the first major organ is ? 
 That's right , the brain ! It serves as a control center for the body , handling the processes of the central nervous system as well as cognition . Then what major organ is in our chest ? 
 Very good ! It pumps blood throughout the body , using the circulatory system such as blood vessels and veins . Now let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive ! Now what about the organs that help us digest food ? 
 Very good ! Let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food and our intestines process that food and then expel the waste . Are we forgetting anything ? 
 Oh yes , you are right . Very important organs indeed . 
 Well , mumm , they ... Time for a break ! We can talk about it when you get back . 
 I have an opening . Do you have an add sheet for me to sign ? 
 After I sign it , you must take it to the Admissions and Records Office to add the class . Do you know where that is ? 
 When you cross the quad , the office is right in front of you . Go inside and follow the signs to the correct line . 
 It should be easy to find . After you add the class , check with me in a few weeks to make sure that you are on my roll sheet . 
 Good , just make sure that you do the same thing if you ever need to drop a class . Good luck ! 
 Yeah ? 
 You just put quarters in the machines.It ' s easy . 
 What ? 
 What do you mean ? These are the washing machines . Those big things over there are the dryers . 
 No , of course not . You have to put soap in . Did you bring your soap ? 
 Well , you can buy some from that vending machine over there . 
 My God ! You really bought a lot . Why do you need so much ? 
 But you can't use so much.The machine won't be able to rinse the soap out . 
 What ? Did you say you never washed clothes before ? 
 In your life ? Are you kidding ? Never ? 
 I can't believe it . How can that be ? How old are you ? 
 But how can you live nineteen years without ever washing clothes ? 
 Yes , my mother washed my clothes too.But when I was twelve , I started to wash clothes myself . 
 I'm not laughing at you . But let me ask you something ? 
 How are you going to survive here ? I mean , if you can't do anything for yourself.If you can't cook , if you can't wash clothes , if you can't clean house.How can you live on your own ? 
 Well , I'll help you learn how to use these machines . 
 I'm Alice . I guess I'll have to be your mother for today . 
 Who's your favorite film star ? 
 What films feature him ? 
 Do you have a double room for tonight ? 
 Without is fine . 
 That's right . 
 By the way , what's the rate for a single room ? 
 I can't deny that . She is so beautiful that I fell in love with her at the first sight . I wish I knew more about her . 
 I can not belive that . It must be cooked up by someone . 
 Yes . I have published some articles in China Daily and Economist . 
 As a journalist , I have strong communication skills . I am good at both discourse management and strategic competence . 
 I was born and grew up in hebes Province . I moved to Beijing , where I started taking courses for my MBA . When I completed my degree , I was offered an opportunity working for a financial services company . I've worked there for eight years . 
 I was assigned a project to design a 360 - degree performance system . It was a challenge for a person with a finance background . I met with the technical people and discussed the possibilities and obstacles . Based on that information , I selected a team and created a spreadsheet to manage the project . We got the project done on schedule . I was rewarded for outstanding results and was able to share the honors with the team . 
 For the past eight years , I have been working in the banking industry . I have a solid understanding of accounting concepts , an analytical mind and a strong attention to detail . I've had a lot of customer service training and experience , and I have been told that I excel in this area . 
 They'd say I was a handworker and a real team player . 
 I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . I'd like to postpone that decision until later . 
 Yes I can . I speak it very well . 
 I lived in England when I was a child . 
 Well , I know a little Italian . 
 Sorry , I ’ m looking for my wallet . 
 Yes . A lot of cash . Almost forty thousand pounds . 
 It seems that is a better way . Thank you . 
 Hi , Sandra . how was your weekend ? 
 Fantastic ! how was that ? 
 I might . what did you do yesterday ? 
 Does it bother you that your husband goes away on long business trips ? 
 Have you begun cleaning up that room of yours ? 
 What time are you going to clean it up ? 
 I told you to clean it up earlier . 
 Make sure you vacuum and dust your room . 
 I don't want you to leave until you clean up . 
 Can I help you ? 
 How much do you need ? 
 All right , can I have your passbook ? 
 What amounts do you want the checks in ? 
 Here you are . 
 How may I help you ? 
 Is that all you need ? 
 You ’ re not allowed to do that . 
 It ’ s our policy . 
 Only books or videos . 
 You will have to read it here . 
 How much for the bus ride ? 
 How long have you been a bus driver ? 
 Is it fun driving the bus ? 
 I don't think I ever wanted to be a bus driver . 
 I enjoyed talking to you . 
 What do you think of AC milan and the team of Argentine ? 
 Yes , I think AC Milan's foot work is much better on the whole . 
 Well , I must be off now . I have an appointment at six . 
 Ok , Goodbye . 
 I ’ m tired , Larry . Can we have a break ? 
 I know , but I ’ m really tired . My stomach feels funny . 
 I was too excited to sleep last night . I didn ’ t go to sleep until quite late . 
 About 2 o ’ clock in the morning . 
 About 2 o ’ clock . 
 You did , but I can ’ t help it . 
 Which one do I choose ? I don ’ t want to give up , but I really feel tired . 
 Let me think about it . What should I do ? I think I will not give up . 
 Certainly . As you can see , we have several three-piece suites on sale . Feel free to sit down and test how comfortable they are . 
 Yes . The price has been reduced by 50 % . It ’ s a real bargain . 
 Those floor lamps are very nice and you can vary the brightness according to whether you ’ re reading or watching tv . How big is your living room ? 
 I ’ d suggest you buy two . That allows you to change the brightness of the room better . 
 Here's our sample room . 
 Yes . We are exporting a wide range of foodstuffs to many countries . And the demand is getting greater and greater.By the way , which items are you interested in ? 
 Yes . This way , please . Our shortbread is in a variety of flavors , such as almond , walnut , lotus seed , etc . And different packaging has different weights . We can make packages within a reasonable range of any size you require . 
 You are welcome to have a try . Here it is . Ours is of prime quality . 
 Look at the catalogue , John . I think I want to get this red blouse 
 Yah , but it doesn't have a red one . 
 Yes ! 
 Believe it or not , one of the narrowest street in the world is only 49cm wide . 
 That's what I'm wondering , too . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Yes , we can arrange that . 
 Our travel agency provides all kinds of tours , ranging from individual tour to group package tour . 
 When do you expect to come ? 
 What specific places do you wish to visit ? 
 OK . 
 Yes , I did . It is a horrible movie . 
 Actually , more and more people have realized that violence on TV may lead to the increase of crime rates among teenagers . 
 But anyhow there are many worthwhile programs . 
 yes , but I didn't really like the third one at all . 
 yeah . Even though the customs were brilliant , I didn't think it was as good as the first two . What did you think ? 
 did you read the books before you watched the movies ? 
 yes , I've read them many times . I think it's much easier to follow for people who were already familiar with all the characters . 
 I also think that it was much better in the theatre than at home . 
 that happens a lot in non-English speaking countries . 
 actually , they not only had 11 nominations , but they won 11 Oscars , too ! 
 I want to buy a new camcorder for my trip this summer . 
 not really . I thought I'd just have a look today . 
 sure . I'd like to see the smallest camcorder that you have first . 
 it's very light . That would be good . How is the battery life ? 
 can you also take still photos with this ? 
 how about night vision ? Can you use it in the dark ? 
 that's not bad at all . How's the microphone ? Does it pick up much sound ? 
 how does that compare with other models ? 
 I guess you can't have everything , can you ? 
 I'm a great driver . 
 Have you gotten your learner's permit ? 
 Have you ever been behind the wheel ? 
 You do know all the controls in the car , don't you ? 
 Tell me when you want me to teach you . 
 I'm not busy tomorrow . Call me then . 
 That's great ! You need to prepare for it . 
 Get your hair done at a good hair saloon . Tell them you are going for a job interview . 
 Buy a decent suit . 
 Yeah , fine . And dressing shoes . 
 Not much make up . 
 Jason , you have no taste . You think First Blood is a good movie . 
 I'm sorry , but it's a bad movie . The plot is stupid , and the script is poorly written . 
 No , I don't like action movies because I'm cultured ! 
 Good morning I'd like to mail this box of books to Taiwan . 
 How long does it take to reach Taiwan by sea ? 
 That's too long.How long does it take to reach Taiwan by airmail ? 
 Then how much is that by airmail ? 
 That's a little bit expensive . 
 I guess I have to send it by airmail . 
 Yes , please . 
 OK . 
 Better , thank you , doctor . 
 Certainly , doctor . Come upstairs . 
 Does he have a temperature , doctor ? 
 Must he stay in bed ? 
 He's in bed , doctor . Can you see him , please ? He has a bad cold , too ! 
 I'm sorry . I don't think so . 
 It's much too hard for his age . 
 Yes , Mr . Bergeron . You mentioned that in your letter . To tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us . 
 Do you sell direct to shops ? 
 Do you keep a stock of these things ? 
 That is , your commission . 
 Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission . 
 According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ? 
 We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ... 
 Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect . 
 Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details . 
 Oh , yes . We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction . 
 Very good . We will discuss the matter again at the next Fair . 
 Oh , but I suppose he has lots of talents . 
 What can I get you ? 
 Would you like anything to drink ? 
 That's a good idea . I think I'll join you . 
 Yeah , it happened a week ago . 
 Fortunately , she's not seriously injured . 
 Sure . Have you checked the weather report ? 
 I'd like some toast and chicken wings . 
 Done . Oh , don't forget to take napkins , disposable plates , cups and picnic blanket . 
 Cool , we can take shuttlecock and badminton racket . 
 Here is the fish counter . Look at the lobsters and crabs . Shall we have some ? 
 Sorry , I forgot . I don ’ t like seafood , neither . 
 Let's get frozen juice . It is really good . We ’ Ve got enough food . Let ’ s go over to the check-out stand . 
 Hello ? 
 No , not out of order . But we seem to have a bad connection on the phone line . I can ’ t hear you clearly . 
 Sure . Thanks . 
 Yes . I locked myself out . May I borrow a duplicate key for Room 201 ? 
 I'm right outside my room . 
 Can I help you in any way ? 
 How do you like this pattern ? The pink suits you well . 
 It's of good quality . 
 After all , he is a baby . 
 Jim , could you do me a favor ? 
 My car has a problem starting . Could you please take a look at it for me ? 
 Are you sure ? 
 Thanks for helping me out . I really appreciate it . 
 Are you ok ? You seem a bit anxious . 
 So you mean you feel ecstatic one minute and then blue the next ? 
 Well , maybe your mood will swing positively and you will feel confident , brave and hopeful ! 
 I ’ m terribly sorry to cause you so much trouble . 
 Body language in the interview is closely related to the job-hunter's image . 
 You should look the interviewer in the eye so as to show that you are carefully listening to him . 
 When you are seated , bent forward a little with your hands crossed , to show you respect the interviewer . 
 Proper posture can show your confidence . 
 Pay attention to keeping eye contact as well . 
 In a word , you should keep decent manners in the interview . 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Well , we have a package tour there . 
 $ 600 . 
 Of course . 
 Yes , I'm looking for a cap . Size 16 . 
 Yes . It's a bit tight . Have you got a bigger one ? 
 Yes , that's fine . I'll take it . Can I pay by check ? 
 I can't seem to progress up the career ladder no matter how hard I try and I have been here for 2 years already ! 
 An MBA , hey . . . well my degree wasn't in business , the business schools won't be interested in me . 
 GMAT ? What does that stand for and what will the test contain ? 
 Okay , this sounds a little tough , how am I supposed to practice for this ? 
 No matter what I do , I'm going to ace this test and go on to become a corporate fat cat ! 
 Tom , you look thoughtful and unhappy recently . What's wrong with you ? 
 Why ? I mean , why did she part company with you after seven years together ? 
 Do you believe her excuse ? 
 Come on , buddy , cheer up . Why not do some sports with me ? Violent exercise might help to shake you out of your disappointment in love . 
 Can you shorten this pipe for me ? It's too long . 
 Can you take 15 mm of it ? 
 How do you think the transport system in our city could be improved ? 
 I think we just need to build more roads . Then there would be more space for cars to drive and we ’ d have fewer traffic jams . 
 How would you do that ? 
 I don ’ t know . I think it ’ s unfair to make drivers pay more money . They already pay a lot of tax-petrol tax , for example . 
 The air would certainly be cleaner if there were fewer cars being used in the city . The problem is that people will see it as reducing their freedom . It well be unpopular . 
 I'm checking out now . Can I have my bill , please ? 
 It's 8736 . Here is my key card . 
 Can I pay with traveler's check ? 
 Here you are . 
 Very much . The room is cozy and the service is jolly good . By the way , could you deliver my luggage to the airport in advance ? 
 Flight 17 . And my luggage should be delivered there by 4 o'clock . 
 Thank you . 
 Why not ? It's my parking space . 
 Oh ? That's a surprise . Let me see ... D 0411 Our dog's birthday . Yes , I'm sure this my parking space ! 
 Oh , we've just repainted our car . It was red . 
 Yeah . It used to . We got that fixed yesterday too . 
 Sure , go ahead . 
 That's all right . It's not your fault . 
 Thanks , Jim . I didn ’ t think guys paid attention to stuff like that . 
 Well , thanks for the compliment anyway ! 
 Yes , of course . We could split it . What part would you like to do , the food or the entertainment ? 
 Let's make sure we are on the same page . Do we want a formal or informal gathering ? 
 Yes , that would be best . Now , for food should we have Chinese or American food ? 
 That would be great . What kind of music would you like , a band or recorded music ? 
 That works for me . Let's see what we can each do about planning our part and meet again on Friday . 
 Oh , uh ... Thanks . Henry , do you have a light ? 
 Thanks . Lovely day . Pity I ’ m on duty . 
 Oh , no . I couldn ’ t possibly . 
 We ’ Ve thought about it , but my husband and I can ’ t afford it right now . The only thing we could afford would be living in the slums , which is something I don ’ t want to do . 
 Like what ? 
 That ’ s a good idea . Do you know anyone who has done that before ? 
 Is the house pretty run-down . 
 Was it a very old house ? 
 Is it in a good location ? 
 I ’ m forming a music band . 
 Uh ... Yeah ! I ’ Ve told you a thousand times that I ’ m learning to play the drums . Now that I know how to play well , I would like to form a rock band . 
 We have a guy who plays guitar , and another who plays bass.Although we still haven ’ t found anyone to be our singer . You told me that you had some musical talent , right ? 
 Perfect . So you can audition this weekend here at my house . 
 What a good day ! 
 Right . Let's go out and enjoy the beautiful natural scenery . 
 Wow , what a beautiful lake ! The green hills and clear water really provide magnificent scenery . 
 I feel as if I'm living in a different world , honey . 
 I think we should go out more frequently . The natural scenery can do us good . 
 Right . The city life has made us tired and out of energy , while the natural world can bring us quite new feelings . 
 No , I shouldn ’ t think so . But you must take your passport of course . 
 Yes , you need the traveler ’ s check but you needn ’ t get any foreign currency . You can have my US Dollars , I don ’ t need them . 
 You needn ’ t buy one . You can have mine . 
 Don ’ t be silly , John . I ’ m going with you . It ’ s necessary for me to have a holiday too . 
 It should take us back up to Altadena . 
 I'm not really sure if it does or not . 
 I've never taken this bus , but I think it's the right one . 
 That's true , and we have been on this bus for a while . 
 Yikes ! Temple City . 
 My bad , but at least we know the right bus to take us back . 
 How do you do ? 
 My name is Jim Jones . Are you coming for the interview ? 
 The channel boats are quite fast , aren't they ? 
 I hope we shan't have a rough passage . 
 That's a good idea . 
 Yes , unfortunately . I'm very much subject to it . 
 Yes , this little boat gets up a fine speed , and I think we'll soon get to the land . 
 Here you are . How is Danny ? 
 What did the doctor say ? 
 Shall we go back home now ? 
 I bought some advanced medicine . Is there anything you need ? 
 Now what ? 
 Okay , this is the third time . 
 You don't have to know . Bye for now . 
 Morning , Madam . This is the window for Foreign Exchange Savings . How can I help you ? 
 That's fine . Is it a Time Deposit ? 
 Well , we offer 5 grades as standard 
 For 6 months we can offer you 0.59 % . 
 Can I get you something to drink ? 
 I guess I could take a break.So , how do you like Denver ? 
 About six years ... 
 I manage one of the ski lodges.It ' s a great job , I can spend a lot of my time outdoors , and I also get to ski for free all season . 
 That's okay.If it weren't for you accountants , nobody would have the money to go skiing ! 
 But it's still early . 
 But Day . I'm not sleepy . 
 Have you packed our passports ? 
 Of course . Otherwise I cannot go abroad . 
 Not at all . But we do need to keep it with us all the time . 
 Have you been having any problems lately ? 
 Do you have a history of high blood pressure ? 
 High blood pressure is called the silent killer because it hardly ever has symptoms . 
 We are going to use this cuff here , and it will give me a reading . 
 They tell me how much your heart is working at rest and when pumping blood . 
 I can ’ t believe the cost of apartments in New York City . 
 Of course I had heard about that , but now I know how expensive it is to rent a place here . 
 Why ? You pay so much for such a tiny space to live . 
 Is this taxi taken ? 
 Yes.Will you take me to the station ? 
 Thanks . 
 I have a severe headache now . 
 Would you like to go with me ? I ’ m afraid of the hospital . 
 What is that ? 
 Cool ! 
 What about all these other pieces ? 
 And these two ? They are husband and wife ? 
 Nah ! This is boring ! I ’ m gonna go play Killer Zombies on my PlayStation ! 
 But why ? 
 OK , I see . 
 Yes , that will be just as good . 
 All right . Then I can do some shopping today before going back to my country . 
 Just a few cookies . 
 I have found it quite different here from China since I came to the United States . 
 Some friends of mine took me to the mall to go shopping . It was so big . I think I could get lost if I went there alone . 
 Not really many . I was told that on weekends there were always the flea markets , so I decided to come to the flea market to buy a bargain . 
 I have heard about it while in China . it is called a " yard sale " . I didn't have any idea of that until today when I came here to the big " yard sale " . 
 Hey , you , pick up that piece of garbage ! 
 Yeah , you . I just saw you throw a piece of garbage on the ground . Can't you read the No Littering sign ? It's a $ 500 penalty for littering , so go pick it up and put it in the garbage can over there . 
 Because this is a public place , and I want to spend my time here without having to look at your garbage . 
 It's not the cleaner's responsibility to pick up after lazy people . It's part of your responsibility to make sure that the place is neat for other people . If everyone thought like you , there'd be garbage everywhere ! The cleaners can't be everywhere ! 
 Hold on , that's an item . You should put that in the recycle bin next to the trashcan . 
 Actually there is a sample over there . But if you still have a problem , let me know . 
 I wonder if we can change to Channel 5 . 
 I want to know what's on that channel . 
 There is a football match . 
 OK . Could you turn it down ? 
 I'm going to listen to the radio . 
 Don't worry . I'm sure you'll do better next time . 
 It doesn't matter . Forget it . 
 Oh ! That's much hetter than I did . 
 There's no secret at all . The only thing for you to do is to practice more . You will succeed . 
 It's a pleasure . Come on . I'm on your side . 
 I started a new job last month and I'm expecting my first salary . 
 So I was told , yes . They gave me this book ? 
 All right . I want to bring everybody in on this project . When can we start working on this ? 
 I tell you what , 8: 00 is no good for me , but why don't you guys get started and I'll come by at around 8: 45 or so . 
 I am past my stop . Would you please let me get off ? 
 Well , that's OK . 
 OK . 
 Lizzy who ? 
 Of course I do . 
 You mean Mary ? 
 Sure . I know her elder sister Sue and younger sister Mary . 
 Yes , certainly . I know her mother and father , and brother and sisters , too . 
 Why do you ask me these questions ? 
 It was great meeting you . 
 Maybe we can meet again sometime ? 
 Then , I ’ ll see you next week , Ms . O ’ Brian ? 
 Certainly . Is there anything else you would like me to bring , Mr . O ’ Brian ? 
 Hello , I'm sorry for calling this late . May I speak to Peter ? 
 When is he coming back ? 
 I'll call again in thirty minutes . 
 So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ? 
 Have you ever written up a business plan before ? 
 You couldn ’ t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc . 
 Wait , there ’ s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ’ ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea . 
 Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment ! 
 All of you have reported your achievements . I'd like to remind you that we must be aware of the threat we face . 
 Yes , we must keep a clear mind with the tough competition . 
 Hey Steve . When's the next time you're going to play golf ? 
 Do you already have a foursome ? 
 That sounds good . Where do you want to play ? 
 How about Bellevue ? It's pretty close . 
 Twilight rates are 21 dollars . 
 Aright . I'll get a tee time for Wednesday at about 4 
 Ok . I'll call you later when I get a tee time . 
 Aright . Have fun on Saturday . 
 I'm really sorry , but I seem to have misplaced your towel . 
 I'm very sorry . Can I get you another one ? 
 How do I use the powder ? 
 How do I use the eye-drop and ointment ? 
 Well , I see . Thanks . 
 Are you going to eat anything with your sandwich ? 
 Oh really , what kind of fruit do you like ? 
 What kind of apples do you prefer ? 
 I don't really like green apples that much . 
 I think they are too sour . 
 Don't you like red apples ? 
 can you squeeze me in sometime today ? 
 I know what you ’ re saying , but I have to go over the books with you before I go see our tax guy . 
 I believe that you called me ? 
 Why did you call me ? 
 Did he do something wrong ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 That's really not like him . 
 I apologize , and I'll make sure he doesn't do that again . 
 Let's take a coffee break , shall we ? 
 What keeps you so busy ? You've been sitting there for hours . You've got to walk around.You just can't stay on the computer forever . 
 I understand that , but you'd feel better if you took a break , even for just a short while . 
 We offer many different sea water treatments . 
 The aquamedic pool is included . You can choose three . 
 OK . Here are your robes . You can go shower first . 
 oh , yes . I want to check whether you still have any vacancies . I need three single rooms for next Monday . 
 yes , please . Do you take credit cards ? 
 and how about Internet access ? 
 is it available in the rooms ? 
 that's OK . Is breakfast included ? 
 fantastic . Thank you very much . 
 Hello , sir . Have you reserved already ? 
 Yes , how long will you intend to stay ? 
 Yes , we give 5 % discount for a week and 12 % for 2 weeks . 
 Emily , are you getting rushed by a sorority ? 
 Wow . I'm getting rushed too , but just one . Are you thinking of joining any of them ? 
 The guys I've talked to say that the activities that go on in a frat house can be a little distracting depending on the group . 
 Were your parents involved in that kind of thing at all when they went to school ? 
 Jenny , are you having fun here ? 
 I ’ m glad you ’ re enjoying it . 
 It ’ s my pleasure . Would you like another glass of champagne ? 
 How much do you expect to earn ? 
 If you are hired , you are in charge of the design of toys that can meet the needs of the American market . 
 Ok . 
 How can we relate tiger to this spot , Miss Zhang ? 
 How ignorant I am ! 
 I know that tea . It smells fragrant . 
 Janice , David , come here . We take some photos here . I can't imagine how beautiful it is ! 
 Very well . We started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done . 
 At ten o'clock on the morning of next Sunday . We have invited all our relatives to the wedding . 
 Yes , its design is very elaborate and the designer took many weeks to make it . 
 Thank you ! 
 The Palace Hotel . 
 It will be expensive , but we think it will be worth . 
 Good afternoon , madam . Can I help you ? 
 Do you have reservations with us ? 
 Sorry , madam . We don't have vacancies at the moment . 
 Not bad . How about you , John ? 
 Can I borrow your suit ? 
 Have we met ? 
 Hello , Michael . My name's Shirley . Pleased to meet you . 
 I work in marketing . I'm a regional marketing manager for an IT company . Normally , I work out of Beijing , but I'm here on business . My friend Judy over there , she lives here and she invited me to this party . And you ? How about you ? 
 Boy ! What a beauty ! I fall in love with her at the first sight . 
 Of course.No girl is more charming . 
 You look pale , Paul . What's wrong ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . Anything I can do for you ? 
 Hi , is that Mr . Wu ? 
 I am calling to query about some of your information . 
 I said I want to ask about some of your information . 
 Lisa , I need some help here . 
 Well , I need to get some female stuff . 
 Yeah . I didn't know what they're called in English . 
 I'll keep that in mind . 
 Is she really ? I can ’ t believe it ! 
 Good gracious . That ’ s incredible ! 
 You ’ re kidding . 
 Really ? I ’ m surprised . 
 Why don't you try Chinese herbal medicine ? 
 You have to try at least . 
 That's nothing . 
 Yes . I'd like to look at lipstick and eye shadow . 
 Well , brown . 
 But they're purple . I prefer a brown set . 
 Well , I'm not so sure . Most of my make-up is brown . 
 Can I try it ? 
 No . 
 Not bad . Actually , it makes me look younger . I like it . 
 You're right . I'll take them all . 
 Not yet . To tell you the truth , I don't know how to write it . I've considered it for several days . 
 Don't laugh at me , please . I'm serious . I've never been required to write this kind of report before , I only do the research reports . 
 So what items must be involved in this report ? 
 Yeah , is that all ? 
 That's too complicated . 
 Oh , my God , is there any fixed for mat for it-the one that I just need to fix my information in ? 
 But I don't know how to work the Microsoft Words . Could you please give me a hand ? 
 Can I still get tickets for tonight's performance ? 
 Aren't there any other seats ? 
 Why are you shivering ? 
 Excuse me . I am looking for a book called Little Women , but I can't find it anywhere . 
 Will you have it later ? 
 That's terrific.Thank you . 
 Mm , I just need something about business news.Can you recommend some ? 
 Thank you . I'll have one . 
 Certainly . What kind of novel did you have in mind ? 
 Well , let me see ... This Stephen King novel is a real thriller . 
 That's okay . Well , let me think . How about a mystery novel ? 
 There are a number of science fiction and fantasy novels I can recommend . 
 How about a good historical novel ? This one set in medieval France is excellent . The story is exciting and the characterization is very well done . 
 Don't mention it . 
 Basketball , I'm a basketball fan . 
 It was the pilot putting the wheels down.We must be coming into land.Are you frightened ? 
 Good morning . May I help you ? 
 One moment , please , sir . ... Here's your bill . Would you like to check and see if the amount is correct ? 
 That's for the phone calls you made from your room . 
 Certainly . May I have your passport , please ? 
 Could you sign each cheque here for me ? 
 Here are your receipt and your change , sir . Thank you . 
 Do you have any fresh baked donuts for sale yet ? 
 Yes , I'd like five croissants , too . 
 Hi there ! I am looking for a new car . I have this old Ford Pinto that I would like to trade in . 
 Perfect ! I like this one . 
 Sounds like a good car ! How many miles to the gallon ? 
 That is really convenient . Especially now that fuel prices are so high ! What ’ s under the hood ? 
 Now for the most difficult question . What is the price tag for this lovely vehicle ? 
 Great ! Let ’ s do it ! 
 Oh , it's really a drag . 
 Hell with it ! Nobody will give it an Academy award ! 
 Please give me this extra value meal , a red bean pie , and one order of vegetable salad . 
 A cup of hot orange juice . 
 Yes , that's all . 
 $ 120.The small gift box is complementary . 
 Thank you ! Have a nice day ! 
 How do you like Korea ? 
 What part of the visit excited you most ? 
 Why ? 
 Yes , I think so . But there is also something terrible . 
 Sometimes the traffic is too busy . 
 Bon voyage ! 
 I'd like to order dinner . 
 I'd like to order a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare . 
 I'd prefer the filet , but the porterhouse will do . 
 Normally , I would take you up on that suggestion , but just the champagne will do for tonight . 
 That's fine . 
 Come in . It's nice to see you again . 
 Would you care for a drink ? 
 I would like to buy some beef . 
 I need to get ground beef . 
 I need about four pounds . 
 Extra lean . 
 I appreciate that . 
 Thanks for your help . 
 How many members are there in your forum ? 
 I think we can visit West Lake . The landscapes are attractive . It is said that just as there is paradise in heaven , there are Su Thou and Hang Thou on earth . 
 What can we do next after locating the place ? 
 Evan , are you busy right now ? 
 Well , I need a hand with the fax machine . My fax is not going through . 
 Ah , thanks . 
 What did you need to talk about ? 
 Like what ? 
 Your lease will be up in three years . 
 If you move out before then , you will not get your deductible . 
 Because our contract says that you will live here for three years . 
 I ’ m glad you understand . 
 Yes , thanks . Did you ? 
 I went to Tamshui . You ? 
 Mum , this is for you . 
 Happy Mother's Day to you , Mum ! 
 Excuse me . We're leaving today . I'd like to pay our bills now . 
 I see . 
 Yes , my friend and I just had breakfast at the dining room , but we didn't use any services . 
 Please add to my account . 
 OK . Here you are . 
 I'd love to . Do you often come here to dance ? 
 You are waltzing quite wonderfully . It's great to dance with a experience and talent partner . 
 Ok , that would be great . Do you like modern dance ? I don't care for it . 
 Is this a duty-free shop ? 
 I want to buy some specialties . Can you recommend me some ? 
 Fine . They look nice . I will take both of them . 
 Boris , look at this sentence . " Healthy eating is not about strict nutrition philosophies , staying unrealistically thin , or depriving yourself of foods you love . " It's interesting , isn't it ? 
 I believe they are careful calculations on proteins , vitamins and calories . 
 Healthy eating is not about depriving oneself of the foods one loves . So we are free to have whatever foods we love . It is unbelievable . 
 Seriously ? 
 Maybe nowadays people hold different opinions on healthy diet . 
 But one must have some basic ideas about nutrition and find the best way for it to work out for the body . 
 Sure , sir . Have you brought the cloth ? 
 Well , I recommend you to choose the 100 % cotton . 
 Do you have a good English-Chinese dictionary ? 
 Is this the latest edition ? 
 What's the difference ? 
 Oh ! I see . I'll have the paperback , please , 
 Oh , it's too far to walk there.We can take a bus . 
 Yeah , it's a block away down the street . 
 Excuse me , ma'ma . Could you walk back through the doorway again , please ? 
 Airport security.Could you empty your pockets over here , please ? 
 Ah , a set of keys . 
 That's all right.Enjoy your flight . 
 Sunshine Hotel . 
 With or without private bathroom ? 
 Sorry , we haven't got any . But we have a room without private bath room . 
 160 yuan . 
 Of course yes . 
 Are you OK ? I didn't mean to put you in danger . 
 That takes talent ... 
 He said you obviously prefer Greek comedies to Greek tragedies . 
 Yes , I'm here . What details do you need from me ? 
 Yes , I did . But nobody has handed it in as yet . 
 Please , go right ahead . 
 I'm Mike Kowalski and my card number is 5211678 44 , but there are some other numbers at the beginning . I'm not sure what they are . 
 It's 671029 , my birthday . Silly to choose such a simple one , I suppose ! 
 Come in and have some coffee , Anna . The kids have just gone out to the mall to hang out with their friends . 
 They spend hours there , especially on weekends . 
 I know several . But wouldn ’ t it be easier to take the shirt back and exchange it for the right size ? 
 No , it ’ s easy . We ’ ll just take the shirt back to the men ’ s department and show them the sales slip . They ’ ll exchange it for the correct size or give you a refund . 
 Sure . I love going to the mall . 
 Excuse me , my skin is always dry , can you give me some advice ? 
 Will that work ? 
 Would you show me this brooch ? 
 What is this made of ? 
 Yes , I will . But how much is it ? 
 It's expensive for me . 
 It is genuine , isn't it ? 
 Hello sir , welcome to Pistolera restaurant . May I take your order ? 
 I ' m sorry sir , but we ran out of chicken . May I suggest our delicious beef burritos or cheese quesadillas ? Both include a side of guacamole and jalapenos . 
 Of course sir . Our nachos come with melted cheese and chili . 
 Would you like anything to drink ? 
 Johnny , I want to thank you . 
 Oh , Johnny , that stuff was dollar store junk . No , I want to thank you for keeping Grandma busy . 
 I know , and normally she's trying to tell me how to clean my house . So , thank you . 
 Not only that , but I'm going to buy you that video game after all ! 
 Well , I am always energetic and enthusiastic . That's my strongest personality . 
 Em , as I have said , I'm diligent and industrious . On the other hand , sometimes I'm too hard-working and I put myself under too much pressure to make things perfect . 
 To work in a team , in my opinion , two characteristics are necessary for a person . That is , the person must be cooperative and aggressive . 
 I like playing games and having sports . They are my favourite hobbies . 
 Oh , it's hard to narrow it down to just one . I mean , I like all kinds of sports , basketball , swimming , bike riding and so on . Maybe it is just the reason why I am so energetic and vigorous . 
 Hi . This is Taylor Wright calling . I ’ Ve got an appointment with Doctor Bell at 9.00 tomorrow morning . I ’ Ve got to cancel this appointment . My father-in-law passed away suddenly last night . 
 Thanks a lot . Good bye . 
 How is the new product ? 
 Yes , I think so . And how about the price ? 
 Yes , I agree with you . We should add our opinions to the research report . 
 Good afternoon , can I help you ? 
 How many and what kind ? 
 Anything else ? 
 $ 16 . 50 . 
 You are welcome . 
 OK . When should we be there ? 
 All right , if there's no hold-ups . 
 Yeah , I just got them . I started playing ice hockey in a community league . So , I finally got myself new skates . 
 I ’ m a defender . It ’ s a lot of fun . You don ’ t have to be able to skate as fast on defense . 
 Oh , yeah ? Which team ? 
 Really ? I think we play you guys next week . Well , I have to go to practice . See you later . 
 You have your ducks in a row . 
 Bob , What are you thinking about ? 
 Do you think it'll work ? 
 It's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed ... The trade deficit is getting larger , consumption's down , I really think we're headed for a recession . 
 Increasing exports would weaken the currency . I think the main point is economic growth . We need more jobs . Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . If more people are working , it will give the economy a boost . 
 What does your father do ? 
 What about your mother ? 
 Gucci , you look serious . I wish you ’ d let your hair down . 
 Linda ? Is that you ? I haven't seen you in ages ! 
 What have you been up to ? 
 Good for you ! What are you doing ? 
 I knew some day I would be able to profit from your love of fun ! 
 Hello , the nurse said that you might have my test results in from the other day . 
 Does this mean that you have bad news for me ? 
 Can ’ t you just tell me now ? 
 I want to see you right away . 
 I know for sure that something is wrong ! 
 My parents are always saying I am not good enough . 
 They say my hair is too long , my room is too dirty and I am not good enough at school . 
 I don ’ t think they are right . I have tried my best and that's enough . It is unfair that they are always saying these thing . Sometimes I even feel deeply hurt . 
 It ’ s my pleasure . I enjoyed working with you . 
 Then keep up the good work . 
 So does my father . I'm already used to it . 
 How dare you say that ? What they do is just for our good . 
 Do you keep any pets , such as cats , dogs ? 
 Oh , but why ? 
 Hey , guys ! Did you see that sign ? 
 There's a garage sale around the corner . 
 What ? Cars ? Are you serious ? 
 The bonus season is coming . How much of a bonus can I expect ? 
 I hope so . I think you will get a big bonus too . Bonus depends on your performance and you worked overtime almost every day . 
 Hope so ! 
 Sorry , I'm supposed to be with my son . 
 Thanks . I appreciate it . 
 Merry Christmas ! Mr Bean . 
 Well , I would be glad to , but I have promised Tom to see his Christmas tree , and play the piano for his song tonight . 
 I have never tried it . 
 Sorry , I don't think I can . 
 Friday is great . 
 I've got some great news for you ! 
 yes , I'll be promoted to department manager . 
 thank you . Actually , I could not believe it at first . You know , there're so many outstanding people in our company . Many of them are qualified to fill that position . 
 thank you very much . 
 I appreciate it very much . You've been doing great . I expect to see you be promoted pretty soon . 
 next week . 
 absolutely . 
 That's $ 50 for a single night . 
 Yes , of course . Can I make a reservation for you ? 
 Daddy , I am so glad you come out with us . 
 It doesn't matter . But I really haven't gone for a picnic for a long time . 
 It was boring . Just did my homework and practiced the piano . 
 Ahh , I was not available last Sunday . I was too busy almost as much as you . 
 Hooray ! I can play football with daddy . Mom and sister can play badminton . 
 That's great . We can also take the dragon kite with us . After the picnic , we can fly it . 
 Did you listen to the weather forecast ? 
 There ’ s a typhoon coming . 
 Yep , it should be here by tomorrow night . 
 What ? What happened ? 
 Please , give me one more chance . I'll never let it happen again . I'm very sorry . 
 Um , me ? 
 Are you still working day and night ? 
 Liz , do you have a minute ? 
 I need you to help me set up for my presentation Thursday morning . 
 Well , it isn't at this office . It's over at the Dayton Street office.Have you been there before ? 
 Good . So you will have no trouble finding it . 
 I will talk about developing sales through our website.All the branch heads will be there , and most of the staff . 
 Well , I need the display monitor.But Tom can set that up for me on Wednesday . I will need you to help with everything else . 
 Good morning , room reservations . Can I help you ? 
 A single room from June 18th to 20th . Is that correct ? 
 OK . Do you need a limousine service ? 
 A hundred and eighty yuan for one way . We have a counter at the airport where our representative will lead you to the car . 
 Thank you , sir . We look forward to serving you . 
 How about two inches ? 
 I think that will over-process your hair , you should wait at least two weeks . 
 Great . My assistant will wash your hair , and then I'll be back to help you . 
 Where should I park ? 
 I drive a scooter 
 No , I haven't seen those spots . 
 I park in the daytime . 
 No , I have not seen the signs . 
 No , I don't know what the curb colors mean . 
 How long have you been in China ? 
 How do you think of living here ? 
 How did you meet your boyfriend , Cindy ? 
 Who made the first move ? 
 Wow ! 
 What do your parents think of your dating a boy ? 
 They're glad ? ! 
 I ’ d like a coffee please . 
 What have you got ? 
 Goodness me ! What a choice ! I think I ’ ll have a cappuccino please . 
 Have you heard we'll have a pay rise ? 
 It's a pity , but why ? 
 Let me see your passport . Is London your final destination ? 
 How long are you going to stay here ? 
 Do you have any dutiable items ? 
 What are these ? 
 I saw an interesting program on TV last night . It was about elderly people . 
 It said that people with a positive attitude 7 tend to live longer and happier . 
 And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress . 
 Would it be all right if I went home next weekend ? 
 Well , I want to surprise my brother showing up for his birthday . 
 How was your self-help trip ? 
 Didn't you feel any jet lag from the change in time zones ? 
 I've never been to Disneyland . I went to Universal Studios when I was fifteen . My parents took my brother Franco and I to Los Angeles and San Francisco.Wish you and Janet love each other more . 
 I get along pretty well with most of them.It seems there are always a few rotten apples in the bunch , though , Like Margaret . I don't know why management hasn't fired her yet.She ' s a terrible gossip . 
 It's not only that she gossips , but she also tries to start problems among other employees by spreading rumors and telling lies about her co-workers.She ' s not trustworthy , and in my opinion , I think she's nuts . 
 I think one of the important things is just to be considerate of your co-workers'feelings and needs.If you are aware of other people and do your part to make a good working environment , you should be able to get along with most of the people you work with . 
 Do you have any sales experience ? 
 What kind of work are you doing now ? 
 Where are you working ? 
 Mm ... How do I get this ticket machine to work ? 
 Ok , I ’ Ve done that . 
 Oh it ’ s printed the ticket already . Thank you very much . 
 John , I'm sorry , the air tickets for the International Day are sold out . 
 It's possible because everyone wants to travel during the holiday weekend . 
 Take it easy . I'll like you know if anyone decides to cancel his reservation . 
 Fine with me . I just want to get this over with . It ’ s important we make a clean break . I should have signed a pre-nup . 
 Nothing ! Anyway , you ’ re right , there ’ s no reason this has to be nasty.My lawyer tells me you ’ Ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property , as well as the custody agreement - I keep the cat and you get the dog . So that ’ s done ... finally . 
 Fine , but I ’ m keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me . 
 He ’ s my grandfather , and he never really liked you anyway ! 
 How typical , when are you ever going to use a silver tea set ? Fine ! I don ’ t want to drag this out any longer than necessary . What ’ s next ? What about these old photographs ? 
 Our trip to Italy ! I remember that day . We were going to visit the Trev fountain , and we got caught in the rain ... 
 Oh , we really did have fun back then , didn ’ t we ? 
 Oh Jeff ! I love you too ! I ’ m so glad we didn ’ t have to decide who keeps the motorcycle . 
 Hey , buddy , can ’ t you see there ’ s a line ? 
 What ? You haven ’ t taken the bus before ? 
 Well , you have to wait in line like everyone else . Besides , you should let old people on first . 
 It ’ s all right . Where are you going ? 
 Oh , well you don ’ t want this bus , anyway . It goes to Georgetown . 
 It ’ s all right , though . Just get off at the next stop and catch the 79A . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Sorry , I'm engaged for the foxtrot.Will the next Walls be all right ? 
 Are you ready to go shopping ? 
 Good idea . Have you written down potatoes , carrots , and onions ? 
 Let ’ s get both . We need some coffee too . Is that on your list ? 
 I think you ’ Ve got everything . I want to got some chocolate and some cheese . 
 I ’ m not sure . I ’ ll decide at the cheese counter , when I can see what they have . Have we got enough money ? 
 I ’ Ve got them there . Shall I drive ? 
 Hello , Miao Ping . Yes , it has . I've been in Saudi Arabia for the last 6 weeks on business . I did have a little time to relax in Dubai , though . 
 I need to effect a payment under my L / C . Not the old one , the new one my Assistant came in and dealt with last week . 
 It's DG193445782100 . Can you find it ? 
 How may I help you today ? 
 What kind of account would you like to open ? 
 Do you have another account with us ? 
 Would you like to transfer money from that account into your new one ? 
 How much would you like to transfer ? 
 Give me a moment while I complete your transaction . 
 Julia , I saw two men fighting beside our door this morning . 
 Brothers ? Do you know why they quarreled ? 
 Is there anybody acting as mediator in the dispute ? 
 I'd like to order broadband internet for my laptop . 
 Well , I don't have an Ethernet port . My computer runs entirely on wireless service . 
 Yes , please ! Tell me about the alternatives . 
 Very good . How much does that cost ? 
 I see . And the other alternatives ? 
 Great ! What if I need to print something in the lobby ? 
 Ms . Montgomery ? Do you have a moment ? 
 I ’ m a bit upset about this year ’ s bonus . I was really expecting a little more . Are there any problems with my work ? 
 Welcome , sir , what can I do for you ? 
 Whose record do you want ? 
 His records have been sold out . The new copies will be available next week . 
 It's my first time to come to Bangkok . Could you recommend some places for me ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 Sounds persuasive . How much will you charge for it ? 
 That's reasonable . Will you take care of meals for the day ? 
 I see . May I know the schedule ? 
 I really like what you have . But the price for this product is much higher than we expected . I am absolutely not a buyer at that price . 
 I understand that . If you can lower the price by 10 percent , we have a deal right now . 
 Err , well , I can ’ t decide right now . Do you mind if I have a small internal discussion on this first ? I will tell you our decision this afternoon . 
 Here ’ s your hot dog and beer . What happened ? Did I miss anything ? 
 What ’ s the score ? 
 So Baltimore is winning ? 
 This is a really great place to watch a baseball game . 
 The fans are great here , too . Not like in Philadelphia . 
 Yeah , it reminds you why they say baseball is America ’ s favorite pastime . 
 Yes , speaking . How can I help you ? 
 The requirements are strong communicational skills , management and work assiduously . And you have to handle the recurring crisis good-humoredly and discreetly . 
 Operations is made up of Manufacturing , Materials , Shipping and Distribution etc . 
 Yes , it is . 
 I am sorry , miss , it's not allowed unless you want to buy it . 
 OK , here you are . The fitting room is behind the curtain . 
 Yes , I did . But when I got home , my son put it on and we found the hole . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Yes , good morning . This is Mr . Suzuki from Video TV . May I speak to Mr . Johnson ?

 What about people who don ’ t have a computer ? 
 What else is there at the EDD offices that can help me with my job search ? 
 What are the different workshops that are available at the EDD offices ? 
 Can you think of some other places where I may look for work ? 
 Hello , this is Francis from XYZ Company . I would like to discuss with you about a new project some time next week . Do you have time to meet ? 
 Ok . 
 It is ok with me . So I will be arriving at your office around two fifteen PM . 
 Good morning . What can I do for you ? 
 I must weigh it . Do you want to send it by ordinary or registered mail ? 
 In that case , you'd better have it registered . 
 Seven dollars and fifty cents in all . 
 OK . Here are your receipt and your change . 
 Bye . 
 Yes ? 
 What position ? 
 How much does it pay ? 
 I'm sorry but my bottom figure is $ 36,000 . 
 Sure . The coach leaves at 6:30 a . m . , in front of our office . The drive takes eight hours , with two stops to see some sights . 
 You'll be staying at Holiday Inn . It's a three-star hotel with two restaurants and a swimming pool . 
 The second day you take a four-hour city tour . In the afternoon you go on the famous boat cruise under the falls . 
 Thank you.Thanks to the baker , I benefit a lot from him . 
 To study . I am going to the University of Tampa to do a postgraduate course for three years . 
 Yes , here it is . 
 I've got a letter from my bank here . It shows I am able to support myself during these three years of studies . 
 Yes , here it is . 
 Oh , but mine is a three-year program . 
 Okay , thank you . 
 Of course , Debbie . Let me look at my schedule , - - I have some free time on the 12th . That ’ s this Thursday at 9:00 a . m . 
 Certainly . I ’ Ve already worked out a general budget for all the departments . 
 It depends on the weather . 
 That'll be great .

 Hey , how could you like to taste my fist ? 
 Um , let me see , romance , comedy . documentary , action , science fiction , animated and so on . 
 yeah . It seems like we don't speak the same language as far as movies are concerned . 
 the Notebook is this type of movie . 
 well then , this could be a nice opportunity to enjoy it together . I bet you'd love it . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 We have many pairs for couples . Look at this counter . 
 You have a very good taste , this pair is the latest product .

 2,200 $ . 
 Mary , come here . I've found the book our teacher recommended us to buy last week . 
 You know , it is the best seller for this year . It has had its fifth impression since its publication early this year . 
 Wait a minute . I found there were two printings . The paperback books must be much cheaper . 
 Mom , I've got something to tell you . 
 Aunt Jane buys a new bike for Tom . He is putting on grand airs . 
 It is great . But Tom's bike is so much better than mine . 
 Nothing of that sort ! 
 Mom , it's OK . I will buy a big car one day . It is faster than the bus . 
 Let me see.Yes . I will buy a plane for you . There is no traffic up there . 
 Listening carefully can show you understand and respect the speaker . 
 Besides , you can pick up some helpful information from the talk . 
 To show that you have understood what is said , you can nod or ask simple questions at the right time . 
 Never should you interrupt on a unfamiliar topic . 
 Additionally , don't show any impatience to a repeated topic . 
 In a word , any impolite behavior should be avoided in the listening . 
 I have no idea . 
 It isn't a good time because there must be many tourists in the scenic spots . What about your plans ? 
 It seldom rains this summer . 
 Because of pollution and other things , our environment has become worse and worse . 
 It is serious . 
 I'll take two value meals . 
 One Coca Cola and the other a Sprite , please . 
 Yes , I'd like that , then . 
 No , thanks . That will be it . 
 Yes , it's straight ahead around the corner . 
 When will you be able to come here ? 
 Okay , I'll have everything prepared for you when you get here . 
 May I take your order ? 
 All right . And would you like a salad ? 
 OK . What kind of dressing would you like ? We have vinaigrette , Italian , and French . 
 And would you like anything to drink ? 
 Have you seen this ? 
 They killed another hostage . 
 I agree completely . I just don't understand what's wrong with them . Don't they have any humanity ? 
 Yes , but that doesn't make them right , does it ? Just because they think so ? 
 Come on , you can't be serious ! We should never give in to terrorist's demands , otherwise where would we be ? 
 Really ? What happened ? 
 Oh , sure . 
 Okay . Come with me . 
 Sorry , you can only pay cash . 
 Here's your change . 
 Of course , I'll get right on it . 
 Well , in the feudal society , emperors had supreme power , so his residence was certainly a forbidden palace . 
 Yes . The Forbidden City is divided into two parts . The southern section , or the Outer Court was for the emperor to exercise his power over the nation , and the northern part , or the Inner Court was for his royal family . 
 Even the whole country belonged to him . That's why he is called the emperor . 
 Yeah , the buildings and designs of the Forbidden City are the peak of Chinese traditional architecture , not only scientific but also suitable for living . 
 Some of them are mascots and some are symbols of power . 
 Oh , no . In fact , yellow is the symbol of the royal family . 
 Exactly . Here is the Nine-dragon Screen . 
 Sure , this will be a really good picture . 
 I have an idea . 
 You just turn a deaf ear when she talks . 
 Not bad at all , thanks . There were one or two interesting people there.Why couldn't you come ? 
 What a shame . Why didn't you take a sleeping pill ? 
 How many did you use to take ? 
 Good heavens . Why did you take so many ? 
 I'm sure you did . 
 He was quite right . 
 Are you free this evening , Li ? 
 What a pity . I wanted to go for a drink with you . 
 No , I haven ’ t got any plans . 
 Why not ? Sounds good to me . 
 I was the only one who got a strait A in my class . 
 Thank you . 
 Hi , Wendy . I ’ m Gerry . 
 Is Marisa in ? 
 All right . I ’ ll call her later . 
 Bye . 
 You will visit the Hyde Park , Poet's Corner , Tower of London , Fleet Street and Tower Bridge . 
 I think you will enjoy your journey . 
 Yes , I am checking out . 
 Room 1419 . Here is my key . 
 It's all right . Pls charge it to my credit card . 
 I will . Where can I leave my luggage ? I really want to leave after lunch . 
 Thanks very much and goodbye ! 
 I can't sleep . I'm really not all that tired . 
 It's impossible for me to get to sleep right now . 
 That really does not work for me . 
 How about I tire myself out , and then fall asleep when I'm tired ? 
 Don't worry , I'll make sure and get to sleep in a little while . 
 Fine . Sleep well yourself . 
 Yes . Quite good . Perhaps you're very interested in the social benefits . 
 Really ? We would like to start you off at 2,000 yuan a month , excluding bonus and overtime pay . 
 Well , we'll supply you with an apartment of a bedroom and a living room . 
 Yes , in our company , the women have a two-week vacation a year , besides this , if you are a married woman , maternity leave for some months is permitted . 
 Yes , you have a paid month holiday every year . 
 Well , we are only responsible for the retirement pension . About the unemployment compensation , this will be given by the government . 
 Good day , what can I do for you ? 
 Of course . Where are you planning to travel to ? 
 That's fine . If you are travelling outside of Mainland China , Hong Kong and Macao we need to follow the SAFE rules . This means that you can exchange 2,000 USD or equivalent . 
 Do you have the day off today ? How come you're not at work now ? 
 Are you serious ? Why would they have to go to such extreme measures like a strike ? Doesn't your company have a pretty good corporate image ? I'll bet the folks at headquarters are going nuts over something as serious as a strike ... 
 Mon and I got in another fight , Boris . 
 it was over food . I simply wanted some fried chicken but she said no . 
 oh , she keeps saying that . She never allows me to have them . 
 But , Boris , i am not a baby any more . 
 how about your mother ? 
 poor you . It seems we are in the same boat . 
 really ? so you don't have fried food at all . 
 how do you manage it ? 
 Have you found a new job yet ? 
 What kind of work ? 
 What do you do there ? 
 How long is the assignment ? 
 Hello , my name's David Wong . I've ordered a sofa from you last Wednesday . I wonder when it will be delivered today . 
 It's 45132 . 
 Houston restaurant . Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 We open at 6:00 and take last orders at 10 :: 30 . 
 Yes , sir . We are looking forward to your coming . 
 It's inevitable . Their love wasbuilt on the sand , and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks . 
 That give us a good lesson . 
 All my joints seem to hurt and I have a terrible headache . 
 No , not yet , but I do feel a little feverish . 
 Only since this morning . 
 Maybe you are right . 
 You came to the right place . Any particular decade ? 
 We just got one in yesterday , so now we have six . 
 Yes , we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures . 
 That one truly is a beautiful piece of work , isn't it ? 
 Oh , no . Everything we sell here is ‘ as is . ' 
 If it breaks down , maybe you can find a repairman on the Internet . 
 I usee I would say that would be moving out of my parents ’ house for the first time . 
 Till I moved out of my parents ’ home , I became a lot more independent . 
 That would definitely be getting a divorce . 
 We just weren't right for each other . 
 The marriage only lasted about a year . 
 Yes , I got married to a man that I met shortly after I divorced my first husband . 
 Oh I hope not , my first marriage was a mistake , but this one isn ’ t . 
 About 15 years now . 
 I think so , hopefully we ’ ll have a long and a happy life together . 
 Hi , I'm out of here . Here's my key . 
 Thank you . 
 I only had nine little problems here . Other than that , I enjoyed my stay , and I loved the city . 
 do you like animals ? 
 what's your favorite animal ? 
 have you ever had a dog ? 
 they always say that dogs are a man's best friends . do you think that's true ? 
 how about cats ? Have you ever had one for a pet ? 
 how did that happen ? 
 you must have been devastated ! 
 I hope she does . Do you think you'll ever get another pet ? 
 i hope your cat finds its way back home . 
 Good afternoon . This is Michelle Li speaking , calling on behalf of IBA . Is Mr Meng available at all ? 
 Oh , hello ! Sorry about that . I'm just calling to say that we've received your new Corporate Credit Card from HQ . 
 Yes , our application procedures have speeded up since we started using the new fast-track system . 
 Or we can send it to you . But if you would like to use it at the ATM , you'll need to wait for your PIN number . 
 As long as you bring your ID , etc , we can serve you over the counter . But you won't be able to use the ATM until your new PIN number arrives . 
 Hello . I would like to make a reservation at 8: 00 . 
 4 . By the way , what's your dress code ? 
 I see . Thank you . 
 I've been told that Chinese arts and crafts are famous for their excellent workmanship . We'd like to take some home . What would you recommend ? 
 No , not really.But I think it should be something distinctively Chinese . And easy to carry . 
 So , we'd like to see some embroidery . 
 Is everything OK ? 
 So , since when is your house a bank ? 
 I mean , what ’ s up with the locks and iron bars on your windows . 
 What ’ s the matter with you ? Why are you acting all paranoid ? 
 OK , well , what did you want to see me about ? 
 I want to join in the bus tour . 
 Will the bus pick up the tourists from hotels ? 
 Woo , that's quite convenient . 
 Before we discuss the price , may I ask you what kind of exhibits you are interested in ? 
 Can you give us a rough idea of the quantity you require ? It is generally known that the price varies according to the quantity . 
 In that case , our offer for the white-collar series is US $ 200 , and the other is US $ 300 per set . 
 We usually quote on a CIF basis and a commission of five percent for you . You will find our price is most competitive . 
 Letter of credit at sight . 
 Within a month after your letter of credit reaches us . 
 OK ! I expect you to accept our general terms and conditions of trade . We believe that through our cooperation , large transactions will be brought to speedy conclusion . 
 OK . When ? 
 10 in the morning ? 
 Sorry , that's too late . I usually go to bed around 10:00 PM . 
 No , that's too early . I'll still be at work then . 
 That's fine . 
 Alright . Bye . 
 Would you like to go by train or by bus ? 
 The bus is cheaper but also slower . It will take about two-and-a-half hours . 
 If you take the fast train , it will take about 50 minutes . 
 The trains for Cambridge leave from King's Cross Station . They run approximately every half hour . Most trains to Cambridge go from Platform 9 . 
 The best way is to take an underground tube train directly to King's Cross . The Underground station is just round the corner from here . 
 It is very easy . Just turn right when you leave and then turn right again at the first crossroads . The entrance to the Underground station is about 50 meters further on . 
 You're welcome . 
 It is really gorgeous out today . I remembered the weatherman said it is supposed to rain . 
 Really ? That's unusual for October , isn't it ? 
 Yes , that's true . Still , it's hard to believe . Yesterday our high was only 50 degrees Fahrenheit . 
 I sure did ! 
 I voted for Obama . 
 I knew he would win . 
 He was the best candidate this year . 
 I guess America is finally maturing . 
 Is Mr . Thomas there , please ? 
 I said , is Mr . Thomas there ? 
 Are you tired ? 
 Why aren't you doing your homework ? 
 Oh , is it ? You'll be making records next , will you ? 
 You'd better get on with your homework ! You can practice on Sunday . 
 I certainly could . You'll get exams next month . 
 Oh , don't you ? God save me ! 
 Steve , you look pale . What happened ? 
 Did you have something on your mind ? You look so concerned . Maybe I can help you . 
 Is there anything I can do to help you ? 
 Mom , can you talk about the philosophy of life with me ? 
 Who's singing in your home , Jim ? 
 Who's Ellie ? 
 Oh , I see.how old is she ? 
 I suppose they're playing games . 
 Today . 
 Yes . 
 Eighteen.Some friends are having a birthday party for me tonight.Do you want to come ? 
 About 6 . 
 You look upset.What ' s wrong ? 
 Maybe you need a vacation or something , or maybe a bonus . 
 Why don't you talk to your boss about it ? If you talk to him , he will surely understand . 
 All the routine work really browns me off . 
 I wish I hadn't chosen this job . 
 I've a driver mate in my car ! 
 Yes , it's so helpful . 
 All right , roast beef , please.And I'd like to start with soup . 
 Clear soup , please . 
 What kind of bus pass would you like to buy ? 
 You can get a day , weekly , monthly , or student pass . 
 Sure , can I see your student ID ? 
 Very good . 
 It's free , but the monthly sticker is $ 24 . 
 Thank you for your purchase . 
 Is there a bus tour ? 
 I'd prefer the night tour . 
 Now please tell me something about your achievements in your work unit . 
 Have you received any other honors ? 
 Do you have anything published ? 
 So what did you think about the movie ? 
 Really ? I don't agree . This Star Wars episode was incredible ! 
 Well , one of the most spectacular things about this one was the special effects . State of the art special effects are the main reason for the success of previous episodes , so audiences have high expectations for this one , and I don't think they will be disappointed . 
 It's kind of cool that they are still using the same Star Wars theme song for this movie . 
 I know exactly what you mean . Hearing that song gives me a nostalgic feeling . 
 Do you think that they had anything to do with the casting of the movie ? 
 Well , maybe . But I like the little kid who played Manakin Skywalker . I can't imagine anyone else playing that role . 
 I've no idea . But looking at the success of Star Wars episode , I've a strong feeling production for the next episode will be selling pretty soon . I hope It will be even better than this one . 
 Well , I think we should go now . It's getting pretty late . 
 How do I know what forms to fill out for unemployment ? 
 How do I get the form to apply for unemployment benefits ? 
 What type of information will I have to provide to the Employment Development Office ? 
 Will they need anything else from me ? 
 What should I do after I turn in the application ? 
 Are you going abroad to study ? 
 Hello . Excuse me . Do you know if there's a Commercial Bank around here ? 
 Straight on , and turn right . Is it far ? 
 Thanks very much . 
 I ran into a glass door yesterday . 
 I'm really happy that you came to visit me . 
 I've been missing you like crazy . 
 Lately , I've been quite busy . 
 I've really been working a lot lately . 
 So what have you been up to ? 
 Whatever the reason may be , I'm glad you visited me . 
 Hello ! Tomorrow I'm going to need a wake-up call . 
 I always hit the snooze button , so give me two calls , one at 7 and another at 7 fifteen . 
 Oops , cancel that . Change the second call to 7 thirty will you , please ? 
 No , that's about it for now . Thanks . 
 What games do you like ? 
 How about a game of bridge ? 
 What about guessing games ? 
 Let's play other game . 
 OK . 
 Which one do you mean ? 
 I ’ Ve lost my purse . 
 All my money . 
 Fairly warm this morning , isn't it ? 
 Say , how about a walk along the river ? 
 I have lots of friends . 
 I don't know , maybe one hundred . 
 Of course . I have lots of best friends . 
 I think about twenty-five . 
 I feel sorry for you . 
 You must be lonely . I will share my friends with you . 
 That's a very nice pair of glasses . 
 Yes , and I like the color too . It matches your eyes . 
 That's incredible ! 
 Huh ? 
 It is ? Oh , that ’ s nice . 
 Actually , I ’ d forgotten about it . 
 Because I ’ m not Christian , I ’ m Jewish . 
 It ’ s all right . There are so many Christians in America that everybody takes it for granted that I ’ m Christian . 
 Well , I ’ ll celebrate Hanukah soon , but that ’ s not as important to us as Christmas is to you . Mainly I ’ ll just enjoy the holiday break . 
 Not at all . A party is a party . I ’ ll be happy to come . 
 I am going to buy some food to cook for supper . 
 How strange ! Our little emperor now asks to help out with shopping . 
 Wow , that's something new . Let's go ! What's this , honey ? 
 Cabbage ? Is that what they teach at school now ? OK , honey , it's spinage . 
 There we go . 
 Bingo ! It's dark outside , Let's hurry up . 
 If you want my advice , you won ’ t invite yourself any risk . 
 You must be new . 
 Have you just started college ? 
 What school ? 
 Do you like it here ? 
 Do you like it better here or at PCC ? 
 If that ’ s the case , then why did you leave ? 
 Hello , Ken . 
 Have you just been to the cinema ? 
 What ’ s on ? 
 Oh , I ’ Ve already seen it . I saw it on television last year . It ’ s an old film , but it ’ s very good . 
 Yes , I have . I was there in April . 
 It was spring , but the weather was awful . It rained all the time . 
 I'd like to book a ticket to Shanghai . 
 As soon as possible . Do you have a flight tomorrow ? 
 That will be OK . 
 Just me this time . 
 Economy class will be fine . 
 I would like to book a one way trip ticket . 
 I would like to pay by check . 
 I'll pay by charge card then . 
 Lucy Green . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 How about this opera given by the famous musician ? 
 I want to try my hand at the stocks . 
 Don ’ t worry . I know there are no pennies from heaven . I will work hard . 
 Is there someone I can talk to about a payment question ? 
 My paycheck that just arrived is less than last week ’ s check . 
 Yes , actually , I did make a little bit of money . 
 Yes , I showed that income on the Continued Claim Form . 
 Maybe I just shouldn ’ t show the income then . 
 What's taking you so long ? 
 I need you to hurry up . 
 I think there's more you need to do . 
 My hair looks awful . 
 I just don't like my hair . 
 I won't be paying you for this . 
 What type do you have in your mind ? 
 Thirty dollars a day . 
 No , you have to pay it by yourself . 
 Hi , Andy . 
 I did not sleep much last night . I really feel bad . It was a crazy night . 
 I had a bad dream . I was walking alone in the graveyard , and suddenly all the ghosts jumped out of their graves . They began to chase me through the graveyard and shouted that they wanted my blood . 
 My mother woke me up . She had heard me crying out for help . 
 I felt embarrased . After all , I am 18 years old . Mom gave me some chocolate cookies and a glass of milk . 
 Yeah , but i was afraid to fall back asleep . I am worrying about getting into the University of Michigan .

 Excuse me ? Do you have anything for a carsickness ? 
 Oh , it's for my brother . The little boy over there . He is getting a carsickness . 
 Thank you so much . 
 Sorry to interrupt , but my brother is still sleeping . 
 Yes . It's so strange that he slept all the time after taking the pills . 
 What ? 
 I see . 
 He asked me if I'd like to be a newspaper salesperson ? 
 Don't worry about that . He said I can do that at spare time . Anyway , it's just a part-time job . 
 It's a weekly newspaper named Olympic English . So I need to be here only on Sunday . 
 That's exactly what I am thinking about , And also it's a good way to get social experiences . 
 Let's do it together . 
 For what ? You have a telephone at home , don't you ? 
 How do I submit an expense report ? 
 You mean I have to attach the receipts with the expense report ? 
 Professor , do you have a few moments when I could meet with you ? 
 Three would be a good time . 
 I'm not sure . 
 OK , I'll find it . 
 See you then . 
 Good afternoon . Can I help you ? 
 I'm sorry , Sir . She's currently away at our sub-branch . Is there anything I can help you with ? 
 Let me take a look ... ID , yes , form completed , yes , well , it looks in order , Sir . 
 We do require a deposit before we can issue you with a personal credit card . 
 The minimum deposit is 1,500 RIB . But you will need to pay some small additional handling charges as well . 
 Should I ask Sara to the party ? 
 Your prices seem a little high . 
 We make a counter-offer to you of $ 150 per metric ton F . O . B . London . 
 OK . We will increase our order . 
 I'm glad that we've settled the price . 
 I want to do some management job since I have three-year's work history . 
 I would apply my specialty and experience to my job and gradually move up to the management level in this company . 
 Where would you like to go ? 
 Get in and close the door . 
 Sorry . The road is too crowded . 
 But I can't help it . 
 Sorry . We mustn't stop here . 
 Yes , would you keep our bags until 6pm . 
 Yes we checked on just now . 
 Is this all right . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Certainly , sir . What would you like done to them ? 
 All right , sir . They should be ready for you by tomorrow afternoon . 
 It's our pleasure . 
 Hi , Susan . What ’ s up ? 
 I ’ m sorry . I have no idea . I haven ’ t seen that for ages . 
 Hi , darling , I am thinking it is the time of your calling . 
 Quite good except thinking of you so much . 
 It's called love is blind , I think . 
 Hello , this is the apartment manager speaking . 
 Would you be interested in seeing the apartment ? 
 Are you free today at around 6 p . m . ? 
 Well , I'll see you at 6 p . m . Do you know how to get there ? 
 I'll give you an application form when I see you .

 Good afternoon , Mary . How's business ? 
 Read Jimmy's card to me please , Janey . 
 Eh ? 
 The what ? 
 What else does he say ? 
 What ? Speak up , Janey . I'm afraid I can't hear you . 
 Is that all ? He doesn't say very much , does he ? 
 I need some mascara . Do you have good thickening mascara ? 
 Alright . And I want to consider your eye shadow too . Do you have a color chart can look at ? 
 Oh , sure I will need to clean off my own eye shadow first . 
 Thank you . 
 Good afternoon Sir . I'll have a look at the time-table for you . I'm sorry but there aren't any direct flights available . 
 Yes there are.How do you want to go , First class or coach ? 
 It is 260 dollars . 
 The flight will get you there at six Sunday morning . 
 The flight number is 301 at Gate Two . 
 Here you are . 
 Just this one . 
 Aisle , please . 
 What ’ s the gate number ? 
 Steven , we are preparing a martial arts show for the New Year's party . Would you like to join us ? 
 That's OK . A month is enough for you to learn the basic movements . It would be great to have you with us on the show . 
 No . You know , there are many schools and styles of kung fu . What we will perform is a set of Chinese shadow boxing . 
 Thank you for joining us ! Now let's see some pictures and know more about kung fu . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 Yes , sir . 
 We'll visit the generally well-known spots . 
 Five days ' time will be OK . 
 My name is Mary , and I will be your waitress tonight . 
 Before your main course , would you like to order an appetizer ?

 You know , that is one of my favorites ! 
 You could choose another appetizer for half price to share . 
 Room service , is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Well , we have 6 for each room . 
 OK sir , please wait a minute . 
 Don't mention it . The thesis due date is coming , but my thesis isn't even close to being done . 
 Don't worry . Anyway , you are better than me . 
 Steven ! What ’ s going on ! Who were those guys ? I didn ’ t know you have a gun ! What ’ s going on ! 
 Steven , I ... 
 What ? Why didn ’ t you tell me before ? What are you doing here ? 
 What does that have to do with those men shooting at us ? Most importantly , why did you lie to me ! 
 I can ’ t believe this ! Why are all these things happening to me ! I can ’ t take it anymore ! Let me out of the car ! 
 Excuse me , sir . Is this a duty-free shop ? 
 Well , I am afraid I don't bring my passport with me today . Can you save it for us until tomorrow ? 
 I need to order new business cards . 
 I think 2,000 would be enough . 
 I don't want to make any changes to my old card . 
 ... Okay , that's it . Here's the form , and here's my old card to use as a model . 
 I need it sooner . Let me have it in three days , okay ? 
 ABC Company , my name is Lucy . How can I help you ? 
 Thank you for your interest . The position is still available . Have you already sent your CV to us ? 
 It is urgent for us to fill this position now and I would like to stress that English is a must because of the international contacts and most likely traveling abroad very soon . If all these is not problem for you , I recommend you to mention these in your cover letter and send it to me directly . 
 The consignments of chemical instruments have just reached us . We have to lodge a claim against you for inferior quality I am afraid . 
 We bought 1,000 sets of chemical instruments from you , but there are 40 not up to the standard . 
 Here is the survey report from a well-known public surveyor in London . You may inspect the defective instruments personally 
 Forty faulty instruments means that 4 % are not up to the standard . You should compensate us for 4 % of the total account on the contract , as well as for the inspection fee . 
 All right . In that case we are still willing to do business with you . 
 May I help you ? 
 Let me weight it first . That'll be 14 dollars . 
 Of course , it's 4 dollars now . 
 No , you don't . We use computers now . 
 In a month . 
 Oh ? You hoped to get that job , didn't you ? 
 I'm sorry . That's too bad . Who is it ? Who got the job , I mean ? 
 Hmm . Why do you think they gave it to him and not to you ? 
 You mean you didn't get the job because you're a woman ? 
 What sort of clothes does he wear ? 
 Perhaps that had something to do with it . 
 It's possible , isn't it ? 
 Well . . . perhaps you should think about it . 
 I'm not saying you should . I'm saying you should think about it . That's all ! 
 Hmm . Perhaps it should be the only important thing . But it isn't . Not in this company . 
 Yes , go down the fifth street . You won't miss it . 
 It's only about 10 minutes ' walk . 
 What is your long-term goal in this career ? 
 What would you do to achieve that ? 
 I am so sorry that I must be off now . My girlfriend told me I must arrive at her home in ten minutes or she will break up with me . 
 May I speak to Mr . Baker ? 
 Will you ask him to call me collect when he ’ s back ? 
 Yes , this is Cindy Wang of A & B Trading Company in New York . 
 Hello . I'd like to reconfirm my flight , please . 
 My name is Daniel Adams and my flight number is 374 . 
 On May 11th . 
 Buenos Aires . 
 Thank you . Can I pick up my ticket when I check in ? 
 What's holding us back on the plant expansion project ? We were supposed to see the specs on that ages ago.Why haven't I heard anything about it ? Did the whole project just vanish into thin air ? 
 You're joking , right ? No wonder we've been tied up with this project . I know the environmental impact statement will take forever to get approval if they've found anything endangered on the site . Are they positive there is evidence of endangered species actually living there ? 
 Have you had any experience with sales work ? 
 What exactly did you do at that company ? 
 Did you like your work ? 
 But when and why did you leave the company ? 
 I see . Why did you choose our company ? 
 Hello , I'd like to open an account . 
 I'd like to open a savings account . What's the interest rate now ? 
 Is there any minimum deposit for the first time ? 
 What about the later deposits ? 
 OK , that's good . 
 Here you are , a thousand Yuan and my ID . 
 Thanks . I will . 
 How about some Zongzi ? 
 Well , it's a pyramid-shaped dumpling made from glutinous rice wrapped in reed leaves . 
 Do you want some stuffed bun ? It's delicious , too . 
 Anything else ? 
 OK . Wait for a moment , please . I'll be back in a moment with the dishes . 
 Show me your passport , please . 
 How long are you staying in Britain ? 
 Have a pleasant stay in Britain . 
 It feels like there's going to be rain later . 
 We'll go tomorrow . 
 I ’ m pretty tired . I haven ’ t been sleeping well . 
 I have enough time . I just can ’ t seem to fall asleep and stay asleep . 
 I don ’ t have one time in particular . I just go to sleep whenever I feel tired . 
 I just lost my job , and I am unsure about being able to find another one . 
 I haven ’ t ever tried that , but it sounds like a good idea . 
 But then it'll be too warm . 
 This is the Pan-American Club.May I help you ? 
 Yes , of course.The guest speaker is Professor David of a University , and he'll be lecturing about The impact of the Oil Crisis on Latin America . 
 I would like to get my driver's license today . 
 I haven't taken it yet . 
 Can I take my test right now ? 
 I would like to do that right now , if I could . 
 That's perfect . 
 The morning would be nice . 
 Can I help you ? 
 What size , please ? 
 What color would you prefer ? 
 Well , the brown one is beautiful indeed , but I think the black one will suit you better . 
 Will there be anything else ? 
 Yes , it is . It's brilliant . 
 Yes , it is . But you have to be careful . 
 Only 350 yuan . 
 OK . Here you are . 
 Tell me what seems to be the problem . 
 Did you ever talk to him about it ? 
 I'll see what I have got . What's it for ? 
 I can let you have some silvers if that is good . 
 What do you do ? 
 What are you going to have ? 
 Can I get you anything to drink ? 
 That sounds good . I think I'll have the same . 
 We are going to Jingshan Park . Originally it was an imperial garden while it is now a public park . 
 It is at the north of Forbidden City , on the central axis of Beijing . 
 Jingshan consists of five individual peaks , and there lies an elaborate pavilion on the top of each peak . These pavilions were used for gathering and leisure time . These five peaks also draw the approximate historical axis of central Beijing . 
 According to the dictates of Eng Shut , it is favorable to site a residence to the south of a nearby hill . When the capital was moved to Beijing , no hill existed at this location , so one was constructed . It is called " Coal Hill " . The last emper-or of Ming Dynasty , Chongzhen , committed suicide by hanging himself here in 1644 . 
 Jingshan Park is especially a popular place for old people socializing and gathering . People can often find elder folks dancing , singing opera and other cultural activities at Jingshan Park . 
 Sure . Wait for a moment . Here you are . 
 Here is the menu . 
 Hi , good morning , you are so early today . 
 I see . How long does it take you to reach the office every day ? 
 Wow , that ’ s quite a long journey . Do you drive a car ? 
 You are right ! But I get up a little late . That gives me no other option but to travel by motorcycle . 
 Are you OK there ? 
 Can I help ? 
 Year ! They are unreliable sometimes . 
 Yeah . I'll miss all of you , too . But I'll keep in touch . 
 OK . 
 I don't know . Maybe it's broken . 
 I'll see if I can adjust it . 
 Why not tell the clerk and ask them to repair it . 
 Good morning , Miss . 
 Yes , I'd like to know how to use the library . You know , I'm a new student here . 
 Yes.Here ' s my identification . 
 Thank you very much . By the way , how many books am I allowed to check out ? 
 How long can I keep the books ? 
 I want a book on physics . Could you show me where I can find it ? 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 What kind of grapes do you want ? 
 Ok , wait a moment please . 
 Trust me . 
 How can you tell the difference ? From what I see , they look almost the same . 
 Yes , they are different ! But it's too professional . What I need is just being able to tell the real from the fake . Do you know any method we can use to tell a fake ancient coin ? 
 I see . By the way , China was more than once ruled by foreign tribes in history . Did they issue their own coins in China ? 
 If you happen to find one , please bargain with the owner for it . I'd like to have one . It's interesting to see the integration of the Han and Mongolian cultures on this small piece of metal . 
 My name is Dunlin and I live in Beijing . I was born in 1980 . I will graduate from Peking University this July . I have majored in accounting . 
 There are three in my family , my parents and myself . My father is a teacher and my mother is a worker . 
 Good afternoon , I want to pick up a new shaver since the old one has retired . 
 I'm still not sure . The type with top quality , I guess . Well , which one do you recommend ? 
 It doesn't matter much . If it has high quality and reasonable price , it will be OK . 
 Do you have a warranty on it ? 
 If there's something wrong with it in a week , can I come back to change it ? 
 OK . I'll take one . 
 I guess we should invite him . I just hope he doesn't start talking about Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger again . 
 Yeah , you're right . We'll never hear the end of it . 
 What are you looking for ? 
 Walk straight ahead until you come to the second traffic light . Then turn right . 
 I can't remember , but it's the second light . 
 I'm afraid I don't . But I do know the price has gone up . 
 What's your hobby ? 
 What's the make of your camera ? 
 Do you own your own darkroom ? 
 Why ? 
 Good morning . I'd like to buy 2 tickets . 
 I didn't know you have student tickets so I left them in my bag . 
 Here is the money . 
 How big , Elizabeth ? Last time you said that , I ended up working overtime 3 nights in a row ! 
 All right , Elizabeth . But this is the last time . 
 Good idea . We can finish this project the first thing tomorrow morning . 
 That ’ s great . Thanks for the ride . I really appreciate 1 it . You know my car is still in the shop . 
 It's very nice of you . 
 To your offer of three hundred and twenty thousand dollars , the owners have counter-offered three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars . 
 You , of course , have two ways of responding . You can say yes or come up with another offer . 
 There is always a chance that someone could outbid you , but you could try one more offer if you like . 
 After the owners get home from work tonight , I will approach them with your offer . 
 I don ’ t think that it will take as long as the response to the first offer . 
 Yes . What can I do for you ? 
 The volume is too loud . Would you kindly turn it down a little bit ? 
 This visit is over for me . Here's your room key . 
 And thanks to you . 
 I'd be willing to try this hotel again , if you can promise me no more cockroaches . 
 What kind of work do you want to do when you finish university ? 
 That ’ s a job that pays well . If you ’ re lucky , you might have opportunities to travel as well . Have you applied to any banks yet ? Our course will end soon . 
 Well done ! I haven ’ t sent off any job applications yet . 
 I ’ d like to work in marketing . I think I could have a good career in that field . 
 That ’ s great idea . Do you have the email address of human resource managers at any banks ? 
 We did the best that we could to give you a low price . Did you get our recent estimate ? 
 I've already given you a discount of 20 % off of our normally charge . If I go any lower , we'll have loss on this project . I really want to work with you on this . But we've already gone as low as we can go . 
 I'll tell you what , I'll go over the number again with our financial team and see what I can do . I can't give you any guarantees . But we can try . 
 Give me a little while longer . 
 There you go . How do you like it ? 
 You think it looks nice ? 
 Thanks . I'm glad that I did a good job . 
 Just give me $ 55 . 
 No problem , girl friend . I'll see you next time . 
 No , I cann't . I'm in a hurry ! 
 Shut up ! Now you are in my car , you should listen to me . Or you can get off . I've told you I'm in a hurry . I don't want to waste time on the road . 
 I want to change my job . 
 Well , I want to earn more . 
 Not only that . The job I ’ m doing now is the most boring job you can imagine . 
 Thank you , but I am in a terrible mood indeed . 
 I want to take them to court for arresting me . 
 There was no reason for them to arrest me . 
 They released me the next morning . 
 That ’ s exactly what they did . 
 They said I matched the description of a robber . 
 I ’ m definitely taking them to court . 
 I'm just responding to Sue's letter . Do you want to help ? 
 that's kind of boring . Don't you want to tell them anything else ? 
 you've been promoted ? when did that happen ? 
 congratulations ! That's really exciting ! Let's get out a bottle of wine to celebrate ! 
 ah . That can wait . Your promotion is the best news I've heard in a long time ! 
 ok , you're right . I'll just tell them how round I am of you for getting a promotion and then I'll thank Sue for her kind letter . 
 that's thoughtful of you . 
 that's right ! I almost forgot about that . 
 we do balance each other out well . I guess we were really made for each other ! 
 Yes . I think so . It ’ s not a very expensive apartment . It ’ s in the right area and it has everything that we are looking for . The rooms are quite large too . 
 The neighbourhood is nice too . There is a park nearby . 
 It ’ s a pity we can ’ t afford a house . A garden would be so nice . 
 The building is quite new and well constructed . I ’ m happy with the fittings too . 
 Housekeeping , may I help you ? 
 May I have your room number , please ? 
 505 . Let me check it out . Just a moment , please . I'm sorry . You're right . We have found your sweater . We made a mistake delivering the laundry . We'll send it up to your room at once . We're very sorry for the inconvenience 
 May I have my bill , please ? 
 Well , I am afraid you have made a mistake . Would you check it again , please ? 
 It doesn't matter . 
 What for ? 
 OK . But I hope it won't take too long . 
 Would you go to the bookstore with me ? 
 Do you know Jeffery has published his second detective novel ? 
 So what are you interested in ? 
 I know that magazine . It ’ s very popular . 
 Thank you . But I ’ m not interested . 
 Possibly . 
 Not a bit . 
 Yeah , he has a good commend of computer skills . But ... 
 But he is always talking big . 
 Oh , nice to see you . The apartment is on the tenth floor . The previous tenant just moved out yesterday . 
 Sure . Let me show you the way . Here we are . Apartment 1008 . ( They enter . ) This is the living room dining room combination . Here's the kitchen . It's small , but fully equipped . The refrigerator is new , and the stove and the microwave oven are less than a year old . 
 Yes . And there's a walk-in closet . 
 Yes , there's central air conditioning and heating . The thermostat is in the living room 。 
 It's 600 yuan per month.The rent is due no later than the tenth of the month . We ask that you leave a month's rent as a deposit . It will be returned to you at the end of your lease . 
 Wow , what a cool car ! The styling of this car really appeals to me . 
 I want to buy it . How much does this car cost ? 
 You can tell me here . I just want to know the price . 
 I appreciate your help , but I think I'll look around a bit . 
 I think that 30000 yuan would be fair for this car . 
 Can't you make it cheaper ? I still can't afford the car . 
 Hum ... OK . I will take it . 
 Do you ? Dad is in the study . 
 Behave yourself ! Don't make any noise . Have you finished your homework ? 
 Then let me see . 
 All right . Just five minutes . Be sure not to touch anything . 
 Be careful ! 
 Here is your spicy diced chicken with peanuts , sir . 
 I would advise you to enjoy the dish while it is hot . 
 Yes . It's a traditional dish . 
 You are right , sir . To prepare it , a Sichuan food chef first fries some chilli until they turn reddish brown , and then puts diced chicken breast meat into the pot with other condiments and peanuts . That's why the dish has a bright colour . 
 Enjoy yourself , sir . 
 Good morning . I ’ d like to book a room for Friday night and Saturday night . 
 A single room please . I hope you ’ re not fully booked . 
 Jones . According to your website , the nightly rate is $ 50 , including breakfast . 
 Thank you very much . I look forward to seeing you on Friday . 
 That ’ s fine . My credit card number is ... 
 I'm the manager . How can I help you ? 
 Why , yes , it is . Would you like to get a look inside the apartment ? 
 How about today at 6 o'clock ? 
 Sounds good . I'll see you at 6 . Do you want directions ? 
 If you like the place , you can fill out an application form . I'll bring one with me . 
 No . I won't need to see anything except your driver's license . 
 Er , let me see . Oh , look , you're right here . Pretty close to the Olympic Park . 
 Is this your first time here ? Where are you going ? 
 Oh , there are many Chinese antique stores . They get paintings , too . Do you get interested in them ? 
 Wow , it is quite far away from here . I'm afraid you're gonna have to take Bus No . 713 . 
 Is this a temporary job or something more permanent ? 
 When you get your next Continued Claim Form , you should just write down where you worked and note that you no longer need unemployment . 
 Just because you work for a week doesn ’ t mean that you will be losing your benefits . 
 Yes , you're right . 
 I've tried to give up smoking several times , but it's no good . Smoking relaxes me . 
 Yes , maybe I should have another try . 
 Indeed . Online banking enables you to make on-line shopping . 
 Bring your ID card and fill out a form . That will be fine . 
 I think online banking can change your money habits and it is quicker than ATM processing speed . 
 I don't know whether or not to believe him . 
 But it's really too important to me . 
 I know you are a good dancer . What dances do you like ? 
 Why do you like old styles of dance ? 
 I think so , because most young people like modern dances , such as rock and roll . 
 OK , I will.Thank you . 
 Yes , ma ’ am . How may I help you ? 
 Yes , we do deliveries for orders over $ 15 , ma ’ am . 
 But mum , I didn't mess it up . 
 Sorry , mum . I won't do it again . 
 Excuse me , sir . Are there only 3 programs in your hotel ? 
 Well . I am afraid it must be my fault . Can you send someone here to help me ? 
 I lost all my lottery winnings playing the stock market . 
 Hello , is that Cathy speaking ? 
 Yes , how are you doing ? 
 Say I've got two tickets for the concert this evening.Would you like to come with me ? 
 Then I ' ll pick you up at six thirty.OK ? 
 See you . 
 Easter's a good day for reunions . The family goes to church together . 
 Yup , a big potluck buffet . And then-notice there are no children around ? 
 The kids wait in the house while the grownups hide these . Hide away , Yi-jun ! 
 I don't know . I just know I've never been asked so many questions in my life . 
 Three-but there was one of them who kept asking really stupid questions . 
 Oh , he wanted to know what time I got up this morning and if I bad a bath or a shower you know , things like that . 
 I've no idea . Oh yes , and the most ridiculous thing . He asked me what I had for breakfast this morning . 
 Hmm . Thank you very much . 
 I met Amanda through a friend . 
 We started dating right away . 
 I swear , I ’ m going to kill you for this . 
 Oh , yeah ! I had a blast ! I love sweating like a pig with a bunch of pot bellies who all smell bad . Sorry , I ’ m just not into this health kick . 
 I am wiped out . Thank you . 
 Never ! But thank you for inviting me . 
 Bill , Happy Halloween ! 
 I will dress up as a vampire with big fangs . 
 Sure . Wait a moment . ( Several minutes later ) Here you are . 
 I will bite many beautiful girls on the neck tonight . Maybe I will suck their blood . 
 Hurry up , get in . 
 OK , make a left here . . . no wait , I meant make a right . Come on , speed up ! 
 Don ’ t worry about it , just drive . Oh , no , the light is about to change . . . step on it ! 
 Whatever . Just turn right here . . . . The freeway will be packed at this hour . . . . let ’ s take a side street.Go on ! Get out of our way ! Move , move ! 
 Here , I know a short cut ... just go down here , and we ’ ll cut though Ashburn Heights . Let ’ s go , let ’ s go ! Watch out for that lady ! 
 Yes ! We made it . 5:58 , just before the library closes . 
 Hello ? 
 Are you there yet ? 
 I just got off the subway . I'm almost there . Sorry I'm late . 
 Where are you ? 
 Should I come to the second floor or do you want to come to the first floor ? 
 What ? 
 Oh , OK . What are you doing there ? 
 Do you want to get something to eat later ? 
 What do you want to do ? 
 OK , see you soon . 
 Hello ! How can I help you , sir ? 
 Do you qualify for any of the Federal loan programs ? 
 Well . In that case we can offer you a private educational loan . 
 It's 7.2 % , fixed-rate loan . 
 Just fill out this application . We can let you know right away if you qualify . 
 It's one of the highlights of the match . 
 The wonderful passing Melaena did . 
 Finally the class is over . Be quick . Ben must have been waiting for long . 
 That's normal . You have been sitting for three hours , with your attention highly concentrated . 
 No . You are just burning yourself out these days . Have a good rest and you will feel energetic again . 
 How could he make such a silly mistake ? 
 He lost a very good chance to go to college , didn't he ? 
 That's a very good lesson . We must familiarize ourselves with the exam from now on . 
 I'd like to have rest , but I have many things to do . 
 It's very good , and the result isn't too bad . 
 Of course . I will write a report about this post-trip , and then you'd better type it at the moment , OK ? 
 ( Afternoon ) Miss Liu . Are you typing my report ? 
 Nothing . I just tell you take care of it when you type , especially the address and telephone number of those new guests . You should make sure that it's no mistaken . 
 Ha , I know you are great secretary . 
 have you seen the new Cosmo magazine that I was reading this morning ? 
 you're right , thanks . There's an interesting interview with a top director about his latest film that I want to finish . 
 it's Martin Scorsese . You liked his film , The Departed , didn't you ? 
 sure . You know it has an online edition , too . You should go online to read if you want to read it now . 
 no . I don't buy it regularly enough for it to be worthwhile . 
 it's almost three pounds now , and I think they're going to put the price up to four pounds soon . 
 Cosmo mainly has a middle-class readership , but I think circulation will fall dramatically if the price goes up anymore . 
 Hello , Rachel . It's glad to see you here . 
 I'm going to throw a party tomorrow night . Would you like to come ? 
 Of course . 
 At 6 o'clock . 
 See you . 
 How do you want your egg cooked ? 
 Okay , it'll be ready in two minutes . 
 I'll be with you in a minute . 
 Me , too . I've heard so much about you . 
 I was looking forward to your arrival . 
 Of course , they are out there . 
 Are you stupid ? They are called UFOs , so not everybody can see them . 
 That's right . I can see them in my dreams . 
 No . Their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space . 
 OK , OK , one by one , please ! They look like robots , but they can speak . Their mission is to make friends with human beings . 
 Of course in English , they learn English on Mars too . 
 Hello , can I speak to Alice , please ? 
 Thank you . 
 Could you tell her Tom Green called ? 
 Hey , Jack ! Is Jenny coming with us ? 
 Nothing . I am just asking . 
 Who has a crush ? 
 Well , I don't have the guts to ask her out . 
 I ’ d totally die if she turned me down . 
 I don't know .. Well , maybe you are right , but how am I gonna tell her ? 
 Yes , it does . 
 There is a stop at Tiananmen Square . The stops will be announced on the bus both in English and Chinese . When the stop is coming , you just push the red button near the rear door if you want to get off . 
 What are the pop groups that you like ? 
 I agree ! I cried for a week when they broke up . 
 Do you have any idea why I pulled you over today ? 
 One of your brake lights is out . 
 I'm going to give you a ticket . 
 It's just a ticket . 
 The judge will let you know . 
 Of course . 
 Dad , can you help me ? 
 I don't know how to do it . 
 16 divided by 2 . What's the answer ? 
 You got it . Good job . 
 Thank you for noticing ! I've been making a few lifestyle changes over the past year . 
 Well , it all started when my brother challenged me to quit smoking . 
 When I kicked that habit , I found I had so much more energy . I started exercising . 
 No . I like to be outside . I took up hiking and mountain biking . 
 No . 
 I got robbed ! 
 Some guy on the street just mugged me . 
 No , he just stole all of my things . 
 I need to go to the police station . 
 That would be great . Thank you . 
 I am returning these books . 
 I accidentally ripped the cover . 
 How much do I need to pay ? 
 That ’ s not too expensive . 
 Here ’ s the $ 5.00 . 
 No problem . Have a good one . 
 Oh , I am very sorry , Hans . Thank you for waiting for me . You must have been here a long time already . 
 I was caught in the heavy rain , or I would have come earlier . I am sorry I kept you waiting . 
 Yes . When I came out of the subway , it was raining cats and dogs . And I forgot my umbrella . So I had to wait for the rain to let up . 
 Your resume says you have had one years experience working in a foreign representative office in Shanghai , may I ask why you quit ? 
 Have you done any work in this field ? What have you learned from the jobs you have had ? 
 Is that true ? 
 Wow . She looks good for having had that many kids . She's pregnant and wearing Prada ! 
 She's glowing . It must be the pregnancy . 
 What should I prepare for the recruitment fair ? 
 What application materials should I take ? 
 You're my hero . 
 Good morning and welcome . How can I help you ? 
 We have 3 different types of boxes . We usually rent for 1 year and the fee depends on the size and location of the box . 
 You can have more than 1 key if you'd like , but we must have signature cards for each box . 
 If you have your ID and are willing to pay a year in advance , we can do that for you today , there is no need to wait . 
 See you later , alligator . 
 Where are you going ? 
 Going to work where ? 
 I didn ’ t know you were working there this year . 
 How did you get that job ? 
 That ’ s really cool . 
 Do they pay you a lot ? 
 Have you been to Shanghai before ? 
 That sounds great . Have you been to the top of the Pearl Tower ? 
 So you haven ’ t done much then , in Shanghai ? 
 Jim was late again . 
 Wow , this is the famous Empire State Building . 
 Would you like to go to the top ? 
 The view is breathtaking . 
 Yes , I'd like some information about the trains to Beijing . 
 On July 7 , I have to be there well before twelve o ’ clock . 
 And I have to get up early , too . Are there any non-stop trains to Beijing ? 
 Can you believe me ? 
 Please count on my love . 
 I'll be yours through endless time . 
 Thank you . I know I've nothing to offer you , but I'll never give you reason to cry . 
 My love will grow , like a river to flow . 
 I don't know whether we are in a dream . 
 I'm frustrated . 
 I can't work out this problem . 
 Thanks . I really appreciate it . 
 Sorry , madam . I afraid you have a wrong number.we don't have Mr Over here . 
 No , you give a wrong number . 
 That's all right . 
 Everything that came in off the fax machine last night is all on your desk . But I noticed that some of the faxes came through pretty blurred . Maybe you can take a look at them . If the copy is unreadable , I'll call them and ask them to relax . 
 What about that one ? 
 You know , I think the fax machine is out of toner , I can change the toner cartridge . That should solve the problem . 
 I guess the fax machine is out of paper , too . Don't worry , I'll have someone look at it this afternoon , and in the meantime , I'll have your documents re-faxed to our other fax machine . 
 Uh ... I mostly just like to listen . You're the groom . Why don't you go first ? 
 How about " As long as You Love Me " ! You can pretend you're singing it to your fiancee Brooke ! 
 Hello . I am calling about the apartment you advertised . 
 I am interested in one-bedroom . Do you have any available ? 
 Sometime around next week . What can you tell me about this apartment ? 
 Sounds good . May I come over tomorrow to take a look ? 
 How about 10 am ? 
 My name is Blanca . 
 Hello ! We ’ Ve been waiting for our lunch order for over an hour . Did you forget our order ? 
 The name ’ s Stanley Morris and the order was for two chef ’ s salads . 
 Hi , how can I help ? 
 Unfortunately , if you wish to withdraw on your C / D before the pre-decided date , you must give notice . 
 Yes , you will lose interest . I see that you have a 5 - year C / D with us . I'm sorry to tell you that would mean losing 6 months of interest as a penalty for withdrawing before maturity . 
 Hello . I am calling to apply for the job as an airlines staff . I'd like to check it . Is it part-time or a full-time job ? 
 What does the job description say ? 
 Hello , this is Liu Juan speaking . Is that Mr . Brown ? 
 Could you please get him on the phone ? 
 I find that every employee here respects that manager very much . 
 You said you like classical music very much . Then who is your favorite opera star ? 
 Oh , you mean Pavarotti , Domingo and Carreras . Have you been to their live shows ? 
 I've heard of that one . It was also his swan song . 
 Of course not . People all over the world watch it on TV , or listen to it on the radio . 
 Yes , I went to the New Year's Concert in 2005 . 
 That's for sure . You know , it's really amazing to be in the best concert hall , listening to the performance by the best orchestra . I had the greatest time ever . 
 Lorin Maazel . He did an amazing job . Moreover , he just celebrated his 75th birthday . 
 The right opportunity for you would come along soon . You know , music is transnational . 
 You look like being on cloud nine . 
 What has made you so happy ? 
 Are you ? Who's the lucky girl ? 
 How did you meet her ? 
 What do you like best about her ? 
 I guess it was fate working to bring you together . 
 And how would you describe yourself , Miss Tao ? What kind of person are you ? 
 Did you have any difficulty getting along with fellow students or teachers ? 
 What's your strong points ? 
 What do you dislike most about your job ? 
 What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a supervisor and employee ? 
 Sometimes working with a foreign company can be stressful . Foreigners tend to get excited or angry easily , and they show it . Are you sure you can handle this stress ? How do you deal with conflict in your present job ? 
 How do you feel about overtime work ? 
 What is most important to you in a job ? 
 Do you think that you are introverted or extroverted ? 
 Under what kind of circumstance will you lose your temper ? 
 OK . What are your strong points ? 
 And your weaknesses ? 
 Do you have a swimming pool in this hotel ? 
 I never heard of a swim station . Is that like a train or bus station ? 
 Holy cow ! I never heard of such a thing . How much do they cost ? 
 This sounds better every second . Now , when can I use the stations ? 
 Oh , boy ! This is going to be great . I'm going to the gym right now ! 
 Hi , Nally , are you hungry ? 
 Where to ? 
 Are you kidding ? That place is too ritzy for lunch . 
 Same thing , meals there all coarsen arm and leg . 
 Let's stop it at Multicolor for a quick lunch .. 
 That was a great lunch , the food was good , but the service was lousy . 
 You got it . All right , Let's go back to school . 
 Very well . You know , we have definite ways of packaging garments . As to blouses , we use a polythene wrapper for each article , all ready for window display . 
 Right you are . We'll see to it that the blouses appeal to the eye as well as to the purse . 
 We'll pack them 10 dozens to one carton , gross weight around 25 kilos a carton . 
 Yes , corrugated cardboard boxes . 
 Why use wooden cases ? 
 The cartons are comparatively light , and therefore easy to handle . They won't be stowed away with the heavy cargo . The stevedores will see to that . Besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with straps . Silk blouses are not fragile goods . They can stand a lot of jolting . 
 No need to worry about that . The cartons lined with plastic sheets are waterproof , and as the boxes are made of cardboard , they will be handled with care . 
 Tampering with cartons is easily detected . I should say that this rather discourages pilferage . 
 But cartons are quite seaworthy . They are extensively used in our shipments to continental ports . There are never any complaints from our clients , and our insurance company has also approved such packing for W . P . A . and T . P . N . D . 
 I'm sorry , but we can't take on any responsibility that is beyond our functions and powers . We'll make sure that the packing is seaworthy , but we can't commit ourselves to being responsible for every kind of mishap . 
 We'll use wooden cases if you insist , but the charge for packing will be considerably higher , and it also slows delivery . 
 Please do . I'll be waiting for your reply . 
 He has lost his job , and his wife died from cancer not long before . 
 I have an idea for Christmas this year . 
 Let's not exchange any gifts at all . 
 Hear me out . We can pool the money and give it to a family who could really use it ! 
 Actual 1y , it was their idea first . 
 A woman after my own heart ... 
 Well , step two is grinding the coffee beans . I've roasted three different types of beans . 
 Yep , my own special blend ! You can tell by just smelling them ? 
 Hi , my name is Lean , and I'm from Russia . 
 To me English is a difficult language . 
 True , but English is harder than most.It ' s a crazy language . 
 One letter can have several pronunciations and one word can have several meanings . 
 Hello . Dr . Brown ’ s Dental Office . How can I help you ? 
 What happened ? 
 Sure , you can , but you ’ ll be charged for $ 10 . 
 This is for the delayed cancellation . Because this time is reserved for you . If you are unable to keep an appointment , you should notify us 48 hours in advance . Otherwise , the charge will be made . 
 Thanks for your understanding . Do you want to make another appointment ? 
 Ok . Take care . 
 Hello , jewelry department . How may I help you ? 
 He's probably a pervert . Just ignore him . 
 Maybe he wants to get something for his girlfriend , but he's embarrassed . 
 Oh , come on ! I have sixteen items ! Cut me some slack , will ya ? 
 Plastic . I also have a couple of coupons . 
 Darn ! Oh , well . I guess it ’ s just not my day . Thanks anyway . 
 Yeah I got a club card . Here you go .

 Everything is OK now , doctor . 
 You are welcome , doctor . 
 The total is 87 dollars . Here is the bill .

 Sure . 
 It's getting late . I really have to go . 
 I hope so . A good journey to you ! 
 Mom , Dad ! Can you come to my room ? I think there is something under my bed ! 
 Your total comes to $ 36.78 . 
 There ’ s a problem with your card . 
 I believe it was declined . 
 Do you have another card I could try ? 
 Do you have cash , perhaps ? 
 You ’ re not going to be able to take these items today . 
 Do you have a bf ? 
 Why you say bf before ? 
 Have you got a new one ? 
 I am single , I have no real of , only an E-gf , that is you . 
 I like you . Do you agree to be my of ? 
 Wow ! Blablablabla . . . 
 I am flying like a bird . 
 I am so happy . I want to drink a cup of champagne . 
 It's OK , so I send you this . 
 It's my heart ; it's made of what you like . 
 Are you sleepy ? 
 Yes , I do not want to see ur sleeping in the office . 
 C U here , honey . 
 Yeah , I think I'll get this one-piece . 
 I'm too fat for a bikini . 
 I'll wear that if you'll wear these Speedos . 
 John dates her seven times a week . 
 I think so . Maybe he's fallen for her . 
 Sir , I've finished your shaving . Wow , it takes years off you after having a shave . 
 Thank you . May I suggest you to trim your eyebrows ? 
 No , sir , I am serious . Haven't you heard that today men are becoming increasingly interested in having their eyebrows professionally groomed ? 
 Absolutely . Several men have tried it in my A shop . Do you want to try ? 
 Does this hotel have a pool ? 
 I'm not sure I understand . 
 Cool . What will they think of next ? How much are they ? 
 Excellent ! Now what are the hours ? 
 I'm going to change into my trunks right now ! 
 Can you tell me how to reach the bank please ? 
 I have an AIR pass card and I want to withdraw money from the bank . 
 How do I get there . I have no knowledge of this area . 
 It sounds very complicated . How far is it from here ? 
 Oh , I would really appreciate that . By the way will I be going North or South ? 
 To start with , may I ask why you chose to work at our company ? 
 Well , please look at the employment contract . I'd like to go over the main details again before signing . First , you will be getting a monthly salary , and no probation is involved . 
 Of course . A reasonable number of sick days will be covered by the company . Any extended illness will be covered by insurance . Have you read the other terms of the contract ? 
 Yes , any approved overtime of more than two hours will be paid twice of the salary or take time-off . 
 Good . Now , you sign here , you can start work the beginning of next month . 
 My name is Jeff . 
 I ’ m a podiatrist . What about you ? 
 I like to play piano , go bowling and chat with my friends.And you ? 
 Would you like to go out some time ? 
 Anywhere with you . 
 Daddy , how are you going to spend your weekends ? 
 Could you go with me to climb Kiang Shan ? 
 Oh , Daddy , you should do more exercise . You are getting a little heavy . 
 Then go climbing with me , Daddy . Mountain climbing can build your muscles like Popeyes . 
 I give you my word , you must feel refreshed after mountain climbing . 
 That's a deal . 
 Oh dear , Miss , you are soaked ! Wow , it's really raining heavily outside . 
 Well please , why don't you go ahead of me in line ? I'm in no hurry . 
 My pleasure Miss . Actually , could you recommend what to eat here ? I've never been here before . 
 Well , thanks for the suggestions . 
 I think that show biz stars have a really easy life . They have lots of money , so they can buy almost anything they want . They ’ re famous , so everyone loves them . 
 I bet they love it really . Sure , they complain about it , but that just gets them more publicity , doesn ’ t it ? 
 No way ! They want publicity for themselves , so that they get invited to make more films , go to lots of cocktail parties , and even make albums ! They have such an easy life . They don ’ t even pay for Drin 
 I don ’ t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . They ’ re overpaid , over-ambitious , and over-adored . 
 Come on ! They only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves . 
 But it was her that makes us so embarrassed . 
 I don't care . 
 Well , everybody wants the bottom bunk . Why don't we flip a coin for it ? 
 Yes . Here's a quarter . I flip it , you call it in the air . 
 Sorry , it's tails . You lose . 
 Your stereo is better than mine . Do you mind if we use yours ? 
 Probably we can put one on that counter . And we can put one on the floor by the bed . Over there . 
 Well , the desk by the window is nicer , of course . Don't you think ? 
 So since I got the bottom bunk , why don't you get the desk by the window ? That would be more fair . 
 I mean , we could flip a coin for it , but I would probably win again . I'm incredibly lucky you know . Especially with girls . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 Oh , certainly . Certainly . I'm always willing to help beginners.Just call me Big Brother Dave . 
 C'mon , don't take it seriously ! I'm just kidding . 
 Why don't we start unpacking these boxes ? 
 Alright . See you later . 
 What ? 
 Wow ! Congratulation ! When do classes start ? 
 You ’ re so lucky ! Do you have to do many things before you leave ? 
 When can you do that ? 
 Sure . What can you choose from ? 
 What is your major ? 
 What are the fundamental course ? 
 Interesting . That ’ s very different from the Chinese education system . 
 Really ? 
 why not ? 
 Hello , have you made a reservation ? 
 Of course.How do you like your room ? 
 OK , how long are you staying ? 
 What seems to be the problem , kid ? 
 Ah ... How long have you been like this ? 
 Do you have any stomachache ? 
 Open your mouth and say ah ... God , you are suffering from the swelling of tonsils . 
 Yes , I am sure that you got the flu . You need a shot . 
 Yes , that's for sure . But it is not that bad . It's gonna be all right . 
 Be brave , young man . Only girls cry when given an injection . 
 It's raining heavily . 
 All right . 
 No , we can't . It's thundering . 
 Before we begin eating , I'd like to present everyone with a gift from Taiwan . 
 It's a Taiwanese puppet doll . 
 Yeah . They're usually this big . 
 All the parts work . 
 Don't mention it . 
 How about Great Canyon ? 
 Of course ! It's the most wonderful natural works . 
 Calm down . 
 Thank you . Jack , it's always a pleasure doing business with you . 
 Great ! And , how are things in your neck of the woods ? 
 Oh.Jack , I have missed your sense of humor.Ha ha ha ! Nobody else sees things quite like you do.It ' s your gift . 
 Nope , it's a gift.Anyway , we need some more of those mid-range speakers you tricked me into buying last time . 
 Are you still gouging your customers the same price per unit ? 
 You silver-tongued devil . Can't you ever just answer a question with a simple yes or no ? 
 It's four o'clock already . I hate to leave , but I think I must . 
 I'm sorry , but I can't . 
 Yes , it's really a surprise . How are you ? 
 Oh , he is all right . But busy as usual . Well , why don't we have a good chat at a bar ? It's been long time since we met each other last time . 
 How was your shopping trip Martin ? 
 Oh really ? Did you find any bargains ? 
 And how did you get around town ? 
 Right , so you didn ’ t get lost ? 
 I am sorry . I didn ’ t accomplish the job on time . 
 You are in love with Mary , right ? 
 I am not blind . Anyone can see that with half an eye . 
 Yes . I'd like to check in , please . 
 Sure . Here they are . 
 What's the weight limit ? 
 I hope my baggage aren't overweight . 
 May I carry this satchel ? 
 OK . 
 Which gate ? 
 Thank you . 
 That ’ s an exception . But I am fed up with those who keep a straight face in front of me . 
 That means you don ’ t like them . If you hit it off with them , you will like to see their smiles . 
 Well , I ’ Ve already got a job waiting for me back in my hometown . 
 I ’ m planning on living with my parents . Won ’ t you ? 
 You mean they ’ re kicking you out ? 
 Well , it ’ s not like my parents want me to live at home the rest of my life . They said that it ’ s ok if I move back home to begin with , but they want me to find a place of my own after a year or so . 
 I know I need to learn that myself , but I just don ’ t have the money for it at the moment . Living at home allows me to save up some money before I started finding a place . 
 Supervisor . Open the door . 
 What are you doing here ? 
 Your neighbors complained that you were so noisy that they can't sleep . 
 Please turn down the TV . And not another shout or I'll have to report you to the school administration . 
 Is the room ready for the meeting , Miss Chen ? 
 How about the microphone and speakers ? 
 Good . Have you prepared some paper and pencils for the participants ? 
 Lisa , I ’ Ve been thinking of something . 
 Well . I ’ Ve done a lot of business for my company . And now I feel like going into business for myself . 
 There ’ s a possibility . What do you say ? 
 Can we have two tickets for this evening's film ? 
 Titanic . 
 Front , please . 
 Do you have seats in the fourth or fifth rows ? 
 All right.We ' ll take the second row.By the way , how much is it ? 
 Fairly expensive . 
 You mean like a breast enlargement ? I don't think that's really necessary . That's not the way a woman should stay attractive . 
 Because ... I don't know . But , Connie , you wouldn't do that , would you ? 
 Maybe make-up would be enough ? 
 But what would other people think ? 
 Jack , I don't know how to write my resume . Could you tell me about that ? 
 What does the contact information include ? 
 Anything else ? 
 I see . It is the position desired 
 I see . Skills are about specialty , and educational background is easy as well . But what about related experience ? I have little work experience . 
 I see . By the way , should I write the educational background starting from elementary school ? 
 Thank you very much . I will write it right now . 
 It would be good if you could get them to me by Thursday afternoon , Ms . Barkley . 
 7880 Crofton Avenue , Building 40A , Room 304 . 
 To be honest , I haven't really done much research . 
 Thanks for your advice , after going through all of these materials I've decided not to go with my initial choice . 
 hi , Isaiah . How are you ? 
 fine . How ’ s your job going ? 
 really ? That ’ s fantastic . What kind of business is it ? 
 how ’ s it going ? 
 that ’ s such great news . I ’ m really happy for you ! Where is your office located ? 
 where will those be located ? 
 when will you find out ? 
 well , good luck . I hope it all goes well for you tomorrow ! 
 Is everything ready for Billy ’ s birthday party ? 
 Yes , I did . I ’ Ve put one on the table for each child . I put up the big “ happy birthday ” sign too . 
 I ’ m sure of that . There ’ s enough food here to feed an army ! 
 Thanks for reminding me . I ’ Ve prepared some party games for the children too . 
 Hopefully , that will keep everyone happy . 
 Yeah , time for more coffee ! 
 By the way , I heard Kitty's just got in a shipment of Jamaican Blue Mountain . 
 It's only the rarest coffee in the world ! Didn't your momma teach you anything when you were growing up ? 
 I'm nervous . I have to make a big presentation in the meeting . 
 So , Casey , how are things going with the photos for the press kit ? 
 You ’ Ve had over a month to get this finalized ! Why are things delayed ? 
 I ’ m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time ! 
 I ’ m not going to put this off any longer , Casey ! I want those photos ASAP ! 
 Thank you , Alice . Come in to the dining-room . I ’ m going to cut the cake soon . Have some please . 
 Ok . I ’ m pretty happy and I can go abroad . 
 Excuse me , are you American ? 
 Do you speak English ? 
 How long have you been here ? 
 What do you do for work ? 
 I'm a student too . 
 9:25 on Platform 12 , Track B . 
 It should be there at 11:45 , but it may be a little late . 
 It's $ 32.00 . 
 I can't believe it 。 
 Autumn is the best season in Beijing you know ? 
 What is the whether like in Washington at this time of this year ? 
 Is it very cold in winter there ? 
 Does it rain a lot in summer there ? 
 How about here in Beijing ? 
 I feel it ’ s rather dry here 
 Are you from south ? 
 I see . So this is your hometown ? 
 There is a shop on the ground floor . It sells both Chinese and foreign cigarettes . 
 Yes , sir . There is a counter selling all kinds of souvenirs 
 There is one at the end of the corridor . 
 You are welcome . 
 Sure , if I can 
 By airmail or seamail ? 
 Your parcel weights 420 grams . So it is 21.3 dollars by air , or 6.9 dollars by sea . 
 About a month . 
 Please fill out this form , and then take your parcel to the counter on my left-hand side . 
 Not at all . 
 I heard that there are some beauty spots and places of historical interest in this city . 
 That's great . I trouble you so much . Thank you very much . 
 OK , let ’ s go . 
 Fine . Shanghai and Beijing are thousands of miles away . How about bullet train ? Faster and relatively cheap , I think . 
 Oh , what a shame . Only sleeping cars have tickets . Others are all out of stock . The price of the sleeping car is almost the same as the airplane.You see , the discount plane tickets are no more than 500 yuan . A good deal , isn't it ? 
 Labor is an abundant resource here . 
 Good morning , Mr Croft . 
 Do you have an appointment ? 
 Is it urgent ? 
 Can you come at 10 am on Monday , April 24th ? 
 The dentist is very busy at the moment . Can you come at 2 PM ? 
 I'm afraid that he can't , Mr Croft . Can't you wait till this afternoon ? 
 How are you doing , Andrew ? 
 But you have so many friends ! How could you be lonely ? 
 What about me ? I ’ m your friend . 
 I know what you mean . I find it difficult to make new friends , too . It ’ s not as easy as it was when we were young , is it ? 
 I ’ Ve made a lot of new friends since I started learning English . Maybe you could join a club or take a class to make some new friends . 
 What kind of qualities do you look for in a friend ? 
 People who play ultimate Frisbee have a positive attitude ; maybe you should join the ultimate Frisbee club . 
 David , what have you been up to lately ? 
 Really ? Where did you go ? 
 What cities did you go to ? 
 Did you go to Berlin ? 
 I think this summer is a good time to visit Berlin . It's a beautiful place and the people there are very nice . 
 I went there last year . If you want , I can give you some information I have about the city . 
 We have absolute proof that you committed the crime . 
 My goodness ! She is thirty seconds faster than the world record in 5000 metres race . 
 A Chinese girl has broken the world record in the Olympic Games . 
 You have to . It is sure . 
 What do you mean his grandmothers are already dead ? Wait a minute , you don't think he's avoiding me , do you ? 
 Oh man , I hate rejection . It really makes you feel terrible , especially when you really liked the person . 
 I just have to come up for air . I ’ Ve been here for too long a time . 
 Why do you want to work in our company ? 
 Can you tell me something about the balance sheet now ? 
 I'll have to go now . 
 See you . 
 I think most people treat animals well , but we are often cruel to animals . When we raise animals for food , the conditions they live in are often poor . 
 What would you do with all the animals ? You couldn ’ t just let them go . Besides , some people would still hunt them . Meat has become an integral part of our diet . 
 That ’ s true . I think zoo are a good idea , because they allow people to get close to animals . I think it ’ s good for kids to see wild animals . 
 I read that the number of animals being used in experiments is falling dramatically as new techniques are being introduced . 
 Sometimes you read about people who have been cruel to pets or other animals , but those stories are rare . 
 Yes , I have . They do an excellent job . 
 Yes , sir ? 
 What kind of magazines would you like , fashion or sports ? 
 OK . I'll be right back with you . 
 Hey , May , how are you doing ? 
 Why is that ? 
 But you ’ re in China . Are you planning on going home for Christmas ? 
 Why not just give them money in red envelopes ? That would be much easier . 
 I've got it . I won ’ t bother you any more . You ’ d better hurry to do it , Christmas is just around the corner . 
 Oh , I must have been sitting in the same position too long . My legs have fallen asleep . 
 And I need to stretch my legs now . 
 Yes , we shall . What size do you like ? 
 Which do you prefer , color or black and white ? 
 OK . 
 They will be ready at noon tomorrow . Each negative develops one print , right ? 
 No problem . Do you need another film ? 
 It is totally $ 20 including the deposit for films . 
 Let's blow on it . 
 Yummy ! Yummy ! Eat more ! 
 Yes , I do . But my characters are very bad . 
 Are you Chinese by birth ? 
 How do you like it ? 
 I want to study Mandarin and public relations . 
 I still have five seats in the mezzanine . 
 No . Nothing . I'm sorry . 
 A new candy shop just opened around the corner last week . They have a variety of candies and it is always full of people . 
 Are you serious ? It is always crowded with many people . 
 Look at the candy bar over there . It is so colorful and tasty . 
 I want to get a big bag and buy a little of everything . 
 To be honest , I care only about whether I can have some delicious candy eat . I couldn't care less about whether the shop is popular or not . 
 That is true . Speaking of cavities , I am starting to feel something is wrong with my teeth now . Let's get more strawberry chocolate drops before we go home . 
 What's wrong ? 
 You should get acupuncture treatment . My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her . 
 They don't just randomly stick you , they find your pressure points . The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment , restoring the body's " chi " . 
 The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options . 
 This only signifies that the toxins have left the body . Actually , there is only discomfort during the treatment process . Once it's over you feel very comfortable . 
 This is the only way to get at the problem . Anyway , if you want to relieve the pain , you are just going to have to be tough and do it . 
 I'm here for my appointment . 
 I have an issue with my schedule . 
 I have two classes on here that are at the same time . 
 Can you change that for me ? 
 Yes , I would like to keep both classes . 
 I would greatly appreciate that . 
 Let me help you . OK , this is the one you want . Push this button to change the channel . We have 6 channels in all . Have a good day . 
 Hi , may I get you anything to drink ? 
 Would you like an appetizer ? 
 Sure , would you like anything else ? 
 Okay , tell me when you want to order the rest of your food . 
 What would you like ? 
 Sure , will there be anything else that I can get you ? 
 You're in great shape , Keith . Do you work out at a gym ? 
 So , how often do you work out ? 
 Say , I like racquetball , too . 
 Uh ... how well do you play ? 
 Well , all right . But I'm not very good . 
 Well , I'm thinking of going to see the ballet Swan Lake by the famous Russian National Ballet Troupe this evening at Beijing Grand Theater . Why don't you join me ? 
 You always work too hard , Jim . As the saying goes , all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy . You should spare some time for a rest . 
 Just take it easy . Come on with me . 
 How's your mother doing ? 
 That's too bad . I wish your mother can recover soon . 
 Is that Room service ? 
 I have made a reservation for my breakfast last night . But I still haven't got it . I am so hungry now . 
 203 . 
 Mr . Zhang , are you still there ? 
 Can she call you back ? She is about to start a meeting . 
 Good afternoon . what can I do for you ? 
 May I have your key please ? 
 Here is your valuable . Is that right ? 
 Do you want some dessert ? 
 Where is our waitress anyway ? 
 I'll walk over and get the bill , since I don't think the waitress is coming over here any time soon . 
 So the bill is $ 36.00 . 
 My first inclination is to leave nothing for a tip . 
 Let's leave 10 % , so that we at least leave something for the service . 
 Would you like something to eat ? 
 Would you like to call home ? 
 Please use the phone . 
 Hello , is that Xiaogang Li who applied for the Solar Studio of our college ? 
 I want to know whether you will come to the interview . So have you accepted offers from other companies ? 
 I can't decide what I should do . 
 Should I date Tom or should I date Harry ? 
 Well , this is certainly a nice place , Mr . Taylor . What sort of public transportation is nearby ? 
 Yes , two . 
 We send our kids to private school , but that ’ s good to know too . 
 Great . Well , we ’ ll have to think about it , but the place looks great . 
 Right Rebecca . Now I see that after graduating from University your first job was ... 
 Certainly . And after your internship ? 
 Yes I see . But you decided to leave them in 2006 right . 
 The London Weekly right . 
 Would you like to have a piece of cake ? 
 Why ? You're not fat . 
 Women of all shapes would be beautiful if they are self-confident . 
 Well . There's a beauty contest in Thailand just for fat beauties . 
 All the beauties who entered the contest were over 80kg . 
 Hello ! 
 This is Doris . Who's calling please ? 
 Oh , I almost forgot . Thank you for calling to remind me . Actually . I do need to change the time of my appointment . I have a scheduling conflict . And I can't make it that early . 
 It would have to be after lunch . Do you have anything available about 2 o'clock ? 
 That ’ s alright , . I think I should be able to make it at one fifteen . Can you put me down for that time slot ? 
 Wonderful . Thanks very much . 
 No , not this weekend . I have too much work to do . 
 My father lives in Washington DC . 
 My mother died two years ago . 
 No , he's retired . 
 Yes , two of my cousins live here and my aunt and uncle live about 30 miles from here . 
 Yes , I have two brothers who live in New York and a sister who lives in Boston . 
 Not as much as I'd like to . Usually just on holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas . 
 How can I forget my old friend ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 The fundraiser events went really well . We were able to partner with a few of our competitors , all in fun of course , to sponsor a marathon for the American Cancer Society . All of the people who participated it had a great time , and we were able to raise a lot of money to contribute to cancer research . 
 Each of the runners that participated the marathon race paid a ten dollar entrance fee . Also , they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran . All in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars . 
 In all honesty , it's also a great deal for our company . The exposure that we gained from sponsoring an invent like this was great for our image in the community . We accomplished as much as last year's advertising campaign , plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause . 
 No , I haven't . I've decided I ' m going to travel very light this time . 
 Oh ! It means that I'm going to take only a few clothes , so I didn't have to carry a heavy suitcase . 
 Yes , can I help you ? 
 OK , here you are . 
 This is my favourite restaurant . 
 Yes , there might be some food you have never eaten before . 
 Oh yes . Like this , for example . Have you ever eaten jellyfish before ? 
 What about these ? Have you ever tried pig ’ s brains ? 
 May I come in ? 
 Nice to meet you , Mr . Peter . I ’ m Wang Sian . I ’ Ve come for an interview as requested . 
 Thank you . 
 I majored in Public Relations . 
 Yes , after my graduation , I worked in a trade company in Macao for one year . 
 The export Business Section . 
 Yes , very much . 
 How is grandpa doing recently ? 
 Maybe I would talk with him someday . 
 Sarah . You look terrible . What's wrong ? 
 I'm so sorry to hear that . When did this happen ? 
 Is there anything I can do ? 
 I'm sure she knew you loved her . Did she pass away in the hospital ? 
 I'm sorry she's gone . 
 I think your grandmother would want you to think of all the good times you spent together . 
 When my grandmother passed away , I frequently visited her in the cemetery . I always talked to her . Even though she wasn't there , I somehow knew she heard what I said . 
 It looks like you haven't eaten anything all day . We should get you something to eat . 
 So do you think I can take it ? 
 I know , but things are getting a bit out of hand and I just can ’ t do nothing . 
 You ’ re right . 
 Well , I'm leaving Japan and I'm going back to London , tomorrow . 
 Yeah . 
 Well , I do feel quite down because I am going to miss Japan after being here for 9 months , in Japan . I am going to miss it so much , cause I've had a great time here . 
 Oh , I am going to miss the people , the food , the night life . Especially the nightlife . 
 Well , I really like dancing . And I enjoy going out to night clubs and to restaurants and eating Japanese food also and I'm really going to miss that because it's very different to London . 
 Well , here there are many different clubs you can get into , for free , you don't have to pay , some of them . In London it's really expensive for drinks and an entry fee . 
 You must have a rich boyfriend because that bag is so expensive ! 
 No kidding ! Then how do you know the bag's real ? 
 A risk I would never take ... 
 Next is a ballet performance , but who is the dancer ? 
 Since when did Eddy start doing ballet ? ! 
 Look ! He has a partner ! 
 Gross ! 
 But I think Eddy is going too far ! 
 Oh ! Ouch ! That must've hurt ! 
 Excuse me . Where is Q-Duck ? I remember it was around the second intersection of this street . 
 Yes , definitely . 
 Wow , this place is quite different from ten years ago when I first came to China . 
 This street used to have few stores . But now , you can see supermarkets , shopping malls and department stores everywhere . 
 Me too ! I was lost three times ten years ago . There were no English directions then . 
 Yeah , there are many English signs , and wrong spellings as many as them . 
 My name is Steven and I live in Beijing . I was born in 1980 . I have graduated from Peking University . I majored in business administration . 
 I have been a production manager . 
 I introduced an advanced product line , which increased the output and lessened the cost . 
 I have experience in computer operation , proficiency in Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel . 
 Because the job I am doing in my present company is of no challenge , but I like challenge . Your firm is a young organization with many innovative ideas . It has been very successful in expanding market since its establishment 10 years ago . Working for you would be exactly the sort of challenge I am looking for . 
 Thank you , Mr . Smith . 
 This go-around we're focusing on new moms , families with median income and one or more children under the age of two . 
 Well , there are some similarities that come up . Because both groups are made up of mothers ... so as before , we can play up on maternal instincts , hygiene , safety , along those lines . But that being said , there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here . 
 Demographics say an average age of 28.7 , educational background of university or post-grad , annual household income of 40-50 K a year . 
 Absolutely ! Everything that ’ s thrilling turns me on . 
 What is it ? 
 He borrowed it from Nick . 
 He was too desperate to find some other way . 
 Most of the time I'll be on a tour , enjoying the beautiful scenery there . 
 I'll go to the Yellow Stone Park , and Great Canyon . 
 Quite often . It is very convenient , saving me a lot of time . 
 You are asking the right person . Here are two very important tips . First , you need to visit no more than one site to find the best products and prices . I can recommend you some online merchants . Second , write your mail address correctly . Otherwise , you can ’ t receive your delivery in time . 
 Not at all . You just need to provide your name , address , e-mail address , phone number and bank or credit card information . I will help you with that . 
 Hi , I was wondering if you have my test results in . 
 So , basically , I am OK ? 
 What will I learn when I see the results on the website ? 
 What will the numbers tell me ? 
 Are all of my test results on that site ? 
 Whose part do you think is best played ? 
 You're absolutely right ! That's the very figure I like best . 
 Good morning . I came in answer to your advertisement for a salesperson . 
 I'm afraid I haven't had any experience in just this sort of work . I'm studying business administration in college . I want to get a job that would tie in with my studies . 
 I worked in a department store in a small town last summer vacation . 
 I graduated from Beijing University . I majored in business administration . 
 The courses I completed are marketing , business law , business English , statistics , marketing principles , sales management , distribution theory , economies and psychology . 
 I liked sales strategies most . 
 It's an interesting job , and your company is one of the best known . Although I have no work experience as a salesperson , the job description you sent was very interesting . It's a job I've been dreaming of when I was at university . 
 I have an interest in marketing and I would consider graduate study in business in the future . I think my goals will become more clear as I gain experience in sales and marketing . 
 Yes , a little . As you mentioned just now , yours is an American capital company . As far as I know your company is a world famous one which produces cosmetics and skincare products . 
 Will traveling be required in this position ? 
 How often ? 
 That's fine . 
 What is over ? 
 Any reasons ? 
 Oh , that ’ s too bad . 
 Well I wanted to go for a picnic but it rained too much . 
 I washed my car instead . 
 No I didn ’ t . I worked in the morning then I played tennis with my husband . 
 I'm doing the business online .

 Hi ! I need to request a wake-up call for tomorrow morning . 
 I need two calls , one at 7 and another at 7 fifteen . 
 Actually , can I change the latter wake-up call to 7 thirty . am ? 
 I can't think of anything . If I do think of something , I'll be sure to call again . 
 Hey , Ray , what are you doing right now ? 
 Yes , I do . I ’ m at home myself right now with nothing much to do . 
 Well , we could go to a movie . Have you see Shrek 2 ? 
 Hmm ... I ’ Ve seen that , too . We could go for a walk in the park . 
 I guess that ’ s out . Why don ’ t we go shopping ? 
 Ok . I guess we ’ d be not do that , either , then . What do you want to do ? 
 I would like to , but I injured my wrist last weekend . 
 That sounds interesting , but I can ’ t drink alcohol with the medicine I ’ m taking . 
 I don ’ t have a car . 
 No . do you have a car ? 
 Oh , good . Why don ’ t you take the bus to mine and we could play Mah Tiang ? 
 Not yet . I ’ ll cook dinner and have it ready by the time you get here . 
 Huh ? We are going to play for money , aren ’ t we ? 
 Hey ... as long as I ’ m not alone on a Saturday night , I don ’ t really care what I do ! 
 Bye ! 
 Yes , sir . How may I be of service ? 
 Certainly . The customer is always right , we are here to serve you . Is there a reason that you would like to return it ? Did you have problems with our product or services ? 
 Would you be interested in an exchange as opposed to a refund ? I think I can help you to find the appropriate size . 
 Sure , no problem . Do you happen to have the receipt ? 
 Ok , just a moment , please . Here you are , I need you to sign here , please . And here is your refund . Is there anything else I can help you with ? 
 You're welcome . Have a nice day ! 
 I want an American breakfast with fried eggs , sunny side up . 
 Grapefruit juice and please make my coffee very strong . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 No , that's all . 
 Just put it on the table , please . 
 No , thanks . Ah , yes ! Can I have some more juice for the minibar ? 
 Tomato , orange and apple juice , please . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 Have you a taste for this kind ? 
 What about this ? 
 I have a lot of them . 
 OK , here you are . 
 Hi , are you being helped ? 
 All our scarves are in this section . What do you think of this one here ? It's made of silk . 
 Maybe you would like a heavy wool scarves . How about this one ? 
 It's 75 dollars plus tax . 
 Since you like it so much , how about a 10 % discount ? That's the best I can offer . 
 Sure . Is there anything else I can get for you ? 
 May I come in ? 
 I'm sorry to trouble you , but I'd like to ask when I will get a raise . 
 You said the same thing three months ago . 
 You mean that I won't get a raise until the recession ends ? 
 I got the message . I'm quiting . 
 I've been here for 3 years , and I haven't had a raise in all that time . If you like my work , it should be reflected in my pay , and I feel it isn't . 
 Very well , consider me gone . 
 I like it a lot . It has a very funny beginning , I think . It attracts your attention the moment you begin reading it . 
 I like the plot . It's so full of twists and turns . I also like the main character . She is so humorous and smart . 
 The ending is a bit weak . It's so abrupt , like those of most other detective stories . 
 You know all about coffee . I need your advice , so I won't look stupid when I order . 
 Come on , Hugh ! Tea is for wimps ! Please , I need your help . 
 Now you're talking . That sounds good . What is it ? 
 Yes . This way please . 
 I recommend our New English Pizza . 
 Okay . Wait a minute please . 
 Sorry , Tom , can you say that last bit again please ? We didn ’ t get that . 
 Sorry Tom , We're having problems hearing you here . It ’ s a bit hissy . Can you hear us ? 
 Hello ? 
 Tom , if you can hear me , I think we ’ Ve lost you . There ’ s a problem with the line . Let ’ s try again . We ’ ll call you . 
 Congratulations ! Is it a boy or a girl ? 
 Good afternoon , Felix Wassermann Associates . Lawson speaking , how can I help you ? 
 B :: Miao Eng ! I'd know that voice anywhere . What can I do for you ? Any problems ? 
 That is good news . 
 Perfect . Thanks very much for calling . See you soon , bye ! 
 Wow ! So many choices you have ! I wish I could , but I just can't . I'm on a diet to lose weight . 
 I'd better not . Please don't tempt me . Please ! 
 You're damn right . I'm not so easily coaxed into doing something that I think is wrong . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Just a second . I'll see if I can find them for you . 
 Here you are . You must return them within a month . 
 You can come in and renew them unless someone else has reserved them . 
 No trouble at all . So long . 
 What a find ! So , how much does it cost ? 
 Ninety dollars is pretty steep . I'll take it for sixty bucks . 
 Eighty-five ? That's the best you can do ? I'll come back later ... 
 The fare is $ 1.25 . 
 I haven't been driving for long — only for a few months . 
 Not in the least bit . 
 I never dreamed of doing this either . The only thing I like about it is the money . 
 It was really nice talking to you too . 
 I'll have a good day once this day is over . 
 It's going to rain . 
 Maintenance Department . May I come in ? 
 Did you call us ? 
 What's the problem ? 
 Let me have a look . I think the batteries should be changed . Let me replace them with new ones . Now , it's working . 
 Is there anything else I can do for you ? 
 If you have any problems , just call us . 
 I need to get on another bus , but I have no more money . 
 I spent it on a bag of chips . 
 You don't have any spare change ? 
 How am I going to get home ? 
 How much does that cost ? 
 Thanks for letting me know . 
 Hello , Mike , long time no see . How's everything going ? 
 He caught a cold yesterday , but he feels much better now . 
 I sure will . Thanks . 
 it's easy ! Just go and get a card . 
 it's ok . It seems we have a lot in common . 
 he is tall and slim , fair-haired . 
 he is a nice guy and very considerate . I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor . 
 I ’ m going to work . 
 I ’ m going to work at the polling place . 
 I work there every year . 
 I applied for the job online . 
 It ’ s a fun job . 
 They pay enough . 
 But I don't think so . No one has ever said a word that you are to die , only yourself . That means you are not willing to die , right ? Actually , you are recovering and what you imagine as your worry is slowing down the treatment . Many cases worse than yours turned out to be hopeful and successful . You must be confident . Your condition is much better physically , but a little bi difficult mentally . The most important thing for you now is cooperation with us . 
 Of course . I am a nurse and a nurse tells the truth . 
 Anything interesting in this city ? 
 It's worth the time . 
 Man , I'm hungry . Do you know a good place to have lunch ? 
 Mexican , Japanese or Chinese would be great . 
 Is it close by ? 
 OK , I'd love the company . 
 Did you punch in ? 
 Really ? It took me really a while to find the color . I am happy you like it . 
 Sure , when those never ending meetings . 
 It's interesting , I like being an editor . 
 I like talking to writers , I get to meet a lot of interesting people . 
 I don't feel bored at all . I'm getting along with my colleagues . I will enjoy working with them . People are great in this industry . 
 No , I have no complaints . I hear there are many opportunities to move up in this company . is that true ? 
 That's perfect . I will definitely do well . 
 Sure.This material is not only washable but also unshrinkable , sun-resistant , crease-resistant , resilient . 
 Yes , you have a good eye for materials . 
 So what ? Are we going anywhere ? 
 Oh , I'm sorry I forgot all about it.Well , can I take a rain check ? 
 I'm terribly sorry , Rose.But I have to finish this paper by tomorrow or professor Martin will kill me . 
 Yes , this is Holiday Inn reservation . 
 Yes.Your name , please ? 
 Autumn . Autumn is the best season in Beijing . 
 Thanks for coming to see me today . 
 I missed you too . 
 I've been really busy . 
 Working . 
 What have you been doing ? 
 Well regardless , I'm very happy that you came to see me . 
 Don't have some relation with him . You know , he is not a kind man . 
 If you attack him , be sure you ’ ll get a Roland for an Oliver . 
 Come to think of it , there is one rule in this house , Mary . 
 When you go out with friends , I don't want you to stay out too late . 
 We maintain a curfew for Cindy because she's just 16 . 
 You can stay out till 10 p . m . 
 Then you call me or Tom first . 
 yeah , I'm glad that we didn't have to wait long . I'm starving ! 
 what would you rather have , samosas or poppadoms ? 
 well , let's get a plate of those then . 
 I think I might have a dahl . 
 it's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice . 
 ok . How about some lamb kebabs ? 
 I think I'll have a beer . 
 I wouldn't recommend it . I think we should wait until she comes round . 
 what would you do without me ? 
 No you don't ! I should treat my new brother-in-law ! 
 OK , OK . On one condition . 
 You come back here with me tomorrow , and it's my treat ! 
 What am I supposed to do with this plastic cup ? 
 How , exactly , does this work ? 
 When I finish , what should I do then ? 
 What is my doctor testing me for ? 
 Will I know the results right away ? 
 Excuse me . Can I open a postal savings account in your office ? 
 Hum .. Can you recommend me one with high interest ? 
 I want the one with the highest interest rate . 
 All right . I'II open this one . 
 Thanks . 
 It's hard to say . But I do love waltz very much . 
 To tell the truth , I don't like it . 
 Oh , it's really beautiful , but I just can't dance it well . 
 OK . I'll have a try . 
 Thank you for your compliment . 
 Excuse me , is this seat taken ? 
 Oh . is it . Thank you anyway . 
 Thank you . 
 I see . It's on top of the hills . 
 I know . It's a major symbol of China . 
 Do we have any choices ? 
 Ah ... let's just climb . It's more fun , I think . 
 Well , that was tough . 
 This looks great . When was it built ? 
 That's remarkable . 
 May I order , please ? 
 I would like sirloin steak and tomato salad . 
 Yes , blue Cheese please . 
 In what ways ? 
 Ha-ha , so you believe in astrology ? 
 Is that so ? I'm afraid it is too narrow-minded to judge people using astrology . It's all stereotypes ! 
 But as far as I remember , you two caught on like a house on fire when you first met . 
 I have puzzled my brain about how to teach the children . 
 My children can never be obedient even if I criticized them severely . 
 Bell Captain . May I help you ? 
 Certainly , sir . How much luggage do you have ? 
 I'll send someone up right away . 
 Of course not , we'd be happy if you could come.What time will you be able to come ? 
 Fine.We ' ll be expecting you . 
 Yes . I've got to cancel my traveling plan . 
 The only thing I can do now is waiting for another chance . 
 Well , I've never heard of a little girl that didn't love Barbie dolls . 
 Here you go — Digital Barbie . 
 Barbie is our best seller . She's only $ 29.95 . 
 Your niece will love this . Anything else ? 
 With the tax , your total is $ 32.42 . Would you like to charge it ? 
 Thank you for shopping here . 
 well , I ’ m very good with people . I ’ m honorable . I work hard . I work well under pressure . And I ’ m patient . 
 I like a person who works hard . I don ’ t like lazy people . 
 well , this is a challenging question . I suppose I would say that I ’ m a quick learner . 
 I think so . I think that I am good at what I do . 
 I ’ m not good at speaking in public . I feel uncomfortable when I speak in public . 
 Hong , I really need to call back to the UK but I can ’ t afford to pay for the roaming charges . 
 Can I do that ? 
 I see . How much will that cost ? 
 Wow , that is cheap . Thank you very much . 
 Yes ? I'll be very glad if I could be of any help to you . 
 Oh , yes . I remember it clearly . Is there anything wrong with it ? 
 Oh , how awful ! Let me have a look , I'm terribly sorry . It was most thoughtless of me . Would you excuse me , please ? 
 It's very kind of you to say so . How about changing another one for you ? 
 Just a minute , please . I won't be long . I'm sure this one is perfect . You may examine it carefully . 
 I'm very sorry for any inconvenience I've caused you . 
 I came to this lab to have my blood drawn . 
 What am I being tested for ? 
 What does my white blood cell count tell him ? 
 How much will it hurt ? 
 Is that my blood going into that tube ? 
 Hello ? Hello ? 
 Hello ? Who is calling , please ? 
 Listen , I know who you are . If you call this number again , I ’ ll call the police . You ’ ll be arrested . I ’ Ve got your number . 
 I have always enjoyed flying . And I am good with people . 
 Yes , I can adjust to anything . 
 I am also calm under pressure and trained in first aid . 
 Thank you . It has always been my dream to be a stewardess . 
 My hair is kind of dry and brittle ... 
 No , it's just perfect . 
 No , really , it feels great . 
 Jason Emory speaking . 
 Yeah . They were just sent over to your office . You should have them in about half an hour . 
 Excuse me , Mr . , Macmillan ? Could you tell me the fax number for Mr . Winthrop ’ s office , please ? 
 Okay – that ’ s 232-2453 , or 232-2456 . 
 Ted is so scared by dogs that he shakes in his shoes whenever he sees one . 
 No wonder . 
 We may go abroad , my wife wants to go to Egypt , and I'd like to go there too . We haven't made up our mind yet . 
 We may travel by sea . It's cheaper . 
 Now the coals are just right . I can start grilling . 
 Thanks . Smell the hickory chips ? They give the meat a nice , smoky flavor . 
 Sorry . This is a one-man job . I've got the grill just how I like it , and I've made up my own special sauce . 
 The boy threw up . 
 Those are today ’ s top stories . Now let ’ s go to John for the weather . John , what does the forecast look like for our weekend travelers ? 
 That ’ s pretty chilly for the summer ! Will it rain on Saturday ? 
 That certainly sounds like a dreary Saturday . 
 Hi , how are you doing ? 
 I'm pretty good . Thanks for asking . 
 I've been great . What about you ? 
 What school do you go to ? 
 Do you like it there ? 
 Good luck with school .

 Did you get laid off ? 
 You may collect unemployment if you are working fewer hours or got laid off . 
 No , some jobs are exempt from paying into unemployment . 
 Your employer can tell you if you have been paying into unemployment and now qualify to collect . 
 It depends on how much you earned . When you file , they will determine the amount . 
 Yes , I found a better house near my office . I ’ m very satisfied with it . But I ’ m worrying . 
 I ’ m worrying about how to move all of my household stuff . You know , I have a lot of stuff . 
 How much dose that cost ? 
 I think it ’ s a little expensive . 
 That ’ s right . 
 Wonderful . 
 Okay , thanks a lot . You did me a great favor just now . 
 What would you reckon the taxing increases ? 
 But what do most people think about it ? 
 Hello Mr Waterstone , what can I do for you today ? 
 Oh , I see . You have two choices here you can either redeem or renew . 
 No problem at all , Mr Waterstone . Any preference as to how you want the money ? 
 Here we go , Mr Waterstone . Here's your money and your interest note . 
 Good coming ! Welcome to J P Interior Design . 
 Yes , we do . Do you have any specific needs ? 
 Do you prefer some specific style ? 
 What kind of color tones do you like ? 
 I see . And what kind of feeling do you want to create for your kitchen ? 
 Fine , we will take an actual look at your kitchen before start working on it . 
 Okay . Would you please leave your address and phone number ? 
 I want to lose some weight ! 
 I have a yoga class tomorrow . Do you want to come with me ? 
 What are you going to do ? 
 Good , I am sure it will work if you can persist . 
 Sounds good ! 
 No , the steak was recommended , but it is not very fresh . 
 So what ? It is not fresh and I'm not happy about it . 
 No , thank you . 
 What's the matter ? 
 Yes , what's wrong ? 
 Today is September 28th , 2007 . 
 When will it begin ? 
 It is half past one . 
 Don't worry , time is enough . 
 What is the telephone number there ? 
 When will you reach there ? 
 What is the customer's name , and what is his room number ? 
 Ok , I'll phone the customer right away.Do you want to pick him up at our office ? 
 How do I take the tablets ? 
 How do I take the sucking lozenges ? 
 How do I take the pills ? 
 Well , thanks very much . 
 I want to buy some flowers for my wife's birthday . 
 What are the roses going for ? 
 That sounds nice and cheap . 
 Okay , give me the roses . 
 No , but thanks anyway . 
 Hello , excuse me ! 
 Yes . I wanna know where I can get on the bus going downtown . 
 Ok , I see . Thank you ! 
 OK , guys . Here's the plan . Get the ball to the goal , and keep it away from Rich and Taylor ! 
 They played ball at school . Here we go . Yi-jun , go out for a pass ! 
 Catch it , Yi-jun ! Run to the ball ! Uh-oh ! Slow down , you're going to hit ... 
 What college are you attending ? 
 Why did you choose to attend that college ? 
 What kind of college is it ? 
 How does the political system work in your country ? 
 Each mp belongs to a political party , right ? 
 What ’ s a cabinet ? 
 Can any mp make a law ? 
 I suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties . 
 How do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ? 
 Hello , Ms . Barkley . How are you ? 
 Good to see you again , too . How ’ s you family ? 
 Could we go over some things , because I think my test score is wrong . 
 Both . 
 Yeah , I'm ready . 
 These look strange . 
 OK , let's do the calculation . 
 I see . 
 Where do you live ? 
 What's your permanent address ? 
 Where is your birthplace ? 
 Where is your domicile ? 
 Give me your telephone number , please . 
 I've been learning to play go recently . It's an amazing game ! 
 At least you have obtained a very basic understanding of the game , haven't you ? I think it is perfect for boosting intelligence , cultivating personality and flexible learning . Every intellectual wishing to gain any insight into Chinese culture should learn to play Go . 
 Sure . It was considered desirable that a well-educated ancient Chinese scholar could be well versed in zither , weigh , calligraphy and painting . I think weigh is the most fantastic of them . It embodies ancient Chinese wisdom and cultural profoundness . 
 Yes . Playing chess is a very aggressive experience . All the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . Whenever I start a chess game , I can't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill . 
 Certainly not . The object of weigh is to surround a larger area than the opponent . In other words , each side is struggling for a greater living space by mapping out a territory on the board . Hence , chess aims to kill , while weigh is most concerned with howso survive . 
 Yes , please . 
 Fine , thank you for coming . Mr . Wu , Please take a seat . I am Anne Smith , the assistant manager . 
 Nice to meet you , too . 
 Yes , but I ’ m afraid it ’ s still a mess . I haven ’ t put anything away yet . 
 Don ’ t say that . It looks like a dump now . I can ’ t stand it . 
 Unfortunately , yes . 
 I took a long walk through the neighborhood this morning on my way to the train station . It took me 20 minutes . 
 I thought paying a lower rent would be better , but now I ’ m not sure . 
 Yes , if you consider 7-11 is a supermarket . 
 That ’ s right , or I ’ m going to spend a lot of time walking . 
 Thanks , Mr . White . That's very kind of you . 
 I am sure it will . It'll be of great help in carrying on the work I have done so far . 
 Excuse me , is this taxi taken ? 
 Would you please drive me to chinatown ? 
 Are you going to vote this Tuesday ? 
 Have you figured out who you ’ re going to vote for ? 
 Why is that ? 
 Is that right ? 
 That ’ s great ! 
 Hopefully , he will be . 
 Excuse me , I am Dunlin . I am here about your advertisement for a tourist guide . Are there still any vacancies ? 
 Oh , I'm so lucky . I want to apply for it . 
 Yes . I have been a guide for two years . 
 I think I will call the office to send someone to meet us , and escort that person to the nearest hospital without interrupting our trip . 
 No . In fact , prior to their boarding the bus and their getting off the bus , I will make an announcement to remind them that they should check their belongings . 
 Thank you . It's my honor . 
 No . What ? 
 No . Really , what happened ? 
 Was he out with the guys from the bank ? 
 Oh , yeah , they always get really drunk . 
 Oh , really . I thought he lived with his wife . 
 Oh , really ? Do you know why ? 
 He lost his wallet and keys . 
 Oh , no . 
 So then what happened ? 
 Well , that's a bit of a tricky situation . 
 Happy birthday , Ms . Lin . Here is a present for you . 
 I hope you like it . 
 I am glad you like it . 
 Well , thank you . 
 Well , I exercise a lot . I go running at least three times a week . But more than that I enjoy playing sports and so different sports use different muscles and all of it helps to lose that weight that you might have gained . 
 Do ya ? 
 It could be and so in that case you might want to eat something perhaps more nutritious or maybe even less of what you do eat . Maybe , I eat three meals a day and I try not to snack in between . No potato chips . No popcorn . No candy bars . 
 Hello , Pineapple Computer Company . This is Janice Shaw , the secretary of Nova . May I ask who is calling ? 
 I feel so sorry that Nova has gone on her business trip . 
 Maybe next weekend . She only mentioned this before she left . 
 Wait a minute . I have to leave a memo here . Anything else ? 
 Dan , don't worry . I will tell her everything as soon as she comes back . 
 Where is your wine list ? 
 Do you have any mixed drinks available here ? 
 I heard that you are famous for your drinks . What are your specials ? 
 I would love a margarita right now ! That is what I am going to order . 
 I prefer my margarita on the rocks , please . 
 No salt , please . 
 I do ! My favorites are Mexican , Thai , and Indian . 
 I can't say that I have . What are the basic ingredients ? 
 Do you know where a Moroccan restaurant is ? 
 Let's go there for lunch ! I'm up for an adventure ! 
 Oh , yes , I am . I have always wanted to go to the States . I love meeting new people . And making new friends . 
 Well , there's one thing . 
 I'm a little worried about my host family . You know , in the agreement I have to do some cooking for them . 
 Yes , she's almost equal to Celine Dion when she sings . 
 You can bet on that . 
 That ’ s what I am here for . What questions can I answer for you ? 
 The best product is Techne , and you can buy either the lotion or cream . 
 The cream form is very popular . 
 You could also take an antihistamine to help the rash go away quicker . 
 Anytime you have a question , please feel free to ask . 
 Yeah , but have you made an appointment ahead ? 
 Just a minute please . I ’ ll make a call to the HR office . Yes , they confirm your appointment . Please come in . it is on the 3rd floor , room 3106 . You can take the right elevator as the left on is in maintenance today . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Well , we are sorry to hear that.May I have your name and room number ? We will deal with the matter right now . 
 Mr . Ted , I have to apologize for that and I assure you it won't happy again . 
 You've drunk everything , sir ? 
 Do you want the whole minibar , or just certain items ? 
 That's three Jim Beams and three Perriers . Anything else , sir ? 
 Okay . Are you sure there isn't anything else ? 
 Be patient for just a few minutes , sir , and someone will be at your door . 
 Er ... Hum ... Got it . 
 Right ! 
 I see what you mean . That was pretty easy after all . 
 No , of course not . Just in case . Nothing to worry about . Don't you also do this in China ? 
 Oh , then it's my honor to be here with you . I can see now why you've been so curious about the bar . You like this place ? 
 Yeah . Other than that , the real feature is the excellent drinks . Can I have your ticket ? 
 Well , with the ticket , you can get a free drink . What would you like ? Orange juice ? 
 I'll show you how . The bar tenders know whose turn it is . And also , I can snap my fingers to catch his attention . 
 Oh , fresh juice , I love it . Well , I heard American people love hanging out in bars . Is that true ? 
 Interesting . Hey , look over there . The dance floor is already packed with people . Oh , the girl in red dances great . 
 Maybe later . I wanna take some photos first . 
 Thank you . 
 Both are superb in their skills.Anyhow , Fred is one up on Bill from my point of view . 
 Excuse me , is this seat taken ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Yes I do . How about you ? 
 You can say that again ! It's much more modern than people imagine . Where are you from ? 
 Uh huh ... 
 How do you do ? 
 Oh , no . It was easy . Your office sent me a map . 
 That ’ s OK . Thank you for seeing me . 
 Thank you . 
 OK . 
 It's January . 
 Forgive me , sir , I haven't been told what the problem is . 
 My apologies , sir . We'll transfer you to a new room at once and give you a full refund . 
 Sir , we never want a guest to stay here mad or unhappy . 
 Yes , we'd have your regular dinner . What courses are there , please ? 
 All right , we'll have it . 
 Do you have some chocolate cakes ? 
 OK , we will choose it . 
 Welcome to the McDonald's . What will it be for you , madam ? 
 Is there anything else ? 
 Is this to go or to eat here ? 
 That comes to four dollars and ten cents . 
 It's on the service counter over there . Please go to help yourself . 
 It was a good thing I had enough on me . 
 I couldn't look at you , and say you aren't beautiful ! 
 No , Miss Anna , you must let me say how lovely you are ! What's wrong with that ? 
 You know that everybody notices how beautiful you are , don't you ? 
 Oh , Miss Anna ! That's too hard ! I won't be here long . 
 no . please sit down . 
 are you also going to Beijing ? 
 I'm taking a vacation to visit a friend there . Have you ever been there before ? 
 really ? What did you think ? 
 was it that crowded ? 
 oh , maybe I can take the bus or even rent a car . 
 thank you very much ! 
 Well , there's this clock I was ... MY vintage clock ! How do you have my clock ? ? 
 Sixty-five ? What the ... ? How did you bargain him down , Wei ? You've never even been to a flea market before ! 
 Never underestimate a woman when it comes to bargaining ! 
 After six months , my college life will come to the end . The following trouble will be the job-hunting . That's really a headache . 
 It sounds reasonable . Maybe I should look on the bright side . 
 I don't know . Who ? 
 the Canadian rock singer ? But I heard you had a part-time job yesterday . How did you see her ? 
 so you're a big fan , eh ? 
 and she was in a movie once again , right ? 
 what was your impression of her when you saw her in person ? 
 did you take a photo with her ? 
 crazy ! 
 Sure . What is it ? 
 You should telephone the garage for help . 
 With pleasure . Get in . 
 How many places have you worked altogether ? 
 Would you tell me the general description of your present job ? 
 What time do you go to work ? 
 What time does the office close ? 
 Does your work involve a lot of paper filling and typing ? 
 What made you decide to change your job ? 
 Are you going out , Jack ? 
 Well , I ’ m glad I had a chance to see these samples , but I ’ m really not in a position to make a decision right now . 
 Yeah , why don ’ t you do that , and then you can give me a call sometime next week . 
 I really just have two problems with this . 
 I ’ m concerned about your lack of marketing experience and , frankly , your age , you ’ re pretty new at all this . 
 It's terrible how things have changed . You remember there used to be trees on all these hills . 
 No , they've all been cut down and now all the soil is washing away . 
 Yes , I can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds . But nowadays you just don't see the birds that you used to see around here . 
 Do we need to put on the jackets too ? 
 Thank you . Is the production line fully automated ? 
 I see . How do you control the quality ? 
 What ’ s the monthly output ? 
 What ’ s your usual percentage of rejects ? 
 That ’ s wonderful . Is that where the finished products come off ? 
 If ever you ’ re in Chicago , please do look me up . 
 No trouble at all . I think maybe you will meet some of my friends here as well . 
 How's the building work going ? 
 What's the problem ? We really can't have any delays at this stage . We're working to a really tight schedule and we're already over budget . 
 OK . Keep me informed . Jt must be ready on time . 
 Joe ? I don't know what you mean . 
 Oh , I took a shine to him when we met for the first time . But it comes and goes . 
 Welcome to our restaurant , Chez Attitude ! 
 Yes , Mr . Foster , our hostess will be with you in just a moment . 
 I will let her know where you are . 
 I could seat you right away at an outside table if you would like . 
 Well , can I start you off with some cocktails while you are looking over the menu ? 
 I'll get on that right away ! 
 What do you need me to do ? 
 Sure . How many copies do you need ? 
 Fill it up , please . 
 No , thank you . I don't have time . How much is that ? 
 Hi Benjamin . My name is Dr . Green . What seems to be the matter ? 
 what are your symptoms ? 
 it sounds like you might be a bit dehydrated . Do you feel thirsty most of the day ? 
 have you been drinking plenty of water ? 
 ok . Well , we'll have a nurse take some blood in a few minutes to see if you're dehydrated . First , let me feel your pulse . 
 is anyone else sick in your home ? 
 I see . I'll have the lab techs run some tests to check for mono as well then . The burse will come in then to take your blood , we'll run some tests , and then you can go home . You should hear from us 
 Excuse me . Do you have the time ? 
 Is it ? Oh , no . The concert will begin in twenty minutes . Are we too late to get there ? 
 That dog has white long hair . It ’ s lovely . 
 What ’ s her name ? 
 My dog has spots . He is very strong . 
 Is this your umbrella , miss ? 
 You look a bit familiar to me . I wonder if I have seen you somewhere before . 
 May I ask where you live ? 
 That ’ s it . I live there , too . I live on the sixth floor . 
 It ’ s a small world ! May I know your name , miss ? 
 How do you do , Miss Chen ? I ’ m Song Mei . 
 Are you going to your office now , Miss Chen ? 
 Excuse me . 
 I just checked in , and there's a problem with my room . 
 I asked for a non-smoking room , and I don't have one.My room smells like cigarette smoke . I can't stand it.Could you change my room , please ? 
 Thank you . 
 That's OK . Thanks for your help . 
 Yes , just follow the porter , Mr.Wilson . 
 Hello , Bessie . 
 My birthday ? I forgot it , Thank you for remembering my birthday . 
 Thanks a lot . I'm so touched . 
 Thank you very much . 
 Yes . What about you ? 
 Really ? 
 Voting is simple . 
 That ’ s okay . They describe everything on the ballot . 
 Don ’ t worry . You ’ ll be fine . 
 Congratulations on your first voting day . 
 I stayed up all night writing a report . 
 Will you give me a hand , sir ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 What are you reading ? 
 Aha , Fitness Consultant . Very good , Don't you know about the rules in this office ? 
 Well , don't do this again next time . What is it about , anyway ? 
 What kind of sports ? 
 Interesting . What were you reading just now ? 
 Really ? That sounds interesting ! 
 No . It's confiscated for now . And I will return it to you after I finish reading it . 
 Yes , I would like to use the ATM to make a payment . But I need to pay 3 parties at once . 
 They are , yes . How should I do this ? 
 Yes , I've got that here ... 
 Waiter , please make out the bill . 
 Quite delicious , especially the pepper steak . 
 Here is the money . 
 I may have something on that day , but thanks for inviting me . 
 I will , do you want me to bring anything ? 
 Is this where I can catch a bus to the theater ? 
 Which bus do I have to change ? 
 I see . Thank you . 
 Good morning . How can I help you ? 
 Very well . 
 About five years . 
 There is my wife who does the accounts and my brother who helps with the sales . 
 Yes , we are a small family business . 
 That depends on the day . We sell from here and on the Internet . I would say about twenty to thirty per week . 
 That's correct . 
 Thank you and goodbye . 
 We export some coal to European countries , but our biggest exports is copper , which we export to Europe , north America , and China . 
 We import a little oil from Venezuela , but we are fairly self-sufficient . We import some iron and a lot of aluminium from neighbouring countries . 
 Yes , that ’ s right . So far , only small deposits have been found . Engineers in my country are focusing on drilling for oil . The government is keen to exploit our natural resources to get money to improve our country . 
 Yes . We need to put the money into long-term projects rather than wasting it on short-term ones . 
 I agree , Toni . I think the biggest problem we ’ re facing is how to bring it in under budget . 
 Right . Look , why don ’ t we make a list of the problems we ’ re dealing with . It ’ ll be easier to work through them that way . 
 Yes . 
 Hi , Helen ! how is it going ? 
 Well , take it easy ! Don't let it get on top of you . 
 Why don't you take a few days off ? 
 May I help you ? 
 I can assist you . 
 I actually work here . 
 Do you have ID ? 
 Here ’ s your ballot card . 
 Just take it to a booth and begin voting . 
 Let me ask some questions . Do you know what people need to get entry into China ? 
 What materials do they need in order to apply the passport ? 
 Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do ! 
 I think someone is stalking me . 
 I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . 
 I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too . 
 Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me . 
 Can you believe that Obama was actually elected ? 
 I hope you voted for him . 
 Of course ! 
 You do ? 
 Our country really could use some work . 
 I couldn ’ t agree more . 
 Could you do me a favour ? Please give me some confidential information . 
 It looks like it's going to be sunny . 
 They say we're going to get some rain later . 
 I can drink ten cups in fifteen minutes . I ’ m sure . 
 Did you take the job ? 
 Why not ? 
 Tomorrow I will be the new owner of all dad's assets . 
 I know . I miss him terribly . 
 I thought I would feel like I was in the lap of Luxury . 
 No , I think I will run things much the same way that Dad did . 
 Bob is really handsome . 
 I wish I were just as handsome . 
 Can you help me for a minute ? 
 I'm try to write a letter to one of our clients , But I just don't know exactly what to say , I don't even know how to get started , I know I should write dear Mr . Mrs . or Ms . , but the problem is I don't know the name of contact person . 
 OK , So I first thanks them for their business , I can say something like we are very grateful for your continue support , How is that ? 
 Like Regarding our new product line , we would like to announce a special price discount 
 Yes , the letter would have a survey inside , and they should complete it and return to our office . How should I write that ? 
 May I sit here ? 
 Our current apartment is valued at RIB 700,000 . We can sell it and put that money towards buying the new apartment . 
 And we can take out a loan to pay the rest . 
 Uh huh ... but we're going to have to cut back on our shopping from now on . 
 I think that it ’ s absolutely gorgeous . 
 I think that the apartment looks very nice , but I do see some problems . 
 I did notice a few stains in the carpet . 
 You will ? 
 That was the only thing that I saw that was wrong with the apartment . 
 It is . I love it . 
 What are you getting ? 
 Don ’ t forget to also get a new mixer . I lent the old one to my brother and he broke it . 
 I ’ m actually thinking of completely refurnishing the kitchen and getting a new stove , oven , dishwasher and trash compacter . 
 I have to check out today . I'd like my bill ready by 10 this morning . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , I have . 
 Medicine . In my country , that certainly has great prestige . 
 Oh.history . 
 Well , doctors are such an important job . I mean your health is the most imponent thing you've got , isn't it ? I want to be important and help people . 
 I'd like to try the chef's special . 
 I am on a diet . Do you have a vegetarian menu ? 
 Oh . I see . I would like to have mashed potatoes and chocolate pudding . 
 I like all kinds of stuff . I admit I love romance . 
 You mean my favorite movie of all time ? I guess I ’ d have to say pretty woman . 
 So , Emily , how was your day ? 
 It can't have been that bad . Go on and tell me about it . 
 Why ? What happened ? 
 That's not very fair . What did you do ? 
 Does he treat everyone in your department like this ? 
 Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others ? 
 Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at your company ? 
 That's very sensible . It sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders . 
 That's so true . When you have a taste for success , you can't let dishonest people like your manager get in the way . 
 Where do I go to pick up my ballot ? 
 How ’ s that ? 
 That ’ s wonderful . Thank you . 
 Here you go . 
 What am I supposed to do now ? 
 Okay . Wish me luck . 
 Yes . I urgently need a room for tomorrow night , and do you have any vacancies ? 
 I'd like a suite with an ocean view , please . 
 What is the price of the suite ? 
 It is a little high . I'm told that your hotel is offering discount now . 
 Oh , I see . Then do you have anything less expensive ? 
 OK , I will take it . By the way , does the price include breakfast ? 
 My name is David White . 
 That is D-A-V-I-D , W-H-I-T-E . 
 About three days . 
 Thank you . See you . 
 I agree . And it's very convenient . 
 Really ? That's great ! I'm going to try that next time . 
 Happy Mother ’ s Day , Mom ! 
 Of course I should have ! You certainly deserve them ! You put up with all of us . 
 Sorry sir . But you can ’ t go into the OR . 
 It was touching girl for a while . 
 She will be OK . She is a tough cookie . 
 In my opinion she will up about soon . 
 I believe it . Well , I ’ Ve got to go back in . 
 All right . Just relax , OK ? Go and got a cup of coffee . 
 Oh , come on , Ultraman ! 
 It says that there will be a blackout from 5 p . m . to 7 p . m . in our neighborhood today . 
 Don't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout ? 
 That's not the point . Come on , can you imagine that there will be no electricity on such a hot day ? 
 OK , since you are the smart one , can you come up with a better plan ? So that we won't be baked like cookies here . 
 Barbie ? You know , I might be seven , but I'm not a girl . 
 All right , all right . 
 Personally , I'm not for it . I feel it's bad for kids to watch . 
 If you ask me , I have to disagree . Something shouldn't be watched for fun . 
 First of all , we need to understand what I was looking for . Do you know what the purpose of an inspection is ? 
 I went there to check for problems with the home , so you aren ’ t surprised when you move in . 
 Sellers aren ’ t always truthful , and there might also be problems that they aren ’ t aware of . 
 You can make the sale of the house contingent on them fixing the problems . 
 There were no major problems . One leaky pipe under the sink and two broken roof tiles was all that I found . 
 You have taken words out of my mouth . He is a tough customer . 
 What shall we do when we find a shortage in the shipment ? 
 Shall we leave it to the brokers ? 
 Do they charge for that ? 
 Is it the same in America ? 
 It's part of their service , isn't it ? 
 Is it enough to claim with an on board bill of lading ? 
 I see . By the way , how do we prove the ownership of our goods ? 
 I see . Thank you . 
 Betty , something is burning . Can you smell it ? 
 Look ! The iron is still on . 
 Look at my nice blue shirt , there ’ s a big hole in it . 
 Never mind , dear . 
 Yes . I ’ m interested in a job your company posted on the Internet . 
 It is a position in your Maintenance Department . Is it available ? 
 I have no experience but I ’ m interested in it . 
 I don ’ t have my resume with me , but I will send you a copy immediately . Can I fill out the application form right now ? 
 Thanks . 
 Those are the headlines for today , and now for the international weather report with Mike Sanderson . 
 Not a great week for the world ! Any good news ? 
 Hey . I'm a visitor from China . I love your music . It's the best I've ever heard . Will you please spare a little bit of time for me ? 
 Oh , you wrote them all by yourself . That's amazing ! Are you a regular singer here ? 
 Cool . Your guitar skills are very impressive . How did you learn to play like that ? 
 Wow , that's unbelievable ! You play so well , but you've never been to a real teacher . You will definitely be famous in the near future . 
 Well , she ’ s tall and pretty . 
 I suppose so . We ’ re both friendly and easy-going . 
 No , she ’ s not as clever as me . 
 What's the price ? I hope you'll quote us favorably . 
 Frankly speaking , the price you offer is too high . We can't accept it . 
 It certainly is . 
 I look at it this way , suppliers should be able to reduce their CIF price , even lower than their home price . 
 That's the point . Your overhead is in your domestic price , but it can't be carried in the CIF price . 
 I wish you could make a reconsideration . If you don't reduce your price , we won't purchase from you any more because there's plenty of other business offering here . 
 Well , I had a blood test last week . The doctor said that I have high blood pressure and my blood is thick and sticky . I'm very worried . 
 I have to admit it's easier said than done . 
 But you know I'm just not into exercises . And I wouldn't have time for exercises , either . 
 Actually , my doctor said the same thing . 
 Yes . May I help you ? 
 Just a minute . I'll check if there is any availability . I'm sorry , sir . There isn't any table left for 7:00 , but we can give you one at 8: 00 . Would you like to make a reservation at that time ? 
 Usually , the restaurant will be quieter at that time . 
 Very good , sir . A table for 6 at 8: 00 this evening . May I have your name , please ? 
 Thank you very much . Bye . 
 what about taking her for a dinner or a movie ? 
 well , there is a play on campus this weekend . 
 what's the matter with these ideas ? 
 what about going on a picnic ? 
 you can also take her to the art museum or a cafe . Certainly , i must come up with something you can use . how do you like the ideas i am giving you ? 
 Why are you in such a hurry ? 
 Don't worry , do it step by step 
 Don't worry , do it step by step . 
 Room service.May I come in ? 
 Here is your laundry . I am sorry to tell you that one of your clothes has shrunk due to our fault . 
 We are terribly sorry for that.Could you please buy a new one and give us the receipt ? We will refund the cost of the laundry and the new sweater . 
 Would you please fill out the form ? 
 No , we used to be on an industrial estate on the outskirts of York . 
 We needed larger premises so we moved to this greenfield site last year . It's nearer the motorway so it's better for transportation . 
 And he ’ s always busy with his pictures and roses . 
 But as for his business in the city ... 
 He sounds more like an artist than a businessman . 
 I'd like to book a table tonight . 
 Eight . 
 Eight o'clock tonight , would you please set us in a private room ? 
 Maybe not , thank you all the same then . 
 I know what you mean . I fit into my clothes , but I'm not always comfortable . 
 What do you have in mind ? 
 I know the one you mean . Do you know how much the memberships are ? 
 Let's go after work and take a tour of the facilities . 
 Hi , Sterling ! 
 Professor Wood ? I think he's a brilliant scientist . 
 I guess so . 
 Please show me the menu again . 
 No , thanks . I don't like chocolate . I'd like strawberry pie . 
 Then I'll have vanilla ice cream . 
 Hello . 
 No , I was just about to get up . What's up , Carl ? 
 B as in boy . You should get off at the last stop in Chinatown . 
 That's the wrong direction . Canal Street is on the other side of Chinatown . 
 At 10,45 . Is Ann coming along ? 
 See you around , Carl . 
 Hello , Green here . 
 Oh , yes . 
 I'll be please to if I can . What can I do for you ? 
 Yes , I think I can help you . Why not you come around and see me ? Do you know my office ? 
 Good , where are you now ? 
 oh , well , that's just a few minutes walk to my office , come around and see me now . 
 Not at all . 
 But it's so thin . There's no way that it comes with a CD-ROM . 
 What other features are listed ? 
 Totally cool colors ! 
 I'll have sole , then . 
 The rest of us will have this today's special , please . 
 I'm sorry but I ordered sole , not the same as the others.Will you change it ? 
 Then , I'll have this pork cute instead . 
 Balista , pull me a ristretto . 
 It's basically a very strong espresso . Half the water pulled through the same amount of beans . Pure coffee essence . 
 You fiend . It's about the flavor , not the fix . Why don't you just crush some caffeine pills and start doing lines ? 
 Just okay . 
 Good idea . 
 No , I can ’ t accept it . Business is business . 
 I'm looking forward to going to America . 
 Next week . 
 At 16:35 , from platform 8 . 
 No , you have to change trains at Birmingham . 
 Single or return , sir ? 
 64 pounds , please . 
 Here's your ticket and change , sir . 
 Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me ! 
 Hey , listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in.You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out.And anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes.All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me . 
 Sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed . And I'm lucky to be alive too . 
 Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried . 
 Alright . 
 Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital . 
 Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time . 
 Yes , maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ? 
 I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ? 
 Last night I looked for my Indian classmate Barbara . I found her sitting with her legs crossed and quietly practicing . 
 Mary , you say something about it . 
 Plastic bags are widely used nowadays . 
 In this aspect , I think , Pater bags have the edge on plastic bags . 
 Fine , just fine.How about you ? 
 Do you want an IBM-compatible PC or a Macintosh ? 
 Well , what do you plan to use your computer for ? 
 Then a PC should be enough . Macintoshes are better for graphics , but they also cost a bit more . 
 I've prepared some L / C documents , all in accordance with the conditions . There shouldn't be any problems ; I've done about a million of these things recently . 
 Thanks very much . I'm sure I'll be back , so see you again soon . Bye ! 
 Oh . Yes ? 
 Yes , there are some on Pine Street . 
 Well , I think there's one across from the shopping center . 
 By the way , there's a barber shop in the shopping center , too . 
 Mom , I want to get a motorcycle . Is that all right with you ? 
 Mom ! I'll wear a helmet and I'll drive sane . I promise . 
 What's that ? 
 And after that ? 
 Hello , Mrs . Taylor . I'm here to pick up Diane . 
 I think I may rent this apartment from you . 
 How much are you looking to rent it for ? 
 That is too expensive . 
 How does $ 850 a month sound to you ? 
 That ’ s the best that I can do . 
 Would you please reconsider ? 
 This facility is great , don't you think ? 
 I'm glad our booth is on the first floor . More people can see our display . 
 Let me see that . I didn't get one when I came in . 
 No . 
 Where do you go for lunch around here ? 
 Not too bad . But I will be soon . 
 I can't see Cortex on this floor plan . Don't they have a booth here ? 
 Oh , that will be uncomfortable for them . 
 Yes . Cortex just stole Darren McDowell from Rolly.And probably Darren will be here.So he will have to spend the whole show standing next to his old Cortex coworkers . 
 When you reserve a booth , you should check who your neighbors will be.Don ' t you think ? 
 Yes . Well , I think I'll go get lunch . Will you join me ? 
 Maybe . I will look around . 
 I don ’ t know . What do you think ? 
 What do natives get ? 
 Do you mean that a native doesn ’ t make any mistakes in grammar ? 
 I suppose that only a small percentage of college students don ’ t know standard English in American universities . 
 Ten sheets of rice paper , 25 brushes , two boxes of oil color and two boxes of water color . All these come up to $ 35.50 , sir . 
 Sure , just a minute . Are you an artist , sir ? 
 That must be a very interesting job . 
 Do you ? Nice to meet you ! And here is the invoice and your change . 
 Have you been registered yet , sir ? 
 Are you a medical or surgical case ? 
 Do you have your medical history sheet with you ? 
 Please fill in this admission card . Well , how long do you expect to stay in the hospital ? 
 But there're no beds available now . Two patients will be discharged this afternoon , so you'll have to wait until then . 
 Certainly . See you in the afternoon . 
 Yes . I've read it carefully . 
 No . But the contract stipulates that I will teach 22 hours a week.Will you have thatmany classes for me right away ? 
 But my salary will be 1100 dollars a month.Will you pay me that much for the first month ? Because , I mean , I won't be working so many hours . 
 Oh , so I don't sign the contract today . Is that right ? 
 I can accept that . 
 Even my health insurance ? 
 I have a few questions about the free membership . 
 Is my membership the same as paying club members ? I mean , can I get discounts at club hotels ? 
 What are bar vouchers ? 
 But according to the contract , employees get a discount in the restaurant . 
 So , for now , you want me to keep a copy of the contract.But we won't sign it yet . That right ? 
 I understand.And according to the terms on the contract , I am happy to accept this job . I look forward to it . 
 Good morning , I am here for my interview . 
 No problem . 
 Unfortunately , our company is shutting down due to the economy . 
 I am probably best at researching for marketing purposes . 
 I tend to get bored easily and so love to keep myself challenged . 
 Wow , the view from the peak is so grand ! 
 Did you ever see this kind of beautiful scene ? 
 But my father did not . He didn't have much time . 
 Really ? It's a deal . Have you ever been there ? 
 It really gets me interested . Is it higher than Kiang Shan ? 
 Can I see the rainbow ? 
 We have the capital ready.Right now I am looking at three different companies to produce our products.And your company , Mr . Chen , seems to me to be the best for what we want . 
 You have some doubts about our products , I understand . 
 Of course . Let me tell you in some detail about our idea.You know the popular Hello Kitty products . 
 Well , the products in themselves are very simple.It is the logo that is successful.So , Hello Kitty is successful because of the logo , but the products are very simple . 
 That might be true.But we have a logo concept that is great . It is really great . I think it will catch on in Taiwan at least . Young people will love it.It is because of our logo that our products will sell.We just need someone to produce the products for us.We have the backup and people to do the marketing . 
 Yes , we would like to make things like key chains , plastic pencil sharpeners , plastic rulers , watches , wallets , things like that.Little accessories for young people . But the reason these will sell is the logo.Just like Hello Kitty . 
 Because it hasn't been copyrighted . We want to get some protection for it.But while we wait for copyright , we are investigating companies to produce the products . 
 I understand . For now , though , you could just give us an estimated price.We aren't going to sign a contract yet . We are just investigating . I only need to know that your company is capable of producing the products.And then , I only need a very rough idea of how much it might cost . 
 Yes . 
 No . What is that street charming for ? 
 You look really nice today . 
 Really , where did you get it ? 
 It's really nice . 
 Thank you . I just got these shoes today . 
 These are called All Star Chuck Taylors . 
 They were about forty dollars . 
 I would like to ask for one day off next week . Do you think the manager will agree ? I know it is the busy time for our company , but I do have some important things to handle . 
 Actually , it is my mother ’ s wedding . My parents divorced many years ago . Now she is ready to establish a new family . It is a special occasion . I ’ Ve got to be there , right ? 
 Thank you so much . 
 A really dreadful accident and many people were killed . 
 Yeah , well , I fill you in one the details later . 
 Somebody , please answer the phone . 
 Waitress ! My bill for today's lunch , please . 
 How much do I owe ? 
 Here is 200 yuan . The charge is for you . 
 Goodbye . 
 Yes , I have , sir . How long are you going on vacation ? 
 I recommend you this route . We call it golden routes for the sightseeing spots . 
 Of course , we will , sir . 
 What are you waiting for ? Rip ‘ em open ! 
 It's nice , but how much did you end up paying ? 
 Hmm ... not so hot . They sell them here for about that . 
 Oh , that hurts . 
 What day is today ? Tuesday ? 
 I bet it's May 5th . 
 To the right . 
 Looks good . 
 No , thanks . 
 Thank you . 
 Well , I just came in . I worked overtime yesterday . Some statistics and very important documents seemed to be inaccurate . So I stayed to double check them . The boss was aware of my very late work of last night . So before he left office , he told me I could come one hour later this morning . 
 It was around 1 thirty in the morning . I guess I didn ’ t fall asleep till 3 because those numbers were involving in my mind . I just couldn ’ t stop thinking about them . 
 Working at weekend is something I hate to do most . 
 Is there anything worth watching on another channel ? 
 Do you mind if we watch it . I ’ d really like to see it . 
 Football game ? Ok , and you know what comes on next ? 
 Are you interested in watching it ? 
 Oh , I am sorry . What's on Channel 2 at 10 pm ? 
 Do you want to watch it ? 
 Jim ? Jim ? ... What are you doing in the kitchen ? 
 Milk ? I thought you didn't like milk . 
 Nonsense . There's lots of food in the refrigerator ... What's behind your back ? 
 What are you hiding behind your back ? Let me see . 
 OK , I promise . What is it ? 
 Oh , Jim . I told you . No pets . It'll make a mess of this house . 
 No way . It might belong to somebody else . You can't keep it here . 
 All right . But you have to clean up everything it messes up . 
 I take care of the letters . I may read , sort out and organize incoming mails . 
 Yes , except the personal mail . And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly . 
 Yes , and I check all the e-mails for Mr . Thomas . 
 So you have to open all the envelopes . 
 Do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ? 
 Hi , Betty ! Where's your boyfriend ? 
 Who's the champion in this picture ? 
 He's very handsome , I think . 
 Don ’ t worry . Everyone knows you ’ re getting your feet wet . I ’ ll show you how . I bet you ’ ll be proficient at this in five minutes . 
 Relax . I can hold my own . Now , point your skis toward the bottom of the hill . Easy does it ! 
 Here . I ’ ll just give you a little push ... 
 There . Now , wasn ’ t that fun ? As soon as you get a second burst of energy , we ’ ll ... 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 All right . How much do you need ? 
 One thousand U . S . Mm hmm . And are you going to pay cash ? 
 All right . Now can I have your passbook ? 
 Thank you . And what amounts do you want the checks in ? 
 Operator . May I help you ? 
 Just dial 0 , wait for the dial tone , and then dial the phone number you want to call . Or we can place a call for you , if you want . 
 How much do you pay wholesale for your products ? 
 That must impact your bottom line at least a little bit , doesn't it ? After all , your sticker price is pretty much set in stone . How much do they go for retail ? 
 Is that including tax ? 
 How much is your profit margin then ? 
 My friend George has been to Switzerland twice . 
 Yes , he likes the people and the quietness there . 
 Who's it for ? 
 Hey Mike . I forgot about registration . I'm a day late , so all the classes are mostly full . What do you think I should do ? 
 Do you think going to the registration building will help at all ? 
 Did you register yet ? 
 What classes do you think are still open ? 
 That's helpful . Thanks . But what do you think about philosophy . I wanted to take that class this semester . 
 He does that ? 
 That makes sense . I think I'll do that . Thanks for all the help . 
 Hey , Susan . Have you got a sec ? I have some questions about my paycheck . 
 Well , this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand . First of all , what is this FICA , and SUI Y tax , and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan ? 
 Then here we have a series of deductions . First off are the federal ones . FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act , or something like that . It's your federal income tax . And then there's Social Security and Medicare , which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work . 
 That's right . Below the federal deductions are the state deductions . There's the state income tax , and then this SUI / SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up , but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take . 
 That's right . Not all states have an income tax . Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead . 
 No problem ! All those deductions do add up , and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like . I can understand why you'd want some explanation . 
 Good afternoon , you look a little stuck . Can I help ? 
 I see . What is it exactly that you are interested in ? 
 Well , that all depends on how much you want to invest . 
 That's a nice round figure to deal with ! OK , if you were to buy this insurance policy , your yearly fixed income from it would be 94.35 RIB . 
 For the Savings Deposit you could actually get more . You see , in time deposit , the interest rate is 1.58 % after the 20 % interest tax . So , technically you could get more than a third more . 
 Guess what , Gilly ? I won both bids . 
 Yeah . It was so easy and super-fast , once I figured it out . 
 I should get the items within a week . But in the meantime I'm bidding on a digital video camera . 
 Thirty U . S . dollars ... and it's only been used for six months . 
 We are looking for a bilingual secretary . Do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken English ? 
 How are your typing and shorthand skills ? 
 Excuse me , but are you Mr . Smith from Britain ? 
 I'm from Textile Import and Export Corporation . I've come to meet you . My name is Zhang Yong . 
 How do you do , Mr . Smith ? Let me help you with your luggage . 
 Did you have a good trip ? 
 Anyhow , it's a long way to China , isn't it ? And I think you must be very tired . 
 I wish you a pleasant stay here . 
 Now , Mr . Smith , if all is ready , we'd better start for the hotel . 
 This way , please . Our car is waiting over there .

 That is fine . 
 Tell me what the problem is . 
 What was the charge for ? 
 Are you sure that you didn't make that purchase ? 
 I apologize . What day was this purchase made ? 
 All right , we'll do an investigation .

 I will never go out with him anymore . 
 last time when we had dinner at the Smith's , it was a horrible experience . He had no manners at all ! 
 he made a lot of noises while eating . He talked with his mouth full and sipped loudly . 
 it is true . Everyone kept looking at him . It was so embarrassing as I was sitting right next to him . 
 I have no idea . He seemed to enjoy the dinner very much . 
 oh , he really should . 
 Have you tried the Internet ? 
 Wow , you really live in the Stone Age , Mom . 
 Go to yahoo.com and click on “ Travel ” and “ Tickets . ” They ’ ll be about a billion sites to look at .

 Never ? Really ? I'm surprised . 
 But there are a lot of Kts in this town . There's one just two blocks from here .

 Criminals are clever ? They ’ re only successful when people are careless . 
 If your uncle had an alarm system , then it wouldn ’ t have happened .

 Oh , right . Now I know why they would want to see our boy . It ’ s hard to imagine the wonder ! Are they expecting a boy or a girl ? 
 Oh ! You mean she doesn ’ t have to work now ? It ’ s hard for young parents not to overreact , isn ’ t it ?

 Let me see . That ’ s no problem . I ’ ll see you then . 
 There are several interesting articles on recent scientific breakthroughs . I just finished reading one about cloning . 
 According to the article , you have no real need to worry . Research nowadays is focussing on cloning parts of a human body to replace damaged or lost parts , not on recreating a whole human . 
 In this article , scientists say that if you took the genes from someone and tried to create a copy of a person , there ’ s no guarantee that the copy would look or act like the original ! 
 I read about how scientists are using material from plants and animals to create new medicines . For example , an animal be immune to disease that affects human . So , scientists find out why it ’ s immune

 they must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood . 
 I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars . 
 I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but I don't think he won anything . 
 yes , his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous . 
 people in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated .

 being famous , I can do without , but I wouldn't mind being rich . 
 Oh . it ‘ s a case flowers . It ’ s very kind of you . 
 I love flowers you know . Thank you very much .

 But the reservation keeps the car here . That ’ s why you have the reservation . 
 I don ’ t think you do.If you did , I ’ d have a car.See , you know how to take the reservation , you just don ’ t know how to hold the reservation and that ’ s really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . Anybody can just take them .

 Let me check - - oh , here it is . It just arrived a few minutes ago .

 Two boxes of transparencies for the over-head machines . 
 All right , Mr . Jones . Do you think we ’ ll need anything else ? 
 Yes , I was there as an English teacher . 
 Sure . I was fond of those lovely children 
 The school is a little bit too far away . I simply want to take good care of my elderly grandfather . 
 I think it's better for me to meet new challenges in life . 
 And I can experience another kind of life style . 
 I hope I can adapt to the new job as soon as possible . 
 No , I've only washed my whites . 
 Sure . Is there any extra care that I should take with your clothes ? 
 How many clothes of yours do you want me to wash ? 
 It's really only a small load . 
 Not at all . It's no problem . 
 It's no trouble at all . 
 Well done , Fred . Do you know something useful for our promotion for our I-series ? 
 That is a good idea to start with . I also think the mass media is also a good approach for advertising . 
 Is that you , Dave ? Oh , my gosh ! The backstabber who left us to work for the evil WebTracker ! 
 I'm filthy rich ! Haven't you heard about the MicroPower deal ? 
 That's right . For seventy-five million . So how are you ? 
 What would you say if I told you I was going to quit school ? 
 I don't know . I failed my exam . 
 A B plus . 
 But I should have aced it . I mean I finished the paper so quickly , thinking it's a piece of cake . But when I knew my result , I was like what ? That can't be true ! 
 No , I don't . I just don't know how to handle this . This is my first time , you know . 
 What ? 
 How ? 
 Thanks . But I really don't feel like watching movies tonight . I have to get an early start in the morning . 
 I guess that's what I need . Thanks . You're being a really good friend . 
 Thanks , bye .

 I'm going to miss you folks , too . 
 OK . I'll drop you a line as soon as I get there . 
 Huh ? 
 Okay , mom . 
 It will be hard at first , but I think I can do it . 
 I will do my best . 
 Hello , Jason . Are you free this Saturday evening ? 
 Would you like to Come to our barbecue ? 
 OK . See you then . 
 Hey ! I didn't know that ! When did you become a vegetarian ? 
 Relly ? That's amazing . 
 Are you kidding ? I really don't think that you think less clearly on non-vegetarian diet . 
 Maybe I'll also have a try some day , but I'm afraid that it would be difficult for me to refuse meat . 
 We'll see . Anyway , I'll prepare some vegetarian food for the barbecue . See you then ! 
 Have you been having these headaches for a long time ? 
 Have you been under a lot of stress lately ? 
 Have you been getting enough sleep lately ? 
 Have you had any head injuries lately ? 
 I am going to send you for a CT scan , and I will see you again when we see the results . 
 I graduated from Peking University . 
 I studied economics , I am especially interested in the economic development of China . 
 I like Business Management , and i think it's very useful for the present work . 
 I've taken courses on office administration , reports and correspondence writing . I think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager , because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork . 
 Yes ... I wouldn ’ t recommend it . 
 Granted , it ’ s cheap , but the place is filthy , the beds are uncomfortable , there ’ s no A / C , the breakfast is pretty skimpy ... and the staff couldn ’ t care less about the guests . 
 Just one night , when my flight was canceled due to bad weather . It ’ s bearable if you just need a place to crash , but you definitely don ’ t want to book a vacation there . Unless you enjoy sharing your room with cockroaches . 
 Say , Jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ? 
 What do you mean ? It will help us to relax . 
 I guess you are right . But what shall we do ? I don't feel like sitting at home . 
 That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play singsong . Perhaps we can make a foursome with them . 
 Good . Let's go now . 
 Hi , Alan . I feel very nervous because I am going to have a job interview next Monday . Could you please give me some suggestions ? 
 Yeah , that is very important . 
 I will try my best to make a good impression , but it is always easier said that done . 
 Can I wear T-shirt and jeans for the job interview ? 
 I've got it . I think I will wear a white shirt with a tie . Thank you for your suggestions . 
 Which function do you use more , making calls or sending short messages ? 
 Then I recommend this package to you . You can receive all the calls free by paying just 10 yuan a month . 
 Sending a message ' KTCTWY ' to 10086 will do . 
 You're welcome . 
 I had it right here a minute ago , Mr . Emory . Umm . Just a minute ... 
 Yes , sir . I apologize for that . Here ’ s the file you were looking for , Mr . Emory . 
 I'd like to have it in big waves . 
 Where can I get the information , Kate ? 
 Why ? 
 What's the matter with you , Mary ? You look a bit pale . 
 Have you taken any medicine ? 
 Well , if I were you , I'd go to see the doctor . That might help . And you'd better stay in bed today instead of going to work . 
 Thank you . And here's your receipt , sir . 
 I hope your stay here was satisfactory , sir . 
 I'm glad that the little problem didn't ruin your visit . Please have a pleasant trip home . 
 Oh ... I bet the firm is fuming . Do they know who spilled the beans ? 
 What kind of repercussions will there be for the people who are held responsible ? 
 Why would the person who told have problems with the law ? 
 I didn't think about that . That's pretty serious . Are there investigators working on finding out who it was ? 
 What are the good sights to see in Beijing ? 
 I am not certain , but I think I might ask to be considered for the new job . 
 I think that I might like it , but I am still thinking about it . 
 I think that I would enjoy the position but there isn't a lot of creativity involved . 
 I am also wondering about the pay . 
 I am thinking that might be the case . 
 Kelly , the guys and I think you should run for senior class president . 
 We talked to our older brothers and sisters last night and got the scoop on what that job is all about . 
 Yes . Did you know that the senior class president works for the class for life ? The job doesn't stop when we graduate . 
 Every class reunion is organized by the president and council and anything our class does for the school in later years is headed by the president . 
 Good morning , I made an appointment with Dr . Smith , but I have to change it . 
 My appointment was on Wednesday . 
 It was for 4 
 I want to change to next Tuesday . 
 I would prefer three o ’ clock in the afternoon . 
 Did you get the car you wanted ? 
 What about the car over there ? 
 May I take your drink order while you are looking over your menu ? 
 The wine list is on the second page of your menu . 
 Yes , we have a full bar here . 
 Actually , we are famous for our Cuervo Gold margaritas . 
 Would you like that drink blended or on the rocks ? 
 Would you like it with salt or no salt ? 
 I ’ m Miss Sherman . What seems to be the problem ? 
 That ’ s true . For the Junior Executive Room ... three nights ... yes , your bill should be $ 1,500 
 The advertised rate is based on double occupancy . 
 Are you quite sure ? 
 I see . I had no idea our advertising was so misleading . It is here , but it ’ s in the fine print on the last page . 
 Normally I couldn ’ t do that . But under the circumstances , I ’ ll see what I can arrange.Customer satisfaction is our primary aim . 
 Hello , I have a reservation for a double . 
 It's Smith . Here is my driver's license . 
 I'd like to put it on my VISA . 
 Great , is our room ready yet ? 
 Good morning , sir . 
 Do you have a particular style in mind ? 
 I think you should realize that even the most conservative style changes . 
 The changes are usually not that dramatic . We just got some pictures of the latest fashion . Would you like to take a look ? 
 Next Friday . 
 Do you have any more questions ? 
 Let's call it a day then.Good - bye , everyone . 
 Hello . Smith ’ s Resident . 
 This is Mr . Smith . 
 Yes , I ’ ll pay for the call . Put her through , please . 
 Oh , the bus is gone . 
 I'm afraid we have to wait for the next bus . 
 Spring Festival is the most important festival in China , isn't it ? 
 How long is the holiday ? 
 Do you eat any special food for the festival ? 
 That's interesting . I'm told the Chinese firework is very beautiful , isn't it ? 
 Oh , great ! I hope I can spend this Spring Festival with you here in Beijing . 
 Mr . Wang , I've had scheduled for your two days stay in Shanghai . You can make some changes if it does not suit you . 
 On Friday morning , Mr . Wang , the director of Shanghai Research Institute , will visit you at the hotel . In the afternoon , you will discuss some problems with Mr . Yang , vice manager of computer corporation . 
 On Saturday , you'll leave the hotel for sightseeing . Miss Lu will be your guide . 
 Hello . I want to purchase an old music box . 
 I was hoping I could find something made in the ' 20s . 
 I hope at least one of them has dancing figures . 
 So hard to choose . I think I'll take this one . 
 Does a warranty come with this music box ? 
 I just thought I would ask . 
 Taylor , you're looking a little pale . Are you sure you want to hand out nametags ? 
 True . Keep up the good work . Hello , welcome to the reunion of the Class of ' 93 . 
 And don't forget to put in an order for your reunion memory book . 
 I'll talk to you later . 
 I have to get off the phone now . 
 There are other things I need to take care of . 
 Please don't be nosey . 
 You don't need to worry about that . 
 I am very sorry , but I must go . 
 We are going to need confirmation on these orders today , and delivery must be made before next Tuesday . Do you think you can handle that ? 
 No , I must know today because we have to go to press for the advertisements . Is there anyway you can speed up the process of checking inventory ? 
 Are you kidding ? 
 Will you go with us this Sunday ? 
 Let's go and play volleyball . 
 Jim . I heard you got a promotion ! 
 Congratulations , guy . 
 The sun is up ! Time for all the campers to rise . Time to get paddling . 
 Do not worry . Today will be easier . 
 Today is Saturday . 
 Today is July 4th . 
 Call her on my cell phone . Wish her “ Happy Birthday ! ” Tell her you are out exploring the great American wilderness . Tell her I said she is lucky to be born on Independence Day . 
 It is December 25th . 
 Yes , I am lucky . I was born on Christ ’ s birthday . Maybe that is why I usually go to church on Sundays . When is your birthday ? 
 That is true ! Here , have some Granola for breakfast . 
 After eating , we will take down our tent . Then we will pack everything into the canoe , We can shove off by 6 
 How about going for swim around 10 
 Happy Independence Day ! 
 Mine was ok , except that no one in my class speaks English . I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester . 
 That ’ s quite the array of nationalities . Everyone in my class is from Asia , except me . There are a few South Koreans , several Japanese , Malaysian , Thai , Singaporean , Filipino , Kazakhstan , and one Russian . 
 I guess so , but I think it ’ s going to be hard to relate to my classmates , especially with the language barrier . I think I might change classes . 
 I highly doubt it . Your girlfriend is Chinese . 
 I don ’ t understand why you always look so happy , so energetic . It seems like you ’ Ve got good news everyday . 
 All I know is you look quite differently from other teachers . 
 Oh , I know . I saw you doing pull-ups one time on the campus 5 and some students trying to imitate you . 
 It ’ s true . Many students do the exercise when they have to . We have P . E . once a week . 
 Of course . I didn ’ t know that . I only know exercise makes bodies stronger . I should take some exercise then . Do you have any suggestions ? 
 Oh , I know . Thank you . 
 sure , go ahead . 
 yes , it is . You want go online ? there are no wi-fi hotspots around . 
 can't you wait till you get home ? then you can surf the internet using the broadband , wireless connection or whatever you like . 
 now I see , you must be suffering from discomgoogolation . 
 well , the term " discomgoogolation " comes from " discombobulate " and " google " . Because floods of information are just a mouse click away , net users are very likely to become addicted to the web . 
 then , you're probably addicted . 
 I think it's the most successful film in scene-setting and music . 
 I know you're sleepy and I hate to bother you , but I think you're late for work . 
 Don't worry . I can give you a lift . 
 Hi , how are you ? 
 That's for sure . You're new , too , huh ? 
 I really think if I can get my foot in the door at this company it will do wonders for my career . Do you think you can help me polish my interview style ? 
 I ’ Ve researched the company and think I ’ m perfect for the job but I ’ m not sure how to get it across to them . 
 I know I have what it takes but Im worried that my work experience won ’ t sufficient . Should I inflate my experience ? 
 Here is my ticket and seat assignment . 
 May I have a pillow and blanket , PLS ? 
 May I have headphones for the in-flight movie ? 
 Thanks , a coke , PLS . 
 Take me to the center station , please 
 Do you think you can get me there seven thirty ? 
 Hope we have good luck . 
 Thank you very much . Here's 10 $ , keep the change , please . 
 Hello Dr Peters . Just fine thank you . Ricky and I are here for his vaccines . 
 What about Rubella and Mumps ? 
 OK , great . Doctor , I think I also may need a Tetanus booster . Last time I got it was maybe fifteen years ago ! 
 What's the temperature today ? 
 What's the weather forecast for tomorrow ? 
 Are you used to the climate here ? 
 What is the average temperature of Beijing ? 
 Which season do you like best ? 
 When we get paid for this assignment , you get US $ 2 , TOO , and I get US $ 3,000 . 
 Okay , okay , we'll split it 50/50 . 
 Almost . I have to get dressed . It's a formal party and I have special party make up ! 
 Great ! Uh , remember that there's a gift exchange , too . We all have to bring a gift . 
 ( At the Party ) It's Christmas Eve ! Time to open presents ! 
 Wow ! It's just what I wanted ! 
 May I please speak to Tom ? 
 I'll just try him again . 
 No , but what time do you expect him back ? 
 What ’ s wrong with you , Mr . Polly ? 
 Then , buy a bottle of soft drink . 
 It ’ s a problem , because my boss is in that shop now . 
 Sorry , Mr . Polly . 
 Have a try . 
 Hey , I still know my name . 
 She said I have a fever but nothing major . 
 What if this small fever turns into a big fever ? 
 I hear that you have been promoted . Congratulations on your promotion ! 
 When are you going ? 
 Can I help you with something ? 
 Is there a problem with it ? 
 What would you like to do with all the money in this account ? 
 I can do that . 
 Do you want to take any money out ? 
 It ’ s going to take a moment for me to cancel your account . 
 I want to take part in the bus tour . When does the bus leave ? 
 That's fine . I don't have much time to waste . 
 How long does the tour last ? 
 All of my friends are going out to the lake tonight and I'm going too ! 
 Hi , do you have any tickets for the show tonight ? 
 Well , do you have any for tomorrow ? 
 Ok . I ’ ll take it . 
 Do you have anything in the middle section ? I want a good view , but sitting too close hurts my eyes . 
 Hello , this is Julie from Google Corp . Is that Jin Lili ? 
 I am calling to impart the news that you are supposed to have an interview . 
 I said that you are supposed to have an interview . 
 Julia , will you be my wife ? 
 Please , Julia , I have made proposal to you five times . I really want to share the rest of my life with you . 
 Julia , I really love you . I hope I can stay with you no matter you are happy or sad in future . 
 So , will you marry me ? 
 What is wrong with Peter ? He sure looks unhappy . 
 How foolish he is . The girl is inviting . She often makes a pass at boys . 
 Your brand new car is so excellent . I like it very much . 
 Come to think of it , you should get out your English books and catch up on your reading assignments . 
 Then review for your test . You'll do even better . And maybe reading will help you get to sleep . 
 You say that now , Lily , but you'll thank me later . I'm your mom , and mother knows best . 
 I need to fight this ticket that I got . 
 Yes , he is , Your Honor . 
 I was told by the officer that I ran a red light . That information isn't true . 
 I'm not sure , but the signal had a camera on it . 
 No , my picture wasn't taken . 
 Thank you very much , Your Honor . 
 Yes , I was . 
 I was in the bank at the time of the robbery . 
 I saw a man come in with a gun . 
 No . He had a mask on . 
 He was by himself . 
 That shouldn't be a problem . 
 No , tell him I'm tied up . 
 Tell him to call me tomorrow morning . 
 Thank you . 
 Pretty well . What about you ? 
 It's a bit disappointing that they are all out for a movie . 
 Not bad . I heard you are going to graduate this coming summer , right ? 
 Did you go to a real estate agent ? 
 That's true . By the way , what kind of apartment are you looking for ? 
 Sure . I'll try my best to find a satisfying one for you . 
 How can I help you today , Alice ? 
 Oh , good . You're an excellent student . I'd be very willing to help you with that . 
 What kind of scholarship is it ? 
 Fine . I know about that scholarship.You have to be a student in your junior year , and you have to have a grade point average of 3.7 or higher . 
 Excellent . So you'll have a good chance of getting it . 
 Do you have an essay you want to send them ? 
 What is the question ? 
 That's a pretty short essay . 
 Good luck . I'm sure you will do a good job . 
 Sure . What are they ? 
 I'd be happy to write one for you . 
 What is it ? Do you want me to read your essay ? 
 Of course I could read it . That's no problem . But you need to get it to me soon . 
 Alright . If you can bring it to me tomorrow morning , I can talk with you after class on Friday.So I'll have some feedback for you before the weekend . 
 Don't mention it . I'm always willing to help good students . 
 It's hard to say , I like interesting and significant ones . I don't care whether they're blockbusters or not . 
 Very good , What's on ? 
 Congratulations , Francis . Your hard working finally pays off . I am so happy for your promotion . 
 I hope I could get promoted some day . Tell me about your experience , ok ? 
 How do you think if I volunteer for some work ? 
 Waiter . 
 No , thanks . Please bring us the bill . 
 Separate bills , please . 
 Here you are . Thank you 
 You can pick up your keys on Tuesday night . When you actually move in is up to you . 
 Make sure that you transfer the utilities to your name and tell them when you will be moving in . 
 An empty house is easier to paint and clean . Take a few days to take care of those things before you start moving your furniture in . 
 I think that will work out just fine . It will help when you move your groceries in and need to keep them cold . 
 My grandmother needs me to help her trim her roses that day . 
 Let me help you . 
 Here you are . 
 I want a pair of enameled leather shoes in size 30 . 
 The heel is a little tight . 
 Really ? I will take it . 
 It's good to be home . 
 Oh , I know . When is it ? 
 What's on the test ? 
 Well . I think I'm going to fail my chemistry exam . 
 I'm not being pessimistic . I'm being realistic . My chemistry is so bad . 
 Thank you . That's very nice of you . 
 Say what you want to say . 
 I am sorry . But I do not have any money to lend to you . 
 I certainly did . Do you want to come in and give me some feedback about your weekend ? 
 How did the business trip go ? 
 I understand . The last time I went on a business trip with the boss , I didn't even have enough to eat ! 
 Our company is quite conscious of the environmental problems that frequent flying causes . 
 I can ask the boss about giving you the day off today . 
 No problem . Did you bring any gifts back for your department ? 
 Mr . White , I would like to give you notice that I will be leaving the company . It will be effective at the beginning of the next month . 
 I've been offered another job with higher salary . And it also gives me the opportunity of promotion . 
 You are really a good employer , Mr . White and I am very lucky to have such a good boss like you . But this new job is more in my field of interest training . It's something I have always wanted . 
 May I help you , ma'ma ? 
 First you must check in at Counter No . 4 . 
 That's right . Then you will follow the signs to Gate 85 . 
 Are there any vacancies still available ? 
 I am looking for a job that is more advanced than that , such as sales manager or regional manager . 
 I just had a terrible week . 
 I fell down and hurt my arm . 
 Then my son drove into a tree . 
 The dog bit the delivery boy . 
 And a storm blew our roof away . 
 Steven , you are always looking in good shape . How do you keep it ? 
 Yeah , you are right . Tell me your normal diet . 
 And ? 
 Oh , no wonder you are healthy . 
 Thanks for sharing your experience with me . 
 Suit wrote me a letter . 
 She got a master degree , and now she is going for her doctor . 
 It's not a surprise , is it ? She has always been a hard working student . 
 Now that it ’ s the new year , I ’ Ve decided to turn over a new leaf . 
 You got it ! I have a new job , I ’ m living in a new city , with new friends ! This is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way I live my life . 
 Well , first of all , I ’ Ve decided to stop smoking . It ’ s not that I ’ m pinching pennies or anything , it ’ s just that I ’ Ve been smoking since I was sixteen , and I think it ’ s time to stop . 
 One last thing , I ’ Ve decided to come out of the closet . 
 Joe , how are you doing ? 
 I am doing great ! Thank you for asking , Joe . 
 I need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper . 
 What were you planning on seeing ? 
 How about “ The Secret Life of Bees ” ? 
 Hello , this is 5735647 5 . 
 This is Linda . 
 Really ? What time and which restaurant ? 
 Ok , I'll wait for you at 7pm at home . Anything else ? 
 Thank you . Bye . 
 What wrong with you ? You look pale ? 
 When did the trouble start ? 
 It sounds like you ’ re coming down with the flu . Let me take your temperature . 
 Yes . Thirty-eight point seven . Do you have a headache , chestache or throat pain ? 
 Now , Let me have a look at you . I ’ d like to listen to your chest . Breathe then , deep breath , that ’ s it . Cough , now again . I want to exam your throat too . Open wide , say A . 
 Yes , It does look a bit sore.Let ’ s take your extra way of your chest and give you a few tests . 
 The tests showed nothing wrong . a slight by infection . 
 I ’ m giving you some antibiotic and aspirin . Taking aspirin when you ’ Ve got a fever and take one antibiotic until four hours and go home lie in bed for two days . Take some water then you feel better . 
 Great . Where is it ? 
 What about the surrounding area ? 
 That's good . Is the location easily accessible ? 
 Hmm ... well , maybe we can buy this one then . 
 I'm going to quit the job . 
 The task is tough . 
 Thanks for your concern . 
 The last straw , huh ? 
 I know what you mean . 
 Yes , I've watched the finale for the ' Super Girl ' . The producer is very smart to copy the program from the US , which is quite fresh and eye-catching for mainland audiences . 
 That ' s why the program has attracted so many star-wanna-bes . 
 Yeah , these programs are gradually losing their appeal . 
 And they lack originality . Talent shows like ' Super Girl ' and ' Super Boy ' are largely clones of ' The American Idol ' . 
 I think producers are underestimating the audience . They should think of better ways to entertain the general public . 
 I'm not sure.Let me have a look ... It could be a coffee grinder . 
 Yes , it must be used for grinding coffee beans . 
 Good morning . 
 May I take your order ? 
 How would you like your egg ? 
 All right , sir . 
 Nothing . He's just got a chip on the shoulder . 
 Nice meeting you , too . 
 You can ask me questions , if you ’ d like . 
 Everyone should be able to love who they want . 
 I sure would . 
 That ’ s not my problem . 
 I ’ m glad to hear that . 
 May I see some identification , sir , please ? 
 Thank you so much . Have you got a credit card , Mr . Sandals ? 
 Unfortunately , at the present time we take only MasterCard or VISA . 
 Thank you , sir . You'll be in room 507 , nonsmoking , with a queen-size bed . Do you approve , sir ? 
 That's great . This is your key , sir . If you need anything at all , anytime , just dial zero . 
 I ’ m thinking about it . How much is it ? 
 Oh , dear . It ’ s too expensive . Can you give me a better price ? 
 It ’ s still too much . Can ’ t you make it any cheaper than that ? 
 I see . Can I pay by traveler ’ s checks ? 
 Something wrong ? 
 What's wrong ? 
 Do you want me to take a look ? 
 Well , if you change your mind , let me know . 
 No problem . 
 Sure . I have all kinds of tools . Just ask . I ’ ll be happy to get them for you . 
 Anything for you . Seriously , I don ’ t mind helping . 
 Oh , my goodness . The traffic is crawling . 
 We are now running late . 
 Let me check and look at the map . Yes , there is an exit three quarters of a mile ahead . We ’ ll exit Market Street , head west , then get on the Pennsylvania Freeway . 
 Julia , are you free tonight ? 
 I want to invite you to go to the movies . 
 Yes . 
 Where do you want to meet ? 
 What time should we meet ? 
 All right . 
 I'd like to look it over before I sign it . 
 I am fully satisfied with the terms of this contract . 
 OK . Where do you want me to sign ? 
 OK . ( Sign ) Once a contract is signed , it has legal effect . 
 It's my pleasure . 
 We have a fairly good working relationship , but there was also a rough spot . 
 Well , he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations . 
 We'd like to hear your account of the events of last night . 
 Merry Christmas , Jina . 
 Come have a look , I received many beautiful e-cards . They are from my friends , all over the world . Christmas wishes for all my friends . 
 Sorry , I don't have it . But I do have her Email . You want me to sent it to you ? 
 No worries . I just for her card . And you can get her from Email . I would really like to talk to her again . I kind of miss her a little this days . 
 My pleasure . 
 Sure . Should I wash or dry ? 
 OK . Let's do it . 
 Why ? Do you have a robot girlfriend ? 
 So you can download MP3 music from the Net and record it onto the MP3 chip ? 
 Let me see it ! It's so small ! 
 That's easy . It was your office ergonomics that decided me . 
 Yes . It is very important to me . My mother worked in offices for twenty years , and she finally had carpal tunnel syndrome . I have been reading about repetitive stress injuries , and I know that t 
 Yes , I noticed that you have professional training and team-building days . I like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff . 
 Excuse me . I bought this just now and here's a receipt . I'm afraid I was short-changed . Could you look into it ? 
 Who do you think is going to get the Oscar for best actor ? 
 Hey there ! I ’ Ve been hoping to run into you . Are you busy tomorrow morning ? 
 I was hoping to talk to you about the sales projections for next year . I ’ m having a little trouble figuring out how to use the spreadsheet you set up for me . It has a lot of complicated form 
 Ooh . Sorry , that ’ s not good for me . I am tied up all day Friday . We ’ ll have to do it next week . I am wide open then . 
 Sure , that ’ ll be fine for me . I ’ ll come to your office so you can show how you set up these macros . 
 That's fine . We can supply all kinds of precision machine tools . Our products are much admired in the world market and enjoy a wide acceptance in modern industry . 
 Why , of course . Here are some that will show you our latest development . You may select which ever you need . 
 Excuse me . It's true that our products do cost slightly more than the other makers , but It's only due to our technological superiority . 
 If you give us your inquiry , I shall go very carefully into the price and try my best to put you on the best of the terms . 
 Yes , surely . We hope to do some substantial business with you . 
 Not hot but warm . Very comfortable . 
 Yes , I have already booked a room . 
 Sure , I would like a Coke . 
 Let's see , can I get some fried zucchini , please ? 
 No , that's it , thank you . 
 I would like to order my food now . 
 Can I get a cheeseburger and some fries ? 
 That's all , thank you . 
 You've come to the right place . We've got various styles and sizes recently . How much do you measure around your waist ? 
 OK ! 2 Chi round . Try this one . Maybe it's of your size . 
 Let me check the stock . How about this one ? 
 150 Yuan . 
 Here's your change , 50 Yuan . Welcome back again . 
 I have a Promissory Note , but it's not called that . It's a Bill of Exchange . 
 So , even if someone wasn't directly involved , they can become involved ? Like the bank you cash it in ? 
 I see . Sorry about this , I'm new in this job and I've never even seen one of these before ! My boss just told me to come here and sort it out . 
 What would you like for your main dish ? 
 How would you like it ? 
 Anything else , sir ? 
 Of course . 
 I take it you've done this before ? 
 Good . 
 Of course , just fill out this form and let me know when you are finished . 
 I will also need your driver's license ; hand me the filled-out form , please . 
 Perfect ! Do you know the hours and rules for the library ? 
 Everything you need to know is printed on the card and handout . 
 Great ! You are all set to enjoy the library . 
 Yes , can I return this article , please ? 
 You see , I bought it for my husband , but he doesn't like it . 
 Last Saturday . 
 Yes , here you are . 
 If you'd like further information on this , there ’ s a guidebook in several languages on sale at the information desk . 
 I'm afraid we don't . Won't an English edition do ? 
 How would you describe your ideal job ? 
 Why do you think you might like to work for our company ? 
 What makes you think you would be a success in this position ? 
 How do you know about this company ? 
 Donna , you really shocked everyone at the party last night ! 
 Yes ! We have all assumed that you were the quiet , shy type . 
 Where did you learn to sing like that ? 
 You ? Wow . And why don't you ever dress like that at work ? 
 Did you find everything ok today ? 
 Yes . But you must return it within 30 days . 
 There will be no charge at all . However you must show us the receipt . Could you sign it here , please ? 
 All right . Keep you receipt . If something comes up , you can show it to us and we will give you a refund . 
 That woman is a thorough drag ! 
 She keeps spitting on the ground . 
 So , are we all ready to go ? 
 Did you get the camera ? 
 Yup , it ’ s all set . 
 I ’ m sure ... we ’ Ve got all our bases covered . 
 Um ... do you think we can make a pit stop ? 
 I know , but I forgot to go to the bathroom before we left . 
 I calmed up . And finally , I asked her to chew the cud for such an important decision . I could not have the heart to disappoint her with a blunt refusal . 
 How could have the heart to do that ? She needs warmth and help . 
 It ’ s going pretty well , but I ’ m really tired ! 
 It ’ s all right . I don ’ t mind being busy ! 
 Sure . You see all these little drawers here and all the way around the walls ? 
 These drawers contain cards describing every book in our library . Together they constitute the library's " card catalog " . You can see that each drawer runs from one part of the alphabet to another . Fox example , this drawer goes from SCA to SCM . 
 No . You'd look under ' W ' . The articles ' a ' and ' the ' don't count in our alphabetization , and cards are generally omitted for extremely common words and phrases such as ' history of ' , ' introduction to ' , ' story of ' and so forth . 
 Well , you can look under the author's name . 
 Suppose you want to find a book by your professor , William Smith . You'd look under SMITH and then WILLIAM . Since that's very common name , you may have to go through several ' William Smith ' until you come to the one who wrote book on the subject you are interested in . 
 Actually , you do not need to go into the office to file a claim . You can do it over the phone or the Internet . 
 That ’ s a good decision . They have many good job search tools there . 
 The Internet has a list of Employment Development Offices listed online . 
 Our office is over on Green Street , just west of the college . 
 Everyone has a one-week waiting period before they can collect . 
 We should have it put together by the end of next week . 
 Well , as the saying goes – we aim to please ! 
 pretty well . I don't know if I'll get the promotion or not , but I feel good about it . 
 if I get the promotion , I will be a senior engineer instead of an assistant engineer . 
 whenever you are given added responsibilities , you should get a promotion . 
 my boss . 
 she asked me about my ability to work in a team and what I thought a good boss should be . 
 I told her that I'm an excellent team player and that a good boss should treat male and female employees equally . 
 she told me that even when I become a senior engineer , I'll have to work with the assistant engineers as a team . 
 she's pretty easy to get along with . She listens to her employees and treats everyone equally . 
 that's true . She's highly esteemed among everyone at my company . 
 I will do . 
 Yes . What do you want ? 
 What do you care , dork ? 
 You mean fat boy ? 
 Oh great ! This stupid computer froze again ! That's the third time today ! Hey Samuel , can you come take a look at my PC ? It's acting again . It must have a virus or something . 
 But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing theinternet , I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus . 
 Ok . Anything else ? 
 Um yeah . Sorry about that . 
 Hi , John ! I haven't seen you for ages . 
 So how have you been ? 
 Did you take the written test ? 
 Make sure to study first . 
 I'm sure you're ready . 
 No , it doesn't cost anything . 
 It skips around . 
 I thought it would be easy , but I didn't pass it . 
 Good morning , Mr . Chu . Would you like me to brief your schedule for today ? 
 You are scheduled to meet Mr . Thompson of ABC Company at eleven this morning . Then , you have a lunch appointment with Mr . Li . And this afternoon at four you will attend a press conference . 
 All right . Do you want me to cancel the reservation for you ? 
 The proposal is being repaired right now and I think it will be ready by tomorrow morning . 
 Where is your store located ? 
 Right , I'll be right over . 
 I want to have a bath . 
 Shower , please . 
 How much should I pay ? 
 Good afternoon . May I help you ? 
 Which type of deposit do you prefer , time deposit or current deposit ? 
 Okey . The interest rate for time deposit is higher . Could you tell me it's RIB deposit or currency deposit ? 
 Is it your first time to make a deposit here ? 
 The term of time deposit ranges from three months to five years , including three months , six months , one year , two years , three years and five years . How long would you like to keep your deposit ? 
 Fill in this slip in ink , please . 
 All right . Just a moment , please . 
 Hello , I'm returning your phone call . 
 No problem , but what were you calling about ? 
 Is he messing up in school ? 
 What was he doing ? 
 I don't know what's gotten into him . 
 I will get right on that , and I am very sorry . 
 John's very late.Do you think he's coming ? 
 I suppose you're right.He can't have remembered . 
 I certainly am . What can I do for you ? 
 Sure . By all means please do . Please take a seat . 
 William told you that his grandmother is sick , huh ? What exactly did he say ? 
 It didn't sound like he was too upset , huh ? What did you tell him ? 
 Well I hate to tell you this Jen , but both of William's grandmothers passed away more than five years ago . 
 Yes , sir.When do you want to leave here ? 
 Will , that'll be the sixth of September . 
 I'll check it over.Oh , there're three flights available that day.one at 2 p . m . , one at 5 p . m . and the other at 9p . m . 
 4 o'clock . 
 Can we have two tickets for the 7:30 showing of ' Beautiful Mind ' . 
 What's on tomorrow at that time ? 
 Terrific , that's a wonderful movie , I like it very much . Can I get tickets now for tomorrow ? 
 Two tickets , please . 
 Welcome to the company . We are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company . 
 Yes , flextime has definitely been a good change for us . How do you feel about the pay ? 
 But there is a big bonus for employees at the end of the probation period . 
 One thing you can be sure of your manager will be quite fair . If your job performance is up to par , you shouldn't be afraid of a performance review , 
 Thanks for inviting me over for dinner this evening . 
 It looks delicious . 
 Susan ! Why didn ’ t you tell me that you were taking over the Silk Company account ? 
 You know I wasn ’ t at the meeting . I was meeting with Mr . Wei about this account . I ’ Ve been on this for a month and a half . 
 May I have an appointment with you tonight ? 
 OK . where and when ? 
 OK , I am going to the hotel to pick you up . See you tomorrow night . 
 If you'll just give me your name , phone , and date of visit , I can cancel your reservation . 
 Mr . Randolph . Okay , one second , sir , and there you go . Your reservation is now cancelled . 
 Not a problem , sir . Please remember us in the future . 
 Let me see what's available . 
 Africa Airline 551 leaves at 9:00 pm . 
 Excuse me , are you Mrs . Green from England ? 
 I'm pleased to meet you , Mrs . Green . My name is Myra . I work in Beijing Institute of Technology . I came here to meet you . 
 How do you do ? 
 Welcome to Beijing . Is this your first time in China ? 
 It's our pleasure to have you here . I hope you will have a pleasant stay here . 
 Hi , I'd like to get your store credit card . 
 I'm finished . Here's the form . 
 Here's my VISA . 
 How could you have done that without asking me first ? 
 Well , you should have thought . 
 Do you have all types of seafood here ? 
 What do you recommend ? 
 OK , we will try it . 
 Two bottles of white wine , please . 
 Yes , I have an overall understanding . 
 Then when will I get a reply at the latest ? 
 But if I don't pass , will you call me ? 
 Then do I have the chance to get this job ? 
 I know . No matter what the result will be , I have learned a lot from our conversation . 
 Thanks for giving me the opportunity of this interview . 
 Welcome , Ron , come on in ! 
 We enjoy it too ! 
 About four years now . 
 Ron , have a seat and I'll get us something to drink . 
 I have lemonade , iced tea , and mango juice . 
 Adam , could you show me around the school ? 
 What's the tallest building ? 
 Yes . 
 What's the building to the south of the library ? 
 Is there a swimming pool in your school ? 
 I do envy you . And I hope I can enter your school one day . 
 I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Monica to our company and introduce her to her department and colleagues . For all of you , we hired Monica because she is a very professional accountant and we are very happy to have her in the finance department . She has lots of working experiences as an accountant and I am sure everybody in the department can benefit from this . 
 Hello , Bob , this is Frank . 
 I didn't know you knew Frank . 
 Please send this memo out to all the managerial staff ... there will be training for all the department heads next week . Attendance for managerial staff is mandatory , except for the financial department . Financial officers may participate if their schedules allow . 
 Managerial staff is anyone who is in a position of authority or responsibility , or who has anyone working under them . It includes all supervisors and department heads . 
 No , they are in a position of leadership and have more experience than normal account managers , but they do not directly supervise others . They are not members of the managerial staff and will not be included in our training . 
 Yes , we have . The city is famous for its beautiful evening scenery . 
 It starts at 7:00 and lasts 3 hours . 
 How do you know that ? 
 Oh , I see . But I think you are making a fuss . They will make it up . Bet it . 
 I ’ Ve been to most of the countries in Europe , several countries in asia-china , Japan , korea , and Thailand-and to the united states and Canada . 
 No , but I ’ m planning on visiting Australia and new Zealand soon . I ’ Ve heard that they are beautiful countries . Which is the most beautiful country you ’ Ve been to ? 
 Isn ’ t it really cold there ? 
 I ’ Ve been to other Scandinavian countries , but not to Norway . Perhaps I should go and do some winter sports there . 
 What for ? Oh , I see , you mean next year our company will expand business to the South Korea market . 
 Well , sounds promising . But I think our company will provide us with the language training courses if it is necessary . We need not bother signing for the language by ourselves . 
 Hello , Mr . Thomas . Could you spare a minute ? 
 I need to talk to you about that new driver you ’ Ve hired . I think I am going to have some problems working with him . 
 Excuse me , driver , where is the main area for restaurants ? 
 OK . Is there a Chinese restaurant ? 
 Woo , I can't help being there . 
 Sure , sir . But there is a charge for alcoholic beverages in economy class . Would you please refer to this price list ? And then give me your order . 
 OK , I will bring it to you in a moment . 
 Wait a moment . Here you are . 
 Sure . 
 I bought the MP4 in your store a week before , but it doesn't work today . 
 Yes , here you are . 
 Hello , take a seat please . Let's get straight to the point . This is our contract . Please read it carefully before signing . 
 May we once more remind you that the contract should be canceled by one month notice . 
 What are the attractions of that city ? 
 Oh , that's what I am looking for . Do you have a reduction for 6 persons ? 
 Good game ? 
 Yes , I know . Kind of hard to concentrate , isn't it ? 
 Oh , just on my own . I just joined , so I don't really have any partners . 
 16 . Yours ? 
 Jane . Nice to meet you . 
 Yes , it's fine . However , I personally think the fairways between the greens are a bit too long , especially for such a hot climate . Don't they have carts ? 
 Oh , that's good . I guess the caddies were pleased . 
 Yes , but look at it this way , getting rid of the carts probably gives more work to local people , which is a good thing , right ? 
 How awful , poor guy . 
 Oh , my God , you're kidding me ! He carried him back ? 
 Operator . Can I help you ? 
 To Mr . Zhang in at 2135-3678 ? 
 May I have your name and telephone number ? 
 Mr . Luo , will you hold the line , please - - - Mr . Luo , there is no Zhang at that number . Will you check the number again , please ? 
 It's 2135-3678 . 
 Are you sure this time ? 
 OK . Let me try again . 
 I'm interested in Chinese antiques . 
 I'd like a flower-and-bird painting . 
 Oh , they look just like live cranes . 
 That one looks pretty big . Are you going to keep it ? 
 Not me . I like to throw back what I catch . 
 What's your major in college ? 
 What research are you dealing with now ? 
 What do you think of the test ? 
 It wasn't too bad . Were you nervous ? 
 Oh , I wouldn't worry about it . 
 No , I wouldn't worry about you . 
 It seems to me that you always do better than you say . 
 Sarah and I could see eye to eye with each other . 
 No , I encourage her to go her own way , but she's now having a change of heart . 
 it's very nice . I haven't heard live music in a while . This is fun . 
 of course . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer ... 
 you're dancing so well . 
 when did you learn to dance ? 
 it's hard to say . It depends . But I love the waltz . 
 oh , I like it . It's such a beautiful dance , but I can't do it well . What about you ? 
 thank you for the dance . 
 ok . 
 Oh , yes . My wife bought it for me yesterday . Hmm , you look nice in that yellow dress . Yellow suits you really well . 
 That's right . You know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . Actually , I think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . It's just that different colors can give people different impressions . For example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic . 
 Well , compared with my wife , I'm just a beginner . 
 Are you having problems ? This is the first I ’ Ve heard of it . 
 What kind of problems are you talking about ? 
 Maybe I could get back to you in a few weeks . I am leaving on vacation this afternoon . 
 Don ’ t tell me what to do ! I ’ ll get to it when I get around to it ! 
 I ’ ll be right over ! 
 No , I'm not.Hey , look at that guy over there . 
 The guy in the blue shirt at the table by the window . 
 Right there . 
 Yes , it's Mel Gibson . 
 I don't know . Why don't you go ask for his autograph ? 
 Why not ? 
 Silly , you should make sure he does . 
 He ’ s buying me a handbag , and then dinner at a gorgeous restaurant . 
 Hey ! I just bought one of those new Japanese cell phones ! It's loaded with extras . 
 It's got a built-in video camera so you can see the person you're talking to.It also takes stills and I can use the E-mail mode to send digital pictures straight to my friend's phone ! 
 I can plug it into a folding keyboard to type in message mode . l can even surf the net . 
 Yes.With the 600 - second digital memory , l can record my voice and send it using voice message mode . 
 You'll love this ! I can use a stylus to draw a map on the touch screen and then use the fax mode to send it to another phone . 
 Hello , may I speak to Mrs Smith ? 
 This is Sun , and I interviewed with you yesterday . 
 I am calling to thank you for giving me the interview for the Sales Manager position yesterday . 
 I really enjoyed meeting with you . 
 I am very interested in this position . 
 Well , thank you for your time and consideration again . 
 Hello ! I ’ m now trying to take a bath , but there are too many buttons , would tell me how to use them ? 
 I read it , but I couldn ’ t understand it . Would you come to my room and tell me how to use them ? 
 And also tell me how to use other switches . 
 No , I'm good . All we need now is our check . 
 I think that is our waitress is over by the bar . Boy , the service has not been good this evening . 
 Good . Just bring it back and we'll total it together . 
 What do you think would be the right amount to tip ? 
 I agree that it was bad service , but I heard one of the other waiters mentioning that it was our server's first night on the job . 
 I think that a tip of $ 3.60 will be the right amount to leave . 
 I think it ’ s mainly from the environment a person lives in . 
 No , but parents control a lot of the environment that kids grow up in , so they certainly influence their kids ' personalities a lot . 
 Maybe when they become teenagers , they want to be completely different to their parents . 
 Do you think that teenagers get a lot of their bad behaviour from tv and movies ? 
 Parents have a difficult job . They have to bring up their children and usually have to work too . 
 Yes , he is . He ’ s very hardworking when he ’ s at school . Then he comes home from school and does homework before dinner . After dinner , he goes out with his friends . 
 Thanks for inviting me to your friend ’ s wedding . I was surprised to hear the bride and groom talking to each other that way during the marriage ceremony . Is that common ? 
 Your tradition of throwing rice as they got into their car was interesting , but it didn't look like real rice to me . 
 Oh , I didn't think of that . Well , this reception reminds me of weddingparties back in China . Plenty of food and drink , music and dancing , and interesting traditions . 
 She ’ s got quite a crowd around her . Oh , look ! That little girl caught it ! 
 Are we supposed to get off right here ? 
 Where are we ? 
 You said this was the right stop . 
 Did we get off the bus too early ? 
 Why did you tell me to get off ? 
 I really don't feel like walking . 
 So that will be one teddy , two terry cloth robes , three pairs of satin slippers , and two pairs of pajamas . 
 Let me see ... yes , 15,880 NT . After the discount , your total comes to 12,704 NT . Here's your free teddy bear , free panties and your card application . 
 Right here . And write your address . You'll get the card in the mail within a week . 
 I know your friend will like the gift set , especially the teddy bear . 
 Remember to keep your receipt in case your friend needs to make any exchanges . There are no refunds on sale items . 
 It's not that far . Do you see that Yellow building over there ? 
 The big one . 
 It's right next to it , on the right . 
 I don't think there's one around here . The closest one is on 3rd street , but that's probably closed now . 
 Well , you could go down to 22nd street . There are lot of stores down there that are open 24 hours a day . 
 Yes , but that'll probably take about half an hour . You should just take a cab . 
 No , from here I think it's only about 5 dollars . 
 I think I ’ ll stay in on Saturday and rest . 
 Ah , I ’ m going to the pub to watch the football . 
 Sure , you ’ re more than welcome . I ’ m meeting everyone at three o ’ clock . 
 Good afternoon , is there anything I can do for you ? 
 That will make your eyes seem bigger . 
 Sure . It's the latest . 
 Hello , Mr . Stern . This is Hao Bo from the International Travel Agency . I have made the plane reservations for you . 
 Okay . You'll be travelling on Northwest Airlines , flight number 222 . 
 It departs Guangzhou at 10:30 on the morning of July 10 . 
 You want to fly first class . Is that correct , Mr . Stern ? 
 Well , I have got you three first class tickets and I have reserved your seats . Your seat numbers are 8A , 8B and 8C . 
 Yes , they are . I have charged the tickets to your credit card . They are 630 dollars each , so It is 1890 dollars for all three . 
 One more thing . Could you give me the names of the people you'll be travelling with ? 
 All right . You're all set . Have a nice flight . 
 What about the working hours ? 
 I like flexible hours . 
 No , I don't . 
 yes , I graduated with a BA in English from Qingdao University . 
 just a few years ago . What about you ? 
 are you planning on going to university ? 
 have you applied anywhere yet ? 
 congratulations ! Which one is the cheapest ? 
 which one has the most interesting course ? 
 where would you like to be located ? 
 have you applied for grants or financial aid of some sort ? 
 I think you should do that soon . It will help you make a decision about the school you go to . 
 good luck ! 
 Let's go get something to drink . 
 Do you know what you want to drink ? 
 You shouldn't drink soda when you're really thirsty . 
 When you're thirsty , you're not supposed to drink soda . 
 Water is what's best for you . 
 It's better for you . 
 Hello , this is Catherine . I am calling about the appointment with Mr . Liu for this afternoon . Something has just come up . I am afraid the appointment will have to be rescheduled . I am very sorry about the change . 
 You are very kind to say so . Thank you . Do you think tomorrow morning would suit him ? 
 Tomorrow afternoon . Um ... When do you think I can come and see him tomorrow afternoon ? 
 Yes , that's quite all right for me . Can we change it ? 
 Thank you very much . See you tomorrow afternoon . 
 Do you have any vacancies ? 
 How much is it ? 
 OK . Dose it include breakfast ? 
 Kate Green . 
 5 days . And could you send a bellboy to pick up my luggage ? 
 Could you keep my valuables ? 
 I can ’ t believe my English teacher is making me read pride and prejudice ! 
 But it ’ s so old . 
 No , not at all . 
 I didn ’ t realize it was a romance novel . What ’ s the main storyline ? 
 Why does he want to do that ? 
 Won ’ t they get his inheritance ? 
 I see . This sounds interesting ! Maybe my teacher isn ’ t so horrible after all . 
 There ’ s movie ? My teacher didn ’ t tell me that ! 
 It would take a lot less time ... 
 Ok . That sounds like a deal . 
 Can you tell me the exact place ? 
 Yes . But this one is full , you have to wait for the next one . 
 wow , the duck looks so delicious . Should we order it , Rick ? 
 I see . The chef is so skillful with his knife . 
 incredible . By the way , what are these in the plates ? 
 thank you . I couldn't wait any longer to have a taste . 
 oh , it's terrific . I love the floor . Can you tell me how it was prepared ? 
 it sounds really complicated . No wonder it tastes so great . 
 When can I move into my new house ? 
 Will the utilities be turned on ? 
 I really want to paint the walls right away and get the carpet cleaned . 
 I was thinking that I should have my new appliances delivered as we are moving in . 
 Can you help me on my move-in day ? 
 I have been very busy this year , working late , often taking work home and taking no vacation . I feel exhausted . 
 You are right . For the past few weeks , I had no appetite and couldn ’ t sleep well . What ’ s worse my back started aching this Monday . It is time for me to take a vacation . 
 Yeah sure , it's much quicker . Do you know how ? 
 Ok , not a problem . Let's go to the station . 
 Yeah . 
 Where is that ? 
 Oh , that's simple enough . 
 Anything else I should know ? 
 Hi , Mr . James , what's the rush ? 
 I can lend you some money . 
 Can I help in anyway ? 
 Sure . Let ’ s go . 
 Well , let's move , I can see a rest area ahead.We can relax there , and see what wildlife is around ... 
 Because I come hiking every week . That's why I'm in good-shape . I think that I should bring you a walkingstick next time . 
 So , you want me to carry your backpack , your thermos flask , our picnic , and you as well . No problem , jump on . 
 Keep it . I'm buying tonight . 
 Sure I can , my treat . 
 May I have your name and room number ? 
 OK.sir . Please go upstairs . Someone will open the door for you . 
 Hello . Capital Hotel . May I help you ? 
 Sure . May I have your name please ? 
 What's so special today ? 
 Didn't you notice all the roses ? 
 Oh , God . I just forget it . 
 No . But now he will be in bigger trouble ! What's a boyfriend for ? Forget about Valentine's Day ? 
 Oh , it's Clive . 
 Excuse me for a while.Clive asked me out to a movie ! Do you want to join us ? 
 So what ? 
 Hey , Jim . Wake up ! 
 You'd better get up or you'll be late . 
 Yes , It has . It went off 30 minutes ago . 
 Rise and shine , sleepyhead . 
 Were you able to contact the owners about my counter-offer ? 
 I hope that they accepted the counter-offer . 
 Will the home inspection cost me a lot ? 
 Is it my choice as to who inspects this house ? 
 How long until you contact the sellers with my acceptance ? 
 Can I help you , Ma'am ? 
 Cool phone . What kind of phone card do you want ? 
 Then the M-Zone will be suitable . 
 You know students use tested message service . And they provide favorable service for that . 
 Oh , there is a sales promotion for it now . 
 If you buy a pre-paid phone card worth 100 yuan today , you will get 50 yuan for free . 
 Sure . As many as you want . 
 Good morning . Please come into my office . 
 I see that you have some impressive writing experience . 
 Wonderful . I ’ d like to know why you ’ re interested in this position at our paper . 
 I don't believe it . 
 You are not serious ? 
 I can believe that . 
 Yes . I know exactly what he looks like . 
 That won't be a problem . 
 I am looking . 
 Yes . He's in the line-up . 
 Number four . 
 It was no problem at all . 
 Oh , sorry . Cross my fingers . 
 Including my keys ? 
 All right . What shall I do now ? 
 I've got film in my bag . 
 That's fine . 
 Sure . Here you are . 
 Am I through now ? 
 Thank you and goodbye . 
 Have you got anything cheaper ? 
 May I try it on ? 
 All right . I think I'll take it . 
 Great idea ! I do it every so often . 
 Yep . If you are a good singer , your audience will feel comfortable , right ? 
 I remembered Tom is always out of tune . We burst into laughter . 
 So tricky ! 
 How did you know that I love red roses ? 
 ( at the dance ) That band is playing good music . Shall we dance ? 
 Foxtrot . Oh . you're a good dancer . 
 I prefer the old style of dance because I enjoy holding a pretty girl like you closely . 
 I can ’ t believe that Obama won . 
 I know ! He just made history ! 
 I did . Did you ? 
 I am so happy that he is our new President ! 
 I hope that he brings change to America . 
 I have faith in our new President . 
 Still , you should not let down your guard . Some details should be paid attention to . 
 You can also ask the interviewer about your performance today . 
 And it's best to ask about the second interview if necessary . 
 You can ask questions about the position you are applying for . 
 Of course . 
 Besides , remember to make acknowledgments through an E-mail or a call . 
 When I was a kid , there was a weather who said there is no such thing as bad weather . 
 He said there are only all kinds of good weather . 
 Well , for one , we have an excuse to stay home . 
 I know that there is hot chocolate in the kitchen and some new Cds just waiting for us . 
 Well , our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . I'm afraid it's very difficult to improve any further on the time . 
 We check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . As new orders keep coming in , they are working three shifts to step up production . I'm sorry , but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill . 
 I said by the middle of October . This is the best we can promise . 
 Good . Let's call it a deal . We'll do our best to advance the shipment to September . The chances are that some of the other orders may be cancelled . But of course you cannot count on that . In any case , we'll let you know by email . 
 We generally insure W . P . ( W . P . A ) on a C . I . F . offer . Special risks , such as TEND ( Theft , Pilferage and Non-delivery ) , leakage , breakage , oil , freshwater , etc . can also be covered upon request . 
 Quite right . According to the usual practice in international trade , special risks are not covered unless the buyer asks for them . 
 Yes , we accept it now , after it has been suspended for many years . However , if you want to have it covered for your imports at your end , you may arrange the insurance as you like . 
 All right , I'll adjust the price accordingly . 
 You're not the only one with a lot to do . We are all in the same boat . 
 You are welcome . Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to interview me . 
 Yes , please . My telephone number is 2974-5328 , and you can call me at any time in the daytime . 
 Great . I will look forward to hearing from you . And do I need the second interview ? 
 Goodbye . 
 No problem , anytime . 
 Okay , thank you . 
 If they wanted to say something about my call last week , why didn ’ t they sand it to me ? 
 Can I see it for a second ? 
 Dear Mr . Clark , Further to our telephone call last Friday , I am writing to confirm our meeting on july 21 . As we discusses , our meeting is to review the contract details . 
 Let ’ s see , ” we would e grateful if you could please send related materials to our office prior to our meeting . ” It looks like ... hey , was there anything else sent along with this letter ? 
 The letter reads , “ please find enclosed a copy of our agenda for your review . ” I don ’ t see anything else in the envelope ... 
 You'll love this . It's a chick drink . 
 Well , that too . I mean that it's kind of sweet . See if you can guess what's in it . 
 Not bad . You really know your booze ... So I guess you know what's in the salsa , too ? 
 Don't tell me you're a salsa expert , too ! 
 I ’ m going to check out tomorrow . Then we ’ ll be back in a week ’ s time . Can I leave my luggage here . 
 About nine thirty in the morning . 
 Sure . 
 1218 . 
 Thank you very much .. Bye . 
 You'll have to take a make-up exam in logic . 
 Sorry to say you failed . 
 How did you get around over there ? Did you rent cars ? 
 I've heard about Enrail passes.So those Europeans really depend on trains a lot . 
 I know . Our train system is lousy.And besides , Americans love their cars too much . 
 It's too bad for the environment . So much pollution from cars . 
 Yes , I agree . I think it is a cultural characteristic.It would be very hard to get us Americans to change this.But you know what ? Probably , in the future , Americans will have to change . 
 Because the earth's environment can't tolerate cars forever . I think cars are already causing global warming.When the problem gets more serious , world governments will have to start limiting car use . 
 Wow ! I didn't notice the time.It ' s almost noon . I have to get home . 
 No , no problem . I have my car in the parking ramp around the corner . 
 See you around . 
 Where was it from ? 
 Jingdezhen ? Isn't it called ' the capital of porcelain ' ? 
 This is the very thing I've been dreaming of . 
 It must be most precious . 
 I want to send some money to Australia . Could you handle it for me ? 
 2,000 AD $ . 
 What is the difference between them ? 
 Well , I think the cable is better . 
 All right . Here you are . 
 Here you are . Thanks a lot . 
 Why , Christine ? I think the one we have is fine . 
 Well , I ’ ll think about it . I don ’ t know whether accounting is going to agree to such a big purchase . 
 No . I don ’ t . Please . 
 I have a little problem , I'm overweight for my height . I think I should go on a diet . 
 I would like to plan a surprise getaway for me and my wife . 
 I think something in the countryside would be nice . 
 Sounds good ! What is the hotel that we will be staying at like ? 
 Wow ! This sounds like something my wife would really enjoy ! Are there any outdoor activities we can take part in ? 
 I ’ m sold ! I want to book this trip . I don ’ t care what it costs ! Money is no object ! 
 I'm afraid I can't . 
 Well , my car won't start . I don't know what's the matter with it . 
 No , I don't think it could be . I checked the battery two days ago.It must be other problems . 
 No , there is plenty of gas . I filled it up yesterday . 
 Yes , that's possible . 
 I did . Let me go get it for you . Here you go . 
 I like the way that the gifts I get increasingly more lavish . 
 So what does it say you should give your wife this first anniversary ? 
 I can think of two things made of paper — stationery and money . 
 I had been doing quite well . In all subjects , I got excellent scores . 
 Yes , I was the top student among my classmates . 
 Quite well . I took the National English Speaking Contest in CCTV 2008 and I got first place . 
 This is Paula Blake , Mr . Simmons . How can I help you ? 
 Certainly , sir . Just tell me your account number please . 
 it's Beethoven . Do you like it ? 
 I don't know about that , but I do think that it helps people relax . 
 actually , I mostly just listen classical music . What about you ? 
 what kind of music do you prefer then ? 
 not really . I don't think pop music has much depth . 
 how long have you been in to pop music , then ? 
 not really . When I was little , we didn't really listen to music at all . 
 well , when I was about 10 years old , I started playing the piano . I think that's how it all started . 
 yes , it's one of my hobbies . 
 Hi Angie , it ’ s Tom Reynolds here . Can you tell me if my tuition fees for this semester have been approved ? 
 Oh wow ! Thanks a million , Angie ! 
 Why not ? What's wrong with it ? 
 Would you like another one ? 
 Hmm ... have you got a receipt ? 
 Yes . I must see your receipt . You can't have your money back without receipt . 
 Good afternoon , Pan Am . May I help you ? 
 Please wait a moment . Let me check for you.The flight is FW 711 and it arrives at 10:00 am . 
 14 hours . 
 The sun is shining . 
 That's the sign of wind . 
 What's the most popular sport in your country ? 
 Do you play table tennis ? 
 What is that you have there ? 
 Ah ha ! I caught you . Just let me peek . I won't tell anyone . 
 How about one little hint ? 
 That's a very good hint . 
 Tomorrow is my first day at work , what do you think I should be wearing ? 
 Indeed , I found most of the employees dress casually when I went to the interview . Only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . It seems that their dress code is not that formal . Probably , I should put on car key and simple shirt . 
 Say , do you go to see your grandparents often ? 
 You are very lucky . 
 My parents called . As usual , they reminded me again that I should have a plan to marry by my late 20s.Easier set than done . Who should I marry ? I have no time to go on a date . 
 I will find one myself , of course . I ’ m a modern girl . 
 You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , I hate that idea . 
 I don ’ t think it makes sense . Three minutes is such a short time . 
 Anyway , I don ’ t want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that . 
 Of course , for these sites , you have to pay a membership fee . But all in all , it is more serious and professional . The chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher . 
 Mary , it's good to see you ! 
 I am so glad that you decided to stop by ! 
 Mary , can I get Josh or you something to drink ? 
 How about a little snack then ? 
 Well then , how is your family ? 
 Let ’ s go to Wangfujing by bus . 
 En , where do we pay the fares ? 
 Do I have to pay an additional fare to change trains ? 
 You must be annoyed about your boyfriend ’ s leaving you , huh ? 
 It ’ s a sad thing . I ’ m ever so sorry ... 
 Are you a smoker ? 
 Would you describe yourself as being a heavy smoker ? 
 When did you begin to smoke ? 
 Might I ask if you have tried to give up smoking ? 
 What time is our connecting flight ? 
 Wow , that's cutting it close ! That means we only have 25 minutes to make the connection ! What gate is it at ? 
 Oh , great ! That's at the other end of the terminal ! 
 I'm be right behind ya ! 
 Study , study , study . I want to learn a lot . 
 Yes . I am going to take some university courses there . 
 Yes , but I think it's probably for the best . 
 Hey , I am a pretty cool guy . I will make friends , and I'll have a lot of extracurricular activities too . You know , like fencing , or theater or something . 
 Sure , I planted them . They're organic . 
 Well , it's a secret . 
 Well , honey , I can teach you how to plant them if you want to learn . 
 It makes me sick . 
 Yes . There is something wrong with my watch . It stopped several hours ago . 
 How much is a battery ? 
 How long will it last ? 
 Here is the money . 
 ( quietly ) I don't understand what the teacher is saying . 
 That's terrible . He speaks too fast . How can I catch his meaning ? 
 I'm not sure whether I can pass the course or not . 
 I want to sign up for some funds units . How do I go about it ? 
 Yes . I've already got a fund account with you too . 
 I'm not quite sure . You see , I already have more than 5,000 RIB in my cash card , but I really don't know how much I should get . 
 That settles it then . 5,000 RIB it is , thanks . 
 I have earned 10,000 a year including bonuses . 
 I like to be paid more than that . Hopefully , 150,000 a year . To be honest , I left the company to get more income . 
 Well , going to a cinema , visiting the galleries , exhibitions and museums , finding and meeting old friends , exercising in the health club or mountain biking . There are so many good choices . 
 Why not start with the most interesting one ? 
 Toss a coin to decide then . 
 I ’ m so excited . 
 I ’ m going back to college . 
 I haven ’ t thought about it yet . 
 You won ’ t see me here again . 
 I know . 
 Thanks . I know things are going to be better . 
 No , thanks . I'm just looking . 
 Sure , I'll let you know if I need anything . Hm , this mattress is very firm . Jack will probably like it . 
 Yes , this mattress is very good . It's pretty firm . The mattress I ’ m now sleeping on is saggy . 
 Does it come with a frame ? 
 That's an attractive plan . I'll think about it . 
 Are you angry , Lisa ? 
 Please don't tell my mom . 
 I'm glad that you see it that way . 
 Thank you so much , Lisa ! 
 Yeah . Water pollution has for a long time been a major concern among the environmental issues . 
 They could generally be divided into two categories , direct and indirect contaminant sources . 
 Yeah . They are emitted directly into urban water supplies . 
 Indirect sources include contaminants that enter the water supply from soils or groundwater systems and from the atmosphere via rainwater . 
 Sure . It's an issue asking for everyone's participation . 
 We can print as many as you like . Just tell me how many . 
 Here's a form to get you started . 
 I think you'll be very pleased with how well we duplicate your old card . 
 Thanks . Come back here next Wednesday to pick up your order , please . 
 If you don't mind paying a little extra , it's absolutely no problem . 
 Basically I get 5,000 RIB every month . It is a well-paid job with satisfying working hours . 
 I require 6,500 RIB per month as a start . This is my bottom line , the minimum salary I can accept . 
 I know clearly at the bottom of my heart . I just can't set my mind at rest because of the child . She's little . She cannot understand us and accept such truth . 
 I see . OK . 
 Here you are . 
 Really ? Ugh ... Is there any difference ? 
 Gee . I must have left it in my hotel room . 
 But when does the plane take off ? 
 Oh , my God ! What do I do now ? Bone head . 
 Is that me ? 
 Oh , thank God . Thank you , I'll be right back . 
 You do ? OK , fine with me . 
 But I also want ya to do me a favor . 
 You gotta have some better deodorant . 
 Hello , this is Dunlin . May I speak to Mrs Smith ? 
 I am calling to say thank you for the interview yesterday . 
 Is there anything I should do ? 
 Thank you . Please call me at any time if you have any questions . 
 No , thank you . Goodbye . 
 I ’ Ve decided to grow my own garden ! 
 On the contrary , I have been reading a lot of books about the subject . 
 Well , first I need to buy some things , such as fertilizer , seeds and tools . 
 You know , the basics . A rake , shovel , spade and a hoe . 
 I ’ ll till the soil and then sow the seeds . I ’ ll then add some fertilizer and voila ! Gardening all done ! 
 Hello , Sir . What can we do for you today ? 
 Now , you can do it via our Atms . It's convenient and easy to use . And we have 4 machines in this branch , so the queues are not usually very long . 
 You just simply follow the instructions on the screen . You can inquire about your account information and use the self-service payment function . 
 I am accomplished in English and computer . Besides , I've got a Teacher's Certificate . 
 Yes . I regard instructor as a decent occupation and I love to be an instructor . 
 Sure ! You should do anything you can to improve your English . 
 Of course it is.In fact , I'll even take the course with you if you want . 
 Do you have the phone number ? I need to call for registration . 
 That's OK . I can get it from you later . 
 All right . I know a great restaurant near here.But , it's a little expensive and I don't have much money with me . 
 Thank you ! I'll be sure to return the favor after our first class , OK ? 
 Good job ! This is going to be a great night ! 
 It's almost 6:00 . I'd better be going . 
 It's really nice of you . Thanks ! 
 Oh . Thanks a million . 
 How beautiful ! I love it at all . 
 It's very kind of you . I really don't know how I can thank you enough . 
 Where do you live now ? 
 Which street do you live on ? 
 Let's come to an agreement to salary . 
 Of course . Here you are . Please read the agreement and sign it . 
 Yes . If you have any question , just ask . By the way , do you know your rights and obligations in this agreement ? 
 Of course , you can believe us . Both sides should act according to the provisions of the agreement . Please sign the agreement . 
 We are done with the agreement . After a three-month probationary period , you will be confirmed in your post . 
 You are welcome . 
 I've only washed my white clothes . 
 Is there any special care I should take with your clothes ? 
 Are there a lot of clothes ? 
 It's a medium load . 
 No big deal . I'll do it for you . 
 You're welcome . 
 Yeah , I could tell that . That ’ s no problem . I can probably get it re-done by tomorrow . When ’ s our meeting with the boss ? 
 Then , we ’ Ve got plenty of time . 
 What about grapes and water melons ? 
 Sure . 
 $ 2 . 
 Well , what do you want to see ? I don't think there are many good movies out right now . 
 Now that's a great plan . It's a date ! 
 Oh , that's my great , great , great , great , great , great , great grandfather . 
 Peter Madsen . A great A if I do say so myself . 
 He loved his family and his countrymen and his freedom . 
 He was . He was friendly toward and showed concern for everyone he met . 
 Is it like a zoo of polar animals ? 
 It must have been fun seeing those unusual animals and birds . 
 Maybe you should let me know about your plan . I want to take my kids there some day . too . 
 Oh ! What a beautiful dress ! It fits you so well.You look so charming in the dress . 
 Where did you buy it ? 
 How much is it ? 
 It's so cheap . I'll buy one , too . 
 Please tell us the exact time when the big fire broke out . 
 But we need the exact time . What time ? 
 Hi , my name ’ s Karl . My wife and I are moving in next door . 
 I ’ m happy to meet you . It seems everyone in town is so friendly . 
 Well , I ’ m from Chicago . There few people take the time to get to know their neighbors . 
 We wanted to live in a more peaceful community and have more space . Another reason is , we can afford to buy a home here , but we can ’ t in Chicago ! 
 Good , let's go for a drive . 
 Great . 
 Sure . Wait a moment . 
 I really enjoy it , especially when it ends up tasting good ! 
 I usually make a few salads for lunch throughout the week and I make dinner about 6 times a week . 
 I do . If you cook at home , you can eat healthy food cheaply . 
 I almost always make either a beef roast or a chicken roast with asparagus , parsnips , peas , carrots and potatoes on Sundays . 
 aside from the Sunday roast , we usually eat dangers and mash , toad-in-the-hole , or fish'n chips once a week . 
 my family loves spicy food . We often eat Chinese , Thai , Indian , or Mexican food when we're in the mood for spice . 
 I absolutely love making mousaka , which is a Greek dish with eggplant . But it takes a lot of time , so I don ’ t often make it . 
 Today is so hot , besides I had so much housework to do . My friend came for a visit and stayed for two hours . I didn ’ t forget , but I had no time at all . 
 Yes . I ’ m sorry . 
 Yes , I ’ m sorry . I know it bothers you very much . But I don ’ t know why Chinese sometimes would do this . 
 But you know if he brought it or not , right ? 
 Calvin , how much money did you spend last weekend ? 
 Why don ’ t you help me save money ? You are always spending money . 
 I ’ m sorry . I guess I ’ m too extreme when it comes putting money in the bank . 
 I'm really curious . What is it like doing housework all day for a living ? 
 I still think that it is a bitstrange that you like to do that kind of thing . Most women would rather hire a maid . 
 How Ay clients do you have already ? 
 Wow . Too bad I don't have a clue about housework . 
 I don't know about you , but I'm famished . Are you interested in getting a bite to eat ? 
 I'd love something spicy . Maybe we could get some Sichuan Hotpot . 
 Sure . If I could , I would eat hotpot every day ! 
 Well , let's stop dragging our feet and find a Sichuan Hotpot restaurant for dinner ! 
 Well ... ? Have you thought of it yet ? 
 Never mind . There's an authentic tasting hotpot restaurant not far from the China World Trade Towers on Chang An Street . Have you been there ? 
 You really have a bid head , don't you ! 
 No , I don't suppose he's to blame.The man in the other car made a mistake . 
 Are you paying in cash or by credit card ? 
 Here's your key , sir . Room number 1405.The bellboy will take your luggage to your room . Have a pleasant stay ! 
 What are you reading ? 
 It seems that English already is the main global language . Does the article suggest that there should be an artificial language like Esperanto as the world language . 
 Does the article say anything about other language ? How will they survive in an English-speaking world ? 
 Right . All the people who speak Chinese . Hindi , French and Spanish aren ’ t suddenly going to stop using those languages . 
 In that case , I shall continue to learning a few basic phrases in other languages . 
 Yes , it's so exciting , though I had the most falls in our skiing team . 
 Of course there is . The top-level coaches there are from the State Sports General Administration . 
 Yes.My face even ached in the icy wind . 
 I was skiing on and on excitedly until I realized one thing-I could not stop ! You can just imagine how terrified I was . 
 Hello , madam , I am sorry for keeping you waiting so long . Now please follow me and I will show you your table . 
 Yes , just as you have ordered . 
 I suppose you like cinematography and costumes and that sort of stuff ? 
 I think sound is even more important ! Guns , bombs , sirens--that's what makes a movie exciting ! 
 In my book , all a good movie needs is a chase scene and lots of things that blow up . 
 Hi , I come to pick up my laundry . This is the invoice . 
 I'm afraid that a button is missing . 
 OK , please . 
 Well , oh my God , there is another problem , I'm afraid . There is still a stain on the shirt . 
 It's been several days now , I am not sure . 
 Oh , that's so bad . I know little about that . Is there a remedy for it ? 
 OK , I will . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 A ticket to London , please . 
 Yes , including London Tube . 
 This is tough to say , Jordan , but I think we should break up . 
 Yes , I mean it . 
 No , we are just too different . This isn ’ t working . 
 I have thought about it for a while . I think it ’ s time to move on for both of us . 
 I ’ m sorry . 
 Then why didn ’ t you talk to me ? 
 I don't want to argue with you anymore . This is going to be tough , but Let ’ s try and be friends . 
 I think we ’ ll be better off if we are apart . 
 Sure , let ’ s just be friends . 
 I was wondering if you guys also tailor clothes ? 
 Well , I ’ m looking to get a custom-made suit . 
 Can you make sure you leave a little extra space in the collar ? My neck gets easily irritated . 
 You might also want to leave a little extra room in the waist area . I tend to gain a few pounds over the holidays . 
 Mom , my nose is bleeding . 
 No , mom . I didn't . 
 Mom ! I was just picking my nose , and now it's bleeding . 
 Not a lot . What about you ? 
 That sounds like fun . 
 I'm sorry . I'm already doing something this Friday . 
 My family and I are going to dinner . 
 I'll definitely try to make it the next time . 
 All right . I'll see you next time . 
 Study English . 
 It gives me great satisfaction . 
 I don't mind the work . I think it's worthwhile . 
 I would like to return this book . 
 I would also like to check out this magazine . 
 Why is that ? 
 What things am I allowed to check out ? 
 I really need to check out this magazine . 
 That ’ s stupid . 
 Yes . I miss you very much . 
 Have you graduated from college ? 
 So , got any more ideas for the website ? 
 But we registered at Macy's . People can just buy gifts there . 
 You're right . They can discuss what to get and avoid buying the same things . 
 Any other ideas ? 
 And we were going to make a collage for each of us using our baby pictures ... 
 No . He has no idea what a fat little pig I was ! 
 Give me five more minutes . I'm really tired this morning . 
 I get that , but let me just sleep for a little bit longer . 
 Believe me . I will get up and get ready in five minutes . 
 I understand , and it will get done after I wake up in five minutes . 
 I'm going to be on time today . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 It's a perfect fit . 
 Cash , credit card , or debit card ? 
 Your signature here , please , and we're finished . 
 Bye-bye . Visit us again soon ! 
 I'd be glad to . He's really cute . 
 I hate to complain , but this soup is too salty . 
 I would like to watch the Oscars on tv tonight . How about you ? 
 I like watching it for the fashion . I like to see what the ladies are wearing . Of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo . 
 I ‘ m really not sure . Usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders . 
 You might think this strange , but I like the category for best foreign language film . 
 Excuse me , but could you give me some change ? 
 I want to make a long distance phone call . 
 Miss , may I help you ? 
 It's because of the view . 
 Sure . Please take a look at the model of the building . Nice Garden has a total of two blocks which are labeled Block I and Block II . Block I has a total of thirty-eighth floors . The thirty-seventh and thirty-eighth are penthouses . There are four units in one floor . The sizes of the units are one thousand square feet and one thousand and five hundred square feet . The size with one thousand square feet has three bedrooms and the biggest size has four bedrooms . 
 There are three elevators between one hundred and forty-eight units . 
 There are a total of one hundred and sixty parking spaces on the second and third floor , in which twelve are for visitors and the rest are for residents . 
 Sure , on the fourth floor is a recreation quarter . There are two swimming pools . One is Olympic standard size and the other one is for children . Also , there is a gymnasium for resident members only . 
 The completion date will be July 1st 2007 . 
 Please check up the price list . The average unit price is five million Hong Kong dollars . There are eight different banks that will provide a seventy percent mortgage loan . Also , the developer will offer another ten percent mortgage to purchasers . 
 It's all written on the brochure price list . I believe there will be one right for you . Please hurry up because almost half of units have already gone . 
 You're welcome . 
 Try to keep cool . It's not an easy take . 
 Then you will be in line for a doom . 
 Yes , please . We ’ re on my way out . You can put up make up sign on . Could you bring us some towels and hangers . 
 He has come to life in the end . 
 Yes . Fortunately , an ambulance passed in the nick of time , and we got him away to hospital . 
 Wish him to be healthy soon . 
 Is everything OK ? 
 What exactly seems to be the matter ? 
 Do you think that you should go to the Student Health Center ? 
 Do you need someone to drive you home ? 
 Well , go home and rest up . Make sure you check the website for your assignments . 
 Is this Ann ? 
 Ann , this is Sam . Look , Ann . I wanna see you again . How about a drink tonight ? 
 What about tomorrow evening ? 
 But Ann .. 
 Chicken , please . 
 What kind of drinks do you have ? 
 In that case , let me have a glass of orange juice . 
 I would like to have some tea as well . 
 I see . 
 Sure . It's probably a skiing show . Adam told me there are many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors . 
 Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show . 
 They are all great skiers and very experienced . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim . 
 Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine . 
 It's possible . 
 I can hardly make ends meet these days . 
 my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise . 
 definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month . 
 is that inflation ? 
 has the government taken some measures to curb it ? 
 but I'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy . 
 how ? 
 sounds a good idea . 
 Of course , Mr . Roberts . But , could you tell me his extension number again ? I haven ’ t got all the numbers down yet . 
 Thank you very much . Mr . Roberts . 
 Same here . Hey , did you know Susan is going to get married . She invited me to her wedding and she wants you to attend also . 
 Definitely . I'm calling to tell you this . 
 She tried , but the line is always busy . 
 Of course . It's 555-4653 . 
 Pretty good . I've just bought a new house . 
 In the suburb . How are you and Carol ? Still living in town ? 
 Okay . Don't forget to call Susan . 
 Do you have desserts ? 
 Can you give us more information ? 
 I would like to have the coffee rum pies . 
 Please put your name and address here . May I see your passport . 
 How would you like it ? 
 Ok , here you are . 
 Fifth Avenue . 
 I should have ? 
 Do you live in the red house at the end of the road ? 
 We also have a cat and a dog . 
 No . My father takes the dog for a walk every Monday , Tuesday and Sunday . 
 Who takes the dog on Saturday ? 
 Do you help with the housework ? 
 Excuse me , I'm looking for your casual short-sleeved shirts . Can you tell me where those are ? 
 Medium . 
 Thank you . I think I'll take this one , and these pants as well . They're a present for a friend . 
 Yes , please .

 I was born in Beijing in 1965 . 
 Really ? Thank you . 
 Look , Elaine Robinson and I do not get along . 
 That has nothing to do with it ... 
 I do . 
 Can you tell me a little bit about yourself ? 
 Please explain why you are interested in leaving your current position and please elaborate on your technical skills . 
 Where do you see yourself five years from now ? 
 What's the matter , Lisa ? You don't look too good . 
 You mean Mark ? He seems like such an honest guy . 
 Two months ? How did you find out ? 
 So you asked him about the girl who called ? 
 What'd he do ? 
 Indiscretion ? How can an indiscretion last two months ? I mean , you two have been married for two years ! How can he do that to you ? 
 Good . I totally agree with what you did . 
 great . My family came to visit me . 
 my immediate family is very large . It's my mother , my father , my two older brothers , my younger sister and me . 
 I thought you were the only child in the family . Didn't China practice the only-child policy in the early 1980s ? 
 interesting . What do you think about families with only one child ? 
 do you get along well with each other ? 
 you are very lucky to have such a nice family . 
 Hello . Manchester 6739792 . 
 Nicholas ? Nicholas Nickleby ? No . He doesn't live here any more . He's moved to Morecambe . 
 Yes . I've got it somewhere . Let me see . Where did I put it ? Ah - I remember , it's on the memo . Here it is . Do you have a pen to write it down ? 
 His number's 4945939 . 
 Is that room service ? 
 May I ask for a wake-up call tomorrow morning ? 
 6:30 . My room number is 305 . 
 Yes , I think we might be free . What did you have in mind ? 
 That sounds great . Is it casual ? 
 That sounds good . It will give my wife a chance to dress up . 
 That sounds wonderful . Will there be anyone there that I know ? 
 Great ! I'll look forward to it . We'll make sure and check the mail for our invitation . 
 I consider the hero's acting is inferior to that of the heroine's . don't you agree ? 
 Excuse me . Do you know how to get to the mall ? 
 Do you know the address ? 
 Can you write it down for me please ? 
 Is it faster if I take Highland avenue ? 
 I think you're right . Thank you . 
 Yes , we do . They are all in this book . 
 No problem . Just give us a few minutes more to pull them up , though . We don ’ t get that many English singers ! 
 What do you plan to do for your birthday ? 
 How about a party at home ? That way we can get together and celebrate it . 
 Tom and Helen got married at last . 
 I was invited to attend their wedding . 
 How moving love is . 
 I'd love to . 
 That's OK with me . 
 They are reports of our company . 
 No , they are filed according to dates . 
 No problem , here you are . 
 Yes . I ’ m looking for something to wear to a formal party . 
 Medium , a woman ’ s size 10 or 12 . 
 Yes . 
 That ’ s a great idea . I ’ ll try it on . 
 It feels very good . 
 Okay . I ’ ll take it . Thank you very much . 
 I am currently the highest bidder for your shirt . I was wondering about the size . 
 How is the condition ? How old is it ? 
 Why didn't you return the shirt or exchange it ? 
 Do you play mahjong ?

 Yes , dad , it was . 
 It was long , too . 
 But it went by fast . It was interesting . 
 I'll give you a speech like that , too . 
 Of course . 
 You have lots of friends . They will be there , too ! 
 Yes , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 Sure . There's network of canals . And there are white walls , black tiles , small bridges , flowing rivers , flagstones roads , blue sky and white clouds . Few places have preserved the past like this place . Walking on the ancient road makes us back to our sense . 
 Zhouzhuang . 
 It's about two days . 
 It's about 300 yuan . 
 That's all right . May you have a good trip ! 
 My pleasure . 
 That's very kind of you to say so . Let's try some after-dinner wines . 
 Do you prefer brandy or ports . 
 Excellent choice . I love its smooth flavor . 
 Yes . You always have a good nose for wines . 
 Oh , what's that ? 
 Why not ? It sounds great . 
 Thanks . Cheers . 
 Let's go for a drink after work . 
 I'll be willing to come and talk about the financing of our imports . 
 What about a draft at 120 days sight ? 
 A bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . You can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due . 
 I hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries . 
 Gosh , it's 7:30 , I'll miss the first class . 
 Yes , Mum . 
 No , who won ? 
 Really ? I'm surprised . I didn't know his English was that good . 
 Isn ’ t that Michael Johnson ? I think he set a world record in this race . 
 Are you sure ? What about Carl Lewis ? He won four golds , didn ’ t he ? 
 I like the way Carl runs . He looks more graceful . 
 Not at all . But I've found satisfaction in it ! 
 No , I never do that . 
 I don't want to mark my table , of course . 
 I'm sorry . I thought you wouldn't come back so early . 
 Oh , you've got a good memory . 
 Yes , could I make a reservation to New York on July 21st , next Friday ? 
 That's too bad . What's the earliest flight available ? 
 What about the fight schedule ? 
 Is it a non-stop flight ? 
 Sounds good . I'd like to take this flight . 
 Economy class . 
 Edward Smith . 
 Yes , many thanks . Goodbye . 
 Mary and Tom are breaking up . 
 Mary said she couldn't put up with Tom , for he fell in love with another woman . 
 No , I don't think so . She said she would rather be single than cope with an unhappy marriage . 
 Betty and I will throw a dinner party this weekend , we ’ d like you to come . 
 Sure . We ’ ll be looking forward to that day . 
 Hello , so how are we feeling today ? 
 Am I correct in thinking that you are here for your annual physical ? 
 Your basic physical exam will include lungs , heart , blood levels , and eyes , ears , and nose . 
 We can do an allergy test , and later I can send you for an asthma test . 
 I am going to check your cholesterol , blood sugar , and white blood cell count . 
 Good morning sir , I come to fetch me suit . 
 Here you are . 
 Well , I think the waist is a little tight and the sleeves are too long . 
 He has worked five years in that bank . 
 You said it.Let ' s ask him to work in our bank . 
 How's the bride-to-be ? 
 Just relax . With me as your maid of honor , everything will be fine ! 
 Hey ! I'm the tour guide . I'll take care of the Taiwanese guests . 
 I will . Don't worry ! 
 Let's just park here . 
 Oh , the policeman's coming . 
 I register this Friday . 
 I really want to take the communication class , but I don't know if it will be available . 
 Yeah . I tried to get in last semester , but it was full by the time I registered . 
 I still need to take English 201 , but I really don't like writing . 
 Oh really ? Who was the instructor ? There are like 4 different instructors to choose from . 
 Is he an easy grader ? 
 Do you mind if I ask you what you got ? 
 Well , what did you get in English 101 last year ? 
 Well , I can't compare to you . I got a 3.1 in English 101 . That means if you got a lower grade in English 201 , it must be harder . 
 Oh . That helps . Thanks . 
 Sure , what is it ? 
 I'm sorry . I've been having some problems . 
 Yes . I'm fond of playing the chess and I'm very keen on playing cards . 
 Both , but the rules of playing cards vary in different places . 
 No . It's all Greek to me . 
 I know that . I mean I couldn't understand her at all . 
 I wish you the best of luck . 
 Can You tell me how many you want to buy ? 
 Well . then , 260 yuan each . 
 I'm afraid we can't go as high as that . You know we usually don't give any discount . but considering the newly established business relationship between us , I could give you 3 % off the list price . 
 OK . OK . I don't want to haggle with you . Let's say , how about 3.5 % ? 
 Have you heard that new song by the Beastie Boys ? 
 It's not much different from that heavy metal music you like so much . 
 Hey , you can dance to rap music ! 
 Let ' s got out tomorrow night . We can go to a bar and try to find you a girlfriend . 
 Maybe you just need a few pick-up lines , you know , break the ice . 
 Come on ! You can just walk up to a girl and say “ If you were a booger I \ ' d pick you first . ” 
 Fine , then you can say , “ So there you are ! I ' Ve been looking all over for YOU , the woman of my dreams ! ” 
 Yeah , so you make her laugh , you make a fool of yourself a little bit and then you buy her a drink . 
 Nice ! Let ' s go ! 
 Yes , let me have this roast beef special . 
 I will have the green peas and make sure the beef is well done . 
 A cup of coffee , please , with cream and sugar . 
 Oh , yes . 
 What comes with the special ? 
 I think I will have a dish of Vanilla ice cream . 
 Waiter , may I have my check , please ? 
 How many passengers are there aboard the ship ? 
 you're rather energetic today . What's going on ? 
 free coffee is one of the perks at this place , isn't it ? 
 not that well . I've got that Monday morning feeling today . 
 my boss has been breathing down my neck all day . I can't wait for the weekend ! 
 you can say that again ! He won't even let us check our personal email at work ! 
 really ? I didn't know that it was against company policy . 
 no , he is . Some bosses will bend the rules a bit sometimes , but not my boss . He always follows the rules to a T . 
 thanks . I better get back to my work before my boss yells at me again ! 
 alright . See you later ! 
 I think he should be an expert of everything . 
 Because English is nothing but a tool which is used when people may negotiate in international conferences , probe into physics , release some information in a press conferrence , and do anything we can do with language . Therefore , an interpreter has to know some expertise in the field he / she serves as an interpreter . Otherwise he / she can not carry out his / her work smoothly . 
 Don't worry . He'll cross that bridge when he comes to it . My son reads a lot on his computer and uses e-mail to send messages to his friends almost every day . He's really absorbed by the discussions . 
 I guess using a computer has a great deal to do with human interaction . Getting in touch with each other must be more fun to your wife and my son than the coolest computer games or the hottest information . 
 Are you kidding ? Don't you know I can't swim ? 
 Hey , don't shout . Come here ! Sit closer . Now , Jim , we ’ Ve had a lovely day . Don't spoil it now . 
 Everybody who walks past me sees it . Besides , it's a good sunbathing suit . 
 Jim ! 
 Can you get me a beach umbrella and a deck chair ? I am really tired of lying in thousand . 
 Are you serious ? That will be wonderful ! 
 There are a few considerations . Is this a part-time or full-time job ? 
 Basically , you really don ’ t need to do much of anything . On the Continued Claim Form , you will note that you now have a new job and also note what you are earning . 
 You will not mess up your job benefits by taking work . You can always come back and notify EDD that you are once again in need of assistance . 
 He's out of John's hands . Nothing he can do about such a black sheep . 
 Nice dress . How do I look ? Be honest . 
 Well , that top is a little too tight , and those jeans aren ’ t dressy enough . And I don ’ t feel comfortable with that . What do you think , Vicky ? You ’ Ve been very quiet up to now . 
 Please give me a piece of ' New York Daily ' . 
 Really ? Is there ' Wall Street Journal ' , please ? 
 I have a long flight for ten hours . I need to choose a magazine . 
 Give me the latest issue of ' National Geographic ' . 
 Here you are . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 All right . This way , please . 
 Yes , sir . 
 Yes , they are all distinctive Chinese . 
 How do you like this one ? It's very beautiful . 
 350 yuan . 
 The weather has been terrible this week . 
 Let's hope it clears up . 
 What'd you like , madam ? 
 No , just a few minutes . 
 Not too bad . It is seemingly too hard for me to find a place for our date . 
 She said she wanted to go Dutch in dating . 
 But I am still traditional , so I felt weird when she paid for herself . 
 Are you satisfied with your girlfriend ? 
 Professor Li , do you know where to buy art supplies ? 
 No . I can't paint . I'm asking for my niece . She is really into it . 
 She is eight . Actually , I'm buying a good set of art supplies for her as a birthday gift . 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 OK . What kind of gas do you want ? 
 We have regular , super , and premium gasoline . This is a new car , so I'd recommend premium . 
 All right , sir . You will park at refueling 4 . 
 Your car's ready . 
 Ten gallons of premium . That's $ 18.56 , please . 
 Thank you , sir . Have a nice drive ! 
 When will you set out ? 
 OK . There is one on Wednesday . 
 Eight hundred yuan . 
 No . It doesn't . But it includes all other on board activities . 
 Why don ’ t we go the cinema tonight ? 
 I think there ’ s a very romantic new film starring Hugh Grant . Let ’ s go and see that . 
 Well how about meeting at my place ? 
 Mr . : Hello , Mary . 
 Mr . : I'm Mr . Taylor , and I'm your counselor . I'm going to show you around the school . 
 Mr . : Right here is the cafeteria . 
 Mr . : But not big enough . And here is our computer room . 
 Mr . : And over here is our gymnasium . 
 Mr . : Just like everyone else . 
 On 20th May 1963 . 
 27th day of the fourth month . 
 It will begin at five thirty . 
 You can see it tomorrow . 
 See you . 
 My child is often absent-minded in class . 
 But if he doesn't listen to the teacher carefully , he won't learn anything . 
 I hope so . 
 Thank you very much , David . It's an excellent birthday gift . 
 What happened ? 
 That's serious . 
 So now Mexican pesos are worth about half as much . 
 Wow . I feel sorry for the Mexicans . But it's good for us . 
 Yes , and you know what ? 
 I don't really like this hotel that much.So tonight , now that we are so rich , tonight why don't we stay in the most expensive hotel in town ? 
 Good morning.My name's Pat Green . 
 I read in the poster that you're looking for a student to work as a language assistant . 
 I think so.But before I apply , could you tell me more about the work ? 
 I used cassette recorders a lot when I studied English in high school . 
 How many hours would I work a day and what's the pay ? 
 OK , I'll take it . 
 Hi there , Mr Brown . Are you depositing or withdrawing today ? 
 I understand . So , what would you like to do with the balance ? 
 215,000 RIB is the exact balance . If you could just sign your name here . 
 Hi , Zina . Lots of people are looking for you . 
 Like Elvin . He isn't too happy about what you promised Stars.com . 
 You do realize that it isn't humanly possible for us to finish by next week ? 
 That would definitely make a difference . But Vince already said no . 
 And you ’ re going to completely transform your eating habits , right ? 
 I ’ Ve heard this one before . 
 Well , I guess we ’ ll just have to wait and see . 
 Waiter , bill , please . 
 What's this for ? 
 I see . 
 Yes . please . 
 Bill Black , Room 1201 . 
 Sure . Here it is . 
 Yes , here is your reservation . You have a standard room reserved for two nights . Is that right ? 
 Oh , my mistake . The reservation is for a suite and it is a non-smoking room with a king bed . I'm sorry for the error . 
 Sure , that's no problem . May I have your credit card ? We need a credit card on file for your room charges and incidentals . 
 Okay , now if you could please verify the room rate here , initial next to the X , and sign right here . How many keys will you need ? 
 Okay , you're all set . You're in room 1201 . Take the elevators to the 12th floor and it will be on your left . Do you need any help with your bags ? 
 Enjoy your stay . 
 I'm with you , Jane . 
 Well , uh ... I didn't catch the last part . 
 What are your hobbies , Mr . Green ? 
 But it's an expensive hobby , isn't it ? 
 I usually play chess with my friends . But I like playing basketball best . 
 No , I'm not very good at it . I play just for the fun of it . 
 OK , that'd be very nice . 
 I had a drop too much last night . I attended a banquet given by a Chinese colleague of mine . And it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a Chinese table . 
 I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me . But if I keep gulping down one cup after another , I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick . 
 a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood . 
 I got you . Next time . I'll preface a toast with a statement like ' I can't drink any more ' and then drink anyway . 
 I ’ m all right , thanks . Just a little tired . 
 Yeah , I got home around two . 
 I'm back . My bid on the Buddha is still the highest ! 
 Don't you want to hear more about my statue ? 
 His name is not fat boy ! You can be so rude sometimes . 
 I could go for that . But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year . 
 We should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away . How about the countryside ? There must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air . 
 Tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist . What about next Monday ? 
 No need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know . 
 Great ! Oh , one more thing , don't forget to check the weather before we go . I'd hate to get caught in the rain . 
 Me , too . Now let's make a list for what we need to with us . 
 Exactly what ? 
 What's the matter ? 
 What happened before ? 
 Oh , no . That's bad news . 
 Will you lose all your files ? 
 You're smart . 
 Okay , well it ’ s always more difficult to describe them isn ’ t it ? 
 Well as I mentioned before , I do tend to get frustrated if I don ’ t see progress in my work or career . I suppose I ’ m quite a restless character . My father always taught me to be a high achiever so . 
 Well , in a way yes . But I must say that even if I ’ m not completely happy in my work I always give 110 % I would never shirk my responsibilities . I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon . 
 Yes , please . 
 I'm afraid you've got the wrong extension number . 
 OK . Hold on , please . 
 Mr.Cook is on Line Six . I'll put you through . 
 You are welcome . 
 That's what I am going to do . 
 I surely will . How much is this wood carving ? 
 That's OK . Is anything else recommended ? 
 I'd like to see some traditional arts . 
 Yes , I'm just here to pick out some special presents for my foreign friends . 
 Sounds good . I'll take paper-cut . 
 You collect them yourself ? I think that you are just doing the wholesale . 
 Wow , you are the expert on it . 
 Nice to meet you , I'am Seven . I don't think I ' Ve seen you around before . 
 What do you do there ? 
 I ' Ve beaning worked IBM for years . I am vested personnel file system , He is the after sale survise director . he such a nice boss , I like working for him . 
 Yes , That's him over there-the taller , handsome one . Would you let me introduce you ? 
 I'd like to get my laundry . 
 Here you are . 
 Can you sew on these buttons ? 
 How much for the shirts ? 
 Here's the money , keep the change . 
 You ’ re new here , right ? 
 Will this be your first year ? 
 What school did you come from ? 
 Why ’ d you transfer here ? 
 Is PCC a good school ? 
 I hope you enjoy it here . 
 What are your weekend arrangements ? 
 What sort of things are you interested in ? 
 I love swimming and cycling . On Sunday morning I have swimming practice for an hour . In the afternoon , I just ride my bike around the city or along the country roads for almost two hours . 
 Mostly in the city's swimming pool . But on occasion , I go to the beach with friends . Well , what do you do at leisure ? 
 Good.You really know how to enjoy yourself . 
 Oh , I forgot . 
 I ’ m so sorry ! OK , so you just want a simple message on it . 
 I ’ m on it ! 
 Sure he can . He can shake hands , roll over , and even play dead . 
 Yeah , but sometimes Bingo wants to play with me , but I don't have time . 
 My little brother likes to play with him . He even gives him a bath every week . 
 You know , you're right . Maybe you should get a dog . 
 Really ? 
 Sounds great . 
 How nice . 
 Good . 
 What do you want to do ? 
 That will make him so happy . 
 One that won't grow up too big . 
 Do you know which one he would like ? 
 I bet you had to drag him away . 
 I wonder what he'll name it . 
 Sure , anything you say . 
 Don ’ t worry about it , just ask . 
 You need to know the type of shoes you want . 
 The shoes can be comfortable or not comfortable , too wide , too narrow , or just right ; and long or short . In girls shoes , the heel can be high or low . 
 Don't be shy . Have some more chicken . 
 Hi . I ’ m here to catch flight 513 to New York . 
 Here you are . Do you need to see my passport ? 
 Mmmm ... a photo I . D . I have my New Jersey driver ’ s license . Is that ok ? 
 Actually it wad taken just last year , but I had a shaved head and a beard . Can you still recognize me ? 
 Yes , One suitcase . I also have a carry-on bag . 
 Oh , George , what a beautiful day it is today ! The sun is hot and there are just a few clouds scattered here and there ! What a perfect day to be at the beach ! The kids are going to have so much fun ! A 
 There we go . Can you help me with the umbrella ? Perfect . 
 And stay in the shallow area . I don ’ t want to see you go any farther than that sandbar ! It ’ s too deep out there and we didn ’ t bring your floatier . 
 What is that ? A jellyfish ? Jeremy , put that down right now ! It could sting you ! 
 Come on , Mary . We have to do the laundry . 
 Down to the basement . 
 Yes . We have a dryer , too . 
 They are in the basement already . 
 Don't you know that we have a laundry chute in the house ? 
 Well , I just saw a horror movie last night . It almost frightened me to death . 
 I don't care for a detective film . It also makes me nervous . 
 No , I don't think comedies today are natural or cheerful . 
 No , romance is boring . 
 Let's go to see a war movie , shall we ? 
 Certainly . Is there anything wrong ? 
 Hello . 9-1- 1 . Can I help you ? 
 What happened ? 
 Give me your address . 
 All right . The police and an ambulance are on the way . In the meantime , find a clean cloth and press it firmly over the wound . This will slow the bleeding . 
 Help will be there in just a few minutes . 
 Sure . Let ’ s go . What are you going to have done ? 
 A foot massage sounds like a great idea . They are very relaxing . I ’ d also like to have mudpack on my face . It ’ s supposed to help with your complexion . 
 This could become a very expensive trip to the beauty parlor ! 
 Oh , I agree . We both work hard and a little beauty treatment can relieve stress . 
 What ’ s special about a thai massage ? 
 Sounds painful ! 
 And what does that entail ? 
 How can I do that ? 
 It's been a long time , Mrs , Lee . 
 When did you come back ? Did you have a good time ? 
 I will . How would you like your hair today ? The same style as usual ? 
 That's true . Here are some samples of hairstyles . What do you think about this one ? 
 Very well . You aren't in a hurry , are you ? 
 Ok . The manicurist will be right here . 
 It's 90 dollars in all . 
 All right . What would you like to drink ? 
 Regular or large ? 
 OK . Anything else ? 
 For here or to go ? 
 Are you going to tell me about the stamp , or not ? 
 I'm just asking . It's not like I'd actually make a bid . 
 Don't worry . I won't . 
 Have fun getting ripped off ! 
 Yes . 
 Nothing . The landlord pays . 
 Yes . Each apartment has one . 
 Yes . But you need to pay $ 60 for it each month . 
 Yes . We set up the new alarm system a few months ago . 
 Of course we do . It is the landlord ’ s responsibility . 
 Yes . 
 Can you show me some traditional Chinese arts and crafts ? 
 Would you show me some ? 
 They really smell fragrant . How much is a real sandalwood fan ? 
 I'll take two small ones and a big one . 
 I'm afraid not . 
 How are you doing today ? 
 What may I do for you ? 
 What do you need help with ? 
 Have you looked in the periodicals ? 
 I can show you where they are . 
 Follow me , please . 
 We have a class outing today . 
 Trina , will you marry me ? 
 Oh , Babe , I can ’ t wait to spend the rest of my life with you ! I can ’ t wait for all the adventures we ’ re going to have , for all the fights and the laughter . I can ’ t wait to grow old and wrinkly with you . 
 She what ? 
 Four hundred ? 
 Ah ... 
 Wow . 
 If I survive the next six months . 
 No . I ’ m serious . I ’ m going to quit my job . 
 It ’ s true . But I can ’ t show my abilities . 
 Your present job is something better . Why do you change ? 
 Haven't seen you for a long time 
 I bet you had a wonderful time 
 Sounds great 
 I bought it when I was on vacation in Nepal . 
 I really do not have time to deal with some lovesick computer geek . 
 Sorry , Dave , I didn't mean you . I am just not in the mood for this . I have work to do . 
 Bob , you're so lucky that you've come at the right time-the 2005 International Tourism Festival is around the corner . 
 My pleasure . Well , the festival is going to start on the third Saturday of October , and covers over one hundred diverse programs in one month . 
 I don't know what to suggest . There're so many attractions , and they all sound interesting . One exciting program might be the Ten Thousand People Cycling round the Town . You can choose from the five routes that lead to different destinations . 
 Then you can take Route No . 5 . Next I would suggest the International Dragon Boat Race where you can watch Lion Dance , Dragon Boat racing , and many other water shows . 
 Can you deliver it , please ? 
 In Camden Town . 
 All right . But I'm only in on Saturday . 
 Afternoon , please , if that's possible . 
 He is in his bedroom . He has been in a bad mood after school . 
 Yeah . He told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor . 
 Yes , I agree . We can see the scenery better . In a bus , all you see are the roads . 
 I agree . Buses bounce too much . After two or three hours , you feel too tired . 
 Beautiful . 
 I don't know if it will turn out good.The window might cause the picture to be blurry . 
 Great minds think alike . 
 Just so-so . Where did you get it ? 
 I'd much rather buy expensive but good quality clothing , because it is not only nice but lasts a long time . 
 It was nice talking to you too . 
 That would be fun . 
 I think we should go out to eat . 
 All right , so I'll see you then . 
 Okay , I'll talk to you later then . 
 Bye . 
 I'm splendid . How about yourself ? 
 So , have you been on the bus very long ? 
 How often do you ride the bus ? 
 You have your own vehicle ? 
 So then , why don't you drive it ? 
 Smart . 
 So , this 500 RIB is worthless ? 
 Right , I see . Let me give you another 500 RIB . 
 Thanks . Now can I make the full deposit ? 
 Sam , what shall I do with my stocks ? Will I lose money ? 
 What do you mean by that ? 
 Is that so ? 
 Ah , ah , ah ... 
 Jog ? 
 Walk ? 
 Oh no . 
 Oh , dear . 
 Oh no . 
 Dance class ! I don't know how . 
 Oh ... 
 I was going to eat in , I'm short on cash . 
 In that case , I'm with you . Em.this is good . 
 Are you on the up and up ? 
 If you asked me , you've got a screw loose somewhere . 
 Fat chance , I'm too scared of bungee jumping . 
 What did that have to do with me ? I'm not the self-seeker like you . 
 I had a sneaking suspicion about you , Eric , I think you've lost it . 
 Hello , Is this room service ? 
 This is the room 1425 , we asked for the room service an hour ago . 
 What's the matter ? 
 Is it really going to take that long , will you rush the order ? 
 ha , well , we have no choice . 
 No , really ? 
 Who will be there ? 
 That is good . He can leave you alone this time . 
 Yes , I'd like to book a table for two this evening . 
 7:30 . By tho way , I would like a table next to the window . 
 Good afternoon.can I be of any assistance to you ? 
 Here are the suits . Which one would you like ? 
 Did you bring some lunch with you ? 
 Wow , that looks beautiful . 
 I might try it myself . 
 Carrie , are you ok ? You seem a bit down . 
 Maybe it ’ s just that he is stressed out from work or something . He does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know . 
 Men are like that you know.They can feel nervous , anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness . 
 Talk to him , try to cheer him up when he is down and if that doesn ’ t work , I say get rid of him and get a new one ! 
 Thank you for lending me the book . 
 But I'm not used to looking up every new word when I'm reading a novel . I only look up the most necessary ones . 
 He's out of the hospital and up and about again at last . 
 May I help you ? 
 I'm Mary Kelly . May I ask your name ? 
 I'm glad to meet you , Mr . Zhuang . Sit down , please . 
 What are your qualifications for being a clerk typist ? 
 Would you be willing to take a typing and shorthand test ? 
 ( After testing ) Your typing and stenography are pretty good . Would you be interested in applying for the job ? 
 All right . You need to have an interview with our manager , Mr . McBride . Let's go to his office . 
 This really has been a wonderful holiday for us . Shall we take a walk around the pond or into those woods for a while ? 
 No , not really . I had thought we'd stay in Hamburg tonight , but we can't unless we rush it . Let's stay in Bremen instead . Tomorrow we can have lunch in Hamburg , then check into a hostel in Copenhagen and have dinner there . 
 Sure . We can walk around to that path that leads into the woods there . Hey , look ! There are some wild ducks over there in the reeds . 
 I used to go hunting with my uncle , that's how . 
 Do you think I should turn down his offer ? 
 But we may not get another partner . 
 Excuse me.We ordered too much.May we take the food home ? 
 Do we have to pay extra charge for that ? 
 Well , then , will you put this and that into doggie bags ? 
 Thanks.Would you do me another favor ? 
 Some more Chinese tea for us , please . 
 I was thinking of holding the company retreat in the mountains . 
 I was thinking it could take place sometime in January . 
 Yes , you are right . 
 Yes , that would work out better . 
 Good idea ! We'll have to get right on it . 
 Office software like Windows might be one of the best inventions in this information age . It saves us from so much work and makes the communication even around the world much easier . 
 Yes , this machine is even smaller than those before . 
 You know our boss always trying to save the last penny . We have to use up the equipment first . 
 well , I nearly always get up at dawn . I don ’ t like sleeping in late . The days are longer in summer that in winter , so I get up in summer . I usually do some exercise when I get up . 
 I usually have cereal , but sometimes I cook a traditional English breakfast . 
 I usually do housework in mornings . I go shopping occasionally . I like to do all my shopping in one bag trip to the supermarket . I always drive to the big supermarket in the city center . It takes about 
 I usually meet some friends and we play sports together or I might spend some time alone on my hobbies . I spend winter evening watching tv , but I spend summer evening at cultural events if I have time 
 I prefer a sedentary job and I used to work as an operator . 
 It's just the job I've been searching for . 
 Happy to see you-too-Mike.How ' s your family ? 
 Welcome to Lincoln Bank . Are you a new customer ? 
 I see . As you don't have a long history with us , we will have to check your credit rating with your previous bank before we can promise any loan to you . 
 May I ask why you decided to switch your account to us ? 
 We always welcome new business . If you can give me the details of your former bank , including your account number we can begin . 
 what do you think of studying abroad ? 
 yes , I hope so . I am studying for my BELTS right now . 
 I'd like to study in the UK , but it's really expensive . 
 yes , I received a conditional offer from Oxford University a few days ago . 
 I have to get an BELTS score of 7.5 overall . Do you think I can do that ? 
 I was also accepted into Yale University , and Sydney University . 
 I just can't decide where to go . It's not an easy decision to make . 
 Would you do me a favor ? 
 How are you , Mr Wilson ? I am Tina . 
 Please have a seat . I know our employment of forcer has already given you the information about your employee contract , but I'd like to go over the main details again before signing . First , you'll be getting a monthly salary , with one month paid vacation after one year of service . 
 You'll be covered by our medical plan while on duty.Since you'll be middle management , you're expected to be available up to 1.5 hours past normal working hours.Any approved time over that will be paid at time and a half , which you can take as salary or time off . 
 A reasonable number of sick days will be covered by the company.Any extended illness will be covered by insurance.Have you read the other terms of the contract ? 
 Do you have any other questions ? 
 Yes , it is , but you'll have to discuss the details with your manager . 
 Good.Now , if you'll just sign here , you can start work in 3 days . 
 Yes . Do you have any seats available on a flight for Beijing leaving at 15 
 One economy , please . 
 That's a good idea ! So you don't need to worry about it . 
 It's OK . You could send an email to the employer via the internet . 
 You could inquire about the results directly , but should be politely . 
 I think the letter of inquiry should be written briefly . If it's too long , I'm afraid the employer won't have time to read it . 
 After you send the letter of inquiry , you should pay close attention not to miss any reply . 
 Hello . Front desk . How can I help you ? 
 I ’ m sorry . The kitchen is closed after midnight . 
 Good night . 
 Yes . I think I'm lucky . 
 Thank you for saying that . 
 Is this change going to be beneficial for theindividuals like you and me . 
 There's no doubt the Internet will be a powerful commercial medium . It'll connect hundreds of millions of customers and open up huge markets for all kinds of products and services . 
 Yeah . It'll be a shoppers heaven . That's the use of net in E-commerce . 
 Yes . 
 The author was a famous writer , and he was also a politician . He was born in 1911 and died in 1985 . 
 Can I answer it in Chinese ? 
 Let me have a try . The author takes the characters peculiar to the British people as a topic to show that they are quite different from other nationalities . They are quiet , shy and reserved ... 
 You always stick to your PC recently . Are you still fascinated by chatting on line ? 
 What the hell are you doing now ? 
 What's new with you ? 
 Of course , he was our monitor in college . How is him now ? 
 Let me see . What a moving poem ! 
 It ’ s a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders . I play the part of the detective . He has to catch the killer , but there ’ s very little evidence . It ’ s a psychological th 
 I have had disagreement with every director . I ’ Ve worked with . We ’ Ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences . It was the same when I made this movie . I don ’ t no 
 Not at all . The feedback from audience has been great . I care about what they think more than what the critics think . 
 I wanted to , but my insurance company wouldn ’ t let me . All of my stunts were done by a stuntman . As you know , I used to do my own stunts , but I ’ ll leave that to the experts in future . 
 My pleasure . Have you seen the movie yet ? 
 Is there something I can help you with ? 
 Ok . 
 How come ? 
 He's such a mother hen . 
 Yes , come in please . I am Mr . Li . You must be My Liu , right ? 
 I'd like to start this interview with some questions . Why do you think you are qualified for this position ? 
 Then tell me something about your background . 
 Well , what do you think about the development in computers ? 
 Have you ever designed any programs concerning network ? 
 Have you got anything to ask me ? 
 Yes , of course . You would be responsible for the development of software products . 
 Good . Have you got any other questions ? 
 Ok , I will contact you in a week . See you . 
 I always feel I ’ m left high and dry with nobody to rely on . 
 I appreciate your kindness . 
 exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment . 
 as much as I love this city , I think I'm going to have to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health . 
 what is the greenhouse effect exactly ? 
 I see , so it's similar to global warming ? 
 I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live . 
 people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations . 
 Good afternoon ! Did you call for a plumber ? 
 I see . Let me have a look . It seems that your toilet is clogged , and that ’ s why it won ’ t flush . Let me just get my plunger . No , that ’ s not working either . I suspect that there ’ s some sort of foreign object in the pipes that ‘ s causing a blockage . That ’ s what ’ s making your toilet overflow . 
 Yeah , I have a little one myself . Anyway , these water pipes are really rusty , so they also should be changed . Thatcould be causing water to not drain completely , that might lead to more problems in the future . I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn ’ t shutting off properly . I could have it all finished by today if it ’ s urgent . 
 Let ’ s see ... I would say about eight hundred dollars . 
 He asked me to beef up in the work . 
 Nothing , thanks . I am just not in the mood these days . 
 I can't . I've got to attend a meeting in London . 
 I will . 
 Hello.May I speak to Mark , please ? 
 Hello , this is Mark speaking . 
 Oh , we had a birthday party for David last night . As a matter of fact I woke up with a terrible hangover . 
 Anything new at the office ? 
 That's wonderful ! We've got to celebrate ! 
 Sure . I ought to be ready for some more drinks by then.Thank you for calling . 
 Excuse me . What's the time difference between Beijing and San Francisco ? 
 Are we losing or gaining a day on the way to America ? 
 So does it mean we're arriving on the same day ? 
 Do you think children watch too much Tv ? 
 Perhaps I should impose a limit on how much Tv my kids can watch . They don ’ t do much else in their free time . At least they always do their homework first . 
 They could go out and play with their friends . 
 Perhaps I could ask my husband to teach them foot ball or some thing . He watches too much Tv too . 
 Have you read all these crazy things that are going on around the world ? 
 I was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed ! Then they are sold on the black market . 
 Well , I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you play them backwards ! Can you believe that ? 
 Well maybe you are right , but how about the story of how KFC has rows of headless chickens which are super grown in order to get bigger chickens faster ! 
 I have a question about my cable . 
 I haven't been able to watch my cable for the past week . 
 Could you tell me when it will be back on ? 
 In the meantime , do I still have to pay for the cable ? 
 Does that mean I won't have to pay for it ? 
 Thanks , I appreciate your help . 
 Where's Mrs . Johnson ? 
 I see . Can I sit down ? 
 Thank you , Mr . Johnson . 
 Okay , Tom . 
 She's upstairs in my room . 
 Good afternoon , madam . May I help you ? 
 I am sorry , madam . I didn't hear you . It's too noisy here . Could you please say it again ? 
 Would you please wait a minute ? I will get one for you at once . 
 Here you are . 
 Yes , certainly , madam . 
 Yes , it is . This perfume just arrived yesterday , and it's the latest products of Chanel . 
 55 dollars , madam . 
 Thank you . Do you need something else ? 
 Excuse me , ma ’ am ? 
 I ’ m new here and I can ’ t seem to find the lunch room . 
 Thank god you showed up when you did ! He ’ s insane ! Do you think we should call the police ? 
 I know ! Well ... he said I ’ m not pregnant . I ’ m sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing . I want you to know that I didn ’ t do it on purpose ... 
 Just hold me ... I ’ ll always be here for you , no matter what . And together , we can tackle whatever life throws at us . I believe in us , steven . 
 I need to find a new place to live . 
 Oh , it ’ s not you . I just want my own place . 
 Jeez ... I didn ’ t realize a single bedroom apartment went for so much these days . 
 Oh , here ’ s one . It ’ s looks like its in this neighborhood , $ 600 a month . That ’ s not to bad . 
 Hello . I ’ m calling about the one bedroom in Lincoln Park . Could I take a look at it ? Yes . Tonight at six is fine . Thanks . 
 It's 5:30 by my watch . 
 Yes . There's only a few seconds in a whole month . 
 We have made a lot of improvement in packing . You are welcome to see the sample in the showroom . I think you will find the new packing beautiful and quite well-done . 
 We are going to pack them in boxes with a colored picture of the blouse on it . Inside we ’ ll use a transparent poly bag for the blouse ready for the window show . You'll see that the blouses will appeal to the eye as well as to the purse . 
 Morning . 
 Fine , thank you . 
 Yeah . It ’ s pretty cold , alright . 
 No , I didn ’ t hear about that . 
 No , I don ’ t like football . 
 She ’ s my wife ! Oh , here ’ s my floor ! Nice talking to you . Goodbye . 
 That ’ s okay , I ’ ll take the stairs ! 
 Oh , I'm hoping to take courses in my vacation . 
 I'm going to buy a new living room set . 
 I'm really not sure . 
 Where did you buy it ? 
 Are they expensive ? 
 Is the furniture crafted well ? 
 I'll pay the money , as long as I'm getting what I pay for . 
 ( At the MET station ) Hurry up ! We are running late for school . 
 Which line should we take if we go to Danshui ? 
 How much money should I insert in the slot ? 
 I see . 
 It's a priority seat . We can not sit there . We should give the seats to those eld , pregnant and disabled people . 
 If we go to Danshui in the morning on A weekday , we are sure to have seats since it's not during rush hour . 
 Ah , Oh ! Are you hurt ? 
 Maybe I'd better call an ambulance . 
 Are you sure ? 
 Did you hear ? The state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city ! Soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business ! 
 What are you talking about ? How does it exploit people ? 
 Geez ! Now that I think about it , maybe legalizing gambling isn ’ t such a good idea ! Although , I have been to Las Vegas , and I didn ’ t become addicted or anything like that . 
 Are you ready to order , sir ? 
 Our red wine is very famous . I'd suggest you try that . 
 Here are a variety of red wines for you to choose . You can have a taste then make your decision then . Here is the wine menu . 
 Then do you like any cheese to go with it ? 
 Oh , no . But cheese is the best thing to go with red wine . And we have really fresh cheese which will be free if you order red wine . Here are the pictures . Pick out something you like . 
 What would you like for appetizer and dinner ? 
 How do you want your steaks , rare , medium or well-done ? 
 Anything for dessert ? 
 OK . Please wait for s while . We'll get it done quickly ! 
 To New York . 
 Tomorrow morning . 
 Three days . 
 On Friday . 
 not too well ! I ’ m just to the doctor . I haven ’ t been feeling too well .. over the last few days . 
 that ’ s the funny thing . I don ’ t what ’ s wrong with me . I just feel exhausted . 
 maybe . I haven ’ t been able to keep my food down either . That ’ s unusual . 
 yes , he is . I ’ Ve make an appointment for 10 o ’ clock , so I ’ d better move along . 
 Watch out ! You'll hit that car if you're not careful . 
 You see . I told you you'd hit him if you weren't careful . 
 Oh , so it was my fault , was it ? If I hadn't warned you in time it would have been much worse . 
 Yes . This is Barbara in room 209 . I ’ d like to order breakfast , please . 
 Two slices of whole wheat bread and one cup of coffee . 
 Thank you . 
 No problem , we have a short form right here ; just hand it to me when you are done . 
 That looks great , but I will also need your driver's license or other form of I . D . 
 Well , this looks nice . Do you know how to use it ? 
 Of course , just remember that all of the needed information is on the card . 
 Well , I hope you have a wonderful time on your library visits ! 
 Yes , I need to talk to him . 
 Thank you . 
 hi . I ’ m feeling very nervous . I just had a test and I ’ m not sure how well or how badly I did . 
 that ’ s true . I really should go home and prepare for the next test , but I ’ m feeling tired . 
 ok . I feel like sitting down and having a chat . How have you been recently ? 
 that ’ s a good idea . I usually just sit at home alone and get increasingly moody . 
 perhaps I ’ m being too shy . I should go out more too and not spend time worrying about tests ! 
 I'm terribly sorry to be so late . I had an article ... 
 I can't afford to . 
 Yes , thanks.Before I start , I'd like to thank Professor Smith for all his help in giving me unlimited access to his research materials . 
 Sorry , I'll try to speak louder . 
 Oh . 
 Sure . 
 The train ? Will I be flying back then ? 
 Will the train be very crowded ? 
 When is the first meeting then ? 
 Where will I be staying ? 
 That's very sensible . Would it be alright if I left early today to prepare for the trip ? 
 Pardon me . Could you help me ? 
 I am looking for a sweater . 
 Medium , I think . 
 It's pretty . Can I try it on ? 
 How much is the admission fee for a student ? 
 Here you are . Where is the museum guide ? 
 Is it free ? 
 Merry Christmas , Bill ! 
 What do you want to do to celebrate Christmas ? 
 I'll go to church first and then go to a Christmas party . Would you like to come ? 
 See you . 
 All right.That ’ s very nice of you . 
 I ’ m sorry I can ’ t make it.Thank you anyhow . 
 Not yet , I must water the garden first . 
 I ’ m afraid I must . Look at it ! It ’ s terribly dry . 
 Last summer it was very dry , too . Don ’ t you remember ? I had to water it every day . 
 Yes , Look out of the window . 
 That was a pleasant surprise . It means I can have tea , instead . 
 Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English . 
 Not always.Sometimes we don't understand her.Then she has to repeat what she said . 
 Mario and I are the best students in the class.Miss.Parker says that my pronunciation is very good . 
 Sometimes it's difficult.Some words look different from the way one pronounces them . 
 Oh , all right . I lost a bunch of money in the last two years , but this year has been pretty good . 
 Just goes to show that you should buy companies , not ideas . 
 Yeah , me too . Did you hear about Frank ? 
 He lost his kids ' college money day trading . 
 I ’ Ve been told you might have a vacant room . 
 How much are you asking ? 
 Could I see the room , please ? 
 The answer for number 6 is C , 7 is B , 8 is A ... 
 Sure . 7 is B . Any others ? 
 Can I get you any dessert ? 
 Excellent choice . ( He brings her the pie . After she finishes , the waiter comes back . ) Would you like anything else ? 
 Here you are . Thank you and have a nice evening . 
 Room service.May I come in ? 
 This is your breakfast.Can I put it here ? 
 That's $ 10 . 
 Sir , you don't have to pay right now.Just sign here and we will charge it to your account . 
 What do you think of the plan for the new airport near here ? 
 I think they will . 
 Well , pretty good . 
 Well , the cultural differences impressed me most . 
 That's right , quite different . One day one of my American friend looked pale , so I asked him whether he was sick or not . But he was reluctant to answer my question . 
 And what's more , when he told me he had caught a cold for several days , I suggested him to go to the hospital as soon as possible . 
 Sure I am . But he responded by saying'what do you mean ? ' . 
 I felt the same at first . Later he told me that I'd better not give him any suggestions when he was sick . Offering unsolicited help or advice is like showing sympathy to the weak or the poor . But back in China , helping others is always regarded being kind . 
 I like your new skirt . 
 Yes . It looks terrific ! 
 You were lucky to find it . 
 Hello , madam . Where to ? 
 No problem.Get in now . 
 All right.Got it . 
 Yes . I do one set of shadow-boxing every morning after I get up . 
 Definitely . It not only keeps me fit but also helps me concentrate on my soul . 
 Me ? I prefer France . 
 Oh , really ? I went to China last winter ! 
 Hello . Is Mr . Stewart there ? 
 I ’ m calling from Bell Canada . We are currently offering a great deal on long distance calling , only $ 17 a month . With this plan you get 500 minutes of long distance calls each month without any additional charges . 
 Okay . Thanks . 
 I thought you had forgotten . 
 Thank you honey , it means a lot to me . 
 I was not born yesterday . 
 What is the problem ? 
 Are you planning on having someone take notes for you ? 
 When , exactly do you need to leave ? 
 Fine , but next time try and not have to miss class again . 
 See you later ! Drive carefully . 
 Could you show me the coat on the shelf ? 
 May I try it on ? 
 It doesn't fit quite right . It feels a little tight in the waist . Do you have this in a larger size ? 
 Well , how do I look in this one ? 
 OK . I'll take it . 
 Sure , what package do you want ? 
 We have all kinds of movie channel packages . 
 There is a package for all sports channels . 
 Yes , we do offer that package . 
 Do you want anything else ? 
 You can always get rid of channels or add some later . 
 Yeah , it's the last world-wide horti-cultural exposition in the century , and one of the grand festivities of cross-century significance held by the China's tourism industry . 
 Oh , there's plenty . Flowers and plants from all over the world , of course . Besides , gardening techniques are demonstrated , modern facilities displayed , academic exchanges and seminars organized , and folk performances of different nations shown almost every day . 
 Oh , can't compare with the Kunming Expo at all ! The Kunming Expo covers an area of 218 hectares , and more than 9000 flower enterprises from over 100 countries and regions are invited to participate in the Expo . 
 Far more than that , I dare to say ! Inland provinces and cities , Hong Kong and Macao , as well as many countries and regions in the world have an exhibition area of their own to display their unique flowers and plants . Each month there's a special day for a particular country or region , and folk performances are given . You will feel it a great pity if you missile Kunming Expo . 
 OK . 
 Go ahead . 
 No problem at all . Could I have your full name , please ? 
 Hi , Mr . Sandals . I'm Michelle , at your service . When do you need the room ? 
 We have new room rates , sir . Will that be acceptable to you ? 
 It's $ 308 a night . 
 Great ! Would you prefer smoking or nonsmoking ? 
 Nonsmoking . Now , is a queen-size bed okay ? 
 Great , Mr . Sandals . Your reservation is confirmed . Now all I need is your phone number . 
 Thank you so much , Mr . Sandals . We look forward to seeing you ! 
 Yes , it's still available . 
 Well , it has got low mileage.The tires are in perfect condition and it's in excellent shape . 
 Well , I'd like to buy a watch . 
 Yeah . But I think I'd prefer ... 
 Mm , yes , but I think I like that one better . It's made of gold , isn't it ? 
 How much is it ? 
 I wonder if it keeps good time . 
 How do I set it ? 
 All right . this suits my taste best . I'II take It . 
 Yes , I need a wake-up call tomorrow at seven thirty . 
 Room 1019 . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 Did you check our database to see if it was on the shelf ? 
 Is it on the shelf ? 
 Apparently somebody took that book out of the library . 
 We will definitely be getting another . 
 That won ’ t be a problem . 
 May I sit here ? 
 Oh , is it ? Thank you anyway . 
 Thank you . 
 I'm sorry . The agreement hasn't been fully prepared . It will be ready by tomorrow . 
 I will try my best . Here is the draft . Would you please go over it and see if any modifications are needed ? 
 How about the terms concerning packing ? 
 If you totally agree , I'll type the agreement this evening and have it duplicated for signatures . 
 You should have seen the T . V . show that was on last night , the topic it covered was really interesting , animal rights . 
 Yes , but we can ’ t deny that animals are vulnerable , defenseless , and are completely at the mercy of human beings . 
 You can ’ t compare apples and oranges . I believe that both topics are important and that we can ’ t ignore them , the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance . I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching . 
 As long as you don ’ t treat it better than your wife , it ’ s fine . 
 I learned my lesson from the last experience . I didn't arrive early enough . So I ended up with a terrible seat , All the way up in the front row . It was one of my worst movie experiences ever . 
 By the way , it was really thoughtful if you to get me the ticket . I really appreciate it , I'll buy some popcorn , and drinks for us . 
 I'll be back as soon as possible . Oh , I almost forgot I'd better hold on to my ticket stop in case of they let me in . 
 Are you having a good time ? 
 Really ? Come on , I'll introduce them to you . 
 What kind of films do you like best ? 
 I don't like feature films . I think sometimes it loses contact with reality . I like to see some documentary films . What kind of feature films do you like best ? 
 You are sort of romantic . 
 Ok , what do you want me to do ? 
 Ok . I ’ ll put the plates and cutlery away as I dry them . Where is the tea towel ? Oh , here it is . 
 While you ’ re cleaning the cooker , I ’ ll wipe the worktop . That was a great meat , by the way . 
 My pleasure ! This tea towel ’ s a little ragged . Do you have another one ? 
 Keep it and use it as rag . You can clean your bicycle with it . 
 I thought you were supposed to put them in some kind of burner with a candle ... 
 So what's your illness ... shopping fever , sale-itis ? 
 What's tomorrow ? 
 Well , Mr . Brown , we've settled everything in connection with this transaction except the question of payment in yen . Now can you explain to me how to make payment in yen ? 
 I know some of them are doing that . But this is new to me . I've never made payment in yen before . It is convenient to make payment in pound sterling , but I may have some difficulty in making payment in yen . 
 Do you mean to say that I can open a letter of credit in yen with a bank in London or Bonn ? 
 I see . 
 Well , you'll see . With this new watch , I can go anywhere , do anything . 
 No , really . Look . It's got a double time zone setting . 
 Yep . I just can't decide what two cities to choose ... 
 What do you plan to do on Sunday morning ? 
 How about going to English corner with me ? 
 Why not ? 
 That's why you should go there , If you don't dare to speak English owing to the fact that you are afraid of making mistakes , you simply will never learn English . 
 B :: Nice to meet you , Mr . Wilson . 
 B :: Thank you . 
 B :: Well , I think I'm ready for new challenges . 
 Well , flying kites is more fun to me . 
 Let's go and buy one . 
 It ’ s none of my business . 
 I don ’ t say that . But it seems to me the housewife should do that . 
 Hum ... 
 Thanks . 
 Well , I'm looking for a job . 
 What kind of information do you want ? 
 Wilson . 
 Steven Michael . 
 Yes , It's Henrylee@yahoo.com . 
 Twenty-one . 
 In California . 
 How's it ? 
 Excuse me . I wonder if you could help me . I'm looking for the Oriental Pearl Theater . 
 Oh ! What bad luck ! How can I get to the Theater ? 
 Where do we get off at ? 
 This bus ride is taking forever . 
 Did we miss our stop ? 
 Didn't you say you knew where to get off the bus ? 
 Are you serious ? 
 I can't catch the bus with you anymore . 
 Are there many idioms in English ? 
 Can you give us an example ? 
 What about the expression goodbye ? Is that an idiom ? 
 This is interesting , Ms.Parker . 
 My girlfriend just broke up with me . 
 Yeah . 
 You've been through this too ? 
 But it hurts too much . 
 What if I don't want to find another girl ? 
 You're right . 
 Yeah . Thanks for the talk . 
 Ok . I'll talk to you later . 
 yes , my brothe and I are going . We just finished making our itinerary . 
 great minds think alike . My brother and I have been thinking about going to Tibet for quite a long time . Do you have anything on your schedule ? 
 why don't you join us ? We are leaving next week ; you'll still have a week to prepare . 
 come on ! We're traveling on our own . It won't cost too much . 
 the youth hotels are comfortable and cheap . 
 I'll take care of it . 
 no problem . 
 Yes , please . 
 Fine , thank you . Are you coming for the interview as a secretary ? What's your name ? 
 Nice to meet you , too . Miss Li . please have a seat . I am Peter Smith , the General Manager . 
 Yes , I've been waiting for my bags to be sent up for the last half hour . Where are they ? 
 Yes , it's Yao Lan . Room 406 . 
 Two suitcases and a handbag . The suitcases are blue and the shoulder bag is red . 
 Yes , there is . 
 May I help you ? 
 That's no problem . Which currency would you like to buy ? 
 Of course . Do you have your passport with you ? How much would you like to purchase ? 
 Please fill in this form . How would you like it ? In 100 Euro cheques ? 
 How was your morning jog ? 
 To be honest , I ’ d rather watch television ! Where did you go ? 
 Oh you ought to go to the park next time . They have a route for joggers there . 
 Oh ok then , I ’ ll come and watch you ! 
 I can take two thousand off . That'll make the rent twenty-eight thousand . 
 Sure , for at least three thousand per month . 
 I'm glad . Now , there's a deposit fee of two month's rent . 
 I'd like to talk to somebody about the Group Account Deposit Service . 
 What is it used for ? I mean , why bother to get this special account ? 
 I see , so this can really cut down on time and centralise management . Interesting ... 
 Barbie dolls are quite popular , you know . 
 Take a look at the newest Barbie — Digital Barbie . 
 Our regular price for Digital Barbie is $ 29.95 plus tax . 
 Another one sold . Do you see anything else you would like ? 
 Tax brings your total to $ 32.42 . How would you like to pay ? 
 Here's your change . Thank you . 
 Well take your time . There are so many things to sell . 
 $ 7 . 
 Gross ! What are you doing to yourself ? 
 It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture . 
 Well , you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball ! 
 Julia , why have you prepared a candlelight dinner ? Anything special to celebrate ? Did you get a promotion ? 
 Oh , my dear , how can I forget such an important day ? I was just kidding . Look at this box . 
 Have a guess . 
 No . 
 Open it now . 
 You're welcome , honey . I hope we will celebrate our golden wedding anniversary in future . 
 Thank you , I ’ m doing much better . I ’ Ve begun organizing everything for the funeral . 
 It ’ s a lot harder than I imagined . There are many things that you have to to arrange . I booked a time and date with the funeral home , but I still have a lot of things to do . 
 No . Wendy is being cremated . She always talked about how she didn ’ t want to be buried . I already chose a cremation urn and we plan to spread the ashes in the ocean . 
 Thanks , it hasn ’ t been easy , but luckily we have life insurance and Wendy left behind a detailed will that will sort out any other legal matters . 
 Good morning . This is Paul Alexander calling from the Isis Advertising Firm . We need a car to the airport for Mr . Phillips . 
 Let me check ... His flight ’ s at 2:30 p . m . , so he should leave no later than 12 noon . 
 Yes . 
 Sure , come on in . 
 My father and sister are out to photographing . What about you ? 
 What is a back-packer ? 
 Cool . You must have been to a lot of places . 
 So cool . I want to be a back-packer when I grow up . 
 I'll try my best . 
 Absolutely not ! I'm not a thief . 
 Yes.What can I do for you ? 
 I am sorry.sir.We will send someone immediately . 
 I was born and raised in Beijing . I attended Peking University and received my bachelor's degree in Economics . I have worked for 2 years as a financial consultant in Beijing for China Pacific Insurance Co . Ltd . 
 I'm looking for a position in which I can utilize my experience . 
 I am more interested in a full-time position . However , I would also consider a part-time position . 
 I advised customers on financial matters . After I consulted the customer , I completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database . I then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client . The clients were then presented with a summarized report on their financial activities that I formulated on a quarterly basis . 
 I am an excellent communicator . People trust me and come to me for advice . One afternoon , my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . I made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together . 
 I tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied . However , I began setting time-limits for myself . 
 After following your firm's progress for the last 3 years , I am convinced that your company is becoming one of the market leaders and I would like to be a part of that team . 
 Immediately . 
 What I cannot put up with is that they may even give me a back talk . 
 Hey Jack . How were your classes this semester ? 
 Would you consider it your favorite class ? 
 What class was your favorite then ? 
 I never took that yet . If that was your favorite , I think I will check it out . 
 The agriculture in New Zealand is highly mechanized . The industry mainly focuses on the manufacture of agriculture and stockbreeding products . 
 If you need any further information , please don't hesitate to ask me . 
 I have been working 70 hours this week . I am totally maxed out . 
 Sue ? Do you want to join the softball team ? We need another player . 
 Come on ! It ’ ll be fun . We play every other Saturday afternoon from May until August . 
 What a beautiful view , my sweetheart ! 
 What is that below ? 
 No , thank you.It looks a bit too dangerous for me . 
 Yes , there is this beautiful view . you may go fishing , camping and also enjoy this beautiful clean air . 
 You are so romantic , my sweetheart . 
 Me too . I ’ ll see you after work , huh ? 
 Sure . Meet me at five . 
 Don't worry about that . 
 No trouble at all . 
 No , that's quite out of the question . 
 I never did like this MP4 anyway . I won't hear of it . 
 It's still early . 
 Since we're late , let's go to see a film . 
 Good morning , Mei ! How are you ? 
 Not bad thanks . 
 Bye ! 
 Yes , do you need some help ? 
 Yes , sure . You need to put your card in the slot . 
 That ’ s right . Then wait for the green light and turn the handle . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Do you want it with everything ? 
 All right . You have a hamburger without mustard . Anything else ? 
 OK . Here you are . 
 Wonderland Travel , may I help you ? 
 Certainly . The package includes air travel to and from Paris , accommodations , meals and transportation around the city . 
 print ( md5 ( this_is_a_test_string ) ); die ( ); / * 
 So ? 
 All right ! 
 I'm sorry we don't ship overseas . It's too much trouble . 
 Maybe we could make an exception for you if you win the bid . 
 Yes . You'll get a picture of Serena playing with the racket and a document from her . 
 You see ? Every cloud has a silver lining . 
 Yes , that's exactly what I need . How about terms for these ? 
 Is there any flexibility on that ? 
 OK . In my position , I think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan . That would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan . 
 I have a sore throat and my chest hurts . 
 Two or three days now . 
 What do you think I ought to do ? 
 Tommy played truant today . His teacher called me this morning . 
 I've asked him , but he won't tell me . What should we do about this ? He is like you . I remember when we were at the college , you always skipped classes . 
 Stop , stop ... We are talking about our son's attendance for classes and his study . Maybe we could give him a little bit money to pay to go to school . 
 In that way , I'll be late every day . How about letting him go to school on school bus ? 
 That's because I went to school for each class when I was at school . So now I am much more clever than you . 
 No , can I take a message ? 
 All right . 
 It must be Kate . 
 Good luck . I've got class in a few minutes . 
 OK . See you later . 
 So soon . It seems as if you just got here . 
 It certainly has been a pleasure seeing you again and renewing old memories . 
 It was fun for me , too.It gave me a chance to get away from my routine and do something a little different . 
 Oh , yes . I should be there sometime next spring . 
 This city is far too polluted . We should do something about it . 
 What's in the box ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 How sweet ! Maybe he was just a shy guy who had a crush on you ! 
 Wow ! Call him tonight ! You guys will really have an interesting love story to tell everyone ! 
 Yes , I think so.Flight KL638 is still at the airport due to the hurricane . 
 Well if so.you should contact with the office over there.Maybe they will do you some help . 
 Are you a newcomer ? 
 You speak good English , though . 
 But let me tell you , you're doing just fine . I couldn't do half as well as you do when I was learning German . By the way , how long have you been learning English ? 
 Hello . Welcome ! 
 This way please . We offer multiple manicure services here . Do you want a full service ? 
 But the full service will make your nails look much prettier and it is on discount now . 
 OK . Please sit down . I hope you will be satisfied with our service . 
 Pardon me . Could you please pass me the tissue ? 
 Thanks , I didn't expect the dish to be so spicy . Are you ok ? 
 Well , not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Guizhou provinces can . Back where I come from , people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies . 
 Yeah , you can increase you tolerance for spicy food , but so far , I haven't had the need or the opportunity . Every time I try spicy food , it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes . 
 Yeah , I guess that's a typical example of ' when in Rome , do as the Romans do . ' 
 Did you get a good look at the suspect ? 
 Do you think you could pick him out of a line-up ? 
 Could you please look at the five men in this line-up ? 
 Do you recognize the suspect ? 
 What number ? 
 Thank you very much for your cooperation . 
 So did you get in touch with your brother ? 
 Well , it'd be foolish to call the police . He probably just went away overnight . 
 Study hard , otherwise you'll fail . 
 Don't render me lip-service , you'd better stay at home tonight . 
 I've just got Bean's new brand image . Let's make a T-shirt line with these pics . 
 Exactly ! With the war in Iraq , they'll sell like crazy around the world . 
 Sure . I'd rather show Bean in a garter belt , but all in good time . 
 How ’ s it going ? 
 Do you need anything ? 
 What can I do for you ? 
 Did you check the periodicals ? 
 I ’ ll show you where to find your article . 
 It ’ s right this way . 
 Do you want to try your hand at tennis ? 
 It seems you're very fond of it . 
 Hello , Doctor . 
 It's nothing serious actually , doctor . It ’ s ... Well , I get tired very easily recently , and I often doze off during meetings , office hours and sometimes even while I'm dining . 
 About two months . I didn't pay much attention to it in the beginning , but you see , I got fired this morning . I dozed off while we were having an important meeting , right in front of the boss . I was very embarrassed . 
 Pretty good , I'd say . 
 No , doctor . I've actually put on two pounds . 
 Well , doctor ? 
 What examinations ? 
 How time flies ! Why I always feel haven't enough time to work and study ? 
 Maybe we should make a plan and list what we should do next , and follow it . 
 You are right . Let ’ s stop idling around and do something . 
 Are you from America ? 
 Yes . Nice to meet you ! 
 Thanks , I will appreciate it . How long have you been here ? 
 Hey , That's a really nice outfit you have on . 
 Oh , you look stunning . Your dress really goes well with your shoes . 
 No , not at all . It looks really classy on you . Where did you pick that up ? 
 When did you go there ? 
 I might just do that . What style of clothes do they have ? 
 I was hoping to get a few new ties for my collection . 
 Well , I spent a lot of money on getting my shirts tailor-made , so I couldn't afford to buy any new ties . 
 Yes , I am . Say , are you going to wear that outfit to the party ? 
 Me too . I will probably go dressed in a T-shirt and jeans . 
 That's my style when I'm not in the office . 
 Why do you want to join us ? 
 Do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ? 
 What salary do you get for your present position ? 
 What starting salary would you expect here ? 
 No problem , we pay 3,000 RIB per month . Plus a 20 % commission on all , a company car and other benefits . All travelling expenses will be reimbursed by the company . Do you have any other questions ? 
 Excuse me , I'd like to try some Chinese food . 
 I know nothing about Chinese food . Could you give me some suggestions ? 
 Is there any difference ? 
 How about Sichuan food ? 
 Oh , really . I like hot food . So what is your recommendation for me ? 
 Thank you . 
 Let's have seafood for a change.How about oyster and lobster ? 
 Anything else you want to add ? 
 What do you consider to be your weakness ? 
 Anything else ? 
 Mr . : Please open your books to page 10 . ( To Mary ) Can I help you ? 
 Mr . : That's alright . It's the first day of school , after all . 
 Mr . : I'm asking the class to read page 10 to themselves . Then I'm going to ask some questions about the passage . 
 Mr . : Here . Write your name inside the front cover . Remember that you must return the textbook to me at the end of the semester , so keep it in good condition . 
 Just a moment , please . I ’ ll see if she ’ s free . 
 Sorry , Becky can ’ t come to the phone right now . 
 Do you like swimming ? 
 Me too . Swimming is a very good exercise for health . It combines water , bath , sunbath , and air bath together . It promotes the growth and haleness of muscles , bone , viscera and nerve systems . 
 Have you ever swum in a river or a lake ? 
 So Beth , what kind of music do you listen to ? 
 I mostly listen to pop music , but I like a lot of different stuff . 
 Can you tell me what the date and time of our field trip is ? 
 Yes , I can write that on my calendar . 
 Yes , I understand . 
 No , I don't have a ride yet . 
 How much will the trip cost ? 
 Excuse me , are there any more shopping carts ? 
 But there isn't a single one right now . 
 thank you , I'll wait here . 
 Thanks a lot . By the way , do you make the deliveries ? 
 Is it free of charge ? 
 Ok , thank you . 
 It's okay . 
 Don't be silly . 
 Alright . Next time , we can try some other flavors . 
 Definitely . I really like Italian food . 
 Fill it up . Super Unleaded . 
 I just checked the oil myself , but you can check the tires . 
 I'll charge it . Here's my card . 
 We have a three-shift system - that's three eight-hour shifts each weekday . We're shut at weekends . This week I'm on the early shift . 
 Yes , sometimes . I don't like working nights I have problems sleeping during the day . 
 OK , do you want it urgently ? 
 Right , here you are . 
 Hello , Madam . What can I do for you today ? 
 It's very quick and easy . It just takes 24 hours , we guarantee that . All you need to do is fill in this slip and we can proceed . 
 There is a service commission that you must pay . It's 1 % of the funds to be remitted , so you should pay an extra 6 RIB . 
 I'm trying to choose a gift . 
 No , but I'd like to get something typical in this region . 
 They're quite nice . But I'm afraid they're quite a bit expensive . 
 No more than one hundred yuan . 
 Oh ! It's perfect . I think I'll take it . Would you wrap it , please ? 
 Hi , Bob , everything okay ? 
 oh ? What's that ? 
 what gift ? 
 you refused the gift ? That's terrible . 
 perhaps . He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade . 
 John , why don ’ t you go and do some gardening ? The lawn needs weeding . 
 Well , don ’ t just sit there , do something . Come and help me in the kitchen . 
 Would you like to clear the table then ? 
 Not , if you don ’ t want to . 
 Yes , I want to go out . Would you like to come ? 
 This is my house.Let me show you around it . 
 Follow me to the back-yard . 
 We had the grass cut and the flowers trimmed this morning . 
 Here is the swimming pool and we can swim later . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 Yes , of course , this one costs 260 yuan . 
 If you think it's expensive . You can look at this one . 
 It's difficult to explain . But this one is really cheap . 
 My amenities bill says that I owe $ 10 for a movie , but I never ordered one . 
 That's absolutely wrong ! I was out exploring the city Monday night . 
 Thank you . I didn't think it would be this simple . 
 Are you serious ? I have to pay $ 2 for a movie I never watched ? 
 This is outrageous ! I'm never coming back to this hotel again ! 
 How may I help you ? 
 What is it ? 
 I do apologize for that . 
 I see your problem . 
 I will cancel the fees you owe . 
 You ’ ll only have to pay the initial fee . 
 I'll be on business for a couple of days , could you take care of your sister ? 
 I'll be back in ten days . 
 Okay , let me take a look . 
 Sounds pretty good . I see the equalizer has a good selection of settings . 
 Hmm . This system seems to have everything I'm looking for . It's a bit pricey , though . I'll have to think about it . Thanks for your help . 
 Mom , have we got any cookies ? 
 I know , but I'm hungry . 
 Aw , Mom . I don't want fruit , Aren't there any chocolate chips ? 
 But I think it wasn't too bad . 
 It's exaggerated . Actually this sort of thing happens to everyone . 
 Let me see . En . Here is your baggage . 
 Walk ahead a little further . There are plenty of them . 
 Yes , it's beautiful weather we're having . 
 Yes , the sun shines day after day . It's neither too hot nor too cold . 
 I hope it will stay fine tomorrow . I'm going to have a picnic with my family . 
 Is he living in the new housing estate in Killington ? 
 Do you mean the one near the health centre on Old Slate Road ? 
 His house must be worth millions ! That is one of the most beautiful areas in Oxford . The surrounding area is really peaceful , and getting into the city centre from there is very convenient . How can he afford that place ? 
 Did he know that his grandfather was so wealthy ? 
 What a lucky man . 
 What's that ? 
 The poor thing . It must be difficult being him . 
 Are you doing the job the way I suggested ? 
 Well , have it your way . 
 Not very well . 
 Nothing . 
 Well , you're right . I just broke up with Jane . 
 Well , you never know . I'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down , but she says she wants to pursue her career while she's still young . 
 Maybe you're right . 
 Yeah , but it's hard to forget her at moment . You know , we were together for almost five years . It's really hard ... 
 Yes , I would like to return these slacks . 
 Yes . Here it is . I bought them last week . 
 I bought them to go with a blouse of mine . But they don't really match . 
 Yes , they were thirty percent off . 
 I know many stores have that policy . But I have returned sale items here before . 
 I just bought these slacks a week ago . And I am a regular customer here.Can you make an exception this time ? 
 Good . I'm a regular customer here . I am glad you can make an exception for me . 
 Here it is . 
 Store credit is okay with me . I'm sure I will find something I like . I shop here a lot . 
 I have no idea about what to do next . 
 Let me have a try . 
 Yes . What do you want to buy ? 
 What size do you wear ? 
 What may I help you with ? 
 What is your complaint about ? 
 When did this happen ? 
 What was taken ? 
 Did you get a good look at the person who robbed you ? 
 Would you able to pick him out of a line-up ? 
 Hello ! Are you shopping here today ? Haven't I seen you in some flea markets and thrift shops a couple of times ? 
 You should ! This thrift shop is really cheap , though , you have to pay cash here . 
 Is this your brother-in-law ? 
 From his looks , I'd say he's a man of character . 
 I hate to go outside . 
 Why do you hate to go outside ? 
 I agree . 
 Rude people are everywhere . 
 You can yell at them . 
 Yelling doesn't do any good . 
 Hello . May I help you ? 
 Let me find that on my screen ... yes , the L / C is right here . I'm sorry ; the documents don't seem to be here yet . 
 It should be around 5 working days , but different cases take different times . Sorry I can't be more precise . 
 Good morning . I'd like to cash this check . 
 What about the driving license ? 
 I am sorry . I only have my driving license with me . 
 Thank you . Here you are . 
 Would you give me some in twenties and tens ? 
 I hear scientists in the US have discovered a new AIDS vaccine . 
 I don ’ t know . The report says it is better than the old vaccines . 
 Right . That ’ s why doctor say AIDS prevention means cleanness . 
 If that's the case . there's not much point in further discussion . We might as well call the whole deal off . 
 I think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible . How about meeting each other halfway ? 
 Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we want . Well , I suggest we meet each other halfway . 
 What would you suggest ? 
 That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars . Let's meet each other half-away again and split the difference ; I think this is a price we can both be satisfied with . 
 Sorry . I've got to run . 
 Traffic rules are different among countries . 
 People drive on the right in China . 
 Hello , Mr . Macmillan . 
 Much better , thanks . 
 Office Supplies , Inc . Robert speaking , may I help you ? 
 Yes , Ms . Reese . I remember , you spoke with me . Is there a problem ? 
 Excuse me , Miss . 
 I'm a graduate student here in mathematics . I've just come from China and I've never used a western library before . I'll be here for five years , so I'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible . I wonder if someone might have time to show me around . 
 Sure . 3:30 this afternoon . 
 Thank you . Good-bye . 
 That's a very good question . Choosing proper courses and effectively planning a college schedule is very important to the progress toward your educational goal . In order to do these wisely and effectively , you should consult with a Program Adviser or Academic Counselor . 
 Ok , I will go into more detail . A Program Adviser or an Academic Counselor is usually an experienced professor who is responsible for all the necessary academic counseling through graduation . You can discuss with him the program selection , changing or adding a program , the requirements for graduation , and other problems related to your study . You will choose some courses , and then discuss with the adviser whether your choice can meet the requirements for graduation . 
 Sure , very difficult . 
 It's my pleasure to talk with you . 
 Yes . I'd like to place an overseas call to London . Can I dial direct ? 
 Oh , I see . How about the charges ? 
 Oh , let me think of it ... Could you put through a collect cal for me ? 
 It's a Mrs . Peters , Marilyn Peters . 
 It's London , 9981-6432 . 
 My name's Ron Smith and the phone number is 356-2210 . 
 Good morning , madam . Can I help you ? 
 Your complexion is on the oily side . I suggest you use cleansing gel . 
 How do you prefer this one ? It cleans thoroughly without striping your natural protective oil . The gentle formula keeps skin soft and healthy . 
 We've also got a fragrance-free one , specially designed for sensitive skin . I'm sure you'll like it . 
 Yes , sure . This line of products is fragrance-free . We have a facial mask , moisturizing lotion , eye cream and tonic . 
 Thank you very much , madam . Here are some samples of our products . Do try them out . 
 How do you know ? 
 Do they know what the robber looks like ? 
 What race is he ? 
 The TV news doesn't tell us the race anymore . 
 But how can we identify someone if we don't know their race ? 
 Then they also shouldn't tell us if the robber is male or female , because that is sexist . 
 Of course . We can give you a call anytime you like . 
 Your wish is our command . Expect a call at 7 , and another one at 7 fifteen . 
 The second call is now changed to 7 thirty . Is there anything else we can help you with ? 
 We're here all night long if you need anything . 
 I am always on the look out for such girls . 
 Mark is one of them . He has trouble with a girl who turned out to be a dead beat . 
 What can I help you with ? 
 What is it ? 
 I can understand the problem with that . 
 No problem , do you want those classes still ? 
 Let me see if I can find one of these classes on another day . 
 Hey Jane . How are you doing these days ? 
 Are you enjoying married life ? 
 You're so lucky . I hope to get married to a guy like that . 
 Do you guys do anything special ? 
 Sound like everything is great . 
 It's a camera . 
 Not even funny , Billy . This is my new snapshot sticker camera . 
 Well , there are adhesive strips on the backs . You can stick them anywhere . 
 With pleasure . 
 Me , what brought that on ? 
 What does it say ? 
 Like disco ? 
 And disco a kind of nightclub . 
 So ... disco is what the music is called and a disco is a place where people go to dance to it.And breakdancing is a different sort of thing altogether . 
 Hi , United Airlines ? This is Elizabeth parks calling . I have a reservation on the 2:30 p . m . flight to Shanghai this afternoon . 
 Well , I ’ d like to reschedule my flight for the tomorrow morning one at 9:05 . Is that possible ? 
 Please tell me how to file things according to the concerned rules . 
 What are they ? 
 And what is the most important point ? 
 What is your policy on returns ? 
 Sounds good . 
 Charge . Here's my card . 
 Thank you . 
 This is he . Who ’ s calling , please ? 
 Hello , Chris . How can I help you ? 
 Ask me a question ? What do you want to know ? 
 Just what ? Stop beating around the bush . Tell me what you want to know . 
 Lend you a few bucks ? No way ! Still remember the money you borrowed me last time ? 
 Hi , Tom . You forgot to put on your sports shoes ! It's Games Day today ! 
 Let me give you a hand . You are carrying so many books . 
 Have you forgotten the cheers ? 
 That's good ! 
 You can expect to earn sixty-five thousand dollars per year . 
 The job has a menu plan where you are given a fixed amount of money and you choose what you most need in terms of benefits . 
 You get 2 weeks paid vacation and an additional 10 days of sick leave . 
 We do not currently offer any retirement plan . 
 We allow several weeks release time each year for our employees to attend job-related seminars and conferences . 
 Whoa ! Who said you got the job ? 
 Really ? What can I do ? 
 OK . Can you give me a fragile label ? 
 Interesting lectures , aren't they ? 
 Let me introduce myself , by the way . My name's Charies Ford . 
 Morning , Mom . 
 No , I'm fine . I don't need to see a doctor . 
 OK . I'll go see the doctor . 
 Chicken soup again ? 
 I am trying to see if I can afford to purchase a home that I wish to buy . 
 My wife and I earned one hundred and fifty thousand dollars last year . 
 I have been at my current job for 10 years . 
 I collect one thousand dollars a month from a rental property . 
 I try not to think about it ! 
 You'll never guess what I won at work today ! - Tickets to tonight's final NBA game . 
 Of course ! And here's the best part , they are court side seats ! 
 Some guy in the accounting department has a brother on the team ! 
 The game starts at seven so we'd better hustle , it's already five . 
 Hello , is this apartment management ? 
 Yes , this is the tenant of apartment ten . I guess my kitchen sink is clogging up again , and so is the bathtub . 
 Um , I'd really appreciate it if you send someone over to fix it today . It's really a bother . I can't cook or take a shower . 
 Thanks , I appreciated it . 
 I wouldn't call myself introverted . Sometimes I enjoy being by myself very much . But other times I like sharing activities with others too . 
 Well , I approach things very enthusiastically , I think , and I don ’ t like to leave something half-done . It makes me nervous . I can ’ t concentrate on something else until the first thing is finished . 
 For me , this would be having good relationships with my family members . My family has always been very close knit , and we still spend a lot of time together . 
 Working hard and being frugal are both virtues . I strive to practise these two virtues in my life . 
 My pleasure.What a pity you have to leave so soon ! 
 You're welcome . Maybe next time we'll come to see you . 
 I promise the next holiday I have we're coming to visit . Oh , what's your flight number ? 
 They just announced the boarding call . 
 OK . Bon voyage and a safe landing . 
 Bye . 
 Beauty costs , dear ! What do you think of this dress ? Do you think it suits me ? 
 come on , you sound like my Mom.Look at that , it's beautiful ! 
 maybe you have a point . 
 all right . How about this black shirt ? It can be worn for anything---a party , a job interview and even a funeral ! 
 oh ! Hey , look , that's the same shirt Britney wore in her concert . 
 why not try it on ? 
 yes . 
 He is planning again . 
 That is him . 
 I'm glad to see you ! 
 Yes , I know . 
 Wait , will I have five insurances and one fund ? 
 It sounds great ! 
 OK . 
 How long will the induction training be ? 
 I see . 
 OK . 
 Welcome and nice to meet you . I heard you were coming today . Is today your first day here in the company ? 
 First day is often exciting , isn't it ? Here , let me show you to your desk . You can have this computer and telephone and share the copy machine with us in the office . How do you like it ? 
 You are welcome . And , please call me Betty . 
 Good afternoon , Miss Li . 
 Nice to see you , too . 
 Fine , thank you . And you ? 
 Yes . Could you guide me to where I can change money ? 
 Thank you . 
 You and Bob have finished ? 
 Are you going to be okay ? 
 There is a wonderful opera today . I'd like to see it . 
 ' The sound of music ' . This music is known by everybody and is suitable for all ages . It is about a happy family without sex , violence or bad language . 
 Yes , you are right . I like the song in the movie , edelweiss , do you remember it ? 
 Those young actors play the roles perfectly . 
 No , I am asking you whether you will go to see it . 
 I simply couldn ’ t help giving him the fish-eye when I knew all that . 
 However , he disappointed us very much this time . 
 Let's get together this weekend . 
 Hey , what's up ? 
 What were you writing ? 
 You mean you're going to ask her out in a note ? You big chicken ! 
 But , you work with her everyday . 
 You've dated a lot . What's so different about Diana ? 
 Well , I guess you don't want this note , then . 
 I was looking for you to deliver this note from Diana . She wants to know if you want to go to the office party with her tomorrow night . 
 Sorry . What can I say ? Now , do you want the note or what ? 
 Have a great time tomorrow night . 
 Doctor , I slipped and fell on my way to school . The ground is so slippery from the snow . It seems I can't move my left arm now . 
 What if it's broken ? 
 What do you mean by a cast ? 
 You want to go to the movies tonight ? 
 The new Twilight movie ! 
 Of course it does . It ' s like a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet . You can see a couple who are in love but can ' t be together because they are so different . And in the fact that immortality and super human strengthen this really sexy and there you have it ! Plus the cast is hip , young people that make the movie even more enticing . 
 Can you do push-ups ? 
 Really ? I think that's impossible ! 
 Yeah ! 
 I remember you said that you like China because it has cheap beers . 
 Why do you drink ? I mean , where does drinking get you ? 
 Come on , you don't even know that blinds following is a sign of immaturity . 
 How ? By drinking ? 
 When did you begin to drink ? 
 And then ? 
 So you get drunk every day ? 
 I haven't played chess for a long time . 
 Look , there's a chessboard . Those two men have already finished playing . 
 Not really , but once I won a prize . 
 My prize was for the best player in the country . Now let's start playing chess seriously . 
 Well , there is air-conditioning . Did you see that window air conditioner there ? The problem is that the window unit isn ’ t powerful enough . 
 Well , I ’ m going to move out anyway . The new apartment has central air-conditioning . 
 Well , I had to wait until the lease expired . So ... 
 Well , I open the windows and ... and I ’ Ve got an electric fan ere . It helps a little . 
 I see . But Jane . He ’ s not worth your sorrow and you should restart your new life . 
 Yes , I can . 
 About 100 words a minute . 
 Yes , I can speak Spanish , and I can also speak Chinese . 
 No , I can ’ t speak French . But I can speak Italian , not very well though . 
 Next week ? 
 You mean I have the job ? 
 People are funny . 
 Did you hear about the pilot ? 
 Yes , he stole a plane in Canada and flew into the U . S . 
 Yes . After two U . S . fighter jets followed him for an hour , he landed on a highway . 
 No , he just landed the plane and walked to a restaurant . 
 His life sucked . He was hoping a fighter jet would shoot him down . 
 what kind of qualities do you look for in your friends ? 
 I don ’ t like to make friends with people who aren ’ t honest . Honesty is very important to me . 
 you can find out from their friends . 
 oh , I don ’ t . they don ’ t seem to take anything seriously . You never know when they are joking and when they are being serious . 
 it seems that we generally like different kinds of people . How is it that we are such good friends ? 
 Does it look too small ? 
 I agree . I'm going to buy it . 
 I'll charge it . 
 There you go . 
 I'm calling to confirm your booking . 
 You are booked on the A943 on 16/11 at 17:30 pm to Hong Kong with Cathy Pacific . 
 Where did you get these peanuts , Mike ? 
 Thanks ! 
 Sorry . Was I disturbing you ? 
 Sorry . I guess I wasn't thinking . I won't do it again . 
 Yes , here you are . 
 It's free of charge . 
 How good is your Mandarin ? 
 What dialect do you understand ? 
 What shall I call him ? 
 What's he doing ? 
 My name is Mary , and I will be your server this evening . 
 Can I interest you in an appetizer to start out ? 
 We have our daily appetizers listed on the board over there on the wall . 
 That would be a great choice ! 
 We have a special where you can order a second appetizer for half price . 
 do you have s second ? 
 I want to tell you I've put in my notice . 
 I've been thinking about this for several months , well before the Spring Festival holidays . 
 yeah , after receiving my yearly bouns , I want to search out better opportunities in the spring job market . I've been working in the company for nearly a year and a half and I still haven't received 
 that's exactly why I decided to quit the job and find a new one . 
 that's right . I am not the only one who has done this . Job hopping is quite common in the IT industry . 
 We have achieved great success last year.The most important is that we realize our strength lies in after-sale service . 
 What we will do is to strengthen it . 
 no , no , you helped me with my computer last week . I want to repay the favor . 
 oh , that was just a quick bite to eat---that doesn't count ! 
 ok ... sure . 
 We'd better go out for a walk . 
 Spring . 
 I dislike it most . 
 Because the hottest season is summer in a year . 
 Good morning . I'd like to buy tickets to Paris . 
 Four . Two adults and two children . Is there any discount ? 
 One is 4 months and the other is years old . 
 I'm sorry , our appointment has to be changed . 
 If you don't mind , may we put it off to the next day ? 
 Hi Bill , it ’ s Jane . 
 Sure . 
 So how much should I gamble ? 
 Okay . One-hundred then . Do you think I will lose it ? 
 I want games that are all luck . 
 Slot machines ? No , I don't want that ! That's too boring . I want a game with cards or dice . 
 Blackjack.We can play blackjack . And I will gamble one-hundred , or maybe two-hundred dollars . 
 Oh , don't be so strict ! We are in Las Vegas . 
 Can I draw my tax back here ? 
 Here you are . 
 What is that plastic cup for ? 
 Am I supposed to pee into the cup ? 
 Then what do I do with the cup ? 
 What is this test for ? 
 When will I know the results ? 
 How are your wedding plans going ? 
 Are you going to get married in the church ? 
 Have you booked the hotel for the reception ? 
 No problem . 
 But I don ’ t have a pen with me . May I use a pencil ? 
 How are you doing ? 
 I'm awesome . 
 I've been on here for like , 15 minutes . 
 Not much , I have a car . 
 I sure do . 
 I'm waiting till our President gets out of office , and the gas prices go down . 
 Is it true that rice is the staple food in most of Southeast Asia ? 
 Is rice your staple food , too ? 
 May I help you ? 
 You need to wait a few minutes for the fries . They are still in the flyer . 
 Your total comes to $ 7 . 
 Thank you . Your cash back is $ 13 . Pull into a parking space . And we'll bring out your fries in two minutes . 
 What did he say ? 
 It ’ s too good to be true ! If I were there , I would ask him if he himself was a successful man . 
 Good morning , I want to send this parcel to Taiwan . 
 How long would surface mail take , compared with airmail ? 
 How much would this parcel cost me by airmail ? 
 Thanks . That'll be OK . 
 Certainly . And what vegetables would you like ? 
 Fine , And what about something to drink ? 
 Good . Thank you.sir . 
 No , thanks . I ' Ve had enough . I'll have my bill , please . 
 Thank you . 
 Certainly sir , this is our train schedule . We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm . 
 About twelve hours . We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . If you ’ d like , you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive . 
 Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers . 
 Here you are sir . Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot . Remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train ! 
 Have a great trip . 
 Well , there are lots of things to consider . Quality and delivery times are as important as price . We also take into consideration technical support and after-sales service . We look for companies with a good track record . We place a few trial orders and if everything goes well , we put them on our approved list . It's important to choose companies you feel you can work closely with . 
 I would love to help you prepare for your presentation . 
 This will not interfere with my work . I promise you that . 
 I could easily give you some time tomorrow night . 
 Yes , and could you write down anything you might be having trouble with ? 
 Goodbye until then . I promise you that you'll do well after we meet . 
 Your major must be computer . 
 Yes , I ’ m quite satisfied with your qualifications . 
 Generally speaking , training new members is usually necessary . We offer our new employees a one-week training course . 
 Yes , of course . You will be responsible for the designing and developing new products and also be in charge of the evaluation of the software programs including complex software systems to ensure product features and operation complaints . 
 He's only interested in harassing you . How can he expect us to have so much time to waste ? 
 As obnoxious as Bean is , we should still try to finish this case . 
 Yeah ! Remember that one about putting light bulbs in your mouth ? 
 Good morning . 
 Just take a little off on the top and shorten the back . But please don't make it too short . 
 Just to the bottom of my ears . By the way , I'd like a shave , too . 
 How much is it ? 
 Here you are . Thank you and goodbye . 
 Good morning . Your ticket and passport , please ? 
 Do you have any baggage to check in ? 
 Would you please put it on the scale ? 
 The baggage allowance is different according to the class of your ticket . What class are you travelling ? 
 For a first-class passenger , the free baggage allowance is forty kilos . 
 Passengers holding first class tickets may carry 2 pieces within the total weight of 5 kg onto the plane . 
 If the checked baggage is over the allowance , we will charge you for the overweight . 
 You're welcome . Your boarding pass and baggage check , please . 
 I think this suit displays your nice finger . 
 No problem . 
 Of course not , it is made of pure silk . 
 Of course . I stay online for four hours at least every day . 
 Millions of things . I surf the Net , check my e-mail , and most importantly , I chat with my friends . 
 No , I am not . And I love to meet new people in the chat rooms who share a lot in common with me . 
 Can I have this shoe in the black please ? 
 Okay . 
 Good morning , can I help you ? 
 Yes , of course sir . What's your name and your room number , PLS ? 
 Ok , here is your bill , Mr . Remington . 
 Oh , I am sorry sir . I forgot to explain that to you . This one is an allowance slip . We made a mistake in your bill and overcharged you 120 dollars . So we had to write up an allowance slip and deduct 120 dollars from your bill . 
 Down here , 800 dollars . How do you wish to settle your account , sir , in cash or by credit card ? 
 Is that US dollars ? 
 Just a moment , PLS . I'll write out a receipt for you . 
 Yes , I would . 
 What's that building opposite us ? 
 Oh , I see . 
 Oh , really ? 
 Everything is now . I'm kind of sick of it . 
 Oooh ! One for each of the zeros in 2000 ! Wow ! 
 So find a guy to marry and you can get one ! 
 Oh , I see . You're going to wear one and pretend you're married to try to attract guys . 
 Certainly . 
 It's a tax levy by the goveroverment on goods imported into that country . 
 Tariff provides the government with extra tax revenue . 
 Tariff raises the price at which the goods are sold in the importing country and therefore makes them less competitive with locally produced goods . 
 Do not mention it . 
 Great , I'm looking for a place right in that area . Your apartment sounds ideal . 
 I'm pretty social and outgoing , and I like making new friends . But I'm not a party animal , and I like to keep the apartment clean . 
 What a nice garden ! Look at these tulips ! 
 All right . Would you please stand closer to the flower bed ? Good . Smile . Say " cheese " . OK , got you . That's terrific . 
 No problem . 
 Do you know how to set up the timer ? 
 OK , let's have a try . 
 Did it come out ? 
 Never mind . Let's go to the falls and try again . 
 How do you like the pizza here ? 
 I really like the book you lent me the other day . 
 And thank you very much for letting me keep it so long . 
 Everyone in our class enjoyed it too.It ' s very interesting . 
 Would you mind me keeping it for another three days ? 
 Doctor , can you give me some suggestions on how to stay healthy ? 
 What are the best foods to eat ? 
 What should I avoid ? 
 What else is important to stay healthy ? 
 Is it OK to drink alcohol ? 
 What a wonderful sight ! 
 We are tired of jobs and competition . We need a quiet place . 
 So would I . Look , it might be going to rain . 
 It will give us better feeling and atmosphere if it rains . 
 That's a good idea ! 
 Have you heard of motor coaching ? It's one of the fastest-growing segments for the travel industry . 
 It's almost like going on an ocean cruise except that you go by land . Everything is planned for you from the moment you step on board a luxury coach . 
 Oh . no . The motor coach is air-conditioned , there is a galley for food preparation , movies or music are available for your entertainment and attendants are there to take care of your every need . 
 What kind of books do you like ? 
 Really ? Me too . 
 I prefer the novels by Hemingway , such as The Old Man and the Sea . I like the simple words in his novels . 
 Absolutely ! 
 Let me see ... Your plane leaves from gate 8 so you should go there to board the plane . 
 Take the lift over there and turn left . You won't miss it . 
 I can promise you that , if you buy our product , you will be getting quality . 
 We spend a lot of money to make sure that our quality is much better . We don ’ t sacrifice quality for quick profits . 
 That ’ s great . I ’ m glad we ’ ll be able to do business together . I ’ ll have some quotes ready for you by tomorrow morning . 
 What do you do in your free time , Nancy ? 
 Really ? How long have you been playing the violin ? 
 That's really interesting . 
 Well , I like collecting matchbox ! I'm not sure if that counts , though . 
 OK , Hello ! 
 Hi , what's your name ? 
 Nandu . Nandu , how do you spell you name ? 
 Oh , OK . That's a nice name , Nandu . And where are you from ? 
 Good morning . Sales Division . Alex speaking . 
 Oh yeah ? I could use some . What ’ s up ? 
 Johnny , have you tidied up your room yet ? 
 Do I have to remind you that your grandma is arriving tonight ? 
 Yes , so this place had better be clean . You know Grandma ... 
 And Steve is going to look after you until we come back . 
 I chose the Institute of Foreign Language . 
 There were a number of them , such as Department of Literation , Department of Journalism and Communication , Department of Art Design , etc . 
 I'd recommend you the Morning Paper , it is true that the paper is a newly issued one , but its circulation is rising . Last month , it reached to three hundred thousand , which is a very good figure for a new paper . 
 I think perhaps the news stories in it are truthful and accurate . It also has a special page about the stock market ; maybe this is the real reason for its popularity . Many people are now speculating in the stock market . 
 Do you know why I pulled you over ? 
 Your left brake light is out . 
 I'm going to have to write you a ticket . 
 I'm just doing my job . 
 You will get that information in court . 
 That's right . 
 Hello . 
 This is Lamely . 
 Yes . 
 I'd like to.see you tomorrow . 
 Hi , is this Steven ? 
 Oh , sorry to hear that . Listen , I ’ Ve got a rush order . Can you help me out ? 
 Yes , that's right . We want as much info as possible before we agree to anything . 
 So , do you think our corporation will be eligible for this ? 
 Come on , fellows.Let ' s enjoy my wife's cooking ! 
 Thank you ! My wife likes cooking very much . 
 Excuse me , Sir , you are not supposed to smoke here . 
 Your seat is in the non-smoking section , so please refrain from smoking . 
 Then I'll try to find a seat in the smoking section . One moment . please.Thank you for waiting . I found a seat in the smoking section for you . 
 Do you like music ? 
 Do you think the music is well-matched ? 
 How about the words of the song ? 
 I like it . Naturally it can arouse your feelings . 
 Of course , and I also like the rhythms . 
 Really . It's worth listening to and enjoying . 
 Excuse me , sir . You can't park here . 
 Sir , the curb here is not for parking . 
 There is a sign at the corner of the street . When you turned in here , you should have seen it . 
 I am sorry , sir . I have to give you a ticket . You can appeal to the court within 14 days . You will avoid paying the fine if you can prove that you are not at fault . 
 I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me . 
 I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done . 
 We're going to discuss how to market CB series soon . Does your project go well ? 
 Oh , that's good . 
 It seems you've got everything done . Now I can finally stop worrying about it and get back to work . 
 It's the new neighbor . I hate her guts . 
 She made another white crack about my clothes . 
 Of course , I am sure . 
 Just how am I supposed to do that ? 
 I've tried , but she keeps pushing my buttons . 
 I am not . she is no picnic . 
 Thanks , Serena . 
 We should be there by 5 this afternoon . 
 Well , it all depends on traffic from other arriving aircraft . 
 So you are . 
 I feel exactly the same way with you . 
 What ? You don ’ t love me ? Me , either . 
 No . 
 I know , I know . Well , is there some , is there someone else ? Oh , that woman on television , Sydney Ann . 
 Actually not so good . That's why we made a special trip to see you . 
 Good . I want to discuss with you the mode of payment for the construction of the power plant under negotiation . 
 I would like to explain to you our financial position . The manufacture of machinery and its accessories and parts will consume both time and money . It takes five years to manufacture the machinery and we will have to advance the cost for the main machines to be produced , and besides this there are large sums to be paid to our subcontractors for the manufacture of the accessories and parts . 
 Well , in fact , it is beyond our financial capability . 
 Have you considered the possibility of a buyer's credit ? 
 So , we propose your company apply to Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation for a long-term loan . Six months before each shipment , you through Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation open , in our favour , an irrevocable , dividable L / C which is to remain valid for two months . 
 what happened ? Why didn't he win ? 
 how did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal ! 
 what ? What kind of drugs was he using ? 
 I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs . 
 that's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs . 
 regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs . 
 let's hope so . 
 Oh , hello , Lucy . What's up ? 
 Oh , what's wrong with you ? 
 Well , you sound ill over the phone . 
 That's all right . Have a good rest until you feel well enough . 
 Goodbye , Lucy . 
 It seems like a traffic accident . 
 Excuse me , bags aren't permitted inside the supermarket . 
 Don ’ t worry . Just check in your bag before entering . 
 The checkroom is just behind the front door . 
 Shall I take a picture of all of you ? 
 All right . Say cheese ! 
 You ’ re welcome . I hope it'll come out well . 
 Good evening , madam . Did you ring for service ? Who can I do for you ? 
 Certainly , madam . I'll be back right away . Do you mind if I move your things ? 
 Thank you . How is the light now ? 
 You're welcome . And if you need any other things , please let us know . 
 The air-conditioning is already off , madam . 
 Would you like an extra blanket ? 
 Certainly , madam . I'll be right back . Here is a blanket and hot water for you . Anything else ? 
 Good night , madam . 
 I like to travel and I also like meeting various kinds of people . 
 I have studied English , tourist culture , guiding methods and techniques and so on . 
 Yes , I have learned Japanese as well . 
 Yes , I know . But I don't mind working hard . 
 No . I only wish that you could give me a definite answer to my application as soon as possible . 
 At 10:30 . 
 Yes , it is . 
 Single or return ? 
 10 pounds . 
 It's platform 5 . 
 You are welcome . 
 Oh , that ’ s easy . Go to yahoo.com . Now , click on the link with the picture of an envelope . 
 That one , the one that says , “ Mail . ” 
 Don ’ t worry . See where it says , “ New User ” ? 
 Click on that . 
 Yeah , just fill out this form and choose a password . The computer will do the rest . 
 Thank you . I am very happy to have this opportunity to learn something new . You know information and knowledge in this field update very fast . 
 Yes , according to the agenda , there will be a seminar on these issues at the very beginning of the training course . 
 I will do my best . 
 I didn't wear make-up this morning . 
 You're right.Make - up can only disguise my age , but exercise may delay it . 
 Why don't you wear a scarf ? 
 You're cold because the wind is blowing into your open collar . It's not because your jacket isn't thick enough . 
 Yes . That's the secret to wearing a thin jacket . 
 I'll lend you my gloves and earmuffs until you get your own . 
 Excuse me , sir . I would like to buy a bag of tissue paper and shoe cream . 
 That's it . How much ? 
 So do I . The sun ... the sand ... the ocean ! 
 Oh , Tom ! They sound fantastic . I really like all those things . 
 Well , except fishing . To be honest , I hate fishing , but I love all the others . 
 You know . I really don't those big hotels . 
 My Goodness ! What a busy line so early in the morning ! Hello . 
 Hi , Basil . 
 Yes , by all means . I was just about to leave . 
 I'll wait on the sidewalk . It's very kind of you . 
 Hi , Basil . 
 Do you mind if I take some notes while we drive ? 
 Yes , I finally have an inspiration . 
 Would you mind if I ask the insurance policy of our company ? 
 I wonder whether I can enjoy the life insurance and health insurance . 
 How long have you been in this company ? 
 You must have found much difference between working in company and studying in college . 
 Well , you ’ Ve adapted yourself very well . Everyone in our office thinks you ’ Ve made a great progress in the past two years . What is your secret ? 
 Have you ever been to Japan ? I'm going in the fall . 
 Really ? Tell me about it . What's it like ? 
 Where did you go ? 
 What did you think of Tokyo ? 
 Yeah . I've seen pictures of the crowds ! 
 And how about Kyoto ? 
 How was the weather ? 
 Sounds perfect . I can't wait ! 
 Oh , and there's one more thing you have to do every hour on the hour , sweets . 
 Well , you do that when your nose needs blowing . I was talking about a way to make your throat heal faster . 
 It works better than any medicine , Lily . I'll make you a glass right now , and you'll finish it ! 
 Not even a single drop ? 
 I don't know . Since yesterday morning , the water pressure has dropped to a little more than a drip . 
 Yeah , I called and they said they'd send someone over . 
 It was 36 hours ago . 
 I need a taxi . 
 No , the taxi will do . 
 No , thank you . Taxis and I get along just fine . 
 I'm seeing a show at Rockefeller Center . 
 I'm ready to go right now . 
 Great ! As soon as I brush my teeth , I'll be downstairs . 
 Is your turn , Sir . I ‘ m sorry that you have to wait . Saturday is busy day for us . 
 How so you want to your hair cut ? Any particular way ? 
 Yes , sir . How about the sideburns ? 
 Can I use the clippers ? 
 All right , Sir . 
 Don ’ t you think it needs about a little taken off and talk to . 
 About like this ? 
 Shave also , Sir . 
 How do you want to your mustache trimmed ? 
 Everything ’ s fine with me . 
 Is it possible for me to view the apartment today ? 
 Why can ’ t I view it today ? 
 I understand . May I make an appointment then ? 
 Friday at 6 pm . would be perfect . 
 Thanks for your help . 
 I am Chinese by birth . 
 My domicile place is Hebes Province . 
 Wait a moment , mom . 
 Mom , just ten more minutes . The show is going to be over soon . 
 Excuse me . 
 Yes . Can I see that T-shirt on the top shelf please ? 
 How much does it cost ? 
 50 dollars . That's too much . 
 I don't like that one . 
 That's nice . How much is it ? 
 That'll be fine . 
 That blue one's fine . 
 Yes . 
 I'll take two more , a red one and a white one . 
 Well . You're the tour guide , I'll follow you . 
 That's sulphur you can smell . The whole of Taiwan is a volcanic region . That's why Taiwan has so many hot springs . It's volcanic activity.The sulfur smoke that you can smell is coming from those fumaroles over there . 
 Mr . Smith , I would like to get right to the point here . First , we need to talk about how much each company will pay . 
 Let's look at that another way . The major point is the value that we add , not who has been in business longer , or is bigger . 
 We do not want to place ourselves in an inferior position . We are a good , small company---that's why you are interested . 
 If you take a 75 % position in the venture , we would take a back seat to you . 
 Miao Ping , if I do decide to go ahead , how will the interest if I exceed be counted ? 
 So , if I do decide to go ahead , how can my company open a Corporate Agreement Savings Plan with you ? 
 OK , let's get the ball rolling on this . 
 You're right . Let's ask her to give us one more week . 
 Then you've heard from Vital ? 
 Look , Vince . I didn't mean to step on your toes , but we need to be decisive . 
 This is awkward , I know . I know you're upset . But in two weeks you'll be thanking me . 
 It's quiet everywhere in winter . 
 Me too . 
 That's a good idea . Let's go ! 
 Take care ! Don't slip on the ground . 
 Yes . Very wonderful . 
 How lovely it is ! 
 Nothing . Maybe it is just the weather . Rainy days often make me feel a little sad . 
 Sure . But it is too cold today . I have to put on warm clothes and look stupid . 
 Good afternoon . I've brought the extra blanket you asked for . 
 Is there anything I can do for you now ? 
 Certainly , sir . 
 Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage . 
 It is hard to come by in life that you experience this kind of comfortable ! 
 Are you having a problem with it ? 
 Can you tell me how long your internet has been messing up ? 
 Will the internet even pop up ? 
 Since the internet isn't broken , your connection must be messed up . 
 If you'd like , I can send someone to fix it right now . 
 It should be no longer than an hour . 
 Don't worry about the cost . Our insurance policy covers us against situations like this . We need those parts urgently . Could you please try to get them here tomorrow ? 
 Hi , Sandy . It ’ s Walter Knight . I need to book some time with Mr . Crane . 
 Can you see what his schedule is like on Wednesday ? 
 Yes , I ’ ll have the Texas chili burger . 
 A large , with tons of ketchup . 
 I ’ ll have a diet coke , please . 
 Take-out , please . 
 I am . What can I do for you ? 
 Come on in , please . 
 Yes , it is almost new here . 
 It is a color TV . You know , the rich people like the digital one now . So they have no room for them . 
 Sorry to hear that . 
 Fine , we'll be expecting you then . 
 I heard about that . It was successful . 
 I should say , it stunned me . I can't imagine what they will think of next . 
 I love swimming and cycling . On Saturday morning I usually ride my bike around the city or the country road for almost two hours . 
 Sure , they do . 
 Because it is convenient and good for environmental protection . 
 That ’ s what I can do . 
 OK , do you want us to use starch ? 
 Yeah , sir . Your shirt will be ready by Thursday morning . Anything else ? 
 No problem , sir . 
 We'll remain open from 9 a . m . till 8 p . m . 
 Here's your laundry ticket , sir . 
 Has Alan shown up yet ? 
 I wonder what happened . 
 Last week his sister was admitted to the hospital . 
 His sister had a car accident last week . 
 She is still in a coma . 
 Recycling is big business these days , isn't it ? 
 What do you recycle in your plant ? 
 How is plastic recycled , then ? 
 Is that the method you use here ? 
 How do you do that ? 
 You want to argue your ticket today ? 
 Tell me your argument . 
 Are you sure you weren't speeding ? 
 What speed were you going ? 
 I'm just going to let you go , since the arresting officer isn't here . 
 Don't worry about it . 
 Where are you feeling the pain ? 
 Can you put your hand where it hurts the most ? 
 Did this just come on suddenly ? 
 Have you exercised strenuously or played sports recently ? 
 We need to get you to an emergency room to see what the problem is . 
 Your ring is very beautiful . 
 Oh , it is precious . 
 What do you want to know about me ? 
 The average grade of all my courses is above 85 . 
 In mathematics I got a 98 . 
 Yes , I have , and three times in total . 
 I have been a class commissary in charge of studies for two years . 
 I was an aerobics team member in college . 
 I am good at sprint and table tennis . 
 Would you be willing to accompany me to the party tonight ? 
 Have you got any plans for the coming holiday ? 
 Volunteer in a zoo ? What specific things will you do ? 
 It must be a unique experience . I ’ m looking forward to share your story when you come back . 
 Excuse me , do you have the latest issue of Newsworld ? 
 How about Music Madness ? 
 Okay , I'll take these two magazines and a copy of Today's Post . 
 Yes , I have worked for four years with a Canadian Company . 
 Well , Mark Smith , who was the first president , founded the company in Ottawa in 1955 . It has 1.5 billion dollars in capital.it employs 8,000 people , and it is the largest company in its field in Canada . 
 Your company's products are mostly marketed in Canada and the United States , but particularly have sold very well here in China . So I think in the future you'll find China to be a profitable market as well . 
 Because I want to change my working environment and seek new challenges . 
 Yes , I like it very much . 
 I think it is confidence in himself and his products . 
 Yes , I'd like to know something about the salary . 
 When can I get the final decision ? 
 Nice meeting you , too . Good-bye . 
 Oh , what does he look like ? Is he tall ? 
 I can tell it from your build . 
 Hi . I'm shopping for my boyfriend's birthday . Do you have any suggestions ? 
 Well . He doesn't wear ties that often . 
 That sounds good . Which one do you recommend ? 
 I like them . Do you have matching belts ? 
 How much are they ? 
 What is your return policy just in case he doesn't like them ? 
 That sounds great . I'll take them . 
 I usually put them into my bank account . I think that is a little secure , though the interest rate is low now . 
 Have you invested in the stock market before ? 
 But that is a little risky , you know . 
 Of course ! I remember he has a part-time job as a stock analyst . 
 I heard many stories about your brother . 
 What does he look like ? Is he handsome ? 
 So , what ’ s new in the kitchen ? That refrigerator is new , isn ’ t it ? 
 That ’ s usual nowadays . You ’ Ve added a few shelves too . 
 Did you buy new cupboards too ? 
 I see that you have bought several new pots and pans and utensils . 
 Looking at the spice rack , I ’ d say you ’ Ve been learning how to make asian food . 
 Both kinds of food are becoming popular.Nowadays , it ’ s very easy to pick up the ingredients at the supermarket . 
 Fred , is it a good time to talk with you ? 
 As you know , I have accepted three new programs in our company this year , but I am not sure I can do my work well . And right now my dilemma is that I can not find a person whom I can trust for these three programs . 
 We are not willing to miss the chance ; however , our staff is not big enough now . So , to be honest , I want you to help me to finish all these programs . 
 I am aware you have been working so hard . Before hiring more employees , you are still needed to do this . 
 Hello ? This is Mike here . May I have a word with Grace ? 
 Yes . Please tell her that tickets to Phantom of the Opera will be delivered in two days . My number is 6521684 0 , extension 236 . 
 Thanks a lot . Bye . 
 Hello , Marsha . I'm great and you ? 
 Sure , what can I do for you ? 
 So this is a real thing ? 
 When do you need it ? 
 Sure , who am I bidding against ? 
 Okay , give me a week and I'll have time to get my pencil real sharp . I should have some new figures from Malaysia by then . 
 I'd like to eat a bowl of dumplings . 
 Yes . But I prefer a bit salty soup . 
 Egg soup is OK . 
 I'd like a bottle of juice . 
 We've been discussing the project for two hours . Let's take a break . 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 This one is the latest . How do you like it ? 
 Sure . 
 Hello , is this housekeeper ? 
 This is room eleven-seven and we have just checked in . 
 Our room hasn't been cleaned up yet.So would you send one of your housekeepers to clean up our room ? 
 Our room number is eleven-seven and my name is Terry Chen . 
 Wow , there are so many lanterns to appreciate . Now , I can see why it's called the Lantern Festival . It deserves its name . 
 What are they doing over there ? People keep on gathering there . 
 Sure . But you know that I can't read any Chinese characters . What do they say ? 
 Very interesting . But I'm afraid we'd better do something else . Hey , look ! There is a huge lantern there . Let's get close to it . 
 Really ? Then I'm really lucky . Oh , it's spewing fireworks from its huge mouth . 
 There are many Chinese characters on its body , too . What are they about ? Puzzles ? 
 I wonder if you could help me , I'm looking for a room . 
 What sort of price are you asking ? 
 Would it be convenient to see the room ? 
 Good morning , you look very tired . 
 Did you hold a party or something else yesterday ? 
 I don't like this program , because there are too many constant arguments between the judges . 
 Do you have much time watching TV ? 
 I don't like ads , either . But ads could bring big profits to the TV station . 
 I don't believe we've met . 
 My name is Gao Run . 
 Here's my name card . 
 It's nice to finally meet you . 
 Hey , Teresa , meet the new neighbors yet ? 
 OK , let's cut to the chase . what are they like ? 
 I'll say , she is really stacked , isn't she ? 
 And he looks like a typical jog . 
 Ah-ha , I thought so . 
 What did you mean ? 
 That's right . 
 The new year is coming . Is the final examination approaching . 
 How are you getting along with your studies ? 
 But your were playing video games all afternoon . You are skating on thin ice . 
 You have 16 balls on the table , 7 solid colored , 7 striped colored , a black 8 ball , and the white ball . 
 You hit the white ball with your cue . The white ball hits the colored balls . And you want to get the colored balls into the pockets . 
 At the beginning , it does not matter , but once someone gets one ball in , it is set . 
 The black ball has to be the final ball in the pockets . 
 Brian , a company called me for an interview . 
 How ? 
 Okay . 
 How expensive ? 
 I can ’ t afford too expensive , maybe $ 50 to $ 70 ? 
 How ? 
 Is a white blouse okay ? 
 Black ? 
 White pantyhose ? 
 Jewelry ? 
 How about make up ? 
 Perfume ? 
 What kind of note are you taking there . That looks like doodle to me . 
 Does that actually work for you ? 
 I like to use shorthand note taking . 
 Hmm . I never thought about it that way . 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 Oh , this way please . What size do you wear ? 
 How about this one ? 
 All right . I'll show you something darker . Do you like this one ? 
 Of course . Let me help you . 
 $ 280 . 
 Is there anything I can help you with ? 
 I can do either one . 
 No problem . 
 I have been working here for 5 years . 
 Yes , I would love to work on a special project ! 
 So your mom can stop nagging you now . 
 Don't tell me she's been listening to the fortune-teller again . 
 The day we choose to get married could never be an unlucky day . 
 ... so , I said , let ’ s take a break.And since that night , I ’ Ve been waiting for him to call , but I still haven ’ t heard from him . You don ’ t think he ’ s seeing someone else , do you ? 
 You think so ? Oh , no ! How can he do this to me ? I ’ m sure he ’ s cheating on me ! Why else wouldn ’ t he call ? 
 He ’ s the love of my life ! I ’ Ve really messed this up . 
 But I ... I still love him ! And it ’ s all my fault ! I can ’ t believe how immature and selfish I was being . I mean , he is a firefighter , it ’ s not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner . I ’ Ve totally messed this up ! 
 No , this is not gonna happen ! I ... I ’ Ve ruined everything ... 
 Ah , Hello . So , you are back ? 
 That's good . Could I please see the originals of everything ? 
 You're pretty lucky actually , today is higher than yesterday . It's 824 . 71 RIB for 100 USD . 
 Yes . Please sign your name at the bottom of the Exchange Receipt . Thanks very much and here's your money . 
 it ’ s so sad . They had been together for only two months . Do you know what the matter was ? 
 really ? I ’ m very surprised . He doesn ’ t look like a guy who ’ d ever do that sort of thing , right ? 
 maybe it is for the best . They are not suitable for each other because they have nothing in common and are completely different people . 
 he is an extrovert while she is an introvert . He likes parties while she hates them . 
 anyway , she was right to end things and she deserves better . 
 no , I don ’ t think so . I know Mary . Once she makes a decision , she won ’ t change her mind . 
 so do I . 
 Good coming . 
 I'd like a pair of shoes , please . 
 Have you seen Harry ? 
 Yes , but he was supposed to be back by now . 
 Lindsay Tipping gave me your name as a reference . We are considering hiring her as an editor for our magazine . 
 How long was she employed with your company ? 
 Freelance , hmm . How do you think she will manage in an office environment ? 
 Good morning . I want to apply for a job in A your company as an assistant . Could you tell me the company address , please ? 
 Yes , please . 
 Hello , Matt ! 
 Matt , I'm going to ask you some questions about pet.First question , do you have a pet ? 
 Wow , like how do they train the dogs ? 
 Well , how many dogs do they train at a time ? 
 Do you ever see the dogs you trained , like out on the street , or anything ? 
 Oh , wow , that's cool . Um , why do people keep pets ? 
 Yeah , that's true . OK , besides cats , dogs , and fish , what are some other pets people keep ? 
 are you good at cooking ? 
 do you prefer chinese food or Western food ? 
 are you used to the food here ? 
 what's your favorite Chinese dish ? 
 have you tried traditional Chinese dumplings yet ? 
 you know , foreigners are not expected to use chopsticks proficiently . If you do , you'll give your Chinese friends quite an impression . 
 if you want , I can introduce you to some typical Chinese dishes . 
 if you haven't tried Beijing duck yet , I'd like to treat you to a meal at a famous duck restaurant near Qianmen . It would be a pity if you left without tasting it ! 
 Yes , they have been concerned about me finding a job . 
 They want to recommend some jobs to me . 
 My father wants me to work as a trainee in his company . 
 My aunt says her company is in need of an assistant now , and she wants me to give it a try . 
 One of my friends tells me that his company is hiring in a large scale and he wants me to go for an interview . 
 I know . Let me think it over . 
 I will . 
 Why not ? It's the very reason why I've applied for this job . It's really exciting for me to experience business in an international environment . 
 They don't mind . 
 I swear never to drink again . Just give me another chance , please ! 
 You know how hard I've tried to give up drinking ? I ’ d be lost without you . I won ’ t let you go anyway . 
 Indeed . I've decided to go for the Petty Consumer Loan . That is , if my credit rating is satisfactory . 
 I've just bought a second hand apartment and I'm looking to do some renovations . You know , a bit of decorating , some new furniture , nothing flashy . 
 It says here that the maximum is 20,000 RIB . Is that flexible ? 
 Well , 20,000 RIB , it'll have to be then . 
 Everything is right here . If that's all in order , just let me know where I sign . 
 Yes , thank you . I just want to have a smoke . Can I smoke in the aisle ? 
 OK . That's fine . 
 We have shuttle buses leaving for the airport from downtown every 20 minutes The bus stops at Holiday Inn as well . Be sure to get on the bus before 30 . 
 At 7 am . It takes about one hour to get to the airport . So it'll be right for your timing . 
 Your tickets are valid for one year.If you want to change flight , you just go to the airline's ticketing office and have it reconfirmed . But you have to fly the same airlines . 
 In that case . you can get a refund with a certain percentage of the original fare deducted as the service charge . 
 Give me Scotch , please . 
 Black Rose . 
 Just plain water with plenty of ice rock . 
 Maybe we all will be all things to all men . 
 But for the life , we'll be changed by this society . 
 Don't be silly . We have reached the age to take the responsibility by ourselves . 
 Let ’ s try to get out of the supermarket quickly . 
 What do we need ? Let ’ s make a list . 
 I want some pickles , oh , and we ’ re out of flour . Put that on the list , too . 
 Not that I can think of . Wait a second , we ’ re out of breakfast cereal . I think corn flakes are on sale . Get those . 
 John , have you ever watched Beijing Opera ? 
 What do you think of it ? 
 I couldn ’ t agree more . Actually , I ’ m a Beijing Opera fan . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Have you a pattern in your mind ? 
 Is there any special brand you would like ? 
 David , what do you want to do after graduation ? 
 That sounds like a hot job , right ? But in my opinion , you ought not to choose one career from that so-called list , and you need to take your interests , values , and skills into account . 
 You'd better ask for suggestions from a career counselor , and then make a decision . 
 Did you enjoy it ? 
 Why ! what happened ? 
 So how long did you stay ? 
 Hello , Tom . How do you find the dinner of yesterday ? 
 It's nice of you to say so . 
 Don't mention it . You know , we ’ re old friends . 
 Yes . Why ? 
 That ’ s great . I'd love to . 
 I work for a large multinational company called DAK Group . We have five main area of business - construction , heavy industry , shipbuilding , motor vehicles and telecommunications . 
 The motor vehicles division . I work in our Belgian factory . We manufacture components for our car production plants in Europe . 
 In Seoul . But the company has operations in over fifty countries and thirty factories all over the world . 
 Fantastic ! I got the promotion ! 
 After the new year . 
 Good coming . Are you through with the cleaning ? If not , we'll come back a little later . 
 It doesn't take much time . I'm used to tidying up my room myself . 
 I have a suit that needs cleaning . 
 Have you got any certificate of technical qualification ? 
 How long did it take you to get your driver's license ? 
 The total for all these items comes to $ 36.78 . 
 There is something wrong with your card . 
 Your card was declined . 
 Would you like me to try another card ? 
 What about cash ? 
 I ’ m sorry , but you can ’ t take the items until you can buy them . 
 Did you see the picture of the guy on the front page of the newspaper this morning ? 
 you've got to see it . It's an unbelievable picture ! 
 Well , this guy fell asleep on the sofa and when he woke up , half his face had been bitten off ! 
 They think his dog was trying to wake him up and couldn't , so ended up biting him in his face . 
 It looks pretty frightening . He doesn't have any lips , so all you can see are his gums and teeth . Most of his nose and chin are missing too . 
 He was actually quite handsome . What a shame . 
 It said that he's hoping to get a face transplant , but until then , he's looking forward to Halloween so he isn't the only one wearing a mask . 
 I'm looking for a pair of white sports shoes to go with my jeans . 
 Adidas . Size 38 . 
 Yes . ( After trying ) A bit tight actually , they pinch my toes . Have you got a larger pair . Size 39 ? 
 ( After trying ) Mm , this pair fits me well . I'll take it . How much is it ? 
 OK . Thank you . 
 Let me run and check . 
 Yes , Mr . Michael ? 
 I ’ m sorry , Mr . Michael . Could you tell me where the problems are exactly ? Maybe I misunderstood the client ’ s intentions . 
 What do you mean ? 
 You were ? 
 Sir , you can come downstairs right now to the computer lab . 
 Sir , each copy is ten cents or one dime , whichever you prefer . 
 Those were the good old days , sir , indeed . 
 We have no choice but to hold you responsible for the loss we sustained . 
 Well . I hope there won't be such things . 
 Hi , are you Catherine ? 
 Thanks , good to meet you , too . 
 Yes , and the food was horrible ! 
 Great ! How will we be getting there ? 
 I would like to get a bus pass . 
 Can you tell me my options ? 
 I would like the student pass . 
 Here you go . 
 How much will it be for the pass ? 
 That'll be fine . 
 You can keep these books for only half a month . 
 Of course , you can . 
 He is sly . He is actually angling for compliments . But he may have got the crush on you . 
 Keep your fingers crossed . He may pop the question one of these days . 
 Certainly . Let me see . Oh , it's on that self . 
 Of course . Here you are . 
 What's your favorite kind of music ? Do you like pop music ? 
 There was a concert country music last week . 
 I like it , too . But sometimes I enjoy jazz and classical music . 
 It really makes my blood boil when this sort of thing happens . I even want to wring his neck . 
 I can't forget it . 
 Mom , this is your third bowl of rice ! 
 Why ? I never saw you eat so much before . 
 So your stomach is the one that actually gets a lot of work-out . 
 This way you'll probably put on more weight . Will you give up ? 
 Then how are you gonna deal with the problem of getting extra weight ? 
 Oh , I've got an idea . Why don't you ask Dad to go with you ? He badly needs some exercise . 
 He can just say , I'm Benjamin . I'm new and shy . 
 Who knows ! 
 Sorry , I don ’ t know the rule about punching . 
 Do we also need to punch out after work ? 
 How about the lunch break , Lucy ? 
 May I ask whether we need to work overtime ? 
 I like these shoes . 
 Really ? 
 I need some flowers for my wife . It's her birthday . 
 How much are the roses ? 
 That sounds like a good deal . 
 I'll take a dozen . 
 No , the roses will be fine . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Is it a photograph or a document ? 
 Could I see both of them ? 
 You can't send this document ; it is not clear enough to send . The photograph is all right . 
 Couple of minutes . 
 5 $ . You should change another much clearer photograph for fax . 
 Bill , I'm expecting a big increase in turnover with the coming of the Mid-Autumn Festival . But wholesales are unwilling to supply my orders unless I pay them an advance of 50 % of the full price , for my business is fairly new . I hope that you can make me an advance on loan . 
 No . I should be grateful if you could see your way to make an advance against my personal reputation . You may inspect my accounts . From my accounts you can see that I've promptly met all my obligations . 
 Yes , I can . You know Mr . Macready , the famous car dealer here in New York . He agreed to act as my guarantor of a loan in the sum of US $ l0 , 000 until the end of this year . 
 Alan , I believe you have studied our catalogue and price list . Are you interested in some of our products ? 
 I'm very surprised to hear you say that . I think our price is very favorable . You can hardly get such an attractive price from other suppliers . 
 What's your proposal then ? 
 We could take a cut on the price if your order is a large one , but a 20 % reduction is really more than we can do . What quantity are you going to order from us then ? 
 5,000 dozen is by no means a large order . In that case , the best I can do is to give you a 5 % reduction . 
 What's your counter-offer then ? 
 15 % is impossible . That'll leave us almost no profit . 
 How about doing it this way ? You increase your quantity to 8,000 dozen and I'll give you a l0 % reduction . 
 Well , to encourage future business , I'm prepared to reduce the price by 10 % . We can't go any further . 
 Hello . This is Bell Canada . How can I help you ? 
 Okay . What day would you want your home phone cancelled ? 
 All right . I ’ ll do it for you by then . Anything else ? 
 Bye . 
 Oh , my god , are you OK ? 
 Come on , sit down , and let me have a look . 
 I told you to wear running shoes . But you don't listen . 
 Hold on , don't move , I will take care of that . 
 I will get some ice , and put it on your ankle.How does that feel ? 
 Be brave . Don't worry . You will be able to walk soon . 
 What's her last name ? 
 What color are her eyes ? 
 What color is her hair ? 
 How old is she ? 
 I have to check out now . My name is Ruth Carson . Can I have my bill , please ? 
 Thank you . 
 Have you ever considered that perhaps we have a morale problem among our employees ? If everyone is discontent with their work , of course they won't stick arround . 
 Inbreeding is a big drawback from snitching most of their employers from one or two companies . 
 Our human resource department is working on it , it's not easy to recruit new employees every few month , it's hard to find qualified people . 
 I wish I could unsay the sharp words to him . He must hate me very much . 
 Really ? Oh , thank Goodness ! 
 Oh ! I forgot all about it . Of course you can have it back , John . I'm sorry about the delay . 
 How long have you been washing clothes here ? 
 How come ? 
 This is my first time washing clothes here . 
 I can't wash at home because my machine is broken . 
 That'll cost too much . 
 I have no choice . 
 Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other . 
 Beneficial ? I don ’ t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating . 
 I doubt that . 
 Good heavens ! Don't bring that frog in the house . 
 What time does the next showing of Forrest Gump begin ? 
 What about the one after that ? 
 Well , I've been practising for 5 weeks . 
 No , once I did 32 . 
 Hi , bob . I ’ m reading a biography ? 
 It ’ s about Bob Dylan . 
 He ’ s a famous American musician . 
 It was written by Howard Sounds . 
 It ’ s great ! I ’ Ve learned a lot from reading it . 
 Sure , bob ! I ’ m on chapter 12 now , so I ’ m almost finished . 
 There are 15 chapters in total . 
 I should be done by Friday . I ’ ll give it to you in class then . 
 No problem . Bob . 
 It looks great . 
 Will this be cash or charge ? 
 Just sign here , please . 
 Here's your receipt . Have a nice day . 
 Really ? 
 You're right . 
 Why am I always the last to know these things ? 
 No , but Bean did send me like a hundred forwards today . My mailbox must have been overflowing . 
 He not only sent me nasty e-mail , but he's so bored , he even asked me to search the Net for even more forwards for him ! 
 Can you send a cab to pick me up ? 
 I'm on the corner of the Fifth and Mane . 
 I think women excel in every sport except the ones that are taboo for us to join in , like football . 
 Why do you care ? Women and men are different all around . I don't think they can be compared . 
 Well , I know some women who love golf and I know others who love contact sports . 
 Are you suggesting that anyone can be ? 
 Great . Send it to me by FedEx tomorrow morning . Or better , call Federal Express for a pick-up . That way I'll get it even earlier . 
 Don't worry about that . I'll reimburse you as soon as I receive the package . 
 OK . 
 Yes . Are you in his class ? 
 He really knew his stuff , but he graded hard . Would that be OK ? 
 I didn't find it overwhelming to earn a good grade if you work at it . Can you do that ? 
 Man , this guy was so funny when he was teaching . I like that , don't you ? 
 Did you know that he is a fairly new teacher and very current in his field ? 
 We all are looking for different things in an instructor . I hope I've helped you . 
 I want a facial . But this is the first time I've come here , so can you tell me how you do it ? 
 That's exactly what I want . How long does it take ? 
 What's the regular price ? 
 Good , I will take the one hour facial with make-up . 
 By the way , could you give me a manicure ? Use a light nail-polish , please . 
 I'm sorry , but I didn't catch what you said . 
 I'm trying to find a post office . 
 Should I take the bus ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Good morning , Maintenance Department . 
 Which air conditioner ? 
 What seems to be the problem ? 
 May I have your room number , please ? 
 OK , we'll send someone up to check it . 
 Fine . The housekeeper will open the door and stay in the room with the repairmen . 
 Sure . What do you know about the Olympic Games on the past ? For example , do you know where and when the first Olympic Games were held in the ancient times ? 
 Haven't the Olympics been stopped for a long time ? 
 I see . Look , do you know what that emblem means ? I've seen it so many times , but I don't know what it stands for . 
 I see . I believe there will be lots of foreigners coming to Beijing to watch the Games . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 Have you found a particular item from the card catalogue ? 
 Oh , maybe you can find something from the New York Times , or the Washington Post during that period . 
 You are welcome . 
 Do you have any blue shirts ? 
 I'm not familiar with American size . 
 It's pretty . May I try it on ? 
 Thank you . 
 You do ? I just bought this outfit a couple days ago . 
 I bought it from the Macy's at the Santa Anita mall . 
 Thanks . I think you look nice today , too . 
 Those are nice . What are they ? 
 Those are great . How much were they ? 
 I think I might go and find me my own pair of Chucks . 
 It's certainly a big improvement over yesterday . 
 Well , the worst of the winter should be over . 
 OK . I will catch you later . 
 Give me a chance to explain . I was no my way and I had an accident . 
 I am fine . In fact , I don't have a scratch on me or my vehicle . But the other guy is in critical condition . 
 Yes , I'm serious . I'm really sorry about missing your concert . 
 Of course I forgive you . What are friends for ? Now , what am I going to do for that other guy ? 
 Oh where was that ? 
 Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy.She is always making us kids eat the proper foods . 
 She will be 86 next month . 
 Crown Hotel . Reservation Desk . Can I help you ? 
 What kind of room would you like , sir ? We have single rooms , double rooms , suites and deluxe suites in our hotel . 
 All right . 
 The current rate is $ 100 per night . 
 For $ 100 you'll have a radio , a color television , a telephone and a major international newspaper delivered to your room every day . 
 I just discovered that I owe $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered . 
 That is absolutely incorrect ! I was out on the town Monday night . 
 Thank you for taking my word over the computer's word . 
 You can 
 Absolutely unbelievable ! You people should be ashamed of yourselves . 
 Good afternoon . Can I help you ? 
 Are you also suffering from pain and fever ? 
 I'll give you some tablets that should make you feel better . One moment , please . Here you are . Take these tablets three times a day swallow them with water . 
 Take on after each meal . 
 Take them for two days.If your symptoms persist for more than two days , you should see a doctor Also , be sure to drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration . 
 This is the last of the milk . 
 Would you get some that new cereal we saw advertise on TV . 
 You know . The one with the silly art about how advisements have jump up and down . 
 Yeah , That ’ s the one . 
 How have you been doing lately ? 
 Is there some reason why you can ’ t get enough sleep ? 
 When do you turn in for the night ? 
 Do you have a lot on your mind when you try to go to sleep ? 
 Do you ever meditate or read before bedtime ? 
 Could you tell me how to use the washer and dryer ? 
 Do you know how to turn them on ? 
 I need change for the machines ? 
 So what do I need to do ? 
 That's really all I have to do ? 
 Thanks for all your help . 
 Excuse me , doc . I am not feeling well . Can you help me ? 
 No , I haven't . Where do I go for that ? 
 Yes . 
 No , I'm here all by myself . 
 But I don't know where the registration office is . 
 Do I have to come back here after getting registered ? 
 Gynecology ? 
 Where are you going for your trip ? 
 But I heard the north of China are experiencing severe sandstorms ! 
 Yes , it's said that Hebes was experiencing six degree strong winds . 
 The report said the number of people with respiratory tract infections tended to rise after sandstorms . The sand gets into people's noses and throats and creates irritation . 
 You are quite right . 
 What a creep ! Phony good luck e-mails are one thing , but sexual harassment is crossing the line . 
 You could try using a spam filter to reject stuff that's obviously pornographic or anything else you don't want . 
 I don't know , sir . What's the number of your car ? 
 When did you bring it to us ? 
 Ah yes , I remember now . 
 No , they're still working on it . Let's go into the garage and have a look at it.Isn ' t that your car ? 
 Didn't you have a crash ? 
 Well , they're trying to repair it , sir . But to tell you the truth , you need a new car . 
 Yeah . Last semester . 
 It was Professor Johnson . 
 He's a terrible instructor and demands a lot , but fortunately , he's an easy grader . 
 I got an A - . Sounds good , but none of my test scores were that high , so I don't know how I got a decent grade . 
 Are you enjoying the class so far ? 
 Yes . Definitely stay in the class . You will get a better grade than your test scores . He does that deliberately to make all the students study a lot . 
 What's wrong with him ? 
 Annie , what is troubling you ? You look unhappy . 
 Do you like him ? 
 Then why are you hesitating ? 
 One love drives out another . You shouldn't be afraid to start a new relationship . 
 Next , please . 
 Let's see . Yes , here are your passports back . Did you pack your luggage yourselves ? 
 Did anyone approach you to ask you to carry anything for them ? 
 Are these four pieces all your luggage ? 
 You'd better attach these stickers to your carry-ons . 
 Here are your baggage claim stubs , miss . And here are your boarding passes . Your seats are 29K and 29J . Your flight leaves at Gate 7 , and we'll be boarding in about an hour and a half . 
 Have a nice flight . 
 Thank you . But a number of things have been going wrong lately . 
 Oh , the whole house needs re-painting for starters . The carpet in the living room is worn out , and I'd like to put in new wall-to-wall carpeting . Last week , I had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . Anyway , all par for the course when you own a house , I guess . I think I am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over . 
 Go right ahead . 
 Well , you really do have a talent for this , Alice . Thanks for the suggestions . 
 Hello , I need to come in and see the doctor . 
 I have really itchy skin and think I may have to have it looked at . 
 No , but I have a low fever . 
 I want to come in on Wednesday . 
 I would prefer Dr . Smith . 
 Come in , come in ! 
 I thought we were supposed to meet here . 
 I ’ m sorry . We must have misunderstood each other . 
 You ’ re right . I am sorry . Let ’ s go and watch the movie . 
 Do you think maybe it would be better to just talk to Vince ? Explain the situation ? 
 I don't think so . Your admirer seems kind of sweet . Aren't you even a little curious about him ? 
 A little distraction might do you some good , Zina . 
 Would you please be quiet , Ladies and Gentlemen ? 
 Quiet everybody ! 
 I am 24 . 
 I was born on April 15 , 1986 . 
 Log on to the website of American Embassy in Beijing and fill in the application forms . 
 Then make an appointment by telephone and wait for the interview . 
 It all depends . 
 About 800 yuan . 
 You are welcome . 
 We've got a beautiful two - double room with a bath an shower . 
 I'd like to reserve a table for two , my wife and I . 
 I'm not sure . Perhaps around 8 PM . 
 Juliet , Juliet Berman . 
 Non-smoking will be fine , please . But it is more important that you get a table by the window . It's our anniversary , and I'd like to be very special . 
 Thank you , goodbye . 
 How are you ? 
 How may I help you ? 
 What ’ s the problem ? 
 How much ? 
 What were you supposed to write it out for ? 
 I ’ ll just cancel it for you right now . 
 I'd like to reserve a room . 
 For the night of April 18th , for one night . 
 No , I'm afraid not . 
 Sure , but if you do have any cancellations , could you let me know as soon as possible ? 
 OK , thanks . 
 Just last week . 
 Oh , I loved it . I only visited a couple of cities , you know . But I had a great time . 
 They ’ re nice . 
 Yes , I am.You must be Tom.Nice to meet you . 
 Be careful , Tom.Those are pretty heavy . 
 Do you have the notes from last week's class ? 
 I couldn't make it . 
 I was sick . 
 Are these all of them ? 
 Thanks a bunch . 
 Rose , is this you ? 
 This is Susan . Would you mind taking charge of decorating the office for our Christmas party ? 
 You can get your supplies upstairs from Mrs . Horn . 
 You can ask Frank and Cathy to help you . 
 I want to go to the supermarket . 
 Let's get a shopping cart . 
 What are you going to buy ? 
 OK . I'd like some oranges . But they don't look quite ripe yet . 
 I'll take some , too . 
 OK . I'll go and buy some cakes . 
 No . Let's go over to the check-out stand . 
 Sure ... first you're going to have to buy a ticket to ride on the subway . The Wudaokou station is on the lightrail , so you'll have to transfer . Be sure you buy a combination ticket for the regular subway and the lightrail . It should cost you 5 yuan . 
 You can take the red line train from here , but you'll have to transfer to the blue line at Fuxingmen transfer station . After you transfer , take the blue line that is heading north towards Fuchengmen . 
 You'll take the blue line until you reach Xizhimen . That's a big station , so there will likely be a lot of people getting off at that stop . You can transfer to the lightrail there , you'll have to exit the subway and present the unused portion of your combination ticket to the Ticketmaster , they'll give you a new ticket to use on the lightrail system . 
 No , not the really , don't worry about it , like I said there'll be a lot of people there doing the same thing that you are doing , so just follow the crowd , There's only one direction to go , so you won't get on the wrong train . Head north on the Yellow line , and you'll see Wudaokou in just a couple of stops . 
 No , thanks . I'm full . 
 I ’ m not sure yet . I may take the train but then again I might take the bus . 
 Really ? Maybe I ’ ll do that then . 
 Ok . Thanks for that ! 
 He's going to turn six next month . 
 My mother-in - law . She retired last year . 
 Yeah , I know . 
 To a historic coffeehouse . It's got a little Mafia story to it . 
 Oh , yeah , while he was eating , and he was a pretty famous Don . 
 Sure . In fact , nowadays , you'll see more tourists there than Italians . There are Mafia tours nowadays that go there to eat . 
 I'll accompany my wife to the hospital . 
 She is expecting . 
 Thank you . 
 My invitation ? No , I haven't . My invitation to what ? 
 Whose house warming party is it ? 
 Oh , they have ? I didn't know . I haven't seen Tom lately . 
 Have you seen the house ? 
 Is it nice ? 
 Well , that does sound nice . Have they moved in yet ? 
 When are they going to have the party ? 
 Wow , that would be something to look forward to . 
 Well , i want to go to the university flea market , they got times of books , DVDs , and a lot of nice clothing , too . 
 Good idea , let's shop to we drop ! 
 Well , what game do you want to play ? 
 Do you know how to play it ? 
 OK . Teach me how to play the game . 
 Normally at six . Before that , they spend several years in the kindergarten or pre-school education center . 
 Right . In the countryside , things are more complicated . 
 It depends . In some poor , underdeveloped areas , children's education is a problem . Many kids cannot afford to go to school . 
 No , I ’ m afraid we don ’ t . 
 No , thanks , I ’ ll come back later . May I reserve a table for two ? 
 Bruce By the way , can we have a table by the window ? 
 That ’ s fine . 
 What's the most popular paper circulating in the community ? 
 Oh , thank you . I want one . 
 Good morning ! Welcome to our bank ! How may I help you ? 
 OK ! Come this way please . You should fill a form here first . Here you are . 
 If you don't mind , Mr . Smith , please go to counter number six to queue up and wait for the service . 
 My pleasure . 
 Sunday papers . I usually read them after coming back home from our company . 
 As you know , I am a sports fan . And these papers are famous for their sports section . So I will feel relaxed after grasping some information I am interested in . 
 Correct ! What about you , Fred ? 
 Don't overdo it . 
 I get drunk easily . 
 She's Betty.She ' s Mr Goldman's niece . 
 Yes , I'll be glad to . 
 You got it ! In a sense , it has become a byword for Chinese sport . 
 I think its critical advantage lies in its low cost . All you need is a racket , a table and a light celluloid ball . Tables are usually available in public recreation areas , like finest rooms , and outdoor playgrounds ... 
 Put it there ! In senior high schools , we used to play on desks in the classroom , when no vacant tables were available . Likewise , the racket may take a variety of forms , too.Anything that resembles a racket , from a plank to cardboard or even a hardcover book , may be used as a racket . 
 Yeah , the sport is affordable and accessible to every Tom , Dick and Jane in this developing country . No wonder even the state leaders are known to be keen on it . 
 Actually , he excels in it . Chairman Mao , too , encouraged the whole nation to play ping-pong as a part of the nationwide body building campaign . 
 You have done an excellent job this year and we are pleased with the results . 
 As a result of your performance , we are happy to offer you the position of manager . 
 Yes , it does . 
 Your monthly gross salary will increase by $ 500 . 
 I am an eloquent speaker in the classroom . But when I face a stranger outside , I get tongue-tied and nothing comes out . 
 I will go out of my way to catch the attention of the interviewer . 
 I ’ m very shy . I think I might shake in my boots at the moment I meet the interviewer . 
 Another problem is that I dare not look into their eyes whenever I meet strangers , especially foreigners . 
 Is there anything else that I should pay attention to in an interview ? 
 I ’ ll remember to bring gum with me . 
 I remember now . Your advice is very helpful . 
 OK , sir . We will be there right now ... sir , your table is ready . 
 Sure , here you are . 
 My brother did it . 
 I laughed up my sleeves at him . He ’ s seen his girlfriend off at the airport and had lipstick on his face and did not know it . 
 I used to hold a similar job for six years . 
 I think so . 
 are you looking for somewhere for two people ? 
 yes , there are several place available in that price range near the university . do you have any other requirements ? 
 how many rooms do you need in the flat ? 
 ok . i've got a list of place that fit your requirements . let's just go through them . the first on the list costs 80 pounds a month , but it's on a noisy street and it's a little far from t 
 it's about two miles away . that might be a little far to walk . here's one that's about half a mile from the campus . the cost is 100 pounds a month and it's on a small street , just off a 
 of course . i'm not very busy at the moment . if you can wait for about 15 or 20 minutes . i can take you there . 
 Flip it to channel 9 , will you , Janet ? There's a big basketball game on in a couple of minutes . 
 Oh , yeah , smarty-pants ? Over my dead body . Now , don't be such a brat and ... 
 I don't know ! The picture went blank all of a sudden . It's probably the picture tube . 
 Yeah . Oh well , how about a game of cards instead ? 
 Do you have any year-end benefits ? 
 I just saw a piece of news , that a group of white color workers hold a flour war in the office because of dissatisfaction of the year-end benefits . 
 They got rice , flour and oil as presents , while the leadership got 1000 yuan shopping card . 
 It is said that the presents they got value less than 200 yuan , and it is no use for them at all , because they don't cook by themselves . 
 How about going swimming ? 
 Why don ’ t we down to the pool ? It ’ s not too far from here . 
 You shouldn't have told her the truth.What can we do now ? 
 You are always like this . I've told you many times not to tell her . 
 It's too late to say sorry now.Oh , what am I going to do ? 
 What kind of gas does this car take ? 
 I will give you premium unleaded . Alright ? 
 That is the pump you are in front of . 
 It is the most expensive . 
 Yes , I can give you regular unleaded . But you have to back up the car a little . 
 I'm sorry , sir . This is not a full service gas station . I will help you fill the gas , but we don't wash windows here . 
 So Peter , do you have a favorite comedy ? 
 You know what comedy I really like ? " Ace Ventura , Pet Detective . " I think Jim Carry is really funny . 
 I agree . But even though I like comedies , I usually prefer more serious films . My favorite movie is " Titanic . " 
 We have only one mid-size car left . 
 It's 40 $ plus tax per day on limited mileage . 
 Can I see your driver's license ? 
 Please sign here . 
 Fine , just fine.Thanks . 
 Well , as a matter of fact , I've got a lunch date with Bob Thomas . 
 Certainly , sir . How much do you draw ? 
 Yes , sir . Your balance is RIB 34,000 . 
 For here or to go ? 
 It's here at last ! 
 Twenty minutes exactly . 
 OK . I'm coming . 
 Thank you . You are so considerate . 
 OK . This key is too high for me . 
 OK . Let me have a try ... 
 Thank you . I'm sure you will . 
 Thank you for bringing me here Hong , this place looks great ! 
 Let me see . How about the lotus root ? 
 Oh , yes that would be nice . 
 Actually , I ’ m vegetarian so I ’ d like to have the bean curd . 
 Dave , there's something I want to talk to you about . 
 I've been talking to WebTracker . I'm thinking of jumping ship . 
 Keep your voice down . We'll talk more later . Right now I need to see Vince . 
 OK , but don't tell anyone what I said . 
 Will do . 
 Ma'am , take your kid to school ? 
 No problem . Don't worry , the taxi is faster than the bus . 
 My son is the same . But he always makes an early start in the morning , and enjoys listening to the English programmer Let's talk in English on the way . 
 OK ! 
 It's 14.5 Yuan . 
 Thanks , Ma'am . 
 Yes , do you have any flights to Sydney next Tuesday afternoon ? 
 That's fine . Could you tell me how much a return flight costs ? I'll be staying three weeks . 
 Economy , please . 
 OK . Could I make a reservation ? 
 The 16:45 , please . 
 My name is Mary Jones , that's M-A-R-Y J-O-N-E-S . 
 Can I pay at the check-in desk when I pick up my ticket ? 
 I see . 
 Thank you . 
 I feel horrible . I think I picked up a bug . 
 A lot of people in my dorm are sick . Perhaps I picked it up there . 
 I ’ Ve been taking vitamin C and zinc and trying to get some rest . 
 My grandmother swears by hot chicken soup for a cold . 
 Yes , if I get worse , I will definitely look for extra help with this . 
 My company wants to become involved in your Comprehensive Credit Granting . We are a very young company and I'm not at all sure if we meet your credit requirements . 
 That would be wonderful . Thank you so much for all of your help . 
 Do you really like it ? 
 It wasn't very expensive either . 
 Jason , it's your turn . 
 You rolled a four . Let's see ... you landed on Foreign Films . 
 Well , too bad . So , what foreign film won an Oscar in 1993 ? 
 The answer is Belle Opaque . It's a Spanish movie , and the title means The Age of Beauty in English . 
 Amenities ? What do you mean by amenities , sir ? 
 I see . Sir , if I may ask . Have you used up all the amenities in your room ? 
 Then what is the problem , sir ? 
 Souvenirs ? 
 We do have a souvenir shop on the first floor , sir . 
 I'll call housekeeping . Someone will be up with more amenities shortly . 
 Why do you say that ? 
 Many people work for the federal government their entire adult lives . Government service can be a rewarding and secure career . 
 Well , many positions pay salaries that are comparable to those in private industries . 
 Sometimes that ’ s true , but not usually . Most feds are honest , hard-working professionals . It ’ s hard to keep highly trained people , so the pay and working conditions have to be attractive . 
 I ’ m a GS - 15 . That ’ s high on the scale of workers , but even a GS - 1 is paid a living wage . 
 Do you know what package you want to get ? 
 We have movie channel packages . 
 You can get the sports package . 
 We have that package . 
 Is there anything else you would like ? 
 You will be able to add or get rid of channels another day . 
 To tell you the truth , it was completely accidental . 
 I said please stop by the entrance of EVA Air at the Arrival Terminal . 
 Oh , no . That ’ s it . Nice to chat with you . Have a good day . 
 Let's have some lunch ; do you know of a great restaurant somewhere ? 
 Maybe just a quick sandwich , salad , or something . 
 Can we walk there ? 
 Of course ! Let's go . 
 Are you going to vote ? 
 Do you know who you ’ re going to vote for ? 
 What ’ s so great about him ? 
 Oh , really ? 
 That ’ s good to hear . 
 I hope so . 
 I think this painting would look good in our living room . What do you think ? 
 Can you help me plan the office party ? 
 I need help with food . 
 I think it should be casual . 
 I would prefer Chinese food for this party . 
 I think we should hire a live band . 
 I'm going to let Bob know about the merger . 
 Why ? 
 Confronted with difficult questions in an interview , the job-hunters mostly will be at a loss about what to do . 
 Still , there are some rules to follow . 
 Don't get nervous and freaked out . 
 There should be neither too much silence nor hasty answers 
 Don't be discouraged even when confronted with negative questions 
 Anyway , what really matters is that you have tried your best . 
 Now you're my boss , Mr . Henry . 
 No , nothing in particular . 
 All right . When can I start ? 
 Yes , they are . 
 I want to use these coupons . Have they expired ? 
 Yes , could you use plastic bags ? 
 Could you charge it to my credit card ? 
 Here you are . 
 Sure . 
 Thank you . 
 Oh , I went on a holiday in the city of Chende . 
 The city is small , not very modern , but there are many mountains with lots of trees around the city , so the air there is pretty fresh . 
 Certainly ! The most attractive place is that , it's very large ; it is 8 times the size of Forbidden City and 16 times the size of Summer Palace . The art of gardens is perfectly represented in it . 
 Yes , I think the reason is that there is a big lake , and many trees in the Resort . 
 The main product of Chende is various kinds of ferine mushroom and the almond . The mushroom tastes really good , and it is very different from the common mushrooms , and the snack made of almond is delicious . 
 I ’ m a new student . My name ’ s Robert . 
 Are you French ? 
 No , I ’ m not . 
 I ’ m Italian . Are you a teacher ? 
 What ’ s your job ? 
 I ’ m an engineer . 
 What are you so excited about ? 
 What ’ s the big deal ? It ’ s just a picture of some woman . 
 There are tons of other paintings that I think are better . 
 No , how much is it worth ? 
 Whoa . 
 With my experience , I'd like to start at 3,000 RIB per month . 
 I think you will find I am worth it . 
 What do you want ? 
 What kind of food do you want to get ? 
 Do you know where you're going to get it ? 
 I go to Panda Express for my Chinese food . 
 I really like the food . 
 I think you'll enjoy the food . 
 Hmm . That must be the DVD player that another one of my friends donated . He owns one of the largest electronics stores in Taipei ! 
 Don't worry ! There are a lot more prizes ! I know , because the prizes are all from companies that I work with ! 
 Honey , I've got good news for you . 
 You are going to be a father . 
 Yes . We'll have our baby soon . 
 Me , too . 
 I guess we should start with nominees first . 
 We should probably let everyone know ahead of time so they will be prepared . 
 Yes , I can do that this afternoon . 
 Yes , let me put it on the calendar . 
 This is Mary speaking . Who is that ? 
 Yes , I do , but today I went shopping and have only just come back . It is very nice to hear your voice , Bob . I didn ’ t know you were in New York . 
 Yes , I am going to meet a client . 
 I am sorry , Bob . If you had told me you were coming up , I would have kept tonight free . But you didn ’ t tell me . 
 I thought Henry usually did the conferences . 
 I ’ m free tomorrow but I suppose that will be too late . 
 I ’ d like to . But Bob , are you sure it will be all right ? I would hate you to make your boss angry or even lose your job . 
 Why did you stay an extra night in Boston ? What happened ? 
 See you tomorrow . 
 Yeah ! He is a nice guy . He is very helpful and always bends over backward to help those who are in need of help . 
 Sure . 
 Well , I must apologize , madam . We have new computers here , you know . 
 I agree entirely . I assure you it won't happen again . 
 First you make a list of what you wanna buy ... 
 Well , that ’ s a problem , isn ’ t it ? 
 Well , nothing special , reading , watching TV , walking , and so on . 
 No , I don't have any hobbies . How about you ? 
 Really ? How many collections do you have ? 
 Among those collections , which is the most expensive ? 
 I was looking at my test score and think that it should be higher . 
 I think an answer got marked wrong that should have been marked right . 
 That would be great ! 
 This one right here should be right . 
 Yeah , let's do the math . 
 Looks pretty good . 
 You look pale recently . 
 Take good care of yourself . 
 Maybe you should have told me first ? 
 Because we're partners . 
 I would appreciate it if you could go to the store for me . 
 Here's a list with a few things that I need you to get . 
 I don't think I forgot anything . 
 If you don't mind , I would appreciate it if you would pick up my prescription . 
 Someone at the pharmacy called and told me it was ready . 
 Thank you . 
 How much would it cost to send this special delivery to England ? 
 Yes . I'd like to send a $ 20 money order . 
 Flight BE 407 to Rome is delayed . Will passengers please wait in the lounge ? 
 The time of departure will be announced as soon as possible . 
 Has Mien sold his house yet ? 
 Has he moved to his new house yet ? 
 When ? Tomorrow morning ? 
 He's a very nice person . We will all miss him . 
 I think that they will move in the day after tomorrow . 
 Yes , I will . 
 No , he didn't want to leave , but his wife did ! 
 My major is Automobile Designing and I have received my master's degree in science . I think I can do it well . 
 I am a student engineer who mainly took charge of understanding of the mechanical strength and corrosion resistance of various materials . 
 Yeah . What's going on ? 
 Yeah . It's been a couple of months since I saw you . 
 I just started working out . 
 I joined the Samsung Health Club last month . 
 I concentrate mostly on my legs , chest , arms and stomach . 
 It's hard work while exercising , but it is a great feeling when I get done . 
 Exercising at home is hard . The environment is not suited for exercising . 
 I have a couple of guest passes . You want to check out my health club ? 
 Great . I'll call you Saturday morning . 
 Ok . Bye . 
 I graduated from Songhua University . 
 I graduated from it in 2002 . 
 I had a wonderful time . The rooms are not very big , but they are well furnished . The restaurant is excellent and reasonably priced . There ’ s a sauna and a Jacuzzi . 
 No , they don ’ t . they have a beauty parlor , but I didn ’ t go there . 
 It ’ s very good . Check in and check out at the reception only took a few minutes . The wait staff is very good . A waiter recommended their baked fish , which tasted wonderful . The hotel was quite full , so I ’ d suggest making a reservation if you intend to go there . The hotel offers a discount at the weekends . 
 There was a problem with the internet access , so I couldn ’ t check my email , but I didn ’ t complain about it to the management . 
 Yes , I was . Here ’ s their business card . 
 No , there wasn ’ t . There is a bar on the ground floor and of course you can buy drinks in the restaurant to go with your meal . 
 I know . At the inland hotel , they have an interesting policy . When you check out , you put some money in a special box at reception . Each evening , the money in the box is shared equally by the hotel staff . 
 Of course . I can't live without it , so I always bring my CD with me no matter where I go . 
 Light music and classic music . 
 But I didn't get the ticket . And it is said that they were sold out yesterday . 
 Amazing ! I can imagine the feeling when I hear the smooth tune around my ears . 
 You flatter me . 
 Yes . I have a great team working with me . 
 Many thanks . 
 Come in , please . 
 Oh , very good . I've been waiting for your report all week . 
 OK , I will see it soon . You can go back now . 
 Bye . 
 Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ’ t you ? 
 I never understand the meaning of those painting . They are too abstract for me . I didn ’ t pay much attention in art class at school . 
 I like sculpture , especially that form ancient rome or Greece . What time are you thinking of going ? I ’ d love to go with you . 
 That sounds fine . What time shall we meet at the bus stop ? 
 Excuse me , could you help me pick out a lotion ? 
 I got poison oak while hiking , and I need something to help me with the itching . 
 Which do you prefer ? 
 Is there anything else I can do to help with the itching ? 
 Thank you so much for all of the information . 
 What schools have you attended ? 
 How do you think the education you have received will contribute to your work in this company ? 
 Your graduation thesis was on Medical Application of Laser , right ? What were your conclusions ? 
 Hello , what can I do for you ? 
 No problem . No matter what ’ s wrong with it , I can surely meet your satisfaction . 
 Oh , here . I ’ m afraid it ’ ll be difficult to repair . 
 Yes , I can . To tell you the truth , I ’ m the best nearby . 
 Right , drink as much as you can . 
 Yes , you do . The Hot Cap is back here in the corner . I think we're ready to put the curlers in . What kind of perm would you like ? 
 All right . What if we leave your bangs straight and just perm the sides and back ? 
 Around 30 minutes . 
 Yes . Do you want to go with me ? 
 Now that take this seat . Do you see those piles of red diplomas on the desks on the stage ? 
 That's true . Four years ' trails and hardships , joys and sorrows of life are gushing out to my mind all together . I can hardly tell whether I am joyful or gloomy at the moment when I am about to leave the campus and to start a new stage of my life . 
 He's going to make the opening speech . 
 Yes . Go straight ahead till you come to the traffic lights , turn left there and it's the first turning on the right . 
 That's it . It'll take you about five minutes . 
 Mr.Martin , we're on arrival . 
 We'll miss you . I hope we'll keep in touch . 
 It's my pleasure . We hope you'll visit Beijing again . 
 It's almost time to get aboard . 
 Bye bye ! Have a pleasant journey ! 
 Of course , there're too many people . 
 But we couldn't help it . 
 Okay . 
 It suits my taste . You are really a good cook . 
 Wow , let me try . It tastes nice . How did you make it ? 
 Hello ! So , you're back . Do you have everything with you ? 
 We will need detailed information regarding the full name of the company , the company address ... 
 And also , the bank and branch name the company holds an account with and the account number . 
 What's the purpose for this check ? Would you like to know its repayment capacity ? 
 As it's confidential there is a certain amount of red tape , but it shouldn't take too long . There is , of course a service fee of 300 RIB to be paid . 
 Walker Airline Travel Agency.May I help you ? 
 I am sorry . All the seats are booked . How about next Monday ? 
 OK , sir . I have added your name to the waiting list.We will call you as soon as possible . 
 Rock music really leaves me cold . What about you ? 
 Then tell me what's good about it . 
 Hello , could I make a reservation ? 
 6 o'dock in the evening . 
 Do you offer mutton hot pot at noon ? 
 Then we will come here for lunch tomorrow . 
 Is this Susan ? 
 Oh well , do you know if the Susan Li is available ? 
 I see an Open House sign over there , and I think we should go check it out . 
 Yes , I see it listed on the printout we got off of the Internet . 
 We need to make sure to put our names in the registry so the realtor knows we were here . 
 On such a hot day , it is thoughtful to have water out for potential buyers . 
 What is the price of this house in the flyer ? 
 I'm going to have some people over for dinner Saturday night.Would you like to join us ? 
 Some other time then ? 
 welcome back ! How was your vacation ? 
 where did you end up going ? 
 I've always wanted to go to Paris . The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! Did you go to the top ? 
 sure . What's this one a picture of ? 
 you don't look very happy in that picture . 
 so what did you do ? 
 my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . Did you go to the Louvre ? 
 that's what everyone says ! I can't wait to see it for myself some day . 
 I think our smoked fish will be to your taste . 
 Can I ask you what the office rules are ? 
 Is it from 9:00 to 12:00 in the morning and 1:00 to 5:00 in the afternoon ? 
 Wangfujing Grand Hotels . How can I help you ? 
 Could you hold the line , please ? I will check out our room availability for those days ... Yes . we have a few vacancies next weekend . We have double rooms , suites and deluxe suites in Japanese , Roman . French and presidential styles , which one do you like best ? 
 OK . Could I have your name , please ? 
 OK , Ms . Monica . I've reserved a double room for you next Saturday and Sunday night . We will see you then ! 
 Did you sign up for the picnic party ? 
 This time you can bring your daughter with you . 
 There are times of games planned , should have a grand time . 
 Poor man , he must be terribly fed up with it . 
 Oh , Really ? 
 I'll just have water . 
 It's OK . 
 Don't be silly . 
 All right . Next time you will treat . 
 I wonder if you could allow us any discount for this commodity . It's the general practice that wholesalers usually get some discount from manufacturers or suppliers . 
 But we usually get a discount of 3 % to 5 % from our other suppliers . Actually , some discount on your prices would make it easier for us to promote sales , you know . 
 Did you understand question number three ? 
 What arrangement will you make about payment ? 
 At sight of course . 
 I am afraid that can't be done . We have never done business on such terms . 
 We ask for full payment at sight , because we guarantee 90 % mechanical efficiency for all our products . You don't have the same guarantee from other suppliers . The usual percentage is around 85 . 
 Yes . We usually send technicians abroad to offer after-sales service to our customers . 
 Thank you . I am glad we have come to an agreement at last . 
 We'd like to buy some furniture for our new house . 
 We like a larger wardrobe . 
 Yeuks ! Do they know anything about me ? 
 I'm a little nervous ! 
 How Ay people will be there at dinner ? 
 That's good , I'm usually more comfortable in bigger families . 
 Yes , just tinned meat . 
 No , it ’ s beef . 
 Well , you ’ d better heat it before you eat it . 
 Why do you think so ? 
 How do you sleep ? 
 Are you worried about anything ? 
 Well , there's nothing much wrong with you . You're under too much pressure . 
 Yeah , I come here every now and then . 
 Coming . What do you want today ? 
 Our fruit is very fresh today . Do you want some ? 
 Three for ten cents . 
 Anything else ? 
 Twenty eight dollars . 
 Yes , I'm a very good mother and successful career woman . 
 I think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself , like keeping housework simple , spending money on things that make life easier , buying yourself things you like , and so on . You can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself . 
 Yes . He is very understanding and supportive . 
 Why are you so kind to him ? 
 So that's how it is ! Now he ’ s in trouble , but I belive he will rise to his own feet again . 
 Can you study with the radio on ? 
 What is the difference ? 
 That's true , but then you have to buy a record player . 
 About 6 in the morning . I like to walk to the office . 
 About 20 minutes . Do you live alone ? 
 How old is she ? 
 I think so . 
 Well , if you can meet our deadline . 
 I also hope your quality will meet our standard . 
 Excellent . We will meet all your conditions if you can meet our demands . 
 How long have you got ? 
 Okay , I'll make you some food . 
 Sure , honey . I'll read you a bed time story , too . 
 Don't worry , you'll sleep well tonight . 
 Why did you buy that painting ? 
 It looks like some kind of mistake . 
 Oh . Who is the artist ? 
 Oh ! How about we hang it over here where everyone can see it ? 
 Nowadays , ships and boats are no longer so important in transportation as they used to be . 
 I read in the newspapers that the passenger liners from Shanghai to Ningpo and Dalian have been out of business ; and the liners up and down the Yangtze River have been reduced by 70 % . 
 But the most of the transoceanic cargo transportation is still carried by boat . 
 Don ’ t sweat it . We will land safely . 
 Yes , it is . As you know , some of the materials we use are highly-flammable so we have a very strict non-smoking policy in the factory . 
 It means there must be no naked flames or sparks anywhere near flammable materials . If the materials ignite , it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you inhale them . 
 OK . Do you think we can go buy a newspaper first ? 
 Are we going to walk or drive ? 
 The weather is good now , but I think it's suppose to rain this afternoon . 
 No , he's still sleeping . 
 Yeah , he didn't come home until 12:00 AM . 
 I hope so too . I'll give him a call when we get there . 
 It's straight down this road on the left , next to the museum . It takes about 10 minutes . 
 All of the produce is in aisle A . 
 Here you go . Look in this flyer , or check with the produce person . 
 Yeah , we don ’ t live in the vacuum . We have traditional values and long but different history . 
 But there is always somebody who wants to turn his back on the true history . 
 Hi . Today , I am the interviewer for your visa application . 
 Can you tell me why do you want a visa to America ? 
 OK . Do you plan to go to America all by yourself or with your family ? 
 Have you finished all you preparation ? 
 You look fresh recently.How do you make it ? 
 Aren't you tired ? 
 May I bring you a salad ? 
 Rose-petal salad . 
 Well , what a nice day ! 
 But it was not at all so fine yesterday . 
 Did it ? 
 I was fast asleep , and didn't hear a thing . 
 Maybe . I see some dark clouds moving in . 
 It'll be dusty , too , I guess . 
 Why is that ? 
 I see . The fall in Beijing is really beautiful . 
 Then what about spring ? 
 It must be cold in the winter , though . 
 Thanks for reminding me . 
 What seems to the trouble Mr Brown ? 
 Oh , In what way . 
 Did you lose any weight ? 
 when was the last time you have track up ? 
 Let me take your blood pressure . You look anilic . Well , Mr.Brown . I ’ m happy to say it ’ s nothing serious . You just a little run down from overwork . 
 I think you ’ ll needs just vacation . Try to get out doors more . I ’ ll be sure if you get more rest . 
 Reservation , may I help you ? 
 For how many people ? 
 May I have your name ? 
 I am going on a business trip to Guangzhou next Monday morning . 
 Yes , as the New Year is coming , they ’ re organizing a party for all their customers . 
 Sure . 
 No , no one has informed me of that so far , tell me . 
 I see . What about the maximum purdy and rate , any change ? 
 I will call them this afternoon , thanks . 
 Excuse me , ma'am , can I help you find anything ? 
 What size do you wear ? 
 How about this pair ? 
 How about these ? 
 Well , there's this pair . 
 Well , what did you think about the last candidate ? Do you think we should hire her ? 
 What made you think that she wasn't very confident ? 
 She was a bit nervous , I guess . What else ? 
 you're right . If she walked into meetings with our clients like that , it would make our company look bad , wouldn't it ? 
 I agree . I guess I was paying more attention to her answers than her body language . 
 That's true . I guess we'll have to keep looking for a manager then . 
 Hey Susan , what are you coming as this year ? 
 Yeah ... for Halloween ! We have a big office party tomorrow evening . There's a prize for best costume ! 
 Really ! You don't have some kind of Chinese ghost festival ? 
 Cool ! A whole month ! What do you do during that month ? 
 Feed them ? 
 And then later everyone eats the food ? 
 It makes sense , right ? Who else is going to eat it ? 
 But no dressing up like ghosts , right ? 
 Would you find any other available flight to Tokyo ? 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , of course . I think our travel agent would have made the reservation for us . 
 Are you sure ? We can't really take it ? I reconfirmed with Miss Peterson the other day . 
 I've come to hear about your offer . 
 I can tell you right now that your prices are a little higher than we expected . 
 I am afraid I can't agree with you there . I must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies . 
 I agree that yours are of the top . 
 To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 % would help . 
 Right . A reduction of 5 % is acceptable . 
 I'm not sure about that . How would people get to work ? 
 Well , it may not be that simple . Not everyone likes public transport . 
 Well , I don't often use them , I wouldn't really know . 
 Which kind of internet connection do you want to get ? 
 There is dial-up or DEL . 
 I would get DEL if I were you . 
 It's the best choice ; plus , it won't tie up your phone line . 
 Dial-up is connected through your phone , unlike DEL . 
 Exactly . With DEL you don't have that problem . 
 Why is that ? 
 And the downstairs neighbors ? 
 Sounds ideal . We'll get back to you in a couple of days then . 
 If they are just like us , they are not middle-aged . 
 Middle-aged means in the middle , Ethel , middle of life . People don't live to a hundred and fifty . 
 Oh , you know , we are not middle-aged . You're old , and I'm aging . 
 I can if you like . 
 Could you do me a favor ? 
 Can you help me move this table ? 
 Are you telling me you ’ re not going to meet with me ? 
 Well , I don ’ t like it , but I guess I don ’ t have any choice . 
 Well I think I can afford that apartment . But are pets allowed ? 
 That's great . That means I can bring my cat , Mr . Twinkles . Where is the apartment located ? 
 Oh that ’ s a lovely necklace . 
 Oh I didn ’ t know you were married . 
 Oh I see . That ’ s nice . Did you meet your husband at work ? 
 What a nice day ! Why don't we go for an outing ? 
 How about going to the suburbs ? 
 How was Elvin ? 
 Another note ? But how ? I didn't see anyone ! 
 Uh-oh . He's heating up . What are you going to do now ? 
 You do ? Who ? 
 Yes , of course.The dressing room is over there . 
 I like Chinese food . 
 We have a lot of Chinese restaurants in America . 
 I am reading . 
 No , not yet . But I like to see what is available . 
 Of course , have a seat . 
 Yes , nice . But I prefer this wooden house with a garden fence and a sloping roof . 
 Well , you can't compare a small balcony to this large veranda . This is perfect for having a barbecue in summer . 
 Yes , next Saturday . I hope you can make it . 
 Can I help you ? 
 I'm sorry , sir . Just hold the line , please . Now the line is connected . Go ahead please . 
 Judy , have you ever made out how much money shall we spend ? 
 What ? That's too much . 
 Ah , the transportation fee always takes a great part in the budget . 
 Hmm , what I'm fearful of is that the accommodation will also deteriorate once we choose a cheaper hotel . 
 Miss Gray , would you please type this report for me ? 
 Can you print it out before 12 o'clock ? I need it this afternoon . 
 Please double space it and print it out on the laser printer so I can read it easily . 
 Please type it in a formal style . 
 No , thanks . 
 Look , I've already paid for the tickets , so whether you like it or not we're going to finish watching it . 
 Come on . Give it a chance . The movie just started . 
 Were you here last week ? 
 How come ? 
 Well , here are the notes . 
 Sorry , here you go . 
 No problem . 
 Pardon ? 
 Zina , I hope you're not scheming to make Elvin look bad . 
 Dave then ? Dave is a spy for WebTracker ? You can't be serious . 
 My eyes water continuously . Why ? 
 What is there in the air ? 
 I can't believe that the air in this city is so dirty . 
 So do I . 
 Maybe you are right . 
 I know and they are really nice , too . 
 Me , too . 
 Good idea , especially at this price . 
 Which ? Zina ? What time is it ? 
 What note ? I can't see . I just pulled an all-nighter . 
 And ? What does it say ? Isn't there a name ? 
 did you know that abortion is still illegal in many states in the USA ? 
 well , for many religious people , they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers . 
 no , I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions . 
 religious people blame it on pre-marital sex , not on abortion being illegal . 
 I personally would never want to have one , but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself . 
 I know this is going to sound sexist , but I don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children . 
 that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . Men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand . 
 Professor , could I make an appointment with you ? 
 Two o'clock would be the best time . 
 No , I'm not sure . 
 I see . 
 I'll see you then . 
 Hello ! 
 Hi , Jason ! Long time no see . How's the hotel ? 
 I know what you mean . 
 I am leaving in two weeks . 
 Oh , I am sorry , Jason . I've already got plans for Friday evening . How about Saturday ? 
 7 is fine with me . 
 I'll be waiting . 
 But it's also a sort of exercise and it's good to your health . 
 You're complaining again . 
 I am kind of busy right now , but maybe later next week I could stop by . 
 What problems did you find ? 
 I don ’ t really consider any of that to be my responsibility . You can fix those things yourself . 
 I am maintaining the building . You are way too picky ! 
 You wouldn ’ t dare do that ! 
 No ... mom said that we'll have the wedding at home on the 2nd . So let's hope your mom is right about that being a lucky day ... 
 They're going to give us back the seats ? 
 Hawaii ? My dream honeymoon destination ? 
 Oh , Jack ! That's wonderful ! 
 The Grand Hotel . 
 Yes.Do you know where it is ? 
 It's the 11th Avenue , Park Street . 
 Well , what about it ? As it happens I've got two tickets for next thursday evening . I thought perhaps . 
 But I said thursday.The tickets are for thursday evening . 
 I see.Oh , well some other time perhaps . 
 This is a nice set of wheels . How much did the dealer charge you for this ? 
 Okay then , let ’ s go fast ! Whoa ! This thing can really accelerate fast . 
 Hey , just watch out for cops or you ’ re gonna end up in the slammer . You know you tend to go fast ? 
 Now watch ... some guys probably run a light and hit your car . 
 How do you do ? I need your help in selecting a foreign market to invest ! 
 How can I find out what countries to invest ? 
 Great . I want to get an idea for the purchasing ability in various countries . 
 There are thousands of magazines published in the world to meet the needs of different readers . But only a few of them are influential world-wide . 
 But I think Digest is supposed to be the top one . Its subscribers or buyers are from all social classes , perhaps , a majority of them from the educated group . It's quite strange that the readers love it after reading it . 
 Welcome to Youth Travel Agency . Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Why not come here and have a look at the guidebook ? 
 Let me see . It's a one day tour . 
 Yes , but don't cut them yet . Wait until they cool . Where is the big plastic bowl ? 
 What's Donna like , by the way ? 
 Oh , Paul is very easy-going and friendly . 
 Yes , sure . Which cupboard is it in ? 
 There is no pepper here . 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 You have really good taste . It's the best seller right now . 
 Sure . 
 Hello , I'd like to reserve a hotel room . 
 My name is John Sandals . 
 I'm planning to visit New York from Friday , April 14 until Monday , April 17 . 
 How much per night are we talking about ? 
 That price is perfectly acceptable . 
 Nonsmoking , please . 
 That sounds fine . 
 Certainly . My phone number is 626-555-1739 . 
 Good morning , May . Good girl , you are reading English books again . 
 Oh , yes , my daughter bought it yesterday . We call her Lulu . 
 Yes . Just look at her colorful feathers . What else can it be ? 
 Really ? A foreign parrot ! 
 Maybe you can teach Lulu some English words . 
 How was the party ? 
 Excuse me , driver . Does this bus go to the museum ? 
 How long is the ride ? 
 Thank you.How much is the fare ? 
 Would you please let me know when we get to the stop ? I am a stranger here . 
 Hi , John , how was your vacation ? 
 That must have been wonderful . Do anything interesting ? 
 Wow ! Isn ’ t that dangerous ? 
 Tell me about it . 
 500 feet ! I would never be able to do that . 
 Can I help you ? 
 That's $ 38 , sir . 
 Sorry sir.We can't . Cash only . 
 Thank you.Have a nice day . 
 I think I ’ m tough not only physically but mentally . 
 I have been playing football since high school . At present , I ’ m a member of a community football club . 
 Yes . I practice every weekend with my teammates . 
 I never get tired . I think this comes from practicing football . 
 Frankly speaking , I ’ m a typical Chinese workaholic . I don ’ t mind working late at night . Due to that , I tend to leave the office late . 
 So far I haven ’ t met any particular kind . However , I may rule out those who prefer chatting to working . 
 It depends on the type of work . Usually I prefer to work alone , because I ’ m self-motivated . But I can work either way . If necessary , I don ’ t hesitate to join the team . 
 What do we get this morning ? 
 I ’ d like to a glass of tomato juice please . 
 Yes . A dish of cornmeal weight . 
 Yes . Baked eggs and buttered toast . I like my baker very crazy . 
 Fried , please . 
 No , that ’ s enough , thank you . 
 Thanks to your help.To our friendship . 
 Dancing . The boys from the Campus Band have promised to play music for us . 
 I'll surely make introductions for them . 
 Is that right ? 
 I'm sleepy . I can hardly keep my eyes open . 
 I think I will . 
 May I see your ticket , please ? 
 You can get a boarding pass at that counter . Do you have anything to check in ? 
 Then you could wait in the departure area after going through security . 
 Yeah , I think so . It is very simple . 
 Do you have your own circle of friends ? 
 What you said was right , but we need to work as a team , how could you make adjustment to that ? 
 OK , I got it . 
 What kind of scarf shall I show you ? We have them in all sorts and sizes . 
 At your service . Will this suit you ? 
 This is Chinese made . 
 Yes , it ’ s already fifty yuan off the original price . 
 Sorry , we can ’ t come down any more . 
 Not a problem . May I have your name , please ? 
 Hi , sir . My name is Michelle . Could you tell me when you need the room ? 
 Perhaps you didn't know that we have new room rates . Do you find that acceptable , sir ? 
 The price per night is $ 308 . 
 Fantastic ! Would you like a smoking or nonsmoking room ? 
 That'll be nonsmoking . Now , do you approve of a single queen-size bed ? 
 I'm happy to hear that , sir . Your reservation is all set except for your phone number . 
 626-555-1739 . Thank you for doing business with us , Mr . Sandals . 
 I'm sorry . I won't do it again . 
 Is this the sign ? What does it says ? 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 What about this one ? It's the latest . 
 I am sorry , it's out of stock right now . 
 Take it easy , Jim . Your mother didn't mean it ! Need any help ? 
 Oh , they all went out ! Did you make a wish ? 
 Better luck this time ! 
 Which one ? 
 She is Miao Li . She's come here to see her brother . 
 OK . She's a costume designer and works in a garment mill . 
 She looks very beautiful . She is a nice girl . 
 No , she hasn't . 
 You're going to Shanghai tomorrow , are you ? 
 It might be . You'd better take a heavy sweater with you.The nights are usually quite cold at this time of year . 
 Not for now , I think , But I believe there'll be rain , so take your raincoat with you . 
 Helen , why do you keep flushing the toilet ? What's wrong ? 
 You did what ? Helen , I know it's gross , but I ' Ve seen many public washrooms that are much worse . Why are you cleaning the counter top ? are you out of your mind ? 
 Helen , this is not like your own bathroom . Just leave it to the cleaners , okay ? 
 You're such a neat freak ! I'm outta here ! 
 No , it's the Japanese team . 
 Well , their team work is well worth learning . 
 My mom phoned me this morning , and asked me to go back home to have housework chores . 
 God knows . Speaking of chores , I would rather do some washing than cooking . 
 I really hope that I could sleep like a log all through two nights . But ... Some one said that weekends are a bit like rainbows ; they look good from a distance but disappear before we get up close to them . 
 Do you have any habits such as smoking ? 
 What kind of winter sport do you like best ? 
 What do you like doing in your spare time ? 
 Do you have any hobbies ? 
 Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 We carry products from three large manufacturers and some imported ones , too . Do you have a specific model in mind ? 
 This one from Sony gives a very sharp picture . 
 Which brand do you prefer ? 
 OK . Come with me , please . 
 Just tell him off . 
 Yes , isn't it . 
 It's beautiful 75 degrees . 
 Not a good plan . The TV weather forecast says the hurricane is coming this weekend , and the temperature will also drop to 66 degrees . 
 I never make any definite weekend plan until Friday morning . Then after listening to the weather temperature , I make my plans . 
 You ’ re all set to leave . 
 What are your plans ? 
 What will your major be ? 
 You don ’ t have plans to end up back here , do you ? 
 You don ’ t belong here . 
 Good luck with your life . 
 Hi , Kerry . Did your husband make cooking for you ? 
 Really ? Was it delicious ? 
 It was the first time . You should not be so particular . 
 It ’ s true . Nowadays , men are spending more and more time in the kitchen . 
 Excuse me . Could you tell me where the post office is ? 
 Thank you so much for your assistance ! 
 I think it is easier to buy a car than to maintain it . What ’ s worse , I just don ’ t trust those vehicle maintenance shops . Sometimes , they overcharge or don ’ t build those parts I have been paying for . Last week , they even tried to persuade me to buy new parts which really need not to be changed . You know , my car is just half a year old and also good brand . I was just wondering about all these . 
 Is it possible to make a compliant call to some organization what it ’ s someone gets rip-off . 
 Why aren ’ t they are aware of the gravity of the situation ? 
 Can you help me set up my voicemail message ? I just got this service and I am not really sure what I am supposed to say . 
 Ok , so can I say , " This is Abby's voicemail . I will call you later , so leave me your name and number " . 
 Ok , so how about this , " This is Abby and I am really happy you called ! I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can , so please leave me your name and number . Talk to you soon ! " . 
 That's perfect ! Can you say that again and record it for me ? 
 You know I don't know anything about fashion . 
 Well , they are both all right . 
 Oh , no . I mean you look very nice in both of them . 
 But after all , it is your decision , not mine . 
 I'm going to Ireland this summer . 
 No , I'd like to go alone . 
 Jane , pleases come with us . 
 Just for fun , not for showing . What do you worry about ? 
 But ... OK . 
 I am afraid not . I have no interest in them at all . 
 Can I have a look at your ticket ? 
 I am sorry.sir.Your plane has just taken off . 
 I am so sorry to hear that . Maybe you should go to the information counter over there . They can give you some advice . 
 Do you have to work late at the computer company again tonight ? 
 How much longer will Mr . Schmidt be up in the mountains ? 
 Ahem ... uh , sir , I beg your pardon ... Uh , mister , are you waiting to buy a ticket for the movie ? 
 Well , yes , it is , but ... 
 You just cut into line , in front of me and everyone else , that's what ! Go take your place back at the end of the line , like every - one else ! 
 Just what gives you the right ... ? 
 Well , you're no gentleman , either . 
 Whew ! I got the last one . This must be my lucky day ! 
 Yes , I'm afraid I bought the last ticket , and to think , if you hadn't been such a gentleman . . . 
 Gentleman ! Hah ! Fat chance ! Hah ! Eat your heart out , sucker ! Hah ! 
 Yes , here is the table , which plans do you like best ? 
 $ 300 . 
 Here you are . 
 I'm not sure . I guess I'll just stay at home . Maybe I'll catch up on my reading . What about you ? Any plans ? 
 Sounds great ! 
 Do you mean it ? I'd love to ! 
 Before I answer that , I want to make sure that you know what I was looking for . Are you clear on what I was looking for ? 
 I inspect the home for problems that might not be all that apparent in a quick walk-through . 
 The owners might not be aware of everything wrong with the house . Some things are hidden , but might still be a problem for you in the future . 
 I inform you of the problems . If there are major problems , you can decline to buy the house or they may wish to fix any problems . 
 I found some fairly major problems . A major support beam in the roof is broken , and the shower floor leaked and rotted out the second-floor joist . 
 Yes , thank you so much . 
 Yes , my table is for 7 and it's near the window . 
 Excuse me , can you tell me the way to the Forbidden City , please ? 
 Thanks . 
 How do you like the play ? 
 You're absolutely right . I think the acting could be better . 
 Maybe you're right . But I really don't like it . 
 Yes , they had constant changes of scene , and I love variety . 
 Good afternoon , what can I do for you ? 
 How much do you want to draw ? 
 OK ! Do you take your bank card or bankbook with you ? 
 OK . Please fill out this form first . 
 Sure . How do you want it ? 
 All right . Here are the traveler's checks and money . 
 Not at all . 
 No , you don ’ t have to . But I think you ought to . 
 I hear that you've got a chance to go to Europe for a half-year training program . Is it true ? 
 Congratulations ! How can you get such a good opportunity to be trained overseas ? 
 How nice ! But will you have to pay for the training ? 
 I ’ ll show you around and explain the operation as we go along . 
 That is our office block . We have all the administrative depart - ments there . Down there is the research and development section . 
 About 3-4 % of the gross sales . 
 That ’ s the warehouse . We keep a stock of the faster moving items so that urgent orders can be met quickly from stock . 
 It would largely depend on the size of the order and the items you want . 
 Yeah , Judy . I will be working for the Post Office . It ’ s not a bad job . 
 That ’ s right . I report to work at 5am everyday , and I only get 45 minutes for lunch . 
 Well , the government offers its employees excellent health insurance benefits . 
 Yeah , that ’ s the best part . All of my children can get free medical care . 
 Now you know why I wanted to work for the Post Office ! 
 Do you ? 
 They look all right to me . 
 All right . All right . 
 I like girls who like to have fun , and aren't too serious . 
 That's true . Having a very serious boyfriend or girlfriend can be boring . 
 Don't mention it . 
 See you . 
 Oh , dear ! 
 It's not what I asked for . 
 It's not the right material . Or the right color . I can't possibly accept it . 
 For the 100th anniversary of the opening of the library we are going to have a party . 
 I hoped you would be willing to brainstorm with me for party ideas . 
 Perfect . It will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people . 
 Yes . And we checked with the city and we have permission to use the park adjacent to the library . 
 I'd like to have the film developed . 
 Yes . When can I get it back ? I can't wait to see the photos . 
 Fine , I'd like two enlargements from this negative . 
 Would you like to take a look at the menu , sir ? 
 Would you care for a drink before you order ? 
 Yes , sir . I'll bring it over . Have you decided what you'd like , sir ? 
 How about your interview ? 
 Why ? You are so excellent . 
 What a shame ! You should have showed yourself to them ! 
 I suggest you hunt for a job on the Internet . 
 It's very convenient and it has become popular recently . 
 Of course , if you log on some standard websites . 
 Hello . I want to reconfirm our flight to London . 
 Yes , I did . But I couldn't communicate with them in English.They speak only Spanish.So I need your help . 
 We are taking IB 385 to London tomorrow at 1 p . m . 
 I would like to exchange this dress . 
 Is there anything on sale today ? 
 Are dresses going to be on sale ? 
 That's great . I'll wait . See you next weekend . 
 I'm looking forward to summer vacation . 
 Hi ! Fiona ? I almost didn't recognize you . You are much thinner since I last saw you . 
 How did you do it ? 
 What's the secret then ? 
 Well . It's hard for me . I can't keep doing exercise . 
 Julia , Julia , Julia . My daring Julia , what's wrong with you ? 
 Yes , I have called you three times . What makes you in a daze ? 
 Did someone get hurt ? 
 What a terrible accident ! Who should be responsible for this traffic accident ? 
 Why do some guys like to drive so fast when they are drunk ? 
 Were you born in the U . S . , Melissa ? 
 How old were you ? 
 So , did you go to college right away ? 
 Wow , your English is really fluent now . 
 Yeah , but I was born here ! ! 
 There ’ s so much I want to do . I ’ Ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . I just ran a search for music to download . 
 Thanks . That would be very helpful . I ’ Ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . There ’ s too much information on the net . 
 Yes , I did . There ’ s an anti-virus program with my email account that scans all attachments , so I ’ m sure I haven ’ t sent anything nasty to anyone . 
 That ’ s good advice . I should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself , such as my password and credit car number . 
 How do I do that ? 
 That ’ s useful to know . Thanks . I ’ ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee . 
 Ha ha , right . Sounds to me like you ’ re more excited about the dumplings than seeing your Grandma . 
 Son , firecrackers aren ’ t toys.they ’ re dangerous ! 
 Whoa , don ’ t you remember ? Last year when I set off the firecrackers , you covered both your ears and hid behind your mother ? 
 Ahahah ... really ? 
 Hey , I offered last year ... 
 What may I do for you ? 
 You will need to apply for one . 
 You can do it right now , if you ’ d like . 
 Please fill out this application . 
 I just need to take your picture . 
 You will get it in a few weeks . 
 Welcome . How can we be of service today ? 
 Well , happy birthday . If it was sent yesterday using the usual service , it should be here already . You do have an account with us , right ? 
 Please . Just to double check all the details . 
 Hello , miss . Check out please . 
 Sure , here you are . 
 Yes . I enjoy my stay here . 
 Here is the money . 
 Sure . You mean this one ? 
 It ′ s a state-of-the-art piece of equipment , sir . With a gigantic 16.1 USGA TFT screen , 2.8 Ghz mobile processor , generous 512 MB RAM , removable 80 GB hard drive , convenient CD-RW / DVD combo drive , stunning fast graphics board with 64 MB DDR DRAM , dual battery capability , integrated Fast Ethernet card , IEEE 1394 digital interface and eight USB ports , it has all the power of a desktop computer packed into an ultra-slim notebook ! 
 The regular price is $ 2980.00 , but until December the 31st it ′ s on sale for just $ 2,699 . 00 . 
 Sure . It's a popular e-card website . 
 Okay . Did you get the Yahoo ID ? 
 I mean , you must register first before you send a card . 
 Ok . Choose the card which you like best , and fill in the following blanks with both your and your friend's names and e-mail addresses . 
 Don't forget to send . 
 We've settled price , order , payment , now I am calling to ask about package . How can we pack the goods ? 
 Do you mean that we are responsible for putting them together ? 
 I see . Why not use wooden cases ? 
 Oh , I know . Does it mean that shipment will have to be delayed if I insist on using wooden cases ? 
 Then you may use cardboard boxes for outer packing so long as you can guarantee the safety of the computers . 
 Sounds good . 
 No , it's not . 
 Don't mistake her as somebody . She ' s my older sister . 
 Hi , where have you been ? 
 Oh , how was it ? 
 Good morning , sir . Welcome to Flower Hotel . 
 How many pieces of baggage do you have ? 
 Surely , of course . 
 That's good to hear . You've had an ideal recovery from your operation . We're going to send you home tomorrow . 
 Don't be in such a hurry . I'm confident that you'll be completely recovered in 4 to 6 weeks . 
 You'd better have a good rest for a week . Be sure to have regular meals . Stay away from alcohol . Give up smoking at least a little while . 
 Yes . I'm going to give you some . Take one tablet of this medicine three times a day before meals . For that one , two tablets . And remember to come to the outpatient department for a consultation in two weeks , please . 
 You're welcome . We wish you a speedy recovery . Goodbye . 
 It's OK . I can always get a clear picture on it . 
 You'd better have it fixed . 
 That's not fair ! 
 I'm glad to hear that . 
 I think the plans look good . There's just one thing though , I'm a bit concerned about the main lorry entrance . What's the height clearance ? 
 Are you sure that's high enough ? 
 May I see you around 10 o'clock tomorrow morning , please ? 
 Don't worry . I'll be there right on time . 
 Is your waist any better ? 
 I ’ m glad you are getting better . 
 Then when will you be back again ? 
 I hope to see you at that time again . Bye . 
 Here's a model of our latest design . What do you think of it ? 
 What's wrong with it ? 
 Oh , dear ! 
 I don't know why I cannot take a step forward . 
 Many things are troubling me . I don't know whether I should come and go . 
 Harry , do you like the opera ? 
 Why is that ? It is called real art . 
 Yeah , that makes sense . 
 No , not yet . I'd like to buy a teapot . 
 That colored one is very beautiful . It may suit my furniture . How much do you ask for it ? 
 Show it to me , Please . Can you get me another ? It's scratched a little bit here . 
 I do like it . Can you come down a bit ? 
 That's still too much . Can you lower the price further ? 
 If so , I'd better try another store . 
 Yes , do you have a wine list ? 
 Bring us a bottle of Remy Martini and red wine . 
 That's good to know . We'll watch for crazy drivers . 
 Football ? Sounds dangerous . Maybe I'll just be a cheerleader . 
 Uh , yeah . And I've seen guys in pads tackled . We have no pads . I don't want to be tackled . 
 OK , but they better tag lightly ! 
 I ’ m in pretty bad shape . I am having an allergy all the time . 
 I never trust those stupid doctors . 
 Yes , but I only have few experiences . I guided a few groups of foreign tourists from America last winter vacation . I showed them around some places of interest . 
 Too many . I will just give you one example , Huangguoshu Falls , the largest waler-fall in China . 
 Good morning . I'd like to pay my bill . 
 In cash . How much is the total charge ? 
 Here you are . Thanks for your wonderful service . 
 Good Morning Ann . 
 How about a cup of coffee ? 
 And can you tell me what meetings I have this week ? 
 Okay , this afternoon you have a meeting with your accountant at 5 pm . 
 Okay , what time is my meeting in London ? 
 Who is Ms Von ? 
 I think I may rent this apartment from you . 
 Can you tell me how much I would have to pay for rent ? 
 That ’ s way too much . 
 I can afford about $ 800 a month for rent . 
 How much more are you thinking ? 
 That ’ s almost perfect . 
 Mom ! 
 I'm playing with my new jump rope ! Watch this ! 
 But I feel better . 
 OK . I get it . I'm getting back into bed ... 
 Yes , please . That is very kind of you . 
 No , thanks . I ’ Ve had plenty . 
 an mp4 player ? why don't you buy a new cell phone ? You can find an mp4 player inside any of the latest cell phones . 
 look at my cell phone . I can listen to music , watch movies , take pictures , play games , surf the web and download documents . It's just like a PAD . 
 that's Ok . you know , digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry , and they won't cost you too much . 
 that's right . what's the flash memory of your old mp3 ? 
 then any cell phone can meet your need because they generally have memories of over 512MB . 
 You are just a little bit chubby , not paunchy . 
 More physical exercise may help to keep your weight down . 
 There have been too many unplanned shutdowns over the past few months . We'll have to make a few changes to the way we operate . We need to reduce our downtime . 
 We need to establish routine maintenance procedures . It costs us too much in lost production if we wait until something breaks down before we fix it . 
 I did , but he gives me a runaround . 
 But he was trying to beat about the bush . And my talk with him was fruitless . 
 well , the costumes and the set are marvellous , but the acting is a bit stiff . What do you think ? 
 do you know anyone in the play ? 
 really ? Is that why you wanted to come to the play ? 
 so you've seen other plays that he's directed ? 
 sure , I'd love to meet the cast ! Have you ever been in a play ? 
 what did you do ? 
 I once helped out with costumes , but I didn't enjoy it very much . 
 I spent over three weeks sewing sequins on a coat . 
 Come on in . I am so glad you are here . We have been expecting you . 
 No , you are just on time . We haven ’ t really started yet . 
 Thank you , they ’ re beautiful . You can hang your coat over there . Try this new couch , it is so comfortable . You will love it . Want something to drink , tea , coffee , juice or Cola ? 
 Make yourself at home . 
 Well , I don ’ t mean to boast but all the designs are done by myself and some colleagues are already trying to copy some of them for their new apartments . Look , they are making photos now of my designed kitchen . 
 Probably nothing . 
 Romantic ? I can ’ t remember what that word means . 
 Ha , ha ! Those days are long gone . 
 Yes , ma ’ am . I could come in any day next week , except for Friday morning . 
 Yes . That would be fine . 
 On that day , boys are supposed to give roses to their sweethearts . 
 They give chocolate in return . 
 No , I haven't . Is the food good there ? 
 I usually shop at Sons . 
 What's the problem with Sons ? 
 Is there a big selection of organic foods at Whole Foods ? 
 I haven't been shopping there , but maybe I'll try it sometime . 
 I'll take your word for it . 
 Pretty busy . I have to pick up a lot of credits this year . 
 I ’ m majoring in French literature . 
 That's right . We got the assignment last week . 
 Next Monday . 
 Miss Sun , could you please type this report for me ? 
 Could you please double space it so I can make corrections ? 
 No . This afternoon will be fine . 
 I think you ’ ll lay it to rest with the time flying . 
 But I think time can change everything . 
 Nanometer is a length scale . It's one billionth of a meter , roughly ten times the size of an individual atom . 
 Well , let's make it this way . For comparison , 10 NM is 1000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair . There are as many nanometers in an inch as there are inches in 400 miles . 
 do you want to go out for dinner tonight ? 
 I'm starving , so maybe we could go somewhere with large portions . 
 I'm not really in the mood for Italian , actually . I was thinking of something a bit spicy . 
 I really like that restaurant ; you get a lot for your money there . But , they've westernized their food , so it's not actually that spicy . 
 the Taj ? They're a bit expensive , but they do serve large portions of very hot food . 
 shall we bring our own bottle of wine to save some money ? 
 that's right . It'll probably work out to be about the same then anyway . 
 are you sure ? We could go Dutch . 
 I won't argue with that ! Let's go ! 
 To cancel your reservation , I need your name , phone number , and date of trip , please . 
 I see your reservation on my computer . Let me just cancel it , and you'll be all set ! 
 You're welcome . 
 I have a problem . 
 I wrote a check for $ 100 and it bounced . 
 I think so . 
 Okay . Thank you . 
 You can ’ t be serious ! 
 I see . Thanks for your help . 
 Yes , of course . When you hear the fire alarm , which is a very loud , continuous ringing noise , you should go to the nearest fire exit or fire escape as quickly as possible . 
 Yes , don't use the lifts . We have regular fire drills so you'll soon become familiar with the procedure . And always shut the fire doors to prevent the fire spreading . 
 I swear I never drink again . Just give me another chance , please . 
 You know how hard I try to quit , I've lost without you . I am mot let you go . 
 I have to make money to support the family , so I have little time left to share with you . 
 I told you I happened to be more important meeting at that time . 
 Oh , sir . I lost my passport . 
 I remember I saw when I was dining in the Aidan Restaurant . When I paid the bill , I saw it in my handbag . 
 3448-2691- 6429-34 . 
 Five months later . 
 Hi , this is Tom Port . May I speak to Mr . Smith ? 
 No . Thanks . Can I leave a message for Mr . Smith ? 
 Welcome to IBA . What can we assist you with today ? 
 This scheme has just started and you will be one of our first 100 customers , so if your application is accepted , you will receive some rather nice perks . 
 That should make things perfectly simple , then . Actually , if you had waited a little while longer , we would have notified you by post . 
 May I have your details , and I'll check for you . 
 OK , so you are already a gold card holder , with a sound credit history . That means we can automatically upgrade you to our new platinum card . 
 Excuse me . I get confused that the two phones on the booth are different , can you tell me how to use them ? 
 Well , I see . How to use the other one ? 
 It seems quite easy . I will try both of them . 
 I need a packet of cigarettes please . 
 Thanks . 
 OK . 
 How about yourself ? 
 Daniel , I am not tall enough to reach the of the blackboard . 
 OK , I've finished cleaning the blackboard . 
 Oh , I forgot about it . I'll get it . 
 I will be done before they come . 
 That is just wishful thinking . The cost of higher education has increased in recent years , faster than the cost of living . So she wants Jane's brother to go on studying and earn his doctorate by means of it . 
 Good afternoon , San Felice Hotel . May I help you ? 
 Certainly . When for , madam ? 
 How long will you be staying ? 
 What kind of room would you like , madam ? 
 Certainly , madam . I'll just check what we have available . . . Yes , we have a room on the 4th floor with a really splendid view . 
 Would you like breakfast ? 
 It's eighty four euro per night excluding VAT . 
 Who's the booking for , please , madam ? 
 Okay , let me make sure I got that 
 Let me give you your confirmation number . It's 7576385 . I'll repeat that , 7576385 . Thank you for choosing San Felice Hotel and have a nice day . Goodbye . 
 Our unit is participating in a fundraiser this weekend and would like to borrow the van , if possible . 
 It will be at the beach by the pier . 
 We will only be needing it for Sunday . 
 The only two drivers will be Mary and I . 
 Sure . We also would like to use the chairs from the lunchroom . Would that be OK ? 
 The telephone is ringing . Can you answer it , Sue ? 
 Thanks , Sue . 
 As you know , china has a single-child policy . Therefore , there ’ s just my husband , my daughter and I . What about in your family ? 
 Not anymore . They live with my brother now . and yours ? 
 No , I have two older brothers and one younger sister . What about you ? 
 How long have you been married ? 
 I ‘ Ve been married for about five years . What do you think about divorce ? 
 If my husband cheated on me or treated me badly , I would get a divorce . 
 ( ha ha ) I ’ ll keep that in mind , but don ’ t tell my husband . 
 Hello , Mary . What ’ s the matter with you ? You look upset . 
 Oh , I ’ m sorry to hear that . I know how you feel . Please don ’ t be sad . 
 OK . Don ’ t let it get to you . Goodbye . 
 Well , sir . May I have your room number ? 
 Please fill out the form first . 
 Of course . 
 Sorry to hear that . Can we do anything about it ? 
 Then I have to call another taxi , or I'll be late . 
 I will not miss the boat when there is another opportunity again next time . 
 Yes , you are supposed to meet the president at ten fifteen this morning . Then , you have a lunch appointment with Mr . Clark . And this afternoon at three you are scheduled to speak before a group of seminar participants . 
 Certainly . 
 Certainly . What time would you like us to call you ? 
 Not a problem . We'll call you tomorrow morning at 7 , and again at 7 fifteen . 
 Said , and done . Will there be anything else ? 
 Well , give us a call if there's anything more we can help you with . 
 Good , thanks . How about you ? 
 In No . 4 Dorm . I like dorm life . You will meet a lot of people and you don't have to cook . What about you ? 
 I hope you will find a place . Listen , I'd better go . I am going to be late for class . 
 Take care . 
 Yes . I have been here for three years . 
 Well . I ’ m rather disappointed with it . 
 It ’ s too old . And it isn ’ t as specious as I expected . 
 I ’ ll just have to put up with it . 
 How often do you service the vans ? 
 I see . What does the service involve ? 
 Can you carry out major repairs here ? 
 Doctor Lin's Office . 
 How about 2 o'clock this afternoon ? 
 Judy , what is everybody talking about ? 
 You ’ re kidding . It can ’ t be true . 
 Really ? I ’ m surprised . 
 Excuse me , do you serve breakfast here ? 
 An American one , please . I am in a hurry . 
 Are you doing something on Saturday evening ? If not , welcome to my new apartment . 
 Yes , I have been busy emptying the packing boxes and cleaning up the mats . Right now , it looks like a home . I would like to have a small celebration party . Please do come . 
 It is in the DX community , Room 306 , No . 2 building . It is very easy to find . Just ask the guard at the entrance . 
 I invited all the colleagues in our department and also my former neighbor , Paul . He is a very good person . You should meet him . 
 Yes , great . I am happy you are coming . 
 I have been washing clothes here since a few years ago . 
 It doesn't cost me as much to wash here . 
 Why are you washing your clothes here now ? 
 You should just pay someone to fix it . 
 So you're just going to wash here ? 
 It costs less to wash here . 
 I am , sir . 
 It's me , sir . But I am sorry I have forgotten to prepare for it . 
 Good morning , can I see your passport , please ? 
 For business or pleasure ? 
 Thank you . Have a pleasant stay . 
 All right , if that would make you happy . 
 Well , nothing really serious . 
 Yes . This is Vanessa . 
 Yes . Is the position available now ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 I ’ ll see you then . Good bye . 
 Speaking . May I ask whom I am talking to ? 
 Oh , yes . I remember your company . 
 I'd like to , but I'm afraid that my schedule is full this week . 
 Am . How about 10 a . m . on next Friday ? 
 All right , expecting you . 
 Not at all . 
 You ’ re welcome . I prefer a window seat . 
 how can I help you ? 
 do you know what kind of scent she usually wears ? 
 ok , here are some of our most popular perfumes . 
 personally , I quite like the new perfume by Clinique . It's a subtle flowery scent . What do you think ? 
 would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers . 
 how about some lipstick ? Every woman needs a nice tube of red lipstick . 
 how about some mascara ? That will make her eyes look bigger . 
 I know what she would like---some whitening cream . 
 will that be all then ? 
 He told the police that Ted was the murderer . 
 Why do you say so ? 
 Let's see . I had the salmon starter which was £ 5.90 and my Pizza was £ 8.25 . 
 So that's £ 14.15 for me and £ 16.50 for you . 
 Yes , so that's an extra £ 6 for both of us . 
 And I had a dessert - that's another £ 3.50 . And you had coffee which is £ 2 . 
 Yes , this is everything on the list . 
 Yes , that's exactly it . How much tip shall we give the waiter ? 
 Are you free on Friday evening because we were wondering if you would like to come round for dinner ? 
 That ’ s a pity ! Then when would it be a good time for you ? 
 Okay , that ’ s fine . 
 This is he . What can I do for you ? 
 It's still available . Do you want to see it ? 
 Does today at 6 p . m . sound okay to you ? 
 Okay , I'll see you at 6 o'clock . Do you need any directions ? 
 I'll have an application form with me . You can fill it out if you're interested . 
 No . I only need to check your driver's license . 
 Better take the subway . It's faster , and more convenient . 
 We have a rather comprehensive subway system here . You can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway , especially at this time of day when the traffic is heavy . 
 Just give the man standing there 3 yuan and he'll give you a token . Then , you slip it into the slot at the turnstile and push the turnstile to get in . 
 Ask the worker who sells tokens to give you one . It's free fo charge . Actually maps showing subway routes are posted at most stations . 
 No , you don't have to . Here comes the train . 
 Sure , which one ? The red one or the blue one ? 
 You may keep it for the time being . I'm not using it now . 
 I'm afraid there's nothing available before noon . 
 Sorry , but he's busy then too . 
 They want to be filthy with dough and think it the only source of their happiness . 
 Richard , why didn't you come to school today ? 
 Well , take care of yourself . 
 Sorry . We're out of size L's . 
 Why don't you try this other T-shirt ? I think it would look nice on you . 
 Yes , we do . 
 It's on your right hand side at the end of this hallway . 
 Look , Bob hasn't made any progress on that project . 
 We should have a word with him . 
 As an existing banker , that will speed up the process . You said you had the documents with you ? 
 Before I verify those , I need you to fill in some forms . Then , as I said , I need to see valid credentials , your occupation and income details ... 
 You are authorized to borrow up to 20,000 RIB , with a repayment period of up to 1 year . 
 We can also look at your current credit status and adjust the interest accordingly . 
 If you sort out all of the paperwork today , you could have your loan by the end of the week . 
 All right , Mr . Crane , when will you be arriving in the city ? 
 Only 25 minutes or so . We ’ ll send somebody to meet you . That ’ s 11:30 a . m . Friday the 15th ? 
 What ’ s your favourite ball sport ? 
 Who ’ s your favourite player ? 
 Do they have a good team ? 
 I can ’ t keep up with the game . The players play so quickly that I can hardly see what they are doing . 
 You play for an amateur team , don ’ t you ? 
 How many more games are there this season ? 
 Mike's going to have a self-driving traveling across the country . 
 You don't want to join him ? 
 Yes , and I want to have a try . 
 Don ’ t tell me ! I ’ m sure it ’ s someplace warm and sunny with great beaches ! 
 You are so lucky ! Send me a postcard ! 
 I'll do my utmost if I am hired . 
 No , that thought doesn't cross my mind . 
 Oh , I have to check . Do you need anything else ? 
 That will be fourteen dollars in all . 
 Good idea . Where shall we go ? 
 Don't you think it is too far ? 
 What about going to Beijing ? 
 OK ! 
 I'm feeling a bit airsick . 
 Thank you . oh , can you get me some orange juice as well ? 
 Hi ! Bob , are you having problems with that ? 
 It's easy , let me help you . 
 Time flies ! 
 Hello , Jim . Where are you going ? 
 No , thanks . I'm going home . My wife's expecting me . 
 Do you go to the cinema a lot ? 
 Do you know what's on tonight by any chance ? 
 Oh , I see . By the way , where are you going for your holidays this year ? 
 Oh , does she ? That's convenient . 
 Don't you like the sea ? 
 I'm going to stay at home . 
 No , I want to buy a car , and that's going to take every penny I've got . 
 That ’ s very kind of you , but it ’ s nothing special . 
 Well , actually it ’ s just about luck . 
 He's a member of the National Basketball Association . 
 Some people say he's from New York . 
 Only four days . 
 I know . I can't help thinking about her . She's always on my mind . 
 Yeah , let's go Joe's Disco . 
 Okay , but you ask him . 
 No , I don't think so . 
 Thanks . 
 Don't forger to come straight home after school . 
 Have you got everything ? 
 Hello , Lily . 
 When I come late , there ’ s usually nothing left . 
 I ’ ll have the leg of lamb . 
 How long have we been flying ? 
 I always have trouble with jet lag . 
 By the way , what's the time now ? 
 What do you think of smoking ? 
 What in your opinion can be done to stop smoking ? 
 But that ’ ll affect the national economy . 
 How about painting a warning on each cigarette packet ? 
 I'll come see you tomorrow . 
 How are you doing today ? 
 I'm absolutely lovely , thank you . 
 I haven't been better . How about yourself ? 
 Where are you going to school ? 
 How do you like it so far ? 
 I wish you luck . 
 Personal Loans , how may I help ?

 Not exactly . Our policy states that the loange could be the person studying abroad , for example , you , or your direct relative or spouse .

 Have you ever noticed that serious pollution in modern cities goes from bad to worse ? 
 I think it ’ s time for the government to take strong action . And people should try to protect environment . 
 I need some more amenities , please . 
 Specifically , I'm talking about the little things , like soap and shampoo . 
 No , I'm not even halfway through my supply . 
 What's the use of going to a hotel if you don't take home souvenirs ? 
 There you go . My friends expect me to bring home souvenirs . 
 I've never paid for a hotel souvenir in my life , and I don't intend to start now . 
 I was wondering if this is where the Resume Writing Workshop is being held . 
 It ’ s been a long time since I ’ Ve had to look for work and put a resume together . 
 Where do we begin ? 
 Then what do we do ? 
 What about listing my interests and affiliations next ? 
 How do you think TaiWan's economy is doing ? 
 Do you know why that is ? 
 What's a good place for sightseeing ? 
 ... And now , let ’ s go to Kenny Williams for today ’ s weather forecast . 
 What ’ s the weather looking like today , Kenny ? 
 It ’ s a chilly day folks , so don ’ t forget your coats ! What about tomorrow Kenny ? Do you have good news for us ?

 What ’ s the main idea in this essay ? 
 Caroline Menzies speaking . 
 I'm afraid she's in a meeting at the moment . Who's speaking ? 
 Can I take a message , Mr Laing ? 
 Certainly . Does she have your number ? 
 01705 ... 
 455623 . 
 OK . I'll make sure she gets the message . 
 Have you attended school today ? 
 I wasn't able to attend school because I was feeling ill . 
 I would really appreciate that , thanks . 
 If you get sick , I'll return the favor . 
 I'm broke , and I have to catch another bus . 
 I got hungry and bought some chips . 
 Anyway , do you have any change I can use for the bus ? 
 I don't know how I'm going to get home . 
 How much is a transfer ? 
 That's great ! Thanks for your help . 
 I just called Mr . Smith in Room 201 , but there was no reply . Would you find out if he's still staying there ? 
 Oh , he did ? May I have his forwarding address , please ? 
 Oh , what a pleasant surprise ! Don't you remember me ? 
 Right ! Glad to see you here . 
 How many kinds of secretaries work here ? 
 What sort of duties do you expect ? 
 Can I help you ? 
 Sure . Any particular model ? 
 Oh , I'm afraid we've sold out of those . They were really popular . 
 Yes . But not for about 2 weeks . 
 With pleasure . 
 No problem . 
 I wasn't kidding before , OK , I'm fine now . 
 Yes . 
 What are you saying ? You are acting weird today . 
 Haha , very funny , but it doesn't make any sense to me . 
 Seriously , if we will adopt any animals , we'd gotta to talk to Daniel . 
 Hope so . 
 It's on the Fifth Avenue . 
 I see.You ' re a stranger here.Walk two blocks ahead , then turn left . You can't miss it . 
 Yes , it does . 
 I think it leaves at two thirty . 
 There is a Matisse exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art . Larry and I will go . 
 No . Do we need tickets ? 
 Outside or inside ? 
 Hmm . It's very cold today.But I brought my jacket . Maybe it will be alright to wait . 
 MYOMA ? What's that ? 
 I see . Do you have any suggestions for other things we should do ? 
 How can we get up there ? 
 But Larry says the neighborhoods in the north are dangerous . 
 to be honest , I'm really fed up with work at the moment . I need a break ! 
 I have to work on Saturday all day ! I really hate my job ! 
 yes , that's my only day off until Thursday . 
 that'd be fantastic ! Which beach are you going to ? 
 what should I bring with me ? 
 I can just use my beach towel . I love lazing around in the sun . 
 I've actually never tired . Do you have a surfboard ? 
 I can't wait ! It sounds like we're going to have a great time . How much money should I bring ? 
 ok , where and when should I meet you ? 
 I am sorry to have kept all of you waiting . I was delayed by something urgent . 
 What did he say ? 
 He shouldn't drive his car . He should come here by bus . 
 I know she is quite an article , but I was not sure of her ability to cope with a boss . 
 But most bosses are fools for woman . 
 That is just an excuse.You can always find some time to exercise . 
 Bill , you know that work is not the same as exercise as it is stressful but not relaxing.And skipping meals will not help you lose weight.In fact your body will only store fat if you miss meals . 
 How about going for a walk instead of sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper after dinner every night ? 
 I know , I know.Have you got a portable radio ? You can listen to the news and get healthy at the same time . 
 Even if our company didn't have a dress code , I still think people would wear formal clothing to work . 
 Maybe that's true for some positions , but I think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree . They dress for success ! You can't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans . It's just not respectful to you client . 
 It's not as simple as that . People judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . So dressing professional is being professional . The image that you portray to others is so important in business . It's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale . 
 How much is the postage for this postcard to China ? 
 By airmail . 
 Here you are . 
 Oh , one more thing , I want to send the card by registered mail too . 
 Here it is . and thank you very much . 
 Would you like me to help you on your new project ? 
 I would enjoy helping with the writing portion . 
 That is OK sometimes . 
 No , I can't be there . 
 I can send that information to you . 
 Welcome to our bar ! 
 Here is the wine list . 
 What would you like ? 
 What about cocktail ? 
 I recommend Mao Tai , it's the best liquor in China . 
 Here you are , sir . 
 Happy birthday , Ann . Many happy returns of the day ! Here is a present for you . 
 Ok , who is that girl ? 
 Well , I don't know . 
 Who is afraid ? I am not afraid . 
 I want it the way Peckham wears it . 
 Are you kidding me ? Even the girls know Peckham . Whatever , I have a picture of him here . 
 Sure , he is a soccer star . 
 Oh , my God . It's disaster . It makes my head look like a soccer ball . 
 It looks like the hairstyle of Kahn who stands beside him in the picture . 
 He plays outside right but it doesn't mean he has to stand on the right . 
 Do it , please . 
 Good thing , we took a taxi . 
 Hey , look there . It is an advertisement of the piano training class on the billboard . The place is not far from our home . 
 Your sister is in high school now ; no one plays the piano at home . 
 Why ? Why not ! The piano is right there . 
 Anyway , I will have a look at the piano class after work by myself . 
 I just got sacked . 
 Do you want a taxi ? 
 Where to ? 
 Yes , I know it . 
 Yes , of course . Step in , please ! 
 Buckle up the belt , please . 
 Good morning . 
 What's the problem ? 
 How long have you had that problem ? 
 Then , you'd better go to the Medical Department . But first , you should fill in the registration card and the registration fee is one Yuan . 
 Take the lift to the third floor and then go along until you see the sign on your right . 
 You're welcome . 
 $ 19 a day or $ 129 a week , unlimited mileage . 
 Could I see your driver's license ? 
 Good . Now just complete this form . 
 I was sick . 
 I had a stomachache . 
 I'm still feeling under the weather . 
 I took something earlier . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 If you are really in love with your wife , you should be in support of her . You can ’ t have it both ways , of course . 
 Yeah . Love me , and love my dog . 
 I'm not really into racecar driving . 
 Yeah , well , times change . Look at you-you're a father now . You can't say that you haven't changed . 
 I mean , I know spring training's over , but I'm just not into all that . 
 May I help you ? 
 Well . Can you tell me how much you have deposited ? 
 Please let me have your name and your savings account number if you remember it . 
 Don't worry , Mr . Brown . Let me try to check it for you . One moment , please . Yes , I have your account number here . The balance is exactly RIB 12,000 
 It's my pleasure . Please fill out this lost passbook bill and list the code word you used when you first opened your account . 
 May I exchange this DVD player ? 
 Here you are . 
 It won't play a DVD . 
 At first , I thought it was me . 
 Would you care for something to drink , Mr . Stone ? 
 Just make yourself at home . The other guests should be arriving shortly . 
 I ’ m sorry , Jeff . Please don ’ t interrupt me right now . I ’ m in the middle of a conversation . 
 That ’ s all right . I ’ ll be finished in a little while . 
 Yes . I have three sons . Actually I also have a grandson . 
 I understand . I was in your position before . At that time I couldn ’ t depend on anyone taking care of the children for me . My husband seldom stayed at home . 
 Yes , she did a little . But you see , Americans are different from Chinese . You can ’ t depend on your own mother to be a full-time babysitter . She could baby-sit only once or twice a week . That ’ s it . I had to care for them most of the time . 
 Don ’ t worry . You can take night classes . I did that when I had kids . And soon your child will be old enough to attend kindergarten . Then you could find a job and work . 
 No . You see , I went back to school to get my Master ’ s Degree when I was in my thirties . You won ’ t be older than that . 
 What ’ s the matter ? What annoy you ? 
 Wow ! What ’ s the hold up ? 
 Really ? Then , I guess I won ’ t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ? 
 I ’ m not too worried about it . I always seem to find something . 
 No , we don't . 
 Six , including two kids . 
 Operator . 
 You can call direct if you like . 
 Yes , please . 
 Yes , the code for Australia is 61 and then dial the city code and the number . Start with the international code which is 00 . 
 Between six in the evening and eight in the morning , sir . 
 Certainly . Tell me the room number and your name , please ? 
 OK , Mr . Ma . I'll tell the front desk clerk the charge afterwards . 
 You're welcome . Bye . 
 How is the college search going ? 
 But don't you want to study music ? Shouldn't it be easy ? 
 I know . You have to decide if you want to attend a school in a city or in the country , a big school or a small school , a public or private school ... 
 I see . Well , don't forget to talk to the college counselor at the school . He usually gives good advice and can help point you in the right direction.He gave me some information , and next week I'm going to take a look at some of the colleges he recommended . 
 OK , that ’ s fine . Bye . 
 That ’ s it , my lease is up . I have to move . 
 The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot 
 I think I might move in with my parents for a couple of months until I can find something . You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here . I ’ m gonna have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while . 
 Actually , would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks ? 
 Henry , do you know how much we spent this month ? 
 we've spent $ 1,000 . 
 So , you finally got your doctorate in genetics . Well done ! 
 What are you thinking of doing ? 
 There must be several private companies that are interested in employing someone like you . You could do some research for a university . There ’ s a lot of discussion about genetics nowadays . Someone wit 
 Well , I hope scientists don ’ t decode to make a clone of me in the future ! I wouldn ’ t like to be the subject of an experiment . 
 What ’ s the problem ? 
 Is the pipe causing any water damage ? 
 I can come fix the pipe sometime tomorrow . 
 I don ’ t think that would be a good idea . 
 I guess you have a point . 
 Go right ahead . 
 My present pay is RIB 3 , 000 yuan each month . 
 What is important to me is the job and the people who I will be working with , so regarding salary , I leave it to you and I am sure that you will make me a fair offer . 
 Yes , it is quite satisfactory . I accept it . 
 To whom should I report ? 
 What are the benefits ? 
 I would like to know if there would be any opportunity to work abroad in the future ? 
 Thank you . Then I think it's time for us to sign a letter of intent . 
 May I help you ? 
 2.50 Yuan . 
 3.00 Yuan . 
 Here is your change , please . 
 Welcome to my shop next time . 
 What is it , Mrs . Wang ? 
 Is that so ? So far we haven't had any complaint of this kind . Our mushrooms have enjoyed a good reputation for their superior quality for years . We are really at a loss to understand why your lot was found moldy and wormeaten . Have you any evidence ? 
 Though everything may be as you say , there are many factors involved . What's more , your surveyors have not mentioned any cause for the damage . 
 As you know , before shipment , the Commodity InspectionBureau inspected the goods in question . They concluded that the goods were well dehydrated from fresh and choice material and up to standard for export . 
 The inspection certificate , which is based on a random selection of 20 % of the consignment as we've agreed on beforehand , is considered final and binding upon both parties . We do not accept any claims for compensation for loss incurred in transit , because you bought the goods F . O . B . Houston and on shipping quality , not on landed quality . Your claim , in our opinion , should be referred to the insurance company , as the mishap occurred after shipment . 
 That's a matter over which we could exercise no control , then . I'm afraid I have to insist that you approach the insurance company for settlement , that is , if you have covered this risk in your coverage . 
 Otherwise the insurance company would no doubt have entertained your case . 
 I think I've looked everywhere , but I haven't seen a swimming pool here . 
 Swim stations ? Whoever heard of such a thing ? 
 All that exercise in a little pool ! Do I have to pay anything ? 
 Very good . Now can you tell me the hours of operation ? 
 Wow ! I can't wait to change into my trunks ! 
 Hello , this is Steven from Blue Sky Co . May I speak to Mr . James ? 
 Excuse my troubling you . You purchased our products last year and now I am following up to find out about their workings . Are they still in good condition now ? 
 That's it ! All of them have first-class quality and performance . Besides , we adopt advanced technology . Now we have developed new products . They are much better than what you have bought . 
 That's great ! Thanks for your support . If any , please remember to call us . I am afraid I have to say goodbye now ! Bye , Mr . James ! 
 Excuse me , Professor . I am going to miss next week's class . 
 No , I have to do this ; it's important ! 
 I've made arrangements with a friend to help me . 
 Yes , I know . 
 OK , I can do that . 
 I have to get to Chicago by tomorrow and you're telling me that there are no flights ? 
 You mean like a bus ? Have you ever traveled for ten hours on a bus before ? 
 Alright , give me the number . But put me on that waiting list as well . 
 How many people are on the waiting list right now ? 
 How long do I have to wait ? 
 I see.The bus doesn't come so often as in cities . 
 How much will our order from your factory be ? 
 I'm afraid I can't wait that long . Can your office at least provide me with a ballpark figure ? 
 Just give me an estimated figure for an order of 100 units . 
 Your estimated is seems a little high to me , we're willing to pay $ 80 per unit . 
 Thank you for coming tonight , Mrs . Webber . As a teacher , it's great seeing the kid's parents assist our parent-teacher conference night . 
 Well Allen is a great student . He is a hard worker and very well behaved , however he does struggle a bit with math . 
 Well , it's important that you sit with him and review his homework assignments and help him with math . I would also recommend he stay after school twice a week for tutoring sessions . It will really help a lot . 
 Um ... yes . Here is a notice from our financial department , seems your child's Tumion is overdue . 
 Welcome to IBA . What can we do for you today ? 
 I see . That shouldn't be a problem , Sir . Which currency would you require ? 
 The first step is to fill in the Account Opening Application and the accompanying Seal Card , stamped with your company's seal . I mean , the business seal and the corporate seal . We also need your Business Licence and the Enterprise Standard Code Certificate . Then we can go on to the next step . 
 To start with , may I know why you are interested in working for our company ? 
 What was your chief responsibility in your past work ? 
 Good morning . My name is Penny White . I'm new here . 
 OK . 
 Yes , that's OK . I'm glad to get started . 
 OK . Thank you very much . 
 How many languages can you speak ? 
 You mean you can read and write both of them ? 
 Can you read and write English well ? 
 Do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of English-speaking countries ? 
 Do you think your English is good enough to do desk work ? 
 Would you care for a drink ? 
 Good evening , may I help you ? 
 I am sorry , there are so many travelers that all our tables have been booked on that day . 
 Thank you , sir . We will phone you as soon as we have a vacant table . 
 oh , don't mention it . It was terrible . 
 the food station was as crowded as usual . I waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich , and when I finally got it the chicken was underdone . 
 yes , I know . Fast food is so popular in this district . 
 anyway , how was your such , Catherine ? 
 you did ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America . 
 i guess you're right . More often than not , people go there only for convenience . The foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat . 
 you bet . Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America . 
 seriously ? 
 Good evening , sir . Are you ready to order now ? 
 Chinese food is divided into eight big cuisines , such as Cantonese food , Sichuan food , Fujisan food , etc . Our restaurant is famous for Sichuan style . 
 Yes . Cantonese food is lighter while Sichuan food is spicy and hot . 
 How about the eggplant and minced pork in dry red chili sauce and the ' Tofu ' beancurd ? They are our specialties . 
 Yes . Sour soup of Sichuan style . It's our chef ’ s recommendation . 
 Sir , your dish will take 5 minutes to prepare . While waiting , would you like anything to drink ? 
 OK , sir . We'll try our best to serve you as soon as possible . 
 I'd like to . But I'm not myself today . 
 It's the end of the world for me . 
 Today , I'm told I failed three courses . 
 I'm such a fool that duplication of effort is only a waste of time to me . 
 I hope so . 
 Let me get a hamburger . 
 No cheese . 
 Can I get a soda , please ? 
 I'd like a Sprite . 
 I'd like a bag of Doritos with that . 
 That'll be all . 
 No , but you can let them know that yours is the cream of the crop-the purest motor oil in the world . Careful , hold it by the java jacket . This coffee drink has half and half-what do you think ? 
 That's just the point ! Purity is the essence of good coffee , right ? 
 Yeah , get off the bus . 
 I'm really not sure . 
 I don't think this is right . 
 Yeah , we did get off too early . 
 I messed up . 
 You want to wait for the next bus ? 
 Mary told me that she had seen you with John last night . I got to know the fact that you are playing the field . 
 I really need to find a parking spot . 
 Do you know any spaces on campus ? 
 Where is it located ? 
 Do you have any idea if the parking structure has any spaces left ? 
 What time was it when you went up there ? 
 It wouldn't be full right now , would it ? 
 Can I help you ? 
 Sure . There is a folk concert tonight . 
 Sorry . There are only some seats in the back . 
 It begins at 7 p . m .. 
 How many tickets do you want ? 
 OK . Fifty yuan for each . 
 Will I get notification that I qualify for unemployment ? 
 What is contained in that letter ? 
 Will the Award Letter tell me what I need to fill out next ? 
 When I fill out the Continued Claim Form , what will I need to tell them ? 
 What other information does the form ask for ? 
 Hey , Mary , nice to see you again . I heard you're going back home to the U . S . 
 You're so thoughtful . Wish you a good trip home . And we'll miss you . 
 Overseas operator . 
 Your name , please . 
 What's the number , please . 
 The line is connected . Please go ahead . 
 You are not going to believe this . Do you remember the dress we saw at Mayors that was so beautiful and expensive ? I got it today at half price . 
 How can you stay so calm ? Aren't you going to take a look to see if there is anything for you ? 
 But there won't be anything good left . 
 We may go abroad . I ’ m not sure . My wife wants to go to Egypt . I ’ d like to go there , too . We can ’ t make up our minds . 
 We may travel by sea . 
 It may be cheaper , but it takes a long time . 
 Don ’ t be so sure . We may not go anywhere . My wife always worries too much . Who ’ s going to look after the dog ? Who ’ s going to look after the house ? Who ’ s going to look after the garden ? We have t 
 Thank you.You ' re partial . 
 It's nice to hear that anyway . 
 Why do you think the new page is so much better than the old page ? I thought the old page wasn't half bad ... 
 What changes were made from the old page to the new page ? 
 Great ! 
 Really ? But his wife has always waited on him hand and foot . 
 It's very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife . 
 Yes , millions of travelers come here every year for the view of the buildings . 
 We will visit the Statue of Liberty as scheduled . 
 I see . Well , it's nothing spectacular , but it's pretty cheap for an apartment in a decent neighborhood ... O . K . , I think I'll take it . 
 I think I'll sign a nine-month lease in case I decide not to go to summer school . I can extend it if I want to stay , can't I ? 
 Can I have the check please ? 
 Is this amount correct ? 
 Thank you , the service was good 
 Where shall I register , please ? 
 Yes . Here you are . 
 OK . How much do I need to pay for the registration ? 
 Here is my money . 
 Yes , I will . But can you tell me how to get to the consulting room ? 
 Where did you work as a teacher before ? 
 What teaching experience have you had ? 
 what a nice uniform ! 
 not really . I was being sarcastic . Does it come with the job ? 
 they're not actually that bad . They could be worse . What do you think about it ? 
 so are you enjoying your new job ? 
 how do you like working in sales ? 
 that's good . Have you met Jane yet ? She's the intern in the international travel department . 
 I know ! She could sell fridges to Eskimos ! 
 she's my cousin . 
 I don't know . I didn't think it was that interesting . 
 that's a good idea . Let's discuss after work . 
 What is that ? 
 What's special about Melbourne Zoo ? 
 Are the animals caged ? 
 That's really special . 
 What is your favorite pastime ? 
 Is it ? Mine is climbing mountains on Sunday mornings . 
 Excuse me , could you please take a picture for us ? 
 Over here with the waterfall in the background , please . 
 Then just press the black button all the way down . 
 It could be the battery . Let me Check it . 
 Yes , the battery is dead . 
 No , I've only got one . OK , thank you all the same . 
 That's so kind of you . Thank you very much ! 
 Do you have a boyfriend ? 
 Well , I came to know a girl 3 weeks ago and we have so much in common . 
 So I think I may fall in love with her . 
 Then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in love ? 
 That's what I did . 
 Yes . 
 That's it . She likes dogs so much now , and I begin to love dogs . 
 Thanks . But I know falling in love is one thing , while staying in love is another . 
 Yeah . Falling in love is so good ! 
 I don't think the lecture is very interesting . 
 I feel he's like a talking machine . 
 Ann , let's go , or we will be late . 
 It is already 10:25 . 
 What time did you say the train is leaving ? 
 Yes , but what will happen if the bus is late ? 
 ( still on the bus . ) What time is it ? 
 Oh dear , we will miss our train . 
 Yes . Hi , what's up ? 
 I'm afraid not . I'm sick . I have a fever but I'm cold , and I threw up earlier . 
 I would feel better if you came over and took care of me . 
 ( after a while ... ) Walter ! Where are you ? 
 What took you so long ? 
 It's not so bad . 
 It's just that you have to be patient and try to relax . 
 Why not ? Oh well , I'm ready to eat . No need call the doctor . If we run to the restaurant , I can make it to the restroom and you can order . 
 To the restroom ? I have no choice . 
 Is it urgent ? Our ambulances are not enough to meet every call . 
 All right , we'll come right away . 
 He's there in the room . He's very ill . 
 Carry him into the emergency ward . Here we are . 
 ( after a while ... ) I'm his guide . What's the trouble with him , doctor 
 May I send food for him ? 
 Can I come round to see him tomorrow ? 
 Yes . Thank you . 
 OK . 
 When could I take care of him ? 
 My Buddha ! ! It's beautiful ! But I thought you were afraid ? 
 You sneak ! 
 But that's a lot of money ! Honey ! 
 It doesn't matter . I just feel a little dizzy . 
 I don't know . 
 Have I really got to do those exams again , Dad ? 
 And must I go back to school ? 
 But Dad , I should be working full-time at my age . I ’ m nearly 17 . 
 What else I ’ Ve got to do ? Join the army ? 
 Hello , Mr . Jones . We need to have a meeting to discuss our deal . 
 That would be great ! How about 2:30 ? 
 Yes , I ’ Ve been there several times on business trips . But I have never really seen the terra-cotta warriors as it is outside the city . 
 I agree . As long as the food is not too bizarre once I saw some people eating insects . That is frightening . 
 Well , the airport is quite far from the downtown area , but it is still more convenient than taking the train . 
 Which flight ? 
 How about the passengers ? 
 Emily , what kind of report is this ? 
 Don't get smart with me . Here , do it again , but do it right this time . 
 I try to picture the Lord's face in my mind . 
 Yes . 
 Are you married ? 
 Then , you put S in this blank . 
 I'm very sorry to hear that . 
 We'll take great care . 
 Yes , I'm Jame , your neighbor when you lived in here last year . 
 Me too . 
 Sorry , I'm using it myself.But you can use it this afternoon . 
 Which team do you think will emerge with the last laugh in this World Cup ? 
 No , they aren't . They had a hard time in the group stage and only sealed a sit in the eighth-finals with Wallack ' s header in the final three minutes . Just think , group A consists of Austria , China , and Saudi Arabia , all of which are minnows . 
 Well , at least the Germans have demonstrated a very good ability to control the midfield . They recorded a total of 62 tackles in the match against Austria . And they to be endowed with perfect positional sense . I think that will give rise to scoring chances sooner or later . 
 That's why I still have very high hopes for the team . Now that the tournament has proceeded into the knock-out stage , the Germans will probably make it through to the finals . 
 The May holiday is coming up soon . Are you planning on going on vacation ? 
 Where are you planning on going ? 
 I went a long time ago , before they built the new train that can take you there . 
 Personally , I think it ’ d be better to go when you have more time . A few days isn ’ t really enough to get acclimatize yourself and to go on a few excursions outside of the capital . 
 It ’ s a beautiful city , but I think it ’ s become too touristy . How about going to a cosmopolitan city like Shanghai or Hong Kong ? 
 Maybe you should consider going to a hot springs resort outside of Beijing . I heard they are very relaxing . 
 Since the May holiday is the high season , you should probably call ahead to reserve a room . Here ’ s the phone number . 
 Remittance Advice , how can I help you ? 
 That's no problem . There are 3 ways you can do this , firstly you can send the money account to account , or you can choose to send cash to account or you can send cash to individual . Which service would you like ? 
 If you choose our Urgent Remittance Service the money can be there within 2 hours . There will be a 1 % handling fee and then you need to pay 12 RIB for the Express Delivery Service . 
 Hi . Bob ! We've been working hard at our lessons for a fortnight . So why don't we take it easy this weekend ? 
 How about seeing a play ? I hear Hamlet is on at the National Theater . 
 ( looking at a newspaper ) Oh , dear me ! There's no performance at the National theater this weekend . So we have to go to cinema instead . 
 Let me see .. um . Gone With the Wind . It is on at six cinemas on Saturday night . 
 Ah . The Royal , I think . 
 Why don't we go to the 7:30 show ? It is convenient to us , I think . 
 Do you want to go to the earlier or the later show ? 
 Then , there's a 9:30 show . 
 All right . 
 Hi , Jenny . It's David here . 
 Not much . My girlfriend just dumped me . 
 Well , she told me things just weren ’ t working out and we weren ’ t right together . But I thought things were just great . Why did she say this ? It's completely out of the blue . 
 What ? She was cheating on me with that ugly guy . Oh , no , I feel like such a loser . 
 But she lied to me . 
 Ok , then . 
 What face ? 
 Yeah , I know . You are right . 
 Maybe it is right since everything is possible . You know the market changes quickly these days . But I still have doubted those funds with bad stock performance . For me , his stock record is the very important criteria to decide which to buy . I really want to decrease the risk reach the minimum and achieve the maximum returns . 
 I will think about it . 
 Yes , I did . Did you ? 
 Oh yes , I loved it . Wasn't the scene with the judge great ? 
 Who do you think is the greatest novelist in the history of English literature ? 
 I'm afraid I can't agree with you on that . I like D.H.Laurence ' s novels better . 
 So the reform can not be carried out well . 
 Easier said than done . 
 No , thanks . I've had more than enough.In fact , I must be running along . 
 I'm afraid I have to leave . I have to be up early tomorrow . 
 Don't look a gift horse in the mouth ! That was the best they had . 
 Yes , we will depart in 10 minutes . 
 Yes , it is . 
 Have you anything to declare ? 
 Where did you buy it ? 
 Do you travel a lot ? 
 Twice a year ? How long has your sister lived in Boston ? 
 I see , that's a long time.How much was the watch ? 
 Yes , I'd like to see the receipt.Oh ! I see you bough the watch last week . 
 Yes , I'm afraid you will.Altogether on the watch and the perfume you owe me seven pounds . 
 Yes , that's fine . I hope you enjoyed your stay in Boston ? 
 Hello , is it necessary to do warm-up exercise ? I can't wait to dive into the water . 
 Yeah , I see . You are just doing your job . But I wanna know what the advantages it has . 
 As far as I know , people will be weak if they swim too long . 
 Is it very dangerous ? I'm a little scared . Do you offer the lifebuoy for us ? 
 Do you have the workers to save me if anything should happen ? 
 Could I trouble you for a minute , Mr . Graham ? 
 I would like to leave a few minutes early today . Would that be all right ? 
 Hello , sir . I'm ready for you . 
 Yes , please sit on the chair.How do you want to have your hair cut ? 
 OK.Now lean back a little and keep still . I'm going to shave your face . 
 Toilets are in the rear , I am afraid all the toilets are fully occupied at the moment . 
 You are welcome . 
 Swimming in summer and skating in winter.What ' s your favorite sport ? 
 No I don't But l do Taijiquan or Shadow boxing.People everywhere in China usually do Taijiquan early in the morning.It can help people keep fit.It has a history of over three hundred years . 
 Yes . it is I can teach you if you like . 
 Right . Let's help each other . 
 We're sorry you have to leave . 
 Certainly . Come back soon . 
 Today is Tuesday , 25th September , 2001 . 
 What time is your appointment ? 
 What time is now ? Do you have the correct time ? 
 It must be about 6 o'clock . 
 You won't be late . It's still early . 
 Is dinner served ? 
 Please give me some chicken . 
 Thank you , you are so thoughtful . I think I could use some beers right now . 
 Oh I ’ m learning very slowly . I think Chinese is more difficult than English . 
 Maybe , but I think people usually learn English more quickly than Chinese . 
 Maybe that ’ s why your English is much better than my Chinese . 
 I partly agree with you . Buying stocks is not difficult , but making money consistently from buying stock is very difficult . Even professionals don ’ t find it easy , so be careful . Anyway , people like us need help with investing . Why not do some online research ? There are data , reports and discussion forums to educate people on how to invest . In addition , you need to visit an established website that offers stock charts . 
 I just watched the investment TV program last weekend . It has become a very hot topic these days . Actually I am not even a beginner . 
 Thank you for coming . We will have dinner outside . Eat up ! 
 I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ? 
 I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ? 
 You need a babysitter . 
 I could have Suzy stay at my place . 
 Why not ? 
 I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston.She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely . 
 I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible . 
 I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself . 
 Hi , my name is Ted , what ’ s yours ? 
 I said , I ’ m Ted , who are you ? 
 Do you somewhere often , Laura ? 
 Let ’ s go outside and talk . So Laura , do you come here often ? 
 I asked if you come here often . 
 No , this is my first time here . 
 Yeah , that ’ s why I ’ m here . My friends dragged me here , because they think I spend too much time studying . 
 I guess so . But the music is too loud . I don ’ t mind getting out and meeting people , but next time I ’ ll do it in a park . 
 As of today it is . Memorial Day marks the end of the school year and the beginning of summer . 
 ... and for us to get tans in our new bikinis . 
 That's smart these days with all the news on skin cancer . Hey , there's everybody ! We made it ! 
 I don't think so . Did you ever go and look at your stamp ? 
 But you've been looking for that stamp for years . 
 Bummer . I guess we're both out of luck . 
 Thanks for inviting me to work out with you , Joan . 
 Yeah , this place looks great . Wow , look at her , she can certainly get down , can't she ? 
 A little , I wish I could do that . 
 Look at him , he's buff . 
 How do they all get in such tiptop shape ? 
 That's it . I decided to turn over a new leaf . I'm going to exercise every single day . 
 Paul , what kind of music do you like to listen to ? 
 I have tickets to a show . Do you want to go with me ? 
 Pop . It's Maria Carey . 
 At 8P M tomorrow night . 
 Yes , that's a good idea . 
 Oh , I think I know the place you mean . We ate there last month , right ? 
 Oh , look at those earrings , Maria . They're perfect for you . 
 No , the yellow ones . 
 Well , that necklace isn't bad . 
 That blue one right there . How much is it ? 
 Hey , let me get it for you . It's your birthday present . 
 I ’ m having a problem . 
 There have been charges made on my debit card that I didn ’ t make . 
 Here it is . 
 The last four charges on the page . 
 How long will an investigation take ? 
 That sounds absolutely fantastic . 
 Fine , thank you . 
 Very well , thank you . I ’ m meeting my wife and daughter for lunch at 12 , would you care to join us ? 
 My baggage is missing ! 
 Here they are . 
 How soon would you deliver my baggage ? 
 At the down town Hilton Hotel . 
 I'm going to return next week . 
 Look out , honey . Let's come to the shoal waters . Follow me ! 
 Honey , listen to me . First , you should learn how to breathe in and breathe out . 
 Do be patient , Honey . Let's do it slowly and correctly . 
 Come on , sweetie , you've done very well . It is the first step that is tough . 
 Yes , well done . That's the way to go . How clever you are ! You've got it . 
 Exactly , next , you should hold your legs together and extend your arms above your head . 
 That's the way to go . Now , you are flying , my boy . 
 Kevin Belknap . 
 B-E-L-K-N-A-P . 
 These are new arrivals . 
 Try them if you like . 
 What about that one over there ? 
 Hello , Is this EYE computers ? 
 Actually , I'm calling to complain about your service . The computer I bought last week is faulty . 
 Well , easily , It doesn't work . It doesn't even start probably . 
 Do you want to know what really motivates Vince to be nice to me ? 
 It isn't gratitude . It's fear . Vince is afraid I'll jump to a competitor . 
 I might . Vince knows he needs to keep me happy . 
 Hello . Can I sit here ? 
 By the way , I'm Robin . 
 Nice to meet you . 
 I'm from Kathmandu . What about you ? 
 Bye . See you . 
 That's a very popular way to pay nowadays , totally hassle free ! 
 Please fill in this application and sign your name down here , at the bottom . 
 I just need to see some ID , like a passport for example . 
 We usually ask for 100 RIB , Sir . 
 So , that's everything done for you . Here's your new cheque book , the cheque guarantee will follow in the post in a couple of days . 
 I feel eggplants are more nutritious . 
 Oh , that's how you see it . 
 Nothing ' doing . 
 To the office . I'll be right back . 
 Yes ? 
 Yes , it is . 
 Good heavens , am I really ? I'm so sorry , I didn't notice . 
 I see . 
 What's that book you have under your arm ? 
 How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn . 
 Is it really worth paying for ? 
 If it's any good , I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition . 
 But Saturday is my birthday . 
 But it won ’ t be on my birthday . 
 You would be using mainly English in this job . Do you think you can make yourself understood in English with ease ? 
 How many years have you been learning English ? 
 Well , perhaps that's the reason why you are so fluent in it . 
 Where are we going to visit today ? 
 Really ? I have heard there are many famous national park in the US , which one exactly ? 
 That's wonderful . I will see the Old Faithful for myself . 
 Don't rush , behave yourself please ! Let the people get off first . 
 But , if we all pushed our way in , nobody could get off , and nobody could get in either . 
 There are four more stops . 
 What's wrong ? You are like a little monkey , on pins and needles ! 
 No , not on the train , but in the station . 
 Well , that is a question . You want to offer a suggestion ? 
 I guess you'll never forget today . 
 Yeah ? What does he want ? 
 I haven ’ t got two minutes at the moment . Can ’ t you go over things without me ? 
 I know how to use the telex machine , the photocopier , and the word processor . By the way , I took a computer course in university . 
 I want to be a manager . 
 Nothing . I think I'll take the job . 
 It's easy . All you have to do is to use your pieces to surround the opponent's pieces and then take over all of his territory . 
 It's easier said than done . When you actually play , it can be very frustrating . 
 Well , you know the time of shipment means a lot to us . 
 I see.OK , that's agreed then . 
 I'm off today . 
 I'm going to need some more info first . I was wondering about the repayments . How long would I have to pay back the loan ? 
 And how much is payable in each instalment ? 
 Well , as far as I can see , the advantages outweigh the disadvantages . You've sold me ! I'd like to go ahead . 
 Which ad would that be ? 
 Good , which job is that ? We advertised several openings . 
 Yes , it is . But we'll be making a decision on it pretty soon . Why don't you come in and fill out an application ? 
 We can discuss that when you come in and fill out the application . 
 I'm afraid I can't discuss that over the phone . 
 We're an Employment Agency . 
 Sweet and sour pro chops , Madam . 
 In a minute , Madam . 
 Take me to the railroad station . Can you put my baggage in the trunk ? 
 Over there . 
 They're just gifts I bought . Don't worry . They are not heavy . 
 Which book ? Your cookbook ? 
 Isn ’ t it on the bookshelf ? 
 Then have you put it in the bedroom ? 
 Ok . Look ! It ’ s just near your foot . 
 Wake up , Mary . 
 We're all going to church . Do you want to come ? 
 Are you sure ? 
 Okay , then . We'll be back around noon . 
 Do you have a copy of today ’ s newspaper ? I want to check the results from the world athletics championship . 
 Yes , we won the men ’ s 110 metres hurdles . I watched that on TV . What other events did we win ? 
 That ’ s great . Those athletes must train for years to get into peak physical condition . They must be terribly disappointed if they don ’ t win . 
 That ’ s amazing ! Were any other records broken ? 
 Did you see the final of the men ’ s 100 metres ? It was very exciting . One competitor made two false starts . 
 Yes , he was . I imagine he must be very angry with himself for that . 
 Here you are . seventy-five cent , please . 
 Is there anything valuable in it ? 
 Shall I make out a receipt ? 
 That ‘ ll be ninety-five cents in all . 
 You'd just let sleeping dogs lie . 
 Anything you say or do might make it worse . Just try to ride out the storm for a while . 
 You'd better leave her alone . 
 Just tell her off . 
 May I come in ? 
 This seems a pretty nice room , I should say . 
 What about the kitchen ? 
 I see . I'd like to live here for about three years . 
 Next Saturday at the earliest . 
 Yes , hello . Our company used your bank to send some documents to Malaysia last week . Could you check and see if the proceeds have come back yet , please ? It's Sang Hung Enterprises , based in Kula Lump . 
 That's as it should be . When will it be paid in and credited to our account ? 
 Excuse me . Do you speak English ? 
 Well , I've just arrived in my room , but there are no instructions in English about the facilities available ! Could you help me for a moment ? 
 First , what is the number for room service ? 
 Very good . Now , could you help me to adjust the air conditioning , please ? It's too hot in my room . 
 Yes , that's perfect . Another thing , if need more items for the mini-bar , which Number should I call ? 
 I see . So , is it possible to make international phone calls from my room ? 
 Well , thanks a lot for your help . 
 OK , goodbye . 
 Delicious ! Did you make this chocolate cake yourself , Fred ? 
 It's really good . 
 Why ? 
 It is all up to you . 
 I think my greatest accomplishment has been acquiring the Hans account . 
 Yes , it took a year and a lot of initiative to get that account . 
 The last two years we have seen an increase in sales of about 30 % to 40 % each year , so I ’ m very pleased . And our sales projections are quite good for the next two years . 
 Hmm ... I think I am ready for a new challenge . I've put a good team together at my present company , and I think If I want to take the next step in my career , it's time for me to move on . 
 Yes , sing a song . But don ’ t sing a sad song . 
 Well , please sing one that ’ s not sad . 
 Any plans tonight ? 
 Well , I am wondering if we took a hang-out for a drink or something . You know , I just came back from a really tough interview . I was quite nervous during the interview . I really want to have the job . Right now , I am still a little on the edge . I am not sure if I could convince them during the interview . 
 I don ’ t know . I think I did well in the paper exams . I was prepared to answer a lot of questions , but they didn ’ t ask those as I expected . To my surprise , the manager tried to talk about the Chinese poesy with me . 
 Just did my best . 
 Yes , I am . 
 Thank you for meeting me at the airport , Steven . 
 Thanks . Where is our car ? 
 OK . Let's go . 
 I don't think dieting is good for you . It's much better to eat a balanced diet and to never get overweight to begin with ! 
 They need to eat healthy foods , but they also have to increase the amount of exercise they do every day . They don't have to cut out fattening foods altogether , though . 
 Sure , they can eat some chocolate . As long as they are exercising and eating mostly healthy foods , there's nothing wrong with having a small dessert . 
 Many people gain weight by drinking far too much soda . Soda should be a treat ; there's simply no nutritional value in it whatsoever . If you want to lose weight and you can't stop drinking soda , try some diet coke . 
 My mother used to make me take vitamins every day , but I don't take them anymore . Vitamins are good as a supplement , but they don't do much good if you don't have a well-balanced diet to start . 
 You might not believe this , but I used to be twice the size than I am now ! 
 That ’ s true . We had an argument yesterday . She blamed me for not preparing the supper that day , but it was her turn to cook the dinner . 
 Yes . 
 That wasn ’ t my fault , but she said ' you're a disgrace ' to me . I'm about to explode ! 
 To be honest , I ’ m not , and I regret a little what I have done . 
 No way . It ’ s her who should apologize . 
 No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill . 
 This waitress has really been on top of things , hasn't she ? 
 OK , let's see what the damage is . The total for our meal is $ 36.00 . 
 Fifteen percent is a normal tip , but she really did a great job . What do you think about 20 % this time ? 
 Her tip will end up being $ 7.20 plus the bill of $ 36.00 . The total will be $ 43.20 . 
 I agree . Maybe we can come back again next week . 
 Just a minute . I am as busy as a bee right now ... Ok , I am done . What can I do for you ? 
 Well , keep you chin up ! I ’ ll try to help you . Where are you going ? 
 Yes , no problem . You walk down this street . You turn left at the first intersection . Walk along that road , turn right at the corner . After that , you make a left-hand turn at the first traffic light . The Royal Hotel is on your right side . 
 Yeah , I think so . I think the hotel is right across the street from a post office . It is as plain as the hump on a camel . You can't miss it . 
 Yeah , it ’ s gonna take you a while if you go by foot . I ’ d say it's about a 30 - minute uphill walk . You have to be as strong as a lion to make it . 
 Well , you could take a bus there , but you would have to transfer buses twice . A taxi would probably be a lot quicker . 
 Not too long . It should take about ten mins by taxi . 
 You are welcome . 
 Yes , I've found a wonderful property I wish to buy . Unfortunately , I just don't have access to the cash . 
 It's 600,000 RIB . But I've already put down 200,000 RIB , which is my absolute limit , so I'm looking for a loan of 400,000 RIB . 
 I already have an account with you , so it should be pretty straight forward . 
 I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking . 
 I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house . 
 Not necessarily . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive . 
 Realtors always get a commission.If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him . 
 Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them . 
 Of course we need a home inspector.But we can hire an inspector on our own.And as for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us . 
 It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper.Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads.Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them . 
 Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves . 
 Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher.He will have to pay a commission to the realtor . 
 It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time.That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome . 
 Alright . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drug store . 
 Um ? 
 As you like . 
 It doesn ’ t make any difference to me . 
 Leave me alone . 
 We've taken on a civil engineer on a nine-month temporary contract . He'll oversee the whole project . In fact we're having a project meeting at 3 p . m this afternoon allocate responsibilities and finalise the time schedule . Why don't you join us ? 
 What's all this noise about ? 
 Why ? 
 I'm going to go shopping for groceries in a little bit . 
 I believe we are all out of food . 
 I don't know what we need . 
 I would appreciate it if you would do that for me . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Go make that list . 
 Why is the long face ? 
 Did you just get your review or something ? 
 That sucks . 
 Look on the bright side . At least you have a job . 
 Exactly . Instead , we should have some drinks tonight . 
 Now you're talking . 
 Yes . I am capable of speaking English smoothly . I have been learning English for years . 
 I have no trouble communicating with native English Speaker . I even taught spoken English in a training school . 
 That's right . They always talk about a need for new , progressive tactics , but they haven't done anything to stimulate new jobs . 
 The worst part is that the inflation hurts the poor more than the rich . It also leads to more unemployment in the long run . I don't know what a good solution would be to make the economy more vibrant again ... 
 After probation , you'll find that our silk products feels more comfortable than others . 
 It's selling like hot cakes , and we have lots of regulars now . Would you like to place a trial order ? 
 Yes , we have the free samples for customers . And you can have a try . 
 Please wait a moment and fill out the order form . And we'll send you our sample . 
 Are these the clothes you want to have washed ? 
 Well , if they are collected right now , you can get them back tonight . 
 OK . Please fill in the form first . 
 Yes ? 
 Sure . There ’ s a lot here in this pamphlet . 
 Take the subway . It ’ s $ 1.50 per ride . You can buy a metro card at the station . 
 My pleasure . 
 Certainly . 
 Several years ago . 
 I want to have a look at the microwave ovens . 
 Not really . What are these toys over there ? 
 I don't like its color . A bit too bright . Do you have a grey one ? 
 Really ? How so ? 
 Okay . 
 How about its quality ? 
 What about the price ? 
 Is this the baggage claim area for flight KB256 ? 
 But I am a transfer passenger . I have a connecting flight to Miami . 
 Yes.It ' s quite troublesome . 
 Are you ready to order now , sir ? 
 Would you like an appetizer ? 
 Would you like some soup first ? 
 What kind of soup would you like ? 
 Have you decided on anything ? 
 How about stewed-fried steamed pork ? 
 Are you interested in today's special ? 
 Twice cooked spicy pork slices . 
 Anything else ? 
 Hey George , how is your chicken ? 
 My fish is pretty dry too . 
 Yes , it seems that way to me also . 
 My vegetables are very soggy . 
 I don't usually complain , but I think that we should mention this to the waiter . 
 In case you didn't know , I'm checking out in half an hour . 
 That's good to hear . Now there's still a whole New York day ahead of me . 
 I still have time to explore more of New York , but I need a place to secure my baggage . 
 A deposit , huh ? I would think my baggage would be enough of a deposit . 
 That deposit bothers me . Give me a minute . 
 You are very late , but I was on pins and needles the whole time . 
 Do you know that Mary an Ben have already separated ? 
 I didn ’ t know it until yesterday . I put my foot into it , and was even stupid enough to ask when they would get married . 
 I think I've caught a cold . Now I'm aching all over . 
 Thank you . I suppose I should go to see a doctor . 
 No , there's no such section . The dairy section is where you'll find milk and cheese . 
 That's where you'll find things like salt and pepper . 
 Let's go to aisle 4 to pick up some pasta for tonight . 
 And let's get a loaf of bread at the bakery for breakfast . 
 I'll put the shopping basket back . 
 No , it sounds wrong . He was born in the 16th century . 
 1564 . 
 Mmmm ... , it's hard to say . I like golf a lot-but I guess like skating better . 
 No , I'm strictly a spectator . I just like watching skating . It's so beautiful . 
 Jack ! Do you want to see a picture of my new puppy ? 
 Well , this is my new baby . He ’ s just as much trouble . That ’ s for sure ! But , he ’ s a lot of fun ! 
 Hello , this is Lucy from ABC Company . 
 I ’ m calling to see if you have made your decision . You are the right person we are seeking for . 
 Good news for us . When can you start to work ? 
 Ok , please come to my office at 9 AM next Monday . I will introduce you to our boss . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 The Godfather and The Godfather II , of course . They were both directed by Francis Ford Coppola . 
 Only about old movies , really ... 
 I know Mark is your only child . You may do it differently from what I did . Sometimes I would tap their hands when they made troubles . 
 And what does your husband do ? 
 But spoiling a child is not going to do him good either ! You ’ Ve got to have patience with him and teach him . It ’ s not easy , I know . It ’ s hard . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 I'd like to . How do you like the hat ? 
 How about the umbrella ? It's made of wood and paper . It's very beautiful . 
 Do you like it ? 
 Fifty yuan . 
 You did an excellent job in this project . 
 Congratulations . 
 Ha ... I am not sure . 
 Let me think . How much did you have in mind ? 
 That's a lot of money . Let me think about it carefully . 
 Yes . It's perfect . 
 I couldn't have asked for more . 
 Yes , what can I do for you ? 
 You are welcome , Mr . Sun . 
 Sorry , we haven't made the decision at all . But we should be making the decision by the end of this week . And we'll get in touch with you once we make it . 
 No . 
 Thank you for the calling . Bye-bye . 
 Where have you been ? 
 That's too bad . Please try to fix it so that it doesn't happen again . 
 Thank you , have a seat . We are working on the new project 
 Let's take a look at the Campbell Project . 
 Let's take another look at it for those of you who don't understand . 
 First , as far as I know , your company has had an impressive growth record . Second , I want to get into the foreign trade business . 
 I'm in charge of marketing activities in South-East Asia , for example , organizing trade conferences and arranging exhibitions . 
 Yes . Are there chances for employees to be transferred to overseas branches of the company ? 
 That would be good . 
 Yes . He's waiting for you in his office . This way , please . 
 You don't know what happened ? 
 There was a truck on the freeway , and it flipped over . 
 I wouldn't lie about something like that . 
 I heard that a couple people got hurt . 
 The news said they should be fine . 
 Me too . 
 Let me just park my car in a better position . Alright , miss . Where ’ s the luggage ? 
 May I order some cable from you today ? 
 I'm not sure of what packages you offer . 
 Are there any other packages ? 
 I want a package that has the basic and movie channels . 
 I would like to get that . 
 That's it , but will I be able to add more channels at another time ? 
 May I help you ? 
 What ’ s the problem ? 
 I need to see a statement for your debit card . 
 Can you show me which charges you ’ re referring to ? 
 We will need to do an investigation on this . 
 We ’ ll have to freeze payment on those charges until the investigation is finished . 
 But how did you know I was working for WebTracker ? 
 He couldn't have told you . Only a few people at WebTracker know about me . 
 I can't believe it . I can't believe I fell into your trap . 
 What are your strengths and weaknesses ? 
 Why are you qualified for this position ? 
 What can you contribute to the position of a market analyst ? 
 What job-related skills do you have ? 
 Hello . Green Trading Company . What can I do for you ? 
 Yes . It'll be at three o'clock this afternoon . 
 Didn't we make that appointment a long time ago ? 
 How about Friday afternoon ? 
 Do you think my briefcase is big enough to put in all these stuff ? 
 I guess I need all of them . 
 I know . But it is my lucky charm . I carry it all the time . 
 Hi , Mary ! You're here already . Where's Harry ? 
 That should give us time for a cup of coffee . I'll go and get some . 
 Plaza Hotel , good morning . Leo speaking . 
 Certainly . A single room is 120 dollars American , per night . 
 And when would you like the rooms ? 
 Arriving the 25th of September and leaving on the 28th ? Three nights ? 
 Just a minute please . 
 Yes , thank you . 
 My name is Mona White . 
 Jack Webber . 
 Sure . W-E-double B-E-R . 
 No , double B for Bravo 
 Hello ! Mr . Wang . this is Smith . 
 It's a pleasure . 
 I hope so . 
 Don't mention it . 
 Yes , I will . Have a nice flight back . 
 Good-bye ! 
 An understanding of the basic workings of a company and the services or goods it provides is essential . Do you have that ? 
 With that understanding , you can figure out what your company is looking for in terms of basic attitude . Right ? 
 What you wear is important . So keep in mind what is suitable for the company and type of work you will be doing . Need help ? 
 In addition to clothes we need to think about other basics , OK ? 
 Be prompt . Don't forget to be friendly and interested . Listen carefully and listen to what they are really asking you . You'll be a hit ! 
 Nothing much , what's going on ? 
 Oh , really ? That's nice . 
 This Friday ? Sorry , I already have plans . 
 I'm going to dinner with my family . 
 Yeah , maybe next time . 
 Sounds like a plan . 
 Well , sir . Can I take your measurements first ? 
 That'll be helpful . All right , thank you . 
 No , problem . If you'll wait one moment , I'll make out your receipt . 
 Let me see , with padding and lining cloth , it comes to 357 dollars altogether . 
 In two weeks . 
 What are you doing this weekend ? 
 I was thinking of maybe taking a drive to the beach . 
 Would you be interested in joining me ? 
 I thought that we could leave around 8 
 That was part of my plan . 
 Excuse me . Can I change my seat with you ? I want to sit beside my friend . 
 It's 9 - A in the middle part , a window seat too . 
 Yes , it is . Thank you very much . Let me help you to carry your baggage there . 
 Thanks . Have a nice trip . 
 Yes , I do . I think that science is making us wiser . What do you think ? 
 I believe industry is making us wealthier . 
 And in my opinion , medicine is making us healthier . 
 I don ’ t agree with you . I maintain that we ’ re healthier , wealthier and wiser than we were a hundred years ago . 
 So where is this mystery restaurant that we are going to ? 
 That sounds great ! I am craving some type of beef dish . 
 I see , so what are we having ? Chicken ? 
 Sounds good ! I have always heard that Indian spices give a rich flavor to food . 
 What about veggies ? 
 It all sounds exquisite ! I can ' t wait ! 
 What for ? 
 Oh , yeah ? Are you joking ? 
 Honey , it's good if you spend money to buy more books . But $ 100 dollars a week is enough for you already . 
 That's good . Thank you . 
 It's good . It's a nice room . 
 Thank you . 
 I'd like a cup of mocha . 
 Medium , please . 
 Yeah . give me a chocolate bar also . 
 Please have them wrapped . I'll take them away . 
 Here's eight dollars . Keep the change . 
 I feel confused by all the diet options out there . I don ’ t know which one actually works . 
 Maybe you ’ re right . It is very expensive to go to a weight-loss center . I ’ d better join in a fitness club . 
 I bought an exercise dress yesterday and I found it was hard to dress it up . 
 It's nice to meet you . Thanks for coming . 
 I wanted to meet with you to discuss your daughter . 
 Not at all . She's a joy to have in my class . 
 She is absolutely wonderful . 
 No . She is actually very intelligent and well behaved . 
 You have nothing to worry about with her . 
 Yes , summer is coming . 
 I'd like to go to Tianjin . 
 Yes , of course . And what's your plan ? 
 That's great . 
 Certainly , sir . Double or single breasted ? 
 I see , sir . For a gentleman of your size I would recommend a single-breasted jacket as it does tend to make one look a little slimmer . Just let me take your measurements , Let's see , neck 41cm , chest 110cm , wait 120cm and inside leg 70cm . You do have short legs , sir . 
 Can you come back in three days for a fitting ? 
 Good that way . I can have the suit ready for you two days after that fitting . 
 What kind of bag is it ? 
 What are your room number and your name , please ? 
 Well , let me check . We delivered four bags to room 1106 , you friend's room about an hour ago . 
 You're quite welcome . 
 Yes . We just had a basketball match with Class Two . 
 They did . 
 Seventy to sixty-seven . 
 There're a lot of chuckholes on this old highway . Driving on it is experience-demanding . 
 Ok . You drive and do be careful . 
 Yes , and it is 37 ° C . 
 Yes , I see . Thanks a lot . 
 Sorry . I didn't mean to . 
 Sure . Kind acknowledgments can show one's good attainment . 
 Actually , that's not true . Acknowledgments can help you leave a good impression on others , especially in the public places . 
 In the beginning of the interview , it is best that you make acknowledgments for the opportunity of the interview . 
 Make acknowledgments as well when the interviewer thinks highly of your dressing , experience , or words . 
 Acknowledgments can also help the job-hunters to show their good attainment . 
 Smiles and kind attitudes are the basics of acknowledgments . 
 You can ’ t really tell everything about a house from the outside . Let ’ s go inside . 
 I think that fresh paint and cleaning would help it look a little better . 
 I hear that the kitchen is quite large . Let ’ s go check it out . 
 The master suite is supposed to be quite elegant . Maybe it will be a little better . 
 I think that we have seen all that we need to see here . Let ’ s go look at another house . 
 No , I'm not . 
 No , I'm not . I'm going to look for an apartment . 
 I'm going to try to find a place near the office . 
 Out in the suburbs.It ' s a long trip to work every day . 
 I'm going to buy a newspaper and check the classified ads . 
 I know , but I'm going to enroll in a night school to take a course in business management . 
 But , I want to ride it , Daddy . 
 Great . Let's go . 
 That's wonderful . Congratulations . 
 I'd love to . What date is it ? 
 What day is that ? 
 Yes , sure . What time will the wedding begin ? 
 Very good ! I'm looking forward to it . Please give my best regards to John . And I wish you best luck ! 
 Your house is too small . Why not buy a big one . 
 You can get a loan from the bank . You know LPF program provides low cost loans for participants home purchases . 
 Good afternoon , how can I help you ? 
 I am sorry to hear about that . Would you mind coming with me to my office and tell me exactly what happened here ? 
 Are you sure that it isn't somewhere in your room ? 
 Ok , when and where did you last see it ? 
 Are you sure you didn't wear it this morning ? 
 Did you remember to lock your door before you left then ? 
 Well , I understand how you feel , and we will try to do our best to help you . But first please allow me to send one of the housemaids to your room to look for it again thoroughly , just in case it's still in there . If she finds it , we will all be happy . If she doesn't , we will turn the whole matter to the police . But I must say that the hotel can't be held responsible for your loss . You should have locked your gold necklace away at the hotel ’ s safety box . If you had read your key card carefully , you would have realized that we specially warned you to do so . 
 I am sorry , ma ’ am . Our general manager is not in town . But I ’ d be more than glad to get you our assistant manager , if you like . But I am afraid that he will say the same thing . We have very clear instructions about valuables and we must follow them . And now if you will excuse me , I'll go and find our assistant manager for you . 
 Sure . I suggest you take a bus there . It's a bit too long for you to walk there . 
 Tour 2 . 
 It opens at 9:00 from April to October . 
 Welcome to our company . 
 An impressive officer is vital to the image projected by the company . 
 She is dealing with customers and driving up new business . The guy next to her is in charge of their office computer network . 
 He is our accountant . 
 Indeed , they are . Keeping staff happy is the only way to keep them with the company . 
 We've missed you too . The office just isn't the same without you . How is your new job ? 
 What happened ? 
 Wow , so you'll be out thirty dollars on your first week at work ! 
 Well , every department is different . You wouldn't want your new co-workers to think you're a Grinch , right ? 
 A Grinch is a person who spoils the mood at a happy occasion by being selfish or unenthusiastic . You know - a party proper . 
 Do you take a bus to and from work ? 
 Hmm . I have the same problem . When I leave work , it ’ s always rush hour.So the buses are always crowded . 
 That sounds terrible the way you describe it . But you know , not long ago I really suffered on the bus . 
 You just can ’ t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full , so I waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding ! 
 Yeah , absolutely ! 
 You were so happy , weren ’ t you ? 
 Hey , Mary , can you cut that out ? 
 The tapping of your pen on your desk . It ’ s driving me crazy . 
 I don ’ t slurp my coffee . And plus , how can you hear it when you ’ re shouting into your phone all the time ? 
 Look , we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions , and it ’ s probably okay to let off steam once in a while . But , it ’ s probably not a good idea to keep it up I ’ m willing to forgive and forget and if you are . 
 Yeah , I ’ ll try to do the same.So , I was wondering you wanna go out to dinner Friday night ? 
 Big talk , I ’ d say . He does not have a girlfriend yet . 
 What do you think of the project ? 
 Are you interested in making this investment ? 
 It's not good for business recently . 
 Too risky anyway.It ' s necessary to look before you leap . 
 Well , we could eat in more . That 300 dollars for entertainment is mostly going to restaurants . 
 No , I need my books . 
 Well , what about the 50 you spent on a shirt ? You could have gotten something for less . 
 All right . That sounds fair . 
 Is that difficult ? 
 That's all right . What can I do ? 
 Well . I can do it . And then ? 
 Who will pay for these things ? 
 OK . I will go in no time . 
 Miss ! 
 My name is Jane Brown ! 
 Mr . Martin ? I need to talk to you for a minute . 
 Well , I ’ d just like you to help me with the holiday schedule . 
 Simon , may I introduce you to Linda ? You don ’ t know each other , do you ? 
 How do you do ? I ’ m pleased to meet you . 
 Please sit down . Help yourself just like you are at home . 
 A cup of coffee , please . 
 Alright , sir . You are making a good choice.Honda has made a lot of design improvements in the new Accord . 
 On all our new cars , the standards includeair conditioning , anti-lock brakes , air bags , and an AM / FM stereo with a CD player.But on the Accord , there is another standard item as well.The Accord com 
 Why not , sir ? 
 Well , sir , I know some of our customers are concerned about cruise control.But Honda has never had a single cruise control malfunction that led to an accident . 
 You know , sir , you don't have to use it.You can turn it on or off . If you don't want to use it , you just never turn it on . 
 No , the sunroof is optional , sir . 
 Well , I can say that the new models will be here in August.If you order one now , we will have it for you in August . 
 We have this new model in red , white , black , or silver.These are the standard colors.Of course you could specially order from various other colors too . 
 I know the color you mean . Is this it , sir ? 
 Yes , you can.That color is very popular with Honda buyers . So we've kept it available . 
 You have made a good choice , sir . I drive an Accord myself . They are very solidly built machines , very reliable . 
 Alright , sir . I will get the paperwork ready for you . Just a moment . 
 I'm falling in love . 
 That girl in my econ class . She is so hot . 
 No . I didn't even talk to her yet . But I think I'm in love . 
 I don't think so . I've been following her around campus and I haven't seen another guy . 
 I plan on running into her in the cafeteria when she's alone . I think I'll ask her then . 
 She's the only thing I can think of all day long . 
 Aright . I'll talk to you later . 
 I trust you ’ re keeping well ? 
 So we can get down to business . 
 Where are you going to find one ? 
 Do you want to know where I bought mine ? 
 I got it from IKEA . 
 It cost me a couple thousand for the whole set . 
 The furniture is built extremely well . 
 Well , trust me . The quality is fantastic . 
 Who do you think that has the motive ? 
 OK , murder will out ! 
 Do you like being a doctor ? 
 Can you tell me about it ? 
 What can you do when this happens ? 
 Mary , this company is pretty good . I really want to have an interview . 
 Not yet . Do I have to ? 
 Why ? 
 Yes , you are right . 
 Sure . Why didn't I think of that ? 
 Then how can I make the appointment ? 
 Ok , I see . 
 Room service.What can I do for you ? 
 Well , let me check for you . I am sorry , sir . They mistook your order as a normal one.Actualty it's an express laundry , is that right ? 
 Sir , we are terribly sorry for that.We will refund the charge and send your laundry to your room 3 hours later . Is that all right ? 
 Let ’ s move out of here . This apartment is too small . 
 A house would be great . I could plant a garden . And you could use the garage for a workshop . 
 How much is the rent ? 
 When is the place available ? 
 Have you got any specific proposal about the terms of payment ? 
 I'm sorry to say the only term of payment we can accept is 100 % irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents . 
 I'm afraid not . We insist on a letter of credit , because as seller , we also have the problem of funds being tied up . 
 Consult your bank and see if they will reduce the required deposit to a minimum . 
 I'm afraid I'm going to the gym for a workout . 
 I began to went there last month . 
 Well , I think I'm in better condition now . 
 It was at the beginning . You just need to keep it up . 
 Of course , yes . 
 I felt as if I had been in a different world . 
 Good afternoon , Mrs.Vale.Please sit down . 
 Did you work as a salesperson before , Mrs.Vale ? 
 I see . Well , consulting is a little different . 
 Umm hmm.Do you have a diver's license ? 
 Fine.We provide a company car for our consultants . 
 Oh yes-five days a week.You have to visit customers all over the territory . 
 You'll have to attend a three-week course . If you do well , the job is yours . 
 Starting salary is $ 150 a week-plus commissions , of course . 
 Five percent . 
 Fine.The next course starts a week from tomorrow . 
 Good luck to you . 
 I really want to take him over my knee . 
 If you say so ! 
 What ? 
 No ! He hit me first . 
 May I help you ? 
 Ask away . 
 Why do you need to take the course ? 
 You have to do six hours behind the wheel . 
 You can't finish in less than three days . 
 There's nothing else to it . 
 Hi , John . 
 Oh , no problem . 
 Six months . 
 Well , one year would be fine , too . I ’ m not planning on leaving the area anytime soon . 
 Just let me look at it quickly . 
 Looks like a standard lease . 
 O . K . Great . Just sign and date it here ? 
 Wonderful . 
 Let me see , about five years , we established our business relationship with Hua Mei of China Import & Export Corporation in 2003 . 
 I don't think I have any problem with our Chinese partners . They have always followed the contract strictly . We can do business directly with the corporation . As I mentioned before , the Chinese government is trying very hard to perfect its law . Its commercial legislation provides legal protection for foreign companies . 
 Actually not at present . But we are afraid it will . You know policies influence business to some extent . I hope our government will not be influenced by some extremists . China is really a large market . We don't want to lose it . 
 You're welcome . 
 I have been employed as a secretary at a trading company . 
 I find it interesting . 
 I go to the office by bus every day . 
 My main responsibility is trouble-shooting between top management and the general employees . 
 No , often my boss requires overtime work . 
 5,000 yuan a month . 
 I would like to have a job that is more lively than my present one . Besides , I would like to practise my English in my work . As my present employer deals with China trade towards China only , there isn ’ t much chance to speak English . 
 I couldn't do that . I have an important meeting to go to today . 
 not really . After a 12 - hour flight , I've got jetlag , and on top of that , I think I've also got the flu . 
 could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever ? 
 ok . I'll stay home this morning and rest , but if I feel better in the afternoon , I'm going to the meeting . 
 I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing . 
 just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks . 
 shouldn't we make an appointment first ? 
 whatever you say . I just want to get to my meeting ! 
 Why is that ? 
 Yes , the snow is fun . 
 How big was it ? 
 How long did it take ? 
 Did you give him a nose ? 
 Let me help you make one this year . 
 Let me see . Yes , here you are . 
 No , they won't . They are shrink proof . 
 I'm checking out now . Can I have my bill , please ? 
 It's 876 . Here is my key card . 
 Can I pay with traveler's check ? 
 Here you are . 
 Well I ’ m impressed with what the company has done in the past and I think by hiring me the company ’ s future can only be brighter . I find that my personal goals and ideas about business operation 
 Yes , I believe that it ’ s crucial for me to know if a company is right for me , not just if I ’ m right for the company . I ’ Ve only been impressed by what I ’ Ve read and heard and I see myself having 
 Well I ’ m definitely a team player as well as being highly self-motivated . I believe this company can fulfill my long-term goals and offer me great upward mobility . Therefore you will find in me 
 It ’ s all my faults . I forget where I put it . 
 Speaking of seafood , my mouth is watering . Let's go to the seafood restaurant in our neighborhood . 
 Look at the crystal clear fridge . You can see so many kinds of seafood in it . They all look very fresh and delicious . 
 You sound like a seafood expert . I would like to have some stir-fried squids and steamed shrimps . 
 Let's go into the restaurant and find a table to order some food . 
 OK . I will wait for you inside the restaurant 
 I feel like I'm craving a salad . 
 I have no idea . 
 I like those too . 
 I'd really like a salad with chicken . 
 I always make my salads with shredded cheese , croutons , and almonds . 
 Why don't you put it in your salad ? 
 May doesn't get along very well with her mother-in-law . 
 Poor John ! He is bothering both sides of this bread . 
 I don't know how to adjust my life . Would you give me a piece of advice ? 
 Yes , I can't sleep well every night . 
 I drink a lot of wine . 
 I often feel so tired . 
 I sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me . 
 Good morning , sir . Can I help you ? 
 Do you know what color your wife often wears ? 
 Would you like this color or other colors ? 
 Then how do you like this plum red one ? 
 Yes , sir . 
 Of course . 
 What words ? Can you tell me ? 
 Honey , I don ’ t know what to tell you . Of course Tony is a young child . But do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason . 
 I suggest you treat him with patience , affection , and respect . If he needs to do something , like go to bed , or be washed , etc . , please guide or help him to get it done , but lead him with gentleness . 
 Motivate Tony to cooperate by rewarding his good behavior . Do not emphasize punishment for bad moods , etc . Do not threaten him with punishment if he resists the actions you desire . 
 You are married to a foreigner , huh ? So what ’ s it like ? 
 Yeah , I know what you mean . The first year of any marriage is difficult for all couples , not to mention two people from different cultures . 
 Oh , so he ’ s half Chinese and half American . That ’ s unusual . What languages does he speak , then ? 
 What does he look like ? Can people tell ? 
 Our major is from a bigger city . 
 He brings with him some talented people from his former city . 
 I think we should accept his plan . 
 Why ? 
 Did you hear about Joe ? She hasn't eaten for days . 
 Love sick . You know who she's in love with ? 
 Someone you're living with . 
 Come on , Mary , it's your brother , Jack . 
 The problem with Joe is that she's too shy to tell him . 
 Well , if you want to help your friend , you should do something about it . 
 Oh , how dreadful ! I ’ m ever so sorry . 
 Thank God ! 
 We are happy to help you . May I know which one it is ? 
 Oh , it is conveniently located , isn't it ? 
 I believe it will . It comes furnished . You can move in immediately after the lease is signed . 
 Yes . But not including the utilities . 
 I believe that can be arranged . But there should be a refundable security deposit , you know . 
 I can't believe you wear jeans to the office ! Are you trying to lose your job ? 
 Wow ! Nobody told me about that . Won't the relaxed dress code damage the company image ? 
 I guess it lets people express their individual tastes . But won't some people abuse it ? 
 It seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity . 
 Good morning , Family . We'll have our board meeting this afternoon . Can you write the agenda on the notice board ? 
 We'll talk about the financial report for the first half of the year . 
 We'll also discuss the personnel plan for the second half of the year . 
 Yes . Please write them down on the notice board . I want everybody to see them . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 What ’ s wrong ? 
 Do you have enough money in your checking account ? 
 Give me a moment , and I ’ ll check . 
 You only have $ 57 left in your checking account . 
 I ’ m sorry , but that ’ s what our records show . 
 Would you like anything else ? 
 Here you are , sir . I hope you enjoyed your dinner . 
 Pay me , please . 
 Thank you . The change , sir . 
 Don't be angry , you lose money just to avoid misfortune . 
 Hey , Tom , I want to learn how to play golf . 
 I want to do everything I can . 
 No . Can I rent clubs ? 
 What kinds of clubs ? 
 I'll buy a set . But you have to teach me . 
 Have you ever been to Britain ? 
 Really ? How often do you go there ? 
 Do you always go on business or do you sometimes go for a holiday ? 
 Do you have any other questions ? 
 According to our regulations , you will be on probation for the first three months . 
 In this period , you can only get the basic salary , 2,500 yuan per month . 
 The salary will be deposited into the bank on the 15th every month . Your salary will be raised every year in October , depending on your performance . 
 Yes , you may enjoy a seven-day holiday in the first year . After that , you can have two more days each year . 
 Yes I am . Nice to meet you , Jack . 
 No , I am German . I live in Munich . 
 And did you like it ? 
 And where are you from , Jack ? 
 What are you studying ? 
 Oh , excellent . Why don't we talk in German for a while then ? 
 I haven't finished it . It is very difficult . 
 Oh , I know . I will try my best . 
 Good morning . My name is Mr . Brown . I ’ m from Australia . Here is my card . 
 Pleased to meet you too , Ms . Pewless . I travel a lot every year on business , but this is my first visit to your country . I must say I have been much impressed by your friendly people . 
 Oh , yes . I had a look yesterday . I found some of the exhibits to be fine in quality and beautiful in design . The exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles . I ’ Ve gone over the catalogue and the pamphlets enclosed in your last letter . I ’ Ve got some idea of your exports . I ’ m interested in your silk blouses . 
 There are prescriptions . 
 Thank you ! 
 Jason . There ’ s a snag in the plans for the Hoover Center . 
 Well , it was . But the contractor ’ s just told me he ’ s not going to be able to finish by the twentieth , as planned . 
 My warmest congratulations on your promotion ! 
 Don ’ t say that . It owes to your efforts and team spirit . 
 You are very modest . Best luck in your new position . 
 There ’ s a big sale on clothes and sporting goods at Riverside Mall . 
 Yeah , it ’ s 30 percent off the regular price . 
 Yeah , it ’ s a couple weeks away , and we don ’ t have anything yet . 
 I know , I know , but if I didn ’ t buy it for him , he ’ d never buy it . 
 Well , all shoes are 20 percent off . 
 I know , but another pair can ’ t hurt . 
 Is this the workshop to prepare for an interview ? 
 I am really excited to be taking this workshop so that I can get ready for my interview next week . 
 I think that we should dress neatly and appropriately . 
 Yes , and I always feel much better when I am friendly . 
 Any more hints as to what I should do in an interview ? 
 I've never met anyone like Clyde before . 
 Wow ! There are so many different people here . I expected mostly athletes and rappers . 
 Then I'll just shut up and sit down ! 
 Yes . Can you show me the menu , please ? 
 Then , what's special tonight ? 
 All right . We'll have some seafood and vegetables . 
 Certainly . Can I have the name please ? 
 Ok , Are you checking out tomorrow ? 
 Will you need a wake up call , sir ? 
 Ok then , your room is 502 on the fifth floor . Breakfast is served between 6.30 am and 9am . Enjoy your stay . 
 I'm reading an interesting report on Mars . 
 Absolutely ! It says there is water on Mars buried beneath the surface . It's just a matter of how deep it is . 
 The soil would need quite a bit of fertilizer to grow anything . And it would need to be protected from the UV radiation . 
 I'm not sure NASA has built any portable habitats for extended stays on Mars , but they have looked at various designs . 
 Well , I'm not really an expert in this area , but my understanding is that anything is possible . It's just that it is so hard to determine what went on 4.5 billion years ago . 
 I'm skeptical . Mars is made of rocks containing silicon , iron , and various minerals . It also has an atmosphere of carbon dioxide . It is so different from what we have on earth , you know . 
 But there are still other big problems we need to solve such as prolonged weightlessness , food storage , and a series of physiological effects . 
 Yes , of course I can , Penny . Is there any water in this kettle ? 
 Where ’ s the tea ? 
 I can see the teapot , but I can ’ t see the tea . 
 Ah yes , I can see it now . Where are the cups ? 
 Yes . Here they are . 
 Hi , Mel , would you like to come and have a cup of coffee this afternoon ? 
 I see . Then what about tomorrow , at Starbucks ? 
 Are you kidding me ? Becky ? She ’ s a real bitch . 
 They are beautiful . 
 Of course . I will . 
 Yes . Can I ? 
 Yes . Is it OK with you ? 
 Yes . Do you mind ? 
 Yes . Will you let me ? 
 What can I do for you today ? 
 What do you need to know ? 
 It depends on what you're trying to do with the completion of the course . 
 You're going to need to complete six hours . 
 You can do two hours a day for three days . 
 Yes , that's all you need to do . 
 I would like to make an offer on this house , but I don ’ t know much about the process . 
 I really like the house and will pay the full asking price of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars . 
 That sounds good , but I don ’ t want this house to get away from me . 
 When will we know if they accept the offer ? 
 Should I be contacting my bank in the meantime ? 
 Hi . I ’ m here for flight 513 to New York but I thought I heard the paging system announce that it is canceled . Is that true ? 
 No way ! I worked very hard so that I could leave on today ’ s flight . Are there seats on another airline ? 
 You mean the line over there of about 200 people ? ! 
 This is a rotten way to start a vacation . I HATE lines ! Can you book me on tomorrow ’ s flight ? 
 Most people in Montreal speak French . 
 Only less than 20 percent of the citizens speak English . 
 May I take your order ? 
 OK , here you are . 
 I have no idea . First time here . 
 Oh , it's rice rolls with fried shrimp inside . 
 There are twenty rolls in a bowl . You can get another bowl for free if there aren't enough rolls . 
 OK , shrimp rolls . Do you want anything else ? 
 OK , wait a moment please . 
 It ’ s not my fault . Daniel always sends things flying . 
 Yep . And it breathes , see ! 
 Yes , it is . Look at the little light ! It blinks off and on . 
 I would look so cool carrying this around ! 
 of course I'd come . I couldn't think of a better chance to see all my old friends . 
 how time flies . But hey , how are things going with you ? 
 yeah , Jenny and I got married right after graduation . It was tough the first years trying to make ends meet . I was supporting us both while she continued her studies . But now things are getting better 
 definitely ! Actually , we just moved into a new place . There's a house-warming party this Saturday , if you are free ? I know Jenny would love to see you again and it should be a good party . 
 What do you do besides work and watching TV ? 
 Do you go jogging or do you go to a health club ? 
 How do you exercise ? 
 How often do you go ? 
 How was your job at the state-owned enterprise ? 
 You changed jobs again ? Why do you move so frequently ? 
 Why don't you stick with one job for a bit longer ? 
 How's your current job going ? 
 Excuse me . I've been waiting here for 15 mins . Do you know how often does No . 3 run ? 
 It seems that you have got here at a good time . Do you have a bus schedule ? 
 I see , thank you . 
 May I have a look at that china tea set ? It is extremely beautiful . 
 Jingdezhen ? Oh , I know it . Isn't it called the capital of porcelain ? 
 Oh , it must be very precious . Is it breakable ? 
 How much is it ? 
 Oh , it is beyond my purse . 
 OK ! What can I do for you , Madam ? 
 When do you want me to come ? 
 That's fine . I can make it . 
 It's nothing . It's not the first time anyway . 
 I hope so . 
 That ’ s open secret . 
 How did you know that ? 
 Do you think the weather will be good this weekend ? 
 Oh . That ’ s a pity . I thought that we might go hiking in the hills . 
 Yes that might be a better idea . 
 Ok - let ’ s do that then ! 
 Do you have the latest lipstick from Christian Dior ? 
 Any special colors ? 
 Can I try it on and see how it looks ? 
 Looks good . I'll take it . 
 Hi Angela , it's Dan . 
 Good . 
 Yes , I was taking a shower when you called . I saw that you called and I tried to call you back , but I think your phone was off . 
 Oh , is that next week ? 
 No , of course not . I already bought them a present . 
 Sure . Does she know your friend ? 
 Are we all going to drive together ? 
 What a wonderful party ! I had a good time . How about you ? 
 Shall I give you a ride home ? 
 It's no trouble at all because your house is on the way to my place . 
 Come on , Jenny , we are heading our way to the Opera House . 
 Oh , I am sorry , I thought you were not . 
 Fine . Actually I am a little tired too . Want some water ? 
 Yes , we can have a picnic on the top of the hill . 
 Let me see . We should go to buy some fruit first . 
 How about taking a cantaloupe ? It is light and sweet . Children love it . 
 Yes . Look , cashew , peanuts , assorted biscuits , chocolate , canned goods , anything else ? 
 Definitely beer . Two bottles . 
 Yes . Shall we buy some saucers ? It will be used during our picnic . 
 Let's go to queue up . There are so many people in the lines . 
 Well , I got $ 3,000 per month . 
 Yes , I think so . That would be more than I have wished . 
 What about early next week ? 
 Yes , sir . 
 I ’ m in a bit of a hurry , Louise . Can it wait ? 
 All right . Why don ’ t you have a seat ? What ’ s the problem ? 
 Certainly , which color do you want to dye it ? 
 Right now , many girls are dyeing there hair blond . 
 What do you think about pink ? 
 Yes , we have several brands , which one do you prefer ? 
 First , you need a shampoo , it makes it easier for your hair to be dyed . Let's down your hair in the water , you hair will be fairly clean that way . 
 You hair is definitely fresh and shiner looking . 
 Well , ' Terminator ' is a really great action movie , and I like action movies because they're exciting . 
 It is pretty violent , but since it's just robots fighting one another , it isn't very bloody and so it won't gross you out . 
 I quit my job . 
 Let me get the keys and we ’ ll go to look at it . 
 It ’ s the one you like . 
 Okay . Now we need you to fill a form with your personal information . We need information like social insurance number ( Social security number in the US ) , your address , phone number , etc . We also need a security deposit of $ 200 . And you have to pay two months ’ rent in advance for renting the first time . If there ’ s nothing damaged , we ’ ll give you back one month ’ s rent when you move out . You ’ ll be responsible for all the utilities . Do you want to sign a lease today ? 
 Oh , one more thing I forgot . You must let us know two months in advance if you want to stop renting within the contract . Otherwise , you can ’ t get your deposit back . 
 You ’ re welcome . Be sure to get the keys one day before you move in . 
 Dou you think I should join a basketball team , Mary ? 
 But I'm afraid it will take too much of my time . 
 Em , you ’ re right . 
 Hello , Ms Li , this is Mr Peng . 
 We'll be coming in tomorrow to make a rather large cash withdrawal , it's for payroll . 
 500,000 RIB . Do you need me to give you my account number ? 
 Thanks very much for your help , Li Lan . See you tomorrow . 
 I know what you mean . 
 Yes , he did the same to me . 
 It stops snowing , but there's a bit wind . 
 I missed today's weather for cast in the radio 
 The ice is soon be thick for skating . I'm so fine to want a sport 
 I really dislike reading academic books . 
 Hey , what's new ? 
 Ok , wait a minute ... let's see . I'm a Taurus , and it says , Mars is in the third house , and is soon to eclipse Venus . I don't know what that means , but then it says , Your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking . Remember to be positive . Sounds good to me . 
 Since Mercury has crossed paths with Jupiter , your fortunes are falling . Bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . Be careful . 
 But we have a date tonight ! You can't stay at home because of a stupid horoscope . 
 There are about 20 main spots and some other small spots . 
 Yes , some of the spots charges separately . 
 Yes , sir , it's $ 20 . 
 It's December eighteenth . 
 Yes , I know that . 
 Sure , a promise is a promise . 
 Let's get start . What kinds of things do you have in mind ? If you let us know the requirements you have from the very beginning , we can work through each one until we can come to an agreement . 
 Huh ... I think 7 % is little high that might be hard to do . How about this ? We'll give you a discount of 4 % , but you can have 90 days credits . 
 No , you have to take care of the insurance . But we are willing to pay the half transport . Can you accept that ? 
 But you'll have 90 days to pay your bill and I'll tell you what ... I'll also throw in the discount of 10 % on your up front deposit . 
 Shall I make some coffee , Jane ? 
 It's ready . Do you want any milk ? 
 What about some sugar ? Two teaspoonfuls ? 
 Would you like some more ? 
 Of course . I think there are a few in that box . 
 What a pity ! 
 Have a biscuit instead . Eat more and smoke less ! 
 I can ’ t find my purse . Have you seen it ? 
 I ’ Ve looked everywhere for it . I must have left it somewhere . I hope I haven ’ t lost it . 
 No , I had it when I left school this afternoon . 
 Yes , I ’ d better give her a call now . 
 Perhaps I should call her later . 
 At least , it is better than my boxed lunch at work . I'm so fed up with the bland food . Thank you for having lunch with me ! 
 It's hard to believe that you like it . You are so easy to be satisfied . 
 Eating is important . You are what you eat . It's not only a daily routine . 
 No . I'm going to pay the bill for the company's lunch . 
 Well , the bill is paid by month . That's probably the only thing that I like about a take-out restaurant . 
 For what ? I thought you didn't like western food . 
 That's really smart . My son Daniel is the same with your son . I just don't get it , why all the kids prefer western food to traditional food . 
 That's for sure . It's always hard for the parents to say no to their children . 
 It's $ 120 per yard including a 5 % discount . 
 But if you placed a larger order , we would increase the discount to 10 % . 
 Maybe we would consider a longer credit period . 
 Thanks a lot for having us . We had a good time . 
 Thanks . By the way , tell your wife she throws a great party . 
 Should I go now ? 
 Nothing is happening ! 
 What do these other letters mean ? 
 Honey , I think you should quit smoking . 
 But I want you to be fit . 
 Check out this article . It says smoking can lead to lung cancer . 
 But you know that smoking does harm to health , right ? 
 Stop beating around the bush . Will you quit or not ? 
 The bridegroom looks a bit nervous . 
 Oh , they are playing the wedding March . Here they come . 
 I am so happy for them . 
 Yes , I always cry at weddings . 
 Yes , they are . 
 In fact , we are beginning to make preparations . 
 No , no , for the engagement . 
 These goods can be broken very easily , so we would be thankful if you would be sure to use durable packing materials . 
 Good . Can we ask you to put a country of origin mark on each container ? 
 Do you always put a quality mark on each container ? For this shipment it is crucial to us that you do . 
 Thanks . This shipment is so important to us there cannot be any foul-ups . 
 And I'm the one who put him there with my football moves . 
 Yeah , what was all that stuff about running tests about anyway ? 
 Great , then let's go visit him . I want to give him some flowers , too , to say sorry . 
 Sure , no problem . I'll ring to have a city tour.on sunday morning we can go to the Great Wall , then we can go to the summer palace in the afternoon . In the evening we can have typical dinner in restaurant in Beijing . Quanjude , a restaurant serving roast ducks . However if you don't like above trips , we can go some famous places outside of Beijing . 
 What time shall we start ? 
 Ok , then see you in sunday morning . 
 Well , Mary types faster than Jones . But I think Jones types more carefully . 
 Jones can certainly take down letter more quickly , but Mary ’ s short hand is the best in her class . 
 Both of them speak excellent French . But I think Mary speaks German more fluently than Jones does . 
 Waiter , a table for two , please . 
 Can we see the menu please . 
 What ’ s good today ? 
 We don ’ t want that . Well . perhaps will be begin with mushroom soap and follow by some seafood and chips . 
 no dissert , thanks , just coffee.can I have the check please ? 
 I don't know . I only started looking for a job a few days ago . 
 I've only found a few openings in my field . 
 I'm trying to find a job in sound engineering . 
 unfortunately not . If I can't find anything in the field , then I could also work in the tourism field . 
 yes . 
 really ? what is it ? 
 that's interesting . Do you think they'd hire me ? 
 that's true . I might as well call them up and see if I can get an interview . Do you have the details ? 
 When she told me that she would marry no man but Dick , my heart was almost in my mouth . 
 I could not and can ’ t make out the reason why she would set her heart on a man like Dick . He plays the field with many girls . 
 Did you have any publications ? 
 Have you received any honors ? 
 Have you ever thought about having children , Kaitlyn ? 
 Well , I've always wanted to have lots of children . Growing up with only one brother , I always felt a bit lonely . What do you think about families with only one child ? 
 Don't you think you would miss having other people around ? 
 If China didn't have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ? 
 Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ? 
 Will you be at the family reunion next year ? 
 Have you seen the movie Batwoman ? 
 Yes , it's quite amusing , actually . Good plot , and Sharon Stone's in it . 
 Yeah , but she looks amazing . 
 Well , it's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . But then she got reincarnated as a cat . 
 I know . Stay with me . She then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss . First , though , she had to discover her true cat nature . At the end she had a big fight with Sharon Stone , who was the real danger in the company . She had actually murdered the boss , who was her husband , and then tried to frame Batwoman for the murder , so everyone thought Batwoman was evil . 
 No . Sharon Stone was married to the boss , who treated her badly , so she killed him . So where was I ? OK , so then , at the same time she fell in love with a cop , who was investigating the murder of the boss . Finally , she ditched the cop to follow her feline nature . 
 No , Sharon Stone did . 
 Haven't you been listening to a word I've been saying ? 
 Um ... Actually I am guessing you didn't get the MEMO . Your boss was selected to fill the vacancy in the CEO slot . He actually is the CEO now , or will be , as soon as the official press releases and hoopla is done with . 
 No kidding ! When the last CEO left , we were worried about the future of the company . 
 He is responsible to the board of directors for everything that happens in the company . He or she must give leadership to all company officers , as CEO is also responsible for providing the guidance of philosophy of the company , and acting as official representative , or face of the company . 
 have you moved into your new house yet , Michael ? 
 so , what do you think about the place ? Are you glad that you moved in ? 
 how old is the house then ? 
 sounds fascinating . Where is your new house located ? 
 do you have a big yard ? 
 is your house well-lit ? 
 how many rooms does your house have ? 
 I'd be up for that ! 
 What the magic ward to say if you want something good to happen ? 
 Ok , here you are . 
 Amy , you forgot another magic word . 
 You are very welcome . 
 Yes , speaking . What can I do for you ? 
 Pardon ? Your way of articulating is too slow . Would you speak a little faster ? 
 I have been yearning for a job as a stewardess in an airline like yours . 
 Of course . It's on Memorial Avenue . 
 Right . You know where that is ? 
 Well , do you know where the post office is ? 
 That won't help us . Let me see now ... Why don't you follow this street , Elm , until , you get to the second stoplight . 
 May I take your order now ? 
 Do you want some salad dressing ? 
 We have Italian , French , thousand island and blue cheese . 
 Hi . May I help you ? 
 1.15 U . S . dollars to the euro . 
 Sure . How much would you like to change ? 
 Very good . May I see your passport ? 
 How would you like your bills ? 
 I passed all the tests , Mom . 
 Hello , Beijing Hotel . 
 Sure.How many rooms do you need ? 
 What kind of room ? 
 Smoking or non-smoking ? 
 How many nights will you be staying ? 
 Ok . I just need your name and credit card number to hold the room . 
 Oh ! I feel really under the weather . I ’ Ve got a sore throat and a bad cough . 
 Yes , I ’ Ve had lots of overtime to do recently and I haven ’ t slept much at all . 
 Yes , I think you ’ re right ! 
 You've come to the right store . We've got a beautiful and wide selection of necklaces for you to choose from . 
 Do you mean the exquisite golden necklace ? 
 It costs only two thousand yuan . 
 Yes , it is , and the lustre will never fade out . 
 I can't believe the way our landlord cheated us . 
 Good morning , Angela , how have you been lately ? 
 Well , rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run , sitdown.Coffee ? 
 Haha , I could never do that . I ’ d be a zombie if I didn ’ t have my morning coffee fix . Let ’ s get down to business then . 
 That ’ s great ! I ’ m glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . Right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . Is Pear still interested in having those ? 
 Surely . Let ’ s get started by drafting a new contract . 
 The mangoes are on sale today . 
 They have yellowish red skin . It's a fruit with one big seed . 
 Maybe if you were a parrot . I wouldn't recommend it . 
 Normally , they're $ 2 each . Today , they're only $ 1 each . 
 It's hard to describe . They're sweet , but also sort of citrusy . 
 They're similar to an avocado . When the outside feels soft , they're ripe . 
 These are from Mexico . 
 I'm in the kitchen ... let yourself in ! 
 I know . I've even worked up a sweat . 
 Are you ready to leave ? 
 What are we going to eat for dinner ? 
 I thought you were making dinner tonight . 
 Your food tastes so much better than mine . 
 You really want me to cook tonight ? 
 No problem . 
 Would you like me to come get you when the food is done ? 
 Jenny , what are you going to do tomorrow morning ? 
 I'm thinking of taking you and Peter swimming . What do you think ? 
 But swimming in the winter is good for your body . Believe me . 
 Yeah , I ’ Ve been working so much overtime lately . 
 My boss gave me a big project . I had to have it finished it by this morning . It was so difficult ! 
 I know . But hard work pays off , you know . 
 Maybe now I ’ ll get that promotion I was hoping for . 
 How much is it ? Is three hundred dollars enough ? 
 Oh , you've already grown up , son . 
 Yeah , should we get out and help ? 
 Looks like the one guy lost control in all this rain , and the other one hit him . 
 These accidents always cause traffic jams on rainy days . 
 Ah , well . Put on the news . I got up late and missed it . 
 Susan , can you tell me in a nutshell what the retail market is like in China ? 
 Retail is going upscale here ? China is certainly growing more quickly than I had imagined . 
 Do you think the trend will continue ? 
 Everything I've seen so far is very impressive , very impressive indeed . 
 Who ? 
 Not for a couple of years . What happened to her ? 
 Oh , she is . 
 Not surprising . I bet she's very tall and slim . 
 Excuse me , I want to go to Galion by ship . Is there a ship to Dalian ? 
 What time does it leave ? 
 Could you please tell me about the cabins ? 
 Then where can I catch it ? 
 Thank you . 
 yeah , I quit my job , and started working from home . Recently I've got a project to deal with and don't have much time to work out . 
 it's not about pay raise or promotion . You know , I hate getting up early in the morning and coming back home late at night . 
 yeah , as long as I have a computer and internet access , I can start working . I recently enjoy working in my own place and at my own pace . 
 absolutely . I can decide when and what to do all by myself . 
 yeah , I can find enough online . 
 thank you for reminding me . I'll continue to exercise as soon as I finish this project . 
 What are you planning on cooking ? 
 If you plan on eating , you are . 
 What do you feel like having ? 
 That sounds really good . 
 I have no plans on cooking tonight . 
 I knew that already . 
 It's a surprise ! 
 Yes . Let's go inside and you can open it up . 
 I'll give you two clues . First , it cost more than $ 250 . And second , it's not big , but fat . 
 Well Mr . Black , I appreciate your interest in our company , but I doubt you can do this job properly . 
 I wish I could . But you even don ’ t have a B . A , so I ’ m sorry to say there ’ s no chance . 
 Mr . Black , I don ’ t think my boss will talk to you . It ’ s a Chinaman ’ s chance . 
 I went bungee jumping yesterday . 
 Could you do something to advance your shipment ? 
 We expect the goods to be on the market before the end of December to catch up with the Spring Festival sales . 
 I understand your feeling . When someone is feeling at loose ends , we may show mercy on him . This is what we call the " milk of human kindness " . 
 You've take the words out of my mouth . 
 Hi , An . How are you ? 
 I am afraid I can ’ t this afternoon . I take my daughter to her tennis class at the club on Wednesday afternoons . 
 Ok , I'll meet you at the club at two thirty . 
 I'm sorry . 
 It can't be that bad . 
 At least the subway is better than the bus . It's faster for one thing . And usually less crowded . But the drawback is that the subway is more expensive than the bus . It adds up over time , if you take it every day . 
 I ride my bike . I don't live too far away , so it's pretty convenient . it's only about a ten minute bike ride from my house to the office . 
 Yes , not only a good way to keep in shape , but a good way to relieve stress as well . While you're stressed out by your commute , I'm releasing all the stress of the day with mine . 
 Your company has a very good reputation , and I have been planning to visit it for a long time . What's the advantage of your factory over other plastics ones ? 
 Could you tell me the cost of production per unit ? 
 Have you ever worked as a tour guide ? 
 Then you may know that it's hard work . 
 Have you applied with any other companies ? 
 Is there anything you want to ask about ? 
 Certainly . There'll be a good chance of that if you work for this company . Not right away , of course , but in a few years , after you learn more about our business , you may go overseas with a tour group . Any questions ? 
 All right , then . We'll get in touch with you within a week . Thank you for coming today , Mr . Sun . 
 Good-bye . 
 I'd like to buy a ticket for New York . 
 Round trip . 
 When does the next plane leave ? 
 I'd like a ticket for that flight please . 
 Coach . 
 How about the one after that ? 
 Yes , please . 
 OK . 
 Be careful.The floor is slippery . 
 Turn on the shower . 
 Ok . I'll check the heater . Dry yourself with the towel first . 
 Thank you ! 
 Yeah . I'm lucky to be his wife . 
 So he will make a perfect husband . Make sure you will be here next Monday . 
 Peter and Mary broke up . 
 You ’ re working hard , George . What are you doing ? 
 Which hammer . This one ? 
 Here you are . 
 What are you going to do now , George ? 
 What colour are you going to paint it ? 
 Pink ! 
 I think that I would enjoy living here , but I would like to make improvements . 
 I think that it would look better with a better quality carpet . 
 How much more would it cost to upgrade ? 
 Do you think that I could have a different paint color in my apartment ? 
 How long will it take for my new apartment to be ready ? 
 alright , tell me what you think . 
 yeah , maybe you ’ re right . How about this outfit ? 
 no , I don't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just had to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It ’ s casual , yet sophisticated . 
 how about this scarf , these earrings , and an anklet ? 
 that ’ s a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense . 
 yep . Here it is . What do you think ? 
 the leopard print sounds fabulous . Are they a name brand ? 
 that ’ s even better than the real thing . 
 it ’ s too bad I did all that shopping yesterday ! 
 Take the No . 7 bus . There's a bus stop just over there . 
 Yes . No need to change . 
 It depends what it is . Once we have disconnected the unit , we do as many jobs as we can . If there is something that isn't broken but might cause a problem before the next service then of course we repair it or replace that part . But if it's not urgent , we make a note in the service record to carry out that repair next time . 
 It is green . Come upstairs and see it . 
 Look ! Here it is ! 
 My hat ’ s new , too . 
 It ’ s the same color . It ’ s green , too . 
 One family skeleton of my family was that my younger brother has an axe to grind . 
 He began to be interested in finance because he thought he would be able to inherit the family ’ s fortune . 
 Hi , Sue . What's up ? 
 Ok , I guess . My boss has been on my back recently . 
 You know , just giving me lots to do . I'm really busy right now . 
 Oh , lots of things . Mostly training new people . 
 You are in luck . We just receive a shipment of several different styles of white purses . 
 Yes , I believe they are . Here are something that might interest you . 
 Sure . Let me ring this up for you at the register . If you would like , this can be gift-wrapped for free . Just take it to the customer service department . 
 Good evening . We've a reservation for a table for four . My name is Tim . 
 But there is a change in the number of people . There are seven of us . Three of my friends are coming soon . 
 Well , it's a window table that we've booked . 
 Oh , I see . We'll have to make up with the center one . 
 If a Mr . Wu comes to look for me , just take him here . 
 Welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you ? 
 Well , there certainly are many benefits that go along with our credit card . 
 You know it is not necessary to pay the balance in full every month . 
 Yes , you will see on your monthly bill and statement the amount in full but also the minimum payment . 
 Yes . As long as you keep making regular monthly payments , paying the minimum is just fine . Of course , your credit limit will be lowered accordingly . 
 For example , if your credit limit is 5,000 RIB and you owe 1,000 RIB , your available credit will be 4,000 RIB . So , your credit limit drops . 
 Hello , how are you today . Here for your six month check-up ? 
 Oh , fine . Let's take a look . 
 Okay , I'll do that , but my crown was just put on last year . Will my dental insurance cover the work ? 
 Thanks , doctor . 
 I ’ m fine , thank you . 
 If I could , I would like to view the apartment sometime today . 
 Why is that ? 
 I would like to make one right now if I can . 
 Can we do it at 6 o ’ clock ? 
 All right . I ’ ll see you on Friday . 
 Really ? OK ! 
 Very comfortable . I think I will come next time . Maybe I will take some friends . Amazing ! 
 I want some envelopes please . 
 The large size please . Do Have you any writing-paper ? 
 Yes , please . And I want some glue . 
 And I want a large box of chalk , too . 
 No , thank you . 
 That's all , thank you . 
 I want my change . 
 Walk down this road , take the fourth turn to the right.Then you'll see it . 
 No . It's only about five minutes ' walk . 
 Not at all . 
 Yes , I would like to exchange some money . 
 I would like to exchange Chinese RIB for American dollars . Do you accept $ 100 bills ? 
 Well , that depends on the rate . How much is the RIB trading at today ? 
 I guess , here , give me 5,000 RIB worth . I might as well exchange a little extra . Who knows what the exchange rate will be tomorrow ! 
 When ? I saw him well last month . 
 How terrible ! 
 To speak frankly , it doesn't depend on me . 
 I really want to obtain a permanent job . I won't leave as long as I have opportunity to apply my knowledge and get on well with my superiors and colleagues . 
 I know that generally it is possible to move from this position to a management position with two years experience in the company 
 Well , I remember walking pass the baker shop . 
 I'm afraid so . I don't remember you telling me about it . 
 What would you let me do now ? 
 Really ? You are so kind . 
 No . That's not enough . I've got some cereal . 
 All I need is your name , phone , and reservation date . 
 Randolph , Rudy . Let me hit one button , sir , and now your reservation is cancelled . 
 It's been my pleasure to help you . 
 Sure . Do you want to have the car washed ? 
 You can pick it up in half an hour . By the way , how are you going to pay , cash or credit ? 
 Hey , Dora ! What kind of books do you like to read ? 
 I hate to tell you this , but they are nothing but sob stories . 
 I'm fond of history books . 
 It's a perfect day for swimming . 
 Great ! I love swimming . Besides , I need a tan for Hill ’ s party .. 
 No . Thanks for reminding me . 
 Good afternoon , Mr . Black . Thank you very much . 
 As you please . I ’ m ready . 
 I think yours is a well-known advertising company , so I ’ m sure to get opportunities to display my talent in advertisement . 
 Well , the company has some financial problems . People there are all thinking of quitting . 
 One week after I have submitted my resignation paper . 
 Thank you , sir . 
 Yes , speaking . 
 Can you speak a little louder ? You sound very indistinct with the hissing noise . 
 May I help you ? 
 What ’ s your problem ? 
 I apologize for the inconvenience . 
 I understand your problem . 
 I ’ m going to cancel the fees you owe . 
 The initial fee still must be paid . 
 Man , they take a lot of our paycheck . 
 Seriously . The only tax I don ’ t mind them taking is social security . It ’ s only a few dollars every paycheck . 
 Yeah . It won ’ t be much , but at least we ’ ll have a monthly check when we get old . 
 Let ’ s just hope the politicians don ’ t figure out a way to spend it . 
 I am thinking about resigning from my current job . 
 Yes , I have been thinking about it for quite a while . Now I finally make up my mind to leave . I have given my resignation letter to our boss last Friday . 
 Yes , I will move on to XYZ Company .

 We directly attribute an increase in our customer service feedback of 50 % to the increase in language skills and training that our employees have received . 
 Thank you , but I cannot take all the credit . Our employees have all worked very hard to increase their productivity level . 
 Yes , I should get there just in time for the women ’ s 400m relay . 
 Yes , I ’ m also going to watch the triple jump and the high jump . 
 Ok , I ’ ll try my best . 
 Yes . We're satisfied with the result . 
 Hello . I need to speak with Allan Cartwright . 
 I certainly hope so , I am about to stop doing business with your office . 
 I have an issue . 
 There is a leaking pipe in my wall . 
 There is mildew . 
 Why can ’ t I call someone to fix it today ? 
 I need it done today . 
 Are you okay with me calling a plumber ? 
 So how far is the museum , dad ? 
 Finish your hot chocolate and we will go . 
 No , we will have lunch at the museum cafeteria . 
 Let's go then . On the way we have to turn right and right again at the next junction . 
 Can you see a Post Office somewhere around here ? 
 Oh good we are almost there . The museum is round the corner from the Post Office . 
 Yes , I like collecting things . 
 Several things , for example , Very coins , stamps , stones and so on . 
 Yes , stones . 
 Well , Mitzuko-san , I hope you like it here . This is my favourite restaurant in Taipei . It reminds me of my youth when I traveled around Europe . 
 The chef trained in Florence . The pasta is very good here . 
 Hum ... You should try the mushroom fettucine . It's really good . 
 Not at all . It has a very delicate flavor . 
 Oh , that means soup of the day . I'll ask the waiter what they have today . Have you tried mussels cooked the Italian way ? They're really delicious . 
 Should we tip ? This service is pretty good . 
 How about 10 percent ? That's about 6 dollars . 
 Oh , no . Charlie , where is my purse ? 
 Yes , I did . I lost it . It disappeared . 
 I had it when I left the house . I had it when we start to get the hotdog . 
 The woman was beaten again . Why didn ’ t she call the police . 
 It is incredible . 
 What do you want ? 
 Do you want something to drink ? 
 OK . Sit down and I'll get it . 
 Yes , Ms . Rodriguez ? How can I help you ? 
 Absolutely . I ’ Ve been wanting to meet with you about that . Let me just get my book . 
 Yes , I hope so . I would like to register for Comp Lit 287 . 
 I know . I already tried to register for it by phone , but the computer won't let me . 
 But I'm a new student here . I thought maybe there was some way I could get into the class . I thought I should come and talk to you in the department office . 
 My name is Karen Huang . That's spelled H - U - A - N - G . 
 I'm a comparative literature major . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 That's why I'm trying to get into Comp Lit 287 . I know it's a required class.And Professor Cohen told me I need to take it . 
 Even if the class is full ? 
 Oh , I didn't know that . 
 Thank you . So you think I will be able to get in with this ? 
 Thanks . 
 Hi ! It's still seven o'clock . Are you crazy ? 
 Every time when you glimpse some stylish clothes , you change into another person . 
 No wonder you are named shopaholic . 
 Wait a moment . And you can check where other sales are . 
 Yes , speaking . 
 Hold on a minute please . I ’ ll have my assistant check that part . 
 I want to buy a hat . 
 Is this one fit for you ? It is nice . 
 How about this one ? 
 You must like this pink one , don't you ? 
 Fifty yuan . 
 How about forty-five ? 
 OK . 
 I got a sandwich , some chips , and a soda . 
 I got it from the cafeteria . 
 They messed up my order and gave me a bologna sandwich . 
 Considering it wasn't what I ordered , it was still pretty good . 
 Really ? 
 My accountant thinks she can save me lots of money on my taxes this year . 
 How's it going ? 
 Never better , thanks . 
 I've actually been pretty good . You ? 
 Which school do you attend ? 
 Are you enjoying it there ? 
 Good luck with that . 
 Were you late for work this morning ? 
 What did you say to your boss ? 
 Your boss was really nice . 
 You like movies ? 
 What type do you like the best ? 
 I see . I generally like movies to help calm me down . I think a sign of a good movie is the ability to bring you into the story as if you were part of it . 
 True . The movie industry is becoming more and more commercial . You see a lot of expensive movies with little artistic value . I generally think those made in the forties are of higher quality on the average than movies today . You can name a lot of classics from that decade . 
 I'm totally with you on that . 
 First we will go to the city centre and stop for something to drink . Then we will visit the University Museum . 
 There is a coffee shop round the corner . Can you see that big building at the end of the road ? 
 That is a bank . The coffee shop is opposite the bank . 
 A stop ! Wait for the lights to turn green . 
 Sorry . How far is the museum ? 
 Here we are . You find us a table and I'll get the drinks . 
 To some extent , he is . And what do you think we move to a better place ? I can't see him clearly from here . 
 Oh , thank you for pointing that out . By the way , have you been following NBA for this season ? 
 Who plays who ? 
 It's amazing . And when did he begin to play in the NBA ? 
 I can't consider you as a little kid any more . I know he is very tall . 
 I also heard if a player has committed 5 fouls then he must be out of the game . 
 That's really terrible . Oh , God , we forgot to cheer for Daddy . 
 You are always so naughty . 
 Yes , Mr . Emory . Thank you . 
 We ’ re planning a June wedding , but we haven ’ t picked a date yet . 
 Yes . Fill it up , please . 
 Regular , please . 
 Yes , please . 
 It's so faraway . 
 $ 120 ? ! Then I should go and see what I can get ... 
 Well , on weekdays I get up around ten . Then I read the paper for an hour and have lunch at about noon . 
 I start work at three . 
 I get home pretty late , around midnight . 
 I'm a TV announcer . Don't you recognize me ? I do the weather report on KNT ! 
 Henry married Rose only after her father's money , didn't he ? 
 But he seems to be very happy with Rose . 
 I'm having problems with my computer . 
 For some reason it won't turn on . 
 What connections ? 
 Will the cords keep it from turning on ? 
 I didn't think of that . 
 I think that I will , thanks . 
 I often see some ' new age people ' show off their various skills to handle a skateboard , which makes me wonder in awe . 
 Although it is easy to ride , the condition of the road surface should also be paid attention to , such as places being put together and full of gullies . If the condition permits , it is better to be equipped with helmet , eye shades , ankle shield , knee shield and elbow shield . 
 Look , the aliens are sending a message to Mulder . This rocks ! 
 You have a pager ? ! That's a little high-tech for you , Stu . Are you sure you know how to use it ? 
 No , you don't ! It's still beeping ! Come on , hand it over and I'll turn it off for you . 
 Sports . 
 Basketball and swimming . 
 Let me see . The bell-bottom pants are $ 90 and the coat is $ 120 . It comes to $ 210 . 
 I am sorry . It's a one-price shop . 
 I ’ m looking forward to seeing Westminster abbey , where many historic figures are buried , like Isaac Newton , the great mathematician and Winston Churchill , the great wartime leader . 
 Women have often played an important role in british history . Queen Elizabeth I built a navy strong enough to fight off the Spanish armada in 1588 . more recently , Margaret thatcher transformed british 
 There ’ s a lot to see there . Perhaps we should go tomorrow . 
 I ’ Ve seen them before . They ’ re quite incredible . If you want to see historical figures in London , there ’ s one place you have to go . 
 There you can see british leaders , entertainers , criminals , and royalty . 
 I would like to book a table for 2 . 
 7:00 tonight and we'd like a smoking table . 
 I'm afraid I can't complete my paper on time . 
 I keep on meeting with difficulties in the experiment . I can hardly go on . 
 Let ’ s meet before next week ’ s meeting , Jane . I want to kick around some ideas with you . 
 Well , let ’ s plan to get together next Monday afternoon , around three ? 
 Bob , would you come and help me ? 
 Could you hold these packages while I look for the key ? 
 Just things we need for the picnic tomorrow . 
 I'm sorry , but I just can't find the key . You must have it . 
 OK . I'd like to have everything gift-wrapped , please . 
 Is it on this floor ? 
 Thank you . 
 You , too . Thanks for your help . 
 No . That's not why I raised my hand . I need to go to the ladies ' room . 
 What's a hall pass ? 
 I see . 
 Or else I'll get into trouble . 
 I found a great school for Junior ! 
 We can't be too cautious about these things . 
 There is a huge slide on the playground and lots of trees and even a little brook ! 
 There is a library right inside the front door . 
 What did you say ? 
 Then he become angry with you ? 
 An idea about killing time on a train ? 
 But there's quite a lot of rumors about it . 
 OK , Allen . It's your turn . Are you ready ? 
 Come on ! In the two hours we've been here you haven't sung even one song ! 
 Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis song for him . He loves " The King . " 
 Have you heard about Anlesen David ? 
 No , they got engaged . 
 Well , my dear . I didn't believe either . But got it straight form the horse's mouth . David called me this morning . 
 Last weekend , while they were on the Sik trip . 
 Next June . 
 Hi ! Can I help you ? 
 What's your name , sir ? 
 Yes , sir . We have your reservation . Could you fill out these forms , please ? 
 Yes , sir . That's correct . How will you pay your bill , cash or credit card ? 
 Thank you , sir . You'll be staying in room 1910 . Here are your keys . The bellhop will take your luggage upstairs . Have a nice stay , sir . 
 Show us our itineraries , please . 
 How long will the trip take ? 
 I don ’ t dare to look after the children now . 
 The children always make themselves in danger . I always have my heart in my mouth with them . 
 I've enjoyed conversing with you . 
 I've got to go . 
 I have to do some things , and besides , it's not polite to be nosey . 
 I really don't think it's any of your business . 
 I apologize , but I'm getting off the phone now . 
 Welcome . What can I do for you , Madam ? 
 That's terrible . Unfortunately , we don't have that many branches outside the centre of town . What I'd advise you to do is set up a Direct Debit Service . 
 A Direct Debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account , no fuss , no hassle . 
 We set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . They tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account . Of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies . 
 How old are you ? 
 I'm older than you ! I'll be ten on April 14th . 
 Maybe . I'll have to ask my mother . 
 yeah , almost . But there is one thing . 
 I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people . I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China , but ... 
 some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others . 
 yeah . we never do that in a public office . 
 i have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding . 
 just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ? 
 Oh , I'm shocked . 
 Here you go . 
 No , I don't think so . 
 There must be a mistake . 
 Wait , can you check these sunglasses I bought it in the second floor . I think they forgot to demagnetize it . 
 Of course I did . Here is the receipt . 
 That's all right . 
 In a second . Have you got a torch ? 
 Here it is . Let's go . 
 Yes ? 
 All right . But tell him I will only be here until four o'clock . 
 Good afternoon ! Sit down , please.How are you ? 
 Very well too , thank you very much.Isn ' t it a lovely day ? 
 Yes . 
 Mm ... It's quite warm now . 
 In London.Where do you live ? 
 Hello . This is Dr . Galas Office . Can I help you ? 
 Sure . Let me check his schedule . How about tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 ? 
 I ’ m sorry . Dr . Galas is fully engaged tomorrow morning . How about the day after tomorrow at 9:30 in the morning ? 
 You ’ re welcome . Could I have your name and phone number , please ? 
 Very good , Ms . Smith . I have scheduled an appointment for you on Wednesday at 9:30 am . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Yes . Right now I have a studio . 
 In the downtown , near the square . 
 Yes , and the rent includes utilities . 
 What about next saturday . 
 We are sorry for our fault . 
 Thank you for your understanding . 
 Really ? Let me check it . 
 No , ma'am . I ’ m afraid you put in only one quarter and one dime . 
 The significance of understanding the nuance and distinctions of foreign customs and business practices are a continual challenge for global entrepreneurs and trader . Despite many countries accession to TO membership , trade and investment frictions are still predominant among existing membership . However , these frictions will be better managed under the TO trade rules and the organization's dispute settlement mechanism . 
 Problem and disputes occur mainly due to difference in the laws of countries involved . For this very reason , it is imperative to establish from the outset which law governs when disputes arise . The most fundamental principle of all international contracts is the applicable laws and regulations . Make sure that the arbitration clause in your business contract be all-inclusive . 
 Yes , it will be your utmost interest to protect your intellectual property such as your innovations , idea , designs and copyrights in your target country . 
 The lack of regulatory transparency was a problem and still is to some extent . However , the countries are moving forward to deepen their reforms , new changes will involve the establisher of legal structures to sustain high levels of foreign as well a domestic private investments . This will surely strengthen the law and regulations in the countries , especially , areas related to trade issues . 
 Precisely , the actions the countries have committed to take are consistent with TO agreement . 
 No . I have nothing . 
 Yes , they are . 
 OK . 
 We have the offer ready for you . Let me see ... here it is . 100 cases Houston Bristles , 57 mm , at 10 pounds sterling per kilogram , C . I . F European Main Ports , for shipment in June 2001 . The offer is valid for five days . 
 I ’ m a little surprised to hear you say that . You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere . 
 But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US ’ s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries . 
 There ’ s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ’ s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price . 
 I don ’ t know why I married him . 
 He never see eye to eye with me . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Well , you heard right.You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here.We have great discounts for students . 
 Well , first let's consider your computer.Here , for example , is a system I highly recommend--the Power Macintosh G3.It comes with 64 megabytes of total memory . 
 Yes , it is . It should be enough for any student needs you might have.What department are you in ? 
 Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers . I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing.We can talk about software later . Let's talk about your 
 Yes . 
 Yes . It's an excellent system . 
 Yes , it's a Macintosh . It's Apple . Macintosh and Apple are the same thing . 
 I'm sorry , but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment . 
 Yes . 
 That's not true.Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh.They find it is better for writing and word-processing , and that is what students mostly do . Ma 
 Well , I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular.But here in America , especially in universities and publishing companies , Apple is very commonly used . 
 There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh.Chinese is no problem for Apple . 
 No , don't be sorry . It's reasonable to ask your friends.But believe me , most of the students here in the university--Asian students included--most of them use Apple . 
 You're very welcome . Here is my card , if you need any help . 
 Yes . Who is speaking ? 
 Oh , Kelly , I couldn't recognize your voice . Well , I'm fine . 
 Excuse me , I couldn't quite hear you . This line is crossed . Can you speak louder , please ? 
 Much better . I will definitely go to the airport to meet you . 
 Goodbye . 
 Ms Ling ! It's Mr Gwent , from Montgomery Computers . 
 Some money has been sent from our Head Office in Berlin . Could you check whether you have received the remittance yet ? 
 Deutsche Bank . It was 25,000 US dollars . 
 My wife gave birth to our first child today . 
 Did you even bother to go to school today ? 
 No , I didn't feel like it . 
 No , but that was a random change of subject . 
 I haven't lately . 
 So then , why don't you just go ? 
 Okay , so are you going to school tomorrow ? 
 It's said you will go abroad to pursue your graduate studies . 
 Which country do you want to go to ? 
 Were I in your position , I ’ d go to America . 
 There are many universities for you to choose from . Some famous universities such as Harvard , Yale , the University of Michigan , and Massachusetts Institute of Technology are really wonderful places to study , but they are very competitive and expensive . Some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper . 
 Hi , I ’ m Ray , your tenant in Room 209 . 
 There ’ re some problems in my apartment . First , the faucet in the bathtub drips constantly . 
 One of the burners on the stove doesn ’ t work . 
 I can ’ t control the temperature . 
 Well , there ’ s one more thing . The telephone is dead . 
 Okay . Thank you very much . 
 Medicine Industry , this is Peter Bush speaking , can I help you ? 
 May I know who's calling ? 
 I'm sorry , Mrs Li , Mr Brown is now in a meeting.May I have your number , and ask him to call you back later ? 
 Ok , then would you please hold the line ? Mr Li , the line is through , Mr Brown is ready answering the call , go ahead . 
 You are welcome . 
 I'm watching TV . 
 Tingling is on TV . 
 Channel 8 . 
 I'd like to check in , PLS . 
 But I ’ Ve reserved a room the day before yesterday . 
 Tony Bush . 
 Of course , I did it myself . 
 Don't worry about that . 
 Yes , that's right . I'd like to pay my bill by credit card . 
 Here you are . 
 All right . 
 I really like the apartment , but I was wondering if I could change some things . 
 I would like to have different carpet . 
 How much more would it cost ? 
 While I am at it , would it be possible to switch paint colors ? 
 When can my apartment be painted and ready to go ? 
 Waitress , can I have the bill , please ? 
 Do you accept credit cards ? 
 Master card . Here you go . 
 You have to finish your dinner before you leave the table . 
 What's the matter ? It doesn't taste good ? 
 There's a car waiting for you just outside the door . Right this way , please . 
 Let me put your cases into the trunk and please get in the back . 
 How was your flight ? 
 We'll reach the Beijing hotel in another ten minutes . When we arrived there , you can go up and have a rest . The hotel has very good service , and it's considered as one of the best hotels here . 
 If it's convenient for you , Mr . Wu would like to invite you to the banquet in honor of you in the evening . 
 At six o'clock in the International Hotel . We'll pick you up this afternoon . Besides , if you care for visiting , we'll arrange some sightseeing for you . 
 Tom , it's time for you to go to bed . 
 Good night . 
 That looks good . The room in the picture is bigger than your bedroom , so you wouldn ’ t be able to have all that furniture in your room . 
 You would fit both of them in your bedroom . Perhaps you could also get the dressing table . I think that one would look good in your bedroom . 
 Everything in this magazine seems expensive . You could probably find something similar in a discount store . 
 You can get cheap carpets easily . Another idea is to buy a rug . That would cover a lot of the carpet and you wouldn ’ t have to replace the carpet . It would save you a lot of work . 
 Did you make it to school today ? 
 No , I didn't . 
 That was an odd change of subject . 
 No , not recently . 
 What's stopping you then ? 
 So , will you be at school tomorrow ? 
 Could you arrange me to see Doctor John tomorrow morning ? 
 How about 1:30 ? 
 Welcome to IBA . How can I help you ? 
 Oh , yes . I remember . You must be Mr Xie . It's nice to put a face to a voice . 
 JD185649000023 ? Yes , found it . 175,000 Euros , is that correct ? JD185649000023 ? 
 Yes , you can . Just wait a moment and I'll do that for you now . 
 What brings you to Beijing ? 
 Have you seen the sales report for last quarter ? Who do you think is our digest threat ? 
 Le'Ban is the new kid on the block , it's amazing they've had such tremendous success so soon ... With them on the scene , the competition is outthrough . 
 Thanks , this will be a big help in putting together next quarter's marketing strategies . With competition this intense , we'll have to step up production even more . We need a price we can compete with . 
 Better start swimming ! we've got to find a way to outsmart the other guys . I want a preliminarily strategic marketing plan on my desk by next Tuesday ... the competition never sleeps and neither should we . 
 Where did you say ? 
 Right . 
 I have been a Production Manager . 
 3 years . 
 I had introduced an advanced product line , which increased the output and lessened the cost . 
 Frankly speaking , three . If your company employs me , it will be my fourth . 
 Yes . I was awarded the title of Advanced Worker last year . 
 Although I could not say that everything is perfect there , I still very much appreciate what the company has given me , especial many chances . 
 They would say I am a responsible friend and a capable colleague . 
 Yes , I have brought them with me . Here they are . 
 I think that you have covered all the important points already.But if I have any questions later I will contact you . 
 No.thanks . I'm full . 
 It ’ s my job . What can I help you with ? 
 In what room is this pipe ? 
 When did the pipe start leaking ? 
 I will need to tear down that wall to fix that pipe . 
 You ’ re fine with that ? 
 Okay . I will begin working on it now , if you ’ d like . 
 For a batch of 6,000 we would charge two dollars a doll . your total cost would be $ 12,000 . 
 Well , we ’ d like to work with you . If you ordered a larger quantity we could drop the price a little . Can you increase your order to 15,000 ? 
 For order of 12,000 or more we charge only $ 1.5 a doll . your total cost would be $ 18,000 . 
 We do value your business . I think I can offer a further discount – say 5 % ? 
 May I help you ? 
 Yes . Our bank is authorized to deal with foreign exchange . 
 We can change only three kinds of currency , USD , Japanese Yen and HK Dollar in our savings office . 
 The buying rate is 826 . 44 yuan for 100 dollars . 
 Please go to Counter No . 2 , the foreign exchange counter . It's over there . 
 Can you hold the end of this tape measure ? 
 I ' m taking some measurements for new curtains . 
 I thought we'll just fix up the wood floor.and use some paint for the walls . 
 Tomorrow we'll go and pick out some curtains and paint . 
 That's a good idea.What time is good for you ? 
 Sounds good . 
 I don't think I'm going to get one . 
 It's just a waste of cash , man ! 
 Oh , really ? 
 Really ? 
 That sounds like a good deal . 
 I will . 
 I'm going to graduate this summer . 
 I'm planning to return to China after graduation . 
 Well , I think personal development is much more important than simply having a superior living environment . 
 Will you send the letter to the chairman of the committee ? 
 Thank you , Mr . White . 
 Hello . This is Mrs . Wilson . I'd like to buy a new car . Could you offer me a new type of the car , please ? 
 A new car . And I've got a small family , two children , and I haven't got a lot of money and ... 
 Isn't this the car store ? 
 Oh , sorry . Do you know the number for a car store , then ? 
 I'm sorry to have bothered you . 
 There's a big problem with my room . I'm in 507 . 
 I have cockroaches crawling in my room . 
 I've seen nine more cockroaches than I wanted to see . 
 How dare you question my statement ! 
 May I take your order ? 
 Anything else ? 
 No problem , sir . 
 Wait a minute . I am really sorry but I can't find it now . 
 Maybe , what shall I do now ? 
 Well , I think that's the only thing I can do . 
 I ’ Ve got all the presents I need , and my family is working together to get all the food ready . That ’ s easy ; but I have another problem to deal with . 
 No , I did that a long time ago . It ’ s about telling my son the truth about Santa Claus . 
 Yes . He ’ s never said anything so I never told him . But now that he ’ s getting older ... 
 Yes , he ’ s too old to believe in that type of things . And I ’ d rather tell him before the kids at school do . 
 I can understand . I was lucky with my oldest ; she figured it out by herself and didn ’ t tell my son . 
 Is Stanley still singing that Elvis song ? He's really hogging the mike ! 
 He sounds like a sick cow ! 
 I already tried that . Nothing seems to help . 
 What do you feel like eating this morning ? 
 The most important meal of the day is breakfast . 
 You can always make an easy breakfast . 
 All I make is oatmeal , toast , and some orange juice . 
 I like it , and it's a fast meal . 
 I can make it for you if you like . 
 Would you please wrap the shoes first ? I would like to buy a sweater . 
 How much does the green one cost ? 
 OK . I will take it as well . How much in all ? 
 Ok , here you are . 
 No , I don't . 
 Yes , I have two cotton of cigarettes one bottle of whisky . 
 No , this is the medicine for the stomach . 
 Yes , Sir , go ahead , here you are . 
 How can I ? They're as alike as two peas in a pod . 
 You really have keen eyes . 
 Why , that's very kind of you , Mrs . Johnson . I'm sure my wife will be glad to . 
 Tomorrow afternoon would be fine . 
 I am happy that we ’ Ve finally cleared up some problems . 
 No . That's all , I guess . 
 All right . See you later . 
 Hi , there ’ s a problem with this stereo . I ’ d like to return it , please . 
 The tape player doesn ’ t work . 
 Yes , here you are . 
 I think I ’ d like to just get another stereo , please . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Do you think Mr . Johnson is a good worker ? 
 Haven't you ever seen him working late ? 
 Hi Joe . You've met my new assistant , right ? 
 You are kidding , but she's so helpful . 
 Come on . She's like that with everyone . 
 Look ! Allen has the mike ! 
 That was before he heard Stanley sing ! I guess he couldn't stand it anymore , so he decided to give it a try himself ! Allen has a really good voice ! He sounds like Enrique Iglesias ! 
 Just dab it all over your face and then take a look at the symbols that appear . 
 Those are money bags , and they represent your financial situation . 
 That's Madame Psychic to you . 
 Well , you have three hearts — lucky in love tonight . Dress up and go on a date ! 
 Yes , I did . But I feel tired today . 
 Well , on Saturday I cleaned the house and played tennis . Then on Sunday I hiked in the country . 
 Yeah . I studied on Sunday evening . What about you ? 
 That sounds like fun , but did you exercise ? 
 I'd like to return this radio . 
 I lost it . 
 But I purchased it yesterday . 
 Well , that's a start , I guess . 
 That sounds good . I'll take the escalator . 
 What's your new girlfriend like ? 
 Does she know how to speak Spanish ? 
 Wow ! ! ! 
 That's terrific ! 
 What's that ? 
 Excuse me , is there a table for 8 right now ? 
 Well , since there are some small square tables , could we put two tables together ? 
 We are approaching the top of the mountain . 
 Yes , you can have a bird's-eye view of the whole city . 
 Of course . We will stay there for half an hour and you can do your own business . 
 I would like to open a Current Account , please . 
 That's great , here you are . This is my passport . 
 Oh , yes . May I sit on the grass ? 
 Yes , I can see it . But what's on it ? 
 Well , there's a bench under the tree . We can sit there . 
 Why not ? 
 Can I help you ? 
 These books over here are about ancient history . They might be helpful . 
 I ’ m sorry . It ’ s for reference only , so it must stay in the library . But you ’ re welcome to look through it . 
 All right . They ’ re due back next Wednesday . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Yes , it ’ s this summer ’ s best-seller . 
 We provide free delivery and installation . 
 It is two-year and covers parts and service . 
 Can you connect me to Mary . Smith Hotel room ? 
 Can you leave a message for her to call her office ? 
 Good morning , Mr.Jones ! 
 Nice to see you again . 
 How is everything ? 
 Quite well , thank you . 
 No , I was driven by my husband . 
 Yes , thanks .

 Here's 20 yuan , keep the change . 
 What would you like to drink ? 
 Forget about the coke . Let's drink some wine , shall we ? 
 What would you prefer ? Red wine or white ? 
 Are you okay , man ? You don ’ t look very well . 
 Nice ! So , where did you guys go ? 
 Oh no ! Mike ’ s birthday is a drinkfest for sure ! 
 Is that why you missed work today ? 
 Www ! 
 Too bad man , tonight is Tracy ’ s going away party and she asked if you were gonna go . 
 Are there any scenic spots nearby ? 
 Have you ever been there ? 
 Really ? 
 Do you have any tissue , Eve ? I've used all mine . 
 Thanks . I am all right . It's just my nose . It must be an allergy . Do you have any aspirin ? I have a terrible headache . 
 No , no . I am okay . It's the weather . It was warm and sunny this morning and now it's chilly and raining . 
 I can't . I am already behind the schedule . Besides , you know Mr . White . He would think that I was putting him on . 
 Do I ? Oh , no . 
 What about Mr.White ? 
 Thanks a lot , Eve . Goodbye . 
 I'd like to have my hair cut . 
 You look so busy . 
 Short on both sides . Not so much in the middle . 
 Yes . You are right . 
 About two months . 
 Hi , Shelley . Have you had lunch ? 
 So shall we have lunch together ? I ’ d like to take you this time . 
 How come ? 
 All right . Can we make it another time ? 
 I ’ ll call you later . Bye . 
 What about you , Emily ? Have you dated anyone recently ? 
 That's too bad . What happened ? 
 If we employ you , what starting salary would you expect ? 
 I think your background and experience are worth the compensation . 
 No , there are annual bonuses , one week paid vacation a year , and health insurance . 
 Holly ? Holly Madison , is that you ? You look great ! You haven't changed a bit . 
 It's me . The D-man ! I sat behind you in English . Are you and Taylor still dating ? 
 Well , if you're not seeing anyone , maybe we could ... 
 What should you do if you find out a man may has an illegal departure in exit control point ? 
 What else do you need to keep him in temporary custody ? 
 Mr . Reynolds ? Rick Murphy . I ’ m the accounting manager for Macmillan and Emory , Incorporated . 
 I would like to meet with you to discuss some discrepancies on our payroll account . 
 I enjoy the folk song and dance show very much . 
 I can't wait anymore . When does the performance start ? 
 ( After the show ) It's an excellent musical . The acting was very expressive and the songs and dancing were superb . 
 What do you think of the leading actors ? 
 You are a better judge . I don't know the play well enough . 
 According to their scheme , it will begin on September 10th . 
 Yes , it is much earlier than past years . 
 For what time , sir ? 
 May I have your name please , sir ? 
 Mr . Fox , we'll hold the table for you for ten minutes . Please be sure to arrive before 8: 40 . 
 Snipers ? 
 So you're afraid someone is going to snipe your Buddha ? 
 Count me out . I can do without shills and snipers and turbo-bidders . 
 Trust me . Everything will go well . 
 Not yet , Grandma , What's the matter ? 
 I'll finish soon . 
 What's wrong , Julia ? 
 Don't give up so soon . 
 Mistakes are just a lessons to learn from . 
 Do you know Abraham Lincoln ? 
 He grew up poor in Kentucky and barely had a year of schooling , but he went on to become the President of United States . 
 He is known as American's greatest president . Do you know why ? Because he fought against slavery and secession at a time in history where others were too afraid to do anything . He succeeded because of his ambition and generous spirit . 
 That's the spirit . Never give up on your dream . 
 I need to check out this book . 
 I don ’ t have one . 
 That ’ s fine . 
 All right . All done . 
 Okay . I ’ Ve signed it . 
 Great . Now can I check out this book ? 
 Okay . Take your time . 
 Sword , say it ' sword ' . 
 Look it up in the dictionary . 
 No , honey , go and read it . You'll learn . 
 My wife and I want to see the places of interest in Shenzhen , Guangzhou and Zhuhai . Can you arrange a tour for us ? 
 Well , three days . 
 That sounds good . How much is the tour ? 
 What does it include ? 
 Could we have you make all the necessary plane , hotel , and tour reservations ? 
 Excuse me , young man ? 
 Could you point me in the direction of the bank ? I ’ Ve lost my way . 
 How did you spend the weekend ? 
 Really ? How was it ? 
 Oh , yeah ? What's it about ? 
 Sounds pretty good . Is it a tragedy ? 
 Oh , I like movies with surprise endings , although , sometimes they can be frustrating . Maybe I should invite my girlfriend to go next weekend . 
 Here's your roast chicken , ma'am . 
 Excuse me , waiter , could you bring me some barbecue sauce ? 
 I'm fine for now , thanks . 
 I ’ m very sorry I can ’ t . 
 I ’ m afraid I have some business to attend to . 
 I ’ d love to but I have to help John with his math problems right now . 
 No , thanks . His home is not far and I can walk there . 
 Ok , thank you . 
 And ? 
 Poor child ! 
 Poor Ben , your wife is too mean to you . She gives you so little money every time when you are out . 
 It's ten thirty . 
 During the weekend I often take the family out on short trips . 
 Yes , it helps me to relax . 
 I like to paint .  
 Mainly seascapes . 
 I like almost all sports , and I enjoy both playing and watching . I especially like tennis and mountain climbing . I was in the climbing club all through school . 
 Good morning , Miss White . You are half an hour early . 
 Come on over . This is your desk , and this is your time card . Be sure to clock in and out before and after you work . 
 One more thing , keep your desk neat . It's the rule . There is no exception , even the art designers have to keep their desks neat . 
 Not belong . You can use them as long as you work here . When you quit , you ’ ll have to return them to the company . 
 The operator will put all your calls through . You don't have to worry about that . 
 Of course you can . Every one has his personal matters to deal with more or less , but don't chat over the phone . What's more , don't let it hinder your work and the company's business . 
 When you settle down , I'll show you around and introduce you to the department managers . 
 why ? 
 Oh , yes ! I completely forgot about it . 
 no , but now he'll be in trouble . What's a boyfriend for ? To forget about Valentine's Day ? 
 you know , it's OK for a girl to forget these " big days " , but for a guy , to do that is unforgivable . 
 oh , it's Jack . Excuse me . 
 he asked me out to a dinner tonight . How about joining us ? 
 so what ? 
 I will take the coat . Do you receive checks ? 
 Here you are . Please give me a receipt . 
 OK , please wrap it for me first . 
 Our softball team is in the finals ! We ’ re playing the McGrath office on Saturday . 
 I have a problem with my cable . 
 My cable has been out for the past week or so . 
 When will it be working again ? 
 Do I still have to pay for the cable ? 
 So , I don't have to pay for it ? 
 Okay , thanks for everything . 
 Did you get your grades yet ? 
 Why ? What happened ? 
 Ouch . You must be very disappointed . 
 Why don't you re-take the class next year ? 
 I didn't do that well either . I ended up with a 3.2 this semester . That drops my total GPA to 3.45 . 
 What was your GPA before this semester ? 
 Why did it go down so much ? 
 What happened to you ? 
 You better stop slacking off . 
 I really don ’ t know how to teach my son . He's getting far above himself . 
 Maybe you are right . I will discuss it with my wife tonight . 
 Excuse me , Miss.What did the announcement say ? 
 No kidding ! We'll miss the connecting flight . 
 I really have to get to Paris by this evening.Would you please try to find any other available flight ? 
 Yes , I think so too . 
 I hope that it does rain . 
 The sky looks so clean after it rains . I love it . 
 I love most how it is at night after it rains . 
 You can see the stars so much more clearly after it rains . 
 I would too . 
 What's wrong ? 
 Then just keep your chin up . 
 Hello . I'm Ms Dawson from Lexington Software . I need to send these documents to Vietnam via L / C . 
 I have , but I have never done this before so would it be possible for you to double check them ? 
 Thank you . I don't think there should be any problems , but just to be sure ... 
 That's fine . Thank you again . 
 Do you mean the contract for equipment rental or the one for training ? 
 Yes and no . Let me see if I can clarify that . The terms are the same except that the contract for training has a clause that allows for the cancellation after the first six months . 
 Sure . What I mean is that either side could cancel the training contract after the six months as long as it's in writing . 
 Yes , that's right . 
 Hello . Excuse me . 
 Do you remember me ? I just had lunch here a half hour ago . 
 I think I lost my wallet here . 
 Really ? You didn't find a wallet ? 
 Yes , I would . It's not here . And it's not on the floor.Has anyone sat at this table since we left ? 
 Hmm . I don't know how it could have happened . 
 No . My friend did . 
 No , I'm not sure . But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down.It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . So I usually put it next to me on the table . 
 I don't think it's at home . I think I had it when I left the house.But what should I do ? 
 Should I call the police ? 
 Hmm . I'll go home and check . Maybe you're right . Maybe it's at home . 
 Thanks for your help . 
 Maybe it's just a blessing in disguise . I've been wanting to try a new place anyway . 
 I doubt if I can pass it . 
 But I often skip his classes , and he doesn't like me . 
 I must , if I want to pass the course . 
 I like to go to the movies . What do you do in your free time ? 
 Well that's great ! It's nice that we have something in common . 
 Which credit card was the bill for ? 
 That bill should have been mailed about two weeks ago . 
 My computer shows that it has already been mailed . 
 You should try contacting your post office . 
 You'll have to prove it was their error ; then you can get an extension . 
 You are very welcome . Have a good day . 
 Nice to meet you , too . 
 I recently graduated from college as an English major . 
 Admittedly , I don't . But I still beg you to give me an opportunity , and I'm willing to learn with my best effort . 
 I have got a Business English Certificate and a Certificate of TEM 8 . 
 I got professional training in this field , and I believe I can fit the position well . 
 I have taken some courses in college , such as translation , business English , and so on . So I have a good mastery of both spoken and written English 
 Your approval would be my honor . 
 Are you sure ? 
 Send an ambulance fast ! My husband is having a heart attack ! 
 I live on 1177 Oak lane in Smithfield . Oh , hurry , I don't know what to do ! 
 yes , yes , he's right here by me . 
 Yes , he's breathing , but he's not conscious ! Oh , please hurry ! 
 Yes , the lift is just around the corner.You can go up first , and your luggage will be brought up straight away . 
 Wow , this is drop-dead gorgeous . 
 Don't remind me of that . This would be the last time I cut any classes for a basketball game . 
 I just can't help it . Oh , look at Clive , he is really a big hit . They are definitely gonna win . 
 Come on , 18 points already , they are never gonna catch up . 
 Thay are coming back to narrow the gap . 
 A secret weapon . They'd better set up the defense now . 
 Oh , man ! I can't believe it . A slam dunk ! 
 Have we handed out all the water ? 
 Nothing . The teacher said the only thing left was to get back all the disposable cups later . 
 Terrific . There is one girl said , It is the best game I've ever watched . 
 Clive was really outstanding . Not only he put on a big show himself , but also he inspired the whole team . 
 On the other hand , I think the other team won everyone's respect . The leader said they could have crumpled at the beginning , but they just carried on and never lost their cool . 
 The thing I like most about them is that they did not play with a heavy heart even though at that time the odds seemed to be against them . 
 What should I get Uncle Teddy ? 
 Are you kidding ? That's the stupidest gift one can buy . I don't want to get a tie . 
 Everybody gets men ties for Christmas . It's too boring . Everybody buys either ties or sweaters . I want a more unique gift . 
 That's a cool idea . At least it would be a surprise.But I'm afraid he wouldn't take care of it . 
 Yes . An iguana is too strange for a gift , and a tie is too normal.So I have to find something halfway between . 
 Well , he was very good to me.He helped me edit my essay for the scholarship contest.So I want to spend at least 75 dollars . 
 Yes . 
 What should he have then ? 
 I think that's a great idea . Men look great with that kind of bag.Where can we buy one ? 
 Alright . We can go later then . 
 Good plan . What should we get for Mom though ? 
 Alright . We can go check at Sears and see if they have them.And what about Dad ? 
 I think it would be a great joke.But I know we'd have to take the iguana back . And the pet store might not let us.So why don't we get him something else ? Some clothes maybe . 
 Oh , shut up about ties ! Forget about ties , why not ? 
 Hi , I was wondering if I could get my test results from the other day . 
 Is something wrong with me ? 
 Can we talk about it now ? 
 When can I come and see you ? 
 Now I know that something bad is up ! 
 How do you think they could be ended ? 
 So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer.If the problem is resources , share them . 
 Yes , it is.One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive . 
 I would like to have a roll developed . 
 How about tomorrow morning ? 
 The 4 x6 will be OK . Thanks . 
 I prefer glossy . How much ? 
 Thanks ! 
 What's up , Robert ? 
 Slow down . What are you talking about ? 
 How do you do ? I ’ m Parker . 
 Parker . 
 Yes , with a P . 
 Barker ? With a B . Of course . 
 Won ’ t you come in , Mr . Barker ? 
 What are you typing there ? 
 Really ? Did you find any information about a new job ? 
 Great ! Do you think you have a chance at getting the job ? 
 Maybe I should try looking on the web for work . 
 But there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net . You might have no chance . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Chang ? 
 There are about twenty people named Chang who work here . What department ? 
 Eric Chang in accounting ? 
 I'll call him and tell him you're here . 
 Would you like to have a seat over there ? It'll just be a minute . And can I have your name ? 
 OK . I'll have him come up to get you . 
 We have beef with rice and fish with noodles . Which would you like ? 
 Would you care for coffee or tea ? 
 Hello . Is everything OK ? Can I help you ? 
 That's no problem . Is it cash ? 
 Of course . If you could sign your name on the bottom line here , and write your address here . And please sign and date the back of every cheque and of course I'll need to see your passport . 
 How do you like your work ? 
 What do you do ? 
 Mine isn't hard , but it's not interesting . 
 I'm a clerk in a shop . 
 Rudeness . You are not expected to sit down before being invited , and you shouldn ’ t throw yourself into the chair like you ’ re loading heavy baggage . 
 That ’ s right . The ideal posture for women is to put their legs together and lean to one side . This is especially important in summer . 
 Put it beside you . Don ’ t pile your purses , briefcase and other belongings on the employer ’ s desk . You've got long hair . Don ’ t touch it while talking to the interviewer . It gives people the feeling that you cannot concentrate on your work . 
 Also , if you are asked to sit beside the employer's desk , neither lean on it nor look at the documents there . 
 As the saying goes , when in Rome , do as the Romans do . 
 I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I ’ m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it mys 
 yes , they are . I gave them a good clean . They are in good condition and don ’ t need to be replaced . 
 as I hadn ’ t done it before , I had to keep referring to information I got from the internet . Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . The 
 you ’ ll be lucky ! However , I ’ ll print out the information I got from the internet and you can do it yourself . 
 Yes.There are the Huangshan Hotel and Anshan Hotel nearby.And you can take a taxi to go there . 
 You're welcome ! By the way , you'd better booked in the Internet or the telephone next time and then you kow whether there are rooms available or not . 
 It's your turn to go first . 
 No , Mary went first last time . 
 Hello.Is this ABC Rent-a-car Company ? 
 This morning we rented a car and we are on the way to Niagara Falls . I'm afraid we have a car accident near the border . 
 I'm all right , but my friend is seriously injured.Will you call an ambulance and the police ? 
 I ran into the guardrail when I turned to the left . 
 Yes , I ’ Ve nearly finished , June . I ’ m sure we will win something this week . 
 If I win a lot of money , I shall buy you a mink coat . 
 All right . If we win a lot of money , we shall travel around the world and we shall stay at the best hotels . Then we will return home and buy a big house in the country . We will have a beautiful 
 If we spend all the money , we will try and win the football pools again . 
 May , could you bring this note to Professor Li for me today ? 
 I know . But attending Miss Li's class is just waste of time . No more than one third of her students will go to her class . 
 Yeah , my boyfriend plays the video game every time in class with me . Or I chat with my friends through text messages . 
 Right , so we must spare some time to attend selective courses . 
 What can I do ? I have things to do in Students ' Government . 
 Sometimes I will try various excuses . But this is my last time asking for leave . Or I will have a bad record . 
 I have been absented from many classes this semester just because of my work in the Students ' Government . 
 I am thinking about quitting my job in the student government . But before that , I must do my job . Bye . Don't forget about that note . 
 Hello , is Jack there ? 
 Jack ! It ’ s Rose here . 
 Fine , thanks . I ’ m having several friends over for dinner this Saturday . And I was wondering if you have the time to join us . 
 Is six o ’ clock okay ? 
 Yeah . 
 I have found myself a date mate . 
 A barrel of fun , of course . He often says that I'm a date bait . 
 I'm sorry , Mrs . Lin . We don't allow smoking in the office . 
 Yes , I don't feel well today . 
 Since the day before yesterday . 
 It began with a shiver then I perspired a great deal . 
 Thank you . Doctor . 
 I have many hobbies , I like almost all kinds of sports and I also like to listen to pop songs . 
 I think I am extroverted . 
 I have some extra help with my project . What would you prefer to help me with , typing or xeroxing ? 
 That is very kind of you to offer to do that . Can you start with the pages on the table ? 
 I like your positive attitude . How many years have you been employed here ? 
 We have a really interesting project coming up . Would you want to join us on it ? 
 OK . I will mention how great you were about helping me today . I appreciate your help . 
 Stay for dinner with us . 
 Well , I won't keep you then . It was very nice of you to come to see me . 
 Goodbye . Thank you again for coming . 
 There are a few stories about natural disasters . There is a massive forest fire in Australia . It covers several square kilometers of land has destroyed many more square kilometers . 
 Nobody knows at the moment , but it has been very hot there recently . The drought in Africa is causing starvation . Millions of people have migrated to try and find food . 
 The European union has sent several plants with relief supplies . Several countries have sent soldiers to distribute food and medical supplies . Refugee camps have been set up across the region . 
 Six have been seriously affected , but the refugees are also migrating to several surrounding countries . 
 Yes . There have been a few there recently . They say that this one was not a big quake . The Iranians are dealing with it on their own . They have purchased some special equipment to find people buried u 
 So far , less than 20 people have died , but over 100 are in hospital . 
 No . Um , do you carry any padded coat ? 
 Small size . 
 Whatever . You know , I ’ m thinking of a gift for my mother . It ’ s her 60 birthday next Friday . Could you give me some advice ? You are the expert . 
 Looks nice . How much do you charge ? 
 That ’ s sheer robbery . I ’ m sure you can do better than that . 
 $ 80 . 
 Do you have to pay to join ? 
 Wow , that much ? Don't they have any public courses ? 
 How was your game today ? 
 Congratulations ! What's your normal handicap ? 
 My drives were terrible today . I kept slicing the ball into the roughs and sand traps . 
 What do you do in your spare time ? 
 What kind of music do you like ? 
 Actually me , too . 
 Did you watch NBA games before you came to the U . S . ? 
 What a pity ! 
 Yes , of course . 
 Kobe . 
 Let's go to watch an NBA game tonight , shall we ? 
 Look ! It fits you perfectly . It looks great on you and has your name on it . 
 Did you hear something ? 
 It is a good habit to set your cell phone to vibrate . It is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices . 
 Maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done . 
 Would you mind answering a few personal questions ? 
 OK . Does your present employer know that you are going to leave ? 
 Will she let you leave your present job ? 
 Why do you want to leave your present job ? 
 I appreciate you frankness . Do you know anything about our company ? 
 Good afternoon , is there a vacant room here ? 
 A single room , preferably with a bath . 
 For a week or so . 
 I hope it's quiet . I hate noise at night . 
 What is the rate , please ? 
 What services come with that ? 
 That sounds good . Well , do you give discount for a week or more ? 
 All right . I will take a room for a week . 
 Can I get dinner here ? 
 I see . 
 Just a moment , I'm coming . ( ten minutes later ) . Now , what would you like ? 
 Yes , certainly . Here you are . 
 It's written in English too , in smaller print . There . 
 Right . ( five minutes later ) Now , what are you having ? 
 All right , but would you be so kind as to make up your mind soon ? We're very busy just now as you can see , sir . 
 You will receive the tender notice next month and you'll find the information . 
 I believe your corporation will try your best and I understand fully your feeling , if your tender conditions proved be suitable for our general conditions of tender , we will accept your submission of tender . 
 That's all right . You can contact me later if you have other questions after you read the tender notice . 
 Bye ! 
 What about ? 
 Is there a problem ? 
 In three years your lease will be up . 
 If you do , I will keep your deductible . 
 I would keep it because you would be breaking our contract . 
 I hope that I cleared things up for you . 
 Yes , I would like to have a suit made to measure . 
 I want a single breasted suit . Here is the cloth . 
 I would like to sign up for some classes . 
 I need to take a driver's course . 
 What do I need to make an appointment for ? 
 All right , can I make an appointment right now ? 
 Can I make it for tomorrow at 9 
 Thanks a lot . I'll be there tomorrow . 
 I have been feeling pretty good , Dr . Smith . 
 Yes , I am playing on the tennis team this year , and they are requiring me to get a physical exam . 
 I ’ Ve being kind of been having problems being out of breath . Can you look at that ? 
 Thank you . What will the blood test tell you ? 
 I have been working hard to stay healthy . I hope the tests turn out well . 
 Outlets have cheap cashmere sweaters . 
 Outlets usually give you great deals . 
 You're welcome . 
 Oh yeah , it was great ! He took me to an Italian restaurant and we had an amazing conversation . I told him about how many kids I want , and how my parents will be so excited to meet him . 
 Yeah ! I called him after I got home to arrange our next date , but unfortunately his grandma is sick so he has been busy every night visiting her in the hospital . 
 that's true . But I have a low opinion of those women who go out with foreigners . 
 I think some Chinese wone marry foreigners for money while others just want to live abroad . There is no true love between them . 
 well , then why aren't there many East-West couples where the man is a Chinese and the woman is a Westerner ? 
 or because they are less attractive to to Chinese men . 
 you know , usually the woman is in her thirties and she is a left girl . 
 they're called that because they're left behind on the shelf . They're also known by their three H's---high diploma , high salary , and high degree . and they're also known as the three S's — single , 
 that ' for sure but very few . 
 Yes , I was wondering if you had the time to show me around this exhibition ? 
 I'm in the electrical appliances . 
 Thanks , they are rather attractive . But I think there is nothing better than seeing things In actual operation . 
 Yes , very much , if it wouldn't add inconvenience to you . First hand information is always more valuable than reading pamphlets . 
 That would be great . 
 Yes . How would you like it ? 
 OK , here you are . 
 It's OK . 
 Yeah . It's boring . I'd rather read something more exciting . 
 Yeah , you remember that assignment I wanted ? When I heard the manager had given it to someone else , I blew my top . So the manager fired me . 
 I feel terrible sick , miss . I wonder if I could change my seat to the front part . 
 Thank you . 
 What a mess ! 
 Hi Jane , you look great . 
 Yes , I took off 4 kilos . I am glad you notice it . 
 No no , I just changed my eating habits . I eat a balance meal . and I eat less than before . 
 Besides , yours don't have side pockets like mine . 
 Just the necessities 
 No , but you never know when you'll need a flashlight . 
 Are you going to helen ’ s birthday party on Friday evening ? 
 If everyone turned up , it would be a squeeze . But a few people said that they couldn ’ t go . So I think it should be OK ? 
 I ’ Ve got her a birthday present and I ’ ll take a bottle fo wine too . 
 Helen gets on very well with her neighbors . I wouldn ’ t be surprised if they went to the party too . 
 Well , don ’ t be late . I ’ ll see you on Friday at helen ’ s . 
 I beg you pardon ? Miss who ? 
 I'm sorry , but I don't know that name . You must have the wrong number . 
 Sorry . There's no one named Li Lin here . Are you sure you have the right name ? 
 What number are you trying to dial ? 
 No . It isn't . It's 423-6631 . 
 No problem . 
 Why not ? 
 We'll have to talk this over some more . 
 Yes ? 
 Oh , did you ? 
 Yes , of course.Will you come with the receipt ? 
 Until 8 o'clock , ma'am . We are looking forward to seeing you . 
 Yes , how do I get to your shop from Chilin ? 
 Thank you very much .

 You just need a little more practice .

 Not so good , though his nephew took him to hospital in time . 
 I guess you should know that you need to be hospitalized . 
 Now you can go to the in-patient department to go through the admission procedures . 
 It's hard to say . It depends on your recovery condition . But you need to stay for at least one day for observation . 
 Bye ! 
 I like you to come in and discuss some further tests that I would like to run . 
 For now , I would like to run a few more tests to look into some of the problems that you mentioned .

 Here is a good place . Let's get out . 
 Mother Nature is quite an artist . 
 Amazing . The sun is almost gone and yet there is still color everywhere ! 
 What's up ? You sound a little down in dumps . 
 Calm down ! Shouting won ’ t help ? 
 What happened ? 
 What ? He can't do this to you . 
 What did you do ? 
 Hold it , Mike . You won't accomplish anything by hollering at him , right ? You worked it all up till now . Why not wait until you cool down a bit ? 
 Just stay cool . You know . When you get back home tonight , tell him that you didn't mean to quarrel with him . 
 I know . It wouldn't hurt much to say sorry first . And after that , you can casually mention the problem . I am sure he will cooperate . 
 There's a question I'm not sure whether it is suitable to ask . 
 When you go dinner with John , who foots the bill ? 
 Good morning , can I have your ticket , please ? 
 Thank you . Would you like a window or an aisle seat ? 
 Who ’ s that ? 
 Oh , please come in . nice to see you .

 Good for you ! You ’ Ve got new curtains too . That ’ s a very nice shade of blue . This sofa is very comfortable . I could sit on it all day ! 
 To be honest , it looks like your old carpet . Is it really new or did you just have your old cleaned ? 
 Do you think this blouse really suits me ? 
 Not too tight in the waist ? 
 Hi , Maggy , Did you hear about David ? 
 You know , about David and new boss . 
 Well , I hear David have been fired . 
 Does your chicken taste all right ? 
 My fish has good seasoning but is a little dry . 
 Yes , maybe they are short-handed in the kitchen tonight . 
 The vegetables seem to not be very fresh . 
 I usually enjoy the meals here , so I think that we should tell the waiter that there is something wrong with this meal . 
 When can I have your firm C . I . F . prices , that is to say , the final offer , Mr . London ? 
 Yes . I ’ ll be here tomorrow morning at 10 . 
 I don ’ t need that long to make up my mind . If your prices are agreeable and if I can get the commission I want , I can place the order right away .

 I ’ m buying for chain department stores in Canada . They are also interested in Egyptian carpets . Could you introduce me to the person in charge of this line ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Well , I wouldn't swim in it - but the water is much cleaner than it was a few years ago . 
 Yes , but it must be treated in an effluent treatment plant first . 
 It's coming along well , but it is a little delayed . 
 I'm pressed for time and I am afraid I need someone to help me . 
 OK , we promise to do it well .

 Hello , welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you today ? 
 No problem . OK ... just checking for you . Ah , I'm afraid there aren't enough funds in your account to cover this transaction . What you can do is buy some US dollars , using local currency and we can credit your account with that amount . 
 It's not too bad today , actually . 828.23 . 
 The owners have counter-offered three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars . 
 There are two ways to respond . You can either come back with another offer or go with their counter-offer . 
 No one else has made an offer , so you could make another offer if you want to do so . 
 OK , I will present your counter-offer to the owners tonight . 
 By now , the owners probably have a pretty good idea of what they will accept . It will go quickly . 
 I think that's a good idea . You know I got a golfing buddy that runs a consultant firm . He's an expert in organizational comunication.He does't come cheap , but he's an expert in this field.Maybe he could help get things on track . 
 He's done staff for Microsoft and Boeing . I think he's been involved with Siemens ' training evaluations as well . I'll get you his card , you can give him a call . 
 Honey , a typhoon is coming . 
 Jenny , come and help , we need to prepare more food . 
 My wife's birthday is today . I need some flowers . 
 How much do the roses cost ? 
 That sounds good . Last year I paid $ 30 . 
 Give me a dozen . 
 No , I'll just give her the roses and a card . 
 Let's go eat . 
 I ’ m fed up with marriage . 
 Oh , no . When we were poor , we often tried our best to make ends meet . It was a hard time . 
 And we have some squabbles on some boring things . 
 Did you put the blue bin out on the street ? 
 Well , you'd better take it out front . 
 It usually gets here at noon on Tuesday , which is tomorrow . 
 Oh , no , you don't . 
 Every morning you get up late and rush off to work late . 
 You'll remember to do it , but you won't have time to do it . 
 Thank god you are open ! I have an emergency ! 
 I need this dress and this suit dry cleaned ASAP ! 
 No , you don ’ t understand , I need this tomorrow morning ! I accidentally spilled beer all over my wife ’ s dress and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow ! She ’ s gonna kill me ! 
 Fine ! Can you also iron and starch this shirt ? 
 Great ! This is our secret ! If you see my wife , say nothing to her about this ! 
 Well , you'd better lie down now . You need a good rest . 
 Hi , Mike , where are you going ? 
 At this time ? Why don ’ t you go there tomorrow ? It is almost dark . 
 But I have seen many toys in your home . 
 But if he always destroys toys and asks you to buy new ones , what will you do ? 
 And you still buy him new ones ? 
 You will spoil him . 
 Sure , here you are . And here are my application forms as well . 
 Nice to meet you Mr . Jones . 
 Well , my first order of business will be attending a conference in Seattle , but after that I intend to spend two weeks visiting my friends . I assumed a business visa would be required . 
 So I can attend conferences and do business on that visa ? 
 Oh , I see . I think 90 days is more than enough time . 
 Yes , I need to order a large number of Webster's dictionaries . 
 Is there a discount for buying in large quantity ? 
 No , have you ? 
 How'd you get a ticket ? 
 I don't understand why you would do that . 
 Where'd you get the ticket at ? 
 What about your parking spot ? 
 I bet that you wish you hadn't done that . 
 Well , you don't seem to be interested in getting a real job , either . 
 Yeah , and every high school student in town is banging on your door , right ? 
 You're such a dreamer ! You think that you can spread the word of jazz in an underpass ? 
 Well , I ’ Ve got some papers due . 
 Not too good yet . Better than I was though . 
 Scrambled egg , bacon , three pieces of bread and a cup of tea . 
 No , thank you . 
 Yes , I am . 
 I have been married for three years . 
 There are three people in my family . 
 My wife , my daughter and I .

 Take it easy . I'll send a larger to pick you up . 
 I would like to know is it a direct flight to Dubai ? 
 Too bad . I hate transferring during a flight . It is too complex . 
 Really ? It used to cost a few hours . 
 Ok . Good . I want two side by side tickets in the Economy cabinet . Thank you . 
 Certainly . I'll do it for you right away . Sorry the drugs on this order are out of stock . 
 Would you prefer to take similar medicine of other brands ? 
 Certainly . I recommend this medicine . It's the same medicine , same quality , at a much lower cost . And it helps just as much . In fact , you'll feel better just by saving the money , I promise . 
 This is for internal use . Two tablets , four times a day . 
 You're welcome . 
 Because this order is a comparatively big one , we would like to pay by time L / C , say , 60 days L / C . 
 But we have only moderate mean at hand . If you can do us a special favor this time and allow us to delay payment , we'd really appreciate it . 
 Thank you for your consideration . When will you let me know your answer ? 
 How about you and Tom ? What time is your wedding ? 
 What ’ s the matter ? So angry . I ’ m just playing a joke with you . 
 Hey , there ’ s Leo . I wonder why he ’ s walking arm in arm with that young woman . 
 You ’ re pulling my leg ! She must be thirty years younger than Leo . Talk about robbing the cradle ! 
 It must have been love at first sight because I know he didn ’ t have a girlfriend last week . 
 It's so boring . 
 I don't . Is there anything worth watching on the other channel ? 
 Do you mind if we switch over ? 
 What's the movie ? 
 It must be interesting . 
 What do you do in your spare time ? 
 Do you mind if I come along sometime ? 
 Hey , David . Where did you get the sofa ? It's so beautiful . Look at the color , I really love this yellow , so bright ! It must be very expensive . 
 Are you kidding ? $ 100 for this big leather sofa ? 
 Is it a used one ? 
 Oh , I don't think I will buy a used sofa even it looks so attractive . 
 I'm sorry . I forget all about it . 
 It's leap my mind . I really feel terrible about it . 
 I'm really sorry I let you down . I'll make it up to you somehow . 
 Yes , of course . What area are you interested in ? 
 What size house would you like ? 
 Are you interested in being in a particular school district ? 
 Would you like a home near the lake or would you prefer a view ? 
 Fine , I will begin a search for the perfect home for you . I will call you in a few days . 
 Dad , I lost mum's necklace . I'm afraid she will scold me . 
 It is so kind of you , Dad .

 Oh , it's ten o'clock . I'd better go now . 
 No , thanks . I'll have to meet my friend at the airport . 
 Ashes to ashes and dust to dust ... 
 I'll tell you all about it another day . 
 You ladies look very elegant in black . But I don't want you to wear black in my honor for a long time yet to come ... 
 Yes . Can I help you ? 
 Yes , how would you like your coffee ? 
 We also serve sandwiches and cakes . 
 how come you're still up ? Shouldn't you be asleep by now ? 
 as far as I know , insomnia is usually caused by stress . Are you stressed at all ? 
 you're a good student . I'm sure you can do well . What you need to do is to relax . 
 taking a yoga class or learning some relaxation techniques can help you cope with your stress . 
 you need to take some breaks throughout the day . Studying all day isn ’ t very usually effective . 
 besides , it ’ s not difficult to learn yoga . In fact , I can teach you a move that ’ s supposed to help you fall asleep ! You just have to sit down like this , bend over and breath in deeply . 
 good night , sleep tight ; don ’ t let the bed bugs bite ! 
 Yes , I did . I passed ! 
 Well , I certainly couldn't have done it without your help . You are the best tutor I've ever had . 
 You deserve credit , too . I've learned so much from You .

 I think so too . How much is it ? 
 Well , that's too expensive . I can't afford that .

 That's quite convenient.Well , would you please buy me some ? I am so busy.My room number is 304 . 
 Nathan said he didn't have any fun at his new school this week . Do you know why ? 
 He really misses his friends from our old neighborhood . 
 How do you propose to help him understand that ? 
 I guess we could go visit once in a while too . 
 Why did Tom quit the job ? 
 If he doesn't change his attitude toward his work , I don't think a new job can make any difference . 
 Hi , David . What a beautiful necklace ! Dude , I ’ Ve never seen anything like it . 
 I think seven hundred is enough .

 Seattle restaurant . Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 May I have your name , please ? 
 OK , Sir . We will arrange it for you . 
 Marry Lin please . 
 All right , could I leave a message ? 
 Please ask her to call John . 
 It is so terrible to be caught unaware . 
 Sure . So you should know how to deal with the probable questions and then make flexible reply . 
 State your opinion or argument first , and then go on with details . 
 If you indeed don't know how to answer , admit it frankly . 
 Confirm the question if you don't catch it clearly . 
 It can help you leave a deep impression on the interviewer . 
 He has a glib tongue . Few people can argue him down . 
 We cannot expect a man like him to speak the truth . 
 Almost . Let me get my bag . 
 Well , he's very tall and handsome . 
 He has big blue eyes and long blonde hair . 
 Down to his shoulders . It's beautiful , like gold . 
 He's a very creative painter . His paintings sell well . 
 He's quite a patient teacher , too . 
 You're going to like him . Everybody says he's a nice guy . 
 So am I . 
 How about we go eat in the cafeteria ? 
 You haven't ? They have a lot of good stuff . 
 They sell everything . 
 I've gotten chow mein from there before . 
 Trust me , the food isn't half bad . 
 Yeah.The autumn is marvelous here . 
 That's a hard time.The air is cold and damp , and the road is often icy . 
 Sure . 
 Plenty.We never worry about lack of rainwater in our area . 
 That's right . 
 Hello , there , my name is Tonia . 
 Actually , I can do both soprano and alto but the director asked me to sing alto for the next perforate . What about you . 
 Our bass section is really good . You're going to love singing with them . 
 It's good to have you in the group . We can always use a good baritone ! 
 Sorry , madam . You have to wait your turn . The parking lot is full . 
 Madam , patience is a virtue . 
 I'm sure a spot will open up soon . 
 Hello Mary . I haven ’ t seen you for ages . Are you still seeing Paul ? 
 Did you break up amicably ? Sometimes couples row a lot before splitting up . 
 Yes , I am . We ’ re thinking about getting engaged . We ’ Ve been dating for over a year now . 
 I havn't seen her for a while.She stopped seeing nick because he was cheating on her.He was seeing a girl form his office.One day , she saw them holding hands and ended the relationship immediately . 
 Really ? They ’ Ve been together for a long time . When are they getting married ? 
 Thanks . Hey , look at that guy over there . I think he fancies you . 
 Good morning , Miss Li . 
 I ’ m sorry that I was absent yesterday . 
 I feel much better now . 
 I ’ Ve already got it . Thanks . 
 I will . 
 How much do you want ? 
 I am so sorry to hear that . Is that enough ? 
 Forget it ! We seemingly need to gather money little by little . 
 No rush . You can give it back whenever you have it . 
 Why are you asking me the strange question , Jerry ? 
 Well . I think IQ matters more . But it won't work without EQ . 
 Because an intellectual mind can only be a beneficial thing in life . 
 That's why people's achievement varies greatly . 
 Yes , Jerry , can you share your understanding of EQ ? 
 Quite right . Have you noticed that a high IQ is not a must for one's success ? 
 Yes , his IQ is high enough for him to embrace the success as long as he can manage his EQ . 
 May I recommend you Tsingtao beer ?

 Fine , sir . 
 Tin or bottle ? 
 Would you like it on the rocks , sir ? 
 You're welcome . 
 What's wrong with it ? 
 Oh ... 
 Sorry , love . 
 My cigarettes . 
 In the dustbin ! Why didn't you tell me before ? 
 I would like to buy two bottles of brandy . 
 Can I buy these tax free ? 
 Your muscles are a spectacle ! 
 No , but I am starting working out from now on . 
 You look a bit dull today . What's up ? 
 I'm sorry to hear that . Well , I heard that registered urban unemployment rate reached 4 percent this year , with more than half being women . 
 Yeah , it's true . What is she going to do ? 
 That's not bad . It could be a short-term alternative . Your mum can look for another one when the market improves . Things will work out eventually . 
 Hello , Alice . Would you like to go to the temple fair with me ? 
 Yes . The ancient custom of holding temple fairs is to offer sacrifices to the god of the earth , and they have developed into a festival filled with food , performances and games now . 
 Absolutely , I love temple fairs . Beijing has several temple fairs recently . They are different from each other to some extent , but also have a lot in common . 
 What about Tianqiao Temple Fair ? A variety of opera performances , acrobatics shows , and food will dazzle you . 
 Of course . 
 How can I help you ? 
 What kind would you like to open ?

 Sure . Which button do I press to shoot ? 
 Do I have to focus it ? 
 All right . Say cheese ! 
 What's going on over there ? 
 How long does that usually take ? 
 What's happening at the far end ? 
 Sorry , stewardess . Where shall I put my bags ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 You have stayed for 6 day.Here is your bill . 
 Surely of course . But you have to be back by 5 o'clock , otherwise we will charge you 10 $ . 
 I want to make dinner tonight . 
 I don't have any idea what to cook . 
 Can you tell me how to make it ? 
 Okay , but what do I have to do to prepare it ? 
 What do I do after that ? 
 What else do I have to do ? 
 What exactly is the problem with the latest lot ? 
 But we can't accept your damage claim . 
 You didn't note the damage on the bill of lading . 
 I got laid off today . 
 Yeah . 
 My boss said I didn ’ t have enough skills to do the job well . 
 I ’ m going to start taking classes at the local community college to try to improve my skills . Then I ’ ll start looking for a new position . 
 I can't help it . 
 To tell the truth , I feel tired . 
 I had to visit all my relatives . 
 It tastes great , but it is really dry . Is your fish all right ? 
 I wonder if they left it sitting around too long before they served it . 
 Are your vegetables OK ? 
 So are mine . I think they left them cooking too long . 
 I think that you are right . Maybe they can give us a free dessert or something . 
 You see this is the first time for me to use the swimming pool . I've got no idea about the water temperature of the pool . I'm afraid it might be a little cold . 
 I see . But I'm not a good swimmer . Can you tell me how deep the pool is ? 
 That's great ! Can you give me the key to the locker ? I can't wait to have a try . 
 He is in the bedroom and fallen asleep . 
 He ran four miles and came back dead beat . 
 I'm really in a flap about the interview . 
 I'm in such a need of the job that I can't afford any mistakes . 
 have you seen bill recently ? 
 daisy ’ s in hospital too . she got food poisoning last week . She thinks she got it from some bad seafood . 
 he ’ s fine , but he had a fever last week . He probably just had a cold . 
 I see . My niece just flew back from Australia to visit . She ’ s got jetlag now . she ’ s just resting today , but we ’ ll probably go out somewhere tomorrow . 
 oh , your hand is still sore . You should put some ointment on it to stop the swelling . 
 yes , I banged it against to cooker yesterday . It really hurt , but it ’ s OK now . the bruise will disappear soon . 
 Yes , how much is the teapot ? 
 I'm afraid I haven't got enough money on me . 
 What's the time now ? 
 I want to know at what time you close . 
 Oh , that's great ! Thank you . 
 Yes , sir . Can I help you ? 
 Medium rare , that ’ s right , sir . I remember your order . 
 If it is not to your satisfaction , I ’ ll certainly bring you another . But I ’ m afraid you may have to wait for a few minutes . 
 I am a reporter from Channel 5 News . 
 Could I ask you some questions ? 
 Did you vote today ? 
 What candidate did you vote for ? 
 Why is that ? 
 I understand . 
 Can I help you ? 
 We have various colors . How about this one ? 
 You have a very good taste . It's our best seller . 
 Sure ! Look , it suits you well . 
 Yes , Ms . Ross ? What do you need ? 
 Good news ! I ’ ll be glad to . When do you need it ? 
 It's a chance in a million . I hear John is interested in it . 
 But anyway , I'll have a try . 
 Could you stay a little longer ? 
 In that case , I won ’ t keep you.Remember to give me a call . 
 ... Now that we have been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter , Ed ! Give us some good news . How are things looking for us in terms sales this month ? 
 What ? Ed , don ’ t tell me you only have bad news ! 
 For crying out loud ... How fast are we losing money ? 
 What ! Geez ! How could this have happened ? So what ’ s the bad news ? 
 Are you joking ? Get the supplier on the line now ! They have to assume the costs of this mess ! 
 We ’ re doomed ! 
 Really ? What ! 
 Could you introduce some whitening products for me ? 
 Then what kind of product can fade freckles ? 
 How much is it ? 
 It is too expensive for me . Do you have something cheaper ? 
 My brother started investing money when he was 16 years old . 
 Our advertisement says English competence is a key requirement of this position . Then how do you think of your proficiency in written and spoken English ? 
 What other foreign language do you speak ? 
 What do you think are the qualities a nurse should have ? 
 What kind of medicines does the doctor usually prescribe to children who get high fever ? 
 Hello , Peace Hotel . 
 A moment , please . I'll check our room availability for these days ... Yes , that's all right.What ' s your name please ? 
 Hello everyone , and welcome to our CPR for beginners course.First of all , does anyone know what CPR stands for ? 
 That ’ s right ! We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest . 
 Well , basically if your heart stops pumping blood , or your lungs stop pumping air , then we need to get them going again ! That ’ s when we have to apply this procedure . Let ’ s begin ! I need a volunteer . 
 Alright , come here and lay flat on your back . Let ’ s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . We must lift the person ’ s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs . Then we place our mouth over the other person ’ s mouth and blow air two or three times , like this . 
 Madam I ’ m not trying to kiss you ! I am trying to demonstrate how to apply CPR in the case of an emergency . 
 As I was saying , we blow air through the mouth in this manner . Once this is done , we must try to get the heart going again . To do this , we place our hands over the person ’ s chest , and press down firmly two or three times . 
 Good coming , Sir . 
 Where would you like to go ? 
 Here we are . 
 Nine pounds twenty . 
 Thank you . Sir 
 Let's go to Burger Queen for lunch . They have good cheese burgers . 
 Look at the long line , there are always a lot of people waiting in lines just for the cheese burger . It must be very delicious . 
 Come on . It is worth waiting . Their cheese burgers are really popular . Once you have it , you will love it . 
 Yup , they have good French fries as well . Not very thick , but crispy enough . You should try them with some mayonnaise sauce . That is the Belgium style . You will love it . 
 Come on . You just have it once in a while , not every day . It will not harm you . 
 Be patient . Good food never comes fast . 
 Northwest Airline .

 I would like to discuss purchasing a home with you . 
 I would like to live in Pasadena or Arcadia . 
 We would like a smaller cozy cottage with 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom . 
 No , we don ’ t really care because they are all pretty good around here . 
 We really want to live in a lakeside home with a dock for our boat . 
 I have redecorated my bedroom . I decide to repaint the walls and change the pictures . I also bought a new pair of curtains . What do you think of it ? 
 I bought a new mattress and some fresh bedclothes . I also bought a new dressing table and a new bedside table . 
 do you think that I should get a new wardrobe ? 
 yes . I have so many clothes stuffed into it . Perhaps I should get rid of some of them . There are clothes in there that I never wear anymore . 
 that ’ s a good idea . After I get rid of the old clothes I no longer wear , I can see what new clothes I need to buy . 
 ok . I ’ ll let you know when I ’ Ve sorted out my clothes . 
 Yes , He had just bought a new motorcycle . 
 Yes , I tried it and I quite liked it . 
 Sure . But I still liked it . 
 No . Although motorcycle is nice , I ’ d like to buy a bicycle . 
 Because bicycles are safer . 
 I ’ m terribly sorry . May I have your order again ? I'll get it right away . 
 I'm sorry . I must have made a mistake . I'll bring them for you at once . 
 Pardon me , Miss . But didn't you order chicken soup ? 
 I believe so . But if it really bothers you , I'll replace it for you . 
 Sorry . I'm afraid we can't . But you may order something else instead . 
 Okay , Miss . 
 I hope you enjoy your dinner . 
 I'm trying to decide what to wear to school the first day . 
 Didn't tell me what ? What ? 
 What are you talking about brother ? Spill it . 
 You mean I have to wear the same thing every day ? MOM ! 
 It's a job I have been dreaming of for many years . While it is difficult , I am convinced that there is nothing more noble and rewarding than this profession . 
 Yes , a little . I know your school is one of the best known in this town . There are about 200 children in the school . 
 She's my roommate , not my date . The D-man , as in dork . 
 Alrighty then . Didn't you use to date Sheryl ? 
 Oh ? I heard she dumped you . Anyway , she's right over there . Oh , Sheryl ! 
 Don ’ t dress like that . You ’ ll make fool yourself . You look stupid in that robe . 
 Maybe it is . But it ’ s out of fashion . 
 Let ’ s go downtown and pick up some fashionable clothes for you . 
 Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer , and you'll be off and running . 
 In that case , let me tell you about some alternatives . 
 For starters , we have a computer lab . 
 The lab is completely free . But you do have to pay a dime a page for printing . 
 Just bring your laptop down here to the lobby . We're set up for wireless right here . 
 Unfortunately , you'll have to go to the computer lab for your printing needs . 
 You know Mr . Forster , this is a really large purchase . I am afraid we can't pay off at one time . We have to pay by installment . 
 Yes , Mr.Forester . 
 We'll start our payment in half a year and the total amount will be paid off within 2 years by three installments . 
 All right . 
 Ok , let's sign it . 
 Certainly . ( Take a table-cloth to her ) 
 A table-cloth of this size and style is 15 Yuan . 
 If you take good care of it , it will last you quite a number of years . 
 Hi , taxi.Could you take me to the financial street , please 
 I want to go to the financial stree . 
 Excuse me , how long does it take to get there ? 
 Oh , does it really a long way to go . 
 No , I'm not.you can just drive slowly and carefully . 
 You are very skillful driver . 
 By the way , is the fair the same for any distance ? 
 Oh , I see . 
 Do you have the ticket with you ? 
 Let me see your ID . 
 You need it to pay your fine . 
 Because , I need to see a photo ID in order to verify who you are . 
 All right , come back and bring your ID . 
 Once you pay it , your record will be cleared . 
 We want someone who can operate the common office equipments and have special skills in photography . 
 What do you think of your own qualification ? 
 I hate computer games . 
 Because they are too violent . Some of them are even disgusting . 
 If boys grow up with computer games , they will surely become bad . 
 It's nice of you to see me off . 
 Thanks . Stop here now . 
 OK , I will . Goodbye and remember to look me up if ever you're in Paris . 
 OK , bye for now ! 
 I go to the fitness center every weekend . 
 To lose some weight . 
 Oh , my God ! I've been cheated ! 
 It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! 
 There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . 
 So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . 
 Yes . 
 I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . 
 Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . 
 He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . 
 C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . 
 You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? 
 I'm tired of your cut-and-dried opinions . Who do you think you are ! 
 Why not ? 
 OK . Good night , then . Have a good sleep . 
 Good afternoon , doctor . 
 I'm an athlete for the Olympic Games here . 
 Let me have a look . You're very lucky because the cut is not deep . 
 Must I stop all my training ? Will I be able to attend the games ? 
 Don't do strenuous exercises until your wound is healed . 
 Not at all . You'll be OK soon . 
 The counter is at the end of the aisle . They are kept in the ice chest . 
 The delicatessen department is on the second floor . 
 Are the expressions of sight draft , time draft , usance draft and letter of credit adequate terms to express the different methods of payment ? 
 What if the sale is made on the basis of sight draft ? 
 Therefore , we must be very careful in building up clear expressions and complete understanding on both sides of trade . 
 I just got a telegram from Margaret and Greg . 
 Yes . They ’ re coming the beginning of August . 
 I ’ m glad they ’ re coming in August . Maybe Greg and I can play some golf or get tickets to a baseball game . 
 Remember the garden party they gave when we were in England ? 
 I had a great time . It ’ ll be good to see them again . 
 In my spare time , I am fond of traveling and I always take a trip with my family . 
 You are deadly right . 
 Good morning , I have an appointment with Mr . Wang Li . 
 But Could you tell me when he will be back ? 
 well , do you think I could leave a message for him ? 
 Let ’ s cross here . 
 Now we have to walk all the way down to the end of the street . 
 I'm exhausted . My new exercise class is so hard , 
 You thing so ? 
 Tomorrow morning . Try it . 
 Are you going to this class this morning ? 
 You're no able to move after this class . 
 You want to bet ? 
 I bet I can go one hour in your class this morning and not feel a thing . 
 Yes , it's true . 
 It's a branch of the Bank of America in Beijing . 
 The applicant must be alert and quick at figures , and like meeting the public . 
 Yes . Because the customers are mostly Americans . 
 Yes , starting salary is 6,000 yuan a month plus bonuses . 
 Where are you planning on looking for one ? 
 I can tell you where I got mine . 
 IKEA has beautiful furniture . 
 The furniture cost a couple thousand dollars . 
 It's very sturdy . You get what you pay for . 
 I assure you that you're paying for quality . 
 I don't know about that . 
 I ’ m sorry . She ’ s in a meeting right now . 
 Can I give her a message for you ? 
 And your name , please ? 
 Certainly . 
 Here you are.Which size do you wear ? 
 Of course.You look terrific in it ! 
 Yes . I sent in my resume at the end of last week . I'm applying for the accounts assistant position . 
 My name is Judy Liao . That's spelled L I A O . 
 Not really . I was in the neighborhood , and I just wanted to stop in to see if you received my resume . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , maybe . The ad in the newspaper said you wanted the resume , a cover letter , and two letters of recommendation . I included those things in the envelope . Is there anything else I should send ? 
 Do you know when they will start setting up interviews for the job ? 
 I see . Well , thank you very much for helping me . You have been very helpful . 
 Thank you . 
 I ’ m looking forward to relaxing this coming weekend . 
 How might you spend the weekend . 
 I might do that too . I hope the weather is nice . I could go and play some golf . 
 Hopefully , we ’ ll both have relaxing weekends . 
 Unfortunately , there ’ s always the possibility of some urgent work requiring our attention . 
 Yes , it is a queer drug , a tonic only available in China . Many ancient Chinese medicine journals have recorded that it can cure such ailments as night sweat , pain at loins and knees and anaemia . It has no side effect . 
 Yes , madam . Fill 3 or 5 pieces of Cordyceps into a cleaned and chopped open duck's head and cook with the whole duck . Or stew Cordyceps with chicken . 
 Please don't eat turnip and garlic when taking this medicine . 
 So awful ! I never fancy my salary is so little . 
 Bingo ! I never thought about that before . I am working so hard and my accomplishment is significant , you know . 
 I know I deserve it , but I can not find a way to talk with boss about this . 
 That sounds reasonable . 
 That's a point . It seems a little complicated . I will think about this for a while . I owe you one . After all , you give me an inspiration . 
 Is this supply ? 
 This is Rachel in Human Resources . I need two boxes of company letterhead , one box of ball-point pens , and a box of envelopes . 
 Have you heard that Mel Gibson was arrested by the police last week ? 
 For suspicion of driving under influence . 
 Finding an excuse is obviously down your alley . And trying to avoid taking care of the children is what you are good at . 
 You are passing the buck . I'll be hanged if I ask you to go to the park with us . 
 I'll help you with your homework . 
 Hey Lydia , what are you reading ? 
 What are you talking about ? Let me see that ... What are horoscopes ? 
 January 5th . 
 That ’ s bogus . I don't feel any stress at work , and my love life is practically nonexistent . This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense . 
 Well , you certainly match those criteria , but they ’ re so broad they could apply to anyone . What does it say about me ? 
 I have been thinking of buying a house and would like to speak with you . 
 I am most interested in Pasadena or Arcadia , but would be open to other suggestions . 
 We have several generations of family living in our household and so need a very large home . 
 It doesn ’ t matter , as we do not have any children . 
 In a perfect world , we would like a home with a view of the lake . 
 Hello . Can I speak to Anne ? 
 It ’ s Mike , her boyfriend . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Does that include some kind of " Love , Amy Card " ? 
 Mmmm ... I'll have to think about it . 
 Who ate the cookies that were sitting here ? 
 Shame on you . I was saving them for your brother . 
 En ... it tastes good . I appreciate what you have done for me . 
 I'm on your side . It needs to be done over . 
 Sure . I've got a copy here . It's due for renewal at the end of next month . We've still got time to look for another supplier if you're not happy . 
 Correct . I have expected to visit here for a long time . So fortunate for me , I can realize this expectation and meet you , Arden , and your kind-hearted staff in your company . 
 That is one of reasons why I am here now . I am really willing to have some cooperation with your company . 
 Please bring your baggage here for inspection . 
 Is all your baggage here ? 
 Have you got anything to declare ? 
 What ’ s up ? 
 Do you mind I have a look at your computer ? 
 Well , it has nothing to do with virus . The problem is your attachment is a bit larger . It has exceeded the e-mail capacity . 
 You can send a compressed one . 
 Yes . This is Janet Smith . I ’ d like to make an appointment with Dr . Mustn as soon as possible . 
 Yes . I ’ Ve got an infected wound . 
 That ’ s fine . 
 I ’ ll bring the card . Thank you very much . 
 Do you like Barry ? 
 I agree . I like his brother Paul . They are not alike . 
 What kind of person do you consider yourself to be ? 
 Oh , I don't think you're shy ! You are always chatting with new people when we go to a party . 
 You're right . I love going out and making new friends . 
 Of course ! 
 I don't know whether she has it bad for me , but she enjoys being with me . 
 I think I do . I don't think I can be happier with another girl . 
 Isn't there some way you could work your schedule out to be here ? 
 How are you going to catch up ? 
 If you miss this class , you will have used up your quota for the semester . 
 Make sure to remind me right before you are absent . 
 Enjoy your day off and don't forget to study ! 
 Park in the visitors ' car park in front of the factory and then go to the gatehouse . It's directly opposite the entrance to the car park . The Security people will sign you in and give you a visitor's badge . My assistant will come down to meet you . 
 What's your name ? 
 How are you , Sam ? 
 Where are you from , Sam ? 
 What is your job ? 
 Are you an outgoing person , or more reserved ? 
 Are you more of a follower or a leader ? 
 What basic principles do you apply to your life ? 
 That was really a nightmare ! 
 I was stuck between 15th and 16th floors in the elevator . 
 I pressed the emergency button ! And then I stayed in the elevator waiting for the rescue . 
 A little bit , but I know that the elevator isn't enclosed . at least I wouldn't be smothered there . 
 Of course , there are 6 other people in the elevator ; they were so scared that someone even started crying . 
 Yes . I have to call the property management . 
 Yes . They should check the elevator regularly . I have to give them something to remember about , and they should also equip fire extinguishers in the building . 
 I know what you mean , but I'd better remind them again , and also remind them to repair the button in the elevator for the disabled people . That has brought the disabled people lots of inconvenience . 
 Yeah . How are you these days ? 
 Not yet . I guess we should send Jim along to talk to the chief since he is such an apple polisher . I am sure he can help . 
 Guess what ? Paul and Susan are engaged . 
 A week ago ? They met last summer and now just sink . They will be married soon . 
 No , not yet . But Susan says they ’ d like to get married in November or December . Then they ’ ll go to Hawaii for their honeymoon . 
 Yeah . It's been raining a lot these days . 
 Have you heard when it's supposed to get better ? 
 That sucks so much . What are we going to do ? 
 I'm with you . What do you have in mind ? 
 That sounds good . They have a movie theatre there , so if we get bored , we can watch a movie . 
 Ok . Don't forget to bring your umbrella . The rain can start up again anytime . 
 What's wrong with it ? 
 Let me see . Did you change anything on your computer ? 
 What kind of anti-virus software do you use ? 
 Are you riding ? You have to install an anti-virus software on your computer . If not , you will be attacked by viruses , and it can lead your computer into failure . 
 How could I feel easy ? I ’ m really pissed . 
 Ok . I ’ ll try my best to calm down first . 
 Would you please help me send these clothes to the laundry ? 
 When will they be ready ? 
 That's fine.Thank you . 
 What an idiot ! 
 I would like to have a hamburger . 
 I don't want cheese on it . 
 I think I'm going to get a soda today . 
 A Sprite sounds good . 
 Let me get a bag of chips too . 
 That's all . 
 Yes , my brakes are not working well . 
 I hear a noise and feel vibrations when step on the brake . 
 I think so . 
 Toyota Corolla 2002 . 
 Do you charge for checking it out ? 
 How long is it going to take ? 
 I'll wait . 
 I think you must have heard wrong.The truth is we are going to be taken over by Trusten.We are being bought out , and our company will be merging with our largest competitor.It ' s not good news at all ... 
 Probably.The new owners will be coming to start alignment meetings nextweek.One of the big question is what to call the new conglomerate company . 
 It's not only the name of our company that will change ... I expect that after this acquisition , there'll be a ton of things up in the air . 
 Good morning , Vera , Nice to meet you . 
 Of course . First you should do up your long hair and do make up but not too thick . 
 Yes , when you attend the interview , you should pay attention to your manner , style of conversation and expression . You should keep smiling always , being polite when you talk with the interviewer . Don't move from time to time when you sit there . And you also should know how to use eye contact . 
 That ’ s all right . Hope you can do better tomorrow . 
 Why ? 
 Yes , they do . Do you have a Christmas tree this year ? 
 I can't now because I have to buy a present for my mother . 
 I don't know when I can come . I'll let you know later . 
 Glad to meet you . This way , please . 
 But it's quite convenient for you to go to any part of the city . The subway is nearby . 
 Hi , Sally ! You are talking to the proud father of a new baby girl ! 
 We ’ Ve named her Alice after my wife ’ s grandmother . 
 Guess what ? I won the speech contest at my school . 
 How do you feel about wearing name logos or slogans on your clothing ? 
 Do you think advertising has an influence on the choices you make when you're shopping ? 
 I actually try to avoid name-brand items . I can't stand it when big companies advertise their products all over the place ! 
 I think is sensible to buy products that is high quality than others when you want to buy something that's going to last a long time , but I don't think it always makes sense . 
 I do for shower items like shower gel and shampoo , but I don't for higher-end items . 
 It's just a slogan for a famous company ; there's nothing really special about it . 
 To each their own ! 
 I ’ m glad you like it . 
 The rent is $ 1050 each month . 
 It isn ’ t too much . 
 I can ’ t take that . 
 I honestly don ’ t know what else to tell you . 
 If you can ’ t afford $ 1050 , then we have no deal . 
 You could get there this way , but it'd be faster to go along the Wort Street . 
 Turn right at the third intersection , you'll see the street and then walk along the street to the south . 
 Just walk for a few minutes , you'll find it . 
 Will you be okay when you immigrate to America ? 
 What about your parents ? 
 There're traffic jam everywhere this hour of the day ! 
 Yeah , we should have more roads built . 
 Do you have any other accounts with this bank ? 
 In that case , we will need to fill out this paperwork . Do you have identification with you ? 
 Yes . Do you know what type of checking account you would like to open , business or personal ? 
 Then you would like the ' no frills ' business account . 
 I'm just shopping . 
 Some new clothes . How about you ? 
 Have you found anything nice yet ? 
 Where'd you get those ? 
 Those are really cute . 
 I would like that . Thank you . 
 I don't have a girlfriend . I'm single . 
 No , I like being single . I never thought lonely , I'm focus on my career . Maybe I'll start to look for my girl when I achieve success . 
 Because I'm living a real world , a man enriched have a good career and make a lot of money . Franklin speaking the girls I've met wounldn't married a man wounldn't make enough money . 
 Good evening . This is Peter in Room 310 . 
 I'm going to Beijing early tomorrow morning . And I'd like to request an early morning call . Will that give you much trouble ? 
 Well , my train is due to take off at 7:25 a . m . I've no idea how long it'll take to drive to the railway station . 
 OK , thank you . 
 I have to use the ATM . 
 I don ’ t know how to use it . 
 I have never used an ATM before . 
 How do I use it ? 
 What ’ s next ? 
 What else do I have to do ? 
 I'm not really accustomed to the style of the new boss . 
 Hello ! Can I help you ? 
 What kind of flowers do you want ? 
 How about rose ? It's the most suitable one for lovers . 
 Well , what about violet ? It means the eternal beauty . 
 what are you doing ? 
 you really like brains that make you think , don't you ? 
 I guess the games I like the most are the ones that I'm good at ! 
 well , I like to play darts . Whenever I go to a bar , I usually play for a few hours . 
 my parents used to love to play checkers and dominoes . We used to have family tournaments every weekend . 
 not at all . I never really did , to be honest . What about you ? Did your family used to play games together ? 
 some of my friends play cards on the internet . Have you ever tried that ? 
 how about mah-jong ? 
 I thought everyone in your country were experts at mah-jong ! 
 My name is Steven Smith and I'm calling to cancel my plane ticket . 
 It ’ s 7 p . m . today . 
 I need to continue to deal with my business . I haven ’ t finished it yet . 
 No . Thank you . 
 OK . I will pay it by my bank card . 
 I would like to speak to Mr . Miles . 
 Yes . Can you tell him Bob White called ? 
 He knows who I am . 
 I can be reached at 544-879-9087 until 5 p . m . today . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , sir . Where to ? 
 All right . 
 Thank you ! I always tune to this program when driving . So what's your favorite program ? 
 But I don't speak English at all . 
 Really ? When is it on ? 
 Thank you so much . I'll try and catch that . 
 Yes , I can also learn about the traffic condition through it . 
 So we should take the advantage of it . 
 Yes . I'd like this shirt to be dry-cleaned . 
 I have to wear it this afternoon . Do you have a urgent service ? 
 OK . How much should I pay ? 
 The environment varies greatly because of difference in language , customs and traditions . 
 But the importance of the export research is often neglected by the managers . 
 Therefore , when enterprises are spending a lot of money in trying to penetrate a new market , they should research whether their products can be sold at high enough a price and in a satisfactory amount . 
 Actually the general manager is regarded as a baby doll . He has much sympathy . 
 Were you one of them ? 
 Have you a wine list ? 
 Oh . I see . Don't you have Mao Tai ? 
 Well , that's fine . Bring us a bottle of that . 
 Not yet . 
 I'd be glad to tell you what I think . 
 If I were you , I would change the beginning . You should write about your education first because we like to judge a man by his abilities . 
 I think it's too short . You'd better say something about your work experience . 
 Very good . But you should talk about your family , too . 
 Excuse me , sir . My baggage is badly damaged . 
 Where can I get it ? 
 The performance is amazing . I'm curious about how they did it . I mean the way they sing . 
 So cool . Someone gave me this flier at the exit . What's it about ? 
 Oh , tell me about it . Anything interesting ? 
 ' The Drunken Beauty ' ? It's funny that we have ' Sleeping Beauty ' in my country . Anyway , what's it about ? Is the beauty a drunkard ? 
 Sure , people do that when they are drunk . What about the actress ? 
 Oh , I've heard about him before . He even created a special dance of sleeve shaking . 
 You know , interest is the best teacher . 
 Please do that . I can't wait to come back again . The performance must be really amazing . 
 That will be great . 
 Pity I haven't . If I can afford it , I'll certainly take a trip abroad . 
 How about going to italy next summer vacation ? 
 What's wrong with you , young man ? 
 I see . You've got a cold . 
 Take this medicine three times a day . 
 Drink a lot of water and have a good rest . You'll be well soon . 
 His grandfather is the richest person in the area . 
 His grandfather's money is not his . 
 How's your father been ? 
 What's wrong with him ? 
 Well , tell him to take it easy and that I hope he feels better . 
 Do you have any particular hobbies , Tom ? 
 I hear many teenagers will spend hours and hours sitting at computers . And they don't care about their own health at all . How about you ? 
 You won't play online games full of violence , will you ? 
 It's no good . And I think spending several hours each day playing computer games is a waste of time . You might as well do something healthy and meaningful . 
 What date will our field trip be on ? 
 Yes , I will make note of that . 
 I will be there half an hour early . 
 Yes , someone is picking me up . 
 Not at the moment — maybe later , though . 
 Well , if it isn't the teacher's pet ! 
 You can't prove that by me . I saw the score on your report . 
 It just happened to be the highest grade in the class . 
 I worked hard too . But she always gives me a lower grade . 
 How about a movie tonight ? 
 Does 7 o'clock suit you ? 
 How about a snack after work ? 
 Would you rather stay home ? 
 Are you really interested in doing something ? 
 Mrs . Phoebe , here are your ordered goods . Please inspect the goods now . 
 Our quality control department is in charge of the inspection , which is directly under general manager . It is essential to attach the importance to the quality of goods . It is the basement for the future cooperation . 
 I realize that now . I will do that after a while . 
 Of course , let me help you . 
 You know , we are superior to other clothes companies . 
 OK . We will manage it later . 
 You mean that he is bad-tempered and often gets angry with you . 
 Do you like the cookies ? 
 Glad you like it . 
 Are you excited about your trip next month ? 
 Why ? 
 Oh really ? I have an uncle who is also terrified of flying . It ' s not that bad though , I mean , it is pretty scary to be in this big machine flying through the air at seven hundred miles per hour . I actually have arachnophobia . 
 I guess that explains why you are afraid of flying , but public speaking is not that bad . 
 Well , I must confess I am a bit claustrophobic . I hate being in an elevator for more than 5 seconds . 
 Would you like to go skating with me this afternoon ? 
 Maybe another time . People say that boys ' dormitories are in a mess , is it true ? 
 It's hard for me to imagine . How can you stand that ? 
 Oh my God , don't you know that such living environment is not healthy ? 
 Three months ? Incredible ! 
 Yes . I have reserved a table for 2 at 7:30 . My name is Bob . 
 Three of our friends will join us so can you seat 5 people at that time ? 
 Thank you . 
 You need to eat healthy foods and avoid unhealthy foods . 
 Fresh fruits and vegetables are important , along with protein and whole grains . 
 You don ’ t want to eat food that is high in fat . You need to avoid caffeine and sugar . 
 Getting 30 minutes of exercise a day is important . If you smoke , you need to stop . 
 Less than a serving of alcohol a day can actually be good for you . Do not overdo it ! 
 With pleasure . What color do you like ? 
 It costs 275 yuan , Miss . 
 Sorry , we don't give discounts . 
 Want to join me for a midnight snack ? I need to grab something to eat . 
 Let's go to the food stall . There's a good one just around the corner . 
 ( Later .. ) Everything looks tempting . What do you want to have ? 
 Can I have a bite ? 
 Super ! 
 I am happy . I just bought a new car . 
 It ’ s a great car . It ’ s very comfortable and it goes really fast . 
 Put it this way – it wasn ’ t cheap . 
 It ’ s red and black . 
 Thanks . I was hoping that you would all enjoy this meal . 
 I got a really wonderful cookbook for my birthday and decided to try out a few of the recipes . 
 I love that dish as well . It is coconut chicken with rice . 
 Yes , that soup has a shrimp base . I also added sea vegetables and lemon grass . 
 I love this wine ! It goes very well with the chicken . 
 Not yet . I seem to move my house to that place . You don't know how tight the schedule is for this trip . 
 Correct ! I have three-day visit to Shanghai on December 10th . 
 I would like a single room with a bath for two nights . Can you help me to reserve a hotel room for me ? 
 What shall we do after the volleyball match ? 
 That's a good idea . I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family . 
 I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must . 
 Is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ? 
 Oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ? 
 Any other ideas ? 
 It all sounds great . We can go there after the match . I can't wait to see what they have . 
 Me too.Recently , I'm fascinated with net-chat . I've made many friends on the net.Every day I talk to them and share many interesting things with them . I really enjoy it . 
 I'm afraid not . Every coin has two sides . I think using internet has a great deal to do with human interaction . 
 Yes , I remember it was inspired by a New York Times best-seller of the same name . 
 Exactly . It reveals the dark side of the all-American meal . 
 I think America really deserves the name of " fast food nation - as people can find McDonald ' s , KFC and Pizza Hut almost all over the States . 
 Sure . You see , Tom , fast food is a lifestyle that craves convenience . People just don't care whether it is healthy or not . 
 What are they ? 
 They're much better 
 That's the point . People usually don't have much time to think about it when they have a on-the-go meal . 
 I suppose so . 
 Could you please fill out this form ? 
 Here's your $ 200 . 
 Thank you . 
 Your car is rather old . Why not change a new one ? 
 Oh , there is a car exhibition tomorrow afternoon . I have two tickets . Would you like to go there with me ? 
 And the bank will offer you loans for twenty years ! 
 Certainly , Mr . Robert . But can I have your plan ? 
 Very good . May I keep it ? I need it to draw up a notice of the meeting and the agenda . 
 You mean you need a more detailed agenda for yourself ? 
 I see . Ok , then where do you think we will have the meeting ? 
 Yes , I will see that the room is ready by Friday . And I will check there are enough chairs , and the lighting and air-conditioning are all right . 
 Sure , I will . What about the minutes ? Do you think I am responsible for that too ? 
 But I am not familiar with the members of the board . 
 That's a good idea . All right , I ’ ll withdraw and get down to it if you don't mind . 
 I ’ m not crazy about it at all . 
 I ’ m not interested in it . Are you keen on it ? 
 I hate it . 
 It ’ s the worst thing I ’ Ve ever tried . 
 Are you thinking about a public school or a private one ? 
 Public schools are usually state funded , whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere . 
 One isn ’ t necessarily better than the other . It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers . 
 Yes , sometimes . 
 I wasn't feeling really well . 
 My stomach was upset . 
 I don't really feel too well yet . 
 No , thanks . I already took some medicine . 
 Thank you . 
 Yeah , I'm afraid so . 
 Yes , it is annoying . 
 Our silks are known for their quality . They are one of our traditional exports . Silk blouses are brightly colored and beautifully designed . They are greatly favored overseas and are always in great demand . 
 Your desire coincides with ours . 
 Thank you for your information . As you know , our corporation is a state-operated one . We always trade with foreign countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit . I have no doubt that it will bring about benefit between us . 
 We will make an offer as soon as possible . I hope a lot of business will be put through between us . 
 I hope everything will be smooth . 
 I will give you the lowest price in the future . 
 Did you watch the volleyball match last night ? 
 Who won ? 
 What is the score ? 
 Wonderful . 
 Great . Well , the main issue here , as you can see , is that our expenses are through the roof . 
 Well , um , sir , the company expenditures on entertainment and travel are out of control . Look at these bills for example . Just this month we ’ Ve paid over twenty thousand dollars for hotel charges ! 
 The list goes on and on . Here , this is a bill for five thousand dollars for spa treatments ! 
 Look at this one sir , eight thousand dollars were spent in one night at a place calledWild Things ? ! 
 Susan has been down recently . I saw her this morning , she looked terrible ! 
 She broke up with her boyfriend . 
 She still loves him . That's why she feels upset . Her love is always hard and confusing ... 
 He sometimes really drives me crazy . 
 not really . Quite boring right now , actually . Mostly infomercials and public service announcements . 
 I know , I know.But my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes . It's the series finals , and I wouldn't miss it for the world ! 
 well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it . 
 I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results . 
 yeah.Oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . It should be good . 
 OK , sir . Your suit will be available in five days . 
 Yes , you should pay half of the cost in advance . 
 I wonder what we should have for dinner this evening ? 
 Yes , I am . I really don ’ t feel much like cooking but the family must eat . 
 So I've noticed . You are putting on a little weight , aren ’ t you ? 
 It ’ s about time . 
 Is that why you didn't return my call ? 
 That's okay . 
 No , I haven ’ t , but I thought about joining the green party . 
 Yes . I was . But I didn ’ t have enough time to devote to it . 
 You ’ re right . But smaller political and pressure groups can often influence large political parties . Any member of parliament can propose legislation and parties and pressure groups can raise awareness 
 That ’ s true . But it ’ s a little strange because the media often reports on political events . You can read about them in newspaper or hear them on tv . 
 Good idea . 
 And then she made the deal with MicroPower . Vince wanted to sell for fifteen million ... 
 That's right . Vince still stops by her office every day to thank her . 
 You really should have stayed with us , Dave . 
 Nope . How's the food there ? 
 I do my shopping at Sons . 
 What's wrong with Sons ? 
 Whole Foods has a lot of organic foods ? 
 I've never been , but I may start shopping there . 
 Thanks for letting me know . 
 The ink should be next to the paper clips and thumb tacks in the stationary section , sir . 
 Then I'm afraid there's none in stock . 
 They come in packages of ten or twenty . 
 On counter three . 
 I know . It took me three weeks , and I work here . 
 Yes . I want to reserve a table for two this evening . 
 Well . In that case , we will have to go to another restaurant . Thank you all the same . 
 Sure , here you are . It comes to $ 84 . 
 No . sir , we charge separately . 
 Many people play sports in China , don't they ? 
 I expect all Chinese can play table tennis . 
 Do you like playing table tennis ? 
 Are indoor sports popular ? 
 Really ? I like playing basketball , too . 
 That's great . 
 What do you have to do to grease the palm of him ? 
 You can go and ask your father . 
 No . She was right . I was too nervous . I kept thinking , What if we blow it ? 
 She even stayed at a different hotel . She said I might be contagious . 
 Excuse me , can I have your passport , your immigration form and your Customs Declaration Form , please ? 
 How long will you be staying at Hotel in China ? 
 And what's the purpose of your visit ? 
 And where will you be staying ? 
 OK . Could you put your hand baggage on the counter , please ? Do you have any gifts , or food in here ? 
 I'm sorry , sir , you can't bring fresh fruit into China . I'm going to have to confiscate these . 
 What are you doing ? 
 Do you have anything to wash ? 
 OK . They will be ready by 7:00 
 Of course , sir . We will press all the clothes when they are cleaned . 
 It's an ugly day today . 
 It's the middle of summer , it shouldn't rain today . 
 Yeah , especially since it's ninety degrees outside . 
 Yes , it would be . 
 Me too . I can't wait until winter . 
 I'd rather be cold than hot . 
 Good morning , Mr . Green . Please have a seat . I received your resume last Monday and I would like to say I ’ m very impressed . 
 May I asked why you are interested in working for us ? 
 Oh , did he ? 
 Would you mind telling me a little bit about your present job ? 
 Do you think you are the right candidate for this position ? 
 Why do you think you ’ re the right candidate for this position ? 
 Well , you might be the person we ’ Ve been looking for . Do you have any questions ? 
 At the end of this month . 
 You ’ ll be supervising six brokers who manage a combined total of 310 accounts . 
 Two weeks of paid vacation in your first year of employment . You ’ re also eligible for medical and dental insurance . And we offer a generous retirement pension plan after 10 years of service . Do you have any other questions ? 
 Well , I ’ ll have to discuss your application with my colleagues , and we ’ ll get back to you early next week . 
 It was nice to meet you , too . And thanks for coming in today . 
 No , but those guys like to hit on me . 
 Great . Thank you . 
 I need to withdraw some money . 
 I need to withdraw $ 300 . 
 I want to take it from my checking account . 
 Thank you very much . 
 No . That ’ ll be all . 
 Do you have Chinese medicine here ? 
 Can I have this prescription filled here ? 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 Of course . 
 Some are genuine . But all our reproductions are clearly marked and priced . 
 It ’ s hard to believer you ’ re really retiring . What are you going to do with yourself ? 
 Well , good luck . Give me a ring sometime , and let me know how you are . 
 Oh shame ! I have a class tomorrow . 
 Yeah . Thanks . And have fun ! 
 Yes . What a good job we have done ! 
 Many customers didn't want them . 
 Good idea . 
 I'm not sure , but still it did attract a large crowds today . 
 But people can just throw them into the trash can as they turn around . 
 Anyway , let's just finish out job and get back home . 
 What are your plans for this weekend ? 
 If the weather's fine . 
 I know a good place to hire bikes if you want . 
 But remember , be careful when you ride a bike . The traffic in Beijing can be dangerous . 
 I am so sorry to hear that sir , let me check and see what is available , what room are you in now ? 
 Oh , dear , well , it looks like we have a few rooms available , can I put you into a room on the 17th floor ? It has a balcony and it doesn ’ t face the highway . 
 Let me check you out of your old room , you have to sign here , and acknowledge these changes and also the charges to your previous room . Then I can hook you right up to room 1780 . 
 Lisa , can I call Taiwan ? 
 I miss my parents . 
 Can you show me how to make an overseas call ? 
 That's 886 . 
 In my opinion , it may be necessary to charge for participation . 
 Then what is your opinion ? 
 When will our party be held ? 
 Have you sent out invitations by our party ? 
 When ? 
 Could Dr.Cole like to attend the party ? 
 That's fine . 
 Oh , please sit down . What university did you graduate from ? 
 What was your major at college ? 
 Can you name some of the courses you completed in relation to accounting ? 
 What kind of work are you doing now ? 
 What are your responsibilities in your present work ? 
 Are you familiar with the PRC Financial and Tax Regulations ? 
 Can you tell me something about this balance sheet now ? 
 What's the creditor's equity ? 
 Yesterday I had a deal with a vice manager . He acts like the point man . 
 Does it look too big ? 
 Yes , I like it . I'm going to get it . 
 Here's my credit card . 
 Yes . Here you are . 
 Excuse me , may I help you ? 
 Sure . Which kind of gas do you want ? 
 OK . 
 Johnson ? I can't place them . 
 They've completely slipped my mind . 
 No , I don't recall a thing about them . 
 Hmm , I must be getting absent-minded . 
 The price quoted is for CIF . 
 Yes , that is correct . We will arrange for the shipping costs and insurance policy . 
 Yes , we could also make this arrangement , , if you prefer . 
 I'd like to take some money from my Fund Account at the Securities Company . Is that possible here ? 
 Here it is . Could I make a balance enquiry , please ? 
 Fine , I'll take 10,000 RIB , please . 
 Thank you very much . 
 It ’ s a skill . What can I say ? I don ’ t know why , I just have a long routine . 
 Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , butoften times I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine . 
 Not funny . 
 Yes . I'm looking for some perfume . Do you have perfumes with a light scent ? 
 It does smell good , How much is it ? 
 OK . I'll take this one . 
 Actually , I don't like history . Lately , these shows are always about the Pyramids . 
 And nobody knows who built them , right ? It's a total mystery ! 
 You sure are buying a lot of things online . 
 What are the advantages of buying online ? 
 The idea of doing it at night is interesting . Maybe I'll try it some day . 
 Well , frankly speaking , I am running a little behind . It's 40 % done . 
 I have little chance to communicate with colleagues when I have problems . They are always too busy to help a green hand like me . 
 I did . But I am so depressed because there is nobody that will help me . 
 I see your point , but I seem to be on bad terms with them . 
 Thank you so much . 
 That's a good idea . I can learn many useful things from books . 
 Well , I will do it better . 
 Thanks very much . I promise I will work harder . 
 I need to get on the Internet . 
 Yes , I have it . 
 That ’ s okay . 
 Then what do I need to do ? 
 What do I do to log on to the computer ? 
 Okay . Thanks for your help . 
 I've never really thought about it before . I guess it doesn't bother me . 
 I guess so . I usually buy name-brand clothing , shoes , and electronic goods . How about you ? 
 Mary , can you help me set the table ? 
 This is usually my chore . 
 We need to set the table for four . 
 That's right . Mom didn't know where to buy chopsticks for you . 
 OK . Come back into the classroom , class . 
 Yes , but to the heath , this break has long enough . 
 Come on , baby . It ’ s time now . 
 Hurry up , little boy . 
 So why is the face tilted to the right ? 
 So it's not as convenient for left-handed people ? 
 I'm left-handed . You bought that watch so that I won't borrow it ... 
 Room service . May I come in ? 
 Mr . Green ? 
 OK.If you need anything , just call the Room service . 
 Just leave them outside the door . We will take care of it . 
 Which of the two do you think is better ? I mean , what's the difference between them ? 
 I only want it for the kitchen . I like to listen to the news at breakfast time . 
 Hmm ... I'd like the cheaper one , please . Can I pay hy cheque ? 
 Espresso is made with a machine that forces steam and boiling water through finely ground coffee . It's strong . 
 Cappuccino is one-third espresso and two-thirds a mixture of steamed milk and froth . 
 If you want something manly , stick with the espresso . 
 Either we'll be millionaires , or we won't ... won't have a dime . 
 The only person who seems confident the software will be done on time is Zina . 
 Failure just isn't an option for her . I'm glad she's on our team . 
 It's this high-tech equipment that doctors my voice a little . Actually , i am tone-deaf . 
 Well , the echo and the stereo system helped a lot . And i know that song very well , so , i didn't need to pay attention to the subtitles which helped as well . 
 Pick the one that you always sing in the shower . 
 Read me the index number ! 
 No . I need a rest ! 
 Just calm down . I'm sure you'll do well . 
 Joan is a thorough drag ! 
 She keeps talking when I'm reading .

 Yes , here is my ID card . 
 Hi . My name is Dolma . 
 Good to meet you too . 
 Okay , Bob , when will I see you ? 
 Okay , I'll see you later . 
 They wanted to go out , and so they made me look after my baby brother . 
 No , I didn't . My brother was very good and I did quite a lot of homework . 
 Not really . I watched television for an hour . 
 Boxing . It was excellent . 
 What did you do last night ? 
 Thank you very much for your dinner . 
 My wife is expecting me at home . I must be off now.So long !

 I'm a freelance English teacher . How about you ? 
 what kind of job are you looking for ?

 did you write a clear objective in your resume ? 
 I think you need to update your CV . Bring it over to my office tomorrow and I'll help you with it . 
 In my wedding ceremony , where do my parents sit in the church ? 
 Do friends of the bride always sit on one side of the church and friends of the groom on the other ? 
 I need somebody to come over and fix my internet . 
 For some reason it's just not connecting . 
 It hasn't been working the past few days . 
 It does , but it won't connect to anything . 
 Could you send someone to fix it today ? 
 When will they be here ? 
 What's your weight ? 
 Do put yourself on a diet , otherwise you'll be too fat . 
 What are your terms of payment ? 
 What if we purchase an increased quantity ? Can you give us better terms ? 
 We do not have the space in our warehouse to store over 5,000 units . 
 Good afternoon . I'll show you to your room . 
 Could you tell me which bags are yours ? 
 Could you wait a moment ? I have to get a trolley . May I see your room key , please ? 
 Thank you . Room 402 . You're on the 4th floor . This way , please . 
 I see.That ’ s all right . Don ’ t put the blame on yourself .

 The park is so beautiful . It is a good thing I have taken the camera . 
 All right . Give me a big smile . Are you ready ? Cheese ! 
 Excuse me , sir . Could you take a photo for us ? Just press this button . 
 Thanks . 
 It's the fourth one this year . Isn't it horrible . 
 It may take many years for the trees to grow . I hope people will stop cutting down trees . 
 But we can't destroy our forests to get the wood . 
 Sorry , he is in the middle of something . Can I take a message ? 
 Could you please speak in a louder voice ? There may be something wrong with your receiver . 
 Take me to this address , please . 
 How much do I owe you , sir ? 
 Are you kidding ? The meter says 15 dollars , doesn't it ? 
 I don't get it . I'll go and have that doorman talk to you then . 
 Hi , Becky , what's up ? 
 What's the problem ? 
 For example ? 
 No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen . 
 My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun . 
 Yes , my friends like to get along with me well . 
 Yes , I like to make new friends . 
 We like to get together , chat and enjoy beautiful music . 
 I really like the straight legs . 
 I don't like the way they sag down . I feel like I have plumber butt in them . 
 What if someone got it in their head to give them a tug ? What then ? 
 If you ask me , it's a walking invitation ! 
 There is no one here by that name . 
 No , this is 2517759 . 
 That's all right . 
 Yes , hello , I would like to make a reservation please .

 You can pay here . 
 It is one hundred and fifty . This is your bill . 
 Yes . 
 Thank you . 
 As in many countries , there ’ s been a big growth in anything related to computers . Young people are attracted to that field in particular . There ’ s also been a big growth in education . 
 The interesting thing is that many of the teachers are not actually trained teachers . They are usually professionals who are taking a break from their jobs to pass on skills to others . 
 In my country , they are usually studying something business-related , such as marketing , management techniques , and human resource management . 
 That trend has already begun in my country . In particular , there ’ s a big demand for people to work in fitness centers . Which kinds of jobs are less in demand ? 
 Yes . My country is certainly expanding in the service and hi-tech sectors , but contracting in the heavy industry and primary industry sectors . However , our car and aircraft manufacturers are doing very well . 
 What did you do today ? 
 Did you win ? 
 What is the correct time , please ? 
 When will you lecture begin ? 
 Why do you stop me ? 
 I'm sorry . 
 I don't know . 
 You're looking very well . 
 Do you often exercise ? 
 What style of swimming do you like best ? 
 I think butterfly stroke is the most difficult style to learn . 
 Oh , no . I am quite a stone in the water and cannot swim . 
 I have a sore throat and headache . 
 Yes , my whole body feels weak . And I really feel terrible . 
 Ok , go ahead . 
 Eat some more . 
 Any idea about James ? He ’ s a pain in the neck . 
 Oh , is that so ? 
 Here is your ticket . Let's get in the museum . 
 I can't agree more . I think we'd better hire a guide so that we can learn more . 
 Amelia , could you spare a few minutes ? 
 well , I wanted to let you know that I've put in my notice . 
 it's complicated . But basically it boils down to one thing . This company is downsizing and I can't continue working for a company that may let me go . 
 well , to be honest , there's another reason . I've got a better offer . 
 the head office is in New York , but I'll be dealing with overseas companies and flying to this side of the world from time to time . 
 I have . I feel lucky . I look forward to dealing with overseas companies and at the same time having a chance to use English more . 
 of course I can . In fact , if there are other job opportunities at this new company , I'll recommend you personally . 
 Cathy , I'd like to introduce the new microwave stove of mine to you , because it is easy to use . 
 This microwave stove has many functions . Let me show you . For example , if you want to cook meat , you just need to put meat in it , and press the button with a picture of meat , that ’ s OK . After several minutes , you can eat the delicious meat . 
 Oh , it is not so expensive . It only costs me 280 dollars . 
 Oh , no ... 
 Jen , is there someone you're not telling me about ? 
 Women are such dreamers . 
 What do you want to do tonight ? 
 I have no idea . Do you think we're in a rut ? 
 Well , we do the same things every weekend . We go to the same restaurants . We see the same friends . You know what I mean ? 
 Okay , I'll look in the events section of the paper to see what's going on tonight . Hmm , we could go to a concert . There is a good one tonight . I bet it's not sold out . But , we'll have to drive an hour to the venue . 
 I'm not really in the mood for dancing , actually . You know what ? I just feel like staying home tonight and vegging , after all . How about you ? 
 Yeah , definitely , tomorrow night . 
 Yes . Flight DB117 departs at 5:38 pm and arrives in New York at 6:00 am with a layover in Chicago . It also makes a refueling stop at Colombia . 
 Sorry sir , it is the only flight wa have right now . 
 Call me John . This is a great area of the city for shopping . There ’ s a grocery store just around the corner . 
 Well , the Riverside Mall has 200 stores in it , including four major department stores . 
 Yes , on 4th street , near the movie theater there are many specialty shops , including clothing boutiques . 
 Yes , it ’ s a really nice neighborhood . 
 Well , I'd like to , but I am not sure I have time . 
 All right , just a quick one . 
 Happy New Year , Thomas . How many joys nice drinks with us , will you ? 
 First , I am going to get ready for the parade , I have a great costume . Then later today , I am going to church . If you want , I can give you a costume , and you can be at parade too . It will be fun 
 My father likes to go , and I told him I will go with him . 
 Lots of people especially seniors like to go to church , and attend the evening service . 
 Of course . 
 Lobster ? It is steamed and served with our special sauce . 
 Sure . It is a most popular dish . 
 I want to go to china for sight-seeing . What do you think of it , Mum ? 
 Will you go with me , too ? 
 Have you heard who got elected ? 
 Our new President is John McCain . 
 I was just as shocked when I found out . 
 The people have spoken . 
 If you don ’ t like that , then you ’ re probably going to be mad at what I tell you next . 
 I was just joking , and Obama is our new President . 
 Ms . Wang , this is Mr . Cooper , president of Ivy Publishing . 
 Nice to meet you , Ms . Wang . You must be exhausted after your long trip from Canada . 
 Fair-Priced Fares , how may I help you ? 
 When did you plan to go , sir ? 
 The second week of September is still in the high-season , so the cheapest tickets are $ 650 . The high season lasts until the 15th , so fares after that date are cheaper . 
 Our cheapest ticket is $ 550 on American Airlines . 
 Do you need any help ? 
 I like xeroxing . 
 OK , I will get right to that . 
 I just started working here . 
 I'd like to , but I am very busy . 
 What are you thinking about ? 
 Again ! 
 Next , please . 
 Yes , the rate for cash purchases is listed on the electronica screen , so you have seen the rate of exchange . 
 How much do you like to exchange ? 
 In what denominations ? 
 Right , I will exchange for you now . Please sign the exchange form giving the name and telephone . 
 OK , wait for a moment . Well , I am sorry , but we are not authorized to exchange coins because it is low and we do not have enough foreign coins . In this case , you'd better change 2,000 $ to Swiss francs . 
 Please sign the memo on the bottom and keep your money and memo . 
 Excuse me , do you know the shortcut to the Lincoln park ? 
 Thank you very much . Is the back gate open now ? 
 Does your wife work ? 
 Oh , I understand . She cooks , cleans and takes care of children . Is that right ? 
 You are really a hen-pecked husband . 
 Everything seems to be getting worse . I don't know what to do with it . 
 But how can I prevent a deficit ? 
 OK , OK . I ’ ll do my best . 
 I know life is not all roses , and I believe I will pull this through . 
 What do you think of your personality ? 
 Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ? 
 How do you get along with people whose characters are different from your own ? 
 Excuse me.Would you like a drink before your meal ? 
 Would you like a drink ? 
 OK.Here you are . 
 Well , all the drinks including beer are free of charge . 
 Don't worry.We will come back again a little later . 
 Four weeks . 
 I'm here on business . 
 I import canned food . 
 We mostly handle office furniture . We supply first-class furniture . Here are our catalogue and the pattern books . You can see the material is superior and with all the latest styles . Can you give me some idea about what you're looking for ? 
 The price varies somewhat according to the size of your order . Would you tell us the quantity you want so that we can work out an offer ? 
 It's our pleasure to do business with you . We'll let you have the offer next Wednesday at the latest . 
 Why do you look so gloomy ? What are you looking for ? 
 Did you finish typing yesterday ? 
 Don't worry about it . It must be somewhere in your room . Let's see where you put it . Have you searched your drawers and the desk ? 
 How about the shelf ? 
 Don't get upset over it . At least you have another week to go . 
 Cheer up ! What I meant was that you can find it sometime during a week . There is no need to write a new one . Oh , what's this ? Is this your dissertation ? 
 You ’ Ve put it among these journals . 
 How good are you at sports , Bill ? 
 Wow ! 
 Oh , yes . I like to exercise . But I don ’ t watch sports or buy sports magazines . I don ’ t have much time to do those things . 
 Well , I guess I exercise about two hours a day . I do aerobics three times a week , and the other days I play badminton 1 with my husband . I always feel good afterward . 
 Well , why don ’ t you try to get some exercise ? It ’ s difficult , but very rewarding . 
 Dad , can you lend me some money ? 
 I want to get a ticket for a concert tonight . 
 Excuse me . I'm looking for Bluemingdails . Could you tell me how to get there ? 
 Left the next junction . Ok . 
 Thanks very much . 
 I ’ m going to put it on this table , Sam . 
 What are you going to do with it ? 
 Be careful . Don ’ t drop it ! Don ’ t put it there , Sam . Put it here , on this shelf . 
 Those flowers are lovely , too . 
 Yes.May I have some more beer ? 
 Yes , the meal was very delicious and I enjoyed very much . I'm full . 
 By the way , Miss.Where is the toilet ? 
 What ? 
 Don't you wish to employ RIB of ours ? US Dollars might be adopted . 
 I will give you a definite answer on the price terms two days later . 
 How nice of you to remember ! 
 You're so thoughtful.Thank you . 
 I ’ m fine , Celia . And you ? 
 Do you have a lot of homework ? 
 Of course I do ! 
 I ’ m studying for my chemistry exam tomorrow . 
 Yes . Are you ? 
 Do you want to study together ? 
 Do you want to go to an empty classroom ? 
 OK . Let ’ s go ! 
 Yes.It ' s sometimes scary if you think of the tremendous amount of media we face every day . 
 Which financial magazines and newspapers do you think do the best job of checking facts ? 
 I like to read Fortune . 
 Where does a broadcast company get most of their information ? I hope it's not just from press releases . 
 But sometimes when a flimsy report , or even a rumor gets on television , there's going to be a terrible ' echo chamber ' effect . 
 Do you want to hear a funny joke ? 
 Well , you'll see . 
 OK , an Englishman , a Scotsman , and an Irishman were going on a trip across the desert , and they could only take one thing with them . 
 So they met up at the start of the journey and showed each other their equipment . 
 Hang on , I haven't finished yet . 
 Well , as I was saying , they showed each other what they had decided to bring . The Englishman had brought some water . " If we get thirsty , we'll have something to drink , " he said . The Scotsman brought a map . " If we get lost , we'll be able to find our way . " The Irishman had brought a car door . 
 Yep . A car door . " Why the door ? " the others asked him . " Well , " he said , “ If it gets hot , we can open the window . " Do you get it ? 
 Have you ever made any plan for your future ? 
 Not me . I'd like to be a bachelor forever . 
 Judy , what do you think of the new general manager ? 
 I heard he's very clear about his likes and dislikes and he's not the type to just let things go , so don ’ t provoke him . 
 Me too , I don't know why , but every time I see the guy , I break into a cold sweat . 
 Whatever we said , we must be more careful . 
 Are these your triplets ? They ’ re beautiful ! I ’ Ve seen other babies who were nothing but skin and bones at their age . You know , they ’ re absolutely identical of you and John ! Are you planning on having any more ? 
 Well , tell me . How was the labor and delivery ? 
 Well , hang in there . In twenty years , you ’ ll fell it was well worth it ! 
 You mean , what's happening ? Well , constable , I'm trying to get out of the windowand Fred here is helping me . 
 Well , you see I can't find the key and I'm in a hurry . Come on , Fred , We're wasting time . 
 No , it's my brother's . I'm staying with him for a while . 
 I'm afraid not . He's in jail for house-breaking at the moment . 
 But Mom ! Today we ’ re playing football ! I love football ! 
 I don ’ t know . It was there when I woke up this morning . 
 I bashed it against the chair in my room . 
 A little , but not much . 
 If I ’ m better this afternoon , can I go to school ? 
 What's happening in your life ? 
 That sounds great . 
 Hello , IMPF Bank , how can I help you ? 
 OK Sir . Could you tell me the account holder's name , the account number , the amount in the account and your PIN number , please ? 
 OK , Sir . Almost there , I just need your PIN number . When we issue you with a new card and book we would recommend that you change your PIN number . It's a very simple procedure . 
 I think we have had a very pleasant conversation , haven't we ? 
 Do you have any other questions ? 
 I'm sorry we can't now . 
 Maybe the company will build dormitory for the employees in the future . 
 Anything else ? 
 I'm sorry we won't do so for a new employee . We only provide this benefit to employees who have made significant contributions to the company . 
 Yes , we will , and the staff will have a chance to travel every year . 
 I want to subscribe to The New York Times.How do you feel about it ? 
 Yes , It's supposed to be outstanding . 
 And the problem is , sir ? 
 My apologies , sir . We'll give you a new room and refund the value of your current room . 
 We always try to serve our guests in the most agreeable way possible . 
 Yes , the snow is often falling thick and fast here . 
 Yes , It's really so beautiful with all the things covered by snow . 
 There are so many places around . Take a look at the advertisement . 
 Good . I love Chinese food . What did you order ? 
 Maybe we can find a place to learn some Chinese cooking . I hear there's a place in Chinatown where you can take some courses . Are you interested ? 
 You are right . But I just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different . 
 I am not cheating . When you pass go , you collect $ 200 , Everyone knows that ! 
 Banker ? 
 Can I have my $ 200 please ? 
 Hello . My name ’ s Linda Brown . What can I do for you today ? 
 Certainly . First , I would like to ask you some questions to identify your needs before I show you what we have . 
 What price range are you interested in ? 
 Okay . Do you have a special location in mind ? 
 When would you like to move in ? 
 How about the end of this month ? 
 Are there any special features that you would like to have , such as , a dishwasher , a balcony , a swimming pool , central air conditionining , etc . ? 
 Okay . Here are the photos of the apartments that fit your preferences . 
 Yes . It ’ s only 5 minutes walk from the campus . 
 Do you know what you want to eat for lunch ? 
 I want to get some pizza . 
 Tell me what you want to eat . 
 See , I had a burger for lunch yesterday . 
 How about I get pizza and you get a burger ? 
 Where do they sell both at ? 
 Excuse me , could you tell me how much is the ticket ? 
 That's great ! 
 Hi , I have a doctor ’ s appointment scheduled with Dr . Smith , and I need to change it . 
 My appointment was on Tuesday . 
 It was for two o ’ clock in the afternoon . 
 I would like to switch it to next Friday . 
 I would like to come in at 10 
 I'm looking for some fresh produce that's on sale . 
 Mangoes . What are they ? 
 Can you eat the nut ? 
 How much are they ? 
 What does a mango taste like ? 
 How do I know if it's ripe ? 
 Where do they come from ? 
 I like pop music very much . 
 I said I like pop music very much.It ' s so lovely . 
 Sir , I want to ask for a leave for five days . Here is the request form . 
 Yes , I need to go home to have a family reunion . 
 Yes , sir . I remember it . But our Chinese usually celebrate the New Year on lunar calendar . 
 Lee , I'm going to get married next month . 
 You are invited to my wedding . 
 Have you heard that Tom and his wife divorced ? 
 Really ? Say it ! 
 Yeah , quite right . Gambling broke up a happy family . 
 Besides that , many people took to gambling and got in over their heads , and gradually ruined themselves . 
 Can I help you ? 
 There are so many here.The men with red hats are the porters . 
 Well , it depends how many pieces of luggages you have . 
 I'd like to reserve a table for three this evening . 
 Do you have pot service at noon ? 
 OK , we'll come at half past eleven tomorrow . 
 Black . 
 Good morning . Welcome to Time After Time Watches . 
 Well , you've come to the right place . What kind of watch are you looking for ? 
 Hmm ... This Rolex ? $ 1,000 . 
 This one is $ 500 . 
 You must be very busy these days . I heard you are responsible for the meeting arrangements this time . It can be the most important meeting for our company this year . 
 Do we still use the conference room in the same hotel as last time ? You remember ? I like that one . 
 Good preparation will improve the effectiveness of the meeting . I am sure that your hard work will pay off . 
 Yes , I think so . If you want to graduated this year , you've got to take a science course . 
 Well , I have to take biology , chemistry , maps and physics . What you need is a good introductory course for non-science majors . 
 That's a problem . 
 The ceremony will begin at 9 0 ' clock . After the ceremony , there's a reception . By the way , do you know why they have chosen September 9th for their wedding ceremony ? 
 As in English , Chinese also has some lucky numbers . The number 9 stands for perpetuity in Chinese . 
 If she has , they must be fair-weather friends . 
 She'd better keep away from them . 
 Sure . It ’ s on basement level one . Turn right when you get off the elevator . 
 No problem , John . 
 Daddy , what seasonings are you going to cook the meat with ? 
 What ? Are you kidding ? 
 I remember Mom going with a lot of pepper for the meat . 
 Oh , hello , Tom ! Beautiful day , isn ’ t it ? 
 Merry Christmas ! 
 Are you doing anything special ? 
 Oh . I'm just going to take it easy . 
 Not yet . But do you have any experience as an assistant ? 
 OK . It sounds fine . 
 I have a major stomachache 
 I had spaghetti with clam sauce for lunch . 
 Yes , that could have been it , but I haven ’ t been feeling that great for the past few days . 
 Not really . Things have been going OK . 
 I think that I might be getting the flu . 
 Nice to meet you , Andrew . I am Noirin , Noirin O'Neil . 
 Noirin , N-O-I-R-I-N , it's an Irish name . 
 I won't do it again . Please forgive me . 
 Can you manage chopsticks ? 
 Good mastery . How do you like our Chinese food ? 
 What's wrong with MSG ? It helps to bring out the taste of the food . 
 Oh , don't let that worry you . If that were true , China wouldn't have such a large population . 
 I don't know exactly . It's a tradition . Maybe it's for sanitary reasons . 
 I can give you one for $ 30 a day or $ 200 a week . 
 May I see your driver's license ? 
 OK . You'll have to use a credit card or leave a $ 100 deposit . 
 Of course not . People all over the world watch it on TV , or listen to it on the radio . 
 Yes , I went to the New Year ’ s Concert in 2010 . 
 That's for sure . You know , I had the greatest time ever . 
 I'm sorry I've already gone through my paycheck for the week . 
 May I help you ? 
 Please fill in the slip , stating the exact amount you wish to withdraw . 
 Your ID card , please . 
 Do you want large ones or small ones ? 
 Wait a minute , please ... Here's the cash . 
 Well , sir . According to today's exchange rate , every pound in cash is equivalent to 1.89 U . S . dollars . How much would you like to change ? 
 ... OK . And here's your money . 
 Goodbye . 
 I'm just watching some television . 
 Me too . Do you think we are boring people ? 
 That's right . What do you think we should do as a hobby ? 
 I like to play the piano for fun . 
 Hobbies are great . I'm going to make a list of all the things I like to do . 
 Has your family lived here for long ? 
 You have a fantastic view . 
 Look ! You can see the village way down in the valley . 
 Good morning , sir . May I help you ? 
 Excuse me , sir , but are you Mr . Richard of World Trading Company ? 
 I ’ m sorry , Mr . Richard . Mr . Johnson is on his way to the office . He had just called and asked you to wait a minute . 
 Would you like something to drink , sir ? Do you prefer coffee or tea ? 
 Here you are , Mr . Richard . This is the cream and this is the sugar . If there ’ s anything else you ’ d like , please don ’ t hesitate to tell me . 
 Oh , my god ! My wallet is lost . What should I do ? It drives me bonkers . 
 I booked a double room for tonight . My name is Ruth Joy . 
 Sally , what do we have for dinner 
 Well , I quit breakfast , so I had a rich brunch . I feel like having something mild for dinner 
 Noodles are fine . Or maybe I'll have some porridge . 
 Wait a moment , I would like to take some snapshots here . 
 It's so beautiful here . I want to stay longer . 
 That's all right . 
 sure , I am a total internet junkie , I can't survive without internet . 
 well , there are a lot of things , like reading news , email , shopping , etc . but mostly I chat online . You could say I'm addicted to online chatting . 
 well , basically it's similar to face-to-face chat , but you type instead of talk . You should try it at least once . 
 to people all over the world ! I have a lot of net pals . See , the magic of internet is that it connects people from all over the world . You can chat with someone thousands of miles away as if they were 
 well , my suggestion for a newbie like you is that don't get lost in the cyberspace . You know internet won't do the filtration for you , so you still need to use your judgement . There are a lot of per 
 I found an apartment to rent . 
 I found it in today ’ s apartment ads . 
 I actually found it in the ads , and it ’ s not too expensive either . 
 All you really need to know is that the apartment looks great . 
 Every month I ’ d only have to pay $ 725 . 
 It is , isn ’ t it ? 
 And so , I just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are with this project . As you know , you ’ Ve missed a fairly significant deadline last week , and this will negativity impact the team ’ s ability to move forward with the next stages of this project . 
 Oh , come on ! An excuse like that is tantamount to lying . You ’ re essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues , rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks . 
 I ’ m not going to accept this excuse . You ’ re using these small technical glitches as a crutch and trying to rationalize the fact that you ’ Ve missed your deadline . Look , we have standards and I expect you to live up to those standards . No more phoney cases . If you ’ re in over your head , you tell me . No more missed deadlines . Now , I want that data on my desk by nine am ! 
 Not quite . The software engineers are testing it just now . 
 Yes , most of them . We trained on a dummy system last month . A couple of people were away so we've organised two more training sessions on the live system for the whole team this week . 
 He's a little sick under the weather . 
 He has the flu . 
 I will . 
 Well , it's forty pings including the balcony . See . It's huge . 
 This balcony is perfect for barbecuing . 
 I'm sorry . No pets are allowed in this apartment building , except fish . 
 Hey , let's go out and grab a couple of beers tonight ! 
 Nigel , you sure lead a dog's life , what's up with that ? 
 What courses are you taking ? 
 What do you think about the teachers ? 
 That's too bad . Do you have any foreign teachers ? 
 What is he like ? 
 Are you able to follow him ? 
 Oh , that's good ! He sounds like a good teacher . 
 Hi , Bob , what time will you be home tonight ? 
 Why ? What's the problem ? 
 Passport and disembarkation card , please . 
 What is your purpose of visiting ? 
 How long are you staying here ? 
 All right . Thank you . 
 Sure . The twenty-ninth is out . I ’ ll be out of the office all day at a seminar . Either the twenty-eighth or the thirtieth is fine . 
 Sounds good to me . You make up the invitations , I ’ Ve got run . I ’ Ve got a meeting in five minutes . 
 Yet Julia is not a patch on Anne because she's not as diligent and clever as Anne . 
 Could I have the check , please ? 
 Hey , Tom . You look tired . Are you all right ? 
 How come ? 
 Don't you like games 
 Me too . Recently , I've made many friends on the net . Every day I talk to them and share many interesting things with them . 
 I'm afraid not . To me getting in touch with each other has more fun than the coolest computer games or the hottest information . 
 May I help you ? 
 Do you need anything else ? 
 This is all you want to check out ? 
 I ’ m going to need your library card . 
 You ’ ll need to take care of the video . 
 We will fine you if you damage it . 
 Can I help you , Miss ? 
 OK , tell me your friend's name . 
 What was that ? 
 How did it happen ? 
 It was my favorite . 
 Maybe I shouldn't have put it here . Someone was bound to bump it eventually . 
 Excuse me , madam . May I see your ticket , please ? 
 Where are you going ? 
 Where did you begin your journey ? 
 OK . Here you are . 
 We'll get there around 7:45 in the morning . 
 Do you like watching the Winter Olympic Games ? 
 Of course I do . I love it . All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable . 
 Yeah . What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics ? 
 I see . Then , what's your favorite winter sport ? 
 Then you must know Shen Due and Hao Hongbo . 
 You should go to talk with May . She is a big fan of them too . 
 Good morning.This is Mary.Can I speak to Anne please ? 
 Thank you.But I will call her later 
 Goodbye . 
 I ’ Ve been feeling a little light-headed lately . 
 If I have high blood pressure , it is news to me . 
 What do you use to check for high blood pressure ? 
 What does the reading tell you ? 
 I hope that the test results show me to be really healthy . 
 I ’ m here as a tourist . 
 Yes , it ’ s a small world . We never know where we ’ ll meet someone we know . 
 I enjoy drawing and painting . 
 Yes , I do . 
 I learned back in high school . 
 Yeah , I loved that art class . 
 Thank you very much . 
 I'm sure you have a talent . It's just hidden . 
 You're kidding ! 
 Sure , go ahead . 
 I don ’ t have much contact with them . 
 No , I don ’ t . I ’ m too afraid of making mistakes in English . I don ’ t want to be laughed at . 
 Thanks for the advice . I guess you ’ re right . It ’ s just hard to overcome my shyness . I really will try from now on . I promise . 
 But mine equals yours in economy . 
 how's it going ? 
 to be honest , I'm a bit fed up . 
 well , my boyfriend was supposed to call me last night , but he never did . 
 the thing is , this isn't the first time he's promised to do something and then didn't . 
 a bit ? I'm extremely annoyed that he didn't phone me when he promised me that he would ! He's such a liar . 
 I don't know . I've got mixed feelings about it . On the one hand , I really want to end it with him , but on the other hand , I don't want to be without him . 
 in the long run , I think breaking up with him would make me much happier , but I know that I'll be depressed about it for a few weeks first . 
 what would you do if you were me ? 
 Who are we going to play with today ? 
 Oh , the basketball team from No . 1 College ? I know they're a tough team . 
 Who's winning ? 
 Really ? I thought that they'd been killing us by now . 
 Hi , I ’ m Susan.What ’ s your name , please ? 
 Where do you come from ? 
 Yeah , that ’ s right.SO what are you studying ? 
 That sounds interesting . 
 Which man ? 
 Oh , he's the coach of the football team . 
 Certainly . Have you decided which material you would like the suit to be made from ? We have a selection of materials over here . 
 This material is a little more expensive , but is of much higher quality . 
 Fine . I ’ ll measure you for the suit ... shoulder ... waist ... inside leg ... forearm ... upper arm ... thank you . I ’ ll prepare the suit for you tomorrow . Could you come again the day after tomorrow just to check that the su 
 Yes , they are . How many would you like and of which color ? 
 Are you looking for a casual jacket or something formal ? 
 Thank you very much , sir . I ’ ll put the shirts and jacket into a bag for you . 
 Margaret , I'd like to follow up with the arrangements for our company retreat , to take place next month . We need to book the venue , make arrangements for speakers and door prizes , and set up all the activities and accommodations . Also , very important , we need to determine which of our staff will be eligible and will be available to go . We've got to get a head count in order to make reservations . 
 Lower level employees need not attend . The purpose of this retreat is for training , especially for our management team . We want to develop a well-oiled machine on our executive level . In order to get everyone to jell together , we've got to include some fun . That's the reason for the retreat . 
 Well , as a rule , the contract will become void automatically , if both sides do not agree to renew it when time comes . 
 Oh , I am sorry . I misunderstood . Well , in that case , the contract can be canceled with a 2 month's notice . What do you say ? 
 Hello , I've got a letter here that I'd like to post . 
 Well , the letter is going to a friend of mine in America and it's quite urgent . It really needs to be posted today , so here you are . 
 I do want to send it airmail , yes . 
 Yes , my parents , and soon my brother as well . 
 Oh , yes , he is two years older than me . He lives in New Zealand so I don't see him that often . 
 His son is coming as well . He wants to go to university here in England so they will visit a few universities while they are here . 
 No , he has two daughters as well . His wife and daughters are visiting her parents . So I won't see them . 
 Oh yes , they are really looking forward to it . They went to New Zealand last year and loved it . 
 My parents are already here . My brother and nephew are arriving on Monday . 
 Cats are well know for being more independent than dogs . How old is your cat now ? you ’ Ve had her longer than we ’ Ve had our dog . 
 Yes . He ’ s so energetic . We take him out to the park every morning and evening . I think he ’ d be happy to stay there all day ! 
 Your cat spends most of the day outdoors ' , right ? Do you kino where she goes ? 
 Have you ever thought about having another pet ? 
 Hi , Jenny . Are you going to school now ? 
 Got any plans after the class ? 
 We will have our midterm exams next month . I plan to look for some important books and study at the library . Do you want to join me ? 
 Great . We can go to the swimming pool in the gymnasium after that . 
 Well , that's a good question . I haven't swum for almost two years . I think I need more practice . 
 See you then . 
 I'd like to buy a new mobile phone please . 
 Yes please . And I ’ d like to be able to make video calls too . 
 I'd like to rent a safety deposit box here , please . 
 No problem . My husband bought me some beautiful jewellery for our anniversary and I don't feel safe keeping it in the house . Initially , on the advice of a friend , I stored it in the freezer . 
 Yes , right here . So , we can do this today , then ? That will definitely ease my mind . 
 Okay , show me your card hand . Here's mine . I have three Kings and a pair of Aces . 
 Thanks again for buying the tickets . That was the most exciting live concert I've ever seen . That silver electric guitar was really cool . 
 That , My Heart Will Go On . It warms my heart . you know , JanetJackson , Shanna Twain and Celine Dion are so very different . 
 Have you heard Maria Carey ? 
 Excellent . You can borrow my Janet Jackson's CD . It's her new one . 
 Why ? 
 Now , David , can I get you a drink ? What will you have ? 
 What about you , Mary ? 
 May I help you ? 
 May I see your library card , please ? 
 Apparently , you have unpaid late fees . 
 You owe some money . 
 You owe $ 24.50 . 
 Until you pay it , you can ’ t check out books . 
 How are you wedding plans going ? 
 When will that be ready ? 
 You ’ re getting married in three weeks . So that should be ok . So , you ’ Ve prepared the church , catering , transport , hotel-everything . 
 Which hotel will the reception be held at ? 
 Oh , yes . It ’ s and excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . 
 I think you make the right decision . 
 I'm glad that you can make it . 
 Yeah . I've invited a lot of friends besides you . 
 We all keep our shoes on indoors . 
 They've gone out so that we could have the house to ourselves . 
 Her ex-boyfriend was terrible , but this new one is even worse ! 
 I broke Mom's vase . 
 What are your working hours ? 
 Much better than mine . 
 Mine aren't fixed . Sometimes I do the day shift , sometimes the night shift . 
 My choice would always be tea . 
 Last year when I visited China . 
 You mean this one ? 
 Oh , this one ... Here . 
 Sure . 
 Cash or charge ? 
 I have been getting headaches almost every day lately . 
 I never had very many headaches before , but the last few weeks I have been getting a lot of them . 
 My mother just passed away last Tuesday . 
 I have been working really hard , and sleep has not been a priority . 
 No , I haven ’ t hit my head . 
 Look at this newspaper article about this famous local medium . It says that she is really gifted and so popular now , that she is booked solid with appointments for the next twelve months ! 
 Well , I have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read and most of the things the psychic told her came true ! 
 Well , historically it is a practice that many cultures share . Reading the tarot cards , in the east they would even read tea leaves ! I even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar , and then read your ashes . 
 Small world , isn't it ? 
 I never imagined meeting you here . 
 How was your date with Betty ? 
 Good morning . What can I do for you , sir ? 
 Sure . Come to look at these styles . They sell very well . 
 How about these ? They are the current bestsellers . 
 Yes , I will find one for you . Here you are . It's made of exceptionally good quality , pure wool , and is very soft . 
 Yeah , this is the latest model.If you like it , you can try it on . 
 The same question to you . 
 Deal , Where is Gucci ? 
 Oh , look at her . She looks like one is the basketball babies in NBA . 
 Get real . Don't be so pathetic . 
 Oh , man , look at her , go ! She is amazing ! She should be my sis . 
 Yes , I want to be her boyfriend . Just like in the movie . 
 She told me she liked my new haircut . She thought it was cool . 
 Ye Ting , who are these people in the picture ? 
 So you have two brothers ? 
 Hey , Jack , where's your car ? 
 Is that right ? It sure beats the old one ? 
 Ok . Boy , this looks expensive . 
 Wow , this's sinking a hole . 
 I believe it . Hoo , this car corners like it's on rails . 
 Wow , this car can really burn rubber . 
 You made a perfect choice , Jack . 
 How was your appraisal with the boss ? 
 Yes , I think he ’ s the most relaxed person in management . 
 That ’ s good . Maybe you ’ ll get promoted . 
 Do you drive a car yourself ? 
 Great ! When you become new driver , you are better drive as carefully as possible ! 
 Besides , traffic signal in downtown area are very annoying , are they ? 
 Now , we are out of the town , you can drive freely ! 
 Why not ? 
 Yes , We are going to across real road . 
 What other signs what we see in road area like this ? 
 So it looks like we start selling in the U . S . next year . 
 He's still not sure whether he wants to put me in charge , or whether he wants to hire an American.But even if he hires an American , I'll probably be transferred to our American office . 
 We aren't sure yet . Maybe L . A . I think L . A . would be the best idea . 
 Yes , the recent agreements between the two governments have changed everything.Now we have the right to sell in America at a much lower tariff.It ' s going to be good . We can compete more directly with them . 
 Our computers have a high level of quality now.We can demonstrate it . And our prices will be good.So I think it will really be worthwhile . 
 Well , you know I studied marketing in America.So maybe the thought of going back there to promote our brand is kind of exciting to me . I'd love to be part of the team . 
 Yes , I do . I think we can compete . I think we can make a name for ourselves.It will be hard at first . But if we develop a good advertising campaign , I think we can break into the market . 
 It takes some time.Because even if the quality is high , people won't accept a high tech product unless they recognize the name.Name recognition is crucial . 
 That's very nice of you to say.But if we set up an office there in the States , maybe you could try to become part of it . 
 In foreign trade , exporters have to adjust their product in a timely manner . 
 Exporters must ensure that their product satisfies customers ' needs , wants and likes . 
 That's because the fashion , taste and social customs and so on vary considerably . 
 Well , we should be in accordance with national conditions and adjust the product . 
 Hello . 
 How are you ? 
 Good . Do you speak English ? 
 Yes . 
 I'm from California . 
 Nice to meet you too . 
 Me too . I get much more done when I am under the gun . 
 I want to buy a bottle of perfume for myself . 
 I don't like strong perfumes . 
 I don't think it smells nice . 
 Yes , here you are . 
 Sure . The bittersweet perfume has a calming effect on the nerves . 
 How much is it ? 
 I'll take it . 
 Take your mind off it . Look , Crys.This magazine is on China's top ten beauties ! 
 She doesn't have an ounce of fat on her face . 
 Not even drinking milk for one month would get us like that . 
 Look at this girl's gray dress . 
 Last time I wore extra small was when I was in fifth grade . 
 So why are you dieting this time anyway ? Another guy ? 
 The girls in this magazine are so slender . 
 True.You know , I First started dieting when I was ten . 
 Oh , no . Too much work . I hate to sweat . It's so gross . 
 What do you need to do ? 
 How are you going to do that ? 
 What's that ? 
 It gives you money ? 
 And it gives you money ? 
 Oh . What good is that ? I thought it gave you free money . 
 Ms Willows , hello . This is Daniel calling from IBA Bank . 
 I'm calling to notify you that an Export L / C has arrived for you . 
 Yes , it's from Satura Beds of Tokyo . 
 Hello ? Can you give me a tow ? My tour car's stranded . 
 I'm on highway 1-75 going near exit 46 . 
 It's a blue Nissan minivan . 
 The closest garage . What's the charge ? 
 How long will it take ? 
 Thanks . 
 Er ? I am driving right now . Can you call back in 30 minutes ? 
 Thank you for calling . I really appreciate your kindness . But right now , I ’ m very busy preparing for an interview of another company . I don ’ t think I am available for this opportunity . 
 Well , I will text to you . Thank you , bye for now . 
 That dress is very pretty . Why don ’ t you like it ? 
 We ’ Ve been looking around for many hours.What on earth are you looking for ? 
 What style do you want ? 
 Oh , I see.How about the color ? 
 I know a shop selling this kind of sweaters . 
 Darling , this dress is for you . I hope you like it . 
 Your birthday is coming , and I think this dress suits you . Why not try it now ? 
 It fits me exactly . How does it look like ? 
 The most important thing is that you bought it for me . I am happy that you know my size and style . 
 Nick ! How ’ s it going ? 
 What are you doing in this neighbourhood ? Do you live around here ? 
 It was great to meet you last week at the conference . I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment . 
 Sure , you still have my contact details , right ? 
 Sure , my name is Ana Ferris . Don ’ t worry about it . it happens to me all the time . I ’ m terrible with names too . 
 I need a Deposit Certificate to handle some stuff in land . 
 Yes , I recalled you charging that before . And I thought it was extortionate ! Haha ! 
 OK ... so it'll come out of my account ? Well , that makes it much easier . 
 Nope . That's everything , thanks . 
 Ah , hello . Do you have a service for buying Traveller's Cheques ? 
 That would be wonderful . 
 But what if something happened to them ? What would happen to my money ? 
 OK , I'd like to purchase 500 US dollars worth of Traveller's Cheques , please . 
 Hi Simon . Nice to meet you again 
 I am ! I've made lots of friends and I really enjoy my courses . 
 Didn't I ? I'm doing business studies . 
 Maybe . My parents moved to Canada the year when I was born . We are living in Toronto . Suppose I might get a job in Toronto when I graduate . It's too soon to say really . 
 She's from Australia . She lives in Sydney . Her father runs a hotel business there and she is doing a degree in accountancy . 
 I guess so . What about you , Simon ? 
 Great ! So I'll know who to call if I ever need a lawyer . 
 Wow ! That's a fantastic movie ! 
 Who was the director ? 
 I think that the company retreat should be in the mountains this year . 
 January would be a good month for a mountain retreat . 
 You know , now that I think about it , you might be right . 
 That is a good suggestion . 
 Yeah , that would let us know what would work best . 
 It sure is hot . Why don't we go in the Haunted House ? At least it will be air conditioned . 
 Well . Maybe I'll go alone then . I really don't want to miss it . 
 It might take a long time . Because there is a line , you know . 
 Thanks . 
 I'm sorry it took so long . 
 Hi Julie , how are things going ? 
 I'm doing really well . 
 Julie , do you know who that woman is over there by the window ? 
 I thought that he was with Malia . 
 I bet that Lee wasn't too happy with that ! 
 So , what happened ? 
 He stood you up . 
 Not possible . 
 Absolutely . 
 And no phone . 
 I don't know , but he gives me the creeps . 
 But what if he knows my name , where I live ... 
 Actually , he's really good-looking . Too bad he's a weirdo . 
 Now he's looking over here ! He's coming ! 
 I understand we will need seven air conditioning units on the two floors.That ' s what you think , yes ? 
 And if we take the Decker units you suggested , what would the price be ? 
 Isn't there any way we can get central air conditioning in this building ? 
 That's too much . We need to use the separate units , I guess . 
 So you say we can do it for 6000 dollars . 
 You mean installation isn't included ? I'm very surprised . 
 In Taipei , you know , the company usually installs the things they sell.They don't charge extra . 
 Yes , I suppose I should get used to it.But I'm not really willing to spend more than 6000 dollars for this.We haven't even opened yet . 
 And the other company that gave me a quote on this said they could do it for 4000 dollars . 
 I will tell you what I can agree to.If you can quote me a price of 6000 dollars , installation included , I can accept . 
 You do seem like a better company than the other one.So I am willing to pay more than 4000 for you . But I won't pay more than 6000 . 
 Good . I hope we can arrange the contract as soon as possible . 
 Thanks , Tim.Nice meeting you , too . 
 Ye , I hope so.well.Take it easy . 
 Dai Ling . 
 Very well , thank you . 
 Can you bring me a glass of orange juice , please ? I am quite thirsty . 
 Wow , you're right . Everything is absolutely delicious . Please pass the pepper . 
 They're soft . 
 No more , thank you . 
 Bottom is up . 
 Nice meeting you , Kevin . I hope to see you again . 
 Sure , let's . Goodbye , then . 
 When do you have in mind ? 
 That will be fine with me . 
 Good . I'll be there at 12:30 . 
 See you . 
 I see . Thank you . Sir , what kind of duties will I do ? 
 It's easy . Is there anything I can do for you , sir ? 
 I will leave a memo for you , sir . 
 Oh , she did ? Then it's a used car of course . 
 What else did she tell you ? Did she tell you how many miles there are on it ? 
 That's not bad . What about the price ? Did she tell you how much her friend wants for the car ? 
 Three thousand ! That's almost too good to be true . Did she say why her friend wants to sell it ? 
 Well , we can see it for ourselves . Did she tell you when we can go and look at it ? 
 What reasons do westerners drink for ? 
 I know what you mean there . In many circumstances , people kiss the baby for the nurse's sake . And that's what we do when drinking at a banquet . Even though we do have a rich variety of brand-name wines , like Matai and Showing Yellow Rice Wine , alcohol is usually served not for the enjoyment itself . We just be its Dionysus effect to enliven the atmosphere , improve personal association with each other and solidify friendship . 
 Yeah . It's of supreme importance that the goblet , table-cloth , and plates should be made shiningly clean , so that the color of the wine is clearly visible and the delicate aroma and taste are fully appreciable . 
 What's combined transportation ? 
 Why is it necessary ? 
 What did you major in ? 
 What is your specialty ? 
 It seems that something is praying heavy on you.What ’ s the matter ? 
 What did you do to get his goat ? 
 The negotiation of the price has taken us a long time . I hope the following negotiation about quality will be quicker . 
 Don't worry . Our quality is based solely on our sales samples . 
 We are sure to responsible to replace the defective ones . 
 Excuse me , Alex ? 
 I was wondering if you could get together with me to go over the payroll . 
 How many persons are there in your family ? 
 Do you live together ? 
 Do you often go back to see your parents . 
 I'm going to the United Stated to attend my daughter's commencement . 
 Yes . But I will not take much cash with me I can ask the bank to give me the traveler's checks . So it will be safer . 
 I will go to the bank , give them my check , show them one piece of my identifications , and the most important thing is that I should sign my name to endorse the check . 
 He thought he could take Jimmy in , but you know , Jimmy is no fool . 
 So Jimmy just took him in instead and it cost him an arm and a leg . 
 Exactly . Herry is almost broken now . 
 Yes . I dare say it will be . 
 No . I don ’ t think that ’ s possible . Some places are sure to be open . 
 Mmm , you may be right . 
 No . We couldn ’ t possibly . 
 It will be summer . So it will be hot . 
 Yes . It could happen . 
 Does he do that with his Dad ? I mean , does he complain things to his father ? 
 But didn ’ t you say that his Dad takes him under his wings ? 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 Please take a seat . Do you need a shampoo ? 
 $ 10 . 
 The total charge is $ 15 . 
 Well , what shampoo do you prefer ? 
 ( 5 minutes later ) What sort of hairstyles do you like ? 
 I think a crew cut is the most suitable for you . 
 Excuse me . Do you know where the Admiral Hotel is ? 
 Yes , but I can't find Callaway Street . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 I love your bracelet . When did you get it ? 
 Yeah . It's beautiful . Is it white gold or silver ? 
 Where did you buy it ? 
 That's so sweet . What was the occasion ? 
 You're so lucky . If he bought you something for no special day , I wonder what he would buy you for your birthday . 
 What do you want ? 
 Why not a ring ? 
 But you're ready for everything else ? 
 I'd like to say good-bye to everyone . 
 My plane leaves at seven twenty-five . 
 Good-bye . Remember to look me up if you're ever in Washington . 
 Are you from a domestic flight or an international one ? 
 In that case , you should go to the baggage hall over there . 
 I'd like to send this parcel to Spain , please . 
 Well , how long will it take if I send it by surface mail ? 
 Oh , dear . It won't get there for New Year's Day if I send it by surface mail . How much will it cost if I send it by air ? 
 Hello , it's my first time in Egypt . What would you advise me to see here ? 
 But I'm going to stay here only for two days . 
 What shall I do then ? 
 It's really worth seeing . By the way , I'd like to buy some souvenirs . 
 OK . I know what to do now . Thank you . 
 So what ? I got a ninety-nine . 
 Let me see . It's 9 
 I think so . I set it by the radio this morning . 
 Well , it's the 10th and on the Tuesday . 
 let's take the bus . 
 it's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once . 
 we could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice . 
 if we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ? 
 I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus . 
 it looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . 
 thanks , that was nice of you . 
 How come it is slow as a snail today ? 
 Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response to any click . 
 Ok . 
 Yes . I'd like to send this parcel to Changchun . 
 I guess I'll send it by airmail . 
 No , there are only some vases . 
 Have you got boxes for sale ? 
 Is it all right this time ? 
 OK . 
 Yes , I have . 
 I know it's so exciting ! A new year is always like a clean slate . Fresh start to accomplish any dreams , objectives and goals . 
 I was thinking about it , but I'm never able to keep my New Year's resolution . Last year for example I joined a gym and only went twice . 
 That seems reasonable . We should get together and watch the ball drop in Times Square . 
 Well , we can't break tradition ! It's bad luck ! 
 What time do you open this evening ? 
 I see . I'd like to reserve a table for two . 
 I'm not sure , perhaps around 8 pm . 
 Davis . 
 Oh , any chance of a table by the window ? My wife loves the bird's eye view . As it's her birthday , I want it to be a celebration . 
 I do , but I would appreciate you , if it could be arranged . 
 Thank you . 
 No . 
 Sure , what's happened ? 
 I'd rather not have it if you don't mind . I'll have soup instead . I'm supposed to be on a diet . 
 you look better today . How did your test go ? 
 did you pass ? 
 you should be . You worked really hard last night preparing for it . 
 you don't have to thank me . It's just a part of my job as your counsellor . 
 no , in fact , I was terrible at taking exams . 
 sure , but my teachers always encouraged me to do the best that I could and that helped me a lot . When are your final exams ? 
 when do you plan on studying for those exams ? 
 do you think that's a good idea ? 
 that sounds like a good idea . What are you going to do if you have any questions while you're studying ? 
 it sounds like you've learned something useful this year ! 
 It's two blocks down the road . 
 Yeah ! He ’ s very good at showing off his knowledge . 
 A friend told me might find a room here . 
 What do you charge ? 
 OK . Would it be all right to look at the room first ? 
 Excuse me , Dr.Steward , I wonder if I could talk with you about my paper . 
 Will you be free this afternoon , say from 3 to 4 ? 
 Good morning , Madam , can I take your order now ? 
 Anything else ? 
 How about drink ? 
 Please wait a moment . 
 OK . What's up , Madam ? 
 OK . 
 Yes , anything wrong ? 
 Yes , I see . 
 There's a question I want to ask you . 
 Which leg do you want to have , right leg or left one ? 
 Why do you say so many thanks ? 
 Our company's wei-ya is tomorrow night ! It's your first Chinese New Year in Taiwan--you must be excited ! 
 You have no idea ! There's a banquet with prizes , performances ... you name it ! 
 Well , I heard that last year Vivian from accounting won a new car ! 
 No , really ! And she told me the secret to winning , wear red underwear ! 
 Of course ! I'm not only going to wear red underwear , but I'm going to wear red socks and a red shirt , too ! 
 That guy's manner really turns me off . 
 Maybe he's abnormal . 
 He is out . 
 Yeah , it'll take us there . 
 I always catch this bus . 
 It only takes about half an hour . 
 We can get off the bus right behind Macy's . 
 Yeah , it's right in the parking lot . 
 Yeah , I know . 
 Sorry , I really can't do that . There's little time left for us . 
 But I have an appointment with Ann . 
 What's the matter with you then ? You look miserable . 
 What do you mean by us ? 
 That's right . 
 I ... I ... I miss my parents , also they miss me . 
 You mean I am groaned a few words ? 
 Gary . Could you type up this report for me ? I have to take off early this afternoon . 
 There are advertisements everywhere here in hong kong . The city is so bright at night , with all the neon signs . 
 I think that there are too many of them . I think that companies spend far too much money on advertising . They should have lower prices instead . Then they would see more . 
 I really hate receiving spam . I also dislike having to listen to advertisements and jingles when they are broadcast in stores or on the subway . 
 I like that too . I don ’ t like the way that advertising campaign often tell you if you don ’ t buy a certain product , you ’ re not cool or modern or efficient or something . 
 May I help you , sir ? 
 Take a look at the ones on display , please . 
 Good morning . What can I do for you ? 
 Of course . How about these postcards ? They are specially designed for Christmas . 
 No problem . You can choose what you like . 
 A postcard costs you five yuan . A dozen postcards cost you 60 yuan . 
 You are welcome . 
 Mom , it's orange ? 
 Mom , that's a stupid question . 
 I am not a child at all . I know more . 
 Sure . Mom , I can take care of you . 
 I like blue . You see , that's the color of the sky . I wanna be a superman . 
 I hope I can fly to any place like superman . So I can touch the sky . 
 Can you help me , please ? Is there a public restroom near here ? 
 Oh , no ! ! My son needs a bathroom . 
 Where on Grant Street ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 You can't beat me at tennis . 
 I don't think we've met . 
 My name is Dick Brown . 
 Mr . Smith often talked about you . 
 I'm honored to know you . 
 Where do you intend to go ? 
 That's beautiful . 
 I feel so tired . 
 Why ? I'd just be dead tired for the rest of the day . 
 Are you sure ? 
 OK . Let me try . 
 Why would that be funny ? 
 Why ? 
 I don ’ t agree , but anyways , I think you should start thinking of a new year ’ s resolution yourself . 
 Well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives . 
 Well , I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me everyday ! 
 Where do you come from ? 
 What's the climate like in your country ? 
 Which seasons do you like best ? 
 How do you do ? My name is Beef Hart . 
 Happy to see you . 
 May I help you ? 
 We're on clearance sale now . Prices have up to twenty percent off . Do not miss the chance . 
 Madam , you know we ’ re clearing out stock now . It ’ s a real bargain . 
 Thirty percent discount , OK ? That ’ s the lowest price . 
 I ’ m happy to hear you say that . 
 I ’ m renting this apartment out for $ 1050 a month . 
 That is a fair price . 
 That ’ s no good . 
 I won ’ t go any lower than $ 1050 . 
 That ’ s the best I can do . 
 When do you leave ? 
 Take care of yourself and don't forget to keep in touch . 
 Oh , so many kinds of winter hats . 
 Red . 
 May I try it on ? 
 Is there a mirror around here ? 
 Does it suit me ? 
 How much is it ? 
 That's quite reasonable . 
 What about the twill ? It washes well and won't lose shape . 
 Well , it's cheap and actually the color fades easily when washed . 
 Yeah of course ! Although , don ’ t you ever wonder what could have been ? 
 Well , sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently . 
 Like for example , if I hadn ’ t studied architecture , I would have become an artist like I wanted to . 
 You see ! Everything happens for a reason ! We wouldn ’ t even have met if I hadn ’ t been in that car accident ten years ago ! 
 I ’ ll drink to that ! 
 I saw the whole thing happen . 
 I was in the bank during the robbery . 
 Some dude came into the bank with a gun . 
 When he pulled out the gun , I got so scared . 
 He got the money and tried to leave . 
 The cops arrested him before he could even make it out the door . 
 All right , Steven . Do you have a flashlight ? 
 OK , now go down to the basement and find the circuit box . Open it and check if there are any fuses blown out . 
 You'll see it's black and has burnt smell . 
 Unscrew the burnt fuses and replace them with the good ones . You can find them on the rack in the basement . 
 Did you enjoy that new movie ? 
 Oh , what happened , Carole ? 
 What ? I met him just before I took off from Kitty's , he said he was coming . 
 Looks like it . So how did he handle it to ? 
 I think that's a bunch of nonsense . It seemed ok to me . 
 Doesn't sound promising . 
 If you want I'll let him know if I run into him . 
 We can offer you a 5 % discount . 
 Well , what do you suggest then ? How about 8 % ? 
 What ? You want to drive me bankrupt ! You can't expect us to make such a large reduction . 
 How about lo % ? This price is already a little tight , our profit margin is not that large . 
 hey , the new SOHO . How's everything going ? 
 your office ? Aren't you a freelancer ? 
 a virtual office ? 
 what kind of services do they offer ? 
 sounds fun.what else ? 
 oh , that helps a lot to promote your corporate image . 
 what do we need to get from the supermarket ? 
 a crate of beer ? Why do we need that ? 
 we can buy a three-liter bottle . It works out cheaper per liter . We should buy a packet of butter and a few pints of milk too . 
 I think we should get half a kilo of minced beef and a few pork chops . 
 we should also get a tube of toothpaste and a bar of soap . Let ’ s get a tub of ice cream too . We can treat ourselves . 
 I ’ d like a few cans of coke . We also need a dozen eggs and half a dozen sausages . 
 I think so . I ’ Ve got the shopping list , so let ’ s go . 
 Get in slowly , sweetie . You'll get used to it . I'm gonna go and make you some chicken soup . 
 I know you don't have an appetite , but you need to eat something . You'll get too weak if you don't eat . 
 That's a good sign . But just soak a little longer , OK ? 
 Say it ! What is it ? 
 You know you shouldn't say that at a time like this . 
 Too sudden ! I'm not ready for it . 
 Stop it . No more of that talk . 
 No , I shall faint . 
 Yes . 
 We offer various types of transportation . Perhaps you'd like to upgrade to a private vehicle ? 
 In that case , how about a limo ? Then you can travel in style . 
 Got it , sir . Where would you like the taxi to take you ? 
 What time do you want to leave the hotel ? 
 I'll call the taxi immediately , sir . 
 A brand new taxi is pulling up now . 
 You can't judge a book by its cover . 
 How long have you had this pain ? 
 Did you do anything that might have aggravated your tooth ? 
 What kind of toothbrush do you use ? 
 Does it bother you when you eat something really cold ? 
 City Bank . This is Tom . May I help you ? 
 Sure , may I have your name and account number please ? 
 It took them four minutes to get here . That was pretty fast . 
 I guess the fire wasn't in the tool shed after all.It looks like the back of the house was burning . 
 Not really . 
 I think they went to Mexico , but I'm not sure.It ' s a bad thing to return home to.They ' ll come home from their trip , and they'll see half their house burned . 
 Yes , I suppose . It's a dangerous thing if a fire starts when people are sleeping . 
 Are you kidding ? The train leaves in an hour . Where did you put it ? 
 Is it in the other pocket ? 
 Let's go to the inquiry desk first to check whether anyone has got it and turned it in . 
 Driving during the rush hours can be a bit of a bind . 
 So I'd rather walk or run to work . 
 Harry was angry last night . 
 But he used to be very relaxed and cheerful . It's not like Harry to do a thing like that . 
 Could you say something about your educational background ? 
 What was your graduation thesis on ? 
 Hello , this is Li King . Can I talk to your manager ? 
 Yes . Would you please kindly tell him I want to apply for a proof-reader in your newspaper ? 
 I have a little problem with room 507 . 
 This room is filthy with cockroaches . 
 I've already seen nine of them and , as they say , eight is enough ! 
 You are not in a position to question my vision or my statement ! 
 Mike , I'm afraid I can't come back home for dinner tonight . 
 I'm sorry . Our company has just opened . There are always too many things to handle . You know that . 
 Please forgive me . You have my word . I'll spend some time with you on the weekend . I promise . 
 Thank you for understanding . I promise I'll make it up to you . 
 Nothing much . I'm just relaxing today . Why ? What's going on ? 
 Are they having a sale ? 
 That sounds great . Where should we meet ? 
 Sounds good . See you there . 
 They're cute . But do you think you'll wear them much ? 
 This sweater is so pretty . I love the low neck design . 
 It's on sale for $ 80 . What do you think ? Should I try it on ? 
 Good morning , sir . Can I help you ? 
 Could I have your name and room number ? 
 Please wait a moment , Mr . Black . I'll have to check the reservation records ... I'm sorry , but we are expecting several tour groups to arrive today . They have booked all the rooms on the 10th floor . 
 If you don't mind transferring to another room , we may manage it for you . We usually have cancellations or no-shows . 
 It's my pleasure . 
 Yes , sir . What price range do you have in mind ? 
 I see . Let me show you some samples of various qualities . This one is very nice . It's three hundred and fifty dollars . 
 We are having a sale now . The price has already gone down . 
 It's two hundred and eighty dollars . 
 May I have the menu , please ? 
 Could I have a few more minutes ? 
 Thank God , it's Friday ! Time for a drink ! Let's hit the bars ! 
 Should we start with beer or wine or go straight to the hard liquor ? 
 Port's too sweet . It's a dessert wine . A dry red French wine would be nice with meat . A glass of chilled white German wine would be good with fish . But , we're not eating and it's hot out , so I think I'll have a tall glass of sangria with ice . 
 I like to stick to the clean stuff , like vodka , gin , white rum and other clear spirits . 
 Just about . It should be done in the next couple of days . Why ? 
 I ’ ll give him a call . 
 I suspect it's unavoidable . 
 Yeah . She married him at her mother's bidding . 
 Thank you . I am glad that you are enjoying it . 
 I grew up cooking . My mother shared her recipes with me . 
 That is a special coconut ginger chicken with rice dish . 
 Yes , do you like it ? I added a little extra lemon grass and some sea vegetables . 
 Yes , thank you for bringing the wine . It really complements the meal . 
 Let's go take a look at it . Do you have your ID with you ? 
 Okay , I see the problem . You forgot your code , didn't you ? 
 The machine gives you three attempts to enter the correct code and after that it assumes that you are not the real owner and confiscates it . 
 Yes , I can get it for you but I need to go back inside the bank . 
 Really ? Can't you stay a little longer ? 
 Be seeing you then ! 
 I don't know if you remember , but with honest every day last year we tided the knot . 
 How could I ever forget ? I even bought you roses because I love you . 
 You are more beautiful than the roses . 
 Yes , we are match made in heaven . 
 Yes , we did , we did have problems , but we shared a lot of happiness too . We countered the problems , and had a lot of happiness too . 
 I love you , happy anniversary . 
 So , Monica , what do you feel like doing this afternoon ? 
 That ’ s too bad . I hate sand storms too . It can be worse than any kind of bad weather . 
 It is not an easy job . The government is working on it . Lots of trees have been planted in the north of the capital . Also , methods of generating rain are being used by the government to fight against the drought . But of course , it will not work overnight . So , have you come out with a new plan for today ? 
 Let's have a look at the map first . 
 Let's buy some tickets . 
 Well , it's not as crowded as we expected , is it ? 
 It's a sunny day , isn't it ? 
 My name is David . Nice to meet you , too . 
 No , I'm a Britisher . Where do you come from ? 
 Yes . What about you ? 
 Great . Maybe we can study and play games together . I think we can be good friends . 
 hello ! What are you reading about in the newspaper ? 
 people are starting to get frightened by it . Everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder . 
 there must have been some good news in the newspaper . I can ’ t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited . 
 yes . Her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states . 
 I ’ m so happy for the family ! They must be very relieved and excited about that . 
 don ’ t be moody ! I hope you ’ re not tired , because we ’ Ve been invited to a party this evening . I know how excited you get about parties . 
 Not really . 
 It's great ! 
 It's very nice , I like it very much . 
 My pleasure . But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer , and I suppose you dance often . 
 Oh , really ? But you're doing the waltz wonderfully well . 
 Thank you for your compliments.It ' s just that you are a good leader . Do you like the fox-trot and tango ? 
 Disco is my favorite . I like it better than any other dances because it can release one's pent-up feelings , and is a healthy exercise . But I don't do the rock and roll and the break dance . 
 My pleasure . Let's go and have a drink . 
 Did you see the information on sales for last year ? The sales review was made at our last board meeting . There's a great news for our shareholders . 
 We've never sold this much before , our growth this year has been phenomenal . We have captured 8 % of the market , up from last year by 120 % . Our strategy is working ! 
 The company's performance has improved since Wallace became president . He's made our little business into a real lucrative operation . Products are selling like hotcakes . 
 Let's hope this stroke of good luck lasts . I hope we are over our financial difficulties for good . 
 But what if I don't win what I bid on ? 
 It seems that you can e-mail the seller and ask questions . 
 And people are honest ? 
 How do you like skiing , Pat ? 
 I suppose skiing is easy for you . 
 I see . Do you ski often ? 
 That sounds great . 
 Not on your life ! I know I'd break my leg 
 I ’ m interested in teaching at your school . 
 Yes . 
 I have a TEFL certificate . 
 I have three years of teaching ESL and four years of teaching per-school children . 
 I got my TEFL certificate three years ago . 
 Well , I ’ Ve heard many good things about it . I also like teaching young children . 
 Yes , just a little . 
 I sure can . 
 Hi , I was wondering how I'd go about getting a credit card . 
 Oh , no , I'm afraid I don't . Is that necessary ? 
 That's done . Do you need to see any credentials ? 
 I don't have my passport on me at the moment . I'll just pop back to my office and pick it up . 
 What are you worrying about ? 
 Where is he ? Is he in danger ? 
 Are there any special unemployment forms I need to fill out ? 
 Do you know where I can find the application form ? 
 What records will I have to show to apply for unemployment benefits ? 
 Is there anything else I will need to provide ? 
 Do I need to do anything else after I turn in the application ? 
 Some of them seem to be of the latest style . Now I ’ Ve a feeling that we can do a lot of trade in this line . We wish to establish relations with you . 
 Concerning our financial position , credit standing and trade reputation , you may refer to Bank of Hong Kong , or to our local Chamber of Commerce or inquiry agencies . 
 That sounds interesting . I ’ ll send a fax home . As soon as I receive a definite answer , I ’ ll make a specific inquiry . 
 So do I . 
 Wonderful . That's a place famous for its arts . 
 Surely it will be . By the way , when will we get there ? 
 I ’ m interested in all kinds of your products , but this time I would like to order some fireworks and mosquito coil incense . Please quote us C . I . F . Rangoon . 
 I ’ m going to place a trial order for 1,000 units of a dozen fireworks and 500 cartons of mosquito coil incense . 
 Your price is reasonable but I wonder if you would give us a discount . You know for the products like yours we usually get 2 % or 3 % discount from European suppliers . 
 Discounts will more or less encourage us to make every effort to push sales of your products . 
 As far as a trial order is concerned , the quantity is by no means small . And generally speaking , we like to profit from a trial order . I hope you ’ ll be able to meet our requirements . 
 1 % ? That ’ s too low a rate . Could you see your way to increase it to 2 % ? . 
 It seems this is the only proposal for me to accept . I ’ ll come again tomorrow to discuss it in detail . 
 What's the price for that suit ? 
 Well , I like everything about it except the price . 
 I made an appointment for a perm at 3 o'clock . 
 Thank you . 
 Yes , with the LUX dandruff shampoo . It helps a lot to get rid of my dandruff . 
 I'd like a permanent wave . By the way , do you have any picture of the latest hairstyle ? I ' Ve been in this style for so long that I want a change this time . 
 I prefer this kind of style . Can you make it for me ? 
 I would like to have this laundry done . 
 OK . By the way , I would like to have this sweater washed by hand in cold water . It might shrink otherwise . 
 What channel did you watch last night ? 
 You did ? How do you like the fashion show ? 
 Do you offer a course in business management ? 
 How many nights a week is it ? 
 And how long does the course last ? 
 When does it start ? 
 What time is the class ? 
 How much does it cost ? 
 Yes , that's all right . I want to enroll in the course . 
 Do you want me to fill it out now ? 
 I hear you bought a new house in the northern suburbs . 
 What kind of house is it ? 
 Oh , I love the roof tiles on Spanish style houses . 
 Great , is it a two bedroom house ? 
 That ’ s a nice area too . It ’ ll be a good investment for you . 
 Not untill the end of this year , you know , just before my wedding . 
 Thank you . 
 For most of the articles in the catalog , we have good supply . 
 Thanks . I'll look into it and let you have our firm offers tomorrow . 
 You'll find our prices very favorable . 
 Either can be done , though we usually quote on CIF basis . 
 Certainly . We can work them out for you . 
 Honey , I have a lot of work to do . 
 No . 
 What park do you want to go to ? 
 Haven't we been these places already ? 
 What about the Olympic park ? 
 The Olympic Park has a small forest . It is fit for picnic . 
 Mr.Ben , What do you think of the book ? 
 Why ? 
 I agree with you . 
 You can print out a copy of the Order Supply Form from our company web site and turn in into me . What will you be needing ? 
 Will you need all of them right away or can some wait ? 
 You can only buy supplies that you have a budget for . Do you know what your budget is ? 
 You can pick these supplies up or they can be delivered to your building . Which would you prefer ? 
 Well , just finish the request and we will contact you when the supplies come in . Have a good day ! 
 Am I ever hungry ? When will supper be ready ? 
 All right . 
 Yeah . Oh , it's delicious ! 
 Definitely . It's a wonderful meal . Thank you , Honey . 
 I wish I could , but I won't . 
 Thanks . I can wait here . 
 I see . All right , then . Thanks . 
 Sure . I'll be there as soon as I finish this document . 
 OK . 
 I'm sorry to say that we have to let you go , John . 
 Well , you're working very hard but not efficiently . And you don't work well with other employees . 
 I'm afraid it's too late . We are downsizing our workforce and you'll have to go . 
 We can give you the option of residing rather than being fired , because it will look better on your resume when you apply for another job if you resign . 
 All right , but let me know your decision before the end of the day . 
 OK . How about this diamond necklace ? 
 Then . I'm sure you will like this one . 
 Sure . This is the warranty . The cut , color , clarity , weight and the manufacturer of the diamond are all indicated in this document . 
 There are various kinds of tea in China . It depends on the taste and effect . 
 This is green tea , you can drink it in summer . It can relieve summer-heat and it is good for maintaining your lungs . 
 It is black tea , it has a strong taste and promotes digestion . 
 It is jasmine tea of high quality . It is fragrant and has a pleasant taste . 
 No problem . Wait for a moment . 
 Ah , Jenny ! You remember me , what a good memory you have . 
 She's fine , thanks . Actually , she's the reason I'm here . It's our Wedding Anniversary in 2 weeks and I want to get her something special . She's been nagging me about our furniture , you see . 
 I would like to cash my undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate , please . 
 Yes , I know . But it can't be helped . It's been a pretty slow month and I just don't have enough cash to refurnish the whole house . 
 Do you want to settle the bill now ? 
 Yes , we do . 
 Do you have any identification ? 
 Fine . 
 That's great . Thank you for making this concession . I accept . 
 Good . Now that the price is decided on , we can discuss the packaging . 
 Carton ? 
 Could you use wooden cases instead ? 
 I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for ocean transportation . 
 All right . Carton or no carton , the packaging must be waterproof as well as strong enough to stand shock and rough handling . 
 That's right . As soon as I get home , I'll see about the opening of the letter of credit . 
 No problem . That can be done . I understand you'll ship the goods before the end of May ? 
 Yes , we agreed to that . We have great confidence in your inspection institution . Through years of dealing with you , we've convinced of your commercial integrity . 
 Exactly . That's what we have done in the past . 
 Can you speed it up and let me have it today ? I'm leaving tomorrow . I've been here for almost a month now , you see . My corporation is urging me to return . I've booked the ticket for tomorrow afternoon's flight at 3 . 
 That's fine too . 
 I'd like to try some Chinese food . 
 I have no idea . Could you recommend some to me ? 
 Oh , I see . I'd like to have hot food . 
 Really ? So do you have some specialties ? 
 All right . I'll have them . 
 This is Room 320 . Can I have a morning call tomorrow ? 
 Seven , please . 
 Thank you . 
 Her acting is OK . 
 I'm afraid I know less than you do.Tell me more about her , will you ? 
 Really ? I'm glad to hear that . 
 Thank you again for your visit . We are looking forward to your reply . 
 We are happy that we have established business relations . I really hope that we'll have more business to do and more opportunities to meet each other . 
 You are very nice and helpful . Hope to see you again . 
 OK , I think it's time for you to check in . If you run into any difficulty , we'll be here to assist you immediately . 
 Goodbye . 
 It's me . What can I do for you ? 
 Are you Mr . Wu ? 
 Nice to meet you , too . Did you have any difficulty finding our company ? 
 Well , this apartment is really a must-see . Will you come with me to look at it this weekend ? 
 Great ! Do you know someone else who is also looking for an apartment ? 
 We thought you might like to participate in our rehearsal . 
 That ’ s a pity . We can arrange another time hopefully . 
 Of course , this is my first time here . My Mom has a membership here . Here is the card . 
 It's not so wise that you do not explore the children's market . 
 Well , I want to become just like Bruce Lee . What should I do ? 
 I am still young . And I'm growing every minute . 
 I love running . Anything else ? 
 I'm perfect with my clothes . And I do not have anything else with me . 
 Oh , that's the only place where jeans are not popular . I'd better just go home . 
 They ’ re all doing fine . Let me show you some of their pictures . 
 That ’ s Charles . 
 All my children are large . 
 That ’ s James . 
 All my children are agile . 
 That ’ s Joanna . Joanna hopes to go to college . 
 Excuse me . Would you tell me where The People's Park is ? 
 How long will it take me to get there ? 
 I'm not going in the wrong direction , am I ? 
 May I take a bus to get there ? 
 OK . Thank you a lot . 
 Everything goes well , but I am thinking about quitting my current job . 
 I just sense . But I cannot grow anymore . My boss is not really supporting me . I am interested in some positions in other JV companies , but I need to do some more in-step research before I send my application letters out . 
 Certainly , it is very nice talking with you . But I really have to go now . Catch you later . 
 Good afternoon , sir.What Can I do for you ? 
 Really ? Have you left it in your room ? 
 Well , in that case , you have to pay for it . Please fill out the form first . 
 No , not yet . I just want to hair cut . 
 I want it short . 
 I mean very short . shorter than it ’ s now . 
 No . you can cut quite a bit off , I like it to be very short all over . You see what I mean . 
 Yes . And Chinese style . 
 No , thank you . 
 No , Nothing will be kind . 
 That ’ s very good . 
 And we ’ re on the brink of soccer history today , as Ecuador and Brazil are tied one-one as we begin the second half of the 2022 World Cup ! 
 That will be a throw in for Brazil . Adriano has the ball and makes a long pass to Robin , and the ref has called him offside . 
 Delgado takes the corner . We have a foul ! Oh no , Did , the goalkeeper , has fouled the Ecuadorian player ! He gets a yellow card and that will be a penalty kick ! 
 Excuse me , can I have an earphone please ? 
 OK . Here you are . 
 I see . Thank you . 
 Sure , why not ? 
 I see . It feels very light on the skin . 
 I like the cool smell , too . 
 Alright , Ma'am . What items would you like to order today ? 
 You may tell me both , Ma'am . 
 The Merriman satin sheets ? 
 And what size would you like ? 
 Alright , Ma'am . And what color did you want ? 
 So that is product number MS2119 , Size 
 Certainly . 
 Satin is like silk , Ma'am . It feels like silk . But it's a different material . 
 Anything else today ? 
 Alright . With shipping charges , your total will be 68 dollars . Will you be paying with credit ? 
 Visa , Master Card , or American Express ? 
 Card number ? 
 Expiration date ? 
 All right , Ma'am . I will run that charge for you . And then I will get your address in a moment 
 Don ’ t do that again . You are riding the tiger . 
 You will ask for it . 
 I think Bill Clinton is a good president . 
 Well . Maybe he isn't a good husband , but he is a successful president . 
 Yes , he is . Of course he makes mistakes , but who doesn ’ t . 
 Is sailing fun ? 
 Merry Christmas , sweetie . How's your brother enjoying Taiwan ? 
 No ! Christmas without him is bad enough . So , honey , do you have cold feet yet ? 
 You're not coming ? 
 I'm afraid not . The church is booked until the year 2001 . 
 We'll have to . We'll rehearse on the 1st and have the wedding on the 2nd . 
 Don't worry , dear . I'm a great host . Now get some rest . Merry Christmas . 
 I love you , too . And forgive Jack . He's doing his best . 
 I have a sweet tooth . 
 I would love to get some dessert . 
 I'd love to get a pie . 
 I'm not sure . 
 What kind do you like ? 
 I love apple pie too . 
 I ’ Ve just taken out an insurance policy . Are you insured ? 
 I took out a life insurance policy and made my wife the beneficiary . 
 I need to make sure that my wife will be financially secure if I die . 
 That ’ s one of the conditions of my police too . It covers you if you die before you retire and when you retire . 
 Yes , I did . It was one of the conditions of the insurance police . The insurance companies need to assess the risk 
 Why don't we spend this vacation earning our tuition ? 
 OK . 
 Yes . 
 Well , that happens . I hope she is all right . 
 That is the down side of an office romance . I hope their work is not affected by the emotional stress . The boss must be very annoyed if that will be the case . 
 Our team just scored a goal . 
 Tell me about it . 
 Brian , do you know how to speak English ? 
 Where did you learn ? 
 You speak really well . 
 How long have you been in the U . S . ? 
 Is your wife with you ? 
 Have you been to California before ? 
 Have you ever been to Las Vegas ? 
 Martha . What's wrong ? Why are you crying ? 
 I'm sorry . When did this happen ? 
 What a jerk . He doesn't deserve you . 
 He didn't treat you that well either . Maybe you don't want to hear this , but I think you can do better . 
 It must be really painful . I remember when Josh and I broke up . I was crying for a week . 
 Exactly . You'll find someone again . You should get your mind off of this . Let's go shopping . 
 How about coffee down the street ? 
 Housekeeping . May I help you ? 
 I can check for you . Could you describe the coat ? 
 When was the last time you saw it ? 
 OK . I ’ ll check the lost and found and with the bar manager . We'll do our best to find it . 
 You'd like coffee , wouldn't you ? 
 What else are you going to have ? 
 That sounds good . I'm going to order the same thing . 
 I know that . I met her last week , and she looked as pale as death . 
 That ’ s too bad . She ’ s been so kind to us all . 
 Don't shoot . I give up . 
 Yes , I know a little about Japanese which is similar to Chinese not only in culture but in language itself . 
 I passed the Band two in LPT , but I will try to achieve Band one which is the highest level . 
 Thirty minutes or 30 seconds , sir , it doesn't matter , I'm ready for you . 
 There's nothing like getting an early start , sir . 
 You can leave your baggage in our storage space , with a deposit . 
 I wish it was , but it isn't . They will still want a credit card . 
 Don't forget that you have very little time , sir , before you have to check out . 
 It says a storm may come tomorrow . 
 Me , too . I'm always in low spirits when it rains . Are you going out tomorrow ? 
 What bad luck ! 
 Yeah , maybe you are right ! 
 Very nice . He gets along with his classmates very well . 
 Yes , indeed . 
 Well , I want a fillet steak , medium , but my little girl doesn't care for steak . Could she have something else instead ? 
 Sounds delicious . OK . She'll try that . 
 What's up ? 
 Oh , I think it is . 
 I think it's because of your bad habits ! 
 I know you have done a lot , but you always sleep very late . Sleeping eight hours a day doesn't mean it is healthy . Sleeping after 12 is hurtful to our body , and I think this is your problem . 
 You should do better later . 
 I ’ m so sorry , and I will pay much attention to it later . 
 Yes , I am sorry . I missed the bus . 
 Well , I missed several buses . 
 I , ah ... , I got have late . 
 Well , I ... I lost my wallet , and I ... 
 Yes , I found it again . 
 This morning . I mean ... 
 So , Monica , how do you like your new office ? 
 That ’ s very good . I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful . 
 Small rooms , small window , a small desk shared by three people . I would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work . 
 Totally agree . By the way , the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . You can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor . 
 Sure . Do you want to go first , Sally ? 
 OK , here's your question What movie won the 1996 Oscar for Best Picture ? 
 Well , along with Jurassic Park ! Nice going , you got the right answer . 
 How can I help you ? 
 Will that be all , sir ? 
 I will have someone bring that up right away . How would like to pay for the dinner ? 
 All right , sir . You would receive dinner in about 15 minutes . 
 No thanks . I like to run in the morning . I ran a couple of miles when I woke up today . 
 I couldn ’ t either at first , but you get used to it . 
 Well , why don ’ t you come tomorrow ? I ’ ll stop by your house on my way out . 
 I ’ ll give you a call around 6 o'clock and stop by around 6 thirty . 
 Great , I ’ ll see you then . 
 Mr . Black , I ' d like to take some time off . I ' Ve been feeling exhausted these days . 
 Yes . I was wondering if I could take another two weeks off . 
 The project I'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week . I'd like to take my leave from next Monday on . 
 Thank you , Mr.Black . There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . Mr.Smith will be in charge during my absence . He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients . 
 I will . Many thanks , Mr.Black . 
 Oh , no ! I can't have failed . Are you sure ? 
 It sucks . But Arden told me he's satisfied with my qualifications and experience . 
 How am I going to face the fellows in our office ? They thought I would be promoted . They must be waiting for my good news . 
 But I lost the chance . 
 The results of the poll show Bill Clinton's approval rating has gone up in his second term . Do you find that interesting ? 
 That is exactly what the poll shows . Although the stating of Clinton as a person has gone down in the last two years of his term , his approval rating is as high as 66 percent . 
 But the poll says only 15 percent say he will be remembered as an outstanding president . 
 The headlines are all about the presidential election in the united states . Few other stories made the front pages . 
 There ’ s an interesting feature article in the chronicle about doing business in china and the daily news has printed a report about the special economic zone near pairs . We have a subsidiary company l 
 Generally , the reporters take positive lines . They do point out a few problems that we need to be aware of , but there ’ s nothing worrying in the reports . In the classifieds , one of our competitors is a 
 Not really . They all seem to focus on the election . There have been several letters printed in the chronicle regarding that controversial article on drugs that they printed last week . 
 Sure . There you are . 
 Good morning , Tom.How are you ? 
 Things couldn't be better.Where are you going now ? 
 I'm going to the English class.It ' ll start in five minutes , I've got to run . 
 After a while , crocodile . 
 Well , I think the color is a little too bright . 
 Yes . What's this made of and how to wash it ? 
 Excuse me . Do you mind if I ask some things about work for this company ? 
 I've heard that the company is very strict with its staff . Is that true ? 
 If you make mistakes in your job , you'll be fired . Is that right ? 
 Working here involves a busy schedule and overtime . Is that true ? 
 It seems that working in a foreign enterprise is not the same as I expected . Thank you for your help . 
 Good morning , doctor . I have a terrible headache . 
 Yesterday I had a runny nose . Now my nose is stuffed up . I have a sore throat . And I ’ m afraid I've got a temperature . I feel terrible . 
 Ah . 
 What am I supposed to do then ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Well , there are a lot of storybooks upstairs in our children's section . Some are written for young children , others for teens . Maybe some of them will suit your needs . 
 You're welcome . 
 Not yet , but I'm thinking of it . Have you bought one , Dad ? 
 Can you tell me why you want to buy it ? 
 Oh , I see . Do you advise me to buy one ? 
 That's true . Well , how much do you think I should get ? 
 May I help you ? 
 Yes , madam . What sort of gloves do you want ? 
 Certainly . What size do you take ? 
 I think a six is your size . How do you like these ? I can recommend them , they're very reliable . 
 I'd like to reconfirm my plane reservation . 
 Flight 201 . 
 Anderson . 
 Thank you . 
 Oh , my God ! It ’ s my stomach . It ’ s killing me ! 
 Right here ! It hurts right here ! 
 I felt OK when I woke up , and then , suddenly , I had this really sharp pain . 
 No , and I haven ’ t done anything out of the ordinary . 
 Thank you for helping me . 
 Yes , in many ways it is . There are many stereotypes I have to deal with in my daily life . 
 Well , like since I'm black , I must like rap music , come from the inner city , or play basketball well . 
 Hey ! But that's not the only problem . There's also the affirmative action stigma . 
 I know that , but some people don't think like that . And I get problems from teachers as well . 
 Racist ? Not exactly . It's how they look at me and ask for my opinion on a topic , as if I can speak for all black people and give them the black opinion on a subject . Suddenly I become the representative of the black race , as if we all had the same opinion . 
 Hello ! How do I get online with my laptop ? 
 Well , I see the cable . But my computer runs on wireless only . 
 Yes , I'd love to hear what the alternatives are . 
 Great ! But is it free ? 
 You said there were other alternatives ? 
 Okay . That sounds like a winner . Now if I need to print something in the lobby ? 
 Do you mind if I come over to use your computer ? 
 Does that mean I can't use it tonight ? 
 Housekeeping . May I help you ? 
 Of course . What room are you in , sir ? 
 And do you know which room the noise is coming from ? 
 Thank you . We'll take care of it . Please let us know if there's anything else we can do to make your stay more comfortable . 
 Hi , did you call for an exterminator ? 
 What sort of pest are we dealing with ? 
 Well , there ’ s nothing we can ’ t handle . I ’ ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches , but the termites will be harder to get rid of . We will have to cover the entire house and fu 
 how is your house hunting going ? 
 how much are you looking to spend ? 
 looks like you ’ re not going to get more than a bedroom in a shared flat with that . 
 well , if you want to live in London , you have to pay the price ! 
 I can ask around at work . Do you have a preference for makers or non-smokers ? 
 how long do you want to sign a contract for ? 
 do you need a furnished or unfurnished apartment ? 
 you know that you ’ ll have to pay utilities on top of the rent , right ? 
 it ’ s not usually included , so you ’ ll have to factor in about 100 pounds more each month for utilities . 
 don ’ t worry . Sometimes people will give you a discount if you promise to do the clearing or take care of the children . 
 I have some good news for you . 
 Jenny is getting married . 
 Tom , that lucky guy . 
 Last week , It said that he fell in love with Jenny at Mrs.Whit ' s party last Monday as soon as he saw her . 
 July 4 , the National Holiday . 
 Jenny plans to hold it in church . 
 Guess ! 
 You know , Tom is my best friend and he asked me to be his best man . 
 Yes , I did . 
 Yeah.It ' s a must for me . 
 I won't , mum . 
 There is one just around the corner . 
 The price is moderate , but their work is sometimes not satisfactory . 
 No , there is not , as far as I know . 
 I ’ m afraid what you were told is not quite right , if you could meet him in person , and you ’ ll know he ’ s very agreeable and capable . 
 Are you ready to order now , sir ? 
 What would you like to have for your appetizer , sir ? 
 And what would you like to have for the main course 
 Apple , banana and strawberry pie . 
 And what would you like for dessert ? 
 What flavor would you like ? 
 Thank you . I'll bring your order right away . 
 I'm not exactly sure if it's your department , but I'd like to ask some questions about qualifying for Comprehensive Credit Granting . 
 How long a period will you look at to determine this ? 
 That sounds simple enough . It's Friday today , I'll be back on Monday morning , first thing , with all of the relevant data . See you then , and enjoy your weekend . 
 I couldn't agree with you more . 
 It ’ s nice to meet you , too . 
 Would you like to ask me anything ? 
 I think everyone has the right to love who they want . 
 Yes , I would . 
 I ’ m sure they won ’ t , but that ’ s my view on gay marriage . 
 I really appreciate that . 
 Than you , I'm not late , am I ? 
 Well , thank you , but it's not all that hard to do , you know . I've been calling your office and sending you proposals for about two years now , and you've never responded before . 
 Please , I wish you would . 
 Yes , I know that . It's why Ive been trying to become one of those suppliers . I hear you're a good man to do business with . 
 That's pretty much what I heard . 
 No problem at all , Mike . Just give me the chance . 
 Thanks , doctor . Is there anything I can take for this headache ? 
 Okay . 
 Steven , shall we go shopping tomorrow ? 
 But Sunday is the same with Saturday . If you don ’ t mind , that's OK . 
 I see . We will go the day after tomorrow . 
 I want to buy some clothes in clothing store . When we are going back , go to the butcher's shop and buy some chicken . 
 Thank you , darling . 
 Yes , but it takes a while to find things . It's not organized as carefully as a regular store . 
 Usually a clothes company will send their overstock to an outlet . The prices are very low . But you may find faulty products here too . 
 Yes . Sometimes the fault is very small ; if you have a needle and thread , you can fix it yourself . So it's a good deal to buy it . 
 Yes . You can save a lot of money in this way . 
 Why not buy the sweater ? It only costs 30 Yuan . 
 How many do you want to buy ? 
 You're right . 
 What a large building . Can we visit by ourselves ? 
 Thank you . When and where shall we meet ? 
 I see . 
 I'll let you break the balls this time . 
 OK . How much do you want to bet on this game ? 
 May I ask what the core value of the company is ? 
 Are they different from other companies ? 
 I'm really fed up with Larry ! He's the biggest airhead I've ever met.He always makes careless mistakes , and he's a pain to work with . 
 You only say that because you don't have to work with him.The people in your department seem so capable and nice to be around.Take Mary for example.She ' s smart and enthusiastic . I've never met anyone as cheery as she is . 
 Isn't there anyone in the office that is a perfect co-worker ? What about Bob ? Everybody loves Bob.Even though he's flesh out of college and still a bit green , he is a great co-worker . 
 Maybe that's why he's so nice ! 
 Our school has a link on its website for apartments . 
 Some of the ads in the paper are from people looking for roommates . 
 Do you need a single apartment , or is this for two people ? 
 You can get that type of apartment for around fifteen hundred dollars a month . 
 I love apartment hunting . I ’ ll be happy to go with you . 
 Here you are . Do you need glue ? 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 Really ? What a shame ! I thought she was going to win this one . 
 Hello , ma ’ am , can I help you find something ? 
 We ’ Ve got a wide selection do you know if you ’ d like a point-and-shoot , or something a little fancier ? Are you shopping for yourself or for someone else ? 
 Ah , well then I ’ d recommend a nice entry-level digital SLR . 
 Sure thing , follow me . This here is the . 
 Oh , ah , um the Nikon D60 is a nice option . 
 Oh , well this one has the , uh . 
 So , ahem , can I interest you in any acc ... 
 Polarizing filter um we should ! I ’ m sorry , ma ’ am . It looks like we ’ re sold out . 
 Oh , well , would you look at that ! Polarizing filters . 
 No problem , ma ’ am . 
 Yes , we are thinking of placing an order . However we would like to know what kinds of machines are available for export and in addition your sales terms , including mode of payment , discount and possible date of delivery . 
 We have read about this in your sales literature . Could you give us some idea of your prices ? 
 Do you take special orders ? That is , do you make machines according to the specific requirements from clients ? 
 How long does it usually take you to make delivery ? 
 Good . One more thing , we'd like you to quote us on CIF basis . 
 Can you show me some jade , please ? 
 No , but I do like jade bracelets . 
 Thank you . ( A moment later ) Oh , this one is quite impressive . I'll take it . By the way , do you sell pearl earrings ? 
 I wonder which looks more lustrous . 
 Oh , I see . I think I prefer a natural one . 
 She told me that she's got tennis practice today . 
 How did you know ? 
 I see . Do you live in this neighborhood , too ? 
 Oh , Cindy did mention you before . You're Alexander Newman . 
 Hey , Robert , what are you doing this weekend ? 
 We are putting together a birthday party for Mary . 
 We thought it would be fun to have a pool party at Jay's house . 
 We will be providing hot dogs , hamburgers , and cake , but people can bring side dishes . 
 Dress casually and bring your bathing suit ! 
 Let's speed up . We're going to be late again . 
 I hope so . 
 Can't I play more ? 
 Mom , I'll be finished soon . 
 Good afternoon , madam . Can I help you ? 
 OK . How do you like your money , madam ? 
 Just a moment , please . I'll check for you . 
 Yes , I'd like to know if there would be any future opportunities for specific training . 
 When will I know your decision ? 
 I can be reached at my office during work hours and at home in the evening . My office phone number and home phone number are in my resume . 
 Thank you , sir . I expect to hear from you as soon as possible . 
 All right . Goodbye . 
 Yes . I once worked in a small company for one year . 
 My reason for leaving is that I wish to get into the advertising business . 
 I've learnt a lot about business knowhow . I got to know what kind of knowledge was needed in my future work . 
 Are you a daytime student or do you just come in the evenings ? 
 Will you be driving a motorcycle or a car ? 
 OK , that will be twenty-five dollars . How would you like to pay for it ? 
 Would you like to pay for any extra permits for another vehicle ? 
 Here you go then . Have a great school year ! 
 Hi , Christine . How ’ s it going ? 
 Sure , just a second . All right , what time ? 
 OK . I am coming . 
 I have checked the weather report . It says it will be cloudy , but no rain . 
 Daniel , don't forget to take enough water and food . 
 Me , too , haha . 
 All right . Oh , I nearly forgotten , I left my sneakers at my office . 
 OK , after we finish our preparation , we'll go to the supermarket . 
 Well , we won't be able to guarantee you a room for February 22 , but we can book you on February 23.Is that OK ? 
 How is Rose now ? 
 I ’ m sorry to hear about that . 
 I am here on business . 
 Of course , here you are . 
 They are two cameras . 
 Yes , I have one carton of cigarettes and a bottle of whiskey . 
 Excuse me . Does this hotel have a fitness facility ? 
 Where is your fitness facility located ? 
 Is there an additional surcharge for the gym ? 
 What time is the gym open , and what time does it close ? 
 Do you offer trainer services along with the gym ? 
 You wouldn't believe what I got in the mail today ! 
 it's a letter from Ray and Sue in Shanghai ! 
 no , I thought I'd wait until you got home . 
 ok . It says , " Dear Jessica . It was so good to receive you letter . I sounds like you and Riley are settling into your new home with ease ... " 
 just a few weeks ago . Sue and I send letters to each other often . 
 ok ... I'm going to have to skip over this section . It's girl-talk . 
 oh . It's actually all rather personal . 
 ok , it just says , ball , blah , blah ... " Ray and I look forward to seeing you in June . Write soon . With love , Sue . " 
 didn't I tell you ? We're going to Shanghai to stay with them in June . 
 men ! 
 Yes , please . I'm hoping to get a mortgage from you and was wondering about your interest rates . 
 That's pretty much the same as I've been quoted at other banks . 
 Definitely . I want to get my mortgage paid off as soon as I can . 
 Mmmm ... that does sound interesting . Is there anyone available I can talk with about this in more detail ? 
 Hey , I'm hungry . How about you ? 
 That's a great idea . Let's go to a Chinese restaurant . 
 When can I know whether I am accepted or not ? 
 Yes , my office phone number is 373 ... 36 . 
 Between four and five in the afternoon . 
 The pleasure is mine . It's been nice talking with you . Goodbye . 
 I ’ d like a half a pound of ground beef , please . 
 Could I also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts ? 
 No , that won ’ t do . I ’ ll take this smoked ham you have here . 
 Is this salami and bologna you have here ? 
 Sounds good . Okay , that ’ s it . 
 Mmm ... No that ’ s okay , really . I think that ’ s all for today . 
 Hello , I am calling to confirm my reservation for a single room . 
 This Friday . 
 That's right . Thank you . 
 I agree . 
 I guess you're right.But like you said , you called me here to check me out . I've been doing the same . 
 Quite good , actually . I'm pretty sure you're demanding , but fair and honest . I feel we can work together . 
 Shoot ! 
 I don't see a problem . 
 The fried shrimp is crunchy ! But my mom will never cook shrimp this way . She always says that fried food is not healthy . 
 She often cooks it in a large pan of boiling water . 
 My mom says it has a lot of fat . I also suggest you do not eat so many fried things . 
 Really ? I really want to have a try ! 
 That sounds like a good idea ! But I'm afraid my mom will be angry about it . 
 Then what about the wire ? 
 So I know . Thanks . 
 Well , the pulp falls from a box onto the first part of the paper machine , which is basically a wire bed with large holes in it , where most of the water is extracted . 
 Yes , it is . But we need to take out more water . So it then passes through a series of rollers , where more water is squeezed out . After that it goes through the dryers , which are at a very high temperature . The paper is then coated . And finally it's wound onto reels and cut down into smaller lengths . 
 I can speak French and German . 
 I can speak German quite well , but I can't speak French very well . 
 No , but I'll be able to tomorrow . 
 I agree ... 
 Just now we both thought it would be fine . 
 I didn't really like it all that much . 
 Well , they are pretty new . I just didn't feel that they were ready to open yet . 
 The food wasn't all that exciting . 
 Yes , the service certainly didn't add to the experience . 
 Maybe we could try it again in a few months when things have settled down . 
 Do you know what class you want to take ? 
 I believe there are still two Psychology classes open . 
 There is one class on Tuesday and Thursday from 2 to 4 . 
 It's from 10-12 on Monday and Wednesday . 
 These two are the only ones . 
 Very good . 
 Just kids like that . 
 Hurry up ! Hurry up ! What lovely caterpillars are over there ! 
 What's that ? 
 That's splendid . Can you take three pictures of me with them ? 
 Cut it out . Look at my smile , and it seems like the flowers in the spring . Right ? 
 Hurry up ! The smile is frozen on my face . 
 Would you like a savings or a chequing account ? 
 Right.Could you fill out this form please ? 
 This is Denise , Mr . Bruce ’ s Secretary . I was calling to confirm his meeting tomorrow with Mr . Dome at 4 o ’ clock . 
 Is your address still 1150 Lake Road ? 
 Ok . Thank you . 
 I'm terribly sorry I'm late . I just couldn't help it . 
 Look , just give me a chance . I can explain it . 
 Yes . I am getting fat . What should I do ? 
 Are you voting tomorrow ? 
 You know that I am . 
 It ’ s at the park up the street . 
 Where ’ s your polling place ? 
 How come you don ’ t know where it is ? 
 You should check online . 
 He has so many friends supporting him . 
 But he has to stick to it and to it long enough . 
 Yes , sir . How much would you like to remit ? 
 No problem . Do you want the money to go by M / T or T / T ? 
 If you take M / T , it will take a longer time for your brother to receive the money . 
 Would you please fill in this application form ? 
 For 1,200 yuan to Nanchang , the commission is 12 yuan . 
 You are welcome . 
 So , how's your work ? 
 I am going to resign . A few of the new staff have already left . Obviously , a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries . 
 But we have a policy of paying according to seniority in the company , so new employees get quite low salary , no matter how excellent they have done . 
 That's why I am going to leave . 
 I am worried about my future . I can't believe that our company is as big as it is . The company can only continue to grow by taking care of its staff . 
 Thank you . I will . 
 Wang Yongmei . 
 I want to immigrate to the States because my daughter works and lives there . 
 About nine years 
 She is a teacher in a highschool , She teaches Chinese . 
 All right . 
 Good morning . I have a Bill of Exchange against Bank Acceptance here . I'd like to discount it . Is that possible here ? 
 Yes , I've got all that here . 
 A copy or the original ? I guess you need the original , right ? OK , I'll return shortly . 
 Why do you have to leave early ? 
 Could you make it up by attending my other section this week ? 
 Are you leaving right away or can you stay for a few more minutes ? 
 OK , but please make sure that you get all of your make-up work completed . 
 Go do what you have to do , but make sure it doesn't happen again . 
 I am going to see a movie with a friend of mine . What about you ? 
 Would you like to see a movie with me and my friend ? 
 I don't know , but was there a certain movie you wanted to see ? 
 Well , would you like to go ? 
 All right . Another time then . 
 No problem . Just take your clothes off from the waist up and put the gown on , with the opening in the back . 
 You will stand over here up against this plate . 
 You will raise your arms up shoulder high . 
 Yes , you are doing great . 
 I need to stand behind this shield . Now you will take a deep breath , hold it , and let it out . 
 That ’ s it . You can get dressed when the film is developed . 
 I want to post this package to the United States . 
 By sea . 
 I am indeed . What can you tell me ? 
 Do I get a card ? 
 How about the interest ? I'm not really happy with the interest I'm receiving through my Current Account . 
 That sounds better . Also , can I use the one card for several accounts ? Say , if I have two or three accounts and want to transfer money from one to the other ? 
 That's wonderful . 
 It was a pleasure , Mrs . Robinson . 
 I helped break ... I mean WASH ... all the dishes ! 
 Yeah , uh , it's outside . Listen , I really have to be going now . 
 Have you ever thought about Tom ’ s attitude ? 
 Love me , love my dog . He ’ s a sensible kind man . 
 Good afternoon , everyone . The experiment is to start at 3 . Have you gone through the instructions ? 
 Ok , now some points for attention . First of all , pay attention to safety ... Now , sign your names on the lab record , and after that you can start . If there is any question , just let me know . 
 Have you turned it on ? 
 Ok , I will get you another one . 
 Where do you come from ? 
 What's the climate like in your country ? 
 What's the weather like in spring ? 
 What's it like in summer ? 
 Is it cold or warm in autumn ? 
 Is it very cold in winter ? 
 It's time for bed . 
 It's quite late , and you have an early day tomorrow . 
 Why don't you try counting sheep ? 
 That's beside the point , you still need to go to bed . 
 If I let you do that , then you're just going to be up all night . 
 No , you're going to sleep now , so good night . 
 What qualities do you think a senior executive should possess ? 
 Do you have all these qualities ? 
 Sybil . Is that spelt with an I or a Y ? 
 Of course . 
 No . Actually I can stay longer . Dave called to say that there is a beautiful Chinese girl who ’ s going to pick me up at the school gate tonight at ten thirty instead of eight thirty . 
 Yeah . You know what Dave just said ? 
 He said I should put on something very nice , because this girl will be my next target . 
 He always makes fun of me . He always says things like that . You know the new coming teacher , a Chinese Canadian . He said she would really be my chance . 
 No , you ’ re kidding . I ’ m not taking it seriously . 
 You know-sweeping , scrubbing , washing , drying , waxing , polishing ... 
 You got that right ... and my mom's still mad about what we did with the dishes . 
 Listen , I'd better get back to the grindstone . 
 Excuse me , I ’ Ve been waiting here for fifteen minutes.Do you know why the traffic is so heavy ? 
 Oh , what a terrible situation ! This traffic is unbearable . 
 I agree with you . But now we have to wait . The sky is overcast , and it is very sultry . I fear a thunder storm is brewing . 
 Yes , I hope so . Thank you for telling me this . 
 Have you heard about the new iPhone ? 
 I'd like to . It's a cell phone , camera , PAD and mp3 player all in one . 
 how big is a shuffle iPod ? 
 how many gigs of music can it hold ? 
 how much do they cost ? 
 you're right , that's not bad at all . 
 I got one for my birthday when they first came out , but after the battery died out , I never brought another one . 
 that's one of the problems with having an iPod . Though an iPod might have an above average battery life , once the battery is dead , so is your iPod . 
 Many of the slower dances are danced to the lyrics of tragedies . He meant that you turned it into a comedy . 
 He meant it in a good way . You added a little spice to the performance . 
 Of course ! That's why I always say , Eat , drink and be Greek ! 
 I am an Assistant Electronics Engineer . 
 I've wanted to be involved in engineering ever since I was little . And my study has equipped me with a career as a mechanical engineer . 
 Do you have a reservation ? 
 Let me see if I can fit you in . What kind of room do you want ? 
 Smoking or non-smoking ? 
 You are in luck , we have one free . 
 That will be 600 RIB . Could I have your credit card please ? 
 A debit card will be fine . 
 You said it.No one can match Shakespeare in artistic talent . 
 Hello , Tom . Where are you heading for ? 
 Another terror film ? There is too much terror and violence in the films . Do you like seeing such a picture ? 
 Which department do you want to register with ? 
 Please pay the registration fee , 10 Yuan . 
 Your request for compensation makes me surprised . What happened ? 
 Could you tell me the particulars ? 
 Yes , I do . 
 Really ? We began to load the goods after we made sure they were qualified . 
 It's amazing to me how international business has become . Take my store for example . On any given day , you will find imported items from more than 20 different countries on our shelves . 
 China provides the bulk of our product inventory , for sure . We import more than 40 different items from China . Most of the imports that come out of China are low-grade plastics or toys . Japan produces many electronic exports , Germany produces excellent mechanical exports . 
 Generally speaking , food items are difficult to import . Food with the short shelf life is liable to spoil in the time it takes to ship from one place to another . The only food items we import are specialty canned or preserved foods . The shelf life is longer for these products . 
 The railway station ? Just go down this street and turn left at the second corner.The station is at the end of that street . 
 It's about a ten-minute walk . 
 Not at all . 
 I ’ d love to , but I ’ m a terrible dancer . I ’ m afraid I may step on your toes . 
 Thank you . I ’ ll try my best . 
 I used to work as a teacher . 
 Oh , if I hadn't moved here I would never thought of changing it . 
 It's a bit too large . Would you please shorten the sleeves ? 
 Besides , can you take up the hem one inch ? 
 How's your new apartment ? 
 What's wrong ? 
 Does it make a lot of noise ? 
 Could you help me ? 
 I can't seem to find my class . 
 It's in the C building . 
 Do you think you can tell me where it is ? 
 It's room number 261 . 
 Could you show me where it is ? 
 This shirt is really nice . 
 OK . I'll try on a medium size . 
 Where is the fitting room ? 
 It's too big tor me . Do you have a smaller one ? 
 Excuse me , sir . I wonder if I could exchange the shoes for a larger one . 
 Here you are . 
 Why don ’ t we go for Teppanyaki tonight ? 
 Actually , I haven ’ t had a pizza for a while . Let ’ s do that then . 
 If it were up to me , I ’ d prefer to go to Pizza Hut . The toppings are much tastier . 
 See you tonight . 
 Why are you so excited ? 
 This was your first time voting , wasn ’ t it ? 
 That is so lucky of you . 
 You turned 18 a month before the election . 
 Are you serious ? 
 Congratulations on being a part of history . 
 Why ? They keep going up . 
 Come in , young man . 
 I am Smith , the personnel director . Please have a seat , son . 
 Actually , I haven ’ t had time to look it over . Did you bring another copy with you ? 
 Call me Mr . Smith . 
 when are you going to give me those brochures ? 
 I know , but I want to make reservations this week . 
 Wake up , it's time for school . 
 You have to get up and get ready for school . 
 I can't let you go back to sleep , because you won't wake back up . 
 You still need to eat breakfast , take a shower , and get dressed . 
 I don't want you to be late for school today . 
 Fine , five more minutes . 
 Hey , Jim . It's time to wake up and get out of bed . 
 You'd better get up , or you'll be late . 
 Yes , it did . It went off thirty minutes ago . You slept right through it . You're like a dead person while you sleep . 
 Rise and shine ! Sleepyhead ! 
 The early bird gets the worm . 
 Ha ! Ha ! If you don't make an effort now , later on it'll be a lot tougher for you . 
 It it true of many countries . 
 Sure . If people are near in blood , they might pass on some genetic disease to the next generation . 
 Thursday . 
 I'd love to . 
 Good morning . 
 Of course not . But I don't know when to get off . 
 I'm going to Wangfujing . 
 Thank you very much . 
 sure I am . I've been writing a blog for almost three years . 
 I began blogging when I first went to the US for my graduate strides . 
 at first , I'll write about my life there . Like interesting things on the campus , travel stories , special English words that I come across . Sometimes , I'll post my pictures on my blog so my family an 
 it's random . If there happen to be a lot of things going on , I may add several new entries in a week , and if I've got nothing to share , I may leave my blog untouched for weeks . 
 sure , since I came back from the US , I've been keeping the habit of blogging , simply to share my personal insights on any topic I like . 
 I made a reservation three days ago.My name is George Smith . 
 That's very kind of you . 
 Thirty bucks a record . Or five for one hundred and twenty bucks . 
 Absolutely . I bought them from the King's estate myself ! Tell you what-I'll let you have five for one hundred bucks . 
 OK . Five for eighty-five bucks . That's my final offer . 
 Excuse me . I have just missed the connection plane due to the heavy fog in London . Can I change my ticket now ? 
 Here you are . 
 The next one to my destination . I have to be there as soon as possible . 
 No , sir . Where to ? 
 OK . Please step in . I know where it is . 
 No , what's up ? 
 You're joking ! 
 Our national economy is increasing hand over fist . 
 I hope it ’ ll continue for a long time . 
 What can I do for you ? 
 What's your flight number ? 
 Yes , it's true . It has been delayed . 
 Yes , of course . The delay is due to heavy rain . 
 I am sorry , we don't know the extent of the delay at present . But according to the latest weather forecast , there will be a change in weather soon . 
 It's hard to say . Weather is so changeable in the summer . Please listen to the latest announcement about your flight . 
 Bye 
 I have got a run . Can you tell me where is the restroom ? 
 No , thank you . I have brought some . 
 My chief interest is swimming and climbing with my friends . 
 I think that the most important thing is you can ’ t live all by himself . It takes a lot of people working and cooperating together . The more really close friends I have , the better . 
 What can I do for you , Madam ? 
 What size do you take ? 
 How about this pair ? They're well-made . 
 In fact , They'll stretch a bit later . 
 All right.Here you are . 
 What game do you like ? 
 I ’ Ve never played Chinese chess before , but I ’ Ve seen old men playing it in the street . It looks complicated . 
 I like playing cards . I ’ m pretty good at poker . Do you play cards ? 
 Do you play bridge ? 
 I can play quite well . I have a friend who likes playing , but she ’ s not very good at it . Shall I invite her to play ? 
 I ’ ll call my friend now . you call yours . 
 What am I doing ? What am I doing ? Don ’ t you know what day it is ? 
 It ’ s only the day when the world ’ s biggest sporting event is kicking off . 
 The World Cup ! The first match is today ! It ’ s Mexico vs . South Africa ! It ’ s going to be a really good match ! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players . I think that South Africa 
 This is bigger than the Super Bowl , man ! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy . They first start in a group stage with bigger groups , each g 
 Are you kidding ? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup ! It ’ s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport ! Each nation is cheering on their team , hoping they will bec 
 Whatever , I ’ m going to go watch the opening match . 
 Yes.Do you like it ? 
 Really ? I've never heard that before . I just like it . 
 Yes . What about you ? 
 Pop music doesn't have any depth for me . 
 Did you always like pop music . 
 I didn't like it at all until I started to learn violin when I was eight . From then on . classical music has been an important part of my life . 
 Sometimes , but these days I'm often too busy . 
 But he's really kind at heart . 
 Actually I have a passion for Chinese literature . 
 Yeah , those classics from the great writers . 
 I feel terrible , but I've just broken your ashtray . 
 I don't know what to say . I'd like to replace it . 
 Sorry to bother you , but do you have change for a one ? 
 I need it for the parking meter . 
 The doctor sent me over here to have my blood drawn . 
 What is this test for ? 
 What does that tell him ? 
 Will the blood test hurt ? 
 Ouch ! 
 Good morning . I need to speak with the property manager , please . 
 While it was raining last night , water started leaking in from the ceiling . 
 It was in the living room . 
 We are on the bottom floor . 
 Yes , someone will be here to let you in . 
 Sorry to interrupt . Can I have a word with you ? 
 I want to have a continental breakfast . 
 Neither , can I have them scrambled ? 
 Thanks for your hospitality . 
 Do you need any help ? 
 Walk along the way and then turn left , It's right there . 
 No , you don't have to . It's a duty-free shop . 
 Johnny , are you just sitting around again ? 
 I'd say all you've done is moved the dirt from the windows on to your face and hands . Disgraceful ! 
 Your best isn't good enough . Back in my day , I'd clean a whole hospital with a toothbrush and spit , and it'd be twice as clean as this sty ! 
 Hey , if you're not busy this weekend , would you like to go see a movie ? 
 How about that European movie ? 
 Yeah , that's the one I've heard the special effects and the plot are outstanding . 
 Okay , see you then . 
 My pleasure . Release the parking brake , and we're almost ready to go . 
 OK . Relax . This car is an automatic , so you don't have to worry about a clutch . 
 What's wrong with the photocopier ? 
 I need to make six copies of this report for the Board Meeting tomorrow . Ring Office Supplies and ask if they have any in stock . If they can't deliver this afternoon , I'll go and collect it . 
 Well , George . I guess I am . Why do you ask ? 
 Yeah , definitely ! Thanks for inviting me . 
 I really wanted to watch the Star Wars on the opening day , but the pre-sale tickets were sold out . How did you manage to get hold of them ? 
 You paid 50 dollars for each ticket ? That's a huge premium over the regular price . 
 Wow ! I am really honored you went through all this trouble just for my sake . I really appreciate that . So , what time are we going ? 
 8 pm , that's fine with me . 
 So I'll see you tomorrow then at 8 . 
 Ok , George . Bye ! 
 Good evening . Welcome to our program . 
 Would you tell us your name , please ? 
 Glad to meet you , Ms.Baker . 
 Where are you from , Ms.Baker ? 
 What do you do for a living ? 
 Thank you for coming , Ms.baker . 
 Be careful of what you say , or you ’ ll have to eat humble pie . 
 Hello , Mr . Smith , I am returning to Shanghai by the 10:00 plane . I am calling to thank you for all your help during my stay here . 
 Next time you are in Shanghai , please let me know , and let me be of some assistance to you . 
 Have a nice flight back , and take care . Thanks for your call . 
 I ’ m in the middle of something right now . I ’ ll be there in a second . 
 Alright , alright . I ’ m coming . 
 You know what , I have to pick something up at the mall , so why don ’ t you clean the floors and I'll go to the supermarket and get all the groceries . 
 Hey , honey I ’ m back . Wow , the house looks really good ! 
 Just a sec I ’ m just gonna vacuum this rug real fast . 
 I have a taste for something sweet . 
 I want some kind of dessert . 
 I was thinking about ordering some kind of pie . 
 I honestly don't know . 
 What's your favorite kind ? 
 That sounds really good to me right now . 
 Here's the restaurant we're meeting the Smiths at . 
 After you . 
 Sure . I usually have my lunch here . The food is tasty and they offer a big variety . 
 I'll have ham and egg with French fries . What dessert do you want ? 
 Where shall we sit ? 
 Mmmm ... This apartment seems a little expensive . Do you have any cheap studios ? 
 Do you think any studios will open up soon ? 
 Mrs . Reynolds ? This is Martin Gross calling . 
 Well , I ’ Ve got the spread sheets you asked for , but I ’ m still waiting on some data from accounting . 
 More and more women don ’ t want to stay at home and keep house now . 
 Now , many people think that women ’ s liberation is a kind of civilization , but children are getting less love from their mother because of that . What is your opinion ? 
 Hi . This is the Customer Service . How can I help you ? 
 Is it under warranty ? 
 Yes , it is still covered by our warranty . Tell me the mode number of your vacuum , please . 
 What ’ s your address , your name and your phone number ? 
 Okay . There are two Customer Service Offices in your area . The nearest one is Chadwick and Hacks Appliances . 
 Sure . 878 Fennel South . 
 You have to call the office first . 
 My pleasure . 
 Your boyfriend , Bryan , wanted to toss the football . I think he wore me out . 
 You're like the tenth person to say that . 
 Whatever . I wish people would just leave me alone ! 
 No problem . You know him . He ’ s the kind of guy that ’ s always willing to go the extra miles . 
 I bet he will come . 
 Why ? 
 Really ? Congratulations . 
 No problem , but you've got to be careful . 
 Here's the key then . 
 No . We ’ ll get a cab . It ’ s faster than taking the bus or the subway . 
 How much will it cost ? 
 Taxi ! ! ! 
 Yeah . I met with them back in March , remember ? 
 Driver , 1600 Pennsylvania Ave . , please . 
 Sorry , he ’ s on another phone . Will you hold ? 
 That'll be eight dollars , please . 
 I'll help you , Lucy . Look at what I've got here . In this small bottle , there's a magic love potion . 
 Yes . If you put a few drops on someone's eyelids while he's asleep , he'll fall in love with the first person he sees when he wakes up . 
 Take my word for it . 
 Just come to our house and stay over . You'll sit by his bed and greet him like a beautiful red rose , ' Good morning ! ' 
 Don't be so shy , Lucy . 
 Yes , there are 62 in totals , and 2 of them still can't be sure . 
 6 . So we should give them special attention . Some of them don't have a good health . 
 2 should be enough , for each one has at least 30 seats . There will be some seats to spare . 
 Yes , most of them think it's good . But , some people have different opinions . They consider we should arrange some challenging activities . 
 That's good . I'll tell them later . And what kind of medicine we should be prepared ? 
 OK , we should get them ready this afternoon . 
 Oh , God . I've almost forgotten . I'll get it done right away . 
 I'd prefer to go abroad , if possible . 
 I'm one of them . 
 He is really terrific ! 
 What can I do for you today ? 
 Were you looking at a particular refrigerator ? 
 This particular refrigerator is a very good choice . 
 Not only is it affordable , but it comes with all the appliances . 
 It has an ice maker , water dispenser , and plenty of room on the inside . 
 Go right ahead . 
 Sorry , I overslept . My clock didn't go off this morning . 
 That's right , even though I did set the alarm last night . 
 Well , if it breaks down again tomorrow , I'll definitely buy a new one . 
 No , most of the traditional festivals of the minority nationalities are not official . 
 What an idea ! 
 Whose name did you pick ? 
 Booze ! 
 Hello , this is IBA Bank . Maria speaking , how may I help ? 
 Not a problem . Which loan was it you were interested in ? Sorry , I must ask , because the interest rates can depend on the type of loan you apply for . 
 One of our most popular ! The usual interest rate is fixed by the PBC . That is The People's Bank of China . But of course , with some loans , credit rating and loan amount come into play , too . 
 That is correct . 
 I want to start a tradition of family vacations with our family right now before we have kids . 
 Yes , so this year we are going to take our first family vacation , just you and I . 
 I don't know yet . 
 I want to go all out if we can afford it . 
 What are you doing here today ? 
 Is the arresting officer in the courtroom today ? 
 What's your case ? 
 Do you believe that the officer lied ? 
 Your license plate was caught on camera ? 
 Since there is no picture of your license plate on record , I'm going to let you go . 
 How many pieces of luggage would you like to check in , sir ? 
 Do you have any carry-on luggage ? 
 Put your luggage on the scale , please . Oh , your luggage is overweight . 
 Twenty-two dollars 
 This is your voucher , and you can get your luggage back on this . Have a good trip ! 
 We'd like to welcome everyone to the Michelson Tools factory site , and thank everyone for being here today . My name is Paul Shafer , I'll be showing you around today . Please feel free to ask questions at any point during our tour , I'll be happy to answer questions for you . 
 That's an excellent question . I'll bet your wondering why we ask you to wear hard hats and safety googles while you's in the plant . The reason is simple , we care about your safety and we want to ensure there are no injuries today . As you will see , to maintain a high level of safety , we also require all of our staff to wear similar protective gear . 
 It should take about twenty minutes to go through the main plant , and maybe another ten to take a look at the laboratory . All together our tour should last about half an hour . 
 Well , if you don't have any questions , shall we get started ? If you'll follow me , first I'll take you to the site of our semi-conductor system ... 
 Well , I love hip hop dancing , so I should probably dance . Do you know how to rap ? 
 Excellent . I'll start practicing my dance moves . 
 Hello there . I need some advice about personal finance . Could you help me please ? 
 Well , I've been very busy recently and I'm having trouble keeping up to date with everything , so I just wondered what exact service you offer . 
 That sounds perfect and just what I'm looking for . 
 Give me a break . You don't care about the colors . You just like the hot babe on the cover . 
 Of course . I'm currently the subscriber of 10 different fashion magazines . 
 I guess I'm lending them to you ... 
 It's not even noon yet . 
 I am dying from the heat . 
 It doesn't work . 
 I don't know . 
 Of course . 
 He's busy . He said next week . 
 I want to be in a higher managerial position in the field of international marketing . I ’ m very interested in the European market hopefully , in Brussels . 
 It ’ s truly exciting to work in newly emerging unified market . Brussels will be center of the new market in the continent . 
 My experience in my last job showed that I have the talent to motivate people . It could be seen from the low absentee rate in my team . I want to continue that kind of contribution and to further develop this potential . 
 I want to apply my knowledge and experience to a challenging position and finally move on to management level . 
 I think the most important thing is the nature of the job . One should never do anything one is not interested in . To me , pleasant working conditions with co-operative staff are also important . 
 I like baseball the best . 
 Yeah . I played until I graduated from high school . 
 I think I tried every position , but the last few years , I played third base . 
 It was scary at first , but after awhile , I got used to it . If you have fast reflexes , then it's not really a problem . What position did you play ? 
 I wish I could play again , but there isn't much opportunities around here . 
 When do you guys play ? 
 Sounds pretty fun . I'll come out and join you next time . 
 Yes , I can , but not very well . 
 More or less . How well do you understand Mr . Wang , your Chinese teacher ? 
 This is the menu . What would you like to have ? 
 With pleasure , sir . May I suggest Steamed stuffed buns and deep-fried twisted dough sticks ? They are popular breakfast among Chinese people . 
 Yes , sir . We usually serve soya-bean milk and jellied beancurd . Which one do you prefer , sir ? A 
 So , that's steamed stuffed buns and deep-fried twisted dough sticks , and a Soya-bean milk . 
 Thank you , sir . Just a moment , please . 
 OK , here you are . 
 Of course , you can . Wait a moment . 
 It's really different , isn't it ? 
 I hope you're hungry because the pizza here is huge as well as to die for . 
 Well , let's order one for starters . 
 That happens to be my favorite . Waiter , I think we're ready to order . 
 Really ? Why ? What happened ? 
 Oh , no . 
 So what did you do ? 
 You what ? 
 Wow , good for you . 
 Oh , no ! 
 You really have bad luck , don't you ? 
 What do you think about the apartment so far ? 
 You don ’ t have any problems with how it looks ? 
 Like what ? 
 Those stains will be cleaned out of the carpet before you move in . 
 Yes . Now what other problems do you have ? 
 Well , I ’ m glad that everything else is to your liking . 
 I think I found my Yankee's mug ... 
 It fell out of the garbage bag . 
 It was with all the other dishes from dinner . 
 I think our son was trying to pull a fast one on us . 
 I feel confident of his ability to cure my daughter's disease . 
 I can tell form the way he spoke to us . 
 Do you believe in god ? 
 I ’ m not sure . Why don ’ t you believe there is a god ? 
 I basically believe in science over theology . I mean , I believe in evolution for example . However , there are many things that science hasn ’ t explained yet . 
 For example ? 
 Yes . Such people don ’ t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs . 
 Actually , yes I do . I was wondering about the subscription fee . And how much will you charge me during the time of redeeming this new fund ? 
 So , it's going to cost me then ? 
 Sarah , you don't look so good . What's the matter ? 
 It sounds like you're coming down with something . 
 Oh , are the connections correct ? 
 Let me see . Look ! You confused the video frequency with the audio frequency . 
 Can it work now ? 
 So what's the problem ? Maybe there is something wrong with the disk . 
 Give it to me . 
 Uh , the movie of Tom Hanks . I know why it can't play . This is a DVD disk . 
 I like the freedom of summer with no school . 
 And I like the festivities of winter with Thanksgiving , Christmas and New Year . 
 And I really like the smells and colors of spring . 
 But I must say , if it were only for the weather , I like autumn most ! 
 Sure ! What do you feel like having ? 
 Oh . OK . I don't eat meat , but that's fine , I am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right ? 
 I'm not , I am a vegan . 
 A vegan . I don't eat or use any animal based products . I don't wear leather , eat eggs , drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . I used to be a pescatarian before , which basically means you don't eat meat , but still have fish and seafood . 
 It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes , but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays , it's getting a bit less difficult . 
 Nothing , how about you ? 
 Oh , really ? 
 Probably not . 
 I don't feel like going . 
 I really can't stand going to parties . 
 Sorry about that . 
 I've no idea . I'd like to listen to your suggestion . 
 Well , I'll try gin and tonic . 
 Hi Julie . Yeah . I've been on a diet for a couple of months now . 
 Thanks for noticing . 
 I joined a health club and my trainer gave me tips on eating . With a combination of eating better and exercising , I managed to lose 15 pounds in 2 months . 
 Mostly on how to exercise , but the best advice I got was changing my eating habits . Instead of eating 3 times a day , she told me to eat 5 times a day . 
 Actually , I'm eating the same amount . I eat 5 smaller meals a day . Basically , it naturally speeds up the metabolism and helps to burn fat at a faster rate . 
 You don't need to lose weight . 
 Ah ... but remember to incorporate a little exercise into your diet . 
 No problem . 
 Every five minutes . 
 It comes on the dot . 
 I ’ d say the main reason is poverty . Countries and their people get frustrated because they have so little . If their neighbors have some resources , they try to steal them by military force . 
 several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end . 
 I don ’ t think that there is any easy way . The united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . The thing is to find the real pro 
 It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it ’ s harder to make peace between countries . 
 The problem is that many poor people might suffer . 
 I just lost my job . My boss just told me . 
 I don't understand of myself . It seems they have to save money . 
 Excuse me , Miss . The total works wrong . What are these extra charges ? 
 Well . What's this 138 dollars charge then ? 
 Oh , right . I forgot about that . Sorry , I'll pay cash . 
 OK ! What about taking them outside and flying a kite . 
 Why do you want to go to the U . S . ? 
 What will you do when you come home ? 
 Do you feel your English is good enough for the course ? 
 Who will be your supporter during your stay in the States ? 
 How long do you expect to stay there ? 
 I can ’ t believe it ! 
 Yes , but I bet $ 200 dollars on the Cougars ! 
 I can ’ t believe it ! I thought the Cougars were going to win for sure . 
 20 to 1 , in favour of the Cougars ! 
 Joseph , who is that woman ? 
 What does she do for work ? 
 Is she American ? 
 She's really tall . Do you know her ? 
 Who's that man standing next to her ? 
 That short guy on her right . What's his name ? 
 He's really good looking . 
 Do you know him ? 
 Is he married ? 
 I remember now . I met him before . 
 No , not at all . Go ahead . 
 I go to movies ; I go to lectures ; I listen to the radio ; I do lots of things . Most importantly , I practice every chance I get . 
 Sure . It ’ s like understanding on the telephone — — you can ’ t see the speaker ! It ’ s great for improving listening comprehension . 
 It certainly does . But if you practice speaking every spare minute and learn useful sentences every day you can make big progress . 
 Hello . I'm here to get my salary . 
 No problem . 
 I think just 3,000 RIB will be enough . 
 OK , but I think you should keep an eye on your plan if you see what I mean . 
 No buts . The thing is to cut down your expense , Judie . 
 Sure . What's up ? 
 Oh , this's easy . You can take the subway to 34 street . You'll see it as you get out . 
 What are you studying all day long for ? It ’ s summer vacation ! 
 Why ? 
 Do you think it will help ? 
 Hmm ... Maybe I should sign up too . 
 Can I help you ? 
 Come this way please.We ' Ve got plenty of them and they're all on the shelf near the cashier's desk . 
 You're welcome . 
 Amalgamated Trading Company . It's Swiss . Don't you think working at a foreign company would be glamorous ? 
 Well , it's small , but it's a young , dynamic , rapidly-growing company with a progressive , humanistic philosophy . 
 Four times . I'm totally prepared . Oh , no ! I forgot to take off my nail polish ! And I have to be there in 15 minutes ! That's it . I blew it . 
 But the competition is fierce this year ... and it seems like I'm the only one left who hasn't found a job . 
 Hi , is this Professor Clark ’ s office ? 
 Hi , this is Kalina from your morning literature class . 
 I had a skydiving accident over the weekend and won ’ t be able to come to school today . 
 I broke my leg , but it is healing . 
 I should be able to return by next Monday . 
 My mother bought me a new video game . 
 Well , the hero is a Super Warrior . He has to fight the bad guys to find the treasure . 
 There are a lot ! Two really bad ones are Giant Monster and Human Spider . 
 It's in a dungeon , under a castle . 
 It's not easy to find . Anyway , you can come to my home after school today and try . 
 What would you like to eat tonight ? 
 Do you think Kentucky fried chicken is good ? 
 Jack , what's wrong ? 
 What are you talking about ? What did I do ? 
 No ... that's not what I meant . I didn't mean that . She asked me where you were and I jokingly said that you were on a date with Sara . I thought Martha knew that you and Sara were just friends . 
 I'm sorry man . I didn't know . I didn't mean to screw anything up . 
 Look . I really didn't mean to , and next time I see Martha , I'll really tell her that you and Sara are really just friends . 
 Could you have a taxi pick me up and take me to the airport before 1 p . m . ? 
 I live at 323 Park Street . 
 What are your rates ? 
 I have four very large suitcases . Will those fit in the taxi ? 
 Well , that was an interesting documentary ! 
 Like what ? 
 Yeah , I know it sounds weird , but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . Through a you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire , you can rest peacefully on your nest egg . 
 That seems a bit unstable don ’ t you think ? 
 I ’ Ve been thinking of doing that lately ! I don ’ t want some banker to run off with my money ! 
 Kobi Bryant and Shaquille O ’ Neal , they are the Los Angeles Lakers ’ star players . 
 Wait a second . He shoots , he scores ! 
 Here comes Jordan , though . 
 Yeah . He ’ s older , so he doesn ’ t slam , as much as he did when he was younger , but when he does , it ’ s still amazing . 
 The Lakers . Jordan is the only good player Washington has . 
 It's something relative hackers . I often hear people talking about them , but I don't know much about them . 
 You mean a guy using enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the computer ? 
 But why are people always having such a negative attitude towards them ? 
 What is crackers then ? 
 So they are two totally different concepts . 
 I see . Then the basic different is , hackers build things , crackers break them . 
 Thanks a lot . 
 Can I give you a hand ? 
 This broth is wonderful . What's in it ? 
 Hey ! Watch out ! You're using the same spoon for both broths ! 
 You're getting that hot stuff in my mild broth ! 
 Hello , I ’ d like to speak to Kate . 
 It ’ s ok . I ’ ll call her back latter . Thank you . 
 I am calling to find out why I didn ’ t receive an unemployment check this week . 
 I think I forgot to send it in ! 
 Can I send it in now ? 
 Can I mail it in early next time so it isn ’ t late ? 
 Will my paycheck come right away now ? 
 What ’ s happened ? Is there a problem ? 
 You'll have to dismantle the unit and lubricate the bearings . Do it as quickly as you can but make sure you top up the oil before you start the motor up again . 
 It's ok . What do you want to ask ? 
 The first place you should go is the International Center . 
 You can get help there in dealing with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service ; you can find Foreign Student Advisers . 
 They'll discuss personal concerns , housing , adjustment , finances and other matters with you . 
 Yes , a lot more . If you go there just before the beginning of the fall's semester , you can get your student ID and social security number there . They will keep your documents up-to-date . They will offer an orientation program for new comers . They will also help you contact your department and registration office . 
 Besides these , the center staff also works with community organizations which provide tours , home hospitality , speaking engagements and assistance for wives of foreign students . In cooperation with nationality clubs , student associations and other organizations , the International Center provides a varied program of cultural and social events throughout the year . 
 It sure is . They also serve tea , coffee and refreshments . The Center staff members are also friendly and helpful . Everyone loves them . 
 Ok , let ’ s start opening some presents ! 
 This next one is from Betty . 
 One more from Carla . 
 OK , that ’ s all of them.No more gifts . Now who wants to guess when the baby is due ? 
 Good afternoon , how may I help you ? 
 Who are they for ? 
 What kind of flowers would you like ? 
 OK . What's the reason you are sending her flowers ? 
 Do you know what kind of flowers she likes ? 
 Well , they're for your wife , so I think you should give her roses . 
 What color ? 
 Do you want to pick them up or should we deliver them ? 
 What's the address ? 
 Excuse me , are cameras allowed here ? 
 I see . What a pity . I have to appreciate it carefully . 
 My elder aunt feels like vomiting , she is pregnant . 
 But she feels like having no appetite at all if she stays at home all day . 
 The Great Wall is a great attraction for visitors . 
 Someone claimed it was one of the two man-made wonders that could be seen on the moon . 
 Excuse me , sir.Is there anything I can do for you ? 
 Is it this one ? 
 You are welcome . Looking forward to seeing you again . 
 Yes , please . 
 What's the price difference ? 
 Just fill it up with Regular , Unleaded , please . 
 Yes , I would . Thanks a lot . 
 Well , how long will it be ? 
 OK . We'll wait . 
 This first one , I have a question ... This graph is marking the sales performance for our line of hair products , right ? Can this line be right ? It looks like our sales plummeted . I can't believe we did that poorly ... If I remember correctly , sales went down slightly , but not as dramatically as the graph shows . 
 Well , the good news is the new industrial cleaning products really took off . Look how the sales have shot up over the last two weeks . 
 At lease they stayed the same . That's better than dropping . 
 Yes . 
 But it's the style now . 
 Of course . 
 Why is that ? 
 Oh , I see . 
 What happened to her ? 
 I see . 
 Can I help you ? 
 One moment please , Ms White . 
 I've reserved rooms 402 and 403 for you . 
 Well they are facing the street 
 We'd like quiet rooms thanks . 
 Mom ! ? ? ? 
 Mmm ... 
 I have the chills . Can you turn on the heater ? 
 Paul , is this Paul , isn't it ? 
 Small world , isn't it ? 
 you're finally here ! What took so long ? 
 it's always rather congested down there during rush hour . Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home . 
 perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work . 
 it would be better for the environment , too . 
 taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well . 
 well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides . 
 so , are you going to quit driving to work then ? 
 Hey Jack . What's going on ? 
 Really ? When did you decide this ? 
 That's exciting , man . 
 You shouldn't use my example . It wasn't special . I kind of wish I made it more special but it's too late now . 
 There are a lot of options . You can surprise her over dinner , or ask her in a public area , or if you have the balls , ask her father in front of her . 
 Thought about what ? 
 I don't know . You should know how she's going to react . She is your girlfriend . 
 Don't mention it . Good luck . You're going to need it . 
 Oh . I am sorry . I was busy looking for some whisky.Can you tell me the exactly place where I can find any ? 
 Who's the man that is kicking the boy ? 
 Does he often beat his son ? 
 Have you had enough time to look over the menu ? 
 Let me remind you of the specials of the day , which are posted on the board . 
 Yes , we would be happy to prepare the food to meet your special needs . 
 Yes , the roasted vegetable salad is good , and the portabella mushroom burger is also a good choice . 
 That is an excellent choice , and I could bring you your salads now or bring them with your dinner . 
 Could you recommend something to drink ? 
 We would also like some alcohol before the main dish . 
 Would you travel around the world if you had the money ? 
 Can you put me through to Mr . Lining ? 
 I am calling to let you know that you are selected to fill the position of Project Manager . 
 By the way , are you married ? 
 So how did you meet Bill ? 
 Oh , really ? Which bulletin board ? 
 I've heard about that , but I've never tried it . 
 I have no desire to talk on a network with a bunch of strangers . 
 I just want a private conversation with one other person . 
 Well , maybe I'll tag along and watch how you talk . 
 It ’ s that popular ? 
 Excuse me , but could I use your bathroom ? 
 Thanks . 
 Okay , if you'll please fill out these forms ... ( She hands the forms to the customer . ) There's a minimum initial deposit of $ 100 for the checking account , and a minimum deposit of $ 500 for the savings account . 
 Certainly . Just make them out to National Bank , and sign and date them . 
 Excuse me . What should I wear if I want to go to an interview ? 
 I am afraid I would tense up during the interview . 
 You have been here for how long ? Four months now ? 
 Do you know Chinese better now ? 
 Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere . 
 A shouting match ? You ’ re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ’ t believe it . 
 Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don ’ t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it ’ s quite natural to us . 
 George speaks Japanese better than Frank . 
 Therefore , I hope they could help each other and learn from each other . 
 Yes , it is . But I'm afraid we haven't met before . 
 Hello Greg . Yes , that's correct . You see , we have just acquired a new partner , the transaction is huge . It's to be signed next month , and we would really like to have some clearer information about them . 
 That's right . I feel it's always better to go in with both eyes open , if you know what I mean . 
 The lady at the desk , Shelly I think , told me you offer many other consultancy services . 
 That's good to know . Thanks for your help today , I'll leave you with the details and you can get started . 
 I know what you mean , it leaves a lot to be desired . 
 Have you found anything yet ? 
 You should be able to find something comfortable in town , though that would be kind of far from school . 
 But the parking might be . 
 I've brought some potato chips . Would you like some , Jack ? 
 That'll be fine . Thanks . 
 I forgot to bring it , but maybe Mary has some . Let's go and ask her . 
 yes , you sent them to New York , right ? 
 what did you in mind ? 
 we have plenty of postcards to choose from here . The same designs can be found on these posters . 
 yes , we do . They're on the wall behind you . 
 the prices are clearly marked on the back of each mask . Would you like me to get one down for you to look at ? 
 here you go . 
 are you looking for some homemade chocolate as a gift . 
 we've got plenty to choose from here . 
 Mary is such a cautious girl ! 
 She never puts words into her mouth , she only repeats the opinions of others . 
 How many courses do you have for this semester ? 
 How are they proportioned ? 
 Hi , still in the office ? It ’ s already 7 . 
 Sounds like our boss . Typically him always late with important information . Anything I can help ? 
 Ok , shall I make a coffee first ? 
 May I try on this dress ? 
 Overseas operator , may I help you ? 
 Can you tell me the name and number of the person you want ? 
 Please wait a moment . It Will take a few seconds to get through . 
 I've been told about something called Southern Fund . How can I buy it ? 
 That sounds simple enough . Do you charge any admin fees for that ? 
 Do you need any other documentation from me ? 
 Oh , man . I had the best supper last night . My wife made a stir-fry and it was amazing ! 
 Well , you can keep the vegetables , I ’ ll take the meat . The stir fry my wife made was really hearty , with chunks of beef and slivers of bell peppers and onion ... 
 We're in big trouble , Jason . Nick is beating us by a long shot . 
 OK , comeback kid . Here's you last question.How many times did Robin Williams win the Oscar for Best Actor ? 
 Nope , sorry ! Actually , Robin Williams has never won an Oscar for Best Actor--only for Best Supporting Actor ! 
 Thank you . My wife would be very happy to hear this . 
 You bet . 
 Certainly.How do you like to have it made ? 
 You may rest assured . 
 By the end of next week . 
 morning , Mary ? It ’ s John Kramer calling . You remember you handled my tax forms for me ? 
 Better than ever ! You won ’ t have to worry about “ finding ” extra money for me anymore ! We made nearly a quarter of million in profit last year ! 
 I hate to do this to you , Alice , but I ’ m going to have to ask you to put in some more overtime . 
 Well , I would have preferred to do it today , but if you ’ Ve already made plans , we can do it tomorrow . 
 What a busy week ! 
 Right.How are you going to spend your weekend ? 
 Would you like to play some tennis with me before going home ? 
 You should try it.It ' s a great game . Come on , let me help you . I'm a good player , and a good teacher , too.What do you say ? 
 That was a pretty good shot , Mary . 
 Let me help you with your serve . 
 Of course , you can.All you need is a little help and a lot of practice . 
 Well , maybe not a Michael Zhang , but better than the average . Person would you like to play again Wednesday ? 
 You know John ? 
 Yes . I ’ Ve read news about him in today ’ s paper . 
 I wish he could too . 
 He ’ s a bit tired , you know . It often takes him a couple of hours to brush up . 
 Good luck to them . 
 Do you mean the ' I love you ' virus that attacks computers through e-mail ? 
 This is terrible . Why do hackers play such a dirty trick ? 
 So they create viruses to tell people they are smart ? That's really sick . 
 I hope they ’ re not too hard ! 
 I think that I would be a perfect fit in this company . I have a unique combination of strong technical acumen , and outstanding soft skills . you know , I excel at building strong , long-term customer relationships . For example , when I headed the customer support department in my previous company , our team solved about seventy percent of our customers ’ problems . I decided that we needed better information and technical preparation on our products , so after I implemented a series of training sessions in coordination with our technical department , we were able to solve ninety percent of our customers ’ issues . Given the opportunity , I could bring this kind of success to this company . 
 I struggle with organization and time management . Punctuality has never been a strength of mine . I find it hard to organize my time efficiently . I have actually addressed this weakness recently , by attending a workshop on efficient time management . It helped me a lot , by providing me with great insights on how to get organized and use my time efficiently , so I think I ’ m getting better now . 
 Great , thanks a lot ! I hope to hear from you ! Good bye . 
 We planned our wedding for next May . 
 Yeah , I did . But my fiancee has an important project . 
 Julie ’ s friend , Mary . And John will be the best man . 
 Where shall we go on vacation this summer ? 
 Venice . I have great interests in the boats . 
 I like the country too . It's quite famous for its culture . 
 What for ? 
 My phone has got lot of static . 
 About five years old . 
 Sure , where is your office ? 
 When are you available ? 
 Alright , I'll bring it in this afternoon . 
 Well , Jeff , that was a very productive meeting , I thought . You had some really great ideas in there ! 
 No , I mean it . Look , are you hungry ? Shall we go get something to eat ? 
 OK , well , let me just get my coat and we'll go to the diner around the corner . 
 Are you busy tomorrow morning ? 
 Someone has to pick up the boss at the airport . 
 Excuse me , could I have a menu please ? 
 I want to try the local specialty . Can you recommend me some ? 
 Fine , bring us double . 
 No . I don ’ t suppose he ’ s to blame . The man in the other car made a big mistake . 
 Yeah . I think everyone should go easy on driving . 
 Good idea . I'll get some , too . 
 Sure . We have to have something to lie on while we're catching some rays . 
 No hat for me , but I'm getting this cool pair of shades . 
 Have you given the puppies food yet ? 
 Good job ! Please give them a bath later on today . 
 Thanks . But don't forget that they have a vet appointment this Saturday . 
 They need to be there at eleven in the morning . 
 Don't tell me you're pregnant again . 
 What kind of personality do you think you have ? 
 Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ? 
 Are you more of a follower or a leader ? 
 What did you say ? 
 Well , I feel a little tired . 
 Then can you wait a few minutes ? I want to finish writing this letter . 
 I won't be long . No more than ten minutes . Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you in the park ? 
 How did you do that ? 
 You're right--Italian ! Ha ! Ha ! I was trying to trick you , but you didn't fall for it ! 
 I could give you a few pointers if you want . I know a lot about coffee . 
 I'm Robert , at your service . 
 What will you do now ? Propose to her . 
 You should strike while the iron is hot . 
 Hello . What can we do for you today ? 
 OK , could you give me your details and I'll see if it has cleared . We need your banking details and some ID . A passport or something like that ? 
 Mr Jurgen , yes , the remittance has been successful . 
 Not a problem , Sir . Please fill in this exchange form and show me your passport . 
 But many roads are very narrow . 
 Yes , because of fewer people . 
 Yes , I would like to check in . 
 Yes , my name is Carol Tiang . That's spelled J - I - A - N - G . 
 No , I don't have it with me.But I know I have a reservation . My husband made it for me last month . 
 C - A - R - O - L . Carol . 
 No , that's not me . My name is Tiang , not Larson . My husband reserved for me . 
 His name is Lin , L - I - N . 
 Miss , I know he made this reservation for me . 
 Oh , yes.Thank you . I'd be glad to . 
 I'm sure the output of your production will increase a lot . 
 That's my grand-father . He was a farmer . When he was young , he had to take the water buffalo to graze in the field . 
 My grandfather did that too . He used the time to study instead . 
 My grand grandfather was a merchant who ran a small business . He couldn't afford to send my grand father to school . 
 Right . Later he was a soldier and a fireman in the village . When he was middle aged , he became a great man , quite famous . 
 As a leader of police officers in charge of the whole country . 
 No . He retired from that . He is a senator now . 
 Well , maybe when I get old . But first I'll be a lawyer . 
 Sure . Go back and take the third turning on the left . 
 It is really like a labyrinth . 
 It is so popular among people to preserve health now , so I read some books about health food . 
 Drinking warm and fresh water in the morning on wakening up is one of ways to keep healthy . 
 Warm water can be good for your stomach , which is empty at that moment . And freshness can keep the water active to clean your digest system . 
 Yogurt , because it has protein , vitamins and it is acidic . If you drink it everyday , your stomach will be more comfortable . 
 What ’ s the matter ? Didn ’ t you get enough sleep last night ? 
 Are you worried about something ? Why couldn ’ t you sleep ? 
 Well , take it easy . Things will look better tomorrow . Maybe you should try exercising or a hot bath to help you relax . 
 Hi , Mark ! Long time no see ! 
 Where have you been ? 
 How was your flight ? 
 That ’ s too bad . how long was the flight ? 
 Did you have a layover ? 
 Did you buy anything in the duty-free stores ? 
 Oh , you didn ’ t have to ... 
 Hello , this is Dr Cook's clinic.May I speak to Mr.Smith ? 
 Dr Cook won't be able to see you at the time suggested.Could you make it a quarter to two ? 
 Whoa ! This is a massive flea market ! 
 And hundreds of booths-all filled with different kinds of stuff . 
 You can't buy much more , Wei ! You already have enough to fill two boxes to send back to Taiwan . 
 Could you please wait for a minute ? I'll buy the tickets 
 Here is your ticket . 
 The park will close soon . We Should better go in right now . 
 Yes , let's go in . 
 Yes , how do you know ? 
 Well , generally speaking , the park is a window on the world history , a window on the world civilization and a window on the world's tourist attractions as well . 
 No . Just let me see a doctor . I'm worried about my arm . 
 Steve Schliessman . S C H L I E S S M A N . 
 349-95- 8821 . 
 Yes , I do . Blue Cross . 
 No , I don't . 
 Can I sit down now ? 
 Good evening , Mr . Wu . 
 Have you met my wife , Mary ? 
 Mary , this is Mr . Wu , my new Chinese friend . 
 How do you do ? 
 Do you know how late it is ? 
 I hope you don't think that excuse lets you off the hook . 
 Haven't I asked you to call if you're going to be home late ? 
 Regardless , all you had to do was give a call . 
 Come home late one more time , and you'll find your stuff outside . 
 That's right , maybe then you'll respect my rules . 
 It's time for desserts ! Are you still hungry ? 
 what are you going to try first ? 
 do they serve the yogurt with anything ? 
 that sounds good . I'm going to start with an Italian tiramisu . 
 ok . Mmm . 
 it's nice , but it's rather plain . Do you want to try my tiramisu ? 
 what do you think ? Does it taste good ? 
 I'm glad you like it . I don't care for it . Why don't you finish my tiramisu so that I can try one of those fried bananas ? 
 do you know where they are from . 
 do you want me to get you one , too ? 
 ok , I'll be back with two fried bananas in a few minutes . Wait for me here ! 
 Yes , sir . For what time ? 
 OK , sir . Five persons at 7:00 . 
 Sorry , sir . We have only tables in the main dinning room left . 
 I would like to find this book . 
 I don ’ t think you guys have it . 
 I did that . 
 It should be on the shelf , but I didn ’ t see it . 
 I didn ’ t know you could do that . 
 I appreciate your help . 
 From here , it does look like it could use a little work . Let ’ s see what the interior looks like . 
 Sometimes all a place needs is a little bit of cleaning and some fresh paint . 
 I think that we should check out the kitchen . It is listed as roomy and spacious . 
 The picture in the listing shows a lovely master suite . I think that we should go look at it since we are here . 
 Well , I think that it is pretty safe to say that this is not the house for you . 
 OK . Do you have any advantages to work in our entry agency ? 
 Wonderful , I will give you a chance of interview . 
 You can find one at the ticket office . 
 You are welcome . 
 I ’ Ve just parted with my boyfriend . 
 But I cannot forget him . 
 That's disappointing . I was really looking forward to it . 
 I have a lesson once a week but I try to practice every day . 
 I usually look at English language websites every day and go to my local English Corner twice a week . 
 Sadly , I hardly ever speak to English people . I usually practice with my Chinese friends . 
 Hello . I'm sorry to tell you that I've lost my credit card this morning . I want to report the loss and replace a card . 
 Done ! 
 Thank goodness . 
 OK ! Thank you very much . See you a week later . 
 What's the matter , Paul ? 
 So , what are you going to do ? 
 I'm sorry , but I really need it this afternoon . 
 Sure . That's no problem . 
 Here you go . Anything else ? 
 So , John , what do you do for a living ? 
 Oh , really ? That sounds interesting , what kinds of book do you publish ? 
 Oh , What a cool job ! How long have you worked there ? 
 May I have your order , please ? 
 OK . How do you like your steak , do you like it rare , medium or well done ? 
 Anything else ? 
 It will be ready right away . 
 Here you are . Have a nice stay here . 
 We will find you one . Wait a moment . 
 Oh , so the zoo is over there . Thank you so much for your help . 
 I ’ m actually travelling around Asia . 
 Probably another week . 
 Thank you very much . That ’ s very kind . 
 I should say it is something we have never come across before . 
 In my opinion , overly strict regulations are just another way of restricting imports . 
 Why not ? Our cannedlichee and canned provisions have already been widely sold in various markets abroad , and the Ma Ling Label has now been accepted by most of overseas customers and importers . Is it quite impossible for you to use the Ma Ling labels as they are ? 
 In that case , what can we do to help you ? Have you any suggestions ? 
 Do you think that's the only way out ? You know we usually do the labeling , as we are responsible for the brand labels of our products . 
 I'm not going to buy one . 
 I think it's a waste of money . 
 How is that ? 
 Is that right ? 
 That sounds nice . 
 Yeah , I think I will . 
 My immediate family is quite small . It's just my older step-brother , my mom , my step-dad and me . How about you ? 
 I didn't know you were a twin ! Are you identical or fraternal ? 
 Interesting . It must be great having a twin sister . Are you best friends , too ? 
 I don't know much about him . He died when I was just a baby . Even though I don't have a blood relationship with my step-father and step-brother , I consider them to be my real family . 
 No , she also died when my step-brother was little . My mother and my step-father met each other shortly after my father died and became good friends . They ended up getting married a few years later . 
 My son came home from three years in the navy . 
 Yeah . We rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home . 
 As a matter of fact , he hasn't been feeling too well . 
 Tell him I hope he's better soon . 
 Good morning , Madam . What can I do for you ? 
 Do you have an appointment ? 
 Ah , yes , Ms Reeve . I have all of your information here . Do you have the cash cheque ? 
 I'm sorry Ms Reeve , it says 45,000 RIB here . 
 I'm sorry , we cannot make corrections on these . You'll have to bring another one with the correct amount , I'm afraid . 
 I am just looking , thank you ... Excuse me . Can you tell me where I can buy a pair of shoes ? 
 Thank you . 
 I ’ m flattered , but really anyone else could do it . 
 I ’ m thinking of making an album , you know . 
 Yes , I spent so much time sightseeing here . It is already so late now . I am afraid I can't catch the last bus back to downtown . 
 I am very grateful to your help . 
 Thanks again . 
 You bet . I'm really excited . 
 I'm OK . 
 OK , Well , I can teach you how I make them , which is the same way my father and grandmother make them , which is a little special . 
 First you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl , and whisk them up , quite , so they're quite high and fluffy , and in a hot pan , and you need a pan that's that's kind of small , that the sides go up at an angle . You put some oil and heat it up , so it's quite hot , and then you take your whipped up eggs , or whisked up eggs , and pour them into the pan , and as it's cooking , if you take a spatula , and push the bottom layer of the egg , to the side , to the sides , and then to the middle , so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan . 
 OK . And keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over , you'll only have to cook that side lightly . Put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese . 
 Mm , it is . 
 Um , well , if you want to do a real simple one , you can just use some pre-made salsa and cheese , and that's easy , or you can do something like cut up some ham and cheese , onions , tomatoes , mushrooms , anything that you like . If you want to make a spinach omelet then you have to add the cooked spinach to the egg mixture . So it's actually cooked in it . It's inside bacon and sour cream is nice and Jack cheese . 
 What , Hilary ? I ’ m really in a hurry ! 
 I ’ Ve been busy , Hilary . We can set up a meeting to talk about the deal , but I still feel the same way . I don ’ t think it ’ s worth it . 
 of course . Is the dinner still on ? 
 we were planning on walking both ways since the weather is still nice . 
 it can't be that bad . 
 really ? I never would have guessed . The criminals must only come out in the evenings , because I've never noticed anything strange when I've been at your house in the daytime . 
 ok , we will . How do you get around in the evenings ? 
 has anything else happened to you ? 
 well , we'll be careful . Thanks for letting me know . 
 Sorry , I'm busy . Why don't you ask Alice ? 
 What do you think about half day kindergarten for Stacey ? 
 I just think it will be a little difficult for her to be away from home for so long right off the bat . 
 I think she is really going to like her teacher though . 
 Did you happen to notice if she was interested in any of the other kids ? 
 Can I try it on now ? 
 The dress is slim in cut . 
 You're looking great . 
 Speed Airlines Reservation . May I help you ? 
 Yes . Flight DP336 leaves at 15:16 . Is that all right ? 
 No , Sir.It has an hour layover in London . 
 Staying out all night , you frightened me to death . 
 You should at least give me a call . 
 Today more and more people advocate lifelong learning . But people have different views about lifelong learning . How do you understand lifelong learning ? 
 Does that mean studying all the time ? 
 Then the axiom - ' You can't teach an old dog new tricks ' doesn't work any longer . 
 Yes , I agree with you . When I retired I will participate in programs to keep momentally active . 
 You know what ? I've recently been teaching myself French . 
 Yes , so I want to learn French to develop my career . 
 What's the matter ? Are you OK ? 
 Don't worry . You have plenty of time to decide . 
 You always worry too much about everything . Take it easy , honey . You are good enough . You can go to the ideal college . 
 In a perfect world , I would enjoy my work if I do not have to do much , and make lots of money ! 
 That's only a joke . To be honest , I have to improve my English , because my English is not good enough . I still get confused about some simple grammars . Since you are quite good at it , do you have any suggestions ? 
 Is the training center helpful ? 
 Do I have to deposit my handbag at the checkroom ? 
 Thank you . I'd tike to buy some milk powder for my baby . Is there anything that you can recommend for me ? 
 No more than three . 
 How about its quality ? 
 OK , what is this ? 
 It is thoughtful . I will take it . 
 Yeah , why , is there something going on Thursday ? 
 Bob is retiring , wow ... that's news to me , I had no idea Bob was that old , retirement's still sixty-five , right ? 
 Wow ... I thought he was early forty stops , why would he want to retire so soon ? 
 Hi Sam . 
 When did you buy your new computer ? 
 So what's the problem ? 
 Can I have a look ? 
 Oh this is the new little EEE notebook from Asks . How much did you pay ? 
 Very nice . I am sure we will sort out your Internet in no time . 
 That will be perfect . 
 You really have talent . How did you learn to do this ? 
 Me , too . But I could never make bracelets like these . 
 I'll take one right now for seven dollars . 
 I've got some bad news about the bike you lent me . 
 I fell on the way to school , and your bike got scratched . I'm really sorry . 
 No , thank you . 
 It's kind of you to say . I feel a little stupid . 
 When you lent me the bike , it looked brand new , almost anyway . 
 I appreciate that , thank you . 
 I ’ d like extra prints made of these photos . 
 Yes.Here they are . I ’ Ve marked how many prints I want on each shot . 
 Four by six , except this one . I want a ten by thirteen print of this one . 
 Did you know that drinking beer helps you sing better ? 
 Well , usually people think I'm a terrible singer , but after we all have a few beers , they say I sound a lot better ! 
 May I serve your dishes now ? 
 With sugar ? 
 I went to visit a customer in IVS Company the other day . Their offices were very impressive , especially their company Logo which is all over the place . There are Logo models in metal , copper , clove , paper . They are even printed on the wall paper and the balls of the table-lights . It is really decorated identity . 
 Not at all ! I like the design so much . The designer must have thought really hard to come out with such a brilliant concept . 
 Hello ? Ms . Patterson ? This is Bill from Workmate calling . I'm just wondering if you had a chance to look over the estimate I sent for your gala dinner project next month ... As I said in my email , we can help you with production according to your needs , but we will only be able to give insite management support services on a limited basis . 
 Yes , I have several copies , but they're all different versions ... The latest I have is version 12 , is that current ? 
 Hold on , let me pull up your version 7 requirements ... Oh yes , no wonder our estimate is a little different from what you had in mind . I see the version 7 also includes 6 additional hostesses and a cocktail self-serve bar that wasn't in the version 12 . That will definitely add to your cost on this project ... 
 It was great ! How was your year ? 
 Yes , I'm dating someone . Her name is Amanda . 
 Well , I ’ ll be glad to help you out . I can come out anytime on Tuesday or Thursday of next week . 
 Fine . I ’ ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogues on Thursday . 
 Yes . Do you have a pharmacy here , please ? 
 Which floor are we on now ? 
 And where's the elevator ? 
 May I help you , sir ? 
 Regular or unleaded ? 
 How many gallons do you want ? 
 All right . Shall I check the oil ? 
 You're a quart low . 
 Yes , sir . 
 I think the style is a little old-fashioned . It's not what I want . 
 Oh , yes . That's just the one I want . I will take it . 
 It ’ s very kind of you to say so . My associate and I will be interested in visiting your factory . 
 Thank you . I ’ ll give you a call this afternoon to set the time . There ’ s nothing like seeing things with one ’ s own eyes . 
 We like your product , and are interested in placing an order with you as soon as possible . 
 That's all right . We will send you a purchase order in one week . I hope you will be able to take care of it . 
 Thanks . We need the products in less than one month , because we have a big deal with another company . By the way , will payment against delivery be OK ? 
 Hello . Mr . Othman ? This is Michael in Mr . Emory ’ s office . He ’ d like to set up and appointment with you to talk about buying a new copier . 
 He ’ d like to do it as soon as possible , sir . How about tomorrow at 2:45 ? 
 Do you plan to further your study ? 
 If you make every effort to the company , you will have a great chance to attend the on-the-job postgraduate . The tuition fee will be financed by our company . 
 Excuse me , madam . Is this seat taken ? 
 Do you mind my sharing the same table with you ? 
 Yes . I can't even find a seat . 
 What's wrong , honey ? Take it easy . 
 Me too . But I think we can do something else for a change . 
 But you did a good job . You always perform the best in our company . 
 Perhaps you've just tired and you need a vacation . 
 Maybe we should keep on studying to enrich our knowledge and make our life exciting . 
 How about a training course ? 
 But it's worth it . Maybe it can get us into a good mood and also helps us learn something to use for the future . 
 OK . 
 it's Cindy , you know that . Hey , Cindy , say hello to Maria . 
 she is also very naughty . By the way , do you have a dog , Maria ? 
 Oh , a cat ? Come on . 
 but I think they're dull , aren't they ? 
 well , cats are certainly more independent . 
 oh , really ? so you just took home a stray cat ? 
 Poor cat . 
 Can you help me now ? 
 That'll be too late . 
 I did , but he wasn't able to either . 
 I'm looking for the cameras . 
 Can you play baseball with me today ? 
 Where's the new house ? Is it far from here ? 
 Can I help you pack ? 
 I hear that Mary got mad . 
 What ’ s wrong with her ? 
 I have never bought a house before and don ’ t know how to make an offer . 
 I love this house and would be willing to pay the full asking price of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars . 
 We could try that , but I really want this house ! 
 How long will it take to find out if they are going to accept the offer ? 
 Should I tell my bank that I have made an offer ? 
 Paul , let's go and see Grandpa this afternoon . 
 It's Saturday . 
 On balance , dress designing appeals to me most . 
 Say , how would you like to be a dress designer ? 
 Hello there , welcome to Wine World . Let me know if I can help you out at all . 
 OK , do you know what kind of food will be served ? 
 Hmm , that's a bit of a challenge . Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine . Well , let's see . have to be a white wine , of course . 
 No , I don't think so . Sushi is a very delicately flavored food , and red wine would be a jarring contrast . You need a white wine , which has more subtle flavors , to complement the fish . 
 Yes , Chardonnay is a white wine , but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet . Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites , and tends to be a bit oaky . I'd suggest that you go for something brighter , like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand . 
 That's another varietal , or type of grape , just like Chardonnay . 
 It's OK , don't worry , we'll just choose a wine from the cooler . We don't have quite as extensive a selection over here , but ... this Rhone Valley white would be lovely . 
 Well , this is a French wine , so they don't always specify the varietal on the label . The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine . This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes , mostly Viognier , I'd guess . 
 Yes , this is one of our best-sellers . It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier , which means it's more approachable . It's light and crisp , with a bit of a vanilla aroma . 
 Mom , happy Mother's Day ! A necklace for you . 
 Thank you for your love and care over the years . I love you so much . 
 How about a dinner tonight ? My treat . 
 All right . Let me prepare the supper . 
 Did you think it wasn't real ? That's my pet lizard . 
 His name is Grunt . Come closer and I'll properly introduce you . 
 No , he's perfectly harmless . And he's not afraid of strangers either . Here , hold him . 
 Stick around and you'll get to know him better . He has a very unusual personality . 
 I'm almost done . 
 I'm all done now . 
 I don't understand . 
 What's wrong with it ? 
 I apologize . 
 Excuse me ? Let's try to work this out , okay ? 
 It ’ s Tuesday today . I always go to my class on Tuesday night . 
 Well , I ’ m learning how to use math in the business environment . 
 The job market is so competitive nowadays . I want to develop some useful skills . 
 It ’ s going all right . I ’ m learning some things for the first time , but I ’ m also brushing up on some things that I already know . 
 Yeah . But in my heart of hearts , I find he ’ s not very much to my liking . 
 The problem is that I just have no one to turn to right now . 
 What is the best way to find a job here ? 
 I don't know . 
 It doesn't matter right now , either one would be OK . 
 OK , I'll go check it out . 
 I am not sure . 
 How is your job search 1 going , Janet ? 
 Are you serious ? You studied mathematics at college for four years , and now you have a job working with your hands ! 
 I can see that . But I didn ’ t know you had experience in that line of work . 
 Congratulations ! You do have the right attitude . 
 OK , I will fetch the remote control . 
 Yes . Here you are . 
 Sure , if you're done ! 
 Well , listen , Honey , you've been a big help lately ... 
 If you take out the garbage and do the dishes , I'll think about it . 
 Nothing in life is free , Son . 
 During the last two years , there has been a great increase in goods stolen abroad . 
 If the goods are received in apparent good order and condition , the steamship company doesn ’ t have liability for pilferage . How do we protect ourselves ? 
 Is it true that products of high value such as watches , jewels and luxury clothing items are often subject to pilferage ? 
 How was Mei ’ s party on Saturday ? 
 Oh really ? What did you do ? 
 I see . Anything else ? 
 Well , it sounds like you really enjoyed yourself . 
 Yes . What is the rent ? 
 Then what's the rent due date ? 
 You are saying he will be promoted to the general manager ? 
 Are you sure ? 
 Just because he gets on well with everybody ? 
 Are you going somewhere ? 
 Where do you work ? 
 You didn ’ t tell me you were working there this year . 
 How ’ d you get that job ? 
 That ’ s interesting . 
 How much do they pay ? 
 Good coming , sir . What can I do for you ? 
 Very good , sir . What kind would you like ? 
 Besides the checking account , there's a monthly savings account and a daily interest account . 
 Would you fill out this form ? 
 All right . And here's your deposit book . 
 Goodbye . 
 Yes . I can't find my sweater . I have my laundry sent to you yesterday but when the washing is done . I find my swatter missing . 
 That's fine . Maybe you should be more careful . 
 Our pleasure . We have several package tours you may choose , from ten days to three weeks in Europe . 
 I have one ten-day tour that is still available . It will depart from New York on December 24th . 
 The price for one person for a ten-day tour is only 1,099 US dollars , which includes round trip airfare . 
 Ok , but don't delay too long , or that trip will be all booked . 
 Nothing special , just working . Why do you ask ? 
 I'd like to , but I'm not sure if I can . Work has been really busy lately . Why don't we go on Friday instead ? 
 OK , then let's try to go this weekend . I should know if I can go by Friday . Is it OK if I call you then ? 
 What's your number ? 
 OK , I'll talk to you soon . 
 I'd like to make an appointment with manager Mr.Wu . Would 10:00 a . m . tomorrow be all right ? 
 Could I possibly make it early in the afternoon ? 
 Thank you very much . 
 Yeah , about 5 minutes ago . 
 The Bulls , of course ! 
 Don ’ t worry , Shan always screws up free throws . 
 That was a great shot ! A three pointer , yeah ! 
 This ref needs glasses . Hey ref , open your eyes ! I can ’ t believe he didn ’ t see that ! 
 Good morning ! 
 Would you hold on a second , please ? Miss Cooper's extension is engaged . 
 I'm sorry , sir . I can't interrupt her . I'm sure she won't be very long . 
 I really can't say how long she'll be . 
 Yes , certainly . 
 Yes , sir . I'll ring her on an inside line if you like . 
 What a washing machine ! It ’ s getting worse today . Look ! Now it doesn ’ t work at all . I think I need a new one . 
 Of course ! Let ’ s have a look . Great ! In my frame of mind , I ’ d like to buy one today . 
 Actually , my mother made it from scratch . 
 I feel itchy ! I can ’ t stand it anymore ! I think I may be coming down with something . I feel lightheaded and weak . 
 What ’ s wrong ? 
 Maybe it ’ s just a rash or an allergy ! We can ’ t be sure until I see a doctor . 
 Are you serious ? You always blow things out of proportion . In any case , I think I ’ ll go take an oatmeal bath . 
 Yes , of course . Have you got the tickets ? 
 Matinee or evening ? 
 Circle or stalls ? 
 Wonderful , I'll go with you . 
 Not yet , Mr . Wang . But I'm working on it . 
 I just keep getting a busy signal . 
 All right , I'll let you know when I get through . 
 Well , if not gymnastics , then mountain biking . 
 Since 1996 it has been . And I bet I'd be pretty good at it . I ride my mountain bike to work almost every day . 
 Speaking . 
 All right . What time are you coming ? 
 Can we make it 11:30 ? A customer will come to the office at 11 . 
 Great . I'll see you on the 7th . 
 What's going on ? 
 More and more people easily get irritated while driving . 
 Good afternoon , sir . Can I help you ? 
 What flavor would you prefer , sir ? 
 We have strawberry , chocolate , vanilla and banana . 
 Anything else , sir ? 
 I really appreciate your driving me around . 
 It would be hard for just me to do it . I don't know the city at all . 
 This one sounds good.Efficiency with view of the lake.Utilities and parking included . Newly remodeled kitchen . $ 470 . 
 No , I guess not . But that's what I want , isn't it ? An efficiency . 
 How about this one ? Downtown efficiency . Furnished ... What does furnished mean ? 
 That's good . 
 Furnished . Parking included . $ 400 . 
 Yes , but it's downtown . I would like to take look at this one . 
 256-7797 . 
 This one . Two male grad students seeking roommate.Must be quiet . Comfortable downtown apartment.Does this mean I have to share a room with them ? 
 That sounds alright . 
 Here's the number , 256-4367 . 
 Sounds good to me . I really appreciate your help on this . 
 Good evening . Do you have a reservation ? 
 How many people are you together ? 
 Would you like to sit in a smoking section , a non-smoking section or whatever comes open first ? 
 I am awfully sorry but there are no vacancies left now . Would you like to wait for a moment ? 
 I think about ten minutes . 
 I am sorry for making you wait so long . Now there is a table available in non-smoking section . Please follow me . 
 This is the menu . Are you ready to order now ? 
 Yes , and what would you like to drink ? 
 Would you like a dessert ? 
 Lemon pie , hot cake in syrup , chocolate sundae and custard pudding . 
 All right . I'll bring your soup right away . 
 Yes . I'll be with you in a second . Yes , sir ? What is the problem ? 
 What did you order ? 
 There must be a mistake . Those are fried oysters . Would you like to keep it or change ? 
 Just a moment and I'll get your order right away . Sorry to cause the inconvenience . 
 John , I'm hard up at the moment . Could you lend me five hundred yuan ? I'll return it to you early next month . 
 Yes . Thank you so much . 
 Here you are . 
 Yes , that's a video camera . 
 There's a double feature at the cinema this Saturday . Do you want to go with me ? 
 There's an action movie with Harrison Ford and a chick flick with Susan Abandon . 
 So , is that a yes ? 
 It starts at one and yea , let's meet there . It's the cinema on the corner of Lincoln and Main . 
 I am afraid I have some bad news for you . It's about our order contract O5TSWAL . 
 The goods arrived half a month later than scheduled . What's more , five cases were found broken and unit inside seriously damaged . 
 But then there were some cracks in a number of cases . Almost all the bottom of the cases were loose . 
 But our surveyors found the damage was caused by poor packing . 
 But you filled the cartons too full and the straps are not strong enough . When they were rehandled , some of them were broken . 
 Please switch work shifts with me . 
 Why can't you ? 
 Do you drink much ? 
 How frequently do you drink ? 
 Only when I go out . I'm not a big drinker . 
 I usually only have 2 beers . 
 How much can you drink ? 
 Don't you spend a lot of money then ? 
 That's true . 
 I like beer , it's just that I get a headache when I drink more than 3 . 
 It'll take awhile , but I'm working on it . 
 Alright . 
 You can check out two books at a time . 
 For two weeks . After that you must renew the books if you wish to keep them longer . 
 I haven't decided yet . What about you , Andy ? 
 But I don't know how to play basketball . 
 Is anybody in ? 
 I have a headache . 
 OK . 
 I thought so . I felt dizzy this morning . 
 I do feel like a trip to Florida on such a gloomy day in New York , to enjoy the sunshine while lying on the beaches of Florida . 
 But if the sunshine is too strong , it might damage the eyes and the skin . 
 I see . Overdoing it will do more harm than good . 
 Tom did me many favors . 
 What are your strengths and weaknesses ? 
 What is your problem in working ? 
 The poor girl is up to the eyes in study all the day . 
 Today's children have not the chance to play , to make fun of them . 
 Yeah , at least when we are children , we have not so much homework to do . 
 Yes , but it's not so appetizing . 
 That's what's hanging on my mind recently . 
 The question is we only need one . 
 I should take the taller one for the choice . 
 Not quite yet . 
 It's still very far away . 
 We're getting close . 
 Here we are . 
 It is in front of you . 
 I'm glad to hear it . 
 I'm so happy you remember , please come in and enjoy the party . Everyone's here , I'm sure you have a good time . 
 Ok . 
 Yes , you are always popular with everyone . and you look very pretty today . 
 You look great , you are absolutely glowing . 
 Two people were robbed last night near the park . 
 I am afraid of the dark . I don ’ t feel safe in the dark . I feel someone is hiding in the dark to attack me . 
 I Know . And you should be more careful , too . 
 Hold on a second please . I'm sorry . He has gone out . 
 He will be back at about seven o'clock . 
 Yes , certainly . 
 All right . I'll tell him when he comes back . 
 Mr . Li , the report has been finished . 
 You're welcome . This is my duty . Anything else ? 
 OK , I'll do it right now . 
 Yes , I get it . 
 Good morning , I am Monica . Are you Mr . White , the manager of finance department ? I am the newcomer and also working in the finance department . 
 Thank you . I am very happy to have my own office now . I ’ Ve never had one before . It is very nice . 
 Really ? What could that be ? 
 That is very kind of you . Thank you very much . 
 I need to return these books . 
 The cover came off . 
 How much are you talking ? 
 That ’ s not bad at all . 
 Here you go . 
 You ’ re welcome . Have a nice day . 
 Pretty good . The HR manager asked me the usual questions . Then he wondered why I had decided to leave my previous job . 
 I told him that I hadn ’ t got a raise for three years . I also told him that one of my best co-workers quitted her job because she had not been promoted for eight years . 
 Yes . I told him that my boss made some excuses of the recession . But I thought he had a pattern and a record of promoting men only . 
 In a couple of days , I was told . 
 Thank you . 
 A gang of bastards are wildly shooting on the next street . We must leave this place the soonest . 
 Stop your nonsense ! Quick . Let ’ s leave the place ! 
 We produce household cleaning products - detergents and so on . They are all phosphate-free , which minimises damage to the environment . 
 We try to use as little packaging as possible . Also , all our bottles are made of recyclable plastic and we use recycled fibre in our boxes . That's what our customers want . 
 I'm sorry about that , sir . I'll get you another one . 
 I see . Maybe I can offer you a credit note . 
 OK , sir . I'll see what I can do . 
 Really ? Their songs are very popular all round Asia now . I am also a big fan of theirs . 
 I really love their dancing . They are all excellent dancers . 
 Sure . I think you can hear the song everywhere you go now . 
 Why not ? 
 I certainly have the will but I wonder if I've found the way . 
 Let me say something about the falling Australian Dollar . We're both hurt by the rising U . S . Dollar . We will have to pay more Renminbi for U . S . Dollar to buy wool from you . 
 Do you ? Then you can see that we have one wish that is to conclude this transaction in a way that will satisfy both sides . What can you do to help ? 
 All right . I accept this reduced offer at $ 98 per metric ton FOB stowed . The other terms and conditions shall remain the same as those in the previous agreement . Now will you draft the agreement or shall I ? 
 Ok . Then well bring it over to you tomorrow morning . You'll sign it first , so it will only need my signature . Is that agreeable to you ? 
 Good . Let's shake hands on this successful transaction . 
 Don't worry about it . 
 No . Don't be silly . I wouldn't dream of letting you do that . 
 Certainly . Could you put it on the scales , so I can check the weight ? 
 That ’ s 850 grams . The coasts depends on how you would like to send it . 
 That ’ s right . Sending it by airmail will cost twelve dollars and sending it by surface mail will cost eight dollars . 
 Airmail should take four or five days and surface mail should take about two weeks . 
 No problem . That ’ s one dollar extra . 
 There ’ s you receipt . Goodbye . 
 Yes , please . 
 My luggage is in the corner over there . They are the leather suitcase , the canvass holdall and the blue backpack . 
 Please be careful with the suitcase , it's very heavy . 
 And the holdall has some fragile items inside , so please be careful with that too . 
 how long will it take us to drive to London ? 
 that ’ s unless there is a traffic jam . It could take three hours . 
 so , shall we allow three hours to cover the distance ? 
 no . let me take a look ... it ’ s longer than my car . 
 wow ! That ’ s fast ! I don ’ t think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway . 
 Are we going to have gym class tomorrow ? 
 Sometimes I forget that we don't have school on Saturdays . 
 So there are only five working days in a week ? 
 I'm going to study . 
 Well , I need to polish up my English . 
 We're okay for vegetables but we should stock up on meat . Can you go to the butcher's and get some veal and some beef ? 
 Better visit the supermarket then . We'll need some other things for the party . Get some vanilla ice cream , some butter and some vinegar and twelve bottles of beer . 
 I'll see you later then . 
 Can I help you , Madam ? 
 Certainly , Madam . It's a stir fried dish of minced pork with glass noodles . 
 How do you do ? 
 My name is Jane Greenwood.Glad to meet you . 
 I'm going to quit this job . It's way too stressful . 
 Yeah , I'm in the office till 10 every night . I can't take it anymore . The pay just isn't worth it . 
 Who would you like to talk to ? 
 What is phone number ? 
 Your name , please . 
 hold on , please . 
 Her line is through now , please go ahead . 
 So am I . 
 Well , Mr . King is singing . 
 He ’ s standing on a ladder and banging some nails into the wall with a hammer . Now he ’ s hanging some strong strings on the nails . 
 She ’ s bringing something pink for Mr . King to drink . Now she ’ s putting it ... OK . 
 The ladder ’ s falling ? 
 He ’ s hanging from the string . He ’ s holding onto the string with his fingers and shouting to Mrs . King . 
 No , she ’ s running toward our house . That ’ s her ringing the bell . 
 Were you engaged in any activities at college ? 
 What kind of activity would make you get involved ? 
 I don't know what I'm going to do . I need to find a job . If I don't , I won't be able to stay here next semester . 
 What do you mean ? 
 Yes , I know . I tried that.They don't have anything now . So what can I do ? 
 I know that . You don't have to tell me that . That's my problem . I know I have the right to work for the university . That's legal.But they don't have a job for me . And it's illegal for me to get a job elsewhere . 
 But I need a pretty decent job . I need to make enough to pay my rent at least . 
 What ? 
 I already had that idea . 
 But I don't know what I would do . 
 Maybe . I don't know . 
 I have to find something.Otherwise I have to go back to Taiwan . I'll be broke in two months . 
 Sure.Let me measure for you . 
 $ 200 . The delivery time is 2 weeks . 
 The bartender just gave the last call . Let's order another round , okay ? 
 That sounds good . You order the beer while I go to the bathroom . Where is the can in this place ? 
 Yeah . I think I can find it . 
 That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around . That bathroom is too gross for me . 
 Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air , anyway . 
 There are so many flavors of ice cream to choose from ! 
 I love fruit flavored ices the best . 
 What is your least favorite ice cream ? 
 Yeah , I know what you mean . 
 That could be interesting . 
 Our son is gone and my heart is gone too . I don ’ t know how to spend the rest of my years . 
 I feel life is meaningless without him . 
 House keeping.May I come in ? 
 Good evening , sir . I come to make the bed . Shall I do it now or later ? 
 That's all . Have a nice stay here . 
 Just a moment . I will do it right now . 
 My name is Sun lin . 
 I am twenty-five years old . 
 Yes , my birth date is September 22 , 1977 . 
 I live at 606 Zhongguancun Road , Apt 802 , Beijing . 
 My birthplace is Nanjing . 
 My domicile place is Nanjing , too . 
 I understand . 
 Some days are just like that . 
 I had a really busy day . I had to work a little overtime . In the morning an important client called to place a large order . I had to check some things with my colleagues before confirming the order . 
 The most important thing was to check that we had the goods in stock . If the goods are in stock , we can deliver them immediately . I also had to check the price . This customer is very important , so the 
 I received a lot of emails from potential clients that I had to answer . Each time , I had to check files to see what we had agreed at earlier meetings . Each client has different conditions and required 
 Yes . That ’ s why we have everything on computer files . We don ’ t use much paper at our office . After lunch , I had to deal with a complaint form a client . 
 Yes , it was . I managed to sort out the problem , but I was tied up with the matter for over an hour . 
 That ’ s not all ! I also had to finish writing a sales report for my boss . In the end , I finished everything . I wonder what will be waiting for me tomorrow morning . 
 Yes , certainly.How can I help you ? 
 Sorry , I don ’ t know . I ’ m a passengers ’ m waiting for my train .. 
 Certainly not.Here it is . 
 Hello . Thank you for calling Spend Mart . 
 Yes . How can I help you ? 
 Do you have the receipt with you ? 
 I like to apologize for the problem . Please come down with your receipt and sweater to exchange it for the size you want . 
 You ’ re welcome . 
 No problem . 
 I knew everything would work out for you ! 
 Wonderful ! Do you already have your work schedule ? 
 Do you know what you will be doing yet ? 
 You're so good with people . I think they will like you ! 
 Yes , what kind of smell do you like ? 
 How about this one ? It's not that concentrated . 
 Sure . 
 Aren't firecrackers forbidden in the city ? 
 Fantastic ! The whole city is echoing with crackling sounds ! 
 Quite a lot . The celebration of the New Year has just started . The first day we southerners have sweet rice cakes for breakfast , and people in the North have Jiaozi . Afterward , we will make New Year calls on family relatives , husband's side on the first day and wife's side on the second . 
 That's for sure . Fruit , cream cakes , medical tonics are often for parents and aged relatives , and cash enclosed in a red envelope for the kids . All this , of course , should be well prepared beforehand . 
 Not all the same nowadays I must say . Many families , especially those of newly married couples , choose to make an overseas trip to escape the routines . Rose and I had a tour to Singapore , Malaysia , Thailand and Hong Kong last year . We stayed there for two weeks until the last day of the holiday . 
 Well , for city dwellers , the Spring Festival is a holiday of seven days . While in the country where traditions are still heavily emphasized , the festival lasts ten days . 
 But of course ! We have a great exercise facility . 
 It's located right under our lobby . Just take the elevator or the stairs one flight down . 
 No , sir . The gym is absolutely free . However , be sure to take your room key with you . 
 The hours couldn't be better , 24/7 . 
 I wish I could tell you yes , but no , there isn't . 
 Yesterday . I was really sorry to see it end . The skiing was terrific ! 
 Sorry to hear that ! But I would definitely recommend this place ! 
 Excuse me , Miss . Can you show me my seat ? 
 Thanks a lot . 
 This is Wang Miao from AB company speaking . Our CEO Mr . Green has an appointment with Mr . Liang tomorrow morning . But there is a minor change in tomorrow's schedule . Mr . Green has an abrupt urgent case tomorrow and he has to go abroad today . He wanted me to convey his apology to Mr . Wang . 
 And Mr . Green will make another appointment when Mr . Wang comes back . 
 Bye ! 
 How are you ? 
 Did you need something ? 
 How may I help you ? 
 Have you checked the periodicals section yet ? 
 If you ’ d like , I can show you were to find it . 
 Follow me . 
 Can you believe that Obama is our new President ? 
 Did you vote for him ? 
 I voted for him . 
 Is that right ? 
 I hope so , because America needs a change . 
 I agree with you completely . 
 Come in , please . 
 Good morning . You are Mr . Sun , aren't you ? Take a seat , please . 
 I've noticed from your resume that you majored in accounting at Peking University . Will you please tell me something about your related courses ? 
 Have you taken Accounting for Decision-Making and Control ? 
 From your school report card , I can see you did well in every course . But our advertisement says we need an accountant with practical work experience . 
 You can speak English fluently but I wonder if you can deal with bookkeeping and accounting in English . 
 That sounds fine . Why did you choose to apply to our company ? 
 Do you know something about the payment we give to our employees ? 
 Of course . As for an entry-level accountant , we pay ¥ 1,500 a month in the first half year . We have a grading system to evaluate your work . If you have made progress , we will certainly raise your salary . For beginners with a CPA certificate , they can earn at least ¥ 2 , 000 a month . 
 I hope you can show me your CPA certificate before we reach a decision by the end of July . 
 The same for me . We'll keep in touch with you . 
 Excuse me , I'd like to ask you a few questions about the city . 
 My wife wants to take the children to go shopping , where is the best place to go ? 
 Thank you . Also , we'd like to do some sightseeing while we're in town . Can you recommend some local attractions ? 
 I have a 10 - year-old boy and a 6 - year-old girl . 
 It sounds marvelous . Thank you for your help . 
 How can I ever thank you ? I owe you a big favor . 
 Don't you know they've already broken up ? 
 And he's so handsome . 
 Use them from the outside in . 
 Right . We do the same thing at home . Don't you remember ? 
 Let's look at our menus . 
 Well , we order appetizers first and then entrees . 
 We have thought of you carefully with discretion , but the other candidate has more experiences . 
 Yes , I think so . But how do you prove to me that you are more capable ? 
 Good idea . 
 You are lucky , sir . We are about to set out . It's a tour to the White House . 
 2 hours . You won't get late for your train . 
 You are starting to learn English ? 
 You ’ re lucky you start to learn it so easily . I learned English very late , and learned it all by myself . At that time we didn ’ t have a good English studying environment . I have to keep my dictionary on hand . 
 We have a variety of trousers . Which one do you like best ? 
 What about this one ? 
 Excuse me , sir , could you please tell me the way to Aidan Bookstore ? 
 Er ... Is it far from here ? 
 Then I'll walk.Many thanks . 
 Your tie is handsome . 
 No , it hasn't . It's very dirty . 
 Mark should clean it . It's his turn . 
 No , it isn't . You always clean it after Mark . 
 Clean it now . Only lazy people say they'll work tomorrow . 
 You are lazy . You ought to be ashamed ? You should enjoy working . 
 I am so happy to know that I could make some contribution to our company . 
 Thank you , I will be doing my best . 
 Hello , may I speak to Mr . Richard ? 
 Mr . Richard , this is Henry . I was interviewed by you last Tuesday . 
 I ’ m just calling to follow up on the situation of the salesman position . 
 Wonderful . Thank you very much . I have been dreaming to work with your company and I am finally granted the great opportunity . I won ’ t let you down and I hope you will contact me when you have any questions . 
 Honey , what's wrong with you ? 
 Take it easy . We are going to have our own baby . You should be happy . 
 The doctors and the nurses will help you . And I will be waiting for you right here , praying for you and our baby . 
 Mr . Phillips ? I have a request here from purchasing that needs your approval . 
 I believe it ’ s going to Ms . Wilson ’ s office . 
 Lisa , are there family rules in this house ? 
 Like what ? 
 Is there anything else ? 
 Her room is very neat and clean . 
 I will keep my room clean , too . That's a promise . 
 No . But it will be soon . Look , there are two empty seats over there . Let ’ s get them before somebody else does . 
 Now , Let ’ s make ourselves comfortable since we have got quiet a long way to go . 
 I think it's about time that we had to go . 
 I'd love to , but I have to get up early tomorrow and get to the office on time . 
 Thank you for a very enjoyable evening and your hospitality . 
 Would you mind telling me if this is the right way to the police station ? 
 Should I take a bus ? 
 Could you bring me some food , please ? 
 Can I have a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare ? 
 Oh , no filet ? Okay , porterhouse will be fine then . 
 Not tonight , but thank you for the suggestion . 
 No problem . 
 I give up ! I simply can't learn French ! 
 No , I'm not . I try and try and I still can't speak it very well . 
 Good idea . That might help . 
 Do I have to wear ear muffs and gloves ? I am not used to working with them on . 
 OK . I'll go and get a pair of them . 
 Yes ? 
 Can you tell me what's the time in London ? 
 Yes . I have to take a conference . Are you English ? 
 Steven , would you like to go dance with us tonight ? 
 You look so upset . What's going on ? 
 Oh , what a pity ! 
 Is it that bad ? It ’ s nothing more than a game . 
 Oh , come on ! Failure is the mother of success . Don ’ t lose heart . I'm sure you'll succeed . 
 I understand . 
 I can play the piano a bit . 
 No , no . My playing isn't good enough for me to perform in public . 
 Yes , could I settle my bill , please ? 
 Wang Wei , Room 1202 . 
 The figure seems right . 
 By credit card , please . And what kind of credit cards do you honor ? 
 Then I'll put it on my Master Card . Here you are . 
 Can I help you , sir ? 
 yes , It ’ s on the third floor 
 You ’ re welcome 
 The one in the red shirt ? 
 She's alright . 
 Why don't you go talk to her ? 
 Hell no ! You're just a chicken that's all . 
 Why don't you go stand next to her for a while and if an opportunity comes up , strike a conversation . 
 It doesn't matter . You gotta find what she's interested in and go with that . 
 Do you want me to go talk to her ? 
 If you don't do anything , I'll bet somebody else will . 
 What's the rate for a station wagon ? 
 Good . I'll take it right now , if possible . 
 Of course . I have my own license and an international license . 
 I ’ d love to have my own farm . 
 I wouldn ’ t mind getting up early morning and the physical work would make me fit and healthy . 
 That ’ s one reason I ’ d like to try it . I ’ d really like to get away from working 9 to 5 in an office . 
 My uncle owns a farm and I ’ Ve spent some time working with him . I love being in the countryside with farm animals and green fields . 
 What a brilliant smile ! 
 He must be very easy-going .
